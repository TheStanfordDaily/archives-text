# 'Deep Throat': Dull Pornography
## 
### KEVIN SMITH 
"Deep Throat" is a simple
movie about a sweet girl who
happens to have her clitoris
lodged in her throat. (If you don't
know what's unusual about that,
let me refer you to Human Bio
10!)
This physical oddity causes her
to seek sexual satisfaction in
rather strange ways, and her
dining habits have attracted
millions of viewers from all
around the country. That's a
shame because "Deep Throat" is
not only a lousy movie, but it's
lousy pornography as well.
Most people who go to
sexually explicit movies don't
expect a good plot and good
acting, but they do at least expect
some erotic entertainment. "Deep
Throat" provides neither.
The movie stars a girl named
Linda Lovelace who does not, in
reality, have her clitoris in her
throat. What Linda does have,
however, is a remarkable ability —
akin to that of a sword swallower
— to take round, stiff objects deep
into her throat (guess where the
movie got its name) without
gagging, passing out, vomiting or
whatever. And those of you who
think she gets her kicks out of
swallowing candles are in for a big
surprise.
Simple Plot
The plot is not very complex.
Poor Linda confides in her best
friend that she just doesn't enjoy
sex. Linda says she thinks sex is
allright, but she wants to hear
"bells ringing and bombs going
off." Her friend thinks that
Linda's desire to hear "bombs
going off" means that she wants
to destroy cities or some such
nonsense, and sends Linda off to
see a shrink named Dr. Young.
Dr. Young astutely decides

that Linda's problem might be
more "physical" than
"psychological," and calls for an
"internal" examination.
During the only
semi-humorous scene (depending
on your taste for sick jokes) in the
entire movie, Dr. Young, in search
of Linda's problem, suddenly
exclaimed, "Miss Lovelace, you
don't have one!"
Linda replied, "I'm a woman:
I'm not supposed to have one."
After it was determined that
Dr. Young was referring to
Linda's clitoris and not her
favorite food, the good doctor
opened Linda's mouth and cried,
"There it is, you little bugger!"
Consolation
Linda was understandably
unhappy about having her clitoris
embedded (excuse the expression)
in the wrong orifice, and Dr.
Young tried to console her by
saying, "Miss Lovelace, having a
clitoris in the bottom of your
throat is better than having no
clitoris at all."
Linda answered, with a slight
whimper, "Suppose your balls
were in your ear?" to which Dr.
Young replied, "Then I could hear
myself coming!"
It all goes downhill from there,
and if that is the highlight, just
imagine what the rest of the flick
is like!
Anyway the shrink suggests
that Linda received sexual
stimulation by having her partners
take the plunge, as it were, all the
way down her throat. This is
where Linda's marvelous culinary
(no that's not an obscene word)
act goes into effect as the good
doctor wants to make sure she
understands his instructions.
Being a noble soul, he kindly
offers himself as her first meal.
The rest of the movie finds
Linda hired as Dr. Young's
"physiotherapist" and it needn't
be described what sort of
"physiotherapy" she gives Dr.
Young's suffering patients.
Remarkable Scene
There is one rather remarkable
scene in which both Linda and a
patient are both drinking Coke
through a plastic tube from a vial
of Coke stuck in Linda's vagina.
Hmm, maybe things do go better
with Coke ....
The movie is only 62 minutes

long, and much of the time is not
even devoted to the main plot,
perhaps rriercifully. The first ten
minutes simply show Linda
driving around what appears to be
southern California. The
landscape is the best scenery in
the entire movie. In addition,
there is this attempt at music
which sounds like a cow's
imitation of rock and roll.
Then there is a totally out of
place scene in which a lot of
strange people of both sexes are
doing all manner of odd things to
each other. What relation this
scene has to the plot at hand is
not quite apparent.
Maybe it is just stuck in there
to put us in the mood for things
to "come," so to speak. It does:
that scene is boring and so is the
rest of the movie.
Dull Flick
On the whole, then, "Deep
Throat" is very dull — not even as
exciting as a normal porno flick.
The scenes are as disjointed as
Linda's throat and the horrible
marching music that bombards
the viewer during most of the film
really grates after awhile.
At least the audience was
mercifully spared those miserably
fake "Oohs" and "Uhs" from the
screen which makes most of these
movies seem even phonier than
they are in the first place.
Why "Deep Throat" has
become the most successful skin
flick of all time escapes me
completely. The judge who
banned it in New York must not
have taken a very good look
around Times Square because
there are many skin flicks which
are far more explicit and sexually
exciting than this piece of trash.
The other film playing with
"Deep Throat," entitled "Teenage
Fantasies," is actually a little
better for porno buffs. It is more
typical of the standard skin flick,
depicting seven or eight orgasms
in people of various shapes and
sizes. Even so, it leaves a lot to be
desired since the bodies aren't
much to look at and the
exaggerated "Oohs" and "Uhs"
are a bit much to take as usual.
Packed Theater
At the 7 p.m. showing, the
theater was almost packed, but
there were a few empty seats. At
the 9:15 show, there were about

200 people waiting in line outside
the theater — most of whom were
turned away. Thus people are still
coming in droves to throw away
their money.
The crowd was noticeably
different from the normal porno
flick audience. There were
relatively few drunks, derelicts
and dirty old men, and a very high
proportion of couples including
many who were well dressed and
middle aged.
I asked some of the people
waiting in line why they decided
to come see "Deep Throat." One
young man of about 25 replied, "I
read it in the newspaper. It was
thrown out in New York, so it
must be good. Just through the
newspaper, television and all that
good shit."
One well dressed middle aged
woman, accompanied by her
dapper-looking husband, said she
came "probably for the same
reason you did: curiosity."
She concluded with a giggle,
"Curiosity killed the cat and
satisfaction brought it back."

"There it is, you little bugger!"
Consolation
Linda was understandably
unhappy about having her clitoris
embedded (excuse the expression)
in the wrong orifice, and Dr.
Young tried to console her by
saying, "Miss Lovelace, having a
clitoris in the bottom of your
throat is better than having no
clitoris at all."
Linda answered, with a slight
whimper, "Suppose your balls
were in your ear?" to which Dr.
Young replied, "Then I could hear
myself coming!"
It all goes downhill from there,
and if that is the highlight, just
imagine what the rest of the flick
is like!
Anyway the shrink suggests
that Linda received sexual
stimulation by having her partners
take the plunge, as it were, all the
way down her throat. This is
where Linda's marvelous culinary
(no that's not an obscene word)
act goes into effect as the good
doctor wants to make sure she
understands his instructions.
Being a noble soul, he kindly
offers himself as her first meal.
The rest of the movie finds
Linda hired as Dr. Young's
"physiotherapist" and it needn't
be described what sort of
"physiotherapy" she gives Dr.
Young's suffering patients.
Remarkable Scene
There is one rather remarkable
scene in which both Linda and a
patient are both drinking Coke
through a plastic tube from a vial
of Coke stuck in Linda's vagina.
Hmm, maybe things do go better
with Coke ....
The movie is only 62 minutes

long, and much of the time is not
even devoted to the main plot,
perhaps rriercifully. The first ten
minutes simply show Linda
driving around what appears to be
southern California. The
landscape is the best scenery in
the entire movie. In addition,
there is this attempt at music
which sounds like a cow's
imitation of rock and roll.
Then there is a totally out of
place scene in which a lot of
strange people of both sexes are
doing all manner of odd things to
each other. What relation this
scene has to the plot at hand is
not quite apparent.
Maybe it is just stuck in there
to put us in the mood for things
to "come," so to speak. It does:
that scene is boring and so is the
rest of the movie.
Dull Flick
On the whole, then, "Deep
Throat" is very dull — not even as
exciting as a normal porno flick.
The scenes are as disjointed as
Linda's throat and the horrible
marching music that bombards
the viewer during most of the film
really grates after awhile.
At least the audience was
mercifully spared those miserably
fake "Oohs" and "Uhs" from the
screen which makes most of these
movies seem even phonier than
they are in the first place.
Why "Deep Throat" has
become the most successful skin
flick of all time escapes me
completely. The judge who
banned it in New York must not
have taken a very good look
around Times Square because
there are many skin flicks which
are far more explicit and sexually
exciting than this piece of trash.
The other film playing with
"Deep Throat," entitled "Teenage
Fantasies," is actually a little
better for porno buffs. It is more
typical of the standard skin flick,
depicting seven or eight orgasms
in people of various shapes and
sizes. Even so, it leaves a lot to be
desired since the bodies aren't
much to look at and the
exaggerated "Oohs" and "Uhs"
are a bit much to take as usual.
Packed Theater
At the 7 p.m. showing, the
theater was almost packed, but
there were a few empty seats. At
the 9:15 show, there were about

200 people waiting in line outside
the theater — most of whom were
turned away. Thus people are still
coming in droves to throw away
their money.
The crowd was noticeably
different from the normal porno
flick audience. There were
relatively few drunks, derelicts
and dirty old men, and a very high
proportion of couples including
many who were well dressed and
middle aged.
I asked some of the people
waiting in line why they decided
to come see "Deep Throat." One
young man of about 25 replied, "I
read it in the newspaper. It was
thrown out in New York, so it
must be good. Just through the
newspaper, television and all that
good shit."
One well dressed middle aged
woman, accompanied by her
dapper-looking husband, said she
came "probably for the same
reason you did: curiosity."
She concluded with a giggle,
"Curiosity killed the cat and
satisfaction brought it back."

OLIVER TWIST — Robert Newton (left) as Bill Sikes and Kay Walsh as Nancy in David Lean's production
of "Oliver Twist." This definitive screen adaptation of the classic English novel will be shown
uninterrupted on "Humanities Film Forum" tonight at 5 on Channel 9-KQED on the Public Broadcasting
Service.
"Deep Throat" is a simple
movie about a sweet girl who
happens to have her clitoris
lodged in her throat. (If you don't
know what's unusual about that,
let me refer you to Human Bio
10!)
This physical oddity causes her
to seek sexual satisfaction in
rather strange ways, and her
dining habits have attracted
millions of viewers from all
around the country. That's a
shame because "Deep Throat" is
not only a lousy movie, but it's
lousy pornography as well.
Most people who go to
sexually explicit movies don't
expect a good plot and good
acting, but they do at least expect
some erotic entertainment. "Deep
Throat" provides neither.
The movie stars a girl named
Linda Lovelace who does not, in
reality, have her clitoris in her
throat. What Linda does have,
however, is a remarkable ability —
akin to that of a sword swallower
— to take round, stiff objects deep
into her throat (guess where the
movie got its name) without
gagging, passing out, vomiting or
whatever. And those of you who
think she gets her kicks out of
swallowing candles are in for a big
surprise.
Simple Plot
The plot is not very complex.
Poor Linda confides in her best
friend that she just doesn't enjoy
sex. Linda says she thinks sex is
allright, but she wants to hear
"bells ringing and bombs going
off." Her friend thinks that
Linda's desire to hear "bombs
going off" means that she wants
to destroy cities or some such
nonsense, and sends Linda off to
see a shrink named Dr. Young.
Dr. Young astutely decides

that Linda's problem might be
more "physical" than
"psychological," and calls for an
"internal" examination.
During the only
semi-humorous scene (depending
on your taste for sick jokes) in the
entire movie, Dr. Young, in search
of Linda's problem, suddenly
exclaimed, "Miss Lovelace, you
don't have one!"
Linda replied, "I'm a woman:
I'm not supposed to have one."
After it was determined that
Dr. Young was referring to
Linda's clitoris and not her
favorite food, the good doctor
opened Linda's mouth and cried,
"There it is, you little bugger!"
Consolation
Linda was understandably
unhappy about having her clitoris
embedded (excuse the expression)
in the wrong orifice, and Dr.
Young tried to console her by
saying, "Miss Lovelace, having a

Dull Flick
On the whole, then, "Deep
Throat" is very dull — not even as
exciting as a normal porno flick.
The scenes are as disjointed as
Linda's throat and the horrible
marching music that bombards
the viewer during most of the film
really grates after awhile.
At least the audience was
mercifully spared those miserably
fake "Oohs" and "Uhs" from the
screen which makes most of these
movies seem even phonier than
they are in the first place.
Why "Deep Throat" has
become the most successful skin
flick of all time escapes me
completely. The judge who
banned it in New York must not
have taken a very good look
around Times Square because
there are many skin flicks which
are far more explicit and sexually
exciting than this piece of trash.
The other film playing with
"Deep Throat," entitled "Teenage
Fantasies," is actually a little
better for porno buffs. It is more
typical of the standard skin flick,
depicting seven or eight orgasms
in people of various shapes and
sizes. Even so, it leaves a lot to be
desired since the bodies aren't
much to look at and the
exaggerated "Oohs" and "Uhs"
are a bit much to take as usual.
Packed Theater
At the 7 p.m. showing, the
theater was almost packed, but
there were a few empty seats. At
the 9:15 show, there were about

200 people waiting in line outside
the theater — most of whom were
turned away. Thus people are still
coming in droves to throw away
their money.
The crowd was noticeably
different from the normal porno
flick audience. There were
relatively few drunks, derelicts
and dirty old men, and a very high
proportion of couples including
many who were well dressed and
middle aged.
I asked some of the people
waiting in line why they decided
to come see "Deep Throat." One
young man of about 25 replied, "I
read it in the newspaper. It was
thrown out in New York, so it
must be good. Just through the
newspaper, television and all that
good shit."
One well dressed middle aged
woman, accompanied by her
dapper-looking husband, said she
came "probably for the same
reason you did: curiosity."
She concluded with a giggle,
"Curiosity killed the cat and
satisfaction brought it back."

OLIVER TWIST — Robert Newton (left) as Bill Sikes and Kay Walsh as Nancy in David Lean's production
of "Oliver Twist." This definitive screen adaptation of the classic English novel will be shown
uninterrupted on "Humanities Film Forum" tonight at 5 on Channel 9-KQED on the Public Broadcasting
Service.
"Deep Throat" is a simple
movie about a sweet girl who
happens to have her clitoris
lodged in her throat. (If you don't
know what's unusual about that,
let me refer you to Human Bio
10!)
This physical oddity causes her
to seek sexual satisfaction in
rather strange ways, and her
dining habits have attracted
millions of viewers from all
around the country. That's a
shame because "Deep Throat" is
not only a lousy movie, but it's
lousy pornography as well.
Most people who go to
sexually explicit movies don't
expect a good plot and good
acting, but they do at least expect
some erotic entertainment. "Deep
Throat" provides neither.
The movie stars a girl named
Linda Lovelace who does not, in
reality, have her clitoris in her
throat. What Linda does have,
however, is a remarkable ability —
akin to that of a sword swallower
— to take round, stiff objects deep
into her throat (guess where the
movie got its name) without
gagging, passing out, vomiting or
whatever. And those of you who
think she gets her kicks out of
swallowing candles are in for a big
surprise.
Simple Plot
The plot is not very complex.
Poor Linda confides in her best
friend that she just doesn't enjoy
sex. Linda says she thinks sex is
allright, but she wants to hear
"bells ringing and bombs going
off." Her friend thinks that
Linda's desire to hear "bombs
going off" means that she wants
to destroy cities or some such
nonsense, and sends Linda off to
see a shrink named Dr. Young.
Dr. Young astutely decides

that Linda's problem might be
more "physical" than
"psychological," and calls for an
"internal" examination.
During the only
semi-humorous scene (depending
on your taste for sick jokes) in the
entire movie, Dr. Young, in search
of Linda's problem, suddenly
exclaimed, "Miss Lovelace, you
don't have one!"
Linda replied, "I'm a woman:
I'm not supposed to have one."
After it was determined that
Dr. Young was referring to
Linda's clitoris and not her
favorite food, the good doctor
opened Linda's mouth and cried,
"There it is, you little bugger!"
Consolation
Linda was understandably
unhappy about having her clitoris
embedded (excuse the expression)
in the wrong orifice, and Dr.
Young tried to console her by
saying, "Miss Lovelace, having a
clitoris in the bottom of your
throat is better than having no
clitoris at all."
Linda answered, with a slight
whimper, "Suppose your balls
were in your ear?" to which Dr.
Young replied, "Then I could hear
myself coming!"
It all goes downhill from there,
and if that is the highlight, just
imagine what the rest of the flick
is like!
Anyway the shrink suggests
that Linda received sexual
stimulation by having her partners
take the plunge, as it were, all the
way down her throat. This is
where Linda's marvelous culinary
(no that's not an obscene word)
act goes into effect as the good
doctor wants to make sure she
understands his instructions.
Being a noble soul, he kindly
offers himself as her first meal.
The rest of the movie finds
Linda hired as Dr. Young's
"physiotherapist" and it needn't
be described what sort of
"physiotherapy" she gives Dr.
Young's suffering patients.
Remarkable Scene
There is one rather remarkable
scene in which both Linda and a
patient are both drinking Coke
through a plastic tube from a vial
of Coke stuck in Linda's vagina.
Hmm, maybe things do go better
with Coke ....
The movie is only 62 minutes

long, and much of the time is not
even devoted to the main plot,
perhaps rriercifully. The first ten
minutes simply show Linda
driving around what appears to be
southern California. The
landscape is the best scenery in
the entire movie. In addition,
there is this attempt at music
which sounds like a cow's
imitation of rock and roll.
Then there is a totally out of
place scene in which a lot of
strange people of both sexes are
doing all manner of odd things to
each other. What relation this
scene has to the plot at hand is
not quite apparent.
Maybe it is just stuck in there
to put us in the mood for things
to "come," so to speak. It does:
that scene is boring and so is the
rest of the movie.

OLIVER TWIST — Robert Newton (left) as Bill Sikes and Kay Walsh as Nancy in David Lean's production
of "Oliver Twist." This definitive screen adaptation of the classic English novel will be shown
uninterrupted on "Humanities Film Forum" tonight at 5 on Channel 9-KQED on the Public Broadcasting
Service.
"Deep Throat" is a simple
movie about a sweet girl who
happens to have her clitoris
lodged in her throat. (If you don't
know what's unusual about that,
let me refer you to Human Bio
10!)
This physical oddity causes her
to seek sexual satisfaction in
rather strange ways, and her
dining habits have attracted
millions of viewers from all
around the country. That's a
shame because "Deep Throat" is
not only a lousy movie, but it's
lousy pornography as well.
Most people who go to
sexually explicit movies don't
expect a good plot and good
acting, but they do at least expect
some erotic entertainment. "Deep
Throat" provides neither.
The movie stars a girl named
Linda Lovelace who does not, in
reality, have her clitoris in her
throat. What Linda does have,
however, is a remarkable ability —
akin to that of a sword swallower
— to take round, stiff objects deep
into her throat (guess where the
movie got its name) without
gagging, passing out, vomiting or
whatever. And those of you who
think she gets her kicks out of
swallowing candles are in for a big
surprise.
Simple Plot
The plot is not very complex.
Poor Linda confides in her best
friend that she just doesn't enjoy
sex. Linda says she thinks sex is
allright, but she wants to hear
"bells ringing and bombs going
off." Her friend thinks that
Linda's desire to hear "bombs
going off" means that she wants
to destroy cities or some such
nonsense, and sends Linda off to
see a shrink named Dr. Young.
Dr. Young astutely decides

that Linda's problem might be
more "physical" than
"psychological," and calls for an
"internal" examination.
During the only
semi-humorous scene (depending
on your taste for sick jokes) in the
entire movie, Dr. Young, in search
of Linda's problem, suddenly
exclaimed, "Miss Lovelace, you
don't have one!"
Linda replied, "I'm a woman:
I'm not supposed to have one."
After it was determined that
Dr. Young was referring to
Linda's clitoris and not her
favorite food, the good doctor
opened Linda's mouth and cried,
"There it is, you little bugger!"
Consolation
Linda was understandably
unhappy about having her clitoris
embedded (excuse the expression)
in the wrong orifice, and Dr.
Young tried to console her by
saying, "Miss Lovelace, having a
clitoris in the bottom of your
throat is better than having no
clitoris at all."
Linda answered, with a slight
whimper, "Suppose your balls
were in your ear?" to which Dr.
Young replied, "Then I could hear
myself coming!"
It all goes downhill from there,
and if that is the highlight, just
imagine what the rest of the flick
is like!
Anyway the shrink suggests
that Linda received sexual
stimulation by having her partners
take the plunge, as it were, all the
way down her throat. This is
where Linda's marvelous culinary
(no that's not an obscene word)
act goes into effect as the good
doctor wants to make sure she
understands his instructions.
Being a noble soul, he kindly
offers himself as her first meal.
The rest of the movie finds
Linda hired as Dr. Young's
"physiotherapist" and it needn't
be described what sort of
"physiotherapy" she gives Dr.
Young's suffering patients.
Remarkable Scene
There is one rather remarkable
scene in which both Linda and a
patient are both drinking Coke
through a plastic tube from a vial
of Coke stuck in Linda's vagina.
Hmm, maybe things do go better
with Coke ....
The movie is only 62 minutes

long, and much of the time is not
even devoted to the main plot,
perhaps rriercifully. The first ten
minutes simply show Linda
driving around what appears to be
southern California. The
landscape is the best scenery in
the entire movie. In addition,
there is this attempt at music
which sounds like a cow's
imitation of rock and roll.
Then there is a totally out of
place scene in which a lot of
strange people of both sexes are
doing all manner of odd things to
each other. What relation this
scene has to the plot at hand is
not quite apparent.
Maybe it is just stuck in there
to put us in the mood for things
to "come," so to speak. It does:
that scene is boring and so is the
rest of the movie.
Dull Flick
On the whole, then, "Deep
Throat" is very dull — not even as
exciting as a normal porno flick.
The scenes are as disjointed as
Linda's throat and the horrible
marching music that bombards
the viewer during most of the film
really grates after awhile.
At least the audience was
mercifully spared those miserably
fake "Oohs" and "Uhs" from the
screen which makes most of these
movies seem even phonier than
they are in the first place.
Why "Deep Throat" has
become the most successful skin
flick of all time escapes me
completely. The judge who
banned it in New York must not
have taken a very good look
around Times Square because
there are many skin flicks which
are far more explicit and sexually
exciting than this piece of trash.
The other film playing with
"Deep Throat," entitled "Teenage
Fantasies," is actually a little
better for porno buffs. It is more
typical of the standard skin flick,
depicting seven or eight orgasms
in people of various shapes and
sizes. Even so, it leaves a lot to be
desired since the bodies aren't
much to look at and the
exaggerated "Oohs" and "Uhs"
are a bit much to take as usual.
Packed Theater
At the 7 p.m. showing, the
theater was almost packed, but
there were a few empty seats. At
the 9:15 show, there were about

200 people waiting in line outside
the theater — most of whom were
turned away. Thus people are still
coming in droves to throw away
their money.
The crowd was noticeably
different from the normal porno
flick audience. There were
relatively few drunks, derelicts
and dirty old men, and a very high
proportion of couples including
many who were well dressed and
middle aged.
I asked some of the people
waiting in line why they decided
to come see "Deep Throat." One
young man of about 25 replied, "I
read it in the newspaper. It was
thrown out in New York, so it
must be good. Just through the
newspaper, television and all that
good shit."
One well dressed middle aged
woman, accompanied by her
dapper-looking husband, said she
came "probably for the same
reason you did: curiosity."
She concluded with a giggle,
"Curiosity killed the cat and
satisfaction brought it back."
