# Political Cabaret Coming Up
## 
### 
Alea II will present
"Kabar-alea," an evening of
political cabaret by Bertolt
Brecht, Kurt Weill, and Hanns
Eisler, at 8 p.m. Saturday, April
28, in the Women's Clubhouse.
Admission is free.
"Kabar-alea" features a
con troversril Brecht Weill opera,
"Der Jasager," plus cabaret songs
with words by Brecht and music
by Eisler.
Alea 11, Stanford's ensemble
for new music, is directed in this
special production by Martin
Bresnick.
"Der Jasager" ("the
yes-sayer"), first performed in
Berlin in 1930, was Brecht's
strongest political statement up to
that time and his first work to
combine Marxism with Oriental
theater. The opera is based on a
Japanese IVIo play, "Taniko."
The new opera caused a
sensation in the inflammable
Germany of the Weimar period. It
was widely performed, and its
concepts were imitated by
Hindemith, Fortner, Orff and
others.
Although Brecht's art was
more and more revolutionary in

intent, it was the style, not the
politics of "Der Jasager" that
inspired Fortner's "Cress
Ertrinkt" and other imitations.
Weill had collaborated with
Brecht for years with increasing
popular success, composing
"Threepenny Opera" in 1928 and
"Mahagonny" in 1929. For "Der
Jasager" he took pains to write
even more simply than before,
with great concern for clarity of
the text and ease of performance.
The music has Weill's
characteristic melodiousness,
subtle harmonies, and simplicity
of rhythm.

Alea II has expanded for this
production to include a number
of signers and a cabaret band as
well as a small chorus and
orchestra, conducted by Jason
Klein.
The cast of "Der Jasager"
includes Carole Klein, Judith
Malafronte, Constance McKee,
Jane Sugarman, Anthony
Antolini, and Jan Morgan.
Performing in the cabaret band
are Joyce Johnson, trumpet;
Arthur Barnes, piano; Michael
Stillman, saxophone; Tuck
Andress, guitar; Tom Graf, bass;
and Jason Paras, banjo.
