# Down With Franchise Food!
## 
### LYNNE STEINBACH 
The place is El Camino. The
time is 1973. The person is you.
Now that I've gotten you
involved personally, I pose you
with a question. Have you ever
been driving with some friends
and there is a unanimous decision
to go somewhere to eat, and the
place where you end up is
Mac Donald's, Taco Bell, Jack in
the Box or other establishments
like these that look as if they were
machine-stamped out of the
ground, trimmed with artificial
grass and plastic plants, and
crowned with an American flag?
And that's just appearance. The
food, I daresay, provides a similar
situation for the palate.
Now why are so many of us,
young and old, continually
chosing these places to tickle our
taste buds? Surely most
Stanfordites have been to
Mac Donald's, which is just the
same as the one down their block
at home, which might be 3,000
miles away, while many cannot
claim to have tried some of the
more personalized inexpensive
restaurants on Castro Streets or
elsewhere.
Pop Culture
What I am trying to get across
is that this is a prime example of
the pop culture we are
consciously and unconsciously
making our life style. It is
irrelevant to label it a good or bad
thing. Some might consider it a
step along the path of progress.
Others might see it as a movement
in the direction of a "Brave New
World." But despite opinion, we
can definitely get a lot of insight
from pointing out some of these
trends, laughing and nodding our
heads along the way.
First off, we say it's cheap.
This is true, there's no tip to pay,

and you can come out with a
pretty inexpensive meal. But what
do you get? Just what you payed
for. Most customers would
probably prefer not to know the
content of their burrito or the
grade of meat used for a Big Mac,
or for that matter, what's in the
milkshake. The food has managed
to taste OK. "Nothing
spectacular, but if you're
hungry," is one of the comments
often heard. If someone was
aiming for a cheap meal he might
do better going to a delicatessen
and assembling his own meal. But,
oh, for the sake of convenience!!
Pollution
Next, we should consider the
garbage. The pop culture of
processing food in packages that
appeal to the consumer has
certainly caught on. There are
always a million garbage cans
surrounding the building and
parking lots at Mac Donald's, but
once you drive away, you find
yourself stuck with a dozen
different paper and and cardboard
thingies.
What are you to do? These,
places are definitely not with it'
ecologically, and there is really no
excuse for wasting so much paper.
Ralph Nader, Paul Ehrlich, where,
are you?
Perhaps anonymity really
appeals to us, for we are definitely
a number as soon as we drive into
the restaurant parking lot. The
whole atmosphere is impersonal.
One consolation is that there are
no waiters staring at you
throughout the meal as you slurp
up your soup or drop some peas
from your fork (Oops, try again!).
Yes, quickness is even catching
on way out west (contrary to
what some East Coasters might
think), and is yet another
characteristic of the new franchise

restaurants. You are perfectly
justified in saying "I was in a
hurry." It's a sure thing that
anyone who walks in will come
out again in no time. There are
ten hamburgers lined up in a row
and ten more waiting where they
came from.
If, by George, you do have to
wait a few seconds longer, it's
always fun to play the game of
which line will move fastest and,
indeed, there are lots of kicks to
be gotten out of watching the
personnel slop something together
in the kitchen (though maybe you
really don't want to see that.)
And to think that the "Think
tank" is behind it all. Yes, anyone
who still has any of the kidstuff in
'em would find this little room a
haven. This is the circular room
located somewhere on the top of
a skyscraper in Chicago where all
the thinkers behind Mac Donald's
sales go to get innovative ideas.
The public gets bored, they
need entertainment, novelty, so
give it to them . .. and this is
where it all begins. If you've read

Time recently, you will know
about this place.
Ideas
The object is to come up with
ideas in any way possible. This
might include lying on the circular
water bed, listening to
quadrophonic sound, twiddling
your thumbs in private, and a
whole bunch of other possibilities.
It's very condescending to the
public when a company like this
feels that they have to get ideas
this way.
I've seen Kentucky Fried
Chickens in England, and am
almost positive Mac Donald's has
plopped roots in Europe and
other parts of the world, so the
franchised eating spot is certainly
a spreading phenomenon, not
confined to our own culture.
Perhaps in a few decades the
hamburger and fishwich will be
the only foods known, and more
people will be content because
they won't have any home-cooked
or smaller restaurant meals to
compare it with. Until that day,
please take me somewhere else.
