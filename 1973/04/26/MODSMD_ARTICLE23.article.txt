Haldeman Status Change?
WASHINGTON — H.R. Haldeman no longer
presides at regular early morning meetings of senior
presidential aides, but a spokesman insisted
yesterday his status as White House chief of staff is
unchanged.
The regular daily meetings, which had been held
since President Nixon took office, were ended two
or three weeks ago, press secretary Ronald L.
Ziegler said in response to questions.
But Ziegler quickly addied that the change in
procedure isn't related to the Watergate scandal or
Haldeman's possible involvement.
Haldeman had presided over the daily sessions
attended by such Nixon aides as John Ehrlichman,
Ziegler, Roy Ash, and George Shultz.
Ziegler said the change in procedure came
because it was decided "we could be more
productive ... by meeting with individual members
of the staff and with department heads in separate
meetings."
During yesterday's hour-long news briefing,
Ziegler was asked about Nixon's mood as he pursues
the Watergate investigation.
"He is very much concentrating on this
matter. ... He is a man at work," Ziegler
responded.
When asked whether Nixon was angry, outraged,
or saddened by the major new developments he
reported last week, Ziegler said he was "not
prepared to project that type of feeling on the part
of the President."
"I have seen the President involved in a number
of difficult situations in the four and one-half years
he's been in office and in each of these periods I
have not detected ... a change of mood as such,"
Ziegler said.
Slayer Waives Extradition
PUEBLO, Colo. — Edmund Emil Kemper 111, who a
prosecutor said "felt he was on the verge of going
on another killing spree and wanted to be stopped"
when he telephoned police to tell of eight murders,
waived extradition to California yesterday.
Kemper is en route under guard to Santa Cruz,
Calif., where he is expected to arrive Friday,
authorities said. He is traveling by car.
Clad in washed-out blue jeans and a plaid sports
shirt, the hulking 6-9, 280-pounder Kemper
appeared in Pueblo District Court and signed six
copies of a form waiving his right to a hearing on
California's request to return him there.
"He felt he was on the verge of going on another
killing spree and wanted to be stopped," said Dist.
Atty. Peter Chang, here to return Kemper to
California.
Kemper, who was committed to a mental
hospital at 15 in the killing of his grandparents,
stopped at a telephone booth Tuesday near a
freeway here, telephoned 1,200 miles to Santa
Cruze police to tell them of the killing of his mother
and her woman friend and th killings of six coeds in
the Santa Cruz coastal areas.

The girl disappeared last Sept. 14, police said.
She was last seen waiting for a bus to take her to
ballet class in San Francisco.
Haig Challenges 'Papers' Defense
LOS ANGELES — The vice chief of staff of the
Army, Gen. Alexander Haig, describing himself as
one-time "alter ego" to Henry Kissinger, testified at
the Pentagon Papers trial yesterday and challenged
the credibility of two defense witnesses.
Haig, lately an Asian trouble-shooter for
President Nixon, was the highest-ranking military
man to take the witness stand for the government
and the first to appear in full military uniform with
decorations. He was summoned as the eighth
rebuttal witness against Daniel Ellsberg and
Anthony Russo.
His testimony was followed by an encounter
with Russo on the front steps of the courthouse
during which Russo shouted at Haig and Haig's
military aide threw back a copy of the Pentagon
Papers which Russo tried to give the general.
The aim of Haig's brief testimony was to show
that two defense witnesses—former Defense
Department official Morton Halperin and
intelligence analyst Allen S. Whiting—were not as
close to the heart of government decision-making as
they had indicated.
However, on cross examination, Haig conceded
that he does not know Whiting by sight and that
Halperin did have senior responsibility for the
National Security Council staff in 1969.
The two witnesses had testified that the
Pentagon Papers study of the Vietnam war was
useless to an enemy by the time Ellsberg and Russo
copied it in 1969. The defendants are charged with
espionage, conspiracy and theft for the copying.
Agnew 'Confident' In Nixon
WASHINGTON — Vice President Spiro T. Agnew,
who has been described as "appalled" by the
administration's handling of the Watergate affair,
said yesterday he has full confidence in President
Nixon's integrity and his ability to resole the case.
At a hastily scheduled news conference, Agnew
simply read a prepared statement, then declined to
answer newsmen's questions.
"I want to make it very clear that I have full
confidence in the integrity of President Nixon and
in his determination and ability to resolve the
Watergate matter to the full satisfaction of the
American people," Agnew said.
Earlier yesterday it was announced that Nixon's
top staff members have ceased their regular morning
meetings. White House press secretary Ronald
Ziegler said the change, ending a routine that had
prevailed since the start of Nixon's first term, took
place two or three weeks ago. But he said it isn't
related to charges that some top staff members are
involved in the wiretapping or attempts to cover it
up.
He also said no staff member has submitted a
resignation because of the affair, and said H.R.

Haldeman retains his spot as presidential chief of
staff. Haldeman didn't accompany Nixon to Florida
on a recently completed working holiday.
News reports had quoted associates and friends
of Agnew as saying the vice president was upset over
the affair and felt the President had done too little
to uncover the facts.
Floods Sweep Midwest
ST. LOUIS — Torrential spring rains have swollen
the mighty Mississippi River to some of its highest
levels in recorded history and created a 1,500-mile
stretch of soggy farmland and flooded homes.
Thousands of families from just below the Great
Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico have been forced to
flee their homes, millions of acres of rich farmland
are fit for nothing more than rice paddies and
damage estimates grow by the millions of dollars
each day.
The National Weather Service says the higest
crest in some 200 years of record-keeping here —
43.5 feet, or 13.5 feet above flood stage — is
expected sometime Saturday. The record crest had
been predicted for Thursday, but a spokesman said
breaks in upriver levees drained off some of the
rushing water and delayed the crest.
Illinois Gov. Daniel Walker on Wednesday
estimated damage to his state alone at $50 million
and officials set a similar figure for the damage in
Missouri.
On the other end of the river system, Mississippi
River Commission officials estimated damage to
Louisiana and Mississippi at well over $100 million.
The current flood situation is the second
onslaught of the Mississippi and its tributaries this
spinrg, and officials say only the elaborate system of
levees has prevented the flooding from producing
even greater disasters in property damage and loss of
human life.
Committee Faked Nixon Support?
LOS ANGELES — A former worker in President
Nixon's re-election campaign in California said
yesterday he witnessed fellow workers
soliciting—and in some cases making up—telegrams
to send the White House supporting Nixon's
decision to mine Haiphong harbor.
"I watched as those at GOP headquarters called
other campaign workers, friends, acquaintances,
asking permission to use their names on telegrams,"
said Larry Carroll, now a reporter for KABC-TV
here.
"In many cases, when people could not be
reached by phone, telegrams were sent out under
their names anyway.
Fair Tomorrow!
Fair through Friday except night and mornings low
clouds or fog along the coast extending inland
locally late night and mornings. Slightly cooler days.
Low tonight in mid 40s to mid 50s. Highs today and
tomorrow from upper 50s near coast to the low 70s
inland. Westerly wind 10 to 20 mph in afternoons.
