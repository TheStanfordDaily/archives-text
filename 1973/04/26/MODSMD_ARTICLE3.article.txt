# Phi Delt Rush Raffle Features Naked Girl

### GLENN GARVIN 
Stanford fraternity Phi Delta Theta
is under investigation by University
officials after a stripper was raffled off
at the house Friday night during a rush
party.
"I'm shocked and dismayed," Larry
Horton, associate dean of student
affairs, told the Daily yesterday.
"There's really nothing we can say
except that we're going to look into
it."
Horton said last night that he had
assigned Norman Robinson, director
of fraternities, to investigate the
incident. Robinson indicated it would
be several days before he could
prepare a report.
The stripper, imported from
Sunnyvale for the party, danced nude
for awhile before her escort suggested
that the fraternity raffle her off.
Master of ceremomies Mark Davis, a
frat member who no longer lives in the
house, tore a deck of cards in half and
began selling them as tickets at $1 a
throw.
Non-Explicit
"It was never said explicitly that
this girl was a whore and you could do
what you want with her, but it was
just sort of assumed," one girl who
attended the party told the Daily.
"She wasn't getting $53 so people
could talk with her."
The winner was a prep school
junior from Dallas visiting Stanford
who bought five tickets. "It took him
a while to sort through them, and then
he just held up his arms like an
imitation of Cassius Clay," the girl
said.
Fraternity members yesterday
denied that any wrong-doing took
place at the party. Phi Delt president
Bob Major said no sexual activity took
place between the stripper, identified
only as Debbie, and the raffle winner.
"They went into a room, but they
were in there just a very short time,
just a minute or two. They both said
nothing went on," Major claimed.
"The guy had a girlfriend in Texas."
Major told the Palo Alto Times
yesterday he didn't have any idea who
the winner was or where he was from.
Wild
Emcee Davis was quoted yesterday
in the San Jose Mercury as saying the
party was the wildest ever held here,
but he claimed the paper misquoted
him. "I said it was the wildest party
we (the Phi Delts) ever had," Davis
said. "What he meant is that we've
never had somebody come in and ask
us to raffle off a girl before," Major
added.
"I think the University understands

it was not anything premeditated. And
the house took no money out of it, it
all went to the girl," Major said. "A
strip revue is a standard function in
all houses. I don't think the Phi Delts
should get the reputation of some sort
of animal house."
