# Phi Delt Rush Raffle Features Naked Girl

### GLENN GARVIN 
Stanford fraternity Phi Delta Theta
is under investigation by University
officials after a stripper was raffled off
at the house Friday night during a rush
party.
"I'm shocked and dismayed," Larry
Horton, associate dean of student
affairs, told the Daily yesterday.
"There's really nothing we can say
except that we're going to look into
it."
Horton said last night that he had
assigned Norman Robinson, director
of fraternities, to investigate the
incident. Robinson indicated it would
be several days before he could
prepare a report.
The stripper, imported from
Sunnyvale for the party, danced nude
for awhile before her escort suggested
that the fraternity raffle her off.
Master of ceremomies Mark Davis, a
frat member who no longer lives in the
house, tore a deck of cards in half and
began selling them as tickets at $1 a
throw.
Non-Explicit
"It was never said explicitly that
this girl was a whore and you could do
what you want with her, but it was
just sort of assumed," one girl who
attended the party told the Daily.
"She wasn't getting $53 so people
could talk with her."
The winner was a prep school
junior from Dallas visiting Stanford
who bought five tickets. "It took him
a while to sort through them, and then
he just held up his arms like an
imitation of Cassius Clay," the girl
said.
Fraternity members yesterday
denied that any wrong-doing took
place at the party. Phi Delt president
Bob Major said no sexual activity took
place between the stripper, identified
only as Debbie, and the raffle winner.
"They went into a room, but they
were in there just a very short time,
just a minute or two. They both said
nothing went on," Major claimed.
"The guy had a girlfriend in Texas."
Major told the Palo Alto Times
yesterday he didn't have any idea who
the winner was or where he was from.
Wild
Emcee Davis was quoted yesterday
in the San Jose Mercury as saying the
party was the wildest ever held here,
but he claimed the paper misquoted
him. "I said it was the wildest party
we (the Phi Delts) ever had," Davis
said. "What he meant is that we've
never had somebody come in and ask
us to raffle off a girl before," Major
added.
"I think the University understands

it was not anything premeditated. And
the house took no money out of it, it
all went to the girl," Major said. "A
strip revue is a standard function in
all houses. I don't think the Phi Delts
should get the reputation of some sort
of animal house."
Fraternity sources told the Daily
last night the Phi Delts held a similar
raffle last year among house members
attending a San Francisco Giant
baseball game. The winner was
presented with keys to a motel room
containing a prostitute.
"I don't know anything about that,
and it certainly is not a house
tradition," Major said yesterday."The
worst we can be accused of is putting
on something in bad taste."
Banned In 1966
Phi Delta Theta was banned from
the campus for a year in November,
1966 after a series of incidents
including a party attended by girls
from Mills College where frat members
hid in trees and urinated on the
women. One girl was assaulted by
several naked men, and another was
bitten on the chest at the party.
In addition, the frat membersstole
11,000 copies of the Daily one
morning, and a member was accused
of firing a rifle at a passer-by near the
house.
The previous suspension will not
count against the fraternity, Robinson
said. "It was so far back that it
wouldn't come into play. A whole new
group of people are here now."
'Outrageous'
Robinson said Major had confirmed
"the essence of the story" to him. "If
the facts are as they appear, I do think

the whole chain of events is somewhat
outrageous."
Presidential staff counsel Gerald
Halligan said he was "cogitating" on
the matter but added that he didn't
plan any campus judicial action until
he saw Robinson's report. He also
indicated it was University policy to
turn over any evidence of illegal
activity to the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's office.
A spokesman for the Santa Clara
County District Attorney's office said
the county wasn't planning any legal
action against the fraternity.
Five nude dancers appeared at the
party Friday night, attended by about
250. A bar operated throughout the
party, although according to Major
"there weren't very many drunks and
it was very orderly."
The first dancer was greeted by
jeers and catcalls, and left pretty
quickly. "She looked like she had had
about three kids," observed one coed
who attended the party.
Each of the next three dancers
invited men up onto the stage. "The
first guy just stripped down to his
shorts, but the girls undressed the
others and they danced naked," the
girl said. "When the girls were dancing
it was rather unerotic ... I was
surprised.
'The guys were much more
suggestive than the girls, but the girls
kept them from getting out of hand."

of fraternities, to investigate the
incident. Robinson indicated it would
be several days before he could
prepare a report.
The stripper, imported from
Sunnyvale for the party, danced nude
for awhile before her escort suggested
that the fraternity raffle her off.
Master of ceremomies Mark Davis, a
frat member who no longer lives in the
house, tore a deck of cards in half and
began selling them as tickets at $1 a
throw.
Non-Explicit
"It was never said explicitly that
this girl was a whore and you could do
what you want with her, but it was
just sort of assumed," one girl who
attended the party told the Daily.
"She wasn't getting $53 so people
could talk with her."
The winner was a prep school
junior from Dallas visiting Stanford
who bought five tickets. "It took him
a while to sort through them, and then
he just held up his arms like an
imitation of Cassius Clay," the girl
said.
Fraternity members yesterday
denied that any wrong-doing took
place at the party. Phi Delt president
Bob Major said no sexual activity took
place between the stripper, identified
only as Debbie, and the raffle winner.
"They went into a room, but they
were in there just a very short time,
just a minute or two. They both said
nothing went on," Major claimed.
"The guy had a girlfriend in Texas."
Major told the Palo Alto Times
yesterday he didn't have any idea who
the winner was or where he was from.
Wild
Emcee Davis was quoted yesterday
in the San Jose Mercury as saying the
party was the wildest ever held here,
but he claimed the paper misquoted
him. "I said it was the wildest party
we (the Phi Delts) ever had," Davis
said. "What he meant is that we've
never had somebody come in and ask
us to raffle off a girl before," Major
added.
"I think the University understands

it was not anything premeditated. And
the house took no money out of it, it
all went to the girl," Major said. "A
strip revue is a standard function in
all houses. I don't think the Phi Delts
should get the reputation of some sort
of animal house."
Fraternity sources told the Daily
last night the Phi Delts held a similar
raffle last year among house members
attending a San Francisco Giant
baseball game. The winner was
presented with keys to a motel room
containing a prostitute.
"I don't know anything about that,
and it certainly is not a house
tradition," Major said yesterday."The
worst we can be accused of is putting
on something in bad taste."
Banned In 1966
Phi Delta Theta was banned from
the campus for a year in November,
1966 after a series of incidents
including a party attended by girls
from Mills College where frat members
hid in trees and urinated on the
women. One girl was assaulted by
several naked men, and another was
bitten on the chest at the party.
In addition, the frat membersstole
11,000 copies of the Daily one
morning, and a member was accused
of firing a rifle at a passer-by near the
house.
The previous suspension will not
count against the fraternity, Robinson
said. "It was so far back that it
wouldn't come into play. A whole new
group of people are here now."
'Outrageous'
Robinson said Major had confirmed
"the essence of the story" to him. "If
the facts are as they appear, I do think

the whole chain of events is somewhat
outrageous."
Presidential staff counsel Gerald
Halligan said he was "cogitating" on
the matter but added that he didn't
plan any campus judicial action until
he saw Robinson's report. He also
indicated it was University policy to
turn over any evidence of illegal
activity to the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's office.
A spokesman for the Santa Clara
County District Attorney's office said
the county wasn't planning any legal
action against the fraternity.
Five nude dancers appeared at the
party Friday night, attended by about
250. A bar operated throughout the
party, although according to Major
"there weren't very many drunks and
it was very orderly."
The first dancer was greeted by
jeers and catcalls, and left pretty
quickly. "She looked like she had had
about three kids," observed one coed
who attended the party.
Each of the next three dancers
invited men up onto the stage. "The
first guy just stripped down to his
shorts, but the girls undressed the
others and they danced naked," the
girl said. "When the girls were dancing
it was rather unerotic ... I was
surprised.
'The guys were much more
suggestive than the girls, but the girls
kept them from getting out of hand."

Non-Explicit
"It was never said explicitly that
this girl was a whore and you could do
what you want with her, but it was
just sort of assumed," one girl who
attended the party told the Daily.
"She wasn't getting $53 so people
could talk with her."
The winner was a prep school
junior from Dallas visiting Stanford
who bought five tickets. "It took him
a while to sort through them, and then
he just held up his arms like an
imitation of Cassius Clay," the girl
said.
Fraternity members yesterday
denied that any wrong-doing took
place at the party. Phi Delt president
Bob Major said no sexual activity took
place between the stripper, identified
only as Debbie, and the raffle winner.
"They went into a room, but they
were in there just a very short time,
just a minute or two. They both said
nothing went on," Major claimed.
"The guy had a girlfriend in Texas."
Major told the Palo Alto Times
yesterday he didn't have any idea who
the winner was or where he was from.
Wild
Emcee Davis was quoted yesterday
in the San Jose Mercury as saying the
party was the wildest ever held here,
but he claimed the paper misquoted
him. "I said it was the wildest party
we (the Phi Delts) ever had," Davis
said. "What he meant is that we've
never had somebody come in and ask
us to raffle off a girl before," Major
added.
"I think the University understands

it was not anything premeditated. And
the house took no money out of it, it
all went to the girl," Major said. "A
strip revue is a standard function in
all houses. I don't think the Phi Delts
should get the reputation of some sort
of animal house."
Fraternity sources told the Daily
last night the Phi Delts held a similar
raffle last year among house members
attending a San Francisco Giant
baseball game. The winner was
presented with keys to a motel room
containing a prostitute.
"I don't know anything about that,
and it certainly is not a house
tradition," Major said yesterday."The
worst we can be accused of is putting
on something in bad taste."
Banned In 1966
Phi Delta Theta was banned from
the campus for a year in November,
1966 after a series of incidents
including a party attended by girls
from Mills College where frat members
hid in trees and urinated on the
women. One girl was assaulted by
several naked men, and another was
bitten on the chest at the party.
In addition, the frat membersstole
11,000 copies of the Daily one
morning, and a member was accused
of firing a rifle at a passer-by near the
house.
The previous suspension will not
count against the fraternity, Robinson
said. "It was so far back that it
wouldn't come into play. A whole new
group of people are here now."
'Outrageous'
Robinson said Major had confirmed
"the essence of the story" to him. "If
the facts are as they appear, I do think

the whole chain of events is somewhat
outrageous."
Presidential staff counsel Gerald
Halligan said he was "cogitating" on
the matter but added that he didn't
plan any campus judicial action until
he saw Robinson's report. He also
indicated it was University policy to
turn over any evidence of illegal
activity to the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's office.
A spokesman for the Santa Clara
County District Attorney's office said
the county wasn't planning any legal
action against the fraternity.
Five nude dancers appeared at the
party Friday night, attended by about
250. A bar operated throughout the
party, although according to Major
"there weren't very many drunks and
it was very orderly."
The first dancer was greeted by
jeers and catcalls, and left pretty
quickly. "She looked like she had had
about three kids," observed one coed
who attended the party.
Each of the next three dancers
invited men up onto the stage. "The
first guy just stripped down to his
shorts, but the girls undressed the
others and they danced naked," the
girl said. "When the girls were dancing
it was rather unerotic ... I was
surprised.
'The guys were much more
suggestive than the girls, but the girls
kept them from getting out of hand."
Stanford fraternity Phi Delta Theta
is under investigation by University
officials after a stripper was raffled off
at the house Friday night during a rush
party.
"I'm shocked and dismayed," Larry
Horton, associate dean of student
affairs, told the Daily yesterday.
"There's really nothing we can say
except that we're going to look into
it."
Horton said last night that he had
assigned Norman Robinson, director
of fraternities, to investigate the
incident. Robinson indicated it would
be several days before he could
prepare a report.
The stripper, imported from
Sunnyvale for the party, danced nude
for awhile before her escort suggested
that the fraternity raffle her off.
Master of ceremomies Mark Davis, a
frat member who no longer lives in the
house, tore a deck of cards in half and
began selling them as tickets at $1 a
throw.
