# Two Unions Vie In NLRB Election
## 
### GLENN GARVIN News Analysis 
Last April, after three hard months
of often bitter campaigning, Stanford
workers turned thumbs down on labor
unions.
The "no" from the workers was so
resounding that two unions on the
National Labor Relations Board ballot
last spring—the Teamsters and
Stanford Employees Associations

(SEA)—gave up the fight.
But two other labor groups—one
new to the campus, one rebuilt—are
giving it another try. And both of
them are predicting victory.
When University employees vote
June 6, they'll face a choice between
United Stanford Employees (USE) and
a coalition of two unions calling itself
the Stanford Joint Council.
Original Petitioner
USE, one of the original petitioners
to the NLRB, Campaigned last year
and came in third in the primary
election in March, 1972, behind the no
union option and the Teamsters.
USE two weeks ago voted to
affiliate with the Service Employees
International Union of the AFL-CIO
to pick up some outside strength.
The Joint Council is composed of
two AFL-CIO unions: the
International Union of Operating
Engineers (Local 3) and the American
Federation of State, Country and
Municipal Employees (Local 101).
The Joint Council didn't participate
in last year's NLRB election.
Confident
Although the no-union option came
out ahead in both elections last year,
USE and the Joint Council spokesman
are confident that they can turn things
around this year.
"Times change," says Glenda Jones,
president of USE. "We're much
stronger, since we have experience ih
one election. This year people are
much more aware of the issues.
"And USE has widened both in
perspective and in numbers of people.
I think our recent affiliation makes us
more acceptable to larger numbers of
people," she continues.
Last year USE was characterized on
one hand by the Teamsters as a weak,
in-house union controlled by radicals
and on the other by SEA as a militant
front for the revolutionary group
Venceremos. Some observers think the
charges made USE image-conscious
over the last year.
Genuine
"It depends on what you mean,"
Jones says. 'The image we give is a
true one, not a contrived one. I think
that in the early years of USE some of
the radical members played leadership
roles, but the membership of USE has
consistently not been in agreement
with them. We've had many arguments
with them over whether we should be
involved in political issues.
"USE has taken a position of not
being involved in political issues. It's
showed in the USE paper [ Employees
Organize] and in executive committee
actions and in everything else we've
done."
"When it becomes necessary to
clarify the issue when the Joint

Council is causing confusion, we will
clarify the issues. We will run a
straight, honest campiagn which is no
different than what we have done in
the past," she adds.
"Clarifying the issues" means
taking the offensive, which USE has
done fairly often so far. Employees
Organize, the USE newspaper, has
used a great deal of space to attack the
Joint Council.
Stalling
USE has accused the Joint Council
of stalling the election and clouding
issues. "The truth is just the
opposite," claims Don Mowery, a
Joint Council organizer. "We are
committed to an election at the
earliest possible time."
USE has also portrayed the Joint
Council as an outside union with little
or no familiarity with the campus,
which is more or less the same weapon
used so well last year against the
Teamsters.
'The election here last year did not
mean Stanford employees were
rejecting all outside unions. It meant
they were rejecting the Teamsters,"
Mowery says. "In our organization the
power flows from the bottom up. In
the Teamsters, it's the opposite. We
don't have an executive secrrtary in
San Francisco who is going to tell
people what to do.
Engineer
"And we don't have an electrical
engineer from outside the voting unit
running things either," he adds
pointedly, referring to SLAC engineer
Jim Berk who is married to USE
president Jones and a former president
of the group.
"When we win this election, our
bargaining demands, our negotiating
committee, and our contract will all be
determined by the workers in the
voting unit, not by the whole
University, as the other group says it
will do," Mowery says.
"They didn't appeal to the voters
last time and they won't this time.
Well win in the first election, and USE
won't get as many votes as the
no-union will."
Mowery believes that an outside
union carries a much bigger stick than
one composed exclusively of
University workers—even if it has an
outside affiliation, as USE does.
'Limiting'
"It limits their effectiveness,"
Mowery says. "You still have the
dynamics of an employee talkingto his
boss. We do feel employees should
deal with their employer but we feel
they should have outside help.
"At the last NLRB hearing, USE
wasn't even represented by a lawyer,
but by an electrical engineer [Berk].

HOT SPOT—When you've got two labor unions making promises and
counter-promises, charges and counter-charges, it's a tough life. You might even
feel like shooting yourself out of a cannon, which is what it looks like technician
V. Vadim is doing. Maybe he won't have to vote June 6.
