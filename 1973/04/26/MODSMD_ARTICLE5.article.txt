# Students Volunteer Services, Offer Local Community Aid
## 
### KATHY ALCALA 
At least 15 volunteer service projects involving
Stanford students are currently in progress on campus.
They involve working with many segments of the
surrounding community: children, prison inmates, drug
addicts, and people who simply need advice or someone
with whom to talk.
Many programs have been established as classes under
SWOPSI, which is designed to encourage community
involvement and change. Others have been initiated by
clubs or by various University departments which are
interested in a particular aspect of the community.
"Operation Share," located in the Old Firehouse near
Tresidder, involves 200 tutors from Stanford. The idea
behind Share, according to Coordinator Bill Wilson, is to
"get volunteers to work with kids in a one-to-one
tutoring/big brother relationship."
Share, now in its second year, is a state-funded pilot
program which, theoretically, will be
community-supported after next year. Wilson and two
work-study participants are paid; all tutors are volunteer.
Wilson refers to the tutors as "a very impressive group
of human beings." They found out about Share through
talks in classes, ads in the Daily, and a large number heard
about it through friends.
Training takes place in two ways. Share holds a series
of workshops in areas such as reading, math, social
problems, and childrens activities, but tutors learn the
most by working with the school teacher of their
particular child.
Tutors
Schools designate specific children who need help, and
tutors decide with whom they want to work. 'The tutor
relates to a kid, and often finds "more creative ways of
dealing with him than his teacher," says Wilson. A tutor
will often end up including many of the child's friends in
activities. 'Tutors are a very precious resource, to be
shared with others," Wilson added.
Both MEChA, the chicano students organization, and
the Black Students Union sent tutors on a regular basis to
East Palo Alto. The tutors often form close relationships
with children there and arrange at least one activity a
quarter outside the classroom. According to Sylvia Garcia,
one of the tutors, MEChA sponsored a party for the
children in their program in an attempt to provide a safe
place for them to go that night.
One of the most interesting projects underway is
SWOPSI 1558, "Development of a Playing/Learning
Environment for Children." Created and led by Penny

Mann, who works in the United Campus Ministry here,
the program takes place at the Colorado Park Apartments,
a low-moderate income housing complex near the
Bayshore Freeway.
Sense of Community
The program is geared to create a "sense of
community" in the apartments, according to Mann, who
lives there. About 10 Stanford students use the
Community Center at the apartment complex to teach
crafts and games to children who live there.
Some of the residents are also involved, and parents are
encouraged to help organize activities. Being planned for a
weekend in May is a Community Day Program, to which
craftspeople and artists are welcome to bring their work,
especially work which children can learn.
But children are not the only concern of Stanford
volunteer service organizations. The Bridge is a campus
Peer Counseling and Drop-In Center, also known as
SWOPSI 109. Counselor John Cameron refers to The
Bridge as a "growth center, rather than a first-aid center."
It is designed as a place where people who are lonely or
want to talk can come in and relate to others in their peer
group. Those helped are both students and non-students,
mostly between ages 18 and 30.
Classes
The class consists of about 40 people in three sections,
each taught by a professional or semi-professional in
counseling. The emphasis is on learning to interact with
people in a "healing way," according to Cameron. "We're
not trying to be know-all psychotherapists," he says.
Some departments, such as psychology, encourage
students to observe or participate in community
organizations. Through Psych 124, Communication and
Community Psychology, Jeff McDaniel became involved
in the Palo Alto Community Drug Abuse Program—a
city-funded experimental project. McDaniel saw a need
for a volunteer program, and so organized and is now
leading SWOPSI 167.
The class meets every Tuesday night to hear guest
speakers, including ex-junkies, medical personnel, and
representatives of local government.
At least four hours a week are spent working at the
Palo Alto program. Participants counsel drug addicts,
arrange for detoxification, and handle legal matters such
as criminal charges in which the addicts are often
involved.
They also do research on methadone, perhaps to find
an alternative, since it is "more addictive than heroin,"
according to McDaniel.

"get volunteers to work with kids in a one-to-one
tutoring/big brother relationship."
Share, now in its second year, is a state-funded pilot
program which, theoretically, will be
community-supported after next year. Wilson and two
work-study participants are paid; all tutors are volunteer.
Wilson refers to the tutors as "a very impressive group
of human beings." They found out about Share through
talks in classes, ads in the Daily, and a large number heard
about it through friends.
Training takes place in two ways. Share holds a series
of workshops in areas such as reading, math, social
problems, and childrens activities, but tutors learn the
most by working with the school teacher of their
particular child.
Tutors
Schools designate specific children who need help, and
tutors decide with whom they want to work. 'The tutor
relates to a kid, and often finds "more creative ways of
dealing with him than his teacher," says Wilson. A tutor
will often end up including many of the child's friends in
activities. 'Tutors are a very precious resource, to be
shared with others," Wilson added.
Both MEChA, the chicano students organization, and
the Black Students Union sent tutors on a regular basis to
East Palo Alto. The tutors often form close relationships
with children there and arrange at least one activity a
quarter outside the classroom. According to Sylvia Garcia,
one of the tutors, MEChA sponsored a party for the
children in their program in an attempt to provide a safe
place for them to go that night.
One of the most interesting projects underway is
SWOPSI 1558, "Development of a Playing/Learning
Environment for Children." Created and led by Penny

Mann, who works in the United Campus Ministry here,
the program takes place at the Colorado Park Apartments,
a low-moderate income housing complex near the
Bayshore Freeway.
Sense of Community
The program is geared to create a "sense of
community" in the apartments, according to Mann, who
lives there. About 10 Stanford students use the
Community Center at the apartment complex to teach
crafts and games to children who live there.
Some of the residents are also involved, and parents are
encouraged to help organize activities. Being planned for a
weekend in May is a Community Day Program, to which
craftspeople and artists are welcome to bring their work,
especially work which children can learn.
But children are not the only concern of Stanford
volunteer service organizations. The Bridge is a campus
Peer Counseling and Drop-In Center, also known as
SWOPSI 109. Counselor John Cameron refers to The
Bridge as a "growth center, rather than a first-aid center."
It is designed as a place where people who are lonely or
want to talk can come in and relate to others in their peer
group. Those helped are both students and non-students,
mostly between ages 18 and 30.
Classes
The class consists of about 40 people in three sections,
each taught by a professional or semi-professional in
counseling. The emphasis is on learning to interact with
people in a "healing way," according to Cameron. "We're
not trying to be know-all psychotherapists," he says.
Some departments, such as psychology, encourage
students to observe or participate in community
organizations. Through Psych 124, Communication and
Community Psychology, Jeff McDaniel became involved
in the Palo Alto Community Drug Abuse Program—a
city-funded experimental project. McDaniel saw a need
for a volunteer program, and so organized and is now
leading SWOPSI 167.
The class meets every Tuesday night to hear guest
speakers, including ex-junkies, medical personnel, and
representatives of local government.
At least four hours a week are spent working at the
Palo Alto program. Participants counsel drug addicts,
arrange for detoxification, and handle legal matters such
as criminal charges in which the addicts are often
involved.
They also do research on methadone, perhaps to find
an alternative, since it is "more addictive than heroin,"
according to McDaniel.
At least 15 volunteer service projects involving
Stanford students are currently in progress on campus.
They involve working with many segments of the
surrounding community: children, prison inmates, drug
addicts, and people who simply need advice or someone
with whom to talk.
Many programs have been established as classes under
SWOPSI, which is designed to encourage community
involvement and change. Others have been initiated by
clubs or by various University departments which are
interested in a particular aspect of the community.
"Operation Share," located in the Old Firehouse near
Tresidder, involves 200 tutors from Stanford. The idea
