# 'Sins Of Conservatism'
## On Bill Buckley 
### 
Bill Evers

William F. Buckley, Jr. is a frequent speaker on college campuses
and the host of a television interview program. Yet for all his success
as a debater and TV celebrity, the man's ideological principles remain
relatively unknown. While today's politically aware campus activist
may be able to keep track of and chart all 57 varieties of Trotskyism,
it is quite likely that the precise sins of Buckley remain unknown to
him.
The ideological roots of Buckley's mistaken policy
recommendations on such matters as nuclear war, drug use, and civil
disobedience can often be found in his fundamental political doctrine.
To the non-expert, all political doctrines appear recondite and
obscure, and Buckley's viewpoint is no exception.
Buckley's dogma is called "fusionist conservatism." It is so called
because it attempts to fuse classical conservatism (adherence to the
traditional order as the primary political goal) with some elements of
classical liberalism (adherence to liberty as the primary political goal).
This strange Hegelian synthesis can be compared to a hypothetical
effort in the eighteenth century to fuse Thomas Paine's libertarian
support of the French Revolution with Edmund Burke's traditionist
opposition to it. Such an attempt to reconcile what is philosophically
in contradiction can only lead to a compromise of principles. The
only similar conscious effort in American history that comes to mind
is what President Martin Van Buren rightly condemned as President
James Monroe's "fusion theory" of uniting the policies and partisans
of both the Jeffersonian party and Hamiltonian party during the Era
of Good Feelings.
Fusionist
In Buckley's case, his fusionist conservatism places him squarely in
the position of favoring the following sort of origin for the
institutionalization of political ethics. A king conquers a territory and
after establishing his rule grants civic privileges and rights to his
subjects. Buckley would prefer this to a situation in which citizens
after rebelling against a traditional order headed by a tyrannical
sovereign, proclaimed their own natural and total liberty while setting
up new guards for their public safety.
What are the concrete, practical implications of Buckley's
doctrine? Most importantly, because America's dominion extends
beyond her own borders, his views make Buckley an ardent champion
of Cold War anti-communism. He favors large military budgets,
intervention on foreign soil, and nuclear warfare when deemed
necessary. In fact, Buckley has argued explicitly that the militant
atheists who fly the red flag should be battled "even unto the
consummation of the world," that is even to the extent of
thermonuclear incineration of the planet.
Militarism
Furthermore, Buckley recognizes and embraces the fact that
militarism abroad entails militarism at home. He combines this
recognition with the empirical error of believing that the Russian
government bears the primary responsibility for the Cold War:
"[Soviet aggressiveness] means that we have got to accept Big
Government for the duration — for neither an offensive nor a
defensive war can be waged, given our present government skills,
except through the instrument of a totalitarian bureaucracy within
our shores .... [Conservatives and Republicans] will have to support
large armies and air forces, atomic energy, central intelligence, war
production boards, and the attendent centralization of power in
Washington."
Here revealed in Buckley's own words is the grave internal
contradiction in his viewpoint. As Norman Mailer pointed out while
debating Buckley years ago, Buckley calls for a Garrison State, yet he
yearns, to some degree, for Jeffersonian democracy.
Contradiction?
Buckley can oppose the draft, but argue that "the United
States.. . has the right and the duty to commit its citizens to
whatever actions are necessary abroad in order to secure the defenses
of our own country."
Such contradictions abound. Buckley accepts the medieval
Catholic notion that the government is a divine institution, yet he
rejects the medieval doctrine of resistance to unjust governmental
statutes (except for a now-repudiated endorsement of census
resistance in 1960).
Buckley can similarly cast much of his political rhetoric in terms of
human freedom, yet throw aside a belief in free will when it comes to
the question of heroin. Here both the idea of personal responsibility
found in American "rugged individualist" thought and the classic
Catholic idea of a free moral agent are replaced in Buckley's analysis
of heroin use by modern deterministic psychological views. Even
Buckley's recent advocacy of decriminalization (a moral compromise
between prohibition and full legalization) of marijuana was not on the
ground that freedom of choice should be upheld, but rather on the
ground that the drug was relatively harmless.
All in all, Buckley's contradictory doctrine places him in the
position of using the rhetoric of freedom to endorse a net increase in
governmental power.

opposition to it. Such an attempt to reconcile what is philosophically
in contradiction can only lead to a compromise of principles. The
only similar conscious effort in American history that comes to mind
is what President Martin Van Buren rightly condemned as President
James Monroe's "fusion theory" of uniting the policies and partisans
of both the Jeffersonian party and Hamiltonian party during the Era
of Good Feelings.
Fusionist
In Buckley's case, his fusionist conservatism places him squarely in
the position of favoring the following sort of origin for the
institutionalization of political ethics. A king conquers a territory and
after establishing his rule grants civic privileges and rights to his
subjects. Buckley would prefer this to a situation in which citizens
after rebelling against a traditional order headed by a tyrannical
sovereign, proclaimed their own natural and total liberty while setting
up new guards for their public safety.
What are the concrete, practical implications of Buckley's
doctrine? Most importantly, because America's dominion extends
beyond her own borders, his views make Buckley an ardent champion
of Cold War anti-communism. He favors large military budgets,
intervention on foreign soil, and nuclear warfare when deemed
necessary. In fact, Buckley has argued explicitly that the militant
atheists who fly the red flag should be battled "even unto the
consummation of the world," that is even to the extent of
thermonuclear incineration of the planet.
Militarism
Furthermore, Buckley recognizes and embraces the fact that
militarism abroad entails militarism at home. He combines this
recognition with the empirical error of believing that the Russian
government bears the primary responsibility for the Cold War:
"[Soviet aggressiveness] means that we have got to accept Big
Government for the duration — for neither an offensive nor a
defensive war can be waged, given our present government skills,
except through the instrument of a totalitarian bureaucracy within
our shores .... [Conservatives and Republicans] will have to support
large armies and air forces, atomic energy, central intelligence, war
production boards, and the attendent centralization of power in
Washington."
Here revealed in Buckley's own words is the grave internal
contradiction in his viewpoint. As Norman Mailer pointed out while
debating Buckley years ago, Buckley calls for a Garrison State, yet he
yearns, to some degree, for Jeffersonian democracy.
Contradiction?
Buckley can oppose the draft, but argue that "the United
States.. . has the right and the duty to commit its citizens to
whatever actions are necessary abroad in order to secure the defenses
of our own country."
Such contradictions abound. Buckley accepts the medieval
Catholic notion that the government is a divine institution, yet he
rejects the medieval doctrine of resistance to unjust governmental
statutes (except for a now-repudiated endorsement of census
resistance in 1960).
Buckley can similarly cast much of his political rhetoric in terms of
human freedom, yet throw aside a belief in free will when it comes to
the question of heroin. Here both the idea of personal responsibility
found in American "rugged individualist" thought and the classic
Catholic idea of a free moral agent are replaced in Buckley's analysis
of heroin use by modern deterministic psychological views. Even
Buckley's recent advocacy of decriminalization (a moral compromise
between prohibition and full legalization) of marijuana was not on the
ground that freedom of choice should be upheld, but rather on the
ground that the drug was relatively harmless.
All in all, Buckley's contradictory doctrine places him in the
position of using the rhetoric of freedom to endorse a net increase in
governmental power.

William F. Buckley, Jr. is a frequent speaker on college campuses
and the host of a television interview program. Yet for all his success
as a debater and TV celebrity, the man's ideological principles remain
relatively unknown. While today's politically aware campus activist
may be able to keep track of and chart all 57 varieties of Trotskyism,
it is quite likely that the precise sins of Buckley remain unknown to
him.
The ideological roots of Buckley's mistaken policy
recommendations on such matters as nuclear war, drug use, and civil
disobedience can often be found in his fundamental political doctrine.
To the non-expert, all political doctrines appear recondite and
obscure, and Buckley's viewpoint is no exception.
Buckley's dogma is called "fusionist conservatism." It is so called
because it attempts to fuse classical conservatism (adherence to the
traditional order as the primary political goal) with some elements of
classical liberalism (adherence to liberty as the primary political goal).
This strange Hegelian synthesis can be compared to a hypothetical
effort in the eighteenth century to fuse Thomas Paine's libertarian
support of the French Revolution with Edmund Burke's traditionist
opposition to it. Such an attempt to reconcile what is philosophically
in contradiction can only lead to a compromise of principles. The
only similar conscious effort in American history that comes to mind
