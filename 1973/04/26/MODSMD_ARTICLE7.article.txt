# Blossoms And Barking
## Springtime In Washington, D.C. 
### 
B.F. Sisk

These beautiful spring mornings in Washington make it a pleasure
to walk to work — provided, of course, one doesn't get shot or
mugged, or run over in the rush of motorists hurrying to get to work
before the boss comes in.
Walking makes a person "fair game." It's great for the ecology, but
not for our national economy which is based more and more on the
automobile and its appetites. Thus, anyone who is walking is felt to be
slightly treasonous and probably "some kind of nut" anyway. This
makes for a lot of honking and occasional spoken epithets.

I mentioned before that I get acquainted with a lot of dogs and cats
along the way, and that a dog which is safely located behind a fence is
always the loudest and fiercest when it comes to barking. I'm afraid
being enclosed in a steel and glass cocoon has the same effect on us
when we drive. It has often been noted that a person undergoes a
personality change when he gets behind the wheel and steps on the
starter. What alarms me, however, is that our whole society seems to
be undergoing the same kind of change.
Beautiful Spring?
These beautiful spring mornings make it awfully hard to feel
unfriendly toward anyone or anything. But only, it seems, if you're
unenclosed and able to look at the trees in bloom and even, perhaps,
smell the blossoms. Isolated from the soft, warm air and blue of the
sky — and in a hurry to beat the boss to the office — people are
inclined to snarl and honk.
I can remember when courtesy was not considered unusual. Maybe
by coincidence, those were the days when most folks walked and even
the cars were not so hermetically sealed. But then the air was not a
hazard to one's health and the person you met on the street was more
likely to say "howdy" than to whip out some weapon and demand
your money. In broad daylight? You'd better believe it.
When spring comes around, it's a great time to get involved. With
the trees, the sky, the warm breezes — and if you're the right age and
the circumstances are right, with what a young man's fancy turns to.
It would be just great, in my opinion, if people would — at least in the
spring — get down off their Detroit high-horses and walk to work
sometimes. I'm sure such a development would make life much more
interesting for the dogs of our nation's capital. They must get tired of
barking at the same people all the time.

the trees, the sky, the warm breezes — and if you're the right age and
the circumstances are right, with what a young man's fancy turns to.
It would be just great, in my opinion, if people would — at least in the
spring — get down off their Detroit high-horses and walk to work
sometimes. I'm sure such a development would make life much more
interesting for the dogs of our nation's capital. They must get tired of
barking at the same people all the time.

These beautiful spring mornings in Washington make it a pleasure
to walk to work — provided, of course, one doesn't get shot or
mugged, or run over in the rush of motorists hurrying to get to work
before the boss comes in.
Walking makes a person "fair game." It's great for the ecology, but
not for our national economy which is based more and more on the
automobile and its appetites. Thus, anyone who is walking is felt to be
slightly treasonous and probably "some kind of nut" anyway. This
makes for a lot of honking and occasional spoken epithets.

I mentioned before that I get acquainted with a lot of dogs and cats
along the way, and that a dog which is safely located behind a fence is
always the loudest and fiercest when it comes to barking. I'm afraid
being enclosed in a steel and glass cocoon has the same effect on us
when we drive. It has often been noted that a person undergoes a
personality change when he gets behind the wheel and steps on the
starter. What alarms me, however, is that our whole society seems to
be undergoing the same kind of change.
Beautiful Spring?
These beautiful spring mornings make it awfully hard to feel
unfriendly toward anyone or anything. But only, it seems, if you're
unenclosed and able to look at the trees in bloom and even, perhaps,
smell the blossoms. Isolated from the soft, warm air and blue of the
sky — and in a hurry to beat the boss to the office — people are
inclined to snarl and honk.
I can remember when courtesy was not considered unusual. Maybe
by coincidence, those were the days when most folks walked and even
the cars were not so hermetically sealed. But then the air was not a
hazard to one's health and the person you met on the street was more
likely to say "howdy" than to whip out some weapon and demand
your money. In broad daylight? You'd better believe it.
When spring comes around, it's a great time to get involved. With
the trees, the sky, the warm breezes — and if you're the right age and
the circumstances are right, with what a young man's fancy turns to.
It would be just great, in my opinion, if people would — at least in the
spring — get down off their Detroit high-horses and walk to work
sometimes. I'm sure such a development would make life much more
interesting for the dogs of our nation's capital. They must get tired of
