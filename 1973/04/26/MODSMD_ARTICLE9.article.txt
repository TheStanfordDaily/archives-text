I noticed in your April 17,
front-page article on Fraternity
Rushes, that you made no
mention of the Phi Sig House.
You did, however name several
other houses which are in the
University's Housing Draw, as is
the Phi Sig House.
In a sense, your omission was
reasonable, as we have
disaffiliated from Phi Sigma
Kappa national and might not
then be considered a normal or
usual fraternity. But we are
all-male, and we do offer most of
the things other fraternities offer,
and a few more things besides.
We have parties, and we have
the sense of togetherness which
makes a fraternity different from
a boarding house. We also control
our own house, something the
cluster fraternities cannot say, and
this (among other factors) allows
us to have the lowest room and
board rates on campus.
I guess the thing which makes
us most different is that we don't
spend $1200 trying to get
freshmen drunk so they'll want to
live here. If that's the case, I don't
mind that you left us out.

Course Evaluations
A unique new course
evaluation procedure has been
started in the CSO which should
be of interest to the entire
Stanford community. First, it is a
formal, student-run procedure
which as departmental policy
evaluates every Computer Science
course at the end of each quarter,
using a questionnaire developed
by the student Course Evaluation
Committee. Secondly, the results
of this evaluation are distributed
to each instructor, and are
available for public reference as
well. Copies are placed in the CSD
library (Polya Hall), and may be
examined there by anyone.
The summaries contain several
kinds of information. The
numerical data are tabulated, the
prevalent comments are
summarized, and a brief overall
review is given for each course.
The procedure was developed
with two main purposes in mind.
The first was to provide an
effective form of feedback for the
faculty, in order to encourage
concern and consideration of
teaching methods and practices.
The second was to make available
to all interested persons complete
and accurate information about
student reaction to courses and
professors. A student who is
considering taking a course in
Computer Science is now able to
make his decision based on more
than random or "through the
grapevine" comments.
A great deal of time and effort
has gone to the creation of these
reviews; we believe they will be
very useful to anyone considering
taking a CS course. The reviews
summarize student opinion on the
course, and as such are a unique
source of information concerning
student reaction to aspects such as
workload, instructor, course
content and organization. We urge
anyone interested in a CS course
to take advantage of the reviews.

If the sponsors of the Citizen's
Advocates had put as much
positive effort into making a
strong case for their proposition
as they have put negative effort
into a sour grapes post mortem on
why it went down to defeat ("A
Big Question About Legal Aid,"
Daily, April 20) the outcome
might have been different.
I anxiously await their fund
drive on and off campus to
establish Citizens Advocates and
demonstrate its effectiveness.
Surely such a worthy cause will
not be allowed to die without a
serious attempt by its sponsors to
see it make it on its own merits.
Or will they say "let someone else
do it!"?

If the sponsors of the Citizen's
Advocates had put as much
positive effort into making a
strong case for their proposition
as they have put negative effort
into a sour grapes post mortem on
why it went down to defeat ("A
Big Question About Legal Aid,"
Daily, April 20) the outcome
might have been different.
I anxiously await their fund
drive on and off campus to
establish Citizens Advocates and
demonstrate its effectiveness.
Surely such a worthy cause will
not be allowed to die without a
serious attempt by its sponsors to
see it make it on its own merits.
Or will they say "let someone else
do it!"?

I noticed in your April 17,
front-page article on Fraternity
Rushes, that you made no
mention of the Phi Sig House.
You did, however name several
other houses which are in the
University's Housing Draw, as is
the Phi Sig House.
In a sense, your omission was
reasonable, as we have
disaffiliated from Phi Sigma
Kappa national and might not
then be considered a normal or
usual fraternity. But we are
all-male, and we do offer most of
the things other fraternities offer,
and a few more things besides.
We have parties, and we have
the sense of togetherness which
makes a fraternity different from
a boarding house. We also control
our own house, something the
cluster fraternities cannot say, and
this (among other factors) allows
us to have the lowest room and
board rates on campus.
I guess the thing which makes
us most different is that we don't
spend $1200 trying to get
freshmen drunk so they'll want to
live here. If that's the case, I don't
mind that you left us out.

Course Evaluations
A unique new course
evaluation procedure has been
started in the CSO which should
be of interest to the entire
Stanford community. First, it is a
formal, student-run procedure
which as departmental policy
evaluates every Computer Science
course at the end of each quarter,
using a questionnaire developed
by the student Course Evaluation
Committee. Secondly, the results
of this evaluation are distributed
to each instructor, and are
available for public reference as
well. Copies are placed in the CSD
library (Polya Hall), and may be
examined there by anyone.
The summaries contain several
kinds of information. The
numerical data are tabulated, the
prevalent comments are
summarized, and a brief overall
review is given for each course.
The procedure was developed
with two main purposes in mind.
The first was to provide an
effective form of feedback for the
faculty, in order to encourage
concern and consideration of
teaching methods and practices.
The second was to make available
to all interested persons complete
and accurate information about
student reaction to courses and
professors. A student who is
considering taking a course in
Computer Science is now able to
make his decision based on more
than random or "through the
grapevine" comments.
A great deal of time and effort
has gone to the creation of these
reviews; we believe they will be
very useful to anyone considering
taking a CS course. The reviews
summarize student opinion on the
course, and as such are a unique
source of information concerning
student reaction to aspects such as
workload, instructor, course
content and organization. We urge
anyone interested in a CS course
to take advantage of the reviews.
