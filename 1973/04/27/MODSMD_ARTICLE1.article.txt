WASHINGTON — The resignation of
Jeb Stuart Magruder — the former
Nixon campaign official linked in news
reports with the Watergate affair —
from his Commerce Department job
yesterday capped a day of
developments in the case.
Magruder's resignation was
disclosed by his lawyer without
explanation.
Magruder reportedly has told
prosecutors that former Atty. Gen.
John N. Mitchell and White House
counsel John W. Dean III approved and
helped plan the Watergate bugging
operation.
Magruder served as deputy director
campaign director under Mitchell.
One of the men originally convicted
in the conspiracy, James W. McCord
Jr., has testified that he heard
Magruder personally helped plan the
operation.
Magruder's attorney has said that
his client will testify voluntarily before
the federal grand jury which is
investigating the Watergate case.
There were these other
developments:
—It was announced that President
Nixon's special Watergate prosecutor is
probing acting FBI Director L. Patrick
Gray Ill's reported destruction of
politically sensitive files belonging to
another bugging conspiractor, E.
Howard Hunt.
—Republican party chief George
Bush reportedly told the White House
yesterday that no one "even remotely
connected with this whole mess" will
be allowed to have any role in future
committee activities. Bush, said The

Washington Post, relayed the same
sentiments to National Committee
employees at a staff meeting.
The disclosure of the investigation
into Gray's reported destruction of
files was made by presidential assistant
John Ehrlichman, in a statement
released by Deputy White House Press
Secretary Gerald Warran.
"The matter has been under
investigation" by Asst. Atty. Gen.
Henry Petersen since April 15, said
Ehrlichman.
Ehrlichman reacted to a New York
Daily News report that Gray is ready
to tell the Watergate grand jury he
burned the files at the suggestion of
Ehrlichman and Dean.
The New York Times carried a
similar report.
Ehrlichman said Dean gave Gray a
large sealed envelope containing "some
of the contents of the Hunt safe" at a

meeting in Ehrlichman's White House
office in June 1972.
"Mr. Gray was told by Mr. Dean
that the contents were sensitive
materials, not in any way related to
the Watergate case," Ehrlichman's
statement continued.
The News said Gray told Petersen
that Dean described the Hunt files "as
containing 'fabricated' State
Department cables, related to
President Kennedy's complicity in the
assassination of South Vietnamese
President Diem."
"I was present, but neither then,
nor at any other time, did I give Mr.
Gray any request, suggestion or
instruction regarding what should be
done with the contents," added
Nixon's chief domestic adviser, thus
denying Gray's reported contention
that Dean and Ehrlichman told him
that "these files should never see the

light of day."
Ehrlichman said he doesn't know
"the nature of the contents" but
clearly indicated he heard that Gray
had destroyed them when he said:
