# A
						Danger Of 'Nazi-Like Thinking'
## Quotas Must Be Repudiated 
### 
* Murray N. Rothbard

One of the most bizarre — and
potentially dangerous —
developments to emerge out of
the ill-fated McGovernite
movement was the recrudescence
of the "quota system." We saw
this system in full flower when
the duly and freely elected
Democratic delegates from Illinois
were denied their seats because
the composition of the delegation
did not satisfy the new quota
standards.
The quota theory is simplicity
itself. One looks at any subset of
the population and tries to
determine whether any group
within that aggregate — which
may be defined in any way one
wants: by age, sex or ethnic
identity, for example — is less
than proportionate to its
percentage of the population as a
whole. If the group has less than
its share of representation, this
becomes proof that the group is
being "discriminated against" and
a sign that corrective action must
be taken to right the grievous
wrong.
Gander
The spurious fairness of the
quota theory is aided by focusing
on the groups below "their"
quotas and forgetting about the
necessary other side of the coin:
the groups above "theirs." There
was a time when the quota
theorists were not so reticent; the
most notorious use of quotas was
by the anti-Semite theorists in
Germany and the United States
around the 19305. The litany
went somewhat as follows: Jews
constitute only 3 percent of the
total population of the country.
And yet. . . and yet, 50 percent
of the physicians are Jews, and 60
percent of motion picture
producers, 38 percent of
journalists, etc. (I am making up
the figures, but the principle is
illustrated by them.) What is this?
goes the theory: this is patently
unfair, we must kick Jews out of
these professions until they are
down to 3 percent.
The point is that what is sauce
for the goose is also sauce for the
gander. If it is unfair for
Albanian-Americans to have less
than their share of representation
in any group, then it is equally
unfair for Jews to have more than
their share, and coercive pressure
to right the wrong must be used in
both cases.
Perseverance
Perhaps some might think it
unfair or antiquarian of me to
bring up the Jewish case (though
it was not so long ago that Jewish
quotas, on the same theory of
fairness, were being imposed in
American colleges and medical
schools). But the point is that the
Jewish case is still all too relevant;
for if action is to be taken to raise
the "oppressed" groups to their
share of delegates, professors,
physicians or whatever, then some
group will have to be coercively
pushed down to their share. But if
we investigate which groups will
directly suffer from the
imposition of quotas, we will land
inevitably on: adult male
heterosexual WASPs . .. and Jews.
Practical Problems
The fact that Jews will be
major sufferers once again from
the theory is not enough to throw
it out completely. But it is enough
to highlight one of its major
theoretical errors: for if the fact
that Albanian-Americans are
"unde represented" is enough to
demonstrate their "oppression,"
then the fact that any group is
"overrepresented" should equally
be enough to show that its
members are among the leading
"oppressors." And while there are
enough benighted people
nowadays who believe that male
heterosexual WASPs constitute a
ruling class, there are few who will
maintain that male Jews are a
ruling class.
In fact, of course, it was not

very long ago that Jews
constituted a group who, by any
objective criteria, were indeed
discriminated against. How, then,
did they so rapidly rise into the
"overpresented" category in so
many desirable occupations? The
answer to this question is enough
to shoot down the whole theory
of the quota system. They did it
by hard work and ability —
through drive, intelligence and
perseverance. But that means that
status and rank in occupations,
whether high or low, are due to
the presence or absence of these
abilities and virtues. In short, if
the high representation of Jews is
due to the intense presence and
application of these virtues, then
the low representation of other
groups must be due to their lack
of these qualities.
The quota system, then, is at
once antidemocratic and
antiliberal in the classical sense of
that much abused term. It is a
direct assault on the theory that
each individual may go as far as
his talents and drive can carry
him. The quota system is a
despotic assault on the most able
and talented among us: it is a
compulsory egalitarian attempt to
cripple individuals ot ability, to
discriminate against them in a
truly oppressive way.
The quota theory is, in fact, all
too reminiscent of the
horror-fiction account of an
egalitarian future by Kurt
Vonnegut. Thus, Vonnegut begins
his story, "Harrison Bergeron":
"The year was 2081, and
everybody was finally equal. They
weren't only equal before God
and the Law. They were equal
every which way. Nobody was

smarter than anybody else.
Nobody was better looking than
anybody else. Nobody was
stronger or quicker than anybody
else. All this equality was due to
the . . . United States Handicapper
General."
The "handicapping" worked
like this: Hazel had a perfectly
average intelligence, which meant
she could think only in short
bursts. George's intelligence was
way above normal, so he had to
wear a mental-handicap radio in
his ear, tuned to a government
transmitter. Every 20 seconds or
so, the transmitter would send out
a sharp noise to keep people like
George from taking unfair
advantage of their brains (Kurt
Vonnegut, Jr., "Harrison
Bergeron," Welcome to the
Monkey House).
There are insuperable practical
problems in any attempt to apply
the quota theory consistently. For
there is an almost infinite number
of groups that we can conjure out
of the population to demand their
quota rights. Where, indeed, have
Albanian-Americans been in the
discussion? And how about a
group in which I have a certain
personal interest — short people?
May we not maintain that
"shorts" are the first to be fired
and the last to be hired; and
where are the short executives,
the short bankers, the short
senators and presidents? Shall we
not call upon short pride, short
institutes, short-history courses?
Of course, this
"short-liberation movement" is
not directed against the talis. We
are out to liberate all people,
short and tall alike; we welcome
"consciousness-raising" groups for

all guilt-ridden talis who
sympathize with our movement.
In practice, of course, the new
quota theorists do not attempt to
apply their theory across the
board. Indeed, where are the
shorts and the Albanians? And
where are the Poles, Irish, Italians,
Czechs, etc? The exclusion of
these "ethnics" from the
pantheon of the "oppressed" has
been criticized severely by the
neglected groups and those who
remain interested in logic and
consistency. But the current
quota theorists confine their
agitation to women, blacks,
Chicanos, youth and
homosexuals, all of which fail to
' meet their quotas and are
therefore "oppressed." The truly
interesting statistic at the
Democratic convention, by the
way, is the fact that no less than
39 percent of the delegates had
attended graduate school. Here is
a real reflection of the "people."
What we were seeing, in short, was
a naked grab for power on the
part of an eager new elite of
graduate students and
upper-middle-class liberals; a new
mandarin class was to be fastened
upon the country in the name of
egalitarian rhetoric.
The quota system, in short,
must be repudiated immediately
and completely, before a new
Nazi-like thinking is allowed to
sweep away the individualism that
made America a beacon for all
people throughout the world.
