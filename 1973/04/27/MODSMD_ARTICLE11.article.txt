NLRB Vote Date
Editor:
The Daily article (April 25) on
the June 6 labor election included
a statement from Doug Barton,
University legal counsel. The
article asserted that in
negotiations with the NLRB, the
June 6 date "is somewhat later
than the Stanford Joint Council
had wanted. The parties agree that
it is the earliest date possible in
order to insure adequate time for
campaigning." This language does
not explain accurately what
happened at the NLRB meeting.
United Stanford Employees
has consistently sought the
earliest possible date for the
election. In a very real sense our
"campaigning" has been
underway for the 3V2 years we
have been actively assisting
university employees. Only an
unfamiliar outside union, perhaps
benefiting by exposure, would
gain from a delay in the election.
The Joint Council first appeared
here about six weeks ago. They
have indeed delayed the election
by having insisted on an NLRB
hearing. But at yesterday's
meeting, the Joint Council finally
agreed to accept the same criteria
that were negotiated by U.S.E.
and Stanford administrators
almost three weeks ago. Had the
Joint Council accepted the same
consensus when first available, on
April 6, Stanford employees could
have had the election on May 2.
We have lost more than a month.
The University's position has
consistently required a minimum
of seven days for clarifying the list
of eligible employees, ten days for
union campaigning, and fourteen
days for mailing to off-campus
employees. Jim Berk, U.S.E.'s
negotiator in these proceedings,
asked for the election to be May

24. Later dates were proposed by
the University and by the Joint
Council.

Tax Resistance
Editor:
It was good to read Chris
Hocker's article, "Down with
Taxes" (Daily, April 10). People's
easy acquiescence to taxation is
always surprising.
Though small at present, the
war tax resistance movement in
this country is growing. There are,
however, many technical
difficulties in resisting income
taxes. Primary among these is
withholding, by which employers
deduct most income taxes.
Through withholding, the
government removes much of the
individual's responsibility for tax
paying. One scarcely noticed the

deductions from each paycheck.
I have personally circumvented
this problem by declaring 14
exemptions on my W-4 form at
Stanford University Hospital.
Thirteen of these exemptions are
under the heading of allowances
for estimated itemized
deductions. I have informed the
Internal Revenue Service that I
plan to claim 50 percent of my
taxes (that portion of the nation's
tax revenues which supports war
and related activities) as "War
Crimes Deductions." By this
method, my employer cannot
withhold federal income taxes
from my wages. Therefore I will
be able, at least temporarily, to
prevent the government from
taxing my income for military
purposes.

resistance, people can contact War
