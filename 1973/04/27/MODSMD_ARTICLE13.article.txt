# Five Faculty Members Chosen For Academy
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C. - Five
faculty members and two
alumni were elected to
membership in the nation's most
distinguished scientific
organization, according to an
announcement Tuesday, from the
National Academy of Sciences.
Faculty members elected are
Profs. James D. Bjorken of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC), Gordon H. Bower
of the Psychology Department,
Arthur E. Bryson of the
Department of Aeronautics and
Astronautics, Theodore H.
Geballe of Applied Physics and
Materials Science Departments,
and James G. March of the School
of Education.
Alumni elected are Bernard M.
Oliver, vice president for research
at Hewlett-Packard Co. of Palo
Alto, and geologist Donald E.
White of the U.S. Geological
Survey in Menlo Park.

The total number elected
throughout the nation was 95.
Stanford, Harvard, and MIT led in
numbers with five faculty
members each. Stanford now has
45 members of the academy
among its faculty.
Bjorken has been a key figure
among theoretical physicists
seeking to explain observations of
"deep inelastic scattering" in
SLAC high-energy physics
experiments. He has previously
been honored for his
contributions to particle physics
theory.
Bower is noted for his
outstanding work in mathematical
psychology and learning theory.
He is the author of more than 50
scientific papers and coauthor of
several books, and is highly
regarded as a teacher.
Bryson is chairman of his
department and holds the
endowed Paul Pigott professorship
in engineering. Considered an

excellent teacher and gifted
researcher, he has made important
contributions to optimal control
theory and holds a joint
appointment in the Department
of Applied Mechanics.
Geballe is well known for his
studies of the properties of
semiconductors and
superconductors of electricity. His
investigations of niobium-german
ium-albuminum compounds led to
superconductivity above 20
degrees Kelvin, the highest
temperature to date.
March holds the endowed
David Jacks professorship of
higher education at Stanford and
is former dean of the School of
Social Science at UC-Irvine. He is
a specialist in organizational
theory and is considered among
the most imaginative and
constructive in this field. He holds
a joint appointment in the
Political Science Department.
Election to the academy is
considered one of the highest
honors accorded to an American
scientist or engineer. Its
membership is limited to
approximately 1000. It was
established by Abraham Lincoln
in 1863 to act in an advisory
capacity to the federal
government on matters of science
and technology.
