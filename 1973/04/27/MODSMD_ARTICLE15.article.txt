# Foes Cry Foul
## Busing Initiative Ignored 
### Associated Press 
SACRAMENTO - Despite
passage of California's antibusing
initiative — Prop. 21 — last
November, buses taking students
to desegregated schools are rolling
out as usual.
The foes, led by Assemblyman
Floyd Wakefield, a conservative
South Gate Republican, cry foul
and charge the state Department
of Education with purposely
failing to enforce the new law.
Thomas Griffin, the
department's chief legal counsel,
explains the situation this way:
"Districts are just laying back in
the weeds letting the status quo
stand and not rocking the boat in
hopes the courts will solve the
question."
Griffin added in an interview,
'The NAACP is gearing up to sue
anybody who doesn't bus, and
parents' groups are gearing up to
sue anybody who does, so
districts are just trying to keep a
low profile."
Riles Interview
Wilson Riles, California's black
superintendent of schools, said in
an interview that Prop. 21 took
away his department's legal
foothold to advise the state's
1067 districts on whether or not
to bus.

Hopefully, Riles said, the
California Supreme Court will
issue a decision on the
constitutionality of Prop. 21
before next fall because "I am
sympathetic with districts that are
marching to different orders."
Riles added, "The courts say
do this and the initiative says do
that. Unless we get together, the
districts will be left in confusion."
Political Impact
Answering Wakefield's
contention that the state
superintendent's opinions on
busing vary depending on how
close he is to running for election,
Riles said: "Mr. Wakefield has
only one issue — busing — and he
spends most of his time writing
open letters to me" about it.
Wakefield has sent two open
letters to Riles and the news
media saying many school
officials "have ignored" Prop. 21
and have said they "will wait and
see what the court says" before
taking action.
Of California's 4.5 million
school children in kindergarten
through 12th grade, about one
million ride buses to and from
school each day, state officials
estimate
But only about 50,000 of them
are bused solely for integration

purposes, according to Education
Department figures. These
students are in districts where
courts have ordered integration —
such as San Francisco — or where
cities such as Berkeley voluntarily
imposed busing for integration.
Prop. 21, approved by a 4.7
million to 2.8 million vote, stated:
"No public school student shall
because of his race, creed or color,
be assigned to or be required to
attend a particular school."
Critics maintain the measure is
flagrantly unconstitutional —
denying children their right to an
equal education.
'Evil, Wrong, Disastrous'
Both forced segregation and
forced integration are "evil, wrong
and disastrous," Wakefield said,
but "the people spoke" when
they passed Prop. 21 and
integration busing must cease.
Riles has angered Wakefield by
failing to answer his open letters,
but Riles says he never answers
open ' letters because "I am
interested in solving problems —
not in*making publicity."
Wakefield counters that he will
take his gripe to the courts —
suing to get back the money local
school officials have spent on
busing since Prop. 21 passed.
Denies Prejudice
In the past, Wakefield has
denied repeatedly that the motive
behind his antibusing crusade is
fostered by prejudice against
blacks or Mexican-Americans.
Assemblyman William Bagley,
a liberal San Rafael Republican
who authored a set of integration
guidelines nullified by Prop. 21,
said in an interview that he fears
the effect Prop. 21 may be having.
When school officials decide
where to place new school
buildings, Bagley said he fears
they won't consider the racial mix

of the population around the site
because of Prop. 21's passage.
Nullified Guidelines
Under the nullified Bagley
guidelines, which became law
early in 1972, districts were
directed to come up with plans to
move toward racially balanced
districts.
Bagley has argued that Prop.
21 forced the busing issue into the
courts' laps and insured that they
would have to rule on the matter
— something he said his guidelines
avoided.
Recently, Richard Foster,
Berkeley city schools
superintendent, told a group of
education that on the whole the
city's voluntary integration
program has been a "success."
When the Berkeley program
got underway in 1968, it was one
of the first of its kind in the
country.
Although integration has
increased tension among students,
Foster said he believes students
are learning to live with the
tension. He also reported all
ethnic groups in the city's schools
are achieving more now than they
were before busing began five
years ago.

officials "have ignored" Prop. 21
and have said they "will wait and
see what the court says" before
taking action.
Of California's 4.5 million
school children in kindergarten
through 12th grade, about one
million ride buses to and from
school each day, state officials
estimate
But only about 50,000 of them
are bused solely for integration

purposes, according to Education
Department figures. These
students are in districts where
courts have ordered integration —
such as San Francisco — or where
cities such as Berkeley voluntarily
imposed busing for integration.
Prop. 21, approved by a 4.7
million to 2.8 million vote, stated:
"No public school student shall
because of his race, creed or color,
be assigned to or be required to
attend a particular school."
Critics maintain the measure is
flagrantly unconstitutional —
denying children their right to an
equal education.
'Evil, Wrong, Disastrous'
Both forced segregation and
forced integration are "evil, wrong
and disastrous," Wakefield said,
but "the people spoke" when
they passed Prop. 21 and
integration busing must cease.
Riles has angered Wakefield by
failing to answer his open letters,
but Riles says he never answers
open ' letters because "I am
interested in solving problems —
not in*making publicity."
Wakefield counters that he will
take his gripe to the courts —
suing to get back the money local
school officials have spent on
busing since Prop. 21 passed.
Denies Prejudice
In the past, Wakefield has
denied repeatedly that the motive
behind his antibusing crusade is
fostered by prejudice against
blacks or Mexican-Americans.
Assemblyman William Bagley,
a liberal San Rafael Republican
who authored a set of integration
guidelines nullified by Prop. 21,
said in an interview that he fears
the effect Prop. 21 may be having.
When school officials decide
where to place new school
buildings, Bagley said he fears
they won't consider the racial mix

of the population around the site
because of Prop. 21's passage.
Nullified Guidelines
Under the nullified Bagley
guidelines, which became law
early in 1972, districts were
directed to come up with plans to
move toward racially balanced
districts.
Bagley has argued that Prop.
21 forced the busing issue into the
courts' laps and insured that they
would have to rule on the matter
— something he said his guidelines
avoided.
Recently, Richard Foster,
Berkeley city schools
superintendent, told a group of
education that on the whole the
city's voluntary integration
program has been a "success."
When the Berkeley program
got underway in 1968, it was one
of the first of its kind in the
country.
Although integration has
increased tension among students,
Foster said he believes students
are learning to live with the
tension. He also reported all
ethnic groups in the city's schools
are achieving more now than they
were before busing began five
years ago.
SACRAMENTO - Despite
passage of California's antibusing
initiative — Prop. 21 — last
November, buses taking students
to desegregated schools are rolling
out as usual.
The foes, led by Assemblyman
Floyd Wakefield, a conservative
South Gate Republican, cry foul
and charge the state Department
of Education with purposely
failing to enforce the new law.
Thomas Griffin, the
department's chief legal counsel,
explains the situation this way:
"Districts are just laying back in
the weeds letting the status quo
stand and not rocking the boat in
hopes the courts will solve the
question."
Griffin added in an interview,
'The NAACP is gearing up to sue
anybody who doesn't bus, and
parents' groups are gearing up to
sue anybody who does, so
districts are just trying to keep a
low profile."
Riles Interview
Wilson Riles, California's black
superintendent of schools, said in
an interview that Prop. 21 took
away his department's legal
foothold to advise the state's
1067 districts on whether or not
to bus.

Hopefully, Riles said, the
California Supreme Court will
issue a decision on the
constitutionality of Prop. 21
before next fall because "I am
sympathetic with districts that are
marching to different orders."
Riles added, "The courts say
do this and the initiative says do
that. Unless we get together, the
districts will be left in confusion."
Political Impact
Answering Wakefield's
contention that the state
superintendent's opinions on
busing vary depending on how
close he is to running for election,
Riles said: "Mr. Wakefield has
only one issue — busing — and he
spends most of his time writing
open letters to me" about it.
Wakefield has sent two open
letters to Riles and the news
media saying many school
officials "have ignored" Prop. 21
and have said they "will wait and

taking action.

the effect Prop. 21 may be having.
When school officials decide
where to place new school
buildings, Bagley said he fears
they won't consider the racial mix

of the population around the site
because of Prop. 21's passage.
Nullified Guidelines
Under the nullified Bagley
guidelines, which became law
early in 1972, districts were
directed to come up with plans to
move toward racially balanced
districts.
Bagley has argued that Prop.
21 forced the busing issue into the
courts' laps and insured that they
would have to rule on the matter
— something he said his guidelines
avoided.
Recently, Richard Foster,
Berkeley city schools
superintendent, told a group of
education that on the whole the
city's voluntary integration
program has been a "success."
When the Berkeley program
got underway in 1968, it was one
of the first of its kind in the
country.
Although integration has
increased tension among students,
Foster said he believes students
are learning to live with the
tension. He also reported all
ethnic groups in the city's schools
are achieving more now than they
were before busing began five
years ago.
SACRAMENTO - Despite
passage of California's antibusing
initiative — Prop. 21 — last
November, buses taking students
to desegregated schools are rolling
out as usual.
The foes, led by Assemblyman
Floyd Wakefield, a conservative
South Gate Republican, cry foul
and charge the state Department
of Education with purposely
failing to enforce the new law.
Thomas Griffin, the
department's chief legal counsel,
explains the situation this way:
"Districts are just laying back in
the weeds letting the status quo
stand and not rocking the boat in
hopes the courts will solve the
question."
Griffin added in an interview,
'The NAACP is gearing up to sue
anybody who doesn't bus, and
parents' groups are gearing up to
sue anybody who does, so
districts are just trying to keep a
low profile."
Riles Interview
Wilson Riles, California's black
superintendent of schools, said in
an interview that Prop. 21 took
away his department's legal
foothold to advise the state's
1067 districts on whether or not
to bus.

Hopefully, Riles said, the
California Supreme Court will
issue a decision on the
constitutionality of Prop. 21
before next fall because "I am
sympathetic with districts that are
marching to different orders."
Riles added, "The courts say
do this and the initiative says do
that. Unless we get together, the
districts will be left in confusion."
Political Impact
Answering Wakefield's
contention that the state
superintendent's opinions on
busing vary depending on how
close he is to running for election,
Riles said: "Mr. Wakefield has
only one issue — busing — and he
spends most of his time writing
open letters to me" about it.
Wakefield has sent two open
letters to Riles and the news
media saying many school
officials "have ignored" Prop. 21
and have said they "will wait and
see what the court says" before
taking action.
Of California's 4.5 million
school children in kindergarten
through 12th grade, about one
million ride buses to and from
school each day, state officials
estimate
But only about 50,000 of them
are bused solely for integration

purposes, according to Education
Department figures. These
students are in districts where
courts have ordered integration —
such as San Francisco — or where
cities such as Berkeley voluntarily
imposed busing for integration.
Prop. 21, approved by a 4.7
million to 2.8 million vote, stated:
"No public school student shall
because of his race, creed or color,
be assigned to or be required to
attend a particular school."
Critics maintain the measure is
flagrantly unconstitutional —
denying children their right to an
equal education.
'Evil, Wrong, Disastrous'
Both forced segregation and
forced integration are "evil, wrong
and disastrous," Wakefield said,
but "the people spoke" when
they passed Prop. 21 and
integration busing must cease.
Riles has angered Wakefield by
failing to answer his open letters,
but Riles says he never answers
open ' letters because "I am
interested in solving problems —
not in*making publicity."
Wakefield counters that he will
take his gripe to the courts —
suing to get back the money local
school officials have spent on
busing since Prop. 21 passed.
Denies Prejudice
In the past, Wakefield has
denied repeatedly that the motive
behind his antibusing crusade is
fostered by prejudice against
blacks or Mexican-Americans.
Assemblyman William Bagley,
a liberal San Rafael Republican
who authored a set of integration
guidelines nullified by Prop. 21,
said in an interview that he fears
the effect Prop. 21 may be having.

buildings, Bagley said he fears
