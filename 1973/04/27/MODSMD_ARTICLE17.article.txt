# Sha Na Na Exhibits Showmanship
## 
### JAMES LOBSENZ 
"Ladies and gentleman, the greatest show on earth,
the world's smallest three ring circus, Sha Na Na!"
Certainly the motley crew of twelve, formerly of
Columbia University, could be introduced that way,
although they prefer a more subtle stage entry.
After a few preliminary burps, an obscene gesture or
two to the audience, and a last minute touch to a slimy
ducktail, they break out into their namesake song "Get
A Job."
The very words of the refrain are indicative of the
carefree, non-relevant, nearly non-musical, nonsensical
world that was the fifties: "yib-yib-yib-yib-yib/yob-yob
yob-yob/get-a-job/ sha-na-na-na-sha-na-na-na-na."
The sounds of "wa-doo" and
"ram-a-lam-a-ding-dong" echoed through Winterland last
Saturday night for over an hour, and the crowd loved it.
Certainly half of Sha Na Na's sell is their
showmanship. Who else comes complete with three
choreographic hoodlums wearing painfully tight gold
pants and gold vests daringly unbuttoned to reveal
profusely masculine (and hairy) chests.
Either they are a maze of flailing arms, kicking legs,
and somersaulting bodies, or else, in the quiet mellow
moments of a slong like "Tell Laura I Love Her" they
are passionately praying on their knees in a makeshift
chapel constructed of human bodies.
During the wild, fast numbers like "Whole Lot A

Shakin' Goin' On" or "Rock Around the Clock," the
rule of "use the stage" is followed to the letter. Each
line of the song is sung by a man who is 25 feet from the
nearest microphone only four beats before his bar.
Suddenly he has leapt across the stage, landed upright,
assumed a melodramatic pose, snatched the microphone
from an airborne partner, and he is crooning away.
The piano player, Screamin' Scot Simon, played lying
on his stomach, on his back, standing on the keyboard,
and he did everything but dismantle the poor piano.
No one dared to tackle Bowzer (the bass singer) when
he spat viciously and stalked the stage looking for
adversaries before climaxing the finish of "Blue Moon"
with an abyssmally low E flat. And nobody talked back
during "Yakkety-Yak" either.
The inevitable Elvis number, "Jailhouse Rock," was a
big hit, with one of the men in the skin tight gold suits
oiling his posterior suggestively back and forth while the
spotlight played chameleon, creating dancing pelvic
penumbras.
The whole crowd wept for the protagonist of "Why
Must I Be A Teenager In Love," who almost choked to
death in the midst of racking sobs.
A raucous and rowdy audience demanded four
encores, and they were favored with "Great Balls Of
Fire," "Lovers Never Say Goodbye," "Hound Dog," and
of course the classic 'message' song of the night: "Rock

And Roll Is Here To Stay."
The boys from the Eisenhower Era were preceded by
Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen.
The Commander proved that he "still had it in his left
hand" by pounding out the notes on his piano to the
traditional boogie tune "Rock That Boogie." The
Ancient Mariner (as he was affectionately called by his
mates) looked less as if he were playing piano than
dog-paddling.
The Airmen also tickled the crowd with "There's A
Riot Goin' On" — something we haven't heard much of
this year at Stanford. And the audience pleaded for, and
eventually received their favorite — "Hot Rod Lincoln."
Also sharing the stage was a group called the Steeleye
Span. They sang traditional English folk music from way
back when (like 16th century) I thought they were
excellent, but their style of music, which included
singing in Latin, didn't give too well with the tastes of a
Sha Na Na audience.
All in all the evening was exhilarating, and exhausting,
I am not going to any more concerts that require
audience participation. I followed Commander Codys
advice and I ended up with a slipped disc:
Shake it to the east/
Shake it to the west/
Shake it to the one that you love best/
Put your hand on your hip/
And let your backbone slip.
