# Sextet Gives Spirited Performance
## 
### DOUG SMITH 
There is a considerable
repertory of chamber music for
five and six stringed instruments
which is very seldom played in
concert. Since some of these
pieces are among the finest music
ever composed, string quartets
occasionally invite a violist or
cellist to join them for a
performance, but we nevertheless
do not hear this music enough.
The New York String Sextet
was organized to fill this gap, and
they have done so admirably.
Luigi Boccherini, an Italian
contemporary of Mozart who was
himself a performing cellist,
produced about a hundred cello
quintets, over twenty viola
quintets and seven string sextets,
and almost none of these are
recorded or performed today.
This is a shame, since I
personally find Boccherini
extremely charming and
sophisticated. I once was
informed by a professional string
ensemble that string players
would rather play Haydn or
Mozart because the Italian did not
write very rewardingly for the
inner parts.
Much Dialogue
This was certainly not the case
with his Quintet for two violins,
viola and two cellos in F minor,
Op. 13 No. 4, which dates from
1771 (No. 274 in the recent

Boccherini catalog). Solo passages
were liberally passed around to all
five participants, and there was a
good deal of dialogue between the
violins and the lower strings.
The quintet begins with a
Larghetto in minor and is
followed by a major mode Vivace.
The New York group made lush
sounds in the first movement and
played very spiritedly in the
Vivace. There were some
intonation problems in high
registers, and some members of
the ensemble continued to offend
periodically throughout the
evening, but this is normal for
string groups, even those of the
highest caliber.
The Minuetto featured an
attractive solo for the first viola,
and the Trio had all five
instruments chirping in high

registers, which had a delightfully
humorous effect. The quintet
finished with a Presto.
Masterpiece
The second musical offering
was Mozart's Quintet in C major
(K. 515). This is one of the
greatest masterpieces of chamber
music and the Sextet (minus one
cello) gave an intelligent and very
musical, if rather forceful
interpretation.
My old recording of the Griller
Quartet and William Primrose
emphasizes the lyrical and
quasi-romantic yearning aspects of
this piece, but the present group
explored its dynamism. I prefer
the former, however looks at
different sides are not only valid
but desirable. Chacun son gout.
One of the special delights of
the New York String Sextet is its

first cellist, Janos Scholz. He is
the very image of a kindly,
civilized English pubkeeper
contemplating a bottle of fine
wine which he is about to imbibe.
Scholz's facial expression while
playing is first content, then
wistful with wrinkled brow, and
now beaming with pleasure.
So often an entire group will
remain apparently impassive, with
the first violinist only occasionally
surging into grim passion during
appropriate passages. Thus
Scholz's expressions and the
comedy of the world-famous
violist Paul Doktor swatting at a
fly on his knee between
movements added a human
element to this recital.
â€¢Highlight
The evening closed with the
full sextet on Brahms' second

string sextet, Op. 36. For me the
highlight of it was the Scherzo,
with the performers producing
especially lovely, brilliant but
warm sound, and exciting
rhythms in the presto giocoso
section.
The ensemble is an interesting
combination of older, experienced
men (the three first desk players)
and three younger, less-known
women. All played more than
competently.
On Saturday they will return
to Dinkelspiel for a Haydn sextet,
Schoenberg's lovely Transfigured
Night and Schubert's C major
quintet, which is one of his last
and best works. The audience on
Tuesday was scandalously sparse;
any lover of chamber music who
misses Saturday's performance
should receive thirty lashes.
