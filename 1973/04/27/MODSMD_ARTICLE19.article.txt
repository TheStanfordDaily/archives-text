# Beach Boys Excel At Winter land
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
The saviors of surfing returned
to San Francisco Thursday night
and thrilled a large Winterland
audience with what was perhaps
the finest musical performance
I've attended this year. From the
first notes of "Help Me, Rhonda,"
to the end of "Barbara Ann,"
which finished their second
encore well over an hour later, the
Beachboys provided the ultimate
in entertainment.
Not since Mick Jagger and the
Stones made their long-awaited
appearance here last June have I
so thoroughly enjoyed a
Winterland show. The Beachboys
have become the target of an
increasing amount of cynicism
over the past few years, but I

think their performance last week
might have changed the mind of
even the biggest skeptic.
The Beachboys are not a group
of opportunistic Southern
Californians who exploited a craze
of the mid-60's to their own

Entertainment

personal advantage. They are a
group of talented musicians who
have continued to mature and
progress musically, while many of
the self-acclaimed "heavies" have
stagnated.
The true mark of what real

entertainers the Beachboys are is
their willingness to play the songs
which made them famous and
which many people paid their
money to hear. Many groups
would consider it below
themselves to dip back into their

oldie goldies, but the Beachboys
have enough class to integrate
their classics of the 60's with the
products of their mature period of
the last few years.
Holland Album
Some of their best numbers

Thursday night came from their
"Holland" album recorded last
year including "Pisces Lady,"
"Leaving This Town," and the
extremely nice ' California Saga."
The group is now composed of
nine members and among the
newer members, Blondie Chaplin
is an outstanding guitarist/
vocalist. But despite their
expansion, the group had little
trouble performing nearly flawless
renditions of almost all their hits.
The list was endless but the better
numbers included "Back Together
Again," "Sloop John B," "Surfing
USA" and "Good Vibrations."
The Beachboys were called
back for two, three-number
encores by a wildly excited crowd
and graciously took requests from

the audience. They ended up
playing "Get Around," "Fun,
Fun, Fun," "California Girls,"
"Surfer Girl," the aforementioned
"Barbara Ann" and believe it or
not, a fine version of "Jumpin'
Jack Flash" in which vocalist
Mike Love did an absolutely
fantastic imitation of Jagger.
After the encores, the crowd kept
pleading for more, but the
exhausted Beachboys knew they
might end up playing all night.
Satisfied Audience
In a break from the usual
Winterland style, the crowd didn't
start booing and swearing when
the Beachboys failed to come
back for a third encore and
perhaps this is as good a gauge as
any of how satisfied the audience
was.
The Beachboys were preceded
by Jesse Colin Young, whose
voice was the trademark of the
old Youngbloods, and Young gave
an anxious crowd a very
refreshing set of country rock.
Young plays with four solid
musicians and he is equally adept
at singing and playing a variety of
acoustic and electric guitars.
Young did some of the
Youngbloods' better numbers
including the beautiful
"Sunlight." But he also did an
outstanding job on some great
country rockers including the
classic truckdriving number "Six
Days On The Road" and a version
of Hank Williams' "Jambalaya,"
which makes the John Fogerty
version seem even worse than it

already is. Young finished up his
set with a well-paced "Heard It
Through The Grapevine."
Even the cartoons between
Young's and Beachboys' sets were
unusually good. Bugs Bunny's
"Hare Remover," and Woody

Woodpecker's "Niagara Fools" are
two of the funnier cartoons ever
shown at Winterland. All in all, it
was an outstanding evening of
entertainment. To sum it up, I'm
waxin' down my surfboard; I
can't wait for June.
