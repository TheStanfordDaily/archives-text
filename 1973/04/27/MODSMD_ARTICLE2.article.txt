# Director States Carnegie Report Not Applicable
## Placement Center Unharmed By Job Cuts 
### JAMES LOBSENZ 
Although a recent Carnegie
Commission report on "Graduates and
Jobs" warns that the job outlook for
Ph.D. holders is "dismal" and
becoming "increasingly unfavorable,"
the director of the Stanford Placement
Center, Ralph Keller, asserts that
although "this has been a national
problem, it has not been a Stanford
problem."
Keller states that while there have

been some cutbacks in the University's
programs, there has been "not so
much as you might expect. We really
have not had any trouble."
"A Stanford degree does make a
difference," maintains Keller, simply
because "Stanford has been rather
stringent about its entrance
requirements for students seeking any
degree. Thus the student at Stanford
has an edge on a large part because
they were people who were carefully
selected by Stanford in the first place.
As a consequence of this they have
stood up in the competition for jobs
extremely well."
Similary, though, the Carnegie
report says that tne job outlook for
secondary and elementary school
teaching positions is worse this year
than last, and has been progressively
worsening since 1969.. Keller says that
graduates of STEP (Stanford Teacher
Education Program) have not had any
problems finding employment.)
'Over 70 Percent'
"Year after year more of our
teachers have been placed. Well over
70 percent of the people in STEP find
jobs." Keller claims that "we could
triple the number of people in the
program and still place the same
percentage of them."
The main problem area for the
Placement Center has centered around
undergraduates who are obtaining a
baccalaureate degree in the liberal arts
areas and are not planning to go on to
graduate school.
The Carnegie report states that
"historically, education has fitted
itself to occupational requirements,"
but with less college graduates going
on to graduate school immediately
after graduation, there has developed
some concern that the concept of a

liberal arts education may be in some
danger.
"I don't think there is any
question," states Keller, "but that a
good liberal arts education is
important, especially for the
individuals own satisfaction. But at the
same time I don't think that we should
so narrowly define a liberal arts
education as to say that in the process
of getting that education you don't
learn some specific things as well.
Two Educations
"Any young man who intends to
finish a four-year program at Stanford
needs to think in terms of achieving
two kinds of education—a good liberal
arts education and at the same time,
an education that allows that
individual to earn a living."
Keller advocates a better utilization
of "the difference between the
number of units needed for a major
and 180 units." He believes that over a
period of four years most students
could do a much better job of
preparing themselves for employment
opportunities then they have been
doing in the past.
At the same time Keller cautions
that students, especially freshman,
should not feel pressured into deciding
on a career choice before they have
even cracked a book.
"We have too many examples of
people who have decided too early
about what they want to do, and later
on they find themselves miserable
because they don't like doing what
they're doing."
"We have people," Keller states,
"who have completed law school and
who come in and say they don't want
to be a lawyer."
Placement Center Role
Keller asserts that the role of the
Placement Center is to get these

people thinking earlier about their
career choices so that they won't find
themselves stranded in fields they
dislike.
Part of the problem of students
being unprepared for job requirements
concedes Keller, is that many plan to
attend graduate school to obtain the
specific work skills they need, and
then in the wake of soaring tuition
costs, find that they cannot afford it.
Keller's opinion of the Carnegie
report is that while it is "reasonably
accurate," it "doesn't say much that's
new."
The report's main conclusion, as
Keller sees it, is that we should not cut
back on the number of people getting
college degrees, but rather that we try
to tailor the education process more to
the needs of the job market and vice
versa.
Better Job Market
The report states that the job
market now, is in better shape than it
has been in the last four years. Keller's
appraisal of the market is a little more
cautious. He maintains that it is better
than any time in the last two years.
Prospects are brightest for students
in the fields of health care, and
industrial management and
accounting, according to the Carnegie
report. The outlook for most
engineering students is fairly bright
too.
The report states, however, that
underemployment will be a large
problem. Underemployment simply is
the term used to describe the situation
of persons employed in positions that
do not make full use of their talents
and knowledge. The Carnegie
Commission estimates somewhere
between 1 million and 1.5 million

JOB OUTLOOKS—RaIph Keller, Director of the Placement Center, maintains
that despite a tight job market, Stanford Ph.D. holders fair better than most, and
graduates of the Stanford Teachers Education Program can still find jobs.
Though he admits that liberal art students generally have a tougher time in the
job market, he believes that no matter what the student's field is, "a Stanford
degree does make a difference."
college graduates of the 1970s will be
underemployed.
Keller asserts that this is especially
a problem for young women college
graduates who don't go on to graduate
school. "Unfortunately," laments
Keller, "there has been a tendency to
cut back on the amount of education
that employers insist on having, simply
because they have learned that
employing highly trained people
results in having dissatisfied
employees. Therefore they have
tended to hire down."
"We may be approaching the day
where blue collar workers are higher
salaried than white collar workers,"
states Keller.
Keller believes that the conception

of what constitutes a contribution to
society is undergoing "evolutionary
change." "I'm not so sure that going
to college is the only choice today for
a high school graduate."
"There was a time," Keller
observes, "when success was defined as
completing a college education, getting
a good job, having a high standard of
living and many expensive
possessions." But todays students have
observed "that hasn't solved many
problems, but it has created some."
Sixteen percent of all persons from
ages 18 to 24 were in college in 1960.
By 1980 the figure is expected to
double. It has been suggested by
several educators, including two
researchers at Syracuse University,
Lawrence B. Dewitt and A. Dale
Tussing, that the increase is related to
a sociological phenomenon. They
claim that there is a lack of any
socially acceptable alternative to
college facing the youth of America.
"We assert, that if a socially legitimate
alternative to college existed, fewer
persons would enroll in college."
Dewitt and Tussing claim that the
armed forces used to function as a
viable alternative, but does no longer.
In the face of the increase of the
U.S. college population the Carnegie
report counsels that the number of
students attending four year colleges
should not be reduced, but rather that
colleges adapt to the demands of the
job market with more alacrity.
"Surpluses of college graduates"
maintains the report, "should be
considered an enormous national asset
rather than a liability."
