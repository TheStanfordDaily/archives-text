## Shockley: 'Review My Theories' 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C. - Charging that "in effect, I am
accused of heresy," Nobel Laureate William Shockley
will again ask the National Academy of Sciences to
review his assertions that heredity largely controls
human intelligence quotients (IQ).
In a paper contributed to the NAS meeting in
Washington this week, Shockley also maintains that
"intelligence for Negro hybrids increases with Caucasian
ancestry" but that "such results are obscured by social
psychologists."
Shockley says data on Causcasion blood-type genes
and Army mental tests indicate that "for low IQ
[Negro] populations each one percent of Caucasian
ancestry raises average IQ one IQ point," up to a
presently undetermined point of diminishing returns. His
research has been published during the past two years in
the Proceedings of the NAS and the Phi Delta Kappan
magazine.
"It is not humane but instead irresponsible to avoid
diagnosis of genetic factors in our nation's human
quality problems," he states in a letter distributed this
week to 12,000 members of the Forum for
Contemporary History.
In a letter sent last month to NAS President Philip

Handler, Shockley said he would again ask his colleagues
to examine evidence from a study of 244 identical
Caucasian twins, reared separately, suggesting that 80
percent of the variance in IQ stems from genetic rather
than environmental factors.
During the business sessions of the Academy meeting,
scheduled April 23-25 in Washington, Shockley plans for
the fourth time to move a resolution calling for
evaluation of his research indicating there is only one
chance in 2000 that his 80 percent estimate is erroneous.
Shockley has called the NAS previous failure to study
this question "the most serious and obvious dereliction
of intellectual responsibility in the history of science."
In his letter to members of the Forum for
Contemporary History, Shockley observes that "during
the 1960s our nation moved toward quantity control [of
population] by using birth control, including abortion,
to balance progress in death control through technology
and medicine.
"But what about human quality control? My message
here is that quality problems are scientifically accessible
but that inquiry is, in effect, suppressed."
He anticipates that the outcome of the NAS meeting

"will be one more demonstration of thought blocks,
taboos in science, in effect, the suppression of inquiry
by discouraging it."
Last October, in response to Shockley's statements,
the NAS established a group to report on human
behavioral genetics, but he predicts they will avoid
analysis of his 80 percent IQ geneticity assertion.
Coinventor of the transistor and holder of the
endowed Alexander M. Poniatoff professorship of
engineering science at Stanford, Shockely was informed
in February that the University of Leeds had withdrawn
a proffered honorary doctor of science degree.
In a guest column published in the London Times
Higher Education Supplement March 15, he called this
action an example of "humanism gone berserk."
He reiterated his views that, for Caucasians, "gene
differences have four times more effect inpushing IQ
scores up and down than do environmental differences."
The denial by his academic colleagues of this
proposition "discourages research on such agonizing
social problems as genetic limitations for the homeless
young blacks of London," he added. "When humanism
thwarts diagnosis of social ills, it has gone berserk."
