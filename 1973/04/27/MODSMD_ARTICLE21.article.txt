# GSB Receives $250,000 Grant
## 
### 
The Graduate School of
Business has received a $250,000
grant from the Ford Foundation
to expand its recently established
urban management program.
The Business School is one of
eight U.S. institutions selected to
receive Ford Foundation grants
totaling $2,550,000 to train
public policy analysts. Stanford is
the only business school included.
According to Henry S. Rowen,
director of urban management at
the Business School, the funds
will be used for faculty expansion
and course development. Faculty
additions will include a political
scientist and others who have
worked in policy formulation in
government.
The urban management
program was established in 1971
as a study option within the
School's two-year MBA (master of

business administration) program.
First-year urban management
students follow the regular
business administration
curriculum, supplementing
business courses with studies in
political processes. Second-year
students concentrate on the study
of public rather than business
management problems. The first
class of urban management
students will graduate in June.
The grant brings to $875,000
the amount the School has
received in support of the urban
management program.
Other recipients of the Ford
Foundation grants are the schools
of public policy at UC-Berkeley,
Carnegie-Mellon University,
Harvard University, University of
Michigan, University of Texas,
Duke University, and the Rand
Corp.
