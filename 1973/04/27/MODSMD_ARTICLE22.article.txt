# JV Awaits Baseball Showdown
## 
### 
Despite a nearly catastrophic
midseason slump, the junior
varsity baseball team currently
occupies first place in the Bay
Area Collegiate League and may
be on its way to Stanford's fourth
championship in the nine year
history of the frosh-soph league.
Coach Mark Marquess' JV,
14-5 in league play and 22-13
overall, will face California in a
three game series this weekend
before concluding the season next
Tuesday and Thursday with games
against Santa Clara. The third
place Bears are 9-5 in the league
and the Broncos sport an 11-5
mark and a second place league
standing.
Today's 2:30 p.m. contest at
the Stanford Frosh Diamond
against Cal will be Stanford's final
home game. Tomorrow the Cards
will travel to Berkeley for a noon
doubleheader.
"If we can win two of three
from Cal we should eliminate
them from contention," Marquess
said, "but Santa Clara still would
have a good shot since they play
us twice and have four games
against USF [easily the weakest
team in the five team league]."
Marquess attributes Stanford's
recent success to the hitting of
first baseman Gary Morton and
third baseman John Burtchaell
and to a solid trio of pitchers,
Mike Williamson, Bernie Hitner,
and Jim Dudley.
Morton, a sophomore who
didn't even start regularly on last
year's JV, "has improved 200
percent," according to Marquess
and "may step right in on next
year's varsity." Morton is hitting
well over .400 and has driven in
13 runs in Stanford's last two
games.
The JV started the season with
a talent-laden squad which
included Dave Baker, Steve Davis,
Ray Anderson, and Bruce
Robinson, all of whom have since
been brought up to the varsity.
"When we lost those guys
originally we lost five straight
games on. a trip down south,"
Marquess said, "but when we
came back we won a league
doubleheader and everybody
seemed to pick up the slack."
