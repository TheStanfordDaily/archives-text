### VLAE KERSHNER 
Stanford's tennis team has
placed four players in the
quarterfinals of the Ojai
Intercollegiate Tennis
Tournament's Pac-8 division.
The four, Sandy Mayer, Jim
Delaney, Rick Fisher, and John
Whitlinger, join two players from
both USC and UCLA in the battle
for West Coast singles supremacy.
The victories in the first two
rounds have made Stanford the
favorite for its second straight
Ojai team title.
Mayer, after a first-round bye,
topped USC's John Holladay in a
tough 7-6, 5-7, 6-3 second-round
match.
Delaney, who also was not

paired in the first round of the
division, which includes 24
players, beat Cal's Steve Bartlett
6-2, 7-5 in the second round.
Whitlinger won his second
match against USC's Mike
Wayman in less than a week,
beating the English star 6-3, 6-3 in
the first round. Whitlinger then
won a key match in the second
round against an injured Bob
Kreiss of UCLA, 6-2, default.
Rick Fisher, the third Stanford
player to receive a first round bye,
is also still alive after downing
USC's Sashi Menon 6-3, 6-4 in the
second round.
Chip Fisher beat UCLA's
Rayno Seegers 7-6, default in the
first round, but lost to USC's

John Andrews 6-4, 6-3 in the
second round.
The sixth Stanford entrant, Pat
DuPre, topped Cal's Manuel
Casteneda 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 in the
opening round, but then bowed to
UCLA's Steve Krulevitz 6-2, 3-6,
7-6 in the next round.
Andrews, Krulevitz, USC's
Raul Ramirez, and UCLA's Jeff
Austin thus join the four Stanford
players in today's quarterfinal
matches. Semifinals and finals will
be held tomorrow and Sunday.
In doubles play, Stanford's
Rick Fisher and Gery Groslimond
drew a first-round bye and will
begin play tomorrow. Sandy

remain in the tourney, beating

Cal's Caro-Clancy team 6-4, 6-1.
Cal, USC, UCLA, and Stanford
are the only four schools entered
in the Pac-8 division.
The Ojai tournament can be
classed as "round three" in the
battle for tennis supremacy
between Stanford, USC, and
UCLA. Stanford won round one
at the National Indoor
tournament and the round two
dual matches ended in a standoff.
Three members of the Stanford
women's team are entered in the
women's division but their results
were not available at press time.
