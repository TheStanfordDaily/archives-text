# Stanford Meets USC In Baseball Rematch
## Big Problem For Cards 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Baseball coach Ray Young has
had a lot of problems to contend
with lately. His Cardinal team has
won only three of nine Pacific
Eight games, Stanford's formerly
reliable pitching staff showed
signs of weakening last weekend
against Cal, and Tuesday the
Cards suffered a rare non-league
defeat at Cal State Hayward.
This weekend, though, those
things won't even enter Young's
mind since the biggest problem in
Pac-8 baseball will be sitting in the
opposing dugout — the USC
Trojans.
Young's slumping Cardinals
will meet Ron Dedeaux's
streaking Trojans in a three game
series at Bovard Field in Los
Angeles. A single game is
scheduled for 2:30 p.m. today
with a noon doubleheader set for
tomorrow.
Stanford, now 3-6 in the league
and 26-15 overall, is certainly no
match statistically for the
defending national champions,
who sport a 7-1 record in Pac-8
play, a 29-7 overall mark, and a
number one national ranking. But
two weeks ago at Sunken
Diamond the two teams played

remarkably even baseball in a
three game series, the Trojans
winning 2-1 and 3-0 and the Cards
taking a 1-0 decision in the first
game of Saturday's doubleheader.
Few More Runs
"We can't play too much
better than we did two weeks
ago," Young said Wednesday after
the Cards shutout San Francisco
State 6-0. "I just hope we can
score a few more runs."
The Cardinal bats have come
alive since the USC series* but
during the same period the
pitching staff has gone from
reliable to unpredictable. The
Cards have raked opposing
pitchers for 39 runs in seven
games since the USC series but the
pitching staff allowed 33 runs in
six games before Ken Grolle, Max
Goldstein, and Bob DiPietro
combined for Wednesday's fiverhit
shutout over San Francisco State.
Grolle got the victory in
Wednesday's game, improving his
record to 4-4. A first inning home
run by Dave Baker and a two-hit,
two-RBI performance by Bob
Hampton provided most of the
offensive punch. Tuesday against
Cal State Hayward, the Cards
trailed 6-0 in the fifth inning and

a late comeback fell short, 6-4.
Young will send Dan Shaw
(5-4, 2.45) to the mound this
afternoon with Bob DiPietro (4-1,
1.66) scheduled to pitch the first
game of tomorrow's
doubleheader. A 1 Arthur (5-2,
1.89) will get his first Pac-8 start
in the nightcap.
USC's Dedeaux will counter
with the same three pitchers who
faced the Cards at Sunken
Diamond. Dedeaux, who coaches
for a token salary estimated at $1
a year and says "I'm the only
employee of the university who
can cash his paycheck on the
Vermont Avenue bus," will send
Randy Scarbery (8-1, 1.22) to the
mound this afternoon with Russ
McQeen (3-2,1.67) and Mike Barr
(6-0, 1.12) listed as tomorrow's
hurlers.

faced the Cards at Sunken
Diamond. Dedeaux, who coaches
for a token salary estimated at $1

OUT FOR REVENGE — Senior righthander Dan Shaw, who two
weeks ago lost a 2-1 decision to USC at Sunken Diamond, will be on
the mound this afternoon when the Cards meet the Trojans in Los
Angeles. Bob DiPietro and A 1 Arthur will pitch in tomorrow's
doubleheader.
Baseball coach Ray Young has
had a lot of problems to contend
with lately. His Cardinal team has
won only three of nine Pacific
Eight games, Stanford's formerly
reliable pitching staff showed
signs of weakening last weekend
against Cal, and Tuesday the
Cards suffered a rare non-league
defeat at Cal State Hayward.
This weekend, though, those
things won't even enter Young's
mind since the biggest problem in
Pac-8 baseball will be sitting in the
opposing dugout — the USC
Trojans.
Young's slumping Cardinals
will meet Ron Dedeaux's
streaking Trojans in a three game
series at Bovard Field in Los
Angeles. A single game is
scheduled for 2:30 p.m. today
with a noon doubleheader set for
tomorrow.
Stanford, now 3-6 in the league
and 26-15 overall, is certainly no
match statistically for the
defending national champions,
who sport a 7-1 record in Pac-8
play, a 29-7 overall mark, and a
number one national ranking. But
two weeks ago at Sunken
Diamond the two teams played

remarkably even baseball in a
three game series, the Trojans
winning 2-1 and 3-0 and the Cards
taking a 1-0 decision in the first
game of Saturday's doubleheader.
Few More Runs
"We can't play too much
better than we did two weeks
ago," Young said Wednesday after
the Cards shutout San Francisco
State 6-0. "I just hope we can
score a few more runs."
The Cardinal bats have come
alive since the USC series* but
during the same period the
pitching staff has gone from
reliable to unpredictable. The
Cards have raked opposing
pitchers for 39 runs in seven
games since the USC series but the
pitching staff allowed 33 runs in
six games before Ken Grolle, Max
Goldstein, and Bob DiPietro
combined for Wednesday's fiverhit
shutout over San Francisco State.
Grolle got the victory in
Wednesday's game, improving his
record to 4-4. A first inning home
run by Dave Baker and a two-hit,
two-RBI performance by Bob
Hampton provided most of the
offensive punch. Tuesday against
Cal State Hayward, the Cards
trailed 6-0 in the fifth inning and

a late comeback fell short, 6-4.
Young will send Dan Shaw
(5-4, 2.45) to the mound this
afternoon with Bob DiPietro (4-1,
1.66) scheduled to pitch the first
game of tomorrow's
doubleheader. A 1 Arthur (5-2,
1.89) will get his first Pac-8 start
in the nightcap.
USC's Dedeaux will counter
with the same three pitchers who
faced the Cards at Sunken
Diamond. Dedeaux, who coaches
for a token salary estimated at $1
a year and says "I'm the only
employee of the university who
can cash his paycheck on the
