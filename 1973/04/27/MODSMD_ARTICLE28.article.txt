# Cardinals Grab Early Lead In Collegiate Golf Tourney
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
It was so dark last night when
first round play ended in the U.S.
Collegiate Invitational golf
tournament that you needed a
flashlight to read the scoreboard.
Five playersin the mammouth
field of 204 golfers failed to
complete first round play because
of the darkness, but the
scoreboard revealed that
everything else went pretty much
as expected in the first round of
the 54 hole tournament.
Stanford took the opening day
lead with a 289 total and San Jose
State and Washington shared
second at 301. The only real
surprise was the individual leader.
Cal State Hayward's Bill Malley
grabbed that honor with a three
under par 68, one stroke ahead of
Stanford senior Denny Colvin.
Malley's round featured a pair
of inconsistent nine hole totals.
After a one over par 37 on the
front nine, Malley rallied with a
brilliant four under par 31 on the
back side for his 68.
Front Nine 31
Malley's round, however,
seemed conventional compared to

total.
Stanford's 289 score (team
scores are compiled by adding the
low four individual scores from
each six-man team) was the result
of Colvin's 69, Dave Baskins' 71,
George Pettinger's 74, and Aly
Trompas' 75.
Colvin birdied six holes in his
two under par performance,
offsetting a double bogey on the
sixth hole and a costly three-putt
from six feet on 15. "I really hit
the "ball well on the back side,"
Colvin said. "Except for my
second shot on 18 (a two iron),
every shot was right on the flag."
'Satisfying Par'
The two iron on 18 hooked
into a sand trap but Colvin blasted
out three feet from the hole and
sank the putt for what he later
called a "very satisfying par."
Baskins, who said the course
was playing uncharacteristically
easy since the fairways were hard
and the greens were soft, carded
14 pars, two birdies and two
bogeys in his consistent, even par
round.
Stanford's non-counting scores
were Conrad Nilmeier (76) and
Bob Chapman (77). The Card JV
will be in seventh place if Tom
Phillips (one of those who didn't
finish) makes no worse than
bogeys on the final two holes
when the five non-finishers trek
out to the 17th tee at 5 a.m.
tomorrow.
The leading JV scores so far
were John Beers (75) and Bob
Harrington (76) while Dick
Mitchell and Wade Nonnenberg
carded 79s to lead the freshman
team to a 318 total, good for 20th
place.
After today's second round,
the field will be trimmed to the
low 16 teams and all individuals
within 10 shots of the leader.

his teammate Mike Powers.
Powers shot a five under par 31
on the difficult front nine,
including an eagle two on the 412
yard par four sixth hole. Powers
added birdies on one, seven, and
nine for his 31 before skying to a
40 on the back side.
Malley and Powers' scores
offset an otherwise
undistinguished performance by
Cal State Hayward, leaving the
team in fourth place with a 303

LAGUNA SECA SEASON OPENS — Special student discount tickets are now on sale at the Tresidder Box Office for the third running of the
L&M Championship at Laguna Seca on May 4-6. At last year's L&M race Graham Mcßae (left) and Brett Lunger (right) finished 1-2 and both
will be back for this year's running. After practice on Friday May 4, qualifying and regional races on Saturday, and two qualifying heats Sunday
morning, the featured L&M race will get underway at 2:35 p.m. Sunday.
It was so dark last night when
first round play ended in the U.S.
Collegiate Invitational golf
tournament that you needed a
flashlight to read the scoreboard.
Five playersin the mammouth
field of 204 golfers failed to
complete first round play because
of the darkness, but the
scoreboard revealed that
everything else went pretty much
as expected in the first round of
the 54 hole tournament.
Stanford took the opening day
lead with a 289 total and San Jose
State and Washington shared
second at 301. The only real
surprise was the individual leader.
Cal State Hayward's Bill Malley
grabbed that honor with a three
under par 68, one stroke ahead of
Stanford senior Denny Colvin.
Malley's round featured a pair
of inconsistent nine hole totals.
After a one over par 37 on the
front nine, Malley rallied with a
brilliant four under par 31 on the
back side for his 68.
Front Nine 31
Malley's round, however,
seemed conventional compared to

total.
Stanford's 289 score (team
scores are compiled by adding the
low four individual scores from
each six-man team) was the result
of Colvin's 69, Dave Baskins' 71,
George Pettinger's 74, and Aly
Trompas' 75.
Colvin birdied six holes in his
two under par performance,
offsetting a double bogey on the
sixth hole and a costly three-putt
from six feet on 15. "I really hit
the "ball well on the back side,"
Colvin said. "Except for my
second shot on 18 (a two iron),
every shot was right on the flag."
'Satisfying Par'
The two iron on 18 hooked
into a sand trap but Colvin blasted
out three feet from the hole and
sank the putt for what he later
called a "very satisfying par."
Baskins, who said the course
was playing uncharacteristically
easy since the fairways were hard
and the greens were soft, carded
14 pars, two birdies and two
bogeys in his consistent, even par
round.
Stanford's non-counting scores
were Conrad Nilmeier (76) and
Bob Chapman (77). The Card JV
will be in seventh place if Tom
Phillips (one of those who didn't
finish) makes no worse than
bogeys on the final two holes
when the five non-finishers trek
out to the 17th tee at 5 a.m.
tomorrow.
The leading JV scores so far
were John Beers (75) and Bob
Harrington (76) while Dick
Mitchell and Wade Nonnenberg
carded 79s to lead the freshman
team to a 318 total, good for 20th
place.
After today's second round,
the field will be trimmed to the
low 16 teams and all individuals
within 10 shots of the leader.

Powers shot a five under par 31
on the difficult front nine,
including an eagle two on the 412
yard par four sixth hole. Powers
added birdies on one, seven, and
nine for his 31 before skying to a
40 on the back side.
