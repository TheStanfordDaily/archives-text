# 13 Stanford Spikers Compete This Weekend
## Low Times Expected At Mt. SAC Relays 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
A 13-man contingent from the
Stanford track squad travels to
Walnut today and tomorrow for
the Mt. San Antonio College Relays*
With the thrill of last week's near
upset of USC still lingering and
the excellent facilities at Mt. SAC,
the meet could produce the best
times of the season.
In the individual events, Ken
Curl comes into the meet in the
100 following last week's
impressive double victory in that
event and the 220. He has run 9.6
so far this year. Dave Bagshaw ran
a lifetime best of 14.3 in the high
hurdles at last year's meet, and
will be trying to better his 14.2
mark of this season.
Matt Hogsett will be running
the intermediate hurdles for the
Cards. In last week's competition,
he was running well, and seemed
to be in excellent position to take
an upset victory when he lost his
step at the eighth hurdle and hit it
badly. He still managed to take
third in 54.0, just one second
slower than his all time best.
Near Four-Minute Mark
Brian Mittelstaedt and Les
McFadden, who finished 1-2 in
the mile against USC, will be
running that event Saturday. Both
have run their all-time bests this
year, and both are close to the
magic four-minute mark.
Mittelstaedt has run 4:04.9, as
well as the team's fastest
two-mile, an 8:50.2. McFadden
has a 4:05.7 mile to his credit.
Mark McConnell will be
running the 5000 meters, which is
roughly three miles. McConnell
has run lifetime bests of 9:03.6 in
the two-mile and 13:59.2 in the
three mile so far this year. Tony
Sandoval will be running the
10,000 meters. He is the team's
leader in the three-mile so far this

year with a 13:48.8 clocking.
In the field events, Jim Howard
will be throwing the discus.
Howard leads Stanford's discus
throwers with a 174-2 toss this
season. The discus is probably the
team's strongest event as the
Cards' 1-2-3-4 sweep in the SC
meet testifies.
Utley, Albritton Compete
Stanford's entry in the triple
jump will be Rod Utley. Utley

won last week's competition on
his last jump with a season's best
of 49-9'/i. His lifetime best is 50-2.
Terry Albritton, who has
dominated his shotput opponents
all year as well as setting a
Stanford record with a 61-5V4
heave, will be one of the favorites
in the shotput.
Ken Kring will be getting little
rest this weekend, as he is
scheduled to compete in the

decathlon, a two-day competition
with five events each day. The
decathlon will be run in the Pac-8
for the first time this year, and
Kring should be one of the leading
contenders for the conference
title.
The mile relay, which has been
a little weak for the Cards this
year, will be run by John
Anderson, Ken Curl, Dave
Bagshaw, and Matt Hogsett.
Stanford's distance medley will
feature Anderson, Mittelstaedt,
McFadden, and Vernell Jackson.
The Stanford junior varsity
ended a perfect season Wednesday
afternoon by defeating West
Valley 71-60 and Foothill 71-38.
The JV finished the season 7-0
against area colleges.

Highlights of the last meet
included a 1:55.2 win for Jim
Bordoni in the 880. His best
previous mark was a second
slower. Varsity hurdler Dave
Bagshaw ran the intermediates for
practice and won with a personal
best of 53.7.
Bruce Henry had a lifetime
best of 22.9 in taking second in
the 220. Terry Albritton had a
personal best in the discus with a
158" toss for the win. Dick Day
and Dan Graham were 3-4 in the
mile at 4:23.4 and 4:24
Jack Bellah led a 1-2-3
Stanford finish in the three mile
with a 14:18. Teammates Art
Brown and Doug McLean both
had lifetime bests of 15:00 and
15:20.
