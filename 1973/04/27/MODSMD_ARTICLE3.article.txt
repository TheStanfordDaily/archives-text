# The 						Farm' Lives On By Rec Center

### KITTY PATTERSON 
The Farm is alive and flourishing behind the
Faculty Recreation Center on Bowdoin St.
If you drive along there any afternoon, you'll see
about an acre of plowed land. At least a dozen
people will be digging, spraying and watering their
plots.
Students living in Escondido Village share the
land with Columbae, Ecology and Jordan House.
Escondido Maintenance has cordoned off the
two-thirds closest to the Recreation Center into
198 plotes, 13 by 19 feet each, to be used
exclusively by Escondido Village residents.
The independent houses cultivate 12 large
plots on the rest of the land.
Milk Cartons
Most of the gardeners are growing fruits and
vegetables. The land looks pretty barren now; more
milk cartons, which protect seedlings, are visible
than plants.
But in a few months, potatoes, beans and lettuce
will spring up. By Halloween, there will even by
some pumpkin patches.
Escondido residents have been farming plots on
campus since the village opened in 1958. Originally,
the University allotted them 30 plots. The
Maintenance Office assigned the plots on a first
come-first served basis.
High Demand
The demand for plots far outreaches their

supply. According to Martha Gillespie of the
maintenance office, 'The interest grew by leaps and
bounds."
Last year, the Maintenance Office assigned 150
plots, and there was still a waiting list. Even this
year, the office could not give everyone who wanted
them.
Many of the students who receive plots know
little about gardening when they start, but they
rarely run into problems. Other experienced student
gardeners offer their help. And luck seems to follow
the neophytes. According to John Ferguson, a
student in the business school, "even with the
people who don't know anything at all, everything
seems to grow."
Sometimes new gardeners inherit old,
well-cultivated plots. One man was assigned a plot
with a flourishing strawberry patch already on it.
Another has acquired a plot-sized corn patch that he
probably doesn't know about yet.
Village residents cultivate plots for a variety of
reasons. Some are trying to save money. Heidi
Funk, wife of a graduate student in medical
microbiology, paid 19 cents for six tomato plants
she is growing. Although they won't yield enough
tomatoes to feed her family all year, they will help
cut costs.
Recreation
Other residents, like Ferguson, garden because
they find it good therapy. Says Ferguson, "It helps

me relax. It's a form of recreation, as well as a good
way to get fresh vegetables."
The independent houses maintain a garden as
part of their cooperative programs. Thomas Fricke,
an engineering student and one of the plots' most
devoted gardeners, says "We're trying to really
follow through on the philosophy we're supposed to
be living."
The plants are grown organically. The gardeners
also try to maintain a natural balance between
plants, For example, corn, which uses up nitrogen,
grows next to pease, which return nitrogen to the
soil.
Although most of the 150 people associated with
the houses don't work on the land, the few that do
devote many hours to it.
According to Fricke, about six students keep the
garden going through the year.
Since most students are enjoying summer
vacation when the plants ripen, the houses do not
aim primarily at feeding themselves on the plants.
Instead, according to Fricke, "the desire is to do
something useful." Last summer, the students grew
enough food to feed a day care center in
Sunnyvale for a month.
The purposes for the two sets of plots differ.
Perhaps as a result, intra-group cooperation rarely
occurs. In one respect, however, the groups are
working togethr; they are both managing to keep
some of the "Farm" at Stanford.
