# Cal Tops Cards, 10-9
## Laxmen Lose Broken Stick 
### MARK WHITE 
After giving up three quick
goals in the first six minutes of
the game, Stanford's lacrosse team
fell short in their comeback bid
and lost to California, 10-9, on
the Bear's field Wednesday
afternoon.
Wednesday's defeat, coupled
with the Card's 10-8 loss to the
Bears April 8, gave Cal possession
of the coveted Broken Stick
Award, which annually goes to
the victor of the season series.
Coach Peter Schneider best

summed up the crucial factor in
Wednesday's game. "We did our
famous first period frolick,"
analyzed Schneider, "and by the
time we took control, it was too
late. In looking back, I think if
the game had officially gotten
under way 15 minutes after we
started playing, we might have
won."
During the early minutes of the
game several Cardinals had trouble
getting on track, especially usually
steady goalie Hal Richardson, who
was stung for goals on the first

three Bear shots. Richardson came
back to play some of his best
defense of the year, making
several spectacular saves, but Cal's
early lead proved to be the
difference.
Although the Cards were down
6-2 at the end of the first quarter,
Dave Sampson's two goals and an
assist brought Stanford back to
within one, 7-6, at the half.
Midfielder Paul Yeuell's second
goal of the game kept Stanford
close in the third quarter, but
poor Cardinal passing allowed Cal
to maintain its lead. Shelley
Gordon, who had one of his best
performances of the year, scored
twice in the fourth, and going into
the final minutes of the game the
Cards trailed by a single goal.
But in a play that probably
best typified Stanford's efforts,
the Cards miffed an opportunity
to knot the score in the final 10
seconds. Card defenseman Bruce
Ogden gained possession of the
ball as the game neared the end,
and in a last second effort, flung
the ball 40 yards to attack man
Butch Hazlett, who passed back
to Bill Ketchum at the crease of
the Cal goal. Somehow the pass
eluded the perfectly positioned
Ketchum and the ball bounced
harmlessly away to preserve Cal's
10-9 victory.
Stanford attempts to improve
its 6-4 record Sunday at 1 p.m. on
the Stanford Rugby field in a
game against undefeated and
league-leading Naval
Post-Graduate School.
