U.S. Planes Bomb Near Phnom Penh
PHNOM PENH — U.S. warplanes attacked antigovernment
forces just across the Mekong River from this Cambodian
capital yesterday.
Hundreds of Phnon Penh residents watched from a
riverside wall as the American jets bombed the river's east
bank. The advance, the closest to Phnon Penh since Oct.
7, appeared to put the enemy in position for a possible
attack on the capital.
The antigovernment forces seized control of a long
stretch of the river bank almost by default. Refugees said
the government soldiers defending the east bank fled two
days ago as the enemy moved in.
Military sources said the enemy force may number as
many as 5,000. These informants reported the Communist
command troops had gained control of the Mekong
shoreline from a point 12 miles to the south to a point 16
miles north of Phnom Penh.
The government identifies the enemy troops as
Vietnamese Communists, either North Vietnamese or Viet
Cong.
Western diplomats and some Cambodian field officers
have said, however, that only Cambodian insurgents are
moving up close to Phnom Penh, with the help of
Vietnamese Communist advisers and artillery crews.
Cambodian censors prohibit the use of the term
Cambodian insurgents in war dispatches.
The government has 27,000 soldiers inside Phnom
Penh, but field commanders apparently neglected to
protect the capital's right flank, Western military attaches
said. The government positions were reported thinkly
defended. More than 20 rockets slammed into the airport
2Vi miles west of the capital and an adjoining shantytown
jamned with refugees, killing 19 persons and wounding
62. No aircraft was damaged, but one rocket killed an
officer and wounded seven soldiers at the entrance to the
military part of the airfield.
A Radio Hanoi broadcast claimed that Cambodian
national liberation forces had captured the district capital
of Kompong Kantuot, 12 miles southwest of Phnom Penh
last Sunday.
Viet Peace Meeting Still Tentative
PARIS — Hanoi has not yet formally agreed to a meeting
here next month between Henry A. Kissinger and Le Due
Tho, sources close to the North Vietnamese delegation
said yesterday.
The informants hinted that U.S. agreement to resume
economic aid talks and resume the removal of American
mines in North Vietnamese waters may be the price
Washington would have to pay for a new meeting between

the U.S. presidential adviser and the North Vietnamese
Politburo member.
White House sources said Wednesday that Kissinger and
Tho were expected to meet in Paris in mid-May to discuss
violations of the peace agreement they negotiated in
secret sessions here between October and January.
Without directly denying the White House report, the
North Vietnamese sources indicated that a new
Kissinger-Tho meeting is by no means certain and depends
largely on the preliminary talks opening here today
between William Sullivan, U.S. deputy assistant secretary
of state, and Hanoi's deputy foreign minister, Nguyen Co
Thach.
Major Earthquake Strikes Hawaii
HILO, Hawaii — A major earthquake centered a short
distance offshore rocked this quiet coastal town yesterday
and shook buildings in Honolulu, 200 miles to the
northwest.
The quake registered 6.0 on the Richter Scale in
Honolulu, but damage was relatively light and only two
serious injuries were reported.
The island's mayor, Shunichi Kimura, declared a state
of emergency, and most downtown Hilo businesses closed.
Hilo is the largest city on Hawaii Island with a population
of 26,000.
Downtown Hilo was cordoned off. Damage to
buildings included shattered store windows, broken
merchandise and crumbling plaster.
Ten of 29 schools on Hawaii Island, about 200 miles
southeast of Honolulu, were closed.
Power lines were down between Hilo and Hakalau, 10
miles to the north. A coastal highway on Hawaii Island
was blocked by landslides and fallen trees.
State civil defense officials said the offshore location
and depth of the quake, 12 miles northeast of Hilo and 35
miles deep, helped prevent more serious damage and
person injury.
Mental Patient Confesses Slayings
SANTA CRUZ — A rotting human head was unearthed
yesterday in the back yard of a 280-pound man who
claims nine murder victims, including his mother and six
mutilated college coeds here, the sheriff's office said.
The head, turned over to a pathologist for
identification, was unearthed behind an apartment
building in nearby Aptos where the naked bodies of
Kemper's mother and another woman were found in a
closet Tuesday. The mother had been decapitated.
The Pueblo police sources also quoted Kemper, 24, as
saying he got "sexual kicks" by stripping victims,
beheading them and flushing their blood down the
bathtub drain in the Apros apartment, the newspaper said.
Sheriff's Lt. Ken Pittinger said, "We're also
investigating the possibility of his connection" with the
slayings of six coeds in this scenic University of California
community on the Pacific Ocean.
Kemper, who was confined and later released from a
state mental hospital for slaying his grandparents when he
was 15, was being returned to California yesterday. He
waived extradition Wednesday in Pueblo, Colo., where he
was arrested while telephoning Santa Cruz authorities
Tuesday about the slayings of eight women here.
