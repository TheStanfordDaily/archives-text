# O'Grady Election Confirmed
## 
### 
The ASSU Senate, meeting in a special noontime
session yesterday, confirmed the election of the Kevin
O'Grady slate to the ASSU Council of Presidents.
O'Grady, Beth Garfield, Charles Ogletree and Jim
Friend took office immediately after the meeting.
The Senate vote ended a week of constitutional
wrangling since last Wednesday's and Thursday's primary
election, when O'Grady fell barely short of an absolute
majority.
The Senate also voted yesterday to appropriate $800
to the ASSU Course Review, as well as a $200 loan.
Senate chairman Rocky Barber said the money would be
used to help pay printing costs, and that the Review was
due out around May 15.
