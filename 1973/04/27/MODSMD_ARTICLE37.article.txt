# Youth Calls Frat Party 'Different'
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
The 17-year old Texas prep school
student who won a stripper in a
fraternity raffle last week said he
bought his five tickets "as a joke."
The fraternity, Phi Delta Theta, is
under investigation by University
officials after last Friday's rush party
that featured nude dancing and ended
with the raffle of a lovely Sunnyvale
stripper.
"It was all a joke," the Texas youth
told the Daily when contacted in
Dallas yesterday."I didn't really care
what the tickets were for."
No Intimacy
He denied any sexual intimacy with
the red-headed stripper, but wouldn't
tell what happened while he was alone
with her. "I'm not really in a position
to say what went on," he explained.
He claimed he was alone with the
stripper in a room at the frat for about
10 minutes. House members had
estimated he was in the room between
two minutes and two hours.
The student said he didn't
remember whether the party's master
of ceremonies, Mark Davis, stated
explicitly that the stripper would have
sexual relations with the raffle winner.
"I don't remember exactly what he
said ... it was something silly," the
teenager said.
"I was just there to see what
Stanford was like," he told the Daily.
He said the frat party, which featured
an open bar, fivs strippers, and various
naked male dancers was "different."
'Outrageous'
The raffle—"outrageous" according
to Norman Robinson, director of
fraternities—has sparked a University
investigation of the Phi Delt house.

Robinson, who is conducting the
probe, indicated he would have a
report ready next week. "I talked to a
couple of people (yesterday) who
were there or had heard about it,"
Robinson said.
He said yesterday's questioning
turned up nothing to disprove the
story as it has been reported.
The Phi Delts were kicked off
campus for a year in 1966 after a
series of incidents, most notably a wild
party involving girls from Mills College
in Oakland.
In a related matter, there were
reports yesterday that students at San
Jose City College, inspired by reports
of the Phi Delt raffle, were going to
conduct their own.
"They've even found the same girl
who danced at the party up there,"

one student said. 'They're going to
call it a 'Dream Date Drawing' and
they already have permission to set up
a table to sell tickets in front of the
student union."
T.J. Owen, assistant dean of
student services at City College, denied
that his office had given permission for
any such activity. "The only thing I've
heard was when I read somebody did
this somewhere at a fraternity," he
said. "It would not be legal .. . they
would have to camouflage it some sort
of way."
Acceptances for next year's
freshman class were mailed out 10
days ago, and most of the candidates
haven't replied yet, but Dean of
Admissions Fred Hargadon said he
doubted the Phi Delt affair would have
any effect on the process.
