# SCIRE Policy Board To Sever Ties With Undergraduate Office
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
The Student Center for Innovation
and Research in Education (SCIRE)
policy board will announce today that
it is severing its ties with the office of
the Dean of Undergraduate Studies.
Dean James L. Gibbs' decision this
week to fire SCIRE Director Ron
Jones triggered the move, although
board members said a larger dispute
over control of the program had been
brewing for over a year.
Jones said yesterday that the
decision to break with Gibbs' office
would not mean the end of the
program, although it would remove
the program's credit-granting powers.
He said SCIRE may continue to

operate on foundation grants, through
the ASSU, or through another
University entity.
The situation came to a head
Tuesday when Gibbs announced to
board members that Jones would not
be rehired when his current
appointment expired June 30.
Administrative Grounds
Gibbs said last night that he based
his decision on administrative grounds.
"The director of SCIRE has two roles:
one administrative and another
catalytic. Ron Jones has stressed the
latter to the detriment of the former,"
he said.
Jones, however, says he was fired
because "the whole range of our

activities" in accrediting innovative
courses has been "frightening" to the
University. Gibbs, he said, "can't
cope with experimentation."
David J. Fylstra, a senior majoring
in English and a member of the policy
board, said Jones' ouster was the
culmination of Gibbs' efforts to exert
more control over the program.
'Encroaching'
"The Dean has been encroaching on
us like a bulldozer on wild land," he
said. 'This [the firing] is just one
detail in a long history of events."
Gibbs admitted that virtually the
entire policy board expressed a desire
to retain Jones, but said that he and
Asst. Dean B. Michael Closson decided
to drop him after he failed to improve
his performance despite warnings.
Fylstra said that "any program like
this is dependent on trust. I think the
Dean has betrayed that trust."
Physics Prof. Arthur L. Schawlow,
another policy board member, would
not choose sides in the dispute.
'The problem here is, how do you
balance innovation with administrative
control? He [Jones] tended to want
everything possible, but he was not
concerned with deadlines and things
like that, which made it difficult for

people who wanted to run an orderly
program."
The SCIRE charge approved by the
Faculty Senate on Jan. 11 transferred
control of accreditation to the Dean's
office, although it included a provision
whereby the board could appeal a
Gibbs decision to an ad hoc committee
of the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies.
That procedure has been used only
once to date, for a course on auto
mechanics for whcih Gibbs denied
accreditation. The ad hoc committee
overruled him, and that, according to
Jones, added to Gibbs' emnity.
Gibbs said last night that "it would
be a tragedy if SCIRE itself scuttled
the program" by withdrawing from his
office, since "accreditation seems
imperative to the program."
Gibbs said that although there is
"no chance" that he will reverse his
decision to fire Jones, "the board has
taken the position that there's nobody
in the whole wide world for them but
Ron Jones. I don't think that's so.
What they have to do is come up with
someone who can better balance the
catalyst with the administrator."
