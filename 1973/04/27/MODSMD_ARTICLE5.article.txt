# Defense Moves For Dismissal Of Charges In Chino Case
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Defense attorney Charles Garry
yesterday moved for dismissal of
murder-lynching charges against
Venceremos member Andrea Holman
Burt and her husband, Benton Douglas
Burt.
Arguing in the absence of the jury,

Garry said the charges should be
dropped with prejudice—that is, with
no chance of their being
reinstated—because of the way in
which the prosecution handled the
written report of one of its witnesses.
The defense attorney said it was
improper for the report, written by a

California highway patrolman, to have
been destroyed after he had been
interviewed by local San Bernardino
authorities who then wrote another
report.
The judge said he would take the
motion under advisement. The
patrolman in question took the
witness stand to describe the
circumstances further—also out of the
hearing of the jurors.
Testimony in the Burts' trial will
resume Monday in a specially
remodeled San Bernardino courtroon.
Heavy security precautions,
including a bullet-proof sheet of glass
between trial participants and
spectators, and a closed circuit
television monitoring system have
been installed in the new courtroom in
anticipation of the testimony of
convict Ronald Wayne Beaty,
scheduled for next week.
Beaty, the prisoner the Burts
allegedly helped fee escape from the
California Institution for Men at Chino
Oct. 6, will be the star prosecution
witness. One prison guard was killed
and another wounded in the
ambush-escape. Beaty was recaptured,
and he later pleaded guilty to murder
and testified before the grand jury that
indicted the Burts for murder, assault
and removing a prisoner from lawful
custody.
The testimony of the wounded
guard, George Fitzgerald, was
interrupted last Tuesday afternoon as
Canty and defense attorney Charles
Garry argued over the admission of
evidence, including photo
identifications by three witnesses.
The defense contends that the
photos were taken during illegally
conducted lineups and violated the
defendants' constitutional rights. The
court clerk said the uncertainty
centered on which photographs had
been shown to which witnesses by
which police officers.
The jury was dismissed Tuesday
afternoon so that hearings on the
evidence could be held. Superior Court
Judge Thomas Haldorsen will rule on
the evidence Monday morning, and
Fitzgerald's testimony will resume
when the jury returns at 10 a.m.
Last Tuesday, Fitzgerald furnished
the first direct description of Beaty's
ambush-escape to be presented in the
trial.
Fitzgerald testified that he was
driving a state car transporting Beaty
to a court hearing while his partner,
Jesus Sanchez, was guarding the
prisoner in the back seat. A green
Oldsmobile cut in front of them, then
stopped abruptly when Fitzgerald
tried to pass. A second vehicle pulled
up from behind.
Ambush-Escape Description
The guards were handcuffed and
placed in the back seat of the vehicle.
One man assured them they would not
be hurt if they cooperated, but the
driver of the Oldsmobile approached
the car with a gun, saying "Dirty pig!"
just before shots were fired, Fitgerald
said.
"I felt as though we was going to be
shot, so I turned my head and heard
two shots being fired," he stated.
Fitzgerald claims he heard Sanchez say,
"No, no!" just before the shooting.
Fitzgerald did not realize he had
been wounded in the left leg until he
felt blood running from the wound as

he spoke with a prison official after
the incident. Sanchez died of a
gunshot would.
Testimony Questioned
Fitzgerald, who did not recognize
Benton Douglas Burt in a lineup, also
said he did not recognize either
defendant as a member of the ambush
group.
In non-jury testimony, the defense
questioned whether Fitzgerald's
testimony had been influenced by a
hypnotism session he underwent in an
effort to recall details of the incident.
In opening remarks last Monday,
Garry stressed the innocence of the
defendants and introduced Andrea
Burt's parents, brother, and sister by
asking them to stand up in court. He
claimed such information concerning
the defendant's background was
relevant.
Canty said the prosecution would
show that the Burts and Seabock and a
fourth person still at-large, and known
only as "Don" participated in the
ambush, while Hobson waited nearby.
