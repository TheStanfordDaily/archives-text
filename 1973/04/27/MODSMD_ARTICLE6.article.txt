# Yuks Aplenty
## The
						Prof As Comedian 
### 
Jerry Coleman

You pay eight big shekels for
every hour of lecture here, and
what do you get for it? Facts,
knowledge, theories,
enlightenment, questions for
study and discussion, and maybe
some indigestible cellulose, right?
Sometimes.
But once in a while you get
these, plus some real
entertainment: humorous
remarks, lighthearted trivia,
personal anecdotes, unusual
professorial attire or physical
habits, and even occasional
outrageously funny commentary
on current goings-on.
If all you're looking for are the
latter lecture attributes, you'd be
better advised to spend your eight
smackers for two drinks, dinner,
and a show at Harrah's Club
(Southshore or Reno). But if you
stick around Stanford and pick
the right classes, you're in for a
good education as well as a good
time.
Atmospheres
Since my weekly task is to
ferret out humor wherever it may
hide in this community, I propose
to let you in on some of the
funnier classroom atmospheres
that I've experienced.
What follows is NOT a list of
the 'funny' professors on campus;
I've only taken so many courses
here, and even among the funny
ones, any recall in terms of this
article is limited by my memory
or note-taking ability. And there
will be an obvious bias toward my
most recent courses.
So if you've had a course or
prof I don't mention, good for
you! And if you are a professor
who feels hurt that I haven't
included you, write me a little
letter with your funniest lines and
I'll see if I can get them in the
pages of this paper somewhere.
This Year's Pogrom
This year has been"The Year
of the Laugh" for me. Starting
first thing Fall quarter with
History Professor Gordon Wright's
Course on 20th Century Europe,
all the way to Law Professor John
Kaplan's Criminal Law course that
I just stepped out of today, I've
hardly had time to catch my
breath.
Wright painted an amazing
picture of European history, but
once or more each lecture, he
managed to slip into the lecture a

quickie that broke the class up.
Take for example his discussion of
the student revolts in Russian
Universities in the first decade of
this century. In the midst of a
description of the rising socialist
unrest versus the demand for
order, Wright had the Russian
students shouting "Cossacks off
Campus!"
In those Fall afternoons, my
time was occupied by Professor
Daryl Bern's Social Psychology
class. Bern had no difficulty
milking the mirth out of such
concepts as "Bubbapsychology,"
which he described as relating to a
"Psychological principle which
everybody's bubba knows to be
true, but which is, in fact, false."
Crediting the concept of
bubbapsychology to social
scientist, W.J. McGuire, Bern
mentioned in a footnote that
Bubba is a Yiddish term for
"grandmother," but then asked,
"Can someone named McGuire
really have a bubba?"
A Sleeper
Moving right along, I found
myself in that great Winter
Laugh-In, Dr. William Dement's
Sleep and Dreams course. Dement
gave some unique lectures that
could be appropriately entitled,
"Dare To Be Great," and "Why
Bill Cosby Is A Very Funny
Fellow." Between those and the
venerable doctor's habit of taking
movies of the 500-member class
pretending to be asleep, we had
quite a time.
Now I get to the juicy part:
Kaplan's Law course, going on
every MWF in Dink at 1:15, this
very quarter. Don't expect a gag
every hour; often there are too
many important concepts to get
across that don't easily lend
themselves to a humorous
treatment. But when there's the
slightest possibility for
interjecting some inane example
or absurd illustration of a point,
Kaplan will do it. Herewith are
some of his best:
On the subject of castration as
a form of deterrence against
rapists in Denmark — "It doesn't
physically hurt, as long as you get
your fingers out of the way of the
bricks."
8010 8010
On the concept of self defense
and specifically, the choice
between killing to save your life

and running away from an
attacker — "Suppose you're in a
bar and a man in a wheelchair
charges at you waving a bolo knife
and screaming. 'Now you will
die!' You just happen to have a
loaded pistol in your hand so you
shoot him. Are you justified in
pleading self defense if you could
have run away from the man and
thus avoided killing him?"
On the topic of
booby-trappping your own house
as a protection against
burglary — "You want to booby
trap your house, so you build an
alligator pit in the backyard and
the paperboy falls in. The law
can't tolerate that: it's criminal
negligence."
On police accountability for
their actions — "Let's say a cop
makes a routine check of a guy
on the street. The guy is rather
hostile in his attitude and, in the
middle of questioning, he reaches
quickly for his pocket. The cop
reacts by drawing his gun and
shooting the guy dead. Is it
murder? Justifiable homicide?
What if the guy was reaching into
his pocket to get a kleenex
because he had an allergy?"
Real Reality
Enough of this buffoonery. Let
me close with the transcript of a
conversation I had with Kaplan
after class last week:
ME — I'd like to do a column
on your humor in class.
PROF — I'm not funny in
class.
ME — When you say some
things, 500 people laugh.
Something must have been
funny.
PROF — If I dropped my pants
up there on stage they'd laugh.
ME — I'll do the column
anyway. I just want to make sure
I quote you correctly.
PROF — Look — if it would
make it funnier by misquoting
me, misquote me.
ME — OK, anything else?
PROF — Yeah: just remember
Kaplan's fourth law.
ME - What's that ?
PROF — Spell the name right.
(Actually, the one about the
two bricks is as old as the hills.
How the tcjr got in my pajamas
I'll never know. Jerry Coleman is
