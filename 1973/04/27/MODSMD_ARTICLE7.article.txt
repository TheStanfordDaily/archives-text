# Dean's Course Destruction
## SCIRE Is In Danger 
### 
Brent Appel

This winter, I wrote an article
in the Daily which cautioned that
the Student Center for Innovation
and Research in Education
(SCIRE) might be in the process
of being organizationally
imprisoned and philosophically
destroyed. Recent events have
convinced me that such is indeed
the case.
Though I had believed that the
action of the Faculty Senate this
winter extending the SCIRE
charges preserved the program,
my attitude then was myopic. If
the Office of the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies (ODUS)
continues to pursue its present
course, SCIRE will be destroyed.
To talk about SCIRE's demise
is ironic in a year in which there
has been marked increase in
student interest in the program.
This quarter, over three hundred
students are receiving credit
through SCIRE. Certainly, if

student interest is any indication
of success, SCIRE has had a very
good year.
Termination
Yet, on Tuesday, Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs attended his first SCIRE
board meeting of the year and
confirmed what had already been
said privately by Assistant Dean
Michael Closson. Ron Jones,
Director of SCIRE for the past
year, was to be terminated. The
Dean then left the meeting
without hearing the board's
proposals for priorities that had
been worked out in an all day
session the day before.
Procedurally, one would have
thought that the policy board
would have played an active role
in determining whether or not the
director of the program would be
rehired, but apparently this is not
the attitude of ODUS. Though
Ron Jones was terminated, the

policy board was not consulted in
the decision.
What kind of policy board is it
if there is no consultation when
the director of the program is
fired? If a policy board has
anything to do at all with policy,
one would think the board would
have been involved in the
evaluation of the director's
performance. Yet, ODUS
apparently seeks to reduce the
board to a mere appendage of the
program, a form without
substance.
Hierarchy
ODUS seeks to establish a
highly hierarchical organization,
with the Dean's office controlling
all major arteries of the program.
This element of organizational
structure is important, for by
centralizing the program, ODUS
will be able to thrust upon SCIRE
a more traditional academic caste
under the banner of "academic
excellence." The orthodox
boundaries of academia would no
longer be challenged by SCIRE,
but would rather be accepted as
the inviolable context of
operation. Examples of courses
that are innovative, but would
probably fall outside the Dean's
criteria of "excellence" are auto
mechanics (which is apparently
less intellectual than P.E.), and
women's studies groups, which
involve peer group teaching.
Predictions are hazardous, but
I do believe that there are very
troubled waters ahead for
SWOPSI as well as SCIRE. ODUS
seems to believe that these
programs were mere
happenstances of history,
programs that were created as a
concession to radical students ut
which lacked intrinsic merit. It is
ironic that the Office of the Dean
of Undergraduate Studies, which
was to be a prime innovator in
undergraduate education, is in the
vanguard of the movement toward
traditional academics. In this, the
students are the losers.

director of the program would be
rehired, but apparently this is not
the attitude of ODUS. Though
Ron Jones was terminated, the

policy board was not consulted in
the decision.
What kind of policy board is it
if there is no consultation when
the director of the program is
fired? If a policy board has
anything to do at all with policy,
one would think the board would
have been involved in the
evaluation of the director's
performance. Yet, ODUS
apparently seeks to reduce the
board to a mere appendage of the
program, a form without
substance.
Hierarchy
ODUS seeks to establish a
highly hierarchical organization,
with the Dean's office controlling
all major arteries of the program.
This element of organizational
structure is important, for by
centralizing the program, ODUS
will be able to thrust upon SCIRE
a more traditional academic caste
under the banner of "academic
excellence." The orthodox
boundaries of academia would no
longer be challenged by SCIRE,
but would rather be accepted as
the inviolable context of
operation. Examples of courses
that are innovative, but would
probably fall outside the Dean's
criteria of "excellence" are auto
mechanics (which is apparently
less intellectual than P.E.), and
women's studies groups, which
involve peer group teaching.
Predictions are hazardous, but
I do believe that there are very
troubled waters ahead for
SWOPSI as well as SCIRE. ODUS
seems to believe that these
programs were mere
happenstances of history,
programs that were created as a
concession to radical students ut
which lacked intrinsic merit. It is
ironic that the Office of the Dean
of Undergraduate Studies, which
was to be a prime innovator in
undergraduate education, is in the
vanguard of the movement toward
traditional academics. In this, the
students are the losers.

This winter, I wrote an article
in the Daily which cautioned that
the Student Center for Innovation
and Research in Education
(SCIRE) might be in the process
of being organizationally
imprisoned and philosophically
destroyed. Recent events have
convinced me that such is indeed
the case.
Though I had believed that the
action of the Faculty Senate this
winter extending the SCIRE
charges preserved the program,
my attitude then was myopic. If
the Office of the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies (ODUS)
continues to pursue its present
course, SCIRE will be destroyed.
To talk about SCIRE's demise
is ironic in a year in which there
has been marked increase in
student interest in the program.
This quarter, over three hundred
students are receiving credit
through SCIRE. Certainly, if

student interest is any indication
of success, SCIRE has had a very
good year.
Termination
Yet, on Tuesday, Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James
Gibbs attended his first SCIRE
board meeting of the year and
confirmed what had already been
said privately by Assistant Dean
Michael Closson. Ron Jones,
Director of SCIRE for the past
year, was to be terminated. The
Dean then left the meeting
without hearing the board's
proposals for priorities that had
been worked out in an all day
session the day before.
Procedurally, one would have
thought that the policy board
would have played an active role
in determining whether or not the
director of the program would be
rehired, but apparently this is not
the attitude of ODUS. Though
Ron Jones was terminated, the
