# Criticizes U.S. Bombing, Watergate
## McCloskey Assails White House 
### ROBERT BACON 
Congressman Paul "Pete"
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) repeatedly
and vehemently expressed outrage at
the Nixon administration during a
campus visit Friday afternoon.
He pointed to continued American
bombing in Laos and Cambodia, and
charges that White House officials
concealed knowledge of the Watergate
bugging of Democratic national
headquarters last year.
The maverick congressman said that
he believes guilt for concealing
knowledge of the Watergate incident
extends to top White House aides and
perhaps to President Nixon himself.
"The President has an obligation to
speak out — to tell all he knows and
when he learned it," McCloskey said.
"I hope he appoints a special
prosecutor" independent from the
Justice Department to conduct the
investigation.
Indictment Of Nixon
"If prosecutors made the same use
of the conspiracy charge as against
Daniel Ellsberg, the Berrigan brothers,
and the Chicago Seven, it is very
possible an indictment could be drawn
to include most if not all the top
White House aides, and conceivably
also Richard Nixon," he added.

Asked about his own future
political plans, McCloskey said "I
don't know that I'll run again; I'm so
dismayed by it all [Watergate], I may
go back to being a lawyer and bring
lawsuits against them."
The congressman, who recently
dropped his Republican registration
and is now on the voter rolls without a
party label, added, 'The GOP isn't
much fun to be in these days."
Lament
Earlier in his hour-long discussion
with about 70 people in Tresidder
Union, McCloskey lamented the fact
that there has been little outcry from
campuses over the continued bombing
in Laos and Cambodia.
"Congress has the power to stop
the bombing, but it hasn't had the
public pressure... I can't recall a
single major policy change on which
Congress has led the way. They
respond to pressure," he explained.
He urged citizens to join Common
Cause, the national "citizens' lobby,"
as the best way to pressure Congress
for an end to American military
activity in Indochina.
McCloskey described the bombing
as "absolutely unconstitutional. ..
but it's the great copout of the
Congress. We've acquiesced for three

months. Every day we remain silent,
the issue fuzzes. This is a terrible
criticism of the Congress."
He also had criticism for Congress
on Watergate. "We owe these
disclosures [of White House
involvement] to the courage of The
Washington Post, [Watergate trial]
Judge [John] Sirica, and Sen. Sam
Ervin (D-N.C.), not to politicians."
He noted, "Conservative
congressmen are in a rage over
Watergate . . . Conservative
Republicans will wonder if they can be
reelected in 1974 if they identify, as
they did in Miami Beach, with this
new god that has descended to the
earth.
Something Is Wrong
"Even the most conservative
Nebraska farmer knows that
something is wrong.
"Rebuilding the GOP may be as
much a necessity as rebuilding the
Democratic party. The younger
Republican congressmen and senators
are largely good people," McCloskey
emphasized.
Asked the likelihood of such a
rebuilding becoming possible,
McCloskey cited the possibility of
criminal charges being brought against
leading White House officials, former

cabinet members John Mitchell and
Maurice Stans, and perhaps the
President himself for concealing
knowledge of criminal activity in
connection with the Watergate
incident.
"Then Congress would be faced
with the question of impeaching the
President," McCloskey explained.

political plans, McCloskey said "I
don't know that I'll run again; I'm so
dismayed by it all [Watergate], I may
go back to being a lawyer and bring
lawsuits against them."
The congressman, who recently
dropped his Republican registration
and is now on the voter rolls without a
party label, added, 'The GOP isn't
much fun to be in these days."
Lament
Earlier in his hour-long discussion
with about 70 people in Tresidder
Union, McCloskey lamented the fact
that there has been little outcry from
campuses over the continued bombing
in Laos and Cambodia.
"Congress has the power to stop
the bombing, but it hasn't had the
public pressure... I can't recall a
single major policy change on which
Congress has led the way. They
respond to pressure," he explained.
He urged citizens to join Common
Cause, the national "citizens' lobby,"
as the best way to pressure Congress
for an end to American military
activity in Indochina.
McCloskey described the bombing
as "absolutely unconstitutional. ..
but it's the great copout of the
Congress. We've acquiesced for three

months. Every day we remain silent,
the issue fuzzes. This is a terrible
criticism of the Congress."
He also had criticism for Congress
on Watergate. "We owe these
disclosures [of White House
involvement] to the courage of The
Washington Post, [Watergate trial]
Judge [John] Sirica, and Sen. Sam
Ervin (D-N.C.), not to politicians."
He noted, "Conservative
congressmen are in a rage over
Watergate . . . Conservative
Republicans will wonder if they can be
reelected in 1974 if they identify, as
they did in Miami Beach, with this
new god that has descended to the
earth.
Something Is Wrong
"Even the most conservative
Nebraska farmer knows that
something is wrong.
"Rebuilding the GOP may be as
much a necessity as rebuilding the
Democratic party. The younger
Republican congressmen and senators
are largely good people," McCloskey
emphasized.
Asked the likelihood of such a
rebuilding becoming possible,
McCloskey cited the possibility of
criminal charges being brought against
leading White House officials, former

cabinet members John Mitchell and
Maurice Stans, and perhaps the
President himself for concealing
knowledge of criminal activity in
connection with the Watergate
incident.
"Then Congress would be faced
with the question of impeaching the
President," McCloskey explained.

CRITICIZES NIXON ADMINISTRATION - Congressman Paul McCloskey
(R-Menlo Park) spoke out against White House attempts to cover-up the
Watergate scandal to a group of about seventy people at Tresidder Union on
Friday afternoon.
Congressman Paul "Pete"
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) repeatedly
and vehemently expressed outrage at
the Nixon administration during a
campus visit Friday afternoon.
He pointed to continued American
bombing in Laos and Cambodia, and
charges that White House officials
concealed knowledge of the Watergate
bugging of Democratic national
headquarters last year.
The maverick congressman said that
he believes guilt for concealing
knowledge of the Watergate incident
extends to top White House aides and
perhaps to President Nixon himself.
"The President has an obligation to
speak out — to tell all he knows and
when he learned it," McCloskey said.
"I hope he appoints a special
prosecutor" independent from the
Justice Department to conduct the
investigation.
Indictment Of Nixon
"If prosecutors made the same use
of the conspiracy charge as against
Daniel Ellsberg, the Berrigan brothers,
and the Chicago Seven, it is very
possible an indictment could be drawn
to include most if not all the top
White House aides, and conceivably
also Richard Nixon," he added.

Asked about his own future
political plans, McCloskey said "I
don't know that I'll run again; I'm so
dismayed by it all [Watergate], I may
go back to being a lawyer and bring
lawsuits against them."
The congressman, who recently
