SCIRE: ODUS Onus
Editor:
I have never understood Dean
Gibbs' exceedingly bureaucratic
approach to SCIRE's operation,
but I want to emphasize that since
his office (ODUS) became
involved with SCIRE, SCIRE's
autonomy has been steadily
eroded by administrative entropy
creation.
The original charter of SCIRE
contained substantial provision
for ensuring the quality of SCIRE
courses, and ODUS guidance was
never needed in these matters.
Furthermore, SCIRE's expanding
influence in its second year was
retarded by a year or more by
memo-shuffling produced by
ODUS which also created
significant frustration among the
student and faculty members of
the Policy Board who wished to
spread the existing possibilities
that SCIRE offered undergraduate
education. At that time SCIRE's
budget control was used by ODUS
to bargain away SCIRE's
autonomy.
Whether by design or
"administrative accident" ODUS
has a history of eroding SCIRE's
autonomy. I feel it is indeed a
shame that the program may lose
its credit granting authority (the
symbol of academic approval),
but that is a battle which may be
fought in the Academic Senate,
not necessarily with ODUS. If
SCIRE does "scuttle the
program," the onus lies with
ODUS.
There once was a time when
SCIRE was responsible solely to
the Academic Senate through
CUS. There once was a time when
there was no ODUS.
