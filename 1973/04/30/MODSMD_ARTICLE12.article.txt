# Students Invest In Market, Some Rewards Substantial
## 
### JAMES MURRAY 
Be a bull, invest in the stock
market! While many students will
be spending this summer washing
cars or mowing grass, at least
some have found a less-strenuous
way to make ends meet: they play
the market.
Rewards for some have been
substantial, and one brave
individual, Steve Dougherty, a
senior from La Mesa, Calif., has
felt both the elation of success
and the frustrations of defeat
from playing the market. In nine
months, he increased a $2000
investment into assets valued at a
walloping $600,000 — and then
lost virtually the entire sum.
In 1969, Dougherty began his
career by investing summer
earnings in copper and computer
stock. Working with $2000, he
maintained annual profits of 40
percent.
Last May, Dougherty initially
invested $2000, in "commodity
options" — rights to purchase
goods at a future date — in coffee,
sugar, silver, and plywood.
He attributes a great deal of his
success to luck, for as Dougherty
states, "Because of the
devaluation, it drove the prices of
silver up, and I made a lot of
money in silver. There was also a
ten year 'bull market high' in
sugar. I happened to catch it right
and get out at the right time."
Sells Holdings
Every three months Dougherty
would sell his current holdings.

During this period of two or three
days, he says,"I would spend
most of my waking hours
examining the market situation."
In late February, with total
investments worth $600,000,
Dougherty learned that his San
Diego brokerage firm had gone
bankrupt. He is now fighting the
case in court and expects a return
of about 10 to 50 percent of his
earnings.
Didi Hardy, also a senior, has
been interested in the market
since she was 12. Hardy admits
that she has lost a considerable
amount in her speculations, but
her "investment core" has been
impressive and her profits,
"substantial."
Summer Brokerage Job
When she was 19, Hardy
worked during the summer in a
brokerage house. Employed in the
Operations Division, she spent
most of her time issuing warrants,
dividends, and rights.
Hardy plans to enter the stock
market field as a researcher, a
position responsible for aiding a
brokerage firm with investment
choices. She states that as a
woman, it is a very difficult area
to find an ingress to unless one
wishes to become a broker or a
secretary.
Presently, Hardy has a very
optimistic outlook on the market.
She predicts that this period of
"flux" will only continue for
another month, and will be
followed by a rising trend. Hardy

also feels that this is "the perfect
time to invest."
Informal Investment Club
One graduate,, who asked that
he not be named, has formed an
informal investment club with
two colleagues that regularly
speculate in the market. He asserts
that "Speculating is not really
that hard, it's more of a hobby."
The group has two rich
relatives who finance their
operations. He maintains that by
spending about five or six hours a
week, he is able to make about 15
percent profits on an annual
investment of $10,000.
The technique is quite simple.
He and his classmates first choose
an area of industry and then by
collecting the annual and
quarterly reports dispatched by
the companies, account for the
earnings and competition between
thirty similar companies. Using
this information, the three decide
which company to invest in.
Yet contrary to this optimistic
trend, during the past quarter, a
stock market class of 64 students
performed an exercise in which
each individual was "allotted"
$50,000 to "invest" at will. Only
four students made any sort of
profit.
As one individual commented,
"I'm going to invest in the
market. Real Estate is the answer.
I'm going to put all my money in
vacant lots and apartment
houses."
