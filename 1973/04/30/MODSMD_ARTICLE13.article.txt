# Grievance Methods Studied
## 
### 
Law Prof. Bryon Sher has been named chairman
of an American Association of University Professors
ad hoc committee to study faculty grievance
procedures.
According to Assoc. History Prof. Paul Seaver
the AAUP chapter president here, the purposes of
the committee are to study whether new
mechanisms are needed for faculty grievances and, if
so, to outline their jurisdiction and possible
procedures.
"We're going to look down the road to see if the
present procedures for dealing with faculty
problems are adequate," Sher said. "It's better to
anticipate possible problems than to wait for a
crisis."
Seaver said recent AAUP presidents have been
asked by individual faculty to use their good offices
in clarifying procedures for promotion, resolving
conflicts between professors and department
chairmen, and examining personal charges of
academic misconduct.
Cases like these arise because known procedures

cannot cover every possible contingency, he
explained. Their frequency may increase with the
growing financial constraints on the University,
including lower rates of tenure appointments.
Seaver said Sher was chosen to head the
committee because of his past experience in
working on grievance procedures for staff members
at the University. Other members of the ad hoc
group will include Leonard Stephenson, assistant
professor of chemistry; Suzanne Lewis, associate
professor of art history; Alberta Siegel, professor of
psychology in psychiatry; and Moses Abramovitz,
chairman of economics.
Their work will include informal liaison with the
Committee on the Professoriate. The group hopes to
make a report next fall. Following the pattern set in
the AAUP study of faculty self-discipline, it may
then be considered by the Faculty Senate.
In informal conversations with Sher and Seaver,
Provost William F. Miller expressed his personal
interest and support for the study. A copy of the
findings will be sent to him as well as the Faculty
Senate.
