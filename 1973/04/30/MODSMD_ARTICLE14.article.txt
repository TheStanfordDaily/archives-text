# Taxes Tilted Toward Poor
## 
### 
The federal income tax is
increasingly tilted toward the
poor, according to Hoover
Institution Senior Fellow Roger
Freeman.
Writing in Human Events
magazine in a book review of The
Rape of the Taxpayer (by Philip
M. Stern, Random House, $10),
Freeman says "At least 90 percent
of the personal income not
subject to federal income taxation
— because of exclusions,
exemptions, deductions and
credits in the Internal Revenue
Code — goes to persons in lower
and middle-income brackets and
less than 10 percent to those in
higher income ranges."
Freeman, who from 1969 to
1970 was Special Assistant to the
President on economic matters,
takes issues with the thrust of
Stern's book, which is the
argument that our current federal
tax system provides vast amounts
of "welfare for the rich" through
the device of so-called tax
loopholes.
In particular, Freeman disputes
Stern's assertion that such
"loopholes" cost' the U.S.
Treasury $77 billion per year.
Freeman points out that "if all
income over $25,000 were
confiscated it would yield only an
additional $25 billion — and that
only temporarily because such a
step would soon bring economic
collapse.
"To pretend, as Stern does,
that $14 billion could be raised in

a single stroke by taxing capital
gains as ordinary income, or $6.5
billion by repealing the
investment credit and accelerated
depreciation range, or $21 billion
by abolishing the privilege of
filing joint returns, assumes that
taxpayers would not change their
transactions even if the taxes were
multiplied.
'Disastrous Economic Impact'
"The fact is that any of these
and similar steps would have a
disastrous economic impact and
would be self defeating. This is
why Congress, which studies tax
issues more thoroughly than just
about any other subject matter,
avoids taking precipitate action
despite steady urging by Philip
Stern and others of a like
persuasion."
Another example, Freeman
argues, of Stern's faulty economic
reasoning is found in his reference
to oil shale taxation.
Stern asks, " 'How many
Americans are aware of a
provision that crept into the 1969
tax law almost entirely unnoticed,
although it is predicted to save the
oil shale industry and to cost the
American taxpayers a billion
dollars or more in taxes before the
year 2000?' "
Oil Shale Industry
Freeman responds, "The fact
is: There is no oil shale industry in
America. While the U.S. is
threatened with an oil and energy
shortage of crisis proportions (and
heavy dependence on imports
from distant and unreliable
sources), it possesses huge
deposits of oil shale from which
no oil is being extracted because
the process costs too much and
taxes (under the 1954 Code)
make such production a loss
proposition.
"So a provision was inserted in
the 1969 act (and I have to accept
some responsibility in this) to ease
taxes so as to offer an incentive
for at least exploratory attempts
to gain oil from shale. It turned
out to be inadequate. There still is
no production of oil from shale
which suggests that the incentive
may have to be increased if it is to
be effective."
Freeman argues further that
the idea that tax exemptions
benefit primarily the rich is
disproved by simple statistics.
'The $231-billion difference
between adjusted gross income
(AGI) and taxable income (TI) is

available from annual Internal
Revenue Service statistics.
Taxable Income
They show clearly that the
percentage of AGI that is taxable
increases steadily and sharply as
income goes up: In the under
$5,000 bracket only 34 percent of
income is taxable, between
$15,000 and $25,000 71 percent
and from $50,000 and up 78
percent.
"No breakdown is available for
the $174-billion between AGI and
personal income (PI), [but] the
fact is that most of the
$174-billion difference between
AGI and PI is income such as
Social Security and other social
benefits, untaxed labor income,
etc., which redounds largely to
persons in low-income brackets."
Freeman is not totally critical
of the Stern study, however.
"Once in a while," he writes,
"Stern attacks some genuine
inequities, such as in the
treatment of married and single
persons."
