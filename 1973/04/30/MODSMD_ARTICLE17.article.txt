# Reform Model Ineffective
## House Leadership Sputters 
### Associated Press 
WASHINGTON - The new
high-powered, reform-model
House leadership machine is
sputtering along like the old
model it was supposed to replace.
After the first 100 days of the
session, Speaker Carl Albert and
Majority Leader Thomas O'Neill
have learned that it takes more
than a new set of rules to make
the Democratic-controlled House
function smoothly.
Faced by a determined
President and a united Republican
opposition, Albert and O'Neill
have been unable to weld the
Democrats into anything
resembling a majority party.
The Democrats two weeks ago
were unable even to get a vote on
two top-priority bills through
which they hoped to carry the
fight over the economy directly to
President Nixon.
One, which would have rolled
back prices, was replaced by a
Republican substitute that would
give Nixon a free hand to deal
with the economy. The other,
which would have extended a

public jobs program for the
unemployed that Nixon opposes,
was withdrawn when it appeared it
might be defeated.
In both cases the setbacks were
caused by the defection of
Southern Democrats, who
supposedly had lost their
influence in the House this year as
a result of reform, retirements and
the rise of Republicanism in the
South.
The Southerners have been
shut out of the Democratic

leadership for the first time in at
least 50 years — records are
inadequate. They have lost
control of the Rules Committee,
which was the pivot of their
power for the last 18 years.
They are consistently
out-voted in the Democratic
caucus, the organization of all
House Democrats that now
controls the party and which,
under Albert's and O'Neill's
leadership, put through the
far-reaching reforms that
weakened the seniority system
and undercut the power of
committee chairmen — the two
main sources of Southern
influence in the House.
"They talk about change
around here," says Rep. David N.
Henderson (D-N.C.), "but in
politics, one thing never changes.
You have to have the votes to
win. Albert has been paying too
much attention to people who are
actually a minority in the House."
The events of two weeks ago
also underscored the illusory
nature of one of the key reforms
— the creation of a steering and

policy committee headed by
Albert that is supposed to
recommend Democratic policy on
major legislation and seek caucus
support for it. The committee
never even met on the two bills.
More strains are ahead. The
effort to establish congressional
control over the budget threatens
an even wider split between
liberals and conservatives. And a
move to restructure the House
committees has a vast potential
for stirring unrest.

WASHINGTON - The new
high-powered, reform-model
House leadership machine is
sputtering along like the old
model it was supposed to replace.
After the first 100 days of the
session, Speaker Carl Albert and
Majority Leader Thomas O'Neill
have learned that it takes more
than a new set of rules to make
the Democratic-controlled House
function smoothly.
Faced by a determined
President and a united Republican
opposition, Albert and O'Neill
have been unable to weld the
Democrats into anything
resembling a majority party.
The Democrats two weeks ago
were unable even to get a vote on
two top-priority bills through
which they hoped to carry the
fight over the economy directly to
President Nixon.
One, which would have rolled
back prices, was replaced by a
Republican substitute that would
give Nixon a free hand to deal
with the economy. The other,
which would have extended a

public jobs program for the
unemployed that Nixon opposes,
was withdrawn when it appeared it
might be defeated.
In both cases the setbacks were
caused by the defection of
Southern Democrats, who
supposedly had lost their
influence in the House this year as
a result of reform, retirements and
the rise of Republicanism in the
South.
The Southerners have been
shut out of the Democratic

leadership for the first time in at
least 50 years — records are
inadequate. They have lost
control of the Rules Committee,
which was the pivot of their
power for the last 18 years.
They are consistently
out-voted in the Democratic
caucus, the organization of all
House Democrats that now
controls the party and which,
under Albert's and O'Neill's
leadership, put through the
far-reaching reforms that
weakened the seniority system
and undercut the power of
committee chairmen — the two
main sources of Southern
influence in the House.
"They talk about change
