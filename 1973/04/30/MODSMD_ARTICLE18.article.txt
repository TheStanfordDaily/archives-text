# Crew's Subtle Side
## 
### 
The April 23 issue of Sports Illustrated magazine features a photographic essay on
crew, a sport the magazine describes with the following eloquent prose: "Much is made of
the ecstacy and agony of rowing, the hopeful start in a swirl of spray, the powerful beat
to an ancient rhythm, a fragile shell being driven by almost a tori of men, the exhilaration
and the exhaustion at the end.
"But too little is said of rowing's less obtrusive ingredients: the controlled grace of a
single sculler as he rations his strength to 2000 meters; the beads of water on a freshly
hauled shell; the thwack of oars and the roll of seats; the smell of suri-warmed varnish on
a day in April; the pungency Of a dim boathouse; the deceptively effortless stride of a
four with coxswain going home late on an autumn afternoon."
The Daily doesn't have enough creative writing students on its sports staff to come up
with words which can describe crew in better words, but Daily photographer Stuart Lum
showed some definite originality in his photographic portrayal of the sport, including a
scene in the boathouse before the race (top right), the Stanford team in action against
Santa Clara (middle left), Cardinal stroke Dick Kirby (middle right), Stanford arid Santa
Clara boats during the race (bottom left), and several Card oarsmen carrying the shell
onto shore after a workout (bottom right).
This weekend the crew competed at Santa Barbara against UC Santa Barbara and UC
San Diego and four of the six Stanford boats were victorious. The varsity heavyweights
wort by 26 seconds over Sarita Barbara, the junior varsity won by three lengths over San
Diego, the varsity fours won by 25 seconds over Santa Barbara, and the freshmen eights
won by a length over Sarita Barbara.
The varsity lightweights lost by four tenths of a second to San Diego arid the freshman
fours lost by two lengths, also against Sari Diego.
