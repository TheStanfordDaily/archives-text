# Whitlinger-Du Pre Save Day
## Netmen Win Ojai Title 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
An unlikely pair of heroes, Pat
DuPre and John Whitlinger, saved
Stanford's second straight Ojai
championship trophy yesterday,
just as it looked like the Cardinals
had somehow blown a big lead.
Whitlinger-DuPre, playing as a
doubles team for the first time
this week, downed USC's Sashi
Menon-John Andrews 7-6, 3-6,
7-6, in the semifinals of Ojai's
featured Pac-8 division, thus
insuring the Cardinals' 16-14
victory over USC for the team
title.
It scarcely mattered that the
pair of freshmen, the only
Stanford doubles team to reach
the semis, lost to UCLA's Rayno
Seegers and Steve Krulevitz 7-6,
7-5 in the finals late yesterday.
The Whitlinger-DuPre win was
just about the only bright spot in
an otherwise bleak weekend at
Ojai that saw Stanford's
"insurmountable" five-point lead

over USC dwindle to a single
point.
Friday, two of the four
Stanford singles players remaining
in the tournament lost. Whitlinger
bowed to teammate Jim Delaney
6-4, 7-6, while Rick Fisher lost to
eventual-champion Raul Ramirez
of USC 7-5, 6-4.
Mayer, Delaney Lose
Thus, Delaney and Sandy
Mayer, who downed Krulevitz
4-6, 7-5, 6-0, were the lone
Stanford players left. However,
both lost in the semifinals, played
early Sunday after Saturday's play
was rained out at the Ventura
County tournament site.
Delaney lost to Ramirez 6-3,
6-1, a not totally unexpected
result. Mayer was upset by USC's
John Andrews 4-6, 7-6, 6-4, thus
losing his chance to defend his
Ojai singles title against Ramirez,
against whom he won the final
match last year.
Ramirez went on to win the

singles title 6-2, 3-6, 6-3 over
teammate Andrews.
In doubles play, both of the
"top" Stanford teams bowed out
in the quarterfinals Friday.
Menon-Andfews beat
Mayer-Delaney 7-6, 7-6, while
Fisher-Groslimond bowed to
Seegers-Krulevitz, 6-2, 7-6.
Meanwhile, DuPre-Whitlinger
beat UCLA's Bob Kreiss and Jeff
Austin team by default, as Kreiss
had been injured the previous day.
Since Kreiss-Austin is among the
best doubles teams on the West
Coast, Stanford got a big break
here.
Superior Depth
Basically, Stanford won
because it had the superior depth
needed to place most of its
players into the quarter-finals, and
won in spite of the fact that it did
not get its top players and doubles
teams into the finals.
While the varsity's victory was
undoubtedly mixed, the Open
division's result was a complete
success. Chico Hagey, the
sophomore all-American who has
not played all year due to an
ankle injury, won the Open
division title, downing Tom Kreiss
6-3, 7-6.
Kreiss had beaten Stanford's
other entry in this division, Paul
Sidone, in the semifinals.
The women players Stanford
entered did not fare as well. Terry
Albert, playing singles, lost to Sue
Marta 6-3, 6-4 in the second
round of the Women's
Intercollegiate Division after
beating Irene Allen 6-2, 6-1 in the
first round.
The doubles team of Tracy
McNair and Anrea Barnes failed to
defend their doubles title, losing
to the Turner-Ehrlich team 6-3,
6-7, 6-3 in the third round after
topping Downs-Jennings 6-1, 6-0
the previous round.
The varsity's Ojai win can be
considered round three in the
five-round battle for the national
championship. Stanford also won
the first round at Madison in
February, and achieved a
stand-off in the series of matches
that comprised the second-round.
Still, due to the closeness of
the Ojai win, the question of who
is to be favored in May's Pac-8
meet and June's NCAA
tournament remains unsettled.

STANFORD'S NEMESIS — USC's Raul Ramirez has now defeated

singles titles.

6-7, 6-3 in the third round after
topping Downs-Jennings 6-1, 6-0
the previous round.
The varsity's Ojai win can be
considered round three in the
five-round battle for the national
championship. Stanford also won
the first round at Madison in
February, and achieved a
stand-off in the series of matches
that comprised the second-round.
Still, due to the closeness of
the Ojai win, the question of who
is to be favored in May's Pac-8
meet and June's NCAA
tournament remains unsettled.

STANFORD'S NEMESIS — USC's Raul Ramirez has now defeated
Stanford's top two players, Sandy Mayer and Jim Delaney, three
times in a row. The Mexican Davis Cupper, who yesterday won the
Ojai singles championship, is a favorite for both the Pac-8 and NCAA
singles titles.
An unlikely pair of heroes, Pat
DuPre and John Whitlinger, saved
Stanford's second straight Ojai
championship trophy yesterday,
just as it looked like the Cardinals
had somehow blown a big lead.
Whitlinger-DuPre, playing as a
doubles team for the first time
this week, downed USC's Sashi
Menon-John Andrews 7-6, 3-6,
7-6, in the semifinals of Ojai's
featured Pac-8 division, thus
insuring the Cardinals' 16-14
victory over USC for the team
title.
It scarcely mattered that the
pair of freshmen, the only
Stanford doubles team to reach
the semis, lost to UCLA's Rayno
Seegers and Steve Krulevitz 7-6,
7-5 in the finals late yesterday.
The Whitlinger-DuPre win was
just about the only bright spot in
an otherwise bleak weekend at
Ojai that saw Stanford's
"insurmountable" five-point lead

over USC dwindle to a single
point.
Friday, two of the four
Stanford singles players remaining
in the tournament lost. Whitlinger
bowed to teammate Jim Delaney
6-4, 7-6, while Rick Fisher lost to
eventual-champion Raul Ramirez
of USC 7-5, 6-4.
Mayer, Delaney Lose
Thus, Delaney and Sandy
Mayer, who downed Krulevitz
4-6, 7-5, 6-0, were the lone
Stanford players left. However,
both lost in the semifinals, played
early Sunday after Saturday's play
was rained out at the Ventura
County tournament site.
Delaney lost to Ramirez 6-3,
6-1, a not totally unexpected
result. Mayer was upset by USC's
John Andrews 4-6, 7-6, 6-4, thus
losing his chance to defend his
Ojai singles title against Ramirez,
against whom he won the final
match last year.
Ramirez went on to win the

singles title 6-2, 3-6, 6-3 over
teammate Andrews.
In doubles play, both of the
"top" Stanford teams bowed out
in the quarterfinals Friday.
Menon-Andfews beat
Mayer-Delaney 7-6, 7-6, while
Fisher-Groslimond bowed to
Seegers-Krulevitz, 6-2, 7-6.
Meanwhile, DuPre-Whitlinger
beat UCLA's Bob Kreiss and Jeff
Austin team by default, as Kreiss
had been injured the previous day.
Since Kreiss-Austin is among the
best doubles teams on the West
Coast, Stanford got a big break
here.
Superior Depth
Basically, Stanford won
because it had the superior depth
needed to place most of its
players into the quarter-finals, and
won in spite of the fact that it did
not get its top players and doubles
teams into the finals.
While the varsity's victory was
undoubtedly mixed, the Open
division's result was a complete
success. Chico Hagey, the
sophomore all-American who has
not played all year due to an
ankle injury, won the Open
division title, downing Tom Kreiss
6-3, 7-6.
Kreiss had beaten Stanford's
other entry in this division, Paul
Sidone, in the semifinals.
The women players Stanford
entered did not fare as well. Terry
Albert, playing singles, lost to Sue
Marta 6-3, 6-4 in the second
round of the Women's
Intercollegiate Division after
beating Irene Allen 6-2, 6-1 in the
first round.
The doubles team of Tracy
McNair and Anrea Barnes failed to
defend their doubles title, losing
to the Turner-Ehrlich team 6-3,
6-7, 6-3 in the third round after
topping Downs-Jennings 6-1, 6-0
the previous round.
The varsity's Ojai win can be

While the varsity's victory was
undoubtedly mixed, the Open
division's result was a complete
success. Chico Hagey, the
sophomore all-American who has
not played all year due to an
ankle injury, won the Open
division title, downing Tom Kreiss
6-3, 7-6.
Kreiss had beaten Stanford's
other entry in this division, Paul
Sidone, in the semifinals.
The women players Stanford
entered did not fare as well. Terry
Albert, playing singles, lost to Sue
Marta 6-3, 6-4 in the second
round of the Women's
Intercollegiate Division after
beating Irene Allen 6-2, 6-1 in the
first round.
The doubles team of Tracy
McNair and Anrea Barnes failed to
defend their doubles title, losing
to the Turner-Ehrlich team 6-3,
6-7, 6-3 in the third round after
topping Downs-Jennings 6-1, 6-0
the previous round.
The varsity's Ojai win can be
considered round three in the
five-round battle for the national
championship. Stanford also won
the first round at Madison in
February, and achieved a
stand-off in the series of matches
that comprised the second-round.
Still, due to the closeness of
the Ojai win, the question of who
is to be favored in May's Pac-8
meet and June's NCAA
tournament remains unsettled.

STANFORD'S NEMESIS — USC's Raul Ramirez has now defeated
Stanford's top two players, Sandy Mayer and Jim Delaney, three
times in a row. The Mexican Davis Cupper, who yesterday won the
Ojai singles championship, is a favorite for both the Pac-8 and NCAA
singles titles.
