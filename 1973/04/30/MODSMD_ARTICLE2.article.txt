# Women's Conference Offers Career Options
## 
### JANET SANDERS 
"The purpose of this conference is
not to make every woman a
professional but to help students make
more informed choices about their
future," said Carol Friedman, director
of Humanities Placement at the Career
Planning and Placement Center.
With these words, she kicked off a
conference held last week entitled
"Focus on Women: New Voices of the
70's." Professional women from the
Bay Area discussed career options for
women and a career's impact on
lifestyle, marriage, and child-rearing.
The conference began Thursday
afternoon with four panels about
women in the fields of medicine, law,
engineering, education and business.
Asst. Economics Prof. Myra Strober
discussed the dramatic increase in the
number of working women since
1940.
Although there has been a
revolution in labor force participation
by women, there has not been a
corresponding revolution in career
planning," said Strober, pointing out
that women "still tend to gravitate
toward the traditional female
occupations" of teacher, nurse, and
secretary.
Panelists Connie Golden, senior
scientist for Lockheed, Ann Hartman,
Dataquest consultant, and Barbara
Hatton, assistant professor in
education, told how they got started
in their fields.
Non-Traditional Occupations
Golden encouraged women to enter
non-traditional occupations, saying
that "graduate women engineers are
getting snatched up faster than men
nowadays."
Two other panelists, Dr. Linda
Clever, director of the out-patient
clinic at St. Mary's Hospital, and
Colquitt Walker, assistant dean of
Berkeley's Boalt Law School, noted
the problems of integrating
parenthood with a full-time career.
"If you want to marry and have a
child, you better find an incredible
husband," said Clever. "Both partners
must sacrifice and compromise."
Marriage, Child-Rearing
Walker added that "Having a child
puts you at a disadvantage with men

who have traditional wives."
Panelists also discussed the
problems of marriage and child-rearing
in a family where both parents work.
Asst. Psychology Prof. Sandra Bern
began the discussion. "Part of the
problem is that men are not asking
how to coordinate a marriage and a
career," she said. Bern added that the
work structure, which has "forgotten
that workers are also parents," needs
to be changed.
Four panelists, Carol and Wayne
Price, and Abbie and Victor von
Schlegell, have children.
"You have to be tremendously

optimistic or you won't make it," said
Abbie, an administration fund-raiser
and mother of an eleven-month-old
girl. Husband Victor, a graduate
student here, said "that it was easy to
fall back into the traditional roles of
husband and wife."
The Prices, parents of a
two-year-old, said time was a major
problem. Carol is a graduate student
here, and her husband is assistant
provost for academic planning.
The other couple on the panel,
Miriam and Philip Moore, have no
children and have had very little
problem integrating marriage with two

full-time careers. Both are
stockbrokers for Thomson &
McKinnon Auchincloss in San
Francisco.
Office Setup
"Ever since we got married, we've
worked," said Miriam. Presently, they
have a dual office separate from the
rest of the firm, and the Moores claim
that this setup has doubled their
clientele. "We refer clients to each
other if one of us can't handle them,"
said Miriam.
The other two panelists were Esther
Garcia, a single woman working as a
Project Intercept counselor, and
Sydney Brown, a married woman
working full-time as a volunteer in
several projects.
Friday's morning and afternoon
sessions featured women in a variety of
fields.
The morning panelists were Penny
Mann, minister in Stanford's United
Ministry; Amy Metcalfe, assistant to
the provost; Kathy Reilly, assistant to
the managing director of IBM: and
Charlotte Siegel, a psychiatric social
worker.
The afternoon panel consisted of
women in communication.
Charlotte Beyers and Judy Horst
discussed career possibilities in
free-lance writing and photography.
Horst, who started out as a Bank of
America consultant on small business,
was one of the creators of the Ladies
Home Companion, the first male nude

calendar.
The other two panelists were Cally
Curtis Stenger, head of a small
T.V.-firm production company in Los
Angeles, and Dee Tozer, head of an
advertising agency.
Avoiding Stereotypes
All participants agreed that women
have to start thinking in terms of
specific careers and explore all of the
options available. "If you don't, you'll
get stuck in a stereotyped female
occupation," said Horst.
Friedman, the originator of the
two-day conference, expressed
disappointment in the relatively small
turnout. An average of 75 people
showed up at each panel discussion.
Friedman had begun working on
the conference last fall after noting
that many undergraduate women came
to the Placement Center with no idea
what they wanted to do after college.

problems of marriage and child-rearing
in a family where both parents work.
Asst. Psychology Prof. Sandra Bern
began the discussion. "Part of the
problem is that men are not asking
how to coordinate a marriage and a
career," she said. Bern added that the
work structure, which has "forgotten
that workers are also parents," needs
to be changed.
Four panelists, Carol and Wayne
Price, and Abbie and Victor von
Schlegell, have children.
"You have to be tremendously

optimistic or you won't make it," said
Abbie, an administration fund-raiser
and mother of an eleven-month-old
girl. Husband Victor, a graduate
student here, said "that it was easy to
fall back into the traditional roles of
husband and wife."
The Prices, parents of a
two-year-old, said time was a major
problem. Carol is a graduate student
here, and her husband is assistant
provost for academic planning.
The other couple on the panel,
Miriam and Philip Moore, have no
children and have had very little
problem integrating marriage with two

full-time careers. Both are
stockbrokers for Thomson &
McKinnon Auchincloss in San
Francisco.
Office Setup
"Ever since we got married, we've
worked," said Miriam. Presently, they
have a dual office separate from the
rest of the firm, and the Moores claim
that this setup has doubled their
clientele. "We refer clients to each
other if one of us can't handle them,"
said Miriam.
The other two panelists were Esther
Garcia, a single woman working as a
Project Intercept counselor, and
Sydney Brown, a married woman
working full-time as a volunteer in
several projects.
Friday's morning and afternoon
sessions featured women in a variety of
fields.
The morning panelists were Penny
Mann, minister in Stanford's United
Ministry; Amy Metcalfe, assistant to
the provost; Kathy Reilly, assistant to
the managing director of IBM: and
Charlotte Siegel, a psychiatric social
worker.
The afternoon panel consisted of
women in communication.
Charlotte Beyers and Judy Horst
discussed career possibilities in
free-lance writing and photography.
Horst, who started out as a Bank of
America consultant on small business,
was one of the creators of the Ladies
Home Companion, the first male nude

calendar.
The other two panelists were Cally
Curtis Stenger, head of a small
T.V.-firm production company in Los
Angeles, and Dee Tozer, head of an
advertising agency.
Avoiding Stereotypes
All participants agreed that women
have to start thinking in terms of
specific careers and explore all of the
options available. "If you don't, you'll
get stuck in a stereotyped female
occupation," said Horst.
Friedman, the originator of the
two-day conference, expressed
disappointment in the relatively small
turnout. An average of 75 people
showed up at each panel discussion.
Friedman had begun working on
the conference last fall after noting
that many undergraduate women came
to the Placement Center with no idea
what they wanted to do after college.
"The purpose of this conference is
not to make every woman a
professional but to help students make
more informed choices about their
future," said Carol Friedman, director
of Humanities Placement at the Career
Planning and Placement Center.
With these words, she kicked off a
conference held last week entitled
"Focus on Women: New Voices of the
70's." Professional women from the
Bay Area discussed career options for
women and a career's impact on
lifestyle, marriage, and child-rearing.
The conference began Thursday
afternoon with four panels about
women in the fields of medicine, law,
engineering, education and business.
Asst. Economics Prof. Myra Strober
discussed the dramatic increase in the
number of working women since
1940.
Although there has been a
revolution in labor force participation
by women, there has not been a
corresponding revolution in career
planning," said Strober, pointing out
that women "still tend to gravitate
toward the traditional female
occupations" of teacher, nurse, and
secretary.
Panelists Connie Golden, senior
scientist for Lockheed, Ann Hartman,
Dataquest consultant, and Barbara
Hatton, assistant professor in
education, told how they got started
in their fields.
Non-Traditional Occupations
Golden encouraged women to enter
non-traditional occupations, saying
that "graduate women engineers are
getting snatched up faster than men
nowadays."
Two other panelists, Dr. Linda
Clever, director of the out-patient
clinic at St. Mary's Hospital, and
Colquitt Walker, assistant dean of
Berkeley's Boalt Law School, noted
the problems of integrating
parenthood with a full-time career.
"If you want to marry and have a
child, you better find an incredible
husband," said Clever. "Both partners
must sacrifice and compromise."
Marriage, Child-Rearing
Walker added that "Having a child
puts you at a disadvantage with men

who have traditional wives."
Panelists also discussed the

the managing director of IBM: and
Charlotte Siegel, a psychiatric social
worker.
The afternoon panel consisted of
women in communication.
Charlotte Beyers and Judy Horst
discussed career possibilities in
free-lance writing and photography.
Horst, who started out as a Bank of
America consultant on small business,
was one of the creators of the Ladies
Home Companion, the first male nude

calendar.
The other two panelists were Cally
Curtis Stenger, head of a small
T.V.-firm production company in Los
Angeles, and Dee Tozer, head of an
advertising agency.
Avoiding Stereotypes
All participants agreed that women
have to start thinking in terms of
specific careers and explore all of the
options available. "If you don't, you'll
get stuck in a stereotyped female
occupation," said Horst.
Friedman, the originator of the
two-day conference, expressed
disappointment in the relatively small
turnout. An average of 75 people
showed up at each panel discussion.
Friedman had begun working on
the conference last fall after noting
that many undergraduate women came
to the Placement Center with no idea
what they wanted to do after college.
"The purpose of this conference is
not to make every woman a
professional but to help students make
more informed choices about their
future," said Carol Friedman, director
of Humanities Placement at the Career
Planning and Placement Center.
With these words, she kicked off a
conference held last week entitled
"Focus on Women: New Voices of the
70's." Professional women from the
Bay Area discussed career options for
women and a career's impact on
lifestyle, marriage, and child-rearing.
The conference began Thursday
afternoon with four panels about
women in the fields of medicine, law,
engineering, education and business.
Asst. Economics Prof. Myra Strober
discussed the dramatic increase in the
number of working women since
1940.
Although there has been a
revolution in labor force participation
by women, there has not been a
corresponding revolution in career
planning," said Strober, pointing out
that women "still tend to gravitate
toward the traditional female
occupations" of teacher, nurse, and
secretary.
Panelists Connie Golden, senior
scientist for Lockheed, Ann Hartman,
Dataquest consultant, and Barbara
Hatton, assistant professor in
education, told how they got started
in their fields.
Non-Traditional Occupations
Golden encouraged women to enter
non-traditional occupations, saying
that "graduate women engineers are
getting snatched up faster than men
nowadays."
Two other panelists, Dr. Linda
Clever, director of the out-patient
clinic at St. Mary's Hospital, and
Colquitt Walker, assistant dean of
Berkeley's Boalt Law School, noted
the problems of integrating
parenthood with a full-time career.
"If you want to marry and have a
child, you better find an incredible
husband," said Clever. "Both partners
must sacrifice and compromise."
Marriage, Child-Rearing
Walker added that "Having a child
puts you at a disadvantage with men

who have traditional wives."
Panelists also discussed the
problems of marriage and child-rearing
in a family where both parents work.
Asst. Psychology Prof. Sandra Bern
began the discussion. "Part of the
problem is that men are not asking
how to coordinate a marriage and a
career," she said. Bern added that the
work structure, which has "forgotten
that workers are also parents," needs
to be changed.
Four panelists, Carol and Wayne
Price, and Abbie and Victor von
Schlegell, have children.
"You have to be tremendously

optimistic or you won't make it," said
Abbie, an administration fund-raiser
and mother of an eleven-month-old
girl. Husband Victor, a graduate
student here, said "that it was easy to
fall back into the traditional roles of
husband and wife."
The Prices, parents of a
two-year-old, said time was a major
problem. Carol is a graduate student
here, and her husband is assistant
provost for academic planning.
The other couple on the panel,
Miriam and Philip Moore, have no
children and have had very little
problem integrating marriage with two

full-time careers. Both are
stockbrokers for Thomson &
McKinnon Auchincloss in San
Francisco.
Office Setup
"Ever since we got married, we've
worked," said Miriam. Presently, they
have a dual office separate from the
rest of the firm, and the Moores claim
that this setup has doubled their
clientele. "We refer clients to each
other if one of us can't handle them,"
said Miriam.
The other two panelists were Esther
Garcia, a single woman working as a
Project Intercept counselor, and
Sydney Brown, a married woman
working full-time as a volunteer in
several projects.
Friday's morning and afternoon
sessions featured women in a variety of
fields.
The morning panelists were Penny
Mann, minister in Stanford's United
Ministry; Amy Metcalfe, assistant to
the provost; Kathy Reilly, assistant to
the managing director of IBM: and
Charlotte Siegel, a psychiatric social
worker.
The afternoon panel consisted of
women in communication.
Charlotte Beyers and Judy Horst
discussed career possibilities in
free-lance writing and photography.

America consultant on small business,
was one of the creators of the Ladies
