# Arthur Hurls Card Victory
## Trojans Take Two Of Three 
### SCOTT DAILEY 
A 1 Arthur picked up his first
win over USC on Saturday, but
the Cardinals still dropped two
out of three games to the Trojans
in Los Angeles over the weekend
and sank to last place in the Pac-8
Southern Division baseball race.
Arthur's victory came in the
second game of Saturday's
doubleheader, as the righthander
from Lake Oswego, Ore. shut out
the Trojans, 3-0. Bob DiPietro
dropped a tough 1-0 decision to
USC ace Randy Scarberry in the
opener. Friday the Cards saw a
7-6 lead vanish in the seventh,
eventually losing, 12-8.
"It was the same old thing â€”
inconsistency," said Coach Ray
Young yesterday."It was just
whether the hitting would go or
whether the pitching would go."
Friday, it was the pitching that
crumbled. Trojan batters chased
Stanford starter Dan Shaw in the
third, and tapped losing reliever
Nick Peterson for five runs in the
seventh.
Scarberry held the Cards to
four hits in Saturday's opener
before Arthur hurled his three-hit
gem in the nightcap.
Last Place
The Cards, who started the
1973 campaign with hopes of
toppling the national champion
Trojans from first place in the
conference, are now in fourth
place, a half-game behind the
Bruins of UCLA, who lost all
three of their weekend games to
Cal.

Stanford will try to find the
win column again tomorrow
when the ballclub travels to
Stockton to tangle with the
University of the Pacific, before
facing UCLA in a three-game set
here, starting Friday.
Last Friday, the Cards started
out with an explosion that would
have done credit to a trainyard,
rocking Trojan starter Mark Barr
for three runs in the first and a
Bob Hampton solo homer in the
second.
USC took a 5-4 lead in the
third off Shaw, and added a run in
the fourth off Peterson.
Then, in the top of the fifth,
Mark Lucich and Hampton singled
ahead of Dave Baker. Baker, who
had driven in Lucich, Hampton,
and Bruce Robinson in the first
with a double, doubled again to
drive in Lucich and Hampton for
a 7-6 lead.
Short-Lived Lead
That lead lasted about as long
as raffle tickets at a rush party.
The Trojans combed Peterson for
five more runs in the bottom of
the seventh, and it was all over.
The Cards should have saved a
couple of runs for Saturday.
Southern Cal's Scarberry, who
upped his 1973 collegiate record
to 10-1, clipped DiPietro and the
gang on four hits in a game in
which DiPietro surrendered just
three hits to the Trojans.
It was left to Arthur, then, to
produce a victory in the final
game of the series. Big Al, who
"pitched extremely well,"
according to Young, fashioned a

three-hit shutout with the help of
Peterson, while his teammates
found him three runs to stand on
for the win.
The Cards carried a scary 1-0
lead into the eighth, when
Robinson led off with a home
run. Then, with Baker on first and
Hampton on third, shortstop
Steve Davis grounded to second
base. Bob Adolph tagged out
Baker and threw to first to get
Davis, but Hampton scored to
make it 3-0.
In the bottom of the ninth,
Arthur walked the leadoff batter
and was upset by the umpiring
behind the plate. Young brought
in Peterson, "before Arthur
started to get flustered," and
Peterson ended the inning on a
popup and a double play to pick
up the save.
