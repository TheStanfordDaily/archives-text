# Cards Edge San Jose State In Predictable Golf Tourney
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
It looks like Stanford's U.S. Collegiate
Invitational golf tournament is doomed to the same
sort of predictability that has plagued the NCAA
basketball championships for the past nine years.
The host Cardinals won the 1973 event Saturday,
Stanford's fifth title in the six years of the
tournament's existence. And San Jose State finished
second, also for the fifth time in six years. Only a
USC victory in 1969 (with Stanford second and San
Jose State third) has saved the tournament from
total monotony.
Actually the final round of this year's U.S.
Collegiate Invitational was far from monotonous.
The individual lead changed hands at least six times
during the final 18 holes and eventually wasn't
decided until the third hole of a sudden death
playoff, when Stanford sophomore Conrad Nilmeier
parred the 12th hole to defeat San Jose State's Phil
Barry.
Nilmeier and Barry tied with 220 totals for the
regulation 54 holes, but ironically they played in
virtual seclusion on Saturday. Most of the gallery
was following the final two groups, which included
second round leader Denny Colvin of Stanford, UC
Irvine's Gary Singer, San Jose State's Dean May,
Stanford's Dave Baskins, Cal State Hayward's Bill
Malley, and Seattle's Ed Jonson, all of whom started
the day at least a shot ahead of Nilmeier and two in
front of Barry.
But while those six players watched each other
give away strokes with costly double bogeys and a
seemingly endless series of missed five foot putts
(the best score in those two groups was 78),
Nilmeier and Barry sneaked in with rounds of 73
and 72 respectively, two of the best scores of the
day on the windswept Stanford course.
"I was fortunate to be out of that dogfight
behind us," Nilmeier said later. "I just kept playing
my own game and didn't have to pay any attention
to any of the other contenders."
During the playoff Nilmeier obviously had to pay
attention to his opponent, but he still played nearly
flawless golf over the three hole stretch. He made
regulation pars on 10, 11, and 12 to defeat Barry,
who parred 10 and 11 before missing a six foot par
putt on 12.
The team competition turned out to be nearly as
close as the individual battle. Stanford held a fairly
comfortable 12 shot advantage after 18 holes, but

that margin dwindled to nine after Friday's second
round and the Cards finally won by only two shots.
Stanford's 54 hole total was 897, San Jose State
shot 899, and UC Irvine finished a distant third at
916.
"We're getting an inferiority complex finishing
second in this tournament," said Spartan coach
Jerry Vroom, "but we're getting closer every year."
It doesn't seem like Stanford will get a
superiority complex, though, despite the Cards'
fifth victory. "It was a good team victory," sand
Stanford coach Bud Finger, "but from here on in
the competition gets tougher and we won't be able
to play like we did today and still win."
Finger was referring to the Cards' three
remaining tournaments, the Pac-8 Southern Division
at Stanford in two weeks, the Pac-8 championships
in Spokane, Wash. May 18-19, and the NCAA's in
late June at Oklahoma State.
Except for Nilmeier, most of the Cardinals had
trouble during Saturday's final round, but Stanford
still managed to place six players in the individual
top 20, four from the varsity and two from the
junior varsity.
Baskins tied for seventh after leading the
tournament with 11 holes to go, second round
leader Colvin tied for ninth after a disastrous final
round 82 (he shot 69-74 in the opening two
rounds). John Beers of the JV's also tied for ninth,
and George Pettinger (the fourth counting player
for the varsity) and Bob Harrington of the JV's tied
for 17th.
Stanford's non-counting scores were Aly
Trompas (75-80-84 — 239) and Bob Chapman, who
failed to turn in a 54 hole score.
The junior varsity finished 12th in the team
competition but the Card freshman team failed to
survive the 36 hole cut and finished 18th in the 34
team field.

ON PATROL — Stanford sophomore Conrad Nilmeier won the
individual title Saturday in Stanford's U.S. Collegiate Invitational golf
tournament. Nilmeier fired rounds of 76-71-73 for a 220 total and
then defeated San Jose State's Phil Barry in a sudden death playoff.
Stanford also won the team title, the Cards' fifth in six years.
It looks like Stanford's U.S. Collegiate
Invitational golf tournament is doomed to the same
sort of predictability that has plagued the NCAA
basketball championships for the past nine years.
The host Cardinals won the 1973 event Saturday,
Stanford's fifth title in the six years of the
tournament's existence. And San Jose State finished
second, also for the fifth time in six years. Only a
USC victory in 1969 (with Stanford second and San
Jose State third) has saved the tournament from
total monotony.
Actually the final round of this year's U.S.
Collegiate Invitational was far from monotonous.
The individual lead changed hands at least six times
during the final 18 holes and eventually wasn't
decided until the third hole of a sudden death
playoff, when Stanford sophomore Conrad Nilmeier
parred the 12th hole to defeat San Jose State's Phil
Barry.
Nilmeier and Barry tied with 220 totals for the
regulation 54 holes, but ironically they played in
virtual seclusion on Saturday. Most of the gallery
was following the final two groups, which included
second round leader Denny Colvin of Stanford, UC
Irvine's Gary Singer, San Jose State's Dean May,
Stanford's Dave Baskins, Cal State Hayward's Bill
Malley, and Seattle's Ed Jonson, all of whom started
the day at least a shot ahead of Nilmeier and two in
front of Barry.
But while those six players watched each other
give away strokes with costly double bogeys and a
seemingly endless series of missed five foot putts
(the best score in those two groups was 78),
Nilmeier and Barry sneaked in with rounds of 73
and 72 respectively, two of the best scores of the
day on the windswept Stanford course.
"I was fortunate to be out of that dogfight
behind us," Nilmeier said later. "I just kept playing
my own game and didn't have to pay any attention
to any of the other contenders."
During the playoff Nilmeier obviously had to pay
attention to his opponent, but he still played nearly
flawless golf over the three hole stretch. He made
regulation pars on 10, 11, and 12 to defeat Barry,
who parred 10 and 11 before missing a six foot par
putt on 12.
The team competition turned out to be nearly as
close as the individual battle. Stanford held a fairly
comfortable 12 shot advantage after 18 holes, but

that margin dwindled to nine after Friday's second
round and the Cards finally won by only two shots.
Stanford's 54 hole total was 897, San Jose State
shot 899, and UC Irvine finished a distant third at
916.
"We're getting an inferiority complex finishing
second in this tournament," said Spartan coach
Jerry Vroom, "but we're getting closer every year."
It doesn't seem like Stanford will get a
superiority complex, though, despite the Cards'
fifth victory. "It was a good team victory," sand
Stanford coach Bud Finger, "but from here on in
the competition gets tougher and we won't be able
to play like we did today and still win."
Finger was referring to the Cards' three
remaining tournaments, the Pac-8 Southern Division
at Stanford in two weeks, the Pac-8 championships
in Spokane, Wash. May 18-19, and the NCAA's in
late June at Oklahoma State.
Except for Nilmeier, most of the Cardinals had
trouble during Saturday's final round, but Stanford
still managed to place six players in the individual
top 20, four from the varsity and two from the
junior varsity.
Baskins tied for seventh after leading the
tournament with 11 holes to go, second round
leader Colvin tied for ninth after a disastrous final
round 82 (he shot 69-74 in the opening two
rounds). John Beers of the JV's also tied for ninth,
and George Pettinger (the fourth counting player
for the varsity) and Bob Harrington of the JV's tied

Stanford's 54 hole total was 897, San Jose State
shot 899, and UC Irvine finished a distant third at
916.
"We're getting an inferiority complex finishing
second in this tournament," said Spartan coach
Jerry Vroom, "but we're getting closer every year."
It doesn't seem like Stanford will get a
superiority complex, though, despite the Cards'
fifth victory. "It was a good team victory," sand
Stanford coach Bud Finger, "but from here on in
the competition gets tougher and we won't be able
to play like we did today and still win."
Finger was referring to the Cards' three
remaining tournaments, the Pac-8 Southern Division
at Stanford in two weeks, the Pac-8 championships
in Spokane, Wash. May 18-19, and the NCAA's in
late June at Oklahoma State.
Except for Nilmeier, most of the Cardinals had
trouble during Saturday's final round, but Stanford
still managed to place six players in the individual
top 20, four from the varsity and two from the
junior varsity.
Baskins tied for seventh after leading the
tournament with 11 holes to go, second round
leader Colvin tied for ninth after a disastrous final
round 82 (he shot 69-74 in the opening two
rounds). John Beers of the JV's also tied for ninth,
and George Pettinger (the fourth counting player
for the varsity) and Bob Harrington of the JV's tied
for 17th.
Stanford's non-counting scores were Aly
Trompas (75-80-84 — 239) and Bob Chapman, who
failed to turn in a 54 hole score.
The junior varsity finished 12th in the team
competition but the Card freshman team failed to
survive the 36 hole cut and finished 18th in the 34
team field.
