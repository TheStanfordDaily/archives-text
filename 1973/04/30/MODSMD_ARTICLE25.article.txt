# Spikers Grab Three Firsts At Mt. Sac
## 
### MARK WHITE 
Stanford's young track team
warmed up for Saturday's Big
Meet against Cal by claiming three
first places, two fourth places, and
a fifth at the prestigious Mt. San
Antonio Relays in Walnut over
the weekend.
Assistant coach Marshall Clark
was pleased with the team's
performance and felt the fine
showing by hurdlers Matt Hogsett
and Dave Bagshaw signalled thj
team's readiness for Cal.
"Any time a squad gets three
firsts at a major invitational like
Mt. Sac, you know you have done
well. Although the weather and
moistness of the track kept times
up, we were especially pleased
with Bagshaw's and Hogsett's
wins. We're healthy, the kids have
good attitudes, and even though
on paper we're 10 point
underdogs, I think we'll give Cal a
real battle Saturday."
On the slow track at Walnut,
Hogsett came within a tenth of a
second of registering a lifetime
best, as the talented freshman
won the 440 intermediate hurdle
finals in 53.1. Although he
showed the same uncertainty on
the final hurdle that cost him a
win last week against USC,
Hogsett closed out the last 80
yards strong to post the victory.

"The intermediate hurdles will
be one of the pivotal events
against Cal" said Clark. "Matt will
be up against Jim Petralia
Saturday and it should be quite a
race. Both men should be among
the tops in the Pac-8 finals."
Considering track conditions,
Bagshaw ran a good 14.4 in
winning the 120 high hurdles.
Bagshaw made up for a mediocre
start with a decisive move in the
last 20 yards to win going away.
The other Cardinal victory
came in the opening event of the
Relays, the distance medley relay
Friday evening, which Stanford
won in a season's best 9:51.1.
John Anderson opened with a
48.4 quarter and Vernell Jackson
followed with a 1:51.1 half mile,
which, at that point in the race,
placed the Cards second behind
Cal.
Les McFadden then took the
baton and gave Stanford a
six-yard lead with an excellent
3:00.5 in his 1320 leg. Brian
Mittelstaedt added a good 4:07.1
mile to give the Cards a 45 yard
victory over second place Cal.
Albritton Fourth
In the toughest event of the
meet, Terry Albritton was the
only collegian to place in the shot
put, taking fourth at 59-4 3 /4.
Veteran A 1 Fuerbach won the
event and became the second best
shotputter in history with a
record throw of 70-9, only eight
and a half inches short of Randy
Matson's world mark.
Rod Utley placed fourth in the
triple jump, going 49-3. Clark
indicated that Utley had a 51
footer going, but "appeared to
collapse going into the pit." The
Cardinal coaches feel Utley is
ready to go into the 50's very
soon.
Freshman Tony Sandoval made
a good showing with a fifth place
in the 10,000 meter run at
29:59.0. Only one collegian
finished ahead of the 117 pound
Sandoval and his 28:58.6 at six
miles ranks him second on the
all-time Stanford list and qualifies
him for NCAA post-season
competition.
After one day of competition,
Ken Kring was in fifth place in the
decathalon with a strong
performance of 3637, 190 points
behind the leader. Kring only
needed 3500 points yesterday to
qualify for the NCAA's.
Although he did not place
against a tough field, Jim Howard
slung the discus 171-2, placing
him ninth on the Stanford all-time
list.

decathalon with a strong
performance of 3637, 190 points
behind the leader. Kring only
needed 3500 points yesterday to
qualify for the NCAA's.
Although he did not place
against a tough field, Jim Howard
slung the discus 171-2, placing
him ninth on the Stanford all-time
list.
Stanford's young track team
warmed up for Saturday's Big
Meet against Cal by claiming three
first places, two fourth places, and
a fifth at the prestigious Mt. San
Antonio Relays in Walnut over
the weekend.
Assistant coach Marshall Clark
was pleased with the team's
performance and felt the fine
showing by hurdlers Matt Hogsett
and Dave Bagshaw signalled thj
team's readiness for Cal.
"Any time a squad gets three
firsts at a major invitational like
Mt. Sac, you know you have done
well. Although the weather and
moistness of the track kept times
up, we were especially pleased
with Bagshaw's and Hogsett's
wins. We're healthy, the kids have
good attitudes, and even though
on paper we're 10 point
underdogs, I think we'll give Cal a
real battle Saturday."
On the slow track at Walnut,
Hogsett came within a tenth of a
second of registering a lifetime
best, as the talented freshman
won the 440 intermediate hurdle
finals in 53.1. Although he
showed the same uncertainty on
the final hurdle that cost him a
win last week against USC,
Hogsett closed out the last 80
yards strong to post the victory.

"The intermediate hurdles will
be one of the pivotal events
against Cal" said Clark. "Matt will
be up against Jim Petralia
Saturday and it should be quite a
race. Both men should be among
the tops in the Pac-8 finals."
Considering track conditions,
Bagshaw ran a good 14.4 in
winning the 120 high hurdles.
Bagshaw made up for a mediocre
start with a decisive move in the
last 20 yards to win going away.
The other Cardinal victory
came in the opening event of the
Relays, the distance medley relay
Friday evening, which Stanford
won in a season's best 9:51.1.
John Anderson opened with a
48.4 quarter and Vernell Jackson
followed with a 1:51.1 half mile,
which, at that point in the race,
placed the Cards second behind
Cal.
Les McFadden then took the
baton and gave Stanford a
six-yard lead with an excellent
3:00.5 in his 1320 leg. Brian
Mittelstaedt added a good 4:07.1
mile to give the Cards a 45 yard
victory over second place Cal.
Albritton Fourth
In the toughest event of the
meet, Terry Albritton was the
only collegian to place in the shot
put, taking fourth at 59-4 3 /4.
Veteran A 1 Fuerbach won the
event and became the second best
shotputter in history with a
record throw of 70-9, only eight
and a half inches short of Randy
Matson's world mark.
Rod Utley placed fourth in the
triple jump, going 49-3. Clark
indicated that Utley had a 51
footer going, but "appeared to
collapse going into the pit." The
Cardinal coaches feel Utley is
ready to go into the 50's very
soon.
Freshman Tony Sandoval made
a good showing with a fifth place
in the 10,000 meter run at
29:59.0. Only one collegian
finished ahead of the 117 pound
Sandoval and his 28:58.6 at six
miles ranks him second on the
all-time Stanford list and qualifies
him for NCAA post-season
competition.
After one day of competition,
Ken Kring was in fifth place in the
decathalon with a strong
performance of 3637, 190 points
