Train Explosions Continue
SACRAMENTO — Bombs aboard a munitions train
continued to explode yesterday, more than a day
after a series of blasts turned a rail yard into a
square mile of flaming boxcars and flying shrapnel.
Southern Pacific firemen poured tons of water
on the smoldering train, trying to reduce the intense
heat so military explosives experts can move into
the area where 18 cars carrying 250-pound bombs
started exploding at 8:03 a.m. Saturday.
In addition to occasional bomb explosions, there
were smaller explosions that sounded like
small-arms fire.
Railroad spokesmen said that was the sound of
exploding cans of fruit cocktail and tomato paste —
not munitions.
Of the original 21 cars carrying bombs, three cars
were pulled out of the yard and 18 others were
destroyed, railroad spokesmen said.
The State Office of Emergency Services
estimated personal property damage — including
400 homes damaged and about 10 destroyed — at
$2 million. There was no official estimate of
railroad property damage, but a spokesman said it
would run "into the millions."
Even as firemen fought the flames yesterday
afternoon, Sheriff Duane Lowe said, "There is still a
danger. As a matter of fact, there are still periodic
explosions."
Lowe also said military explosives experts had
cleared residential sections of potentially dangerous
undetonated bombs and plastic explosives which
showered the area.
Three of the 52 persons injured in the explosions
remained in hospitals yesterday. No deaths were
reported.
The blasts were triggered Saturday morning after
railroad workers spotted smoke coming from one of
21 Defense Department cars carrying the bombs
from a naval weapons depot at Hawthorne, Nev., to
Port Chicago, Calif.
A Southern Pacific Railroad spokesman said
yesterday the cause of the original fire could have
been improper loading of the bombs by Navy
personnel at Hawthorne. The bombs are strapped
down, but "there's plenty of room for friction" of
the sort that could cause a fire, said James C. Shea,
a Southern Pacific vice president.
The bomb squads combed nearby fields and
housing tracts for unexploded bombs scattered by
the force of the explosions while they awaited the
opportunity to move into the main blast area.
The bomb experts were planning to use trucks to
move the bombs as soon as they were given the
go-ahead to enter the area, a Defense Department
spokesman said.
Israeli Arabs To Get New Rights
JERUSALEM — Israel has decided to expand the
civil rights of its 366,000 Arab citizens in a move to
reward the Israel Arab community for its loyalty to
the Jewish state in the past 25 years.
Sources close to the government said it had been
decided to admit several thousand Israeli Arabs to
responsible civil service jobs, to have political parties
open their doors to Arab members, and to release
large tracts of Moslem owned land seized by Israel
after it became a state in 1948.
Israeli Arabs are those who did not flee and
become refugees in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, but

stayed and became Israeli citizens.
Apart from a few hundred who have joined in
spy and sabotage acts against Israel, the vast
majority have shown allegiance to the Jewish state
during 25 years of war against the neighboring Arab
world.
Now Israeli Arabs complain that this faithfulness
is being ignored.
Ellsberg Affidavit Expected
LOS ANGELES — Defense attorneys in the
Pentagon Papers trial said yesterday they will give
the judge an affidavit in which Daniel Ellsberg's
psychiatrist, tells about an office break-in that has
been linked to the Watergate Case.
The psychiatrist was identified yesterday by
Time magazine as Dr. Lewis Fielding of Beverly
Hills, Calif.
A spokesman for EUsberg said the sworn affidavit
would be filed early this morning with U.S. District
Court Judge Matt Byrne.
Byrne has disclosed that convicted Watergate
conspirators E. Howard Hunt and G. Gordon Liddy
may have burglarized the psychiatrist's office to get
records of Ellsberg's treatment.
Ellsberg's doctor told him that his file cabinets
had been rifled during the break-in in 1971, and
that files containing Ellsberg's records had been
opened, an Ellsberg spokesman said.
The doctor said it appeared that nothing was
taken.
But Robert Sachs, a spokesman for Ellsberg, said,
"We have no way of knowing what might have been
copied."
Sachs said attorneys for Ellsberg and Anthony
Russo were meeting last night to decide what
motions they will file in court today. He said they
were seriously considering another motion to
dismiss the indictment on espionage, conspiracy and
theft charges.
The government has been asked to report back to
the judge speedily any information it has been able
to discover with regard to the alleged Liddy-Hunt
burglary. "Time is of the essence," the judge told
the prosecutors in ordering the inquiry. He said he
would accept their reports "in camera" in chambers,
but indicated he would not keep them secret from
the defense team.
Byrne broke the secrecy attempted by the
government in the suspected burglary by reading in
open court a justice department memorandum
saying that an unidentified source had revealed
information alleging that Liddy and Hunt broke
into the office of Ellsberg's psychiatrist.
Ellsberg has said he underwent psychoanalysis in
Los Angeles in 1968, 1969 and part of 1970. He
was then a researcher at the Rand Corp. "think
tank" in Santa Monica. He said he was not treated
for any "current symptom or emergency," but
because "it was something I had always wanted to
do."
More POW Exchanges Seen
SAIGON — Fighting ebbed across South Vietnam
yesterday as the Saigon regime and the Viet Cong
prepared for another round of civilian prisoner
exchanges and the international truce force began a
new investigation of the fatal April 7 crash of one of
its helicopters.
In neighboring Cambodia, insurgent forces
maintained their pressure around the capital city of

Phnom Penh. President Lon Nol announced that he
will head the newly created four-man political
council designed to calm criticism from his
opponents and allies that Cambodia is under
one-man rule.
American aircraft, including 8525, continued
operations over Cambodia yesterday at the request
of the Phnom Penh government, the U.S. Pacific-
Military Command reported from Honolulu. It said
the heavy bombers have been in action over
Cambodia for 54 straight days.
The Saigon command reported 74 cease-fire
violations across Vietnam during the 24-hour period
ending at 6 a.m. yesterday, the second lowest
number since the truce went into effect three
months ago.
Most of the alleged violations appeared to be
small infantry attacks, shellings and terrorism. As in
the past, most of the reported shelling attacks were
concentrated at government positions on the
western flanks of the northern city of Hue.
91 Arrested At Rock Riot
STOCKTON — Ninety-one persons were arrested
and many others injured yesterday when police used
tear gas and plastic bullets to break up a city park
rock concert attended by an estimated 21,000
people, police said. Fifteen policemen were injured
by bottle-throwing youths who set off the
disturbance, police Capt. Joseph Novaresi said.
"We caught hell out there," Novaresi said. "We
were getting bottled all day.."
Novaresi said the tempo of bottle throwing
picked up about 5 p.m. and police fired tear
gas into a crowd surrounding Billy Hebert baseball
field at Oak park. When youths in the grandstands
continued to pelt policemen with bottles, officers
ordered the musicians to stop playing.
When the crowd failed to disperse after "a
reasonable time," Navaresi said more tear gas was
laid down in front of the stage, causing the crowd to
flee the field "like a Chinese fire drill."
Navaresi said policemen "selectively" fired
plastic bullets at persons continuing to hurl bottles
at officers.
U.S. 'Losing Patience 9 With AIM
WOUNDED KNEE, S.D. — An anticipated meeting
between the government's chief negotiator and
leaders of Indian, militants occupying Wounded
Knee failed to come off yesterday.
A federal spokesman said the government is
losing patience with the insurgents.
"I think the clock is running out on how long the
government will exercise patience and restraint in
this manner," Interior Department Solicitor Kent
Frizzell said after the Indians called off the planned
meeting.
Sources close to the government officials have
said for several days that the government would
make one last attempt to negotiate before resorting
to force.
