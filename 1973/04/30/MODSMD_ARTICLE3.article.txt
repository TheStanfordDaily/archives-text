# Nixon Urged To Dismiss Aides Implicated In Watergate Scandal
##

From The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - President Nixon is
being strongly urged by White House
aides just below the iop level to sweep
out all those involved in the Watergate
scandal, according to a staff source.
These aides in private, and major
Republican office holders in public,
insisted the quick removal of such
persons is one of the few steps open to
the President who spent the weekend
in guarded seclusion.
Sen. Charles H. Percy (R-Ill.),
announced he will introduce a
resolution today calling on Nixon to
take the case out of the hands of his
appointees in the Justice Department
and place it with a politically
independent special prosecutor of
irreproachable reputation and

"impeccable" integrity.
Percy said, however, he hopes
Nixon will seize the initiative by
making a full statement on the case
and by firing all those members of his
staff who have lost public confidence.
Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.
(R-Conn.) said the White House may
be putting out a deliberately false
impression by implying that L. Patrick
Gray 111 was forced out of his job as
acting FBI director.
Ruckelshaus Replaces Gray
Gray resigned on Friday and was
immediately replaced in his post by
William D. Ruckelshaus.
Gray's resignation came one day
after it was revealed that he had
destroyed politically sensitive papers
taken from the White House desk of

convicted Watergate co-conspirator E.
Howard Hunt Jr. The papers
reportedly included a "fabricated"
State Department document linking
President John Kennedy with the
November 1963 assassination of South
Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem.
Ruckelshaus plans to take over as
acting FBI director today with the
intention of pursuing all leads turned
up by the federal grand jury
investigating the Watergate bugging
raid, an aide says.
'Run Down Leads'
Press aide Jack Conmy said
Ruckelshaus felt the FBI must "run
down all leads turned up by the grand
jury" in the Watergate case.
Asked whether Ruckelshaus would
assume personal responsibility for the
Watergate investigation, Conmy
answered: "He will be up to his neck
in it."
The source on the White House
staff said those aides urging Nixon to
fire those implicated may be doing so
at the risk of their own jobs if that
advice is not taken.
'Positions Untenable'
"Their own positions may become
untenable," the source said, because
the men they are seeking to oust
include White House chief of staff
H.R. Haldeman and chief domestic
advisor John D. Ehrlichman.
The Washington Post, in its Sunday
editions, quoted an unnamed White

House official as saying that Counsel
to the President John W. Dean 111
intends to swear under oath that he
gave Haldeman and Ehrlichman regular
progress reports on attempts to
coverup the Watergate bugging.
The Post said at least two other
high-level White House officials have
concluded Haldeman and Ehrlichman
supervised a coverup.
Dean Fought
And it quoted one source as saying
the President and his top advisers are
aware of Dean's intentions and are
planning a strategy to offset his
charges.
Dean, the Post quoted its sources as
saying, has written a history of his
version of the bugging of Democratic
party headquarters at the Watergate
building and steps taken to prevent
public disclosure of it.
On Saturday, The New York Times
quoted a source close to the Watergate
case as saying that Dean has told
federal prosecutors that he will not
testify about alleged wrong-doings of
his colleagues Haldeman and
Ehrlichman without being granted
immunity from further prosecution.
Such a refusal by Dean would put
him in opposition to the President on
this question. On April 17, Nixon said
that no individual holding "a position
of major importance in the
Administration should be given
immunity."
