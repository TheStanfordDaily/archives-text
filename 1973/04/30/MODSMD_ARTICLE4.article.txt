# SCIRE Future Uncertain, Director Pursues Support
## 
### JAMES LOBSENZ 
, The future of the Student Center
for Innovation and Research in
Education (SCIRE) is ill-defined at the
present, in light of their policy board's
decision to sever connections with the
Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies (ODUS).
The move, which was announced
last Friday, followed soon after Dean
James L. Gibbs' decision to notify
SCIRE Director Ron Jones that he
would not be offered another contract
when his present contract expires on
June 30.

Jones maintains that SCIRE,
meaning the present SCIRE, will
continue to operate although he is not
sure of its future form.
Jones sees two possible future roles
for SCIRE. The first is a role in which
SCIRE would identify faculty
members who are willing to sponsor
independent study and directed
reading projects for students. The
faculty members would grant credit
for the work. According to Jones,
"there is no question" that SCIRE is
capable of continuing under these
conditions.
But, says Jones, "we want to
maintain our ability to actually grant
credit ourselves." That can be
accomplished in one of three ways,
claims Jones.
Other Channels
One possibility is for SCIRE to
receive the authority to grant credit
through another official University
channel, such as the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies (C-US), or
through the Provost's Office.
But the alternative that Jones
proposes to try first, is "to circumvent
ODUS" by using a provision in
SCIRE's charge that stipulates that
when a conflict between the SCIRE
policy board and the Dean arises, the
conflict shall be resolved by the
Special Credit Review Subcommittee.

Jones states that early this week the
policy board will propose to the C-US
that all issues of credit granting shall
be "sent directly to that special
subcommittee."
'Mechanical Procedure'
Jones believes it may be necessary,
however, to go through the
"mechanical procedure" of submitting
all course proposals to ODUS first, but
that this will only be a matter of
format. He intends to discontinue all
relations with ODUS for all practical
purposes and to deal only with the
Special Subcommittee.
Jones maintains that he has
received "indications of financial
support from the ASSU," as well as
from "one foundation in particular."
Jones claims that the 'foundation' has
"essentially said we'll fund you."
However, the "foundation" director,
who does not wish to be identified,
stated that his organization isn't even a
foundation and doesn't have any
money to give anyone. He said his
organization is a non-profit one and
that at the moment it is in debt.
Gibbs, on the other hand, says he
"can't even be certain that there will
be a SCIRE," not even one run
through his office. He maintains that
"the next step is up to the students. I
don't know right now if students will
be willing to serve on the SCIRE
policy board, or whether the ASSU
would be willing to nominate them,"
provided that ODUS continued to run
SCIRE under another director.
'Wait To See'
"We'll have to wait to see what the
student reactionwill be," asserts Gibbs.
The possibility has thus arisen that
Stanford may find itself in the
position of eventually having two
SCIREs, one run by the University
through ODUS, and another one, run
by some other office, or possibly run
solely by students, without any
official University connection.
Religion Prof. Edwin Good, the
Chairman of the C-US believes that
there is a substantial possibility of
there being two SCIREs. "SCIRE," he
claims, "is by action of the Faculty
Senate an agent of the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies Office. If the
present policy board wants to sever
themselves from the Dean's office
that's up to them. But there will be a
SCIRE whether the present policy
board pulls out or not."
Credit Option
Good believes that if two SCIREs
existed students would definitely go to
the one that offers credit. However, if
both SCIREs were empowered to
grant credit no one knows what would

happen.
When friction between SCIRE and
ODUS erupted in the past over the
renewal of SCIREs charge, a
compromise between the stands of the
policy board and Dean Gibbs was
worked out by the C-US.
Good feels that his committee may
be able to act as a mediating actor
again. Physics Prof, and policy board
member Arthur L. Schawlow doubts
that a compromise can be reached.
"Both sides feel they have an issue
that can't be resolved," laments
Schalow, "whereas I feel they haven't
even begun to discuss the possibility of
a compromise. They don't seem to
want to compromise."
Gibbs, too, is skeptical of the
possibility of a compromise. He feels
that the policy board's "drastic
action" has put them in the position
of being unable to accept a
compromise without "an embarrassing
change of their views in public light."
Jones, however, is considering going
to the C-US, not for a compromise,
but to request "a return to the
situation we had in 1969 when SCIRE
was first initiated." At that time
SCIRE was under the University
control of the C-US, and its credit
granting powers were subject to review
by that committee.
