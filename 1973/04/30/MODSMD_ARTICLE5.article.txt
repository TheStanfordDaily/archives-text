# Local Churches Fight Honeywell Weapons Policies
## 
### KATHY ALCALA 
Four Midpeninsulans were among
150 representatives of religious groups
who attended the annual meeting of
Honeywell Corporation in Minneapolis
last week and asked that the company
cease production of anti-personnel
weapons.
As they expected, their proposal
was defeated.
The four were Assoc. Political
Science Prof. David Abernethy,
representing First Presbyterian Church
of Palo Alto; economics graduate
student Marian Brown of the United
Campus Christian Ministry; and
sophomore Douglass Rice and
Memorial Church staff member
Andrew Kille, representing the United
Campus Ministry.
They discussed their experiences at
Memorial Church on Friday.
According to Abernethy, the four
supported the resolution for
"international, legal and moral
grounds." Honeywell is the largest
producer of anti-personnel weapons,
taking two/thirds of the government
contracts, Abernethy claims. The
group defines anti-personnel weapons
as those designed to "inflict intense
suffering in an indiscriminate manner
on persons but are not usable against
military targets such as bridges, tanks,
or trucks."
The resolution to ban production

of anti-personnel weapons won the
votes of about 224,000 of Honeywell's
18 million shares. Abernethy said this
was larger than the support a similar
proposal received last year, which he
called "impressive evidence of
continuing concern."
The four felt that the debate on the
resolution had little effect on
Honeywell, although, claimed Kille, at
least one member of the top leadership
showed surprise at the support which
the resolution received. Seventy-three
people spoke from the floor against
the weaponry.
"The impact on us was more
important," said Kille. He stated that
the meeting showed the "real conflict
between the technical ability and the
ethical responsibility of the
company." The organizations which
the four represent hope to bring public
pressure against Honeywell similar to
that which was used to induce the
Dow Chemical Company to cease
manufacturing napalm.
When asked what people can do in
opposition to Honeywell's policy,
Abernethy cited citizen action in Ann
Arbor, Michigan. According to
Abernethy, the Ann Arbor city
council decided to stop buying
Honeywell products as long as the
corporation continues to produce such
weapons. The Council also urged Ann
Arbor business firms to boycott
Honeywell products.

Four Midpeninsulans were among
150 representatives of religious groups
who attended the annual meeting of
Honeywell Corporation in Minneapolis
last week and asked that the company
cease production of anti-personnel
weapons.
As they expected, their proposal
was defeated.
The four were Assoc. Political
Science Prof. David Abernethy,
representing First Presbyterian Church
of Palo Alto; economics graduate
student Marian Brown of the United
Campus Christian Ministry; and
sophomore Douglass Rice and
Memorial Church staff member
Andrew Kille, representing the United
Campus Ministry.
They discussed their experiences at
Memorial Church on Friday.
According to Abernethy, the four
supported the resolution for
"international, legal and moral
grounds." Honeywell is the largest
producer of anti-personnel weapons,
taking two/thirds of the government
contracts, Abernethy claims. The
group defines anti-personnel weapons
as those designed to "inflict intense
suffering in an indiscriminate manner
on persons but are not usable against
military targets such as bridges, tanks,
or trucks."
The resolution to ban production

of anti-personnel weapons won the
votes of about 224,000 of Honeywell's
18 million shares. Abernethy said this
was larger than the support a similar
proposal received last year, which he
called "impressive evidence of
continuing concern."
The four felt that the debate on the
resolution had little effect on
Honeywell, although, claimed Kille, at
least one member of the top leadership
showed surprise at the support which
the resolution received. Seventy-three
people spoke from the floor against
the weaponry.
"The impact on us was more
important," said Kille. He stated that
the meeting showed the "real conflict
between the technical ability and the
ethical responsibility of the
company." The organizations which
the four represent hope to bring public
pressure against Honeywell similar to
that which was used to induce the
Dow Chemical Company to cease
manufacturing napalm.
When asked what people can do in
opposition to Honeywell's policy,
Abernethy cited citizen action in Ann
Arbor, Michigan. According to
Abernethy, the Ann Arbor city
council decided to stop buying
Honeywell products as long as the
corporation continues to produce such
weapons. The Council also urged Ann
Arbor business firms to boycott
Honeywell products.
