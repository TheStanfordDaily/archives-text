# Unmerry May
## Kent State And Today 
### 
Daniel Brenner

For the last three years, the
first week of unmerry May has
brought a state of crisis to
universities across the country.
In 1970, it was President
Nixon's April 30 announcement
about an effort to uncover caches
of arms tucked away in Cambodia
which initiated the crisis. In 1971
it was the air war over Laos. And
last year, it was about this time
when the decision to mine Hanoi
and Haiphong harbors was made.
Perhaps we should be thankful
that this year, the crisis is an
internal one, and that the victims
brought about their own
punishment rather than having it
determined by someone else.
Cambodia
Of the three past crises, the
1970 Cambodian incursion/
invasion promulgated the most
intensive reaction at the
campuses. Writing about this
period James Michener reports
that over 800 campuses were
either threatened with closing or
did close early that Spring.
What shook Americans most
about this period, in my opinion,
was not the enormity of the
protest phenomenon but the
violence with which it was
repelled. For on May 4, 1970, a
major state university in Ohio was
propelled from relative obscurity
to national prominence when four
undergraduates were killed by the
National Guard.
The killings at Kent State —
and those which followed the
week after at Jackson State —
pierced the nation's conscious.
For what had been up to then a
situation of relatively non-violent,
generally serious protest had
become a case of murder — and it
was the government, not the
students, who had fired and
killed.
Decision
Walking today on the Stanford
campus, a sight of major and

persistent protest during the
hotter years of the Indochina
involvement, one would hardly
recognize that students three
years ago were faced with the
decision whether to strike or not.
As a freshman that year
(;hough at a different campus),
the choice for me was difficult. It
called for a personal and direct
statement about my attitude
towards the war, not in terms of
dorm raps or letters to friends.
Either you boycotted class
because you believed business as
usual could not go on or you
didn't.
This perspective on the student
strike may appear to the cynical
as a pious abstraction of what to
them might have seemed like a
question of playing hookey or
not. Indeed, I do not doubt there
were some students who seized
the time for frivolity.
Imperative
But for those of us who took a
hard look at the utter seriousness
of the war and the moral
imperative of paying taxes for an
unsupportable war, the issue of
boycotting classes was a
significant matter. It was a period
of assuming greater responsibility,
for those boycotting or not. The
decision-making process
choosing to stay on the track and
go on with classes or getting off
and studying the war and how to
stop it — was valuable in itself.
Today, the decisions for a
freshman, while often frustrating,
do not revolve around personal
behavior in the political world
with the same urgency of Spring
1970. In these times of relative
calm, we would all do well to
reflect on the times of three
springs ago and ask how we would
stand on those matters today.
For there are those who
cannot, those who lost their lives
for doing no more than being in
the wrong dormatory in Jackson,
Mississippi or on a grassy

commons in Kent, Ohio. These
students were not violent; some
could hardly be called "anti-war"
students. But they were
undergraduates, most of them
concerned at least to where they
wanted to find out what was
happening on that day. The
tragedy that befell them is part of
our past; this we should not
forget.

For the last three years, the
first week of unmerry May has
brought a state of crisis to
universities across the country.
In 1970, it was President
Nixon's April 30 announcement
about an effort to uncover caches
of arms tucked away in Cambodia
which initiated the crisis. In 1971
it was the air war over Laos. And
last year, it was about this time
when the decision to mine Hanoi
and Haiphong harbors was made.
Perhaps we should be thankful
that this year, the crisis is an
internal one, and that the victims
brought about their own
punishment rather than having it
determined by someone else.
Cambodia
Of the three past crises, the
1970 Cambodian incursion/
invasion promulgated the most
intensive reaction at the
campuses. Writing about this
period James Michener reports
that over 800 campuses were
either threatened with closing or
did close early that Spring.
What shook Americans most
about this period, in my opinion,
was not the enormity of the
protest phenomenon but the
violence with which it was
repelled. For on May 4, 1970, a
major state university in Ohio was
propelled from relative obscurity
to national prominence when four
undergraduates were killed by the
National Guard.
The killings at Kent State —
and those which followed the
week after at Jackson State —
pierced the nation's conscious.
For what had been up to then a
situation of relatively non-violent,
generally serious protest had
become a case of murder — and it
was the government, not the
students, who had fired and
killed.
Decision
Walking today on the Stanford
campus, a sight of major and

persistent protest during the
hotter years of the Indochina
involvement, one would hardly
recognize that students three
years ago were faced with the
decision whether to strike or not.
As a freshman that year
(;hough at a different campus),
the choice for me was difficult. It
called for a personal and direct
statement about my attitude
towards the war, not in terms of
dorm raps or letters to friends.
Either you boycotted class
because you believed business as
usual could not go on or you
didn't.
This perspective on the student
strike may appear to the cynical
as a pious abstraction of what to
them might have seemed like a
question of playing hookey or
not. Indeed, I do not doubt there
were some students who seized
the time for frivolity.
Imperative
But for those of us who took a
hard look at the utter seriousness
of the war and the moral
imperative of paying taxes for an
unsupportable war, the issue of
boycotting classes was a
significant matter. It was a period
of assuming greater responsibility,
for those boycotting or not. The
decision-making process
choosing to stay on the track and
go on with classes or getting off
and studying the war and how to
stop it — was valuable in itself.
Today, the decisions for a
