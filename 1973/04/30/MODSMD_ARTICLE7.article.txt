# 'Legitimate Institutional Constraints'
## SCIRE: The Dean's View 
### 
B. Michael Closson

SCIRE serves a valuable function at Stanford. By providing an
avenue for self-motivated students to develop their own academic
projects, this program has the potential to reinforce and reward
student initiative and provide academic options not available in the
standard curriculum. The program can also serve as a testing ground
for new curricular and instructional approaches. Unfortunately,
SCIRE fell far short of its potential this year.
Throughout the past academic year, as an ex officio member of the
SCIRE Policy Board, I frequently expressed concern at board
meetings about the unsatisfactory quality of many of the proposals
channeled to the Board by the Director, Ron Jones, and the
superficial nature of the program's credit review procedures. In
marked contrast to the functioning of the three other
extradepartmental programs with which I work (SWOPSI, Urban
Studies, and Undergraduate Specials), the Director and Policy Board
members of SCIRE have consistently demonstrated an unwillingness
to make critical judgements about proposed projects and courses.
They have also shown inadequate concern about University
requirements applying to the activity of the program (e.g., credit
review criteria, course approval deadlines, and instructor appointment
procedures). The Director, while energetic and enthusiastic with
students, particularly manifested these qualities. He approached the
credit review process as a hurdle to be satisfied minimally, in letter
rather than in spirit.
Burden
As a result, the burden fell upon ODUS to ask the hard questions
and make the decisions necessary for an accreditation process to
function effectively. This is untenable as a long-run arrangement.
Although the Dean of Undergraduate Studies has the ultimate
responsibility for the quality of the extradepartmental program
offerings, representatives of those programs, especially the directors,
must exercise this responsibility also. Only the staff members of the
programs, the people who are in direct contact with the proposal
developers, are in a position to convey the legitimate concerns about
academic substance to the proposal developers in a manner which is
supportive enough to have positive educational results.
In spite of frequent efforts to point out weaknesses in proposals
and procedures to the Policy Board — and a number of conversations
about these topics with the director — the situation continued to
deteriorate during Winter Quarter. The Director swamped the Policy
Board with large numbers of often poorly developed proposals for
credit. This exacerbated the superficial credit review problem.
On April 16, I told Ron Jones that I had recommended to Dean
Gibbs that he not be offered a new appointment when his current one
terminated on June 30, 1973. The following day I attended a
hastily-convened Policy Board meeting and detailed to the members
the reasons behind my recommendation. Dean Gibbs met with Jones
and one of the faculty members of the Board, Professor W.C. Hayes,
on the 18th to discuss the matter further. The Dean also invited
statements from Board members. Five were received. All were
supportive of Jones although some acknowledged his academic and
administrative weaknesses. The statements tended to reinforce the
message that the Board had conveyed to us over the course of the
year: the academic and administrative components of the Director's
role were of minor importance.
Meeting
At the meeting with Jones and Hayes, the Dean expressed a desire
to meet with the Board as soon as possible to discuss Jones'
performance. We felt then, and still do, that the issues of the
performance of the Director and the future of the program are

separable. Professor Hayes, as the Board's representative, agreed to a
meeting between the Dean and the Board to discuss Jones'
performance. The Dean met with the Board on Tuesday, April 24,
after offering to do so earlier and after explaining to them that he
could meet with them for less than an hour on that particular
morning. During the meeting, Dean Gibbs indicated that he agreed
with my recommendation that Jones not receive a new appointment.
It is admittedly difficult for a program like SCIRE to function
effectively. It is, on the one hand, an organization with the mission of
being responsive to the needs and interests of students. On the other
hand, it is a University credit-granting agency having both academic
and administrative responsibilities.
A program like this, on occasion, deals with proposed offerings
which attempt to expand the boundaries of academia. In such cases its
representatives are confronted with the significant challenge of
attempting to define what is an accreditable activity.
Rhetoric
Once the rhetoric of innovation and the simplistic dichotomies
(e.g., bureaucratic efficiency vs. student initiative) are swept away, it
becomes clear that a program like SCIRE must be able to temper its
emphasis upon curricular and instructional innovation with an
awareness of the legitimate academic and administrative constraints of
the University. Some balance must be achieved. 'Tempering' does not
mean thwarting innovative attempts — but it does require a serious
and thoughtful approach to the issues involved.
The problems surrounding academic innovation were not taken
seriously by most of the people associated with SCIRE this year.
Innovation became a slogan. It seemed to be equated with being
non-directive and non-judgemental. As in many free schools, the
people knew what they were against but gave little systematic
attention to what they stood for or how to achieve it.
Insufficient academic guidance and direction was offered this year
at SCIRE. Being responsive to students should mean more than being
a facilitator. Being responsive means listening to students and engaging
them in a dialogue. Being responsive means reacting in a variety of
ways, including providing guidance, direction, and supportive
criticism. Responsiveness should certainly be wider in scope than
taking a student suggestion and hastily attempting to transform it into
an accredited activity. Yet, in all too many cases this past year, that
was the way in which innovation and responsiveness to students was
defined at SCIRE.
Risks
Part of the responsibility of the people who run a program like
SCIRE is to determine which risks are worth taking. Frequently the
Board approved a proposal with little consideration of its
implications. There were few attempts to look beyond the immediate
case and attempt to devise ways of answering the questions it raised
(e.g., under what conditions do inexperienced instructors function
effectively? What are the conditions under which a study group works
best?).
In my view, the people running a program like SCIRE must be
prepared to raise such issues. The Director of such a program must
assert leadership in determining the acceptable limits of accreditable
activity. He must be able to work within legitimate institutional
constraints.
This did not happen this year at SCIRE. It must happen if the
program not only is to function effectively in the short run but have a
significant impact upon the University's students and curriculum.

and make the decisions necessary for an accreditation process to
function effectively. This is untenable as a long-run arrangement.
Although the Dean of Undergraduate Studies has the ultimate
responsibility for the quality of the extradepartmental program
offerings, representatives of those programs, especially the directors,
must exercise this responsibility also. Only the staff members of the
programs, the people who are in direct contact with the proposal
developers, are in a position to convey the legitimate concerns about
academic substance to the proposal developers in a manner which is
supportive enough to have positive educational results.
In spite of frequent efforts to point out weaknesses in proposals
and procedures to the Policy Board — and a number of conversations
about these topics with the director — the situation continued to
deteriorate during Winter Quarter. The Director swamped the Policy
Board with large numbers of often poorly developed proposals for
credit. This exacerbated the superficial credit review problem.
On April 16, I told Ron Jones that I had recommended to Dean
Gibbs that he not be offered a new appointment when his current one
terminated on June 30, 1973. The following day I attended a
hastily-convened Policy Board meeting and detailed to the members
the reasons behind my recommendation. Dean Gibbs met with Jones
and one of the faculty members of the Board, Professor W.C. Hayes,
on the 18th to discuss the matter further. The Dean also invited
statements from Board members. Five were received. All were
supportive of Jones although some acknowledged his academic and
administrative weaknesses. The statements tended to reinforce the
message that the Board had conveyed to us over the course of the
year: the academic and administrative components of the Director's
role were of minor importance.
Meeting
At the meeting with Jones and Hayes, the Dean expressed a desire
to meet with the Board as soon as possible to discuss Jones'
performance. We felt then, and still do, that the issues of the
performance of the Director and the future of the program are

separable. Professor Hayes, as the Board's representative, agreed to a
meeting between the Dean and the Board to discuss Jones'
performance. The Dean met with the Board on Tuesday, April 24,
after offering to do so earlier and after explaining to them that he
could meet with them for less than an hour on that particular
morning. During the meeting, Dean Gibbs indicated that he agreed
with my recommendation that Jones not receive a new appointment.
It is admittedly difficult for a program like SCIRE to function
effectively. It is, on the one hand, an organization with the mission of
being responsive to the needs and interests of students. On the other
hand, it is a University credit-granting agency having both academic
and administrative responsibilities.
A program like this, on occasion, deals with proposed offerings
which attempt to expand the boundaries of academia. In such cases its
representatives are confronted with the significant challenge of
attempting to define what is an accreditable activity.
Rhetoric
Once the rhetoric of innovation and the simplistic dichotomies
(e.g., bureaucratic efficiency vs. student initiative) are swept away, it
becomes clear that a program like SCIRE must be able to temper its
emphasis upon curricular and instructional innovation with an
awareness of the legitimate academic and administrative constraints of
the University. Some balance must be achieved. 'Tempering' does not
mean thwarting innovative attempts — but it does require a serious
and thoughtful approach to the issues involved.
The problems surrounding academic innovation were not taken
seriously by most of the people associated with SCIRE this year.
Innovation became a slogan. It seemed to be equated with being
non-directive and non-judgemental. As in many free schools, the
people knew what they were against but gave little systematic
attention to what they stood for or how to achieve it.
Insufficient academic guidance and direction was offered this year
at SCIRE. Being responsive to students should mean more than being
a facilitator. Being responsive means listening to students and engaging
them in a dialogue. Being responsive means reacting in a variety of
ways, including providing guidance, direction, and supportive
criticism. Responsiveness should certainly be wider in scope than
taking a student suggestion and hastily attempting to transform it into
an accredited activity. Yet, in all too many cases this past year, that
was the way in which innovation and responsiveness to students was
defined at SCIRE.
Risks
Part of the responsibility of the people who run a program like
SCIRE is to determine which risks are worth taking. Frequently the
Board approved a proposal with little consideration of its
implications. There were few attempts to look beyond the immediate
case and attempt to devise ways of answering the questions it raised
(e.g., under what conditions do inexperienced instructors function
effectively? What are the conditions under which a study group works
best?).
In my view, the people running a program like SCIRE must be
prepared to raise such issues. The Director of such a program must
assert leadership in determining the acceptable limits of accreditable
activity. He must be able to work within legitimate institutional
constraints.
This did not happen this year at SCIRE. It must happen if the
program not only is to function effectively in the short run but have a
significant impact upon the University's students and curriculum.

SCIRE serves a valuable function at Stanford. By providing an
avenue for self-motivated students to develop their own academic
projects, this program has the potential to reinforce and reward
student initiative and provide academic options not available in the
standard curriculum. The program can also serve as a testing ground
for new curricular and instructional approaches. Unfortunately,
SCIRE fell far short of its potential this year.
Throughout the past academic year, as an ex officio member of the
SCIRE Policy Board, I frequently expressed concern at board
meetings about the unsatisfactory quality of many of the proposals
channeled to the Board by the Director, Ron Jones, and the
superficial nature of the program's credit review procedures. In
marked contrast to the functioning of the three other
extradepartmental programs with which I work (SWOPSI, Urban
Studies, and Undergraduate Specials), the Director and Policy Board
members of SCIRE have consistently demonstrated an unwillingness
to make critical judgements about proposed projects and courses.
They have also shown inadequate concern about University
requirements applying to the activity of the program (e.g., credit
review criteria, course approval deadlines, and instructor appointment
procedures). The Director, while energetic and enthusiastic with
students, particularly manifested these qualities. He approached the
credit review process as a hurdle to be satisfied minimally, in letter
rather than in spirit.

supportive of Jones although some acknowledged his academic and
administrative weaknesses. The statements tended to reinforce the
message that the Board had conveyed to us over the course of the
year: the academic and administrative components of the Director's
role were of minor importance.
Meeting
At the meeting with Jones and Hayes, the Dean expressed a desire
to meet with the Board as soon as possible to discuss Jones'
performance. We felt then, and still do, that the issues of the
performance of the Director and the future of the program are

separable. Professor Hayes, as the Board's representative, agreed to a
meeting between the Dean and the Board to discuss Jones'
performance. The Dean met with the Board on Tuesday, April 24,
after offering to do so earlier and after explaining to them that he
could meet with them for less than an hour on that particular
morning. During the meeting, Dean Gibbs indicated that he agreed
with my recommendation that Jones not receive a new appointment.
It is admittedly difficult for a program like SCIRE to function
effectively. It is, on the one hand, an organization with the mission of
being responsive to the needs and interests of students. On the other
hand, it is a University credit-granting agency having both academic
and administrative responsibilities.
A program like this, on occasion, deals with proposed offerings
which attempt to expand the boundaries of academia. In such cases its
representatives are confronted with the significant challenge of
attempting to define what is an accreditable activity.
Rhetoric
Once the rhetoric of innovation and the simplistic dichotomies
(e.g., bureaucratic efficiency vs. student initiative) are swept away, it
becomes clear that a program like SCIRE must be able to temper its
emphasis upon curricular and instructional innovation with an
awareness of the legitimate academic and administrative constraints of
the University. Some balance must be achieved. 'Tempering' does not
mean thwarting innovative attempts — but it does require a serious
and thoughtful approach to the issues involved.
The problems surrounding academic innovation were not taken
seriously by most of the people associated with SCIRE this year.
Innovation became a slogan. It seemed to be equated with being
non-directive and non-judgemental. As in many free schools, the
people knew what they were against but gave little systematic
attention to what they stood for or how to achieve it.
Insufficient academic guidance and direction was offered this year
at SCIRE. Being responsive to students should mean more than being
a facilitator. Being responsive means listening to students and engaging
them in a dialogue. Being responsive means reacting in a variety of
ways, including providing guidance, direction, and supportive
criticism. Responsiveness should certainly be wider in scope than
taking a student suggestion and hastily attempting to transform it into
an accredited activity. Yet, in all too many cases this past year, that
was the way in which innovation and responsiveness to students was
defined at SCIRE.
Risks
Part of the responsibility of the people who run a program like
SCIRE is to determine which risks are worth taking. Frequently the
Board approved a proposal with little consideration of its
implications. There were few attempts to look beyond the immediate
case and attempt to devise ways of answering the questions it raised
(e.g., under what conditions do inexperienced instructors function
effectively? What are the conditions under which a study group works
best?).
In my view, the people running a program like SCIRE must be
prepared to raise such issues. The Director of such a program must
assert leadership in determining the acceptable limits of accreditable
activity. He must be able to work within legitimate institutional
constraints.
This did not happen this year at SCIRE. It must happen if the
program not only is to function effectively in the short run but have a
significant impact upon the University's students and curriculum.

SCIRE serves a valuable function at Stanford. By providing an
avenue for self-motivated students to develop their own academic
projects, this program has the potential to reinforce and reward
student initiative and provide academic options not available in the
standard curriculum. The program can also serve as a testing ground
for new curricular and instructional approaches. Unfortunately,
SCIRE fell far short of its potential this year.
Throughout the past academic year, as an ex officio member of the
SCIRE Policy Board, I frequently expressed concern at board
meetings about the unsatisfactory quality of many of the proposals
channeled to the Board by the Director, Ron Jones, and the
superficial nature of the program's credit review procedures. In
marked contrast to the functioning of the three other
extradepartmental programs with which I work (SWOPSI, Urban
Studies, and Undergraduate Specials), the Director and Policy Board
members of SCIRE have consistently demonstrated an unwillingness
to make critical judgements about proposed projects and courses.
They have also shown inadequate concern about University
requirements applying to the activity of the program (e.g., credit
review criteria, course approval deadlines, and instructor appointment
procedures). The Director, while energetic and enthusiastic with
students, particularly manifested these qualities. He approached the
credit review process as a hurdle to be satisfied minimally, in letter
rather than in spirit.
Burden
As a result, the burden fell upon ODUS to ask the hard questions
and make the decisions necessary for an accreditation process to
function effectively. This is untenable as a long-run arrangement.
Although the Dean of Undergraduate Studies has the ultimate
responsibility for the quality of the extradepartmental program
offerings, representatives of those programs, especially the directors,
must exercise this responsibility also. Only the staff members of the
programs, the people who are in direct contact with the proposal
developers, are in a position to convey the legitimate concerns about
academic substance to the proposal developers in a manner which is
supportive enough to have positive educational results.
In spite of frequent efforts to point out weaknesses in proposals
and procedures to the Policy Board — and a number of conversations
about these topics with the director — the situation continued to
deteriorate during Winter Quarter. The Director swamped the Policy
Board with large numbers of often poorly developed proposals for
credit. This exacerbated the superficial credit review problem.
On April 16, I told Ron Jones that I had recommended to Dean
Gibbs that he not be offered a new appointment when his current one
terminated on June 30, 1973. The following day I attended a
hastily-convened Policy Board meeting and detailed to the members
the reasons behind my recommendation. Dean Gibbs met with Jones
and one of the faculty members of the Board, Professor W.C. Hayes,
on the 18th to discuss the matter further. The Dean also invited
statements from Board members. Five were received. All were
supportive of Jones although some acknowledged his academic and
administrative weaknesses. The statements tended to reinforce the
