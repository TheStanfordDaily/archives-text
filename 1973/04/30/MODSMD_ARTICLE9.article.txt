# The 						SCIRE Statement
## Dean's Actions Hostile To Innovation 
### 
r< SCIRE Policy Board

We, the undersigned members
of the SCIRE Policy Board,
hereby sever all association with
the office of James Gibbs, Dean
of Undergraduate Studies.
The Policy Board believes that
SCIRE must be a center where
students can initiate and direct
their own learning experiences.
Recent actions by the Dean have
made it clear that he does not
believe in a student center nor
does he consider students capable
of taking responsibility for their
own education.
The Dean terminated the
contract of SCIRE director Ron
Jones on April 26, 1973. This
action demonstrates the Dean's
lack of support for undergraduate
education in two ways. First, he
has put bureaucratic efficiency
above student innovation by firing
a director who works
exceptionally well with students
in facilitating their projects.
Second, by firing Ron without
consultation with the Policy
Board, the Dean has taken control
of the program from students and
faculty and has undermined the
autonomy of SCIRE.
We believe that the Dean's

actions are incompatible with the
concept of a student center, and
we find it intolerable to continue
our association with his office. We
therefore sever our ties with the
Dean's office and commit
ourselves to the establishment of a
new center for student-directed
education.

During the past year, the
SCIRE Policy Board has
concentrated on providing an
opportunity for students to
initiate and develop accreditable
courses and projects. The student
ideas granted academic credit by
the SCIRE Policy Board ranged
from the construction of an
optical observatory to Yemenite
Dance. The format of instruction
varied from the traditional lecture
approach to an experimental use
of study groups and
apprenticeships. Instructors in
SCIRE courses included a
minister, a builder of geo-rights, a
gay organizer and "many Stanford

students.
As students took a more active
role in planning their own
learning, the number of courses
accredited by SCIRE jumped
from 48 last year to 71 this year.
By the spring quarter, 481
students were participating in
SCIRE accredited activities
compared to 335 enrolled in the
preceeding year. With the
increasing effort by students to
direct some part of their
undergraduate education, there
was a corresponding increase in
tension between SCIRE and the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies.
It's important to remember
that SCIRE was formed in 1969
through student pressure to
provide a vehicle for accrediting
student-initiated ideas. SCIRE was
designated as a semi-autonomous
agency of six students and five
faculty members responsible to a
Faculty Senate committee called
the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies. In 1970, the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies' Office was
created to facilitate and innovate
undergraduate education at
Stanford. One major
responsibility of the Dean's office
was to provide support and
leadership for the
already-functioning
extra-departmental programs such
as SCIRE, SWOPSI, and Urban
Studies. From 1970 to the present
there has been a constant effort
by the Dean's office to
"institutionalize" SCIRE — and
SCIRE has resisted this move in
order to remain student-centered.
Struggle
During the past year, the
struggle between SCIRE and the
Dean's office has focused on what
is academic and the
responsibilities of SCIRE as a
center for innovation. Whereas the
SCIRE Policy Board encouraged
student ideas that broaden the
definition of what is academic,
the Dean's office maintained that
education at Stanford must
conform to the intellectual
standards and traditions of a
major university. In cases where
SCIRE supported students taking
an instructional role, the Dean's
office stipulated that instructors
must be credentialled with
previous teaching experience.
SCIRE saw this as a place where
students might get that teaching
experience.
SCIRE and the Dean's office
disagreed not only in what they
were doing, but, more important,
in how they were doing it. It was
the Dean's position that SCIRE,
as part of the University, should
behave like other departments in
the University. As such, SCIRE
should report and be responsible
to the Dean and should follow
University guidelines as to what is
academic and who is qualified to
teach. The six students and five
faculty members that comprise
the SCIRE Policy Board and the
staff felt that their mandate was
to be open to student ideas and
implement those ideas whenever
possible.
From the SCIRE perspective,
this goal required autonomy from
the formal University structure
for several reasons. One, it would
be impossible to sponsor and
encourage innovative ideas if
SCIRE were to enforce a
traditional definition of what is
academic and who can teach.
Two, in functioning as a
weathervane of student interests,
the SCIRE Board felt that it had
to stay somewhat outside the
university structure. It would
simply be impossible to be critical
of an institution if you had to
represent the interests of that
institution. Three, the SCIRE
Board felt that autonomy would
allow them to experiment with
their own governance and the
initiation of innovative programs

In addition to granting credit, it
was felt that a student center for
innovation had a responsibility to
actively explore ways for a faculty
and student policy board to work
together. Four, there was the
contention that a student and
faculty board would be more
responsive to student ideas than a
Dean who required that
innovation must always be
constrained by accepted standards
of academic excellence.
Senate
In Winter Quarter 1973, when
the Faculty Senate called for a
three-year operational
arrangement for SCIRE, these
differing opinions crystallized.
The Dean proposed an operational
charge for SCIRE in which he
would appoint the student
members to the Board, appoint
the faculty members to the Board,
appoint the director, and reserve
the right to veto any course
accredited by the SCIRE Board.
SCIRE proposed an alternative
plan for operation that provided
for students to be appointed by
the ASSU, faculty to be
appointed by the Committee of
Undergraduate Studies, a director
appointed by SCIRE faculty and
students, and the right to accredit
courses subject to censure or veto
by a student/faculty committee.
In a compromise arrangement, the
Faculty Senate granted the Dean
the power to appoint the SCIRE
director and board members and
established a special
subcommittee of faculty and
students to resolve any credit
disputes that might develop
between the Dean and SCIRE.
Six weeks after the Senate's
decision, the SCIRE Board
approved a course in Auto
Mechanics that was rejected by
the Dean's office. This was the
first case in which the differing
opinions of the Dean's office and
SCIRE would be tested. The
Credit Review Subcommittee
voted in favor of granting the
course credit. The Dean's response
to this decision was a statement
that the course proposal should
not have been forwarded to the
Board by the director — a power
the staff and Board felt should
not rest with any one individual.
On April 11, the Dean went
before the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies to
encourage a change in the criteria
for accepting courses for credit in
order to avoid future "mistakes"
like Auto Mechanics.
Challenge
Three weeks later, the SCIRE
Board assembled at Tresidder to
discuss with the Dean their plans
for the future of SCIRE. It was
clear that the Dean was irritated
over the increasing number of
courses being sponsored by
SCIRE and particularly, the
nature of some courses that were
outside the traditional boundaries
of academia. The passage of Auto
Mechanics represented the spectre
of students seriously challenging
the content and purpose of
undergraduate education. Adding
to the tension of this meeting was
the realization that the Dean
might act to dismiss the SCIRE
director.
As the meeting began it was
obvious that there was to be no
exchange of ideas. The Dean,
addressing the Board for the first
time, refused to hear the SCIRE
plans and expectations for next

year and proceeded to read a
statement declaring his reasons for
firing the SCIRE director. The
Dean had not conferred with the
Board about this decision. He
didn't even ask for their advice.
Following his statement the Dean
excused himself and turned the
meeting over to his assistant. In
the ensuing discussion the
Assistant Dean informed the
SCIRE Policy Board that the
word "policy" was a misnomer
and that they were now an
advisory board to the Dean.
It is the opinion of the SCIRE
Policy Board that if SCIRE is only
advisory to the Dean and if its
projects are subject to the
processing of a Dean's director,
the misnomer would be "The
Student Center for Innovation."
The Policy Board members
therefore sever all association with
the Dean's Center for Innovation.
We propose that it is time to move
ahead and to direct our energy to
the building of a real student
center. During the next few weeks
we plan to set up an autonomous
center and we will need your
involvement. This center not only
has a name but a purpose.

there has been a constant effort
by the Dean's office to
"institutionalize" SCIRE — and
SCIRE has resisted this move in
order to remain student-centered.
Struggle
During the past year, the
struggle between SCIRE and the
Dean's office has focused on what
is academic and the
responsibilities of SCIRE as a
center for innovation. Whereas the
SCIRE Policy Board encouraged
student ideas that broaden the
definition of what is academic,
the Dean's office maintained that
education at Stanford must
conform to the intellectual
standards and traditions of a
major university. In cases where
SCIRE supported students taking
an instructional role, the Dean's
office stipulated that instructors
must be credentialled with
previous teaching experience.
SCIRE saw this as a place where
students might get that teaching
experience.
SCIRE and the Dean's office
disagreed not only in what they
were doing, but, more important,
in how they were doing it. It was
the Dean's position that SCIRE,
as part of the University, should
behave like other departments in
the University. As such, SCIRE
should report and be responsible
to the Dean and should follow
University guidelines as to what is
academic and who is qualified to
teach. The six students and five
faculty members that comprise
the SCIRE Policy Board and the
staff felt that their mandate was
to be open to student ideas and
implement those ideas whenever
possible.
From the SCIRE perspective,
this goal required autonomy from
the formal University structure
for several reasons. One, it would
be impossible to sponsor and
encourage innovative ideas if
SCIRE were to enforce a
traditional definition of what is
academic and who can teach.
Two, in functioning as a
weathervane of student interests,
the SCIRE Board felt that it had
to stay somewhat outside the
university structure. It would
simply be impossible to be critical
of an institution if you had to
represent the interests of that
institution. Three, the SCIRE
Board felt that autonomy would
allow them to experiment with
their own governance and the
initiation of innovative programs

In addition to granting credit, it
was felt that a student center for
innovation had a responsibility to
actively explore ways for a faculty
and student policy board to work
together. Four, there was the
contention that a student and
faculty board would be more
responsive to student ideas than a
Dean who required that
innovation must always be
constrained by accepted standards
of academic excellence.
Senate
In Winter Quarter 1973, when
the Faculty Senate called for a
three-year operational
arrangement for SCIRE, these
differing opinions crystallized.
The Dean proposed an operational
charge for SCIRE in which he
would appoint the student
members to the Board, appoint
the faculty members to the Board,
appoint the director, and reserve
the right to veto any course
accredited by the SCIRE Board.
SCIRE proposed an alternative
plan for operation that provided
for students to be appointed by
the ASSU, faculty to be
appointed by the Committee of
Undergraduate Studies, a director
appointed by SCIRE faculty and
students, and the right to accredit
courses subject to censure or veto
by a student/faculty committee.
In a compromise arrangement, the
Faculty Senate granted the Dean
the power to appoint the SCIRE
director and board members and
established a special
subcommittee of faculty and
students to resolve any credit
disputes that might develop
between the Dean and SCIRE.
Six weeks after the Senate's
decision, the SCIRE Board
approved a course in Auto
Mechanics that was rejected by
the Dean's office. This was the
first case in which the differing
opinions of the Dean's office and
SCIRE would be tested. The
Credit Review Subcommittee
voted in favor of granting the
course credit. The Dean's response
to this decision was a statement
that the course proposal should
not have been forwarded to the
Board by the director — a power
the staff and Board felt should
not rest with any one individual.
On April 11, the Dean went
before the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies to
encourage a change in the criteria
for accepting courses for credit in
order to avoid future "mistakes"
like Auto Mechanics.
Challenge
Three weeks later, the SCIRE
Board assembled at Tresidder to
discuss with the Dean their plans
for the future of SCIRE. It was
clear that the Dean was irritated
over the increasing number of
courses being sponsored by
SCIRE and particularly, the
nature of some courses that were
outside the traditional boundaries
of academia. The passage of Auto
Mechanics represented the spectre
of students seriously challenging
the content and purpose of
undergraduate education. Adding
to the tension of this meeting was
the realization that the Dean
might act to dismiss the SCIRE
director.
As the meeting began it was
obvious that there was to be no
exchange of ideas. The Dean,
addressing the Board for the first
time, refused to hear the SCIRE
plans and expectations for next

year and proceeded to read a
statement declaring his reasons for
firing the SCIRE director. The
Dean had not conferred with the
Board about this decision. He
didn't even ask for their advice.
Following his statement the Dean
excused himself and turned the
meeting over to his assistant. In
the ensuing discussion the
Assistant Dean informed the
SCIRE Policy Board that the
word "policy" was a misnomer
and that they were now an
advisory board to the Dean.
It is the opinion of the SCIRE
Policy Board that if SCIRE is only
advisory to the Dean and if its
projects are subject to the
processing of a Dean's director,
the misnomer would be "The
Student Center for Innovation."
The Policy Board members
therefore sever all association with
the Dean's Center for Innovation.
We propose that it is time to move
ahead and to direct our energy to
the building of a real student
center. During the next few weeks
we plan to set up an autonomous
center and we will need your
involvement. This center not only
has a name but a purpose.

Policy Board.)
r< SCIRE Policy Board

We, the undersigned members
of the SCIRE Policy Board,
hereby sever all association with
the office of James Gibbs, Dean
of Undergraduate Studies.
The Policy Board believes that
SCIRE must be a center where
students can initiate and direct
their own learning experiences.
Recent actions by the Dean have
made it clear that he does not
believe in a student center nor
does he consider students capable
of taking responsibility for their
own education.
The Dean terminated the
contract of SCIRE director Ron
Jones on April 26, 1973. This
action demonstrates the Dean's
lack of support for undergraduate
education in two ways. First, he
has put bureaucratic efficiency
above student innovation by firing
a director who works
exceptionally well with students
in facilitating their projects.
Second, by firing Ron without
consultation with the Policy
Board, the Dean has taken control
of the program from students and
faculty and has undermined the
autonomy of SCIRE.
We believe that the Dean's

actions are incompatible with the
concept of a student center, and
we find it intolerable to continue
our association with his office. We
therefore sever our ties with the
Dean's office and commit
ourselves to the establishment of a
new center for student-directed
education.

During the past year, the
SCIRE Policy Board has
concentrated on providing an
opportunity for students to
initiate and develop accreditable
courses and projects. The student
ideas granted academic credit by
the SCIRE Policy Board ranged
from the construction of an
optical observatory to Yemenite
Dance. The format of instruction
varied from the traditional lecture
approach to an experimental use
of study groups and
apprenticeships. Instructors in
SCIRE courses included a
minister, a builder of geo-rights, a
gay organizer and "many Stanford

students.
As students took a more active
role in planning their own
learning, the number of courses
accredited by SCIRE jumped
from 48 last year to 71 this year.
By the spring quarter, 481
students were participating in
SCIRE accredited activities
compared to 335 enrolled in the
preceeding year. With the
increasing effort by students to
direct some part of their
undergraduate education, there
was a corresponding increase in
tension between SCIRE and the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies.
It's important to remember
that SCIRE was formed in 1969
through student pressure to
provide a vehicle for accrediting
student-initiated ideas. SCIRE was
designated as a semi-autonomous
agency of six students and five
faculty members responsible to a
Faculty Senate committee called
the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies. In 1970, the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies' Office was
created to facilitate and innovate
undergraduate education at
Stanford. One major
responsibility of the Dean's office
was to provide support and
leadership for the
already-functioning
extra-departmental programs such
as SCIRE, SWOPSI, and Urban
Studies. From 1970 to the present
there has been a constant effort
by the Dean's office to
"institutionalize" SCIRE — and
SCIRE has resisted this move in

Faculty Senate granted the Dean
the power to appoint the SCIRE
director and board members and
established a special
subcommittee of faculty and
students to resolve any credit
disputes that might develop
between the Dean and SCIRE.
Six weeks after the Senate's
decision, the SCIRE Board
approved a course in Auto
Mechanics that was rejected by
the Dean's office. This was the
first case in which the differing
opinions of the Dean's office and
SCIRE would be tested. The
Credit Review Subcommittee
voted in favor of granting the
course credit. The Dean's response
to this decision was a statement
that the course proposal should
not have been forwarded to the
Board by the director — a power
the staff and Board felt should
not rest with any one individual.
On April 11, the Dean went
before the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies to
encourage a change in the criteria
for accepting courses for credit in
order to avoid future "mistakes"
like Auto Mechanics.
Challenge
Three weeks later, the SCIRE
Board assembled at Tresidder to
discuss with the Dean their plans
for the future of SCIRE. It was
clear that the Dean was irritated
over the increasing number of
courses being sponsored by
SCIRE and particularly, the
nature of some courses that were
outside the traditional boundaries
of academia. The passage of Auto
Mechanics represented the spectre
of students seriously challenging
the content and purpose of
undergraduate education. Adding
to the tension of this meeting was
the realization that the Dean
might act to dismiss the SCIRE
director.
As the meeting began it was
obvious that there was to be no
exchange of ideas. The Dean,
addressing the Board for the first
time, refused to hear the SCIRE
plans and expectations for next

year and proceeded to read a
statement declaring his reasons for
firing the SCIRE director. The
Dean had not conferred with the
Board about this decision. He
didn't even ask for their advice.
Following his statement the Dean
excused himself and turned the
meeting over to his assistant. In
the ensuing discussion the
Assistant Dean informed the
SCIRE Policy Board that the
word "policy" was a misnomer
and that they were now an
advisory board to the Dean.
It is the opinion of the SCIRE
Policy Board that if SCIRE is only
advisory to the Dean and if its
projects are subject to the
processing of a Dean's director,
the misnomer would be "The
Student Center for Innovation."
The Policy Board members
therefore sever all association with
the Dean's Center for Innovation.
We propose that it is time to move
ahead and to direct our energy to
the building of a real student
center. During the next few weeks
we plan to set up an autonomous
center and we will need your
involvement. This center not only
has a name but a purpose.

r< SCIRE Policy Board

We, the undersigned members
of the SCIRE Policy Board,
hereby sever all association with
the office of James Gibbs, Dean
of Undergraduate Studies.
The Policy Board believes that
SCIRE must be a center where
students can initiate and direct
their own learning experiences.
Recent actions by the Dean have
made it clear that he does not
believe in a student center nor
does he consider students capable
of taking responsibility for their
own education.
The Dean terminated the
contract of SCIRE director Ron
Jones on April 26, 1973. This
action demonstrates the Dean's
lack of support for undergraduate
education in two ways. First, he
has put bureaucratic efficiency
above student innovation by firing
a director who works
exceptionally well with students
in facilitating their projects.
Second, by firing Ron without
consultation with the Policy
Board, the Dean has taken control
of the program from students and
faculty and has undermined the
autonomy of SCIRE.
We believe that the Dean's

actions are incompatible with the
concept of a student center, and
we find it intolerable to continue
our association with his office. We
therefore sever our ties with the
Dean's office and commit
ourselves to the establishment of a
new center for student-directed
education.

During the past year, the
SCIRE Policy Board has
concentrated on providing an
opportunity for students to
initiate and develop accreditable
courses and projects. The student
ideas granted academic credit by
the SCIRE Policy Board ranged
from the construction of an
optical observatory to Yemenite
Dance. The format of instruction
varied from the traditional lecture
approach to an experimental use
of study groups and
apprenticeships. Instructors in
SCIRE courses included a
minister, a builder of geo-rights, a
gay organizer and "many Stanford

students.
As students took a more active
role in planning their own
learning, the number of courses
accredited by SCIRE jumped
from 48 last year to 71 this year.
By the spring quarter, 481
students were participating in
SCIRE accredited activities
compared to 335 enrolled in the
preceeding year. With the
increasing effort by students to
direct some part of their
undergraduate education, there
was a corresponding increase in
tension between SCIRE and the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies.
It's important to remember
that SCIRE was formed in 1969
through student pressure to
provide a vehicle for accrediting
student-initiated ideas. SCIRE was
designated as a semi-autonomous
agency of six students and five
faculty members responsible to a
Faculty Senate committee called
the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies. In 1970, the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies' Office was
created to facilitate and innovate
undergraduate education at
Stanford. One major
responsibility of the Dean's office
was to provide support and
leadership for the
already-functioning
extra-departmental programs such
as SCIRE, SWOPSI, and Urban
Studies. From 1970 to the present
there has been a constant effort
by the Dean's office to
"institutionalize" SCIRE — and
SCIRE has resisted this move in
order to remain student-centered.
Struggle
During the past year, the
struggle between SCIRE and the
Dean's office has focused on what
is academic and the
responsibilities of SCIRE as a
center for innovation. Whereas the
SCIRE Policy Board encouraged
student ideas that broaden the
definition of what is academic,
the Dean's office maintained that
education at Stanford must
conform to the intellectual
standards and traditions of a
major university. In cases where
SCIRE supported students taking
an instructional role, the Dean's
office stipulated that instructors
must be credentialled with
previous teaching experience.
SCIRE saw this as a place where
students might get that teaching
experience.
SCIRE and the Dean's office
disagreed not only in what they
were doing, but, more important,
in how they were doing it. It was
the Dean's position that SCIRE,
as part of the University, should
behave like other departments in
the University. As such, SCIRE
should report and be responsible
to the Dean and should follow
University guidelines as to what is
academic and who is qualified to
teach. The six students and five
faculty members that comprise
the SCIRE Policy Board and the
staff felt that their mandate was
to be open to student ideas and
implement those ideas whenever
possible.
From the SCIRE perspective,
this goal required autonomy from
the formal University structure
for several reasons. One, it would
be impossible to sponsor and
encourage innovative ideas if
SCIRE were to enforce a
traditional definition of what is
academic and who can teach.
Two, in functioning as a
weathervane of student interests,
the SCIRE Board felt that it had
to stay somewhat outside the
university structure. It would
simply be impossible to be critical
of an institution if you had to
represent the interests of that
institution. Three, the SCIRE
Board felt that autonomy would
allow them to experiment with
their own governance and the
initiation of innovative programs

In addition to granting credit, it
was felt that a student center for
innovation had a responsibility to
actively explore ways for a faculty
and student policy board to work
together. Four, there was the
contention that a student and
faculty board would be more
responsive to student ideas than a
Dean who required that
innovation must always be
constrained by accepted standards
of academic excellence.
Senate
In Winter Quarter 1973, when
the Faculty Senate called for a
three-year operational
arrangement for SCIRE, these
differing opinions crystallized.
The Dean proposed an operational
charge for SCIRE in which he
would appoint the student
members to the Board, appoint
the faculty members to the Board,
appoint the director, and reserve
the right to veto any course
accredited by the SCIRE Board.
SCIRE proposed an alternative
plan for operation that provided
for students to be appointed by
the ASSU, faculty to be
appointed by the Committee of
Undergraduate Studies, a director
appointed by SCIRE faculty and
students, and the right to accredit
courses subject to censure or veto
by a student/faculty committee.
In a compromise arrangement, the
Faculty Senate granted the Dean
the power to appoint the SCIRE
director and board members and
established a special
subcommittee of faculty and
students to resolve any credit
disputes that might develop
between the Dean and SCIRE.
Six weeks after the Senate's
decision, the SCIRE Board
approved a course in Auto
Mechanics that was rejected by
the Dean's office. This was the
first case in which the differing

SCIRE would be tested. The

The Policy Board believes that
SCIRE must be a center where
students can initiate and direct
their own learning experiences.
Recent actions by the Dean have
made it clear that he does not
believe in a student center nor
does he consider students capable
of taking responsibility for their
own education.
The Dean terminated the
contract of SCIRE director Ron
Jones on April 26, 1973. This
action demonstrates the Dean's
lack of support for undergraduate
education in two ways. First, he
has put bureaucratic efficiency
above student innovation by firing
a director who works
exceptionally well with students
in facilitating their projects.
Second, by firing Ron without
consultation with the Policy
Board, the Dean has taken control
of the program from students and
faculty and has undermined the
autonomy of SCIRE.
We believe that the Dean's

actions are incompatible with the
concept of a student center, and
we find it intolerable to continue
our association with his office. We
therefore sever our ties with the
Dean's office and commit
ourselves to the establishment of a
new center for student-directed
education.

During the past year, the
SCIRE Policy Board has
concentrated on providing an
opportunity for students to
initiate and develop accreditable
courses and projects. The student
ideas granted academic credit by
the SCIRE Policy Board ranged
from the construction of an
optical observatory to Yemenite
Dance. The format of instruction
varied from the traditional lecture
approach to an experimental use
of study groups and
apprenticeships. Instructors in
SCIRE courses included a
minister, a builder of geo-rights, a
gay organizer and "many Stanford

students.
As students took a more active
role in planning their own
learning, the number of courses
accredited by SCIRE jumped
from 48 last year to 71 this year.
By the spring quarter, 481
students were participating in
SCIRE accredited activities
compared to 335 enrolled in the
preceeding year. With the
increasing effort by students to
direct some part of their
undergraduate education, there
was a corresponding increase in
tension between SCIRE and the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies.
It's important to remember
that SCIRE was formed in 1969
through student pressure to
provide a vehicle for accrediting
student-initiated ideas. SCIRE was
designated as a semi-autonomous
agency of six students and five
faculty members responsible to a
Faculty Senate committee called
the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies. In 1970, the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies' Office was
created to facilitate and innovate
undergraduate education at
Stanford. One major
responsibility of the Dean's office
was to provide support and
leadership for the
already-functioning
extra-departmental programs such
as SCIRE, SWOPSI, and Urban
Studies. From 1970 to the present
there has been a constant effort
by the Dean's office to
"institutionalize" SCIRE — and
SCIRE has resisted this move in
order to remain student-centered.
Struggle
During the past year, the
struggle between SCIRE and the
Dean's office has focused on what
is academic and the
responsibilities of SCIRE as a
center for innovation. Whereas the
SCIRE Policy Board encouraged
student ideas that broaden the
definition of what is academic,
the Dean's office maintained that
education at Stanford must
conform to the intellectual
standards and traditions of a
major university. In cases where
SCIRE supported students taking
an instructional role, the Dean's
office stipulated that instructors
must be credentialled with
previous teaching experience.
SCIRE saw this as a place where
students might get that teaching
experience.
SCIRE and the Dean's office
disagreed not only in what they
were doing, but, more important,
in how they were doing it. It was
the Dean's position that SCIRE,
as part of the University, should
behave like other departments in
the University. As such, SCIRE
should report and be responsible
to the Dean and should follow
University guidelines as to what is
academic and who is qualified to
teach. The six students and five
faculty members that comprise
the SCIRE Policy Board and the
staff felt that their mandate was
to be open to student ideas and
implement those ideas whenever
possible.
From the SCIRE perspective,
this goal required autonomy from
the formal University structure
for several reasons. One, it would
be impossible to sponsor and
encourage innovative ideas if
SCIRE were to enforce a
traditional definition of what is
academic and who can teach.
Two, in functioning as a
weathervane of student interests,
the SCIRE Board felt that it had
to stay somewhat outside the
university structure. It would
simply be impossible to be critical
of an institution if you had to
represent the interests of that
institution. Three, the SCIRE
Board felt that autonomy would
allow them to experiment with
their own governance and the
initiation of innovative programs

In addition to granting credit, it
was felt that a student center for
innovation had a responsibility to
actively explore ways for a faculty
and student policy board to work
together. Four, there was the
contention that a student and
faculty board would be more
responsive to student ideas than a
Dean who required that
innovation must always be
constrained by accepted standards
of academic excellence.
Senate
In Winter Quarter 1973, when
the Faculty Senate called for a
three-year operational
arrangement for SCIRE, these
differing opinions crystallized.
The Dean proposed an operational
charge for SCIRE in which he
would appoint the student
members to the Board, appoint
the faculty members to the Board,
appoint the director, and reserve
the right to veto any course
accredited by the SCIRE Board.
SCIRE proposed an alternative
plan for operation that provided
for students to be appointed by
the ASSU, faculty to be
appointed by the Committee of
Undergraduate Studies, a director
appointed by SCIRE faculty and
students, and the right to accredit
courses subject to censure or veto
by a student/faculty committee.
In a compromise arrangement, the
Faculty Senate granted the Dean
the power to appoint the SCIRE
director and board members and
established a special
subcommittee of faculty and
students to resolve any credit
disputes that might develop
between the Dean and SCIRE.
Six weeks after the Senate's
decision, the SCIRE Board
approved a course in Auto
Mechanics that was rejected by
the Dean's office. This was the
first case in which the differing
opinions of the Dean's office and
SCIRE would be tested. The
Credit Review Subcommittee
voted in favor of granting the
course credit. The Dean's response
to this decision was a statement
that the course proposal should
not have been forwarded to the
Board by the director — a power
the staff and Board felt should
not rest with any one individual.
On April 11, the Dean went
before the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies to
encourage a change in the criteria
for accepting courses for credit in
order to avoid future "mistakes"
like Auto Mechanics.
Challenge
Three weeks later, the SCIRE
Board assembled at Tresidder to
discuss with the Dean their plans
for the future of SCIRE. It was
clear that the Dean was irritated
over the increasing number of
courses being sponsored by
SCIRE and particularly, the
nature of some courses that were
outside the traditional boundaries
of academia. The passage of Auto
Mechanics represented the spectre
of students seriously challenging
the content and purpose of
undergraduate education. Adding
to the tension of this meeting was
the realization that the Dean
might act to dismiss the SCIRE
director.
As the meeting began it was
obvious that there was to be no
exchange of ideas. The Dean,
addressing the Board for the first
time, refused to hear the SCIRE
plans and expectations for next

year and proceeded to read a
statement declaring his reasons for
firing the SCIRE director. The
Dean had not conferred with the
Board about this decision. He
didn't even ask for their advice.
Following his statement the Dean
excused himself and turned the
meeting over to his assistant. In
the ensuing discussion the
Assistant Dean informed the
SCIRE Policy Board that the
word "policy" was a misnomer
and that they were now an
advisory board to the Dean.
It is the opinion of the SCIRE
Policy Board that if SCIRE is only
advisory to the Dean and if its
projects are subject to the
processing of a Dean's director,
the misnomer would be "The
Student Center for Innovation."
The Policy Board members
therefore sever all association with
the Dean's Center for Innovation.
We propose that it is time to move
ahead and to direct our energy to
the building of a real student
center. During the next few weeks
we plan to set up an autonomous
center and we will need your
involvement. This center not only
has a name but a purpose.

struggle between SCIRE and the
Dean's office has focused on what
is academic and the
responsibilities of SCIRE as a
center for innovation. Whereas the
SCIRE Policy Board encouraged
student ideas that broaden the
definition of what is academic,
the Dean's office maintained that
education at Stanford must
conform to the intellectual
standards and traditions of a
major university. In cases where
SCIRE supported students taking
an instructional role, the Dean's
office stipulated that instructors
must be credentialled with
previous teaching experience.
SCIRE saw this as a place where
students might get that teaching
experience.
SCIRE and the Dean's office
disagreed not only in what they
were doing, but, more important,
in how they were doing it. It was
the Dean's position that SCIRE,
as part of the University, should
behave like other departments in
the University. As such, SCIRE
should report and be responsible
to the Dean and should follow
University guidelines as to what is
academic and who is qualified to
teach. The six students and five
faculty members that comprise
the SCIRE Policy Board and the
staff felt that their mandate was
to be open to student ideas and
implement those ideas whenever
possible.
From the SCIRE perspective,
this goal required autonomy from
the formal University structure
for several reasons. One, it would
be impossible to sponsor and
encourage innovative ideas if
SCIRE were to enforce a
traditional definition of what is
academic and who can teach.
Two, in functioning as a
weathervane of student interests,
the SCIRE Board felt that it had
to stay somewhat outside the
university structure. It would
simply be impossible to be critical
of an institution if you had to
represent the interests of that
institution. Three, the SCIRE
Board felt that autonomy would
allow them to experiment with
their own governance and the
initiation of innovative programs

In addition to granting credit, it
was felt that a student center for
innovation had a responsibility to
actively explore ways for a faculty
and student policy board to work
together. Four, there was the
contention that a student and
faculty board would be more
responsive to student ideas than a
Dean who required that
innovation must always be
constrained by accepted standards
of academic excellence.
Senate
In Winter Quarter 1973, when
the Faculty Senate called for a
three-year operational
arrangement for SCIRE, these
differing opinions crystallized.
The Dean proposed an operational
charge for SCIRE in which he
would appoint the student
members to the Board, appoint
the faculty members to the Board,
appoint the director, and reserve
the right to veto any course
accredited by the SCIRE Board.
SCIRE proposed an alternative
plan for operation that provided
for students to be appointed by
the ASSU, faculty to be
appointed by the Committee of
Undergraduate Studies, a director
appointed by SCIRE faculty and
students, and the right to accredit
courses subject to censure or veto
by a student/faculty committee.
In a compromise arrangement, the
Faculty Senate granted the Dean
the power to appoint the SCIRE
director and board members and
established a special
subcommittee of faculty and
students to resolve any credit
disputes that might develop
between the Dean and SCIRE.
Six weeks after the Senate's
decision, the SCIRE Board
approved a course in Auto
Mechanics that was rejected by
the Dean's office. This was the
first case in which the differing
opinions of the Dean's office and
SCIRE would be tested. The
Credit Review Subcommittee
voted in favor of granting the
course credit. The Dean's response
to this decision was a statement
that the course proposal should
not have been forwarded to the
Board by the director — a power
the staff and Board felt should
not rest with any one individual.
On April 11, the Dean went
before the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies to
encourage a change in the criteria
for accepting courses for credit in
order to avoid future "mistakes"
like Auto Mechanics.
Challenge
Three weeks later, the SCIRE
Board assembled at Tresidder to
discuss with the Dean their plans
for the future of SCIRE. It was
clear that the Dean was irritated
over the increasing number of
courses being sponsored by
SCIRE and particularly, the
nature of some courses that were
outside the traditional boundaries
of academia. The passage of Auto
Mechanics represented the spectre
of students seriously challenging
the content and purpose of
undergraduate education. Adding
to the tension of this meeting was
the realization that the Dean
might act to dismiss the SCIRE
director.
As the meeting began it was
obvious that there was to be no
exchange of ideas. The Dean,
addressing the Board for the first
time, refused to hear the SCIRE
plans and expectations for next

year and proceeded to read a
statement declaring his reasons for
firing the SCIRE director. The
Dean had not conferred with the
Board about this decision. He
didn't even ask for their advice.
Following his statement the Dean
excused himself and turned the
meeting over to his assistant. In
the ensuing discussion the
Assistant Dean informed the
SCIRE Policy Board that the
word "policy" was a misnomer
and that they were now an
advisory board to the Dean.
It is the opinion of the SCIRE
Policy Board that if SCIRE is only
advisory to the Dean and if its
projects are subject to the
processing of a Dean's director,
the misnomer would be "The
Student Center for Innovation."
The Policy Board members
therefore sever all association with
the Dean's Center for Innovation.
We propose that it is time to move
ahead and to direct our energy to
the building of a real student
center. During the next few weeks
we plan to set up an autonomous
center and we will need your
involvement. This center not only
has a name but a purpose.
