# Watergate Forces White House Shakeup
## Three Top Presidential Aides Resign; Nixon Accepts Full Responsibility 
### Associated Press 
WASHINGTON — President Nixon
told the nation last night that he
accepts final responsibility for the
Watergate scandal which led him to
accept the resignations of top aides
H.R. Haldeman and John D.
Ehrlichman, and Atty. Gen. Richard
G. Kleindienst.
In an address to the nation, hours
after the major shakeup in his
administration, the President said the
blame belongs at the top.
"I accept it,"he said in a nationally
broadcast and televised address.
In the shakeup, Nixon fired
Counsel to the President John W. Dean
111 and nominated Secretary of
Defense Elliot L. Richardson to be
attorney general.
Special Prosecutor?
The President gave Richardson the
job of overseeing the administration's
Watergate investigation and of naming
a special prosecutor to probe the
incident if Richardson deems one
necessary.
Until late March, Nixon said, he
had been assured by those around him
that no one in the administration was
involved in the bugging and
wiretapping.
"However, new information then
came to me which persuaded me that
there was a real possibility some of
these charges were true, and suggested
further that there had been an effort
to conceal these facts both from the
public, from you, and from me,"
Nixon said.
No Advance Knowledge
Nixon disclaimed any advance
knowledge of the June 17 break-in at
Democratic national headquarters.
The President said that in March he
ordered an intensive new inquiry into
the Watergate incident, with the
results to be reported directly to him.
He said he was determined that the
truth be brought out, no matter who
was involved.
Finest Servants
The resignations of Haldeman and
Ehrlichman as top White House aides,
Nixon said, did not imply their guilt.
He called them two of the finest
public servants he had ever known.
"I wanted to be fair, but I knew
that in the final analysis the integrity

of this office and public faith in the
integrity of this office would have to
take priority over all personal
considerations," Nixon said.
The President announced Dean's
dismissal in a single sentence without
comment.
Dean had conducted an inquiry
into the Watergate affair last summer
and reported that there was no
wrongdoing by White House or Nixon
campaign officials.
Free Press
Nixon praised the federal judge and
the free press that discovered the
intrigue behind the June 17 incident at
Democratic National Committee
headquarters in the Watergate office
building.
He said the affair represented a
series of illegal acts, bad judgments,
and overzealousness by a number of
individuals.
"America in its political campaigns
must never again fall into the trap of
letting the end, no matter how great
that end is, justify the means," Nixon
said.
Political Reforms
With that he called for unspecified
political reforms, "a new set of
standards," to ensure that future
campaigns be as free of abuses as
possible.
He made no specific proposals, but
he has assigned Richardson the task of
determining what specific changes in
federal campaign laws are necessary.
Nixon said Kleindienst believed he
could not continue as attorney general
because it appears his close associates
may be implicated in the Watergate
case.
Kleindienst already had withdrawn
from the case on the same grounds.
Senate sources have accused
Haldeman and Ehrlichman of
involvement in an alleged White House
attempt to cover up the Watergate
wiretapping affair.
Democrats
Top Democrats said that Nixon's
choice of a new attorney general from
within his administration won't satisfy
the public demand for total disclosure
of all facts surrounding the Watergate
case.
National Committee Chairman

Robert S. Strauss and Govs. Marvin
Mandel of Maryland, Wendell Ford of
Kentucky, Milton Shapp of
Pennsylvania and John J. Gilligan of
Ohio immediately criticized Nixon's
choice of Richardson to replace
Kleindienst.
The announcement of the
personnel shakeup at the pinnacle of
government followed a weekend of
seclusion for the President in which he
talked at Camp David, Md., with
Haldeman and Ehrlichman,
respectively his chief of staff and
assistant for domestic affairs.
Haldeman, 46, regarded as the most
powerful man on the White House

staff, said in a statement that it had
become "virtually impossible ... for
me to carry on my regular
responsibilities in the White House"
because of what he called allegations,
innuendos and a "flood of stories
arising every day from all sorts of
sources."
Ehrlichman, 48, has remained
relatively untouched by recent
Watergate disclosures until last week
when it was disclosed acting FBI
Director L. Patrick Gray 111 destroyed
sensitive documents given him by
Ehrlichman and Dean. Gray resigned
last Friday, hours after that report was
published.

Senate sources have accused
Haldeman and Ehrlichman of
involvement in an alleged White House
attempt to cover up the Watergate
wiretapping affair.
Democrats
Top Democrats said that Nixon's
choice of a new attorney general from
within his administration won't satisfy
the public demand for total disclosure
of all facts surrounding the Watergate
case.
National Committee Chairman

Robert S. Strauss and Govs. Marvin
Mandel of Maryland, Wendell Ford of
Kentucky, Milton Shapp of
Pennsylvania and John J. Gilligan of
Ohio immediately criticized Nixon's
choice of Richardson to replace
Kleindienst.
The announcement of the
personnel shakeup at the pinnacle of
government followed a weekend of
seclusion for the President in which he
talked at Camp David, Md., with
Haldeman and Ehrlichman,
respectively his chief of staff and
assistant for domestic affairs.
Haldeman, 46, regarded as the most
powerful man on the White House

staff, said in a statement that it had
become "virtually impossible ... for
me to carry on my regular
responsibilities in the White House"
because of what he called allegations,
innuendos and a "flood of stories
arising every day from all sorts of
sources."
Ehrlichman, 48, has remained
relatively untouched by recent
Watergate disclosures until last week
when it was disclosed acting FBI
Director L. Patrick Gray 111 destroyed
sensitive documents given him by
Ehrlichman and Dean. Gray resigned
last Friday, hours after that report was
published.
WASHINGTON — President Nixon
told the nation last night that he
accepts final responsibility for the
Watergate scandal which led him to
accept the resignations of top aides
H.R. Haldeman and John D.
Ehrlichman, and Atty. Gen. Richard
G. Kleindienst.
In an address to the nation, hours
after the major shakeup in his
administration, the President said the
blame belongs at the top.
"I accept it,"he said in a nationally
broadcast and televised address.
In the shakeup, Nixon fired
Counsel to the President John W. Dean
111 and nominated Secretary of
Defense Elliot L. Richardson to be
attorney general.
Special Prosecutor?
The President gave Richardson the
job of overseeing the administration's
Watergate investigation and of naming
a special prosecutor to probe the
incident if Richardson deems one
necessary.
Until late March, Nixon said, he
had been assured by those around him
that no one in the administration was
involved in the bugging and
wiretapping.
"However, new information then
came to me which persuaded me that
there was a real possibility some of
these charges were true, and suggested
further that there had been an effort
to conceal these facts both from the
public, from you, and from me,"
Nixon said.
No Advance Knowledge
Nixon disclaimed any advance
knowledge of the June 17 break-in at
Democratic national headquarters.
The President said that in March he
ordered an intensive new inquiry into
the Watergate incident, with the
results to be reported directly to him.
He said he was determined that the
truth be brought out, no matter who
was involved.
Finest Servants
The resignations of Haldeman and
Ehrlichman as top White House aides,
Nixon said, did not imply their guilt.
He called them two of the finest
public servants he had ever known.
"I wanted to be fair, but I knew
that in the final analysis the integrity

of this office and public faith in the
integrity of this office would have to
take priority over all personal
considerations," Nixon said.
The President announced Dean's
dismissal in a single sentence without
comment.
Dean had conducted an inquiry
into the Watergate affair last summer
and reported that there was no
wrongdoing by White House or Nixon
campaign officials.
Free Press
Nixon praised the federal judge and
the free press that discovered the
intrigue behind the June 17 incident at
Democratic National Committee
headquarters in the Watergate office
building.
He said the affair represented a
series of illegal acts, bad judgments,
and overzealousness by a number of
individuals.
"America in its political campaigns
must never again fall into the trap of
letting the end, no matter how great
that end is, justify the means," Nixon
said.
Political Reforms
With that he called for unspecified
political reforms, "a new set of
standards," to ensure that future
campaigns be as free of abuses as
possible.
He made no specific proposals, but
he has assigned Richardson the task of
determining what specific changes in
federal campaign laws are necessary.
Nixon said Kleindienst believed he
could not continue as attorney general
because it appears his close associates
may be implicated in the Watergate
case.
Kleindienst already had withdrawn
from the case on the same grounds.

public servants he had ever known.
"I wanted to be fair, but I knew
that in the final analysis the integrity

of this office and public faith in the
integrity of this office would have to
take priority over all personal
considerations," Nixon said.
The President announced Dean's
dismissal in a single sentence without
comment.
Dean had conducted an inquiry
into the Watergate affair last summer
and reported that there was no
wrongdoing by White House or Nixon
campaign officials.
Free Press
Nixon praised the federal judge and
the free press that discovered the
intrigue behind the June 17 incident at
Democratic National Committee
headquarters in the Watergate office
building.
He said the affair represented a
series of illegal acts, bad judgments,
and overzealousness by a number of
individuals.
"America in its political campaigns
must never again fall into the trap of
letting the end, no matter how great
that end is, justify the means," Nixon
said.
Political Reforms
With that he called for unspecified
political reforms, "a new set of
standards," to ensure that future
campaigns be as free of abuses as
possible.
He made no specific proposals, but
he has assigned Richardson the task of
determining what specific changes in
federal campaign laws are necessary.
Nixon said Kleindienst believed he
could not continue as attorney general
because it appears his close associates
may be implicated in the Watergate
case.
Kleindienst already had withdrawn
from the case on the same grounds.
Senate sources have accused
Haldeman and Ehrlichman of
involvement in an alleged White House
attempt to cover up the Watergate
wiretapping affair.
Democrats
Top Democrats said that Nixon's
choice of a new attorney general from
within his administration won't satisfy
the public demand for total disclosure
of all facts surrounding the Watergate
case.
National Committee Chairman

Robert S. Strauss and Govs. Marvin
Mandel of Maryland, Wendell Ford of
Kentucky, Milton Shapp of
Pennsylvania and John J. Gilligan of
Ohio immediately criticized Nixon's
choice of Richardson to replace
Kleindienst.
The announcement of the
personnel shakeup at the pinnacle of
government followed a weekend of
seclusion for the President in which he
talked at Camp David, Md., with
Haldeman and Ehrlichman,
respectively his chief of staff and
assistant for domestic affairs.
Haldeman, 46, regarded as the most
powerful man on the White House

staff, said in a statement that it had
become "virtually impossible ... for
me to carry on my regular
responsibilities in the White House"
because of what he called allegations,
innuendos and a "flood of stories
arising every day from all sorts of
sources."
Ehrlichman, 48, has remained
relatively untouched by recent
Watergate disclosures until last week
when it was disclosed acting FBI
Director L. Patrick Gray 111 destroyed
sensitive documents given him by
Ehrlichman and Dean. Gray resigned
last Friday, hours after that report was
published.
