# American Investments And Martial Law
## The 						Philippines: A New Vietnam? 
### 
"The Philippines: Another
Vietnam?" is the title of Gabriel
Kolko's January article in
Commonweal. There are
compelling reasons for the
comparison. No less an observer
than President Marcos himself
evoked it (to an American public)
in a "Meet The Press" interview
shortly after declaring martial law
on September 22.
Marcos' point was that
American support for his martial
law government was necessary to
prevent another Vietnam. In
September the rationale for
declaring martial law was the
presence of an "imminent
communist threat." Since that
time resistance to government
troops has concentrated in
Moslem (not communist areas and

the government—after first
associating the Moslems with the
Maoists—shifted its emphasis to
law and order and the necessity
for national discipline in a "New
Society." Smoking in public
places and jaywalking in Manila
were prohibited; opposition party
candidates, members of the press,
and students were arrested;
newspapers and universities were
closed; and political
dissent—"rumor mongoring"—
outlawed.
Kolko suspects, as do most
Filipinos, more personal motives
behind the martial law
declaration. In the nation-wide
senatorial contest of 1971 the
election of seven Liberal party
candidates constituted a popular
repudiation of Marcos' policies.

Spending in his 1968 re-election
campaing—Marcos is the only
Philippine president ever to be
reelected—is generally suspected
as having contributed to the
halving of the peso's buying
power shortly thereafter. Recent
floods aggravated the national
economic crisis. Constitutionally
prohibited from seeking a third
term, Marcos may not attempt to
stay in power indefinitely with
martial law powers.
American private investment in
the Philippines totals more than a
billion dollars—coaxed there by
post-war treaties, particularly the
Laurel-Langley Agreement. This
gives American investment
privileges equal to those of a
Filipino. By April, 1972 the
country's foreign debt was more
than $2.2 billion, owed largely to
American owned or controlled
banks; 18,400 American military
personel remain on the islands at
Clark Air Force Base, Subic Naval
Base, and six minor installations;
and the 60,000 man Philippine
army is led by U.S. trained
officers.
Since martial law the
government has encouraged
foreign investment "in a more
stable climate" and created terms
meant to entice foreign companies
into oil exploration of the
southern islands.
The martial law declaration
also nullified recent Philippine
Supreme Court rulings which
challenged American investment
privileges. (These rulings would
have required Americans to
reduce their 40 percent ownership
in Philippine firms and prevented
Americans from sitting on boards
or managing such firms.)
These Supreme Court rulings
reflect what Kolko believes to be

the greatest immediate threat to
Marcos—and to American
interests: nationalism on the part
of the oligarchy, the students, a
growing Catholic Left within the
lower clergy and laity in Manila,
and the peasantry after 1968.
A member of the clergy,
Father Bruno Hicks, will speak at
4:15 on Tuesday, May 1, at the
International Center. Father Hicks
worked for ten years in the
Phillipines, organizing community

projects, trade unions, tenant and
fieldworkers' associations, and a
radio station among the poor
laborers on the sugar-growing
island of Negras. He was arrested
for "subversion" the day after
martial law was declared, held in
prison without charge or trial for
a month, and finally deported. His
topic will be "Life in the
Phillipines under Martial Law."
