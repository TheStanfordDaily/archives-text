Phi Delts
Editor:
We are disgusted and outraged
by the gross exploitation of
women evidenced at the Phi Delt's
party on Friday, April 20. We
demand that the University take
severe action to redress this
deplorable act. We as a
community cannot allow such
exploitation to be condoned
through silence.
It saddens us that it is even
necessary to explain our outrage.
The issue is clear: the public sale
of a human being is one of the
highest forms of human
degradation. If Stanford
University has any commitment
to fundamental standards of
human decency, it cannot
condone such activity. That the
woman, or her agent, received
money for the sale of her body is
irrelevant to the central issue:
human decency is prior to
capitalist market relationships.
Those who respond to this recent
outrage by saying that "boys will
be boys" are in effect condoning
the dehumanization of women.
This University has attempted
to show its commitment to ending
racism at Stanford; it must now
show the same commitment to
ending sexism. This open auction
of a woman is only a dramatic
example of the sexism that is
allowed to pervade the University.
The several other fraternities that
had strippers at their rush parties
also merit censure, as does the
University itself when it shirks its
responsibility for sexual equality
in all areas of academic and
community life.
Stanford University claims to
uphold a "Fundamental
Standard" of conduct. In the past,
the campus judicial system has
been geared toward punishing
those who violate property rights

by breaking windows and sitting
in at buildings. These processes
should now be used to punish
those who have violated the even
more fundamental right to human
dignity. We recommend that the
University suspend the Phi Delt
fraternity and use the campus
judicial process to punish the
specific individuals who were
involved.

Innuendo
Editor:
In his April 27 letter to the
editor, Jack Truher of the United
Stanford Employees makes the
following points:
1. The Daily article of April 25
concerning the NLRB election
agreement included a statement
by me.
2. The "article" asserts that the
June 6 date was agreed to by all
parties as the "earliest date
possible in order to insure
adequate time for campaigning."
3. The information described
in point 2 is not accurate.
Each of the above points is by
itself correct. What is incorrect is
the innuendo cleverly achieved by
Mr. Truher through the
juxtaposition of points 1 and 2,
that my statement in the article
included the factual errors which
Mr. Truher has identified. The
article, of course, does not
attribute the points in question to
me or to anyone, and, in fact, I
made no such statement to the
Daily reporter.
