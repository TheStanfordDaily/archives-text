# Private College Tuition Covered
## Reagan Proposes Tax Credit 
### Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES â€” Income tax
credits should be granted to
Californians whose children
attend private colleges, Gov.
Ronald Reagan said yesterday.
The Republican chief executive
said the concept, which was
applied last year to state income
taxes for private elementary and
high schools, "must ultimately be
extended to higher education."
"This is not a deduction, it is a

dollar for dollar tax credit that
will help ease the financial burden
of California families who are
taxed to support a public school
system and who also pay tuition
to send their children to private
institutions," Reagan said.
His remarks were prepared for
delivery before a meeting of the
Association of Independent
California Colleges and
Universities.
"I realize, and I know you do
too, that a state tax credit is not
the sole answer simply because
our share of the tax dollar is not
that significant," Reagan said.
"The real need is for federal
income tax credits and I support
that too," he added.
Reagan also restated his wish
for tuition to be imposed on the
19-campus California State
University and Colleges sytem,
just as it was imposed on the
nine-campus University of
California at his urging.
He said tuition is not "any
kind of barrier to higher
education," and "students who
benefit most from higher
education have some obligation to
help pay for it." The governor
added, "The entire load cannot be
left to the taxpayers."
Needy students could continue
to go to colleges and universities

through the use of scholarships
and long-term loans, Reagan said.
He added that "our goal is greater
opportunity for more students,
not less."
In keeping with the goal the
state's Scholarship and Loan
Commission's budget has climbed
from less than $5 million in 1967
to more than $38 million this
year, he said.
The governor also said polls
show students' chief concern is
their inability to learn directly
from professors, with graduate
assistants frequently conducting
classes.
