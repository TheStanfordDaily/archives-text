# ASSU Burglary
## 
### 
Burglars entered two ASSU
offices on the second floor of
Tresidder Union over the
weekend, stealing a small closet
safe valued at $150 from the
office of ASSU Elections
Commissioner Mike Nilsson.
According to Nilsson, the
burglars rummaged through his
office and the office of ASSU
Special Events Director Ron
Shannon sometime between 3
p.m. Friday and 12:45 yesterday
afternoon.
Only the safe, which contained
keys to ballot boxes, was reported
stolen. Nilsson noted that the
safe, also used to hold money to
pay those who man the ballot
boxes, contained none when it
was stolen.
