# Bicycle Touring Made Easy

### CRAIG HEAPS 
Bicycle Touring in Europe, Karen
and Gary Hawkins, Pantheon
Books, 1973, $2.95, jxiperback.
Bicycling is popular at
Stanford. That seems to be a safe
statement to make considering the
number of pedalled machines
cluttering the Quad. Any
pedestrian in White Plaza between
classes knows that Stanford has
more than its share of speeding
bicycles (and maniac riders to go
with them).
What is it about bicycles that
appeals to the phalanx of
two-wheeled marauders around
here? Maybe this: bicycles are in
harmony with the students'
outdoor spirit, their
environmental awareness, and,
above all, the poverty that results
from paying a prestigious tuition.

Europe is also popular with
Stanford students, judging by the
number of overseas campuses and
the plethora of continental
braggarts who permeate dorm
conversations with stories of their
European summers.
But the two groups—bicyclists
and European travelers—seem to
be almost mutually exclusive.
Those who can afford a summer
in Europe are usually not those
who must rely on bicycles to get
to the concerts at Winterland.
Relief
Now to the relief of those who
pedal in poverty, someone has
written a book telling how to
combine the reality of bicycling
with the dreams of European
adventure. Karen and Gary
Hawkins, she a nursery school
teacher and he a speech
communication instructor at S.F.

State, have written Bicycle
Touring in Europe (Pantheon
Books, 1973, $2.95, paperback).
The authors argue persuasively
that bicycling is one of the best
ways to see Europe. They say,
"Being a bicycle tourist is a
combination of independence and
dependence. On the one hand you
are free—free of the cities, the
crowds, time schedules, other
tourists, and all the expectations
that are built into a trip to the
most capitals of Europe.
"But you also have a strange
dependency. You are frequently
in places where English is not
spoken, and not only must you
rely upon your own ability in sign
language, facial expressions, or
emitting various sighs or groans,
but you are also dependent upon
the willingness of the average
European to help you. And, this

you will find, is your most
abundant harvest.
Certainly bicycles get you
closer to the scenery. Anyone
who rides his bike in the hills in
the Spring knows much better the
smell of the flowers and the
warmth of the sun than that lucky
dog in his Porsche who zips by as
you perspiringly climb a steep hill.
Closer To Reality
Bicycling brings you closer to
reality (like the insanity, disregard
for human life, and the death wish
of riding on El Camino at rush
hour). You experience the wind in
your hair, the bugs in your teeth,
and the cramps in your legs of the
virile adventurer (unless you're a
woman, in which case I apologize
if you are virile).
What bicycling provides is
inexpensive transportation, a
feeling of accomplishment in
having pedalled those miles you
might lazily have ridden, and a
view of Europe that few bus,
train, or plane travelers will be
allowed to enjoy.
Now that you're convinced,
the authors don't leave you to
blindly pack your sister's
three-speed and a knapsack
aboard a Pan Am 747 and head
for London. They provide
step-by-step instructions for the
bicycle tourist.
The two authors begin at
the beginning (always a good
place to start). They outline a
plan for physical preparation.
They say that coronary
thrombosis, getting lost in the
Black Forest, and starvation in
Greece are unlikely. Very likely
are extremely sore, agonizing

muscles if you're not prepared.
Once you're in shape, this
handy guide tells you where to
buy a bicycle, including the
relative merits of buying in the
U.S. or in Europe. They also tell
you what clothes to pack, what
cooking utensils you'll need, and
how to plan your menu.
This amazingly comprehensive
and well-organized book, based on
the authors' own touring
experiences, also itemizes the
tools you'll need, the camping
gear that's necessary, and how to
adjust your seat and handlebars
for comfortable riding.
In addition to all this, they
provide nine sample, ready-made
tours, and a set of appendices that
shows such things as where to
write for maps, metric conversion
charts, the average temperatures
and precipitation in European
cities.
This book has only two
problems, one serious, the other
minor. First, it at no time deals
with the problem of security for
person or possession while touring
in Europe. Perhaps the Europeans
have advanced so far beyond the
Americans socially that this is not
a problem. I think not. The
authors have disappointingly let
their readers down by not dealing
with this problem.
Second, this is so good that I'm
disappointed that it is not
hardbound in smaller dimensions
so that it could be carried more
easily while touring.
This excellent guide is
recommended for all those who
are seeking adventurous means of
travel while in Europe.
