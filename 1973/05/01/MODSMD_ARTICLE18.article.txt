# Bejart Ballet
## Innovative Dancing 
### RUST EDDIE 
Small wonder Nureyev asks his
friends if they have seen Bejart's
"Ballet of the Twentieth
Century." He has danced with
them. As Bejart says in his
program, "One can love the
particular body of a man or a
woman and try to make it move,
to illustrate it, and then look for
the music to fit the body."
Bejart's most adored bodies
now may be Jorge Donn and
Suzanne Farrell, for
axiomatically, they seem to have
inspired his outstanding recent
work—"Le Marteau Sans Maitre"
(1973, Boulez)—on Monday's
opening program at the San
Francisco Opera House.
Making its U.S. debut only two
years ago in New York, Bejart's
Ballet is in the Bay Area for its
second time. After a Berkeley
performance last year one critic
wrote, "If more dance were so
completely fulfilling, so
uninhibited, so creative and
energetic, dance companies could
fire their publicity staffs, cut their
advertising and hire extra police
to keep the mobs away."
Passionate Expression
Of the passion in his work,
Bejart says,"I don't think that
any author or poet has known
how to write a love scene as well
as it can be expressed in dance."
In her San Francisco press
conference Suzanne Farrell,
Bejart's "prima ballerina" echoed
her director. "When I am in
rehearsal I give myself completely
to Bejart. He can do with me
anything he wishes. It's a very
exciting way to work."
This professional symbiosis
between Farrell and Bejart began
when another earlier one with
Balanchine and New York City
Ballet ended. It is said Farrell's
symbiosis with Balanchine ended
when it ceased to be professional.
Unlike Balanchine, the other
major force in twentieth century
1

dance, Bejart's art is passionate
and proletarian. Stripping his
dancers of classic artifice
costumes, sets, orchestra-he leans
strongly on young bodies, usually
male.
In Bejart's second work
Monday night, "Le Chant du
Compagnon Errant" (Mahler),
Jorge Donn and Daniel Lommel
excelled in Bejart's celebrated pas
de deux for two men, originally
choreographed for Paulo
Bortoluzzi and Rudolf Nureyev.
Bortoluzzi recently joined
American Ballet Theater and
Nureyev is currently guest artist
with the National Ballet of
Canada.
The other representational

ballet Monday was "The Firebird"
(Stravinsky). Re-staging his first
"Firebird" after twenty years,
Bejart ignored Fokine's
complacent resurrection of the
Phoenix, favoring a partisan
struggle. This revolutionary
version of "The Firebird"
provides a topical alternative to
the balletic version which
Stravinsky openly disavowed.
"Cantata No. 51" (Bach),
which opened the evening, is an
abstract ballet along with "Le
Marteau Sans Maitre." Had it not
been for the company's strength,
the dance could have staggered to
the baroque score. Recklessly
gambling against such odds,
however, Bejart wins.
