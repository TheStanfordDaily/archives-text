# Stewart Performs At Boarding House
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
Last Friday night, the Boarling House featured
singer-guitarist-songwriter John Stewart, who looks like a somewhat
younger Johnny Cash and plays a sort of under-30 urban country rock
style of music.
Stewart plays acoustic guitar and is backed by a nicknamed band
consisting of lan "Mad Dog" Hoffman, drums, Arnie "Wide Load"
Moore, bass, and "Dangerous" Dan Morton, pedal steel and electric
guitar. Among the more notable numbers were "July, You're A
Woman," "Cannons in the Rain" from the album of the same name,
and "Mother Country," a long, moving song half spoken and half
sung. This last song, like several of his other works, presents a glimpse
of rural America that has been compared to an Andrew Wyeth
painting.
There was also music in a lighter vein. He closed his first set with
"Johnny B. Goode," and later on did a song called "Oldies But
Goodies," which he dedicated to "all those who grew up in the
fiftiesâ€”and stayed there." "Dangerous Dan's" lead guitar left much to
be desired, although he plays competent pedal steel. Stewart also
played Elvis Presley's "Love Me Tender," which started as a
half-serious initiation and ended as a complete joke, and "Wake Up
the Child (There's Wolves in the Kitchen)" which he dedicated to
John Mitchell.
Stewart was preceded in both sets by Estrella, a singer and guitarist
from Marin. She opened with "San Francisco Bay Blues," then did
several of her own tunes, receiving more than polite response from the
less than capacity audience. Her second set included more of the
same, with some blues, some quiet poetic songs, one short obscene
ditty, and all accompanied by her fairly inventive guitar work.
