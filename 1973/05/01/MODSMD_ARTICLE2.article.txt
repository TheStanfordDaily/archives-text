# China Veneration Outrages Buckley
## 
### JAMES LOBSENZ 
William F. Buckley, Jr., the editor
of the National Review, addressed a
capacity crowd at Memorial Church
last night, decrying those leading
American intellectuals who, after
visiting China, have said that they have
"seen the future and it works." Such
commentators, according to Buckley,
have revealed in their attitude toward
China an antagonism to political
liberty and the free market.
Buckley prefaced his remarks with
a few quips about the recent events in
the Watergate affair. He claimed that
"There were many of us who were
surprised that he I Nixon] did not
redirect his priorities towards prison
reform."
Buckley said he found himself
appalled by the "tendentious
enthusiasm for the People's Republic
of China" expressed by such writers as
Barbara Tuchman, James Reston, John
Kenneth Galbraith and Jean Revel
(author of "Without Marx or Jesus").
Buckley attacked Revel's
contention that American society
causes a "selection of mutual
aggressiveness" among men because it
is based on "the profit maximization
motive."
When James Reston of the New
York Times visited the Chinese
mainland two years ago, Buckley
stated that he was "struck by Reston's
tremendous efforts to bring out the
best in man in China."
"His description of China in terms
so serene," was, according to Buckley,
"indiscreet."
Buckley read from John Kenneth
Galbraith's book on China with
obvious disdain, concluding that
Galbraith had characterized "those
who want to read books as dissidents
who are firmly brought into line,"
although the discipline of these
dissidents is carried out, "one suspects,
with politeness."

"An authoritarian society can
indeed work marvels," conceded
Buckley, but only at the price of
sacrificing individual freedoms which
he wryly observed is peculiarly
"coincidental" with the corporate
free-enterprise system.
Buckley says that he is revolted by
a society that directs "its poets as to
what they should write and its
scientists as to what they should
study. It is wrong and it will forever be
wrong," asserted Buckley.
Nixon journeyed to China and
returned claiming that "their
revolution is like to the American
industrial revolution," Buckley
paraphrased. "And the President
praised the enthusiasm of the Chinese
for their government. No doubt Mr.
Nixon was professionally fascinated by
it," Buckely quipped.
Prof. Seymour Martin Lipset, of
Harvard, asked Buckley why it was
that socialism has persistently
maintained its appeal, and pointed out
that, as far back as Alexis de
Tocqueville, political commentators
have viewed "the idea of equality as
politically unbeatable."
Buckley declined to answer
directly, and also refused to speculate
on the possible retention of freedom
as a cherished value in American
society. "My point," claimed Buckley,
"is merely that people like James
Reston, Barbara Tuchman, John
Kenneth Galbraith, and Jean Revel
have relegated freedom to the
historical dustbin."
Buckley's speech was the third in a
series of four lectures sponsored by
the Stanford Conservative Forum.
Following the speech, he was
questioned by four panelists.
In addition to Lipset, the panel
included New York University Prof.
Sidney Hook, currently a research
fellow at the Hoover Institute, and
Eugene Genovese, a history professor
at Rochester University.

a society that directs "its poets as to
what they should write and its
scientists as to what they should
study. It is wrong and it will forever be
wrong," asserted Buckley.
Nixon journeyed to China and
returned claiming that "their
revolution is like to the American
industrial revolution," Buckley
paraphrased. "And the President
praised the enthusiasm of the Chinese
for their government. No doubt Mr.
Nixon was professionally fascinated by
it," Buckely quipped.
Prof. Seymour Martin Lipset, of
Harvard, asked Buckley why it was
that socialism has persistently
maintained its appeal, and pointed out
that, as far back as Alexis de
Tocqueville, political commentators
have viewed "the idea of equality as
politically unbeatable."
Buckley declined to answer
directly, and also refused to speculate
on the possible retention of freedom
as a cherished value in American
society. "My point," claimed Buckley,
"is merely that people like James
Reston, Barbara Tuchman, John
Kenneth Galbraith, and Jean Revel
have relegated freedom to the
historical dustbin."
Buckley's speech was the third in a
series of four lectures sponsored by
the Stanford Conservative Forum.
Following the speech, he was
questioned by four panelists.
In addition to Lipset, the panel
included New York University Prof.
Sidney Hook, currently a research
fellow at the Hoover Institute, and
Eugene Genovese, a history professor
at Rochester University.

WILLIAM F. BUCKLEY
William F. Buckley, Jr., the editor
of the National Review, addressed a
capacity crowd at Memorial Church
last night, decrying those leading
American intellectuals who, after
visiting China, have said that they have
"seen the future and it works." Such
commentators, according to Buckley,
have revealed in their attitude toward
China an antagonism to political
liberty and the free market.
Buckley prefaced his remarks with
a few quips about the recent events in
the Watergate affair. He claimed that
"There were many of us who were
surprised that he I Nixon] did not
redirect his priorities towards prison
reform."
Buckley said he found himself
appalled by the "tendentious
enthusiasm for the People's Republic
of China" expressed by such writers as
Barbara Tuchman, James Reston, John
Kenneth Galbraith and Jean Revel
(author of "Without Marx or Jesus").
Buckley attacked Revel's
contention that American society
causes a "selection of mutual
aggressiveness" among men because it
is based on "the profit maximization
motive."
When James Reston of the New
York Times visited the Chinese
mainland two years ago, Buckley
stated that he was "struck by Reston's
tremendous efforts to bring out the
best in man in China."
"His description of China in terms
so serene," was, according to Buckley,
"indiscreet."
Buckley read from John Kenneth
Galbraith's book on China with
obvious disdain, concluding that
Galbraith had characterized "those
who want to read books as dissidents
who are firmly brought into line,"
although the discipline of these
dissidents is carried out, "one suspects,
with politeness."

"An authoritarian society can
indeed work marvels," conceded
Buckley, but only at the price of
sacrificing individual freedoms which
he wryly observed is peculiarly
"coincidental" with the corporate
free-enterprise system.
Buckley says that he is revolted by
a society that directs "its poets as to
what they should write and its
scientists as to what they should
study. It is wrong and it will forever be
wrong," asserted Buckley.
