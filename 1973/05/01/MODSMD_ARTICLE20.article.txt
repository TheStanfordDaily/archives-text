Rogers Defends Cambodia Bombing
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State William P. Rogers
said yesterday a halt in U.S. bombing in Cambodia
without withdrawal of North Vietnamese forces "would
undermine the central achievement" of the Jan. 27
Vietnam peace agreement.
The President's powers under the Constitution as
commander-in-chief "are adequate to prevent such a
self-defeating result," Rogers told the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee.
Rogers said the President's authority to enforce
compliance with the peace agreement is the same that
permitted him to negotiate and execute the agreement.
He said that Article 20 of the agreement, requiring
withdrawal of foreign forces from Cambodia and Laos,
"recognizes the underlying connections among the
hostilities in all the countries of Indochina."
But committee members were not convinced.
"I think it's illegal," said Sen. Stuart Symington
(D-Mo.).
"I believe that what we are doing there is without
justification in the Constitution and in Law," said Sen.
Edmund S. Muskie (D-Maine).
Economic Control Power Extended
WASHINGTON — President Nixon last night signed a bill
granting him a one-year extension of authority to control
wages and prices.
The White House said Nixon signed the measure at 8
p.m. PDT, two hours before his economic-control
authority would have expired. He approved the bill
shortly after delivering a nationally broadcast address on
the Watergate case.
The House approved the bill and sent it to the
President after waiting all yesterday afternoon for the
Senate to act. House passage came on a 267-115 roll-call
vote; the Senate action was by voice vote.
The way was cleared for Senate action when Sen. Gale
McGee (D-Wyo.), yielded after threatening to talk until
midnight unless he got a vote on his
postcard-voter-registration measure.
The Senate fell two votes short yesterday of closing off
a filibuster on the voter registration bill. The vote was 56
to 31, short of the two-thirds vote needed to stop debate.
Kissinger To Visit Moscow
WASHINGTON — The White House said yesterday
President Nixon's top national security adviser, Henry A.
Kissinger, will go to Moscow Friday for an exchange of
views with Soviet leaders.
He will also make preparations for Soviet party leader
Leonid Brezhnev's forthcoming U.S. visit.
Kissinger is scheduled to leave Washington Thursday,
arrive in Moscow Friday, and spend about four or five
days in the Soviet capital.
Deputy press secretary Gerald L. Warren said Kissinger

will not be going from Moscow to Paris for Indochina
talks, but is expected to return to Washington after his
Soviet meetings.
Nixon Aides 9 Testimony Sought
LOS ANGELES — Daniel Ellsberg's chief attorney asked
Monday that 11 former White House staff members be
ordered here to tell what they know about links between
Watergate conspirators and a burglary of Ellsberg's
psychiatrist's office.
Attorney Leonard Boudin said he wants to find out
whether the Pentagon Papers indictment was part of a
"political espionage" plot.
The witnesses Boudin wants to call include former
Atty. Gen. John Mitchell, just-resigned Atty. Gen.
Richard Kleindienst, resigned White House aide John
Ehrlichman, former acting FBI Director L. Patrick Gray
and Watergate conspirators E. Howard Hunt and G.
Gordon Liddy.
Defense attorney Leonard Weinglass also asked that
Ehrlichman be questioned about his intentions when he
contacted Byrne about possible appointment as FBI
director last month.
"The mere fact of the contact," said Weinglass, "raises
some questions in our minds of what was in Mr.
Ehrlichman's mind when he contacted the court."
Both attorneys complained bitterly about the
government prosecutor's report to the court that no
further information regarding the burglary was turned up
over the weekend. The government had been ordered to
make a far-reaching inquiry Friday to find out more
details. But when court reconvened Monday, Asst. U.S.
Atty. David Nissen told the judge: "We have no
investigation information." The judge snapped, "That, Mr.
Nissen, is not going to be sufficient."
Cambodian Troops Advance
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Cambodian government
soldiers attacking in the wake of U.S. 852 raids drove
back Communist forces and broadened the defense
perimeter around the besieged provincial capital of Takeo,
military sources reported Monday.
Informants here said the government troops struck
Sunday in three directions and have expanded
government-controlled territory by 2000 yards on the
western flank and 1500 yards on the northern and southern
edges of the encircled city. Their counterattack followed
heavy pounding of suspected Communist troop
concentrations by American bombers.
The antigovernment forces control about two-thirds of
the country and have cut off most of the country's
highways. The Lon Nol regime claims they are Vietnamese
Communists and imposes censorship on outgoing news
dispatches to prevent newsmen from calling them
Cambodians.
However, field commanders and foreign diplomats
indicate most of the fighting is being done by Cambodian

Communists, with the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong
providing logistical and leadership support.
Tax Reform Plan Unveiled
WASHINGTON — A tax reform package striking at large
sheltered incomes and offering to ease the burden of
filling out returns was sent by President Nixon's
administration yesterday to a Congress apparently intent
on broader changes.
After Treasury Secretary George P. Shultz outlined the
proposals to the House Ways and Means Committee,
Chairman Wilbur D. Mills (D-Ark.), commented, "We'll
have to develop our own program ... there are a number
of areas he didn't touch on."
Instead of the present minimum tax on certain kinds of
preference income, which critics say has proved
ineffective, the new proposal would establish a minimum
taxable income, calculated so that no one could escape
paying regular taxes on about half, at least, of his income.
The proposed new return form, the Treasury said,
would ease the annual April chore for about 20 million
taxpayers who have too extensive deductions to use the
present short form but are overburdened by the detailed
requirements of the full return.
Morton Urges Alaska Pipeline
SAN FRANCISCO — An oil pipeline across Canada would
create more environmental risks than the proposed
trans-Alaska route, Interior Secretary Rogers C.B. Morton
said yesterday.
"A Canada route would cause more unavoidable
environmental damage by crossing three or more times as

much terrain and would involve serious risks from a much
larger number of river crossings, which endanger pipelines
during flood stage," Morton wrote in a letter to the
editors of the San Francisco Chronicle.
Morton said 26,000 U.S. construction jobs a
trans-Alaska route would create "would be lost" to
Canadians if the pipeline crosses that country. In addition,
he added, the U.S. balance of payments problem would
get worse with cash flowing to Canada for the project.
Libya Bars Foreign Travelers
TRIPOLI, Libya — Libya closed its doors to all foreign
travelers except those with Arabic-language passports
Monday in an apparent extension of Col. Moammar
Khadafy's Arab nationalist "cultural revolution."
In another Middle East development, Palestinian
guerrillas tried to attack the U.S. Embassy in Lebanon but
were stopped before they got there with a suitcase full of
explosives, police said.
The new Libyan policy, in effect, halts travel into the
oil-rich northern African country except by Arabs. It is a
tightening of rules laid down by Khadafy's regime in
January but heretofore applied only to tourists and some
newsmen.

ocean tomorrow. Warmer today. Low temperatures both
