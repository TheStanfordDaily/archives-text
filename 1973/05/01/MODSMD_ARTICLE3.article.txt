# 'Papers' Judge Asked To Become FBI Chief
## 
### Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES - The White House
disclosed yesterday that the Pentagon
Papers trial judge, Matt Byrne, had
been approached last month about
becoming FBI director. Byrne said
later that he wouldn't consider it until
the trial ends.
Meanwhile, top FBI officials urged
President Nixon in a letter to consider
appointing a new director from the
ranks, according to Charles W. Bates,
special agent in charge of the Bureau's
San Francisco office.
Judge Byme said he had gone to
the Western White House at San
Clemente a month ago at the
invitation of then-presidential aide
John D. Ehrlichman and talked with
him there about "a possible future
assignment in government," as well as
meeting the President briefly. The
White House said the post was that of
FBI director.
The judge said, "I told Mr.
Ehrlichman that I could not and
would not give consideration to any
position until this case (Pentagon
Papers] was concluded." The
four-month-old case is expected to last
another month.

Byrne, 42, a Democrat and former
U.S. district attorney, has often been
mentioned as a possible candidate for
FBI director.
Nixon named William D.
Ruckelshaus as acting FBI chief last
week, to replace acting director L.
Patrick Gray 111. Gray resigned in the
wake of the Watergate investigation.
The FBI letter said the
recommendation had been
unanimously adopted by the acting
associate director, all assistant
directors and all special agents in
charge of FBI offices.
"J. Edgar Hoover's principles of
careful selection of agent personnel
among highly qualified candidates,
rigorous training, firm discipline and
promotion solely on merits have
developed within the FBI, law
enforcement leaders of professional
stature, respected world-wide," the
letter said.
"In the search for a nominee for
the FBI directorship, we urge
consideration of the highly qualified
professionals with impeccable
credentials of integrity within the
organization itself."
