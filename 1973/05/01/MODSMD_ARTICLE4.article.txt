# German Language Requirement Dropped
## 
### LARRY FLEECE 
Assistant Director of Overseas
Campuses S. Corbin Smith has
announced that the two-quarter
language requirement will be dropped
for applicants to the upcoming
summer-fall term at the German
campus in Beutelsbach.
Smith said the decision to drop the
language requirement for this
particular Germany group is part of "a
fairly intensive recruiting drive" aimed
at raising enrollment.
Presently, only 20 students are
enrolled for the summer-fall term in
Beutelsbach. The German campus has
a capacity of 94.
Smith emphasized that the
decision, announced last week, applies
only to the upcoming Germany group,
and does not alter the existing

attendance requirements for the five
overseas campuses. "Basically, it's an
experiment," Smith said.
According to Smith the decision
was made only after careful
consultation with Prof. Kurt Steiner,
chairman of the Germany
subcommittee, and with German
Studies Prof. Walter Lohnes, presently
teaching in Beutelsbach.
New Language Program
As a result of the decision, Lohnes
has begun designing an intensive
German studies program geared to aid
students arriving in Beutelsbach in the
summer with little or no knowledge of
the German language.
"The success of this intensive
language study will be particularly
important at Beutelsbach," Smith said,
"because of the family program in

operation there." He said that in all
probability Lohnes' language program
would initially concentrate on
conversation.
"Speaking optimistically, we hope
that students going to Germany with
little language knowledge will develop
an enthusiasm for learning German,"
Smith said. "Ic'eally, those students
may place a greater emphasis on their
home campus and on Germany, out of
both interest and need."
Training No Guarantee
Smith also pointed out that in the
past, students have gone overseas with
some language training but with no
guarantee that those students will
cultivate their knowledge of that
particular language and culture.
Although enrollment is low for the
upcoming Germany group, Smith said

this is no indication that the overseas
program in general is in serious
trouble. He said that present
enrollment at all five campuses is close
to capacity. At the Austria campus the
enrollment exceeds the capacity by
three students, so that extra
accommodations have had to be made.
Moreover, Smith said, the
enrollment for the German
summer-fall group has traditionally
been low. Last summer, 37 students
enrolled at Beutelsbach. About 110
students have already signed up for the
German campus next winter-spring
(1974).
Low Summer Enrollment
Smith confessed that the Overseas
Campus office cannot accurately
predict or explain these fluctuations in
