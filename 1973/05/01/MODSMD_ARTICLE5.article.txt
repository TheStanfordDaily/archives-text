# Police Director Shuns 'Father Figure' Role
## 
### CHRIS KENRICK 
"I don't see it as the role of university police, as
people commonly have in the past, to be some kind
of a father figure for students," Stanford's Director
of Police Services Marvin Herrington said.
"As long as people in the community aren't
violating any laws, I don't concern myself with their
personal conduct," he added.
"Five or ten years ago university police had a lot
more rule-oriented rather than law-oriented
functions," he said, referring to such practices as
dormitory patrol and student sign-outs.
He criticized the in loco parentis concept of
university public safety, which assumes that the
university should act as surrogate parents for the
students. "I'm always kind of amazed that it's taken
so long for students to be considered adults," he
remarked.
Conflicting Pressures
The police director said that he still gets
complaints from parents urging stricter supervision
of students' personal conduct. "There are still a lot
of conflicting pressures for this sort of thing on the
University," he noted.
"The way we operate here is changed all the
time," Herrington said. "We can't sit back and build
some theoretical model of the way things should be,
use that, and then say 'I'm done.'

"I like the challenge of my job — the demand to
be constantly reevaluating everything. That
challenge, more than anything else, is what has kept
me in the field of police work for so long,"
Herrington said.
Herrington views his role as primarily a policy
making and administrative one, although he is
frequently involved in routine department affairs.
Atmosphere Of Change
Herrington discussed the atmosphere of change
in his department as reflected in the evolution of
police handling of student demonstrations and drug
cases.
"Over the years I've developed a detached
attitude toward political demonstrations," he
explained.
"I've heard 'em all; from all political persuasions,
everybody's got a cause," he said. "As far as my job
is concerned, I don't care what they say as long as
they're not violating any laws."
Less Emotional Involvement
Herrington feels that he has become "less
emotionally involved with these situations," and
views this as a typical pattern for police officers.
"When confronted with demonstrations for the
first time it's a new situation, you're human, and
you naturally react," he said. "But soon you learn
that becoming emotionally involved detracts from

your effectiveness.
"I've learned to take them not as personal
attacks anymore, but rather as attacks on authority
or the establishment.
"Fifteen years ago it was fairly uncommon for an
officer to be attacked verbally," he added. "But in
the '60's — let's face it — there was a lot of
frustration among the public and we're the most
visible representatives of authority."
'We Follow The Law'
Despite a lack of statistical evidence to
substantiate it, Hernngton has "an intuitive feeling"
that drug use on university campuses has declined in
recent years.
He discussed the changes that have come about
in police handling of drug cases from a "state of
total ignorance" a decade ago to the present, and
summarized University police drug policy in a
simple statement: "We follow the law."
"If we catch anybody holding in public we're
going to have to arrest them, and any reports of
dealers — even of marijuana — will be followed up,"
he said.
"On the other hand," he added, "we know that a
lot of people smoke in the residence halls, but
because of search and seizure laws we haven't the
time or the energy to go after them."

NOT FATHER FIGURES — Stanford's Director of Police Services Marvin
Herrington sees the role of University police as less oriented toward school rules
and more toward law enforcement than it once was. Though some people have
urged stricter supervision of students, he feels that police should not act as
surrogate parents.
