## Rights, Real And Phony 
### 
s Chris Hocker

The concept of man's rights
has taken a giant step since the
days of John Locke's notion of
the right to "life, liberty, and
property."
Unfortunately, the step has
been backwards.
We are now told that man has
an entire cavalcade of "rights."
The right to a job, for instance. Or
the right to decent housing. Or to
an education, or to free child care,
or to a fair wage. Few would
dispute that these rights now
exist.
Housing
I am one of those few,
however. There are a number of
reasons for this, the most obvious
being the problem of defining
what certain terms mean. What,
for example, is "decent" housing?
A piano box? A castle?
The search for an operating
definition of "decent" housing
has, in fact, resulted in the
objectively indecent situation of
urban renewal. These programs
have forced people out of housing
which someone else has defined as
inadequate, torn the offending
buildings down, and replaced
them with monstrosities which
soon became as bad as the old
ones. In the extreme case, the
new, "decent" housing has been
dynamited within a few years—by
federal authorities.
Such attempts to implement
the redefinition of human rights
usually fail, but this demonstrated
failure has not yet prevented, the
master planners from continuing
their programs. Clearly, then, the
problem of defining human rights
must be argued from a starting
point different from what will or
will not work.
Resistance
To go back to Locke, there are
three basic rights to which most
of us pay lipservice: life, liberty,
and property. These rights must
be absolute: there is no such thing
as a conditional right. If every

individual has an absolute right to
his life, liberty, and property,
then any attempt to infringe these
rights may (rightfully) be resisted.
In order to accept these as
rights, one must reject the
so-called rights to housing,
education, etc., mentioned above.
The two sets of rights are totally
contradictory and incompatible.
One cannot claim to defend an
individual's right to property
while advocating at the same time
that part of it be confiscated in
order to build "decent" housing
for someone else.
Infringing the right to property
is a direct attack on the right to
liberty, for if an individual is
totally free, he is free to dispose
of his property as he chooses, not
as someone else dictates.
Life
And an attack on the right to
liberty is a violation of the right
to life, as well, for an individual's
life is his own, to be sustained
through property acquired on the
basis of free exchange.
Thus, if one wishes to invent
and dispense rights like so many
soft drinks, one should be totally
honest and deny that the rights to
life, liberty, and property exist.
One should scrap the notion of
human rights and substitute the
idea of social obligations. Then,
instead of the right to life, liberty,
and property, we would have the
obligation to live for others, die
for others, produce for others.
And, of course, these social
obligations would be enforceable
by agencies of the government,
just as the remains of the rights to
life, liberty, and property are
enforceable now. If these
obligations were not enforceable,
then they would have to be
voluntary, and voluntary choice
implies the existence of rights, not
obligations.
Choice
Clearly, the sort of society

suggested by all this appeals to a
large number of people, for one
reason or another. And, of course,
one has the right—sorry, the
obligation—to express one's own
opinions.
But if there exists this sharp
distinction between rights and
obligations, let's not muddy the
intellectual waters by referring to
one as the other. Let's get the
differences out in the open, where
people can choose which theory
they prefer.
Let's do it quickly, while
people are still able to choose
anything at all.
