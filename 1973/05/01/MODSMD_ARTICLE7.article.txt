# Insensitivity And Inconsistency
## On Asian-American Admissions 
### 
Asian Students 9 Admissions Subcommittee

Why does Stanford University include Asian-Americans as an
ethnic minority when citing progress in its Affirmative Action
(minority hiring) programs, when it does not consider them as a
minority in its undergraduate admissions policies?
Why are Asian-Americans considered a minority by the Graduate
School of Business and not by the Medical or Law Schools?
The inconsistencies exist, because in the past, Stanford's ethnic
minority policies have been reactions designed to placate demands,
rather than to address problems. It is clear that the Stanford
administration does not understand the special needs of the Asian
=American community.
Success
Many Americans, and particularly people in the Academic circles,
feel that Asian-Americans have "made it;" they feel that we are a
minority group that has overcome the obstacles of racism and
discrimination to become successful middle class Americans. Articles
in such publications as the New York Times, Newsweek, and the U.S.
News & World Report have promulgated this myth.
For example, one article in the December 26, 1966 issue of the
U.S. News & World Report states: "Visit 'Chinatown U.S.A.' and you
find an important racial minority pulling itself up from hardship and
discrimination to become a model of self-respect and achievement in
today's America." Obviously, the author had his eyes closed during
his visit.
The Chinatowns of the U.S. are, by any definition of the word,
ghettoes. For example, San Francisco's Chinatown houses over 30,000
people in a 20-square block area, a population density second only to
Harlem. In 1960, over 40 percent of the families incomes under
$4000 per year. In a 1956 Community Renewal Program Report
prepared by Arthur D. Little Co., 77 percent of the housing was listed
as substandard. Employment, health, and education are other serious
problems. The social problems of poverty are intensified by the
problems of racial discrimination and alienation. Unfortunately, most
Americans are unaware of the severe cultural and economic problems
of the disadvantaged Asian-Americans, because Asian-Americans have
been a "silent minority."
Admissions
One important area, where we feel Stanford should change its
policies towards Asian-Americans is that of admissions policy.
Stanford has made special commitments to other ethnic minority
groups to reduce some of the psychological and cultural barriers that
potential Stanford applicants face. We feel the same is needed for
disadvantaged Asian Americans.
Schools such as Yale, M.1.T., Columbia, and Berkeley have
included Asian-Americans within such programs. There are many
qualified Asian-American students in ghettos who do not apply to
Stanford because they believe that Stanford is a school for rich, white
Americans. Afraid of the plunge into a relatively affluent, white
environment, and unaware of Stanford's financial aid opportunities,
they don't even consider applying.
We feel that the Admissions Office should publish a brochure
similar to those for Blacks and Chicanos, which would address the
questions and concerns of disadvantaged Asian-Americans. In
addition, it should hire Asian-Americans as representatives of the
University to recruit in high schools, community colleges and other
universities and colleges where there are large concentrations of
disadvantaged Asian-Americans. An ideal arrangement would be to
hire students from similar backgrounds (but there are only a handful
at present) to recruit on a work-study basis, since they would best
appreciate the concerns of prospective applicants and they could
discuss their experiences at Stanford.
Consideration
Within the context of present policies regarding admissions,
financial aid, and counseling, we feel that whatever consideration is
given other minorities should also be extended to disadvantaged
Asian-Americans. For example, the admissions procedures should

place less emphasis on standardized test scores, since disadvantaged
Asian-Americans often come from communities where high school
preparation is inferior and Ehglish is the second language. Such
scores tend to underrate a student's actual potential.
In general, we feel that in all policies and programs involving racial
minorities, Asian-Americans should be given like consideration with
Chicanos, Blacks, and Native Americans we hope that the
Administration will be more sensitive and responsive to the needs of
Asian-Americans in the future.
