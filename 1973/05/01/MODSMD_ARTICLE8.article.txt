# Single Persons Suffer
## A 						Tax Reform Setback 
### 
Paul iV. McCloskey

The cause for tax reform in this Congress
suffered a grevious setback with the recent decision
by Ways and Means Committee Chairman Wilbur
Mills to defer further hearings on tax reform.
Particularly dismaying is the delay of action on
equalizing income tax rates for single people, a
measure which is admittedly long overdue. In a
straw vote in January, the Committee members
voted for such reform by a substantial margin. I can
think of no tax regulation more in need of reform
than that which discriminates against the nation's
30 million single people who are paying up to 20
percent more income tax than a married person
earning the same income.
This discrimination has a strange history. It stems
from the Revenue Act of 1948 which attempted to
cure an inequity in the tax treatment of married
couples in community property and noncommunity
property states. Prior to 1948, married couples in
California and seven other community property
states were permitted to file separate returns in
which each spouse rpported and paid taxes on
one-half of their total income, a practice krown as
income splitting. In noncommunity property states,
however, a married couple could only declare the
actual income earned by each spouse on separate
returns. Because of the graduated rates applied to
federal income tax, married couples in the
community property stated paid significantly lower
taxes.
Adverse
In order to restore fairness, Congress made the
income splitting procedure a national procedure in
1948. However, Congress neglected to take into
account the resulting adverse effect on single people
who were paying up to 40 percent higher taxes than
married couples at the same income level. In 1969,
Congress reduced the difference in tax rates to a
maximum of 20 percent, but the basic inequity still
remains, and little reason can be found to justifv the

discrimination involved.
A majority of Members of Congress agree, and
over 130 Members have joined in sponsoring a bill
(H.R. 716) to equalize rates for single persons.
The problem lies with the procedure required.
Under the Constitution, revenue measures must
commence in the House of Representatives. Under
House rules, only the Ways and Means Committee
can report out a tax reform bill. Under present
custom, this means that Chairman Mills must lead
the way. In practice it helps if the Administration
furnished leadership as well.
Administration
To date, Chairman Mills has properly felt that
this reform is merely one of a number of possible
reforms to be considered in a comprehensive
overhaul of the total structure. Mills had also
properly expected an Administration position on
overall reform.
Instead, however, the Administration has
apparently abandoned its promised push for reform,
and has shifted its emphasis to a request for broad
new foreign trade powers for the President. Since
foreign trade legislation also falls within the
jurisdiction of the Ways and Means Committee, the
Mills decision to defer any further tax reform
hearings until foreign trade questions are resolved
results in an indefinite postponement of that which
a majority of the Congress probably supports.
What is needed is a massive citizens effort such as
the League of Women Voters and Common Cause
have occasionally mounted in the past on issues
such as water pollution and election reform. It is for
this reason that I recently gave my endorsement to
the National Tax Action Campaign being pushed by
ex-Senator Fred Harris. It will take, I'm afraid, a
very vigorous expression of public opinion if
Congress is to be stimulated to act before the 1974
elections.

This discrimination has a strange history. It stems
from the Revenue Act of 1948 which attempted to
cure an inequity in the tax treatment of married
couples in community property and noncommunity
property states. Prior to 1948, married couples in
California and seven other community property
states were permitted to file separate returns in
which each spouse rpported and paid taxes on
one-half of their total income, a practice krown as
income splitting. In noncommunity property states,
however, a married couple could only declare the
actual income earned by each spouse on separate
returns. Because of the graduated rates applied to
federal income tax, married couples in the
community property stated paid significantly lower
taxes.
Adverse
In order to restore fairness, Congress made the
income splitting procedure a national procedure in
1948. However, Congress neglected to take into
account the resulting adverse effect on single people
who were paying up to 40 percent higher taxes than
married couples at the same income level. In 1969,
Congress reduced the difference in tax rates to a
maximum of 20 percent, but the basic inequity still
remains, and little reason can be found to justifv the

discrimination involved.
A majority of Members of Congress agree, and
over 130 Members have joined in sponsoring a bill
(H.R. 716) to equalize rates for single persons.
The problem lies with the procedure required.
Under the Constitution, revenue measures must
commence in the House of Representatives. Under
House rules, only the Ways and Means Committee
can report out a tax reform bill. Under present
custom, this means that Chairman Mills must lead
the way. In practice it helps if the Administration
furnished leadership as well.
Administration
To date, Chairman Mills has properly felt that
this reform is merely one of a number of possible
reforms to be considered in a comprehensive
overhaul of the total structure. Mills had also
properly expected an Administration position on
overall reform.
Instead, however, the Administration has
apparently abandoned its promised push for reform,
and has shifted its emphasis to a request for broad
new foreign trade powers for the President. Since
foreign trade legislation also falls within the
jurisdiction of the Ways and Means Committee, the
Mills decision to defer any further tax reform
hearings until foreign trade questions are resolved
results in an indefinite postponement of that which
a majority of the Congress probably supports.
What is needed is a massive citizens effort such as
the League of Women Voters and Common Cause
have occasionally mounted in the past on issues
such as water pollution and election reform. It is for
this reason that I recently gave my endorsement to
the National Tax Action Campaign being pushed by
ex-Senator Fred Harris. It will take, I'm afraid, a
very vigorous expression of public opinion if
Congress is to be stimulated to act before the 1974
elections.

The cause for tax reform in this Congress
suffered a grevious setback with the recent decision
by Ways and Means Committee Chairman Wilbur
Mills to defer further hearings on tax reform.
Particularly dismaying is the delay of action on
equalizing income tax rates for single people, a
measure which is admittedly long overdue. In a
straw vote in January, the Committee members
voted for such reform by a substantial margin. I can
think of no tax regulation more in need of reform
than that which discriminates against the nation's
30 million single people who are paying up to 20
percent more income tax than a married person
earning the same income.
