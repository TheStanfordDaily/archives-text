# Nixon's Aides Seek To Prove Innocence
## 
### Associated Press 
WASHINGTON — Before they quite as
President Nixon's top aides, H.R.
Haldeman and John D. Ehrlichman
culled through government files
seeking to document their claim of
innocence in the Watergate scandal,
sources said yesterday.
The disclosure came as FBI agents
were posted in White House offices
containing Watergate-related files in
what press secretary Ronald Ziegler
said was a "round-the-clock"
safe-guarding procedure.
And it came amid a flurry of other
developments in the day after Nixon's
speech to the nation on the case:
—Nixon stepped up efforts to get
his Watergate-rocked administration
back on course, calling a
mid-afternoon meeting of his full
Cabinet, Ziegler said, "to talk about
important things that lie ahead."
Major Changes
—Sources predicted that the
Haldeman and Ehrlichman resignations
will bring major changes in the White
House staff structure. One source said
Nixon would announce the shuffle
next week. Ziegler said the President
had made no decisions on
replacements for the two aides, but
administration officials said they
expected Treasury Secretary George
Shultz to receive expanded White
House duties.
—The Senate voted to call on Nixon
to appoint a special prosecutor from
outside the government to oversee the
Watergate investigation. The President
in his speech Monday night said
appointment of a special supervising
prosecutor was up to Acting Atty.
Gen. Elliot L. Richardson.
—Sen. Carl T. Curtis and others
suggested Nixon call on former Sen.
John J. Williams, R—Del., to oversee
the probe. Sen. Barry Goldwater,
R—Ariz., cautioned that Richardson
had close ties to prominent Watergate
figures, just as did resigned Atty. Gen.

Richard G. Kleindienst.
—The federal grand jury on
Watergate heard from "a very
important witness," according to
assistant prosecutor Seymour Glanzer.
He declined to identify the witness,
saying "the important people who
come before a grand jury are never the
important people in the headlines." He
said the probe has been intensified.
—Justice Department sources said
"indictments are pretty far down the
road" in the grand jury inquiry.
Glanzer said "We're not going to be
stampeded into doing something
rash."
The Haldeman-Ehrlichman search
for documentation began days prior to
Nixon's acceptance Monday of their
resignations as his closest advisers,
sources said.
It apparently was prompted by
continuing news accounts linking them
to the Watergate swirl and was
accelerated after reports that John W.
Dean 111, fired Monday by Nixon as
presidential counsel, was ready to turn
over to investigators certain
documents relating to an alleged White
House coverup of Watergate
involvement.
Haldeman and Ehrlichman were
seen leaving the White House
yesterday morning carrying stacks of
documents. They rode off to an
undisclosed destination in the bark
seat of a White House limousine.
The New York Times, quoting
government investigators, said in its
Wednesday editions evidence had been
found that six former top Nixon
Administration aides officials were
involved in coverup and obstruction
attempts in the Watergate case.
They were named as Mitchell,
Haldeman, Ehrlichman, Dean,
Magruder and former White House
special assistant Frederick C. Laßue.
Sources close to the case said all six
men were expected to be indicted by a
federal grand jury, the Times said.
