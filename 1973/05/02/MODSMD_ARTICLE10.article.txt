# Peace Accords Change No U.S. Goals
## The 						Nixon Doctrine In Cambodia 
### 
Concerned Asian Scholars

Nixon's signing of the recent
peace accords changed nothing as
far as U.S. goals in Indochina are
concerned. Consider the following
facts: All U.S. soldiers in uniform
have left South Vietnam but
10,000 to 20,000 civilian advisors
under direct or indirect
Department of Defense contract
are currently being sent back into
the country. These people are to
support the Saigon military and
administration in security
programs, communication systems
maintenance, aircraft
maintenance, as well as the actual
flying of aircraft. Plans for these
"advisors" were being made even
before the accords were signed.
This is a calculated violation of
the intent of the agreement.
The U.S. has consistently
refused to defuse the mines in
North Vietnam's harbors in spite
of the Paris agreement's
stipulation that the mines be
removed at the earliest possible

moment.
Recently the U.S. said it was
halting all removal operations
because of alleged North
Vietnamese ceasefire violations.
Weeks before this, however, a
Navy spokesman said that only a
few of the thousands of mines had
been deactivated and that all the
mines wouldn't be deactivated
until mid-summer.
According to the Paris accord,
the "pacification program" in
which U.S. advisors counseled
Saigon officials on rural security
problems, was to be dismantled.
(This included the Phoenix
program whose goal was to wipe
out the NLF infrastructure by
internment and assasination; by
Saigon's estimate over 40,000
people were killed in this
program). Pacification continues
with reduced manpower under the
name of "Reconstruction and
Resettlement." It is being headed
by George Jacobson, the same
man who headed the pre-ceasefire
pacification program.
Pretext
The U.S. is heavily into
Cambodian affairs. According to a
recent Senate Foreign Relations
Committee report, the U.S. is now
more involved than ever in
Cambodia. We have been bombing
Cambodian insurgents for months
on the pretext that North
Vietnamese are fighting in
Cambodia. This is false. The
bombing has been to prop up the
corrupt regime of Lon Nol against
an indigenous insurgent
political-military force led by
Cambodian Communist units.
Even U.S. officials in Phnom Penh
said that there is no "verifiable,
documented evidence" that any
Vietnamese communist troops are
serving in combat roles in
Cambodia.
The U.S. has actually increased
its firepower in Southeast Asia
during the last few months. In
Thailand there are now 75,000
U.S. troops—three times the level
of American involvement in
Vietnam during the months just
before the ceasefire.
The meaning of this is that the
"Nixon Doctrine" remains the
basic method for implementing
U.S. goals in Southeast Asia. The
Doctrine states that (1) Asians
instead of Americans will fight the
wars in Asia that Washington
considers important, and (2) these
Asian armies will be trained,
equipped, and supported from the
air by the U.S. Nixon formulated
this doctrine in 1969 as a solution
to the then pressing dilemma of
how to reduce domestic political
opposition to the war killed while
still containing communism and
preserving the "free world"
through "protectorates," i.e.
client regimes.
Free
The "free world" has a very
concrete meaning: it consists of
areas where the U.S. is "free" to
find new markets for its excess
goods and capital, to utilize cheap
sources of labor, and to tap
sources of raw materials.
(Projections of the Department of
the Interior indicate that by 1985
the U.S. will depend on imports
for more than one half of its
supplies of nine basic raw
materials.)
All this is vital for
understanding why "peace is
breaking down" in Indochina. In
South Vietnam, according to the
Far Eastern Economic Review,
"Peace is blocked by Thieu's
intransigence, an intransigence
that gets its muscle from the
assurance of U.S. military backing
in the event of another Vietcong
offensive."
During Thieu's recent visit to
the U.S., one of his aides
explicitly acknowledged (San
Francisco Chronicle, April 8) that
Thieu was intent upon frustrating

the political provisions of the
agreements. There should be no
mistake that this is exactly what
Nixon is angling for. He requires
that Thieu stay in power alone;
right after the signing of the
agreements, Nixon stated that he
saw the Thieu regime as the sole
legitimate government in South
Vietnam. This is an explicit
violation of the agreements which
state that the Provisional
Revolutionary Government is,
along with Thieu's government, a
legitimate political force. The end
result of denying the PRG this

role has to be more fighting. The
communist forces of the South
have no choice to attack if they
are systematically denied access to
legitimate political channels.
In Cambodia the pattern is
about the same. The U.S. supports
an isolated Lon Nol. His army is
provided with equipment and
supported by B-52s and fighters
while the civilian population feels
the brunt of the bombing.
Meanwhile, the insurgent force is
a unified one, composed of
Sihanouk supporters, Cambodian
communists, and people against

Lon Nol and the U.S. This force
controls 80 percent of the land
and 50 percent of the people of
Cambodia. It governs most of
Cambodia with a fraction of the
outside aid Lon Nol receives from
the U.S.
So the war goes on for the
same goals using more insidious
methods, many of them still being
developed at Stanford.

on the pretext that North
Vietnamese are fighting in
Cambodia. This is false. The
bombing has been to prop up the
corrupt regime of Lon Nol against
an indigenous insurgent
political-military force led by
Cambodian Communist units.
Even U.S. officials in Phnom Penh
said that there is no "verifiable,
documented evidence" that any
Vietnamese communist troops are
serving in combat roles in
Cambodia.
The U.S. has actually increased
its firepower in Southeast Asia
during the last few months. In
Thailand there are now 75,000
U.S. troops—three times the level
of American involvement in
Vietnam during the months just
before the ceasefire.
The meaning of this is that the
"Nixon Doctrine" remains the
basic method for implementing
U.S. goals in Southeast Asia. The
Doctrine states that (1) Asians
instead of Americans will fight the
wars in Asia that Washington
considers important, and (2) these
Asian armies will be trained,
equipped, and supported from the
air by the U.S. Nixon formulated
this doctrine in 1969 as a solution
to the then pressing dilemma of
how to reduce domestic political
opposition to the war killed while
still containing communism and
preserving the "free world"
through "protectorates," i.e.
client regimes.
Free
The "free world" has a very
concrete meaning: it consists of
areas where the U.S. is "free" to
find new markets for its excess
goods and capital, to utilize cheap
sources of labor, and to tap
sources of raw materials.
(Projections of the Department of
the Interior indicate that by 1985
the U.S. will depend on imports
for more than one half of its
supplies of nine basic raw
materials.)
All this is vital for
understanding why "peace is
breaking down" in Indochina. In
South Vietnam, according to the
Far Eastern Economic Review,
"Peace is blocked by Thieu's
intransigence, an intransigence
that gets its muscle from the
assurance of U.S. military backing
in the event of another Vietcong
offensive."
During Thieu's recent visit to
the U.S., one of his aides
explicitly acknowledged (San
Francisco Chronicle, April 8) that
Thieu was intent upon frustrating

the political provisions of the
agreements. There should be no
mistake that this is exactly what
Nixon is angling for. He requires
that Thieu stay in power alone;
right after the signing of the
agreements, Nixon stated that he
saw the Thieu regime as the sole
legitimate government in South
Vietnam. This is an explicit
violation of the agreements which
state that the Provisional
Revolutionary Government is,
along with Thieu's government, a
legitimate political force. The end
result of denying the PRG this

role has to be more fighting. The
communist forces of the South
have no choice to attack if they
are systematically denied access to
legitimate political channels.
In Cambodia the pattern is
about the same. The U.S. supports
an isolated Lon Nol. His army is
provided with equipment and
supported by B-52s and fighters
while the civilian population feels
the brunt of the bombing.
Meanwhile, the insurgent force is
a unified one, composed of
Sihanouk supporters, Cambodian
communists, and people against

Lon Nol and the U.S. This force
controls 80 percent of the land
and 50 percent of the people of
Cambodia. It governs most of
Cambodia with a fraction of the
outside aid Lon Nol receives from
the U.S.
So the war goes on for the
same goals using more insidious
methods, many of them still being
developed at Stanford.

Nixon's signing of the recent
peace accords changed nothing as
far as U.S. goals in Indochina are
concerned. Consider the following
facts: All U.S. soldiers in uniform
have left South Vietnam but
10,000 to 20,000 civilian advisors
under direct or indirect
Department of Defense contract
are currently being sent back into
the country. These people are to
support the Saigon military and
administration in security
programs, communication systems
maintenance, aircraft
maintenance, as well as the actual
flying of aircraft. Plans for these
"advisors" were being made even
before the accords were signed.
This is a calculated violation of
the intent of the agreement.
The U.S. has consistently
refused to defuse the mines in
North Vietnam's harbors in spite
of the Paris agreement's
stipulation that the mines be
removed at the earliest possible

moment.
Recently the U.S. said it was
halting all removal operations
because of alleged North
Vietnamese ceasefire violations.
Weeks before this, however, a
Navy spokesman said that only a
few of the thousands of mines had
been deactivated and that all the
mines wouldn't be deactivated
until mid-summer.
According to the Paris accord,
the "pacification program" in
which U.S. advisors counseled
Saigon officials on rural security
problems, was to be dismantled.
(This included the Phoenix
program whose goal was to wipe
out the NLF infrastructure by
internment and assasination; by
Saigon's estimate over 40,000
people were killed in this
program). Pacification continues
with reduced manpower under the
name of "Reconstruction and
Resettlement." It is being headed
by George Jacobson, the same

offensive."
During Thieu's recent visit to
the U.S., one of his aides
explicitly acknowledged (San
Francisco Chronicle, April 8) that
Thieu was intent upon frustrating

the political provisions of the
agreements. There should be no
mistake that this is exactly what
Nixon is angling for. He requires
that Thieu stay in power alone;
right after the signing of the
agreements, Nixon stated that he
saw the Thieu regime as the sole
legitimate government in South
Vietnam. This is an explicit
violation of the agreements which
state that the Provisional
Revolutionary Government is,
along with Thieu's government, a
legitimate political force. The end
result of denying the PRG this

role has to be more fighting. The
communist forces of the South
have no choice to attack if they
are systematically denied access to
legitimate political channels.
In Cambodia the pattern is
about the same. The U.S. supports
an isolated Lon Nol. His army is
provided with equipment and
supported by B-52s and fighters
while the civilian population feels
the brunt of the bombing.
Meanwhile, the insurgent force is
a unified one, composed of
Sihanouk supporters, Cambodian
communists, and people against

Lon Nol and the U.S. This force
controls 80 percent of the land
and 50 percent of the people of
Cambodia. It governs most of
Cambodia with a fraction of the
outside aid Lon Nol receives from
the U.S.
So the war goes on for the
same goals using more insidious
methods, many of them still being
developed at Stanford.

Nixon's signing of the recent
peace accords changed nothing as
far as U.S. goals in Indochina are
concerned. Consider the following
facts: All U.S. soldiers in uniform
have left South Vietnam but
10,000 to 20,000 civilian advisors
under direct or indirect
Department of Defense contract
are currently being sent back into
the country. These people are to
support the Saigon military and
administration in security
programs, communication systems
maintenance, aircraft
maintenance, as well as the actual
flying of aircraft. Plans for these
"advisors" were being made even
before the accords were signed.
This is a calculated violation of
the intent of the agreement.
The U.S. has consistently
refused to defuse the mines in
North Vietnam's harbors in spite
of the Paris agreement's
stipulation that the mines be
removed at the earliest possible

moment.
Recently the U.S. said it was
halting all removal operations
because of alleged North
Vietnamese ceasefire violations.
Weeks before this, however, a
Navy spokesman said that only a
few of the thousands of mines had
been deactivated and that all the
mines wouldn't be deactivated
until mid-summer.
According to the Paris accord,
the "pacification program" in
which U.S. advisors counseled
Saigon officials on rural security
problems, was to be dismantled.
(This included the Phoenix
program whose goal was to wipe
out the NLF infrastructure by
internment and assasination; by
Saigon's estimate over 40,000
people were killed in this
program). Pacification continues
with reduced manpower under the
name of "Reconstruction and
Resettlement." It is being headed
by George Jacobson, the same
man who headed the pre-ceasefire
pacification program.
Pretext
The U.S. is heavily into
Cambodian affairs. According to a
recent Senate Foreign Relations
Committee report, the U.S. is now
more involved than ever in
Cambodia. We have been bombing
Cambodian insurgents for months
on the pretext that North
Vietnamese are fighting in
Cambodia. This is false. The
bombing has been to prop up the
corrupt regime of Lon Nol against
an indigenous insurgent
political-military force led by
Cambodian Communist units.
Even U.S. officials in Phnom Penh
said that there is no "verifiable,
documented evidence" that any
Vietnamese communist troops are
serving in combat roles in
Cambodia.
The U.S. has actually increased
its firepower in Southeast Asia
during the last few months. In
Thailand there are now 75,000
U.S. troops—three times the level
of American involvement in
Vietnam during the months just
before the ceasefire.
The meaning of this is that the
"Nixon Doctrine" remains the
basic method for implementing
U.S. goals in Southeast Asia. The
Doctrine states that (1) Asians
instead of Americans will fight the
wars in Asia that Washington
considers important, and (2) these
Asian armies will be trained,
equipped, and supported from the
air by the U.S. Nixon formulated
this doctrine in 1969 as a solution
to the then pressing dilemma of
how to reduce domestic political
opposition to the war killed while
still containing communism and
preserving the "free world"
through "protectorates," i.e.
client regimes.
Free
The "free world" has a very
concrete meaning: it consists of
areas where the U.S. is "free" to
find new markets for its excess
goods and capital, to utilize cheap
sources of labor, and to tap
sources of raw materials.
(Projections of the Department of
the Interior indicate that by 1985
the U.S. will depend on imports
for more than one half of its
supplies of nine basic raw
materials.)
All this is vital for
understanding why "peace is
breaking down" in Indochina. In
South Vietnam, according to the
Far Eastern Economic Review,
"Peace is blocked by Thieu's
intransigence, an intransigence
that gets its muscle from the
assurance of U.S. military backing
in the event of another Vietcong
offensive."
