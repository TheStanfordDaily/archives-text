Death!
Editor:
I agree with the sense of
outrage that has been widely
expressed on the Stanford campus
about the Phi Delt incident. Those
who participated in the affair or
sanctioned it in any way must be
severely punished.
In fact, I think that those
involved should receive the
supreme penalty: Death. On the
other hand, perhaps death is too
good for those concerned.
How can a woman believe that
she has a right to possess her own
body? This could lead not just to
women renting their bodies on the
free market, but to women freely
choosing to put drugs into their
bodies, like marijuana or LSD.
The arrogance and impudence
of women who believe that they
own their own bodies in a
meaningful sense could lead not
only to prostitution and sexual
license, but also to the
performance of abortions.
I believe that it is correct to
criticize those who believe that
real freedom could be involved in
something like the taking of
drugs. After all, those who choose
to take drugs are forced to do so
by a harsh society and recalcitrant
environment which does not give
them the happy life they need.
How can a man believe that he
has a right to make a free
agreement with a consenting
woman? This could lead to young
lads and co-eds cohabiting on an
occasional or long-term basis.
Imagine youths being free to
enslave their bodies in hedonistic
pleasures. Imagine youths being
free to enslave themselves to the
horrid weed marijuana.
We can only hope that a
crackdown on prostitution will
lead to a salutary revival of the
Puritan approach to life on this
college campus.
Libertinism is of all things the
supreme vice. Death to the Phi
Delts.

Courageous Stand
Editor:
As a member of the Student
Conduct Legislative Committee, I
feel it is my responsibility to take
a stand on two issues which were
presented in last Thursday's Daily.
First, I oppose punitive action
of any sort by the University
against the Phi Delts for their
having raffled off a whore. The
only basis the University has for
acting on the case is that it
considers the raffle illegal,
immoral, or both. This being the
case, the University if it takes
action against the Phi Delts will
also have to take action against

the dope-dealing in Lambda Nu,
the room-by-room co-ed living in
Jordan, etc. Equal protection
under the law insures against
selective enforcement of any law.
I suggest that the University
administrators end their
self-righteous moralizing.
Second, I support immediate
and effective action against all
those who violate the Honor
Code. I recommend a one-quarter
suspension from the University
for the first offense, and
permanent expulsion for the
second offense. This will have
far-reaching benefits for Stanford.
First, student enrollment will be
reduced by one-third, permitting
smaller classes and less student
demand on faculty time. Second,
pre-med enrollment will be
reduced by seventy-five percent.
Everyone would be better off
without all of them, anyway.

I was greatly saddened to read
of the firing of SCIRE Director
Ron Jones. The brief time I
worked with him last quarter left
me with the conviction he was
one of the few innovative
administrators who care more
about students and their interests
than about legal red tape. His
firing has just reinforced my belief
that Stanford is more concerned
with "running an orderly
program" than attempting any
sort of program which may lie
somewhat left of the academic
line of demarcation.

As members of the Stanford
Jewish community, we are deeply

offended by the philosophy
expounded by the "Jews for
Jesus" group. As Jews, we
treasure the basic rights of
freedom of religion and freedom
of choice. However, we do not
appreciate those who desire to
impose their religious tenents
publicly upon us.
During the past year, Jewish
students have been subjected to a
barrage of cheap commercialism
from the "Jews for Jesus"
movement. The recent full-page
advertisement in the Daily (April
30) was in particularly bad taste.
Madison Avenue "schlock" falls
flat with us. Contrary to the
image which the ad in question
attempts to portray, Jewish
students who remain true to and
proud of their heritage are not
lonely, isolated, and unfulfilled.
Neither are we an "out-group" of
hapless, hopeless bookworms
existing in a spiritual voild while
our brethren who have "sold out"
enjoy the fruits of ecstatic
"personal experience."
As Jews, we are very much
satisfied with our Judaism as a
vital personal experience. We hope
that the Jews for Jesus will find
their religious fulfillment without
preaching at Jewish Jews to
accept their views.
To be a "Jew for Jesus" means
NOT TO BE A JEW. That this
distinction is blurred in the eyes
of a confused few is indeed
regrettable, and shows to us and
to the entire community not a
conviction, but an unfortunate
ignorance and/or rejection of the
religious and cultural heritage of
which these people claim to be a
part.
We close with a line from
Scripture: "For let all the peoples
walk each one in the name of its
god, But we will walk in the name
of the Lord our God for ever and
ever." (Micha 4:55)

As members of the Stanford
Jewish community, we are deeply

offended by the philosophy
expounded by the "Jews for
Jesus" group. As Jews, we
treasure the basic rights of
freedom of religion and freedom
of choice. However, we do not
appreciate those who desire to
impose their religious tenents
publicly upon us.
During the past year, Jewish
students have been subjected to a
barrage of cheap commercialism
from the "Jews for Jesus"
movement. The recent full-page
advertisement in the Daily (April
30) was in particularly bad taste.
Madison Avenue "schlock" falls
flat with us. Contrary to the
image which the ad in question
attempts to portray, Jewish
students who remain true to and
proud of their heritage are not
lonely, isolated, and unfulfilled.
Neither are we an "out-group" of
hapless, hopeless bookworms
existing in a spiritual voild while
our brethren who have "sold out"
enjoy the fruits of ecstatic
"personal experience."
As Jews, we are very much
satisfied with our Judaism as a
vital personal experience. We hope
that the Jews for Jesus will find
their religious fulfillment without
preaching at Jewish Jews to
accept their views.
To be a "Jew for Jesus" means
NOT TO BE A JEW. That this
distinction is blurred in the eyes
of a confused few is indeed
regrettable, and shows to us and
to the entire community not a
conviction, but an unfortunate
ignorance and/or rejection of the
religious and cultural heritage of
which these people claim to be a
part.
We close with a line from
Scripture: "For let all the peoples
walk each one in the name of its
god, But we will walk in the name
of the Lord our God for ever and
ever." (Micha 4:55)

Editor:
I agree with the sense of
outrage that has been widely
expressed on the Stanford campus
about the Phi Delt incident. Those
who participated in the affair or
sanctioned it in any way must be
severely punished.
In fact, I think that those
involved should receive the
supreme penalty: Death. On the
other hand, perhaps death is too
good for those concerned.
How can a woman believe that
she has a right to possess her own
body? This could lead not just to
women renting their bodies on the
free market, but to women freely
choosing to put drugs into their
bodies, like marijuana or LSD.
The arrogance and impudence
of women who believe that they
own their own bodies in a
meaningful sense could lead not
only to prostitution and sexual
license, but also to the
performance of abortions.
I believe that it is correct to
criticize those who believe that
real freedom could be involved in
something like the taking of
drugs. After all, those who choose
to take drugs are forced to do so
by a harsh society and recalcitrant
environment which does not give
them the happy life they need.
How can a man believe that he
has a right to make a free
agreement with a consenting
woman? This could lead to young
lads and co-eds cohabiting on an
occasional or long-term basis.
Imagine youths being free to
enslave their bodies in hedonistic
pleasures. Imagine youths being
free to enslave themselves to the
horrid weed marijuana.
We can only hope that a
crackdown on prostitution will
lead to a salutary revival of the
Puritan approach to life on this
college campus.
Libertinism is of all things the
supreme vice. Death to the Phi
Delts.

As a member of the Student
Conduct Legislative Committee, I
feel it is my responsibility to take
a stand on two issues which were
presented in last Thursday's Daily.
First, I oppose punitive action
of any sort by the University
against the Phi Delts for their
having raffled off a whore. The
only basis the University has for
acting on the case is that it
considers the raffle illegal,
immoral, or both. This being the
case, the University if it takes
action against the Phi Delts will
also have to take action against

the dope-dealing in Lambda Nu,
the room-by-room co-ed living in
Jordan, etc. Equal protection
under the law insures against
selective enforcement of any law.
I suggest that the University
administrators end their
self-righteous moralizing.
Second, I support immediate
and effective action against all
those who violate the Honor
Code. I recommend a one-quarter
suspension from the University
for the first offense, and
permanent expulsion for the
second offense. This will have
far-reaching benefits for Stanford.
First, student enrollment will be
reduced by one-third, permitting
smaller classes and less student
demand on faculty time. Second,
pre-med enrollment will be
reduced by seventy-five percent.
Everyone would be better off
without all of them, anyway.

I was greatly saddened to read
of the firing of SCIRE Director
Ron Jones. The brief time I
worked with him last quarter left
me with the conviction he was
one of the few innovative
administrators who care more
about students and their interests
than about legal red tape. His
firing has just reinforced my belief
that Stanford is more concerned
with "running an orderly
program" than attempting any
sort of program which may lie
somewhat left of the academic

Conduct Legislative Committee, I
feel it is my responsibility to take
a stand on two issues which were
presented in last Thursday's Daily.
First, I oppose punitive action
of any sort by the University
against the Phi Delts for their
having raffled off a whore. The
only basis the University has for
acting on the case is that it
considers the raffle illegal,
immoral, or both. This being the
case, the University if it takes
action against the Phi Delts will
also have to take action against

the dope-dealing in Lambda Nu,
the room-by-room co-ed living in
Jordan, etc. Equal protection
under the law insures against
selective enforcement of any law.
I suggest that the University
administrators end their
self-righteous moralizing.
Second, I support immediate
and effective action against all
those who violate the Honor
Code. I recommend a one-quarter
suspension from the University
for the first offense, and
permanent expulsion for the
second offense. This will have
far-reaching benefits for Stanford.
First, student enrollment will be
reduced by one-third, permitting
smaller classes and less student
demand on faculty time. Second,
pre-med enrollment will be
reduced by seventy-five percent.
Everyone would be better off
without all of them, anyway.

I was greatly saddened to read
of the firing of SCIRE Director
Ron Jones. The brief time I
worked with him last quarter left
me with the conviction he was
one of the few innovative
administrators who care more
about students and their interests
than about legal red tape. His
firing has just reinforced my belief
that Stanford is more concerned
with "running an orderly
program" than attempting any
sort of program which may lie
somewhat left of the academic
line of demarcation.

As members of the Stanford
Jewish community, we are deeply

offended by the philosophy
expounded by the "Jews for
Jesus" group. As Jews, we
treasure the basic rights of
freedom of religion and freedom
of choice. However, we do not
appreciate those who desire to
impose their religious tenents
publicly upon us.
During the past year, Jewish
students have been subjected to a
barrage of cheap commercialism
from the "Jews for Jesus"
movement. The recent full-page
advertisement in the Daily (April
30) was in particularly bad taste.
Madison Avenue "schlock" falls
flat with us. Contrary to the
image which the ad in question
attempts to portray, Jewish
students who remain true to and
proud of their heritage are not
lonely, isolated, and unfulfilled.
Neither are we an "out-group" of
hapless, hopeless bookworms
existing in a spiritual voild while
our brethren who have "sold out"
enjoy the fruits of ecstatic
"personal experience."
As Jews, we are very much
satisfied with our Judaism as a
vital personal experience. We hope
that the Jews for Jesus will find
their religious fulfillment without
preaching at Jewish Jews to
accept their views.
To be a "Jew for Jesus" means
NOT TO BE A JEW. That this
distinction is blurred in the eyes
of a confused few is indeed
regrettable, and shows to us and
to the entire community not a
conviction, but an unfortunate
ignorance and/or rejection of the
religious and cultural heritage of
which these people claim to be a
part.
We close with a line from
Scripture: "For let all the peoples
walk each one in the name of its
god, But we will walk in the name
of the Lord our God for ever and
ever." (Micha 4:55)

Death!
Editor:
I agree with the sense of
outrage that has been widely
expressed on the Stanford campus
about the Phi Delt incident. Those
who participated in the affair or
sanctioned it in any way must be
severely punished.
In fact, I think that those
involved should receive the
supreme penalty: Death. On the
other hand, perhaps death is too
good for those concerned.
How can a woman believe that
she has a right to possess her own
body? This could lead not just to
women renting their bodies on the
free market, but to women freely
choosing to put drugs into their
bodies, like marijuana or LSD.
The arrogance and impudence
of women who believe that they
own their own bodies in a
meaningful sense could lead not
only to prostitution and sexual
license, but also to the
performance of abortions.
I believe that it is correct to
criticize those who believe that
real freedom could be involved in
something like the taking of
drugs. After all, those who choose
to take drugs are forced to do so
by a harsh society and recalcitrant
environment which does not give
them the happy life they need.
How can a man believe that he
has a right to make a free
agreement with a consenting
woman? This could lead to young
lads and co-eds cohabiting on an
occasional or long-term basis.
Imagine youths being free to
enslave their bodies in hedonistic
pleasures. Imagine youths being
free to enslave themselves to the
horrid weed marijuana.
We can only hope that a
crackdown on prostitution will
lead to a salutary revival of the
Puritan approach to life on this
college campus.
Libertinism is of all things the
supreme vice. Death to the Phi
Delts.
