WASHINGTON - The Office of
Economic Opportunity, launched
eight years ago as symbol and
command post of the war on
poverty, is now a casualty, a
judge's decision away from
immediate extinction.
The battle over OEO,
seemingly the final one, centers
on assessments of its
accomplishments. President Nixon
called most OEO programs a
dismal failure when he ordered
the agency dismantled by this
summer and almost all its
remaining programs shipped off to
other agencies.
Some OEO supporters and
employees disagreed and won a
federal judge's ruling that Nixon
couldn't act alone to shut down
OEO as long as Congress was
willing to appropriate funds to
keep it going.
But the money runs out July 1
and congressional prospects for
providing more funds are
uncertain.
What remains certain for OEO
are questions and assessments.
The OEO may have been symbol
and command post of the poverty
war, but it never controlled all of
its programs, lost many of them
to other agencies and never
directed more than a fraction of
the war's budget. In eight years, it
spent $12 billion while all federal
aid to the poor in the same period
totaled $132 billion.
Precise Figures Scarce
And, as to the questions,
precise figures are hard to come
by.
The federal buraaucracy never
came up with a yardstick,
acceptable to both critics and
backers, that could measure the
cost effectiveness of various
programs, but some key
circumstances may be cited:
—The General Accounting
Office, the congressional

watchdog agency, reported this
month that $207.9 million out of
$5.4 billion in OEO grants from
1966-72 had been inadequately
documented or spent in
unauthorised ways. At the end of
1972 the GAO said, $113.4
million of the questioned costs
had been determined to be
allowable, $25.7 million were
disallowed and $68.8 million
remained unresolved.
No Worse Than Others
Defenders of the OEO say that
the accounting and financial
management of its projects were
no worse than some other
agencies.
—Within a year of its inception,
OEO said it was spending $785
million to help, directly and
indirectly, 4.9 million poor. By
1971, the agency had been
stripped of many of its programs,
but through its Community
Action Agencies said it was
serving eight million persons at a
cost of $1.18 billion.
Still, Sargeant Shriver, first
OEO chief, said recently that the
funds were not sufficient. 'The
great tragedy of the war on
poverty is that we never got the
ammunition ... money," he told
Congress.
Census Bureau's Estimates
—Between 1964-69 the Census
Bureau's estimate of the nation's
poor dropped from 36 million to
22.5 million. The total started to
climb again in this decade and
reached 25 million in 1971.
To the late President Johnson,
the five-year drop was a measure
of success in the war on poverty.
But no one is prepared to say how
much of the decline resulted from
OEO and other federal programs
and how much from general
economic trends in the nation.
—Welfare roles didn't dwindle.
On the contrary, by June 30,
1971, about 14.3 million
Americans were on welfare at a
cost of $10 billion annually. That
was twice the people at three
times the outlay as in 1960.
Wholly Contradictory
It seemed a startling and, to
many, a wholly contradictory
development. But OEO-initiated
Community Action Agencies,
which Nixon wants killed and
Legal Services offices took it as a

responsibility to inform the needy
of what they could receive under
welfare programs. As a result,
OEO programs had a far greater
initial effect at getting people on
relief rather than off it.
—The war on poverty
coincided with rioting and looting
that seared many poor, black
neighborhoods in cities across the
nation in the mid-to-late 60s. FBI
statistics showed the rate of
serious crime doubled between
1964 and 1971, another social
indicator related to poverty.
—Some of the poor appeared
to be using OEO in a push for
political power as much as
economic improvement.
Community Action Agencies led
that fight, and in some cases
friction between the newly
organized poor and public and
elected officials produced a flood
of complaints to Washington.

—A king of poverty industry
grew up, bristling with well-paid
consultants, advisors and
evaluators. No one can say for
certain how much money was
spent on them, but one current
official estimated that the sum
was between $100-120 million a
year from 1965-69.
—Auditors from OEO and the
GAO issued reports disclosing
unexplained or improper use of
federal funds ranging form $6.6
million in New York City to
$2,259 in Loup City, Neb.
"We conned the public for
years. .. . Attempts for objective
evaluation just don't work
because I can make any program
look good and any program look
bad. It depends on what you
include in the costs and what you
include in the benefits."

—Between 1964-69 the Census
Bureau's estimate of the nation's
poor dropped from 36 million to
22.5 million. The total started to
climb again in this decade and
reached 25 million in 1971.
To the late President Johnson,
the five-year drop was a measure
of success in the war on poverty.
But no one is prepared to say how
much of the decline resulted from
OEO and other federal programs
and how much from general
economic trends in the nation.
—Welfare roles didn't dwindle.
On the contrary, by June 30,
1971, about 14.3 million
Americans were on welfare at a
cost of $10 billion annually. That
was twice the people at three
times the outlay as in 1960.
Wholly Contradictory
It seemed a startling and, to
many, a wholly contradictory
development. But OEO-initiated
Community Action Agencies,
which Nixon wants killed and
Legal Services offices took it as a

responsibility to inform the needy
of what they could receive under
welfare programs. As a result,
OEO programs had a far greater
initial effect at getting people on
relief rather than off it.
—The war on poverty
coincided with rioting and looting
that seared many poor, black
neighborhoods in cities across the
nation in the mid-to-late 60s. FBI
statistics showed the rate of
serious crime doubled between
1964 and 1971, another social
indicator related to poverty.
—Some of the poor appeared
to be using OEO in a push for
political power as much as
economic improvement.
Community Action Agencies led
that fight, and in some cases
friction between the newly
organized poor and public and
elected officials produced a flood
of complaints to Washington.

—A king of poverty industry
grew up, bristling with well-paid
consultants, advisors and
evaluators. No one can say for
certain how much money was
spent on them, but one current
official estimated that the sum
was between $100-120 million a
year from 1965-69.
—Auditors from OEO and the
GAO issued reports disclosing
unexplained or improper use of
federal funds ranging form $6.6
million in New York City to
$2,259 in Loup City, Neb.
"We conned the public for
years. .. . Attempts for objective

include in the costs and what you

WASHINGTON - The Office of
Economic Opportunity, launched
eight years ago as symbol and
command post of the war on
poverty, is now a casualty, a
judge's decision away from
immediate extinction.
The battle over OEO,
seemingly the final one, centers
on assessments of its
accomplishments. President Nixon
called most OEO programs a
dismal failure when he ordered
the agency dismantled by this
summer and almost all its
remaining programs shipped off to
other agencies.
Some OEO supporters and
employees disagreed and won a
federal judge's ruling that Nixon
couldn't act alone to shut down
OEO as long as Congress was
willing to appropriate funds to
keep it going.
But the money runs out July 1
and congressional prospects for
providing more funds are
uncertain.
What remains certain for OEO
are questions and assessments.
The OEO may have been symbol
and command post of the poverty
war, but it never controlled all of
its programs, lost many of them
to other agencies and never
directed more than a fraction of
the war's budget. In eight years, it
spent $12 billion while all federal
aid to the poor in the same period
totaled $132 billion.
Precise Figures Scarce
And, as to the questions,
precise figures are hard to come
by.
The federal buraaucracy never
came up with a yardstick,
acceptable to both critics and
backers, that could measure the
cost effectiveness of various
programs, but some key
circumstances may be cited:
—The General Accounting
Office, the congressional

watchdog agency, reported this
month that $207.9 million out of
$5.4 billion in OEO grants from
1966-72 had been inadequately
documented or spent in
unauthorised ways. At the end of
1972 the GAO said, $113.4
million of the questioned costs
had been determined to be
allowable, $25.7 million were
disallowed and $68.8 million
remained unresolved.
No Worse Than Others
Defenders of the OEO say that
the accounting and financial
management of its projects were
no worse than some other
agencies.
—Within a year of its inception,
OEO said it was spending $785
million to help, directly and
indirectly, 4.9 million poor. By
1971, the agency had been
stripped of many of its programs,
but through its Community
Action Agencies said it was
serving eight million persons at a
cost of $1.18 billion.
Still, Sargeant Shriver, first
OEO chief, said recently that the
funds were not sufficient. 'The
great tragedy of the war on
poverty is that we never got the
ammunition ... money," he told
Congress.

seemingly the final one, centers
on assessments of its
accomplishments. President Nixon
called most OEO programs a
dismal failure when he ordered
the agency dismantled by this
summer and almost all its
remaining programs shipped off to
other agencies.
Some OEO supporters and
employees disagreed and won a
federal judge's ruling that Nixon
couldn't act alone to shut down
OEO as long as Congress was
willing to appropriate funds to
keep it going.
But the money runs out July 1
and congressional prospects for
providing more funds are
uncertain.
What remains certain for OEO
are questions and assessments.
The OEO may have been symbol
and command post of the poverty
war, but it never controlled all of
its programs, lost many of them
to other agencies and never
directed more than a fraction of
the war's budget. In eight years, it
spent $12 billion while all federal
aid to the poor in the same period
totaled $132 billion.
Precise Figures Scarce
And, as to the questions,
precise figures are hard to come
by.
The federal buraaucracy never
came up with a yardstick,
acceptable to both critics and
backers, that could measure the
cost effectiveness of various
programs, but some key
circumstances may be cited:
—The General Accounting
Office, the congressional

watchdog agency, reported this
month that $207.9 million out of
$5.4 billion in OEO grants from
1966-72 had been inadequately
documented or spent in
unauthorised ways. At the end of
1972 the GAO said, $113.4
million of the questioned costs
had been determined to be
allowable, $25.7 million were
disallowed and $68.8 million
remained unresolved.
No Worse Than Others
Defenders of the OEO say that
the accounting and financial
management of its projects were
no worse than some other
agencies.
—Within a year of its inception,
OEO said it was spending $785
million to help, directly and
indirectly, 4.9 million poor. By
1971, the agency had been
stripped of many of its programs,
but through its Community
Action Agencies said it was
serving eight million persons at a
cost of $1.18 billion.
Still, Sargeant Shriver, first
OEO chief, said recently that the
funds were not sufficient. 'The
great tragedy of the war on
poverty is that we never got the
ammunition ... money," he told
Congress.
Census Bureau's Estimates
—Between 1964-69 the Census
Bureau's estimate of the nation's
poor dropped from 36 million to
22.5 million. The total started to
climb again in this decade and
reached 25 million in 1971.
To the late President Johnson,
the five-year drop was a measure
of success in the war on poverty.
But no one is prepared to say how
much of the decline resulted from
OEO and other federal programs
and how much from general
economic trends in the nation.
—Welfare roles didn't dwindle.
On the contrary, by June 30,
1971, about 14.3 million
Americans were on welfare at a
cost of $10 billion annually. That
was twice the people at three
times the outlay as in 1960.
Wholly Contradictory
It seemed a startling and, to
many, a wholly contradictory
development. But OEO-initiated
Community Action Agencies,
which Nixon wants killed and
Legal Services offices took it as a

responsibility to inform the needy
of what they could receive under
welfare programs. As a result,
OEO programs had a far greater
initial effect at getting people on
relief rather than off it.
—The war on poverty
coincided with rioting and looting
that seared many poor, black
neighborhoods in cities across the
nation in the mid-to-late 60s. FBI
statistics showed the rate of
serious crime doubled between
1964 and 1971, another social
indicator related to poverty.
—Some of the poor appeared
to be using OEO in a push for
political power as much as
economic improvement.
Community Action Agencies led
that fight, and in some cases
friction between the newly
organized poor and public and
elected officials produced a flood
of complaints to Washington.

—A king of poverty industry
grew up, bristling with well-paid
consultants, advisors and
evaluators. No one can say for
certain how much money was
spent on them, but one current
official estimated that the sum
was between $100-120 million a
year from 1965-69.
—Auditors from OEO and the
GAO issued reports disclosing
unexplained or improper use of
federal funds ranging form $6.6
million in New York City to
$2,259 in Loup City, Neb.
"We conned the public for
years. .. . Attempts for objective
evaluation just don't work
because I can make any program
look good and any program look
bad. It depends on what you
include in the costs and what you
include in the benefits."
