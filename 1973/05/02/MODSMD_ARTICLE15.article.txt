# Executive Branch Hurt
## Scandal Keeps Jobs Unfilled 
### Associated Press 
WASHINGTON — The Watergate scandal, its impact
rippling through vast reaches of the government, is
cited by officials sources as one reason for the White
House's inability to fill nearly 50 top-level federal
jobs.
Sources contacted last week in an Associated
Press survey also reported instances of paperwork
piling up and employee morale sagging because of
Watergate, because of President Nixon's
second-term reorganization plan, or the lame-duck
aspect of his administration.
White House spokesman reject suggestions that
Watergate is to blame for the lag in rounding out
Nixon's second-term team or that it has slowed the
bureaucratic processes.
"The processes of government are going
on . .. the work of government is being done," said
White House Press Secretary Ronald L. Ziegler.
But other sources report a near-paralysis has set
in at some policy-making levels in the two weeks
since Nixon announced he had launched a personal
investigation of the Watergate case after major but
still undisclosed developments came to his
attention.
The AP survey stretching into widespread sections
of the federal establishment also found:
—A White House breakdown shows 26
sub-Cabinet posts remain unfilled three months

after Nixon began his second term and launched his
reorganization plan. In the upper levels of some
departments, the vacancy rate exceeds 25 percent.
—Ambassadors are yet to be named for 23
countries, a vacancy rate of 18 percent in these top
diplomatic posts.
—Latest statistics indicate more than 400
vacancies in lower- and middle-level "Schedule 0"
government jobs, meaning that about 30 percent of
these jobs filled by political appointment, are
empty.
—Reports mandated by the President or Congress
are long overdue in some cases. At the Department
of Health, Education and Welfare, one source
familiar with the lagging bureaucratic pace said
"people are waiting for new bosses to get new
directions."
—Low morale is cited virtually everywhere in
government. "You'd be surprised how Watergate has
affected morale," said an Agriculture Department
source. "The trauma has really set in," added a
Social Security Administration source.
—At the White House, some staffers have noted a
sudden slowing in their usually hectic work pace.
One Executive Office Building secretary said that
for the first time in years she's been able to go home
before dark because "nothing is coming in from the
departments."
