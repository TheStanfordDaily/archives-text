# Livestock-Growth Drug Causes Cancer

By The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - AH three
livestock-growth drugs
recommended by The Agriculture
Department as substitutes for
outlawed DES have been classified
by government scientists as
proven or potential cancer-causing
chemicals.
"All estrogens are considered
to be carcinogens, since all
estrogens that have been
adequately tested have been
shown to be carcinogens in
animals," a Food and Drug
Administration biologist
concluded in an internal memo
two years ago.
DES, fed to U.S. cattle and
sheep for more than 20 years to
produce meat faster and more
cheaply, causes cancer in
laboratory animals and has been
linked to vaginal cancer in young
women whose mothers took the
drug during pregnancy.
In announcing completion of
the DES ban to include ear
implants as well as feed additives,
the FDA sought Thursday to
minimize the possible impact on
inflated meat prices.
Because DES substitutes are
available to cattle and sheep
producers, Acting Commissioner
Sherwin Gardner said, the ban
effective Friday "need not disrupt
the nation's meat supply, cause an
increase in meat prices or have an
adverse effect on the environment
because of increased animal
waste."
USDA Announcement
The USDA followed with its
own announcement listing as
alternatives hormone or
hormone-like products containing
estradiol benzoate, progesterone,
testosterone proprionate and
zeranol or zearalanol.
They are among 10 hormonal
drugs the FDA classifies as proven
or potential carcinogens,
according to the March 4, 1970,
memo from Ernest J. Umberger,
director of the FDA's Division of
Drug Biology.
"The cases of diethylstilbestrol
DES and estrone are
well-documented" as carcinogens,
Umberger wrote. "Estradiol and
estrone are normally converted
from one to the other in the
animal body."

"The evidence that
progesterone and testosterone are
carcinogens is somewhat tenuous
but, since both of these
compounds are metabolized to
estrogens in the boyd, we have

maintained that they are potential
carcinogens and have treated them
as carcinogens in considering their
use where they might possibly
become a food additive."
Aggriculture Secretary Earl L.

Rutz said the total DES ban "will
result in increased food costs to
the consumer.' to an unknown
extent.
"Recently he had estimated
that elimination of the drug, used
in 80 percent of the nation's beef
herd, would boost prices 3 1 /i cents
a pound or between $300 million
and $460 million annually, based
on 1971 USDA economists'
forecasts.
Cattlemen's Views
The American National
Cattlemen's Association said,
however, that the ban is likely to
increase retail beef prices eight
cents a pound or about $1.8

billion a year.
C.W. "Bill" McMillan,
executive vice president of the
association representing 250,000
beef-cattle producers, said
substitute drugs are more
expensive and less efficient,
resulting in higher costs that
farmers will pass along to
housewives.
