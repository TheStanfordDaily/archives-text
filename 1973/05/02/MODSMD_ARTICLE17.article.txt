To what extent is solicitation on campus legal? M.S.
Solicitors are handled by the Student Employment division of the
Career Planning and Placement Center. This is because solicitation
jobs provide opportunities for student employment, according to
University Ombudsman Harvey Hall.
Director of Student Employment, Pam Evans, said that right now
the only regulations governing solicitation were that it must take place
only in White Memorial Plaza, and that solicitors can't harrass people.
She went on to say that a set of regulations was being drawn up by
a committee made up of people from the Student Employment
Office, the Dean of Student Affairs' office and the University's legal
department. These regulations would outline the exact legal
restrictions placed on solicitation. Evans said that the rules would
probably go into effect next year.
If you have a complaint about a solicitor, Evans said that you can
take it to the Police Department, the Dean of Student Affairs' office,
or the Student Employment Office.

Are there any canoe paddles up at the Boathouse that are owned
by Stanford? Right now, paddles can be borrowed from dorms, but
what happens if the dorms are out of paddles, or if you live off
campus? L.T.M.
There are no paddles at the Boathouse, according to a guy who
works there. He suggested that students who do not live in dorms rent
paddles either from the I-Center or a housing group on campus.

Each year there is a shortage of undergraduate on-campus housing.
Does the University have any plans to remedy that situation? F.R.M.
Yes, say both David Garvin, Supervisor of Single Student Housing,
and Edward Scoles, Director of Housing Management.
However, the University's plans to build more student housing are
long range because there is no money to build housing immediately.
Garvin estimated that it would be roughly 4 to 5 years before any
more housing is built.

Where does the $92,000 mentioned in recent ASSU Presidential
campaign literature come from? R.M.
According to ASSU Financial Manager Sara Moore, the $92,719
budget that the ASSU had to work with this year was for operating
expenses only. It covered such things as salaries, supplies and banking
services.
The Course Review was the only program paid for with funds from
the ASSU operating budget. Moore emphasized that this was a special
allocation made by the Senate for this particular thing.
As for the source of the money used to support the ASSU, it came
from tuition paid by Stanford students.

She went on to say that a set of regulations was being drawn up by
a committee made up of people from the Student Employment
Office, the Dean of Student Affairs' office and the University's legal
department. These regulations would outline the exact legal
restrictions placed on solicitation. Evans said that the rules would
probably go into effect next year.
If you have a complaint about a solicitor, Evans said that you can
take it to the Police Department, the Dean of Student Affairs' office,
or the Student Employment Office.

Are there any canoe paddles up at the Boathouse that are owned
by Stanford? Right now, paddles can be borrowed from dorms, but
what happens if the dorms are out of paddles, or if you live off
campus? L.T.M.
There are no paddles at the Boathouse, according to a guy who
works there. He suggested that students who do not live in dorms rent
paddles either from the I-Center or a housing group on campus.

Each year there is a shortage of undergraduate on-campus housing.
Does the University have any plans to remedy that situation? F.R.M.
Yes, say both David Garvin, Supervisor of Single Student Housing,
and Edward Scoles, Director of Housing Management.
However, the University's plans to build more student housing are
long range because there is no money to build housing immediately.
Garvin estimated that it would be roughly 4 to 5 years before any
more housing is built.

Where does the $92,000 mentioned in recent ASSU Presidential
campaign literature come from? R.M.
According to ASSU Financial Manager Sara Moore, the $92,719
budget that the ASSU had to work with this year was for operating
expenses only. It covered such things as salaries, supplies and banking
services.
The Course Review was the only program paid for with funds from
the ASSU operating budget. Moore emphasized that this was a special
allocation made by the Senate for this particular thing.
As for the source of the money used to support the ASSU, it came
from tuition paid by Stanford students.

To what extent is solicitation on campus legal? M.S.
Solicitors are handled by the Student Employment division of the
Career Planning and Placement Center. This is because solicitation
jobs provide opportunities for student employment, according to
University Ombudsman Harvey Hall.
Director of Student Employment, Pam Evans, said that right now
the only regulations governing solicitation were that it must take place
only in White Memorial Plaza, and that solicitors can't harrass people.
