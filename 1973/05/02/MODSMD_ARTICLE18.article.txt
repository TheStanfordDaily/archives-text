# Better Together Or Apart?
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
Last weekend, Kris
Kristofferson and Rita Coolidge
appeared at De Anza College's
Flint Center in Cupertino. They
appeared individually and
together, and I still haven't
decided if the sum was greater or
less than the parts.
The show began with
Kristofferson and the band, which
consists of piano, organ, bass, and
drums, backing his acoustic guitar.
The real standout of the band was
Steve Broughton, from Fort
Worth, Texas. Kris quoted
another guitarist, Marc Benno, as
saying "There are no bad
guitarists in Fort Worth, and Steve
Broughton is the best."

Whether he was playing
acoustic six or twelve-string or
electric, regular or slide guitar,
what impressed me most was his
sense of timing and proportion.
He knew exactly how much to
say, and when and how to say it.
On country-sounding numbers
where most bands would use a
pedal steel guitar, Broughton got
essentially the same effects with a
slide. I'll take a good acoustic
slide guitarist over a mediocre
pedal steel player any day.
Kris sang most of his famous
songs, together with some newer
material. The audience frequently
applauded as it recognized
openings of songs like "Jesus Was
A Capricorn," "Sunday Morning

Comin' Down," "Lovin' Her Was
Easier Than Anything I'll Ever Do
Again," and"The Silver-Tongued
Devil and I."
Most of Kris' songs are similar
in style and content, telling of
people he has known, women he
has loved, places he has been, and
times he has been drunk, stoned,
or recovering. He gives the
impression of having been at the
bottom most of his life, like the
hero of his song "The Pilgrim":
"He's a poet, he's a picker, he's
a prophet, he's a pusher,
He's a pilgrim and a preacher
and a problem when he's
stoned;
He's a walking contradiction,
partly truth and partly

fiction,
Taking every wrong direction
on that lonely way back
home."
But, as he adds later, "The
goin' up was worth the comin'
down."
Before the two joined forces,
Rita Coolidge did a set with the
band. She began with a very
provocative rendition of "Fever,"
with an intensity and control of
her voice that many singers could
learn from. She played piano on
"A Woman Left Lonely," and
followed with a good rocking
tune, "You Go Your Way and I'll
Go Mine."
Her last song was "The Lady's
Not For Sale," the title song of
her newest album. This song was
written by Kristofferson, who
then joined her for the rest of the
set.
As they sang Bob Dylan's "I'll
Be Your Baby Tonight," "My
Crew," by Priscilla and Booker T.
Jones, and their own song "It
Sure Was Love While It Lasted,"
Rita and Kris stood holding hands
and sharing the mike, singing to
each other as if oblivious to the
audience.
Rita sang one song alone,
"Whiskey, Whiskey," and they
finished with Kris' best known
song, "Me and Bobby McGee."
This last set was musically very
good, but I felt almost like a
voyeur, watching these two lovers
sing to one another while the
backup musicians modestly
averted their eyes.

tune, "You Go Your Way and I'll
Go Mine."
Her last song was "The Lady's
Not For Sale," the title song of
her newest album. This song was
written by Kristofferson, who
then joined her for the rest of the
set.
As they sang Bob Dylan's "I'll
Be Your Baby Tonight," "My
Crew," by Priscilla and Booker T.
Jones, and their own song "It
Sure Was Love While It Lasted,"
Rita and Kris stood holding hands
and sharing the mike, singing to
each other as if oblivious to the
audience.
Rita sang one song alone,
"Whiskey, Whiskey," and they
finished with Kris' best known
song, "Me and Bobby McGee."
This last set was musically very
good, but I felt almost like a
voyeur, watching these two lovers
sing to one another while the
backup musicians modestly
averted their eyes.

UPCOMING PERFORMANCES — The Lar Lubovitch Dance Company will perform in a blend of classic, modern, jazz and pop styles at
Memorial Auditorium Thursday and Friday at 8. Tickets are $4.75, $3.75 and $2.75.
Last weekend, Kris
Kristofferson and Rita Coolidge
appeared at De Anza College's
Flint Center in Cupertino. They
appeared individually and
together, and I still haven't
decided if the sum was greater or
less than the parts.
The show began with
Kristofferson and the band, which
consists of piano, organ, bass, and
drums, backing his acoustic guitar.
The real standout of the band was
Steve Broughton, from Fort
Worth, Texas. Kris quoted
another guitarist, Marc Benno, as
saying "There are no bad
guitarists in Fort Worth, and Steve
Broughton is the best."

Whether he was playing
acoustic six or twelve-string or
electric, regular or slide guitar,
what impressed me most was his
sense of timing and proportion.
He knew exactly how much to
say, and when and how to say it.
On country-sounding numbers
where most bands would use a
pedal steel guitar, Broughton got
essentially the same effects with a
slide. I'll take a good acoustic
slide guitarist over a mediocre
pedal steel player any day.
Kris sang most of his famous
songs, together with some newer
material. The audience frequently
applauded as it recognized
openings of songs like "Jesus Was
A Capricorn," "Sunday Morning

Comin' Down," "Lovin' Her Was
Easier Than Anything I'll Ever Do
Again," and"The Silver-Tongued
Devil and I."
Most of Kris' songs are similar
in style and content, telling of
people he has known, women he
has loved, places he has been, and
times he has been drunk, stoned,
or recovering. He gives the
impression of having been at the
bottom most of his life, like the
hero of his song "The Pilgrim":
"He's a poet, he's a picker, he's
a prophet, he's a pusher,
He's a pilgrim and a preacher
and a problem when he's
stoned;
He's a walking contradiction,
partly truth and partly

fiction,
Taking every wrong direction
on that lonely way back
home."
But, as he adds later, "The
goin' up was worth the comin'
down."
Before the two joined forces,
Rita Coolidge did a set with the
band. She began with a very
provocative rendition of "Fever,"
with an intensity and control of
her voice that many singers could
learn from. She played piano on
"A Woman Left Lonely," and
followed with a good rocking
tune, "You Go Your Way and I'll
Go Mine."
Her last song was "The Lady's
Not For Sale," the title song of
her newest album. This song was
written by Kristofferson, who
then joined her for the rest of the
set.
