# Borodin Quartet Gets Enthusiastic Reception
## 
### DOUG SMITH 
The Borodin Quartet, billed as
Russia's finest string quartet,
played to a moderately-sized
enthusiastic audience at
Dinkelspiel last Sunday afternoon.
Since their specialty is music of
Russian composers it is especially
unfortunate that this reviewer
neglected to set his watch ahead
Saturday night. The quartet
played Prokofiev (his second, Op.
92) first, and according to the
consensus at intermission it was
their best piece of the concert.
I arrived just in time for the
second offering. Five Short Pieces,
Op. 5, by Anton Webem. This is
music which demands the utmost
precision of ensemble, and the
demand was easily met by the
four Russians. The pieces are
alternately taut and nervous, soft
and pensive, animated, ethereal,
and sonorous.
They received an intense
performance which was rewarded

by a storm of applause. Normally
atonal music is only politely
received, but the Borodin's
interpretation apparently
convinced the audience that
Webern really is as good as the
musicologists say he is.
Mozart's Adagio and Fugue, K.
546, was given the same heavy,
intense treatment as the Webern
pieces, which I thought was
inappropriate. The fugue subject
was here presented with powerful
down-bows, and the string tone in
general was strident. To be sure, it
is a dark and brooding work, but
Mozart brooded in Vienna, not in
Moscow.
After intermission the quartet
returned with Brahms' Quartet
Op. 67 in B flat. Here again was a
very serious interpretation; they
even took Brahms' humor
seriously. And again the tone
produced was precise and almost
harsh, rather than lush and
sonorous as we are used to hearing

in works by romantic composers.
On the plus side, the Borodin
Quartet exhibited magnificent
control in ensemble and unerring
accuracy of intonation, even in
octave passages.
As the audience filed out I
overheard a lady with a Slavic
accent maintain "They're the best
quartet in the world, as far as I'm
concerned."
Well they were very good, but
you would have to be Russian to
say that.
