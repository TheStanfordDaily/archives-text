# Ehrlichman Knew Of Ellsberg File Theft
## 
### Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES — Newly resigned
presidential aide John D. Ehrlichman
told the FBI that he hired Watergate
conspirators G. Gordon Liddy and E.
Howard Hunt to investigate the
Pentagon papers case and learned later
they broke into the office of Daniel
Ellsberg's psychiatrist, it was disclosed
yesterday.
U.S. District Court Judge Matt
Byrne, presiding over the trial of
Ellsberg and Anthony Russo, revealed
the statement that Ehrlichman made
to the FBI last Friday.
The defense attorneys immediately
moved for dismissal of the case and
Byrne took the motion under
advisement.
Independent
The FBI interview quotes
Ehrlichman as saying President Nixon
designated him in 1971 "to make
inquiries independent of the
concurrent FBI investigation which
had been made relating to the leak of
the Pentagon papers."

Ellsberg was indicted in June, 1971,
on charges of espionage, conspiracy
and theft.
Ehrlichman told agents that Nixon
"had expressed interest in the problem
of unauthorized disclosures of
classified government information. .
The report added that, according to
Ehrlichman, "G. Gordon Liddy and E.
Howard Hunt were designated to
conduct the investigation."
No More
Ehrlichman told the FBI he learned
of the burglary afterward and told
Hunt and Liddy "not to do this
again."
Ehrlichman said he knew the two
men were traveling to California to
"follow up leads," including word that
"there was information available that
Ellsberg had emotional and moral
problems, and Liddy and Hunt sought
to determine full facts relating to these
conduct traits."
The report added, "Hunt
endeavored to prepare a "psychiatric
profile" relating to Ellsberg. The
efforts of Liddy and Hunt were
directed toward an 'in-depth
investigation of Ellsberg to determine
his habits, mental attitudes, motives,
etc.' "
"Such activity was not authorized
by him," the report says, he did not
know about this burglary until after it
happened, he 'did not agree with this
method of investigation' and when he
learned about the burglary he
instructed them 'not to do this
again.' "
The report adds that Ehrlichman
does not know if anything was
obtained from the psychiatrist's office,
and, presumably whether it was used
in the prosecution of Ellsberg and
Russo.
'Invasians'
Ellsberg's chief defense attorney,
Leonard Boudin, expressing outrage at
the revelation yesterday, called it "one
of the most extraordinary invasions of
individual privacy."
"If this kind of thing can be done
here and there is no deterrent so that
an advisor to the President will not do
this again," said Boudin, then the
administration of justice in this
country is lost."
Referring to the FBI report as "this
dreadful document," Boudin asked the
judge to immediately dismiss the
indictment against Ellsberg and Russo.
He said that jurors should be
summoned to the court and told "why
this indictment should be
d ismissed—the shame of the
government of the United States."
Byrne announced that he would
not let the case go to the jury until the
Watergate-connected matter is
resolved.
Order
He ordered the government to turn
over results of its continuing
investigation rapidly. Byrne said he
would keep the dismissal motion
under consideration pending results of
further government interviews.
The jury has heard four months of
testimony about the role of EHsberg
and Russo in copying the top secret
Pentagon Papers. The judge said he
would try to have the government
continue its rebuttal testimony while
the investigation continues.
He called jurors back to the
courtroom and they heard about a half
hour of testimony from a Rand Corp.

secretary. Byrne conceded that
testimony may soon have to be halted
while the investigation is carried out.
