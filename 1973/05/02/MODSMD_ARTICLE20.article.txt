# Ping-Pong Ace Swings Mean Paddle Against Frustrated 'Daily' Reporter
## SPORTS 
### LARRY FLEECE 
It did seem rather pretentious,
my playing ping-pong with the
Chuck Shackelford.
After all, Shackelford is the
number one player on the
Stanford table tennis team. The
team, organized this quarter by
Johni Chan of the Chinese
Students Association, is
apparently the first table tennis
team in Stanford history.
The team consists of eight
active players, and it will compete
regularly in the Bay Area Table
Tennis League. The league boasts
teams from the University of San
Francisco, University of California
Medical School, and San
Francisco State and City Colleges,
as well as four industrially
sponsored teams.
Shackelford is at the top of the
team ladder, followed by Bob
Shur, Johni Chan, and Edward
Lo.
So Shackelford and I squared
off over the table. This was the
same Chuck Shackelford who, as a
freshman, won the intercollegiate
regional singles title and qualified
to go to the national competition.
It was also the same Shackelford
who just last quarter took second
place in the regional singles
competition in San Luis Obispo,
and combined with Bob Shur to
win the doubles title. My knees
felt a bit weak.
No Paddle
"Did you bring your paddle?"
Shackelford asked.
"No, I ah ... I left it at home

today," I suggested feebly. I think
he smelled an amateur as he
handed me an extra paddle.
He began mercifully enough,
dinking the ball back gentle so as
not to bruise me. We could
converse at this pace, over the
steady rhythm of the ball. "The
eight-man teams in the league," he
was saying, "are divided into four
pairs, and each pair plays singles
and doubles against the
opponent's pair." I was
concentrating on returning the
ball.

"We've played three practice
matches so far," Shackelford went
on. "Even though we're just
getting organized, we beat two
USF teams, 11-5 and 11-6, and we
beat the SF State team 13-7.
"We're really a very strong
student team," Shackelford said.
"Some of the industrial teams pull
in players from table tennis clubs,
you know."(I didn't even know
there were table tennis clubs, but
I decided against telling
Shackelford.) "Like Pacific, Gas
and Electric," he said, "has David
Chan playing for them, and he's
probably the best player in the
Bay Area."
But I tired of so much idle
talk, and when I saw my chance, I
laced a shot off the corner and

past Shackelford's paddle. "I see
you've played this game before,"
Shackelford said with a small grin
through his beard as he retrieved
the ball.
The Game Begins
"Do you want to play a game
— just to see what happens?" he
asked. I suspected I knew what
would happen, but I consented.
I served first, and won a couple
of points. As I did, I saw the
banner headlines in the Daily:
'Upstart Reporter Tops Ex-Pong
Champ.'

But then it was his serve. He
took the ball, flat in the palm of
his hand, and tossed it straight up
about two feet in the air. Then he
dropped his body behind the ball,
virtually to his knees, and cut
around the ball with his paddle.
The ball came straight to me, but
when I tried to return it, the ball
took off at an oblique angle,
sideways, with a mind of its own,
completely ignoring my intent.
"I see," I said, though I didn't.
Shackelford continued to
writhe and contort behind the ball
as he served, and each time the
ball would decide to do something
new and creative when I tried to
return it. My shots were going off
windows, trash cans, Pepsi
machines — anything in the room
but the green table in front of me.
In between lashings,
Shackelford explained the method

to his madness. "With the
invention of these
smooth-surfaced 'sponge'
paddles," he said, brandishing his
weapon, "table tennis has become
a game of spin. It used to be that
a steady defense would win this
game, but now it takes a strong
offense and good spin shots. This
is the kind of game the great
Chinese players have developed,
and it's why they win.
"The real line of distinction
among table tennis players
today," Shackelford said, "is in
their ability to read the spin of
their opponent's shots."
I considered telling
Shackelford that I couldn't read
Chinese, but I suspected it was a
weak excuse. Another lame return
of mine rolled under the sofa in a
distant corner of the room.
"Here, let me show you what I
mean about reading your
opponent's spin. Hit me a chop,"
Shackelford said.
I chopped him my meanest
chop, which is a shot with
backspin to keep it low on the
table. Shackelford pulled his
paddle hard across the back of the
ball, following through high as if
he were hailing a taxi.
The ball came back slowly to
my side of the table, but when it
hit, it took a huge bounce over
my shoulder. "That's called a
loop," Shackelford said. "When I
cut a loop, it accentuates the spin
of your chop, and gives it that
high hop when it comes back to
you."
"Oh," I said. And I thought
table tennis was just ping-pong.

ball.

"We've played three practice
matches so far," Shackelford went
on. "Even though we're just
getting organized, we beat two
USF teams, 11-5 and 11-6, and we
beat the SF State team 13-7.
"We're really a very strong
student team," Shackelford said.
"Some of the industrial teams pull
in players from table tennis clubs,
you know."(I didn't even know
there were table tennis clubs, but
I decided against telling
Shackelford.) "Like Pacific, Gas
and Electric," he said, "has David
Chan playing for them, and he's
probably the best player in the
Bay Area."
But I tired of so much idle
talk, and when I saw my chance, I
laced a shot off the corner and

past Shackelford's paddle. "I see
you've played this game before,"
Shackelford said with a small grin
through his beard as he retrieved
the ball.
The Game Begins
"Do you want to play a game
— just to see what happens?" he
asked. I suspected I knew what
would happen, but I consented.
I served first, and won a couple
of points. As I did, I saw the
banner headlines in the Daily:
'Upstart Reporter Tops Ex-Pong
Champ.'

But then it was his serve. He
took the ball, flat in the palm of
his hand, and tossed it straight up
about two feet in the air. Then he
dropped his body behind the ball,
virtually to his knees, and cut
around the ball with his paddle.
The ball came straight to me, but
when I tried to return it, the ball
took off at an oblique angle,
sideways, with a mind of its own,
completely ignoring my intent.
"I see," I said, though I didn't.
Shackelford continued to
writhe and contort behind the ball
as he served, and each time the
ball would decide to do something
new and creative when I tried to
return it. My shots were going off
windows, trash cans, Pepsi
machines — anything in the room
but the green table in front of me.
In between lashings,
Shackelford explained the method

to his madness. "With the
invention of these
smooth-surfaced 'sponge'
paddles," he said, brandishing his
weapon, "table tennis has become
a game of spin. It used to be that
a steady defense would win this
game, but now it takes a strong
offense and good spin shots. This
is the kind of game the great
Chinese players have developed,
and it's why they win.
"The real line of distinction
among table tennis players
today," Shackelford said, "is in
their ability to read the spin of
their opponent's shots."
I considered telling
Shackelford that I couldn't read
Chinese, but I suspected it was a
weak excuse. Another lame return
of mine rolled under the sofa in a
distant corner of the room.
"Here, let me show you what I
mean about reading your
opponent's spin. Hit me a chop,"
Shackelford said.
I chopped him my meanest
chop, which is a shot with
backspin to keep it low on the
table. Shackelford pulled his
paddle hard across the back of the
ball, following through high as if
he were hailing a taxi.
The ball came back slowly to
my side of the table, but when it
hit, it took a huge bounce over
my shoulder. "That's called a
loop," Shackelford said. "When I
cut a loop, it accentuates the spin
of your chop, and gives it that
high hop when it comes back to
you."
"Oh," I said. And I thought
table tennis was just ping-pong.

TABLE TENNIS TERROR—Law student Chuck Shackelford displays the form that has made him the
number-one player on Stanford's newly formed ping-pong team. Shackelford, who as a freshman won the
intercollegiate regional singles title, last quarter placed second in regional amateur competition at San Luis
Obispo and teamed with Bob Shur to win the doubles crown.
It did seem rather pretentious,
my playing ping-pong with the
Chuck Shackelford.
After all, Shackelford is the
number one player on the
Stanford table tennis team. The
team, organized this quarter by
Johni Chan of the Chinese
Students Association, is
apparently the first table tennis
team in Stanford history.
The team consists of eight
active players, and it will compete
regularly in the Bay Area Table
Tennis League. The league boasts
teams from the University of San
Francisco, University of California
Medical School, and San
Francisco State and City Colleges,
as well as four industrially
sponsored teams.
Shackelford is at the top of the
team ladder, followed by Bob
Shur, Johni Chan, and Edward
Lo.
So Shackelford and I squared
off over the table. This was the
same Chuck Shackelford who, as a
freshman, won the intercollegiate
regional singles title and qualified
to go to the national competition.
It was also the same Shackelford
who just last quarter took second
place in the regional singles
competition in San Luis Obispo,
and combined with Bob Shur to
win the doubles title. My knees
felt a bit weak.
No Paddle
"Did you bring your paddle?"
Shackelford asked.
"No, I ah ... I left it at home

today," I suggested feebly. I think
he smelled an amateur as he
handed me an extra paddle.
He began mercifully enough,
dinking the ball back gentle so as
not to bruise me. We could
converse at this pace, over the
steady rhythm of the ball. "The
eight-man teams in the league," he
was saying, "are divided into four
pairs, and each pair plays singles
and doubles against the
opponent's pair." I was
concentrating on returning the
ball.

"We've played three practice

Shackelford continued to
writhe and contort behind the ball
as he served, and each time the
ball would decide to do something
new and creative when I tried to
return it. My shots were going off
windows, trash cans, Pepsi
machines — anything in the room
but the green table in front of me.
In between lashings,
Shackelford explained the method

to his madness. "With the
invention of these
smooth-surfaced 'sponge'
paddles," he said, brandishing his
weapon, "table tennis has become
a game of spin. It used to be that
a steady defense would win this
game, but now it takes a strong
offense and good spin shots. This
is the kind of game the great
Chinese players have developed,
and it's why they win.
"The real line of distinction
among table tennis players
today," Shackelford said, "is in
their ability to read the spin of
their opponent's shots."
I considered telling
Shackelford that I couldn't read
Chinese, but I suspected it was a
weak excuse. Another lame return
of mine rolled under the sofa in a
distant corner of the room.
"Here, let me show you what I
mean about reading your
opponent's spin. Hit me a chop,"
Shackelford said.
I chopped him my meanest
chop, which is a shot with
backspin to keep it low on the
table. Shackelford pulled his
paddle hard across the back of the
ball, following through high as if
he were hailing a taxi.
The ball came back slowly to
my side of the table, but when it
hit, it took a huge bounce over
my shoulder. "That's called a
loop," Shackelford said. "When I
cut a loop, it accentuates the spin
of your chop, and gives it that
high hop when it comes back to
you."
"Oh," I said. And I thought
table tennis was just ping-pong.

TABLE TENNIS TERROR—Law student Chuck Shackelford displays the form that has made him the
number-one player on Stanford's newly formed ping-pong team. Shackelford, who as a freshman won the
intercollegiate regional singles title, last quarter placed second in regional amateur competition at San Luis
Obispo and teamed with Bob Shur to win the doubles crown.
It did seem rather pretentious,
my playing ping-pong with the
Chuck Shackelford.
After all, Shackelford is the
number one player on the
Stanford table tennis team. The
team, organized this quarter by
Johni Chan of the Chinese
Students Association, is
apparently the first table tennis
team in Stanford history.
The team consists of eight
active players, and it will compete
regularly in the Bay Area Table
Tennis League. The league boasts
teams from the University of San
Francisco, University of California
Medical School, and San
Francisco State and City Colleges,
as well as four industrially
sponsored teams.
Shackelford is at the top of the
team ladder, followed by Bob
Shur, Johni Chan, and Edward
Lo.
So Shackelford and I squared
off over the table. This was the
same Chuck Shackelford who, as a
freshman, won the intercollegiate
regional singles title and qualified
to go to the national competition.
It was also the same Shackelford
who just last quarter took second
place in the regional singles
competition in San Luis Obispo,
and combined with Bob Shur to
win the doubles title. My knees
felt a bit weak.
No Paddle
"Did you bring your paddle?"
Shackelford asked.
"No, I ah ... I left it at home

today," I suggested feebly. I think
he smelled an amateur as he
handed me an extra paddle.
He began mercifully enough,
dinking the ball back gentle so as
not to bruise me. We could
converse at this pace, over the
steady rhythm of the ball. "The
eight-man teams in the league," he
was saying, "are divided into four
pairs, and each pair plays singles
and doubles against the
opponent's pair." I was
concentrating on returning the
ball.

"We've played three practice
matches so far," Shackelford went
on. "Even though we're just
getting organized, we beat two
USF teams, 11-5 and 11-6, and we
beat the SF State team 13-7.
"We're really a very strong
student team," Shackelford said.
"Some of the industrial teams pull
in players from table tennis clubs,
you know."(I didn't even know
there were table tennis clubs, but
I decided against telling
Shackelford.) "Like Pacific, Gas
and Electric," he said, "has David
Chan playing for them, and he's
probably the best player in the
Bay Area."
But I tired of so much idle
talk, and when I saw my chance, I
laced a shot off the corner and

past Shackelford's paddle. "I see
you've played this game before,"
Shackelford said with a small grin
through his beard as he retrieved
the ball.
The Game Begins
"Do you want to play a game
— just to see what happens?" he
asked. I suspected I knew what
would happen, but I consented.
I served first, and won a couple
of points. As I did, I saw the
banner headlines in the Daily:
'Upstart Reporter Tops Ex-Pong
Champ.'

But then it was his serve. He
took the ball, flat in the palm of
his hand, and tossed it straight up
about two feet in the air. Then he
dropped his body behind the ball,
virtually to his knees, and cut
around the ball with his paddle.
The ball came straight to me, but
when I tried to return it, the ball
took off at an oblique angle,
sideways, with a mind of its own,
completely ignoring my intent.
"I see," I said, though I didn't.
Shackelford continued to
writhe and contort behind the ball
as he served, and each time the
ball would decide to do something
new and creative when I tried to
