# High School Prodigy Making Strong Comeback
## Unassuming Curl Seeks Sprint Success 
### MARK WHITE 
He is articulate, speaking with
unassuming clarity, but describes
himself as "just another student
who happens to run track." He
has held and holds several records,
including two national age group
marks.
His fastest time was recorded
in 1968, when he was 15 years
old. Since then he has suffered
seven severe hamstring pulls, but
has come back from each to
compete again. In a matter of a
few months he gained 40 pounds,
and then shed them in 30 days.
He went to the 1972 Olympic
trials in an event which is only his
second best. Of the 110 schools
that recruited him in high school,
he chose Stanford because, among
other things, he liked its
"nonchalant atmosphere."
Who is this guy? He is easily
one of the finest athletes
attending Stanford today. His
name is Ken Curl, Stanford's top
sprinter, but looking at him you
would never guess that he has
competed against and defeated
world class athletes. He does not
talk like nor have the demeanor of
the archetype jock/stud. His
quiet, level manner belies the fact
that he is a pre-med.
His coach, Payton Jordan,
himself an excellent sprinter,
describes him as a "gifted athlete
with a fine attitude." And after
three long years of overcoming
injuries, both Jordan and Curl feel
that he is rounding into the
physical shape he was in when he

ran a 9.3 100 yards to set an
American age group record as a
sophomore in high school.
'Best Shape'
1 think Ken is in the best
shape, physically and mentally, he
has been in since coming to
Stanford," said Jordan of the
talented junior. "He is healthier,
more confident, and more
consistent. While some people
would like to see him run even
faster, I think he has lived up to
what he is capable of, if not
exceeding it. I am confident he
will run 9.3 or better in the near
future."
Curl has learned much on the
long road back. "You learn a lot
about people in track, both in
success and when you're down. It
all started when I ran a 9.8
hundred in junior high. From that
point until my senior year in high
school, people were praising me
and patting me on the back. Then

when I pulled a hamstring in a
relay during the fall of 1969 and
was forced to sit out the track
season, the same people told me I
was washed up.
"But for the most part I've
really enjoyed the people I've met
in track. I've made a lot of friends
and I've done things with people I
would have never done without
track. I have run track for 12
years and there is no amount of
money I'd take as a trade-in."
Ken learned much about
himself in the process also. "When
you get a slight pull in one leg,
you often compensate for it by
putting extra stress on the other
leg. In my case, this led directly to
several more pulls. After a while
when you step out on the track,
you hold back because you don't
want to pull it again. And then
you develop a mental block about
running; you don't train as hard
and you don't run as hard in the

meets.
"Thanks to Coach Jordan and
his weight program, I'm in the
best shape I've been in in three
years. I can feel myself coming
back to that point where I know
I'm capable of really good times."
Ken's double victory over
strong USC sprinters 10 days ago
is representative of the steady
progress he has made since coming
to Stanford. Last year he gained
momentum towards the end of
the season and clocked a 9.4 on
his way to a sixth place in the
Pac-8. That mark qualified him
for the 1972 Olympic trials,
which he fondly looks back upon
as "the greatest gathering of
athletes I've been to.
"As soon as I arrived in Eugene
I went into a daze," he recalls.
"Here were all these great athletes
and none of them were boasting.
It was like a think tank; everyone
was concentrating.
Roomed With Robinson
"I roomed with Ray Robinson,
the man who missed his heat in
Munich. I never met anybody like
Ray — he knew he was going to
the Olympics; he couldn't lose. It
just so happened we ran in the
same 100 meter qualifying
heat. He won in 10.0 and I came

in 10.2 — last. Boy, that was some
heat."
Curl's goal is a 9.3 or a 9.2 100
yards this season and a place in
both the Pac-8 and AAU meets,
preferably first. "If I'm in the top
three at the AAU's, then I'll
qualify for the seven-country tour
to Europe, which I would really
like to be in on. However, if I
don't place I'm going to be in a
lot of trouble with my friends."
Amazingly, the 100 is probably
not Ken's best event. "All the
coaches I know well tell me my
event is the 440. Right now I
hesitate from abandoning the
sprints, because the transition
would be very difficult.
"Right now I still think like a
sprinter, but the 46.7 440 I ran in
the 10th grade tells me I should
be running the quarter. When
John Anderson leaves this year, I
may be forced into running both
sprints and the quarter next
season. When I think about the
devotion those middle-distance
guys show in practice, I have
nothing but respect for them."
"Yes" says Jordan. "I think
Ken has great potential in the
quarter. He rises to the occasion,
he's a good competitor. Watch
him in the next few weeks."

Curl, who won the 100 in 9.6 and the 220 in 21.3 against the Trojans,
will compete in the same two events this Saturday at Stanford
Stadium in the Big Meet against California.
