# Stanford Sophomore Wins Karate Tourney
## 
### 
Neal Scott's performance in
the open kumite (free fighting)
division highlighted Stanford's team
effort in the Northern California
intercollegiate Karate Tournament
held Sunday at USF.
The sophomore captain won
four straight elimination matches
to capture the first place trophy
over 12 competitors. Senior James
Pierce finished third in the same
divsion, missing the runnerup
slot by a hair. He was beaten in
the final seconds of an overtime
consolation round.
The AAKF tournament,
sponsored by the USF Karate
Club, was abbreviated by the
failure of three of the expected
teams to show up on Sunday
morning due to the daylight

savings time change. The round
robin finals of the undergraduate
team competitions began
immediately, however, and the
Stanford contingent took second
place in both team kumite and
team /eata (forms). Besides Scott
and Pierce, Stanford was
represented by junior John Prosise
and sophomore Ted Albert.
In addition to the
competitions, there were
demonstrations of advanced
karate skills by several prominent
Bay Area instructors, including
one of karate against sword by
tournament director Kenichi
Haramoto.
About 300 spectators watched
the event at USF's Memorial
Gym.
