# Santa Clara Dims JV Title Hopes
## Baseball Team Beats UOP 
### 
Stanford used one of its most complete
performances of the season yesterday to defeat
University of Pacific, 6-0, in a non-league baseball
game played at Lodi, Calif.
Starting pitcher Dave Frost faced only 21 batters
in his seven inning stint. Only three UOP runners
reached base (one on a base hit and two on walks),
but all three runners were erased on double plays.
Dan Shaw pitched the final two frames to save the
victory, Frosts fourth against no losses.
Offensively Bob Hampton, Bob Reece, and Dave
Baker sparked a 17-hit performance. Hampton
homered in the second and added two hits later in
the game in a three-for-five outing. Reece was also
three-for-five while Baker drove in three runs on
two hits.
In a junior varsity game at Santa Clara yesterday,
Stanford saw its hopes for a Bay Area Collegiate
League championship all but vanish in the fifth
inning as the Broncos edged the Cards, 4-3.
Stanford led 1-0 going into the fifth inning of the
scheduled seven inning contest, but with two out
and a runner on second, the Broncos battered Card
pitcher Jim Dudley for four straight hits and four
runs. Stanford came back in the sixth when Dean
Morris smashed a two run homer, but Santa Clara

hung on for a 4-3 victory.
The loss dropped Stanford's league record to
15-8 while the Broncos improved their conference
mark to 16-5 and clinched at least a tie for the
league title.
Stanford and California (106) are still
mathematically in contention, but it would take a
Cardinal victory tomorrow at Santa Clara in
Stanford's last game of the season to give the Cards
any chance for the title.
Even then, however, a Stanford tie seems
unlikely. Cal would have to if Santa Clara in the
two remaining games bet;, en those two teams and
the Bears would also have to lose at least twice to
other opponents.
