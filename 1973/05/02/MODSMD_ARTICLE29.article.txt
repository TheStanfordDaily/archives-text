Nixon Asks $2.9 Billion
WASHINGTON — President Nixon asked Congress
yesterday for $2.9 billion in foreign aid to friendly
nations, including $632 million to rebuild
Indochina.
The package included no money for North
Vietnam, but Nixon said the Communist country
would be eligible for U.S. help when it complies
fully with the Vietnam cease-fire agreement.
"If and when that occurs," he said, "I believe
that American assistance for reconstruction and
development of both South and North Vietnam
would represent a sound investment in confirming
the peace."
His proposal includes $652 million in military
assistance and another $100 million for Jordan,
Thailand and other countries considered especially
close to the United States. Some $33 million would
also be spent to train foreign soldiers here.
The $2.9 billion requested for fiscal year 1974
contrasts with the $2.6-billion foreign aid program
that has been in effect under a continuing
congressional resolution for nearly two years.
"The sums I am requesting represent the absolute
minimum prudent investment which the United
States can afford to make if we wish to create a
peaceful world," Nixon said in his message.
A special feature of the new assistance program is
the singling out of South Vietnam, Laos and
Cambodia for economic reconstruction aid.
Crash Blamed On Controller
MOUNTAIN VIEW — Officials yesterday blamed
the April 12 collision of a Navy plane and space
agency jet on a flight controller who told both
pilots to land on the same Moffett Field runway.
Sixteen persons were killed when the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration Convair 990
and Navy P3C crashed piggyback on a golf course
green 100 yards from busy U.S. 101.
"It was the tower operator's intention to land the
Convair 990 on runway 32 right, but he mistakenly
called the wrong runway," a statement by the joint
Navy-NASA investigative board said.
"There is no evidence that either pilots or tower
personnel were aware of the impending collision."
Air Controller IC. R.J. Sprinkle has been
"temporarily relieved of his duties without
prejudice pending a review in Washington, D.C." of
the board's findings, the statement said.
Lakers 115, Knieks 112
LOS ANGELES — The Los Angeles Lakers built a
20-point lead and then barely hung on for a
115-112 victory over the New York Knicks last
night in the opener of their best-of-7 playoff series
for the National Basketball Association
championship.
Sadat Attacks U.S.-Israel Ties
CAIRO — President Anwar Sadat of Egypt charged
yesterday that the United States backs Israeli
domination of the Middle East out of concern over
Arab oil and the energy crisis.

He assailed U.S. peace plans for the Middle East
and pleaded for Soviet support for the Arabs in
what he repeated is an "inevitable" confrontation
with Israel.
Sadat declared in his 90-minute speech that
Washington has an interest in maintaining Israel's
strength because the Arabs control more than half
the world's known oil reserves, and "we know there
is an energy crisis in the United States."
"If need be, the Americans would come and
occupy the sources of energy in the Arab world," he
added, "so we know why Israel is being supported
by the United States."
This appeared to imply a charge that the United
States would be prepared to invade Arab countries
and grab their oil fields if the U.S. oil shortage
demanded it. But the Egyptian president did not
specifically make that accusation, nor did he say
why U.S. oil needs would not dictate friendship
with the oil-rich Arabs rather than hostility against
them.
Premier Golda Meir of Israel told students at
Hebrew University that should the war break out
again as Sadat seemed to be predicting, "There is no
doubt what the result would be."
Sabotage Seen In Train Blast
SACRAMENTO — A saboteur or a friction-caused
fire ignited by loosely packed bombs could have
blown up a Southern Pacific munitions train near
Roseville Saturday, spokesmen said yesterday.
Sabotage is "a possibility. If someone wanted to
set fire to it he could have stuck the right kind of
material up through the wooden floor of the
boxcar," said William F. Black, chief of the
hazardous material branch of the federal railroad
administration.
But Southern Pacific spokesman Andrew
Anderson said sabotage is only one of a multitude
of possible causes of the blasts that injured 52
persons and caused millions of dollars in damage.
"What exists is a whole lot of remote possibilities,
including the one that happened," Anderson said in
an interview.
Another possibility is friction and heat — enough
to cause a fire — if the 250-pound bombs were
packed loosely enough to allow them to rock gently
inside one of the 21 munitions cars on the way into
the Roseville switching yard, Anderson said.
Southern Pacific trainmen said they spotted smoke
coming from one of the munitions cars before the
explosions.
Anderson said bulkheads dividing the bomb
pallets were made of wood and could have been
ignited after a period of rubbing, much as a Boy
Scout rubs two sticks together to start a campfire.
"There is wood inside and some sort of friction
could have developed," Anderson said.
The infrared "hotbox" detector which checked
the train 45 minutes before the explosions is aimed
at wheel housings and might not have detected heat
higher up in the car, he added.
A Navy investigating team is probing what
procedures were used to load the 7000 bombs, said

Capt. Gary Hawksworth, an information officer at
McClellan Air Force base near the blast site.
Meanwhile, an employee of Western Pacific
Railroad Co. said similar munition shipments are
frequently routed through a heavily populated
Sacramento area less than three miles from the
fragile state Capitol.
A 20-car munitions shipment had been held
Sunday in the Western Pacific yards less than 100
yards from the Sacramento City College campus but
was moved out Monday, the employee added. He
declined to be identified.
Court Upholds Topless Ban
SAN FRANCISCO — Local ordinances prohibiting
topless and bottomless waitresses and entertainers in
bars and restaurants are constitutional and a proper
exercise of police powers, the California Supreme
Court ruled yesterday.
The decision said all local governments have the
right to bar topless women and bottomless women
and men from working where food or alcoholic
beverages are sold or from participating in live acts
or exhibitions in any public place except
theater-type establishments.
Dave Rosenberg, spokesman for six nightclubs in
the city's North Beach area, said. "We'll continue to
have shows as before. It is so ridiculous that 'Deep
Throat' can go on while they do this to us."
The challenge to the ordinances claimed nude
entertainment is communicative and therefore a
form of speech and that topless waitresses as well as
topless or bottomless dancers are entertainment.
Calling food and beverage serving a commercial
activity, the decision said:
"Such business conduct does not become
symbolic and thus communicative in the
constitutional sense because it occurs in topless or
bottomless fashion. Such nude activity is nothing
more than a commercial exhibition designed to
stimulate the customer and promote sales. On the
contrary, these regulatory provisions are a proper
exercise of the police power.
"Topless waitresses who mingle with customers
may stimulate breaches of the peace among a bar's
largely male cliente'e."
The 47-page 4-2 majority opinion by Justice
Raymond Sullivan involved ordinances in Orange
and Sacramento counties and the city of
Sacramento. Justice Mathew O. Tobriner authored a
30-page dissent. Justice William Clark Jr. was not on
the court when the matter was argued and did not
participate.
Such ordinances don't prohibit entertainment,
but merely require the performers to "have some
clothes on," the court said.
Today's Weather
Overcast night and morning but sunny over most of
the area in afternoons through tomorrow. Chance of
drizzle tonight and early tomorrow. Continued cool.
Low temperatures both nights in the mid 40s to low
50s. High today and tomorrow in the upper 50s to
upper 60s. Westerly winds 10 to 20 mph.
