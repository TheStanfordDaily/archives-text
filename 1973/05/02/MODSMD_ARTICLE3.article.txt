# Liquor Authority Probes Frat

California's Alcoholic Beverage
Commission (ABC) is investigating
fraternity Phi Delta Theta to see if a
rush party two weeks ago violated
state liquor laws.
The party, which featured five nude
dancers, an open bar, and the raffling
off of one of the dancers, is already
under investigation by University
officials.
Charles Bucher, an ABC spokesman,
said his office had assigned two
investigators to look into the
fraternity party after newspaper
reports indicated minors attended the
party.
Investigating
"The incident is under

investigation," Bucher told the Daily.
He refused to explain the exact nature
of the investigation but pointed out:
"The law states that no one can
exercise the privileges of a [liquor]
licensee without having a license." The
Phi Delt party was unlicensed.
ABC agents spoke to Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyon and
Associate Dean Larry Horton Tuesday,
as well as members of the fraternity.
"Their investigation is still going
on," Horton said. "They didn't say
anything about any punishment. ..
they couldn't really do that. They
were merely seeking facts."
Not Pleasant
Horton said he had no idea if the

ABC was planning action against the
fraternity. "The notion of
investigators on campus is not pleasant
to anybody, but I think we'll have to
let them think for themselves... It is
crystal clear to me that Stanford is not
a sanctuary from any kind of law. We
have made no agreements of any kind
with law enforcement officials about
non-prosecution."
Bob Major, Phi Delt president, was
unavailable for comment last night,
but one house member said Major
refused to speak with ABC
investigators "unless they could show
him a subpoena."
A number of fraternities indicated
yesterday that they never obtained
liquor licenses for their parties. "I've
never checked into those things, and I
doubt if anyone else in the house has,"
Dan Dowers, former social chairman
of Sigma Alpha Epsilon. He also said
the frat made no attempt to screen out
minors.
"All we try to restrict is people
from outside the house," Dowers said.
Steve Recht, treasurer of Kappa
Sigma, said "I guess there's a
prohibition against not having a
license" but the house never applies
for one. He added there were no
restrictions on serving minors, either.
A source at Beta Theta Pi, sponsor
of periodic campus-wide "nooners"
featuring 15 or 20 kegs of beer, said
the license question "has never come
up."
"Stanford has never had any
problems," he told the Daily. "I'm
sure the ABC knows what's going on. I
don't believe any place on campus has
a liquor license.
"Check any dorm or any frat on
campus and it's in violation of the
liquor law," he added.
