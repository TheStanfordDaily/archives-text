# Lyman Will Not Enter SCIRE Controversy
## 
### CHESS ERWIN 
President Richard Lyman said last
night he would not intervene in the
decision of Dean James Gibbs to fire
SCIRE director Ron Jones.
The main issue in the SCIRE
controversy, Lyman added on KZSU,
is not Jones' dismissal. "What is
important is whether Jones sees
himself as strictly an innovator or as a
reviewer |of SCIRE] too," he said.
"People are all too ready to scrap
the entire structure of SCIRE without
considering what must be done. This
situation has reflected badly on Dean
Gibbs. Frankly, I am weary of
discussing the situation further at this
time," he continued.
When considering the effectiveness
of either SWOPSI or SCIRE, Lyman
emphasized that there is a "need for
balance of responsibility between the
faculty and students to maintain the
credibility of the University to the
outside world."
Rather than criticizing the SCIRE
structure, it would be wiser to
encourage more responsible faculty
sponsorships and to deemphasize the
importance of credit to SCIRE
projects, Lyman added. "All too
often, if academic credit is not give to

a SCIRE program, it is abandoned as if
it were damned."
Academic freedom entails
responsibility from all parties rather
than just pointless discussions on the
merits of innovation versus control,
said Lyman. "Whatever happens, we
must not tighten the noose around
SCIRE or SWOPSI in the name of
academic regulation," he concluded.
Lyman expressed sympathy with
the outrage of some female students at
the raffling off of a stripper at Phi
Delta Theta. "The sale of sex by
members of the community can in no
way be rationalized. This is very
troublesome because it reflects badly
on the image of the University,"
Lyman said.
Lyman attributed the temporary
removal of the language requirement
at the German overseas campus to
circumstances beyond anyone's
control. He deemed the situation "not
good" but added that he saw no
reason why this would affect the
German campus adversely.
Going overseas "should not require
this kind of enticement" but, he
concluded that the experiment would
probably help to alleviate the present
problem there.
