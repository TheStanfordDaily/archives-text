# Motion Denied
## 
### 
The judge in the murder-assault
trial of Andrea Holman Burt and
Benton Douglas Burt has denied a
defense motion to dismiss charges
in the case.
San Bernardino County
Superior Court Judge Thomas
Haldorsen ruled that it would not
be in the interests of justice to
drop the charges. But he criticized
the prosecution's handling of a
witness's report.
The Burts are charged with
murder, assault and lynching in
connection with the October,
1972 escape of Chino prisoner
Ronald Wayne Beaty.
