# Harvey Files Grievance Petition
## 
### CHESS ERWIN 
Children's Hospital employee Julia Harvey has
filed a grievance petition with the University and
arbitration action is expected shortly, according to
Emil Sarpa, University Director of Personnel.
Obtaining an outside arbitrator will take
approximately two weeks and a final decision will
not be delivered until two or three weeks after his
selection.
Sarpa refuses to comment on the grievance.
According to United Stanford Employees
spokesman Jack Truher, the University has given
tacit approval to Pediatrics Department Chairman
Irving Schulman's refusal to accept the funds which
would allow Harvey to stay on at her job at the
Hospital by requesting outside arbitration.
The controversy stems from Harvey's discovery in
January that she would be laid off on March 31
unless she accepted a 33 percent pay cut and loss of
the University pension benefits by moving from the
University payroll to that of the Children's Hospital.

Subsequently, Harvey's immediate supervisor,
Biochemistry Prof. William Robertson, suggested
that income accrued from the clinical operations of
the lab in which Harvey worked be used to maintain
her in her previous job.
However, Schulman, who came here seven
months ago, insisted that funds generated by the
Children's Hospital could not be transferred to the
University for employee salaries. Although
Children's Hospital Director M.H. Jennison had
approved the fund transfer, Harvey was laid off on
March 31 and is now without an income, she claims.
Robertson said he hopes Harvey's grievance is
resolved satisfactorily, but added that he "really
didn't know what would result from the arbitration
proceedings."
Schulman refused to comment on the matter
yesterday.
According to Jennison, sufficient funds are
available to "justify her [Harvey's] employment."
He speculated that the University may modify its

position on insurance and pension benefits if she is
rehired.
Harvey said she initiated her grievance
proceedings over the general issue of job security
and over the guidelines used by the University in
determining which employees it will lay off.
She added that although she agreed in principle
with many of Schulman's feelings about the need
for improved patient care and less emphasis upon
research, Schulman had been "insensitive to human
needs" and overly "hard-nosed" in implementing
these priorities.
Looking beyond arbitration, Harvey said she was
still uncertain about her future plans. She added
that she felt compelled to dramatize her situation to
awaken the community to her plight.
Truher said USE was interested in the Harvey
case for a number of reasons, including a general
concern about the treatment of older University
workers.
