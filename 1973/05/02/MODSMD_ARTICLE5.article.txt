# Stanford Starts $83 Million Building Program
## 
### BILL WEINSTEIN First Of Two Parts 
The University is embarking on a
major 10-year, $83 million building
program that will permanently alter
the makeup of the campus, according
to Edward E. Shaw, executive assistant
to the Vice President and Provost.
The construction is part of the goal
of achieving a "Dynamic Steady
State" here, and is being partially
financed by the $300 Million
Campaign for Stanford fund drive.
"The Dynamic Steady State,"
defined by Shaw as "no significant
increase in the size of the faculty,
staff, or students," and the other
planning priority, making the Quad
the focal point of campus academic
activity, are the two "assumptions"
that will guide the University's growth
in the next 10 years.
"Ten years from today," Shaw said,
"Stanford will not expand its physical
plant. Hopefully it will be changing
but not growing in the sense of
physical facilities." Shaw said that one
of the chief goals of the program is to
consolidate each department into a
single area.
Same Style
The new structures will generally
follow the University sandstone and
red tile style, but will have some bold
architectural innovations such as a
multi-terraced addition to the main
library.
While the overall planning has been
concluded, the actual blueprints for
many of the buildings have not yet
been completed. "To say there is a
plan is to say too much," he noted.

"To say there are no ideas is too
little."
Buildings are already being
constructed or are in the planning
stages include a new Medical
Center-Hospital expansion, a Main
Library expansion, stadium
renovations, a new chemistry building,
a Medical School Center for
Neuro-Sciences, improvements of
Encina Hall, and a new Engineering
Department building.
In addition, a Stanford Solar
Observatory, a possible new Music
school, Frost Amphitheater
improvements, a research park, and a
ccntral telephone exchange will be
constructed. The University is already
erecting the new Law School, the
Outdoor Primate Center, the
Escondido Multipurpose Building, and
the Athletics Stage II swimming,
squash, and handball complex.
In conjunction with the building
program is the construction of a new
network of roads that will change
campus traffic patterns radically.
Oscar Nelson, Master Planner for the
University, says that ultimately
Campus Drive will be extended to
surround the entire University.
Mayfield Avenue will be connected
to Campus Drive and a new road near
the Stanford Golf Course and parallel
to Los Arboles Street will link
Mayfield to the other part of Campus
Drive near the Medical Center.
Feeder Roads
Feeder roads will link Stanford with
outside communities and many streets
near the Quad will be converted into
pedestrian malls or parking areas.

As part of this new network, Quarry
road will be extended to connect the
Stanford Barn and Shopping Center to
Campus Drive. In addition Campus
Drive will be rerouted and a new
stretch of road in the Row House area
will connect Lane W to Alvarado Row.
As part of this plan Stillman house will
be relocated next to Lathrop House
and across the street from Beta Theta
Pi.
Serra Street in front of the Math
Corner and Law School will be
converted into a mall as will Galvez
Street between the new proposed Main
Library addition and Encina Hall and
Crothers Memorial Hall.
The present Campus Drive between
Alvarado and Lasuen will be
eliminated as will Lomita Drive and
Santa Teresa Street opposite the
Storke Publications Building and the
old Firehouse. Both will be turned
into mall areas.
No Parking
All parking will be phased out near
the Quad and will be situated in large
lots behind Bowman Alumni House lot
A, Jordan Quad lot B, behind the
Biology Buildings lot C, lot Hand K
near Maples Pavilion, lot J behind the
new Law School and where the Bridge
is now, and two proposed parking lots,
F and G, bordering Palm Drive
between Museum Way and Palm Tree
Lane.
According to a University planning
report no parking lots will be more
than eight minutes away from the
inner Quad. "In this climate their will
be no hardship in walking," Nelson
said. He added that the handicapped

would be given special parking places.
The planning procedure for creating
this program were very complex but
Shaw said that "It's fair to say the
planning begins at both the bottom
and the top, students and faculty."
Shaw said that finalized plans "are not
a concensus but an integration of all
facility needs."
Demand
Shaw explained that new structures
were built as demands and that the
needs were normally transmitted by
department heads to the deans of the
different schools who in turn
transmitted the priorities to the
Provost's office.
Once the proposal has been
formulated it is then shown to Lyman
and Miller who ultimately decide on
the merits of the program. Shaw
pointed out that "they [the president
and provost] don't create — they
decide."
If the project is approved it then
goes into the final stages where the
provost's office, the Planning
Department, and the academic
department of the proposed building
cooperate in final plans.
In the early 1980s when the
University reaches a "Dynamic Steady
State" the University will reach a state
of equilibrium both in the number of
faculty, staff, and students, but in
facilities as well.
But as Oscar Nelson pointed out, "I
don't think the campus will ever be in
a finished state so long as our demands
our constantly changing."

stretch of road in the Row House area
will connect Lane W to Alvarado Row.
As part of this plan Stillman house will
be relocated next to Lathrop House
and across the street from Beta Theta
Pi.
Serra Street in front of the Math
Corner and Law School will be
converted into a mall as will Galvez
Street between the new proposed Main
Library addition and Encina Hall and
Crothers Memorial Hall.
The present Campus Drive between
Alvarado and Lasuen will be
eliminated as will Lomita Drive and
Santa Teresa Street opposite the
Storke Publications Building and the
old Firehouse. Both will be turned
into mall areas.
No Parking
All parking will be phased out near
the Quad and will be situated in large
lots behind Bowman Alumni House lot
A, Jordan Quad lot B, behind the
Biology Buildings lot C, lot Hand K
near Maples Pavilion, lot J behind the
new Law School and where the Bridge
is now, and two proposed parking lots,
F and G, bordering Palm Drive
between Museum Way and Palm Tree
Lane.
According to a University planning
report no parking lots will be more
than eight minutes away from the
inner Quad. "In this climate their will
be no hardship in walking," Nelson
said. He added that the handicapped

would be given special parking places.
The planning procedure for creating
this program were very complex but
Shaw said that "It's fair to say the
planning begins at both the bottom
and the top, students and faculty."
Shaw said that finalized plans "are not
a concensus but an integration of all
facility needs."
Demand
Shaw explained that new structures
were built as demands and that the
needs were normally transmitted by
department heads to the deans of the
different schools who in turn
transmitted the priorities to the
Provost's office.
Once the proposal has been
formulated it is then shown to Lyman
and Miller who ultimately decide on
the merits of the program. Shaw
pointed out that "they [the president
and provost] don't create — they
decide."
If the project is approved it then
goes into the final stages where the
provost's office, the Planning
Department, and the academic
department of the proposed building
cooperate in final plans.
In the early 1980s when the
University reaches a "Dynamic Steady
State" the University will reach a state
of equilibrium both in the number of
faculty, staff, and students, but in
facilities as well.
But as Oscar Nelson pointed out, "I
don't think the campus will ever be in
a finished state so long as our demands
our constantly changing."

STANFORD, 1983 — Yessir, that's what the campus is going to look like in
1983. It's a model sitting in the Planning Office, where administrators sit and
dream what things will be like after they've spent 10 years and $83 million
fixing the place up.
The University is embarking on a
major 10-year, $83 million building
program that will permanently alter
the makeup of the campus, according
to Edward E. Shaw, executive assistant
to the Vice President and Provost.
The construction is part of the goal
of achieving a "Dynamic Steady
State" here, and is being partially
financed by the $300 Million
Campaign for Stanford fund drive.
"The Dynamic Steady State,"
defined by Shaw as "no significant
increase in the size of the faculty,
staff, or students," and the other
planning priority, making the Quad
the focal point of campus academic
activity, are the two "assumptions"
that will guide the University's growth
in the next 10 years.
"Ten years from today," Shaw said,
"Stanford will not expand its physical
plant. Hopefully it will be changing
but not growing in the sense of
physical facilities." Shaw said that one
of the chief goals of the program is to
consolidate each department into a
single area.
Same Style
The new structures will generally
follow the University sandstone and
red tile style, but will have some bold
architectural innovations such as a
multi-terraced addition to the main
library.
While the overall planning has been
concluded, the actual blueprints for
many of the buildings have not yet
been completed. "To say there is a
plan is to say too much," he noted.

"To say there are no ideas is too
little."
Buildings are already being
constructed or are in the planning
stages include a new Medical
Center-Hospital expansion, a Main
Library expansion, stadium
renovations, a new chemistry building,
a Medical School Center for
Neuro-Sciences, improvements of
Encina Hall, and a new Engineering
Department building.
In addition, a Stanford Solar
Observatory, a possible new Music
school, Frost Amphitheater
improvements, a research park, and a
ccntral telephone exchange will be
constructed. The University is already
erecting the new Law School, the
Outdoor Primate Center, the
Escondido Multipurpose Building, and
the Athletics Stage II swimming,
squash, and handball complex.
In conjunction with the building
program is the construction of a new
network of roads that will change
campus traffic patterns radically.
Oscar Nelson, Master Planner for the
University, says that ultimately
Campus Drive will be extended to
surround the entire University.
Mayfield Avenue will be connected
to Campus Drive and a new road near
the Stanford Golf Course and parallel
to Los Arboles Street will link
Mayfield to the other part of Campus
Drive near the Medical Center.
Feeder Roads
Feeder roads will link Stanford with
outside communities and many streets
near the Quad will be converted into
pedestrian malls or parking areas.

As part of this new network, Quarry
road will be extended to connect the
Stanford Barn and Shopping Center to
Campus Drive. In addition Campus
Drive will be rerouted and a new
stretch of road in the Row House area
will connect Lane W to Alvarado Row.
As part of this plan Stillman house will
be relocated next to Lathrop House
and across the street from Beta Theta

Serra Street in front of the Math

dream what things will be like after they've spent 10 years and $83 million
fixing the place up.
The University is embarking on a
major 10-year, $83 million building
program that will permanently alter
the makeup of the campus, according
to Edward E. Shaw, executive assistant
to the Vice President and Provost.
The construction is part of the goal
of achieving a "Dynamic Steady
State" here, and is being partially
financed by the $300 Million
Campaign for Stanford fund drive.
"The Dynamic Steady State,"
defined by Shaw as "no significant
increase in the size of the faculty,
staff, or students," and the other
planning priority, making the Quad
the focal point of campus academic
activity, are the two "assumptions"
that will guide the University's growth
in the next 10 years.
"Ten years from today," Shaw said,
"Stanford will not expand its physical
plant. Hopefully it will be changing
but not growing in the sense of
physical facilities." Shaw said that one
of the chief goals of the program is to
consolidate each department into a
single area.
Same Style
The new structures will generally
follow the University sandstone and
red tile style, but will have some bold
architectural innovations such as a
multi-terraced addition to the main
library.
While the overall planning has been
concluded, the actual blueprints for
many of the buildings have not yet
been completed. "To say there is a
plan is to say too much," he noted.

"To say there are no ideas is too
little."
Buildings are already being
constructed or are in the planning
stages include a new Medical
Center-Hospital expansion, a Main
Library expansion, stadium
renovations, a new chemistry building,
a Medical School Center for
Neuro-Sciences, improvements of
Encina Hall, and a new Engineering
Department building.
In addition, a Stanford Solar
Observatory, a possible new Music
school, Frost Amphitheater
improvements, a research park, and a
ccntral telephone exchange will be
constructed. The University is already
erecting the new Law School, the
Outdoor Primate Center, the
Escondido Multipurpose Building, and
the Athletics Stage II swimming,
squash, and handball complex.
In conjunction with the building
program is the construction of a new
network of roads that will change
campus traffic patterns radically.
Oscar Nelson, Master Planner for the
University, says that ultimately
Campus Drive will be extended to
surround the entire University.
Mayfield Avenue will be connected
to Campus Drive and a new road near
the Stanford Golf Course and parallel
to Los Arboles Street will link
Mayfield to the other part of Campus
Drive near the Medical Center.
Feeder Roads
Feeder roads will link Stanford with
outside communities and many streets
near the Quad will be converted into
pedestrian malls or parking areas.

As part of this new network, Quarry
road will be extended to connect the
Stanford Barn and Shopping Center to
Campus Drive. In addition Campus
Drive will be rerouted and a new
stretch of road in the Row House area
will connect Lane W to Alvarado Row.
As part of this plan Stillman house will
be relocated next to Lathrop House
and across the street from Beta Theta
Pi.
Serra Street in front of the Math
Corner and Law School will be
converted into a mall as will Galvez
Street between the new proposed Main
Library addition and Encina Hall and
Crothers Memorial Hall.
The present Campus Drive between
Alvarado and Lasuen will be
eliminated as will Lomita Drive and
Santa Teresa Street opposite the
Storke Publications Building and the
old Firehouse. Both will be turned
into mall areas.
No Parking
All parking will be phased out near
the Quad and will be situated in large
lots behind Bowman Alumni House lot
A, Jordan Quad lot B, behind the
Biology Buildings lot C, lot Hand K
near Maples Pavilion, lot J behind the
new Law School and where the Bridge
is now, and two proposed parking lots,
F and G, bordering Palm Drive
between Museum Way and Palm Tree
Lane.
According to a University planning
report no parking lots will be more
than eight minutes away from the
inner Quad. "In this climate their will
be no hardship in walking," Nelson
said. He added that the handicapped

would be given special parking places.
The planning procedure for creating
this program were very complex but
Shaw said that "It's fair to say the
planning begins at both the bottom
and the top, students and faculty."
Shaw said that finalized plans "are not
a concensus but an integration of all
facility needs."
Demand
Shaw explained that new structures
were built as demands and that the
needs were normally transmitted by
department heads to the deans of the
different schools who in turn
transmitted the priorities to the
Provost's office.
Once the proposal has been
formulated it is then shown to Lyman
and Miller who ultimately decide on
the merits of the program. Shaw
pointed out that "they [the president
and provost] don't create — they
decide."
If the project is approved it then
goes into the final stages where the
provost's office, the Planning
Department, and the academic
department of the proposed building
cooperate in final plans.
In the early 1980s when the
University reaches a "Dynamic Steady
State" the University will reach a state
of equilibrium both in the number of
faculty, staff, and students, but in
facilities as well.
But as Oscar Nelson pointed out, "I
don't think the campus will ever be in
a finished state so long as our demands
our constantly changing."
