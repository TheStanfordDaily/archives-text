# 'La Causa' In Coachella
## Chavez' Bitter Struggle 
### 
Tony Bustamente, MEChA

The bitter struggle being waged
by an alliance of growers and the
Teamsters Union on one side and
Cesar Chavez' farm workers union
on the other is part of a complex
story rooted in the history of
California agriculture. And not all
of the guilt or innocence is on
either side.
The battle now is centered in
the desert farmland of Southern
California's Coachella Valley
where hefty, tough-looking men
hired by the Teamsters Union are
"guarding" the vineyards as
United Farm Workers Union
members and supporters picket
the fields.
Once again, Chavez is operating
with a public image of almost
saintly righteousness—an
impression that growers and
Teamsters bitterly complain is a
pose which does not reflect th
reality of the situation.
Colorful
The growers and Teamsters do
have a point of view whcih is
seldom communicated to the
general public. Yet, a casual
observer looking at the scenes
taking place this week in
Coachella might well come away
with the distinct—if not entirely

justified—feeling that there is no
difficulty distinguishing the "good
guys" from the bad.
The Coachella strike effort by
the UFWU is once again providing
the media with a series of colorful
images reminiscent of the early
civil rights movement days in the
South:
—A group of UFWU members
about to be arrested for picketing
kneels in prayer with a young
Methodist minister. Facing them,
standing, is a line of muscular
Anglos, some in dark glasses,
glaring with apparent contempt at
the kneeling group. The beefy
"guards" have been hired by the
Teamsters Union for a reporter
$300 a week, plus expenses, "to
protect the property and those
who will continue to work behind
picket lines," one Teamster
explained.
Songs
—A young Chicano who has
marched along the picket lines
strumming his guitar and singing
Mexican songs is arrested.
Undaunted, the UFWU supporter
serenades the deputy sheriff
leading him to a paddy wagon.
—A young married couple,
both Chicano farm workers, are

arrested on the picket line for
violating a court order sharply
limiting picketing. (The court
later modified the order
substantially.) The couple are
arrested, and led away carrying
their three small children in their
arms.
—Chavez calls a press
conference in Washington, flanked
by several members of Congress,
to charge that evidence has now
been found showing that a group
of lettuce growers in Salinas "paid
off" Teamster officials in a plot
to destroy the UFWU, and the
Coachella dispute, is an outgrowth
of that "conspiracy."
Educate
—Rev. George Higgins, of the
National Conference of Catholic
Bishops, calls the Teamsters
Union action "one of the most
disgraceful days in the history of
the American labor movements,"
and his words are buttressed by
those of AFL-CIO President
George Meany.
For Chavez, the Coachella
Valley dispute is a new crisis of
major proportions, and "la Causa"
has been helped greatly by the
recent scenes in Coachell and
Washington. Recent developments
in the dispute between the
Growers/Teamsters and the Farm
Workers have helped
tremendously to educate the
public and organize volunteer
forces to support the UFWU in
terms of fund raising, boycotting
of Safeway Stores, and above all,
in respect to national moral
backing for the struggle of the
campesino.
The Chicano Fellows, MEChA,
the ASSU Speakers Bureau, and
several Farm Worker volunteers
are sponsoring the appearance of
Cesar Chavez tonight at 8 p.m. in
Memorial Church. The issues will
e be discussed by the man who has
become a living legend to farm
workers not only in the U.S. but
throughout Mexico and parts of
Latin America as well. The
Stanford community will have the
opportunity to be re-educated on
the lettuce and grape boycotts,
and at the same time the UFWU
will make another important step
in gaining that one element which
makes or breaks a movement for
justice and civil rights, the support
of the people.

The bitter struggle being waged
by an alliance of growers and the
Teamsters Union on one side and
Cesar Chavez' farm workers union
on the other is part of a complex
story rooted in the history of
California agriculture. And not all
of the guilt or innocence is on
either side.
The battle now is centered in
the desert farmland of Southern
California's Coachella Valley
where hefty, tough-looking men
hired by the Teamsters Union are
"guarding" the vineyards as
United Farm Workers Union
members and supporters picket
the fields.
Once again, Chavez is operating
with a public image of almost
saintly righteousness—an
impression that growers and
Teamsters bitterly complain is a
pose which does not reflect th
reality of the situation.
Colorful
The growers and Teamsters do
have a point of view whcih is
seldom communicated to the
general public. Yet, a casual
observer looking at the scenes
taking place this week in
Coachella might well come away
with the distinct—if not entirely

justified—feeling that there is no
difficulty distinguishing the "good
guys" from the bad.
The Coachella strike effort by
the UFWU is once again providing
the media with a series of colorful
images reminiscent of the early
civil rights movement days in the
South:
—A group of UFWU members
about to be arrested for picketing
kneels in prayer with a young
Methodist minister. Facing them,
standing, is a line of muscular
Anglos, some in dark glasses,
glaring with apparent contempt at
the kneeling group. The beefy
"guards" have been hired by the
Teamsters Union for a reporter
$300 a week, plus expenses, "to
protect the property and those
who will continue to work behind
picket lines," one Teamster
explained.
Songs
—A young Chicano who has
marched along the picket lines
strumming his guitar and singing
Mexican songs is arrested.
Undaunted, the UFWU supporter
serenades the deputy sheriff
leading him to a paddy wagon.
—A young married couple,
both Chicano farm workers, are

arrested on the picket line for
violating a court order sharply
limiting picketing. (The court
later modified the order
substantially.) The couple are
arrested, and led away carrying
their three small children in their
arms.
—Chavez calls a press
conference in Washington, flanked
by several members of Congress,
to charge that evidence has now
been found showing that a group
of lettuce growers in Salinas "paid
off" Teamster officials in a plot
to destroy the UFWU, and the
Coachella dispute, is an outgrowth
of that "conspiracy."
