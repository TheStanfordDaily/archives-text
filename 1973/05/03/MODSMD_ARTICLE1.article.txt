# Chavez Blasts Teamster 'Goons', Calls Union's Behavior 'Shameful'
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
United Farm Workers Director
Cesar Chavez lashed out at the
Teamsters Union last night, calling
their actions "the most shameful acts
of any union in the annals of the labor
movement in the United States."
Chavez referred to the union's
signing of contracts with Coachella
Valley grape growers less than 10
hours after UFW contracts ran out
April 14, and also to the Teamsters'
use of "goons" to break the
UFW-sponsored picket lines.
Chavez spoke to some 600 persons
in Memorial Church as part of the
UFW's current fund-raising drive.
"It seems like every time we get in
trouble we come here," Chavez began.
"When I was here in October, I said
'grapes si, lettuce no.' Now it's 'grapes
no , lettuce no."
"We thought the growers were our

friends. Until three weeks ago, every
opportunity I got I promoted grapes. I
felt an obligation to do so and help
growers get the most for their
product," Chavez said.
Men On Moon
The UFW leader reported that in
February he bargained with the grape
growers in good faith, but that, as he
learned later, the growers were
simultaneously negotiating with the
Teamsters, "a union which no more
represents the interests of the
farmworkers than the men on the
moon.
"We are not bitter at the growers,
we are unhappy, but as for our
brothers in the Teamsters Union .. ."
Chavez said, letting the sentence die.
This statement may have been an
oblique reference to a statement made
by Rev. Lou Reilly of the First
Congregational Church of Palo Alto.

Reilly, introducing Chavez, called him
a man "with no bitterness in his
heart."
'Greatest Sin'
Chavez then continued, "The
greatest sin any union can commit is
to come in and try to destroy another
union."
The UFW founder then outlined
the Teamsters' signing of contracts
with the growers, and subsequent
picketing by UFW members, many of
whom were sent to jail for violating
court injunctions.
In order to break the UFW picket
lines, Chavez charged, the Teamsters
brought in 200 "goons" from
motorcycle gangs in the Los Angeles
area.
Plan To Mace Kids
"These 'goons' took great joy in
macing our people. They had a
deliberate plan to mace the kids to

frighten the parents and end our
picket lines." Chavez had previously
explained that the UFW picket lines
included entire families.
"About 50 or so drunken 'goons'
came in and started beating our
people. There was a policeman
there ... and he said he didn't see
anyone in our picket line raise a hand
against them [the 'goons'] or cuss.
"When they had recovered from the
shock of being hit, our people just
picked themselves up and starting
singing 'We Shall Overcome.'
"Non-violence had a tremendous
victory in our Valdora camp that
night."
Demands Elections
Chavez then demanded that the
growers agree to elections with the
Teamsters and the UFW to determine
which, if either, union the
farmworkers wanted to have represent
them.
Chavez was greeted with rhythmic
applause when he added "they may
have the contracts, but we have the
workers."
In response to a question, he urged
Palo Alto-area supporters to donate
food and money for strikers, picket
Safeway Stores for selling non-union
lettuce, boycott both lettuce and
grapes, and write letters to Teamsters
Union President Frank Fitzimmons.
At a press conference following the
address, Chavez hinted that the Nixon
administration might be aiding the
growers and Teamsters in dealing with
the UFW grape boycott. This boycott
is scheduled to begin around May 20
when the first grapes hit the market.
Chavez' visit was supported by
MEChA, Chicano Fellows Association,
the Office of the Assistant to the
President for Chicano Affairs, Chicano
Education Association, Memorial
Church, ASSU Speakers' Bureau and
Special Events, members of both the
"I-Center" and "Y Board," and other
student and faculty supporters.

area.
Plan To Mace Kids
"These 'goons' took great joy in
macing our people. They had a
deliberate plan to mace the kids to

frighten the parents and end our
picket lines." Chavez had previously
explained that the UFW picket lines
included entire families.
"About 50 or so drunken 'goons'
came in and started beating our
people. There was a policeman
there ... and he said he didn't see
anyone in our picket line raise a hand
against them [the 'goons'] or cuss.
"When they had recovered from the
shock of being hit, our people just
picked themselves up and starting
singing 'We Shall Overcome.'
"Non-violence had a tremendous
victory in our Valdora camp that
night."
Demands Elections
Chavez then demanded that the
growers agree to elections with the
Teamsters and the UFW to determine
which, if either, union the
farmworkers wanted to have represent
them.
Chavez was greeted with rhythmic
applause when he added "they may
have the contracts, but we have the
workers."
In response to a question, he urged
Palo Alto-area supporters to donate
food and money for strikers, picket
Safeway Stores for selling non-union
lettuce, boycott both lettuce and
grapes, and write letters to Teamsters
Union President Frank Fitzimmons.
At a press conference following the
address, Chavez hinted that the Nixon
administration might be aiding the
growers and Teamsters in dealing with
the UFW grape boycott. This boycott
is scheduled to begin around May 20
when the first grapes hit the market.

CESAR CHAVEZ . . .
.. . Lettuce No, Grapes No
United Farm Workers Director
Cesar Chavez lashed out at the
Teamsters Union last night, calling
their actions "the most shameful acts
of any union in the annals of the labor
movement in the United States."
Chavez referred to the union's
signing of contracts with Coachella
Valley grape growers less than 10
hours after UFW contracts ran out
April 14, and also to the Teamsters'
use of "goons" to break the
UFW-sponsored picket lines.
Chavez spoke to some 600 persons
in Memorial Church as part of the
UFW's current fund-raising drive.
"It seems like every time we get in
trouble we come here," Chavez began.
"When I was here in October, I said
'grapes si, lettuce no.' Now it's 'grapes
no , lettuce no."
"We thought the growers were our

friends. Until three weeks ago, every
opportunity I got I promoted grapes. I
felt an obligation to do so and help
growers get the most for their
product," Chavez said.
Men On Moon
The UFW leader reported that in
February he bargained with the grape
growers in good faith, but that, as he
learned later, the growers were
simultaneously negotiating with the
Teamsters, "a union which no more
represents the interests of the
farmworkers than the men on the
moon.
"We are not bitter at the growers,
we are unhappy, but as for our
brothers in the Teamsters Union .. ."
Chavez said, letting the sentence die.
This statement may have been an
oblique reference to a statement made
by Rev. Lou Reilly of the First
Congregational Church of Palo Alto.

Reilly, introducing Chavez, called him
a man "with no bitterness in his
heart."
'Greatest Sin'
Chavez then continued, "The
greatest sin any union can commit is
to come in and try to destroy another
union."
The UFW founder then outlined
the Teamsters' signing of contracts
with the growers, and subsequent
picketing by UFW members, many of
whom were sent to jail for violating
court injunctions.
In order to break the UFW picket
lines, Chavez charged, the Teamsters
brought in 200 "goons" from
motorcycle gangs in the Los Angeles
area.
Plan To Mace Kids
"These 'goons' took great joy in
macing our people. They had a
deliberate plan to mace the kids to
