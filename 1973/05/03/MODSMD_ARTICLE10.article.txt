# A 						Pernicious Doctrine
## 'Responsibility' And The Press 
### 
Bill Evers

There is a doctrine abroad in
the land, in America's collegiate
communications departments and
in its journalism reviews, called
the "social responsibility" theory
of the press. This pernicious
doctrine has reigned too long
unchallenged. It is erroneous and
should be discarded.
What does the "social
responsibility" doctrine hold? It
holds that the primary
justification for the continued
existence of newspapers,
television stations, and radio
stations is that these media carry
out certain duties and fulfill
certain functions which the
government finds politically
desirable.
Thus, the corporate liberals
who adhere to the "social
responsibility" position have
rejected the classic libertarian
position that it is enough that you
give me a newspaper and I accept
it, or that you sell me a newspaper
and I buy it. Instead, the
corporate liberals argue that for
interest-group pluralism to work,
it is pragmatically necessary to
transmit certain information to
the masses; for this purpose
communications media are
needed; and the government and
those groups that the government
sanctions have a right of access
(space in high-circulation,
successful newspapers; time on
widely-viewed television stations)
to the media.
Break
The most remarkable thing
about the "social responsibility"
doctrine is not its audacious
authoritarianism and its view of
the media as the tool of
democratic government, but
rather the claim of those who
profess the doctrine that it is a
mere modification of the
libertarian theory of the press.
For example, Theodore
Peterson maintains that the
"social responsibility" doctrine is
"an important modification of
traditional libertarian theory."
But the truth is that "social
responsibility" is a radical break
with freedom of the press.
In the mid-1950s a college
textbook was put together by
three communications professors:
Peterson, Fred S. Siebert, and
Wilbur Schramm. In it, they
identify what they consider the
four main theories of the press
authoritarian, libertarian, social
responsibility, and Marxian.
Utilitarian
Yet while the cover of the
book says that the book presents
the libertarian theory arising from
a belief in man's natural rights,
this natural rights view is not
expounded at length in Siebert's
section on libertarian theory.
Instead utilitarian views
underlie the discussion in this
section. The utilitarian position
that "all human action ... should
aim at creating, maintaining, and
increasing the greatest happiness
of the greatest number of persons,
for the good society is one in
which the greatest possible
number of people enjoy the
greatest happiness," is implicit in
Siebert's discussion of films,
broadcasting, wartime conditions,
and government classified
documents.
Fascinatingly enough, this
claim that the rulers should act
for the true greatest happiness of
the masses is not only the premise
of the "social responsibility"
doctrine, but also of authoritarian
doctrines for many centuries.
Siebert claims that "no
comprehensive statement of the
problem of the relation of
government to the press appeared
between Milton and John Stuart
Mill." This is simply false.
Between Milton in the
seventeenth century and Mill in

the nineteenth came the flowering
of Enlightment radicalism.
In this period came not only
the libertarian writings of John
Trenchard and Thomas Gordon in
England, but also in America the
systematic treatises of
Jeffersonians like George Hay and
Tunis Wortman who wrote in
response to the Alien and Sedition
Acts of 1798.
Wortman has been recognized,
even by the important
authoritarian political theorist
Willmoore Kendall, as having
written the finest defense ever
penned of absolute freedom of
the press. Wortman calls for "total
exemption of the press from any
kind of legislative control."
Duty
Much of Siebert's description

of libertarian theory is a
misrepresentation. For example,
Siebert asserts that most
libertarians believe that "the state
has an obligation to protect
society, or at least some parts of
it, from lewd and indecent
publications."
Woven throughout both
Siebert's account of libertarian
theory and Peterson's account of
the "social responsibility" theory
are arguments quoted or
paraphrased from the 1947 report
of the Hutchins-Luce Commission
on the responsibilities of the
press.
As Chicago Tribune reporter
Frank Hughes pointed out at the
time, the Hutchins-Luce
Commission presented the "social
responsibility" doctrine in its

fully developed form:
"It is a philosophy which
destroys completely
conception that individual citizens
have any 'unalienable' basic
rights. ... It substitutes a theory
that man's rights come from
duty.... Applied to freedom of
the press, this 'new philosophy'
means that freedom to print is the
property of the government, to be
granted or withheld from
individual citizens at government's
will."
The corporate liberal doctrine
of "social responsibility" is not a
theory justifying freedom of the
press, but rather its authoritarian
subordination to governmental
regulation.
