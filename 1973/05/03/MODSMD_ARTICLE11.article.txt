Apology 'Cowardly'
Editor:
The Daily apologized Tuesday
for the Jews for Jesus ad it had
run the day before, saying that
the ad had offended and insulted
some members of the community.
The apology implied that the ad
should not have been run.
I think this is a dangerous, not
to mention cowardly, precedent
to set. The Daily has no obligation
to be inoffensive. It does not
endorse every product, service,
organization or event which
advertises in its pages.
Ecologists don't like
snowmobile advertising that talks
about the beauty of nature;
teetotallers don't like ads for bars,
pacifists don't like recruiting ads
for the U.S. Marine Corps. But
nobody has to go out and buy a
snowmobile, or head for the
nearest bar, or enlist. When the ad
appears, people can choose to
ignore it. When the ad does not
appear, they do not have that
choice.
Jews don't like Christians who
try to convert them. I'm a Jew
and I don't like it. I thought the
ad was stupid, patronizing and
utterly unpersuasive. But I think
that for the price of a full page ad,
Jews for Jesus has the right to be
as stupid, patronizing
and unpersuasive as it likes. Jewish
students are not so weak-minded
and gullible that they need to be
protected by prior censorship
from the arguments of Jews
for Jesus.
I ask the Daily to retract its
apology and assert its right to
accept advertising of any kind.
