# Rothbard 'Inane'
## Quotas And The Democrats 
### 
£ Gary Roberts

(First of two parts)
Murray N. Rothbard's position
on quotas (Daily, April 27) is
nothing short of inane. Its theme
is becoming very popular—but
Rothbard's erroneous notions
must be dispelled.
Rothbard's "conventional
wisdom" in reality consists of a
series of ideas, all of which are
supposed to reinforce the validity
of the others. These notions are:
(1) all quotas are bad and
undemocratic, (2) the 1972
Democratic Convention is a clear
example of the evil quotas
(witness the unseating of "the
duly and freely elected delegates"
from Chicago), and (3) anyone
who supports quotas is leading the
nation down the road of
neo-Nazism. I will discuss each in
turn.
The popular notion that all
quotas are bad is as silly as saying
all government is bad. The United
States Senate is operating on a
quota system. Nevada gets two
senators despite the fact there
might be 100 Californians better
qualified than anyone in Nevada.
Any university operates on a
quota system. We only hire so
many historians as professors
despite the fact that some
historians not hired might be
better qualified than everyone in
the English department. The
Council of Churches allocates its
membership on a quota system.
Quotas are necessary and essential
to the effective representation of
certain groups in any political,
academic, religious, etc.
organization.
Situations
Thus, the issue is not whether
quotas are inherently evil or not,
but rather (a) what categories
should quotas be set upon, and
(b) how rigid quotas be followed.
I contend each situation must be
analyzed individually if a propel
solution is to be reached.
A political convention is a
completely different thing in
procedure, size, and purpose from
a university student body. A
quota category in one case may be
a totally inappropriate category in
the other. The answer, however,
will not come from an
oversimplistic and useless
platitude that says "all quolas are
bad."
This leads us to a look at the
1972 Democratic Convention, to
which I had the privilege of being
a delegate from downstate Illinois.
Since Sen. McGovern was so badly
defeated in November, it has
become quite in vogue to scoff at
anything that was associated with
that convention. Perhaps the
coming four years will dampen

that attitude, but no matter, the
"quota system" that has been
associated with the convention
has been grossly misrepresented
and unfairly criticized.
Convention
At the convention, there was
not a single delegate who was
unseated because of any quota
analysis. Every unseated delegate
was unseated because of the illegal
and unauthorized methods by
which they were selected (the
composition of the delgation
being just one indicator of the
exclusionary nature of the
selection process). Rothbard's
contention that the Daley Chicago
delegates were the "duly and
freely elected" delegates is ample
evidence of his ignorance of the

convention as well as of Chicago
politics.
The slate of 59 delegates from
Chicago that were unseated were
handpicked in the mayor's office.
It is true that this slate was
elected against "opposition" in
the primary, but for two reasons
this election was nothing but a
sham: (1) the Daley slate
campaign was organized, run, and
financed through the offices of
city and county employees, and
(2) the election was run by city
and county election officials.
Because of these facts, the
delegates to the convention
decided that these delegates were
not chosen in a representative
manner, and thus could not
represent the people of Chicago. I
personally voted in favor of these

delegates because the alternative
slate was equally unrepresentative
and illegitimately chosen, but the
final decision rested on the
legitimacy of the delegations, not
on any quota violations. The
unrepresentative nature of the
Daley group was only one piece of
evidence against the process which
selected them.
One's opinion about this issue
is one thing, but to call the Daley
slate the "duly and freely elected"
slate is totally absurd. In short,
these people were unseated not
because of quotas, but even if
they were, it was certainly not
unjustified.

(witness the unseating of "the
duly and freely elected delegates"
from Chicago), and (3) anyone
who supports quotas is leading the
nation down the road of
neo-Nazism. I will discuss each in
turn.
The popular notion that all
quotas are bad is as silly as saying
all government is bad. The United
States Senate is operating on a
quota system. Nevada gets two
senators despite the fact there
might be 100 Californians better
qualified than anyone in Nevada.
Any university operates on a
quota system. We only hire so
many historians as professors
despite the fact that some
historians not hired might be
better qualified than everyone in
the English department. The
Council of Churches allocates its
membership on a quota system.
Quotas are necessary and essential
to the effective representation of
certain groups in any political,
academic, religious, etc.
organization.
Situations
Thus, the issue is not whether
quotas are inherently evil or not,
but rather (a) what categories
should quotas be set upon, and
(b) how rigid quotas be followed.
I contend each situation must be
analyzed individually if a propel
solution is to be reached.
A political convention is a
completely different thing in
procedure, size, and purpose from
a university student body. A
quota category in one case may be
a totally inappropriate category in
the other. The answer, however,
will not come from an
oversimplistic and useless
platitude that says "all quolas are
bad."
This leads us to a look at the
1972 Democratic Convention, to
which I had the privilege of being
a delegate from downstate Illinois.
Since Sen. McGovern was so badly
defeated in November, it has
become quite in vogue to scoff at
anything that was associated with
that convention. Perhaps the
coming four years will dampen

that attitude, but no matter, the
"quota system" that has been
associated with the convention
has been grossly misrepresented
and unfairly criticized.
Convention
At the convention, there was
not a single delegate who was
unseated because of any quota
analysis. Every unseated delegate
was unseated because of the illegal
and unauthorized methods by
which they were selected (the
composition of the delgation
being just one indicator of the
exclusionary nature of the
selection process). Rothbard's
contention that the Daley Chicago
delegates were the "duly and
freely elected" delegates is ample
evidence of his ignorance of the

convention as well as of Chicago
politics.
The slate of 59 delegates from
Chicago that were unseated were
handpicked in the mayor's office.
It is true that this slate was
elected against "opposition" in
the primary, but for two reasons
this election was nothing but a
sham: (1) the Daley slate
campaign was organized, run, and
financed through the offices of
city and county employees, and
(2) the election was run by city
and county election officials.
Because of these facts, the
delegates to the convention
decided that these delegates were
not chosen in a representative
manner, and thus could not
represent the people of Chicago. I
personally voted in favor of these

delegates because the alternative
slate was equally unrepresentative
and illegitimately chosen, but the
final decision rested on the
legitimacy of the delegations, not
on any quota violations. The
unrepresentative nature of the
Daley group was only one piece of
evidence against the process which
selected them.
One's opinion about this issue
is one thing, but to call the Daley
slate the "duly and freely elected"
slate is totally absurd. In short,
these people were unseated not
because of quotas, but even if
they were, it was certainly not
unjustified.
