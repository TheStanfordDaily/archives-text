# 'We Commend The Board’
## Support For SCIRE 
### 
Synergy et al.

We, the undersigned, wish to
express our support of the
decision of the SCIRE Policy
Board to sever its ties with the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
and will support their efforts to
continue to function as a center
for student innovation on campus.
We join with them in
reaffirming the need for a student
center of the nature of SCIRE as
it was originally designed — with
students in policy making roles at
Stanford University. Equally
important, we also add our voices
to theirs in support of Ron Jones
as director, and feel that the
Dean's office has made a serious
mistake in "terminating his
contract.* We make these
statements for the following
reasons:
(1) We have benefited from
the existence of SCIRE as
coordinated by the Board and
staff, Ron Jones and Dana
Weigent. During the past year,
SCIRE has fulfilled very real
student needs that were not met
elsewhere. We support the
granting of academic credit for
such courses as the History of
Jazz, Women's Study Groups, and
Auto Mechanics, because we feel
that they do play a valuable role
iour education. In short, SCIRE

does encourage innovation, as well
as providing a structure within
which to do constructuve
learning.
(2) Although we are aware that
SCIRE may not have functioned
as efficiently as possible this past
year, we feel that issues
concerning policy, such as the
number of courses offered each
quarter, the academic standards
which must be met, the role of
the director in relationship to the
Board, and so forth, should be
worked out by the Board, staff,
and the Dean together — and not
by one alone.
It is unfounded that these
criticisms which the Board itself
has acknowledged as applying to
the whole Board should be
focussed on Ron alone. (It must
be noted that even before Ron
was fired, efforts to formulate
SCIRE's directions for next year
were being made, and the Dean
chose to ignore these efforts.)
Furthermore, it is even more
an affront to SCIRE, and
everything it represents to
students, to fire Ron without
discussing all of the
aforementioned issues candidly
with the Board before this
decision was made. The refusal of
Deans Gibbs and Closson to
discuss these matters openly with

the students and faculty on the
Board, as well as to take into
consideration all the students who
have more than appreciated Ron's
willingness to work out courses
with them this past year,
illustrates a real lack of concern
for students' interests,abilities,and
defined roles in relation to
SCIRE.
(3) Finally, in support of the
Board's decision to coninue the
work of SCIRE, we once again
acknowledge the need for a center
for student innovation on campus,
and agree with them that a SCIRE
which would exist only as
advisory to the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies would be
no SCIRE at all. We commend the
Board for standing firmly behind
its commitment to best serve the
students at this university, and
encourage all students and faculty
to once again reaffirm the idea of
education which SCIRE
represents: that of student
initiated and directed projects and
courses. It has become apparent
that such rededication is needed,
and we join the SCIRE Board ithis
effort.
