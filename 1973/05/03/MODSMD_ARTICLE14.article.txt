# Cells Grown Here To Orbit
## 
### 
Living human cells, stored and
grown in a medical research
laboratory here, will be orbited in
outer space for 28 days to
determine the effects of
prolonged weightlessness on their
ability to survive.
Cultures of the human cells
will be put aboard Skylab, the
U.S.' first manned orbital space
station scheduled to be launched
from Cape Kennedy May 14.
Stored in tiny chambers in a
specially designed instrument
package, the cells will be fed
automatically with nutrients
during the mission. The cells'
movements in tissue culture will
be recorded by time-lapse
photography.
During their normal duties,
Skylab's astronauts will check
from time to time if the hardware
is working. While in-flight data are
being obtained, an experiment
package on the ground will be
operated at the same temperature
as the in-flight package. This
information will be available to
permit comparison of the cell
growth in earth gravity.
At the end of 28 days, the cells
will be retrieved in the Pacific

Ocean by an aircraft carrier, and
flown to San Diego and then to
Stanford where scientists will
study the effects of zero gravity
on their growth.
"This marks the first time that
scientists will be able to assess the
effects of prolonged space flights
at the cellular level," said Dr.
Leonard Hayflick, professor of
medical microbiology here and
co-investigator on the NASA
project.
"We have no information
regarding either subtle or perhaps
even major effects that might take
place at the cellular level," the
microbiologist explained.
"It is probably not too
far-fetched to assume that there
are effects on the human cell's
ability to divide normally at zero
gravity that are not expressed in
the short time that astronauts
have lived in space.
"The more subtle effects
following brief exposures must be
determined if dangerous
consequences are to be
anticipated and avoided during
future space explorations."
Hayflick said he plans to study
the basic genetics of human cells
exposed to weightlessness. Among

these will be possible chromosome
breakage, the same kind that is
frequently produced by drugs.
The NASA project was
designed and is directed by Drs.
Philip Montgomery and Joseph
Paul of the University of Texas,
Southwestern Medical School in
Dallas.
The human embryonic diploid
cells that will be used in the
experiment have been preserved in
the super cold of liquid nitrogen
for 11 years. They are called
diploid cells because they have the
correct shape and proper number
of chromosomes known to be
normal for man — that is, 46.
Because these cells are known to
be normal and free of
contaminating viruses, they are
being used all over the world as a
growth medium for manufacture
of human virus vaccines and for
cancer research.
The cells are also used for
Hayflick's studies in aging. He
found these cells will double 50
times and then die because all
embryonic human cells are
"programmed" that way. When
the cells are thawed for use, they
"remember" the number of

doublings they had achieved
before being frozen.
The cells that will be used for
the NASA experiment are at the
10th doubling level, Hayflick said.
Skylab will be launched atop a
giant Saturn 5 booster and sent
into a 269-mile-high orbit of
earth.
Next day, a smaller Saturn 1-B
rocket will loft an Apollo
command ship with three
astronauts on board on a similar
orbital path to rendezvous and
dock with Skylab. The astronauts
will remain there for the next 28
days.
According to NASA, Skylab's
mission will have far-reaching
consequences. It will help
determine if man can live and
work in space for extended
periods of time necessary to make
round trips to other planets or
moons.

growth in earth gravity.
At the end of 28 days, the cells
will be retrieved in the Pacific

Ocean by an aircraft carrier, and
flown to San Diego and then to
Stanford where scientists will
study the effects of zero gravity
on their growth.
"This marks the first time that
scientists will be able to assess the
effects of prolonged space flights
at the cellular level," said Dr.
Leonard Hayflick, professor of
medical microbiology here and
co-investigator on the NASA
project.
"We have no information
regarding either subtle or perhaps
even major effects that might take
place at the cellular level," the
microbiologist explained.
"It is probably not too
far-fetched to assume that there
are effects on the human cell's
ability to divide normally at zero
gravity that are not expressed in
the short time that astronauts
have lived in space.
"The more subtle effects
following brief exposures must be
determined if dangerous
consequences are to be
anticipated and avoided during
future space explorations."
Hayflick said he plans to study
the basic genetics of human cells
exposed to weightlessness. Among

these will be possible chromosome
breakage, the same kind that is
frequently produced by drugs.
The NASA project was
designed and is directed by Drs.
Philip Montgomery and Joseph
Paul of the University of Texas,
Southwestern Medical School in
Dallas.
The human embryonic diploid
cells that will be used in the
experiment have been preserved in
the super cold of liquid nitrogen
for 11 years. They are called
diploid cells because they have the
correct shape and proper number
of chromosomes known to be
normal for man — that is, 46.
Because these cells are known to
be normal and free of
contaminating viruses, they are
being used all over the world as a
growth medium for manufacture
of human virus vaccines and for
cancer research.
The cells are also used for
Hayflick's studies in aging. He
found these cells will double 50
times and then die because all
embryonic human cells are
"programmed" that way. When
the cells are thawed for use, they
"remember" the number of

doublings they had achieved
before being frozen.
The cells that will be used for
the NASA experiment are at the
10th doubling level, Hayflick said.
Skylab will be launched atop a
giant Saturn 5 booster and sent
into a 269-mile-high orbit of
earth.
Next day, a smaller Saturn 1-B
rocket will loft an Apollo
command ship with three
astronauts on board on a similar
orbital path to rendezvous and
dock with Skylab. The astronauts
will remain there for the next 28
days.
According to NASA, Skylab's
mission will have far-reaching
consequences. It will help
determine if man can live and
work in space for extended
periods of time necessary to make
round trips to other planets or
moons.

Living human cells, stored and
grown in a medical research
laboratory here, will be orbited in
outer space for 28 days to
determine the effects of
prolonged weightlessness on their
ability to survive.
Cultures of the human cells
will be put aboard Skylab, the
U.S.' first manned orbital space
station scheduled to be launched
from Cape Kennedy May 14.
Stored in tiny chambers in a
specially designed instrument
package, the cells will be fed
automatically with nutrients
during the mission. The cells'
movements in tissue culture will
be recorded by time-lapse
photography.
During their normal duties,
Skylab's astronauts will check
from time to time if the hardware
is working. While in-flight data are
being obtained, an experiment
package on the ground will be
operated at the same temperature
as the in-flight package. This
information will be available to
permit comparison of the cell
growth in earth gravity.
