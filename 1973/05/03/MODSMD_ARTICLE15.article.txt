## New Associate Dean Named 
### 
Arnice P. Streit, assistant dean
in the School of Humanities and
Sciences for three years, has been
promoted to associate dean,
according to Albert H. Hastorf,
dean of the School.
Beginning work in the office as
a secretary 13 years ago, Streit has
gradually assumed administrative
responsibility for the management
of an approximately $12 million
budget for the 26 departments of
the School.
"This office can accommodate
the comings and goings of faculty
members who serve as deans and
associate deans only because
Arnice was here to provide
continuity," says Hastorf.
"Mrs. Streit trains every new
department chairman and
departmental administrative
assistant, as well as the deans and
associate deans in this office in
the budgeting process," he
explains.
The budgeting cycle carried
out by Streit and her assistant
begins in January, when the office

receives its allocation for the next
academic year from the provost's
office.
A list of departmental
commitments and percentage
allocations is prepared, taking into
account deductions required by
the budget adjustment program,
and submitted by early April.
Changes in departmental
faculty billets are negotiated first
with Hastorf, to whom a
department chairman must justify
an additional position on
intellectual and academic grounds,
and then with Streit, with whom
budgetary requirements must be

settled. "She has to say 'no' to a
lot of people," says Hastorf.
"But what is important is that
she takes the time not only to
explain the budget problems, but
to understand the needs and
interests of all the various
departments and programs."
Streit is now involved in
checking of individual allocations
and adjustments in the salary
raises of some faculty members.
During the summer she prepares
the payroll for the following year,
and in the fall sets up a payroll for
teaching assistants in all
departments.
