# Precise Planning, Accounting Latecomers To War On Poverty
## 
### DONALD M. ROTHBERG Associated Press Writer 
EDITOR'S NOTE: The office of
Economic Opportunity sought to
change the lives and conditions of
the poor. The following, second in
a four-part series on the OEO
from The AP Special Assignment
Team, looks at some of its
projects.

BARBOURVILLE, Ky. -â€¢ Seated
in the OEO restaurant next door
to the OEO furniture factory,
Hollis West recalled the early days
of the war on poverty.
When he took over as head of
the county antipoverty agency six
years ago, West said, "Most of the
OEO money, so far as I was
concerned, was being thrown in
the Cumberland River out here
because they were primarily
putting it in recreation and all
kinds of foolish things."
Comprehensive planning and
precise accounting were relative
latecomers to the OEO and they
may not be enough to save it.
President Nixon has ordered
the agency dismantled by this
summer. A federal judge has
intervened, but this ruling may do
little more than delay OEO's
extinction.
What the people in the
Barbourville area wanted, West
said, were "jobs and roads fixed
and this kind of thing. So that's
the approach we took."
Financial Help
With financial help from OEO,
West started Lawson Furniture
Co., which today employs 110
people. Most never had any job
other than cutting weeds for $2 or
$3 a day. The company expects to
do $1.5 million in business this
year to stores from Massachusetts
to Florida.
The furniture business,
restaurant and craft shop, along
with community centers and road
crews that have built 136 small
wooden bridges, make the
antipoverty program, called
simply "The OEO" by Knox
County people, the county's
second largest employer.
To residents like Burchell

Sizemore, who grew up in Knox
County, OEO has brought vast
changes:
Consequences
"If OEO was to happen to fade
out right now, in six months it'll
be just like it was when we
started."
But to a visitor, Knox County
people still have the gaunt, hungry
look that flashed across the
American consciousness a decade
ago when Appalachia became a
synonym for rural poverty.
According to the 1960 census,
Knox County had 25,000 persons,
of whom 18,000 fitted the
government's definition of poor.
Ten years later, the number of
poor had dropped below 13,000
and the only change in job
opportunities had come from
OEO.
Failed In Its Role
OEO often failed to live up to
its assigned role as coordinator of
all the antipoverty programs based
in other federal departments. The
result was programs competing to
provide the same services.
Mayor Kenneth A. Gibson of
Newark, N.J., said that at one
time "you had a funded program
coming from OEO that was
manpower training. You had a
funded program coming from the
Labor Department that was
manpower training.
"Both trying to do the same
thing. Both trying to go through
the same employers to provide
jobs for two different guys getting
different kinds of training."
Jobs Wanted
Jobs were what many people
wanted from the antipoverty
program. But in many urban areas
riots, crime and high tax rates had
driven both retail and
manufacturing jobs into the
suburbs beyond the reach of the
poor.
So the poverty programs
themselves along with local
governments became the biggest
sources of jobs.
The New Careers program,
based in the Labor Department
but administered through the

Community Action Program of
OEO, was set up to train poor
people for public service jobs
ranging from policemen and
firemen to clerks and
stenographers.
Newark Program
The program was established in
Newark in 1967 during the
administration of Mayor Hugh
Addonizio, now serving a 10-year
sentence for extortion in a federal
penitentiary.
A grand jury that examined the
New Careers program found that
$4 million for the program
appeared to be paying for little
more than a vast patronage system
for local politicians.
When the administrator of the
program appeared before the
grand jury and was asked what his
duties were, he replied: "I open
the door in the morning and close
it at night."
Attempts to determine
whether the government's several
manpower training programs have
produced results to justify their
cost have failed to provide
definite answers.
A staff study for the Joint
Economic Committee of Congress

noted that $179.4 million was
spent on manpower program
research and evaluation between
1962 and 1972 and called the
expenditure "a disturbing contrast
to the anemic set of conclusive
andreliable findings."
The committee report
concluded that, if unemployment
remained above 5 percent, much
of the $1.6 billion planned for
manpower programs for the
current fiscal year probably would
be better spent on creating jobs.
Along with jobs and benefits
the poor wanted most from
antipoverty programs was a better
education for their children.
Probably the most popular OEO
program of all, both among the
poor and within the government,
is Head Start, the preschool
program designed to give poor
children an exposure to reading
and writing skills they may not be
getting at home.
But many of the studies also
conclude that unless the children
are placed in followup programs,
they soon lost the advantage they
gained from Head Start.
