# Ehrlichman's Second FBI Interview Reveals Location Of Ellsberg File
## 
### Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES — A second FBI
interview with former presidential
adviser John D. Ehrlichman revealed
yesterday that Ehrlichman believes the
products of the investigation by two
Watergate conspirators into Daniel
Ellsberg and the Pentagon Papers are
in the National Archives.
The interview also revealed that
Ehrlichman has seen FBI reports on
Ellsberg's wife and on New York
Times reporter Neil Sheehan, who
wrote the story that first revealed
excerpts of the Pentagon Papers in
news media.
The FBI report on Ehrlichman was
released to defense attorneys for
Ellsberg and Anthony Russo along
with interviews with former White
House chief of staff H.R. Haldeman
and h presidential staff secretary,
Bruce Keherli.
Haldeman and Keherli said in the
in' rviews that they knew nothing of
the involvement of Watergate
conspirators G. Gordon Liddy and E.
Howard Hunt in the investigation of
Ellsberg.
Opposed Disclosure
The FBI report on Ehrlichman
notes that the newly resigned
presidential adviser strongly objected
to the disclosure Tuesday of another
FBI interview he gave, in which he said
he knew that Liddy and Hunt had
burglarized Ellsberg's psychiatrist's
office.
The latest FBI memo said that
Ehrlichman was interviewed Tuesday
in the office of his attorney in
Washington. It said that Ehrlichman
told agents that "there must be papers
concerning the investigation of Daniel
Ellsberg."
"Mr. Ehrlichman recalled a project
to prepare a psychological profile on
Ellsberg," said the report. "It has been
over a year, however, since Mr.
Ehrlichman has seen anything on the
Pentagon Papers investigation."
Clipping File
The report said Ehrlichman noted
that he himself maintained a

newspaper clipping file on the
Pentagon Papers case. "This has been
sent to the presidential file, and Mr.
Ehrlichman assumed this material was
now in archives."
The report added that Ehrlichman
was asked about any probe regarding
the families of EUsberg and Russo.
"Mr. Ehrlichman recalled seeing FBI
reports which had information about
Ellsberg's wife. Mr. Ehrlichman also
noted he had seen FBI reports
containing information about Neal
Sheehan of the New York Times."
Bribery Charged
The disclosure was made outside
the presence of the jury, as was trial
Judge Matt Byrne's response earlier in
the day to defense attorneys'

accusations that Ehrlichman tried to
bribe him by offering him the post of
director of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation.
He insisted that he never discussed
the case in two meetings with
Ehrlichman or in a brief chat with
President Nixon.
The U.S. District Court judge also
disclosed that during the same week he
saw Nixon and Ehrlichman he was
introduced to Nixon's foreign policy
adviser Henry Kissinger at a party.
Despite Byrne's statement, defense
attorney Leonard Weinglass later said
outside court that the defense
probably will move for mistrial today
on grounds that the government
sought to "compromise" the trial
judge.
Byrne already has taken under
submission a defense motion for
dismissal of the indictment against
Ellsberg and Russo.
Byrne, who previously revealed
only that he had been approached
about a "future assignment in
government," said he wanted to clarify
the record in view of a defense motion
which alleged a "bribe" attempt.

"Mr. Ehrlichman recalled seeing FBI
reports which had information about
Ellsberg's wife. Mr. Ehrlichman also
noted he had seen FBI reports
containing information about Neal
Sheehan of the New York Times."
Bribery Charged
The disclosure was made outside
the presence of the jury, as was trial
Judge Matt Byrne's response earlier in
the day to defense attorneys'

accusations that Ehrlichman tried to
bribe him by offering him the post of
director of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation.
He insisted that he never discussed
the case in two meetings with
Ehrlichman or in a brief chat with
President Nixon.
The U.S. District Court judge also
disclosed that during the same week he
saw Nixon and Ehrlichman he was
introduced to Nixon's foreign policy
adviser Henry Kissinger at a party.
Despite Byrne's statement, defense
attorney Leonard Weinglass later said
outside court that the defense
probably will move for mistrial today
on grounds that the government
sought to "compromise" the trial
judge.
Byrne already has taken under
submission a defense motion for
dismissal of the indictment against
Ellsberg and Russo.
Byrne, who previously revealed
only that he had been approached
about a "future assignment in
government," said he wanted to clarify
the record in view of a defense motion
which alleged a "bribe" attempt.
LOS ANGELES — A second FBI
interview with former presidential
adviser John D. Ehrlichman revealed
yesterday that Ehrlichman believes the
products of the investigation by two
Watergate conspirators into Daniel
Ellsberg and the Pentagon Papers are
in the National Archives.
The interview also revealed that
Ehrlichman has seen FBI reports on
Ellsberg's wife and on New York
Times reporter Neil Sheehan, who
wrote the story that first revealed
excerpts of the Pentagon Papers in
news media.
The FBI report on Ehrlichman was
released to defense attorneys for
Ellsberg and Anthony Russo along
with interviews with former White
House chief of staff H.R. Haldeman
and h presidential staff secretary,
Bruce Keherli.
Haldeman and Keherli said in the
in' rviews that they knew nothing of
the involvement of Watergate
conspirators G. Gordon Liddy and E.
Howard Hunt in the investigation of
Ellsberg.
Opposed Disclosure
The FBI report on Ehrlichman
notes that the newly resigned
presidential adviser strongly objected
to the disclosure Tuesday of another
FBI interview he gave, in which he said
he knew that Liddy and Hunt had
burglarized Ellsberg's psychiatrist's
office.
The latest FBI memo said that
Ehrlichman was interviewed Tuesday
in the office of his attorney in
Washington. It said that Ehrlichman
told agents that "there must be papers
concerning the investigation of Daniel
Ellsberg."
"Mr. Ehrlichman recalled a project
to prepare a psychological profile on
Ellsberg," said the report. "It has been
over a year, however, since Mr.
Ehrlichman has seen anything on the
Pentagon Papers investigation."
Clipping File
The report said Ehrlichman noted
that he himself maintained a

newspaper clipping file on the
Pentagon Papers case. "This has been
sent to the presidential file, and Mr.
Ehrlichman assumed this material was
now in archives."
The report added that Ehrlichman
was asked about any probe regarding
the families of EUsberg and Russo.
