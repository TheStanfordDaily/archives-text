# Successful Symphony Performance
## 
### KEN DELONG 
On Wednesday last, the San
Francisco Symphony performed a
group of works that would cause
the eyebrows of any regular
concert goer to rise. Conspicuous
by its absence was any
meat-and-potatoes symphonic
piece of the kind normally
expected at a symphony concert.
The bulk of the program consisted
of relatively little-known early
works by major composers.
The concert opened with a
performance of Darius Milhaud's
"Protee Symphonic Suite No. 2"
which was followed by Mozart's
"Violin Concerto No. 1" with
Isaac Stern as soloist. After
intermission Mr. Stern returned to
play the Prokofieff "Violin
Concerto No. 1." The concert
concluded with a performance of
Richard Strauss' "Dance of the
Seven Veils" from the opera
"Salome."
The music for "Protee" was
originally composed as incidental
music to accompany the play by
Paul Claudel. Unfortunately, the
play never reached performance,
so Milhaud revised the music to
form an independent symphonic
suite. Sandwiched between an
Overture and a Finale were three
short characteristic movements
titled "Prelude and Fugue,"
"Pastorale" and "Nocturne."
For this reviewer, it was the
most interesting work on the
program. In keeping with the
Greek setting of the play, the
music was filled with sprightly
folk-like rhythms and many
lyrically angular tunes, for the
most part scored for the
woodwinds. The wind players of
the orchestra under the direction
of Seiji Ozawa played expressively
and captured the elegance and
charm of the music.

Particularly outstanding were
the many flute solos played by
Paul Relnzi the principal flutist.
Musically the high point was the
"Pastorale," a movement in which
sophisticated Stravinsky-like
ostinatos formed the
background for a pseudo-Greek
folk melody, eventually rising to a
grand climax with exciting
polytonal fanfares in the brass.
Despite the Greek setting of
the play, much of the rhythmic
character of the music showed the
influence of Latin American
dance rhythms, especially the
"Habenera." Although the
influence of Debussy and
Stravinsky was clearly in evidence,
the style was still unmistakably
that of a lyrical and elegant
French composer, in short, Darius
Milhaud.
The first of Mozart's five violin
concertos shares with the second
the honor of being almost
completely neglected, and thus
it was a treat to have it
programmed for this evening. It is
a light and cheerful piece written
in the Italianate galant style so
much in evidence in Mozart's
early works.
The performance by Isaac
Stern was excellent, capturing the
superficial brilliance of the outer
movements as well as the
affectation of the middle adagio.
Of particular note was the
beautifully controlled light tone,
so suitable for eighteenth century
music.
Another joy was the
sympathetic and precisely played
orchestral accompaniment.
Although cadenza carping is an
easy game to play, it must be

mentioned that the style and
virtuosityof the cadenzas tended
to suggest Mendelssohn rather
than Mozart. Aside from this
small reservation, the concerto
was effectively performed and was
well received by the audience.
Lyrical Concerto
After intermission the concert
returned to the world of
quasi-tonality with a performance
of the Prokofieff "Violin
Concerto No. 1" with Isaac Stern
again as soloist. This concerto is
largely lyrical and romantic
in feeling and very different from
the percussive style he later
adopted.
It departs from concerto
tradition by having two
moderately paced outer
movements frame a fast one in the
middle. Although the program
notes suggested that Prokofieff
had abandoned the "usual
virtuosic style" and that there
were "no cadenzas or bravura
passages," the concerto is in fact
very difficult to play, especially in
the second movement with its
rapid runs and fingered octaves.
Here Mr. Stern's tone regained
its romantic warmth and
expressiveness. The elegiac first
movement with its high arching
melodic lines and intense
expression was beautifully
performed, setting the tone for
the whole concerto. The
vivacissimo middle movement was
filled with moto perpetuo
rhythms and ostinatos of t! .
type unfortunately associated
with establishment Soviet
composers, especially
Khachaturian.
Nevertheless, it did form an

energetic foil to the more lyrical
movements. Once again, Ozawa
and the orchestra provided a
fitting accompaniment for the
evenings distinguished soloist, and
the conclusion of the work found
many members of the audience
rising to their feet, clapping and
shouting their approval.
Avant Garde
With the production of
"Salome" in Dresden in 1905,
Richard Strauss established a
reputation as one of the most
avant garde and shocking
composers of the early twentieth
century. Although the subject
matterof the opera is still a source
of morbid fascination for present
day audiences, it is sometimes
hard to understand why the music

was such hold pill for a 1905
audience to swallow .
"The Dance of the Seven
Veils" is highly dramatic and
erotic. As one would expect, it is
colorfully orchestrated and is a
great show piece for orchestra and
conductor. From the opening
fanfare through the evocative
dances to the thrilling climax, it
was evident that this is a kind of
music with which Ozawa has a
special affinity.
The performance was showy
and very effective. It was clear
that the orchestra loved it, for
they played with obvious relish.
In all, it was an unusual yet
satisfying program, and the
evening was a success for
performers and audience alike.

small reservation, the concerto
was effectively performed and was
well received by the audience.
Lyrical Concerto
After intermission the concert
returned to the world of
quasi-tonality with a performance
of the Prokofieff "Violin
Concerto No. 1" with Isaac Stern
again as soloist. This concerto is
largely lyrical and romantic
in feeling and very different from
the percussive style he later
adopted.
It departs from concerto
tradition by having two
moderately paced outer
movements frame a fast one in the
middle. Although the program
notes suggested that Prokofieff
had abandoned the "usual
virtuosic style" and that there
were "no cadenzas or bravura
passages," the concerto is in fact
very difficult to play, especially in
the second movement with its
rapid runs and fingered octaves.
Here Mr. Stern's tone regained
its romantic warmth and
expressiveness. The elegiac first
movement with its high arching
melodic lines and intense
expression was beautifully
performed, setting the tone for
the whole concerto. The
vivacissimo middle movement was
filled with moto perpetuo
rhythms and ostinatos of t! .
type unfortunately associated
with establishment Soviet
composers, especially
Khachaturian.
Nevertheless, it did form an

energetic foil to the more lyrical
movements. Once again, Ozawa
and the orchestra provided a
fitting accompaniment for the
evenings distinguished soloist, and
the conclusion of the work found
many members of the audience
rising to their feet, clapping and
shouting their approval.
Avant Garde
With the production of
"Salome" in Dresden in 1905,
Richard Strauss established a
reputation as one of the most
avant garde and shocking
composers of the early twentieth
century. Although the subject
matterof the opera is still a source
of morbid fascination for present
day audiences, it is sometimes
hard to understand why the music

was such hold pill for a 1905
audience to swallow .
"The Dance of the Seven
Veils" is highly dramatic and
erotic. As one would expect, it is
colorfully orchestrated and is a
great show piece for orchestra and
conductor. From the opening
fanfare through the evocative
dances to the thrilling climax, it
was evident that this is a kind of
music with which Ozawa has a
special affinity.
The performance was showy
and very effective. It was clear
that the orchestra loved it, for
they played with obvious relish.
In all, it was an unusual yet
satisfying program, and the
evening was a success for
performers and audience alike.
On Wednesday last, the San
Francisco Symphony performed a
group of works that would cause
the eyebrows of any regular
concert goer to rise. Conspicuous
by its absence was any
meat-and-potatoes symphonic
piece of the kind normally
expected at a symphony concert.
The bulk of the program consisted
of relatively little-known early
works by major composers.
The concert opened with a
performance of Darius Milhaud's
"Protee Symphonic Suite No. 2"
which was followed by Mozart's
"Violin Concerto No. 1" with
Isaac Stern as soloist. After
intermission Mr. Stern returned to
play the Prokofieff "Violin
Concerto No. 1." The concert
concluded with a performance of
Richard Strauss' "Dance of the
Seven Veils" from the opera
"Salome."
The music for "Protee" was
originally composed as incidental
music to accompany the play by
Paul Claudel. Unfortunately, the
play never reached performance,
so Milhaud revised the music to
form an independent symphonic
suite. Sandwiched between an
Overture and a Finale were three
short characteristic movements
titled "Prelude and Fugue,"
"Pastorale" and "Nocturne."
For this reviewer, it was the
most interesting work on the
program. In keeping with the
Greek setting of the play, the
music was filled with sprightly
folk-like rhythms and many
lyrically angular tunes, for the
most part scored for the
woodwinds. The wind players of
the orchestra under the direction
of Seiji Ozawa played expressively
and captured the elegance and
charm of the music.

Particularly outstanding were
the many flute solos played by
Paul Relnzi the principal flutist.
Musically the high point was the
"Pastorale," a movement in which
sophisticated Stravinsky-like
ostinatos formed the
background for a pseudo-Greek
folk melody, eventually rising to a
grand climax with exciting
polytonal fanfares in the brass.
Despite the Greek setting of
the play, much of the rhythmic
character of the music showed the
influence of Latin American
dance rhythms, especially the
"Habenera." Although the
influence of Debussy and
Stravinsky was clearly in evidence,
the style was still unmistakably
that of a lyrical and elegant
French composer, in short, Darius
Milhaud.
The first of Mozart's five violin
concertos shares with the second
the honor of being almost
completely neglected, and thus
it was a treat to have it
programmed for this evening. It is
a light and cheerful piece written
in the Italianate galant style so
much in evidence in Mozart's
early works.
The performance by Isaac
Stern was excellent, capturing the
superficial brilliance of the outer
movements as well as the
affectation of the middle adagio.
Of particular note was the
beautifully controlled light tone,
so suitable for eighteenth century
music.
Another joy was the
sympathetic and precisely played
orchestral accompaniment.
Although cadenza carping is an
easy game to play, it must be

mentioned that the style and
virtuosityof the cadenzas tended
to suggest Mendelssohn rather
than Mozart. Aside from this
small reservation, the concerto
was effectively performed and was
well received by the audience.

play the Prokofieff "Violin
Concerto No. 1." The concert
concluded with a performance of
Richard Strauss' "Dance of the
Seven Veils" from the opera
"Salome."
The music for "Protee" was
originally composed as incidental
music to accompany the play by
Paul Claudel. Unfortunately, the
play never reached performance,
so Milhaud revised the music to
form an independent symphonic
suite. Sandwiched between an
Overture and a Finale were three
short characteristic movements
titled "Prelude and Fugue,"
"Pastorale" and "Nocturne."
For this reviewer, it was the
most interesting work on the
program. In keeping with the
Greek setting of the play, the
music was filled with sprightly
folk-like rhythms and many
lyrically angular tunes, for the
most part scored for the
woodwinds. The wind players of
the orchestra under the direction
of Seiji Ozawa played expressively
and captured the elegance and
charm of the music.

Particularly outstanding were
the many flute solos played by
Paul Relnzi the principal flutist.
Musically the high point was the
"Pastorale," a movement in which
sophisticated Stravinsky-like
ostinatos formed the
background for a pseudo-Greek
folk melody, eventually rising to a
grand climax with exciting
polytonal fanfares in the brass.
Despite the Greek setting of
the play, much of the rhythmic
character of the music showed the
influence of Latin American
dance rhythms, especially the
"Habenera." Although the
influence of Debussy and
Stravinsky was clearly in evidence,
the style was still unmistakably
that of a lyrical and elegant
French composer, in short, Darius
Milhaud.
The first of Mozart's five violin
concertos shares with the second
the honor of being almost
completely neglected, and thus
it was a treat to have it
programmed for this evening. It is
a light and cheerful piece written
in the Italianate galant style so
much in evidence in Mozart's
early works.
The performance by Isaac
Stern was excellent, capturing the
superficial brilliance of the outer
movements as well as the
affectation of the middle adagio.
Of particular note was the
beautifully controlled light tone,
so suitable for eighteenth century
music.
Another joy was the
sympathetic and precisely played
orchestral accompaniment.
Although cadenza carping is an
easy game to play, it must be

mentioned that the style and
virtuosityof the cadenzas tended
to suggest Mendelssohn rather
than Mozart. Aside from this
small reservation, the concerto
was effectively performed and was
well received by the audience.
Lyrical Concerto
After intermission the concert
returned to the world of
quasi-tonality with a performance
of the Prokofieff "Violin
Concerto No. 1" with Isaac Stern
again as soloist. This concerto is
largely lyrical and romantic
in feeling and very different from
the percussive style he later
adopted.
It departs from concerto
tradition by having two
moderately paced outer
movements frame a fast one in the
middle. Although the program
notes suggested that Prokofieff
had abandoned the "usual
virtuosic style" and that there
were "no cadenzas or bravura
passages," the concerto is in fact
very difficult to play, especially in
the second movement with its
rapid runs and fingered octaves.
Here Mr. Stern's tone regained
its romantic warmth and
expressiveness. The elegiac first
movement with its high arching
melodic lines and intense
expression was beautifully
performed, setting the tone for
the whole concerto. The
vivacissimo middle movement was
filled with moto perpetuo
rhythms and ostinatos of t! .
type unfortunately associated
with establishment Soviet
composers, especially
Khachaturian.
Nevertheless, it did form an

energetic foil to the more lyrical
movements. Once again, Ozawa
and the orchestra provided a
fitting accompaniment for the
evenings distinguished soloist, and
the conclusion of the work found
many members of the audience
rising to their feet, clapping and
shouting their approval.
Avant Garde
With the production of
"Salome" in Dresden in 1905,
Richard Strauss established a
reputation as one of the most
avant garde and shocking
composers of the early twentieth
century. Although the subject
matterof the opera is still a source
of morbid fascination for present
day audiences, it is sometimes
hard to understand why the music

was such hold pill for a 1905
audience to swallow .
"The Dance of the Seven
Veils" is highly dramatic and
erotic. As one would expect, it is
colorfully orchestrated and is a
great show piece for orchestra and
conductor. From the opening
fanfare through the evocative
dances to the thrilling climax, it
was evident that this is a kind of
music with which Ozawa has a
special affinity.
The performance was showy
and very effective. It was clear
that the orchestra loved it, for
they played with obvious relish.
In all, it was an unusual yet
satisfying program, and the
evening was a success for
performers and audience alike.
On Wednesday last, the San
Francisco Symphony performed a
group of works that would cause
the eyebrows of any regular
concert goer to rise. Conspicuous
by its absence was any
meat-and-potatoes symphonic
piece of the kind normally
expected at a symphony concert.
The bulk of the program consisted
of relatively little-known early
works by major composers.
The concert opened with a
performance of Darius Milhaud's
"Protee Symphonic Suite No. 2"
which was followed by Mozart's
"Violin Concerto No. 1" with
Isaac Stern as soloist. After
