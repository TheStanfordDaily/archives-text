# Jeff Beck Delights Winterland Audience
## 
### ROB PIKE 
Jeff Beck proved that he is one
of the finest rock guitarists
around last weekend to an
enthusiastic Winterland audience.
His new group now contains only
three men, including Tim Bogert
on bass guitar, and Carmine
Appice on drums.
These two have played
together before, originally in
Vanilla Fudge, later in Cactus. On
Saturday, playing songs from their
first joint album, along with some
old Beck numbers, they set the
crowd to shaking.
As the group walked onto the
darkened stage, the audience
roared in anticipation, and they
were not disappointed. From out
of the darkness the eerie sound of
Beck's electronically modified
voice began "Superstition." As
lights poured color on the stage,
Beck, Bogert, and Appice

assaulted the crowd with powerful
strokes of guitars and drums.
After the first few songs, which
featured Beck's fluid playing and
a tightly coordinated
accompaniment, the capacity
crowd settled down to hear some
fine music, "I'm So Proud" being
one of the better numbers. The
group then played a powerful
version of "Morning Dew" from
Beck's first album that brought
the crowd to its feet again and
they did not sit down until the
end of an excellent drum solo by
Appice.
They then played some fast
blues in which Bogert played lead
riffs intermingled with outrageous
bass lines, all on the bass guitar.
An idea of what it was like can be
found on the live side of Vanilla
Fudge's "Near The Beginning"
album. Having demonstrated that
each man could get amazing
things out of his own instrument,
the band broke into "You Shook
Me," a thunderous blues song,
which they ended in the LSJUIVB
style with the theme from the
"Beverly Hillbillies." They rocked
on to a two encore finish, playing
"Shotgun," "Going Down," and
one of the best boogies I've ever
heard.
One of the interesting features
of the evening was the use of a
television system which projected

the group onto a large screen
behind the stage. I hope
Winterland continues to use it, as
it makes the concert more
enjoyable, especially for the late
arrivals who end up in the rafters.
Also, they played video tapes
of other concerts. On Saturday, it
was Curtis Mayfield and Alice
Cooper. The latter tape ended
with Cooper being hung. The
audience loved it.
Also on the bill were Wet
Willie, who had finished their set
by the time I got to Winterland,
and Black Oak Arkansas, a self
proclaimed "hard, bad, and
nasty" rock group. Black Oak
Arkansas generally suffered from
poor acoustics and a glut of
guitars. For the most part they
lived up to their claim, singing
songs about how hard-assed and
horny the} were, "Hot Rod"
being a prominent example.
However, they did manage to
produce a few good numbers,
notably "Monster."
The drummer played a
tremendous solo which lea 1 into a
spectacular guitar-smashing
When called back for an en* "re,
they did a rousing capella
rendition of "Dixie." It seems
that a humorous twist goes over
big at Winterland. Hmm. Do you
think Bill Graham would be
intersted in the Incomparables?
