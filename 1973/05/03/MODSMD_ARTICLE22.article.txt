Agnew Added To Policy Board
WASHINGTON — President Nixon has added Vice
President Spiro T. Agnew to his domestic policy apparatus
and assigned staff veterans to fill temporarily vacancies
created by Watergate-related resignations.
Press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler said yesterday that
Agnew, whose role within the administration had
seemingly been reduced as part of Nixon's second-term
reorganization, has been designated vice chairman of the
Domestic Council.
Ziegler said this would give Agnew "a broadened
role ... in domestic policy formulation."
However, it was learned that the President outlined at a
Cabinet meeting Tuesday a stop-gap plan for permitting a
continuation of normal administration business pending a
rebuilding of his top staff.
At the news briefing, Ziegler acknowledged that Nixon
had expressed displeasure at the Cabinet meeting over a
Tuesday Senate resolution urging him to seek Senate
confirmation of a nominee from outside the executive
branch to serve as a special prosecutor to take charge of
the Watergate investigation.
The White House spokesman said Nixon felt the action,
taken by voice vote with only five senators present, might
be regarded as reflecting ill on "the responsibility and
integrity" of Elliot L. Richardson, the President's
nominee to be attorney general who already has taken
over direction of federal inquiries into the Watergate
burglary and subsequent cover-up.
Connally Switches To GOP
HOUSTON — John B. Connally, friend and adviser to
three presidents, formally switched from the Democratic
to the Republican party yesterday. But he skillfully
maneuvered around speculation he wants to be a
candidate for president in 1976.
"I seek no office, political or appointive," said
Connally, adding that he has not discussed any White
House or Cabinet vacancies with President Nixon.
"I must say that I don't want to go to the point of
going up there (Washington) again," he said. "I haven't
been out of there long enough to suit us."
Connally, 56, said the Democratic party he had
supported all his life "has moved so far left that it has left
the majority of Americans who occupy the great middle
ground of political thought in this country."
"It's in that broad middle ground that we're going to
find the solutions to most of the problems that we have."
There had been speculation about a possible
Democratic presidential nomination for the former Texas
governor even after he served some 18 months as Nixon's
secretary of the treasury.
The speculation switched to the Republican party
when he took the reigns of the Democrats for Nixon
Committee.
Berkeley Council 'Hosts' Smoke-In
BERKELEY — A city council resolution to investigate the
legal status of Berkeley's pro-marijuana ordinance signaled
a noisy demonstration amid loud jeers and the heavy smell
of pot.
"Smoke that joint!" shouted some in the overflow
crowd of 200 Tuesday night as they dragged away on
marijuana cigarettes. There were no arrests.
The session dissolved in weed-clouded chaos after
another 350 persons, kept outside because of fire laws,
stormed the meeting during a recess.
Berkeley voters overwhelmingly approved an initiative
April 17 calling for police to give the lowest priority to
enforcing laws against smoking, possessing and growing

marijuana. But law officers said the ordinance did not
affect them as they are guided by state law.
The council approved 5-1 a motion by Wilmont
Sweeney to determine legality of the successful initiative.
The council voted down a counter resolution by newly
elected radical Ying Lee Kelley to order police to comply
with the new ordinance and let up on violators.
"The Berkeley Marijuana Initiative has been effectively
negated," declared Councilwoman Ilona Hancock after
the Sweeney resolution was passed. "It is not up to us as a
city council to decide between the various legal opinions."
Helicopters Attacked Over Vietnam
SAIGON — Two peace-keeping helicopters were fired at
over Viet Cong-held territory yesterday and American
bombers pounded enemy troops in Cambodia for the
ninth straight day.
The helicopter incident in northern South Vietnam
generated charges that the Communists have failed to
guarantee security and adequate working conditions for
the International Commission of Control and Supervision.
The helicopters were not hit and there were no
casualties.
But an exchange of civilian prisoners between the
Saigon government and the Viet Cong was suspended and
some members of the four-nation peace-keeping
commission proposed closing down three field observation
sites.
A Viet Cong communique on the helicopter incident
acknowledged that Communist forces fired on an aircraft
below the demilitarized zone in the same area that the
two peacekeeping helicopters ran into fire.
But the communique said the Viet Cong target was an
American reconnaissance aircraft flying through a safety
corridor set aside for the peacekeeping helicopters.
There was no immediate comment from U.S. officials,
who have, however, acknowledged American
reconnaissance flights over South Vietnam since the
cease-fire went into effect Jan. 28.
The helicopters, each with two-man American civilian
crews under a commission contract with Air America,
returned to Quang Tri City about five minutes after
takeoff.
More Rain Swells River
ST. LOUIS — Heavy new rainfalls are expected to bring
another series of crests to northern sections of the
flood-swollen Mississippi River. Southern areas are braced
for the onslaught of high waters already headed down the
river.
Almost two months of high waters has shut down the
upper Mississippi to commercial traffic, flooded an
estimated 11 million acres in seven states and caused some
$322 million in damages, not counting future losses to
farmers unable to plant their crops.
Eleven flood-related deaths have been reported, and an
estimated 35,000 persons are homeless in Wisconsin,
Missouri, Illinois, Ohio, Arkansas, Louisiana and
Mississippi.
Illinois and Missouri were both drenched with
thunderstorms, and the National Weather Service
Wednesday said preliminary reports indicate new crests
can be expected along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers
within coming days.
Today's Weather
Mostly cloudy with chance of drizzle this morning. Partly
cloudy this afternoon and tonight then clearing
tomorrow. Lows both nights mid 40s to low 50s. Highs
both days upper 50s and 60s. Westerly winds 10 to 20
mph afternoons.

crowd of 200 Tuesday night as they dragged away on
marijuana cigarettes. There were no arrests.
The session dissolved in weed-clouded chaos after
another 350 persons, kept outside because of fire laws,
stormed the meeting during a recess.
Berkeley voters overwhelmingly approved an initiative
April 17 calling for police to give the lowest priority to
enforcing laws against smoking, possessing and growing

marijuana. But law officers said the ordinance did not
affect them as they are guided by state law.
The council approved 5-1 a motion by Wilmont
Sweeney to determine legality of the successful initiative.
The council voted down a counter resolution by newly
elected radical Ying Lee Kelley to order police to comply
with the new ordinance and let up on violators.
"The Berkeley Marijuana Initiative has been effectively
negated," declared Councilwoman Ilona Hancock after
the Sweeney resolution was passed. "It is not up to us as a
city council to decide between the various legal opinions."
Helicopters Attacked Over Vietnam
SAIGON — Two peace-keeping helicopters were fired at
over Viet Cong-held territory yesterday and American
bombers pounded enemy troops in Cambodia for the
ninth straight day.
The helicopter incident in northern South Vietnam
generated charges that the Communists have failed to
guarantee security and adequate working conditions for
the International Commission of Control and Supervision.
The helicopters were not hit and there were no
casualties.
But an exchange of civilian prisoners between the
Saigon government and the Viet Cong was suspended and
some members of the four-nation peace-keeping
commission proposed closing down three field observation
sites.
A Viet Cong communique on the helicopter incident
acknowledged that Communist forces fired on an aircraft
below the demilitarized zone in the same area that the
two peacekeeping helicopters ran into fire.
But the communique said the Viet Cong target was an
American reconnaissance aircraft flying through a safety
corridor set aside for the peacekeeping helicopters.
There was no immediate comment from U.S. officials,
who have, however, acknowledged American
reconnaissance flights over South Vietnam since the
cease-fire went into effect Jan. 28.
The helicopters, each with two-man American civilian
crews under a commission contract with Air America,
returned to Quang Tri City about five minutes after
takeoff.
More Rain Swells River
ST. LOUIS — Heavy new rainfalls are expected to bring
another series of crests to northern sections of the
flood-swollen Mississippi River. Southern areas are braced
for the onslaught of high waters already headed down the
river.
Almost two months of high waters has shut down the
upper Mississippi to commercial traffic, flooded an
estimated 11 million acres in seven states and caused some
$322 million in damages, not counting future losses to
farmers unable to plant their crops.
Eleven flood-related deaths have been reported, and an
estimated 35,000 persons are homeless in Wisconsin,
Missouri, Illinois, Ohio, Arkansas, Louisiana and
Mississippi.
Illinois and Missouri were both drenched with
thunderstorms, and the National Weather Service
Wednesday said preliminary reports indicate new crests
can be expected along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers
within coming days.
Today's Weather
Mostly cloudy with chance of drizzle this morning. Partly
cloudy this afternoon and tonight then clearing
tomorrow. Lows both nights mid 40s to low 50s. Highs
both days upper 50s and 60s. Westerly winds 10 to 20
mph afternoons.
Agnew Added To Policy Board
WASHINGTON — President Nixon has added Vice
President Spiro T. Agnew to his domestic policy apparatus
and assigned staff veterans to fill temporarily vacancies
created by Watergate-related resignations.
Press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler said yesterday that
Agnew, whose role within the administration had
seemingly been reduced as part of Nixon's second-term
reorganization, has been designated vice chairman of the
Domestic Council.
Ziegler said this would give Agnew "a broadened
role ... in domestic policy formulation."
However, it was learned that the President outlined at a
Cabinet meeting Tuesday a stop-gap plan for permitting a
continuation of normal administration business pending a
rebuilding of his top staff.
At the news briefing, Ziegler acknowledged that Nixon
had expressed displeasure at the Cabinet meeting over a
Tuesday Senate resolution urging him to seek Senate
confirmation of a nominee from outside the executive
branch to serve as a special prosecutor to take charge of
the Watergate investigation.
The White House spokesman said Nixon felt the action,
taken by voice vote with only five senators present, might
be regarded as reflecting ill on "the responsibility and
integrity" of Elliot L. Richardson, the President's
nominee to be attorney general who already has taken
over direction of federal inquiries into the Watergate
burglary and subsequent cover-up.
Connally Switches To GOP
HOUSTON — John B. Connally, friend and adviser to
three presidents, formally switched from the Democratic
to the Republican party yesterday. But he skillfully
maneuvered around speculation he wants to be a
candidate for president in 1976.
"I seek no office, political or appointive," said
Connally, adding that he has not discussed any White
House or Cabinet vacancies with President Nixon.
"I must say that I don't want to go to the point of
going up there (Washington) again," he said. "I haven't
been out of there long enough to suit us."
Connally, 56, said the Democratic party he had
supported all his life "has moved so far left that it has left
the majority of Americans who occupy the great middle
ground of political thought in this country."
"It's in that broad middle ground that we're going to
find the solutions to most of the problems that we have."
There had been speculation about a possible
Democratic presidential nomination for the former Texas
governor even after he served some 18 months as Nixon's
secretary of the treasury.
The speculation switched to the Republican party
when he took the reigns of the Democrats for Nixon
Committee.

estimated 35,000 persons are homeless in Wisconsin,
Missouri, Illinois, Ohio, Arkansas, Louisiana and
Mississippi.
Illinois and Missouri were both drenched with
thunderstorms, and the National Weather Service
Wednesday said preliminary reports indicate new crests
can be expected along the Missouri and Mississippi rivers
within coming days.
Today's Weather
Mostly cloudy with chance of drizzle this morning. Partly
cloudy this afternoon and tonight then clearing

Agnew Added To Policy Board
WASHINGTON — President Nixon has added Vice
President Spiro T. Agnew to his domestic policy apparatus
and assigned staff veterans to fill temporarily vacancies
created by Watergate-related resignations.
Press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler said yesterday that
Agnew, whose role within the administration had
seemingly been reduced as part of Nixon's second-term
reorganization, has been designated vice chairman of the
Domestic Council.
Ziegler said this would give Agnew "a broadened
role ... in domestic policy formulation."
However, it was learned that the President outlined at a
Cabinet meeting Tuesday a stop-gap plan for permitting a
continuation of normal administration business pending a
rebuilding of his top staff.
At the news briefing, Ziegler acknowledged that Nixon
had expressed displeasure at the Cabinet meeting over a
Tuesday Senate resolution urging him to seek Senate
confirmation of a nominee from outside the executive
branch to serve as a special prosecutor to take charge of
the Watergate investigation.
The White House spokesman said Nixon felt the action,
taken by voice vote with only five senators present, might
be regarded as reflecting ill on "the responsibility and
integrity" of Elliot L. Richardson, the President's
nominee to be attorney general who already has taken
over direction of federal inquiries into the Watergate
burglary and subsequent cover-up.
Connally Switches To GOP
HOUSTON — John B. Connally, friend and adviser to
three presidents, formally switched from the Democratic
to the Republican party yesterday. But he skillfully
maneuvered around speculation he wants to be a
candidate for president in 1976.
"I seek no office, political or appointive," said
Connally, adding that he has not discussed any White
House or Cabinet vacancies with President Nixon.
"I must say that I don't want to go to the point of
going up there (Washington) again," he said. "I haven't
been out of there long enough to suit us."
Connally, 56, said the Democratic party he had
supported all his life "has moved so far left that it has left
the majority of Americans who occupy the great middle
ground of political thought in this country."
"It's in that broad middle ground that we're going to
find the solutions to most of the problems that we have."
There had been speculation about a possible
Democratic presidential nomination for the former Texas
governor even after he served some 18 months as Nixon's
secretary of the treasury.
The speculation switched to the Republican party
when he took the reigns of the Democrats for Nixon
Committee.
Berkeley Council 'Hosts' Smoke-In
BERKELEY — A city council resolution to investigate the
legal status of Berkeley's pro-marijuana ordinance signaled
a noisy demonstration amid loud jeers and the heavy smell
of pot.
"Smoke that joint!" shouted some in the overflow
crowd of 200 Tuesday night as they dragged away on
marijuana cigarettes. There were no arrests.
The session dissolved in weed-clouded chaos after
another 350 persons, kept outside because of fire laws,
stormed the meeting during a recess.
Berkeley voters overwhelmingly approved an initiative
April 17 calling for police to give the lowest priority to
enforcing laws against smoking, possessing and growing

marijuana. But law officers said the ordinance did not
affect them as they are guided by state law.
The council approved 5-1 a motion by Wilmont
Sweeney to determine legality of the successful initiative.
The council voted down a counter resolution by newly
elected radical Ying Lee Kelley to order police to comply
with the new ordinance and let up on violators.
"The Berkeley Marijuana Initiative has been effectively
negated," declared Councilwoman Ilona Hancock after
the Sweeney resolution was passed. "It is not up to us as a
city council to decide between the various legal opinions."
Helicopters Attacked Over Vietnam
SAIGON — Two peace-keeping helicopters were fired at
over Viet Cong-held territory yesterday and American
bombers pounded enemy troops in Cambodia for the
ninth straight day.
The helicopter incident in northern South Vietnam
generated charges that the Communists have failed to
guarantee security and adequate working conditions for
the International Commission of Control and Supervision.
The helicopters were not hit and there were no
casualties.
But an exchange of civilian prisoners between the
Saigon government and the Viet Cong was suspended and
some members of the four-nation peace-keeping
commission proposed closing down three field observation
sites.
A Viet Cong communique on the helicopter incident
acknowledged that Communist forces fired on an aircraft
below the demilitarized zone in the same area that the
two peacekeeping helicopters ran into fire.
But the communique said the Viet Cong target was an
American reconnaissance aircraft flying through a safety
corridor set aside for the peacekeeping helicopters.
There was no immediate comment from U.S. officials,
who have, however, acknowledged American
reconnaissance flights over South Vietnam since the
cease-fire went into effect Jan. 28.
The helicopters, each with two-man American civilian
crews under a commission contract with Air America,
returned to Quang Tri City about five minutes after
takeoff.
More Rain Swells River
ST. LOUIS — Heavy new rainfalls are expected to bring
another series of crests to northern sections of the
flood-swollen Mississippi River. Southern areas are braced
for the onslaught of high waters already headed down the
river.
Almost two months of high waters has shut down the
upper Mississippi to commercial traffic, flooded an
estimated 11 million acres in seven states and caused some
$322 million in damages, not counting future losses to
farmers unable to plant their crops.
Eleven flood-related deaths have been reported, and an
estimated 35,000 persons are homeless in Wisconsin,
Missouri, Illinois, Ohio, Arkansas, Louisiana and
Mississippi.
