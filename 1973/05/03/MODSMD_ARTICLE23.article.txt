# Campus Cool To Nixon Speech
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
"Checkers: Where are you now that
I need you? — R. Nixon."
This phrase, which is the latest
addition to the graffiti on the Law
School fence, reflects the attitude of
many students and faculty towards the
President's recent speech about
Watergate and other issues.
As more knowledge is being made
available to the public, it appears
people are becoming increasingly
dissatisfied with the administration's
handling of the incident.
Political Science Prof. Hubert
Marshall is highly critical of Nixon's
efforts in this matter. "He's delayed
too long," Marshall said. "To assign a
man like [John W.] Dean [111, former
Counsel to the President, who was
fired Monday] to look into the matter
was not enough ... At no time did
Nixon seek a genuine investigation."
Marshall remarked that Nixon's
speech was designed "to throw dust in
our eyes." He added that "the purpose
[of the speech] was to salvage as much
as he could out of a situation that was
getting out of hand."
Sincere President
Law Prof. Jack Friedenthal said he
believes "The President is sincere in
getting the whole thing cleared up."
He hoped that recently nominated
Attorney General Elliot Richardson
would appoint an outside prosecutor
to handle the case.
However, Friedenthal said that one
cannot blame the public for its loss of
confidence. "Nixon used the speech to
restore the public's confidence in
him... [He] took the responsibility
on his own shoulders."
The professor added that "Nixon
must have been pretty embarrassed to
be in the position he was in .. . finding
out that two of his top men were
involved in this type of incident."
'Stood In The Way'
Political Science Prof. Richard
Brody said that Nixon "Stood in the
way of the process, but facts came out
nonetheless.... Almost against his
will, he was forced to open up."

In his speech, Nixon tried "to
maximumly disassociate himself from
the case," Brody claimed. He guessed
that reaction to the speech would be
"highly partisan."
ASSU co-president Beth Garfield
agreed with this opinion. "A majority
of the public doesn't want to think
they have a president they can't
trust," she said. Some people believe
"He's our president so he must be
right."
Friend Disagrees
Jim Friend, ASSU co-president did
not agree with Garfield. "I tend to
think the issue will be exploited. The
speech exposed the President." Friend
predicted that there would be a good
deal of negative public reaction.
Freshman Beth Rhyne followed
Friend's thinking. "I am unhappy with
Nixon's handling of the affair," she
said. "Even a Nixon supporter I know
is disgusted with the situation."
Jill Klein, also a freshman, agreed

that most people are outraged with the
Watergate situation. She said that it is
an example of "Nixon's lack of
credibility." She added that the
President probably knew about the
break-in; if not before it took place,
then very soon after.

I need you? — R. Nixon."

on his own shoulders."
The professor added that "Nixon
must have been pretty embarrassed to
be in the position he was in .. . finding
out that two of his top men were
involved in this type of incident."
'Stood In The Way'
Political Science Prof. Richard
Brody said that Nixon "Stood in the
way of the process, but facts came out
nonetheless.... Almost against his
will, he was forced to open up."

In his speech, Nixon tried "to
maximumly disassociate himself from
the case," Brody claimed. He guessed
that reaction to the speech would be
"highly partisan."
ASSU co-president Beth Garfield
agreed with this opinion. "A majority
of the public doesn't want to think
they have a president they can't
trust," she said. Some people believe
"He's our president so he must be
right."
Friend Disagrees
Jim Friend, ASSU co-president did
not agree with Garfield. "I tend to
think the issue will be exploited. The
speech exposed the President." Friend
predicted that there would be a good
deal of negative public reaction.
Freshman Beth Rhyne followed
Friend's thinking. "I am unhappy with
Nixon's handling of the affair," she
said. "Even a Nixon supporter I know
is disgusted with the situation."
Jill Klein, also a freshman, agreed

that most people are outraged with the
Watergate situation. She said that it is
an example of "Nixon's lack of
credibility." She added that the
President probably knew about the
break-in; if not before it took place,
then very soon after.
"Checkers: Where are you now that
I need you? — R. Nixon."
This phrase, which is the latest
addition to the graffiti on the Law
School fence, reflects the attitude of
many students and faculty towards the
President's recent speech about
Watergate and other issues.
As more knowledge is being made
available to the public, it appears
people are becoming increasingly
dissatisfied with the administration's
handling of the incident.
Political Science Prof. Hubert
Marshall is highly critical of Nixon's
efforts in this matter. "He's delayed
too long," Marshall said. "To assign a
man like [John W.] Dean [111, former
Counsel to the President, who was
fired Monday] to look into the matter
was not enough ... At no time did
Nixon seek a genuine investigation."
Marshall remarked that Nixon's
speech was designed "to throw dust in
our eyes." He added that "the purpose
[of the speech] was to salvage as much
as he could out of a situation that was
getting out of hand."
Sincere President
Law Prof. Jack Friedenthal said he
believes "The President is sincere in
getting the whole thing cleared up."
He hoped that recently nominated
Attorney General Elliot Richardson
would appoint an outside prosecutor
to handle the case.
However, Friedenthal said that one
cannot blame the public for its loss of
confidence. "Nixon used the speech to
restore the public's confidence in
him... [He] took the responsibility
on his own shoulders."
The professor added that "Nixon
must have been pretty embarrassed to
be in the position he was in .. . finding
out that two of his top men were
involved in this type of incident."
