# Grad Student Perishes During Fire At Home
## 
### 
John Stephen Turk, a terminal
graduate student in physics here, was
killed last night when a fire gutted his
rented, frame house in unincorporated
San Mateo County.
Pending an autopsy, Assistant
Stanford Fire Chief John Barr said
Turk had apparently died of smoke
inhalation. But Associate Dean of
Student Affairs Dan Williams said the
San Mateo County Coroner had found
a towel wrapped around Turk's neck
and wires around his body. According
to Williams, the coroner said this was
"very odd."
Turk lived alone just off of Alpine
Road at 11 Happy Hollow Lane, less
than two miles from the central
campus. A neighbor said Turk had
been employed at the Plasma Physics
Laboratory and was preparing a

doctoral dissertation on astrophysics.
Turk's landlady, who lives in an
adjoining house, called the fire
department at about 7:10 p.m.
According to a Stanford Fire
Department spokesman, the first
engine arrived at 7:16 p.m. and the
blaze was quickly extinguished. It had
gutted most of Turk's home.
" The Stanford Fire Department
responded to the scene on the basis of
a mutual aid agreement with the State
Division of Forestry, whose engines
are not able to reach the area as
quickly as are Stanford's.
Another neighbor said he pulled
Turk's smoke-blackened body out of
the still-burning house at about the
same time as the landlady called in the
alarm. When interviewed, he made no
mention of the towel and wires found
around Turk's body by the coroner.
Other bystanders said two
neighbors had visited Turk about 10
minutes before the fire started.
