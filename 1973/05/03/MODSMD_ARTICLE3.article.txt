# City Council Race Raises Local Concerns
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
The Palo Alto City Council race is
heating up, with less than a week until
the May 8 election.
The voters will choose six Council
members from 18 candidates — one
for a two-year term, and five for
four-year terms.
Several candidates of the more
business-oriented Palo Alto '73 (PA73)
slate have accused the more liberal
Association for a Balanced
Community (ABC) slate of paying too
much attention to radicals and not
enough to persons of more moderate
persuasions.
In return, several ABC and radical
Palo Alto Community Coalition
(PACC) candidates say that the PA73
slate are the tools of large real-estate
developers and industrialists who want
new commercial and industrial firms in
the city.
18 Candidates
The PA73 candidates are Vice
Mayor Stanley Norton, Councilmen
John V. Beahrs and John J. Berwald,
and non-incumbents Roy Clay, Elvia
Garwood, and Anne R. Witherspoon.

ABC is offering Mayor Kirke
Comstock, Councilwoman Sylvia
Seman, former Councilman Byron D.
Sher, and non-incumbents Emily
Renzel, Tom Passell, and Allan Seid.
The PACC slate consists of Douglas
Mattern, Jeffrey Youdelman, Carol
Peterson, and John Philo. All are
non-incumbents, as are the two
independent candidates affiliated with
no slate — John D. Snow and Bob
Cullenbine.
Free Spirit
Each group of running mates does
not agree on everything. The most
prominent free spirit is Garwood, the
most liberal of PA73's candidates. She
just missed getting ABC's endorsement
as well.
The present Council consists of five
ABC members, three of whom are
holdovers who need not face the
voters this year, and four members
with PA73 sympathies, one of whom
is retiring from office.
Beahrs, Berwald, Norton,
Witherspoon, and Clay have attacked
the record of the present Council,
charging that it spends too much time

on national and international issues
beyond its competence, that it
tolerates meeting disruptions by
radicals, and that it devotes too much
money to experimental social
programs of questionable merit.
Furthermore, they say, it is hostile
to business and industry, it appoints
citizen committees which
overrepresent the left side of the
political spectrum, and it forces the
city's staff to waste time studying
insignificant proposals.
Juvenile Anarchists
During the past week, the intensity
of their rhetoric has increased.
Berwald pointed out that "I'm not
interested in doing battle night after
night with juvenile anarchists
encouraged by a Council majority."
Witherspoon last week accused the
present Council of doing a "miserable
job" and "compounding
mismanagement with hypocrisy."
Cullenbine, an independent
candidate who fits between PACC and
ABC on the political spectrum, has led
the counter-attack against PA73. He
cites a $3500 low-interest loan to

PA73 guaranteed by former Mayor
Jack Wheatley, a partner in a
construction company and real estate
development firm, as evidence that
"PA73 is a front for and beholden to
Jack Wheatley.
"Wheatley needs a Council that will
turn its back on the
environment... If PA73 wins,
Wheatley's future profits are safe,"
Cullenbine asserts.
Open Space
The dominant emphasis of ABC's
campaign has been their record in
preserving open space and the
residential character of the city. Along
with Cullenbine, the ABC candidates
insist that a PA7 3 victory will open
the door for more commercial and
industrial development in the city,
while they (ABC) will seek to preserve
Palo Alto's residential character.
The Community Coalition
candidates alternately attack PA73 for
its ties to business and industry, and
turn their fire on ABC, which they call
unresponsive, paternalistic, and given
to talk, not action, on social programs.
They claim that it was they (the
Coalition) who first brought up the
issues on which ABC is now running,
and that once again this year they are
ahead of the other slates as they stress
rent control, child care, and collective
bargaining for city employees.
Snow, who calls himself "the

common man's candidate," also
criticizes many of the current
Council's social programs. He urges
enlarging the police force, and
spending more on utility and street
maintenance.
Renzel and Clay are seeking the
two-year term; the other 16 candidates
are running at-large for the five
four-year terms.
