# 35 Picketers Protest Phi Delt Stripper Raffle
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
About 35 demonstrators picketed the Phi Delta Theta
house yesterday afternoon and argued for over an hour
with fraternity members about a house party two weeks
ago where a stripper was raffled off.
The Phi Delts are currently under investigation by the
University as well as the California Alcoholic Beverage
Commission due to a result of the party.
The demonstrators, mostly womt.i, carried picket signs
and a banner reading "Public Sale Of Human Beings:
Lowest Form Of Degradation" while they chanted
"two-four-six-eight, try Phi Delt and sell your date."
They arrived at the house shortly before 5 p.m. and
didn't leave until after 6 p.m. There was no violence
during the demonstration, although tempers ran hot at
times.
Water Balloon
About 30 men, some of them Phi Delts, came out to
watch the picket line and argue with the demonstrators.
At one point someone threw a water balloon at the group,
but it fell short.
"I don't want people to think Stanford University
condones what went on here," Betsy Jameson, one of the
picketers, told Bob Major, Phi Delt president. She claimed
the fraternity's members were "the same sort of people
that watch hundreds of thousands of human beings
slaughtered and don't say anything."
She said the raffle was "sexist exploitation."
Jameson said she wanted the University to eject the Phi
Delts from campus, and claimed the University set a
precedent for such action when it severed athletic
relations with Brigham Young University in 1971 in
disapproval of Mormon racial policies.
The Phi Delts were suspended from campus for a year

in 1966 after a series of incidents including a wild party
with girls from Mills College in Oakland.
'No Victims'
"Do you object to people doing what they want?"
Major asked. "There were no victims."
"I was a victim!" one demonstrator shouted. "It
offends our dignity as women," another, senior Sally
Flocks, said.
"If there were an Uncle Tom black, and he offered to
sell himself into slavery, would that be alright?" she
continued.
"Race questions transcend other things," Major
replied. "It [the raffle] was in bad taste ... I don't think
someone should be publicly auctioned off... but if
someone wants to do something and it doesn't hurt
anyone, I don't think you can limit their choices."
Apology
Throughout the heated session, he maintained that the
stripper proposed the raffle and that a number of the Phi
Delts had objected to it. Later he offered an apology "to
any Stanford woman who was offended."
Major also claimed the Phi Delts were "getting an
unfair reputation as the animal house. All houses do this.
What do you think they have for entertainment in
Roble?"
"Does widespread sexism justify specific sexist
actions?" a demonstrator shot back.
"We don't want such human degradation at
Stanford ... it's just horrible," Jameson added.
Major several times accused the press of blowing up the
raffle incident. "Could I give you a graphic description of
the 1966 party? Would that satisfy your morbid
curiosity?" he snapped at one reporter.
