# SCIRE Head Seeks Grievance Hearing
## 
### JAMES LOBSENZ 
Ron Jones, the Director of the
Student Center for Innovation and
Research in Education (SCIRE), has
petitioned for a grievance hearing with
the Department of Personnel and
Employee Relations (DPER).
Jones was recently notified by
Dean of Undergraduate Studies James
L. Gibbs, that he would not be offered
another one year contract. His present
contract expires on June 30th.
Jones maintains that he is
answerable only to the SCIRE Policy
Board, and not to the Office of the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
(ODUS).
"When notified of my
employment," asserts Jones, "I was
informed by James L. Gibbs, that
'although this appointment is for one
year, I note your willingness to serve
two years if, at the end of this year,
you and the Policy Board mutually
agree that this would be desirable.'

"At no time during the past year,"
maintains Jones, "was it ever made
clear to me that I was under the
direction of anyone other than the
Policy Board."
Furthermore, Jones claims that in a
formal review of the SCIRE program
authored by Assistant Dean of
Undergraduate Studies Michael
Closson, the role of the Policy Board
was said to include "being responsible
for the overall operation of the
program, including the functioning of
the director and the staff."
Policy Board
Jones points out that the present
Policy Board has unanimously
supported him, and spoken out in
favor of retaining him as director.
Gibbs has asserted that although he
is aware of the Policy Board's support
of Jones, he has felt it necessary to
refuse Jones another contract on the
grounds of "administrative
deficiencies," and repeated failures of
Jones to operate according to the
"procedures and regulations that all
departments at Stanford are subject
to."
In another development, the SCIRE
Policy Board has written a letter to the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies
(C-US) requesting that the committee
act as an arbitrator in the dispute
between the Policy Board and ODUS.
The letter states a willingness to accept
any decision of C-US as final.
Grievance Petition
Emil J. Sarpa, the director of the
DPER, has outlined the procedure that
is now to be followed in regard to the
grievance petition.
"My first task," states Sarpa, "is to
determine whether or not a 'Level I'
confrontation has occurred. That is, an
actual face to face meeting between
Gibbs and Jones." If possible Sarpa
would like to see the matter resolved
at this lower level.
But Jones asserts that such a
meeting has taken place, and that
"phase I had been completed." Jones
believes that at that level the issues are
unresolvable.
Level II
The next step, 'Level ll' as Sarpa
calls it, is to send the matter to the
Provost's Office for an informal
hearing to be conducted either by the
Provost William Miller, or his
designated assistant.
If such an informal hearing decides
against Jones, then the matter will
reach Level 111. "In that case," states
Sarpa, "I would recommend to
President Lyman that one of our five
outside arbitrators be called in to
make an absolute and final decision."
At present, the next major step
would appear to be a decision made by
the Provost's Office, where it must be
decided if Gibbs actually has the
authority to deny Jones another
contract.
Arbitration
The arbitration requested of C-US
by the Policy Board will be primarily
concerned with more general matters
concerning the lines of authority
between ODUS and the SCIRE Policy
Board, although the specific issue of
retaining Jones may be brought up
there too, should C-US decide to
arbitrate the matter.
It is also possible that should C-US
decide to arbitrate the matter,
conflicting or semi-conflicting verdicts
might be cast by C-US and the
grievance hearing apparatus. For
example, C-US might define the lines
of authority in such a way that Jones
might no longer wish to keep his job.
Looming on the horizon lies the
related issue of funding the program
for Urban Studies, which is scheduled
to be discussed in the near future.
Repercussions from the issues of
conflict between SCIRE and ODUS
may reach this area also.

calls it, is to send the matter to the

Sarpa, "I would recommend to

At present, the next major step
would appear to be a decision made by
the Provost's Office, where it must be
decided if Gibbs actually has the
authority to deny Jones another

Arbitration
The arbitration requested of C-US
by the Policy Board will be primarily
concerned with more general matters
concerning the lines of authority
between ODUS and the SCIRE Policy
Board, although the specific issue of
retaining Jones may be brought up
there too, should C-US decide to
arbitrate the matter.
It is also possible that should C-US
decide to arbitrate the matter,
conflicting or semi-conflicting verdicts
might be cast by C-US and the
grievance hearing apparatus. For
example, C-US might define the lines
of authority in such a way that Jones
might no longer wish to keep his job.
Looming on the horizon lies the
related issue of funding the program
for Urban Studies, which is scheduled
to be discussed in the near future.
Repercussions from the issues of
conflict between SCIRE and ODUS
may reach this area also.
Ron Jones, the Director of the
Student Center for Innovation and
Research in Education (SCIRE), has
petitioned for a grievance hearing with
the Department of Personnel and
Employee Relations (DPER).
Jones was recently notified by
Dean of Undergraduate Studies James
L. Gibbs, that he would not be offered
another one year contract. His present
contract expires on June 30th.
Jones maintains that he is
answerable only to the SCIRE Policy
Board, and not to the Office of the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
(ODUS).
"When notified of my
employment," asserts Jones, "I was
informed by James L. Gibbs, that
'although this appointment is for one
year, I note your willingness to serve
two years if, at the end of this year,
you and the Policy Board mutually
agree that this would be desirable.'

"At no time during the past year,"
maintains Jones, "was it ever made
clear to me that I was under the
direction of anyone other than the
Policy Board."
Furthermore, Jones claims that in a
formal review of the SCIRE program
authored by Assistant Dean of
Undergraduate Studies Michael
Closson, the role of the Policy Board
was said to include "being responsible
for the overall operation of the
program, including the functioning of
the director and the staff."
Policy Board
Jones points out that the present
Policy Board has unanimously
supported him, and spoken out in
favor of retaining him as director.
Gibbs has asserted that although he
is aware of the Policy Board's support
of Jones, he has felt it necessary to
refuse Jones another contract on the
grounds of "administrative
deficiencies," and repeated failures of
Jones to operate according to the
"procedures and regulations that all
departments at Stanford are subject
to."
In another development, the SCIRE
Policy Board has written a letter to the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies
(C-US) requesting that the committee
act as an arbitrator in the dispute
between the Policy Board and ODUS.
The letter states a willingness to accept
any decision of C-US as final.
Grievance Petition
Emil J. Sarpa, the director of the
DPER, has outlined the procedure that
is now to be followed in regard to the
grievance petition.
"My first task," states Sarpa, "is to
determine whether or not a 'Level I'
confrontation has occurred. That is, an
actual face to face meeting between
Gibbs and Jones." If possible Sarpa
would like to see the matter resolved
at this lower level.
But Jones asserts that such a
meeting has taken place, and that
"phase I had been completed." Jones
believes that at that level the issues are
unresolvable.
