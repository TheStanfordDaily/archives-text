## City Council 
### 
On May 8 Palo Alto voters will choose six members of
their City Council. Eighteen candidates seek the offices, two
competing for a single two-year unexpired term and the
otherl6 running at large for five full, four-year terms. (The
city does not include the student and faculty housing areas
on the campus; hence campus residents will not vote in the
election.)
For the one two-year term, the Daily endorses neither of
the two candidates.
Emily Renzel appears inclined to rather consistently
oppose Stanford on all types of issues, taking her cue from
incumbent Councilwoman Enid Pearson, with whom she
identifies closely. Her knowledge of the wide range of issues
which the Council must face appears somewhat limited.
Roy Clay, who is black, is not a spokesman for the city's
minority groups. He instead has shown himself to represent
the real estate development interests which dominated the
city during most of the 19605.
We cannot recommend either.
For the five four-year terms, the Daily endorses, in
alphabetical order, Kirke Comstock, Douglas Mattern, Tom
Passell, Sylvia Seman, and Byron Slier.
Kirke Comstock, the incumbent mayor, is a 10-year
veteran of the Council who has made a strong record as a
conservationist dedicated to maintaining Palo Alto's
residential character. As mayor, he has guided the Council
through stormy meetings in a firm but fair manner,
permitting all who wish to speak to do so, but refusing to
tolerate disruption.
Douglas Mattern has a lengthy list of organizational
credits which testify to his deep concern for brotherhood
and social justice, and his refusal to resort to domestic
violence as a means to those ends. His is a somewhat more
radical perspective than has been seen on the Council in the
past, but he is a person of tolerance and common sense.
Tom Passell, although he has not held elective office, is a
veteran of the battles of the last decade against unchecked
commercial and industrial development of Palo Alto. Most
recently, he has chaired the committee which is nearing
completion of plans for a cable television system in the city.
Sylvia Seman, in the year and a half since she was
appointed to the Council, has shown a strong social
conscience and an environmentalist perspective. She works
full-time on Council business and serves as Palo Alto's
representative in a number of regional and national
organizations.
Byron Slier, Professor of Law at Stanford, is a former
Councilman who was removed from office in the stormy
1967 recall election for the "crime" of opposing rampant
industrial development. His service on the University Human
Relations Commission and employee grievance panels
demonstrated a spirit of moderation and tolerance. He can
serve as a valuable link between the city and the University.
A word is in order as to why we selected only four of the
five nominees running on the "Association for a Balanced
Community" (ABC) slate for the four-year terms. We feel
that each candidate should be judged as an individual, not
by his slate affiliation. While ABC nominee Allan Seid's
record in drug abuse control and criminal justice is
impressive, it is almost entirely confined to that one issue
area.
Similarly, Mattern alone among the Palo Alto
Community Coalition's candidates won our endorsement.
He appears to exhibit a greater degree of realism and
willingness to listen — both essential attributes for a council
member — than do his running mates.
We think it particularly important that incumbent
Councilmen John J. Berwald, John V. Beahrs, and Stanley
Norton be retired from office. They are holdovers from the
past pro-development councils and their attitude on land
development and housing questions reflects this.
Furthermore, their treatment of their critics at Council
meetings has tended to exacerbate tensions and encourage
ugly disruptions by members of the audience. Their
departure from the Council would probably do more to
alleviate trouble at meetings than would the "law and order"
measures they propose.
In summary, we urge Palo Altans to vote on May 8 for
Kirke Comstock, Douglas Mattern, Tom Passell, Sylvia
Seman, and Byron Sher as their City Council members.
