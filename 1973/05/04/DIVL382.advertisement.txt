5r We're doing our best to keep
9 you out of The Perfect Recipe g
If you've eaten at The Jl
Perfect Recipe, you know L
how good our food and cof- ift £ WwfJ I l&l
fee are. But you also know -
it's sometimes hard to get
your nose in the door. > ~

□ So we've built a lovely
| redwood deck to keep you ■
out-without depriving you of the chance to enjoy
a creamy cup of cappucino, a gourmet sandwich
or a sinful pastry
□ We can even keep you out late. Because our j
deck has special heaters (like the sidewalk cafes
on the Champs Elysee). And we now stay open
from 9 am to Midnight, Wednesday through Satur
day, and 9 am to 9 pm, Sunday through Tuesday.
£ □ So, next time you get the urge for some deli-
cious coffee, or whatever, feel free to drop in . Sf
