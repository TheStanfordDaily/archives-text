# Senate Asks Better Recruitment Of Graduate Women, Minorities
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
The Faculty Senate yesterday
passed an affirmative action resolution
instructing all graduate divisions to
make greater efforts in both attracting
applications from qualified women
and minority students and in
distributing information about
graduate educational opportunities for
women and minorities.
The bill also asks the Dean of
Graduate Studies to report to the
Senate annually on the achievement of
graduate programs in affirmative
action and lists five criteria of the
"Senate's interest" that the dean is to
"bear in mind."
Among those criteria are figures on
the numerical levels of minority and
women students who have applied to
graduate programs, been admitted and
enrolled in the University; the amount
of financial aid distributed to women
and minority graduate students; and
the numbers of women and minority
students receiving graduate degrees.
Lengthy Discussion
Faculty representatives adopted the
bill only after lengthy discussion and
the proposal of three amendments,
only two of which were approved.
The defeated amendment, proposed
by Anthropology Prof. Francis
Cancian, would have asked the Dean
of Graduate Studies to include the
proportion of women and minority
students completing undergraduate
degrees in subjects and at universities
that make them likely to be qualified

graduate applicants. The remaining
amendments made minor wording
changes.
Yesterday's Senate vote climaxed a
long history of stormy debate on
affirmative action that has occupied
much of the Senate's time over the last
four months.
Last year after the Study of
Graduate Education at Stanford report
which contained affirmative action
recommendations was released, the
Senate began to focus its attention on
the issue of the levels of women and
minority students in graduate
programs and on the faculty.
Committee Plan
During the next three months the
Senate steering committee developed
its plan on women and minorities and
in January, presented it. Heavily
criticized as being weak, the steering
committee proposal came under a
barrage of attacks, mainly from the
two women members of the Senate,
Asst. German Prof. Ann Snow and
Psychology Prof. Eleanor Maccoby.
The matter was continued to the
next Senate meeting where faculty
representatives heard from Asst.
Sociology Prof. Francesca Cancian,
head of the University Committee on
the Education and Employment of
Women. They discussed the merit of
setting "numerical goals" on the levels
of women and minority students in
graduate programs.
In that package that the Senate
referred to C-GS was a substitute

motion on the levels of women only in
graduate studies and on the faculty
proposed by Maccoby. The Senate
split that resolution and retained the
section on affirmative action in the
hiring of women for the University
faculty.
That half of the Maccoby
resolution was approved by the Senate
on February 22, establishing as a
"proximal goal" the "current
proportionate representation of
women among new appointees to the
faculty.
The affirmative action issue
surfaced next at the April 5 Senate
meeting where the C-GS
recommendations were heavily

contested. Snow presented an
amendment to the C-GS bill that
would have instructed each graduate
dean to report on the level of women
in his school.
The Senate rejected that proposal
in favor of the committee's suggestion
that the Dean of Graduate Studies
make a comprehensive affirmative
action report. The matter was referred
back to the steering committee for
rewording.
The steering committee broadened
the bill to include minority students as
well as women and removed any
reference to "numerical" or even
"proximal" goals in affirmative action
aims.
