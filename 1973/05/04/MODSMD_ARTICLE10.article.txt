Jews For Jesus:
Rabbi Responds
Editor:
I want to address myself to
some of the points made in that
full page ad placed by the "Jews
For Jesus" organization, which
appeared recently in the Daily.
(1) The "Jews For Jesus" is
not a Jewish organization. It is
funded by the "American Board
Of Missions To The Jews," an
organization having $1.9 million
at its disposal, for the principal
purpose of converting Jews to
Christianity on a nation-wide
level.
(2) There is no 'significant
trend' of Jews joining this
organization, judging from the
reports from my colleagues at
most of the major universities in
the country. This may account for
the need to dramatize, as
evidenced by the ad.
(3) Historically, the main
distinction between Christianity
and Judaism has been that one has
accepted the divinity of Jesus and
the other has not. An individual
Jew, if he chooses, may accept the
divinity of Jesus; but then he is no
longer a Jew. Most Jews view
Jesus as an exceptional human
being following the prophetic
tradition of Amos, Isaiah, and
Jeremiah.
(4) The problem of anxiety
and loneliness that this
organization purports to meet is
an authentic and pervasive
problem. However, it cannot be
met merely by accepting a belief
or joining an organization. A good
beginning towards overcoming
loneliness would be to have close
and sincere friends. However,
friendship, when it is offered at
the price of accepting a belief
or joiningan organization is not, in
my book, sincere. True friendship
doesn't have strings attached.
(5) Though I have no desire to
diminish the importance of prayer
or belief, the major emphasis
within Judaism has been upon the
deed. If needs are to be met,
therefore, concrete acts become
the means. There is no easy way.
Finally, to convince someone
of the desirability of adopting
another position certainly has its
place in a democratic society. Yet
there are methods for convincing
which may be ruled out as
unacceptable. For instance, I
doubt that there would be a
quarrel about the use of physical
force as an undesirable method.
There are, however, other means
which, to the members of an
enlightened society, become
equally objectionable. Methods
which insult the intelligence of
another or demean his traditions
are bound to be regarded as
offensive. Missionizing groups
tend to employ these means, by
regarding their position as true
and all others as false.
Is there a need to remind your
readers of the dangers inherent in
this approach?

No Apology Needed
Editor:
I am dismayed to find in the
Daily of May 1, 1972, an apology
for an advertisement run the
previous day placed by Jews For
Jesus.
While I fully understand the ire
that the ad may arouse in certain
individuals, I do not feel that the
Daily need apologize for it. The
anger that many of these offended
persons show toward the Daily
and its editor is completely
misplaced; their concern should
focus on the group which placed
the advertisement.
The issue appears to be:
Should the Daily run ads which
exhibit a certain cultural bias
(sexist, racist, religiously biased)?
Those who feel that the Daily
must prohibit such ads from
appearing on its pages insult the
intellectual calibre of the
community. By not carrying such
an ad it presumes to protect its
readership from "dangerous" or
offensive ads. Why not let the
reader decide for himself? Give
the reader the choice to judge the
merits of the representations,
whether they be misleading or
offensive. Caveat emptor.
Some argue that by printing
the Jews For Jesus ad, the Daily
expresses agreement with the
statements contained therein.
During an election, would an ad
paid for by a candidate signify
that the Daily endorses that

candidate? Had the Daily
provided free space for the Jews
for Jesus ad, thematterwould be
different. But the ad was paid for,
at full rate. No one can reasonably
argue that the Daily did any
favors for Jews for Jesus. The
Daily and the group merely
engaged in a business transaction.
The contract between the
Daily and Jews For Jesus is the
same type contract that any other
advertiser would enter into with
the Daily. Granted, the views of
this group offend certain persons.
But to prevent such a group from
buying advertising space in the
paper is to discriminate against it
for its unpopular views.
Let the Daily run such an ad,
without apology. Let the critics
condemn the advertiser, not the
newspaper.

Ad In Poor Taste
Editor:
The recent full-page "Jews for
Jesus" ad is, in the opinion of us
and many of our friends, in very
poor taste. There are
three areas to deal with. Whether
the ad should have run or not;
whether one should advertise
religion; and whether it is possible
to be a "Jew for Jesus."
The Daily's policy is not to run
an ad that is sexist, racist or
offensive. The ad run on Monday
was offensive to us because of the
many gross misrepresentations.
The picture is misleading as to the
ratio of "Jews for Jesus" to Jews.
Althugh the article admits the
ratio is not accurate, the
implications of the picture are
obvious.
One sentence of the text seems
to imply that Jews suffer a "deep
emptiness" unless they accept
Jesus . . . another grave
misrepresentation.
While some may argue that no
ad should be omitted because of
its content, that issue is not valid
in this case because the Daily has
a specific policy that it should
follow.
The question of whether
religion should be advertised as a
commodity is quite interesting.
The sources of Jewish religious
thought are quite explicit about
this matter. If anyone wants to
become a Jew, and approaches a
rabbi on the issue, the rabbi must
first try and talk the person out of
it, in order to be sure he is really
committed. For an organization
to call themselves "Jews" and
then advertise their "religion" is
totally contradictory. It is an
impossibility.
The title "Jews for Jesus" is
ridiculous. The basic beliefs
necessary of a Jew and a person
who believes in Jesus are
incompatible. The idea of Jesus
being the Messiah cannot be
considered in any way Jewish.
And anyone who claims that it
can, and that there can be such a
being as a "Jew for Jesus" must
have a misconception of the word
Jew. We don't have a concrete
definition of it, but we do know
what it is not. The legal definition
states one is a Jew if he is born to
a Jewish mother, unless he
debases the Jewish religion.
Accepting Jesus is undoubtably
debasing the Jewish religion.

Anti-War Evening
Editor:
This weekend several Palo Alto
community groups are sponsoring
a program in respone to the
continued American war-making
in Indochina. The American
Friends Service Committee and
the Palo Alto Community
Coalition for the May 8 City
Council Election are presenting a
Saturday evening with speakers, a
film, and folk music on the future
of Indochina.
Dorothy Weller will annotate
films about health care in
Vietnam. She served for four
years as a physical therapist at the
Quaker Rehabilitation Center in
South Vietnam. Douglas Mattern,
the Peace Union city council
candidate, will provide a view of
Indochina's economic
reorganization needs.
Following the women's
liberation folk music group,
Bullfish & the Crab, there will be
a showing of a new 30-minute
color film "The Pentagon Papers
and American Democracy."
In the words of Miss Weller,
"There's no hope for Vietnam as
long as the war goes on. Its
culture and traditions are gone
forever. The ecology and
economy have been desperately
damaged. The country inevitably
will become Communist. Whether
you subscribe to it or not, the
North has something to believe in.
The South has nothing."
The program will be presented
Saturday, May 5, at 7:30 p.m. in
the Lucie Stern Community
Center, 1305 Middlefield Rd.,
Palo Alto. The one dollar
donation will help to provide
health care for those injured by
American B-525.

Presidential Correction
Editor:
The remarks attributed to me
concerning the SCIRE
controversy in Wednesday's Daily
are misquoted and give a very
misleading picture of what I
actually said on KZSU.
I most emphatically did not
say or imply that "This situation
has reflected badly on Dean
Gibbs." I argued that everyone
concerned — proposers of
projects, the Director of SCIRE,
members of the SCIRE Policy
Board, and the Dean's Office —
carry a responsibility for the
academic quality of the program.
I added that there has been a
tendency to leave this entirely to
Dean Gibbs, then to complain
when his office tries to do
something about it that he is
attempting to dominate SCIRE
and destroy its sutonomy.
Further, I did not say "I am
weary of discussing the situation
further at this time." In answer to
questions as to whether I think
that further alternations in the
structure of SCIRE are needed, I
commented that the Academic
Senate has spent an inordinate
amount of time in each of the
past two years on this issue, that
everyone is thoroughly weary of
it, and that I believe the problem
can be solved without changed in
structure.
Issues of quality and academic
standards cannot be dismissed as
merely a bureaucratic hassle. Until
everyone is willing to recognize
some responsibility for solving
these questions, academic
innovation will continue to be
subordinated to sterile arguments
over power.
