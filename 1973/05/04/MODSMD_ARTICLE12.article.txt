## Officials Denounce OEO Organizer Role 
### MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer 
EDITOR'S NOTE: Office of
Economic Opportunity funds
sometimes were used to organize
the poor and fight the established
order. The following, third in a
series on the OEO from the AP
Special Assignment Team,
examines the efforts.

NEWARK, N.J. â€” People's Action
Group, an outpost of the war on
poverty here, once organized a
welfare mothers' march on the
state capital, picketed city
hospital and wrestled supervision
of summer play streets away from
the Police Athletic League.
Newark's elected leaders were
upset.
Downstate, in Camden, a Legal
Services project once filed suit
against city-sponsored urban
renewal over adequate relocation
of the people uprooted.
Vice President Spiro T. Agnew
intervened in the dispute.

Multiplied thousands of times,
the Newark and Camden instances
pinpointed Community Action
Programs such as People's Action
Group and the Legal Services
efforts of the Office of Economic
Opportunity as the major political
battlegrounds of the war on
poverty.
For the OEO programs
sometimes used federal
antipoverty funds at the
grass-roots level to challenge the
established order. The established
order fought back.
Besides organizing the poor
politically and running Legal
Services, the 978 Community
Action Agencies spent most of the
$5.35 billion they got from 1965
through 1972 providing such
diverse services as family planning,
drug rehabilitation, emergency
food and medical services and
recreation and sports programs.
Most of this political
organizing was aimed at changing

the policies of government
agencies and private enterprises,
not at electing public officials.
But blacks in particular
attribute the experience they
gained in antipoverty programs
and the new constituency it
forged with a major role in the
increase in black elected officials
from 400 in 1965 to 2,600 now.
Unlike 1967, when People's
Action Group organized a boycott
of an overcrowded school and
community action workers
organized a filibuster at a hearing
on plans to bulldoze 22 acres of
black housing for a medical
school, Newark now has a black
mayor, a black majority on the
school board and blacks
throughout the city bureaucracy.
And less controversy from its
Community Action Agency.
In February, 1972 antipoverty
lawyers blocked two urban
renewal projects in court on
grounds there was too little

relocation housing. Agnew said
they were improperly substituting
their judgments on social
programs for those of public
officials and called a meeting in
his office to mediate.
Agnew's Opinion
Agnew has since written of
Legal Services. "What we may be
on the way to creating is a
federally funded system manned
by ideological vigilantes who owe
their allegiance not to a client, not
to the citizens of a particular state
or locality and not to the elected
representatives of the people, but
only to a concept of social
reform."
Activist community OEO
groups and Legal Services disputes
were not common everywhere and
Chicago was a city where they
hardly were common at all. In
Chicago, representatives on
Community Action Agency
boards were appointed, and the
appointments were controlled by
City Hall.
The U.S. General Accounting
Office, among others, said that
this did not give adequate
representation to the poor.
Even before Congress passed
amendments in 1967 increasing
city hall control over these
programs, former President
Lyndon Johnson's Budget Bureau
had ordered a redirection of them
toward manpower training.
Unlimited Controversy
But the political controversies
were not confined to the big cities
nor ended by Johnson.
In Woodburn, Oregon, in 1971,
the top staff of the OEO-funded
Valley Migrant League was
"engaged in extensive organizing
and promotional efforts for a
statewide group known as the
Oregon Council of the Poor which
engages in a wide assortment of
direct action confrontation

campaigns," according to an
administratively confidential OEO
inspection report.
In 1969, to dramatize demands
that poor people be put on
antipoverty boards, Hollis West,
community action director in
Knox County, Ky., presented
Gov. Louie Nunn with a mule
while he was host of a
Republican governors conference.
Begging
"The problem with most
programs is they had to beg for
what they got," West said
recently. "The only way you deal
with them is with power."
And power, to many OEO
activisits, meant organizing the
poor.
No language exists in the act
that created OEO about political
organizing, but the law does call
for "maximum feasible
participation" of the poor,
wording that became the
touchstone for activist organizers.
'Articulate And Activist'
"Articulate and activist
representatives of the poor are
bound to clash with merchants,
landlords, welfare officials and
politicians," said Prof. Sar A.
Levitan of George Washington
University, a student of the OEO.
Howard Phillips named by
Nixon to dismantle OEO, said it
operated on the premise "that
people can overcome poverty
collectively not individually, and
that only through politics can you
overcome the so-called oppression
of government." He said it is a
"Marxist idea" to treat the poor
as a class in itself.
But to Gerson Green, who ran
OEO's research and development
for three years in the late 19605,
"These were not people trying to
revolutionize the country. They
were trying to make this country
work the way it's supposed to
work, by its stated valus."
