# Gay Group Receives Grant
## 
### 
A program to fight alcoholism
in the homosexual community has
been funded by a federal grant to
the Gay People's Union at
Stanford.
The grant is believed to be the
first direct federal support of a
gay organization. Neither the
application nor the funding went
through the University.
The $3713 allocation from the
U.S. Office of Education will
finance participants in a two-week
symposium on drug abuse at
Awareness House in Berkeley.
The grant covers tuition, board
and room and reimbursement for
lost salaries by those who have to

leave work to participate, said
David Goldman, graduate student
in education and treasurer of the
group.
"The program hopes to train
people in methods of preventing
drug abuse in their own
communities," Goldman said. "In
the gay community we have a
high rate of alcoholism. Gay bars
either push drinks on people or
compel them to buy drinks by
creating a conducive atmosphere.
"We have already created a
number of alternatives to gay
bars, and we hope that this course
will give ideas for more," he said.
