# AM Stations: Quantity, Not Quality
## 
### ROD KOON 
A local Palo Alto youth was
arrested by police last night
following a series of bizarre
incidents. At approximately 6:30
in the evening, the youth was seen
going to various cafes in the Palo
Alto area, and asking if Mrs. Jones
was there. When asked why he
wanted to know, he made the
singing reply: "Could it be I'm
falling in love?"
About 7:30 that evening he
purchased a large quantity of
ribbon at a local fabric store, and
when police found him he was
tying hundreds of yellow ribbons
around oak trees in the Atherton
area. Following initial questioning
and during the ride to police
headquarters, he constantly tried
to make the two arresting
policemen (whom he called
Carpenters), sing a simple song
with him.
He made one of his two
allowed phone calls in private at
the station, and instead of calling
a lawyer, he called a man whom
he referred to as Dr. John. He said
that Dr. John had told him things
would have been OK, since he was
in the right place, but he
concluded that it must have been
the wrong time. The youth then
refused to make another call until
he was shown the "Stone Phone,"
a phrase which he muttered
throughout the night.
In the preliminary hearing this
morning, it became known that
the boy had been subjected to 24
hours of listening to AM rock
stations. When this fact was
disclosed, the judge dismissed the
case on terms of justifiable
insanity. This view was
substantiated by KYA and KFRC
officials who confessed they
programmed their stations with
the idea that the average listener
tunes in for just fifteen minutes.
But they refused to admit that
long-term, intensive listening may

be hazardous to your health. The
judge, however, disagreed.
Breen Machine
In the Bay area the two leading
AM rock stations are KYA and
KFRC. The race is a close one and
it keeps Julian Breen, the program
director at KYA, hard at work,
trying to make his station sound
its best. Since the records,
commercials, news and DJs at
both stations differ so little, the
way these factors are interwoven
are of utmost importance. Both
stations try to minimize breaks
between songs, by clumping
commercials together with news,
and with back-to-back
commercials.

KFRC limits their number of
commercials to 12 minutes an
hour instead of the FCC limit of
18 minutes, in an attempt to gain
a larger listening audience to make
up for the nearly one million
dollar deficit suffered due to the
fewer ads.
Aside from setting up the
station's actual format, the
program director finds himself
making the crucial decisions as to
which records will be played on
the air. According to Breen: "My
job, specifically, is to get the
largest possible radio audience."
And since the playing of bad
records, more than anything else
make people tune out a station, it
is vital that a station plays as few
bad records as possible.
The quality of a record is
determined primarily and quite
objectively by how well it's
selling. Since the top record might

be played as many as fifty times
in two days at KYA, Breen is
faced with the possibility of
saturating his audience with one
song: "That's one of the reasons
we relate the exposure ratios to
sales so closely. Presumably while
the record is still selling it has
some interest in terms of public
acceptance. When it stops selling,
we reduce the exposure or cause it
to disappear."
Quantity Is Quality
Breen's task, then, is to see
that all the top-selling ("good")
records are constantly being
played. "A bad record really does
two serious things. The first is
that it's on the air at all, and the

second is that while you're
playing it, you're not playing a
better record, and presumably lost
a lot of your audience."
Many variables are taken into
consideration before he decides
whether or not to play a specific
record on the air. He calls them
the record's credentials. "By
credentials I mean, Is it selling
anywhere? Is it being played
anywhere? Where is it being
played? What is the track record
of the artist? And finally, and
least important, what the hell
does it sound like?"
If you are sometimes tempted
to throw your AM radio away
because the songs on it sound so
bad, you can be partially
reconciled in the fact that
although they may sound bad to
you, they at least sell well. Since
saleability is the supreme test for
a record, it would stand to reason

that if you had enough money to
go into San Francisco and buy
20,000 copies of the Zitpoppers
latest single "I'm Just A Teenage
Pimple on the Acneed Face of
Life" it would be aired on KYA
and KFRC for at least a day or
two. As Breen admits: "We're
really quite sales-oriented."
If the whole financial
merry-go-round could be
explained, it would go something
like this: Rock radio gives the
public the sound which rock
artists have sold to the record
companies and which the record
companies have sold to the public.
All this is done so that the radio
station can sell time at high prices
to the advertisers who want to sell
products to the same public which
has already bought the product
which the artists have sold to the
record companies. "Artists" in
this sense is a term loosely
applied.
No Set Standard
Whereas Breen is willing to
discuss professional standards in
terms of quality, he finds it hard
to deal with a record in the same
way. "What's quality to
somebody involved in the world
of academics, or indeed,
somebody involved in the world
of broadcasting, may not be
quality to the guy who drives a
truck and lives in Hayward. And
it's the guy who drives the truck
and lives in Hayward who is just
as important as anbyody else."
So, as Breen attempts to please
as many people as possible, he is
not directing the station toward
any abstract standard of quality,
"but at being an integral part of
the lives of a reasonable number
of individuals." And considering
that KYA reaches up to 70,000 at
one time, and about
three-quarters of a million people
per week, Breen is quite successful
in the pursuit of this goal.
In the AM rock radio setup it is
the listener, not the program

director, who determines quality,
and the listener indicates what he
wants to hear by the kind of
music he buys. "We're in the
business of serving listeners with
whatever it is they would like to
hear. If they suddenly decide they
want to hear Mantovani, we'll
play Mantovani." This decision, of
course, would be based on record
sales.
Good Vs. Bad
Despite all this explanation,
one is tempted to ask Breen why
he plays so many bad records.
"My response to this is, 'Who says
they're bad?' We're not out to do
anything with a record per se,
what we're out to do is entertain
people with it if they think it's
entertaining."
Before one votes for total
condemnation of AM rock
stations for treating rock music
like a business, one should realize
that that is just what it has always
been. Rock music, unlike many
other forms of entertainment, was
business before it was art, and
consequently very little of it is
even considered art.
The Beatles, like most other
groups, weren't given a contract
because they sounded good, but
because it was thought that they
could sell and be sold. Any art
resulting from the rock world is a
mere by-product of its
com mere iality.
So, if you're looking for
quality music defined in terms of
sale ability, stick with AM rock
stations. But if you're looking for
some other criterion for judging
music quality, you might search
the FM band for a station which
isn't too commercially-oriented to
match your musical aesthetic
ideology.
But if you're stuck with just an
AM radio, and want a change, you
might be waiting for a long, long
time. Unless of course, you know
some truck drivers in Hayward
who like Mantovani. ..

music he buys. "We're in the
business of serving listeners with
whatever it is they would like to
hear. If they suddenly decide they
want to hear Mantovani, we'll
play Mantovani." This decision, of
course, would be based on record
sales.
Good Vs. Bad
Despite all this explanation,
one is tempted to ask Breen why
he plays so many bad records.
"My response to this is, 'Who says
they're bad?' We're not out to do
anything with a record per se,
what we're out to do is entertain
people with it if they think it's
entertaining."
Before one votes for total
condemnation of AM rock
stations for treating rock music
like a business, one should realize
that that is just what it has always
been. Rock music, unlike many
other forms of entertainment, was
business before it was art, and
consequently very little of it is
even considered art.
The Beatles, like most other
groups, weren't given a contract
because they sounded good, but
because it was thought that they
could sell and be sold. Any art
resulting from the rock world is a
mere by-product of its
com mere iality.
So, if you're looking for
quality music defined in terms of
sale ability, stick with AM rock
stations. But if you're looking for
some other criterion for judging
music quality, you might search
the FM band for a station which
isn't too commercially-oriented to
match your musical aesthetic
ideology.
But if you're stuck with just an
AM radio, and want a change, you
might be waiting for a long, long
time. Unless of course, you know
some truck drivers in Hayward
who like Mantovani. ..

Entertainment
A local Palo Alto youth was
arrested by police last night
following a series of bizarre
incidents. At approximately 6:30
in the evening, the youth was seen
going to various cafes in the Palo
Alto area, and asking if Mrs. Jones
was there. When asked why he
wanted to know, he made the
singing reply: "Could it be I'm
falling in love?"
About 7:30 that evening he
purchased a large quantity of
ribbon at a local fabric store, and
when police found him he was
tying hundreds of yellow ribbons
around oak trees in the Atherton
area. Following initial questioning
and during the ride to police
headquarters, he constantly tried
to make the two arresting
policemen (whom he called
Carpenters), sing a simple song
with him.
He made one of his two
allowed phone calls in private at
the station, and instead of calling
a lawyer, he called a man whom
he referred to as Dr. John. He said
that Dr. John had told him things
would have been OK, since he was
in the right place, but he
concluded that it must have been
the wrong time. The youth then
refused to make another call until
he was shown the "Stone Phone,"
a phrase which he muttered
throughout the night.
In the preliminary hearing this
morning, it became known that
the boy had been subjected to 24
hours of listening to AM rock
stations. When this fact was
disclosed, the judge dismissed the
case on terms of justifiable
insanity. This view was
substantiated by KYA and KFRC
officials who confessed they
programmed their stations with
the idea that the average listener
tunes in for just fifteen minutes.
But they refused to admit that
long-term, intensive listening may

be hazardous to your health. The
judge, however, disagreed.
Breen Machine
In the Bay area the two leading
AM rock stations are KYA and
KFRC. The race is a close one and
it keeps Julian Breen, the program
director at KYA, hard at work,
trying to make his station sound
its best. Since the records,
commercials, news and DJs at
both stations differ so little, the
way these factors are interwoven
are of utmost importance. Both
stations try to minimize breaks
between songs, by clumping
commercials together with news,
and with back-to-back
commercials.

KFRC limits their number of
commercials to 12 minutes an
hour instead of the FCC limit of
18 minutes, in an attempt to gain
a larger listening audience to make
up for the nearly one million
dollar deficit suffered due to the
fewer ads.
Aside from setting up the
station's actual format, the
program director finds himself
making the crucial decisions as to
which records will be played on
the air. According to Breen: "My
job, specifically, is to get the
largest possible radio audience."
And since the playing of bad
records, more than anything else
make people tune out a station, it
is vital that a station plays as few
bad records as possible.
The quality of a record is
determined primarily and quite
objectively by how well it's
selling. Since the top record might

be played as many as fifty times
in two days at KYA, Breen is
faced with the possibility of
saturating his audience with one
song: "That's one of the reasons
we relate the exposure ratios to
sales so closely. Presumably while
the record is still selling it has
some interest in terms of public
acceptance. When it stops selling,
we reduce the exposure or cause it
to disappear."
Quantity Is Quality
Breen's task, then, is to see
that all the top-selling ("good")
records are constantly being
played. "A bad record really does
two serious things. The first is
that it's on the air at all, and the

second is that while you're
playing it, you're not playing a
better record, and presumably lost
a lot of your audience."
Many variables are taken into
consideration before he decides
whether or not to play a specific
record on the air. He calls them
the record's credentials. "By
credentials I mean, Is it selling
anywhere? Is it being played
anywhere? Where is it being
played? What is the track record
of the artist? And finally, and
least important, what the hell
does it sound like?"
If you are sometimes tempted
to throw your AM radio away
because the songs on it sound so
bad, you can be partially
reconciled in the fact that
although they may sound bad to
you, they at least sell well. Since
saleability is the supreme test for
a record, it would stand to reason

that if you had enough money to
go into San Francisco and buy
20,000 copies of the Zitpoppers
latest single "I'm Just A Teenage
Pimple on the Acneed Face of
Life" it would be aired on KYA
and KFRC for at least a day or
two. As Breen admits: "We're
really quite sales-oriented."
If the whole financial
merry-go-round could be
explained, it would go something
like this: Rock radio gives the
public the sound which rock
artists have sold to the record
companies and which the record
companies have sold to the public.
All this is done so that the radio
station can sell time at high prices
to the advertisers who want to sell
products to the same public which
has already bought the product
which the artists have sold to the
record companies. "Artists" in
this sense is a term loosely
applied.
No Set Standard
Whereas Breen is willing to
discuss professional standards in
terms of quality, he finds it hard
to deal with a record in the same
way. "What's quality to
somebody involved in the world
of academics, or indeed,
somebody involved in the world
of broadcasting, may not be
quality to the guy who drives a
truck and lives in Hayward. And
it's the guy who drives the truck
and lives in Hayward who is just
as important as anbyody else."
So, as Breen attempts to please
as many people as possible, he is
not directing the station toward
any abstract standard of quality,
"but at being an integral part of
the lives of a reasonable number
of individuals." And considering
that KYA reaches up to 70,000 at
one time, and about
three-quarters of a million people
per week, Breen is quite successful
in the pursuit of this goal.
In the AM rock radio setup it is
the listener, not the program

director, who determines quality,
and the listener indicates what he
wants to hear by the kind of
music he buys. "We're in the
business of serving listeners with
whatever it is they would like to
hear. If they suddenly decide they
want to hear Mantovani, we'll
play Mantovani." This decision, of

and KFRC for at least a day or
two. As Breen admits: "We're
really quite sales-oriented."
If the whole financial
merry-go-round could be
explained, it would go something
like this: Rock radio gives the
public the sound which rock
artists have sold to the record
companies and which the record
companies have sold to the public.
All this is done so that the radio
station can sell time at high prices
to the advertisers who want to sell
products to the same public which
has already bought the product
which the artists have sold to the
record companies. "Artists" in
this sense is a term loosely
applied.
No Set Standard
Whereas Breen is willing to
discuss professional standards in
terms of quality, he finds it hard
to deal with a record in the same
way. "What's quality to
somebody involved in the world
of academics, or indeed,
somebody involved in the world
of broadcasting, may not be
quality to the guy who drives a
truck and lives in Hayward. And
it's the guy who drives the truck
and lives in Hayward who is just
as important as anbyody else."
So, as Breen attempts to please
as many people as possible, he is
not directing the station toward
any abstract standard of quality,
"but at being an integral part of
the lives of a reasonable number
of individuals." And considering
that KYA reaches up to 70,000 at
one time, and about
three-quarters of a million people
per week, Breen is quite successful
in the pursuit of this goal.
In the AM rock radio setup it is
the listener, not the program

director, who determines quality,
and the listener indicates what he
wants to hear by the kind of
music he buys. "We're in the
business of serving listeners with
whatever it is they would like to
hear. If they suddenly decide they
want to hear Mantovani, we'll
play Mantovani." This decision, of
course, would be based on record
sales.
Good Vs. Bad
Despite all this explanation,
one is tempted to ask Breen why
he plays so many bad records.
"My response to this is, 'Who says
they're bad?' We're not out to do
anything with a record per se,
what we're out to do is entertain
people with it if they think it's
entertaining."
Before one votes for total
condemnation of AM rock
stations for treating rock music
like a business, one should realize
that that is just what it has always
been. Rock music, unlike many
other forms of entertainment, was
business before it was art, and
consequently very little of it is
even considered art.
The Beatles, like most other
groups, weren't given a contract
because they sounded good, but
because it was thought that they
could sell and be sold. Any art
resulting from the rock world is a
mere by-product of its
com mere iality.
So, if you're looking for
quality music defined in terms of
sale ability, stick with AM rock
stations. But if you're looking for
some other criterion for judging
music quality, you might search
the FM band for a station which
isn't too commercially-oriented to
match your musical aesthetic
ideology.
But if you're stuck with just an
AM radio, and want a change, you
might be waiting for a long, long
time. Unless of course, you know
some truck drivers in Hayward
who like Mantovani. ..

Entertainment
A local Palo Alto youth was
arrested by police last night
following a series of bizarre
incidents. At approximately 6:30
in the evening, the youth was seen
going to various cafes in the Palo
Alto area, and asking if Mrs. Jones
was there. When asked why he
wanted to know, he made the
singing reply: "Could it be I'm
falling in love?"
About 7:30 that evening he
purchased a large quantity of
ribbon at a local fabric store, and
when police found him he was
tying hundreds of yellow ribbons
around oak trees in the Atherton
area. Following initial questioning
and during the ride to police
headquarters, he constantly tried
to make the two arresting
policemen (whom he called
Carpenters), sing a simple song
with him.
He made one of his two
allowed phone calls in private at
the station, and instead of calling
a lawyer, he called a man whom
he referred to as Dr. John. He said
that Dr. John had told him things
would have been OK, since he was
in the right place, but he
concluded that it must have been
the wrong time. The youth then
refused to make another call until
he was shown the "Stone Phone,"
a phrase which he muttered
throughout the night.
In the preliminary hearing this
morning, it became known that
the boy had been subjected to 24
hours of listening to AM rock
stations. When this fact was
disclosed, the judge dismissed the
case on terms of justifiable
insanity. This view was
substantiated by KYA and KFRC
officials who confessed they
programmed their stations with
the idea that the average listener
tunes in for just fifteen minutes.
But they refused to admit that
long-term, intensive listening may

be hazardous to your health. The
judge, however, disagreed.
Breen Machine
In the Bay area the two leading
AM rock stations are KYA and
KFRC. The race is a close one and
it keeps Julian Breen, the program
director at KYA, hard at work,
trying to make his station sound
its best. Since the records,
commercials, news and DJs at
both stations differ so little, the
way these factors are interwoven
are of utmost importance. Both
stations try to minimize breaks
between songs, by clumping
commercials together with news,
and with back-to-back
commercials.

KFRC limits their number of
commercials to 12 minutes an
hour instead of the FCC limit of
18 minutes, in an attempt to gain
a larger listening audience to make
up for the nearly one million
dollar deficit suffered due to the
fewer ads.
Aside from setting up the
station's actual format, the
program director finds himself
making the crucial decisions as to
which records will be played on
the air. According to Breen: "My
job, specifically, is to get the
largest possible radio audience."
And since the playing of bad
records, more than anything else
make people tune out a station, it
is vital that a station plays as few
bad records as possible.
The quality of a record is
determined primarily and quite
objectively by how well it's
selling. Since the top record might

be played as many as fifty times
in two days at KYA, Breen is
faced with the possibility of
saturating his audience with one
song: "That's one of the reasons
we relate the exposure ratios to
sales so closely. Presumably while
the record is still selling it has
some interest in terms of public
acceptance. When it stops selling,
we reduce the exposure or cause it
to disappear."
Quantity Is Quality
Breen's task, then, is to see
that all the top-selling ("good")
records are constantly being
played. "A bad record really does
two serious things. The first is
that it's on the air at all, and the

second is that while you're
playing it, you're not playing a
better record, and presumably lost
a lot of your audience."
Many variables are taken into
consideration before he decides
whether or not to play a specific
record on the air. He calls them
the record's credentials. "By
credentials I mean, Is it selling
anywhere? Is it being played
anywhere? Where is it being
played? What is the track record
of the artist? And finally, and
least important, what the hell
does it sound like?"
If you are sometimes tempted
to throw your AM radio away
because the songs on it sound so
bad, you can be partially
reconciled in the fact that
although they may sound bad to
you, they at least sell well. Since
saleability is the supreme test for
a record, it would stand to reason

that if you had enough money to
go into San Francisco and buy
20,000 copies of the Zitpoppers
latest single "I'm Just A Teenage
Pimple on the Acneed Face of
Life" it would be aired on KYA
and KFRC for at least a day or
two. As Breen admits: "We're
really quite sales-oriented."
If the whole financial
merry-go-round could be

like this: Rock radio gives the

be played as many as fifty times
in two days at KYA, Breen is
faced with the possibility of
saturating his audience with one
song: "That's one of the reasons
we relate the exposure ratios to
sales so closely. Presumably while
the record is still selling it has
some interest in terms of public
acceptance. When it stops selling,
we reduce the exposure or cause it
to disappear."
Quantity Is Quality
Breen's task, then, is to see
that all the top-selling ("good")
records are constantly being
played. "A bad record really does
two serious things. The first is
that it's on the air at all, and the

second is that while you're
playing it, you're not playing a
better record, and presumably lost
a lot of your audience."
Many variables are taken into
consideration before he decides
whether or not to play a specific
record on the air. He calls them
the record's credentials. "By
credentials I mean, Is it selling
anywhere? Is it being played
anywhere? Where is it being
played? What is the track record
of the artist? And finally, and
least important, what the hell
does it sound like?"
If you are sometimes tempted
to throw your AM radio away
because the songs on it sound so
bad, you can be partially
reconciled in the fact that
although they may sound bad to
you, they at least sell well. Since
saleability is the supreme test for
a record, it would stand to reason

that if you had enough money to
go into San Francisco and buy
20,000 copies of the Zitpoppers
latest single "I'm Just A Teenage
Pimple on the Acneed Face of
Life" it would be aired on KYA
and KFRC for at least a day or
two. As Breen admits: "We're
really quite sales-oriented."
If the whole financial
merry-go-round could be
explained, it would go something
like this: Rock radio gives the
public the sound which rock
artists have sold to the record
companies and which the record
companies have sold to the public.
All this is done so that the radio
station can sell time at high prices
to the advertisers who want to sell
products to the same public which
has already bought the product
which the artists have sold to the
record companies. "Artists" in
this sense is a term loosely
applied.
No Set Standard
Whereas Breen is willing to
discuss professional standards in
terms of quality, he finds it hard
to deal with a record in the same
way. "What's quality to
somebody involved in the world
of academics, or indeed,
somebody involved in the world
of broadcasting, may not be
quality to the guy who drives a
truck and lives in Hayward. And
it's the guy who drives the truck
and lives in Hayward who is just
as important as anbyody else."
So, as Breen attempts to please
as many people as possible, he is
not directing the station toward
any abstract standard of quality,
"but at being an integral part of
the lives of a reasonable number
of individuals." And considering
that KYA reaches up to 70,000 at
one time, and about
three-quarters of a million people
per week, Breen is quite successful
in the pursuit of this goal.
In the AM rock radio setup it is
the listener, not the program

director, who determines quality,
and the listener indicates what he
wants to hear by the kind of
music he buys. "We're in the
business of serving listeners with
whatever it is they would like to
hear. If they suddenly decide they
want to hear Mantovani, we'll
play Mantovani." This decision, of
course, would be based on record
sales.
Good Vs. Bad
Despite all this explanation,
one is tempted to ask Breen why
he plays so many bad records.
"My response to this is, 'Who says
they're bad?' We're not out to do
anything with a record per se,
what we're out to do is entertain
people with it if they think it's
entertaining."
Before one votes for total
condemnation of AM rock
stations for treating rock music
like a business, one should realize
that that is just what it has always
been. Rock music, unlike many
other forms of entertainment, was
business before it was art, and
consequently very little of it is
even considered art.
The Beatles, like most other
groups, weren't given a contract
because they sounded good, but
because it was thought that they
could sell and be sold. Any art
resulting from the rock world is a
mere by-product of its
com mere iality.
So, if you're looking for
quality music defined in terms of
sale ability, stick with AM rock
stations. But if you're looking for
some other criterion for judging
music quality, you might search
the FM band for a station which
isn't too commercially-oriented to
match your musical aesthetic
ideology.
But if you're stuck with just an
AM radio, and want a change, you
might be waiting for a long, long
time. Unless of course, you know
some truck drivers in Hayward
who like Mantovani. ..

Entertainment
A local Palo Alto youth was
arrested by police last night
following a series of bizarre
incidents. At approximately 6:30
in the evening, the youth was seen
going to various cafes in the Palo
Alto area, and asking if Mrs. Jones
was there. When asked why he
wanted to know, he made the
singing reply: "Could it be I'm
falling in love?"
About 7:30 that evening he
purchased a large quantity of
ribbon at a local fabric store, and
when police found him he was
tying hundreds of yellow ribbons
around oak trees in the Atherton
area. Following initial questioning
and during the ride to police
headquarters, he constantly tried
to make the two arresting
policemen (whom he called
Carpenters), sing a simple song
with him.
He made one of his two
allowed phone calls in private at
the station, and instead of calling
a lawyer, he called a man whom
he referred to as Dr. John. He said
that Dr. John had told him things
would have been OK, since he was
in the right place, but he
concluded that it must have been
the wrong time. The youth then
refused to make another call until
he was shown the "Stone Phone,"
a phrase which he muttered
throughout the night.
In the preliminary hearing this
morning, it became known that
the boy had been subjected to 24
hours of listening to AM rock
stations. When this fact was
disclosed, the judge dismissed the
case on terms of justifiable
insanity. This view was
substantiated by KYA and KFRC
officials who confessed they
programmed their stations with
the idea that the average listener
tunes in for just fifteen minutes.
But they refused to admit that
long-term, intensive listening may

be hazardous to your health. The
judge, however, disagreed.
Breen Machine
In the Bay area the two leading
AM rock stations are KYA and
KFRC. The race is a close one and
it keeps Julian Breen, the program
director at KYA, hard at work,
trying to make his station sound
its best. Since the records,
commercials, news and DJs at
both stations differ so little, the
way these factors are interwoven
are of utmost importance. Both
stations try to minimize breaks
between songs, by clumping
commercials together with news,
and with back-to-back
commercials.

KFRC limits their number of
commercials to 12 minutes an
hour instead of the FCC limit of
18 minutes, in an attempt to gain
a larger listening audience to make
up for the nearly one million
dollar deficit suffered due to the
fewer ads.
Aside from setting up the
station's actual format, the
program director finds himself
making the crucial decisions as to
which records will be played on
the air. According to Breen: "My
job, specifically, is to get the
largest possible radio audience."
And since the playing of bad
records, more than anything else
make people tune out a station, it
is vital that a station plays as few
bad records as possible.
The quality of a record is
determined primarily and quite
objectively by how well it's
selling. Since the top record might

be played as many as fifty times
in two days at KYA, Breen is
faced with the possibility of
saturating his audience with one
song: "That's one of the reasons
we relate the exposure ratios to
sales so closely. Presumably while
the record is still selling it has
some interest in terms of public
acceptance. When it stops selling,
