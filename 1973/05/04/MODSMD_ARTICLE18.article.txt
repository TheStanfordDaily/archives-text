# Enjoyable Music At PA Refectory
## 
### JURGEN WOLFF 
Musicians who play at eateries
and coffee houses are a sturdy lot.
Night after night they have to
prove themselves more interesting
than the patron's pork chop or
the small talk of his companions.
Those who succeed are usually
well worth hearing.
"Sonshine" is the collective
name of two young men who are
currently proving themselves
worthy of the struggle, Friday
nights at the Refectory Steak
House in Menlo Park.
Two qualities are necessary in
competitive settings: excellent
music and a strong stage presence.
The music of "Sonshine" is
definitely their strongest point.
Combining acoustic and electric
guitars, they provide a remarkably
full sound on a wide range of folk
and rock numbers.
John Brown, who does most of
the singing, has a strong yet gentle
singing style that lies somewhere
between that of James Taylor and
that of John Sebastian.
Obvious Enjoyment
Gary Dunn, whose voice is
reminiscent of Jerry Garcia, has a
long background in rock and
country music, which are
influences he combines in his
obvious enjoyment of good-timey
numbers like "Bring It With You
When You Come."
The stage presence of
"Sonshine" has not yet coalesced,
perhaps because the two have
only been playing together for
three months. Their goal is to
expand into a large band,
"Something on the Leon Russel
model," according to Gary.
In their present assignment,

they wisely resign themselves to
providing a mellow program for
the late dinner crowd during their
first set, but then build to a
quicker and more involving pace
during their remaining three sets.
"It's frustrating at first," says
Gary, "because people are talking
and drinking rather than getting
involved with the music. But
gradually they respond, and since
I've been playing for about ten
years now, I find I can play pretty
much what they want."
Dollar Song
John, who admits to living in
Milpitas and having gotten his
start by playing Irving Berlin
songs on the ukelele, agrees. "It's
like the lyrics to that old song:
'they only put a nickel in, but
they want a dollar song.' "
Especially on folk and soft
rock numbers like "Rocky
Mountain High" and "Operator,"
"Sonshine" succeeds in providing
the other ninety-five cents.
The Refectory's decor is dark
wood, red bricks, and golden
lighting, with the space broken up
by beams and dividers — an
excellent atmosphere for dining
and socializing, but one which
doesn't directly focus attention
upon the small stage. However,
the good sound system and the
music of "Sonshine" overcome
that disadvantage.
"Sonshine" continues at the
Refectory, 1906 El Camino in
Menlo Park, on Friday nights for
at least another month.
