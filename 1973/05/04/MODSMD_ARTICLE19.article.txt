# Zero Plot In ‘Ground Zero’
## 
### ROBERT SHERWOOD GROUND ZERO 
Directed by James T. Flocker
Written by Samuel Newman
Two of the Mafia syndicate's
top men are being held in the San
Francisco County jail for murder.
The Mafia responds with an
ultimatum: either the prisoners
are released or a nuclear device
will level the entire San Francisco
Bay Area. Unknown to everyone
except a Mafia cohort, the Golden
Gate Bridge is Ground Zero. If
this plot does not already seem
ridiculous, then you will no doubt
enjoy this new low-budget thriller.
If, on the other hand, this plot
sounds as if it has some potential.

you would be better off
continuing it in your own head
than seeing the inevitably bland
and bloody melodrama it has been
made into by television writer for
the Perry Mason series, Samuel
Newman. "Ground Zero" works
primarily on a sustained level of
spoken and visual cliche.
Bay Area radio personality
Ron Casteel stars as Gideon Blake,
the president's tough Special
Security envoy, who must locate
and defuse the bomb. He and
Steve Norton (Kim Friese),
today's "intellectual, soft-spoken
and non-violent young man,"
learn where the bomb is from
(you guessed it) a dying scientist

who has constructed the
detonator. The film climaxes in a
dramatic shootout 75 stories up,
atop the south tower of the
Golden Gate Bridge.
First Role
This is Ron Casteel's first
movie role, but it merely testifies
to the fact that almost anyone can
handle the rather unchallenging
roles of low-budget Hollywood
action films. John Waugh appears
as the politically-ambitious
District Attorney whose
obstinance in the case necessitates
the Mafia's actions. One of the
Mafia's top contract men, Georgio
Trioni (Augie Treibach), is
assigned to make the deal.
Most of the problem with the
film is the script, which does not
significantly deviate from a
television series in its vapid
dialogue and predictable plot.
True to form everyone gets shot
or killed. Writer Samuel Newman
wrote "Ground Zero" clearly with
a television audience mentality in
mind, something successful
movies today must steer away
from.
Uninspired Technique
The photography also bears the

stamp of television's hasty and
uninspired technique. Of note,
however, is the final twenty
minutes of the film shot in a
single day on top of the Golden
Gate Bridge. The view is
remarkable and a 40-mile-an-hour
wind is reported to have been
blowing. A single cameraman was
the only crew used for the
sequence, which does have a few
spine-tingling shots from 75
stories up.
At a publicity cocktail party,
Sam Newman had some words of
praise for Ron Casteel's
"charisma" as an actor and felt
that a new film personality had
been launched. "Ground Zero,"
however, is no proving ground for
talent.
An interesting note, however,
was given by Mr. Casteel when he
said that the bridge maintenance
man who accompanied them up
to the top reported that he often
found empty wine bottles and
other picnic debris from people
who had climbed up the cable
during the night. Try it sometime,
you'll get more of a thrill
certainly than "Ground Zero" can
provide.
