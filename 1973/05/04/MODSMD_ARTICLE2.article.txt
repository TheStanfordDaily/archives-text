# Beaty Testifies That Burt Aided His Escape From Chino Prison
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Convict Ronald Wayne Beaty
testified Wednesday and Thursday that
Benton Douglas Burt helped him
escape from the California Institution
for Men at Chino last Oct. 6 and that
Andrea Holman Burt, drove one of the
vehicles used in the ambush escape.
Beaty, who was later recaptured,
pleaded guilty to murder in December
and is the prosecution's chief witness.
He identified the Burts as two of the
four ambushers in the incident, which
left one prison guard dead and another
wounded.
The Burts face charges of murder,
assault, and freeing a prisoner. Andrea
Holman Burt is the daughter of
Medicine Prof. Halsted Holman.
Two other persons, Robert Seabock
and Jean Hobson, face similar
escape-related charges in a separate
trial. Beaty identified Hobson as one
of two women who waited in a nearby
parking lot while the ambush took
place. He identified the other two
ambushers only as "Don" and "Bob."
Previous Grand Jury testimony and
affidavits identify "Bob" as Seabock,
but Beaty's testimony did not contain
a similar link.
Beaty Describes Escape
Beaty's testimony contained the

second eyewitness account of the
escape incident offered in the trial.
George Fitzgerald, the guard wounded
in the ambush, provided the first
description earlier this week.
According to Beaty, "Bob" drove
the first escape vehicle, and Andrea
Burt drove a second car containing
Benton Burt and "Don." Benton Burt
helped Beaty out of the guards' car. As
Beaty was getting into the car driven
by Andrea Burt, he heard a shot and
turned to see "Bob" firing at the
guards in a pose which Beaty
demonstrated for the jury â€” that of a
person clasping a weapon with both
hands directly in front of him.
Beaty's description of the shooting
corroborated Fitzgerald's testimony,
although Fitzgerald did not recognize
either of the Burts as a member of the
ambush group.
Beaty told the court that he then
got into the car and was offered an
M-l rifle by Andrea Burt. Beaty said
she asked him if he knew how to use
the weapon and he replied, "no."
Benton Burt then entered the car, cut
Beaty's chains with a bolt cutter, gave
him a .22 magnum revolver, and said,
"This is for you, brother," Beaty
stated.
The two cars then left the scene

and drove to a parking lot where
Hobson and another woman were
waiting in a third vehicle.
Beaty also testified that he knew
Benton Burt while they were both
incarcerated in Chino, and that they
discussed escape plans. Beaty said he
opposed Burt's plan to use dynamite
to blow up the car containing the
guards.
Witness' Report Questioned
Earlier this week, Judge Thomas
Haldorsen denied a defense motion for
dismissal, but criticized the
prosecution for its failure to make a
particular witness report available to
the defense.
The report in question was written
six weeks after the escape by a
California Highway patrolman who
claimed he saw the ambush vehicles on
the morning of the incident. His
account was incorporated into another
statement and the original report was
discarded. The prosecution knew
about the report, but failed to inform
the defense of its existence.
A defense motion challenging the
admissibility of the patrolman's
testimony is pending, and the judge
will hear further arguments on the
motion after Beaty finishes his
testimony sometime next week.
