# Pharoah Saunders 'Shines' In Berkeley
## 
### MARK R. WILSON 
Last Friday night was
unseasonably cold, but the chill
didn't stop jazz fans from filling
the open-air Greek Theatre on the
Berkeley campus to hear groups
led by Shirley Scott, Pharoah
Saunders and McKoy Tyner.
The highlight of the Berkeley
Jazz Festival's second evening was
indisputably Pharoah Saunders
and his all-round virtuoso group.
Calvin Hill on drums and the bass
and piano players each played
with an intensity, uniqueness and
sophistication of style which
nearly matched Pharoah himself.
Pharoah began playing
variations around a very simple
and beautiful two-note phrase. His
spontaneity and control exercised
in building the emotional height
of his improvisation showed why
many critics consider Pharoah

Saunders the premier modern jazz
saxophonist.
After the introductory passage
Pharoah changed the pace, soloing
over the mellowed rhythm section
to create a total sound similar to
his composition "Thembi."
Shrieking
As his solo intensified, Pharoah
leaned back in ecstasy shrieking in
the manner for which he has
become famous, and to many,
notorious. But unlike times past,
Pharoah showed a real maturity in
his ability to contour his
emotional outbursts and descend
from them without getting too
carried away for too long.
Pharoah received the crowd's
loudest ovations for mellowing
out and then rebuilding the
passage more impassion ate ly five
successive times.
Brilliant Solos
Saunders followed with a

composition from his fine album
"The Creator Has A Master Plan."
Both the bass player and pianist
soloed brilliantly and Pharoah
intoned over and over "Love Is
Everywhere" in the night's highest
offering of the "divine" music for
which Saunders and Alice
Coltrane are famous in the jazz
world and John McLaughlin and
most recently Santana are known
in the rock field.
McKoy Tyner's quintet
finished the evening but just
couldn't follow the incredible
performance of Saunder's group.
Despite an exciting sound
founded on an excellent drummer
and heavy miking of the drums
(like heavy rock), the group just
couldn't get anything going for
long. There were fine moments,
but they were the exceptions and
remained overshadowed by the
magnificent Saunders set.

For me the Tyner group's
biggest disappointment was
McKoy himself. Despite some
truly beautiful moments, his
piano playing was sometimes
repetitive and often seemingly
senseless and excessively harsh.
Perhaps this is just a matter of
taste.
Although Tyner got a big hand
at the end, the fans retreated from
the cold throughout his set and
less than a third of the crowd
remained at the conclusion.
Shirley Scott's trio opened the
night's jazz fare and featured a

very good young saxophonist
named Ramon Morris. Morris's
playing was adept and melodic,
but his technique was a little
clipped and obviously derivative
(a la Charles Loyd).
Morris's sax was backed up by
a capable drummer and Shirley
herself, whose keyboard playing
was repetitive and unimaginative,
and certainly not up to the
standards of her two fellow
musicians.
Pharoah Saunders is appearing
at Keystone Corner in San
Francisco this week.
