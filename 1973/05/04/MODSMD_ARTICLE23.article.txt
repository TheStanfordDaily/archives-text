# Tennis Team Finishes 15-2
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Stanford's tennis team's final record stands at
15-2 after an impressive 8-1 win over California
Wednesday.
A large crowd watched as the Cardinals once
again showed mastery of the singles positions,
winning every match against an improved Berkeley
team.
The only Stanford loss came at third doubles,
where Craig Johnson and Jake Warde lost to Mike
Caro and John Clancy. Warde and Johnson, of
course, are not the regular Stanford third doubles
team, but needed to play in this, the final dual
match of the season, in order to win varsity letters.
Elsewhere it was all smiles. Jim Delaney, playing
first singles, easily beat Steve Bartlett 6-3, 6-2. Peter
Campbell, Cal's usual top player, was injured, so
neither he nor Stanford's Sandy Mayer played
singles.
Mayer, however, did team with Delaney at first
doubles, beating Bartlett and Steve Prouix 6-3, 6-4.
At second singles, Rick Risher had an off day but
still managed to top Mauel Casteneda 6-4, 5-7, 6-4
in a hard-fought match during which several line
calls were protested.
At third singles, Pat DuPre beat Doug King 6-4,

6-4, while at fourth singles, Chip Fisher beat John
Stefanki 7-6, 6-1.
John Whitlinger and Mark Mitchell, playing fifth
and sixth singles, both wasted little time in straight
set wins.
Stanford's eighth win came from the second
doubles team of Whitlinger and DuPre, which beat
King and Larry Belinsky 7-6, 6-3.
With the dual match season completed, the next
time Stanford competes as a team will be in the
Pac-8 meet in Los Angeles in two weeks. Meanwhile,
12 individuals from the Cardinal team, along with
five doubles teams, will compete in the California
State championships at Alpine Hills next week.
Mayer, Delaney, Rick Fisher, and DuPre have all
been exempted from this weekend's qualifying
rounds for the tournament. Other Stanford players
entered include Chip Fisher, Whitlinger,
Groslimond, Paul Sidone, Mitchell, Warde, Johnson,
and Chico Hagey, who is "redshirting" the varsity
season.
Doubles teams for the Alpine Hills tournament
are Mayer-Delaney, Rick Fisher-Groslimond,
DuPre-Whitlinger, Warde-Johnson, and Hagey-Chip
Fisher.

Mayer, however, did team with Delaney at first
doubles, beating Bartlett and Steve Prouix 6-3, 6-4.
At second singles, Rick Risher had an off day but
still managed to top Mauel Casteneda 6-4, 5-7, 6-4
in a hard-fought match during which several line
calls were protested.
At third singles, Pat DuPre beat Doug King 6-4,

6-4, while at fourth singles, Chip Fisher beat John
Stefanki 7-6, 6-1.
John Whitlinger and Mark Mitchell, playing fifth
and sixth singles, both wasted little time in straight
set wins.
Stanford's eighth win came from the second
doubles team of Whitlinger and DuPre, which beat
King and Larry Belinsky 7-6, 6-3.
With the dual match season completed, the next
time Stanford competes as a team will be in the
Pac-8 meet in Los Angeles in two weeks. Meanwhile,
12 individuals from the Cardinal team, along with
five doubles teams, will compete in the California
State championships at Alpine Hills next week.
Mayer, Delaney, Rick Fisher, and DuPre have all
been exempted from this weekend's qualifying
rounds for the tournament. Other Stanford players
entered include Chip Fisher, Whitlinger,
Groslimond, Paul Sidone, Mitchell, Warde, Johnson,
and Chico Hagey, who is "redshirting" the varsity
season.
Doubles teams for the Alpine Hills tournament
are Mayer-Delaney, Rick Fisher-Groslimond,
DuPre-Whitlinger, Warde-Johnson, and Hagey-Chip
Fisher.
