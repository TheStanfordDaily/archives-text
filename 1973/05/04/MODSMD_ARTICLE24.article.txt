# California Rated Slight Favorite
## Spikers Face Bears In 79th Big Meet 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
Stanford hosts California
tomorrow in the 79th annual Big
Meet, the final dual competition
for both teams in the 1973 track
season. Both teams go into the
meet with identical 2-3 records,
and tomorrow's battle will decide
who finishes this year with a .500
season.
Cal was a 92-53 victor in last
year's meet, but the year before
Stanford upset the Bears 76-69. A
current "dope sheet" on both
teams, based on current marks,
gives Cal an eight point advantage
in tomorrow's competition, which
gets underway at 1:15 p.m. at
Stanford Stadium.
In the meets against USC and
UCLA, the only teams the Cards
and the Bears have both faced this
year, Stanford fared better than
Cal, coming to within seven points
of upsetting the Trojans two
weeks ago and scoring 19 more
points than Cal against UCLA.
Neither of the two head
coaches feels one team will
dominate the meet. "It won't be a
runaway as I see it," Stanford
coach Payton Jordan said. "The
teams are fairly evenly matched,

although Cal has a little more
depth than we do. But both teams
always get up for this meet more
than any other."
Key Injuries
A couple of untimely injuries
to two of Cal's star performers
will give the Cards an added
advantaged tomorrow. Craig
Conway, the Bears' star long
jumper, is out with an injury,
which makes Tom Anderson the
favorite in that event. The Bears'
ace sprinter Sammy Burns pulled
a muscle in the 220 against UCLA
two weeks ago, making Ken Curl
the overwhelming favorite in the
220 and the 100.
But Cal is not within its own
practically sure winners. Rick
Brown has been virtually
unbeatable in the 880 the past
three years and should continue
his string of victories. Bruce
Kennedy threw a school record
259-8 in the javelin two weeks ago
and is almost 40 feet ahead of his
nearest Stanford competition.
Stanford's surest victory is in
the shotput. Freshman Terry
Albritton shattered the Stanford
record with a 61-s'/2 put early in
the season, and has a good shot at
cracking the Big Meet record of
59-3'/ 2 .
There are several other meet
records in danger of going by the
wayside. Brian Mittelstaedt has
run a 4:04 mile and an 8:50.2 two
mile this year while the meet
records for those events are
4:03.2 and 8:52.7. Dave Bagshaw
has already equalled the 14.2
hurdle mark this season.
Swift Relay
Cal's 440 relay, even without
Sammy Burns, has run 40.3,
compared to the meet record of
40.0. Ed Otter set a meet record
of 16'5" in the pole vault last year
and will be vaulting against
Saturday. His teammate Mike
Weidig has already cleared 16'7"
this season.
Whether the records fall or not,
the Big Meet will undoubtedly
feature some of the finest
performances of the season for
both schools. With the possibility
of upsetting stars like Brown and
Kennedy practically nil, Coach
Jordan plans to rely on seconds
and thirds to make the difference

in the meet.
"I don't think this meet will be
decided on firsts alone," Jordan
said. "Both teams are pretty even
there. It's the unexpected second
or third that can make the
difference. Also the 440, the
hurdle races, the discus, and the
triple jump are really up for grabs,
and this is where we're looking for
people who really like to
compete.
Jordan Optimistic
"In situations like this, it's not
always the most talented athlete
who wins the event, but very
often the. one who thrives on
competition. Considering what we
did against USC and the manner
in which we met the opposition at
San Antonio, I think we're ready
for this kind of challenge."
The fact that Stanford is the
home team Saturday will
naturally be an asset to the Cards.
As well as the psychological
advantage of competing at home,
the weight men and jumpers have
the added advantage of being
familiar with the strange wind
patterns in the Stanford stadium.
Jordan is expecting record
attendance for the meet. "Both
teams are ready, and the
competition should be good all
the way. We're looking forward to
a big crowd and another typical
Big Meet."
Competition begins with the
pole vault and long jump at 1:15
p.m. The first running event is the
3000 meter steeplechase at 1:45
p.m.

records for those events are
4:03.2 and 8:52.7. Dave Bagshaw
has already equalled the 14.2
hurdle mark this season.
Swift Relay
Cal's 440 relay, even without
Sammy Burns, has run 40.3,
compared to the meet record of
40.0. Ed Otter set a meet record
of 16'5" in the pole vault last year
and will be vaulting against
Saturday. His teammate Mike
Weidig has already cleared 16'7"
this season.
Whether the records fall or not,
the Big Meet will undoubtedly
feature some of the finest
performances of the season for
both schools. With the possibility
of upsetting stars like Brown and
Kennedy practically nil, Coach
Jordan plans to rely on seconds
and thirds to make the difference

in the meet.
"I don't think this meet will be
decided on firsts alone," Jordan
said. "Both teams are pretty even
there. It's the unexpected second
or third that can make the
difference. Also the 440, the
hurdle races, the discus, and the
triple jump are really up for grabs,
and this is where we're looking for
people who really like to
compete.
Jordan Optimistic
"In situations like this, it's not
always the most talented athlete
who wins the event, but very
often the. one who thrives on
competition. Considering what we
did against USC and the manner
in which we met the opposition at
San Antonio, I think we're ready
for this kind of challenge."
The fact that Stanford is the
home team Saturday will
naturally be an asset to the Cards.
As well as the psychological
advantage of competing at home,
the weight men and jumpers have
the added advantage of being
familiar with the strange wind
patterns in the Stanford stadium.
Jordan is expecting record
attendance for the meet. "Both
teams are ready, and the
competition should be good all
the way. We're looking forward to
a big crowd and another typical
Big Meet."
Competition begins with the
pole vault and long jump at 1:15
p.m. The first running event is the
3000 meter steeplechase at 1:45
p.m.
Stanford hosts California
tomorrow in the 79th annual Big
Meet, the final dual competition
for both teams in the 1973 track
season. Both teams go into the
meet with identical 2-3 records,
and tomorrow's battle will decide
who finishes this year with a .500
season.
Cal was a 92-53 victor in last
year's meet, but the year before
Stanford upset the Bears 76-69. A
current "dope sheet" on both
teams, based on current marks,
gives Cal an eight point advantage
in tomorrow's competition, which
gets underway at 1:15 p.m. at
Stanford Stadium.
In the meets against USC and
UCLA, the only teams the Cards
and the Bears have both faced this
year, Stanford fared better than
Cal, coming to within seven points
of upsetting the Trojans two
weeks ago and scoring 19 more
points than Cal against UCLA.
Neither of the two head
coaches feels one team will
dominate the meet. "It won't be a
runaway as I see it," Stanford
coach Payton Jordan said. "The
teams are fairly evenly matched,

although Cal has a little more
depth than we do. But both teams
always get up for this meet more
than any other."
Key Injuries
A couple of untimely injuries
to two of Cal's star performers
will give the Cards an added
advantaged tomorrow. Craig
Conway, the Bears' star long
jumper, is out with an injury,
which makes Tom Anderson the
favorite in that event. The Bears'
ace sprinter Sammy Burns pulled
a muscle in the 220 against UCLA
two weeks ago, making Ken Curl
the overwhelming favorite in the
220 and the 100.
But Cal is not within its own
practically sure winners. Rick
Brown has been virtually
unbeatable in the 880 the past
three years and should continue
his string of victories. Bruce
Kennedy threw a school record
259-8 in the javelin two weeks ago
and is almost 40 feet ahead of his
nearest Stanford competition.
Stanford's surest victory is in
the shotput. Freshman Terry
Albritton shattered the Stanford
record with a 61-s'/2 put early in
the season, and has a good shot at
cracking the Big Meet record of
59-3'/ 2 .
There are several other meet
records in danger of going by the
wayside. Brian Mittelstaedt has
run a 4:04 mile and an 8:50.2 two
mile this year while the meet
records for those events are
4:03.2 and 8:52.7. Dave Bagshaw
has already equalled the 14.2

Cal was a 92-53 victor in last
year's meet, but the year before
Stanford upset the Bears 76-69. A
current "dope sheet" on both
teams, based on current marks,
gives Cal an eight point advantage
in tomorrow's competition, which
gets underway at 1:15 p.m. at
Stanford Stadium.
In the meets against USC and
UCLA, the only teams the Cards
and the Bears have both faced this
year, Stanford fared better than
Cal, coming to within seven points
of upsetting the Trojans two
weeks ago and scoring 19 more
points than Cal against UCLA.
Neither of the two head
coaches feels one team will
dominate the meet. "It won't be a
runaway as I see it," Stanford
coach Payton Jordan said. "The
teams are fairly evenly matched,

although Cal has a little more
depth than we do. But both teams
always get up for this meet more
than any other."
Key Injuries
A couple of untimely injuries
to two of Cal's star performers
will give the Cards an added
advantaged tomorrow. Craig
Conway, the Bears' star long
jumper, is out with an injury,
which makes Tom Anderson the
favorite in that event. The Bears'
ace sprinter Sammy Burns pulled
a muscle in the 220 against UCLA
two weeks ago, making Ken Curl
the overwhelming favorite in the
220 and the 100.
But Cal is not within its own
practically sure winners. Rick
Brown has been virtually
unbeatable in the 880 the past
three years and should continue
his string of victories. Bruce
Kennedy threw a school record
259-8 in the javelin two weeks ago
and is almost 40 feet ahead of his
nearest Stanford competition.
Stanford's surest victory is in
the shotput. Freshman Terry
Albritton shattered the Stanford
record with a 61-s'/2 put early in
the season, and has a good shot at
cracking the Big Meet record of
59-3'/ 2 .
There are several other meet
records in danger of going by the
wayside. Brian Mittelstaedt has
run a 4:04 mile and an 8:50.2 two
mile this year while the meet
records for those events are
4:03.2 and 8:52.7. Dave Bagshaw
has already equalled the 14.2
hurdle mark this season.
Swift Relay
Cal's 440 relay, even without
Sammy Burns, has run 40.3,
compared to the meet record of
40.0. Ed Otter set a meet record
of 16'5" in the pole vault last year
and will be vaulting against
Saturday. His teammate Mike
Weidig has already cleared 16'7"
this season.
Whether the records fall or not,
the Big Meet will undoubtedly
feature some of the finest
performances of the season for
both schools. With the possibility
of upsetting stars like Brown and
Kennedy practically nil, Coach
Jordan plans to rely on seconds
and thirds to make the difference

in the meet.
"I don't think this meet will be
decided on firsts alone," Jordan
said. "Both teams are pretty even
there. It's the unexpected second
or third that can make the
difference. Also the 440, the
hurdle races, the discus, and the
triple jump are really up for grabs,
and this is where we're looking for
people who really like to
compete.
Jordan Optimistic
"In situations like this, it's not
always the most talented athlete
who wins the event, but very
often the. one who thrives on
competition. Considering what we
did against USC and the manner
in which we met the opposition at
San Antonio, I think we're ready
for this kind of challenge."
The fact that Stanford is the
home team Saturday will
naturally be an asset to the Cards.
As well as the psychological
advantage of competing at home,
the weight men and jumpers have
the added advantage of being
familiar with the strange wind
patterns in the Stanford stadium.
Jordan is expecting record
attendance for the meet. "Both
teams are ready, and the
competition should be good all
the way. We're looking forward to
a big crowd and another typical
Big Meet."
Competition begins with the
pole vault and long jump at 1:15
p.m. The first running event is the
3000 meter steeplechase at 1:45
p.m.
