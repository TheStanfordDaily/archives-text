# Rivalry Continues
## Golfers Face San Jose State 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Stanford coach Bud Finger will
be trying out a new lineup, but
otherwise it should be the same
old story tomorrow when
Stanford and San Jose State
continue their golf rivalry in a
noon match at the Stanford
course.
The Spartans, who last
weekend finished two strokes
behind the victorious Cardinals in
Stanford's U.S. Collegiate
Invitational, will be going after a
sweep in the annual dual match
series between the two teams. San

Jose won the first match on April
9, a convincing 33-21 victory at
San Jose Country Club.
Although that match wasn't
nearly as close as most of the Card
vs. Spartan battles, San Jose
State's Don Thames provided
plenty of excitement. Thames was
three strokes behind Stanford's
Dave Baskins after 13 holes before
finishing birdie-birdie-birdie-eagle
par on the final five holes to
defeat the shocked Baskins by five
shots.
Close Match Expected
Tomorrow's action may not

include similar heroics, but if
recent history is any indication,
the match probably won't be
decided until the final player
putts out on the 18th green. A
brief summary of some of the
typically close Stanford-San Jose
State finishes in the last two years
would include: last year's 27-77
dual match tie at Stanford, the
Spartans one shot victory over the
Cards in Stanford's 18 hole
tournament earlier this season, the
Stanford-San Jose tie for first in
this year's Cal State Hayward
tournament, and last weekend's
two shot Cardinal victory in the
U.S. Collegiate Invitational.
Tomorrow San Jose State
coach Jerry Vroom is expected to
go with his usual lineup — Mark
Lye, Jim Knoll, Phil Barry
(runnerup to Card sophomore
Conrad Nilmeier in last week's
tourney), Thames, Dean May and
Kim Porter — but Stanford coach
Bud Finger has announced a
minor lineup change after the
results of last week's tournament.
John Beers, a senior who had
the second best competitive
average on Stanford's 1971 team
before studying at Stanford in
England last season, will make his
first 1973 varsity appearance
tomorrow, replacing sophomore
Bob Chapman in the Card lineup.
Beers earned his starting berth
by firing rounds of 75-75-76 while
playing for the junior varsity in
last week's tournament. His 226
total was good for a tie for 15th
in the 204-man field.
Only 5-7 and 145 pounds,
Beers thrashes at the ball in a
manner which has never been
described as graceful, but he loves
to compete and possesses an
uncanny touch around the greens.
In 1971 he didn't lose a single
point in dual match competition.
Finger will play Beers in the
sixth position with the other five
spots determined strictly on the
basis of current competitive
averages. Denny Colvin (74.9) will
lead the Card lineup, followed by
Dave Baskins (75.2), Aly Trompas
(75.4), Conrad Nilmeier (76.4),
George Pettinger (77.5), and
Beers.
