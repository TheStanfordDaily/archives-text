# Card Netters Favored In Women's Tourney

### 
Stanford will be favored to win
the team title when play begins
this afternoon in the Northern
California Intercollegiate Athletic
Conference women's tennis
tournament. A total of 16 teams
is entered in the event, which
continues through tomorrow at
San Francisco State.
Stanford coach Curly Neal has
announced an impressive lineup,
including last year's singles
champion. Sophomore Andrea
Barnes will defend her conference
singles crown but she should be
challenged by teammate Tracy
McNair. Last year Barnes defeated
McNair in the singles final.
Playing doubles for Stanford
will be the first doubles team of
Whitney Grant and Terry Albert
and a second team comprised of
Maureen O'Keefe and Kathy
Wright.
Neal considers Stanford the

top team in the 16-team field, but
expects Fresno State, California,
Chico State, and UC Davis to give
her squad some tough
competition.
Wednesday Stanford improved
its dual match record to 6-0 with
an easy 5-1 victory over San Jose
State. Albert squeaked past her
San Jose State opponent 6-3, 4-6,
6-1 in the first singles match, but
Grant and Ann Feeley both won
easily in the other singles matches.
Vicki Van Dyke and Molly
Tyson lost 6-3, 6-4 to San Jose's
top doubles team before easy
straight set victories by the teams
of Meredith Brittain-Kathy Capps
and Janet Hayes-Kathy Beaumont
completed the 5-1 Stanford
victory.
Next Thursday the team will
travel to Seattle for the Pacific
Eight championships.
