# Cellar-Dwelling Cards Host Baseball Bruins
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Stanford hopes to play its way
out of the Pacific Eight Southern
Division baseball cellar this
weekend when the Cards host the
UCLA Bruins in a three game
series at Sunken Diamond. The
two teams will play at 2:30 p.m.
today and square off again
tomorrow in a noon
doubleheader.
Coach Ray Young, whose
Cardinals are 4-8 in the league and
32-17 overall, can't remember the
last time Stanford occupied the
Pac-8 cellar. "I can't remember
ever being last — at least since I've
been here," Young said. "But we
don't intend to end up in last
place by any means."
With six conference games
remaining (three this weekend
against UCLA and three next
weekend against California),
Stanford stands five and a half
games behind league-leading USC,
a game and a half behind the
second place Bruins (UCLA is 5-6
in the league and 27-16 overall),
and a game behind Cal.
"What we're trying to do now
is finish .500 or better in the
league," Young said. "We're
trying to put together as much of
a win streak as we can to finish
second in the conference."
Earlier this week Young said
the Cards "loosened up with the
bat and started hitting the ball a
little bit better" in two non-league
victories against University of

Pacific and St. Mary's. Stanford
collected 31 hits and 16 runs in
those two games, blanking UOP
6-0 on Tuesday before routing the
Gaels 10-1 Wednesday.
In Wednesday's game at
Moraga, Pat Rusco and Bruce
Robinson each went
three-for-four and pitcher Ken
Grolle contributed to his own
cause with a home run. Grolle
went the distance on the mound,
allowing just six hits and striking
out seven as he improved his
season record to 5-4. Stanford
hurlers had pitched 31-2/3
consecutive scoreless innings until
Grolle allowed an unearned run in
the ninth.
But despite those non-league
successes, Stanford will have to
reverse some recent trends this
weekend if the Cards are to move
up in the Pac-8 standings.
Stanford hasn't swept a three
game league series in two years
and this season the Cards have
dropped two out of three games
in every conference series.
Apparently it doesn't matter to
the Cards whether they're playing
defending national champions
USC or lowly Cal, the only team
in the Pac-8 Southern Division
with an overall record under .500.
This weekend Young will
entrust pitchers Bob DiPietro,
Dave Frost, and A 1 Arthur with
the task of reversing Stanford's
Pac-8 fortunes. DiPietro (4-2,
1.56) will face UCLA's John
Rouse (5-1, 2.88) in today's game.
Tomorrow's probable pitching
assignments match Frost (4-0,
1.88) against UCLA's Greg Zail
(6-2, 4.02) in the first game with
A 1 Arthur (6-2, 1.61) hurling
against the Bruins' Frank Panick
(5-3, 2.99) in the nightcap. Arthur
shutout USC 3-0 last Saturday for
his first Pac-8 victory, allowing
only three Trojan hits.
Frost, a bruising 6-6, 230
pound junior who spends his

winters on Stanford's varsity
basketball team, will be starting
his first Pac-8 contest. In two
years of non-league decisions,
Frost has a perfect 8-0 record.
Frost, Arthur, and DiPietro
will be facing some explosive
Bruin bats. UCLA boasta a 2.88
team batting average, with seven
players hitting over .300.
The most dangerous Bruin
hitter is Bob Adams, who has 11
home runs and 40 RBl's in 39*
games. Adams is currently fourth
in the nation in home runs per
game.
On the Stanford side, Bob
Hampton continues to lead the
Cardinal hitters with a .382
overall average and a .425 mark in
Pac-8 play. Hampton has also
belted five home runs.

little bit better" in two non-league
victories against University of

Pacific and St. Mary's. Stanford
collected 31 hits and 16 runs in
those two games, blanking UOP
6-0 on Tuesday before routing the
Gaels 10-1 Wednesday.
In Wednesday's game at
Moraga, Pat Rusco and Bruce
Robinson each went
three-for-four and pitcher Ken
Grolle contributed to his own
cause with a home run. Grolle
went the distance on the mound,
allowing just six hits and striking
out seven as he improved his
season record to 5-4. Stanford
hurlers had pitched 31-2/3
consecutive scoreless innings until
Grolle allowed an unearned run in
the ninth.
But despite those non-league
successes, Stanford will have to
reverse some recent trends this
weekend if the Cards are to move
up in the Pac-8 standings.
Stanford hasn't swept a three
game league series in two years
and this season the Cards have
dropped two out of three games
in every conference series.
Apparently it doesn't matter to
the Cards whether they're playing
defending national champions
USC or lowly Cal, the only team
in the Pac-8 Southern Division
with an overall record under .500.
This weekend Young will
entrust pitchers Bob DiPietro,
Dave Frost, and A 1 Arthur with
the task of reversing Stanford's
Pac-8 fortunes. DiPietro (4-2,
1.56) will face UCLA's John
Rouse (5-1, 2.88) in today's game.
Tomorrow's probable pitching
assignments match Frost (4-0,
1.88) against UCLA's Greg Zail
(6-2, 4.02) in the first game with
A 1 Arthur (6-2, 1.61) hurling
against the Bruins' Frank Panick
(5-3, 2.99) in the nightcap. Arthur
shutout USC 3-0 last Saturday for
his first Pac-8 victory, allowing
only three Trojan hits.
Frost, a bruising 6-6, 230
pound junior who spends his

winters on Stanford's varsity
basketball team, will be starting
his first Pac-8 contest. In two
years of non-league decisions,
Frost has a perfect 8-0 record.
Frost, Arthur, and DiPietro
will be facing some explosive
Bruin bats. UCLA boasta a 2.88
team batting average, with seven
players hitting over .300.
The most dangerous Bruin
hitter is Bob Adams, who has 11
home runs and 40 RBl's in 39*
games. Adams is currently fourth
in the nation in home runs per
game.
On the Stanford side, Bob
Hampton continues to lead the
Cardinal hitters with a .382
overall average and a .425 mark in
Pac-8 play. Hampton has also
belted five home runs.
Stanford hopes to play its way
out of the Pacific Eight Southern
Division baseball cellar this
weekend when the Cards host the
UCLA Bruins in a three game
series at Sunken Diamond. The
two teams will play at 2:30 p.m.
today and square off again
tomorrow in a noon
doubleheader.
Coach Ray Young, whose
Cardinals are 4-8 in the league and
32-17 overall, can't remember the
last time Stanford occupied the
Pac-8 cellar. "I can't remember
ever being last — at least since I've
been here," Young said. "But we
don't intend to end up in last
place by any means."
With six conference games
remaining (three this weekend
against UCLA and three next
weekend against California),
Stanford stands five and a half
games behind league-leading USC,
a game and a half behind the
second place Bruins (UCLA is 5-6
in the league and 27-16 overall),
and a game behind Cal.
"What we're trying to do now
is finish .500 or better in the
league," Young said. "We're
trying to put together as much of
a win streak as we can to finish
second in the conference."
Earlier this week Young said
the Cards "loosened up with the
bat and started hitting the ball a
little bit better" in two non-league
victories against University of

Pacific and St. Mary's. Stanford
collected 31 hits and 16 runs in
those two games, blanking UOP
6-0 on Tuesday before routing the
