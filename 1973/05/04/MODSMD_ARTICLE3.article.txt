# Haldeman-Ehrlichman Testimony Heard By Watergate Grand Jury
## 
### Associated Press 
WASHINGTON — Former presidential
aides H.R. Haldeman and John D.
Ehrlichman began testifying before the
Watergate grand jury yesterday. Their
lawyer said they are confident of
acquittal if indicted.
Both men resigned from the White
House staff Monday after news

accounts and other sources linked
them to an alleged coverup of the
Watergate wiretapping. Ehrlichman has
been tied to two other scandals as
well, an alleged burglary in the
Pentagon papers case and a Lebanese
bank deal promoted by accused
mutual fund looter Robert L. Vesco.
Haldeman, who had been Nixon's
chief of staff, and Ehrlichman, his
chief domestic adviser, spent the
morning talking with chief prosecutor
Earl Silbert.
They began giving testimony in the
afternoon. Ehrlichman went first.
Their lawyer, John J. Wilson, said
neither would claim any protection
against self-incrimination.
Wilson was asked by newsmen if his
clients fear they will be indicted.
No Fear Of Conviction
"I don't know about that," he said.
"But they have no fear of being
convicted."
Ehrlichman testified for nearly four
hours. Then Haldeman, who had been

waiting outside during that time,
entered the grand jury room.
Ehrlichman said he answered
questions "very fully." When asked
whether he had invoked the Fifth
Amendment, he said, "Oh my no.
Gracious no. I wouldn't take the Fifth
Amendment under any
circumstances."
Special Prosecutor
Meanwhile yesterday, reports
rumors and speculation mounted from
many sides, saying that Elliot L.
Richardson, named by the President to
be attorney general, is about to select
a special prosecutor to take over the
case. Richardson said only, "I have the
whole question under deliberation."
One of Ehrlichman's former
proteges, Egil Krogh, was reliably
reported to be preparing a complete
statement about his involvement with
Watergate conspirators E. Howard
Hunt and G. Gordon Liddy, who are
alleged to have burglarized the office
of a psychiatrist treating Daniel

Ellsberg, defendant in the Pentagon
Papers trial.
Leave Of Absence
Krogh, who took sudden leave
Wednesday of his $42,500-a-year job
as Undersecretary of Transportation,
supervised a squad of "plumbers"
Ehrlichman set up in July 1971 to
investigate the source of the secret
documents. The crew included Hunt,
Liddy and David Young, a staff
member of the National Security
Council who resigned last month
without announcement or
explanation.
A reliable source said Krogh would
waive any constitutional rights in
making his statement, which he
intends to submit within a few days to
U.S. District Judge Matt Byrne, who is
presiding at Ellsberg's trial.
In another Watergate development,

fired by Nixon as his own official
