# Haldeman-Ehrlichman Testimony Heard By Watergate Grand Jury
## 
### Associated Press 
WASHINGTON â€” Former presidential
aides H.R. Haldeman and John D.
Ehrlichman began testifying before the
Watergate grand jury yesterday. Their
lawyer said they are confident of
acquittal if indicted.
Both men resigned from the White
House staff Monday after news

accounts and other sources linked
them to an alleged coverup of the
Watergate wiretapping. Ehrlichman has
been tied to two other scandals as
well, an alleged burglary in the
Pentagon papers case and a Lebanese
bank deal promoted by accused
mutual fund looter Robert L. Vesco.
Haldeman, who had been Nixon's
chief of staff, and Ehrlichman, his
chief domestic adviser, spent the
morning talking with chief prosecutor
Earl Silbert.
They began giving testimony in the
afternoon. Ehrlichman went first.
Their lawyer, John J. Wilson, said
neither would claim any protection
against self-incrimination.
Wilson was asked by newsmen if his
clients fear they will be indicted.
No Fear Of Conviction
"I don't know about that," he said.
"But they have no fear of being
convicted."
Ehrlichman testified for nearly four
hours. Then Haldeman, who had been

waiting outside during that time,
entered the grand jury room.
Ehrlichman said he answered
questions "very fully." When asked
whether he had invoked the Fifth
Amendment, he said, "Oh my no.
Gracious no. I wouldn't take the Fifth
Amendment under any
circumstances."
Special Prosecutor
Meanwhile yesterday, reports
rumors and speculation mounted from
many sides, saying that Elliot L.
Richardson, named by the President to
be attorney general, is about to select
a special prosecutor to take over the
case. Richardson said only, "I have the
whole question under deliberation."
One of Ehrlichman's former
proteges, Egil Krogh, was reliably
reported to be preparing a complete
statement about his involvement with
Watergate conspirators E. Howard
Hunt and G. Gordon Liddy, who are
alleged to have burglarized the office
of a psychiatrist treating Daniel

Ellsberg, defendant in the Pentagon
Papers trial.
Leave Of Absence
Krogh, who took sudden leave
Wednesday of his $42,500-a-year job
as Undersecretary of Transportation,
supervised a squad of "plumbers"
Ehrlichman set up in July 1971 to
investigate the source of the secret
documents. The crew included Hunt,
Liddy and David Young, a staff
member of the National Security
Council who resigned last month
without announcement or
explanation.
A reliable source said Krogh would
waive any constitutional rights in
making his statement, which he
intends to submit within a few days to
U.S. District Judge Matt Byrne, who is
presiding at Ellsberg's trial.
In another Watergate development,
the Washington Evening Star said
lawyers for John W. Dean 111, who was
fired by Nixon as his own official
lawyer, have been negotiating with
federal prosecutors trying to gain
immunity from prosecution in return
for Dean's testimony before the grand
jury and at trial.
The newspaper said the prosecutors
are "seriously considering" granting
immunity. Dean has vowed publicly he
won't be a "scapegoat" in the affair,
and has let it be known he will
implicate others.

An accoustical wall will be added
between the main auditorium and the
Little Theater so that both facilities
can be used at once. Nelson also
suggested that a multi-million dollar
Music Department building might be
added to the auditorium.
Frost Amphitheater
Frost Amphitheater may have
cement seats in the future to "upgrade
the facilities so that it can be adaptive
to more types of public events,"
Nelson said. "In the past they have
had problems when they have had
rock concerts and other activities there
for which the facility wasn't
designed."
A Solar Observatory will be built
near the radio-telescope, and the
National Bureau for Economic
Research, a private foundation, will be
located on University leased land near
the golf course. No figure on costs or
dates for construction were available.
Several projects are already under
construction, including the $12.2
million Law School, to be completed
in 1974, and the outdoor Primate
Center, Escondido Multipurpose
Building, the Athletics Stage II
swimming facility, and the Centrex
telephone exchange, which will all be
completed this year.
Over 1000 parking spaces will be
eliminated by the new construction
said Nelson. However, these spaces will
be replaced by several new and
existing parking lots placed near
Campus Drive, which will be extended
to encircle the campus. According to a
University planning report, no parking
lots will be more than eight minutes
walking distance away from the inner
Quad. "In this climate there will be no
hardship in walking," Nelson claimed.
Questioned about the handicapped,
parking late at night, and other
problems, Nelson replied, "We've
anticipated all these things. There are

always adjustment problems. But once
the new pattern is accepted it may be
better than the present."
With the completion of the
program in the early 1980's the
University will be in a "Dynamic
Steady State," in which there will be
no major increase in faculty, staff,
students or facilities.
"We will level off; we will change as
new areas open up; but sometime well
have to eliminate less desirable areas,"
McGhie said.
However, President Richard Lyman
said that the construction should not
be viewed as the "be all, end all of
building." What then was planned in
the 1980's? Lyman responded, "That's
too far ahead for me to possibly
contemplate."
