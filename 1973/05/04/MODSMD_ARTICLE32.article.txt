# ‘Daily’ Faces Administration Lackeys In Softball Grudge Match Tomorrow
## 
### ED KOHN 
The Administration, failing in
typical fashion to learn the lessons
of history, has foolishly accepted
a Daily challenge to a softball
game, which will be played
tomorrow at 11 a.m. on the
freshman baseball diamond next
to El Camino.
Last fall, the Administration
Lackeys were humiliated in a
football game with the Daily,
28-14. In that game, the
Administration once again
displayed its penchant for
dropping the ball, and went down
to defeat.
The Lackeys have been racked
by dissension since that game, but
Vice Provost and Advisor to the
President Robert Rosenzweig
pulled off a bloodless coup and
has organized the Lackeys for
tomorrow's softball clash.

University Relations Director
Frank (Motel 6) Newman has
stepped aside to promote team
unity.
Flushed with overconfidence,
Lackey Coach Roly Poly Rosy
sent the following very insulting
note to the editor of the Daily:
"I shall keep this short because
I know that you and your 'Daily'
associates have a short attention
span. And since the signs are that
English may not be your native
language, I shall keep it simple,
too.
"Your letter of challenge to
Frank Newman was not only
misguided buy misdirected.
Fortunately, Frank is a natural
lackey, so he sent it to me — the
athletic director and coach of
administration sports. Personally,
I thought that you 'Daily' types
had learned your lesson at last
fall's football game. The
Administration Lackeys tried hard
to teach you the true meaning of
class — it was we, after all, who
provided the pom-pon girls, the
champagne, and the Oregon State
Marching Band. Alas, it appears
that we were no more successful
at teaching you than the faculty
has been.
"We will not shirk our duty
however. There is just the
slimmest chance that the change
in leadership at the 'Daily' since
last fall may have produced a
spirit more open to learning,
though heaven knows it has not
reduced the need. Therefore, on
behalf of my team of Lackeys I
accept your challenge to a softball
game.
"Fully in the spirit of your
team mottd — Noblesse Oblige — I
am,
Robert M. Rosenzweig"
Coach Roly Poly Rosy has
assembled a powerful team from
the administration ranks if that is
not a contradiction in terms. The
squad includes: Jim "Hobo"
Siena, Legal Advisor to the
President; Assistant to the
President Sal Sanchez; Tresidder
Financial Manager Gordon Starr;
Vice Provost Arthur Bienenstock;
Assistant Staff Counsel Gerald
Halligan; Dean of Students Robert
Freelen; many other
Administration notables; and a
few surprises.

'Daily' Coach Charlie Hoffman
will counter with a power-packed
lineup including Beautiful Buz
Battle, Glenn Kramon, Hall Daily,
Dave Robinson, Don Tollefson,
Mark Simonian, Terry Anzur,
Christy Wise, Doyle McManus,
Viae Kershner, Andrew Bridges,
and Bill Euphrat.
Umpires will be drawn from
the ranks of the faculty. The
'Daily' demanded that the
umpires have tenure to prevent
the Administration from
influencing any of their decisions.
The Lackeys held a practice
Tuesday afternoon on the Wilbur
lawn, after which Newman,
sickened by the sight of his team
in action, asked the 'Daily' for
asylum. Incompetence was
displayed in every phase of the

game, partially due to the high
rate of beer consumption during
the practice.
The Lackeys also had
numerous equipment problems.
Slippery Jim Siena's 39.95
Florsheim shoes were giving him
problems on the basepaths, Gerry
Halligan kept snagging his tie as he
tried to bat, Rosy could not get
over his pipe fixation, and Gordon
Starr will have to learn that he
can't play right field with a
Coors can clutched in his hand at
all times.
All in all, tomorrow's game
promises to be a close contest.
Coaches Rosenzweig and Hoffman
anticipate a highly partisan crowd
turnout to increase action on the
sidelines since the action on the
field will probably be limited.

THE BOSS — 'Daily' Softball coach and part time editor-in-chief
Charlie Hoffman will direct the 'Daily' forces in tomorrow's 11 a.m.
confrontation against the Administration Lackeys at the frosh
baseball diamond. The 6-7 Hoffman, nicknamed "The Tree" for his
exploits on the football field, will play first base and bat fifth in
addition to his managerial duties.
