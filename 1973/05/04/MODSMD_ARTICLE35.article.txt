# Chris Pleased With Progress
## Grid Practice ‘On Schedule’ 
### 
One week before the annual
Red-White scrimmage concludes
spring football drills, head coach
Jack Christiansen says his team's
progress "is about like you would
figure at this time of year.
"The young kids are
improving," Chris said yesterday,
"especially on the offensive line,
where we need the most help.
We're not progressing a whole lot
faster than I had hoped, but
certainly not any slower."
Christiansen's squad will
participate in a 60 minute
controlled scrimmage tomorrow
morning at 10:30, the Cards third
scrimmage in as many Saturdays.
Next week's Red-White scrimmage

will be a full scale game, except
that instead of kickoffs after
scores, the offensive team will get
the ball on their own 30 yard line.
So far Christiansen has been
most impressed with the work of
his defense. "I guess it's a natural
thing for the defense to be ahead
of the offense at this stage," he
said, "especially since we have so
many new receivers and new
offensive linemen."
Christiansen has been
particularly impressed with the
play of defensive backs Randy
Poltl, James Ferguson, and Jim
Kaffen and defensive ends Roger
Stillwell and Pat Donovan.

"Donovan's really improved,"
Chris said of the 6-5, 220 pound
junior. "The other day he caught
one of our fastest backs from
behind."
Offensively, Mike Boryla has
been passing well, and Chris has
also been impressed by upcoming
sophomore Jerry Waldvogel's
strong throwing arm. Christiansen
also mentioned the running of
John Winesberry and Scott
Laidlaw and receivers Bill Singler
and Brad Williams as early strong
points.
Next Saturday's Red-White
game will be played at 9:30 a.m.
at Stanford Stadium.
