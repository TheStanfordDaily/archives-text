# Cortez Scores Hole-In-One
## 
### 
Stanford golf manager
Rich Cortez recorded a
hole-in-one yesterday on the
Stanford course, sinking his
five iron tee shot on the 165
yard eighth hole. The shot
was witnessed by varsity
golfers Aly Trompas and
George Pettinger.
Cortez' ace was one of
several unbelievable scores in
the ninth hole round.
Pettinger eagled both the first
and seventh holes, Trompas
added birdies on three and
four, and Cortez also birdied
the third hole.
The three golfers
combined for a best ball score
of 28, eight under par.
