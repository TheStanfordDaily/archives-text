Guerrillas Raid Beirut Airport
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Palestinian guerrillas fired at Beirut's
international airport late last night as heavy fighting
between the guerrillas and government troops raged on.
Lebanese air force jets earlier rocketed and strafed
guerrilla positions near the airport.
In the second day of fighting in and around the capital,
army tanks blasted at guerrillas holed up inside apartment
houses. Reports reaching Beirut said the clashes had
spread to other parts of the nation, near the Israeli border.
Lebanon is a reluctant host to Palestinian guerrillas
because of Israeli strikes inside its territory in retaliation
for Palestinian attacks.
Reliable sources said guerrillas also had begun
infiltrating into Lebanon from Syria, in response to
appeals from the guerrilla command in Beirut.
April Wholesale Price Index Up
WASHINGTON — Wholesale prices of industrial goods
rose sharply last month, but some farm and food prices
declined for the first time in six months, the Labor
Department said yesterday.
Meat prices dropped 2.9 percent in April, presumably
reflecting the nationwide consumer meat boycott and the
price ceilings imposed by President Nixon late in March.
But prices of industrial commodities including raw
materials and finished manufactured goods, jumped 1.4
percent in April, the steepest monthly hike since the early
Korean War year of 1951.
The over-all Wholesale Price Index rose eight-tenths of
one percent, following a record 2.2 percent increase in
March. The rate of advance was considered sharp, though
not as steep as in previous months.
Packard To Get Defense Post?
SAN FRANCISCO — Industrialist David Packard will be
nominated for Secretary of Defense, the San Francisco
Examiner said yesterday, quoting a Senate source.
A spokesman for Packard confirmed that Packard was
in Washington at President Nixon's request to discuss the
top Pentagon job. Packard is a former deputy defense
secretary.
The Examiner quoted a ranking Democrat on the
Senate Armed Services Committee as saying Packard
would be the nominee. The committee must approve the
nomination.
"It's true he is in Washington," said John Kane,
spokesman for Hewlett-Packard Co., the Palo Alto, Calif,
electronics firm Packard co-founded. "He was called by
President Nixon and he left yesterday at noon," Kane
said. Packard was to return last night, he said.
Asked if Packard was talking with Nixon about the
defense post, Kane said, "I understand that is the topic of
conversation."
Nixon: Renewed Air War Possible
WASHINGTON — North Vietnam risks renewed war with
the United States unless it lives up to the Vietnam
cease-fire and withdraws its forces from Cambodia and
Laos, President Nixon said yesterday.
He also indicated the chances of improved U.S.
relations with the Soviet Union and China are threatened
by what he said was continued North Vietnamese
aggressions.
This fourth and strongest warning over claimed
Communist violations of the Jan. 27 settlement came in
Nixon's annual State of the World message to Congress.
He indicated American tolerance has been tested to the
breaking point and Hanoi now has two choices.
"The first is to exploit the Vietnam agreement and
press its objectives in Indochina. In this case it would

continue to infiltrate men and material into South
Vietnam, keep its forces in Laos and Cambodia and
through pressure or outright attack renew its aggression
against our friends."
Fighting Continues In Cambodia
PHNOM PENH — Communist forces in Cambodia overran
two government battalions near the South Vietnamese
border, reports from here said yesterday. The Viet Cong
and South Vietnamese held another round of their
deadlocked political talks in Paris.
Sources here said antigovernment troops killed 20
Cambodian soldiers and captured 580 others when the
positions were overrun on Monday near Neak Luong on
the Mekong River.
Fighting raged Wednesday and Thursday between
insurgents and three government battalions south of Neak
Luong, but there were no immediate reports of casualties.
Byrne To Receive Testimony
LOS ANGELES — E. Howard Hunt's testimony before a
Washington D.C., grand jury about an alleged burglary of
Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office was ordered turned
over to the Pentagon Papers trial judge yesterday.
Chief U.S. District Court Judge John J. Sirica in
Washington ordered the action after Judge Matt Byrne in
Los Angeles demanded the government tell him anything
Hunt told the Washington grand jury about the alleged
burglary.
Prosecutors told Judge Sirica during a brief hearing in
Washington that Hunt, a convicted Watergate conspirator,
had testified about the burglary. Sirica ordered relevant
portions of the grand jury minutes forwarded to Judge
Byrne.
In Los Angeles, defense attorneys told reporters
outside court their sources have told them Hunt told the
grand jury that there was a burglary of psychiatrist Lewis
Fielding's office and that Hunt and another Watergate
conspirator, G. Gordon Liddy, "participated in the
burglary and were in Fieldings's office."
Richardson May Name Prosecutor
WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Elliot L. Richardson
met with Republican senators yesterday but made no
commitment on demands he name an independent
Watergate prosecutor before being confirmed as attorney
general.
"I have the whole question under deliberation,"
Richardson told newsmen after the meeting.
He declined to comment on reports a special
prosecutor already has been named.
Earlier, Sen. Birch Bayh (D-Ind.), a member of the
Judiciary Committee which must pass on Richardson's
nomination, said he believed approval should hinge on
Richardson's cooperation with the Senate Watergate
investigating committee.
Today's Weather
Mostly fair through tomorrow but low cloudiness over
much of the area this forenoon. Slightly warmer
tomorrow. Low temperatures both nights in the mid 40s
to low 50s. High today and tomorrow in the 60s to low

Byrne To Receive Testimony
LOS ANGELES — E. Howard Hunt's testimony before a
Washington D.C., grand jury about an alleged burglary of
Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office was ordered turned
over to the Pentagon Papers trial judge yesterday.
Chief U.S. District Court Judge John J. Sirica in
Washington ordered the action after Judge Matt Byrne in
Los Angeles demanded the government tell him anything
Hunt told the Washington grand jury about the alleged
burglary.
Prosecutors told Judge Sirica during a brief hearing in
Washington that Hunt, a convicted Watergate conspirator,
had testified about the burglary. Sirica ordered relevant
portions of the grand jury minutes forwarded to Judge
Byrne.
In Los Angeles, defense attorneys told reporters
outside court their sources have told them Hunt told the
grand jury that there was a burglary of psychiatrist Lewis
Fielding's office and that Hunt and another Watergate
conspirator, G. Gordon Liddy, "participated in the
burglary and were in Fieldings's office."
Richardson May Name Prosecutor
WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Elliot L. Richardson
met with Republican senators yesterday but made no
commitment on demands he name an independent
Watergate prosecutor before being confirmed as attorney
general.
"I have the whole question under deliberation,"
Richardson told newsmen after the meeting.
He declined to comment on reports a special
prosecutor already has been named.
Earlier, Sen. Birch Bayh (D-Ind.), a member of the
Judiciary Committee which must pass on Richardson's
nomination, said he believed approval should hinge on
Richardson's cooperation with the Senate Watergate
investigating committee.

Guerrillas Raid Beirut Airport
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Palestinian guerrillas fired at Beirut's
international airport late last night as heavy fighting
between the guerrillas and government troops raged on.
Lebanese air force jets earlier rocketed and strafed
guerrilla positions near the airport.
In the second day of fighting in and around the capital,
army tanks blasted at guerrillas holed up inside apartment
houses. Reports reaching Beirut said the clashes had
spread to other parts of the nation, near the Israeli border.
Lebanon is a reluctant host to Palestinian guerrillas
because of Israeli strikes inside its territory in retaliation
for Palestinian attacks.
Reliable sources said guerrillas also had begun
infiltrating into Lebanon from Syria, in response to
appeals from the guerrilla command in Beirut.
April Wholesale Price Index Up
WASHINGTON — Wholesale prices of industrial goods
rose sharply last month, but some farm and food prices
declined for the first time in six months, the Labor
Department said yesterday.
Meat prices dropped 2.9 percent in April, presumably
reflecting the nationwide consumer meat boycott and the
price ceilings imposed by President Nixon late in March.
But prices of industrial commodities including raw
materials and finished manufactured goods, jumped 1.4
percent in April, the steepest monthly hike since the early
Korean War year of 1951.
The over-all Wholesale Price Index rose eight-tenths of
one percent, following a record 2.2 percent increase in
March. The rate of advance was considered sharp, though
not as steep as in previous months.
Packard To Get Defense Post?
SAN FRANCISCO — Industrialist David Packard will be
nominated for Secretary of Defense, the San Francisco
Examiner said yesterday, quoting a Senate source.
A spokesman for Packard confirmed that Packard was
in Washington at President Nixon's request to discuss the
top Pentagon job. Packard is a former deputy defense
secretary.
The Examiner quoted a ranking Democrat on the
Senate Armed Services Committee as saying Packard
would be the nominee. The committee must approve the
nomination.
"It's true he is in Washington," said John Kane,
spokesman for Hewlett-Packard Co., the Palo Alto, Calif,
electronics firm Packard co-founded. "He was called by
President Nixon and he left yesterday at noon," Kane
said. Packard was to return last night, he said.
Asked if Packard was talking with Nixon about the
defense post, Kane said, "I understand that is the topic of
conversation."
Nixon: Renewed Air War Possible
WASHINGTON — North Vietnam risks renewed war with
the United States unless it lives up to the Vietnam
cease-fire and withdraws its forces from Cambodia and
Laos, President Nixon said yesterday.
He also indicated the chances of improved U.S.
relations with the Soviet Union and China are threatened
by what he said was continued North Vietnamese
aggressions.
This fourth and strongest warning over claimed
Communist violations of the Jan. 27 settlement came in
Nixon's annual State of the World message to Congress.
He indicated American tolerance has been tested to the
breaking point and Hanoi now has two choices.
"The first is to exploit the Vietnam agreement and
press its objectives in Indochina. In this case it would

continue to infiltrate men and material into South
Vietnam, keep its forces in Laos and Cambodia and
through pressure or outright attack renew its aggression
against our friends."
Fighting Continues In Cambodia
PHNOM PENH — Communist forces in Cambodia overran
two government battalions near the South Vietnamese
border, reports from here said yesterday. The Viet Cong
and South Vietnamese held another round of their
deadlocked political talks in Paris.

Cambodian soldiers and captured 580 others when the
positions were overrun on Monday near Neak Luong on

materials and finished manufactured goods, jumped 1.4
percent in April, the steepest monthly hike since the early
Korean War year of 1951.
The over-all Wholesale Price Index rose eight-tenths of
one percent, following a record 2.2 percent increase in
March. The rate of advance was considered sharp, though
not as steep as in previous months.
Packard To Get Defense Post?
SAN FRANCISCO — Industrialist David Packard will be
nominated for Secretary of Defense, the San Francisco
Examiner said yesterday, quoting a Senate source.
A spokesman for Packard confirmed that Packard was
in Washington at President Nixon's request to discuss the
top Pentagon job. Packard is a former deputy defense
secretary.
The Examiner quoted a ranking Democrat on the
Senate Armed Services Committee as saying Packard
would be the nominee. The committee must approve the
nomination.
"It's true he is in Washington," said John Kane,
spokesman for Hewlett-Packard Co., the Palo Alto, Calif,
electronics firm Packard co-founded. "He was called by
President Nixon and he left yesterday at noon," Kane
said. Packard was to return last night, he said.
Asked if Packard was talking with Nixon about the
defense post, Kane said, "I understand that is the topic of
conversation."
Nixon: Renewed Air War Possible
WASHINGTON — North Vietnam risks renewed war with
the United States unless it lives up to the Vietnam
cease-fire and withdraws its forces from Cambodia and
Laos, President Nixon said yesterday.
He also indicated the chances of improved U.S.
relations with the Soviet Union and China are threatened
by what he said was continued North Vietnamese
aggressions.
This fourth and strongest warning over claimed
Communist violations of the Jan. 27 settlement came in
Nixon's annual State of the World message to Congress.
He indicated American tolerance has been tested to the
breaking point and Hanoi now has two choices.
"The first is to exploit the Vietnam agreement and
press its objectives in Indochina. In this case it would

continue to infiltrate men and material into South
Vietnam, keep its forces in Laos and Cambodia and
through pressure or outright attack renew its aggression
against our friends."
Fighting Continues In Cambodia
PHNOM PENH — Communist forces in Cambodia overran
two government battalions near the South Vietnamese
border, reports from here said yesterday. The Viet Cong
and South Vietnamese held another round of their
deadlocked political talks in Paris.
Sources here said antigovernment troops killed 20
Cambodian soldiers and captured 580 others when the
positions were overrun on Monday near Neak Luong on
the Mekong River.
Fighting raged Wednesday and Thursday between
insurgents and three government battalions south of Neak
Luong, but there were no immediate reports of casualties.
Byrne To Receive Testimony
LOS ANGELES — E. Howard Hunt's testimony before a
Washington D.C., grand jury about an alleged burglary of
Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office was ordered turned
over to the Pentagon Papers trial judge yesterday.
Chief U.S. District Court Judge John J. Sirica in
Washington ordered the action after Judge Matt Byrne in
Los Angeles demanded the government tell him anything
Hunt told the Washington grand jury about the alleged
burglary.
Prosecutors told Judge Sirica during a brief hearing in
Washington that Hunt, a convicted Watergate conspirator,
had testified about the burglary. Sirica ordered relevant
portions of the grand jury minutes forwarded to Judge
Byrne.
In Los Angeles, defense attorneys told reporters
outside court their sources have told them Hunt told the
grand jury that there was a burglary of psychiatrist Lewis
Fielding's office and that Hunt and another Watergate
conspirator, G. Gordon Liddy, "participated in the
burglary and were in Fieldings's office."
Richardson May Name Prosecutor
WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Elliot L. Richardson
met with Republican senators yesterday but made no
commitment on demands he name an independent
Watergate prosecutor before being confirmed as attorney
general.
"I have the whole question under deliberation,"
Richardson told newsmen after the meeting.
He declined to comment on reports a special
prosecutor already has been named.
Earlier, Sen. Birch Bayh (D-Ind.), a member of the
Judiciary Committee which must pass on Richardson's
nomination, said he believed approval should hinge on
Richardson's cooperation with the Senate Watergate
investigating committee.

Guerrillas Raid Beirut Airport
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Palestinian guerrillas fired at Beirut's
international airport late last night as heavy fighting
between the guerrillas and government troops raged on.
Lebanese air force jets earlier rocketed and strafed
guerrilla positions near the airport.
In the second day of fighting in and around the capital,
army tanks blasted at guerrillas holed up inside apartment
houses. Reports reaching Beirut said the clashes had
spread to other parts of the nation, near the Israeli border.
Lebanon is a reluctant host to Palestinian guerrillas
because of Israeli strikes inside its territory in retaliation
for Palestinian attacks.
Reliable sources said guerrillas also had begun
infiltrating into Lebanon from Syria, in response to
appeals from the guerrilla command in Beirut.
April Wholesale Price Index Up
WASHINGTON — Wholesale prices of industrial goods
rose sharply last month, but some farm and food prices
declined for the first time in six months, the Labor
Department said yesterday.
Meat prices dropped 2.9 percent in April, presumably
reflecting the nationwide consumer meat boycott and the
price ceilings imposed by President Nixon late in March.
But prices of industrial commodities including raw
materials and finished manufactured goods, jumped 1.4
percent in April, the steepest monthly hike since the early
Korean War year of 1951.
The over-all Wholesale Price Index rose eight-tenths of
one percent, following a record 2.2 percent increase in
