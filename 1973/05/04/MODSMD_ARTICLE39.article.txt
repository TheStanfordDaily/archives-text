# Grad Student Electrocuted
## 
### 
The physics graduate student whose body was found Wednesday night
inside his blazing duplex home in unincorporated San Mateo County
apparently died of accidental electrocution, a coroner's spokesman said
yesterday.
However, the spokesman said the death of John Stephen Turk, 26, was
still "under investigation." According to the spokesman, Turk "had been
under psychiatric care." He explained that Turk had died "due to a short
circuit in the electrical cord" which he had apparently used as part of an
auto-erotic device.
Assistant San Mateo County Sheriff Eugene Stewart said the $3000 fire
at 11 Happy Hollow Lane was caused by the short circuit. The house is in
the Stanford Weekend Acres subdivision just off Alpine Road.
According to one of Turk's academic advisers, Associate Prof, of
Applied Physics Vahe Petrosian, Turk had been "going to some encounter
groups," but that his psychiatrist had reported that "Steve was very
happy" before his death.
Petrosian said Turk had worked at the Institute for Plasma Research
and was preparing a doctoral dissertation on astrophysics, which he
expected to finish in about one year.
