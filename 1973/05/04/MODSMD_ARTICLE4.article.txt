# Major Campus Construction Set; Early ’80’s Projected As Deadline
## 
### BILL WEINSTEIN Second Of Two Parts 
The University is beginning a major
building drive to "adequately house all
academic departments" by the early
1980's, according to Edward S. Shaw,
executive assistant to the Vice
President and Provost.
The construction will substantially
change the make-up of the campus and
will cost an estimated $83 million. The
Medical School will be greatly
enlarged, the Quad renovated, the
Engineering Department will move
into a new home, and a score of other
projects will rise in the next ten years,

financed in part by the $300 million
Campaign for Stanford fund drive.
The $16 million hospital expansion
will add new space for surgical
support, x-ray, intensive care, and
other crowded departments. As
Medical School Dean Clayton Rich
explained. "The hospital has had a
marked increase in the number of
patients. The objective is to add more
space for the laboratory support
departments." The building will be
located at the present emergency
entrance and Rich said the project will
be completed by 1976.
In addition, a grant from the

Fairchild Foundation will finance the
Center for the Neuro-Sciences, which
will house the Anatomy and
Physiology Departments. The $7.5
million structure is part of the overall
plan to consolidate all Med School
departments into one location.
As part of the overall University
plan, Shaw stated that the Medical
Center will expand towards the regular
campus. "The University will be
moving closer to the Medical Center.
We would like the University to be
adjacent to us," said Rich.
The Quad
The center of the campus will
remain the Quad, which will be
renovated at an unspecified date at a
cost of $35 million. The remodeling
will maintain the sandstone exterior
but will remodel the interiors to look
like the present Math Corner and
Psychology Department.
All departments in the School of
Humanities and Sciences will be
located in the Quad, surrounded by
the various graduate schools and
libraries, Shaw said.
The Main Library will expand into
the parking lot between the Hoover
Institution and UGLY. Unlike most of
the other new buildings, the $26
million addition will vary from the
sandstone-tile motif and will have a
multi-terraced design.
No date has been set for
groundbreaking and Oscar Nelson,
master planner for the University, said
that "we're still waiting for the money
to be raised."
New Chemistry Building
The Chemistry Department, housed
partially in the old chemistry building,
will move to a $7.2 million structure
in the Organic Chemistry parking lot.
To be used for graduate research,
faculty offices, and "60 percent for
undergraduate teaching," according to
department Vice Chairman Douglas
Skoog, the building will be completed
by 1977 or 1978. It will be financed
by a grant from Syntex Corp., the Palo
Alto drug firm.
The $7.5 million engineering
building will be located across the
street from the Storke Student
Publications Building. "We are
currently in 22 buildings," notes
Assoc. Dean L. Farrell McGhie. "It
I the new building) will house five of
our 10 departments, the Dean's office,
and the engineering library."
As a result of this consolidation,
McGhie said "we will be vacating
Engineering Corner, Building 300
which adjoins the Corner, Operations
Research which is at Encina, plus five
other buildings." McGhie predicted
that the building would be occupied
by 1977.
Research Park
A research park will also be built to
house temporary research projects. To
be located near the Nursing School,
Nelson said that an unusually
innovative design was being pursued.
"If they [the architects] come up
with an answer," said Nelson, "it
would be quite a breakthrough. We
will probably end up with something
that will probably look conventional
but it won't be concrete with a tile
roof."
Other projects to update and
improve campus facilities include a
$1.2 million repair job on the
fire-damaged Encina Hall, $500,000
for stadium improvements, and an
undesignated amount to update
backstage facilities at Memorial
Auditorium.

department Vice Chairman Douglas
Skoog, the building will be completed
by 1977 or 1978. It will be financed
by a grant from Syntex Corp., the Palo
Alto drug firm.
The $7.5 million engineering
building will be located across the
street from the Storke Student
Publications Building. "We are
currently in 22 buildings," notes
Assoc. Dean L. Farrell McGhie. "It
I the new building) will house five of
our 10 departments, the Dean's office,
and the engineering library."
As a result of this consolidation,
McGhie said "we will be vacating
Engineering Corner, Building 300
which adjoins the Corner, Operations
Research which is at Encina, plus five
other buildings." McGhie predicted
that the building would be occupied
by 1977.
Research Park
A research park will also be built to
house temporary research projects. To
be located near the Nursing School,
Nelson said that an unusually
innovative design was being pursued.
"If they [the architects] come up
with an answer," said Nelson, "it
would be quite a breakthrough. We
will probably end up with something
that will probably look conventional
but it won't be concrete with a tile
roof."
Other projects to update and
improve campus facilities include a
$1.2 million repair job on the
fire-damaged Encina Hall, $500,000
for stadium improvements, and an
undesignated amount to update
backstage facilities at Memorial
Auditorium.
The University is beginning a major
building drive to "adequately house all
academic departments" by the early
1980's, according to Edward S. Shaw,
executive assistant to the Vice
President and Provost.
The construction will substantially
change the make-up of the campus and
will cost an estimated $83 million. The
Medical School will be greatly
enlarged, the Quad renovated, the
Engineering Department will move
into a new home, and a score of other
projects will rise in the next ten years,

financed in part by the $300 million
Campaign for Stanford fund drive.
The $16 million hospital expansion
will add new space for surgical
support, x-ray, intensive care, and
other crowded departments. As
Medical School Dean Clayton Rich
explained. "The hospital has had a
marked increase in the number of
patients. The objective is to add more
space for the laboratory support
departments." The building will be
located at the present emergency
entrance and Rich said the project will
be completed by 1976.
In addition, a grant from the

Fairchild Foundation will finance the
Center for the Neuro-Sciences, which
will house the Anatomy and
Physiology Departments. The $7.5
million structure is part of the overall
plan to consolidate all Med School
departments into one location.
As part of the overall University
plan, Shaw stated that the Medical
Center will expand towards the regular
campus. "The University will be
moving closer to the Medical Center.
We would like the University to be
adjacent to us," said Rich.
The Quad
The center of the campus will
remain the Quad, which will be
renovated at an unspecified date at a
cost of $35 million. The remodeling
will maintain the sandstone exterior
but will remodel the interiors to look
like the present Math Corner and
Psychology Department.
All departments in the School of
Humanities and Sciences will be
located in the Quad, surrounded by
the various graduate schools and
libraries, Shaw said.
The Main Library will expand into
the parking lot between the Hoover
Institution and UGLY. Unlike most of
the other new buildings, the $26
million addition will vary from the
sandstone-tile motif and will have a
multi-terraced design.
No date has been set for
groundbreaking and Oscar Nelson,
master planner for the University, said
that "we're still waiting for the money
to be raised."
New Chemistry Building
The Chemistry Department, housed
partially in the old chemistry building,
will move to a $7.2 million structure
in the Organic Chemistry parking lot.
To be used for graduate research,
faculty offices, and "60 percent for
undergraduate teaching," according to
department Vice Chairman Douglas
Skoog, the building will be completed
by 1977 or 1978. It will be financed
by a grant from Syntex Corp., the Palo
Alto drug firm.
