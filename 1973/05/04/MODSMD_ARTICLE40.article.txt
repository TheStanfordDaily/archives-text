### 
Phi Delta Theta President Bob
Major apologized to Roble Hall
residents last night for a statement
he made Wednesday which he said
was "misconstrued."
In reference to the controversy
over the stripper raffled off at the
Phi Delt house two weeks ago,
Major told women who were
picketing the frat Wednesday, "all
houses do this. What do you
think they have for entertainment
in Roble?"
Major said last night he was
referring to pornographic movies
shown in Roble last November.
"It is my rationale that topless
dancers and nudity are a publicly
condoned form of entertainment.
As examples I used the topless
bars in North Beach and the
much-publicized showing of skin
flicks in Roble Hall.
"I would like to apologize to
any members of Roble Hall if my
statement was misconstrued. The
fact that it was Roble Hall means
nothing. It could have been any
dorm," Major concluded.
