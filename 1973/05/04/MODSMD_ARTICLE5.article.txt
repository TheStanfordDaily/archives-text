# Law School Dean Rejects Chicanos' Demands
## 
### JIM LOBSENZ 
Law School Dean Thomas Ehrlich yesterday rejected a
series of demands from the Chicano Law Students
Association (CLSA) calling for increased Chicano hiring
and admissions.
Ehrlich conceded that the Law School had "not been
in adequate contact with the matters of concern" to the
CLSA, and said that "in the future we will try to avoid
that mistake."
However, he turned down most of the demands offered
March 13 by the organization.
The CLSA had demanded that they be given full
authority to mail 30 acceptance letters to Chicano law
school applicants, and that they be entitled to full access
to the applicant files of Chicanos. Both of these demands
were rejected by Ehrlich.
No Minority Quotas
Ehrlich maintains that the demands are rooted in a
"misunderstanding," of admission policies. "There are no
quotas under the minority program," stated Ehrlich.
The CLSA had accused the Law School of admitting
Chicanos who "showed no Chicano identity, no concern
for Chicano problems, no dedication to the Chicano
people and no intention or desire to return to the Chicano
community after graduation."
Ehrlich termed such accusations "not relevant," and
further maintained that there is no evidence that present
Law School Chicano students fit that description, or that
such characteristics can be determined from an admissions
application.
A suggestion that Chicano applicants be given the
option to sign a waiver that would permit the CLSA to
have access to their file was also rejected by Ehrlich.
The March 13th demands of the CLSA had also
attacked the Law School for having such a drastically low

proportion of Chicano employees at all levels of the
school's administration.
Dean Agrees
Ehrlich agreed that the lack of Chicano employees was
"real," but claimed that both he and the CLSA
representatives with whom he met repeatedly "agreed that
the problem relates to the availability of Chicanos in the
applicant pool rather than a failure to hire those who do
apply."
Ehrlich resolved to take steps that would increase the
number of Chicano employees. He promised to direct the
Personnel Department to "give publicity to our staff
openings in those areas where Chicanos will be reached."
The CLSA demand that a special dean be appointed,
specifically for the handling of Chicano student affairs,
was also rejected.
"Given current budgetary and other limitations 1 do
not forsee any general expansion of the School's
administrative staff," explained Ehrlich. We will not be
able to hire a dean to deal exclusively with Chicano
matters any more than we have a dean for any other
group."
The CLSA, which had characterized the Law School as
"an oppressor of Chicanos," in its initial demand paper,
was largely dissatisfied with Dean Ehrlich's response, and
termed it "misleading."
Ralph Maltez, a spokesman for the CLSA, complained
that Ehrlich had "brought up some issues for the first
time," and failed to address "many of those issues we did
discuss with him."
Maltez also attacked Ehrlich for quoting the CLSA
position paper out of context, and stated that Ehrlich's
repeated use of the phrase "we (Ehrlich and the CSLA]
agreed," was highly misleading.
Maltez explained that nothing final will have been
agreed upon until the tentative agreements between
Ehrlich and the CSLA spokesman are "ratified."
