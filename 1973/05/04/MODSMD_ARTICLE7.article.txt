## Stone: Unpunished Murders 
### 
Daniel Brenner

Of the many tragic dimensions
of the Kent State killings, which
occurred three years ago today,
perhaps none is more depressing
than the investigations which
followed in its aftermath. A
special state grand jury in
Ravenna, ohio, indicted 25
persons —24 students and one
faculty member — on charges of
first degree rioting.
But the Federal Bureau of
Investigation tell another story,
one which has never been denied
— but never followed up, either.
I.F. Stone (who will speak at
Memorial Church at 8 p.m.
tonight on "The Lessons of Kent
State — And Watergate" crisply
summarized the conclusions of
the FBI report in The Killings At
Kent State (New York Review
Book: 1971, $1.95).
Stone does not deal in secret
memos or "informed sources": he
draws from the well of the
popular press, the mass media —
but makes his drawings with a fine
strainer, ever alert to things which
don't smell right.
One of these catches came
from the October 23, 1970,
Akron Beacon Journal, part of the
Knight newspaper chain, which
quoted a speech by then Senator
Stephen Young, a long-time
supporter of students. Young read
the Justice Department summary
of the FBI findings to the Senate,
which included this sensational
passage:
Most of the National
Guardsmen who did fire their
weapons do not specifically
claim that they fired because
their lives were in danger.
Rather, they generally state in
their narrative that they fired
after they heard others fire. .. .
We have some reason to believe
that the claim by the National
Guard that their lives were
endangered by the students
was fabricated subsequent to
the event, (emphasis added).
Tip of Iceberg
Using this statement by the
FBI as his footing, Stone steps
down on this tip of an ugly

iceberg to reveal public-domain
evidence which indicates just how
white the Ohio State Grand Jury
whitewash was. And he does so
with the coolness of a
dispassionate investigator-citizen
whose only aim is to get at the
truth, however awful it may
unfold.
Stone is hardly an apologist for
campus violence, but instead tries
to explain its context. "Student
violence is mindlessly
self-destructive," he writes, "but
ending it will require an effort to
understand the sources of the
desperation that underlies it."
Those sources have only widened
in the years since the Kent
disaster because the murders have
still gone unpunished.
But the sorrowful tale Stone
reports goes beyond a shoddy
coverup by trigger-happy

Guardsmen. Stone implies that
the retiring Republican governor
of Ohio has sent the Guardsmen
to the Kent campus in order to
manipulate the "student unrest"
issue to his party's electoral
advantage for an upcoming
primary. Stone concludes that the
state grand jury had no recourse
but to absolve the Guard; if the
jury had not, it would have been
tantamount to condemning the
man who made the decision to
put the Guards on the campus.
Grand Jury Investigation Urged
Stone concluded in this book,
which is composed of several
1970 New York Review of Books
articles and documentary evidence
relating to the case, that a possible
starting point for prosecution
would be a special federal grand
jury investigation.
The case seems too out of date,

however, to promote a national
outcry for justice for the slain
students. Perhaps it would be
better to set the files to rest and
close the case. Indeed, an effort
by the American Civil Liberties
Union to intervene in a suit
against the state of Ohio on behalf
of the parents of the murdered
students is yet to make legal
waves.
Whether or not justice is meted
out in this case, Stone's
recounting of the public evidence
only makes the tragedy that was
Kent State ever more tragic. And
for students, it sets into glaring
focus how concerned and
non-violent students can be killed
without a meaningful blink from
the eye of statutory justice.
