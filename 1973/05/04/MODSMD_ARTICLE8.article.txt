# TV Rerun Rot
## Star Drech For Din Din

These are the voyages of the
StarshipEnterprise in its five year
mission to pollute hyperspace and
mould the inhabitants of distant
galaxies into forms more
compatible with human value
systems. . . .
For many campus denizens,
and indeed, hundreds in the
greater Bay Area, the above credo
is an invitation to 60 solid
minutes of daily entertainment.
But for a restless and increasingly
agitated minority of residents in
9ome of the smaller living groups
around here, those words preface
an invitation to open internecine
warfare.
Those not initiated into the
jargon of television may fail to
recognize the opening lines of the
series, Star Trek. But even such
ignorants are beginning to increase
their awareness as this spaced-out

show is competing with their
inalienable right to a decent meal.
Repast Rerun
In an unbelievably pernicious
move, KTVU (Channel 2) has
decided to air Star Trek every
evening at 6:00 p.m. That is
precisely the time slot alotted for
the evening repast at the Xi house,
and perhaps for many other
residences as well. If your thing is
the six o'clock news, or eating
dinner in the presence of pleasant
company, then you too can join
the swelling ranks of those with a
conflict on their hands.
You may say, "The national
government is falling apart over
this Watergate affair and all this
stupid columnist can worry about
is a stupid TV show." I will reply
that I cannot better inform myself
of the criminal activities of the
Nixon bunch by watching Uncle

Walter on the news, because of
the criminally thoughtless
activities of the Xi Spacemen
bunch.
You may say, "Housewives all
around the country are outraged
over rising food prices, the
economy is running amok, and all
this stupid columnist can worry
about is a stupid show." I will
reply that I cannot enjoy the true
pleasure of my last few meat
meals if I am one of only four
people in a house of thirty dining
in the dining room.
C'est Le Outrage
Hear what some other
individuals have to say on the
matter, and then decide whether
the issue is worth discussing:
"This is an outrage," shouts Xi
boarder, Jim Gray; "And I can't
even go back to Durand to watch
the news, cause Star Trek spews
out of the TV screen there too.
"I feel like I'm trapped in a
tube tent," fcvails XI head hasher
G. Alec Rooke; "I can't see the
problem clearly to deal with it,
but I can't escape from the
situation or the house will have
my head: they're demanding I
come to a decision."
Tensions are certainly
mounting, along with piles of
dirty dishware downstairs in the
TV room. Serve dinner early and
the cook gets mad; serve it late
and the members are late for
evening classes. And that only
touches the surface of the iceberg
of problems created by
dinnertime Star Trek.
Quickie
People racing madly up from
the basement entertainment
complex to catch a quick dessert
during commercials are getting
into messy accidents, running into
innocent bystanders. The leftover
meal remains downstairs are
nourishing crowds of giant leering
vermin, and it's getting rather
expensive to feed prime rib and
salmon Creole to them as well as a
full house of people.
Lastly and most alarming, is
the rapidly decreasing quality of
vocabulary exhibited by the Star
Trek-infested members. They
meander through the house before
six each evening mumbling about
"warp factors" and "beaming
down."
We're trying to discover a
solution to the problem before
this Star Trek mind-sapping
madness affects us all, as it seems
to have affected this column. You

Think-Tank fund (tax deductible).
