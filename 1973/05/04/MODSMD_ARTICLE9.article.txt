## Rhetoric On Viet Vets 
### 
B. F. Sisk

For some time I have been disturbed by a blatant
inconcistency between the wo rds of this
administration and its actions. Nowhere is this more
obvious than in the rhetoric which the President has
employed concerning our Vietnam veterans and the
shabby manner in which the administration was
prepared to cut the benefits of those same veterans
who were disabled. You may recall that the
administration hastily backtracked on this matter of
cutting the percentages of disability allowed for
purposes of figuring compensations, when there was
a loud outcry from the Congress and from alert
veterans' organizations.
Whatever we may think of the Vietnam war, I
feel that the veterans of Vietnam are entitled to the
same consideration and concern we have
traditionally shown for our returning veterans.
Certainly those who have sacrificed their limbs,
their eyes, their hearing and their health for their
country should not find themselves discriminated
against by an administration that parades its pride in
them for public consumption — yet proposes to cut
back the value of their disability ratings.
Disability Compensation
Let us hope the administration has learned its
lesson from this attempt to cut veterans'
service-connected disability compensation. The
official statement was the proposal was withdrawn
"for further study." It is my understanding that this
supposed $160 million cut in veteran disability was
part of an overall Office of Management and Budget
plan to save $228 million iri VA outlays in 197 4 —
through administrative slashes in benefits, hospital
construction and medical research without
Congress' approval.
I rejoiced, as I'm sure we all did, in the return of
the prisoners of war. It was a relief to know that
these men, who had suffered so much and so long,

were at last coming home. But knowing as I did
what the real attitude of this administration is, I was
sickened by the stage-managed attempt to draw
attention away from its brazen proposal to cut
disabled veterans' benefits — a proposal which it has
never publicly abandoned but still has under
"further study."
Training And Aide
As you may recall, the President on October 24,
197 2, approved a bill to use VA hospitals to train
doctors and aides to relieve manpower shortages in
the VA and to build eight pilot medical schools in
geographically dispersed areas of the nation, the
schools to be affiliated with VA hospitals. We are
still pressing to have one of those schools sited in
PYesno, but no money is in the 19 74 budget to
carry out this much-needed plan.
You are probably aware that the Fresno Valley is
acutely low in the number of medical personnel per
thousand population. Money used to train medical
personnel, especially those who have had medical
training in the service, would be highly productive
for all of us — yet the penny wise and pound foolish
administration is concentrating on cutting back
facilities and personnel just when our veterans need
them most.
Indeed, I am appalled at the proposed cuts in
operating expenses. The VA should not be forced to
run a cut-rate type of care for these men who have
served their country are are disabled — some for life.
As the song sasy, "I Love A Parade.' I also love
my country and the men who have served it. All of
us owe these men more — a great deal more — than
speeches and welcomes. I call on this administration
to put its money where its mouth is.
