# Stone Tells Impact Of Kent State
## 
### JAMES LOBSENZ 
"I'm sorry that the Kent State
killings seem to have frightened a lot
of American students," asserted I.F.
Stone, columnist for the "New York
Review of Books."
Stone addressed a crowd of about
300 people in Memorial Church last
Friday at a memorial service for the
students killed at Kent State three
years ago.
"The shootings," maintained Stone,
"have had a bad psychological effect.
They scared a lot of nice white
middle-class college kids, and
frightened a lot of dissenters into
health foods, mysticism and the
Upanishads, and walking around
barefoot."
"It's a wonderful country," stated
Stone, "where a Republican judge,"
and "a rather conservative southern
senator work to bring out the truth
about Watergate. But it won't stay
that way unless enough kids kick up a
rumpus, and by God you'd better kick
up a rumpus now when it's easy. The
time is coming when it may be very
hard," he cautioned.
Stone told his audience that "it is
not possible to say that they [the Kent
State students] died in vain. They
were part of a movement of protest
that finally mobilized the country
against the horrors we continued to
inflict upon Southeast Asia."
'Spirit Of Bigotry'
In the wake of the public reaction
that followed the killings, Stone
accused Nixon of "calling up the spirit
of bigotry," and of "trying to
intimidate dissent and consciousness."
In so doing Stone concluded, "the
government was taking a move deeply
adverse to our national interest. The
government was choking off that
movement that prevents this country
from becoming a moral desert."
Stone stated that Nixon had
characterized the protesting college
youths as "campus bums, thugs and
hoodlums who afflict every society."
"But we know a lot more about Mr.
Nixon and thugs and hoodlums now,"
cracked Stone, alluding to the
Watergate scandal. "We know how
many campus bums he hired to
sabotage the Democratic campaign,
and we know of that enormous
conspiracy on the part of the Nixon
administration to obstruct justice."
Scranton Report
Stone gave the details of the
Scranton Report, a presidential
commission study on the Kent State
and Jackson State killings. "One
reason why police feel free to fire on
black students," stated the report, "is

that they feel sure that they will not
be called to account."
"The Scranton Commission
appealed to Nixon," asserted Stone,
"and told him that every single man in
the Jackson City Police force lied to
the FBI. They said they had never
fired a shot. Yet the FBI found in one
building alone over 400 bullet marks."
Stone claimed that the policemen
were thus subject to arrest under the
Federal Claims Statute that makes it a
crime to make false statements to
government agents, a crime punishable
by up to ten years in prison and a
$10,000 fine.
Prosecution Urged
"Every member of the force should
have been prosecuted for violation of
that law," said Stone. "But in spite o f
these overt violations of federal law.
Attorney General [John] Mitchell and
President Nixon turned their backs on
the law."
Stone similarly depicted the Kent
State killing investigation. He quoted a
speech made by former Sen. Stephen
M. Young (D-Ohio) that asserted that
the FBI had found evidence of a
conspiracy on the part of National
Guardsmen who prefabricated a story
that said they had fired after an attack
on them by students."
"But that FBI report was hushed
up," stated Stone. "It was quite clear
that Nixon and Agnew wanted
students treated just that way and
that's something that ought not to be
forgotten."

"What we need now is a very great
effort," said Stone. "We are going to
have to bring back a generation of
youngsters from alienation, for a man
who cares is worth 100 men who don't
care. We must raise the general level of
concern, and create a mood of
generosity.

that they feel sure that they will not
be called to account."
"The Scranton Commission
appealed to Nixon," asserted Stone,
"and told him that every single man in
the Jackson City Police force lied to
the FBI. They said they had never
fired a shot. Yet the FBI found in one
building alone over 400 bullet marks."
Stone claimed that the policemen
were thus subject to arrest under the
Federal Claims Statute that makes it a
crime to make false statements to
government agents, a crime punishable
by up to ten years in prison and a
$10,000 fine.
Prosecution Urged
"Every member of the force should
have been prosecuted for violation of
that law," said Stone. "But in spite o f
these overt violations of federal law.
Attorney General [John] Mitchell and
President Nixon turned their backs on
the law."
Stone similarly depicted the Kent
State killing investigation. He quoted a
speech made by former Sen. Stephen
M. Young (D-Ohio) that asserted that
the FBI had found evidence of a
conspiracy on the part of National
Guardsmen who prefabricated a story
that said they had fired after an attack
on them by students."
"But that FBI report was hushed
up," stated Stone. "It was quite clear
that Nixon and Agnew wanted
students treated just that way and
that's something that ought not to be
forgotten."

"What we need now is a very great
effort," said Stone. "We are going to
have to bring back a generation of
youngsters from alienation, for a man
who cares is worth 100 men who don't
care. We must raise the general level of
concern, and create a mood of
generosity.
"I'm sorry that the Kent State
killings seem to have frightened a lot
of American students," asserted I.F.
Stone, columnist for the "New York
Review of Books."
Stone addressed a crowd of about
300 people in Memorial Church last
Friday at a memorial service for the
students killed at Kent State three
years ago.
"The shootings," maintained Stone,
"have had a bad psychological effect.
They scared a lot of nice white
middle-class college kids, and
frightened a lot of dissenters into
health foods, mysticism and the
Upanishads, and walking around
barefoot."
"It's a wonderful country," stated
Stone, "where a Republican judge,"
and "a rather conservative southern
senator work to bring out the truth
about Watergate. But it won't stay
that way unless enough kids kick up a
rumpus, and by God you'd better kick
up a rumpus now when it's easy. The
time is coming when it may be very
hard," he cautioned.
Stone told his audience that "it is
not possible to say that they [the Kent
State students] died in vain. They
were part of a movement of protest
that finally mobilized the country
against the horrors we continued to
inflict upon Southeast Asia."
'Spirit Of Bigotry'
In the wake of the public reaction
that followed the killings, Stone
accused Nixon of "calling up the spirit
of bigotry," and of "trying to
intimidate dissent and consciousness."
In so doing Stone concluded, "the
government was taking a move deeply
adverse to our national interest. The
government was choking off that
movement that prevents this country
from becoming a moral desert."
Stone stated that Nixon had
characterized the protesting college
youths as "campus bums, thugs and
hoodlums who afflict every society."
"But we know a lot more about Mr.
Nixon and thugs and hoodlums now,"
cracked Stone, alluding to the
Watergate scandal. "We know how
many campus bums he hired to
sabotage the Democratic campaign,
and we know of that enormous
conspiracy on the part of the Nixon
administration to obstruct justice."
