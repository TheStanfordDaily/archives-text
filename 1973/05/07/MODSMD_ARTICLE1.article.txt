# Stone Tells Impact Of Kent State

### JAMES LOBSENZ 
"I'm sorry that the Kent State
killings seem to have frightened a lot
of American students," asserted I.F.
Stone, columnist for the "New York
Review of Books."
Stone addressed a crowd of about
300 people in Memorial Church last
Friday at a memorial service for the
students killed at Kent State three
years ago.
"The shootings," maintained Stone,
"have had a bad psychological effect.
They scared a lot of nice white
middle-class college kids, and
frightened a lot of dissenters into
health foods, mysticism and the
Upanishads, and walking around
barefoot."
"It's a wonderful country," stated
Stone, "where a Republican judge,"
and "a rather conservative southern
senator work to bring out the truth
about Watergate. But it won't stay
that way unless enough kids kick up a
rumpus, and by God you'd better kick
up a rumpus now when it's easy. The
time is coming when it may be very
hard," he cautioned.
Stone told his audience that "it is
not possible to say that they [the Kent
State students] died in vain. They
were part of a movement of protest
that finally mobilized the country
against the horrors we continued to
inflict upon Southeast Asia."
'Spirit Of Bigotry'
In the wake of the public reaction
that followed the killings, Stone
accused Nixon of "calling up the spirit
of bigotry," and of "trying to
intimidate dissent and consciousness."
In so doing Stone concluded, "the
government was taking a move deeply
adverse to our national interest. The
government was choking off that
movement that prevents this country
from becoming a moral desert."
Stone stated that Nixon had
characterized the protesting college
youths as "campus bums, thugs and
hoodlums who afflict every society."
"But we know a lot more about Mr.
Nixon and thugs and hoodlums now,"
cracked Stone, alluding to the
Watergate scandal. "We know how
many campus bums he hired to
sabotage the Democratic campaign,
and we know of that enormous
conspiracy on the part of the Nixon
administration to obstruct justice."
Scranton Report
Stone gave the details of the
Scranton Report, a presidential
commission study on the Kent State
and Jackson State killings. "One
reason why police feel free to fire on
black students," stated the report, "is
