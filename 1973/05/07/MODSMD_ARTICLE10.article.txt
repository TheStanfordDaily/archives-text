# Disclose Contributions
## Watergate 
### 
Paul N. McClotkey, Jr.

This past week, I have joined in
asking four things: (1) a full
disclosure by the President of his
own knowledge and involvement
in the political sabotage
operations of the 1972 campaign.
(2) a full disclosure of the
campaign contributions for that
campaign, (3) a FBI and Justice
Department inquiry into the
extent of the President's personal
knowledge and activities of his
aides' admitted cover-up of
criminal activity, and (4) the
appointment of a special
prosecutor in the matters arising
out of the Watergate and sabotage
operations and their financing.
The Justice Department has
thus far failed to prosecute a
single instance of criminal
violation of the campaign
contribution laws referred to
Justice by the Government
Accounting Office.
Likewise it appears that neither
the Justice Department nor the
FBI has had much interest in
discovering to what extent the
President himself is involved. As
ex-Secretary of Defense Laird
stated the other day, he "would
rather not learn" if the President
was guilty of criminal conduct.
I disagree.
Complete Text
In last Monday's Washington
Post, there appeared what was
apparently the complete text of
an FBI report on the interview of
ex-Presidential Counselor John
Ehrlichman by an FBI agent on
April 27, 1973. It was read into
the court record by Judge W. Matt
Byrne who is presiding over the
Ellsberg trial.

The FBI report discloses the
disquieting fact that the FBI agent
apparently did not ask Mr.
Ehrlichman the crucial question:
"When Mr. Ehrlichman learned
of the burglary of Daniel
Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office
by White House personnel, did
he advise the President of this
fact, and if £b, when?"
If we are to restore public
confidence in the integrity and
freedom of our law enforcement
agencies from political influence,
then the FBI and Justice
Department must be willing to ask
the hard questions as to the
personal knowledge and
involvement of the highest
officials of government, including
the President, in matters of
criminal conduct.
Impartial?
The question that is being
asked around the country is
whether or not the FBI and
Justice Department can, and will,
impartially inquire into the
conduct of the President himself.
If the FBI does not ask the hard
questions, then the doubts will
continue to grow that we are not
really a nation of laws rather than
of men when the Presidency is
involved. It also poses the
question: If the FBI and Justice
Department will not fully
investigate the conduct of the
President's high office, is not the
House of Representatives required
to do so as part of its specific
Constitutional responsibility with
respect to the Executive Branch?

in the political sabotage
operations of the 1972 campaign.
(2) a full disclosure of the
campaign contributions for that
campaign, (3) a FBI and Justice
Department inquiry into the
extent of the President's personal
knowledge and activities of his
aides' admitted cover-up of
criminal activity, and (4) the
appointment of a special
prosecutor in the matters arising
out of the Watergate and sabotage
operations and their financing.
The Justice Department has
thus far failed to prosecute a
single instance of criminal
violation of the campaign
contribution laws referred to
Justice by the Government
Accounting Office.
Likewise it appears that neither
the Justice Department nor the
FBI has had much interest in
discovering to what extent the
President himself is involved. As
ex-Secretary of Defense Laird
stated the other day, he "would
rather not learn" if the President
was guilty of criminal conduct.
I disagree.
Complete Text
In last Monday's Washington
Post, there appeared what was
apparently the complete text of
an FBI report on the interview of
ex-Presidential Counselor John
Ehrlichman by an FBI agent on
April 27, 1973. It was read into
the court record by Judge W. Matt
Byrne who is presiding over the
Ellsberg trial.

The FBI report discloses the
disquieting fact that the FBI agent
apparently did not ask Mr.
Ehrlichman the crucial question:
"When Mr. Ehrlichman learned
of the burglary of Daniel
Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office
by White House personnel, did
he advise the President of this
fact, and if £b, when?"
If we are to restore public
confidence in the integrity and
freedom of our law enforcement
agencies from political influence,
then the FBI and Justice
Department must be willing to ask
the hard questions as to the
personal knowledge and
involvement of the highest
officials of government, including
the President, in matters of
criminal conduct.
Impartial?
The question that is being
asked around the country is
whether or not the FBI and
Justice Department can, and will,
impartially inquire into the
conduct of the President himself.
If the FBI does not ask the hard
questions, then the doubts will
continue to grow that we are not
really a nation of laws rather than
of men when the Presidency is
involved. It also poses the
question: If the FBI and Justice
Department will not fully
investigate the conduct of the
President's high office, is not the
House of Representatives required
to do so as part of its specific
Constitutional responsibility with
respect to the Executive Branch?

Congressional District.)

This past week, I have joined in
asking four things: (1) a full
disclosure by the President of his
own knowledge and involvement
in the political sabotage
operations of the 1972 campaign.
(2) a full disclosure of the
campaign contributions for that
campaign, (3) a FBI and Justice
Department inquiry into the
extent of the President's personal
knowledge and activities of his
aides' admitted cover-up of
criminal activity, and (4) the
appointment of a special
