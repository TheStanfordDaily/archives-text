Regarding Kent State
Editor:
I'm writing this on May 4th,
the anniversary of the tragic
events at Kent State, and I am
amazed at how deeply affected I
am by the incident. I was not so
affected ever in the past as I am
this year. I guess being away from
my home in northeastern Ohio
brings the details more strongly
into memory. All week Kent has
been on my mnd. I have been
struggling to fight back tears,
particularly today. I'm not really
sure why.
Maybe it's a symbol of the
sixties that had such an impact on
my life. While I am in mourning
for the four, the hundreds of
wounded, the riots all throughout
the United States, it is more, I'm
sure. Maybe it's because I'm at
college for the first time, and riots
would directly affect me here. I
don't understand it, but I do feel
a very sincere sense of loss, of
tragedy, that I have never felt
before. Tonight I am going to hear
Mr. Stone speak on Kent. I hope I
can handle it. It's hard for me to
cry by myself, and it's harder to
cry with 1000 other students,
particularly Stanford students.
I'm extremely irritated by the
self-centered nature of the typical
Stanford student, and his petty
manifestations. Every day I walk
on White Plaza where bicycle
traffic hits its peak. There are
innumerable accidents between
bikes and pedestrians. There is no
courtesy expressed here. No one
looks out for his fellow man. It's
just "I've got to move, run, run,
run, hurry, hurry, hurry." The
competition, the "Me, me, me"
attitude is so fierce. "Sorry I can't
talk, I've got to study," "I'll eat
real fast so I can hit the books,"
"I'm late, I'm late, for a very
important date, no time to stay
and wait, wait, wait...."
Where are our priorities? Slow
donw, Relax, enjoy, care. Maybe I
mourn for the sincere caring of
the sixties, the togetherness, the
unity, the brotherhood. Maybe I
mourn for the students at Kent
and throughout the country who
cared so much for their fellow
men that they were willing to
express their care in active
participation and assembly. I
mourn for their deaths. Never
before, as in the last decade, had
so many people joined arms
together to fight off the inhuman
acts of Vietnam, Cambodia, and
others.
Earlier this year a student
pained a sign on the bookstore
saying, "Bomb Stanford, not
Hanoi." When taken literally, this
is absurd. But it is time for the
students at Stanford, Berkeley,
Columbia, Wisconsin, Kent,
Southern U, Jackson State to
renew their feelings about the
inhuman tragedies that are being
forced on our brothers
throughout the world. The beauty
of the sixties was that we didn't
have to bomb Stanford to
experience this feeling, Knowing
that our fellow man was being
bombed was enough to incite the
students of this country to get
together and protest these actions.
I'm not at all religious, but it's
time we looked more carefully at
the idea that all men are brothers,
that we ought to love our
neighbors as we do ourselves.

manifestations. Every day I walk
on White Plaza where bicycle
traffic hits its peak. There are
innumerable accidents between
bikes and pedestrians. There is no
courtesy expressed here. No one
looks out for his fellow man. It's
just "I've got to move, run, run,
run, hurry, hurry, hurry." The
competition, the "Me, me, me"
attitude is so fierce. "Sorry I can't
talk, I've got to study," "I'll eat
real fast so I can hit the books,"
"I'm late, I'm late, for a very
important date, no time to stay
and wait, wait, wait...."
Where are our priorities? Slow
donw, Relax, enjoy, care. Maybe I
mourn for the sincere caring of
the sixties, the togetherness, the
unity, the brotherhood. Maybe I
mourn for the students at Kent
and throughout the country who
cared so much for their fellow
men that they were willing to
express their care in active
participation and assembly. I
mourn for their deaths. Never
before, as in the last decade, had
so many people joined arms
together to fight off the inhuman
acts of Vietnam, Cambodia, and
others.
Earlier this year a student
pained a sign on the bookstore
saying, "Bomb Stanford, not
Hanoi." When taken literally, this
is absurd. But it is time for the
students at Stanford, Berkeley,
Columbia, Wisconsin, Kent,
Southern U, Jackson State to
renew their feelings about the
inhuman tragedies that are being
forced on our brothers
throughout the world. The beauty
of the sixties was that we didn't
have to bomb Stanford to
experience this feeling, Knowing
that our fellow man was being
bombed was enough to incite the
students of this country to get
together and protest these actions.
I'm not at all religious, but it's
time we looked more carefully at
the idea that all men are brothers,
that we ought to love our
neighbors as we do ourselves.

Regarding Kent State
Editor:
I'm writing this on May 4th,
the anniversary of the tragic
events at Kent State, and I am
amazed at how deeply affected I
am by the incident. I was not so
affected ever in the past as I am
this year. I guess being away from
my home in northeastern Ohio
brings the details more strongly
into memory. All week Kent has
been on my mnd. I have been
struggling to fight back tears,
particularly today. I'm not really
sure why.
Maybe it's a symbol of the
sixties that had such an impact on
my life. While I am in mourning
for the four, the hundreds of
wounded, the riots all throughout
the United States, it is more, I'm
sure. Maybe it's because I'm at
college for the first time, and riots
would directly affect me here. I
don't understand it, but I do feel
a very sincere sense of loss, of
tragedy, that I have never felt
before. Tonight I am going to hear
Mr. Stone speak on Kent. I hope I
can handle it. It's hard for me to
cry by myself, and it's harder to
cry with 1000 other students,
particularly Stanford students.
I'm extremely irritated by the
self-centered nature of the typical
Stanford student, and his petty
manifestations. Every day I walk
on White Plaza where bicycle
traffic hits its peak. There are

bikes and pedestrians. There is no
