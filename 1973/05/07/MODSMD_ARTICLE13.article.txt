WASHINGTON â€” To many local
officials, President Nixon's order
closing the Office of Economic
Opportunity gives them command
of a reduced war on poverty they
doubt they can win.
A federal judge has blocked
Nixon's order, but without more
money from Congress the OEO
likely will be out of business by
summer.
The officials believe that the
President's latest budget, which
includes no money for OEO, will
leave them without resources to
pick up many of the antipoverty
agency's local programs.
The administration says it isn't
so, that the money will be
available to localities through
revenue sharing.
But Richard Beliles, federal
programs coordinator for
Louisville, Ky., doubts he'll get
the money he needs for some
current antipoverty projects. "All
you're given is authority to make
very unpopular decisions," he
said.
Must Find Funds
Beliles and hundreds of other
local officials nationwide
probably must find funds to pay
for such OEO programs as youth
activities, eye-and-ear
examinations for school children
and special assistance to elderly
shut-ins, or drop them.
And they see less money
coming for manpower training
and other antipoverty programs
based in federal agencies other
than OEO.
The officials are skeptical of
White House assurances that cities
will get the same level of federal
support for social programs as
they received since 1964 when

Lyndon Johnson called for a
national commitment to eliminate
poverty.
Determined Administration
To them, the order closing
OEO is but one sign of the Nixon
administration's determination to
mask cuts in federal social
programs within shifts to the
block grants of revenue sharing.
Mayor Roman Gribbs of
Detroit, President of the National
League of Cities, wrote the
President that the league's analysis
of the federal budget showed a
drop in federal appropriations for
cities next year of $4.1 billion.
Kenneth Cole, head of the
White House Domestic Council,
responded that by his calculations
there is a net increase of $1.2
billion.
Aid To Cities
Those figures include all
federal aid to cities, not just funds
for the poor.
But, as a report from the U.S.
Conference of Mayors said, "Deep
cuts in the budget will affect vital
city programs. These cuts will be
felt first and sharpest by minority
groups and the poor."
Billions of dollars in aid to the
poor still will flow from
Washington.
For example, in the fiscal year
that ended last June 30, total
federal aid to the poor was $28.3
billion. OEO's budget the same
year was just over $1 billion.
Such direct cash payments as
Social Security accounted for
$12.2 billion. The remaining
$16.1 billion paid for a variety of
services and commodities such as
health care, job training,
education programs, housing and
food.
Still, if OEO closes down, a lot
of the jobs it gave poor people are
likely to be lost. No one yet
knows how many OEO programs
could depend on whether local
governments can absorb their
cost.
In the case of Community
Action Agencies, local
governments would have to pick

up the entire cost because the
agencies program is the one effort
for which all federal support
would die with OEO.
The agencies and projects they
fund employ about 185,000
persons, of whom about 95,000
were poor before they got OEO
jobs. Their average annual salary is
$5,182.
Summer Youth Program
OEO summer youth program
provided jobs for 740,222
teenagers during their 1972 school
vacation at a cost of $318 million.
The Public Employment Program
which expires June 30 employs
137,823 adults in federally
supported municipal jobs.
The future of the summer
youth program was in doubt until
late March when the President
announced that $424 million
would be available for it.
But mayors noted that $300
million of that total was being
diverted from the PEP program.
'Unhappy Choice'
John Gunther, executive
director of the U.S. Conference of
Mayors, said that the President's
action "forces the nation's mayors
to make the unhappy choice of
laying off a father in the PEP
program in order to hire his son in
the summer program."
Manpower training programs,
already based in the Labor
Department, received $1.5 billion
during the fiscal year that ends
June 30. For the next year, under
revenue sharing, the budget
request is $1.3 billion.
One of the most popular
antipoverty programs, Head Start,
geared to preschool children, is
based in the Department of
Health, Education, and Welfare
and is slated for a budget increase
in the next fiscal year. Head Start
received $393.4 million for the
year ending June 30. Next year,
its budget goes to $407.4 million.
Model Cities
Lyndon Johnson's last major
offensive in the war on poverty,
the billion-dollar Model Cities
program launched in 1967, is one
of the programs being absorbed

into Nixon's proposed Better
Communities Act.
Nixon said the Better
Communities Act would send
cities $2.3 billion in block grants
and "assure that no city receives
less money for community
development than it has
received."
Some officials aren't so sure.
For example, Beliles said he
believes much of the money
promised in the Better
Communities Act will be funds
appropriated by Congress for
existing programs, but impounded
by the President.
"They're giving us things that
we already received," he said.
In Newark, the Model Cities
agency received a telegram from
Washington saying funds the local
people thought would be available
for other purposes would have to
be used for whatever Model Cities
programs the city wanted to
continue.
And until the President's
proposal for a Better
Communities Act becomes law,
Model Cities agencies across the
nation are operating on an average
at one-third the budget levels they
received last year.
Defeats
There are few local officials or
antipoverty workers who
wouldn't agree with the President
that many of the battles of the

war on poverty ended in crushing
defeat.
But like hawks in other wars,
many feel they were just
beginning to see signs of victory
when the administration decided
to change the nature of its
commitment.
And ironically, they credit the
Nixon administration with
pushing for better planning and
tighter accounting that has made
many Community Action
Agencies, in their eyes, more
effective suppliers of services to
the poor.
Others are wondering whether
the closing of OEO means that
local social services are returning
to the hands of the agencies that
handled them before OEO.
