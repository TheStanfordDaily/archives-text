# Six English Profs Plan Curriculum For Beginning Literature Students
## 
### 
Six distinguished members of the English
Department will start next fall to teach a group of
courses designed specifically for beginning literature
students.
Associated with each of these courses will be new
writing courses, giving freshmen another option in
fulfilling their writing requirement.
Lan P. Watt, who holds the endowed Jackson Eli
Reynolds professorship in humanities, and J. Martin
Evans, a specialist in John Milton and the
Renaissance, will teach a course on "Studies in
English Literature." Watt will do so fall quarter, and
Evans in winter quarter.
William Chace, a University fellow, Arturo Islas,
N. Scott Momaday, a Pulitzer prize-winning
novelist, and A 1 Young, a novelist and poet and who
has been a teacher in the creative writing program,
will offer courses on various aspects of American
literature.
Chace's fall quarter "Studies in American
Literature," will involve intensive study of such
writers as Herman Melville, William Faulkner, and
Richard Wright.
Momaday's course, offered winter quarter, will

treat American Indian mythology, legend, and lore.
In spring quarter, Young will investigate forms of
Afro-American literature, and the following year
Islas will teach a course on chicano literature.
"The department is putting a high priority on
these courses," says Bliss Carnochan, chairman of
the English Department. "We've been moving
toward more and more choices for students who
must satisfy the writing requirement.
"This will allow the freshman who wants to take
a beginning literature course to do so, while also
taking a course that will allow the student to write
about what he is reading."
Although these courses are not offered in a
required sequence, Carnochan also points out that a
student can put together a broad survey of English
and American literature by combining two more of
these introductory courses.
"There's a great diversity of offerings in the
department which is all to the good," says
Carnochan. "But we hope that offering these
courses in this way will provide a modicum of order
for the beginning student."
