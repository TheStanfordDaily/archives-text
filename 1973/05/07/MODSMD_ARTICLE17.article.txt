# Opinions Vary On Merits Of MCAT Preparatory Course
## 
### BOB SIEGEL 
The Medical College Admission
Test (MCAT) is given every spring
and fall for students seeking
admission to medical school. This
year the test is being administered
by the American College Testing
Program (ACT) under the
direction of the Association of
American Medical Colleges.
According to the ACT
brochure accompanying
registration materials, the MCAT
. . is designed to measure
general academic ability, general
information, and scientific
ability."
In recent years, the pressure
for doing well on the MCAT has
grown more intense as the ratio of
applications to available positions
continues to rise. (The ratio at
Stanford Medical School is 48.5
for this fall's incoming class.) Test
scores are a major factor on which
medical schools base their
decisions since they are the only
data common to all applicants.
The ACT brochure makes the
following statement in boldface
printing regarding preparation for
the MCAT: "The Association of
American Medical Colleges does
not sponsor nor recommend to
prospective examinees any of the
commercially available devices
advertised as preparatory for the
MCAT."
MCAT Course
The Stanley H. Kaplan
Educational Center in San Jose
operates the only MCAT
preparatory course in the Bay
Area. It was first offered last
spring for the May test.
Mike Bluth, director of the
center, explained the format was
"basically the same as the Law
School Admission Test (LSAT)
course." Students attend the class
once a week for six weeks, and
each session lasts about four
hours. Tuition is $175 plus a
refundable $25 deposit for
homework materials.
Two classes of about 12 people
each took the course in
preparation for last Saturday's
MCAT. Both were taught by a
Medical School student who asked
to remain unidentified.
Bluth explained that medical
school students serve as
instructors because "they haven't

been away from tests for too
i long."
i Instructional Tapes
I Instructors usually prepare for
s classes by listening to tapes which
i review materials to be covered in
I the next class. Bluth pointed out
i that people taking the course also
112 have access to the tapes.
Students are supposed to study
-> one section of the homework
, before each session. "The
' homework packets," said the
i director, "provide a review of all
1 areas with emphasis on science
, and math." He added that they
are intended to "bring it all
back."
The class begins each meeting
jj by taking a practice MCAT. In the
remaining time, the instructor
' explained "I go over all the
answers and show why
' some ... aren't right and why
" others are." Students also have an
' opportunity to ask questions
r concerning homework materials
during this discussion period.
She added "I think it's valuable
? for people to get used to taking a
? test under time pressure with
r feedback on their progress."
112 Four Sections
> In contrast to the LSAT
> (which measures aptitude), the
■ MCAT is oriented more toward
3 measuring achievement in four
? independently-scored sections.
These include verbal, general
knowledge, math and science,
i with the latter two considered
s most important by admissions
r committees.
t Students can significantly raise
t their scores by studying
appropriate subject materials.
Preparatory courses can present
an organized, systematic review
for their classes. In addition they
. can convey a familiarity with the
' test and suggest general
j exam-taking techniques.
Paul Harmatz is a senior who
took the Kaplan course last April
(for the May test) and is bound
for Dartmouth Medical School in
the fall. He said "the bulk of the
; course consisted of study
i materials which he (Kaplan)
> organized. They covered all
i subjects needed for the MCAT."
1 Harmatz added that "reviewing
on your own you just don't know
1 where to begin studying. A formal
> course .. . will assign a certain
t number of pages to cover every

week. If you did the assignments
through the duration of the
course you would have touched
all the subjects covered on the
MCAT."
'Worthless'
Mike McQuillan is the Health
Sciences Counselor at the
University of California at
Riverside. After several years of
researching various MCAT
preparation procedures, he has
concluded "both the (MCAT
review) booklets and cram courses
are worthless ...."
Opinion of the course among a
sampling of Stanford pre-med
advisors ranged from negative to
non-committal to a qualified
positive.
Dr. Henry H. Jones is an
associate professor of radiology
who has had over 500 advisees in
the last 10 years. Jones said "we
take a dim view of this sort of
thing ... Our attitude in general
has been that a student should be
able to do as well on his own as he
could having taken a course."
Jones suggests students begin
reviewing several months in
advance of the MCAT by
"studying old texts notes" in
math and science, studying
subject outline books (such as
Barnes and Noble) and going over
"Vised" vocabulary cards. In
addition he recommends students
purchase one of the MCAT review
books because "such publications
are useful for learning the rules of
the game."
No Recommendations
Advisor Marvin A. Karasek
replied when asked about the
course "it's very expensive. I
don't know of any documentation
that this course is any more
effective than other forms of
studying for the MCAT... I
don't make recommendations one
way or the other."
Associate Anatomy Professor
Donald L. Stillwell has long been
a cornerstone of Stanford pre-med
advising. For each of his advisees,
he evaluates grades and progress in
courses, then writes a
"prescription for reviewing to
prepare for the MCAT."
Stillwell does not recommend
the preparation course except
"for people who have made a late
choice (to try for medical
school)." He explained that
"Kaplan can substitute
superficially for uncompleted
courses or courses not taken."
Keith Mayo is a senior who
went pre-med at the beginning of
this school year and took the
MCAT this past weekend. He
described why he signed up for
the Kaplan course:
"This is my first year of
science. So far I've had two and a
half quarters of biology and
chemistry and no physics ... For
me it's not a review course."
Mayo added that "Dr. Stillwell
mentioned it (the course) at a
meeting and said if you're
desperate, it's okay." He added
that as a result of taking the
course "I hopefully will be
familiar with some of the stuff on
which I'd otherwise draw a
blank... if it were strictly a
review course... it would be
great."
Lack Of Feedback
One problem in evaluating the
course is the lack of student
feedback, since only two classes
are able to look back at the course

and their MCAT scores. Another
is the difficulty in determining the
benefit derived from any
preparation.
As far as the course is
concerned, the point in question
seems not to be whether it is
worthwhile, but rather whether it
warrants the expenditure of $175.
Mayo said "I think it's fairly
expensive, but I'm satisfied with
it."
Director Bluth stated "For one
person it can do miracles and for
others it does nothing.. .
(however) almost to a man,
students have reported that the
course was the 'best thing that
could have happened in preparing
for the examination.' "
'Do As Well On His Own'
The course's present instructor
believes that a student could
accomplish as much outside the
course in reviewing for the verbal
and general knowledge sections.
She added "I think the course is
valuable in science and
math ... (though) if a person
really had expert advice, he could
probably do as well on his own."
Peter L. Pansing, assistant
director of the Academic
Information Center and
coordinator of pre-professional
advising, stated "they (the
courses) are not endorsed by
anybody ... It's a ridiculous
amount for a program which can
be taken care of on your own."
Pansing added that "one
student told me 'It's not worth
the expense.' He thought he
would be getting a lot more."
However, Harmatz declared
"It's certainly worth the $175 just
for the peace of mind that you've
studied all the material in an
organized way" when going into
the MCAT.

Associate Anatomy Professor
Donald L. Stillwell has long been
a cornerstone of Stanford pre-med
advising. For each of his advisees,
he evaluates grades and progress in
courses, then writes a
"prescription for reviewing to
prepare for the MCAT."
Stillwell does not recommend
the preparation course except
"for people who have made a late
choice (to try for medical
school)." He explained that
"Kaplan can substitute
superficially for uncompleted
courses or courses not taken."
Keith Mayo is a senior who
went pre-med at the beginning of
this school year and took the
MCAT this past weekend. He
described why he signed up for
the Kaplan course:
"This is my first year of
science. So far I've had two and a
half quarters of biology and
chemistry and no physics ... For
me it's not a review course."
Mayo added that "Dr. Stillwell
mentioned it (the course) at a

desperate, it's okay." He added
that as a result of taking the
course "I hopefully will be
familiar with some of the stuff on
which I'd otherwise draw a
blank... if it were strictly a
review course... it would be
great."
Lack Of Feedback
One problem in evaluating the
course is the lack of student
feedback, since only two classes
are able to look back at the course

and their MCAT scores. Another
is the difficulty in determining the
benefit derived from any
preparation.
As far as the course is
concerned, the point in question
seems not to be whether it is
worthwhile, but rather whether it
warrants the expenditure of $175.
Mayo said "I think it's fairly
expensive, but I'm satisfied with
it."
Director Bluth stated "For one
person it can do miracles and for
others it does nothing.. .
(however) almost to a man,
students have reported that the
course was the 'best thing that
could have happened in preparing
for the examination.' "
'Do As Well On His Own'
The course's present instructor
believes that a student could
accomplish as much outside the
course in reviewing for the verbal
and general knowledge sections.
She added "I think the course is
valuable in science and
math ... (though) if a person
really had expert advice, he could
probably do as well on his own."
Peter L. Pansing, assistant
director of the Academic
Information Center and
coordinator of pre-professional
advising, stated "they (the
courses) are not endorsed by
anybody ... It's a ridiculous
amount for a program which can
be taken care of on your own."
Pansing added that "one
student told me 'It's not worth
the expense.' He thought he
would be getting a lot more."
However, Harmatz declared
"It's certainly worth the $175 just
for the peace of mind that you've
studied all the material in an
organized way" when going into
the MCAT.

MED SCHOOL — The competition among applicants for medical schools of the caliber of Stanford's has
increased the popularity of preparatory courses for the Medical College Admission test (MCAT). Critics
claim that the courses are "worthless."
The Medical College Admission
Test (MCAT) is given every spring
and fall for students seeking
admission to medical school. This
year the test is being administered
by the American College Testing
Program (ACT) under the
direction of the Association of
American Medical Colleges.
According to the ACT
brochure accompanying
registration materials, the MCAT
. . is designed to measure
general academic ability, general
information, and scientific
ability."
In recent years, the pressure
for doing well on the MCAT has
grown more intense as the ratio of
applications to available positions
continues to rise. (The ratio at
Stanford Medical School is 48.5
for this fall's incoming class.) Test
scores are a major factor on which
medical schools base their
decisions since they are the only
data common to all applicants.
The ACT brochure makes the
following statement in boldface
printing regarding preparation for
the MCAT: "The Association of
American Medical Colleges does
not sponsor nor recommend to
prospective examinees any of the
commercially available devices
advertised as preparatory for the
MCAT."
MCAT Course
The Stanley H. Kaplan
Educational Center in San Jose
operates the only MCAT
preparatory course in the Bay
Area. It was first offered last
spring for the May test.
Mike Bluth, director of the
center, explained the format was
"basically the same as the Law
School Admission Test (LSAT)
course." Students attend the class
once a week for six weeks, and
each session lasts about four
hours. Tuition is $175 plus a
refundable $25 deposit for
homework materials.
Two classes of about 12 people
each took the course in
preparation for last Saturday's
MCAT. Both were taught by a
Medical School student who asked
to remain unidentified.
Bluth explained that medical
school students serve as
instructors because "they haven't

been away from tests for too
i long."
i Instructional Tapes
I Instructors usually prepare for
s classes by listening to tapes which
i review materials to be covered in
I the next class. Bluth pointed out
i that people taking the course also
112 have access to the tapes.
Students are supposed to study
-> one section of the homework
, before each session. "The
' homework packets," said the
i director, "provide a review of all
1 areas with emphasis on science
, and math." He added that they
are intended to "bring it all
back."
The class begins each meeting
jj by taking a practice MCAT. In the
remaining time, the instructor
' explained "I go over all the
answers and show why
' some ... aren't right and why
" others are." Students also have an
' opportunity to ask questions
r concerning homework materials
during this discussion period.
She added "I think it's valuable
? for people to get used to taking a
? test under time pressure with
r feedback on their progress."
112 Four Sections
> In contrast to the LSAT
> (which measures aptitude), the
■ MCAT is oriented more toward
3 measuring achievement in four
? independently-scored sections.
These include verbal, general
knowledge, math and science,
i with the latter two considered
s most important by admissions
r committees.
t Students can significantly raise
t their scores by studying
appropriate subject materials.
Preparatory courses can present
an organized, systematic review
for their classes. In addition they
. can convey a familiarity with the
' test and suggest general
j exam-taking techniques.
Paul Harmatz is a senior who
took the Kaplan course last April
(for the May test) and is bound
for Dartmouth Medical School in
the fall. He said "the bulk of the
; course consisted of study
i materials which he (Kaplan)
> organized. They covered all
i subjects needed for the MCAT."
1 Harmatz added that "reviewing
on your own you just don't know
1 where to begin studying. A formal
> course .. . will assign a certain
t number of pages to cover every

week. If you did the assignments
through the duration of the
course you would have touched
all the subjects covered on the
MCAT."
'Worthless'
Mike McQuillan is the Health
Sciences Counselor at the
University of California at
Riverside. After several years of
researching various MCAT
preparation procedures, he has
concluded "both the (MCAT
review) booklets and cram courses
are worthless ...."
Opinion of the course among a
sampling of Stanford pre-med
advisors ranged from negative to
non-committal to a qualified
positive.
Dr. Henry H. Jones is an
associate professor of radiology
who has had over 500 advisees in
the last 10 years. Jones said "we
take a dim view of this sort of
thing ... Our attitude in general
has been that a student should be
able to do as well on his own as he
could having taken a course."
Jones suggests students begin
reviewing several months in
advance of the MCAT by
"studying old texts notes" in
math and science, studying
subject outline books (such as
Barnes and Noble) and going over
"Vised" vocabulary cards. In
addition he recommends students
purchase one of the MCAT review
books because "such publications
are useful for learning the rules of
the game."

'Worthless'
Mike McQuillan is the Health

researching various MCAT
preparation procedures, he has
concluded "both the (MCAT

Opinion of the course among a
sampling of Stanford pre-med
advisors ranged from negative to
non-committal to a qualified

Dr. Henry H. Jones is an

the last 10 years. Jones said "we
take a dim view of this sort of

has been that a student should be
able to do as well on his own as he
could having taken a course."
Jones suggests students begin
reviewing several months in
advance of the MCAT by
"studying old texts notes" in
math and science, studying
subject outline books (such as
Barnes and Noble) and going over
"Vised" vocabulary cards. In
addition he recommends students
purchase one of the MCAT review
books because "such publications
are useful for learning the rules of

Associate Anatomy Professor
Donald L. Stillwell has long been
a cornerstone of Stanford pre-med
advising. For each of his advisees,
he evaluates grades and progress in
courses, then writes a
"prescription for reviewing to
prepare for the MCAT."
Stillwell does not recommend
the preparation course except
"for people who have made a late
choice (to try for medical
school)." He explained that
"Kaplan can substitute
superficially for uncompleted
courses or courses not taken."
Keith Mayo is a senior who
went pre-med at the beginning of
this school year and took the
MCAT this past weekend. He
described why he signed up for
the Kaplan course:
"This is my first year of
science. So far I've had two and a
half quarters of biology and
chemistry and no physics ... For
me it's not a review course."
Mayo added that "Dr. Stillwell
mentioned it (the course) at a
meeting and said if you're
desperate, it's okay." He added
that as a result of taking the
course "I hopefully will be
familiar with some of the stuff on
which I'd otherwise draw a
blank... if it were strictly a
review course... it would be
great."
Lack Of Feedback
One problem in evaluating the
course is the lack of student
feedback, since only two classes
are able to look back at the course

and their MCAT scores. Another
is the difficulty in determining the
benefit derived from any
preparation.
As far as the course is
concerned, the point in question
seems not to be whether it is
worthwhile, but rather whether it
warrants the expenditure of $175.
Mayo said "I think it's fairly
expensive, but I'm satisfied with
it."
Director Bluth stated "For one
person it can do miracles and for
others it does nothing.. .
(however) almost to a man,
students have reported that the
course was the 'best thing that
could have happened in preparing
for the examination.' "
'Do As Well On His Own'
The course's present instructor
believes that a student could
accomplish as much outside the
course in reviewing for the verbal
and general knowledge sections.
She added "I think the course is
valuable in science and
math ... (though) if a person
really had expert advice, he could
probably do as well on his own."
Peter L. Pansing, assistant
director of the Academic
Information Center and
coordinator of pre-professional
advising, stated "they (the
courses) are not endorsed by
anybody ... It's a ridiculous
amount for a program which can
be taken care of on your own."
Pansing added that "one
student told me 'It's not worth
the expense.' He thought he
would be getting a lot more."
However, Harmatz declared
"It's certainly worth the $175 just
for the peace of mind that you've
studied all the material in an
organized way" when going into
the MCAT.

MED SCHOOL — The competition among applicants for medical schools of the caliber of Stanford's has
increased the popularity of preparatory courses for the Medical College Admission test (MCAT). Critics
claim that the courses are "worthless."
The Medical College Admission
Test (MCAT) is given every spring

applications to available positions
continues to rise. (The ratio at
Stanford Medical School is 48.5
for this fall's incoming class.) Test
scores are a major factor on which
medical schools base their

Lack Of Feedback
One problem in evaluating the
course is the lack of student
feedback, since only two classes
are able to look back at the course

and their MCAT scores. Another
is the difficulty in determining the
benefit derived from any
preparation.
As far as the course is
concerned, the point in question
seems not to be whether it is
worthwhile, but rather whether it
warrants the expenditure of $175.
Mayo said "I think it's fairly
expensive, but I'm satisfied with
it."
Director Bluth stated "For one
person it can do miracles and for
others it does nothing.. .
(however) almost to a man,
students have reported that the
course was the 'best thing that
could have happened in preparing
for the examination.' "
'Do As Well On His Own'
The course's present instructor
believes that a student could
accomplish as much outside the
course in reviewing for the verbal
and general knowledge sections.
She added "I think the course is
valuable in science and
math ... (though) if a person
really had expert advice, he could
probably do as well on his own."
Peter L. Pansing, assistant
director of the Academic
Information Center and
coordinator of pre-professional
advising, stated "they (the
courses) are not endorsed by
anybody ... It's a ridiculous
amount for a program which can
be taken care of on your own."
Pansing added that "one
student told me 'It's not worth
the expense.' He thought he
would be getting a lot more."
However, Harmatz declared
"It's certainly worth the $175 just
for the peace of mind that you've
studied all the material in an
organized way" when going into
the MCAT.

MED SCHOOL — The competition among applicants for medical schools of the caliber of Stanford's has
increased the popularity of preparatory courses for the Medical College Admission test (MCAT). Critics
claim that the courses are "worthless."
The Medical College Admission
Test (MCAT) is given every spring
and fall for students seeking
admission to medical school. This
year the test is being administered
by the American College Testing
Program (ACT) under the
direction of the Association of
American Medical Colleges.
According to the ACT
brochure accompanying
registration materials, the MCAT
. . is designed to measure
general academic ability, general
information, and scientific
ability."
In recent years, the pressure
for doing well on the MCAT has
grown more intense as the ratio of
applications to available positions
continues to rise. (The ratio at
Stanford Medical School is 48.5
for this fall's incoming class.) Test
scores are a major factor on which
medical schools base their
decisions since they are the only
data common to all applicants.
The ACT brochure makes the
following statement in boldface
printing regarding preparation for
the MCAT: "The Association of
American Medical Colleges does
not sponsor nor recommend to
prospective examinees any of the
commercially available devices
advertised as preparatory for the
MCAT."
MCAT Course
The Stanley H. Kaplan
Educational Center in San Jose
operates the only MCAT
preparatory course in the Bay
Area. It was first offered last
spring for the May test.
Mike Bluth, director of the
center, explained the format was
"basically the same as the Law
School Admission Test (LSAT)
course." Students attend the class
once a week for six weeks, and
each session lasts about four
hours. Tuition is $175 plus a
refundable $25 deposit for
homework materials.
Two classes of about 12 people
each took the course in
preparation for last Saturday's
MCAT. Both were taught by a
Medical School student who asked
to remain unidentified.
Bluth explained that medical
school students serve as
instructors because "they haven't

been away from tests for too
i long."
i Instructional Tapes
I Instructors usually prepare for
s classes by listening to tapes which
i review materials to be covered in
I the next class. Bluth pointed out
i that people taking the course also
112 have access to the tapes.
Students are supposed to study
-> one section of the homework
, before each session. "The
' homework packets," said the
i director, "provide a review of all
1 areas with emphasis on science
, and math." He added that they
are intended to "bring it all
back."
The class begins each meeting
jj by taking a practice MCAT. In the
remaining time, the instructor
' explained "I go over all the
answers and show why
' some ... aren't right and why
" others are." Students also have an
' opportunity to ask questions
r concerning homework materials
during this discussion period.
She added "I think it's valuable
? for people to get used to taking a
? test under time pressure with
r feedback on their progress."
112 Four Sections
> In contrast to the LSAT
> (which measures aptitude), the
■ MCAT is oriented more toward
3 measuring achievement in four
? independently-scored sections.
These include verbal, general
knowledge, math and science,
i with the latter two considered
s most important by admissions
r committees.
t Students can significantly raise
t their scores by studying
appropriate subject materials.
Preparatory courses can present
an organized, systematic review
for their classes. In addition they
. can convey a familiarity with the
' test and suggest general
j exam-taking techniques.
Paul Harmatz is a senior who
took the Kaplan course last April
(for the May test) and is bound
for Dartmouth Medical School in
the fall. He said "the bulk of the
; course consisted of study
i materials which he (Kaplan)
> organized. They covered all
i subjects needed for the MCAT."
1 Harmatz added that "reviewing
on your own you just don't know
1 where to begin studying. A formal
> course .. . will assign a certain
t number of pages to cover every

week. If you did the assignments
through the duration of the
course you would have touched
all the subjects covered on the
MCAT."
'Worthless'
Mike McQuillan is the Health
Sciences Counselor at the
University of California at
Riverside. After several years of
researching various MCAT
preparation procedures, he has
concluded "both the (MCAT
review) booklets and cram courses
are worthless ...."
Opinion of the course among a
sampling of Stanford pre-med
advisors ranged from negative to
non-committal to a qualified
positive.
Dr. Henry H. Jones is an
associate professor of radiology
who has had over 500 advisees in
the last 10 years. Jones said "we
take a dim view of this sort of
thing ... Our attitude in general
has been that a student should be
able to do as well on his own as he
could having taken a course."
Jones suggests students begin
reviewing several months in
advance of the MCAT by
"studying old texts notes" in
math and science, studying
subject outline books (such as
Barnes and Noble) and going over
"Vised" vocabulary cards. In
addition he recommends students
purchase one of the MCAT review
books because "such publications
are useful for learning the rules of
the game."
No Recommendations
Advisor Marvin A. Karasek
replied when asked about the
course "it's very expensive. I
don't know of any documentation
that this course is any more
effective than other forms of
studying for the MCAT... I
don't make recommendations one
way or the other."
Associate Anatomy Professor
Donald L. Stillwell has long been
a cornerstone of Stanford pre-med
advising. For each of his advisees,
he evaluates grades and progress in
courses, then writes a
"prescription for reviewing to
prepare for the MCAT."
Stillwell does not recommend
the preparation course except
"for people who have made a late
choice (to try for medical
school)." He explained that
"Kaplan can substitute
superficially for uncompleted
courses or courses not taken."
Keith Mayo is a senior who
went pre-med at the beginning of
this school year and took the
MCAT this past weekend. He
described why he signed up for
the Kaplan course:
"This is my first year of
science. So far I've had two and a
half quarters of biology and
chemistry and no physics ... For
me it's not a review course."
Mayo added that "Dr. Stillwell
mentioned it (the course) at a
meeting and said if you're
desperate, it's okay." He added
that as a result of taking the
course "I hopefully will be
familiar with some of the stuff on
which I'd otherwise draw a
