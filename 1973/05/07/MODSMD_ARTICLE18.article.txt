# Checkers, Watergate Talks Bear Many Marked Contrasts
## 
### Associated Press 
WASHINGTON - Though both
dealt with charges of scandal,
President Nixon's Watergate
speech a week ago tonight bore
more contrasts than similarities to
his famous "Checkers speech" of
Sept. 23, 1952.
In the Checkers speech during
his first national campaign for vice
president, Nixon was called on to
explain an $18,235 trust fund
which constituents had set up to
help pay his political expenses.
Now, nearly 21 years later, he
again was on national television to
discuss a campaign scandal in
which his White House aides and
campaign committee were deeply
implicated.
As the young senator from
California, Nixon offered his
explanation of the trust fund and

denied anything was wrong with
how the money had been raised
and spent.
This time, as President, he
accepted the responsibility for the
Watergate break-in at Democratic
Party national headquarters and
the subsequent cover-up, although
he emphasized that he hadn't
believed any of his close aides
were involved until March 21,
more than nine months after the
break-in.
In the Checkers speech, Nixon
sought to turn the attack onto the
Democratic ticket which was
opposing him and presidential
nominee Dwight D. Eisenhower.
Monday, Nixon simply said
both political parties had slipped
increasingly into campaign
excesses.
