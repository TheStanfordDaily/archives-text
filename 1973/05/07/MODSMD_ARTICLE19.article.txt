# Three Meet Records Shattered
## Cal Outduels Cards For Big Meet Victory 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
The Golden Bears from
Berkeley captured the 79th Big
Meet title Saturday as they
defeated the Stanford track team
84-70 in the final dual
competition of the season for
both squads.
It was Cal's 37th win against
40 losses in the series which dates
back to 1893. There have been
two ties.
Saturday's meet was

highlighted by one Stanford
record, three meet records, and a
bevy of personal bests for athletes
from both teams. There were also
a couple of surprising upsets and
near-upsets.
Terry Albritton became only
the third 18 year-old in history to
put the shot 61-6'/i! as he set a new
meet and school record in that
event. Using a variation of new
world record holder A 1 Feurbach's
style, Albritton had every throw

go beyond the 60 foot mark.
Rolan Luka of Cal threw almost
two and a half feet beyond his
personal best to take second at
59-2V2.
While Albritton was setting
records, Stanford was being
destroyed in the 3,000 meter
steeplechase, the first running
event of the afternoon. Cal's
Emerson Davis set a meet record
in that event, leading a sweep for
the Bears with a season's best of

9:11. The Cards' leading
steeplechaser, Kurt Schoenrock,
missed the meet due to illness.
1-2 In Long Jump
Tom Anderson and Ken Kring
evened the score somewhat with
their 1-2 finish in the long jump.
Anderson leaped 23-2'/2 for the
victory. Bruce Kennedy, Cal's
record holder in the javelin at
259-8, won that event with a
230-9 toss. Steve Hopkins and
Rick Larson were second and
third foi - the Cards.
Stanford's Jim Howard pulled
out a victory in the discus with a
172-9 throw. Chris Adams was
second for Cal with 171-6, his
best toss so far this year. Pete
Dreissigacker took third for the
Cards at 169-2, almost two feet
over his previous lifetime best.
Cal's Ernie Lopez leaped
49-10'/2 to take the triple jump.
Rod Utley looked like he might
have beaten Lopez on his final
jump, but it measured out to only
49-314 for second. Derek Tolliver,
who has been plagued with muscle
pulls all year, leaped more than
two feet over his previous best to
take third for the Cards at
47-ll'/ 2 .
Had Stanford won the 440
relay early in the meet after the
disastrous steeplechase, perhaps
the outcome of the meet would
have been different. The race was
close for awhile, but a bad
handoff turned it into a Cal
runaway. The Bears won in 41.4
to Stanford's 42.3.
Mittelstaedt Takes Mile
The mile was one of the more
satisfying events of the day for
Stanford fans. With the band
playing the William Tell Overture
throughout the last half of the
race, Brian Mittelstaedt crossed
the finish line in 4:04.4, less than
half a second behind his personal
best. Les McFadden was second
for the Cards in 4:09.1.
Co-captain John Anderson
came through in the 440 to take
five points for Stanford. He
finished the lap in 47.9, his best
time this year and only a tenth of
a second off his lifetime best.
Dave Bagshaw recorded a
lifetime best in the high hurdles
and set the third meet record of
the day with a 14.1 victory. He
also moved up to fifth on the
Stanford all-time list in the 440
intermediates with a lifetime best
of 52.6. He finished second in
that event behind Jim Petralia's
52.5 for Cal.

Ken Curl nosed out Cal's John
Nichols to take the 100 in 9.9.
Nichols upset Curl in the 220 with
a lifetime best of 21.2 to tie the
meet record. Curl was second with
21.4. With only the two mile and
mile relay left at the time,
Nichols' victory cinched the meet
for Berkeley.
Rick Brown surprised no one
by winning the 880 in 1:50.
Vernell Jackson took third for the
Cards with 1:53.9. In the two
mile Mittelstaedt was the victor in
8:57.0, completing an impressive
double. Teammate Mark
McConnell was second at 9:02.
Ed Otter took the pole vault
for Cal at 16-0 for his second Big
Meet victory in a row. Kring was
third for the Cards at 14-6. Mai
McFarlane won the high jump for
the Bears with a 6-8 leap. Tom
Anderson beat Ken Thompson on
fewer misses to take second for
Stanford at 6-6.
In the final event, the mile
relay, Cal was easily the victor.
Stanford travels to Fresno for
the West Coast Relays next
weekend, and in two weeks flies
to Oregon for the Pac-8
championships at Eugene.
