# Pub, Women's Consultant
## ASSU Council Discusses Plans 
### TERRY ANZUR First Of Two Parts 
The list of priorities for recently-elected ASSU
co-presidents Kevin O'Grady, Beth Garfield, Charles
Ogletree, and Jim Friend includes Little Leland's Pub, the
Guest-In-Residence Program, lecture outlines for
undergraduate courses, establishment of a University
consultant for women students, recommendations for
campus judicial reform, and student nominations to
University committee posts.
After slightly more than one week in office, the new
ASSU Council of Presidents is determined to translate
these and other planks of its campaign platform into
realities for the student community.
According to Garfield, the bright pink campaign
leaflets containing the slate's platform summarize the
Council's goals for its year in office. "We feel that it's
realistic," she says.
The Council has already begun organizing efforts to
achieve some of their campaign goals, and each member
has assumed responsibility for immediate action on
various proposals.
Little Leland's Pub
Friend, former co-chairman of the campus McCloskey
campaign, predicts that Little Leland's Pub will be serving
hot food and liquor on campus within the next two years.
He states, "People are talking about when there will be a
Pub, not if there will be one."
According to Friend, the major obstacles to obtaining a
liquor license for the Pub will not come from the
anti-liquor policies of University founders. "Mrs. Stanford
doesn't carry as much weight around here as she used to,"
Friend observes, noting the faculty club's liquor license as
a previous exception to the no-liquor-on-campus policy.
The Alcoholic Beverage Control Board (ABC), which
grants all liquor licenses in the state, is likely to be Little
Leland's most formidable stumbling block.
"ABC is slow, and the Phi Delt incident made them
look like fools," comments Friend. "But there are many
other colleges that have similar problems and pubs." He
predicts that late-night hot snacks will be available at the
Ericina snack bar, beginning sometime next year.
Renovations, Improvements
According to Friend, a $17,000 renovation project will
create an atmosphere in Encina that will be "different
from the Coffee House, more like the Rats, the Oasis, or
Risotti's."

Friend is also working on recommendations to solve
Tresidder's financial difficulties and create a more
comfortable student union. The campaign leaflet
suggested such improvements and services as a grocery
store, a discount record store, a dry cleaning service, and a
pharmacy. However, Friend plans on creating a special
events series to attract more students to Tresidder.
Friend will carry an 8-15 unit academic load next fall,
and hopes to devote most of his free time to the ASSU.
"It's more important to me than anything else," he says.
Consultant For Women Students
Garfield, who served this year on the University
Commission for the Education and Employment of
Women (CEEW), will continue to advocate programs for
women as an ASSU co-president.
The Council's campaign platform called for the hiring
of a "women's advocate" as a salaried University
administrator. "We thought that would turn off the
Administration," says Garfield. "We've changed the name
to 'consultant for women students.' " The CEEW will
submit the proposal to University President Richard
Lyman and Provost William Miller this week.
"Obviously the administration is not going to build in a
voice that's going to speak against them. This person will
be a facilitator to channel the fantastic energy among
women on this campus," Garfield explains. She also plans
to work closely with the Women's Studies Center. "I'd
like to see it become part of Humanities and Sciences,"
she says.
Part-Time Status
Garfield, who plans to carry only eight units next fall,
hopes to spend as much time as possible coordinating
ASSU activities outside the ASSU office. Her main
concerns include improving orientation for freshmen and
foreign students, and a proposal to allow part-time
students to pay a reduced tuition rate.
The part-time status plan would allow seniors who
don't want to carry a full academic load and students who
want to hold outside jobs to pay for each unit separately,
rather than charging them the present flat tuition rate.
This proposal "deals directly with women and the whole
idea of extended education," Garfield states. She will
work on the project during the coming academic year and
hopes it will be in operation by the following year.
Tomorrow: O'Grady sand Ogletree s immediate plans,
proposals for funding new and expanding ASSU programs,
the Council's view of the ASSU Senate, and plans for
increasing student involvement in the ASSU.
