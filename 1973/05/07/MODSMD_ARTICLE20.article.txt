# Shuffling The Cards
## Stanford's Best Athlete? 
### Dave Robinson 
Ken Kring wasn't competing in his specialty at
Saturday's Big Meet, but then again Kring doesn't
really have one.
Kring's event is the decathlon, a grueling
competition which encompasses 10 events over a
two day period, ranging from the 100 meter dash to
the shot put. It is no wonder that the winner of the
Olympic decathlon is quadrennially proclaimed the
"world's greatest athlete."
Kring, who last weekend at the Mt. San Antonio
Relays recorded an impressive 7151 decathlon
score, denies any claim to the title of "Stanford's
best athlete," but his views on the decathlon as an
indicator of athletic ability represent an interesting
analysis of what it takes to be a top-flight athlete.
"I'm not really that talented," Kring said when
asked how he would compare to some of Stanford's
better known athletes like Mike Boryla, John
Winesberry, or Rich Kelley. "I'm not really
motor-skill oriented. I'm just a good competitor."
Realized Limitations
Kring took up the decathlon because of athletic
failures, not successes. "I used to be strictly a pole
vaulter when I went to high school in Pittsburgh,"
he recalls, "but we moved to Santa Maria between
my sophomore and junior years and the
competition was so stiff that I realized I didn't have
much of a future in an individual event."
So he took up the decathlon and the seemingly
awesome task of becoming proficient at 10 events —
the 100 meters, 400 meters, 110 meter high hurdles,
1500 meters, high jump, long jump, javelin, discus,
shot put, and pole vault — a list of events so varied
and difficult that Kring sometimes wonders why
anyone would compete in the decathlon.
"Until we become a totally masochistic society, I
don't see why a really top athlete like Randy
Williams or James McAllister would choose the
decathlon. Right now decathlon performers aren't
the world's greatest athletes — they're the world's
greatest second best athletes."
But despite the grueling nature of the decathlon,
Kring enjoys the esthetic aspect of totally individual
competition. "My own rationalization is that the
decathlon is much more esthetic than any team
sport — the art is to perfect your own skill in a

performance. It doesn't really matter whether you
beat Cal or not."
Isolated Practice
What does matter is individual progress through
isolated practice sessions. "I've always trained by
myself until this year," Kring says. "I've always
been geared for a decathlon type environment."
Kring's statement was especially true during his
two years at Alan Hancock Junior College in Santa
Maria, where he competed under his father who still
coaches the Hancock track team. "I only saw my
dad at meets and at home," Kring recalls. "I never
saw him at practice."
Those lonely workouts have been responsible for
an impressive list of lifetime bests in the 10
decathlon events. Kring's best marks to date are:
10.7 in the 100 meters; 14.8 in the 110 meter high
hurdles; a 49.1 400 meters; 4:25.5 1500 meters;
23-4 long jump; 6-4 3/8 high jump; 15-1 pole vault;
109-0 discus; 39-4 shot put, and 175-11 javelin.
Except for his marks in the shot put and discus,
Kring's efforts are outstanding for the decathlon.
His pole vault, high jump, long jump, and 100 meter
marks are impressive even for individual events.
'Weights Horrible'
"By my weights are horrible," Kring admits.
"Those events will be the deciding factor at the
Pac-8 and NCAA meets."
Kring's best composite score to date is a 7243 he
recorded in 1971, but he considers his 7151 at Mt.
Sac his best performance because of the adverse
conditions. The world record in the event belongs to
Russia's Nicholai Avilov.wlioscoredB4s4 in winning
the gold medal at the Munich Olympics.
Kring obviously has a long way to go to match a
mark like Avilov's, but compared to other United
States performers he ranks in the top 10 among
collegiates and top 20 overall.
The 1976 Olympics is a definite possibility,
especially if Kring keeps plugging along. "When I
first learned the Fosbury Flop (a high jump method
made famous by Dick Fosbury), it took me four
months to go over 5-6," Kring said.
Now of course, he has flopped over 6-4 in
addition to his accomplishments in the other nine
events, a feat which establishes Ken Kring as
Stanford's most versatile, if not best athlete.

saw him at practice."
Those lonely workouts have been responsible for
an impressive list of lifetime bests in the 10
decathlon events. Kring's best marks to date are:
10.7 in the 100 meters; 14.8 in the 110 meter high
hurdles; a 49.1 400 meters; 4:25.5 1500 meters;
23-4 long jump; 6-4 3/8 high jump; 15-1 pole vault;
109-0 discus; 39-4 shot put, and 175-11 javelin.
Except for his marks in the shot put and discus,
Kring's efforts are outstanding for the decathlon.
His pole vault, high jump, long jump, and 100 meter
marks are impressive even for individual events.
'Weights Horrible'
"By my weights are horrible," Kring admits.
"Those events will be the deciding factor at the
Pac-8 and NCAA meets."
Kring's best composite score to date is a 7243 he
recorded in 1971, but he considers his 7151 at Mt.
Sac his best performance because of the adverse
conditions. The world record in the event belongs to
Russia's Nicholai Avilov.wlioscoredB4s4 in winning
the gold medal at the Munich Olympics.
Kring obviously has a long way to go to match a
mark like Avilov's, but compared to other United
States performers he ranks in the top 10 among
collegiates and top 20 overall.
The 1976 Olympics is a definite possibility,
especially if Kring keeps plugging along. "When I
first learned the Fosbury Flop (a high jump method
made famous by Dick Fosbury), it took me four
months to go over 5-6," Kring said.
Now of course, he has flopped over 6-4 in
addition to his accomplishments in the other nine
events, a feat which establishes Ken Kring as
Stanford's most versatile, if not best athlete.
Ken Kring wasn't competing in his specialty at
Saturday's Big Meet, but then again Kring doesn't
really have one.
Kring's event is the decathlon, a grueling
competition which encompasses 10 events over a
two day period, ranging from the 100 meter dash to
the shot put. It is no wonder that the winner of the
Olympic decathlon is quadrennially proclaimed the
"world's greatest athlete."
Kring, who last weekend at the Mt. San Antonio
Relays recorded an impressive 7151 decathlon
score, denies any claim to the title of "Stanford's
best athlete," but his views on the decathlon as an
indicator of athletic ability represent an interesting
analysis of what it takes to be a top-flight athlete.
"I'm not really that talented," Kring said when
asked how he would compare to some of Stanford's
better known athletes like Mike Boryla, John
Winesberry, or Rich Kelley. "I'm not really
motor-skill oriented. I'm just a good competitor."
Realized Limitations
Kring took up the decathlon because of athletic
failures, not successes. "I used to be strictly a pole
vaulter when I went to high school in Pittsburgh,"
he recalls, "but we moved to Santa Maria between
my sophomore and junior years and the
competition was so stiff that I realized I didn't have
much of a future in an individual event."
So he took up the decathlon and the seemingly
awesome task of becoming proficient at 10 events —
the 100 meters, 400 meters, 110 meter high hurdles,
1500 meters, high jump, long jump, javelin, discus,
shot put, and pole vault — a list of events so varied
and difficult that Kring sometimes wonders why
anyone would compete in the decathlon.
"Until we become a totally masochistic society, I
don't see why a really top athlete like Randy
Williams or James McAllister would choose the
decathlon. Right now decathlon performers aren't
the world's greatest athletes — they're the world's
greatest second best athletes."
But despite the grueling nature of the decathlon,
Kring enjoys the esthetic aspect of totally individual
competition. "My own rationalization is that the
decathlon is much more esthetic than any team
sport — the art is to perfect your own skill in a

performance. It doesn't really matter whether you
beat Cal or not."
Isolated Practice
What does matter is individual progress through
isolated practice sessions. "I've always trained by
myself until this year," Kring says. "I've always
been geared for a decathlon type environment."
Kring's statement was especially true during his
two years at Alan Hancock Junior College in Santa
Maria, where he competed under his father who still
coaches the Hancock track team. "I only saw my
dad at meets and at home," Kring recalls. "I never
saw him at practice."

"I'm not really that talented," Kring said when
asked how he would compare to some of Stanford's
better known athletes like Mike Boryla, John
Winesberry, or Rich Kelley. "I'm not really
motor-skill oriented. I'm just a good competitor."
Realized Limitations
Kring took up the decathlon because of athletic
failures, not successes. "I used to be strictly a pole
vaulter when I went to high school in Pittsburgh,"
he recalls, "but we moved to Santa Maria between
my sophomore and junior years and the
competition was so stiff that I realized I didn't have
much of a future in an individual event."
So he took up the decathlon and the seemingly
awesome task of becoming proficient at 10 events —
the 100 meters, 400 meters, 110 meter high hurdles,
1500 meters, high jump, long jump, javelin, discus,
shot put, and pole vault — a list of events so varied
and difficult that Kring sometimes wonders why
anyone would compete in the decathlon.
"Until we become a totally masochistic society, I
don't see why a really top athlete like Randy
Williams or James McAllister would choose the
decathlon. Right now decathlon performers aren't
the world's greatest athletes — they're the world's
greatest second best athletes."
But despite the grueling nature of the decathlon,
Kring enjoys the esthetic aspect of totally individual
competition. "My own rationalization is that the
decathlon is much more esthetic than any team
sport — the art is to perfect your own skill in a

performance. It doesn't really matter whether you
beat Cal or not."
Isolated Practice
What does matter is individual progress through
isolated practice sessions. "I've always trained by
myself until this year," Kring says. "I've always
been geared for a decathlon type environment."
Kring's statement was especially true during his
two years at Alan Hancock Junior College in Santa
Maria, where he competed under his father who still
coaches the Hancock track team. "I only saw my
dad at meets and at home," Kring recalls. "I never
saw him at practice."
Those lonely workouts have been responsible for
an impressive list of lifetime bests in the 10
decathlon events. Kring's best marks to date are:
10.7 in the 100 meters; 14.8 in the 110 meter high
hurdles; a 49.1 400 meters; 4:25.5 1500 meters;
23-4 long jump; 6-4 3/8 high jump; 15-1 pole vault;
109-0 discus; 39-4 shot put, and 175-11 javelin.
Except for his marks in the shot put and discus,
Kring's efforts are outstanding for the decathlon.
His pole vault, high jump, long jump, and 100 meter
marks are impressive even for individual events.
'Weights Horrible'
"By my weights are horrible," Kring admits.
"Those events will be the deciding factor at the
Pac-8 and NCAA meets."
Kring's best composite score to date is a 7243 he
recorded in 1971, but he considers his 7151 at Mt.
Sac his best performance because of the adverse
conditions. The world record in the event belongs to
Russia's Nicholai Avilov.wlioscoredB4s4 in winning
the gold medal at the Munich Olympics.
Kring obviously has a long way to go to match a
mark like Avilov's, but compared to other United
States performers he ranks in the top 10 among
collegiates and top 20 overall.
The 1976 Olympics is a definite possibility,
especially if Kring keeps plugging along. "When I
first learned the Fosbury Flop (a high jump method
made famous by Dick Fosbury), it took me four
months to go over 5-6," Kring said.
Now of course, he has flopped over 6-4 in
addition to his accomplishments in the other nine
events, a feat which establishes Ken Kring as
Stanford's most versatile, if not best athlete.
