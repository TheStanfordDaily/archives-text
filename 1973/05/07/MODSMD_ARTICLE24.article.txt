### VLAE KERSHNER 
Seven Stanford players are still
alive in the battle for eight
qualifying positions at the 73rd
annual California State Tennis
Championships at Portola Valley.
The seven, Chip Fisher, John
Whitlinger, Paul Sidone, Mark
Mitchell, Chico Hagey, Gery
Groslimond, and Craig Johnson,
all won either one or two matches
Saturday and yesterday.
The other 24 positions in the
32-player event have been filled
by players exempt from
qualifying. This list includes

Stanford's four top players, Sandy
Mayer, Jim Delaney, Rick Fisher,
and Pat DuPre.
The eight berths for which the
seven Stanford players are seeking
to qualify will be filled in final
rounds today and tomorrow.
Actual play in the prestigious
tournament, begins Wednesday.
Mayer, the defending
champion, will be up against
stiff competition, including
several professionals from the
World Championship Tennis tour
who are seeking to qualify for the
$150,000 Alan King Classic in Las
Vegas. Finalists for the Cal State
tourney will automatically qualify
for the King tournament.
Highlights of the weekend's
action included the play of
Sidone, who beat Cal's third
piayer, Manuel Casteneda, 6-4,
6-2.
Mitchell topped Chris Oates,
with whom he is first ranked in
Boys 18 doubles, 7-6, 6-3, while
Groslimond topped former
Stanford player Mac Claflin 6-4,
6-2.
In addition to the seven
players, named, Gunn's Nick
Saviano is also still in the running
for a spot in the tourney. Saviano
has signed a letter of intent to
come to Stanford next year.
In other tennis news, USC,
playing without Raul Ramirez, its
top player, downed UCLA 6-3
Saturday. USC thus "wins" the
unofficial Pae-8 southern division
crown with a 5-1 mark, compared
to Stanford's 4-2, UCLA's 3-3,
and Cal's 0-6 records.
