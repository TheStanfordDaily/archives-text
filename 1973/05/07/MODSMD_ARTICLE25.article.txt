# Take Two Of Three From Bruins
## Cards Sweep Baseball Twin Bill 
### SCOTT DAILEY 
Sweeping a conference
doubleheader for the first time in
over two years, the Cards zapped
UCLA Saturday, 4-2 and 3-1,
after dropping Friday's game
against the Bruins, 2-1.
Dave Frost held onto his
unbeaten record in the first game
of the doubleheader, winning his
fifth game on four hits. Nick
Peterson picked up the save after
Frost gave up two runs with one
down in the seventh.
Notching his seventh win of
the season against two defeats was
A 1 Arthur, who fanned eight and
allowed no earned runs in the
second game. Arthur, who went
the distance, has now surrendered
only two earned runs in his last
36-2/3 innings pitched, spanning
his last six games.
Home runs by Bob Hampton
and Mark Lucich in the first game,
and a leadoff blast by Mike
Nelson in the nightcap marked the
return of the long ball to the
Stanford attack.
Throwing Strikes
Arthur's development from
junior varsity pitcher with some
promise into one of the top
starters on the varsity club was
explained by Coach Ray Young.
"Number one, he's throwing
strikes for really the first time. He
hasn't had confidence in his
fastball and his curve, and we've
tried to pump him up a little bit
and talk to him.
"We just told him to throw the
ball. He was trying to finesse the
hitters, and we just told him to

throw his fastball and his slider.
Now he's throwing the fastball
and the breaking pitch, and his
change of pace is looking good.
He just has confidence in his
ability."
The Cards, who hopefully
gained a little more confidence
over the weekend, now stand at
6-9 in the Pac-8 and are tied with
Cal for third, and can push the
Bears into the cellar with a series
win next weekend. Stanford plays
Cal in a single game Friday in
Berkeley before wrapping up the
season on Saturday with a
noon doubleheader at Sunken
Diamond. A series sweep would
give the Cards their second
straight .500 Pac-8 season.

Two makeup games are
scheduled for the middle of the
week. San Jose State hosts the
Cards at2:3o p.m.Tuesday and Cal
State-Hayward plays here
Wednesday also at 2:30 p.m.
Seven Card Errors
Stanford gave UCLA about five
million chances to win Friday, but
the Bruins added three of their
own errors to Stanford's seven,
and the Cards entered the ninth
inning tied, 1-1 after Dave Baker
followed Ray Anderson's eighth
inning single with a run-scoring
double.
UCLA catcher Venoy Garrison
led off with a single off reliever
and loser Peterson. Winning
pitcher Gary Zail sacrificed

Garrison to second, and one out
later, Tim Doerr hit Peterson's
first pitch for a single to score
Garrison.
Peterson got a save in
Saturday's first game, and both
Hampton and Lucich cracked in
home runs in Stanford's 4-2 win.
Hampton, who tripled in the
second and scored on Pat Rusco's
sacrifice, nailed his sixth home
run of the season in the third to
put the Cards ahead, 2-0. Then
Lucich cracked his fourth homer
of the year off reliever Larry
Saarloos in the fifth.
Winning pitcher Frost, who
gave up just one extra-base hit — a
two-run double by Mark Swedlow
in the seventh, struck out seven
and walked one.
Mike Nelson carried the home
run barrage into the second game
when he sent Frank Panick's third
pitch of the ballgame screaming
over the rightfield barrier.
The Cards picked up their
second and third runs in the
second when Gary Morton
doubled and Steve Davis followed
with a triple. Davis scored when
Joe Lamoure grounded out to
third base.

and talk to him.
"We just told him to throw the
ball. He was trying to finesse the
hitters, and we just told him to

throw his fastball and his slider.
Now he's throwing the fastball
and the breaking pitch, and his
change of pace is looking good.
He just has confidence in his
ability."
The Cards, who hopefully
gained a little more confidence
over the weekend, now stand at
6-9 in the Pac-8 and are tied with
Cal for third, and can push the
Bears into the cellar with a series
win next weekend. Stanford plays
Cal in a single game Friday in
Berkeley before wrapping up the
season on Saturday with a
noon doubleheader at Sunken
Diamond. A series sweep would
give the Cards their second
straight .500 Pac-8 season.

Two makeup games are
scheduled for the middle of the
week. San Jose State hosts the
Cards at2:3o p.m.Tuesday and Cal
State-Hayward plays here
Wednesday also at 2:30 p.m.
Seven Card Errors
Stanford gave UCLA about five
million chances to win Friday, but
the Bruins added three of their
own errors to Stanford's seven,
and the Cards entered the ninth
inning tied, 1-1 after Dave Baker
followed Ray Anderson's eighth
inning single with a run-scoring
double.
UCLA catcher Venoy Garrison
led off with a single off reliever
and loser Peterson. Winning
pitcher Gary Zail sacrificed

Garrison to second, and one out
later, Tim Doerr hit Peterson's
first pitch for a single to score
Garrison.
Peterson got a save in
Saturday's first game, and both
Hampton and Lucich cracked in
home runs in Stanford's 4-2 win.
Hampton, who tripled in the
second and scored on Pat Rusco's
sacrifice, nailed his sixth home
run of the season in the third to
put the Cards ahead, 2-0. Then
Lucich cracked his fourth homer
of the year off reliever Larry
Saarloos in the fifth.
Winning pitcher Frost, who
gave up just one extra-base hit — a
two-run double by Mark Swedlow
in the seventh, struck out seven
and walked one.
Mike Nelson carried the home
run barrage into the second game
when he sent Frank Panick's third
pitch of the ballgame screaming
over the rightfield barrier.
The Cards picked up their
second and third runs in the
second when Gary Morton
doubled and Steve Davis followed
with a triple. Davis scored when
Joe Lamoure grounded out to
third base.

HE'S IN THERE — Stanford's Bob Reece dives back to first base Friday, safely eluding UCLA's
attempted pickoff. The Bruins won Friday's game 2-1, but Stanford swept Saturday's doubleheader,
beating UCLA 4-2 in the first game before winning a 3-1 decision in the nightcap. Stanford is now 6-9 in
Pac-8 play and 31-18 overall.
Sweeping a conference
doubleheader for the first time in
over two years, the Cards zapped
UCLA Saturday, 4-2 and 3-1,
after dropping Friday's game
against the Bruins, 2-1.
Dave Frost held onto his
unbeaten record in the first game
of the doubleheader, winning his
fifth game on four hits. Nick
Peterson picked up the save after
Frost gave up two runs with one
down in the seventh.
Notching his seventh win of
the season against two defeats was
A 1 Arthur, who fanned eight and
allowed no earned runs in the
second game. Arthur, who went
the distance, has now surrendered
only two earned runs in his last
36-2/3 innings pitched, spanning
his last six games.
Home runs by Bob Hampton
and Mark Lucich in the first game,
and a leadoff blast by Mike
Nelson in the nightcap marked the
return of the long ball to the
Stanford attack.
Throwing Strikes
Arthur's development from
junior varsity pitcher with some
promise into one of the top
starters on the varsity club was
explained by Coach Ray Young.
"Number one, he's throwing
strikes for really the first time. He
hasn't had confidence in his
fastball and his curve, and we've
tried to pump him up a little bit
and talk to him.
"We just told him to throw the
ball. He was trying to finesse the
hitters, and we just told him to
