# Lacrosse Team Loses Final Regular Game
## 
### MARK WHITE 
Unable to overcome a decisive
5-1 first quarter deficit, the
Stanford lacrosse team closed out
its 1973 regular season with a 9-5
loss to San FranciscoLacrosseclub
Saturday in San Francisco.
"We pulled our famous first
quarter slump again," diagnosed
coach Peter Schneider. "Our game
plan was to stop their two
All-American midfielders and
their excellent attackman Chip
Markell. Well, we did stop them,
Markell got only one goal, but
they outscrambled us on ground
balls and scored on a lot of
broken plays."
San Francisco broke out on
top with a goal after a minute and
a half of the first quarter, but Paul
Yeuell replied 30 seconds later
with his 11th goal of the season to
tie the score at 1-1.
Things quickly soured for the
Cards, however, as alert San
Francisco play resulted in four
successive scores. "I think the
difference may have been in their
experience," said Schneider.
"Once we got on track, we were
really going for those loose balls,
but they would know just where
to be oositioned and the result
would be a two-on-one against our
goalie, Hal Richardson."
Stanford picked up the tempo
in the second quarter and scored
again to come within three, 5-2, at
halftime. Cardinal control of the
game continued into the third
quarter and when Butch Hazlett

scored two consecutive goals early
in the period (his 33rd and 34th
of the season), it appeared
Stanford still had a shot at San
Francisco as the Cards pulled to
within one, 5-4.
Penalties took the steam out of
Stanford's play and when San
Francisco scored three straight
goals late in the quarter, the Cards
in effect lost the game. The teams
traded goals in the fourth period
to round out the final score at
9-5.
The loss evened Stanford's
season record at 6-6. The Cards
were 2-4 in league play.
"Looking back on our season, I
think we played nearly to the
limits of our ability," recalls
Schneider. "In all but two of our
defeats we came back from big
deficits to lose by only one goal.
We gave Navy, the best team by
far in our league, their toughest
game of the season.
"I'm pleased the way our team
played — I think the team can be
proud. And I was especially
pleased with the play of Ken
Ketchum, Paul Yeuell, Shelly
Gordon, Peter Fox and Dave
Ruiz: these guys really put out."
Post season play begins next
Saturday when all eight teams
meet on Stanford's rugby and
practice fields to determine the
league championship. Undefeated
Naval Post Graduate School is the
favorite, with Stanford and three
other teams picked to be fighting
for the runner-up slot.

other teams picked to be fighting
for the runner-up slot.
Unable to overcome a decisive
5-1 first quarter deficit, the
Stanford lacrosse team closed out
its 1973 regular season with a 9-5
loss to San FranciscoLacrosseclub
Saturday in San Francisco.
"We pulled our famous first
quarter slump again," diagnosed
coach Peter Schneider. "Our game
plan was to stop their two
All-American midfielders and
their excellent attackman Chip
Markell. Well, we did stop them,
Markell got only one goal, but
they outscrambled us on ground
balls and scored on a lot of
broken plays."
San Francisco broke out on
top with a goal after a minute and
a half of the first quarter, but Paul
Yeuell replied 30 seconds later
with his 11th goal of the season to
tie the score at 1-1.
Things quickly soured for the
Cards, however, as alert San
Francisco play resulted in four
successive scores. "I think the
difference may have been in their
experience," said Schneider.
"Once we got on track, we were
really going for those loose balls,
but they would know just where
to be oositioned and the result
would be a two-on-one against our
goalie, Hal Richardson."
Stanford picked up the tempo
in the second quarter and scored
again to come within three, 5-2, at
halftime. Cardinal control of the
game continued into the third
quarter and when Butch Hazlett

scored two consecutive goals early
in the period (his 33rd and 34th
of the season), it appeared
Stanford still had a shot at San
Francisco as the Cards pulled to
within one, 5-4.
Penalties took the steam out of
Stanford's play and when San
Francisco scored three straight
goals late in the quarter, the Cards
in effect lost the game. The teams
traded goals in the fourth period
to round out the final score at
9-5.
The loss evened Stanford's
season record at 6-6. The Cards
were 2-4 in league play.
"Looking back on our season, I
think we played nearly to the
limits of our ability," recalls
Schneider. "In all but two of our
defeats we came back from big
deficits to lose by only one goal.
We gave Navy, the best team by
far in our league, their toughest
game of the season.
"I'm pleased the way our team
played — I think the team can be
proud. And I was especially
pleased with the play of Ken
Ketchum, Paul Yeuell, Shelly
Gordon, Peter Fox and Dave
Ruiz: these guys really put out."
Post season play begins next
Saturday when all eight teams
meet on Stanford's rugby and
practice fields to determine the
league championship. Undefeated
Naval Post Graduate School is the
favorite, with Stanford and three
other teams picked to be fighting
for the runner-up slot.
