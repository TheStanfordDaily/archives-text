# Spartan Golfers Defeat Cardinals
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Apparently Stanford and San
Jose State will have to wait until
the NCAA tournament in June to
determine 1973 Bay Area golf
supremacy.
Stanford, after defeating the
Spartans by two shots last
weekend in the U.S. Collegiate
Invitational, dropped a 34-20
decision to San Jose Saturday on
the Stanford course, once again
throwing the question of
Card-Spartan golf superiority into
total confusion.
Saturday's match was San
Jose's second straight dual match
victory over Stanford. The
Spartans defeated the Cards 33-21
last month at San Jose Country
Club.
This time Coach Jerry Vroom's
squad won by a slightly larger
margin, but the Spartans' 14 point

edge was somewhat misleading. If
the six 18 hole scores for each
team were simply added up, San
Jose State would have won by one
shot, but the complicated dual
match scoring system gave the
Spartans their 14 point margin.
In college dual matches (a form
of competition which is rapidly
dying out in favor of medal play
tournaments), the score is
compiled on the basis of six
individual matches and three
best-ball matches. The
number-one men from each
school play each other, number
two plays number two, etc.
In addition three two-man
teams simultaneously square off
in best-ball competition, counting
only the best score from each
team on every hole.
In each of these nine matches
(six individual and three
best-ball), the winner on the front
nine gets two points, the winner
of the back nine gets two points,
and the 18 hole winner gets two
points. So there are six points at
stake in each match, or 54 points
overall.
Saturday's 34-20 score was the
result of four San Jose State
victories in the individual matches
and two out of three Spartan best
ball victories.
Denny Colvin and Conrad
Nilmeier were Stanford's only
individual winners. Colvin fired a
69 in his 4-2 victory over Dean
May (73), and Nilmeier, last
week's U.S. Collegiate Invitational
champion, carded a 71 in an easy
6-0 victory over Jim Knoll (79).
In the other matches, Don
Thames equalled Colvin's 69 in a
6-0 victory over Dave Baskins
(73), Phil Barry (74) won a 5-1
decision over Aly Trompas (77),
Mark Lye (75) won 4-2 over
George Pettinger (77), and Kim
Porter (70) blanked John Beers
(74), 6-0.
The Cards' lone best-ball
victory was recorded by Nilmeier
and Trompas (68), who won 5-1
over Barry and Knoll (69).

Thursday was a big day for
holes-in-one at the Stanford
course. After golf manager Rich
Cortez had aced the eighth hole
Thursday afternoon, varsity golfer
Bob Harrington recorded a
hole-in-one on the third hole late
Thursday evening.
Aly Trompas played with both
golfers, witnessing Cortez'
hole-in-one on the eighth hole and
then watching in utter disbelief as
Harrington holed his three iron
tee shot on the 180 yard third
hole three hours later.
