# 'Daily' Humiliates Lackeys
## 
### 
The Stanford Daily combined a balanced
attack with almost flawless defense to whip the
Administration Lackeys, 11-5, in a softball game
Saturday at the frosh diamond.
Southpaw Larry Fleece went the distance for
the Daily, dazzling Lackey batsmen with his
array of two pitches — good and bad.
The Lackeys weren't so lucky with
moundsmen, however. Starter Bill Miller, in the
twilight of a mediocre career, was forced to retire
early in the game, and several successors were
unable to stem the flood of Daily hits.
Shortstop Buz Battle hit the only homer of
the contest, a slashing drive to left, but otherwise
it was almost impossible to single out individual
performers. "It was a team effort," noted
manager-first baseman Charlie "Stretch"
Hoffman.
The Lackeys' loss came despite the fact that
they supplied the umpires at every base — the
children of their players. To even the score,
however, Cathy Siena, daughter of Jim
"You-Can't-Do-That-lt's-lllegal" Siena, played
several innings for the Daily.
Easily the Lackeys' least impressive performer
was relief hurler Jim "Tubby" Lyons, who
yielded nine Daily runs and was tagged with the
loss. His pitches consistently found home plate;

unfortunately, they kept bouncing off it.
At one point Lyons was also accused of
throwing a grease ball. However, this charge was
dismissed when it was pointed out that he didn't
have enough hair on his head to work up the
grease needed to doctor the ball.
There were a few bright spots for the Lackeys,
though: chiefly the circus fielding of leftfielder
Harold "Hot Dog" Boyd and the play of infielder
"Dirty Harry" Press, who surprised everyone —
including himself — by throwing out a Daily
batsman on a grounder hit to him at third.
Defensively, the Daily infield sparkled with
Hall "Ron Santo" Daily at third. Battle at short,
Dave Robinson at second, and Hoffman at first.
Leftfielder Glenn "Flash" Kramon fielded
brilliantly all day, besides hitting the ball
consistently well.
The Daily was without the services of hurler
Don Tollefson, who has contracted a social
disease. He stayed in the dugout during the entire
game, sipping a coke and humming "What Made
Milwaukee Famous Has Made A Loser Out Of
Me."
After the game, Lackey coach Bob "Roly
Poly Rosy" Rosenzweig challenged the Daily to a
spelling bee. It was reported that the first word
in the proposed contest would be Rosy's last
name.

Defensively, the Daily infield sparkled with
Hall "Ron Santo" Daily at third. Battle at short,
Dave Robinson at second, and Hoffman at first.
Leftfielder Glenn "Flash" Kramon fielded
brilliantly all day, besides hitting the ball
consistently well.
The Daily was without the services of hurler
Don Tollefson, who has contracted a social
disease. He stayed in the dugout during the entire
game, sipping a coke and humming "What Made
Milwaukee Famous Has Made A Loser Out Of
Me."
After the game, Lackey coach Bob "Roly
Poly Rosy" Rosenzweig challenged the Daily to a
spelling bee. It was reported that the first word
in the proposed contest would be Rosy's last
name.
The Stanford Daily combined a balanced
attack with almost flawless defense to whip the
Administration Lackeys, 11-5, in a softball game
Saturday at the frosh diamond.
Southpaw Larry Fleece went the distance for
the Daily, dazzling Lackey batsmen with his
array of two pitches — good and bad.
The Lackeys weren't so lucky with
moundsmen, however. Starter Bill Miller, in the
twilight of a mediocre career, was forced to retire
early in the game, and several successors were
unable to stem the flood of Daily hits.
Shortstop Buz Battle hit the only homer of
the contest, a slashing drive to left, but otherwise
it was almost impossible to single out individual
performers. "It was a team effort," noted
manager-first baseman Charlie "Stretch"
Hoffman.
The Lackeys' loss came despite the fact that
they supplied the umpires at every base — the
children of their players. To even the score,
however, Cathy Siena, daughter of Jim
"You-Can't-Do-That-lt's-lllegal" Siena, played
several innings for the Daily.
Easily the Lackeys' least impressive performer
was relief hurler Jim "Tubby" Lyons, who
yielded nine Daily runs and was tagged with the
loss. His pitches consistently found home plate;

unfortunately, they kept bouncing off it.
At one point Lyons was also accused of
throwing a grease ball. However, this charge was
dismissed when it was pointed out that he didn't
have enough hair on his head to work up the
grease needed to doctor the ball.
There were a few bright spots for the Lackeys,
though: chiefly the circus fielding of leftfielder
Harold "Hot Dog" Boyd and the play of infielder
"Dirty Harry" Press, who surprised everyone —
including himself — by throwing out a Daily
batsman on a grounder hit to him at third.
