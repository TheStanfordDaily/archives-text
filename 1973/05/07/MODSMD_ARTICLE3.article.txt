# 1307 Students Unassigned
## Draw Results Cause Groans 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
The groans and grunts you may
have heard last Thursday afternoon
were probably caused by the results of
the housing draw. This year, 1307
students were left unassigned after
round one, almost 500 more than last
year.
The reason so many students are
without spaces is that about 450 more
people participated in round one this
year than last. This figure was offset
by an increase of only 19 spaces in the
housing system.
Males suffered more than females,
as 664 men were left without a space
compared to 356 women. Men are
allotted a smaller proportion of the
spaces because they have the
opportunity to join fraternities.
The cutoff points, which determine
who gets assigned in the first round
and who doesn't dropped by more
than 400 from last year. Women
needed 3297 or less to be assigned,
compared to 3919 a year ago. The
figures for men were 2485 and 3023,
respectively.
The number of students who did
get assigned in round one was
approximately the same as last year.
Nine hundred eighteen women and
1120 men did receive one of their
eight choices.
Off-Campus Living
Besides those assigned on campus
and those unassigned, 34 women and
30 men must live off campus because
they requested not to be assigned if

none of their choices could be met.
The hardest house to get into was
Eucalypto in Lagunita Court. Lathrop,
Alondra, Grove, Durand, Lambda Nu,
and other Lagunita houses also had
cutoff numbers well below 1000.
There were four residences that
were left unfilled after round one.
Kappa Sigma, an all-male house has 20
spaces open, and Phi Sig, also all male,
has five places.
256 Manzanita Openings
The Mirrielees apartments have 22
spaces remaining for males. Manzanita
Park contains the rest of the openings,
144 for men and 112 for women.
For those who did not receive a
housing assignment and those who are
not satisfied with what they did
receive, round two provides a second
chance.
Only those students who
participated in round one are eligible
for the second round. One ideal aspect
of round two is that if you list your
round one assignment, you are
guaranteed that choice or a higher one
in the second round.
Deadlines Today
The deadline for turning in
response cards for round two and
choice cards for round two is today at
5 p.m. If a student wishes to accept his
round one assignment he will be
required to sign a Residence
Agreement confirming his acceptance
of the space upon returning the
response card.
There is a special procedure for

those students who wish to draw into
the Manzanita Park trailers in the
second round. The cards of the entire
group (two, three, or four people)
must be brought to the Housing Office
by today.
If the second round this year
compares to that of last year, many
more people should have a place to
live on campus. Then the men's cutoff
number rose 346 and the women's
rose 185.
Those students who are still
unassigned at the end of round two,
will receive detailed housing
information describing waiting list
procedures and other housing
possibilities.
The results of round two should be
available on or before May 18.
