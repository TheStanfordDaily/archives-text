# Boryla Shines In Saturday Grid Scrimmage
## 
### 
Spring football practice continued at a steady pace over the
weekend as head coach Jack Christiansen directed a 60 minute
controlled scrimmage before several hundred onlookers on the
practice field Saturday morning.
It was the last full scale scrimmage before the annual
Red-White game, which takes place this Saturday at Stanford
Stadium at 9:30 a.m.
Mike Boryla looked especially sharp in the drills Saturday
as he connected on 16 of 28 passes for 202 yards and two
touchdowns. David Tenn, one of several standouts from last
year's undefeated freshman team, led the ball carriers with 48
. yards on 10 carries.
"We're still at that stage of the season where we are looking
at individuals," Christiansen said. "Right now the defense is a
little ahead of the offense and I think that's why we're not
scoring a lot."
"Our younger players have done especially well; Jerry
Waldvogel and Pat Donovan looked very good today. Roger
Stillwell and Donovan have been doing very good jobs at the
defensive end positions."
Defensive back Jim Kaffen continued his good play with an
interception and several deflected passes. Tight end Glen Stone
teamed up with Boryla for the first touchdown of the day, a
15 yarder, and Tenn later scampered into the endzone on a 25
yard toss from Boryla.
