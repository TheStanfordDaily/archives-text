Ellsberg Defense Seeks Dismissal
LOS ANGELES — Defense attorneys in the
Pentagon papers trial said yesterday that they will
go to a federal appeals court to ask that the charges
against Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony Russo be
dismissed immediately on grounds that the White
House tried to compromise the judge.
The attorneys said they were working on a
petition for a writ of mandamus to be filed today
with the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal. They
said they would ask the court to order U.S. District
Court Judge Matt Byrne to dismiss the charges of
espionage, conspiracy and theft against Ellsberg and
Russo.
The appeal to the higher court comes after Byrne
refused on Friday to dismiss the case. The dismissal
motion was based on the defense's contention that
Byrne had been prejudiced during the trial by a
White House offer to consider Byrne for the post of
FBI director.
Byrne is still considering the possibility of
dismissal of the case because of a link between the
controversial Watergate incident in Washington and
a burglary at the office of Ellsberg's psychiatrist. He
has taken a motion to that effect under submission
for further consideration and said he would not
make that decision until he has received all facts in
his probe of the matter.
He is seeking to find out whether the Justice
Department used "tainted evidence" illegally
obtained through the burglary.
The attorneys said yesterday that they will
contend in their appeal that the court was
"compromised" by two meetings with former
presidential adviser John D. Ehrlichman last month.
Byrne has announced in court all details of the
meeting, attempting to set the record straight. He
said that at Ehrlichman's request he visited the
Western White House on April 5 and was
approached about becoming FBI director. Byrne
said he refused to consider the position while the
Pentagon papers trial was going on. Hesaidhehadno
discussion about the trial with Ehrlichman or with
President Nixon, whom he met briefly.
30 Prisoners Flown To Cuba
GUADALAJARA, Mexico — Mexico fulfilled its
bargain with guerrilla kidnapers yesterday by flying
30 freed prisoners safely to Cuba.
But, later, officials said the guerrillas had issued
more demands to be met before they would release
the U.S. consul general, Terrance G. Leonhardy.
"The situation has become extremely
complicated. There are new demands," said Alberto
Orozco Romero, governor of Jalisco state. He did
not specify the demands.
A short time before, Romero had received a note

— apparently from Leonhardy — saying the
diplomat was in good health and unharmed.
Another message, by telephone, was received by
Leonhardy's wife moments after a Cuban Embassy
official announced on television that the freed
prisoners had arrived safely in Havana.
The kidnapers had promised to release
Leonhardy after the television announcement was
made. Romero said Leonhardy's wife quoted the
telephone caller as saying: "You will await
instructions at this telephone. We will give you these
instructions later."
That was the first time the diplomat's wife had
heard anything directly from the kidnapers since her
husband was abducted Friday afternoon.
Leonhardy, 58, was seized near his suburban
home by a revolutionary guerrilla group calling itself
the Armed Revolutionary Forces of the People.
All state and federal police were directed to do
nothing in the case until Leonhardy's safety was
assured.
The 30 prisoners freed were accused of
bombings, bank robberies, shooting and subversion.
They were released from seven jails across Mexico
during the afternoon and night and brought to
Mexico City.
Wounded Knee Pact Announced
WOUNDED KNEE, S.D. — An agreement for
disarmanent and further negotiations to end the
68-day occupation of historic Wounded Knee by
militant Indians was announced yesterday.
The further discussions are to involve
representatives of the White House who will come
to the Pine Ridge Reservation.
Deputy Asst. U.S. Atty. Gen. Richard Hellstern
and American Indian Movement (AIM) attorney
Ramon Roubideaux jointly announced the
agreement and said it is to be effective Wednesday,
beginning at noon PDT.
At that time the government will remove all
armored personnel carriers, while occupants of
Wounded Knee are to lay down their weapons,
ammunition and explosives.
The agreement calls for the Indians to evacuate
their bunkers and assemble at their tepee chapel in
the village to surrender their arms to personnel of
the Community Relations Service (CRS) of the
Justice Department.
The weapons will be processed by government
officials, and legal weapons will be returned to their
owners within 24 hours, Hellstern and Roubideaux
said.
US-USSR Summit Scheduled?
MOSCOW — Henry A. Kissinger and Leonid I.
Brezhnev continued talks yesterday at a country
hideaway and were believed to be arranging a

summit conference next month in the United
States.
For the first time since the presidential
troubleshooter arrived in Moscow on Friday, the
U.S. embassy disclosed he was meeting with
Brezhnev and top officials who would accompany
the Communist party leader to America.
"Dr. Kissinger and aides continue to meet with
Soviet officials," an embassy statement said.
"Participating on the Soviet side, in addition to
General Secretary Brezhnev, are Foreign Minister
Andrei A. Gromyko and the Soviet ambassador to
the U.S., Anatoly F. Dobrynin."
Both sides have kept a tight news blackout on
the talks since Kissinger refused comment on arrival
and was whisked to a forested government
compound along the Volga.
Arab Police Kidnapped, Released
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Guerrillas kidnaped and later
released 11 Lebanese policemen yesterday as Arab
mediators worked to arrange a summit meeting
between Lebanese and Palestinian guerrilla leaders.
The Defense Ministry reported the guerrillas
kidnaped the policemen after attacking a northern
border post with rockets and machine guns. Army
reinforcements moved in and drove off the
Palestinians, the ministry said, and the 11 captives
were turned over unharmed to the regional military
command a short time later.
One of the mediators, Secretary-General
Mahmoud Riad of the Arab League, met with
President Suleiman Franjieh and later described the
situation as "improving." But a dusk-to-dawn
curfew remained in effect, indicating continuing
uneasiness about the hostility that erupted into
bloody clashes last week.
Envoys from Egypt, Syria, Algeria and other
Arab countries also had contacts with guerrilla
leader Yasir Arafat, who withdrew a threat to break
off talks and leave the country.
