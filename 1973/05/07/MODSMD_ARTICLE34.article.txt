# Student Placed On Probation
## 
### 
Junior Lee Christian Spieller was sentenced to one year of summary
probation and fined $250 for grand theft Friday for his use of illegally
acquired requisition forms to obtain merchandise from the University
Stores Department.
Under summary probation, Spieller will not be required to report to a
probation officer, but is liable to be jailed if convicted of another crime.
Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge John T. Racanelli stayed
Spieller's sentence until Friday. Spieller had pleaded guilty to the grand
theft charge at a preliminary hearing April 2, and a judge dismissed three
other counts of theft and one conspiracy charge at that time.
Spieller's alleged accomplice, junior Eric Braun Test, last month
pleaded not guilty to one count of conspiracy and two counts of grand
theft. His pre-trial hearing is scheduled for May 17 before Racanelli and
trial is slated to begin May 30.
