# Dean To Connect Nixon To Watergate Coverup
## 
### Associated Press 
NEW YORK - "Time" and
"Newsweek" magazines said Saturday
night ousted presidential counsel John
W. Dean 111 is prepared to testify that
President Nixon personally
congratulated him for covering up the
administration's involvement in the
break-in and bugging of Democratic
National Committee headquarters at
the Watergate complex.
"Newsweek" also said its
forthcoming issue, which reaches
newstands today, will report that Dean
was told by former senior presidential
adviser John D. Ehrlichman that
Nixon promised executive clemency to
convicted Watergate conspirator E.
Howard Hunt.
A high administration official, who
was not named, denied both stories,
"Newsweek" said. The magazine did
not say whether Dean would tell his

story to a grand jury or a Senate
committee investigating the case.
The magazine said Dean told
investigators he was summoned to the
White House's Oval Office last
September after the announcement of
the initial seven Watergate indictments
and found Nixon and White House
Chief of Staff H.R. "Bob" Haldeman
"all grins."
"Newsweek" quoted Dean as saying
they were pleased by his efforts "to
keep the lid on."
Nixon was quoted by "Newsweek"
as having told Dean: "Good job, John.
Bob told me what a great job you've
been doing."
"Time" said the meeting was
among Nixon, Dean and
domestic-affairs adviser Ehrlichman
and that Nixon said: "John here tells
me you've been doing fine work."
Neither magazine identified its
source.
Meanwhile, "Time" yesterday said
that FBI wiretaps on reporters'
telephones were ordered by President
Nixon early in 1969 and were stolen
from the late FBI Director J. Edgar
Hoover's office after Hoover used
them to "blackmail" the
administration.
"Time" said it learned the Nixon
administration's "willingness to spy,
snoop and wiretap" dates back at least
to the President's order in 1969 to tap
the phones of reporters in an effort to
find out how newsmen were learning
of military policy discussions.
The magazine said it will report in
this week's issue that Nixon asked
Hoover to tap the phones of two New
York Times reporters and four of
his own White House aides.
But Hoover demanded and got
written authorization from the
attorney general at the time, John
Mitchell, before he would proceed
with the tap, it said.
"Time" said the taps continued
through much of 1970 and 1971 but

produced little information, although
two government employees were
transferred as a result.
In 1971, "Time" said, the
administration decided to pressure the
"irascible" Hoover out of his post,
with Richard G. Kleindienst, then
Mitchell's deputy, publicly suggesting
that Congress investigate the FBI.
"Angered, Hoover telephoned
Kleindienst and threatened to reveal
those embarrassing taps," "Time" said.
"No further move against Hoover was
made ..."
In spring 1971, "Time" said,
Hoover discovered all his records of
the reporters' wiretaps had
disappeared and ordered an
investigation.
"Time" said when W. Mark Felt,
now the FBl's No. 2 man, asked Asst.
Atty. Gen. Robert C. Mardian who
had taken the documents, Mardian
told Felt: "Ask the President. Or ask
Mitchell."
Dean has been named in published
reports as a participant in both the
planning of the bugging of the
Democratic headquarters in
Washington as well as the subsequent
coverup attempt. Haldemari has been
named by various sources as being
involved in the coverup attempt.
"Newsweek" said the clemency
promise came last December when a
lawyer for Hunt sent a message to
former White House counsel Charles
Colson that steps had to be taken to
prevent a long jail sentence for Hunt.
The message was relayed to Dean and
Ehrlichman, the magazine said.
According to Dean, "Newsweek"
said, Ehrlichman took the message to
Nixon in the Oval Office and came out
with what he said was the President's
promise of executive clemency for
Hunt.
Dean said Ehrlichman told Colson
to inform Hunt's lawyer that
"everything is okay" but not to be
"too specific."
