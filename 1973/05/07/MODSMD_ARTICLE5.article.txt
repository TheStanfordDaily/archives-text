# Candid Outbursts From Buckley Highlighted Reception Last Week
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
While President Nixon intoned the
hackneyed phrase "Two wrongs don't
make a right" during his speech to the
nation last Monday night, William F.
Buckley raised his arms in mock
horror, exclaiming, "No, no, don't say
it."
This was one of many candid
outbursts from the Editor of the
"National Review" at a Faculty Club
reception before his speech in
Memorial Church that evening.
Although Buckley conversed
knowledgeably with the 30 guests on
topics ranging from harpsichords to
public television, the discussion was
dominated by politics. At Buckley's
request, a television was brought in
and dinner was delayed for 20 minutes
while everyone watched Nixon's
speech.
Buckley alternately chose to listen
intently, pour from a bottle of wine he
had brought to the reception, take
notes, and make table conversation.
Through all this, he managed to glean
the content of the President's speech
and commented at length in informal
remarks afterwards.
"I think he [Nixon] did not know
about it [the Watergate break-in and
subsequent cover-up]," Buckley
asserted. When asked how this was
possible when his top two advisors,
H.R. Haldeman and John Erlichman,
were heavily involved, Buckley replied,
"There are lots of things you don't tell
the king."
'Overly Optimistic'
When asked if he thought the
speech was effective, Buckley
responded, "No, I don't think so —
but then again, I am always overly
optimistic."
It is precisely this turn of phrase
that enhances Buckley's attractiveness.
Groups of five and six people
constantly surrounded Buckley at the
reception, slowly backing him into a
corner of the Faculty Club's inner
courtyard. When someone would turn
away from the select circle his place
would bo filled instantly.
Buckley was not intimidated by all
this, but more importantly managed
not to intimidate anyone else with a
thought too lofty or an
undecipherable word. He proved
equally at ease engaging in polemics
with Eugene Genovese, history
professor at Rochester University, and
discussing airline breakfasts.
in one short burst, Buckley
entertained the subjects of newspaper

circulation and harpsichord building
on levels that a student editor and a
San Jose State music professor could
deal with.
In all these conversations, however,
Buckley did not turn as many flowery
phrases as one would expect. The
element of drama and showmanship
was not present, leading one to
wonder if Buckley had mellowed since
the last "Firing Line" show he had
done. All these elements were to come
out later when Buckley strode to the
podium in the Memorial Church.
There would be no devastatingly
witty phrases, stammering, playing
with pencils, or tilting the head back
dramatically while offstage. The
thought of these things and a chance
to talk to the Bill Buckley drove the
Faculty Club crowd to gather around
him while multi-millionaire David
Packard chatted quietly with a few
friends in another corner.
Remembered Names
In this semi-private atmosphere,
Buckley conversed simply,

knowledgeably,and without drama. He
even remembered names. There was
one Buckley trait that could not be
disguised, however. He showed a
willingness to dispense advice on a
variety of subjects, especially
Watergate.
The master of drama commented
that, "he [Nixon] robbed himself of
drama in the speech by announcing
the resignations in the morning.
"If he had taken control of the
investigation he could have instilled
the public's confidence in him .. .
"There just wasn't enough
mortification in the speech."
While the guests eagerly prodded
him for more statements, Buckley
managed to do a good deal of
listening, showing interest in the ideas
and activities of others.
Buckley would soon meet his
public in Mem Chu, shift gears for a
late cocktail party, finally reach an
airport hotel by midnight so he could
jet to St. Louis at 7 a.m. to do it all
again.
