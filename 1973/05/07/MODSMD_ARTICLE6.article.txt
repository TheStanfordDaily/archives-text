# The 						'Education' Tax
## On Soviet Jews 
### 
Stephen Karon

In their first match since the hotly contested Olympic
championship game in Munich, the U.S. basketball team defeated the
Soviet team before 16,500 at the Forum in Los Angeles. Outside the
arena, 200 peaceful demonstrators protested the "education tax"
currently required of persons wishing to leave the Soviet Union.
The requirement, officially enunciated in August 1972, stipulates
that State education expenditures be reimbursed by individuals
departing for permanent residence abroad. This "education tax,"
ranging from $5,000 to $30,000, has affected mainly Jews, who
comprise the majority seeking visas and are probably the most highly
educated nationality in the Soviet Union.
Each year since 1967, thousands of Jews, as a homeless Soviet
nationality, have applied for exit visas to repatriate to their traditional
homeland, Israel. Applicants have been harassed as "traitors" by
gentile neighbors; many wishing to leave for Israel have been expelled
from schools, dismissed from jobs or imprisoned.
r,Except during the brief reign of Lenin, when anti-Jewish
restrictions were abolished and anti-Semitic behavior punished, the
Twentieth Century has been a trying era for Soviet Jewry. Stalin
seized power in 1924, assumed a position nearly equal to Tsar and
purged the government of Jewish leadership. While restoring various
Russian traditions to ensure support of the masses, he revived the
Tsarist climate of anti-Semitism.
During World War 11, from 1941 onwards, efforts were made to
bolster the loyalty of Jews and other cultural and religious groups.
Chief rabbis were appointed in several cities including Moscow.
Thousands of Jews fought fiercely and died in the Soviet army.
Jews who survived the fighting, optimistic of better treatment,
were horrified by Stalin's renewed post-war persecution. All Jewish
cultural institutions were liquidated by 1948, and a Jewish cultural
revival was smothered. Declaring Jewish citizens "rootless
cosmopolitans" and "bourgeois nationalists," Stalin instituted a
campaign of massive arrests for treason. He incarcerated most of the
Jewish creative intelligentsia, and on August 12, 1952, after a secret
trial, 26 Jewish intellectuals were executed. Throughout the "Black
Years," 1948-52, Soviet Jews in all walks of life were slaughtered or
banished to their deaths in concentration camps.
Stalin's purge peaked in January, 1953, when six prominent Jewish
physicians were accused of planning to assassinate Soviet leaders in
the infamous "Doctor's Plot." However, Stalin died the day of the
trial, the doctors were freed and charges dropped. Purported plans for
mass deportation of Jews to remote regions of the Far East died with
the despot, but Soviet persecution persisted.
The Khrushchev regime that followed, though less vehemently, also
desecrated Jewish culture and customs. Bertrand Russell, who
sumpathized with Soviet philosophy, said in 1966: "A comparison
with other Soviet nationalities exposes the basic injustices of their
(Soviet Jewry) situation, for even the smallest nationality groups in
the Soviet Union are given the opportunity to pursue a cultural, social
and political life of their own, denied to Jews."
Religious persecution by the Kosygin-Brezhnev regime is currently
being denounced by U.S. legislators supporting the Jackson
amendment to the Administrations Soviet trade bill. The amendment
would preclude bestowing any trade benefits or credit and investment
guarantees on any country that placed restrictions on emigration. A
month ago, when he formally introducted the amendment in the
Senate, Jackson had gathered the support of a majority of 73 senators
and 260 congressmen.
Those supporting elimination of the "education tax" feel the
USSR has ignored diplomatic pressures and its agreement to honor
thy United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, guaranteeing free
emigration for all. Because the Soviet Union needs American dollars
badly, their economy will be substantially affected by trade
restrictions or product boycotts.
Many groups, including Students to Save Soviet Jewry and the Bay
Area Council for Soviet Jews, are supporting a nationwide boycott of
Pepsico, and its subsidiaries: Frito-Lay, Wilson Sporting Goods and
American Van Lines. The company distributes Pepsi-Cola to be sold in
the Soviet Union, and in return sells Soviet-produced wine, vodka and
brandy.
Protests at cultural exchanges, such as the US-USSR basketball
game, trade restrictions and product boycotts will continue until
human dignity and rights are restored to all Soviet minorities.

Stalin's purge peaked in January, 1953, when six prominent Jewish
physicians were accused of planning to assassinate Soviet leaders in

trial, the doctors were freed and charges dropped. Purported plans for
mass deportation of Jews to remote regions of the Far East died with

Religious persecution by the Kosygin-Brezhnev regime is currently
being denounced by U.S. legislators supporting the Jackson
amendment to the Administrations Soviet trade bill. The amendment
would preclude bestowing any trade benefits or credit and investment
guarantees on any country that placed restrictions on emigration. A
month ago, when he formally introducted the amendment in the
Senate, Jackson had gathered the support of a majority of 73 senators
and 260 congressmen.
Those supporting elimination of the "education tax" feel the
USSR has ignored diplomatic pressures and its agreement to honor
thy United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, guaranteeing free
emigration for all. Because the Soviet Union needs American dollars
badly, their economy will be substantially affected by trade
restrictions or product boycotts.
Many groups, including Students to Save Soviet Jewry and the Bay

In their first match since the hotly contested Olympic
championship game in Munich, the U.S. basketball team defeated the
Soviet team before 16,500 at the Forum in Los Angeles. Outside the
arena, 200 peaceful demonstrators protested the "education tax"
currently required of persons wishing to leave the Soviet Union.
The requirement, officially enunciated in August 1972, stipulates
that State education expenditures be reimbursed by individuals
departing for permanent residence abroad. This "education tax,"
ranging from $5,000 to $30,000, has affected mainly Jews, who
comprise the majority seeking visas and are probably the most highly
educated nationality in the Soviet Union.
Each year since 1967, thousands of Jews, as a homeless Soviet
nationality, have applied for exit visas to repatriate to their traditional
homeland, Israel. Applicants have been harassed as "traitors" by
gentile neighbors; many wishing to leave for Israel have been expelled
from schools, dismissed from jobs or imprisoned.
r,Except during the brief reign of Lenin, when anti-Jewish
restrictions were abolished and anti-Semitic behavior punished, the
Twentieth Century has been a trying era for Soviet Jewry. Stalin
seized power in 1924, assumed a position nearly equal to Tsar and
purged the government of Jewish leadership. While restoring various
Russian traditions to ensure support of the masses, he revived the
Tsarist climate of anti-Semitism.
During World War 11, from 1941 onwards, efforts were made to
bolster the loyalty of Jews and other cultural and religious groups.
Chief rabbis were appointed in several cities including Moscow.
Thousands of Jews fought fiercely and died in the Soviet army.
Jews who survived the fighting, optimistic of better treatment,
were horrified by Stalin's renewed post-war persecution. All Jewish
cultural institutions were liquidated by 1948, and a Jewish cultural
revival was smothered. Declaring Jewish citizens "rootless
cosmopolitans" and "bourgeois nationalists," Stalin instituted a
campaign of massive arrests for treason. He incarcerated most of the
Jewish creative intelligentsia, and on August 12, 1952, after a secret
trial, 26 Jewish intellectuals were executed. Throughout the "Black
Years," 1948-52, Soviet Jews in all walks of life were slaughtered or
banished to their deaths in concentration camps.
