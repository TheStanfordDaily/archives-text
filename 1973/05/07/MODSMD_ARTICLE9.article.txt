# Palo Alto Council Race
## A 						Challenge From The Radical Slate 
### 
Bradley Dovcden

On Tuesday, May 8, Palo Alto
votes for six City Council
members. Two-thirds of the City's
seats of power are up for grabs. In
the past, Palo Alto has been
controlled by the friends of the
developers, represented by the PA
'73 slate of candidates. But since
the last election in 1971, the
liberal residentialists of the A.B.C.
slate have held the Council
majority. Now a new slate is
challenging both the developers'
and residentialists'slates; it is the
Palo Alto Community Coalition.
P.A.C.C. consists of candidates
backed by four community
organizations: the Tenants' Union
(John Philo), the Women's
Coalition (Carol Peterson),
Venceremos (Jeff Youdelman),
and the Peace Union (Doug
Mattern). These organizations are
the most active left-wing groups in
Palo Alto.
They and their candidates
agree on the source of Palo Alto's
problems. The development of
Palo Alto, the Peninsula, and in
fact the whole Bay Area has been
geared to facilitate the expansion
of American trade and investment
throughout the Pacific Basin, as
well as the military defense of
these business interests. The
Peninsula's rapid war-related
development has left serious social
problems in its wake.
Foremost among these is the
housing crisis. Construction of
housing, particularly for
low-income families, has lagged
far behind growth in employment
on the Peninsula in recent years.
Much of what low-income housing

there was in Palo Alto has been
demolished to make way for new
plants, banks, office buildings,
middle and upper-income
apartments, and freeways leading
to the industrial areas.
The rising property assessments
this development has produced
have made it difficult for small
homeowners to remain in Palo
Alto. Rising rents, caused also by
landlords' taking advantage of
people's need for housing
reasonably close to where they
work, is slowly but surely
squeezing out Palo Alto's poor
and working people, particularly
people of color.
Child care is another major
problem. Thousands of women
have been drawn into low-paying
jobs in the Peninsula electronics
industry, but neither business nor
City governments have provided
adequate child care for these
women who generate corporate
profits and City tax revenues. Palo
Alto (actually the School District)
runs only one center serving some
100 children.
Other pressing problems in our
community—inadequate health
care, services for the elderly,
transportation—also continue to
go largely unanswered.
The problem is not lack of
funds. The Palo Alto City Budget
is enormous. Over nine million
dollars flows each year into the

City's coffers just from the firms
and businesses located in the
Stanford Industrial Park and the
Stanford Shopping Center. But
this money is used for the niceties
benefitting the well-to-do instead
of for the necessities of life of
those who are in need. The money
is used for widening of streets and
lighting of the Industrial Park and
for the flourishes in the best
neighborhoods of Palo Alto.
And the A.B.C. slate represents
the present power in Palo Alto.
The P.A.C.C. groups are angered
by the lack of follow through on
A.B.C.'s progressive slogans of
1971 saying they would solve Palo
Alto's problems. A.B.C. said they
were against war industry and
overdevelopment and that they
were for ooen space, tenants'
rights, child care, and low-income
housing. But the only thing that
they have done on these issues is
to preserve the open space of the
foothills for those rich enough to
build a house on at least ten acres
of land and to stop the very big
commercial and industrial
developments in Palo Alto. They
continue to approve the small
piecemeal overdevelopment.
For example, their citizens'
Housing Advisory Committee
suggested that the ideal sites to be
purchased by the City's housing
land bank for low-and-moderate
income subsidized housing were
the land of the old Harker School

and Palo Alto Military Academy
and the site of the Christian
Center of Loma Verde and
Middlefield. But the Council
approved, instead, the
construction of housing units that
sold for 50,000 dollars and up on
both sites. P.A.C.C. is angered by
this sign that the liberal Council
members are interested only in
keeping Palo Alto a place for
those who can afford it while
doing nothing to meet the basic
human needs of the poorer people
who really need the resources of
this rich city.
Once again the A.B.C. slate
(now Passell, Renzel, Seid, Sher,
and the incumbents Comstock
and Seman) is sounding very
progressive in their brief campaign
leaflets. Nevertheless, they are
opposed to rent control for
tenants, restricting further growth
of Palo Alto's war industry,
letting citizens vote on the Bach
Mai Hospital reconstruction, and
constructing more than a token of
low-rent housing. Palo Alto is a
liberal, affluent city. So half of
the liberals will believe the A.B.C.
candidates favor these programs
since they are consistent with
A.B.C. slogans. The other half
really are satisfied with slogans
but want none of their tax money
or their company's tax money
spent on other people's problems.
In response to this hypocrisy,
the Tenants' Union, the Women's
Coalition, Venceremos, and the
Peace Union have produced a
barrage of literature explaining
Palo Alto politics and have
recruitied 200 block workers to
carry this message door-to-door. If
you feel that it's time for a change
in Palo Alto from committees that
study problems to programs that
solve them, then don't vote for
the candidates endorsed by the
Daily; vote for Philo, Peterson,
Youdelman, and Mattern.

Much of what low-income housing

there was in Palo Alto has been
demolished to make way for new
plants, banks, office buildings,
middle and upper-income
apartments, and freeways leading
to the industrial areas.
The rising property assessments
this development has produced
have made it difficult for small
homeowners to remain in Palo
Alto. Rising rents, caused also by
landlords' taking advantage of
people's need for housing
reasonably close to where they
work, is slowly but surely
squeezing out Palo Alto's poor
and working people, particularly
people of color.
Child care is another major
problem. Thousands of women
have been drawn into low-paying
jobs in the Peninsula electronics
industry, but neither business nor
City governments have provided
adequate child care for these
women who generate corporate
profits and City tax revenues. Palo
Alto (actually the School District)
runs only one center serving some
100 children.
Other pressing problems in our
community—inadequate health
care, services for the elderly,
transportation—also continue to
go largely unanswered.
The problem is not lack of
funds. The Palo Alto City Budget
is enormous. Over nine million
dollars flows each year into the

City's coffers just from the firms
and businesses located in the
Stanford Industrial Park and the
Stanford Shopping Center. But
this money is used for the niceties
benefitting the well-to-do instead
of for the necessities of life of
those who are in need. The money
is used for widening of streets and
lighting of the Industrial Park and
for the flourishes in the best
neighborhoods of Palo Alto.
And the A.B.C. slate represents
the present power in Palo Alto.
The P.A.C.C. groups are angered
by the lack of follow through on
A.B.C.'s progressive slogans of
1971 saying they would solve Palo
Alto's problems. A.B.C. said they
were against war industry and
overdevelopment and that they
were for ooen space, tenants'
rights, child care, and low-income
housing. But the only thing that
they have done on these issues is
to preserve the open space of the
foothills for those rich enough to
build a house on at least ten acres
of land and to stop the very big
commercial and industrial
developments in Palo Alto. They
continue to approve the small
piecemeal overdevelopment.
For example, their citizens'
Housing Advisory Committee
suggested that the ideal sites to be
purchased by the City's housing
land bank for low-and-moderate
income subsidized housing were
the land of the old Harker School

and Palo Alto Military Academy
and the site of the Christian
Center of Loma Verde and
Middlefield. But the Council
approved, instead, the
construction of housing units that
sold for 50,000 dollars and up on
both sites. P.A.C.C. is angered by
this sign that the liberal Council
members are interested only in
keeping Palo Alto a place for
those who can afford it while
doing nothing to meet the basic
human needs of the poorer people
who really need the resources of
this rich city.
Once again the A.B.C. slate
(now Passell, Renzel, Seid, Sher,
and the incumbents Comstock
and Seman) is sounding very
progressive in their brief campaign
leaflets. Nevertheless, they are
opposed to rent control for
tenants, restricting further growth
of Palo Alto's war industry,
letting citizens vote on the Bach
Mai Hospital reconstruction, and
constructing more than a token of
low-rent housing. Palo Alto is a
liberal, affluent city. So half of
the liberals will believe the A.B.C.
candidates favor these programs
since they are consistent with
A.B.C. slogans. The other half
really are satisfied with slogans
but want none of their tax money
or their company's tax money
spent on other people's problems.
In response to this hypocrisy,
the Tenants' Union, the Women's
Coalition, Venceremos, and the
Peace Union have produced a
barrage of literature explaining
Palo Alto politics and have
recruitied 200 block workers to
carry this message door-to-door. If
you feel that it's time for a change
in Palo Alto from committees that
study problems to programs that
solve them, then don't vote for
the candidates endorsed by the
Daily; vote for Philo, Peterson,
Youdelman, and Mattern.

slate have held the Council

P.A.C.C. consists of candidates
backed by four community
organizations: the Tenants' Union
(John Philo), the Women's
Coalition (Carol Peterson),
Venceremos (Jeff Youdelman),
and the Peace Union (Doug
Mattern). These organizations are
the most active left-wing groups in
Palo Alto.
They and their candidates
agree on the source of Palo Alto's
problems. The development of
Palo Alto, the Peninsula, and in
fact the whole Bay Area has been
geared to facilitate the expansion
of American trade and investment
throughout the Pacific Basin, as
well as the military defense of
these business interests. The
Peninsula's rapid war-related
development has left serious social
problems in its wake.
Foremost among these is the
housing crisis. Construction of

low-income families, has lagged

lighting of the Industrial Park and
for the flourishes in the best
neighborhoods of Palo Alto.
And the A.B.C. slate represents
the present power in Palo Alto.
The P.A.C.C. groups are angered
by the lack of follow through on
A.B.C.'s progressive slogans of
1971 saying they would solve Palo
Alto's problems. A.B.C. said they
were against war industry and
overdevelopment and that they
were for ooen space, tenants'
rights, child care, and low-income
housing. But the only thing that
they have done on these issues is
to preserve the open space of the
foothills for those rich enough to
build a house on at least ten acres
of land and to stop the very big
commercial and industrial
developments in Palo Alto. They
continue to approve the small
piecemeal overdevelopment.
For example, their citizens'
Housing Advisory Committee
suggested that the ideal sites to be
purchased by the City's housing
land bank for low-and-moderate
income subsidized housing were
the land of the old Harker School

and Palo Alto Military Academy
and the site of the Christian
Center of Loma Verde and
Middlefield. But the Council
approved, instead, the
construction of housing units that
sold for 50,000 dollars and up on
both sites. P.A.C.C. is angered by
this sign that the liberal Council
members are interested only in
keeping Palo Alto a place for
those who can afford it while
doing nothing to meet the basic
human needs of the poorer people
who really need the resources of
this rich city.
Once again the A.B.C. slate
(now Passell, Renzel, Seid, Sher,
and the incumbents Comstock
and Seman) is sounding very
progressive in their brief campaign
leaflets. Nevertheless, they are
opposed to rent control for
tenants, restricting further growth
of Palo Alto's war industry,
letting citizens vote on the Bach
Mai Hospital reconstruction, and
constructing more than a token of
low-rent housing. Palo Alto is a
liberal, affluent city. So half of
the liberals will believe the A.B.C.
candidates favor these programs
since they are consistent with
A.B.C. slogans. The other half
really are satisfied with slogans
but want none of their tax money
or their company's tax money
spent on other people's problems.
In response to this hypocrisy,
the Tenants' Union, the Women's
Coalition, Venceremos, and the
Peace Union have produced a
barrage of literature explaining
Palo Alto politics and have
recruitied 200 block workers to
carry this message door-to-door. If
you feel that it's time for a change
in Palo Alto from committees that
study problems to programs that
solve them, then don't vote for
the candidates endorsed by the
Daily; vote for Philo, Peterson,
Youdelman, and Mattern.

On Tuesday, May 8, Palo Alto
votes for six City Council
members. Two-thirds of the City's
seats of power are up for grabs. In
the past, Palo Alto has been
controlled by the friends of the
developers, represented by the PA
'73 slate of candidates. But since
the last election in 1971, the
liberal residentialists of the A.B.C.
slate have held the Council
majority. Now a new slate is
challenging both the developers'
and residentialists'slates; it is the
Palo Alto Community Coalition.
P.A.C.C. consists of candidates
backed by four community
organizations: the Tenants' Union
(John Philo), the Women's
Coalition (Carol Peterson),
Venceremos (Jeff Youdelman),
and the Peace Union (Doug
Mattern). These organizations are
the most active left-wing groups in
Palo Alto.
They and their candidates
agree on the source of Palo Alto's
problems. The development of
Palo Alto, the Peninsula, and in
fact the whole Bay Area has been
geared to facilitate the expansion
of American trade and investment
throughout the Pacific Basin, as
well as the military defense of
these business interests. The
Peninsula's rapid war-related
development has left serious social
problems in its wake.
Foremost among these is the
housing crisis. Construction of
housing, particularly for
low-income families, has lagged
far behind growth in employment
on the Peninsula in recent years.
Much of what low-income housing

there was in Palo Alto has been
demolished to make way for new
plants, banks, office buildings,
middle and upper-income
apartments, and freeways leading
to the industrial areas.
The rising property assessments
this development has produced
have made it difficult for small
homeowners to remain in Palo
Alto. Rising rents, caused also by
landlords' taking advantage of
people's need for housing
reasonably close to where they
work, is slowly but surely
squeezing out Palo Alto's poor
and working people, particularly
people of color.
Child care is another major
problem. Thousands of women
have been drawn into low-paying
jobs in the Peninsula electronics
industry, but neither business nor
City governments have provided
adequate child care for these
women who generate corporate
profits and City tax revenues. Palo
Alto (actually the School District)
runs only one center serving some
100 children.
Other pressing problems in our
community—inadequate health
care, services for the elderly,
transportation—also continue to
go largely unanswered.
The problem is not lack of
funds. The Palo Alto City Budget
is enormous. Over nine million
dollars flows each year into the

City's coffers just from the firms
and businesses located in the
Stanford Industrial Park and the
Stanford Shopping Center. But
this money is used for the niceties
benefitting the well-to-do instead
of for the necessities of life of
those who are in need. The money
is used for widening of streets and
lighting of the Industrial Park and
for the flourishes in the best
neighborhoods of Palo Alto.
And the A.B.C. slate represents
the present power in Palo Alto.
