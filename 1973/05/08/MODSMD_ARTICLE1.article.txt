# Police To Confiscate Unlicensed Bicycles
## 
### JAMES MURRAY 
All bicycle owners beware! In two
weeks, the bike that was once securely
chained to a tree will be missing.
This is not a threat from a thief but
a police warning concerning the new
bicycle registration ordinances issued
by the Santa Clara County Sheriff.
Next Wednesday, all unregistered
bikes will receive a citation. If the
offending bikes are not licensed within
a week from that date, they will be
impounded.
However, there will be no charge,
and the only stipulation for release is
the immediate registration of the bike.
If not claimed, all bikes will be held
for a 90-day period, after which they
will be repaired at a work farm and
donated to charity.
This might seem to be an overly
stringent enforcement of the law, but
in 1971, 609 bikes, reportedly valued
at $42,788, were stolen. Last year this
number dropped to 528, but their
value rose to $44,065.
A drive to enforce compulsory
licensing of bicycles on campus has
definitely reduced bicycle thefts and
made it easier to return bikes to their
owners, according to Desk Officer

Jack Donals of the Stanford Police
Department. Yet only about 25
percent of the stolen bikes have been
recovered. Those recovered were
found resold in the Los Angeles,
Berkeley, and Santa Cruz areas.
The license, a yellow plastic sticker
with a number, costs a dollar and is
good for five years. Bicycles with
licenses from Palo Alto or other
California communities don't have to
be registered again here.
Beginning June 1, Santa Clara
County will establish a crackdown on
bicycle safety laws. Due to a federal
grant last August, more policemen will
be specifically assigned to bicycle
patrols. Bicyclists will no longer be
allowed to ride on the left side of the
road, with more than one person on a
bike designed for one, or without
reflectors on the rear bumper and foot
pedals.
Donals asserts that bicycle traffic
violations will not be strictly enforced
on campus and that any decision to do
so is up to the Sheriff.
Bikes may be registered at the
Public Safety Department on Serra St.
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from
9 to 11 a.m., and on Tuesday and
Thursday between noon and 3 p.m.


How Many Violations Can You Spot?
Beginning June 1, Santa Clara County Police will begin a crackdown on bicycle safety violations, such as running stop signs, riding on the left side of the street, and
maybe even riding while reading the newspaper. However, Stanford police may not enforce these laws rigorously.

Berkeley, and Santa Cruz areas.
The license, a yellow plastic sticker
with a number, costs a dollar and is
good for five years. Bicycles with
licenses from Palo Alto or other
California communities don't have to
be registered again here.
Beginning June 1, Santa Clara
County will establish a crackdown on
bicycle safety laws. Due to a federal
grant last August, more policemen will
be specifically assigned to bicycle
patrols. Bicyclists will no longer be
allowed to ride on the left side of the
road, with more than one person on a
bike designed for one, or without
reflectors on the rear bumper and foot
pedals.
Donals asserts that bicycle traffic
violations will not be strictly enforced
on campus and that any decision to do
so is up to the Sheriff.
Bikes may be registered at the
Public Safety Department on Serra St.
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from
9 to 11 a.m., and on Tuesday and
Thursday between noon and 3 p.m.


How Many Violations Can You Spot?
Beginning June 1, Santa Clara County Police will begin a crackdown on bicycle safety violations, such as running stop signs, riding on the left side of the street, and
maybe even riding while reading the newspaper. However, Stanford police may not enforce these laws rigorously.
All bicycle owners beware! In two
weeks, the bike that was once securely
chained to a tree will be missing.
This is not a threat from a thief but
a police warning concerning the new
bicycle registration ordinances issued
by the Santa Clara County Sheriff.
Next Wednesday, all unregistered
bikes will receive a citation. If the
offending bikes are not licensed within
a week from that date, they will be
impounded.
However, there will be no charge,
and the only stipulation for release is
the immediate registration of the bike.
If not claimed, all bikes will be held
for a 90-day period, after which they
will be repaired at a work farm and
donated to charity.
This might seem to be an overly
stringent enforcement of the law, but
in 1971, 609 bikes, reportedly valued
at $42,788, were stolen. Last year this
number dropped to 528, but their
value rose to $44,065.
A drive to enforce compulsory
licensing of bicycles on campus has
definitely reduced bicycle thefts and
made it easier to return bikes to their
owners, according to Desk Officer

Jack Donals of the Stanford Police
Department. Yet only about 25
percent of the stolen bikes have been
recovered. Those recovered were
found resold in the Los Angeles,
Berkeley, and Santa Cruz areas.
