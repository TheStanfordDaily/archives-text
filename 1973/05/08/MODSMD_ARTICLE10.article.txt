# Reply To Rothbard
## Are Convention Quotas Unfair? 
### 
iGary Robertt

(Second of two parts)
There is no question that
certain types of quotas will
inevitably lead to injustice. In
addition, certain quotas would be
impossible to administer.
Obviously, Rothbard's
examples in the Daily, (April 27)
of Nazi Germany requiring Jewish
doctors be reduced in number
until they were only three percent
of the physicians in Germany is a
clear example of an unjust quota.
Likewise, his hypothetical of
requiring a convention mix to set
the exact percentage of Aibanians,
Poles, Russians, Italians, Irishmen,
etc., etc., would be obviously
unworkable and unjust. These
examples, however, are extremes

that no one has suggested actually
be done.
Rothbard contends that the
quota system used by the
Democrats in last summer's
convention was obviously evil
since only certain groups (i.e.
blacks, Chicanos, women, young
people, and homosexuals) were
given a quota, while other groups
(i.e. Poles, Albanians, etc.) were
not. First, let me say I never knew
anyone had suggested setting a
quota for homosexuals, especially
since nobody could figure out
what percentage of the population
they constituted. But that aside,
this argument misses the whole
issue.
In any convention, group, or

organization there is usually a
definable set of purposes. If those
purposes are to be met, the proper
representation of people is
essential. A political convention
requires that all segments of the
population with unique political
interests be represented. If they
are not, the output of that
convention will be .biased against
those interests which did not have
any input.
Of course, in a democratic
system, we can't arbitrarily
choose which individuals to allow
to select presidential nominees or
write party platforms. This does
not mean that we can't suggest
guidelines for selecting those
individuals. Since in our nation
each state uses different selection
methods, it would be impossible
to suggest specific procedure.
Consequently, since the
outcome of most processes is
substantially affected by the
process itself, the Democratic
party set down guidelines for the
mix which would emerge from the
selection process. Any delegation
that does not even come close to
the suggested mix, if challenged,
has the burden of proof upon it to
show that the process by which it
was chosen was not unfair or
discriminatory. The "quotas"
were quite flexible and even
extreme deviation from them was
not conclusive of discrimination.
Obvious
The main objection to this
system seems to be that only
certain groups were given quotas.
Why aren't the Irish or the Jews
given a quota?
The answer is obvious. In our
society, there are certain groups
of citizens who are caught in a
circle of problems. They suffer
serious social problems, they
suffer these because of biases
against them, the political process
doesn't cure the problems because
these people (assuming they are
aware . of the nature of the
problems) can not take effective
part in the process due to the
same biases which cause the
problems in the first place.
Millions of fatherless families
are caught in the welfare
syndrome because of laws and
attitudes against women; the

attitudes against blacks and
Chicanos create the obvious
problems that abound in the
ghettos of all our large cities;
young people are forced to fight
and die in wars they oppose
because nobody will listen to
upstarts. These are severe and
unique social problems that will
only be solved by allowing these
people to have access to the
political process despite the biases
which work against them.
Exclusion
In short, when certain groups,
for no reason relevant to political
competence, are kept from
political participation, and that
exclusion creates or perpetuates
serious social ills, those biases
should be minimized and, if
possible, disregarded altogether.
Only blacks, Chicanos, women,
and young people can adequately
represent the unique problems
which confront them. We must
guarantee their participation.
On the other hand, what
problems that Italians suffer are
unqiue to Italians? It seems to me
that geographic quotas are the
most unreasonable, yet we use
them. Isn't the difference between
the black Chicagoan and the white
Chicagoan greater than the
differences between a middle-class
white Chicagoan and a
middle-class white New Yorker?
Why then complain because we
seek both black and white
representation and yet not say a
word when we rigidly set a quota
for New Yorkers and Chicagoans?
It seems apparent that the
unique and historically
long-embedded problems of
blacks, Chicanos, women, and
youth warrant giving them special
consideration. When that
consideration amounts to no more
than requiring convention
delegations which have virtually
no representation of those groups
to show that such was not the
result of discrimination, it is
hardly the first step on the road
to Nazism. I hope the American
people will not be foolishly
persuaded otherwise.

organization there is usually a
definable set of purposes. If those
purposes are to be met, the proper
representation of people is
essential. A political convention
requires that all segments of the
population with unique political
interests be represented. If they
are not, the output of that
convention will be .biased against
those interests which did not have
any input.
Of course, in a democratic
system, we can't arbitrarily
choose which individuals to allow
to select presidential nominees or
write party platforms. This does
not mean that we can't suggest
guidelines for selecting those
individuals. Since in our nation
each state uses different selection
methods, it would be impossible
to suggest specific procedure.
Consequently, since the
outcome of most processes is
substantially affected by the
process itself, the Democratic
party set down guidelines for the
mix which would emerge from the
selection process. Any delegation
that does not even come close to
the suggested mix, if challenged,
has the burden of proof upon it to
show that the process by which it
was chosen was not unfair or
discriminatory. The "quotas"
were quite flexible and even
extreme deviation from them was
not conclusive of discrimination.
Obvious
The main objection to this
system seems to be that only
certain groups were given quotas.
Why aren't the Irish or the Jews
given a quota?
The answer is obvious. In our
society, there are certain groups
of citizens who are caught in a
circle of problems. They suffer
serious social problems, they
suffer these because of biases
against them, the political process
doesn't cure the problems because
these people (assuming they are
aware . of the nature of the
problems) can not take effective
part in the process due to the
same biases which cause the
problems in the first place.
Millions of fatherless families
are caught in the welfare
syndrome because of laws and
attitudes against women; the

attitudes against blacks and
Chicanos create the obvious
problems that abound in the
ghettos of all our large cities;
young people are forced to fight
and die in wars they oppose
because nobody will listen to
upstarts. These are severe and
unique social problems that will
only be solved by allowing these
people to have access to the
political process despite the biases
which work against them.
Exclusion
In short, when certain groups,
for no reason relevant to political
competence, are kept from
political participation, and that
exclusion creates or perpetuates
serious social ills, those biases
should be minimized and, if
possible, disregarded altogether.
Only blacks, Chicanos, women,
and young people can adequately
represent the unique problems
which confront them. We must
guarantee their participation.
On the other hand, what
problems that Italians suffer are
unqiue to Italians? It seems to me
that geographic quotas are the
most unreasonable, yet we use
them. Isn't the difference between
the black Chicagoan and the white
Chicagoan greater than the
differences between a middle-class
white Chicagoan and a
middle-class white New Yorker?
Why then complain because we
seek both black and white
representation and yet not say a
word when we rigidly set a quota
for New Yorkers and Chicagoans?
It seems apparent that the
unique and historically
long-embedded problems of
blacks, Chicanos, women, and
youth warrant giving them special
consideration. When that
consideration amounts to no more
than requiring convention
delegations which have virtually
no representation of those groups
to show that such was not the
result of discrimination, it is
hardly the first step on the road
to Nazism. I hope the American
people will not be foolishly
persuaded otherwise.

There is no question that
certain types of quotas will
inevitably lead to injustice. In
addition, certain quotas would be
impossible to administer.
Obviously, Rothbard's
examples in the Daily, (April 27)
of Nazi Germany requiring Jewish
doctors be reduced in number
until they were only three percent
of the physicians in Germany is a
clear example of an unjust quota.
Likewise, his hypothetical of
requiring a convention mix to set
the exact percentage of Aibanians,
Poles, Russians, Italians, Irishmen,
etc., etc., would be obviously
unworkable and unjust. These
examples, however, are extremes

that no one has suggested actually
be done.
Rothbard contends that the
quota system used by the
Democrats in last summer's
convention was obviously evil
since only certain groups (i.e.
blacks, Chicanos, women, young
people, and homosexuals) were
given a quota, while other groups
(i.e. Poles, Albanians, etc.) were
not. First, let me say I never knew
anyone had suggested setting a
quota for homosexuals, especially
since nobody could figure out
what percentage of the population
they constituted. But that aside,
this argument misses the whole
issue.

The answer is obvious. In our
society, there are certain groups
of citizens who are caught in a
circle of problems. They suffer
serious social problems, they
suffer these because of biases
against them, the political process
doesn't cure the problems because
these people (assuming they are
aware . of the nature of the
problems) can not take effective
part in the process due to the
same biases which cause the
problems in the first place.
Millions of fatherless families
are caught in the welfare
syndrome because of laws and
attitudes against women; the

attitudes against blacks and
Chicanos create the obvious
problems that abound in the
ghettos of all our large cities;
young people are forced to fight
and die in wars they oppose
because nobody will listen to
upstarts. These are severe and
unique social problems that will
only be solved by allowing these
people to have access to the
political process despite the biases
which work against them.
Exclusion
In short, when certain groups,
for no reason relevant to political
competence, are kept from
political participation, and that
exclusion creates or perpetuates
serious social ills, those biases
should be minimized and, if
possible, disregarded altogether.
Only blacks, Chicanos, women,
and young people can adequately
represent the unique problems
which confront them. We must
guarantee their participation.
On the other hand, what
problems that Italians suffer are
unqiue to Italians? It seems to me
that geographic quotas are the
most unreasonable, yet we use
them. Isn't the difference between
the black Chicagoan and the white
Chicagoan greater than the
differences between a middle-class
white Chicagoan and a
middle-class white New Yorker?
Why then complain because we
seek both black and white
representation and yet not say a
word when we rigidly set a quota
for New Yorkers and Chicagoans?
It seems apparent that the
unique and historically
long-embedded problems of
blacks, Chicanos, women, and
youth warrant giving them special
consideration. When that
consideration amounts to no more
than requiring convention
delegations which have virtually
no representation of those groups
to show that such was not the
result of discrimination, it is
hardly the first step on the road
to Nazism. I hope the American
people will not be foolishly
persuaded otherwise.

(Second of two parts)
There is no question that
certain types of quotas will
inevitably lead to injustice. In
addition, certain quotas would be
impossible to administer.
Obviously, Rothbard's
examples in the Daily, (April 27)
of Nazi Germany requiring Jewish
doctors be reduced in number
until they were only three percent
of the physicians in Germany is a
clear example of an unjust quota.
Likewise, his hypothetical of
requiring a convention mix to set
the exact percentage of Aibanians,
Poles, Russians, Italians, Irishmen,
etc., etc., would be obviously
unworkable and unjust. These
examples, however, are extremes

that no one has suggested actually
be done.
Rothbard contends that the
quota system used by the
Democrats in last summer's
convention was obviously evil
since only certain groups (i.e.
blacks, Chicanos, women, young
people, and homosexuals) were
given a quota, while other groups
(i.e. Poles, Albanians, etc.) were
not. First, let me say I never knew
anyone had suggested setting a
quota for homosexuals, especially
since nobody could figure out
what percentage of the population
they constituted. But that aside,
this argument misses the whole
issue.
In any convention, group, or

organization there is usually a
definable set of purposes. If those
purposes are to be met, the proper
representation of people is
essential. A political convention
requires that all segments of the
population with unique political
interests be represented. If they
are not, the output of that
convention will be .biased against
those interests which did not have
any input.
Of course, in a democratic
system, we can't arbitrarily
choose which individuals to allow
to select presidential nominees or
write party platforms. This does
not mean that we can't suggest
guidelines for selecting those
individuals. Since in our nation
each state uses different selection
methods, it would be impossible
to suggest specific procedure.
Consequently, since the
outcome of most processes is
substantially affected by the
process itself, the Democratic
party set down guidelines for the
mix which would emerge from the
selection process. Any delegation
that does not even come close to
the suggested mix, if challenged,
has the burden of proof upon it to
show that the process by which it
was chosen was not unfair or
discriminatory. The "quotas"
were quite flexible and even
extreme deviation from them was
not conclusive of discrimination.
Obvious
The main objection to this
system seems to be that only
certain groups were given quotas.
