# Not Insignificant
## Stripper & Society

The auctioning-off of a woman's body in a sexist society cannot be
justified on the grounds of free choice. The woman whose body was
raffled off at the Phi Delts several weeks ago was not in fact acting on
the basis of free choice. Woman who for economic reasons are forced
into prostitution do not necessarily have the 'freedom' to become
Stanford students, to be well educated or well employed.
The pressures in a society controlled by wealthy white males are
such that a woman hired as a stripper at a Phi Delt party would not
necessarily have had the 'freedom' to engage in a political discussion
at the party. She would not have been listened to; that was not her
'job'. She would not have had the 'freedom' to examine the value
system which has set up exploititive stereotypes for the use of a
woman's body. Most women are not encouraged to examine this value
system so that crimes against women's bodies are justified on the
grounds that women themselves don't seem to mind, since they may
assume that exploitative sexist values are natural.
They are not. Nor is the auctioning off of a stripper's body a minor
or insignificant act of sexism. Last week, a woman was raped and
killed after a beer bust at a fraternity at Chico State University. The
difference between the Phi Delts and the rape-killers of the woman at
Chico is only one of degree.
Fundamental Standard
Through the past year many Stanford students have been
suspended for such violations of the Fundamental Standard as
protesting genocide or racism. Effectively, the value system we are
operating under here is such that the disruption of a class or the
breaking of a window is a crime; condoning prostitution is not. Private
property is considered more important than a woman's body.
Sexism cuts across all class lines. But the Phi Delts stripper
highlights the fact that lower class women are even more abusively
treated than their better-to-do-sisters. The woman hired by the Phi
Delts was brought in from Sunnyvale. Like an imported slave, and
some have tried to excuse the raffle by saying that Stanford women at
least weren't involved. We reject this idea of drawing sanitary lines
around Stanford women. This was not a victimless crime as far as we
are concerned. As it reinforces the idea of manipulation and abuse of
a woman's body, it is a crime against all women.
Prostitution has followed white male dominated capitalist societies
around the world. Its heaviest exploitation falls on lower class and
third world women. The most recent blatant and brutal example of
this has been in Vietnam, where until the arrival of American Gl's
prostitution was a negligible problem. From 1965 on however, the
number of prostitutes grew up to 500,000, one for every GI in
Vietnam. There are those of us who have been suspended from
Stanford for trying to register opposition to the war in Vietnam,
which has given rise to an incredible case of female abuse and
exploitation. To date, the University has taken no action against the
Phi Delts, who have condoned similar abuse and exploitation.
Not Holdouts
It is important to emphasize that the fraternities are not freak
holdouts of an outdated sexism. Stanford as an institution perpetuates
sexism and trains the future managers of a sexist society.
Institutionalized sexism is part of that training. Women students,
workers, even women professors face this. The history department, as
one recent example, will have no women professors as of June.
Margot Drekmeier, a lecturer for 12 years, filed recently for
promotion to assistant professorship. She was told, AFTER 12
YEARS AS A LECTURER, that her situation didn't merit automatic
promotion and that her case would 'have to be looked into.' She has
decided to leave instead, leaving the history department with no
women at all. Here as always, sexism doesn't have to be the law.
Conditioning, social pressures and harassment substitute for the
law at times; sexism is the result all the same. By the same token, the
Phi Delts are the logical result of the 'freedom' Stanford gives wealthy
white males. The murder of the woman at Chico is the result of the
Phi Delts.
Real freedom in this case is not the freedom to 'decide' to sell
one's body. The basic question is the right to assert the necessary
freedom to examine, criticize and reorder a society which has so
ingrained sexism into us that we can justify prostitution on the
grounds of free choice.
