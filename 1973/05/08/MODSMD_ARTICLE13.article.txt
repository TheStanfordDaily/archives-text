Editor:
I am exceedingly disappointed
that the Daily (May 3) did not
endorse Emily Renzel for the two
year seat in the May Bth city
council election. Emily has a
record of directness and
commitment in local politics. Her
understanding of the complicated
and controversial housing issues
and her support of the apartment
licensing ordinance separate her
from her only opponent, Mr.
Clay, who opposes the ordinance,
the purpose of which is to remove
some of the easy ways managers
have discriminated against
minorities in the rental of housing
units. After all, 52 percent of the
apartments surveyed in Palo Alto
discriminate overtly.
Furthermore, Mr. Clay has
been involved with the Housing
Corporation in Palo Alto and is
running on his expertise in
housing, yet has attended less
than 25 percent of its meetings in
the three years he's been on that
committee. He advocates a vote of
the people on housing instead of
exerting the leadership one would
hope a council person would show
to initiate meaningful programs,
providing low and moderate
income housing for the total
community,
Mr. Clay's campaign manager is
also part of the law firm currently
suing the city for zoning the
foothills in open space, not for
development.
I think the Daily should admit
its mistake and endorse Emily
Renzel, a humanist,
conservationist, researcher, and
woman for the two year seat.

I believe that some facts need
to be clarified and emphasized.
1) Until March 31, 1973 I
worked in the research laboratory
of Dr. Robertson located at
Children's Hospital at Stanford. It
is part of the Pediatrics Dept. of
Stanford Medical School.
2) Inasmuch as grant money
was not available, I was paid the
last three months out of a fund
generated in this laboratory by
clinical work.
3) Dr. Schulman in a letter to
me dated Dec. 29,
extending my appointment to
March 31st stated "should
additional funds become available
to Dr. Robertson's laboratory at
Children's Hospital at
Stanford ... your appointment
may of course be extended
further." THESE FUNDS ARE
NOW AVAILABLE.
4) In a reversal of long time
policy, Dr. Schulman reversed this
decision and refuses to continue
my appointment. He stated he
does not want to accept funds
from clinical sources.
5) Faculty working at the
Children's Hospital will continue
to be paid through the University
by funds they generate through
their clinical work.
6) Other employees in the
laboratory will also continue to be
paid through the University
payroll to protect their benefits.
7) When the workers in the
clinic business office were
transfered from the University
payroll to that of Stanford
Hospital, long term employees
could elect to remain on the
University payroll to protect their
benefits. A humane approach!
I suggest that Dr. Schulman
and Dean Rich follow this
example.

from her only opponent, Mr.
Clay, who opposes the ordinance,
the purpose of which is to remove
some of the easy ways managers
have discriminated against
minorities in the rental of housing
units. After all, 52 percent of the
apartments surveyed in Palo Alto
discriminate overtly.
Furthermore, Mr. Clay has
been involved with the Housing
Corporation in Palo Alto and is
running on his expertise in
housing, yet has attended less
than 25 percent of its meetings in
the three years he's been on that
committee. He advocates a vote of
the people on housing instead of
exerting the leadership one would
hope a council person would show
to initiate meaningful programs,
providing low and moderate
income housing for the total
community,
Mr. Clay's campaign manager is
also part of the law firm currently
suing the city for zoning the
foothills in open space, not for
development.
I think the Daily should admit
its mistake and endorse Emily
Renzel, a humanist,
conservationist, researcher, and
woman for the two year seat.

Editor:
I believe that some facts need
to be clarified and emphasized.
1) Until March 31, 1973 I
worked in the research laboratory
of Dr. Robertson located at
Children's Hospital at Stanford. It
is part of the Pediatrics Dept. of
Stanford Medical School.
2) Inasmuch as grant money
was not available, I was paid the
last three months out of a fund
generated in this laboratory by
clinical work.
3) Dr. Schulman in a letter to
me dated Dec. 29,
extending my appointment to
March 31st stated "should
additional funds become available
to Dr. Robertson's laboratory at
Children's Hospital at
Stanford ... your appointment
may of course be extended
further." THESE FUNDS ARE
NOW AVAILABLE.
4) In a reversal of long time
policy, Dr. Schulman reversed this
decision and refuses to continue
my appointment. He stated he
does not want to accept funds
from clinical sources.
5) Faculty working at the
Children's Hospital will continue
to be paid through the University
by funds they generate through
their clinical work.
6) Other employees in the
laboratory will also continue to be
paid through the University
payroll to protect their benefits.
7) When the workers in the
clinic business office were
transfered from the University
payroll to that of Stanford
Hospital, long term employees
could elect to remain on the
University payroll to protect their
benefits. A humane approach!
I suggest that Dr. Schulman
and Dean Rich follow this
example.
