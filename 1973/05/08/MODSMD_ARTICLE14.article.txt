Is there a rock-climbing club in the Stanford area? M.R.M.
The Stanford Alpine Club is a rock-climbing group. According to
secretary Darien Hopkins, anyone is welcome to attend the club's
weekly regular Thursday night meetings at 7:30 in room 271,
Tresidder.
You can find "reams of information" on rock-climbing clubs at the
Sierra Club office at 1175 Emerson in Palo Alto, according to a
worker there.
She mentioned two groups specifically, a "peak-climbing club"and
a "rock-climbing club."
Bill Oldfield is the head of the rock-climbing group (phone
368-6506 in Redwood City). The group practices locally, with trips to
Pinnacles National Monument and Yosemite.
The more advanced peak-climbing club is led by Clarence Aberg
(phone 244-2282 in San Jose). The Sierra Nevada is the favorite
stomping ground for the group, although they practice locally.
"Although the central campus and residences occupy 1500 acres,
and 960 acres on the east and west sides are under commercial lease,
the great bulk of Stanford property is composed of rolling hills,
wooded ridges, open fields, three lakes, six streams and shaded
retreats. " (Stanford Observer, April, 1973.)
Why doesn't somebody prepare a detailed map of the undeveloped
areas of Stanford? Where can one get information on hiking in these
areas? J.P.
The Land Resources office in Encina has all kinds of maps,
according to the receptionist. She said that the "farm lot map" would
probably be the one that would show the undeveloped areas of the
campus. She said that anyone may come in and look at the maps, but
suggested that you call ahead to make sure that someone is in the
office.
You can also get topographical maps of the Stanford area for 75
cents from the Geological Survey office, 345 Middlefield Road, Menlo
Park. Ask for the "Palo Alto TVi map."
You can get information on hiking in the Stanford area from the
Conservation Club. Bruce Wolfe, head of the group, can be contacted
through the ASSU office Monday, Wednesday and Friday, 10 a.m.
until noon.
What are the effects of non-leaded gasoline on cars which burn
ethyl? And are there any special taxes on leaded gas in California?
J.W.
The auto experts say that the engine will "ping like crazy." The
engine may also continue running after it is turned off.
Non-leaded gasoline will not damage 1972 or '73 model cars
because they have been designed to use non-leaded gas. However, if
you have an earlier model car the engine will do bad things if you fill
it with non-leaded gas all the time.
There is no special tax on leaded gas in California.
