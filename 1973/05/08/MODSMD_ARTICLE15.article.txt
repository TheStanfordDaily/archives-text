# Video News Shows At Hoover
## 
### 
The dramatic and fast-moving
history of the U.S. during the past
five years, as captured by
television news cameras, is
available to scholars and students
in a new service from the Hoover
Institution.
Videotapes of evening news
shows from all three networks —
ABC, NBC, and CBS — have been
obtained through the cooperation
of Vanderbilt University's
Television News Archive.
On hand at Hoover Institution
are samples or recent network
news coverage, including the
Attica prison riot, the Pentagon
Papers, the Thomas Eagleton
affair, the Democratic convention
of 1968, the presidential
campaign of 1972, and a
documentary on inflation.
A videotape player, monitor
and sample selections of video

tapes are now in use in the
American Studies Room of the
Lou Henry Hoover Annex,
upstairs in Room 243.
The public is invited to an
open house showing of the tapes
from 10 a.m. to noon and 2 to 4
p.m. on Tuesday, Wednesday and
Thursday, May 15 through 17.
Edward G. Bacciocco Jr.,
curator of the video news archive,
said the institution "felt that a
central archive of the evening
newscasts of ABC, CBS, and NBC
would be extremely useful to
students of current history,
providing information of
immediate concern and visual
detail unavailable in print media,
the traditional scholarly source
material.
'This will provide students of
mass communiation techniques
with an unparalleled set of basic

source documents."
The Vanderbilt TV Archive has
taped all video news broadcasts
since 1968. They are available
through the Hoover Institution on
a scale of hourly rental fees. They
are arranged in chronological
order or they can be prepared to
special order on request.
