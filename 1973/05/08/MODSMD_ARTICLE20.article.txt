## Director Chioles Explores Arrabal's Modern Theater 
### JEFFERY SEGAL 
With man's habitual dread of
the unknown, I set out for the
Nitery last Thursday night to
catch a rehearsal of "The
Architect and the Emperor of
Assyria" by Fernando Arrabal,
one of the most engrossing,
confusing, entertaining, and
perverse plays of the
contemporary theater.
I always enter the Nitery
prepared to be surprised. Design
students who do the Nitery shows
manage each time to transform
that little, black box into an
intriguing scenic design. Upon
entering the theater, I found
myself searching for an opening in
the blackness of hanging curtains,
until finally I emerged into the
central playing area, which
appeared like a lone gas station on
a desert road.
This impression is very
appropriate to the play, which is
set on an island, figuratively
"space ship Earth," in the midst
of who knows where, on which
civilized man, the Emperor, meets
the natural savage, the Architect,
and asks for help as "the only
survivor of the accident" of man's
so-called progress.
Onstage warming up for their
rehearsal were Michael Goldstein
as the Architect and John
Caldwell as the Emperor,
shouting, crawling all over the
stage, and creating the kind of
general insanity that they will
manifest during the play.
Watchful Eye
Keeping a watchful eye on his
actors was director John Chioles.
As professor of drama at Stanford
these last four years, he has
devoted himelf to making
Stanford theater neither academic
nor gratuitously frivolous, but
rather the complex art form
which it truly is.
An advocate of the avant garde
theater, he directed Jean Genet's

"Deathwatch" earlier this y ear,
and just last month, Stanford
audiences were treated to the
premiere of his new translation of
Euripede's "Orestes" in a
production designed to shatter the
incorrect, outmoded, nineteenth
century critical interpretations of
Greek drama which endure like a
bad, winter cold even today.
Very eager to clarify the play,
as far as verbal explication may
serve to describe an art form
whose essence lies in action,
Chioles discussed the meaning of
"Architect and the Emperor."
"Arrabal magnifies the neurosis
of civilization and sees in daily life
a constant panic underlying all
mental and physical activity," he
said. "Reflection on one's own
private past, his history, dreams,
fantasies of his future, are all
manifestations of a reverberating
panic that surfaces in his theater
as visual nightmare."
Myth Depicted
When asked what specific
techniques Arrabal uses to
communicate this, he replied,
"Arrabal depicts the Orestian
myth of incestuous son
responsible for the murder of his
mother through an unavoidable
psychic cruelty, and typifies it to
deal with man's relationship to
the earth mother. However,
Arrabal also grafts a new element,
Christian atonement for sin, onto
the myth, which culminates in a
final terror of cannibalism.
Through a complex series of
metaphors of pervsersion, he
effects symbolic transformations,
modeled greatly after the work of
Carl Jung, that transforms the
Architect into the female imago
(sic) who then devours "her
son's" flesh. Thus the Emperor's
atonement takes the shape of the
mother eating its young."
This, of course, is a very heavy
intellectual extract, boiled down
from weeks of rehearsal and

analysis. To find out what effect
rehearsing this bizarre work has
had on the actors, I questioned
Caldwell and Goldstein. They
began jokingly with a reference to
their performances in "The Zoo
Story" last year at Stanford. Said
Goldstein, "We work well in
violent pieces."
Total Process
"Rehearsing this show has been
a total process," confided
Caldwell. "It's a tremendously
physically and emotionally
demanding show. I work out an

hour a day just to get my body in
shape and my head together.
John has taught me how to
work again. Some shows you just
sort of ride on and let things slide
by. John lets us go at it with what
we feel — allows contributions —
we could do our own thing with
the roles — but then he would
mold them. It was the three of us
working together rather than one
imposing himself on the other
two."
Goldstein added, "It's really
good theater. The audience is
right on top of us, and we hope
they'll be drawn into it. I think
maybe we're trying to touch the
inner sanctum a little."
"It's got ijo logical sense,"
remarked Caldwell. "We aren't
after any specific reaction from
the audience, except perhaps
expecting them to feel as

confused and panicked as the
characters. We just want people to
leave aware that they have felt
something, even if they don't
know just what."
Although the play was written
obviously with men in mind,
director Chioles feels that the
message of the play can be seen in
female terms too. To prove this
there are two casts of "Architect
and the Emperor, one composed
of two men, and the other of two
female drama graduate students,
Ellen Mease and Carol Bunker.

Why do two separate
productions?
Two Psyches
"Arrabal," Chioles explained,
"remains, like most writers,
intimate only with the male
psyche. In our present
understanding of his work at
Stanford, we are also exploring
civilizations panic through the
female psyche; female actors
usurp male characters and
transform the text to make sense
of a world that belongs as much
to the woman as to the man.
In this interpretation Arrabal's
text undergoes fundamental
transvaluation. The experimental
performance is placed alongside
the conventional one in the hope
that one will inform the other."
In a year when the bulk of the
Drama Department's offerings
have been very traditional,

Chiole's "Orestes' translation, his
production of "Deathwatch," and
now "Architect and the Emperor;
have been the most radical. He
stated his reasons for wanting to
produce this type of theater here
at Stanford.
"In the university context we
seldom pay attention to the
movements in the immediate,
contemporary theater; partly
because such theater is shocking,
difficult to accept on many
grounds, and very often difficult
to perform. In the case of Arrabal,
the radical aesthetic of his theater,
although not radical in content,
makes it ncessary for Stanford to
keep up."
Ten performances by the male
cast of "The Architect and the
Emperor of Assyria" will be given
from May 8 through May 12 and
May 15 through May 19 in the
Nitery at 8 p.m.
Six additional midnight
performances with the female cast
are scheduled in the Nitery on
Thursdays through Saturdays,
May 10-12, and 17-19. Tickets are
available at the door only, one
half hour before each
performance. Prices are $1 for
students and $2 for non-students.
