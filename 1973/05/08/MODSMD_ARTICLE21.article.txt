# Pro Musica: Superlative Performance
## 
### DOUG SMITH 
America's most eminent early
music ensemble, the New York
Pro Musica, gave a superlative
concert of late 16th and early
17th century Italian court music
at Mem Aud Sunday afternoon.
This occasion is especially
significant for Stanford, since the
director of the gorup, George
Houle, is an associate professor
here (on leave). In addition, one
of the members, Herb Myers, did
his graduate work here, and the
editions of most of the music the
group performed were done by
Stanford scholars.
During the high renaissance it
was customary at noble courts to
commission and perform musical
works of a theatrical nature
(masques, ballets, etc.) to
celebrate important marriages or
visits. For Sunday's program three
balli (series of instrumental dance
pieces to accompany courtly
ballet) from the Medici court were
interspersed with • intermedii
(intermezzi) from the court of the
Duke of Savoy. The second and
third balli were each preceded by
a Frescobaldi toccata on the
harpsichord. •
The afternoon began with the
only sour notes of the concert,
those issuing from the shawms and
rauschpfeife double-reed
instruments which are virtually
impossible to play in tune.
However, the articulations and
ornamentations on these and the
subsequent dances from Lorenzo
Allegri's balli were always
appropriate, sprightly and in good
taste.

Many times instrument
switches were required between
pieces, and were accomplished
very smoothly. It is a mark of real
professionalism that the flute
players could quickly pick up
recorders or crumhorns, stick
them in their mouths and wheedle
away in perfect tune with each
other. And the samba playing of
Mary Springfels was positively
violent.
Pietro Veccoli's Intermedii per
Adelonda di Frigia (1596) were
originally performed between acts
of a tragi comedy (Adelonda) on
the occasion of a visit to Savoy by
the Cardinal Archduke of Austria.
They featured the Pro Musica's
singers, two sopranos, a
countertenor, tenor and bass, as
well as the full instrumental
forces.
The singing ensemble was
uniformly excellent, even in some
extremely difficult
unaccompanied passages. All five
voices are very fine, expressive
and pleasant to hear, but the
countertenor, Daniel Collins, was
a standout. He is the latest in a
long Pro Musica tradition of
natural or chest countertenors, as
opposed to those (i.e. Alfred
Deller) who sing falsetto. His
voice is lovely, an ethereally high
and light tenor (up to D an octave
above middle C, which brings the
house down when hit once in an
evening at the opera house), and
he phrased and articulated
beautifully.
Early baroque toccatas
generally make me nervous, but
the Frescobaldi pieces performed

by Frederick Renz served as
natural introductions to Allegri's
dance music. All in all the
programming, vocal and
instrumental performances of this
concert were just what one would
expect from one of the world's
foremost early music groups.
Interview
Before and after the concert
this reviewer spoke with the
director and several members of
the ensemble. When asked to
define the purpose of the New
York Pro Musica, George Houle
stated: "To present the music of
the middle ages, renaissance and
early baroque in a way that is as
close to the original as possible."
"It is necessary," he continued,
"to bring scholarly knowledge to
bear upon it, to use copies of

historical instruments and to
recreate the original techniques of
playing them. But the equation
also includes modern audiences.
The circumstances of performance
are different; religious works are
played in concert halls instead of
churches, etc. Thus when we do a
Spanish mass with secular pieces
interspersed between movements
it is an accomodation."
Describing the life of the Pro
Musica artists, Houle summarized:
"Performing and travelling a lot."
Last summer the group was in
South America, there have been
several national tours since then,
and a tour of Europe is planned in
the near future.
Gambist Mary Springfels, a
UCLA English major who joined
the company upon graduation five

years ago, recalled one of the
group's adventures. "We were
carried into the interior of
Argentina, 400 miles into the
wilderness on a train built in
Brighton in 1919. There was dust
everywhere, so thick we could
hardly breathe." The concert
following the ride was a great
success, however,
Stanford audiences will have
two more opportunities to see and
hear the Pro Musica. Tonight
(Tuesday) they will perform
secular and sacred music by
fifteenth century Flemish masters
in Memorial Auditorium. Friday
evening will feature a renaissance
mass by the Spanish composer
Cristobal de Morales, together
with contemporary secular pieces,
in Memorial Church.

a standout. He is the latest in a
long Pro Musica tradition of
natural or chest countertenors, as
opposed to those (i.e. Alfred
Deller) who sing falsetto. His
voice is lovely, an ethereally high
and light tenor (up to D an octave
above middle C, which brings the
house down when hit once in an
evening at the opera house), and
he phrased and articulated
beautifully.
Early baroque toccatas
generally make me nervous, but
the Frescobaldi pieces performed

by Frederick Renz served as
natural introductions to Allegri's
dance music. All in all the
programming, vocal and
instrumental performances of this
concert were just what one would
expect from one of the world's
foremost early music groups.
Interview
Before and after the concert
this reviewer spoke with the
director and several members of
the ensemble. When asked to
define the purpose of the New
York Pro Musica, George Houle
stated: "To present the music of
the middle ages, renaissance and
early baroque in a way that is as
close to the original as possible."
"It is necessary," he continued,
"to bring scholarly knowledge to
bear upon it, to use copies of

historical instruments and to
recreate the original techniques of
playing them. But the equation
also includes modern audiences.
The circumstances of performance
are different; religious works are
played in concert halls instead of
churches, etc. Thus when we do a
Spanish mass with secular pieces
interspersed between movements
it is an accomodation."
Describing the life of the Pro
Musica artists, Houle summarized:
"Performing and travelling a lot."
Last summer the group was in
South America, there have been
several national tours since then,
and a tour of Europe is planned in
the near future.
Gambist Mary Springfels, a
UCLA English major who joined
the company upon graduation five

years ago, recalled one of the
group's adventures. "We were
carried into the interior of
Argentina, 400 miles into the
wilderness on a train built in
Brighton in 1919. There was dust
everywhere, so thick we could
hardly breathe." The concert
following the ride was a great
success, however,
Stanford audiences will have
two more opportunities to see and
hear the Pro Musica. Tonight
(Tuesday) they will perform
secular and sacred music by
fifteenth century Flemish masters
in Memorial Auditorium. Friday
evening will feature a renaissance
mass by the Spanish composer
Cristobal de Morales, together
with contemporary secular pieces,
in Memorial Church.
America's most eminent early
music ensemble, the New York
Pro Musica, gave a superlative
concert of late 16th and early
17th century Italian court music
at Mem Aud Sunday afternoon.
This occasion is especially
significant for Stanford, since the
director of the gorup, George
Houle, is an associate professor
here (on leave). In addition, one
of the members, Herb Myers, did
his graduate work here, and the
editions of most of the music the
group performed were done by
Stanford scholars.
During the high renaissance it
was customary at noble courts to
commission and perform musical
works of a theatrical nature
(masques, ballets, etc.) to
celebrate important marriages or
visits. For Sunday's program three
balli (series of instrumental dance
pieces to accompany courtly
ballet) from the Medici court were
interspersed with • intermedii
(intermezzi) from the court of the
Duke of Savoy. The second and
third balli were each preceded by
a Frescobaldi toccata on the
harpsichord. •
The afternoon began with the
only sour notes of the concert,
those issuing from the shawms and
rauschpfeife double-reed
instruments which are virtually
impossible to play in tune.
However, the articulations and
ornamentations on these and the
subsequent dances from Lorenzo
Allegri's balli were always
appropriate, sprightly and in good
taste.

Many times instrument
switches were required between
pieces, and were accomplished
very smoothly. It is a mark of real
professionalism that the flute
players could quickly pick up
recorders or crumhorns, stick
them in their mouths and wheedle
away in perfect tune with each
other. And the samba playing of
Mary Springfels was positively
violent.
Pietro Veccoli's Intermedii per
Adelonda di Frigia (1596) were
originally performed between acts
of a tragi comedy (Adelonda) on
the occasion of a visit to Savoy by
the Cardinal Archduke of Austria.
They featured the Pro Musica's
singers, two sopranos, a
countertenor, tenor and bass, as
well as the full instrumental
forces.
The singing ensemble was
uniformly excellent, even in some
extremely difficult
unaccompanied passages. All five
voices are very fine, expressive
and pleasant to hear, but the
countertenor, Daniel Collins, was
a standout. He is the latest in a
long Pro Musica tradition of

America's most eminent early
music ensemble, the New York
Pro Musica, gave a superlative
concert of late 16th and early
17th century Italian court music
at Mem Aud Sunday afternoon.
This occasion is especially
significant for Stanford, since the
director of the gorup, George
Houle, is an associate professor
here (on leave). In addition, one
of the members, Herb Myers, did
his graduate work here, and the
editions of most of the music the
group performed were done by
Stanford scholars.
During the high renaissance it
was customary at noble courts to
commission and perform musical
works of a theatrical nature
(masques, ballets, etc.) to
celebrate important marriages or
visits. For Sunday's program three
balli (series of instrumental dance
pieces to accompany courtly
ballet) from the Medici court were
interspersed with • intermedii
(intermezzi) from the court of the
Duke of Savoy. The second and
third balli were each preceded by
a Frescobaldi toccata on the
harpsichord. •
The afternoon began with the
only sour notes of the concert,
those issuing from the shawms and
rauschpfeife double-reed
instruments which are virtually
impossible to play in tune.
However, the articulations and
ornamentations on these and the
subsequent dances from Lorenzo
Allegri's balli were always
appropriate, sprightly and in good
taste.

Many times instrument
switches were required between
pieces, and were accomplished
very smoothly. It is a mark of real
professionalism that the flute
players could quickly pick up
recorders or crumhorns, stick
them in their mouths and wheedle
away in perfect tune with each
other. And the samba playing of
Mary Springfels was positively
violent.
Pietro Veccoli's Intermedii per
Adelonda di Frigia (1596) were
originally performed between acts
of a tragi comedy (Adelonda) on
the occasion of a visit to Savoy by
the Cardinal Archduke of Austria.
They featured the Pro Musica's
singers, two sopranos, a
countertenor, tenor and bass, as
well as the full instrumental
forces.
The singing ensemble was
uniformly excellent, even in some
extremely difficult
unaccompanied passages. All five
voices are very fine, expressive
and pleasant to hear, but the
countertenor, Daniel Collins, was
a standout. He is the latest in a
long Pro Musica tradition of
natural or chest countertenors, as
opposed to those (i.e. Alfred
Deller) who sing falsetto. His
voice is lovely, an ethereally high
and light tenor (up to D an octave
above middle C, which brings the
house down when hit once in an
evening at the opera house), and
he phrased and articulated
beautifully.
Early baroque toccatas
generally make me nervous, but
the Frescobaldi pieces performed

by Frederick Renz served as
natural introductions to Allegri's
dance music. All in all the
programming, vocal and
instrumental performances of this
concert were just what one would
expect from one of the world's
foremost early music groups.
Interview
Before and after the concert
this reviewer spoke with the
director and several members of
the ensemble. When asked to
define the purpose of the New
York Pro Musica, George Houle
stated: "To present the music of
the middle ages, renaissance and
early baroque in a way that is as
close to the original as possible."
"It is necessary," he continued,
"to bring scholarly knowledge to
bear upon it, to use copies of

historical instruments and to
recreate the original techniques of
playing them. But the equation
also includes modern audiences.
The circumstances of performance
are different; religious works are
played in concert halls instead of
churches, etc. Thus when we do a
Spanish mass with secular pieces
interspersed between movements
it is an accomodation."
Describing the life of the Pro
Musica artists, Houle summarized:
"Performing and travelling a lot."
Last summer the group was in
South America, there have been
several national tours since then,
and a tour of Europe is planned in
the near future.
Gambist Mary Springfels, a
UCLA English major who joined
the company upon graduation five

years ago, recalled one of the
group's adventures. "We were
carried into the interior of
Argentina, 400 miles into the
wilderness on a train built in
Brighton in 1919. There was dust
everywhere, so thick we could
hardly breathe." The concert
following the ride was a great
success, however,
Stanford audiences will have
two more opportunities to see and
hear the Pro Musica. Tonight
(Tuesday) they will perform
secular and sacred music by
fifteenth century Flemish masters
in Memorial Auditorium. Friday
evening will feature a renaissance
mass by the Spanish composer
Cristobal de Morales, together
with contemporary secular pieces,
in Memorial Church.
