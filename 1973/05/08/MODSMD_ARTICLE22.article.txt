# Insipid Nostalgia In 'Class Of '44'
## 
### ROBERT SHERWOOD 
CLASS OF '44
Directed by Paul Bogart
Written by Herman Raucher
Written by the same writer and
starring the same three boys,
"Class of '44" hopes to cash in on
the box office success of
"Summer of '42." It offers the
same nostalgic look at the youth
of our parents' generation, but
this time the script fails to provide
any significance for the action in
the film or any meaningful focus
on the characters. Although now
older and more mature than in
"Summer of' 42," Hermie (Gary
Grimes), Oscy (Jerry Houser), and
Benjie (Oliver Conant) succeed
mainly as parodies of their first
roles.
Set in the suburbs of New
York City, the film begins with
the boys' graduation from high
school. Benjie announces his
intention to enlist in the Marines
and conveniently disappears from
the rest of the film. Hermie and
Oscy pass the summer working
and go off to college in
Connecticut in the fall. Hermie
embarks on a relationship with
Julie (Deborah Winters), a rich
but shallow coed, while Oscy is
soon expelled for setting up his
fraternity with a 32-year-old
prostitute he has befriended.
For no apparent reason, the
script calls for Hermie's father to
die of a sudden heart attack,
which is to set off a minor
identity crisis in the boy. Hermie
overcomes his brief remorse in a
bar with Oscy, who has now
become a clerk-typist in the army.
The film ends with Hermie
returning to college and resuming
his romance with Julie.
This hastily assembled plot
lacks any meaningfulness or
interest. Writer Herman Raucher
has succeeded so well in taking
the naivete out of his characters

that the result is a bland drama
that loses much of its intended
humor.
Much attempt has been made
in this film to provide realistic
settings for the action, leading the
director Paul Bogart to search out
old neighborhoods, dilapidated
subway stations and a timeless
college campus. Long dresses,
"Uncle Sam Wants You" posters,
old cars and Julie's bright red
lipstick serve to remind us we are
in the year 1944, something that
would not be very apparent
otherwise. Andrew Laszlo
directed the photography which,
aside from some good tracking
shots at the film's beginning,
features all the usual camera
angles and conventional dialogue
treatments.
This is not to say "Class of
'44" is devoid of humor, for there
are some good moments. Oscy
paces the film with his sarcastic
wit. His fraternity initiation and
participation on the football team
are comic parodies of these
venerable college institutions.
Clearly, Hermie and Oscy have
come a long way since their earlier
days of adolescent virginity. The
process of growing up in wartime
America is the main focus of
"Class of '44." The three boys
feel compelled to do their military
service: Benjie ends up somewhere
in the Pacific as a Marine, Oscy in
the middle of New York City a-
clerk in the army; and Herimc ais>
wants to enlist, but he remains in
school for his parents' sake.
About the only change in
character that occurs in the film is
that Hermie learns to cheat on his
exams, although it is made clea
that he does not need to. Despite
its occasional good moments,
"Class of '44" is an inspid movie
that should bring the nostalgic
chapter of Benjie, Oscy and
Hermie to a close.

"Class of '44" is an inspid movie
that should bring the nostalgic
chapter of Benjie, Oscy and
Hermie to a close.
CLASS OF '44
Directed by Paul Bogart
Written by Herman Raucher
Written by the same writer and
starring the same three boys,
"Class of '44" hopes to cash in on
the box office success of
"Summer of '42." It offers the
same nostalgic look at the youth
of our parents' generation, but
this time the script fails to provide
any significance for the action in
the film or any meaningful focus
on the characters. Although now
older and more mature than in
"Summer of' 42," Hermie (Gary
Grimes), Oscy (Jerry Houser), and
Benjie (Oliver Conant) succeed
mainly as parodies of their first
roles.
Set in the suburbs of New
York City, the film begins with
the boys' graduation from high
school. Benjie announces his
intention to enlist in the Marines
and conveniently disappears from
the rest of the film. Hermie and
Oscy pass the summer working
and go off to college in
Connecticut in the fall. Hermie
embarks on a relationship with
Julie (Deborah Winters), a rich
but shallow coed, while Oscy is
soon expelled for setting up his
fraternity with a 32-year-old
prostitute he has befriended.
For no apparent reason, the
script calls for Hermie's father to
die of a sudden heart attack,
which is to set off a minor
identity crisis in the boy. Hermie
overcomes his brief remorse in a
bar with Oscy, who has now
become a clerk-typist in the army.
The film ends with Hermie
returning to college and resuming
his romance with Julie.
This hastily assembled plot
lacks any meaningfulness or
interest. Writer Herman Raucher
has succeeded so well in taking
the naivete out of his characters

that the result is a bland drama
that loses much of its intended
humor.
Much attempt has been made
in this film to provide realistic
settings for the action, leading the
director Paul Bogart to search out
old neighborhoods, dilapidated
subway stations and a timeless
college campus. Long dresses,
"Uncle Sam Wants You" posters,
old cars and Julie's bright red
lipstick serve to remind us we are
in the year 1944, something that
would not be very apparent
otherwise. Andrew Laszlo
directed the photography which,
aside from some good tracking
shots at the film's beginning,
features all the usual camera
angles and conventional dialogue
treatments.
This is not to say "Class of
'44" is devoid of humor, for there
are some good moments. Oscy
paces the film with his sarcastic
wit. His fraternity initiation and
participation on the football team
are comic parodies of these
venerable college institutions.
Clearly, Hermie and Oscy have
come a long way since their earlier
days of adolescent virginity. The
process of growing up in wartime
America is the main focus of
"Class of '44." The three boys
feel compelled to do their military
service: Benjie ends up somewhere
in the Pacific as a Marine, Oscy in
the middle of New York City a-
clerk in the army; and Herimc ais>
wants to enlist, but he remains in
school for his parents' sake.
About the only change in
character that occurs in the film is
that Hermie learns to cheat on his
exams, although it is made clea
that he does not need to. Despite
its occasional good moments,
"Class of '44" is an inspid movie
that should bring the nostalgic
chapter of Benjie, Oscy and
Hermie to a close.
