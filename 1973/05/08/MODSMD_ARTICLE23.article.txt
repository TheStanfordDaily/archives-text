More Ellsberg Testimony
LOS ANGELES — White House advisor John E.
Ehrlichman authorized "covert activity" in a probe
of Daniel Ellsberg, according to Pentagon papers
trial disclosure yesterday.
It also was revealed that State Department cables
were forged to link President John F. Kennedy to
the assassination of South Vietnamese President
Ngo Dinh Diem.
The disclosures were in testimony given before a
grand jury in Washington, D.C., by former White
House aide Egil Krogh and Watergate conspirator E.
Howard Hunt and released by the papers trial judge.
Krogh said in the grand jury testimony that he
met with President Nixon, who instructed him to
investigate information leaks.
Krogh did not implicate Nixon in a burglary of
the office of a psychiatrist of Ellsberg, but said
Ehrlichman knew of the burglary.
The report of forged cablegrams was made by
Hunt, who said he doctored them at the order of
former White House counsel Charles W. Colson.
Hunt said he forged two State Department cables
on Colson's orders to make it appear that Kennedy
had ordered Diem's assassination.
The judge also released an affidavit by Krogh
saying former FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover was
aware of a White House investigation of Ellsberg and
approved it because of Hoover's close friendship
with Ellsberg's father-in-law.
"One reason for undertaking an independent
investigation centralized among White House staff,"
said Krogh, "was that a close personal relationship
existed between ... Hoover and Louis Marx,
father-in-law of Daniel Ellsberg."
Marx, a millionaire New York toy manufacturer,
is the father of Ellsberg's wife, Patricia. The
Ellsbergs have said that Marx, a political
conservative, refuses to speak to Ellsberg and has
donated no money to his defense.
Krogh said he was told by the FBI "that the
so-called Pentagon papers were in the possession of
the Soviet embassy in Washington, D.C., prior to
their publication by the New York Times newspaper
suggesting an effort to aid and abet an enemy of the
United States through an ally."
Kleindienst Denies Time' Report
WASHINGTON - Atty. Gen. Richard G.
Kleindienst denied yesterday that he had any
knowledge of wiretaps as reported by Time
magazine.
The magazine said it has learned that results of
wiretaps allegedly ordered by President Nixon were
stolen from the FBI after Director J. Edgar Hoover
used them to "blackmail" the White House, which
was pressuring for his removal.

In a letter to Hedley Donovan, editor-in-chief of
Time, Kleindienst said the weekly had written in its
May 14 issue that "Angered, Hoover telephoned
Kleindienst and threatened to reveal these
embarrassing taps."
"Without qualifications of any kind," said
Kleindienst, "I categorically state that no such
telephone conversation took place between me and
Mr. Hoover. I further categorically state that I have
no personal knowledge about such taps."
Time said Nixon had asked the FBI early in 1969
to tap the telephones of two New York Times
reporters and four White House aides in an effort to
plug leaks involving military policy discussions.
Lebanon Fighting Renewed
BEIRUT, Lebanon — A four-day-old cease-fire
between Palestinian guerrillas and the Lebanese
army shattered last night in a barrage of mortar and
tank fire. Tracer bullets lighted the sky over the
capital.
Premier Amin Hafez proclaimed a state of
emergency, declaring that Lebanon's "enemy is
whoever endangers the security of the country, thus
playing into the hands of the Israeli enemy, directly
or indirectly." He did not refer directly to the
guerrillas.
The resumption of fighting shortly before
midnight indicated that at least some guerrillas had
not accepted a formula of coexistence, worked out
earlier in the day by Lebanese government leaders
and A 1 Fatah guerrilla chieftain Yasir Arafat.
Details of the agreement were not disclosed.
The rattle of machine-gun fire and the boom of
105 mm tank cannon could be heard in several areas
around Beirut, while helicopters and spotter planes
circled overhead.
Authorities blacked out the city and the airport,
which was reported under attack, and told citizens
to await instructions.
The state of emergency appeared to be one step
short of martial law. Informants said the army had
assumed control of all internal security and was
empowered to hold anyone without trial. The
parliament was not suspended.
Kidnapped Diplomat Released
GUADALAJARA, Mexico — U.S. Consul General
Terrance G. Leonhardy was released unharmed
Monday night by leftist guerrillas whokidnappedhim
last Friday, a U.S. Embassy official announced.
Fear had arisen that his abductors, who called
themselves members of a leftist guerrilla terror
group, would not keep their part of a deal with the
Mexican government to release him unharmed in
exchange for the freedom of 30 young prisoners
from Mexican jails.
Leonhardy, 58, U.S. consul general in
Guadalajara, was kidnapped about four blocks from
his home Friday. He had communicated by a note,
dated Saturday, saying he was well and had been
promised freedom.
The first demands of the kidnapers, who
identified themselves as members of the
"Revolutionary Armed Forces of the People" —

FRAP — were for the liberation and safe conduct to
Cuba of 30 guerrillas and terrorists in seven Mexican
jails. Most of them were accused of bank robberies,
bombings, shootings and subversion. Some had been
in prison since 1971 without trial.
Teamsters Challenge Phase 3
WASHINGTON — The giant Teamsters Union opens
contract talks tomorrow with the trucking industry,
setting the stage for what the White House regards
as the most critical test of its Phase Three wage
controls.
Informed sources said yesterday the Teamsters
are expected to seek a three-year pact raising pay by
50 cents an hour each year, plus a sizeable boost in
fringe benefits.
The wage demands alone would amount to about
7 percent of current average pay of the 400,000
truck drivers, both local and long haul drivers.
Local drivers, who make up the bulk of the
Teamsters, currently are paid $6 an hour while long
haul drivers, paid by the mile, average about
$18,000 a year, according to industry estimates.
Although pay demands fall within striking
distance of the administration's 5.5 percent wage
guidelines, total cost of the package is far in excess
of the current 6.2 percent total ceiling on wages and
fringes.
Teamsters President Frank E. Fitzsimmons will
formally serve the demands on Trucking Employers,
Inc., representing some 16,000 trucking operations
that do most of the nation's trucking business.
High Court Rules On Jail Voting
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court yesterday
confronted the issue of voting in jail with mixed
results for inmates.
And in a case from Georgia, the high court
buttressed the authority of the U.S. attorney
general in examining state reapportionment plans
for racial impact under the 1965 Voting Rights Act.
Acting summarily in a case from North Carolina,
the justices affirmed a three-judge court that ruled
states have authority to bar convicted felons — in
and out of prison — from the voting booth.
"We think that a state may constitutionally
continue the 'historic exclusion' of felons from the
franchise without regard to whether such exclusion
can pass muster under the equal protection clause,"
read the lower court's decision endorsed by the
justices.
At the same time, the justices agreed to a
full-scale examination of a New York case involving
inmate voting when it involves those serving time
for misdemeanors and those unable to post bond
while awaiting trial.
