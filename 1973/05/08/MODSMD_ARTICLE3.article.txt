# History Hirings Inspire Women's Group Protest

### CHRISTY WISE 
The history department's recent
approval of three male appointments
to faculty positions has raised
questions among the History Women's
Caucus about the adequacy of the
search for applicants.
According to caucus member Sally
Flocks, the Women's Caucus questions
whether the history department
followed requirements that an effort
be made to consider hiring qualified
women for faculty positions.
Since last year a search committee,
comprised of graduates,
undergraduates and faculty members,
has been investigating applicants to fill
teaching positions in American
colonial history, Japanese history and
African history.
At a faculty meeting two weeks
ago, the department approved the
appointment of three men to these
positions.
The History Women's Caucus
subsequently sent a protest letter to
the Dean of Humanities and Sciences
asking him to investigate the search
process carefully.
Appointment Finalized
The position for Japanese history
has been given final approval by the
Board of Trustees. The other two
positions have yet to go through the
approval process. The Dean of
Humanities and Sciences, the Provost,
the president's advisory board and the

Board of Trustees must all consider
appointees.
An open letter from the caucus to
the history department requests "that
you make one year appointments in
African and American history, to be
renewable on a yearly basis, and that
you actively recruit women to
compete for a permanent position in
these fields."
Gordon Craig, history department
chairman, feels that "as far as the
history department is concerned,
we've done our work and we've sent
our papers forward."
Searches 'Legitimate'
He explained, "The searches were
legitimate and thorough. The choices
were made on the talent of the
applicants."
Craig added that although "women
were carefully considered" in two of
the searches, "the best applicant
turned out to be a man."
In the third search, the teaching
position of American Colonial history
was offered to a woman but she
declined the position. The offer then
went to the second person on the list,
who was a man, Craig explained.
Craig also explained that the
searches began before he became
chairman and that there was "some
misunderstanding of the procedures
followed." He said "both sides
understand each other better now than
they did a few weeks ago."

He mentioned that at least one of
the new teaching fellows for next year
will be a woman, and that a visiting
professor from American University,
Jean Jaughin, has already been
appointed to teach French History.
Currently, the department is
searching for a senior American
historian. This, Craig said, "is all that
we are authorized to do at the
moment.
"We are doing our best to
accumulate as many women as we
can ... We are interested, of course, in
getting the University to open up
other positions," Craig said.

the history department requests "that
you make one year appointments in
African and American history, to be
renewable on a yearly basis, and that
you actively recruit women to
compete for a permanent position in
these fields."
Gordon Craig, history department
chairman, feels that "as far as the
history department is concerned,
we've done our work and we've sent
our papers forward."
Searches 'Legitimate'
He explained, "The searches were
legitimate and thorough. The choices
were made on the talent of the
applicants."
Craig added that although "women
were carefully considered" in two of
the searches, "the best applicant
turned out to be a man."
In the third search, the teaching
position of American Colonial history
was offered to a woman but she
declined the position. The offer then
went to the second person on the list,
who was a man, Craig explained.
Craig also explained that the
searches began before he became
chairman and that there was "some
misunderstanding of the procedures
followed." He said "both sides
understand each other better now than
they did a few weeks ago."

He mentioned that at least one of
the new teaching fellows for next year
will be a woman, and that a visiting
professor from American University,
Jean Jaughin, has already been
appointed to teach French History.
Currently, the department is
searching for a senior American
historian. This, Craig said, "is all that
we are authorized to do at the
moment.
"We are doing our best to
accumulate as many women as we
can ... We are interested, of course, in
getting the University to open up
other positions," Craig said.
The history department's recent
approval of three male appointments
to faculty positions has raised
questions among the History Women's
Caucus about the adequacy of the
search for applicants.
According to caucus member Sally
Flocks, the Women's Caucus questions
whether the history department
followed requirements that an effort
be made to consider hiring qualified
women for faculty positions.
Since last year a search committee,
comprised of graduates,
undergraduates and faculty members,
has been investigating applicants to fill
teaching positions in American
colonial history, Japanese history and
African history.
At a faculty meeting two weeks
ago, the department approved the
appointment of three men to these
positions.
The History Women's Caucus
subsequently sent a protest letter to
the Dean of Humanities and Sciences
asking him to investigate the search
process carefully.
Appointment Finalized
The position for Japanese history
has been given final approval by the
Board of Trustees. The other two
positions have yet to go through the
approval process. The Dean of
Humanities and Sciences, the Provost,
the president's advisory board and the

Board of Trustees must all consider
appointees.
An open letter from the caucus to
the history department requests "that
