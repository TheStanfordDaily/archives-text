# O'Grady Slate Plans To 'Deliver' Promises
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Second Of Two Parts
After slightly more than one week
in office, the new ASSU Council of
Presidents — Kevin O'Grady, Beth
Garfield, Charles Ogletree and Jim
Friend — says it is determined to
implement each plank of its campaign
platform.
Co-president Ogletree terms the
proposals of the group's shocking-pink
campaign leaflet "realistic." "But," he
adds, "we don't fool ourselves that it
can all be accomplished by next
April."
Ogletree's immediate priority is
coordinating the Guest-In-Residence
program, which will allow prominent
visitors to the campus to spend several
days living and interacting with
students in University housing,
beginning next falL
The residence program began in
Wilbur Hall ten years ago, but
Ogletree's plans are on a much larger
scale and enlist the aid of Stanford,
University of California at Berkeley,
and San Jose State speakers bureaus in
bringing well-known speakers to the
campus.
Before his election to the Council
of Presidents, Ogletree chaired the

Black Students' Union and served as
editor of The Real News. He views his
current office as that of an organizer,
not a politician. "I'll always be part of
the BSU," he maintains, "but others
will assume its leadership positions. I
will represent them through this
office."
Off-Campus Housing Service
Ogletree also intends to expand the
existing off-campus housing service.
He claims that the housing pool in
Encina Hall operates on a limited basis
and makes no attempt to find new
housing sites to combat housing
discrimination, to contact faculty
members about available rooms for
students in professors' homes, or to
assist the University Housing Office in
determining what kinds of on-campus
housing students want.
"Encina has the resources available
now," Ogletree comments. "We'd like
the service to be available here at the
ASSU." He plans to start working
immediately on the housing service
proposal, and hopes the plan will be in
operation by next fall.
Garfield and Ogletree will begin
interviewing prospective student
members of University committees
this week. "We'd like to get vibrant

students on University committees,"
Garfield explains, "not just students
who will put it on their graduate
records, but students who will talk up
in front of the faculty."
The Council hopes to attract
qualified students to committee
positions through campus-wide
advertising and letters to graduate
students.
O'Grady's Immediate Priorities
O'Grady, a first-year medical
student who chaired the campus
McGovern campaign and co-founded
the Stanford Committee on Political
Education, plans to devote 40 hours
per week to ASSU duties.
This summer he plans to contact
various department chairmen in an
attempt to promote distribution of
lecture outlines in all classes — already
a common practice in the medical
school. "We'll come up with a rational
argument that it is in the interests of
good teaching," he explains.
O'Grady is presently working with
Ogletree to prepare recommendations
for campus judicial reform. The
Council's recommendations will follow
the general outline established in their
campaign literature that guarantees
students' constitutional rights through

increased student representation in the
campus judicial system.
However, Ogletree and O'Grady
agree that their platform statements
"need more body around them,"
before they present the proposals to
the Committee of 15 this Thursday.
Consumer Guide
O'Grady will also spearhead efforts
to publish an ASSU Consumer and
Restaurant Guide. Although a similar
publication met with little success
several years ago, he believes there is a
community demand for a guidebook
that is comprehensive and well done.
The Publications Board has already
negotiated a printing contract for the
ASSU Money Book, thwarting the
slate's campaign plan to finance th
Guide by increasing Money 'Book
profits. O'Grady admits that the
possibility for funding the Consumer
and Restaurant Guide this year is
uncertain.
Although the four-member
presidential ticket became known as
the "O'Grady Slate" during the
campaign, O'Grady maintains that the
group will strive for an equitable
distribution of authority among its
members.
