# O'Grady Slate Plans To 'Deliver' Promises
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Second Of Two Parts
After slightly more than one week
in office, the new ASSU Council of
Presidents — Kevin O'Grady, Beth
Garfield, Charles Ogletree and Jim
Friend — says it is determined to
implement each plank of its campaign
platform.
Co-president Ogletree terms the
proposals of the group's shocking-pink
campaign leaflet "realistic." "But," he
adds, "we don't fool ourselves that it
can all be accomplished by next
April."
Ogletree's immediate priority is
coordinating the Guest-In-Residence
program, which will allow prominent
visitors to the campus to spend several
days living and interacting with
students in University housing,
beginning next falL
The residence program began in
Wilbur Hall ten years ago, but
Ogletree's plans are on a much larger
scale and enlist the aid of Stanford,
University of California at Berkeley,
and San Jose State speakers bureaus in
bringing well-known speakers to the
campus.
Before his election to the Council
of Presidents, Ogletree chaired the

Black Students' Union and served as
editor of The Real News. He views his
current office as that of an organizer,
not a politician. "I'll always be part of
the BSU," he maintains, "but others
will assume its leadership positions. I
will represent them through this
office."
Off-Campus Housing Service
Ogletree also intends to expand the
existing off-campus housing service.
He claims that the housing pool in
Encina Hall operates on a limited basis
and makes no attempt to find new
housing sites to combat housing
discrimination, to contact faculty
members about available rooms for
students in professors' homes, or to
assist the University Housing Office in
determining what kinds of on-campus
housing students want.
"Encina has the resources available
now," Ogletree comments. "We'd like
the service to be available here at the
ASSU." He plans to start working
immediately on the housing service
proposal, and hopes the plan will be in
operation by next fall.
Garfield and Ogletree will begin
interviewing prospective student
members of University committees
this week. "We'd like to get vibrant

students on University committees,"
Garfield explains, "not just students
who will put it on their graduate
records, but students who will talk up
in front of the faculty."
The Council hopes to attract
qualified students to committee
positions through campus-wide
advertising and letters to graduate
students.
O'Grady's Immediate Priorities
O'Grady, a first-year medical
student who chaired the campus
McGovern campaign and co-founded
the Stanford Committee on Political
Education, plans to devote 40 hours
per week to ASSU duties.
This summer he plans to contact
various department chairmen in an
attempt to promote distribution of
lecture outlines in all classes — already
a common practice in the medical
school. "We'll come up with a rational
argument that it is in the interests of
good teaching," he explains.
O'Grady is presently working with
Ogletree to prepare recommendations
for campus judicial reform. The
Council's recommendations will follow
the general outline established in their
campaign literature that guarantees
students' constitutional rights through

increased student representation in the
campus judicial system.
However, Ogletree and O'Grady
agree that their platform statements
"need more body around them,"
before they present the proposals to
the Committee of 15 this Thursday.
Consumer Guide
O'Grady will also spearhead efforts
to publish an ASSU Consumer and
Restaurant Guide. Although a similar
publication met with little success
several years ago, he believes there is a
community demand for a guidebook
that is comprehensive and well done.
The Publications Board has already
negotiated a printing contract for the
ASSU Money Book, thwarting the
slate's campaign plan to finance th
Guide by increasing Money 'Book
profits. O'Grady admits that the
possibility for funding the Consumer
and Restaurant Guide this year is
uncertain.
Although the four-member
presidential ticket became known as
the "O'Grady Slate" during the
campaign, O'Grady maintains that the
group will strive for an equitable
distribution of authority among its
members.
But distributing responsibility
according to the varied interests of the
council members will not necessarily
cause disunity within the group,
O'Grady explains. "The split in the
previous Council was obvious from
day one. We differ in opinion and
style, but we've learned to appreciate
it and handle our differences."
Co-operative Spirit
The other co-presidents are equally
optimistic about the group's ability to
work as a cohesive unit, and base that
view upon the success of their
collective efforts during the recent
campaign.
Friend hopes to continue the
campaign spirit throughout the
Council's term of office. "It's been
great fun, we're having a great time.
We ran with a similar interest — the
ASSU — and we have committments
to each other's interests."
Ogletree also believes an
intra-council split is not likely, because
"each member is sympathetic to the
preferences of the others." Whenever
possible, the group will act only on
unanimous decisions, he says.
One of those consensus decisions
involves changing the "rubber-stamp"
role of the ASSU Senate. Garfield,
who "thought it was a joke" while she
was a senator two years ago, feels that
the energy in the Senate is
misdirected.
"I got a bad taste in my mouth
about the ASSU because of the
Senate," Garfield relates, "We want to
find a new function for the Senate,
but we couldn't think of one."
Redirecting Senate Energy
O'Grady points out the Senate's
legitimate role of overseeing the ASSU
budget, but adds, "It's hard to get
them to do more than that." He
believes the Senate should take an
active role in improving student life by
forming investigative committees.
But senate reform is only part of
what the Council views as its major
priority — promoting student
involvement in the ASSU.
Increase Involvement, Communication
'The only way people are going to
respect the ASSU and not think it's a
joke is to communicate," Garfield
states. Plans for increasing
communication between the ASSU

and its constituency include a weekly
newsletter, frequent contacts with
dorms, improved freshman
orientation, and a booklet explaining
the operation of the ASSU. Garfield
also plans to redecorate the front
entry area of the ASSU offices to
create a lounge atmosphere where
students will feel welcome.
But the Council's proposals all
require money, and each member has
different plans for raising funds.
Garfield predicts a fee assessment for
the Guest-In-Residence program, and
hopes to work for a reallocation of
University funds to provide increased
aid to students.
Fund-Raising Plans
Friend believes soliciting funds will
not pose much of a problem because
"there are pockets of money floating
around," and he hopes to avoid fee
assessments as much as possible.
Ogletree hopes to compile a list of
alumni — "a pool that hasn't been
touched" — and to contact them for
fund-raising on a large scale. O'Grady
maintains that funds for some
programs should be cut back so that
others might receive more support.
O'Grady, Ogletree, and Friend will
remain on campus this summer to lay
groundwork for programs slated to
begin in the fall. While the success of
their proposals depends on many
variables including availability of
funds, University support, and student
involvement, each council member
appears to share O'Grady's belief that
"We can make a good stab at
everything on the platform."
"We're shooting for fall on
everything," claims Friend. But
Garfield voices a more realistic view,
"Maybe at the end of the year we'll
say it was all an impossible thing."
