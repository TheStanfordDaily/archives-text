# Nixon Watergate Involvement Denied
## 
### Associated Press 
WASHINGTON - The White House,
acting on President Nixon's behalf and
using language he approved, denied
that Nixon was involved in any way in
the Watergate affair or its cover-up.
"Any suggestion that the President
was aware of the Watergate operation
is untrue," deputy press secretary

Gerald L. Warren said in Key Biscayne,
Fla., as the President wound up a long
weekend there. "Any suggestion that
the President participated in any
cover-up activities is untrue."
Meanwhile, acting Attorney
General Elliot L. Richardson called a
news conference to announce he will
heed growing demands for an
independent prosecutor once he is
confirmed as attorney general.
He said he will seek approval for
the prosecutor from the Senate
Judiciary Committee and the full
Senate — although such confirmation
is not required.
Warren said Nixon had not talked
with Richardson about such a special
prosecutor, nor had the names of any
potential candidates been relayed to
the President. Richardson said he has
not yet found the right person for the
probe.
The prosecutor, Richardson said,
will report only to him as attorney
general — implying President Nixon
will have no direct hand in the
investigation.
Mitchell Aide Subpoenaed
In another development, a federal
judge ordered a deputy to former
Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell to testify
before the grand jury about a
conversation with Watergate
conspirator G. Gordon Liddy a few
days after the June 17 break-in.

Robert C. Mardian, who followed
Mitchell from the Justice Department
to President Nixon's re-election
committee, claimed his conversation
with Liddy was protected by the
lawyer-client privilege. Mardian had
been assigned by campaign director
Mitchell to investigate the Watergate
affair.
Silence Broken
The White House consistently has
refused in recent weeks to comment
on individual news reports on
Watergate. But it broke its silence in
the wake of news magazine stories that
Nixon personally congratulated ousted
White House Counsel John W. Dean 111
last September for concealing
administration connections to
Watergate.
Time and Newsweek said Dean is
prepared to give such testimony.
Dean reportedly is trying to get
immunity from prosecution in return
for his testimony before the Senate
Select Committee on Watergate, which
is scheduled to begin hearings about
May 15.
Hunt Granted Immunity
The first such immunity was
granted last week by Chief U.S. Dist.
Judge John J. Sirica for E. Howard
Hunt, one of the seven convicted
conspirators in the burglary and
bugging of Democratic Party
headquarters last June 17. The

immunity grant was revealed last
Monday.
It was the second time that Hunt,
who pleaded guilty to the charges, was
given so-called "use immunity." He
and the six other conspirators in the
case received similar grants for their
testimony before a federal grand jury.
In Florida, Warren also denied an
account in the current issue of
Newsweek that Hunt had been
promised executive clemency by John
D. Ehrlichman.
"Any suggestion that the President
ever authorized the offering of
clemency to anyone in this case
is... false," the deputy press
secretary said.
Newsweek reported that after the
December plane crash that killed
Hunt's wife, the Watergate defendant
sent his lawyer to the White House
with the message that "something had
to be done" to prevent a long jail
sentence for Hunt.
"Ehrlichman said 'I'll check,'"
Newsweek reported. "He went in to
see the President. When Ehrlichman
returned, Dean said, he brought with
him what he said was Mr. Nixon's
promise of executive clemency for
Hunt. Ehrlichman allegedly told
Colson [Charles W. Colson,
Ehrlichman's aide] to reassure .. . that
'everything is okay' but not to be 'too
specific.' "
