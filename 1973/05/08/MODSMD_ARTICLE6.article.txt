# Three Slates Vie For Seats
## Palo Alto Voters Elect Council Today 
### ROBERT BACON 
Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 8
p.m. today in the Palo Alto City
Council election which will indicate
the city's direction for the next two
years.
Six Council members will be
elected — one for the two remaining
years of an unexpired term, and five
for full four-year terms.
Running for the two-year term are
Roy L. Clay of the more

business-oriented Palo Alto '73 (PA73)
and Emily M. Renzel of the more
liberal Association for a Balanced
Community (ABC).
Sixteen candidates are in the
at-large race for the five four-year
terms.
Three PA73 Incumbents
They include PA73 choices Anne
R. Witherspoon, Elvia F. Garwood,
John J. Berwald, John V. Beahrs, and
Stanley R. Norton. The latter three are

incumbents.
ABC's endorsees for the four-year
terms are Tom Passell, Mayor Kirke W.
Comstock, Allan Seid, Byron D. Sher,
and Councilwoman Sylvia Seman.
The Palo Alto Community
Coalition, consisting of several radical
organizations, is promoting Jeffrey D.
Youdelman, Douglas Mattern, Carol
Cynthia Peterson, and John S. Philo.
Independents
The other two candidates —
conservative John Dennis Snow and
liberal Bob Cullenbine — ran
independent campaigns.
Control of a Council majority is at
stake. The present Council consists of
five ABC members and four PA73
sympathizers. Three of the ABC
members continue in office for two
more years, and the other two —
Comstock and Seman — are seeking
new terms.
Of the four PA73 supporters
presently on the Council, three —
Beahrs, Berwald and Norton — are
seeking reelection, and the fourth, Dr.
William H. Clark, is retiring.
Majority
If ABC is to maintain a majority on
the Council, the six winners today
must include two ABC members. For
PA73 to take control, that group must
win five of the six seats at stake.
The new Council takes office July
1.
Its first order of business will be
election of a mayor from its
membership. Comstock, who has held
the post for the past two years, has
indicated that he will seek the
mayoralty again should he be
re-elected to the Council today.
Non-White Candidate
If Clay, a black, or Seid, a
Chinese-American, is elected, it is
believed that either would be the first
non-white Council member in the
city's history.

City Clerk Ann Tanner yesterday
declined to predict the voter turnout,
noting that the lowering of the voting
age to 18 since the last municipal
election, two years ago, had made an
unpredictable change in the makeup of
the electorate.
Two years ago, for the Council
election and an advisory referendum
on the Vietnam War, 61.24 percent of
the eligible voters cast ballots.
Tanner reports that 33,236 Palo
Altans are registered to vote in today's
election.
Each voter received by mail a
notice of his polling place.
Campus Not Included
The student and faculty housing
areas on the Stanford campus are not
part of the city; hence campus
residents may not vote in the election.
Ballots from the 38 precincts will
be counted this evening at the Civic
Center, 250 Hamilton Avenue. Results
will be made available there after 8
p.m. Tanner expects final, unofficial
results to be available bv 10:30 p.m.

ABC Victories
Two years ago ABC won three of
the four seats then at stake, electing
Councilmen Alan Henderson and
Richard Rosenbaum and re-electing
Councilwoman Enid Pearson. Their
terms expire in 1975.
The fourth Council member elected
in 1971, Frances Dias, resigned later
that year. When Seman, a defeated
ABC candidate in the 1971 election,
was chosen to fill the vacancy, the
liberal "residentialist" forces had a
Council majority after a decade in the
minority.
This year Seman elected to run for
a full four-year term rather than for
the two remaining years of the term to
which she was appointed.
Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 8
p.m. today in the Palo Alto City

five ABC members and four PA73
sympathizers. Three of the ABC
members continue in office for two
more years, and the other two —
Comstock and Seman — are seeking
new terms.
Of the four PA73 supporters
presently on the Council, three —
Beahrs, Berwald and Norton — are
seeking reelection, and the fourth, Dr.
William H. Clark, is retiring.
Majority
If ABC is to maintain a majority on
the Council, the six winners today
must include two ABC members. For
PA73 to take control, that group must
win five of the six seats at stake.
The new Council takes office July
1.
Its first order of business will be
election of a mayor from its
membership. Comstock, who has held
the post for the past two years, has
indicated that he will seek the
mayoralty again should he be
re-elected to the Council today.
Non-White Candidate
If Clay, a black, or Seid, a
Chinese-American, is elected, it is
believed that either would be the first
non-white Council member in the
city's history.

City Clerk Ann Tanner yesterday
declined to predict the voter turnout,
noting that the lowering of the voting
age to 18 since the last municipal
election, two years ago, had made an
unpredictable change in the makeup of
the electorate.
Two years ago, for the Council
election and an advisory referendum
on the Vietnam War, 61.24 percent of
the eligible voters cast ballots.
Tanner reports that 33,236 Palo
Altans are registered to vote in today's
election.
Each voter received by mail a
notice of his polling place.
Campus Not Included
The student and faculty housing
areas on the Stanford campus are not
part of the city; hence campus
residents may not vote in the election.
Ballots from the 38 precincts will
be counted this evening at the Civic
Center, 250 Hamilton Avenue. Results
will be made available there after 8
p.m. Tanner expects final, unofficial
results to be available bv 10:30 p.m.

ABC Victories
Two years ago ABC won three of
the four seats then at stake, electing
Councilmen Alan Henderson and
Richard Rosenbaum and re-electing
Councilwoman Enid Pearson. Their
terms expire in 1975.
The fourth Council member elected
in 1971, Frances Dias, resigned later
that year. When Seman, a defeated
ABC candidate in the 1971 election,
was chosen to fill the vacancy, the
liberal "residentialist" forces had a
Council majority after a decade in the
minority.
This year Seman elected to run for
a full four-year term rather than for
the two remaining years of the term to
which she was appointed.
Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 8
p.m. today in the Palo Alto City
Council election which will indicate
the city's direction for the next two
years.
Six Council members will be
elected — one for the two remaining
years of an unexpired term, and five
for full four-year terms.
Running for the two-year term are
Roy L. Clay of the more

business-oriented Palo Alto '73 (PA73)
and Emily M. Renzel of the more
liberal Association for a Balanced
Community (ABC).
Sixteen candidates are in the
at-large race for the five four-year
terms.
Three PA73 Incumbents
They include PA73 choices Anne
R. Witherspoon, Elvia F. Garwood,
John J. Berwald, John V. Beahrs, and
Stanley R. Norton. The latter three are

incumbents.
ABC's endorsees for the four-year
terms are Tom Passell, Mayor Kirke W.
Comstock, Allan Seid, Byron D. Sher,
and Councilwoman Sylvia Seman.
The Palo Alto Community
Coalition, consisting of several radical
organizations, is promoting Jeffrey D.
Youdelman, Douglas Mattern, Carol
Cynthia Peterson, and John S. Philo.
Independents
The other two candidates —
conservative John Dennis Snow and
liberal Bob Cullenbine — ran
independent campaigns.
