# Community Hypocrisy
## Phi Delt Issues 
### 
Chris Hocker

The hypocrisy of some elements of the Stanford community never
ceases to amaze me.
I refer specifically to the Phi Delt controversy. A few weeks ago, a
topless dancer was raffled off to a visiting high schooler at a fraternity
party. In the course of the investigation, it developed that the women
in question was not the first such entrepreneur to visit the Stanford
campus. It also came out that the frat had been serving liquor in
apparent violation of state ordinance against that sort of thing.
Hypocrisy Number One: The University announced that the State
of California can take care of its own alcoholic beverage statutes, and
that Stanford would not worry about possible violations occurring in
campus housing.
Investigation Called
This decision was not hard to make, considering the widespread
violations that occur. The University did, however, begin an intensive
investigation of the isolated instance of the raffle. In quantitative
terms, this course of action is comparable to swatting a fly while a
swarm of locusts carries off your house.
It is also a typical Stanford decision, similar in many respects to
the Bruce Franklin firing. Bruce was sacked for inciting riots instead
of what he should have been sacked for: failure to teach competently.
But, since the same complaint could have been made about scores of
other tenured Stanford faculty, the University chose the easy way
out. It is doing the same thing now.
Hypocrisy Number Two: The response of the militant Women's
Lib faction on campus has been that the Phi Delt house indulged in
the lowest form of male chauvinist piggery and should be rousted
from its cozy campus confines, both for reasons of punishment and,
one assumes, as an example to anyone else who regards prostitutes as
other than helpless victims of a vicious, male-dominated society.
The Phi Delt picketers are arguing thusly: that the same
autonomous woman who has the right to control her own body in
matters such as abortion does not have the right to control her body
in matters such as its sale or show. Further, should a woman choose to
display or sell her body, it is not her fault but that of "society,"
meaning the males who viewed or participated in the act.
Scarlet Letter
Perhaps the Phi Delt members should be made to wear a scarlet
"D" (for "Debaser of True Womanhood") on their shirts.
All of this does not mean that I recommend the institution of
prostitution as part of the educational curriculum, or that I support
the Phi Delts, or that I believe that women should be obscene and not
heard.
Nor does it mean that I adopt the "boys will be boys" attitude
toward the Phi Delt raffle, and think the affair should be ignored. I do
wish that the University — and the Libbies — would approach
problems of this kind with some sort of consistency and a display of
discernible principles.
Actually, with regard to the arguments put forth by the picketers, I
take an attitude of "whores will be whores." Less crudely stated, that
means that any voluntary, contractual agreement reached between
two or more legally responsible individuals does not bother me in the
slightest. If someone wishes to sell used chewing gum, and someone
else will buy it, it is certainly none of my business.
Psych Rights
Now, if — as the Libbies are claiming — the Phi Delt raffle
constituted an offensive act which was indeed an invasion of their
psychological rights, then by all means, let the Phi Delts be punished
as severely as justice would demand.
By the same token, let the Women's Lib picketers be punished with
equal severity, for I find many of their actions and arguments
offensive and psychologically disturbing.
In fact, all those people who I find insulting or annoying, or who
debase my ideals and contradict my morality should be banned from
the campus. Hey, yeah, that's a good idea. I think I'll go see the Dean
of Students about it right now.. . .

heard.
Nor does it mean that I adopt the "boys will be boys" attitude
toward the Phi Delt raffle, and think the affair should be ignored. I do
wish that the University — and the Libbies — would approach
problems of this kind with some sort of consistency and a display of
discernible principles.
Actually, with regard to the arguments put forth by the picketers, I
take an attitude of "whores will be whores." Less crudely stated, that
means that any voluntary, contractual agreement reached between
two or more legally responsible individuals does not bother me in the
slightest. If someone wishes to sell used chewing gum, and someone
else will buy it, it is certainly none of my business.
Psych Rights
Now, if — as the Libbies are claiming — the Phi Delt raffle
constituted an offensive act which was indeed an invasion of their
psychological rights, then by all means, let the Phi Delts be punished
as severely as justice would demand.
By the same token, let the Women's Lib picketers be punished with
equal severity, for I find many of their actions and arguments
offensive and psychologically disturbing.
In fact, all those people who I find insulting or annoying, or who
debase my ideals and contradict my morality should be banned from
the campus. Hey, yeah, that's a good idea. I think I'll go see the Dean
of Students about it right now.. . .

The hypocrisy of some elements of the Stanford community never
ceases to amaze me.
I refer specifically to the Phi Delt controversy. A few weeks ago, a
topless dancer was raffled off to a visiting high schooler at a fraternity
party. In the course of the investigation, it developed that the women
in question was not the first such entrepreneur to visit the Stanford
campus. It also came out that the frat had been serving liquor in
apparent violation of state ordinance against that sort of thing.
Hypocrisy Number One: The University announced that the State
of California can take care of its own alcoholic beverage statutes, and
that Stanford would not worry about possible violations occurring in
campus housing.
Investigation Called
This decision was not hard to make, considering the widespread
violations that occur. The University did, however, begin an intensive
investigation of the isolated instance of the raffle. In quantitative
terms, this course of action is comparable to swatting a fly while a
swarm of locusts carries off your house.
It is also a typical Stanford decision, similar in many respects to
the Bruce Franklin firing. Bruce was sacked for inciting riots instead
of what he should have been sacked for: failure to teach competently.
But, since the same complaint could have been made about scores of
other tenured Stanford faculty, the University chose the easy way
out. It is doing the same thing now.
Hypocrisy Number Two: The response of the militant Women's
Lib faction on campus has been that the Phi Delt house indulged in
the lowest form of male chauvinist piggery and should be rousted
from its cozy campus confines, both for reasons of punishment and,
one assumes, as an example to anyone else who regards prostitutes as
other than helpless victims of a vicious, male-dominated society.
The Phi Delt picketers are arguing thusly: that the same
autonomous woman who has the right to control her own body in
matters such as abortion does not have the right to control her body
in matters such as its sale or show. Further, should a woman choose to
display or sell her body, it is not her fault but that of "society,"
meaning the males who viewed or participated in the act.
Scarlet Letter
Perhaps the Phi Delt members should be made to wear a scarlet
"D" (for "Debaser of True Womanhood") on their shirts.
All of this does not mean that I recommend the institution of
prostitution as part of the educational curriculum, or that I support
the Phi Delts, or that I believe that women should be obscene and not
heard.
Nor does it mean that I adopt the "boys will be boys" attitude
toward the Phi Delt raffle, and think the affair should be ignored. I do
