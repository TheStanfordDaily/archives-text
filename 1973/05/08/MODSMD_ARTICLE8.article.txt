# Overseas Study Urged
## Premed Attention 
### 
Stillwell, Mosher

Premedical students are
increasingly becoming the victims
of misinformation concerning
curriculum, qualifying standards
for medical admission, predictions
for success of Stanford applicants
(note, Academic Information
Center: 85 percent were not
accepted in 1971-72), and now
unfounded warnings are heard
about attending an overseas
campus.
The last Observer noted in
paraphrasing the AlC's
Pre-Professional Handbook that
there are significant disadvantages
associated with a period overseas.
This is simply not true, and will
be supported by pre-meds who
have gone overseas. There is no
real obstacle if students have
planned ahead, re-scheduling one
quarter of a science sequences or
preparing to take the MCAT at a
foreign study center.
In my experience, at least 50
percent of over 100 medical
school applicants per year have
spent six months overseas, and a
good proportion have taken the
MCAT there. The best quarters
are Spring-Summer, or
Winter-Spring. The Premedical
Handbook is published by the
Stanford Premedical Society; it i
a realistic view of premed, and it
documents overseas planning.
Some unfortunate
consequences of this ungrounded
warning is to force the student to
believe part of the following;
(a) that he must cram his
premed courses into the earliest,
shortest period of time,
(b) that he cannot break course
sequences,
(c) that he may be obliged to
take science in summer school,
(d) that three sciences must be
combined, perhaps just prior to,
or following overseas,
(e) that the MCAT must never,
never be taken overseas.
All of the above are patently
false.
There are three benefits to
attending an overseas campus: the
unique advantages the experience
itself offers; recommendations
may be obtainable from teachers

at the centers; admissions
committees everywhere fully
appreciate and value the merits of
overseas attendance.
The suggestion has been made
to give a limited science offering.
This seems impractical and
perhaps naive. It would destroy
the flavor of the cultural
experience and dilute the
social-humanities emphasis. It
would transfer pre-med anxiety to
the group, and it would separate
science offerings from many
department facilities, including
labs, libraries, and the
participation in courses by
teaching assistants.
The fall-off of overseas
application probably has nothing
to do with the temporary premed
rage. Students and staff who
believe foreign campuses are
incompatible with medical
preparation are not acting with
knowledge and good judgment.
*****
A major portion of the senior
premedical students with whom I
talk have been to an overseas
campus. With only minor
exceptions they have expressed
the opinion that the overseas
campus experience was rewarding,
valuable and a decidedly positive
factor in their university
educational experience. Those
with whom I have talked after
their medical school interviews
have never indicated that the
medical schools had a negative
reaction to this experience, in fact
to the contrary.
The Chemistry curricula or
both Biology and Chemistry
majors has been planned so that a
student can attend a foreign
campus, preferably in the Spring
and Summer quarters of the
second (or third) year.
I do not believe that a foreign
campus is the place to take regular
core sciences courses, especially
those with accompanying
laboratories.
