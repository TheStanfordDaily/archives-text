# CIA Linked To File Theft
## 
### Associated Press 
LOS ANGELES — The Pentagon
papers trial jury was dismissed until
Monday amid further revelations
yesterday about Watergate and White
House links to the case.
Government documents released by
the Pentagon papers trial judge
confirmed reports that the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) provided
disguises and a secret camera to
convicted Watergate conspirator E.
Howard Hunt for a break-in at the
office of Ellsberg's psychiatrist.
The documents — undated,
unsigned and bearing no letterhead —
were given to the judge by the
government. They said that Gen.
Robert E. Cushman, former deputy
director of the CIA and now
commandant of the Marine Corps,
approved the initial request for help
by Hunt in July 1971.
The documents also revealed that
Cushman called "the appropriate
individual" in the White House when
the CIA eventually cut off its aid to
Hunt.
Too Much
"General Cushman called the
appropriate individual in the White
House with these concerns and
explained that the agency could not
meet the kinds of requests Mr. Hunt
was levying," the report said.

"The White House official stated he
would restrain Mr. Hunt."
The memorandum on CIA
involvement says that Hunt was given,
among other disguises, a wig, glasses
and a speech alteration device. It said
the CIA also gave a Hunt "associate" a
disguise and developed film for Hunt
from a special CIA camera he had been
given.
The report says that Hunt's
requests were finally turned down
only after they began to pile up in
August. Then, it said, an unidentified
CIA official intervened and urged
Cushman to stop the aid because it
was involving the CIA in "domestic
clandestine operations."
Not Authorized
The intelligence organization is not
authorized to become involved in
domestic affairs.
The report on the CIA activities
was released to U.S. District Court
Judge Matt Byrne in his continuing
probe of Watergate and White House
interference in the Pentagon papers
investigation.
Byrne made the report public after
telling jurors earlier that the
government would call no more
rebuttal witnesses and that the defense
had no further evidence to present.
In dismissing the jurors, Byrne
admonished them to avoid news about

the Pentagon papers case. The jury has
not been sequestered during the
four-month-old trial.
Later in the day, Byrne said he
would decide tomorrow whether to
dismiss charges because of White
House and Watergate involvement in
the prosecution of Ellsberg.

ELECTION RESULTS — About 250 people crowded the Palo Alto City Council chambers last night to see results of the
Council election, which were projected on a large screen above the dias at which the winners will sit beginning July 1.
LOS ANGELES — The Pentagon
papers trial jury was dismissed until
Monday amid further revelations
yesterday about Watergate and White
House links to the case.
Government documents released by
the Pentagon papers trial judge
confirmed reports that the Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) provided
disguises and a secret camera to
convicted Watergate conspirator E.
Howard Hunt for a break-in at the
office of Ellsberg's psychiatrist.
The documents — undated,
unsigned and bearing no letterhead —
were given to the judge by the
government. They said that Gen.
Robert E. Cushman, former deputy
director of the CIA and now
commandant of the Marine Corps,
approved the initial request for help
by Hunt in July 1971.
The documents also revealed that
Cushman called "the appropriate
individual" in the White House when
the CIA eventually cut off its aid to
Hunt.
Too Much
"General Cushman called the
appropriate individual in the White
House with these concerns and
explained that the agency could not
meet the kinds of requests Mr. Hunt
was levying," the report said.

"The White House official stated he
would restrain Mr. Hunt."
The memorandum on CIA
involvement says that Hunt was given,
among other disguises, a wig, glasses
and a speech alteration device. It said
the CIA also gave a Hunt "associate" a
disguise and developed film for Hunt
from a special CIA camera he had been
given.
The report says that Hunt's
requests were finally turned down
only after they began to pile up in
August. Then, it said, an unidentified
CIA official intervened and urged
Cushman to stop the aid because it
was involving the CIA in "domestic
clandestine operations."
Not Authorized
The intelligence organization is not
authorized to become involved in
domestic affairs.
The report on the CIA activities
was released to U.S. District Court
Judge Matt Byrne in his continuing
probe of Watergate and White House
interference in the Pentagon papers
investigation.
Byrne made the report public after
telling jurors earlier that the
government would call no more
rebuttal witnesses and that the defense
had no further evidence to present.
In dismissing the jurors, Byrne
admonished them to avoid news about

the Pentagon papers case. The jury has
not been sequestered during the
four-month-old trial.
Later in the day, Byrne said he
would decide tomorrow whether to
dismiss charges because of White
House and Watergate involvement in
the prosecution of Ellsberg.
