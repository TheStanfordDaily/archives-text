# A 						Yakking Way Of Knowledge
## Leaching Of Don Juan

Arthur Sandusky

I had come to San Place
Secreto in the summer of '4i
looking for herbs to help me
finish my thesis in
psychophantology at UPI (class of
'44). Sometimes you just gotta git
away. After drinking cerveza in
the taverna all day waiting for cho
time, I felt a strange pressure
sensation in my lower abdomen. I
commented on this to my friend
Biff, who pointed me oddly to the
urinal. As I entered, I saw for the
first time the old dusty man who
was to be the source of so many
future riches. I was most amazed
by the fact that his eyes were
closed tightly, frozen like the
pistons on an old mexican bus. The
thing that second most amazed
me about the old one was the

uncanny way he was talking about
emptiness and pointing to his
loins. I felt extremely puzzled and
stupid.
"Why is it you talk of nothing
when there are scientific journals
to read?" I asked him.
"What if one cannot see?" he
roared with laughter.
Questioning
I wanted to ask him if he
would teach me to see, but I was
afraid to annoy him with my
incessant questioning. He turned
abruptly and walked out,
terminating the lesson in his
dramatic way.
Back in the taverna a chill
spread over my body. Could it
simply have been the air
conditioning? I don't know. There
is always a ready explanation for
these dark experiences if one is
gullable enough.
The room seemed to grow
darker and then a bright hazy
green light appeared to be emitted
by the image of a nude female
body dancing in the center of the
room. Strange rhythms of music
sounded. By what power could
the old one have left this mirage
behind? Was it a warning? I hid
my eyes in my hands and
pondered the riddle posed by a
faint whisper in my ear.
"Watsa matta honey, you
cherry?"
Ten Years After
I returned to visit this
meaningful old indian ten years
later. (Still no Ph.D.) He was
sitting on a cactus on his dusty
stone porch.
"Look for a spot to sit down,"
he said.
I felt bewildered and asked him
what he meant.
"Sit down before you fall
down /i/yo," he answered
with a curious smile.
I was suddenly overcome by an
awful urge to sit. His eyes shown
complexly as I hunted for a spot.
How would I know one if I saw
one? Would it look like a simple
chair, or perhaps an unassuming
ottoman? Finally, upwind of the
old one, I noticed a pleasant
change in odor, and sat
comfortably. I wondered what
force this dark, dusty, wrinkled,
laughing old brujo had been using
to compel me to this seated
position. (See appendix analysis
of "A Man of Politeness.")
We sat quietly all day as our
shadows rotated slowly and
mysteriously around us. As the
orange and honey evening began
to glaze to toast brown desert,
hunger began to gnaw at my
innards.
"You would like something to
eat, maybe?" he said, leaning
ominously toward me.
Uncanny! How could he have
known about my terrible hunger
and the intense fear that there
were no good restaurants nearby?
Cautiously. I answered with a
question.
"And what would you give me

to eat?"_
He laughed uninterestedly in
his warm and distant way. What
psychotrope would he dare give
me indeed? A morsel of the
potent lapis lazuli? A crap of the
mighty magnum opus?
"We have chiles uerdes, or
perhaps you would prefer the
milder chiles rellenoshe said, as
a droll look of sympathy spread
over his dry lined face. He
chuckled.
Unprepared and Clumsy
I knew he felt that I was
unprepared for initiation into any
darker rites. I felt at once clumsy
and impotent.
Without a word, he lept
quickly inside the hut. I was
amazed that a man of his age, 97 I
guessed, could move with such
agility, giggl' n g all the while like a
teenage fan.
As he lit the wood stove, an
erie orange glow filled the room.
Smoke began to drift weirdly
from the fire. He reached up and
removed a pan-like object hanging
from the wall near the stove. This
he placed gently over the fire.
Then he poured a clear yellowish
fluid from a vial into the pan. He
had placed two roundish flat
pancake-like objects on the table
next to the stove. These I took to
be made of some sort of mealy
clay. After placing a small portion
of a reddish substance in the
center of each, he carefully rolled
them up folded the ends over, and
cautiously lowered them into the
fluid in the pan.
Confusion
In a matter of moments, I was
overcome by confusion. The rolls
he had made began to spit, spatter
and sing. They seemed to have a
life of their own. They hissed and
splashed as the old one poked and
jabbed at them with a wooden
spoon-like instrument.
'Taste me, taste me. Come on
and taste me," they taunted.
I hesitated outside, at the
crude door.
"If you are not hungry, why
don't you go home?"
' The words flew out of his
mouth like posion out of desert
fangs. I knew that all my devoted
efforts to be the receptacle of his
magical droppings had been
flushed away. Ruefully, I realized
that I was unable to wipe away
the consequences of a hopelessly
different, spiritually
impoverished, cultural past.
"Come back any time," he
added mockingly.
I realized that for the time, his
striving to teach me had stopped.
My bank account was running
low, and I was out of cigarettes,
but I knew I would be forced to
heed his call to return .. . perhaps
someday, when I needed material
for another book.

stupid.
"Why is it you talk of nothing
when there are scientific journals
to read?" I asked him.
"What if one cannot see?" he
roared with laughter.
Questioning
I wanted to ask him if he
would teach me to see, but I was
afraid to annoy him with my
incessant questioning. He turned
abruptly and walked out,
terminating the lesson in his
dramatic way.
Back in the taverna a chill
spread over my body. Could it
simply have been the air
conditioning? I don't know. There
is always a ready explanation for
these dark experiences if one is
gullable enough.
The room seemed to grow
darker and then a bright hazy
green light appeared to be emitted
by the image of a nude female
body dancing in the center of the
room. Strange rhythms of music
sounded. By what power could
the old one have left this mirage
behind? Was it a warning? I hid
my eyes in my hands and
pondered the riddle posed by a
faint whisper in my ear.
"Watsa matta honey, you
cherry?"
Ten Years After
I returned to visit this
meaningful old indian ten years
later. (Still no Ph.D.) He was
sitting on a cactus on his dusty
stone porch.
"Look for a spot to sit down,"
he said.
I felt bewildered and asked him
what he meant.
"Sit down before you fall
down /i/yo," he answered
with a curious smile.
I was suddenly overcome by an
awful urge to sit. His eyes shown
complexly as I hunted for a spot.
How would I know one if I saw
one? Would it look like a simple
chair, or perhaps an unassuming
ottoman? Finally, upwind of the
old one, I noticed a pleasant
change in odor, and sat
comfortably. I wondered what
force this dark, dusty, wrinkled,
laughing old brujo had been using
to compel me to this seated
position. (See appendix analysis
of "A Man of Politeness.")
We sat quietly all day as our
shadows rotated slowly and
mysteriously around us. As the
orange and honey evening began
to glaze to toast brown desert,
hunger began to gnaw at my
innards.
"You would like something to
eat, maybe?" he said, leaning
ominously toward me.
Uncanny! How could he have
known about my terrible hunger
and the intense fear that there
were no good restaurants nearby?
Cautiously. I answered with a
question.
"And what would you give me

to eat?"_
He laughed uninterestedly in
his warm and distant way. What
psychotrope would he dare give
me indeed? A morsel of the
potent lapis lazuli? A crap of the
mighty magnum opus?
"We have chiles uerdes, or
perhaps you would prefer the
milder chiles rellenoshe said, as
a droll look of sympathy spread
over his dry lined face. He
chuckled.
Unprepared and Clumsy
I knew he felt that I was
unprepared for initiation into any
darker rites. I felt at once clumsy
and impotent.
Without a word, he lept
quickly inside the hut. I was
amazed that a man of his age, 97 I
guessed, could move with such
agility, giggl' n g all the while like a
teenage fan.
As he lit the wood stove, an
erie orange glow filled the room.
Smoke began to drift weirdly
from the fire. He reached up and
removed a pan-like object hanging
from the wall near the stove. This
he placed gently over the fire.
Then he poured a clear yellowish
fluid from a vial into the pan. He
had placed two roundish flat
pancake-like objects on the table
next to the stove. These I took to
be made of some sort of mealy
clay. After placing a small portion
of a reddish substance in the
center of each, he carefully rolled
them up folded the ends over, and
cautiously lowered them into the
fluid in the pan.
Confusion
In a matter of moments, I was
overcome by confusion. The rolls
he had made began to spit, spatter
and sing. They seemed to have a
life of their own. They hissed and
splashed as the old one poked and
jabbed at them with a wooden
spoon-like instrument.
'Taste me, taste me. Come on
and taste me," they taunted.
I hesitated outside, at the
crude door.
"If you are not hungry, why
don't you go home?"
' The words flew out of his
mouth like posion out of desert
fangs. I knew that all my devoted
efforts to be the receptacle of his
magical droppings had been
flushed away. Ruefully, I realized
that I was unable to wipe away
the consequences of a hopelessly
different, spiritually
impoverished, cultural past.
"Come back any time," he
added mockingly.
I realized that for the time, his
striving to teach me had stopped.
My bank account was running
low, and I was out of cigarettes,
but I knew I would be forced to
heed his call to return .. . perhaps
someday, when I needed material
for another book.

behind? Was it a warning? I hid
my eyes in my hands and
pondered the riddle posed by a
faint whisper in my ear.
"Watsa matta honey, you
cherry?"
Ten Years After
I returned to visit this
meaningful old indian ten years
later. (Still no Ph.D.) He was
sitting on a cactus on his dusty
stone porch.
"Look for a spot to sit down,"
he said.
I felt bewildered and asked him
what he meant.
"Sit down before you fall
down /i/yo," he answered
with a curious smile.
I was suddenly overcome by an
awful urge to sit. His eyes shown
complexly as I hunted for a spot.
How would I know one if I saw
one? Would it look like a simple
chair, or perhaps an unassuming
ottoman? Finally, upwind of the
old one, I noticed a pleasant
change in odor, and sat
comfortably. I wondered what
force this dark, dusty, wrinkled,
laughing old brujo had been using
to compel me to this seated
position. (See appendix analysis
of "A Man of Politeness.")
We sat quietly all day as our
shadows rotated slowly and
mysteriously around us. As the
orange and honey evening began
to glaze to toast brown desert,
hunger began to gnaw at my
innards.
"You would like something to
eat, maybe?" he said, leaning
ominously toward me.
Uncanny! How could he have
known about my terrible hunger
and the intense fear that there
were no good restaurants nearby?
Cautiously. I answered with a
question.
"And what would you give me

to eat?"_
He laughed uninterestedly in
his warm and distant way. What
psychotrope would he dare give
me indeed? A morsel of the
potent lapis lazuli? A crap of the
mighty magnum opus?
"We have chiles uerdes, or
perhaps you would prefer the
milder chiles rellenoshe said, as
a droll look of sympathy spread
over his dry lined face. He
chuckled.
Unprepared and Clumsy
I knew he felt that I was
unprepared for initiation into any
darker rites. I felt at once clumsy
and impotent.
Without a word, he lept
quickly inside the hut. I was
amazed that a man of his age, 97 I
guessed, could move with such
agility, giggl' n g all the while like a
teenage fan.
As he lit the wood stove, an
erie orange glow filled the room.
Smoke began to drift weirdly
from the fire. He reached up and
removed a pan-like object hanging
from the wall near the stove. This
he placed gently over the fire.
Then he poured a clear yellowish
fluid from a vial into the pan. He
had placed two roundish flat
pancake-like objects on the table
next to the stove. These I took to
be made of some sort of mealy
clay. After placing a small portion
of a reddish substance in the
center of each, he carefully rolled
them up folded the ends over, and
cautiously lowered them into the
fluid in the pan.
Confusion
In a matter of moments, I was
overcome by confusion. The rolls
he had made began to spit, spatter
and sing. They seemed to have a
life of their own. They hissed and
splashed as the old one poked and
jabbed at them with a wooden
spoon-like instrument.
'Taste me, taste me. Come on
and taste me," they taunted.
I hesitated outside, at the
crude door.
"If you are not hungry, why
don't you go home?"
' The words flew out of his
mouth like posion out of desert
fangs. I knew that all my devoted
efforts to be the receptacle of his
magical droppings had been
flushed away. Ruefully, I realized
that I was unable to wipe away
the consequences of a hopelessly
different, spiritually
impoverished, cultural past.
"Come back any time," he
added mockingly.
I realized that for the time, his
striving to teach me had stopped.
My bank account was running
low, and I was out of cigarettes,
but I knew I would be forced to
heed his call to return .. . perhaps
someday, when I needed material
for another book.

I had come to San Place
Secreto in the summer of '4i
looking for herbs to help me
finish my thesis in
psychophantology at UPI (class of
'44). Sometimes you just gotta git
away. After drinking cerveza in
the taverna all day waiting for cho
time, I felt a strange pressure
sensation in my lower abdomen. I
commented on this to my friend
Biff, who pointed me oddly to the
urinal. As I entered, I saw for the
first time the old dusty man who
was to be the source of so many
future riches. I was most amazed
by the fact that his eyes were
closed tightly, frozen like the
pistons on an old mexican bus. The
thing that second most amazed
me about the old one was the

uncanny way he was talking about
emptiness and pointing to his
loins. I felt extremely puzzled and
stupid.
"Why is it you talk of nothing
when there are scientific journals
to read?" I asked him.
"What if one cannot see?" he
roared with laughter.
Questioning
I wanted to ask him if he
would teach me to see, but I was
afraid to annoy him with my
incessant questioning. He turned
abruptly and walked out,
terminating the lesson in his
dramatic way.
Back in the taverna a chill
spread over my body. Could it
simply have been the air
conditioning? I don't know. There
is always a ready explanation for
these dark experiences if one is
gullable enough.
The room seemed to grow
darker and then a bright hazy
green light appeared to be emitted
by the image of a nude female
body dancing in the center of the
room. Strange rhythms of music
sounded. By what power could
the old one have left this mirage
behind? Was it a warning? I hid
my eyes in my hands and
pondered the riddle posed by a
faint whisper in my ear.
