Reply To President
Editor:
Mr. Lyman, in his letter
correcting his comments on the
SCIRE controversy (Daily, May 4,
1973), made a number of serious
misrepresentations which I would
like to set straight at this time:
1) There has been no
"tendency to leave [responsibility
for academic quality] entirely to
Dean Gibbs;" this responsibility
has been a major concern of the
SCIRE director and policy board
as well as the Dean's office, and
our disagreements stem from
differing opinions on how to best
assure such academic quality. To
this question the assistant dean's
response has been primarily
bureaucratic, centering on the
completion of forms and the
observation of deadlines. The
policy board and the director
have, on the other hand, spent
most of their effort on facilitating
the direction, organization and
evaluation of the projects, both
on and off paper.
2) Our belief that the Dean is
"attempting to dominate SCIRE
and destroy its autonomy" refers
not to the Dean's effort to accept
responsibility, but rather his
stubborn insistence that we
comply with his conception of
SCIRE's operation. We were
allowed no chance to work
together at defining procedure
and soon were relegated to an
advisory status, as our power to
influence policy diminished. The
Dean's one-sided control
culminated in the termination of
Ron Jones, which was done over
the studied recommendations and
critical proposals of the whole
board. This we can only fairly
consider an effort to undermine
our autonomy.
3) Finally, I believe that our
present difficulties can be solved
without structural changes, but
only if the Dean desists from
seizing authority to the furthest
formal extremes of the charge,
and only if he returns to the
relationship of mutual
cooperation and responsibility
which is the spirit of the charge.
Only then can SCIRE resume
operation without endless battles
to maintain its independence. I
sincerely hope that C-US will not
disregard the integrity of our
concerns, as both Mr. Lyman and
Dean Gibbs appear to do, but
rather will arbitrate the dispute to
an effective and mutually
agreeable solution.

Spay and Neuter Program
Editor:
The article submitted by Bette
J. Phipps on April 25th expressing
concern for the welfare of
unwanted kittens and puppies was
very commendable. It is always
gratifying to learn of groups,
and/or individuals who share this
concern with us. However, as a
Low-Cost Spay & Neuter program
on the Peninsula, we feel she was,
perhaps quite unintentionally,
remiss in not listing services
provided by other than the Santa
Clara County Spay Clinic, as that
service is limited to residents of
the county, which would exclude
many pet owners who we feel are
entitled to reasonable "alteration"
charges for their cats and dogs.
Anyone, regardless of their
residencey may avail themselves
of our services. For more detailed

Senate Women's Resolution
Editor:
The front page coverage given
to the Senate resolution on
Women and Minorities in
Graduate Education (Daily, May
4) suggests that this should be
considered some kind of victory
for the groups concerned. After
six months of debate we have in
fact arrived at nothing more than
a reporting procedure by which
the Dean of Graduate Studies
shall present figures on the status
of Women and Minorities. The
Senate refrained from establishing
criteria by which to evaluate the
University's efforts on behalf of
those groups. Thus, there is
nothing in the Senate resolution
to suggest what is acceptable or
unacceptable with regard to
representation of or financial aid
to members of these groups. Even
the original SGES report,
generally negligent of these
questions, stated, with regard to
women: "Steps shall be taken
both by the University and by the
Departments having fewer than 40
percent female graduate students
to increase application, (p. 207)"
A resolution, seeking to improve
on SGES by including numerical
goals with regard to minorities,
was rejected at the outset by the
Steering Committee of the Senate,
and never presented to the Senate.
It was, however, clear, in
subsequent discussions, that there
was opposition to establishing
numerical criteria by which any
affirmative action programs could
be evaluated. The opponents of
the establishment of criteria
invoked the spectre of reverse
discrimination and of possible
legal entanglements to justify
their position.
The position of the University
is interesting when contrasted
with that taken recently under
the auspices of the court by that
most avant-garde institutionâ€”The
Bank of California. The bank
agreed to establish quotas for
representation in management of
40 percent women, 10 percent
blacks and 15 percent
spanish-surname to be achieved by
a fixed date.
"Our affirmative action goals
are ambitious, as indeed they
should be, but we believe they are
attainable." (Charles de
Bretteville, Board Chairman of the
Bank of California)
Stanford has now established a
positive procedure by which this
issue will be kept before the
community. We hope that the
Senate can in the future, take a
more progressive stand and begin
to recognize the need to establish
goals based on the social
responsibilities of a major public
institution.

Phi Delt Censure
Editor:
The recent media accounts of
the party at the Phi Delt House
portray the incident as an
example of "boys will be boys."
It is unfortunate that the
selling of a woman's body should
be discussed with no apparent
concern for the sexism involved.
