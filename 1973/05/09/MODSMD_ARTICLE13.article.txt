# Lyman Praises Trustees As Vital To Stanford's Survival
## 
### 
The private sector of American
higher education could not long
survive without governing boards
accountable both to the general
public and their campus
communities, President Richard
W. Lyman said Monday.
"It is as much the survival in
good health of the lay governing
board as anything else that has, so
far at least, enabled the leading
American private universities and
colleges to avoid the fate of their
European colleagues — takeover
by the state," Lyman added.
"This is so because the private
lay governing board has provided
a means of assuring some
reasonable degree of public
accountability without resorting
to the engine of government.
"If the trustees of a private
university represented only the
campus population, there would
be no accountability to the
general public.
"If, on the other hand, they
represented the whole spectrum
of political life, they would be, in
effect, a public board, and private
higher education would disappear
as a true alternative to the public
sector."
Reception For Trustees
His remarks were prepared for
delivery to a reception honoring
the Board of Trustees. Sponsored
by the Alumni Association, the
reception drew several hundred to
the Mark Hopkins Hotel.
As the targets of "reformist
and even abolitionist wrath,"
trustees have experienced both
"self-questioning and self-doubt"
at times, Lyman noted.
But, in ways analogous to all
other movements for individual
and institutional self-assertion,
there also has been a move for
"trustee power," he observed.
Rights And Prerogatives
"While this is more difficult to
document than the outcry for
reform, I know of no one who is
in touch with developments
around the country who does not
9ee growing tendencies toward
assertion of trustee rights and

prerogatives.
"Sometimes these tendencies
conflict with the true role of
governing boards by threatening
to involve trustees in detailed
academic decision-making. That
must be resisted for the good of
all concerned, trustees as well as
the institutions which they hold
in trust.
"On the other hand, the surge
for 'trustee power' is not to be
dismissed as merely self-serving or
frivolously imitative of all other
'power' movements...
'Responsiveness'
"It is related to the uneasiness
many people feel about the
responsiveness of institutions,
including institutions of higher
learning.
"In the public sector, boards of
regents claim and are often given
major power to coordinate and
make more efficient the vast
systems under their control.
"And in the private sector,
financial pressures have led boards
of trustees to look more closely at
the management of the
university's resources and to be
more critical of the tendency,

inevitable among students and
faculty, to see the answer to all
such problems in the raising of
more money — by somebody
other than themselves. That
somebody is, of course, first and
foremost the trustees."
An ex-officio trustee, Lyman
said "like others, our Board has its
share of self-questioning. Like
others, it has insisted on knowing
how effectively the University
staff... [is] managing the
University's resources.
"But unlike many, the
Stanford Board has also
recognized the University cannot
stand alone against the
inflationary tide without serious
loss of quality. To stretch our
fund-raising capacity so as to
prevent such loss is the central
meaning of the Campaign for
Stanford," a five-year, $300
million effort, now in its second
year.
The largest intensive capital
campaign in the history of
American higher education, the
drive topped the $101 million
mark last month, one year after
its public announcement.

and even abolitionist wrath,"
trustees have experienced both
"self-questioning and self-doubt"
at times, Lyman noted.
But, in ways analogous to all
other movements for individual
and institutional self-assertion,
there also has been a move for
"trustee power," he observed.
Rights And Prerogatives
"While this is more difficult to
document than the outcry for
reform, I know of no one who is
in touch with developments
around the country who does not
9ee growing tendencies toward
assertion of trustee rights and

prerogatives.
"Sometimes these tendencies
conflict with the true role of
governing boards by threatening
to involve trustees in detailed
academic decision-making. That
must be resisted for the good of
all concerned, trustees as well as
the institutions which they hold
in trust.
"On the other hand, the surge
for 'trustee power' is not to be
dismissed as merely self-serving or
frivolously imitative of all other
'power' movements...
'Responsiveness'
"It is related to the uneasiness
many people feel about the
responsiveness of institutions,
including institutions of higher
learning.
"In the public sector, boards of
regents claim and are often given
major power to coordinate and
make more efficient the vast
systems under their control.
"And in the private sector,
financial pressures have led boards
of trustees to look more closely at
the management of the
university's resources and to be
more critical of the tendency,

inevitable among students and
faculty, to see the answer to all
such problems in the raising of
more money — by somebody
other than themselves. That
somebody is, of course, first and
foremost the trustees."
An ex-officio trustee, Lyman
said "like others, our Board has its
share of self-questioning. Like
others, it has insisted on knowing
how effectively the University
staff... [is] managing the
University's resources.
"But unlike many, the
Stanford Board has also
recognized the University cannot
stand alone against the
inflationary tide without serious
loss of quality. To stretch our
fund-raising capacity so as to
prevent such loss is the central
meaning of the Campaign for
Stanford," a five-year, $300
million effort, now in its second
year.
The largest intensive capital
campaign in the history of
American higher education, the
drive topped the $101 million
mark last month, one year after
its public announcement.

CELEBRATE — The annual Cinco de Mayo celebration this year
included folk dancing in White Plaza Friday. Mariachi food was also
served.
The private sector of American
higher education could not long
survive without governing boards
accountable both to the general
public and their campus
communities, President Richard
W. Lyman said Monday.
"It is as much the survival in
good health of the lay governing
board as anything else that has, so
far at least, enabled the leading
American private universities and
colleges to avoid the fate of their
European colleagues — takeover
by the state," Lyman added.
"This is so because the private
lay governing board has provided
a means of assuring some
reasonable degree of public
accountability without resorting
to the engine of government.
"If the trustees of a private
university represented only the
campus population, there would
be no accountability to the
general public.
"If, on the other hand, they
represented the whole spectrum
of political life, they would be, in
effect, a public board, and private
higher education would disappear
as a true alternative to the public
sector."
Reception For Trustees
His remarks were prepared for
delivery to a reception honoring
the Board of Trustees. Sponsored
by the Alumni Association, the
reception drew several hundred to
the Mark Hopkins Hotel.
As the targets of "reformist
and even abolitionist wrath,"
trustees have experienced both
"self-questioning and self-doubt"
at times, Lyman noted.
