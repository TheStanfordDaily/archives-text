# Assembly Kills Drinking At 18

### Associated Press 
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Legislation to drop
the legal drinking age to 18 in California has
been killed by an Assembly committee after a
housewife told lawmakers they should be
ashamed of even considering teen-age
drinking.
"It's disgusting that you members of the
legislature would condone something like
this," said Barbara Mayne, a housewife from
the Sacramento suburb of Fair Oaks who
introduced herself to the committee as "a
mother."
"You should be ashamed of yourselves,"
she told the Assembly Committee on
Constitutional Amendments Monday.
Shortly after that, the committee voted 2-2
to kill the proposed bill and proposed state
constitutional amendment by Assemblyman
Robert Nimmo that would have permitted 18

to 20-year-olds to possess and consume
alcoholic beverages. The proposal needed at
least three votes from the Five-member
committee.
The measure would have allowed an
estimated 1.1 million young Californians to
drink alcoholic beverages legally, t,e
committee staff estimated.
Nimmo (R-Atascadero), said 18-year-olds
can now serve on grand juries, fight in wars,
marry and raise children, enter contracts and
vote, "but they can't buy a bottle of beer."
California's minimum age of 21 for legal
drinking is "an anachronism—something that
can no longer be tolerated," Nimmo said.
This is the thrid year in a row that moves
to lower the legal drinking age to 18 have
been killed in legislature, but previous
proposals have passed the Assembly only to
die in the Senate.

Thirty states now permit persons under 21
to purchase alcoholic beverages. Fifteen allow
them to buy and drink hard liquor. Five states
set the minimum drinking age at 19, the
committee staff said.
In Oklahoma, girls aged 18 or over can buy
beer, but males must be 21.
If the legislature fails to approve the
constitutional amendment, Nimmo said
young people would launch an effort to
qualify an initiative for the state ballot.
Wilber Korfhage, a lobbyist for the
American Council on Alcohol Problems, said
18-year-olds would begin buying liquor for
17, 16 and 15-year-olds if Nimmo's measure
passed.
The constitutional amendment is ACA 14.
The bill is AB 782.
