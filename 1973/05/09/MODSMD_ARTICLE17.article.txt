# Anatomy Of An ASSU Special Events Show
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
When you go to an ASSU Special Events
concert, such as the John Mayall/Mark-Almond
show in Maples a few weeks ago, what you are
seeing is the result of several weeks of work by
the Special Events Board. Contrary to popular
opinion, Special Events Director Ron Shannon is
not the only one behind the scenes; the Board
also consists of assistant director Mike Leydon,
Tim Talbot, Mike Upson, Bill Lippett, Doug
Baldwin, Roger Lautzenheiser, and Peter Munk. I
talked with Shannon and Baldwin last week
about what is involved in the production of a
concert.
Shannon breaks down the overall work into
three parts: booking, promotion, and
produciton. He does most of the booking
himself, which is more or less a constant job.
"We mostly book our artists through seven or
eight major nationwide booking agencies, as well
as some local agencies," says Shannon, adding
that he is in touch with them about once a week.
The question of who is booked is a complex
matter of availability, preferences, and facilities.
"If someone we want is available on a night we
can get a hall, we book them," according to
Shannon.
The desirability of a given act is determined
by such indicators as record sales, radio station
popularity, trade magazines, or in some cases like
the Grateful Dead, apparent popularity on
campus.
Complicated Process
After an artist has been initially booked, a hall
must be procured, which involves dealing with
Tresidder or the Drama or Athletic departments.

Then the artist must be contracted, sometimes
with special provisions.
For example, part of the contract for the
Dead concert in Maples last quarter was that the
sound system could be set up and tested the
night before. The booking is therefore a quite
complicated process, and must be done weeks or
months in advance of the concert.
Next step is promotion, which is largely
handled by Munk (outside advertising) and
Lautzenheiser (on-campus leaflets, etc.). Ads are
run in the Daily, the San Francisco Chronicle,
the San Jose Mercury and News, and the Palo
Alto Times.
There are some paid commercial spots on Bay
Area radio stations; these along with the
newspaper ads and leaflet printing costs make up
the bulk of the promotional costs, which can be
as much as ten percent of the gross receipts from
ticket sales.
Stanford has some disadvantages and some
advantages in promotion of concerts. The shows
must be more widely publicized than those of
larger organizations. As Shannon points out,
"Bill Graham only advertises in one place, the
Sunday Chronicle, and everyone knows to look
there. Only if a show is selling slowly will he go
to a few spots on KSAN."
Free Service
However, the non-profit status of the ASSU
allows for free "public service" spots on radio,
and occasionally TV, stations. Other sources of
free publicity have been the ASSU Sunday Flicks
and the Athletic Department's billboard by the
Stadium.
Production of the concerts is perhaps the

most complicated stage, involving security, setup
of the hall, sound and lights, and cleanup.
Security is handled by Doug Baldwin, and
invovles Stanford Department of Public Safety
officers, ASSU student police, and other student
security employees.
According to Baldwin, each concert has
required fewer security people, and even at big
concerts in Maples, audieces are "very
well-behaved." At present, the Stanford officers
are almost entirely involved in traffic control,
while inside security is handled mostly by
students.
Duties of these student guards include letting
in employees, band, and "roadies," before the
show, taking tickets, and keeping the audience in
appropriate sections, out of the aisles, and off

the stage. In a typical Maples concert, according
to Baldwin, people with floor tickets are
rubber-stamped to keep others with upstairs
tickets from coming onto the floor.
Also, guards are posted along the railing to
keep people from climbing down from the loge
into the bleachers. At the door, bags and other
containers are checked for bottles, at the request
of the Athletic Department, and signs are posted
outside advising people that glass containers are

not allowed inside.
Fire regulations require that the aisles be
maintained, and that chairs be in fixed locations.
In order to meet these requirements, chairs are
tied together in rows. However, as Baldwin
admits, this is not too effective, since the twine
can be cut or boken. Therefore, some student
guards patrol the floor to keep the aisle clear.
On the day of the concert, everything runs on
a tight schedule. The stage must be built first,
which is largely the responsibility of Tim Talbot.
If a piano is needed, it must be scheduled to
arrive after the stage is ready. All deliveries of
lighting and sound equipment must be staggered,
due to the limited capacity of the loading dock.
Often several different organizations are
involved.

While house lights and spotlights are generally
done by Special Events, the bands generally
handle their own stage lighting. The sound
system may belong to the band or may be
contracted to an outside lights company.
Student Help
Generally, student help arranged by Special
Events will aide the band in unloading and
loading, while the actual setup of the equipment
is handled by the band's road crew.

After the concert, the equipment must be
disassembled in a similar matter, followed by
dismantling of the stage and removal of the
chairs from the floor. This process generally goes
on well past midnight. The rental agreement for
the hall usually provides for the cleanup by the
custodial staff, and Maples is eventually turned
back into a basketball pavilion.
In all matters related to physical facilities,
including Last-minute needs for tools or
technical assistance, Shannon credits Bill
Cleveland of the University's Physical Plant,
whom he calls "invaluable" to the production of
concerts.
Cost Breakdown
Shannon gave the following approximate
breakdown of costs and credits on a hypothetical
successful Maples concert. The gross from ticket
sales is about $24,000. Promotion costs about
$2,400. A typical artist's contract calls for a
guarantee of $10,000 plus 60 percent of the
receipts over a given amount, say $22,000, so
that the total cost for the artist is $11,200.
This leaves about $10,400, most of which
goes into hall rental, which also calls for a
guaranteed amount plus a percentage of the gate.
If any profit is made, it goes into a general fund
in Special Events which helps absorb losses
incurred by less successful concerts.
According to Shannon, this year has been
quite successful compared to previous years.
Special Events is still a money loser, but these
losses have been trimmed considerably. In view
of the extraordinary complexity of producing a
concert, it is remarkable that any happen at all.
