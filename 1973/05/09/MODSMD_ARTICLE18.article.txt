# Dance Of 'Total Expression'
## 
### ANN MALMUTH 
An essential aspect of the Lar
Lubovitch Dance Troupe is that
there is a minimum of put-on. The
performers generated a personal
relationship with the audience last
Friday night at Memorial
Auditorium, something of a rare
commodity in today's dance.
Within the framework of
Lubovitch's strikingly original
choreography, each dancer was
allowed to express himself as an
individual.
Because of this freedom and
perhaps reflecting Lubovitch's
choice of dancers, there was a
happy lack of competition on
stage. The males were not prideful
peacocks insisting on showing
their tail feathers at every
inappropriate opportunity.
The females were not the tight,
competitive sort that is prevalent
in ballet. Because they were
allowed to be individuals, they
could freely harmonize as a group.
The audience sensed this harmony
and was easily drawn into each
dance as into a one-to-one
conversation.
The works presented were:
"Joy of Man's Desiring," a gigue,
gavotte sarabande, prelude, and
air, danced to Bach's Suites for
Cello Solo, 'The Time Before," a
duet danced to Stravinsky's

Concerto for String Quartet,
"Clear Lake," to music by
Mendelssohn, and "Whirligogs" to
music by Luciano Berio.
The highest moment of the
evening was "Clear Lake" inspired
by the troupe's summer in Eli,
Vermont. A genuine sense of
relaxation enveloped the audience
as the activity of people, birds,
animals and fish, in and around
the lake, were portrayed.
I cannot resist the temptation
of comparing Lar Lubovitch to
Bejart. Bejart has mastered the art
of the static moment. One could

take a photograph at any time of
Bejart's dancers on stage and the
result would be an aesthetically
pleasing arrangement.
Lar Lubovitch, though, has
surpassed Bejart in the kinesthetic
sense. His choreography involves
an inspired interplay of vectors,
especially effective in the
contrasted movements of groups
and individuals.
Unlike Bejart, Lar Lubovitch
rarely falls back on traditional
movement as a filler between
segments of more inventive
choreography. His sense of

movement is a delightful
application of the unexpected.
Lubovitch started dancing at
the late age of eighteen. He
designs his own costumes and sets.
He finds classical ballet a necessity
in order to achieve the technical
range the body needs for total
expression, but he relies mainly
on modern dance for the
expressiveness it offers. Lar
Lubovitch believes a dancer must
be able to dance all dances and
unless it feels as enjoyable as
doing the boogy, he is not doing
his duty as a dancer.
