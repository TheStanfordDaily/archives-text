# 'Caretaker' Misdirected
## 
### JEFFERY SEGAL 
The moment the worthless contents of Aston's
cluttered, dirty, little fiat were seen spread across
the full length of the stage in obtrusively orderly
piles, it was obvious that something was botched in
the ACT touring arm's production of Harold
Pinter's, "The Caretaker," presented Sunday night
at the UC Berkeley campus.
Aston's room was too pretty, and missing the
walls that properly define it, yet it sufficed for the
appreciative audience. So did this production,neatly
put together, take in the unwary audience with
occasional inspired moments filled in by the
gratuitous technical polish typical of the ACT
actors.
The fact that the show's three actors are all well
trained is unfortunate only in that they were all so
thoroughly capable of following Donald Ewer's
inadequate direction that proposed to leave the
show at the level of dark comedy.
But Pinter intended more than that. "As far as
I'm concerned," he said," 'The Caretaker' is funny
up to a point. Beyond that point it ceases to be
funny, and it was because of that point that I wrote
it."
Far From Reality
Pinter's premise regarding the construction of
'The Caretaker" is that the so-called "well made
play," where everything is well ordered in a very
linear manner towards a final end, in which
dialogue is supposed to represent reality but is
actually too selective, grammatically correct, and
logical for everyday speech, and in which all
questions are answered that are raised, is actually as
far from the "reality" of life as possible.
Life is full of loose ends, ramblir.gs, idioms,
mistakes, and the unknown. To Pinter absurdity is
the reality of life; not the highly stylized absurdity
of 'The Bald Soprano" by lonesco, but a ruthlessly
true description of the illogical in the commonplace
that leads to countless terrors from the e' ment of
the unknown
An overpowering mastery of language allows
Pinter to manipulate the mundane, and without
changing, elevating, or explaining it he creates a
world frought with terror and dramatic tension
existing alongside an inseparably fused element of
humor. He can take the most harmless of phrases,
"What's your name?," and turn it into a destructive
weapon relentlessly employed in verbal assault more
devastation than any insulting, vehement phrasing
could ever accomplish.
No Symbolism
Although the play is wide o pen to highly
symbolic interpretations, and has been subjected to
them, Pinter denies that he was writing a symbolic
play. His concern was with "a particularly human
situation." It is to the great credit of Pinter that he
has employed the selectivity of an author to depict
a view of life in a simple situation so panoramically
as to invite a great number of hypotheses about its
meaning.
To attach any one theme to this work is unfair,
because themes in this play overlap, blend, and fuse
like layers of dough in a piece of fine pastry. In it
one finds the major issues of the modem drama:
Alienation of the self from self, self from world, one
from another; the degradation of life, and the
fruitless effort of man to reconcile the alienated

parts of life and give some meaning and value to
existence.
Aston, played by Robert Mooney, currently a
member of the faculty of the Stanford Drama
Department as well as an actor with the ACT, is a
laconic, slow-speaking man in his thirties. His speech
always follows his caution, because society has
chastised him with electric shock for once
attempting to communicate with his fellow men.
Beautiful Portrayal
Mooney's portrayal was a beautifully detailed,
sharply focused characterization that depicted
clearly the detachment of this man who chooses no
longer to communicate. In Aston's one great speech,
where he tries to talk about his problem, the power
of the attempt renders him incapable of
communication. Seldom does an audience drop as
rapidly to such a dead silence as the one caught by
the power of Mooney's interpretation.
Aston brings to his run down apartment an old
bum he saves from a fight in a cafe, Davies. He
offers Davies whatever he might need: food,
clothing, money, and a bed. Donald Ewers as
Davies, who toured in the national company of
'The Caretaker," and who is the director of this
production, is generally effective, especially in the
comic moments.
But when it comes to establishing the terror and
tragedy of the play, his acting was not very subtle or
incisive. The desperation of Davies when his pride
destroys his opportunity to find himself a home
with Aston never comes through with full force.
Mick, Aston's leather-jacketted younger brother,
was played by Henry Hoffman. Mick finds Davies in
the apartment which he really owns and lets Aston
run, and mistaking Davies for a burglar, roughs him
up before finding out that he is Aston's guest.
Hoffman never touches on the deadly, violent,
destructive nature behind the polite, almost
self-mocking veneer of the slimy tempter that Mick
is.
Needs Direction
He desperately needs to be properly directed, but
he suffered from the loss of an objective judging eye
when his director became fellow actor and was
unable to fulfill the double task.
However, if Ewer's simple-minded staging was
truly indicative of the depth of his approach to the
play, giving him nothing to do but direct might have
been no help to this production. By staging the end
of the play with a defiant gesture on Davies' part as
he exits, and Aston beginning to build his ideal
accomplishment, his garden shed, Ewer went wholly
against what Pinter had intended.
The definitiveness of this last moment implies
that objective reality can be reconciled to subjective
ideal, something which is meticulously denied in the
play. Furthermore, Davie's refusal to acknowledge
that his own pride is responsible for his fall destroys
the tradionally tragic element within this
unconventional frame.
The show was not boring. To be sure, a tightly
crafted work of literary genius, staged with a true
and keen sense of its intrinsic comic elements by
three well trained performers, has to work to be
boring. But it can very easily miss the mark for lack
of knowing the best spot to aim for, and this
production ended up off target.
