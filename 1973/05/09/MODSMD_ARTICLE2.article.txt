# Study Reveals Faults Of Defense Contracts
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
Accepting Department of Defense
contracts is not good business for
midpeninsula industries, according to a
study conducted by the Citizens
Conversion Committee in conjunction
with SWOPSI course 150.
The study, released yesterday,
shows that most of the major
economic problems which defense
contractors face are directly related to
their business with the Defense
Department.
Problems cited by the report
include difficulty in meeting delivery
schedules, tough competition for a
limited amount of work, irregular flow
of business, and general instability in
the defense market.
In surveying 15 midpeninsula firms
including Hewlett-Packard, Philco
Ford and Varian, all of Palo Alto;
Lockheed Aircraft and Westinghouse
Electric of Sunnyvale; and Litton
Industries of San Carlos, the
researchers reported that
defense-oriented companies in the past
few years have:
— suffered a greater decline in
general production, including a decline
in their defense contracting;
— suffered from more cutbacks;
— laid off more workers;
— and have initiated much less
diversification than companies with
less military contracting.
Began Fall Quarter
The survey of economic trends in
midpeninsula companies with over $1
million in defense contracting in 1972
began fall quarter in the SWOPSI
course titled "Influence of the Defense
Industry on the Midpeninsula: A
Community Action Project."
Three Stanford graduate students,
Frederickßaron and Conway Collis of
the law school and Robert Davis of the
law and business schools, directed
the course and headed the committee.
The committee, a non-profit
organization funded with a grant from
the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace in Washington,
D.C., involves not only the SWOPSI
class but also a number of
midpeninsula citizens.
Discussing the committee's
findings, Keith Loken, one of the
researchers, said companies with "the
greatest dependence on the Pentagon

have fared much worse than their
counterparts" with lower percentages
of military work.
Company Plight
One midpeninsula electronics
executive summarized his company's
plight to the researchers: "We have no
bias against the Pentagon, but we are
finding out that military work is just
not sound business. The defense
market is too unstable and the
Pentagon's demands are too costly to
make an efficient operation profitable.
"Synonomous with high costs are
constant deviations in government
buying regulations, an incredible
amount of superfluous testing, and an
overload of paperwork complete with
inch-thick specifications for simple
devices.
"To worsen matters government
auditors and inspectors constantly
keep strict vigilance over defense
projects, making the work much
slower and more costly," he added.
Two Remedies
Companies are seeking one of two
remedies to their economic problems.
Either they are attempting to improve
efficiency and technology to become
more competitive for government
contracts, or they are diversifying,
seeking conversion to new products,

research, and markets, the report said.
The study points to Varian
Associates as a prime example of an
economically successful conversion
program.
Researcher Bill Thacker explained,
"Ten years ago 70 percent of Varian's
total production was dependent upon
military contracts. At that time,
Varian was suffering from many of the
problems related to defense work.
"Today only about 25 percent of
Varian's work is dependent upon the
Pentagon, and Varian is a successful,
burgeoning company. They were able
to develop new markets consisting of
electronic equipment for medical,
industrial, and business uses."
The study concluded that mounting
economic problems are inevitable
unless companies follow Varian's lead
and begin to convert to developing
new consumer markets.
