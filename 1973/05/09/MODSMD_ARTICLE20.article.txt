# 'Moon Marigolds': Artistic Achievement
## 
### JON R. KENNEDY 
"The Effects of Gamma Rays
on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds" is
the most important film of its
kind since "The Last Picture
Show." They are as dissimilar as
they are alike, but the focus of
both is the same: the life and lot
of the American "underclass" —
people with middle class
philosophiesand values caught in
low class cultures, mind settings,
and aspirations, who believe in the
system but can never make it
work for them.
Beatrice (Frank) Hunsdorfer,

superbly characterized by Joanne
Woodward, has a middle class
1920 two-story house she
inherited from her father, and two
high school age daughters, Ruth
and Mathilda, whom she keeps in
Cokes and sweaters by doing
telephone solicitation for a dance
studio and renting out a first-floor
front room to senile senior
citizens who can't cut a rest
home. She inherited the daughters
from a guy who married her "out
of high school" because she made
him laugh, stayed around long
enough to sire the kids, then left

her, to die in a Holiday Inn.
Holiday Inns are middle class,
but when that's as high as you get
in life, you're low class.
You could hardly be more on
the other side of the tracks than
the Hunsdorfers — a railroad
freight spur runs down the middle
of the street in front of their
house. The house is in a small
Connecticut industrial city, and
the center of the family's culture
— like that of millions of families
sharing their way of life, including
whole towns like Anarene, Texas,
of 'The Last Picture Show," is
the local high school.
Ruth is a typical high school
cheer leader who likes rock music
and going to Friday night school
dances with her typical boyfriend.
Very much a product of her
culture, she can be expected to
end up like her mother, a fact she
already fears. The atypical thing
about Ruth is she has nightmares
which send her screaming through
the house, and gets epileptic
seisures from thinking about
another old lady dying in their
front room.
High School Crush
Mathilda is "sensitive." The
only guy who "sends" her is the
high school science teacher, but
he sends all the girls between her
age and her mother's, being the
most eligible bachelor around the
school's subculture.
Mathilda, played by Nell Potts,
daughter of Woodward and Paul
Newman, gets goose bumps
thinking about the way her
teacher describes atoms (well,
some of the atoms that were once
part of Moses himself might be in
this room right now, he tells the
class).
Mathilda spends most of her
time working on science projects,
namely raising a rabbit and a
planter full of man-in-the-moon

marigolds whose seeds were
exposed to varying amounts of
radiation. The marigold project
eventually wins Mathilda first
prize in the high school science
fair, which, she says, causes her to
believe in herself.
Beatrice's "heart is full" that
her daughter has been so honored,
but she is still so caught up in
herself that later that night all she
can think about is fixing up the
back yard (which is now like a
dump) so Ruth can have her
friends over to dance and play
ping pong, and she can serve them
sandwiches and her really good
cheesecake from the kitchen.
It is the highlight of Mathilda's
life — as if she'd been born again
— but to Beatrice the mother,
who also has to think of Ruth, her
old-lady roomer, and
pre-eminently herself, life goes on.
Universal Theme
Even though the "underclass"
is the focus of "Marigolds," its
theme is more universal: many are
called, but few are chosen. Why
can't Beatrice turn 5000 dollars
and her really good cheesecake
into a chain of "Man in the Moon
Tea Shops" to rival Kentucky
Fried Chicken? Why is Ruth so
satisfied to do the expected and
Mathilda dissatisfied to be less
than exceptional? Who controls
our fate? The administrators of
our high schools, our
unco-operative friends in positions
of power? Do we? Does God?
"Marigolds" is a film on the
level of a religious experience; an
artistic achievement. It speaks to
the question of life's meaning

without being didactic, without
preaching solutions, but with
proper pathos and insight.
While the Beatrices are so busy
seeking fulfillment that they end
up sucking life dry, the Mathildas,
quietly giving themselves — to a
rabbit, a study of radiation which
could lead to benefits for
humanity, an epileptic sister, a
senile stranger, a self-centered
eccentric mother — are pleasantly
surprised to receive in proportion
as they give.
It would be easy to conclude
by observing, then, that the
"chosen" are the ones who give
without expectation, for they are.
But what or who caused Mathilda
to be giving? That is the question
"Marigolds" raises, but it would
be presumptious if it also tried to
answer.
The film is based on a Pulitzer
Prize-winning play, and is a
triumph for the Newmans — Paul
produced and directed. It is
regrettable that it has received so
little attention, not even one
Oscar nomination when it
deserved many, but that is
understandable in an "indsutry"
which values entertainment higher
than art, escape from life above
confrontation with it.
