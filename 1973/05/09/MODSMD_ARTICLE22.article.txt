## 'Norman, Is That You?' Comedy Airs Black Altitudes 
### ELTON C. WOLFE 
"Norman is that You,"
currently playing at the
On-Broadway Lounge in San
Francisco, is a funny play
depicting the Black American
male's understanding of what a
man is, or should be. This
humorous play which pits the
Black male myth against a
homosexual reality, was written
by two whites — Ron Clark and
Sam Bobrick — as a vehicle
depicting white middle-class
values, and has been adapted as a
Black middle-class family
dilemma.
The cast is all-Black, except for
one white actor. The action of the
play centers around Norman
Chambers who is unexpectedly
visited by his father, a business
man from Ohio. Norman, we soon
learn, is a homosexual living with
a white lover in a nice New York
apartment. His father, Ben
Chambers, has sought out his son

for consolation against a shattered
male ego image.
Norman's mother, Beatrice, has
eloped to Canada with Ben's
brother. Ben is demoralized by
the knowledge that his wife would
leave him after twenty-nine years
of marriage. Ben's arrival at
Norman's apartment is ill-timed,
and catches Norman in bed with
his lover, Garson Hobart. Ben
sounds the buzzer to Norman's
apartment. While talking to his
father over the intercom, Norman
suddenly realizes the predicament
Ben will find him in if he admits
Ben into the building.
Quick Move
Stalling Ben he quickly gets the
reluctant Garson to pretend he is
a neighbor who came by to use
the restroom, his own being
inoperative. Ben is more
concerned about his wife leaving
him "for good," taking along the
family album, and, in the words
of Ben, "No woman takes the
whole family album on a fling."
Norman has forced Garson to
hide in the bedroom. When Ben
attempts to enter that room
Norman bars his way, implying
that he has a woman in there. Ben
understands this, for he tells
Norman that "When I was your
age, I was quite a gay blade,
myself."
Meanwhile, Garson, too
impatient to remain in the
bedroom, suddenly bursts into the
room in all of his "flaming"
gayness. Ben recoils on seeing this
"apparition," regarding Garson as
one would a highly contagious
disease.
Norman gets a moment to explain
to Garson his strategy for
gradually breaking in his father to
the truth. Ben plans to stay in

Norman's apartment, and Norman
persuades Garson to stay away
from the apartment until Ben can
be tactfully informed about
Norman's life-style. Garson is
hurt, but follows Norman's
suggestion.
Ben's suspicions are aroused by
his observation that Norman's
apartment is decorated like that
of a woman, but Ben is too busy
with his own problems to make
any connections. While trying to
reach his wife by telephone, he
slowly becomes aware that Garson
has returned and is packing a
suitcase, taking even the gown
Ben discovered in the closet and
thought to have belonged to
Norman's girlfriend. Garson's
reply just before dashing out of
the door is, "I am she." The truth
is out. Ben now realizes Norman is
"queer."

Though Ben learns the truth
about his son, he refuses to
believe it. After all, Norman walks
and talks like a man. He was good
at Little League baseball. Ben
consults books on the subject to
try and understand
homosexuality. He discovers that
many great men in history were

homosexual, yet, he cannot
understand Norman's being
"queer," for to Ben all
homosexuals are effeminate — like
G arson.
To prove to Norman that he
really is not that way he procures
a strikingly beautiful prostitute,
but Norman considers the gesture
an insult to his homosexual
integrity, and leaves. Ben, though
outdone by his son's lack of
gratitude, decides to take
advantage of his thirty-five dollar
purchase himself, and approaches
his task with all of the flair and
enthusiasm of one who is
convinced he is "God's gift to
women."
Later Garson returns to try and
make friends with Ben. After an
initial rejection Ben qualifies his
acceptance of him. They sleep in
separate rooms with the door

between them barred against
Garson's admittance into Ben's
room. During the night Ben has a
nightmare in which he becomes a
"flaming drag-queen." Ben and
Garson finally become
accustomed to each other, and
Ben tries to make a man of him
by procuring the same prostitute
— named Mary.
Garson and Mary hit it off fine
right off, but Garson refuses to
follow her into the bedroom.
Meanwhile, Ben's wife Beatrice
unexpectedly appears on the
scene. Ben doesn't want to see
her, but Garson does and admits
her into the building. Successfully
getting Garson out of the room,
Ben informs Beatrice that Norman
is homosexual.
Liberal Views
After her initial shock, Beatrice
assumes a liberal view that
Norman must lead his own life.
Ben doesn't agree; Norman must
be made into a man. Beatrice lets
Ben know that he is not the man
he thinks himself to be, either.
The play ends on a note of
tolerance with the attitude that
times are changing.
This play is not one of the best
written, but it is a refreshing
vehicle for viewing Black attitudes
in a manner offensive to no one.
Important to appreciating the
comic situation presented in this
play is the idea of the threat Black
men feel when confronted with
the spectre of homosexuality.
Ben's predicament is one in
which few Black men would wish
to find themselves. Santiago
Gonzales successfully plays Ben
with the painful awareness of this
threat.
Mike Sims as Norman and Kim
Allen as Garson play the lovers
almost too convincingly. Donna
DeCoudreaux's performance is
surpassed only by her
extraordinary beauty. Venus
Irving-Prescott's portrayal of
Beatrice is slightly hampered by
her over-theatricality. All-in-all,
this is a good show for those on
the town in North Beach in San
Francisco.
