Diplomat Freed For Ransom
GUADALAJARA, Mexico — An $80,000 ransom
was paid for the release of kidnaped U.S. Consul
General Terrance G. Leonhardy, a Mexican official
said yesterday.
Gov. Alberto Oro/.co Romero said the money
was delivered to the guerrilla kidnapers on Monday
to meet a 2 p.m. PDT deadline. The ransom money
was borrowed from a bank, and Leonhardy is
responsible for repayment of the loan, Orozco
Romero said.
The kidnapers apparently demanded the ransom
money in a telephone call to the diplomat's wife.
The money was an additional demand made by
the guerrillas. The Mexican government met initial
ransom demands of freedom and safe conduct to
Cuba for 30 persons jailed in Mexico.
'Thank God," were the 58-vear-old career
diplomat's first words as he entered his home
Wounded Knee Siege Ends
WOUNDED KNEE, S.D. - Federal officers fired
five volleys of gunshots from within Wounded Knee
yesterday to signal the end of the 70-day siege of
this historic hamlet.
The occupation had resulted in the deaths of two
insurgents and the wounding of nine persons,
including two federal officers.
The U.S. marshals and FBI agents who had stood
watch over the village since the Feb. 27 takeover,
often trading gunshots with the militant Indians
within, secured the four-square-mile area after the
insurgents laid down their weapons.
"The U.S. marshals are celebrating the retaking
of Wounded Knee," came the words over a police
radio network after the volley of shots from a
hillside near the Sacred Heart Roman Catholic
church.
Federal officers transported everyone from the
village and said permanent residents would be
allowed to return today after a thorough search for
weapons, explosives and "evidence of criminal
activity."
Deputy Asst. U.S. Atty. Gen. Richard Hellstern
complained that the agreement calling for
dispossesion of all weapons "has been violated.
They just turned in a lot of old crap, old shotguns
and rifles. The weapons turned in certainly were not
all the weapons in there."
Dean To Testify Before Senate
WASHINGTON — Ousted White House counsel
John W. Dean 111 will be subpoenaed and required
to testify before the Senate Watergate committee on
his reported claim that he can link President Nixon
to the scandal's coverup.

Dean will be granted immunity to gain his
testimony if he invokes his right against
self-incrimination.
Sen. Sam J. Ervin (D-N.C.), the committee
chairman, said yesterday he will not decide whether
to call the President to testify "until some reason to
call the President is known to exist."
White House press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler
was asked Tuesday whether a broad White House
denial of presidential involvement in Watergate was
intended to include a denial of awareness of any
coverup.
The statement, issued Monday with Nixon's
concurrence, had said "any suggestion that the
President participated in any coverup activity or
activities is untrue."
Ziegler said he could not go beyond the
statement, but added the language "was not chosen
to draw a distinction between participation and
awareness."
Proxmire Hits Press On Nixon
WASHINGTON — Sen. William Proxmire, a
frequent administration critic accused the press
today of trying to destroy President Nixon by
printing "disputed, unproven secret charges" against
him.
"The present, runaway tendency to rush into
headlines with disputed, unproven, secret charges
against the President is the press at its worst,"
Proxmire said.
Proxmire called recent Watergate reporting
"grossly unfair" to Nixon and said:
"As the senator who succeeded Joe McCarthy in
the United States Senate I find this kind of
prosecution and condemnation without trial
McCarthyism at its worst."
Proxmire referred specifically to widely
published reports of accusations in which former
White House counsel John W. Dean 111 was said to
have alleged Nixon knew of a Watergate coverup
inside the White House.
Dean, Proxmire said, is reported to be actively
seeking immunity from criminal prosecution for his
own actions in the case.
"When . . . Dean is reported throughout this
country to have privately told grand jury
investigators that the President was directly involved
in a Watergate coverup, President Nixon is being
tried, sentenced and executed by rumor and
allegation," Proxmire said.
Lebanon Ceasefire Announced
BEIRUT, Lebanon — President Suleiman Franjieh
ordered an immediate cease-fire last night and
announced talks aimed at enforcing an end to the

bloody fighting between government troops and
Palestinian guerrillas.
An official statement said a small exchange of
shooting that followed the cease-fire announcement
was "quickly contained."
Previous cease-fire efforts were frustrated when
fresh fighting broke out Monday night between the
two sides, both Arab.
The government has sought to control the
operations in Lebanon of the anti-Israeli guerrillas;
the guerrillas want freedom to act independently.
Franjieh cancelled strikes by warplanes that had
pounded guerrilla positions all day yesterday with
spectacular dive bombing seen by Beirut residents
from their balconies. In ordering the cease-fire, he
appealed for observance by both the army troops
and the guerrillas.
A broadcast of the president's order said it would
"give joint commissions a chance ... to start work
on assuring the enforcement of a final cease-fire."
Skylab Countdowns Begin
CAPE KENNEDY, Fla. — Twin countdowns start
this morning as workers prepare for the launches
next week of Skylab, the nation's first space station,
and of the three-man crew which will live aboard
the orbiting laboratory for 28 days.
The space station, a 118-foot craft packed with
scientific experiments, is scheduled for launch
Monday. A powerful Saturn 5 rocket will drill it
into a 270-mile-high orbit of the earth.
On Tuesday, astronaut Charles Conrad Jr., Paul
J. Weitz and Dr. Joseph P. Kerwin will ride a Saturn
IB rocket into space. They'll rendezvous and dock
with the unmanned Skylab seven hours later and
move into the space station the next day.
The lengthy twin countdowns begin at 2 a.m. as
power is allowed to surge into the Saturn 5 rocket,
the same type of booster used to send men to the
moon. Six hours later, the Saturn IB is powered up.

Skylab Countdowns Begin
CAPE KENNEDY, Fla. — Twin countdowns start
this morning as workers prepare for the launches
next week of Skylab, the nation's first space station,
and of the three-man crew which will live aboard
the orbiting laboratory for 28 days.
The space station, a 118-foot craft packed with
scientific experiments, is scheduled for launch
Monday. A powerful Saturn 5 rocket will drill it
into a 270-mile-high orbit of the earth.
On Tuesday, astronaut Charles Conrad Jr., Paul
J. Weitz and Dr. Joseph P. Kerwin will ride a Saturn
IB rocket into space. They'll rendezvous and dock
with the unmanned Skylab seven hours later and
move into the space station the next day.
The lengthy twin countdowns begin at 2 a.m. as
power is allowed to surge into the Saturn 5 rocket,
the same type of booster used to send men to the
moon. Six hours later, the Saturn IB is powered up.

Diplomat Freed For Ransom
GUADALAJARA, Mexico — An $80,000 ransom
was paid for the release of kidnaped U.S. Consul
General Terrance G. Leonhardy, a Mexican official
said yesterday.
Gov. Alberto Oro/.co Romero said the money
was delivered to the guerrilla kidnapers on Monday
to meet a 2 p.m. PDT deadline. The ransom money
was borrowed from a bank, and Leonhardy is
responsible for repayment of the loan, Orozco
Romero said.
The kidnapers apparently demanded the ransom
money in a telephone call to the diplomat's wife.
The money was an additional demand made by
the guerrillas. The Mexican government met initial
ransom demands of freedom and safe conduct to
Cuba for 30 persons jailed in Mexico.
'Thank God," were the 58-vear-old career
diplomat's first words as he entered his home
Wounded Knee Siege Ends
WOUNDED KNEE, S.D. - Federal officers fired
five volleys of gunshots from within Wounded Knee
yesterday to signal the end of the 70-day siege of
this historic hamlet.
The occupation had resulted in the deaths of two
insurgents and the wounding of nine persons,
including two federal officers.
The U.S. marshals and FBI agents who had stood
watch over the village since the Feb. 27 takeover,
often trading gunshots with the militant Indians
within, secured the four-square-mile area after the
insurgents laid down their weapons.
"The U.S. marshals are celebrating the retaking
of Wounded Knee," came the words over a police
radio network after the volley of shots from a
hillside near the Sacred Heart Roman Catholic
church.
Federal officers transported everyone from the
village and said permanent residents would be
allowed to return today after a thorough search for
weapons, explosives and "evidence of criminal
activity."
Deputy Asst. U.S. Atty. Gen. Richard Hellstern
complained that the agreement calling for
dispossesion of all weapons "has been violated.
They just turned in a lot of old crap, old shotguns
and rifles. The weapons turned in certainly were not
all the weapons in there."
Dean To Testify Before Senate
WASHINGTON — Ousted White House counsel
John W. Dean 111 will be subpoenaed and required
to testify before the Senate Watergate committee on
his reported claim that he can link President Nixon
to the scandal's coverup.

Dean will be granted immunity to gain his
testimony if he invokes his right against
self-incrimination.
Sen. Sam J. Ervin (D-N.C.), the committee
chairman, said yesterday he will not decide whether
to call the President to testify "until some reason to
call the President is known to exist."
White House press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler
was asked Tuesday whether a broad White House
denial of presidential involvement in Watergate was
intended to include a denial of awareness of any
coverup.
The statement, issued Monday with Nixon's
concurrence, had said "any suggestion that the
President participated in any coverup activity or
activities is untrue."
Ziegler said he could not go beyond the
statement, but added the language "was not chosen
to draw a distinction between participation and
awareness."
Proxmire Hits Press On Nixon
WASHINGTON — Sen. William Proxmire, a
frequent administration critic accused the press
today of trying to destroy President Nixon by
printing "disputed, unproven secret charges" against
him.
"The present, runaway tendency to rush into
headlines with disputed, unproven, secret charges
against the President is the press at its worst,"
Proxmire said.
Proxmire called recent Watergate reporting
"grossly unfair" to Nixon and said:
"As the senator who succeeded Joe McCarthy in
the United States Senate I find this kind of
prosecution and condemnation without trial
McCarthyism at its worst."
Proxmire referred specifically to widely
published reports of accusations in which former
White House counsel John W. Dean 111 was said to
have alleged Nixon knew of a Watergate coverup
inside the White House.
Dean, Proxmire said, is reported to be actively
seeking immunity from criminal prosecution for his
own actions in the case.
"When . . . Dean is reported throughout this
country to have privately told grand jury
investigators that the President was directly involved
in a Watergate coverup, President Nixon is being
tried, sentenced and executed by rumor and
allegation," Proxmire said.

Dean To Testify Before Senate
WASHINGTON — Ousted White House counsel
John W. Dean 111 will be subpoenaed and required
to testify before the Senate Watergate committee on
his reported claim that he can link President Nixon
to the scandal's coverup.

Dean will be granted immunity to gain his
testimony if he invokes his right against
self-incrimination.
Sen. Sam J. Ervin (D-N.C.), the committee
chairman, said yesterday he will not decide whether
to call the President to testify "until some reason to
call the President is known to exist."
White House press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler
was asked Tuesday whether a broad White House
denial of presidential involvement in Watergate was
intended to include a denial of awareness of any
coverup.
The statement, issued Monday with Nixon's
concurrence, had said "any suggestion that the
President participated in any coverup activity or
activities is untrue."
Ziegler said he could not go beyond the
statement, but added the language "was not chosen
to draw a distinction between participation and
awareness."
Proxmire Hits Press On Nixon
WASHINGTON — Sen. William Proxmire, a
frequent administration critic accused the press
today of trying to destroy President Nixon by
printing "disputed, unproven secret charges" against
him.
"The present, runaway tendency to rush into
headlines with disputed, unproven, secret charges
against the President is the press at its worst,"
Proxmire said.
Proxmire called recent Watergate reporting
"grossly unfair" to Nixon and said:
"As the senator who succeeded Joe McCarthy in
the United States Senate I find this kind of
prosecution and condemnation without trial
McCarthyism at its worst."
Proxmire referred specifically to widely
published reports of accusations in which former
White House counsel John W. Dean 111 was said to
have alleged Nixon knew of a Watergate coverup
inside the White House.
Dean, Proxmire said, is reported to be actively
seeking immunity from criminal prosecution for his
own actions in the case.
"When . . . Dean is reported throughout this
country to have privately told grand jury
investigators that the President was directly involved
in a Watergate coverup, President Nixon is being
tried, sentenced and executed by rumor and
allegation," Proxmire said.
Lebanon Ceasefire Announced
BEIRUT, Lebanon — President Suleiman Franjieh
ordered an immediate cease-fire last night and
announced talks aimed at enforcing an end to the

bloody fighting between government troops and
Palestinian guerrillas.
An official statement said a small exchange of
shooting that followed the cease-fire announcement
was "quickly contained."
Previous cease-fire efforts were frustrated when
fresh fighting broke out Monday night between the
two sides, both Arab.
The government has sought to control the
operations in Lebanon of the anti-Israeli guerrillas;
the guerrillas want freedom to act independently.
Franjieh cancelled strikes by warplanes that had
pounded guerrilla positions all day yesterday with
spectacular dive bombing seen by Beirut residents
from their balconies. In ordering the cease-fire, he
appealed for observance by both the army troops
and the guerrillas.
A broadcast of the president's order said it would
"give joint commissions a chance ... to start work
on assuring the enforcement of a final cease-fire."
Skylab Countdowns Begin
CAPE KENNEDY, Fla. — Twin countdowns start
this morning as workers prepare for the launches
next week of Skylab, the nation's first space station,
and of the three-man crew which will live aboard
the orbiting laboratory for 28 days.
The space station, a 118-foot craft packed with
scientific experiments, is scheduled for launch
Monday. A powerful Saturn 5 rocket will drill it
into a 270-mile-high orbit of the earth.
On Tuesday, astronaut Charles Conrad Jr., Paul
J. Weitz and Dr. Joseph P. Kerwin will ride a Saturn
IB rocket into space. They'll rendezvous and dock
with the unmanned Skylab seven hours later and
move into the space station the next day.
The lengthy twin countdowns begin at 2 a.m. as
power is allowed to surge into the Saturn 5 rocket,
the same type of booster used to send men to the
moon. Six hours later, the Saturn IB is powered up.

Diplomat Freed For Ransom
GUADALAJARA, Mexico — An $80,000 ransom
was paid for the release of kidnaped U.S. Consul
General Terrance G. Leonhardy, a Mexican official
said yesterday.
Gov. Alberto Oro/.co Romero said the money
was delivered to the guerrilla kidnapers on Monday
to meet a 2 p.m. PDT deadline. The ransom money
was borrowed from a bank, and Leonhardy is
responsible for repayment of the loan, Orozco
Romero said.
The kidnapers apparently demanded the ransom
money in a telephone call to the diplomat's wife.
The money was an additional demand made by
the guerrillas. The Mexican government met initial
ransom demands of freedom and safe conduct to
Cuba for 30 persons jailed in Mexico.
'Thank God," were the 58-vear-old career
diplomat's first words as he entered his home
Wounded Knee Siege Ends
WOUNDED KNEE, S.D. - Federal officers fired
five volleys of gunshots from within Wounded Knee
yesterday to signal the end of the 70-day siege of
this historic hamlet.
The occupation had resulted in the deaths of two
insurgents and the wounding of nine persons,
including two federal officers.
The U.S. marshals and FBI agents who had stood
watch over the village since the Feb. 27 takeover,
often trading gunshots with the militant Indians
within, secured the four-square-mile area after the
insurgents laid down their weapons.
"The U.S. marshals are celebrating the retaking
of Wounded Knee," came the words over a police
radio network after the volley of shots from a
hillside near the Sacred Heart Roman Catholic
church.
Federal officers transported everyone from the
village and said permanent residents would be
allowed to return today after a thorough search for
weapons, explosives and "evidence of criminal
activity."
Deputy Asst. U.S. Atty. Gen. Richard Hellstern
complained that the agreement calling for
dispossesion of all weapons "has been violated.
They just turned in a lot of old crap, old shotguns
and rifles. The weapons turned in certainly were not
all the weapons in there."
