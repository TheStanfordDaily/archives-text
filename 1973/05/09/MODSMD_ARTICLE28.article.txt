# ASSU Senate Fixes Assessment Mistake
## 
### SUE KING 
At its next-to-last meeting of the
year last night, the ASSU Senate
"recovered" approximately $11,000
for the ASSU Special Events Board
budget, elected a new member to the
Nominations Committee, and
postponed debate on next year's
proposed ASSU budget until the final
meeting on May 29.
The Senate voted to request that
University President Richard Lyman
approve the collection of a $1 fee
assessment for the Special Events
Board next autumn.
The assessment was originally
passed by the students in last autumn's
ASSU Senate election. It called for the
collection of $1 both winter and
spring quarters this year to fund the
Special Events Board.
The assessment appeared on
registration permits for winter quarter,
but not for spring quarter.
According to Senate President
Rocky Barber, the mixup occurred
because of the informality of the
election results sent to Lyman for
approval.

The results sent to Lyman indicated
that the assessment should be
collected winter quarter but did not
mention collection of the assessment
spring quarter.
Barber said that because students
are not allowed to see permits before
they are printed, the omission of the
Special Events assessment was not
discovered until advance registration
for spring quarter.
In a roll call vote, Sen. Tom Flohr
was elected to the Nominations
Committee over Randy Smith, a first
year law student.
The roll call vote was called for by
Sen. David Levine after an earlier
motion made by Sen. Dan Fitch
requesting secret ballots for the
election was turned down by the
Senate.
Fitch said that he had requested the
ballot vote because of the "pressure of
being friends with the candidates."
The Nominations Committee will
begin screening student applicants for
next year's committees soon.
