# Beaty Tells Of Chino Conspiracy, Describes Bay Area Hide-Outs
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Convict Ronald Wayne Beaty has
completed four days of direct
testimony in the murder trial of
Andrea Holman Burt and Benton
Douglas Burt, telling of a conspiracy
to free him from a Chino prison and to
conceal him after the Oct. 6 escape
incident which left one prison guard
dead and another wounded.
Beaty named the Burts in his
account of the escape when he first
took the witness stand last week.
Yesterday and Monday he told the
court of a Los Altos house and other
locations where he met with
conspirators during the two months he
spent as a fugitive.
Andrea Burt, daughter of Medicine
Prof. Halsted Holman, and her
husband face charges of murder,
assault, and freeing a prisoner. Two
others, former Venceremos member
Jean Hobson and accused
"trigger-man" Robert Seabock, face
similar charges in a separate trial.
San Bernardino Superior Court
Judge Thomas Haldorsen ruled
Monday that Beaty may testify in the
Burts' trial about the time he spent in
hiding, despite objections from
defense attorney Charles Garry that
the Burts were not involved in that
aspect of the escape.
The judge permitted the testimony
on prosecutor Joseph D. Canty's
argument that the Burts were part of a
conspiracy that planned and executed

the ambush and also concealed him
after he escaped.
Aftermath
Beaty testified about the Burts'
involvement in his escape, but said he
separated from them after the
shooting and didn't see them again
until his court appearance.
After driving with the Burts to
Gilroy, Beaty got into a car with
Hobson and triggerman Seabock.
Beaty claimed he asked Seabock why
they fired at the unarmed men and
that Seabock simply smiled and
answered "no witnesses."
The trio reached a Los Altos home
about 11 p.m. on the day of the
ambush. Seabock did not stay at the
house, but drove away with material
used in the escape including wigs,
handcuffs, and Beaty's jacket, Beaty
said.
Los Altos Hide-Out
Beaty and Hobson stayed at the
dwelling at 27544 Canyon Road, just
outside the Los Altos Hills city limits.
Sylvia Stead, the occupant of the
house, later rented a car for them,
Beaty testified.
Stead, who has refused to comment
on Beaty's allegations, was not
included in a group arrested last
December and charged with harboring
Beaty. Those four persons, including
fired English Prof. Bruce Franklin and
Hobson, were subsequently released
when the charges were dropped.
On the morning after the escape,
Beaty continued, Hobson's daughter

Becky appeared at the house and then
left to "go get Bruce." He said he then
accompanied Hobson and her son
Bruce to a remote cabin in San Mateo
County where he stayed with a young
couple identified as Milton and Laura
Traulbee.
Cabin Refuge
The Traulbees were jailed for a
short time earlier this year when they
were charged with contempt of court
for refusing to testify before a federal
grand jury investigating the escape case
in San Francisco.
Beaty also told the jury that the
Hobsons provided him with false
identification papers while he hid out
at the cabin. He reported that Seabock
had an arsenal in his Palo Alto house,
including a submachine gun which was
kept near the front door. Beaty said he
noticed the weapons when he stayed
at Seabock's home for four days.
Beaty related that he and Hobson
drove to Bakersfield in a car rented for
them by Stead in an attempt to find a
cache of dynamite buried on the
outskirts of the city.
The dynamite was unearthed by
authorities four months ago. They
were led to the site by information
Beaty provided after he was
recaptured, convicted of murder, and
turned state's evidence.
Garry will begin cross-examining
Beaty when court convenes this
afternoon. The defense has repeatedly
stressed that it will attack Beaty's
credibility as a witness.

testimony in the murder trial of
Andrea Holman Burt and Benton
Douglas Burt, telling of a conspiracy
to free him from a Chino prison and to
conceal him after the Oct. 6 escape
incident which left one prison guard
dead and another wounded.
Beaty named the Burts in his
account of the escape when he first
took the witness stand last week.
Yesterday and Monday he told the
court of a Los Altos house and other
locations where he met with
conspirators during the two months he
spent as a fugitive.
Andrea Burt, daughter of Medicine
Prof. Halsted Holman, and her
husband face charges of murder,
assault, and freeing a prisoner. Two
others, former Venceremos member
Jean Hobson and accused
"trigger-man" Robert Seabock, face
similar charges in a separate trial.
San Bernardino Superior Court
Judge Thomas Haldorsen ruled
Monday that Beaty may testify in the
Burts' trial about the time he spent in
hiding, despite objections from
defense attorney Charles Garry that
the Burts were not involved in that
aspect of the escape.
The judge permitted the testimony
on prosecutor Joseph D. Canty's
argument that the Burts were part of a
conspiracy that planned and executed

the ambush and also concealed him
after he escaped.
Aftermath
Beaty testified about the Burts'
involvement in his escape, but said he
separated from them after the
shooting and didn't see them again
until his court appearance.
After driving with the Burts to
Gilroy, Beaty got into a car with
Hobson and triggerman Seabock.
Beaty claimed he asked Seabock why
they fired at the unarmed men and
that Seabock simply smiled and
answered "no witnesses."
The trio reached a Los Altos home
about 11 p.m. on the day of the
ambush. Seabock did not stay at the
house, but drove away with material
used in the escape including wigs,
handcuffs, and Beaty's jacket, Beaty
said.
Los Altos Hide-Out
Beaty and Hobson stayed at the
dwelling at 27544 Canyon Road, just
outside the Los Altos Hills city limits.
Sylvia Stead, the occupant of the
house, later rented a car for them,
Beaty testified.
Stead, who has refused to comment
on Beaty's allegations, was not
included in a group arrested last
December and charged with harboring
Beaty. Those four persons, including
fired English Prof. Bruce Franklin and
Hobson, were subsequently released
when the charges were dropped.
On the morning after the escape,
Beaty continued, Hobson's daughter

Becky appeared at the house and then
left to "go get Bruce." He said he then
accompanied Hobson and her son
Bruce to a remote cabin in San Mateo
County where he stayed with a young
couple identified as Milton and Laura
Traulbee.
Cabin Refuge
The Traulbees were jailed for a
short time earlier this year when they
were charged with contempt of court
for refusing to testify before a federal
grand jury investigating the escape case
in San Francisco.
Beaty also told the jury that the
Hobsons provided him with false
identification papers while he hid out
at the cabin. He reported that Seabock
had an arsenal in his Palo Alto house,
including a submachine gun which was
kept near the front door. Beaty said he
noticed the weapons when he stayed
at Seabock's home for four days.
Beaty related that he and Hobson
drove to Bakersfield in a car rented for
them by Stead in an attempt to find a
cache of dynamite buried on the
outskirts of the city.
The dynamite was unearthed by
authorities four months ago. They
were led to the site by information
Beaty provided after he was
recaptured, convicted of murder, and
turned state's evidence.
Garry will begin cross-examining
Beaty when court convenes this
afternoon. The defense has repeatedly
stressed that it will attack Beaty's
credibility as a witness.
