# 5-4 City Council Edge Kept By Liberal Group
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
The liberal Association for a
Balanced Community (ABC) held on
to its 5-4 majority on the Palo Alto
City Council in yesterday's election
for six Council seats.
Stanford Law Prof. Byron Sher, a
former Councilman trying a comeback
under ABC's banner, led the
16-candidate field for five four-year
terms on the Council.
The other winners of four-year
terms were incumbents — ABC's
Mayor Kirke Comstock and John
Beahrs, John Berwald, and Stanley
Norton of the more conservative Palo
Alto '73 (PA73).
Elected to a two-year term on the
Council was Roy Clay of PA73, who
becomes the first black Councilman in
Palo Alto history.
Incumbent Defeated
One incumbent was defeated —
Sylvia Seman of ABC, who was
appointed to the Council in 1971 and
was seeking election in her own right.
Candidates of the radical Palo Alto
Community Coalition (PACC) ran far
behind the ABC and PA73 candidates.

Two independent candidates also
made a weak showing.
Beahrs, the most conservative
councilman, narrowly held off
psychiatrist Allan Seid of ABC, a
newcomer to city politics, for the fifth
and final four-year term.
Narrow Victory
Clay narrowly defeated Emily
Renzel, also a newcomer to politics, in
a 2-candidate race for the two-year
term.
In his campaign, Sher stressed his
strong environmental record during his
previous service on the Council, but he
also insisted that he would be best able
to control council meeting disruptions,
based on his experience on the
University Human Relations
Commission and employee grievance
panels.
He also noted that his position as a
faculty member independent of
Stanford's business and financial
offices would make him an ideal
liaison between Palo Alto and
Stanford on questions of development
of University land.
Sher said last night that "even

though I work at Stanford, my first
obligation as a Councilman will be to
the city. On specific issues, I'll have to
look at what's best for Palo Alto."
As he had during the campaign, he
expressed confidence that he would be
able to help Stanford and Palo Alto
work together.
He credited his top vote total to "a
broad base of support" including both
the liberal groups he had been
affiliated with in the past, and
organizations such as the city peace
officers' and firefighters' association.
He also gave credit to the Palo Alto
Times endorsement.
Recall
Sher served on the Council from
1965 to 1967. In the latter year, he
was one of four liberal Councilmen
removed from office in a stormy recall
election fought over the issue of
commercial and industrial
development.
The election leaves ABC's 5-4
majority on the Council intact, as Sher
joins Comstock, Enid Pearson, Alan
Henderson, and Richard Rosenbaum
as an ABC member on the
nine-member body.
Clay, Beahrs, Berwald, and Norton
will form the four-man minority, with
Clay replacing Dr. William H. Clark,
who did not seek re-election.
The campaign was lackluster by
comparison with previous Palo Alto
Council campaigns. The principal issue
appeared to be the same as in previous
years — additional commercial-indus
trial development backed by PA73
versus a greater ABC commitment
toward maintaining the city's
residential character.
The candidates on both slates
denied repeatedly that this issue was
still a factor in Palo Alto politics, but
paid much attention to it nevertheless.
There were exceptions to the
pattern of slate cohesion.

appeared to be the same as in previous
years — additional commercial-indus
trial development backed by PA73
versus a greater ABC commitment
toward maintaining the city's
residential character.
The candidates on both slates
denied repeatedly that this issue was
still a factor in Palo Alto politics, but
paid much attention to it nevertheless.
There were exceptions to the
pattern of slate cohesion.
The liberal Association for a
Balanced Community (ABC) held on
to its 5-4 majority on the Palo Alto
City Council in yesterday's election
for six Council seats.
Stanford Law Prof. Byron Sher, a
former Councilman trying a comeback
under ABC's banner, led the
16-candidate field for five four-year
terms on the Council.
The other winners of four-year
terms were incumbents — ABC's
Mayor Kirke Comstock and John
Beahrs, John Berwald, and Stanley
Norton of the more conservative Palo
Alto '73 (PA73).
Elected to a two-year term on the
Council was Roy Clay of PA73, who
becomes the first black Councilman in
Palo Alto history.
Incumbent Defeated
One incumbent was defeated —
Sylvia Seman of ABC, who was
appointed to the Council in 1971 and
was seeking election in her own right.
Candidates of the radical Palo Alto
Community Coalition (PACC) ran far
behind the ABC and PA73 candidates.

Two independent candidates also
made a weak showing.
Beahrs, the most conservative
councilman, narrowly held off
psychiatrist Allan Seid of ABC, a
newcomer to city politics, for the fifth
and final four-year term.
Narrow Victory
Clay narrowly defeated Emily
Renzel, also a newcomer to politics, in
a 2-candidate race for the two-year
term.
In his campaign, Sher stressed his
strong environmental record during his
previous service on the Council, but he
also insisted that he would be best able
to control council meeting disruptions,
based on his experience on the
University Human Relations
Commission and employee grievance
panels.
He also noted that his position as a
faculty member independent of
Stanford's business and financial
offices would make him an ideal
liaison between Palo Alto and
Stanford on questions of development
of University land.
Sher said last night that "even

though I work at Stanford, my first
obligation as a Councilman will be to
the city. On specific issues, I'll have to
look at what's best for Palo Alto."
As he had during the campaign, he
expressed confidence that he would be
able to help Stanford and Palo Alto
work together.
He credited his top vote total to "a
broad base of support" including both
the liberal groups he had been
affiliated with in the past, and
organizations such as the city peace
officers' and firefighters' association.
He also gave credit to the Palo Alto
Times endorsement.
Recall
Sher served on the Council from
1965 to 1967. In the latter year, he
was one of four liberal Councilmen
removed from office in a stormy recall
election fought over the issue of
commercial and industrial
development.
The election leaves ABC's 5-4
majority on the Council intact, as Sher
joins Comstock, Enid Pearson, Alan
Henderson, and Richard Rosenbaum
as an ABC member on the
nine-member body.
Clay, Beahrs, Berwald, and Norton
will form the four-man minority, with
Clay replacing Dr. William H. Clark,
who did not seek re-election.
The campaign was lackluster by
comparison with previous Palo Alto
Council campaigns. The principal issue
appeared to be the same as in previous
years — additional commercial-indus
trial development backed by PA73
versus a greater ABC commitment
toward maintaining the city's
residential character.
