# USE Leader 'Optimistic' About June Ballot
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
United Stanford Employees (USE) President Glenda
Jones yesterday expressed optimism that 1600
University employees will vote to be represented by
her group in a June 6 election.
Jones' statements on KZSU's "Campus Conference"
last night came in the wake of the withdrawal of
Stanford Joint Council from the National Labor
Relations Board sponsored election.
"A lot of things have happened since last year,"
Jones said, referring to a similar 1972 election in which
USE was defeated.
"The layoffs at the Med Center and especially at
SLAC [Stanford Linear Accelerator Center] have had a
big effect in changing people's views about job
security."
Another factor which will help USE, Jones
continued, is that organizations which opposed the
group last year will noft be on the ballot this year.
Picked Up Support
"USE is growing," she said, although she could not
give a specific membership figure "We've picked up a
lot of former Teamster, SEA [Stanford Employees
Association], and 'no union' supporters from last
year."
Jones also characterized former supporters of the
Stanford Joint Council as having a "traditional trade
union background " She said that most of them "will
swing over to us."
The Joint Council is composed of Local Three of
the Operating Engineers and Local 101 of the
American Federation of State, County, and Municipal
Employees ( AFSCME ), both AFL-CIO members.
Jones predicted the Joint Council would not oppose
USE in the upcoming election, and said AFSCME
organizer Don Mowery told her "you've got a straight
shot at it now."
With the Joint Council out of the election, the only
opposition to USE will come "from management — the

University administration. Instead of running the show
they will have to talk to the workers if we're elected,"
Jones said.
Jones also outlined the reasons why USE affiliated
with the Service Employees International Union
(SEIU) of the AFL-CIO recently, citing theSElU's
widespread jurisdiction, its experience with the type of
job classifications Stanford workers have, and allowing
autonomy to its locals.
SEIU Support
SEIU, according to Jones "will provide sessions for
training union organizers," and also give monetary
support and bargaining expertise.
In response to the question "what's in it for
SEIU?", Jones noted that eventually USE hopes to
organize over 6000 campus employees, who would
become SEIU dues-paying members. Winning the
current election, she maintained, is "only the
beginning."
Should USE win on June 6, the next step would be
negotiating a bargaining agreement with the University.
First Step
The first step in negotiating such an agreement,
according to Jones, is to find out what the persons in
the bargaining unit want. "Right now we're conducting
a survey of people in the unit, to find out what issues
people think are important."
Earlier in the interview, Jones explained USE's
history. The group was formed after a split in SEA
membership in 1969, in part because "SEA leadership
was against the student antiwar movement."
Because of this history, Jones was asked if she
thought USE's tie-ins with members of the Maoist
Venceremos organization would hurt the union in the
elections, as it apparently did last year.
"I think over the years USE has consistently
focused on labor issues," Jones said. "We don't deny
that our members have particular political beliefs but
there's room in USE for every point of view."

discussed — rather happily — the Stanford Joint Council's withdrawal from the
upcoming NLRB election.
United Stanford Employees (USE) President Glenda
Jones yesterday expressed optimism that 1600
University employees will vote to be represented by
her group in a June 6 election.
Jones' statements on KZSU's "Campus Conference"
last night came in the wake of the withdrawal of
Stanford Joint Council from the National Labor
Relations Board sponsored election.
"A lot of things have happened since last year,"
Jones said, referring to a similar 1972 election in which
USE was defeated.
"The layoffs at the Med Center and especially at
SLAC [Stanford Linear Accelerator Center] have had a
big effect in changing people's views about job
security."
Another factor which will help USE, Jones
continued, is that organizations which opposed the
group last year will noft be on the ballot this year.
Picked Up Support
"USE is growing," she said, although she could not
give a specific membership figure "We've picked up a
lot of former Teamster, SEA [Stanford Employees
Association], and 'no union' supporters from last
year."
Jones also characterized former supporters of the
Stanford Joint Council as having a "traditional trade
union background " She said that most of them "will
swing over to us."
The Joint Council is composed of Local Three of
the Operating Engineers and Local 101 of the
American Federation of State, County, and Municipal
Employees ( AFSCME ), both AFL-CIO members.
Jones predicted the Joint Council would not oppose
USE in the upcoming election, and said AFSCME
organizer Don Mowery told her "you've got a straight
shot at it now."
With the Joint Council out of the election, the only
opposition to USE will come "from management — the

University administration. Instead of running the show
they will have to talk to the workers if we're elected,"
Jones said.
Jones also outlined the reasons why USE affiliated
with the Service Employees International Union
(SEIU) of the AFL-CIO recently, citing theSElU's
widespread jurisdiction, its experience with the type of
job classifications Stanford workers have, and allowing
autonomy to its locals.
SEIU Support
SEIU, according to Jones "will provide sessions for
training union organizers," and also give monetary
support and bargaining expertise.
In response to the question "what's in it for
SEIU?", Jones noted that eventually USE hopes to
organize over 6000 campus employees, who would
become SEIU dues-paying members. Winning the
current election, she maintained, is "only the
beginning."
Should USE win on June 6, the next step would be
negotiating a bargaining agreement with the University.
First Step
The first step in negotiating such an agreement,
according to Jones, is to find out what the persons in
the bargaining unit want. "Right now we're conducting
a survey of people in the unit, to find out what issues
people think are important."
Earlier in the interview, Jones explained USE's
history. The group was formed after a split in SEA
membership in 1969, in part because "SEA leadership
was against the student antiwar movement."
Because of this history, Jones was asked if she
thought USE's tie-ins with members of the Maoist
Venceremos organization would hurt the union in the
elections, as it apparently did last year.
"I think over the years USE has consistently
focused on labor issues," Jones said. "We don't deny
that our members have particular political beliefs but
there's room in USE for every point of view."
