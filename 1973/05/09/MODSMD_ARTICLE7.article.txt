## Watergate Affair 
### 
The implication of close confidants of President Nixon in
the planning and subsequent attempts at concealment of the
Watergate bugging indicates a certain degree of moral
bankruptcy within the Executive Branch.
When we endorsed George McGovern for president last
November, we voiced our suspicion "that aides high in the
White House staff played key roles" in the Watergate caper.
It now appears that these suspicions have been confirmed.
Testimony by convicted Watergate conspirators James W.
McCord Jr. and E. Howard Hunt Jr. has apparently tied
former Attorney General John N. Mitchell, former White
House aide Jeb Stuart Magruder and fired Counsel to the
President JohnW. Dean 111 to the planning of the Watergate
bugging. Magruder himself has reportedly implicated
Mitchell and Dean.
In denying that he approved the caper, Mitchell is
reported to have said he suspected that someone over his
head at the White House had given the conspirators a
go-ahead on their plans without his knowledge. Presumably,
this would indicate that Mitchell suspects resigned
Presidential Assistants H.R. Haldeman and John D.
Ehrlichman.
Reports have linked both Haldeman and Ehrlichman to
elaborate attempts to conceal those responsible for the
bugging. According to The Washington Post, each of the
seven convicted Watergate conspirators had received at least
SIOOO a month after their conviction to remain silent.
McCord reportedly received $3000 a month for his silence.
Mitchell admitted approving payments to the seven after
their conviction, but insisted that the money was intended
to defray their legal expenses. He also said Dean and
Frederick C. Laßue, Mitchell's special assistant in the
Nixon campaign, had taken part in making payments to the
conspirators.
Federal grand jury indictments of Mitchell, Haldeman,
Ehrlichman, Dean, Magruder and Laßue appear likely, with
possible charges ranging from obstruction of justice to
conspiracy to commit wiretapping.
All of this brings us to President Nixon, who claimed last
Monday that, up until March 21, he had "discounted the
stories in the press that appeared to implicate members of
my administration and other officials of the campaign
com mittee."
If the President did not know in advance of the bugging
or the ensuing coverup attempts, he must be either quite
naive or entirely too isolated from even his most trusted
advisers.
If Nixon did have prior knowledge of the bugging, then
he has illegally withheld evidence of a crime. If he either
knew about or participated in the efforts to conceal the
truth behind the scandal (which Dean has said he did), then
the President is guilty of a gross abuse of his office, and
ought to be censured or removed from office.
In any case, it is clear that Nixon has exercised
exceedingly poor judgment in choosing his confidants. Men
who seem to have placed loyalty to the President above
obedience of the law have no place in the government.
We join with the President in insisting that the guilty be
brought to justice. Mitchell, Haldeman, Ehrlichman and the
others should be treated no better and no worse than any
other person suspected of committing a serious crime.
Watergate is among the most serious and pervasive
scandals in the history of American politics. The scandal
must be cleaned up as rapidly and justly as possible.
