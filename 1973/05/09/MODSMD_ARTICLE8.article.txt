# 'Direct Action' Needed
## Ominous Violence Cure 
### 
Karin Borgh, Cathy Lane

Beginning early in this year,
rumors of a new center for the
study of violent behavior, to be
implemented through UCLA,
began circulating among those
concerned with prison conditions.
People had good reason to be
alarmed, for the use of
psycho-surgery, extensive drug
therapy, electronic
experimentation on the brain, and
intensive forms of behavior
modification on incarcerated
individuals has been the focus of
discussions (concerning
treatment) among prison officials
and many of the doctors affiliated
with prison research.
As one example, START
Special Treatment and
Rehabilitative Training, a program
at the Federal Medical Facility in
Springfield, Missouri, promotes
behavioral and attitudinal changes
for those who cannot conform to
established prison regulations by
employing direct electrical
stimulation of the brain as a
punishment, or escape from
electrical shock as a primary
enforcer. (National Lawyers'
Guild â€” Up Against the Bench,
Feb., 1973.)
By March, the Committee
Opposing Psychiatric Abuse of
Prisoners, COPAP, a group of
psychiatrists and lawyers with its
headquarters in Oakland, had
located the formal California
Health and Welfare Agency
proposal for the UCLA center.
This proposal, entitled, "The
Center for the Reduction of Life
Threatening Behavior" (now being
called 'The Center for the Study
and Reduction of Violence"), has
all-encompassing goals, and as

stated in the proposals "will
explore the causation,
identification, control, and
reduction of those individual and
social factors which contribute to
violent behavior."
Prior Treatment
It should be noted that a major
goal is to devise methods by
which to identify and treat people
before they are known to have
committed a violent . act.
Furthermore, the emphasis is
clearly on the study of individual
behavior and not on the society
which so strongly affects the likes
of individuals.
These goals will be developed
through the proposed
investigation "of genetic,
biochemical, neurological, and
neurophysiological elements of
life threatening behavior," and
will be fulfilled by the
formulation of several modes of
implementation. One of these
modes will be, "The
demonstration and incorporation
of preventive models into public
school programs, law enforcement
activities, governmental actions,
and private organizations."
After attending a public
hearing in Sacramento concerned
with the funding of this project, it
became clear to us that its
representatives, Dr. L.J. West,
UCLA, Dr. Robert Litman,
UCLA, and Mr. J.M. Stubblebine,
State Health Director, were not
about to be specific about the
kinds of research which would be
done, or the subjects who would
be involved. We do know that
Atascadero and Camarillo State
Hospitals, as well as Vacaville
Medical Facility and all California

Correctional Facilities are cited as
locations to be used for the
development of treatments for
violent behavior.
Mr. Stubblebine has publicly
admitted that the use of
psychosurgery, and "clockwork
orange" type "cures" has not
been ruled out. Given the very
nature of forced "rehabilitation"
in these California institutions,
this becomes even more a cause
for concern. Finally, as Edward
Opton, member of COPAP, states,
"Our committee is concerned not
only with any possible revival of
the prison psychosurgery project,
but also, and even more strongly
with the ultimately much more
serious problems of mass
psychological testing and
biological screening for purposes
of social and/or political control "
Funding is still under
consideration by the Health and
Welfare Committee of the State
Senate, and there will be another
public hearing in Sacramento May
9, 1973, at 3 p.m., before any
legal action takes place. People are
encouraged to call us at Synergy
House, 327-9753, and to attend
the Conference on Political
Prisoners at Home and Abroad,
Thursday of this week, and
Thursday, May 10, 7:30 at Bishop
Auditorium.
It has become clear that direct
action must be taken: the reality
of such proposals as they relate to
present prison conditions, and to
the prospects of the future for us
all, demands immediate response.
