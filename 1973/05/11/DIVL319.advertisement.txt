WOULD YOU BELIEVE?
Ted Tarson, a planning executive from Grandview, N.Y., on
Friday, May 4, was declared the winner of the "Shower of
Money" contest on NBC-TV's "The Who, What or Where Game."
Tarson qualified as the winner by accumulating the highest
daily money total — $1,200 — as a contestant during the week of
April 30-May 4.
As his prize, Tarson (on the show to be colorcast May 14) will
enter a booth into which two barracks bags filled with bills of
various denominations will be poured by the program's
announcer, Mike Darow. While host Art James offers
encouragement, Tarson will attempt in 60 seconds to slip as many
bills — one at a time — as he can through a hole in the booth into
a box placed outside.
Tarson will keep all the bills he manages to pass into the box.
As the "Shower of Money" winner, he also will receive a weekend
for two at a Las Vegas Hotel.
