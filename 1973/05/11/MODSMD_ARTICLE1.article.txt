From The Associated Press
NEW YORK — Former Atty. Gen.
John N. Mitchell, former Commerce
Secretary' Maurice H. Stans and two
corporate officials were indicted
yesterday on charges of conspiring to
arrange a secret .$200,000 contribution
to the Nixon re-election campaign last
year.
The others named as defendants in
the 16-count indictment returned by a
federal grand jury were a New Jersey
Republican leader, Harry L. Sears, and
Robert L. Vesco, 37, former board
chairman of International Controls
Corp. Vesco made the donation, which
was later returned by the Nixon
campaign.
The Nixon committee also returned
to Vesco another $50,000 which he
had contributed openly through the
New Jersey campaign committee,
headed by Sears.
Vesco was under investigation by
the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) at the time of the
contribution.
Obstruction Of Justice
All four were charged with
conspiracy to defraud the federal
government, obstruction of justice,
and obstruction of a criminal
investigation.
In addition, Mitchell and Stans
were each accused of six counts of
perjury.
"There has been no wrongdoing on
my part," Mitchell said yesterday,
"and insofar as I know, on the part of
any other person in this matter. I am
certain that the judicial proceedings in
this case will fully vindicate me and
confirm the absence of any
wrongdoing."
Irresponsible
Mitchell, who was questioned about
the Watergate affair by Senate
investigators yesterday afternoon, said
the indictment was "one of the most
irresponsible acts I ever heard of
coming out of the Justice
Department" which he formerly
headed.
Stans, budget director under

President Dwight D. Eisenhower and
before that a deputy postmaster
general, was Nixon's chief fund raiser
in 1968 and 1972.
Stans said, "I am greatly dismayed
by the action of the grand jury. I have
full faith and confidence in God and in
American justice. I expect that when
all the facts are heard, I will be
vindicated."
The grand jury handed up the
indictment to U.S. District Court
Judge Sylvester J. Ryan.
Penalties
The conspiracy and perjury charges
carry maximum penalties of five years
in prison and $10,000 fine each upon
conviction. The obstruction of justice
charges have a maximum penalty of
five years in prison and a $5000 fine.
Mitchell was director of Nixon's
re-election campaign until last July.
The money was returned to Vesco
after it was revealed that Vesco was
34-year-old lawyer had sought access
to White House files.
Watergate
Disclaiming specific knowledge of
what Connally would be asked to do,
Ziegler acknowledged Connally can
and will advise Nixon on matters
relating to Watergate.
On Capitol Hill, Richardson told
the Senate Judiciary Committee that
Nixon told him he doesn't want to be
kept informed about the Watergate
investigations and prosecutions.
"The President has said I am to
have authority over these
investigations and prosecutions, and
that I am to press them to a
conclusion no matter who is hurt,"
Richardson said.

Secretary' Maurice H. Stans and two
corporate officials were indicted
yesterday on charges of conspiring to
arrange a secret .$200,000 contribution
to the Nixon re-election campaign last
year.
The others named as defendants in
the 16-count indictment returned by a
federal grand jury were a New Jersey
Republican leader, Harry L. Sears, and
Robert L. Vesco, 37, former board
chairman of International Controls
Corp. Vesco made the donation, which
was later returned by the Nixon
campaign.
The Nixon committee also returned
to Vesco another $50,000 which he
had contributed openly through the
New Jersey campaign committee,
headed by Sears.
Vesco was under investigation by
the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) at the time of the
contribution.
Obstruction Of Justice
All four were charged with
conspiracy to defraud the federal
government, obstruction of justice,
and obstruction of a criminal
investigation.
In addition, Mitchell and Stans
were each accused of six counts of
perjury.
"There has been no wrongdoing on
my part," Mitchell said yesterday,
"and insofar as I know, on the part of
any other person in this matter. I am
certain that the judicial proceedings in
this case will fully vindicate me and
confirm the absence of any
wrongdoing."
Irresponsible
Mitchell, who was questioned about
the Watergate affair by Senate
investigators yesterday afternoon, said
the indictment was "one of the most
irresponsible acts I ever heard of
coming out of the Justice
Department" which he formerly
headed.
Stans, budget director under

President Dwight D. Eisenhower and
before that a deputy postmaster
general, was Nixon's chief fund raiser
in 1968 and 1972.
Stans said, "I am greatly dismayed
by the action of the grand jury. I have
full faith and confidence in God and in
American justice. I expect that when
all the facts are heard, I will be
vindicated."
The grand jury handed up the
indictment to U.S. District Court
Judge Sylvester J. Ryan.
Penalties
The conspiracy and perjury charges
carry maximum penalties of five years
in prison and $10,000 fine each upon
conviction. The obstruction of justice
charges have a maximum penalty of
five years in prison and a $5000 fine.
Mitchell was director of Nixon's
re-election campaign until last July.
The money was returned to Vesco
after it was revealed that Vesco was
34-year-old lawyer had sought access
to White House files.
Watergate
Disclaiming specific knowledge of
what Connally would be asked to do,
Ziegler acknowledged Connally can
and will advise Nixon on matters
relating to Watergate.
On Capitol Hill, Richardson told
the Senate Judiciary Committee that
Nixon told him he doesn't want to be
kept informed about the Watergate
investigations and prosecutions.
"The President has said I am to
have authority over these
investigations and prosecutions, and
that I am to press them to a
conclusion no matter who is hurt,"
Richardson said.
