# A 						Distortion Of Priorities
## On The Campus Master Plan 
### 
mini Mike Kieschnick

The University has recently
demonstrated its priorities with
regard to student housing,
academic expansion, and road
building. Through a master road
plan and the current $83 million
building expansion, the Stanford
campus will be drastically altered
and enlarged in coming years.
Fifteen years ago, Stanford
planners made basic assumptions
about the fate of numrous houses
on the row and on the academic
side of Campus Drive. They
assumed that all of these would
not exist today, having been torn
down as they aged and their
fraternity occupants moved into
beautiful new $500,000 cluster
houses. Based on these
assumptions, plans were made for
such projects as the rerouting of
Campus Drive and the new law
school now under construction.
Several of the houses that the
planners assumed would be gone
long ago were torn down to make
room for the law school. The
rerouting of Campus Drive creates
a similar situation.
It is obvious that the 15 year
old assumptions are wrong, in that
large numbers of students actually
prefer to live in real houses
instead of dorms. But the
construction plans do not take
account of the fact that the
assumptions are now outdated.
Stillman In Half
The plans have become an end
unto themselves, no longer
reflecting the needs that created
them. This summer the University
will spend about $100,000 to cut
the Stillman half of Grove House
into two parts, load them onto
trailers and move them across
Campus Drive. This is being done

despite the fact that it is the
eventual plan of the University
that there will be no housing on
that side of Campus Drive.
Stillman is being moved to create
a hole in the row houses through
which the University can build a
wider and faster road to connect
with Mayfield. The $10,000
expense of moving the house is
viewed as a right of way cost of
the road.
The University is very proud of
its "diverse" housing system. Even
though many students who desire
to live on campus can't, for lack
of spaces, the University
maintains that there is no money
to buy or build more housing
space. The present housing
shortage would be far greater if a
large number of students were not
living in houses the University
assumed would no longer exist.
It should also be obvious that
the housing system would lose
some of its proclaimed diversity if
these houses did not exist.
The Master Plan
This leads to ask why the
University deems it more
important to build roads instead
of housing. The answer is simple,
"the master plan." When the
master road plan was developed
15 years ago, Stanford students
depended on cars. The fraternity
residents of the row could and did
drive into the middle of campus
for class. To combat this, selected
roads were blocked off as the
beginning stages of the road plan.
The main purpose has been
fulfilled, as most of the campus is
inaccessible by car. The new
outer Campus Drive represents the
culmination of these successful
beginnings. The present road that

is being replaced carries about
10,000 cars a day, yet congestion
is only a problem at rush hours.
The University seeks to divert this
traffic away from the central
campus and through the
residential area of the row. When
the master plan is completed, a
four lane divided road will extend
around campus, cutting through
the row, and through the fields in
the area of the golf course and
stables. This represents the best of
the American road ethic: if a road
is congested, build a bigger one.
The University fails to see the
alternative of reducing traffic,
instead of luring more cars into
the community with bigger and
faster roads. A twice a day traffic
slowdown should not bother
anyone when the cost of building
a road to alleviate it is considered.
It appears that the University,
having decided upon a road 15
years ago, is unable to recognize
that the need no longer exists.
Old Dreams

Stanford's planners seem
hopelessly caught in their
commitment to their dreams of
15 years ago. It is incredible that
the University can find no better
means of spending hundreds of
thousands of dollars than to move
houses and build roads. If there
were no more urgent needs, the
money should not be spent.
It is blatantly clear that the
thoughtless waste of money on
such projects increases costs and
adds nothing to the academic
capability of the school. Those
who wish to see more of thâ‚¬
dreams of Stanford planners
should visit Oscar Nelson,
Stanford Master Planner, in
Encina. Perhaps it is asking too
much of a rich university to
efficiently use existing resources,
and to give priority to the
development of a better
community over the urge to
expand and build ad infinitum.
