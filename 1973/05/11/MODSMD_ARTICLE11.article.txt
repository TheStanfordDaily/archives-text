I have been troubled in the
past few months by
interpretations of my resignation
from the History Department and
its relation to the larger and
historically indisputable sexism of
the History Department. I have
not, for example, "been forced to
walk the plank." Nor did I — as
Helen Chauncey states in the
Daily (May 8) — file "recently for
promotion to assistant
professorship." The fact is that I
resigned in April 1972, to become
effective June of this year. My
resignation as a lecturer opened an
assistant professorship which I
feel should be in Enlightenment
history; however, it is the
Department that makes priority
judgments as to area. I explicitly
stated at that time, to both the
Chairman and the Dean, that I
had no desire to be included as a
candidate in a national search for
assistant professor — should there
be an opening in my field. A
resignation is a resignation.
I testify to the fact that it is
bewildering and very painful to
serve anywhere, anytime, as a
"token woman," especially when
an • otherwise excellent
coeducational background has not
prepared you for it. However,
what has been more difficult for
me is having my scholarship
questioned because I have
neglected to fulfill the publication
requirements of a market society
and because my understanding of
"professional training" differs
from that of some of my
colleagues. When my work
appears, I hope it will speak for
itself; in the meantime, I have
been unable to meet the standards
for regular faculty status, male or
female, here at Stanford. Among
my more intellectual friends,
usually with strong
interdisciplinary concerns, are as
many men as women who have
faced similar difficulties. I am not
alone. The burden of proof always
falls upon those who reject the
conventional categories, roles, or
understandings of the relationship
between theory and praxis. In
company with others, I accept
that burden.
