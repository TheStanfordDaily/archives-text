Campus Construction
Stanford is beginning an
important $83 million
construction program that will
house all departments as well as
radically alter the physical
complexion of the campus. Master
planners, biochemists, and
dermatologists for the University
predict that a "Dynamic Steady
State" will be reached by the late
19905.
At such time, the University
will have a pH of 7.0, a of
1.01x10" % and will be
approaching entropic doom.
Other experts claim that the
surface makeup of the campus
will approximate a condition of
acne vulgaris.
No date has been set for
groundbreaking, and in the words
of one Stanford official, "We're
still waiting for the money to be
raised."
New Theme Houses
The latest additions to the
1984-5 housing draw will be two
independent theme houses,
occupying the former dwelling
places of the last two fraternities
on campus. Slated to open in the
fall are Martin Bormann House
and Elliot Richardson House.
The all-male Bormann House
plans to hide its members all over
campus, and then focus media
coverage on trying to uncover
their whereabouts. Requirements
for signing the waiting list
include: expertise in disguise,
quick movement, and PTR
forgery.
Richardson House, named after
the mastermind of the Watergate
scandal that rocked the nation
over a decade ago, demands of its
prospective members
unimpeachable integrity and an
adaptability to handle several
distinct jobs with no additional
background.
A proposal by former Daily
columnist Jerry Coleman to set up
a Zucchini House was turned
down by the Committee-in-
Charge.
New Campus Program
Secretary of Defense David
Packard, a Palo Alto industrialist
and former Stanford Trustee,
announced in Washington today a
new academic program offering
for Stanford students working

toward a double degree in
Electrical Engineering and
Political Science.
Students in this program,
called "Diodes for Defense," will
spend two quarters off campus in
"enriched learning environments,"
and a third quarter back on the
farm writing a thesis on their
experience.
The first three month period
will take place in a laboratory
cubicle buried somewhere within
the offices of the Hewlett-Packard
Company, while the second
quarter's time will be spent with
the Defense Secretary in his
Washington office.
"Diodes for Defense" is being
funded by a $1.5 billion initial
grant from the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI).
Overseas Campus News
Stanford-in-Germany has once
again lightened its entrance
requirements »in the face of
steadily-dropping enrollment.
Now applicants no longer need
any English-speaking ability: if
they can walk onto the airplane,
they are eligible.
The latest campus addition to
the Stanford family,
Stanford-in-Oakland, is doing
quite well, according to director
Bobby Seale. The campus football
team, dubbed "The Cardinal
Panthers" by its fans, has even
managed to capture the Selmer H.
Berg Athletic Trophy from former
holder Skyline High School.
Officials promise a speedy
return of the trophy, and
attribute the theft to "simple
collegiate prankery."
Anthropology Professors
George and Louise Spindler are
embarking on an ethnographic
study of the American folk hero,

Paul • Bunyan, at the
Stanford-in-Bemidji (Minnesota)
campus.
Editorial Statement
As our newspaper nears its goal
of independence, I would like to
ask your help in supporting, this
last time, our request for student
funding. We cannot remain a
quality paper without YOUR
help, nor maintain our tradition as
the only daily metropolitan
morning newspaper north of Los
Gatos. And let me stress that this
will be the "absolutely last" Daily
fee-assessment. Thank you.
—Glenn Garvin, Editor-in-Chief
Plant Services Bulletin
Director of Plant Services
Norman Robinson announced
today the filling of the last
campus pothole. "I promised you
a full generation of smooth
riding," Robinson said this
morning at the roadside
ceremony, "and at last we have
reached our goal of transportation
with honor."
During the last five years,
Robinson had repeatedly warned
the existing road potholes that
they would no longer be
tolerated. But it was only after
last Winter, when the potholes
spread all over campus drive,
disrupting traffic and wreaking
havoc, that Robinson decided to
take decisive action. "I got bored
with foot dragging," the director
said.
That's all for the 1984 news.
