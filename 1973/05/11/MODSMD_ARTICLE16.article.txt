How can you determine your 1.Q.? D.T.
There is an organization called "Mensa" made up of people whose
I.Q.s are in the top 2 percent in the nation. They will send out I.Q.
tests (and presumably, the results) to prospective members. You could
write to the group's headquarters for more information. The address is
Mensa, 50 East 42nd St., New York, N.Y. 10017.
Julia Ferris, Chief Psychometrist for Student Counseling and
Psychological Services, cautioned that test scores themselves have no
meaning — they must be interpreted carefully and compared with a
realistic norm group. Therefore, you might take I.Q. test results with a
grain of salt unless they are carefully explained and interpreted.

What are the closest camping sites to Stanford? What do they
charge? How do you get to them? C.G.
The three closest are all state parks — Big Basin Redwoods, Butano,
and Portola.
Each park has a camping fee of $3 per night. You will need
reservations, which can be made at the Ticketron office in Tresidder
for a fee of $1.50.
To get to Big Basin: Take Page Mill Road west from Stanford. It
will go under Highway 280, past Foothill park, and wind around in
the hills. Eventually it will dead-end in Highway 35, Skyline
Boulevard. Turn south onto Skyline and travel until you reach
Highway 9. Turn west onto 9, which will turn into Highway 236, and
just keep going until you reach Big Basin.
To get to Butano: Turn north on Highway 35 and travel to Alpine
Road: Travel along Alpine until you get to Pescadero Road. Get on
Pescadero and drive until you reach the intersection of Pescadero and
Cloverdale. Turn south onto Cloverdale and travel about one mile past
Canyon Road and you will reach the entrace to the park.
To get to Portola: Take High way 35 north to Alpine Road. Turn
west onto Alpine and travel until you see the turn-off, to the left, for
Portola State Park.
There are other ways of getting to these parks. Some of them may
be faster. Check maps and talk to friends for possible alternate routes
to thy parks.

Address questions to Bug Me, the Stanford Daily, Storke
Publications Building, Stanford, California 94305. Bring them by the
Daily offices at the corner of Panama and Lomita streets, or call
extension 4632 and ask for Bug. Only initials will be used.

There is an organization called "Mensa" made up of people whose
I.Q.s are in the top 2 percent in the nation. They will send out I.Q.
tests (and presumably, the results) to prospective members. You could
write to the group's headquarters for more information. The address is
Mensa, 50 East 42nd St., New York, N.Y. 10017.
Julia Ferris, Chief Psychometrist for Student Counseling and
Psychological Services, cautioned that test scores themselves have no
meaning — they must be interpreted carefully and compared with a
realistic norm group. Therefore, you might take I.Q. test results with a
grain of salt unless they are carefully explained and interpreted.

What are the closest camping sites to Stanford? What do they
charge? How do you get to them? C.G.
The three closest are all state parks — Big Basin Redwoods, Butano,
and Portola.
Each park has a camping fee of $3 per night. You will need
reservations, which can be made at the Ticketron office in Tresidder
for a fee of $1.50.
To get to Big Basin: Take Page Mill Road west from Stanford. It
will go under Highway 280, past Foothill park, and wind around in
the hills. Eventually it will dead-end in Highway 35, Skyline
Boulevard. Turn south onto Skyline and travel until you reach
Highway 9. Turn west onto 9, which will turn into Highway 236, and
just keep going until you reach Big Basin.
To get to Butano: Turn north on Highway 35 and travel to Alpine
Road: Travel along Alpine until you get to Pescadero Road. Get on
Pescadero and drive until you reach the intersection of Pescadero and
Cloverdale. Turn south onto Cloverdale and travel about one mile past
Canyon Road and you will reach the entrace to the park.
To get to Portola: Take High way 35 north to Alpine Road. Turn
west onto Alpine and travel until you see the turn-off, to the left, for
Portola State Park.
There are other ways of getting to these parks. Some of them may
be faster. Check maps and talk to friends for possible alternate routes
to thy parks.
