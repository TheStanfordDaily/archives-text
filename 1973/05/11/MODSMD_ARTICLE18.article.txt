# Perceptive Perspective
## 'Architect & Emperor' Explores Evil 
### JEFF GREENWALD 
"The Architect and the
Emperor of Assyria" is an
engulfing drama about the
ugliness of man's hatred of
himself, his surroundings, and his
own institutions. What Salvador
Dali gave to painting through
Surrealism, Arrabal has given to
modern theatre.
After a thirty minute delay on
account of a broken part of the
soundtrack which had to be
repaired, a problem which was
never resolved, the play opened to
the panic of an uncivilized man
living on an imaginary island with
the Emperor of Assyria, who
represents civilization and all that
man has created.
The uncivilized architect has
not undergone the social changes
that institutions such as the
Catholic Church have forced upon
their followers. The power
struggle of the Architect and the
Emperor becomes the basis for
which interaction between the
characters played by Michael
Goldstein and John Caldwell, is
developed.
The symbolism and
representation of moral judgments
are similar to that of Greek
tragedies, as the characters are
all-encompassing. One feels glued
to his chair, unable to fathom the

ugliness portrayed of man's
insatiable hatred for himself and
all that is wicked in his world.
Short Fantasies
The first act comprises short
fantasies of intense role playing.
The harshly perverse dramas of
abnormal behavior in such scenes
as the Emperor's chaining himself
in meditation to a cross where he
later plans to die for man's
redemption, are portrayed with
almost professional direction,
making this play a most intriguing
experience.
The chain scene is symbolic of
the Greek myth in which
Prometheus is chained to a rock
where birds can come and peck at
his face. The perversity of man's
lust for power is shown in a scene
where the Emperor plays a pinball
game (against God) with Heaven
and Hell at stake.
The humor is often
uncomfortable to bear, as a
mockery is made of all
identification that man has made
with God, himself, and his
relationships with people. Man
must beat himself to obtain
punishment that he deserves for
being born unpure. Arrabal
struggles with the inner conflicts
man endures trying to determine
his own identity.
The second act depicts the

Emperor's trial for his incestuous
relations with his brother and
mother, as well as for his mother's
murder. When he confesses to the
murder of his mother which he
committed by hammering her to
death in her sleep, he is sentenced
to death.
His last wish is that he be eaten
by his executioner, the Architect.
The gory details of drinking the
Emperor's nucleic acid from his
brain and the bloody parts of his
body are fully drawn out and even
enhanced by the realistic lighting
and props.
Cannibalism, incest, murder,
homosexuality, the Oedipal
complex, wickedness, and a
propensity towards hatred are
explicit details of life that the
audience must face in order to
fully understand the characters.
The acting was superb, and the
constant movement of the actors
was physically tiring not only for
the players, but also for the
audience. The subplots foretell
man's condemnation by showing
the true sadism, masochism, and
hatred, of human nature.
Background
Arrabal is a Spanish playright.
However he lives in France and his
works were first translated into
French. The metamorphosis of
males and females is in Jean

Genet's fiction, and is prevalent
throughout "The Architect and
the Emperor." Written nearly
twenty years ago, this powerful
play is a look at man's inner
cravings and his animalistic lust
that is at times shocking, and
never dull. This play is a keen
portrayal of humanity's ugliness.
"The Architect and the
Emperor" is being played in the

Nitery in the Old Union May 8-12
and 15-19 with Midnight
performances on May 10-12, and
17-19. The play starts at 8 p.m

death in her sleep, he is sentenced
to death.
His last wish is that he be eaten
by his executioner, the Architect.
The gory details of drinking the
Emperor's nucleic acid from his
brain and the bloody parts of his
body are fully drawn out and even
enhanced by the realistic lighting
and props.
Cannibalism, incest, murder,
homosexuality, the Oedipal
complex, wickedness, and a
propensity towards hatred are
explicit details of life that the
audience must face in order to
fully understand the characters.

constant movement of the actors

man's condemnation by showing
the true sadism, masochism, and

Background
Arrabal is a Spanish playright.
However he lives in France and his
works were first translated into
French. The metamorphosis of
males and females is in Jean

Genet's fiction, and is prevalent
throughout "The Architect and
the Emperor." Written nearly
twenty years ago, this powerful
play is a look at man's inner
cravings and his animalistic lust
that is at times shocking, and
never dull. This play is a keen
portrayal of humanity's ugliness.
"The Architect and the
Emperor" is being played in the

Nitery in the Old Union May 8-12
and 15-19 with Midnight
performances on May 10-12, and
17-19. The play starts at 8 p.m
For an in depth look at people
and their inner conflicts with life,
however perverse and abnormal
they are, as well as exposure to
Stanford's Drama Department at
its best, see "The Architect and
the Emperor of Assyria."
"The Architect and the
Emperor of Assyria" is an
engulfing drama about the
ugliness of man's hatred of
himself, his surroundings, and his
own institutions. What Salvador
Dali gave to painting through
Surrealism, Arrabal has given to
modern theatre.
After a thirty minute delay on
account of a broken part of the
soundtrack which had to be
repaired, a problem which was
never resolved, the play opened to
the panic of an uncivilized man
living on an imaginary island with
the Emperor of Assyria, who
represents civilization and all that
man has created.
The uncivilized architect has
not undergone the social changes
that institutions such as the
Catholic Church have forced upon
their followers. The power
struggle of the Architect and the
Emperor becomes the basis for
which interaction between the
characters played by Michael
Goldstein and John Caldwell, is
developed.
The symbolism and
representation of moral judgments
are similar to that of Greek
tragedies, as the characters are
all-encompassing. One feels glued
to his chair, unable to fathom the

ugliness portrayed of man's
insatiable hatred for himself and
all that is wicked in his world.
Short Fantasies
The first act comprises short
fantasies of intense role playing.
The harshly perverse dramas of
abnormal behavior in such scenes
as the Emperor's chaining himself
in meditation to a cross where he
later plans to die for man's
redemption, are portrayed with
almost professional direction,
making this play a most intriguing
experience.
The chain scene is symbolic of
the Greek myth in which
Prometheus is chained to a rock
where birds can come and peck at
his face. The perversity of man's
lust for power is shown in a scene
where the Emperor plays a pinball
game (against God) with Heaven
and Hell at stake.
The humor is often
uncomfortable to bear, as a
mockery is made of all
identification that man has made
with God, himself, and his
relationships with people. Man
must beat himself to obtain
punishment that he deserves for
being born unpure. Arrabal
struggles with the inner conflicts
man endures trying to determine
his own identity.
The second act depicts the

Emperor's trial for his incestuous
relations with his brother and
mother, as well as for his mother's
murder. When he confesses to the
murder of his mother which he
committed by hammering her to
death in her sleep, he is sentenced
to death.
His last wish is that he be eaten
by his executioner, the Architect.
