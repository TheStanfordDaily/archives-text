# ‘Stop The World' Starts At Toyon Hall
## 
### JON R. KENNEDY 
"Stop the World I Want to Get
Off" opened at Toyon Hall lounge
last night and will run through
Sunday with Jim Hannon in the
leading role of "Littlechap" made
famous by Anthony Newly,
00-author with Leslie Brieusse of
the London and Broadway hit
musical. Cici Blackburn co-stars as
Evie, Anya, Ilse, and Ginnie,
Littlechap's wife and respective
mistresses.
Littlechap, appearing in mime

face and trousers, represents the
Everyman of this not-very-heavy
comic drama and a playground set
represents the world. Every time
things get beyond Littlechap's
control he says "stop the world!"
He gets off, reflects a few
moments not unlike Tevya in
"Fiddler on the Roof," then gets
back on.
Littlechap went to church once
when he was eight weeks old. And
that time they put his head under
water (he must have been Eastern

Orthodox), so he never returned.
He mentions this to let us know
the world and life view — or lack
of one — which he develops in the
play is, so far as he knows, strictly
his own.
Like a broad cross-section of
his peers, Littlechap confuses
human fulfillment with sexual
fulfillment. We see him in each of
the ages of man: childhood,
youth, maturity, middle age, and
old age. He marries Evie because
she is pregnant, he is to blame,
and the boss is her father. It is a
good marriage in the sense that it
is a stepping stone to the material
success so important to Littlechap
in his mature and middle years,
but otherwise, he thinks, a failure.
The play is famous for
producing "What Kind of Fool
Am I?" but the number is not at
all what those familiar with the
Robert Goulet rendition might
expect. Instead it comes as
something of a surprise ending,
which I won't spoil by developing
further.
Jim Hannon is solid in the
leading role, though the British
accent affected for thy part
sometimes gets the better of his
diction. Cici Blackburn is

tremendous in her four parts, each
with a differnt accent and an only
slightly different costume, but a
personality so well characterized
that you have to look hard to be
sure she's the same actress.
Alice Clark and Pam
Frischkorn are the Littlechap
daughters, and their best scene is a
musical seesaw number. Jeff
Myers, as the son who didn't
survive and the grandson who
does, has the role of Littlechap's
Second Chance. "It makes you
think," the old grandfather muses
as the lights dim; but it's not
much hope when you do think.

The chorus does an excellent
job as a bus, various factory and
office machines, and cast "extras"
where needed. They are: Lynn
Barre, Phil Bartsch, Dennis Berry,
Sandy Genis, Jeff Jenest, Joy
Kelley, Phil Kurzner and Marlene
Veach.
Fritz Schwenk directs the show
with Mary Lawrence as assistant
and Tom Hatfield as musical
director.
The comedy is light and the set
and lighting are very effective. In
all, you'd have a hard time getting
so much elsewhere for 50 cents: a
fun time is guaranteed.
