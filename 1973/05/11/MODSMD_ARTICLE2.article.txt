# Beaty Admits Lying About Smuggling Of Escape Plan
## 
### 
Ronald Wayne Beaty, a convict
who testified earlier that he lied to a
grand jury, said in court
yesterday that he also had lied to
investigating officers about the way his
escape plan was smuggled out of
prison.
Beaty had told investigators
previously that a friend of Joe Morgan,
who he said was the leader of the
so-called "Mexican Mafia"
underground prison organization,
smuggled his escape plan from the
Chino Institution for Men.
Beaty, the prosecution's star
witness in the trial of Benton Douglas
Burt, 30, and his wife Andrea Holman
Burt, 18, admitted under defense

cross-examination that his original
story was false.
Burt and his wife, the daughter of
Medicine Prof. Halsted Holman, are
charged with murder, assault and
freeing a prisoner in the escape of
Beaty last Oct. 6. One prison guard
was killed and another was wounded
when Beaty was freed while being
escorted in an auto to a courtroom
here.
Smuggling
Beaty has testified that a San Diego
attorney, Alex Landon, smuggled his
escape plan from prison. Landon, who
once represented Beaty, has denied
that he smuggled anything for Beaty.
In earlier cross-examination, Beaty
had conceded that he had lied when he
told a grand jury that fired English
Prof. H. Bruce Franklin gave
instructions that Beaty be blindfolded
en route to a cabin hideaway.
He also said he omitted some minor
facts about what happened between
his escape and recapture in the Bay
Area.
Beaty turned state's evidence after
being recaptured.
Garry Speaks
Last night in a speech addressed to
a small audience in Bishop
Auditorium, defense attorney Charles
Garry discussed certain aspects of the
current murder trial.
Garry, who presented a pessimistic
view on the judiciary practices of this
country, despondently discussed the
state's star witness, Ronald Beaty.
Garry referred to Beaty as, "A person
completely false, a born loser."
Garry asserted that, "the state is
using him in such a way as to destroy
the one little chance of men and
women in prisons of our country."
Garry, presently attempting to
prove Beaty unworthy as a witness,
said that, "it is almost sickening to see
him sitting on that witness stand and

destroying what little he had left of his
human dignity."
'Stepping-Stone'
In expanding this image of Beaty,
Garry stated that Beaty's work in
Venceremos and other such
organizations was "just a
stepping-stone so he could get his
escape ...
Garry raised accusations Beaty had
made linking the prison lawyer, Alex
Landon, as an aid to the removal of
escape plans from the prison and the
importation of 24 hacksaw blades into
the prison. Garry called the story
"obviously ridiculous" and "sublime."

Prof. H. Bruce Franklin gave
instructions that Beaty be blindfolded
en route to a cabin hideaway.
He also said he omitted some minor
facts about what happened between
his escape and recapture in the Bay
Area.
Beaty turned state's evidence after
being recaptured.
Garry Speaks
Last night in a speech addressed to
a small audience in Bishop
Auditorium, defense attorney Charles
Garry discussed certain aspects of the
current murder trial.
Garry, who presented a pessimistic
view on the judiciary practices of this
country, despondently discussed the
state's star witness, Ronald Beaty.
Garry referred to Beaty as, "A person
completely false, a born loser."
Garry asserted that, "the state is
using him in such a way as to destroy
the one little chance of men and
women in prisons of our country."
Garry, presently attempting to
prove Beaty unworthy as a witness,
said that, "it is almost sickening to see
him sitting on that witness stand and

destroying what little he had left of his
human dignity."
'Stepping-Stone'
In expanding this image of Beaty,
Garry stated that Beaty's work in
Venceremos and other such
organizations was "just a
stepping-stone so he could get his
escape ...
Garry raised accusations Beaty had
made linking the prison lawyer, Alex
Landon, as an aid to the removal of
escape plans from the prison and the
importation of 24 hacksaw blades into
the prison. Garry called the story
"obviously ridiculous" and "sublime."

CHINO DEFENSE DESPONDENT — Last night Charles Garry spoke in a
conference concerning Political Prisoners, headed by Venceremos member Geri
Foote (background). Garry discussed the American judiciary system and
expressed pessimism toward recent practices.
Ronald Wayne Beaty, a convict
who testified earlier that he lied to a
grand jury, said in court
yesterday that he also had lied to
investigating officers about the way his
escape plan was smuggled out of
prison.
Beaty had told investigators
previously that a friend of Joe Morgan,
who he said was the leader of the
so-called "Mexican Mafia"
underground prison organization,
smuggled his escape plan from the
Chino Institution for Men.
Beaty, the prosecution's star
witness in the trial of Benton Douglas
Burt, 30, and his wife Andrea Holman
Burt, 18, admitted under defense

cross-examination that his original
story was false.
Burt and his wife, the daughter of
Medicine Prof. Halsted Holman, are
charged with murder, assault and
freeing a prisoner in the escape of
Beaty last Oct. 6. One prison guard
was killed and another was wounded
when Beaty was freed while being
escorted in an auto to a courtroom
here.
Smuggling
Beaty has testified that a San Diego
attorney, Alex Landon, smuggled his
escape plan from prison. Landon, who
once represented Beaty, has denied
that he smuggled anything for Beaty.
In earlier cross-examination, Beaty
had conceded that he had lied when he
told a grand jury that fired English
Prof. H. Bruce Franklin gave
instructions that Beaty be blindfolded
en route to a cabin hideaway.
He also said he omitted some minor
facts about what happened between
his escape and recapture in the Bay
Area.
Beaty turned state's evidence after
