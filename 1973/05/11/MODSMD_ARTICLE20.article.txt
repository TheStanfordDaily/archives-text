# Piano Concert
## Naftalin Returns 
### JAY HARLOW 
Monday night, May 14, pianist Mark Naftalin will return to campus
with an 8 p.m. concert in the Tresidder Large Lounge.
Naftalin is a blues and rock musician who has appeared and
recorded with a wide variety of artists. He grew up in Minneapolis,
and was first influenced by such blues and rhythm and blues pianists
as Ray Charles, Otis Spann, and Jerry Lee Lewis.
His first major break came in 1965 when he joined the Paul
Butterfield Blues Band. He stayed with the band until 1968, playing
piano, electric piano, and organ. He spent the next two years outside
the country concentrating on piano, which is his main instrument.
Since leaving the Butterfield band, Naftalin has played and
recorded with black and white blues musicians as well as rock, gospel,
and country artists. His record credits include albums by John Lee
Hooker, James Cotton, Otis Rush, Howlin' Wolf, Michael Bloomfield,
Nick Gravenites, Canned Heat, Quicksilver, and the New Riders of the
Purple Sage. In addition, he co-produced a rock album, Mother Earth,
and says he might do some more producing. However, his main
emphasis is as a performer.
Currently, Naftalin has been playing concerts with Bloomfield,
including a recent gig at Winterland which also featured the Elvin
Bishop band and Butterfield's new band, thus re-uniting the original
Butterfield band. In addition, he has begun playing solo concerts, two
at home in Minneapolis, and one here at Stanford in February.
Naftalin said that he enjoyed the February concert, noting that the
audience, although small, was very receptive and responsive. Another
major reason for his return is Tresidder's excellent piano, a nine-foot
Steinway. Any musician will confirm that a superior instrument
makes for a performance which is more satisfying both to the artist
and to the audience.
Comparing solo to ensemble playing, Naftalin says that the type of
music is essentially the same, a mixture of blues, rock, gospel, country,
and boogie woogie, but the performance will be more open-ended.
"The major difference is that I'll be stretching out into some other
moods, with a little more contemplation and introspection involved."
In addition to those instrumental styles, he will be singing some of his
own songs.
Through concerts like this, Naftalin is trying to expand his musical
career into a new area. He is already an established and respected
free-lance artist in an ensemble situation. While he intends to continue
playing in groups, he hopes to establish himself as a soloist as well.

His first major break came in 1965 when he joined the Paul
Butterfield Blues Band. He stayed with the band until 1968, playing
piano, electric piano, and organ. He spent the next two years outside
the country concentrating on piano, which is his main instrument.
Since leaving the Butterfield band, Naftalin has played and
recorded with black and white blues musicians as well as rock, gospel,
and country artists. His record credits include albums by John Lee
Hooker, James Cotton, Otis Rush, Howlin' Wolf, Michael Bloomfield,
Nick Gravenites, Canned Heat, Quicksilver, and the New Riders of the
Purple Sage. In addition, he co-produced a rock album, Mother Earth,
and says he might do some more producing. However, his main
emphasis is as a performer.
Currently, Naftalin has been playing concerts with Bloomfield,
including a recent gig at Winterland which also featured the Elvin
Bishop band and Butterfield's new band, thus re-uniting the original
Butterfield band. In addition, he has begun playing solo concerts, two
at home in Minneapolis, and one here at Stanford in February.
Naftalin said that he enjoyed the February concert, noting that the
audience, although small, was very receptive and responsive. Another
major reason for his return is Tresidder's excellent piano, a nine-foot
Steinway. Any musician will confirm that a superior instrument
makes for a performance which is more satisfying both to the artist
and to the audience.
Comparing solo to ensemble playing, Naftalin says that the type of
music is essentially the same, a mixture of blues, rock, gospel, country,
and boogie woogie, but the performance will be more open-ended.
"The major difference is that I'll be stretching out into some other
moods, with a little more contemplation and introspection involved."
In addition to those instrumental styles, he will be singing some of his
own songs.
Through concerts like this, Naftalin is trying to expand his musical
career into a new area. He is already an established and respected
free-lance artist in an ensemble situation. While he intends to continue
playing in groups, he hopes to establish himself as a soloist as well.
