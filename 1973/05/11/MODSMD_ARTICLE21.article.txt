# Golfers Host First Southern Tourney
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Stanford's golf team will be
seeing a lot of the USC Trojans
the next five days.
USC will be favored in the
Pacific Eight Southern Division
Championships beginning today
on the Stanford course, but the
Cards hope to reverse the roles by
Monday, when the two teams tec
it up again in the Pac-8
tournament at Spokane, Wash.
This weekend's tourney is the
first annual Southern Division
event. Stanford, USC, UCLA, and
California previously decided the
Southern Division title on the
basis of a round-robin dual match
series between the four schools,
but this year the coaches decided
to follow college golf's recent
trend toward medal play
tournaments.
The four Northern Division
schools (Washington, Washington
State, Oregon, and Oregon State)
will be playing in a similar event
this weekend in Clarkston, Wash.
"You have to think medal play
now," said Stanford coach Bud
Finger. "A person who just knows
how to play match play might as
well forget it in college golf."
54 Hole Event
The medal play format which
will be used this weekend is
simple. Six players from each of
the four schools will play 54
holes, 36 today and 18 tomorrow.
The best four scores from each
team are added up to determine
the team total.
The 54 holes scheduled for this
weekend represent the start of a
grueling 126 holes of competitive
golf for the Pac-8 teams in a
period of five days. After today's
36 holes and tomorrow's 18, all
four Southern Division teams will
fly to Spokane for the Pac-8
toumey, an event which features
72 holes of competition in two
days.
USC, ranked sixth nationally in
the latest Golf World coaches'
poll, is the clear-cut favorite to
survive the 126 ordeal and

become Southern Division and
Pac-8 champions, but Stanford
certainly has the ability to upset
the Trojans, especially this
weekend on the Stanford course.
The Cards defeated USC by
three shots in winning the Pacific
Coast Invitational at Santa
Barbara in March. Since then the
teams have met twice, USC
scoring 1359 to Stanford's 1370
at the Fresno State Classic and the
Cards finishing with 922 at the
Western Intercollegiates compared
to the Trojans' winning 897 total.
USC's victory in the Western
Intercollegiates was one of five
major tournament victories the
Trojans have recorded in 1973.
One of the main reasons for their
success is sophomore Craig Stadler,
easily the West Coast's leading
candidate for AU-American
honors.
Long Hitter
Stadler already has three
individual tournament victories to
his credit this year, and is the
"longest hitter I've ever had at
USC," according to his coach Stan
Wood.
Finger will counter with a
lineup which also includes four
leading candidates for individual
honors. Conrad Nilmeier (1973
U.S. Collegiate Invitational
champion). Denny Colvin, Dave
Baskins, and Aly Trompas would
have to be considered among the
favorites in this weekend's
individual competition and
George Pettinger and John Beers
may have outside shots at the
title.
UCLA and Cal are expected to
battle it out for third and fourth
in the team competition, but
UCLA's Warren MacGregor and
Cal's Dave Brown may challenge
the Cardinal and Trojan individual
contingents.
First round play begins today
at 8 a.m. with the second round
schedueld for 1 p.m. this
afternoon. Tee-off times for
tomorrow's final round begin at 9
a.m.

The Cards defeated USC by
three shots in winning the Pacific
Coast Invitational at Santa
Barbara in March. Since then the
teams have met twice, USC
scoring 1359 to Stanford's 1370
at the Fresno State Classic and the
Cards finishing with 922 at the
Western Intercollegiates compared
to the Trojans' winning 897 total.
USC's victory in the Western
Intercollegiates was one of five
major tournament victories the
Trojans have recorded in 1973.
One of the main reasons for their
success is sophomore Craig Stadler,
easily the West Coast's leading
candidate for AU-American
honors.
Long Hitter
Stadler already has three
individual tournament victories to
his credit this year, and is the
"longest hitter I've ever had at
USC," according to his coach Stan
Wood.
Finger will counter with a
lineup which also includes four
leading candidates for individual
honors. Conrad Nilmeier (1973
U.S. Collegiate Invitational
champion). Denny Colvin, Dave
Baskins, and Aly Trompas would
have to be considered among the
favorites in this weekend's
individual competition and
George Pettinger and John Beers
may have outside shots at the
title.
UCLA and Cal are expected to
battle it out for third and fourth
in the team competition, but
UCLA's Warren MacGregor and
Cal's Dave Brown may challenge
the Cardinal and Trojan individual
contingents.
First round play begins today
at 8 a.m. with the second round
schedueld for 1 p.m. this
afternoon. Tee-off times for
tomorrow's final round begin at 9
a.m.
Stanford's golf team will be
seeing a lot of the USC Trojans
the next five days.
USC will be favored in the
Pacific Eight Southern Division
Championships beginning today
on the Stanford course, but the
Cards hope to reverse the roles by
Monday, when the two teams tec
it up again in the Pac-8
tournament at Spokane, Wash.
This weekend's tourney is the
first annual Southern Division
event. Stanford, USC, UCLA, and
California previously decided the
Southern Division title on the
basis of a round-robin dual match
series between the four schools,
but this year the coaches decided
to follow college golf's recent
trend toward medal play
tournaments.
The four Northern Division
schools (Washington, Washington
State, Oregon, and Oregon State)
will be playing in a similar event
this weekend in Clarkston, Wash.
"You have to think medal play
now," said Stanford coach Bud
Finger. "A person who just knows
how to play match play might as
well forget it in college golf."
54 Hole Event
The medal play format which
will be used this weekend is
simple. Six players from each of
the four schools will play 54
holes, 36 today and 18 tomorrow.
The best four scores from each
team are added up to determine
the team total.
The 54 holes scheduled for this
weekend represent the start of a
grueling 126 holes of competitive
golf for the Pac-8 teams in a
period of five days. After today's
36 holes and tomorrow's 18, all
four Southern Division teams will
fly to Spokane for the Pac-8
toumey, an event which features
72 holes of competition in two
days.
USC, ranked sixth nationally in
the latest Golf World coaches'
poll, is the clear-cut favorite to
survive the 126 ordeal and

become Southern Division and
Pac-8 champions, but Stanford
certainly has the ability to upset
the Trojans, especially this
weekend on the Stanford course.
