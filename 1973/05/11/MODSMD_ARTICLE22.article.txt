# Mayer Cards’ Sole Cal State Survivor
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Sandy Mayer is Stanford's only
remaining hope for a singles
trophy after two rounds at the
California State Tennis
Championships.
The junior is defending
champion in the event, held at the
Alpine Hills Tennis Club in
Portola Valley.
The Cardinals' five other
entrants in the 32-player event
have all been eliminated from the
competition. Rick Fisher, Pat
DuPre, Chip Fisher, and John
Whitlinger, all lost in Wednesday's

first round while Jim Delaney lost
yesterday.
Mayer, the tourney's sixth
seed, whitewashed Greg Shephard
of San Bruno 6-0, 6-0 Wednesday
and came back yesterday with a
7-5, 7-5 decision over Barry
McKay of Ross.
Today, Mayer faces Dick
Bohrinstedt of Redlands in a
quarterfinal.
Delaney, who topped Larry
Huebner, of Fresno 6-4, 7-5
Wednesday, bowed to third seed
Tom Leonard of Chicago 7-6, 3-6,
6-4 yesterday.

The score of Delaney's loss was
exactly the same score as that of
Rick Fisher in bowing to
top-seeded Dick Crealy
Wednesday. The Australian pro
came off the court with nothing
but compliments for the play of
Fisher.
Like Fisher, Pat DuPre simply
got unlucky in the draw. DuPre's
first-round foe was none other
than South African pro Ray
Moore, the second seed. Moore
beat DuPre 6-1, 7-5.
The two Cardinal players who
had to qualify to get into the

tourney also bowed in the first
round. Chip Fisher lost to Alex
Olmedo of Los Angeles (seeded
fifth) 7-6, 6-0, while John

dual match season, it holds its
position as top team in the
country, according to the Atlanta
Journal's National Collegiate
Tennis Poll.

entrants in the 32-player event
have all been eliminated from the
competition. Rick Fisher, Pat
DuPre, Chip Fisher, and John
Whitlinger, all lost in Wednesday's

first round while Jim Delaney lost
yesterday.
Mayer, the tourney's sixth
seed, whitewashed Greg Shephard
of San Bruno 6-0, 6-0 Wednesday
and came back yesterday with a
7-5, 7-5 decision over Barry
McKay of Ross.
Today, Mayer faces Dick
Bohrinstedt of Redlands in a
quarterfinal.
Delaney, who topped Larry
Huebner, of Fresno 6-4, 7-5
Wednesday, bowed to third seed
Tom Leonard of Chicago 7-6, 3-6,
6-4 yesterday.

The score of Delaney's loss was
exactly the same score as that of
Rick Fisher in bowing to
top-seeded Dick Crealy
Wednesday. The Australian pro
came off the court with nothing
but compliments for the play of
Fisher.
Like Fisher, Pat DuPre simply
got unlucky in the draw. DuPre's
first-round foe was none other
than South African pro Ray
Moore, the second seed. Moore
beat DuPre 6-1, 7-5.
The two Cardinal players who
had to qualify to get into the

tourney also bowed in the first
round. Chip Fisher lost to Alex
Olmedo of Los Angeles (seeded
fifth) 7-6, 6-0, while John
Whitlinger fell to Sherwood
Stewart of Bay City, Texas, 2-6,
7-5, 6-4.
In doubles, Mayer and Delaney
are the only Stanford team to
remain in contention.
Mayer-Delaney beat
Cornell-McMillan 6-0, 7-6
yesterday.
The other three doubles teams,
Fisher-Gery Groslimond, Mark
Mitchell-Paul Sidone, and
DuPre-Whitlinger, all lost
yesterday after winning their
matches on Wednesday.
While the Stanford team takes
a week's breather following the
dual match season, it holds its
position as top team in the
country, according to the Atlanta
Journal's National Collegiate
Tennis Poll.
Stanford is first with 88 points,
♦followed by USC (84), Southern
Methodist (77), UCLA (71), and
Miami (62).
