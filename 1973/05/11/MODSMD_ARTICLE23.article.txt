# Annual Red-White Game Concludes Spring Drills
## 
### 
Quarterback Mike Boryla may
be throwing against the toughest
secondary hell face in 1973 when
Stanford concludes its spring
football drills tomorrow morning
with the annual Red-White game
at Stanford Stadium. Kickoff time
is 9:30 a.m.
Boryla will quarterback the
Red squad in the game-type
scrimmage which matches a pair
of teams that should play
contrasting styles of football. The
defending champion Red team
will most likely keep the ball«
airborne, while the underdog
White squad hopes to control the
tempo of the game with a strong
ground attack.
"We feel we've got a good,
solid team," said Pete Kettela, one
of the coaches of the White squad.
"They've got the quarterback, but
we counteracted that with the top
receivers and secondary."
Defensive halfback James
Ferguson and strong safety Randy
Poltl will anchor an outstanding
White secondary which also
includes Craig Zaltoski, Roland
Young, and Gerald Wilson.
Strong Running
Kettela thinks the White squad
will also feature a strong running
attack. "We feel like Doug Jena

and David Tenn have had as good
a spring as anybody," Kettela
said, "and with two of the
probable starting offensive tackles
(Keith Rowen and Todd
Anderson), we should be able to
control the ball on the ground."

Defensive co-ordinator Norb
Hecker expressed similar
confidence in appraising the
chances of his Red squad. "We're
confident," Hecker said. "We've
got three of the four regular
defensive linemen in addition to
Boryla and (John) Winesberry."
Tomorrow's scrimmage will be
conducted just like a regular game
except that the coaching staff
decided not to risk injuries on
kickoffs after scores. There will be
an opening kickoff, but after each
score the offensive team will
receive the ball on its own 30 yard
line.
Coaches' Draft
The two teams were chosen in
a draft by the assistant coaches.
The Red squad won the toss and
apparently picked Boryla as their
first offensive choice. The White
squad got the first pick on defense,
most likely Poltl.
With the exception of center
Bill Reid and halfback Sig
Ostrom, Stanford's forces are
basically healthy for tomorrow's
game. Reid underwent knee
surgery Wednesday as the result of
an injury he suffered in Tuesday's
practice and Ostrom is a doubtful
performer tomorrow because of a
minor muscle pull.
Reserve quarterback Dave
Ottmar and defensive end Mark
Ferguson have been sitting out
most of spring practice after
suffering knee injuries during the
first week of spring drills.
Admission to tomorrow's game
is free.

With the exception of center
Bill Reid and halfback Sig
Ostrom, Stanford's forces are
basically healthy for tomorrow's
game. Reid underwent knee
surgery Wednesday as the result of
an injury he suffered in Tuesday's
practice and Ostrom is a doubtful
performer tomorrow because of a
minor muscle pull.
Reserve quarterback Dave
Ottmar and defensive end Mark
Ferguson have been sitting out
most of spring practice after
suffering knee injuries during the
first week of spring drills.
Admission to tomorrow's game
is free.

GRID PREVIEW TOMORROW-Quarterback Mike Boryla will lead
the Red squad against the Whites tomorrow morning in the annual
Red-White scrimmage at Stanford Stadium. Admission to the game is
free and kickoff time is 9:30 a.m.
Quarterback Mike Boryla may
be throwing against the toughest
secondary hell face in 1973 when
Stanford concludes its spring
football drills tomorrow morning
with the annual Red-White game
at Stanford Stadium. Kickoff time
is 9:30 a.m.
Boryla will quarterback the
Red squad in the game-type
scrimmage which matches a pair
of teams that should play
contrasting styles of football. The
defending champion Red team
will most likely keep the ball«
airborne, while the underdog
White squad hopes to control the
tempo of the game with a strong
ground attack.
"We feel we've got a good,
solid team," said Pete Kettela, one
of the coaches of the White squad.
"They've got the quarterback, but
we counteracted that with the top
receivers and secondary."
Defensive halfback James
Ferguson and strong safety Randy
Poltl will anchor an outstanding
White secondary which also
includes Craig Zaltoski, Roland
Young, and Gerald Wilson.
Strong Running
Kettela thinks the White squad
will also feature a strong running
attack. "We feel like Doug Jena

and David Tenn have had as good
a spring as anybody," Kettela
said, "and with two of the
probable starting offensive tackles
(Keith Rowen and Todd
Anderson), we should be able to
control the ball on the ground."

Defensive co-ordinator Norb
Hecker expressed similar
confidence in appraising the
chances of his Red squad. "We're
confident," Hecker said. "We've
got three of the four regular
defensive linemen in addition to
Boryla and (John) Winesberry."
Tomorrow's scrimmage will be
conducted just like a regular game
except that the coaching staff
decided not to risk injuries on
kickoffs after scores. There will be
an opening kickoff, but after each
score the offensive team will
receive the ball on its own 30 yard
line.
Coaches' Draft
The two teams were chosen in
a draft by the assistant coaches.
The Red squad won the toss and
apparently picked Boryla as their
first offensive choice. The White
squad got the first pick on defense,
most likely Poltl.
With the exception of center
Bill Reid and halfback Sig
Ostrom, Stanford's forces are
basically healthy for tomorrow's
game. Reid underwent knee
surgery Wednesday as the result of
an injury he suffered in Tuesday's
