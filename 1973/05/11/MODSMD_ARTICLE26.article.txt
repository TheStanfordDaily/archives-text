# Spikers Face Final Tuneup For Pac-8’s
## 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
Coach Payton Jordan and a
14-man contingent from the
Stanford track team travel to
Fresno tomorrow to compete in
the annual West Coast Relays at
Ratcliffe Stadium. The meet will
begin in the afternoon with
preliminary heats and several field
events and continue into the
evening.
"This will be a fine tune-up for
the Pac-8 Championships," Jordan
said. "It will also give some of the
guys who are close to the Pac-8
qualifying standards one more
chance to make them."
The athletes he referred to
include discus throwers Pete
Dreissigacker and Jim Royer.
Dreissigacker's lifetime best of
169-2, which he threw last week
against Cal, is only 10 inches off
the qualifying mark.
Rick Larson will be trying to
qualify in the javelin. He has
thrown 207-2 this year. Derek
Toliver, who improved over two
feet last week in the triple jump,
will be trying to better his 47-ll 1 /2
mark to the Pac-8 standard.
Along with Dreissigacker and
Royer in the discus will be Jim
Howard, whose 174-2 toss has
already qualified him for the
conference championships.
Besides Larson in the javelin will
be Steve Hopkins, whose 221-2
throw has likewise met the Pac-8
standard.
Terry Albritton, who pushed
the school shot put record to
61-QV2 last Saturday, will be
shooting to crack the 62 foot
barrier. Tom Anderson, who came
into this season with a 25-2 V2
jump to his credit, will be aiming
to better the 24-3/4 leap that is
his best so far this year.
Though upset by Cal's John
Nichols in the 220 last week, Ken
Curl still won his specialty, the
100, in 9.9. He will be competing
in that event at Fresno. Curl has a

9.6 season's best and 9.3 lifetime
mark.
Dave Bagshaw will be running
both the high and intermediate
hurdles. He set lifetime bests of
14.1 in the highs and 52.6 in the
intermediates last week against
Cal. Joining him in the
intermediates will be Matt
Hogsett, who has run 53.0 this
season.
Stanford's mile relay team of
Curl, Hogsett, Bagshaw, and John
Anderson has run 3.15.4 this
season but may not compete in
tomorrow's meet.
The Cards' strongest event
should be the distance medley
relay. With John Anderson
running the 440, Vernell Jackson
the 880, Les McFadden the 1320
and Brian Mittelstaedt the mile,
the squad won the event at the
Mt. SAC relays this year in
9:51.1. For the Fresno meet
Mittelstaedt and McFadden will
be trading places, Mittelstaedt
running the 1320 and McFadden
running the mile.

both the high and intermediate
hurdles. He set lifetime bests of
14.1 in the highs and 52.6 in the
intermediates last week against
Cal. Joining him in the
intermediates will be Matt
Hogsett, who has run 53.0 this
season.
Stanford's mile relay team of
Curl, Hogsett, Bagshaw, and John
Anderson has run 3.15.4 this
season but may not compete in
tomorrow's meet.
The Cards' strongest event
should be the distance medley
relay. With John Anderson
running the 440, Vernell Jackson
the 880, Les McFadden the 1320
and Brian Mittelstaedt the mile,
the squad won the event at the
Mt. SAC relays this year in
9:51.1. For the Fresno meet
Mittelstaedt and McFadden will
be trading places, Mittelstaedt
running the 1320 and McFadden
running the mile.

THINKING MAN'S BALLPLAYER-Bob Hampton, who currently
leads the Stanford hitters with a .401 batting average, plans to disdain
a professional baseball career for a career in politics or school
administration.
Coach Payton Jordan and a
14-man contingent from the
Stanford track team travel to
Fresno tomorrow to compete in
the annual West Coast Relays at
Ratcliffe Stadium. The meet will
begin in the afternoon with
preliminary heats and several field
events and continue into the
evening.
"This will be a fine tune-up for
the Pac-8 Championships," Jordan
said. "It will also give some of the
guys who are close to the Pac-8
qualifying standards one more
chance to make them."
The athletes he referred to
include discus throwers Pete
Dreissigacker and Jim Royer.
Dreissigacker's lifetime best of
169-2, which he threw last week
against Cal, is only 10 inches off
the qualifying mark.
Rick Larson will be trying to
qualify in the javelin. He has
thrown 207-2 this year. Derek
Toliver, who improved over two
feet last week in the triple jump,
will be trying to better his 47-ll 1 /2
mark to the Pac-8 standard.
Along with Dreissigacker and
Royer in the discus will be Jim
Howard, whose 174-2 toss has
already qualified him for the
conference championships.
Besides Larson in the javelin will
be Steve Hopkins, whose 221-2
throw has likewise met the Pac-8
standard.
Terry Albritton, who pushed
the school shot put record to
61-QV2 last Saturday, will be
shooting to crack the 62 foot
barrier. Tom Anderson, who came
into this season with a 25-2 V2
jump to his credit, will be aiming
to better the 24-3/4 leap that is
his best so far this year.
Though upset by Cal's John
Nichols in the 220 last week, Ken
Curl still won his specialty, the
100, in 9.9. He will be competing
in that event at Fresno. Curl has a

9.6 season's best and 9.3 lifetime
mark.
Dave Bagshaw will be running
both the high and intermediate
hurdles. He set lifetime bests of
14.1 in the highs and 52.6 in the
intermediates last week against
Cal. Joining him in the
intermediates will be Matt
Hogsett, who has run 53.0 this
