# Boasts .401 Batting Average
## Introspective Hampton Leads Card Hitters 
### SCOTT DAILEY 
After all the interviews were
over, the best word to describe
Stanford sophomore outfielder
Bob Hampton seemed to be
"Introspective." As Coach Ray
Young put it, "Bob's a deep
thinker. He's not afraid to ask a
question, and he's not afraid to
demand an answer."
Hampton, who leads the Cards
in both home runs, with six, and
batting average with a .401 mark,
intends to do a great deal of
thinking in the next six months
about his role on the ballclub.
Like virtually the entire team,
Hampton has been disappointed
with the Cards' less than satisfying
performance this season.
"I need to sit back this summer
and analyze what went wrong,"
mused Hampton. "It's going to be
important because I'm going to be
a junior next year on a young
team. I'm going to have to be a
leader.
Fresh and Ready
"But I'm going to need this
next half-year to figure it out.
That's one reason I didn't go to
Anchorage (to play semi-pro ball)
last summer. I figured with my
attitudes, I might even get sick of
baseball; this way, I'll be fresh,
and ready to play my role,
whatever it may be."
He will have an atmosphere
conducive to thought this
summer and fall — the quiet, rural
area of Cliveden at
Stanford-in-England.
Hampton's "attitudes" are
those of not only an athlete, but
of an active student, for which
baseball is a significant, but not
singular aspect of his current life.
Hampton, who was drafted by
the New York Mets in 1971 but
turned down pro baseball to
attend Stanford, explained, "My
question was, 'Is it possible for a
person not motivated to play
professionally to do well in top
collegiate competition?' At least,
this season has proved to me that

anybody who has the ability and
wants to play is capable of playing
in the Pac-8.
School Primary Concern
"My main concern was getting
into a good school,"Hampton
continued. When he learned of his
admittance to Stanford,
Hampton, like most people who
are admitted to a prestigious
university, felt he couldn't turn it
down.
Determined to derive the
maximum benefit of his four
years here he is enrolled in an
integrated program in the social
sciences in which he will study 30
units of Political Science and 20
units of Psychology.
He has always been interested
in politics, and one reason he
didn't play ball last summer was
the opportunity to attend the
Stanford-in-Washington program.
He worked as a Congressman's

aide, and prepared studies for
numerous Congressional
committees, including the
Subcommittee on Discrimination
in Education.
"It was sort of a disenchanting
experience," said Hampton of his
summer in Washington."I could
really see how things are really
slowed down. It's not just
conservatives — it's liberals too,
and all their ego trips really make
things go slowly."
May Enter Politics
Although his appetite for
politics was filled with a rather
sour meal in Washington,

Hampton still has casual plans to
enter politics at some time, saying
that he might still be interested in
a political office at the municipal
or state level.
But his major interest is in
education. He is presently
planning a career in school
administration. But he does not
want to be merely another school
administrator —he wants to be
bilingual.
"There's a real need for
bilingual teachers," maintained
Hampton. "There are a lot of
Spanish-speaking kids who don't
get the education they need

because they don't understand
English very well, and their
teachers don't speak Spanish."
Just as Hampton is not content
to be a run-of-the-mill educator,
Young says he is not satisfied with
being an ordinary ballplayer.
'Disciplined Hitter'
"He's not satisfied with just
one or two hits. Every time he
goes up to the plate, it's like it's
the first time he was up; he's
always looking for a hit. He's
developed into a much more
disciplined hitter. He's learned to
lay off that pitch that's going to
be an easy out — he's developed
the ability to wait.
"He plays intensely and with a
lot of hustle. You can see it in the
way he runs the bases. When he
takes the tum at first base, he
takes that big turn and he's always
ready to go on to second if the
outfielder bobbles the ball.
"He always plays at 100
percent, and he plays the game
with a great deal of enjoyment.
He definitely has the ability to
play pro ball should he want to.
His speed is certainly adequate,
and he has a very strong arm."
It is the enjoyment, though,
that Hampton wants primarily
from college baseball. "For many
people, a pro career is a very real
thing, but after school, I think I'll
have gotten all the enjoyment and
satisfaction out of it that I'm
going to get. I feel to play pro
baseball would be misusing the
other abilities I do have."
