# Cards Meet Bears In Weekend Series
## 
### 
Hoping to salvage a .500 conference season and
shooting for a possible second place league finish,
Stanford's baseball team faces California this
weekend in the final series of the season. A single
game is scheduled for 2:30 p.m. today in Berkeley
with a noon doubleheader tomorrow at Sunken
Diamond.
USC has already clinched the Pac-8 Southern
Division title, but this weekend's Stanford-Cal and
USC-UCLA series will determine second place. The
Trojans, currently 11-3 in the league, are followed
by UCLA (6-8), Stanford (6-9), and Cal (6-9).
Stanford coach Ray Young has listed Bob
DiPietro (4-2, 1.48) as today's starting pitcher with
Dave Frost (5-0, 2.02) and A 1 Arthur (7-2, 1.48)
scheduled to pitch in tomorrow's doubleheader. All
three pitched brilliantly last weekend against UCLA,
DiPietro losing 2-1 on Friday before Frost and

Arthur hurled Stanford to a sweep in Saturday's
doubleheader. Frost won the first game 4-2 and
Arthur was credited with the 3-1 victory in the
nightcap.
Arthur, who also has a 3-0 shutout over USC to
his credit, currently ranks at the top of the Pac-8
pitching charts with a 2-0 conference record and a
0.00 ERA. He has yet to allow an earned run in
18-2/3 innings of league action.
The Cards' overall record now stands at 31-20
after two non-league losses during the week.
Stanford lost at San Jose State on Tuesday and
suffered a 12-4 setback to Cal State Hay ward
Wednesday at Sunken Diamond. Wednesday three
Cardinal pitches allowed 17 hits and the Stanford
defense committed four errors, wasting a 14-hit
offensive performance.
