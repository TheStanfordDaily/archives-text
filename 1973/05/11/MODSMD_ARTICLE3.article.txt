# FBI Records Missing On Ellsberg Wiretap
## 
### 
From The Associated Press
LOS ANGELES — The Pentagon
papers trial judge was told yesterday
that defendant Daniel Ellsberg was
overheard on FBI wiretaps as long as
two years before he released the
papers to news media, but that records
of the wiretaps are missing from the
FBI files.
The disclosure that a telephone
conversation of Ellsberg's had been
tapped while he was at a friend's home
was made by the new acting FBI
director, William Ruckelshaus, in a
memo to the judge.
Judge Matt Byrne immediately
stopped further proceedings in the
trial and ordered the government to
find all records on electronic
surveillance of Ellsberg.
But later the judge received word
from the Justice Department in
Washington that the records are
missing.
Mitchell And Nixon
Defense attorneys immediately
charged that the records were either
intentionally destroyed or hidden.
Ellsberg's chief attorney, Leonard
Boudin, citing news reports to that
effect, asked that the government
question former Atty. Gen. John
Mitchell and, if necessary, question
President Nixon himself about the
whereabouts of the records.
The judge ordered the government
to get moving on its inquiry into the
records' disappearance and told
attorneys to be ready this morning to
present legal arguments on whether
the case should be thrown out because
of the revelation of the electronic
surveillance.
The government has been under
orders for more than a year to tell the
judge about all wiretaps relating to the
trial.
Home Phone
The Justice Department said the
home phone of Morton Halperin, a
former deputy assistant secretary of

defense, had been tapped from the
spring of 1969 to June 1971. During
that time, Ruckelshaus' memo said, a
conversation involving Ellsberg was
monitored by the FBI while he was a
guest at Halperin's home.
The Justice Department said
records of the surveillance Halperin's
phone disappeared from the FBI files
some time between July and October
of 1971.
The department said the wiretaps
of Halperin's phone were authorized
by "the attorney general." Mitchell
was attorney general in 1969.
First Disclosure
This was the first disclosure that
Ellsberg, whose name did not surface
publicly until 1971 when he released
the Pentagon papers, had been
overheard on wiretaps. A member of
the defense team was overheard by the
government last summer but it was
determined the tap was directed at
another person unrelated to the case.
Over objections by the prosecutor,
Judge Byrne made public an FBI
report on an interview with Charles W.
Colson, President Nixon's former
counsel, in which Colson said he was
told by White House Adviser John D.
Ehrlichman about the burglary of
Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office.
Colson told the FBI that
Ehrlichman and former White House
counsel John Dean told him to keep
silent about the burglary when
questioned by the FBI and the
Watergate prosecutor.
"Ehrlichman told him this was a
national security matter and not to be
discussed with anyone," said the FBI
report, referring to the time when
Ehrlichman first told Colson the
burglary had occurred.
Asked about other conversations on
the burglary, Colson told the agents he
recalled that before talking to the FBI
and Watergate prosecutor Earl J.
Silbert about the Watergate matters,
he consulted with Dean.

another person unrelated to the case.
Over objections by the prosecutor,
Judge Byrne made public an FBI
report on an interview with Charles W.
Colson, President Nixon's former
counsel, in which Colson said he was
told by White House Adviser John D.
Ehrlichman about the burglary of
Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office.
Colson told the FBI that
Ehrlichman and former White House
counsel John Dean told him to keep
silent about the burglary when
questioned by the FBI and the
Watergate prosecutor.
"Ehrlichman told him this was a
national security matter and not to be
discussed with anyone," said the FBI
report, referring to the time when
Ehrlichman first told Colson the
burglary had occurred.
Asked about other conversations on
the burglary, Colson told the agents he
recalled that before talking to the FBI
and Watergate prosecutor Earl J.
Silbert about the Watergate matters,
he consulted with Dean.

WHAT'S BUGGING HIM? — According to the new acting FBI director William
Ruckelshaus, Daniel Ellsberg, pictured above, had been overheard on an FBI
wiretap two years before he released the Pentagon papers to the news media.
Records of the wiretap are missing from FBI files.
From The Associated Press
LOS ANGELES — The Pentagon
papers trial judge was told yesterday
that defendant Daniel Ellsberg was
overheard on FBI wiretaps as long as
two years before he released the
papers to news media, but that records
of the wiretaps are missing from the
FBI files.
The disclosure that a telephone
conversation of Ellsberg's had been
tapped while he was at a friend's home
was made by the new acting FBI
director, William Ruckelshaus, in a
memo to the judge.
Judge Matt Byrne immediately
stopped further proceedings in the
trial and ordered the government to
find all records on electronic
surveillance of Ellsberg.
But later the judge received word
from the Justice Department in
Washington that the records are
missing.
Mitchell And Nixon
Defense attorneys immediately
charged that the records were either
intentionally destroyed or hidden.
Ellsberg's chief attorney, Leonard
Boudin, citing news reports to that
effect, asked that the government
question former Atty. Gen. John
Mitchell and, if necessary, question
President Nixon himself about the
whereabouts of the records.
The judge ordered the government
to get moving on its inquiry into the
records' disappearance and told
attorneys to be ready this morning to
present legal arguments on whether
the case should be thrown out because
of the revelation of the electronic
surveillance.
The government has been under
orders for more than a year to tell the
judge about all wiretaps relating to the
trial.
Home Phone
The Justice Department said the
home phone of Morton Halperin, a
former deputy assistant secretary of

defense, had been tapped from the
spring of 1969 to June 1971. During
that time, Ruckelshaus' memo said, a
conversation involving Ellsberg was
monitored by the FBI while he was a
guest at Halperin's home.
The Justice Department said
records of the surveillance Halperin's
phone disappeared from the FBI files
some time between July and October
of 1971.
The department said the wiretaps
of Halperin's phone were authorized
by "the attorney general." Mitchell
was attorney general in 1969.
First Disclosure
This was the first disclosure that
Ellsberg, whose name did not surface
publicly until 1971 when he released
the Pentagon papers, had been
overheard on wiretaps. A member of
the defense team was overheard by the
government last summer but it was
determined the tap was directed at
another person unrelated to the case.
Over objections by the prosecutor,
Judge Byrne made public an FBI
report on an interview with Charles W.
Colson, President Nixon's former
counsel, in which Colson said he was
told by White House Adviser John D.
Ehrlichman about the burglary of
