# Cards Face Cal In Big Row
## 
### MIKE CHASSON 
Stanford's crew will meet California in the Big
Row tomorrow on the Oakland Estuary, Stanford's
final tuneup before next weekend's Western Sprints.
The Edwin Harbach Cup will go to the winner of
two of the three heavyweight races — varsity, junior
varsity, and freshmen. Last year the Bears swept all
three heavyweight divisions to end a two-year
domination by the Cards.
Stanford's varsity shell is coming off a third place
finish in a race against UCLA and USC last Friday in
Los Angeles. The junior varsity and freshmen eights
finished second in their respective races.
However, last Saturday the Cards' varsity four shell
upset previously unbeaten USC at the Newport
Regatta at Newport Beach.
The Bears, meanwhile, are coming off a
hard-fcught loss to powerful Washington in Seattle

last Saturday. California is now considered the
second best varsity shell on the Coast following the
defeat to the Huskies.
The Cardinals will be hard pressed to defeat the
Bears as Cal has defeated UCLA earlier in the season
and last weekend defeated Oregon State by four
lengths. Stanford lost to UCLA last Friday and
earlier in the year lost to the Beavers by one length.
One factor working in Stanford's favor is the fact
that Cal is mentally down following the loss to
Washington. The Bears had hoped to pull the upset
of the season but the Huskies blew by them in the
final 500 meters.
The meeting will be the first of three between
Stanford and Cal. The two crews will clash in the
Western Sprint next weekend in Los Gatos and in a
special dual in Redding on May 27.
The first race tomorrow will begin at 8:50 a.m.
