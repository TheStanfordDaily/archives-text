McCord Reveals Mitchell Tie-in
WASHINGTON — Watergate conspirator James W.
McCord says he was told logs of wiretapped conversations
were delivered to John N. Mitchell while he was President
Nixon's campaign director, court papers showed
yesterday.
McCord also said in a pre-trial statement taken under
oath April 30 and May 1, that he was told Mitchell urged
the Watergate bugging crew to get into operation as
quickly as possible.
The information in both cases, McCord testified, came
from G. Gordon Liddy, another convicted Watergate
figure who was boss of the crew that entered and bugged
Democratic Party headquarters over the Memorial
weekend last year.
He said Liddy also told him that an espionage budget
of $50,000 had been approved by White House counsel
John W. Dean 111 and former Atty. Gen. Mitchell and that
another $100,000 was available.
Mitchell and former Commerce Secretary Maurice H.
Stans were indicted yesterday in New York on federal
charges of influence peddling conspiracy and perjury in a
separate matter growing out of a secret $200,000
contribution to Nixon's re-election campaign. Nixon fired
Dean April 30 and Dean claimed yesterday unnamed
persons were out to discredit and censor what he has to
say about the Watergate Affair.
The McCord deposition was taken in connection with
the Democrats' $6.4 million civil suit against Committee
for the Re-election of the President and others connected
with the Nixon campaign.
House Opposed To U.S. Bombing?
WASHINGTON — The House yesterday passed a measure
interpreted as opposing continued U.S. bombing in
Cambodia.
It approved an amendment by Rep. Joseph P. Addabbo
(D-N.Y.), denying President Nixon's $430 million-defense
spending transfer request, including at least $175 million
for the bombing and other Indochina activities.
The vote was 219 to 188.
Secretary of Defense Elliot L. Richardson has said the
bombing effort to force a Cambodia cease-fire would not
be obstructed by congressional rejection of the transfer
authority.
The vote marked the first antiwar measure passed by
the House during the Indochina conflict.
"When it's this close you can't forecast the outcome,"
said House Republican Leader Gerald R. Ford of
Michigan, who wanted House support for the bombing.
Republican Conference Chairman John B. Anderson of
Illinois said he was among past supporters of Presidents'
war policies who turned against the bombing after
"intensive soul searching."
"You cannot create the structure of peace with a rain
of falling bombs," Anderson said in opening House
debate.
At issue was authority in a $2.8 billion supplemental
money bill to transfer $430 million for defense spending,
including some $175 million for the bombing and other
Indochina activities.
Tornadoes Kill Four In Ohio
WILLARD, Ohio — Four persons were killed and more

than 100 injured by tornadoes skipping across northern
Ohio last night.
Three persons were killed when a tornado heavily
damaged Willard, a north-central Ohio community of
6,000 persons. Officials in Willard said five children were
unaccounted for and more than 100 persons were injured.
Another person was killed at Republic, to the south,
when a twister blew a car off a road.
Numerous snaking funnels were sighted in Ohio from
the Indiana border at the west to the Pennsylvania line at
the east. Some were seen as far south as Interstate 70, a
major highway which cuts the state's waist east and west,
and as far north as communities near Cleveland. Many of
the funnels did not touch down, and some of those that
did hit sparsely populated areas, causing little or no
damage.
The tornadoes spawned in Indiana appeared to be
easing in Ohio late last night, but warnings were issued in
sections of Kentucky, West Virginia and Pennsylvania.
At least 14 persons were injured and hospitalized in the
Bellville-Butler area.
Senate Sets Budget Ceiling
WASHINGTON — The Senate yesterday overwhelmingly
passed a bill to severely curb President Nixon's
impoundment powers and to fix a $268 billion spending
ceiling in the year ahead.
There were separate votes on the two parts. The
impoundment provisions, sponsored by Sen. Sam J. Ervin
Jr. (D-N.C.) were passed 66-24. The budget ceiling,
offered by Sen. Edmund S. Muskie (D-Maine) got an 86-4
vote.
Identical legislation was added by the Senate as an
amendment to a dollar devaluation bill passed April 5 and
sent to the House.
However, Ervin said at the time he doubted the other
branch would accept the amendment since it was
extraneous to the main purpose of the bill.
But Ervin said he was more hopeful of House
agreement to the separate measure passed yesterday.
Democrats contend Nixon is illegally impounding $12
billion of funds voted by Congress. They argue that the
Constitution specifically gives the power to the purse to
Congress.
The President has said he is only using powers which
have been exercised by Presidents going back to the
beginning of the nation.

Senate Sets Budget Ceiling
WASHINGTON — The Senate yesterday overwhelmingly
passed a bill to severely curb President Nixon's
impoundment powers and to fix a $268 billion spending
ceiling in the year ahead.
There were separate votes on the two parts. The
impoundment provisions, sponsored by Sen. Sam J. Ervin
Jr. (D-N.C.) were passed 66-24. The budget ceiling,
offered by Sen. Edmund S. Muskie (D-Maine) got an 86-4
vote.
Identical legislation was added by the Senate as an
amendment to a dollar devaluation bill passed April 5 and
sent to the House.
However, Ervin said at the time he doubted the other
branch would accept the amendment since it was
extraneous to the main purpose of the bill.
But Ervin said he was more hopeful of House
agreement to the separate measure passed yesterday.
Democrats contend Nixon is illegally impounding $12
billion of funds voted by Congress. They argue that the
Constitution specifically gives the power to the purse to
Congress.
The President has said he is only using powers which
have been exercised by Presidents going back to the
beginning of the nation.

McCord Reveals Mitchell Tie-in
WASHINGTON — Watergate conspirator James W.
McCord says he was told logs of wiretapped conversations
were delivered to John N. Mitchell while he was President
Nixon's campaign director, court papers showed
yesterday.
McCord also said in a pre-trial statement taken under
oath April 30 and May 1, that he was told Mitchell urged
the Watergate bugging crew to get into operation as
quickly as possible.
The information in both cases, McCord testified, came
from G. Gordon Liddy, another convicted Watergate
figure who was boss of the crew that entered and bugged
Democratic Party headquarters over the Memorial
weekend last year.
He said Liddy also told him that an espionage budget
of $50,000 had been approved by White House counsel
John W. Dean 111 and former Atty. Gen. Mitchell and that
another $100,000 was available.
Mitchell and former Commerce Secretary Maurice H.
Stans were indicted yesterday in New York on federal
charges of influence peddling conspiracy and perjury in a
separate matter growing out of a secret $200,000
contribution to Nixon's re-election campaign. Nixon fired
Dean April 30 and Dean claimed yesterday unnamed
persons were out to discredit and censor what he has to
say about the Watergate Affair.
The McCord deposition was taken in connection with
the Democrats' $6.4 million civil suit against Committee
for the Re-election of the President and others connected
with the Nixon campaign.
House Opposed To U.S. Bombing?
WASHINGTON — The House yesterday passed a measure
interpreted as opposing continued U.S. bombing in
Cambodia.
It approved an amendment by Rep. Joseph P. Addabbo
(D-N.Y.), denying President Nixon's $430 million-defense
spending transfer request, including at least $175 million
for the bombing and other Indochina activities.
The vote was 219 to 188.
Secretary of Defense Elliot L. Richardson has said the
bombing effort to force a Cambodia cease-fire would not
be obstructed by congressional rejection of the transfer
authority.
The vote marked the first antiwar measure passed by
the House during the Indochina conflict.
"When it's this close you can't forecast the outcome,"
said House Republican Leader Gerald R. Ford of
Michigan, who wanted House support for the bombing.
Republican Conference Chairman John B. Anderson of
Illinois said he was among past supporters of Presidents'
war policies who turned against the bombing after
"intensive soul searching."
"You cannot create the structure of peace with a rain
of falling bombs," Anderson said in opening House
debate.
At issue was authority in a $2.8 billion supplemental
money bill to transfer $430 million for defense spending,
including some $175 million for the bombing and other
Indochina activities.
Tornadoes Kill Four In Ohio
WILLARD, Ohio — Four persons were killed and more

than 100 injured by tornadoes skipping across northern
Ohio last night.
Three persons were killed when a tornado heavily
damaged Willard, a north-central Ohio community of
6,000 persons. Officials in Willard said five children were
unaccounted for and more than 100 persons were injured.
Another person was killed at Republic, to the south,
when a twister blew a car off a road.
Numerous snaking funnels were sighted in Ohio from
the Indiana border at the west to the Pennsylvania line at
the east. Some were seen as far south as Interstate 70, a
major highway which cuts the state's waist east and west,
and as far north as communities near Cleveland. Many of
the funnels did not touch down, and some of those that
did hit sparsely populated areas, causing little or no
damage.
The tornadoes spawned in Indiana appeared to be
easing in Ohio late last night, but warnings were issued in
sections of Kentucky, West Virginia and Pennsylvania.
At least 14 persons were injured and hospitalized in the

for the bombing and other Indochina activities.
The vote was 219 to 188.
Secretary of Defense Elliot L. Richardson has said the
bombing effort to force a Cambodia cease-fire would not
be obstructed by congressional rejection of the transfer
authority.
The vote marked the first antiwar measure passed by
the House during the Indochina conflict.
"When it's this close you can't forecast the outcome,"
said House Republican Leader Gerald R. Ford of
Michigan, who wanted House support for the bombing.
Republican Conference Chairman John B. Anderson of
Illinois said he was among past supporters of Presidents'
war policies who turned against the bombing after
"intensive soul searching."
"You cannot create the structure of peace with a rain
of falling bombs," Anderson said in opening House
debate.
At issue was authority in a $2.8 billion supplemental
money bill to transfer $430 million for defense spending,
including some $175 million for the bombing and other
Indochina activities.
Tornadoes Kill Four In Ohio
WILLARD, Ohio — Four persons were killed and more

than 100 injured by tornadoes skipping across northern
Ohio last night.
Three persons were killed when a tornado heavily
damaged Willard, a north-central Ohio community of
6,000 persons. Officials in Willard said five children were
unaccounted for and more than 100 persons were injured.
Another person was killed at Republic, to the south,
when a twister blew a car off a road.
Numerous snaking funnels were sighted in Ohio from
the Indiana border at the west to the Pennsylvania line at
the east. Some were seen as far south as Interstate 70, a
major highway which cuts the state's waist east and west,
and as far north as communities near Cleveland. Many of
the funnels did not touch down, and some of those that
did hit sparsely populated areas, causing little or no
damage.
The tornadoes spawned in Indiana appeared to be
easing in Ohio late last night, but warnings were issued in
sections of Kentucky, West Virginia and Pennsylvania.
At least 14 persons were injured and hospitalized in the
Bellville-Butler area.
Senate Sets Budget Ceiling
WASHINGTON — The Senate yesterday overwhelmingly
passed a bill to severely curb President Nixon's
impoundment powers and to fix a $268 billion spending
ceiling in the year ahead.
There were separate votes on the two parts. The
impoundment provisions, sponsored by Sen. Sam J. Ervin
Jr. (D-N.C.) were passed 66-24. The budget ceiling,
offered by Sen. Edmund S. Muskie (D-Maine) got an 86-4
vote.
Identical legislation was added by the Senate as an
amendment to a dollar devaluation bill passed April 5 and
sent to the House.
However, Ervin said at the time he doubted the other
branch would accept the amendment since it was
extraneous to the main purpose of the bill.
But Ervin said he was more hopeful of House
agreement to the separate measure passed yesterday.
Democrats contend Nixon is illegally impounding $12
billion of funds voted by Congress. They argue that the
Constitution specifically gives the power to the purse to
Congress.
The President has said he is only using powers which
have been exercised by Presidents going back to the
beginning of the nation.

McCord Reveals Mitchell Tie-in
WASHINGTON — Watergate conspirator James W.
McCord says he was told logs of wiretapped conversations
were delivered to John N. Mitchell while he was President
Nixon's campaign director, court papers showed
yesterday.
McCord also said in a pre-trial statement taken under
oath April 30 and May 1, that he was told Mitchell urged
the Watergate bugging crew to get into operation as
quickly as possible.
The information in both cases, McCord testified, came
from G. Gordon Liddy, another convicted Watergate
figure who was boss of the crew that entered and bugged
Democratic Party headquarters over the Memorial
weekend last year.
He said Liddy also told him that an espionage budget
of $50,000 had been approved by White House counsel
John W. Dean 111 and former Atty. Gen. Mitchell and that
another $100,000 was available.
Mitchell and former Commerce Secretary Maurice H.
Stans were indicted yesterday in New York on federal
charges of influence peddling conspiracy and perjury in a
separate matter growing out of a secret $200,000
contribution to Nixon's re-election campaign. Nixon fired
Dean April 30 and Dean claimed yesterday unnamed
persons were out to discredit and censor what he has to
say about the Watergate Affair.
The McCord deposition was taken in connection with
the Democrats' $6.4 million civil suit against Committee
for the Re-election of the President and others connected
with the Nixon campaign.
House Opposed To U.S. Bombing?
WASHINGTON — The House yesterday passed a measure
interpreted as opposing continued U.S. bombing in
