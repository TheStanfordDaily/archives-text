# Students Raise University Funds
## 
### CHESS ERWIN 
"The time has come to get more
students involved in the fund-raising
process," declares Bob Ducommun,
former coordinator for the Student
Development Committee, a student
fund-raising group.
The Student Development
Committee (SDC) was formed in 1968
to coordinate the activities of the
Stanford Heritage Fund and the
Stanford University Now (SUN)
program.
This year, the Heritage Fund
provided seven partial-tuition and one
full-tuition scholarships. The funds for
these scholarships, totalling $16,000,
were solicited from businessmen in the
Bay Area and Los Angeles through the
work of 30 student volunteers.

SDC volunteer Rick Rolandi says
that SUN originated in 1970 as an
effort to attract donations directly
from students. "They got nothing," he
said. "So now the focus of the group is
on educating the students to
Stanford's financial situation through
displays, symposia on finances and
other means."
The SDC is part of the University's
Annual Fund, operating out of the
General Secretary's office, and is "the
only completely student run fund
group in the University," according to
Rolandi.
Businessmen and alumni are
generally enthusiastic towards student
fund-raisers, says Rolandi. However,
he notes "a couple of years ago,
during the demonstrations, all
fund-raisers had trouble raising money
from businessmen, and especially from
the alumni."
Recently, he says, the New
Founders League (NFL), a
conservative alumni group, has made
fund-raising harder. "The information
put out by the NFL has been
counter-productive in fund-raising. It
has affected both businessmen and
alumni contributions adversely."
Rolandi claims that student
fund-raisers are encouraged to be
honest and frank with everyone they
approach for donations. However, he
admits, "our volunteers tend to be
inherently interested in the University
and as such, not as critical of it as
others are."
Students can make a major
difference in fund-raising, according to
Rolandi. Jess Haugh, a SUN volunteer,
secured a $67,000 pledge from an
alumnus during a recent Annual Fund
phone-a-thon. "Alumni and
businessmen want to hear about
people and the University through
students," Rolandi said. The Fund has
30 student-solicitors and SUN has 10

to 15 more.
Few students are aware of the
magnitude of University finances, say
SDC volunteers. The operating budget
of the University will amount to
almost $74 million in 1973-74.
Ducommun points out that tuition
covers only about 40 percent of the
operating budget.
He says that the rest of the money,
almost $44 million, must come from
donations and other sources.

The SDC is part of the University's
Annual Fund, operating out of the
General Secretary's office, and is "the
only completely student run fund
group in the University," according to
Rolandi.
Businessmen and alumni are
generally enthusiastic towards student
fund-raisers, says Rolandi. However,
he notes "a couple of years ago,
during the demonstrations, all
fund-raisers had trouble raising money
from businessmen, and especially from
the alumni."
Recently, he says, the New
Founders League (NFL), a
conservative alumni group, has made
fund-raising harder. "The information
put out by the NFL has been
counter-productive in fund-raising. It
has affected both businessmen and
alumni contributions adversely."
Rolandi claims that student
fund-raisers are encouraged to be
honest and frank with everyone they
approach for donations. However, he
admits, "our volunteers tend to be
inherently interested in the University
and as such, not as critical of it as
others are."
Students can make a major
difference in fund-raising, according to
Rolandi. Jess Haugh, a SUN volunteer,
secured a $67,000 pledge from an
alumnus during a recent Annual Fund
phone-a-thon. "Alumni and
businessmen want to hear about
people and the University through
students," Rolandi said. The Fund has
30 student-solicitors and SUN has 10

to 15 more.
Few students are aware of the
magnitude of University finances, say
SDC volunteers. The operating budget
of the University will amount to
almost $74 million in 1973-74.
Ducommun points out that tuition
covers only about 40 percent of the
operating budget.
He says that the rest of the money,
almost $44 million, must come from
donations and other sources.
"The time has come to get more
students involved in the fund-raising
process," declares Bob Ducommun,
former coordinator for the Student
Development Committee, a student
fund-raising group.
The Student Development
Committee (SDC) was formed in 1968
to coordinate the activities of the
Stanford Heritage Fund and the
Stanford University Now (SUN)
program.
This year, the Heritage Fund
provided seven partial-tuition and one
full-tuition scholarships. The funds for
these scholarships, totalling $16,000,
were solicited from businessmen in the
Bay Area and Los Angeles through the
work of 30 student volunteers.

SDC volunteer Rick Rolandi says
that SUN originated in 1970 as an
effort to attract donations directly
from students. "They got nothing," he
said. "So now the focus of the group is
on educating the students to
Stanford's financial situation through
displays, symposia on finances and
other means."
