# Connally Named Special Advisor
## Nixon Nominates Defense Chief

From The Associated Press
WASHINGTON â€” President Nixon
shuffled personnel to fill
Watergate-created vacancies yesterday.
The President recalled new
Republican John B. Connally from
private life to be a special White House
adviser and nominated CIA Director
James R. Schlesinger for Secretary of
Defense.
Meanwhile, evicted White House
lawyer John W. Dean 111 charged
someone is out to keep him from
telling the full truth about Watergate
and attempts to cover up the scandal.
He said there are efforts to discredit
what he has to say.
In his move to the Pentagon,
Schlesinger would succeed Elliot L.
Richardson, who is undergoing Senate
confirmation hearings for Attorney
General. Richard G. Kleindienst,
resigned as Attorney General because
of close personal and official
associations with Watergate figures.
Nixon named William E. Colby to

replace Schlesinger as head of the CIA.
Pentagon general counsel J. Fred
Buzhardt Jr. was appointed as a special
counsel in the White House with "full
responsibility in matters relating to the
Watergate investigation."
The shuffling followed by 10 days
the resignation of Nixon's closest
aides, H.R. Haldeman and John D.
Ehrlichman, as chief of staff and
domestic assistant respectively.
Press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler, in
announcing the shifts and Connally's
return as a part-time, unpaid adviser,
said Nixon intends to maintain more
direct communication with his
Cabinet. The President informed the
Cabinet about the changes before
making them public.
Dean Issues Statement
Dean, dismissed as White House
counsel April 30, issued his statement
through an intermediary in wake of
published reports that Senate and
Justice Department lawyers feel he has
no evidence linking Nixon to the

Watergate coverup. There have been
contrary reports that he has such
evidence.
"The information contained in
these stories is neither complete nor
accurate," he said. "I have not, and
will not, leak my testimony to the
media."
While he was still the official
presidential lawyer, Dean issued a
statement saying he would not be
made a scapegoat for others' misdeeds.
He later put documents into a bank
safe deposit box and turned the key
over to U.S. Dist. Judge John J. Sirica,
who will hold a hearing Monday on
their disposition.
Distorted
In part, Dean's statement said:
"... I am not wiling to see the
truth distorted further, nor am I
willing to shoulder the blame for those
unwilling to accept the truth."
Ziegler would not comment on
Dean's statement or say whether the
under investigation by the SEC.
Out Of Country
Both Mitchell and Stans testified
twice before the grand jury. Vesco is
out of the country and refused to
accept a subpoena.
Vesco was said to have contributed
the $200,000 to Stans to try to delay
or derail an SEC probe of his far-flung
financial operations. Sears, a business
associate of Vesco, was described as a
go-between.
At one point, the indictment
claimed, Mitchell got hold of, and
suppressed, a written threat by Vesco
to disclose the secret cash contribution
unless the SEC dropped all
proceedings against him.
