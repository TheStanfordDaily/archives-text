# Byron Sher: No Stranger To Controversy
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
Byron D. Sher, professor of law and
soon-to-be Palo Alto City Councilman,
is no stranger to tough jobs and
controversy.
He has combined active
involvement in city and campus
politics with teaching and writing on
consumer protection and commercial
law during his 16 years at Stanford.
Last Tuesday he was the top
vote-getter among 18 City Council
candidates, winning back the Council
seat from which he was removed in a
1967 recall election.
He left the Council a victim of a
heated development vs. environment
controversy, and soon was drawn into
the storms of campus turmoil.
Grievance Committees
From 1968 to 1970, he chaired the
University Human Relations
Commission, then served on grievance
committees for University employees
fired after the April 1971 hospital
sit-in. The latter position especially
brought him considerable vilification
from radicals.
In the law school, Sher teaches a
first-year course in Contracts and
advanced courses in Commercial
Transactions and Consumer
Protection.
Surveys among students show that
he and his courses are popular in the
law school. The Law School Journal
noted that " 'I enjoyed myself was a

recurrent theme" among students
describing his courses.
Excellent Teacher
A former student described Sher as
"one of the most organized teachers in
the law school. .. Among the
students, he's known as an excellent
teacher."
Students also mentioned Sher's
"tremendous wit," a quality which
occasionally enlivened the employee
grievance hearings as well as his classes.
Oddly enough for a
professor-politician, his courses were
rated fairly low on "encouragement to
think about current issues."
Highly Competent
One faculty colleague said Sher was
"better known as a teacher than a
writer.... He's a highly competent
writer, but he's better known as a
teacher."
But Prof. William Warren, who like
Sher teaches commercial law, called
him "a nationally known, very
successful authority" in the field of
consumer law.
Sher was principal draftsman for a
model statute regulating door-to-door
sales, providing a "cooling-off period"
in which the customer may cancel a
contract made with a door-to-door
salesman.
Better Balance
He is also author of an article
advocating laws "to brinp the
relationship between funeral dir tor

and customer into better balance."
Sher suggests that the Palo Alto
City Attorney's office should use its
power to prosecute consumer fraud
cases, and proposes that the city make
consumer information available to
citizens.
"The city is a large-scale buyer and
a large supplier of services. It can share
with its people the information it
gets," he noted.
Commerce And Finance
Sher, 45, is a native Missourian who
graduated from Washington University
in St. Louis in 1949, as a commerce
and finance major who won academic
honors.
He received his law degree from
Harvard magna cum laude in 1952
after service on the Harvard Law
Review.
After brief periods in private law
practice in Boston and as a teacher at
Southern Methodist University Law
School in Dallas, Sher came to Palo
Alto and Stanford in 1957. Five years
later he achieved the rank of full
professor.
Oregon Expressway
He first entered Palo Alto politics
in the unsuccessful 1962 fight against
the Oregon Expressway, which crossed
his neighborhood. In 1965,
Councilman (now Mayor) Kirke
Comstock prevailed upon Sher to seek
a Council seat as a representative of "a
new philosophy — one that questioned

growth. We were in a transition away
from a period of growth without
question," Sher said.
Sher was elected, and made
preservation of the foothills and
bay lands his first priority. The Council
was deeply divided between 1965 and
1967, with seven Councilmen forming
a pro-development faction, and six,
including Sher, making up a
"residentialist" group.
He and three "residentialist"
colleagues fell victim to a recall in
1 9 67, spearheaded by
pro-development forces who described
the residentialists as "anti-business."
Moved Far
He opined this week that "We've
moved far from the pro-development
philosophy. Everybody worries about
the impact of development now." But,
he conceded, "there is more
willingness to accept the costs of
development among some than among
others."
Sher will almost certainly be among
the Councilmen who are less willing to
allow the externalities of development
to intrude into Palo Alto.
Ellen Wyman, who with her
husband Tom managed Sher's recent
campaign, attributed his victory to the
fact that he is "a very responsible,
reasonable, quality person. His
philosophy isn't extreme on either
side."

COMEBACK — Byron D. Sher, professor of law, was elected to the Palo Alto
City Council last Tuesday. He served as a councilman from 1965 to 1967. Sher's
academic specialty is commercial law and consumer protection; his top political
priority is preservation of opon space in the foothills and bay lands.
Venceremos candidate Jeffrey
Youdelman, who ran last in the
Council election, was probably
referring to the same thing when he
called Sher "two-faced."
Youdelman accused Sher of shifting
to the right and taking positions
similar to the Palo Alto '73 candidates,
successors of the pro-development
groups which promoted his recall.
Sher's critics on the left claim he
shifted to the right this year; Ellen
Wyman insists that "the community
has finally caught up to the views he
held in 1965 and 1967."
The bearded professor who has
been in the center of controversy on
both sides of El Camino Real will on
July 1 begin another term on the Palo
Alto City Council, expressing the hope
that he can help improve town-gown
relations.
"We share a common environment.
I hope to be able to do something to
get both communities working
together to solve our common
problems. I love both communities,
and I don't see why we can't work
together," he noted on election night.
That's a difficult assignment. But it
won't be the first one — on either side
of the arboretum — that Byron Sher
has taken on.
