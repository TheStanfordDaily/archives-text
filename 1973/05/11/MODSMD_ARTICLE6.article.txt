## Phi Delts 
### 
Few campus occurrences in recent memory have stirred
up turmoil as disproportionate as those at that infamous
rush party at the Phi Delta Theta house. The alleged raffling
of a lady of ill repute to a bemused prep school student
from Dallas has prompted an investigation by the Alcoholic
Beverage Countrol Board, a small demonstration, and
widespread demands for suspension of the errant fraternity.
The University will act on the matter this week; and, as the
University usually acts in response to what pressure it
receives, we feel it our duty to inject some sanity into the
debate.
While we condemn the conduct of the Phi Delts as an
egregious breach of good taste, we are equally unhappy
about the prospect of University intervention into the affair.
It very quickly raises the specter of a whole range of
University intrusion in the private lives of students here —
not only in the area of what entertainment students choose
to enjoy, but also of what stimulants or depressants they
may decide to use, of with whom they may wish to
cohabitate, and of how they wish to conduct their lives in
general.
It was not so long ago that the University did apply
stringent policies on drugs, liquor, living arrangements, and
even dress. Five years ago there were no coeducational
residences on this campus; ten years ago students' attire was
closely regulated by a set of guidelines as to what were
"Quad clothes" and what were not. A whole generation of
students fought for and won the right to privacy and
freedom from the policies of in loco parentis. We would be
very much amiss if we turned our backs on their efforts and
urged a return, for whatever reason, to institutional
regulation of what is undeniably individual conduct.
None of this need condone the particular action of the
Phi Delts. Their conduct was certainly ungentlemanly;
assuredly outrageous; and, indeed, most probably evidence
of sexist attitudes. But they were entirely within their rights
to entertain themselves as boorishly as they wished that
Saturday night. It is apparent that the lady in question was
in no way coerced into performing whatever heinous acts
she did, in fact, perform. She appears to have initiated the
whole affair. No one has advanced any evidence whatsoever
that the 'crimes' of the Phi Delts were anything but
victimless. As such, the only rubric under which sanctions
can be applied is one of 'general outrageousness' or
'tastelessness'—a rubric we categorically reject as a
justification for University intervention, and one under
which the analogies of drugs and cohabitation ring
distressingly clear.
While we look with disfavor on the Phi Delts'
tastelessness, with interest on their moral turpitude, we are
appalled at the talk of suspension. We strongly urge the
University to apply no substantive sanctions against Phi
Delta Theta.

It very quickly raises the specter of a whole range of
University intrusion in the private lives of students here —
not only in the area of what entertainment students choose
to enjoy, but also of what stimulants or depressants they
may decide to use, of with whom they may wish to
cohabitate, and of how they wish to conduct their lives in
general.
It was not so long ago that the University did apply
stringent policies on drugs, liquor, living arrangements, and
even dress. Five years ago there were no coeducational
residences on this campus; ten years ago students' attire was
closely regulated by a set of guidelines as to what were
"Quad clothes" and what were not. A whole generation of
students fought for and won the right to privacy and
freedom from the policies of in loco parentis. We would be
very much amiss if we turned our backs on their efforts and
urged a return, for whatever reason, to institutional
regulation of what is undeniably individual conduct.
None of this need condone the particular action of the
Phi Delts. Their conduct was certainly ungentlemanly;
assuredly outrageous; and, indeed, most probably evidence
of sexist attitudes. But they were entirely within their rights
to entertain themselves as boorishly as they wished that
Saturday night. It is apparent that the lady in question was
in no way coerced into performing whatever heinous acts
she did, in fact, perform. She appears to have initiated the
whole affair. No one has advanced any evidence whatsoever
that the 'crimes' of the Phi Delts were anything but
victimless. As such, the only rubric under which sanctions
can be applied is one of 'general outrageousness' or
'tastelessness'—a rubric we categorically reject as a
justification for University intervention, and one under
which the analogies of drugs and cohabitation ring
distressingly clear.
While we look with disfavor on the Phi Delts'
tastelessness, with interest on their moral turpitude, we are
appalled at the talk of suspension. We strongly urge the
University to apply no substantive sanctions against Phi
Delta Theta.
Few campus occurrences in recent memory have stirred
up turmoil as disproportionate as those at that infamous
rush party at the Phi Delta Theta house. The alleged raffling
of a lady of ill repute to a bemused prep school student
from Dallas has prompted an investigation by the Alcoholic
Beverage Countrol Board, a small demonstration, and
widespread demands for suspension of the errant fraternity.
The University will act on the matter this week; and, as the
University usually acts in response to what pressure it
receives, we feel it our duty to inject some sanity into the
debate.
While we condemn the conduct of the Phi Delts as an
egregious breach of good taste, we are equally unhappy
about the prospect of University intervention into the affair.
