# The 						Perspective Of Recent Events
## We Are All Prisoners Of War 
### 
Terry Adam«

Now that we have a cease fire, our prisoners home, and we think
we are entering an era of peace, recent events are giving us a chance to
regain perspective; to see that our willingness to make war is not
substantially changed, that indeed we are bombing approximately the
same people for exactly the same reasons as before. We can see we are
still POWs in an ideological war, and prisoners of a peace that is a
mockery. The machinery of our imprisonment surfaces in some
obvious ways, and some ugly ways, Watergate being a specimen of the
latter, and a culmination.
For years it has been a sociological axion that Eastern societies
operate on different priorities from us, and are involved in different
patterns or at least different phases of political and economic growth.
This is a simple truism that seems never to have informed American
foreign policy. We must note in this connection that Henry Kissinger's
formative study was not of the East, but the Austrian Prince,
Metternich, who is one of the arch-reactionaries of Western
Civilization, having preserved the European monarchic alliance against

the ramifications of the French Revolution.
Now we can see the budding of this retardation in the Pentagon
Papers narration of Truman and Eisenhower's refusals to act on the
reports of the Defense intelligence community's perception of the
peculiar political make-up of the East, and their discrediting of the
domino theory inoperative for military intervention.
Animosity
Unfortunately, the communist world too has been retarded. The
animosity that developed in those moments when America and Russia
faced each other across a defeated Germany has prevailed, and
continues to generate bigotry and fear.
Since Plato we have more or less agreed that governments should
be the vehicle of high aspirations or at least a reflection of truth. But
our governments have always tended to slow down, becoming
reactionary and self-serving. Altruism and power become limited bv
the lust for self-preservation. In the microcosm, this is why many
American lawyers oppose eased divorce laws and no fault insurance.
Elements of a system will not eliminate themselves to make the system
better.
Now that we have declared this thing a peace, we are thrown back
against the simple facts we have always known: we have not been
fighting for a democratic ideal; we have been fighting for a flimsy
dictatorship in a land both economically and intellectually incapable
of democracy as we know it. We have injected the specter of
reactionary violence into the history of a set of emerging nations,
insuring that indigenous forces that could have created some form of
self-determination are forever muddled. If this peace brings a
bloodbath, it will not be as a result of our withdrawal, but because of
our interference.
We all remain prisoners of this war to the extent we think that
peace, framed as it was in violence, can be at all real; to the extent we
still believe violence can breed anything but more violence; and to the
extent we continue to allow authoritarian and self-serving priorities to
hold sway in national life. It is fitting we not grant amnesty to the
draft dodgers — because all the prisoners are not yet free.
Finally, it is important to look at Vietnam with the perspective
Watergate gives us. Watergate was a battle in an ideological war
between the conservative and liberal forces within America; Vietnam
was an idealogical battle, a battle in an ideological war between
conservative and revolutionary forces in the world community. Since
the Nixon Administration was an embattled party on both fronts, is
there any reason to believe the tactics were any more honorable on one
front than the other? Or is there any hope now that either war was
waged in the interest of truth, or on the wishes of an informed
populace, or with any idealogical integrity?

conservative and revolutionary forces in the world community. Since
the Nixon Administration was an embattled party on both fronts, is
there any reason to believe the tactics were any more honorable on one
front than the other? Or is there any hope now that either war was
waged in the interest of truth, or on the wishes of an informed
populace, or with any idealogical integrity?

Now that we have a cease fire, our prisoners home, and we think
we are entering an era of peace, recent events are giving us a chance to
regain perspective; to see that our willingness to make war is not
substantially changed, that indeed we are bombing approximately the
same people for exactly the same reasons as before. We can see we are
still POWs in an ideological war, and prisoners of a peace that is a
mockery. The machinery of our imprisonment surfaces in some
obvious ways, and some ugly ways, Watergate being a specimen of the
latter, and a culmination.
For years it has been a sociological axion that Eastern societies
operate on different priorities from us, and are involved in different
patterns or at least different phases of political and economic growth.
This is a simple truism that seems never to have informed American
foreign policy. We must note in this connection that Henry Kissinger's
formative study was not of the East, but the Austrian Prince,
Metternich, who is one of the arch-reactionaries of Western
Civilization, having preserved the European monarchic alliance against

the ramifications of the French Revolution.
Now we can see the budding of this retardation in the Pentagon
Papers narration of Truman and Eisenhower's refusals to act on the
reports of the Defense intelligence community's perception of the
peculiar political make-up of the East, and their discrediting of the
domino theory inoperative for military intervention.
Animosity
Unfortunately, the communist world too has been retarded. The
animosity that developed in those moments when America and Russia
faced each other across a defeated Germany has prevailed, and
continues to generate bigotry and fear.
Since Plato we have more or less agreed that governments should
be the vehicle of high aspirations or at least a reflection of truth. But
our governments have always tended to slow down, becoming
reactionary and self-serving. Altruism and power become limited bv
the lust for self-preservation. In the microcosm, this is why many
American lawyers oppose eased divorce laws and no fault insurance.
Elements of a system will not eliminate themselves to make the system
better.
Now that we have declared this thing a peace, we are thrown back
against the simple facts we have always known: we have not been
fighting for a democratic ideal; we have been fighting for a flimsy
dictatorship in a land both economically and intellectually incapable
of democracy as we know it. We have injected the specter of
reactionary violence into the history of a set of emerging nations,
insuring that indigenous forces that could have created some form of
self-determination are forever muddled. If this peace brings a
bloodbath, it will not be as a result of our withdrawal, but because of
our interference.
We all remain prisoners of this war to the extent we think that
peace, framed as it was in violence, can be at all real; to the extent we
still believe violence can breed anything but more violence; and to the
extent we continue to allow authoritarian and self-serving priorities to
hold sway in national life. It is fitting we not grant amnesty to the
draft dodgers — because all the prisoners are not yet free.
Finally, it is important to look at Vietnam with the perspective
Watergate gives us. Watergate was a battle in an ideological war
between the conservative and liberal forces within America; Vietnam
was an idealogical battle, a battle in an ideological war between
conservative and revolutionary forces in the world community. Since
the Nixon Administration was an embattled party on both fronts, is
there any reason to believe the tactics were any more honorable on one
front than the other? Or is there any hope now that either war was
waged in the interest of truth, or on the wishes of an informed
populace, or with any idealogical integrity?
