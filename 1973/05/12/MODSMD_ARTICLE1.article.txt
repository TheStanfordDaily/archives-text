# PA Conservatives Rally Despite Liberal Majority
## 
### ROBERT BACON News Analysis 
The liberal Association for a Balanced Community
(ABC) maintained its one-vote majority on the Palo Alto
City Council in Tuesday's election, but conservatives also
had reason to be pleased by the results.
Although the ABC still has a majority, their candidates
won only two of the six seats contested in Tuesday's
election. Three incumbents from the more
business-oriented Palo Alto '73 (PA73) slate were
returned to office, and PA73's Roy Clay won a
head to-head two-candidate race for a two-year unexpired
term
Two years ago, ABC won three of the four seats then
at stake, for a net gain of two. This year they only held
their own.
All three of the PA73 incumbents seeking re-election
won, while only one of ABC's two incumbent candidates
survived.

Sylvia Seman, a losing ABC candidate two years ago
who was appointed to the Council in December 1971 to
fill a vacancy, lost Tuesday in her attempt to hold onto
her seat.
The Council will divide on major issues in much the
same way it has for the past year and a half — with ABC
able to command a 5-4 majority on a sizable share of the
key questions.
Former Councilman Byron Sher, returned to office
under the ABC banner, is known as a strong
environmentalist; it remains to be seen whether he will be
as enthusiastic a supporter as Seman of social programs
such as low-income housing and drug abuse control.
Moderate Conservative
Clay, who becomes the only black councilman, will
find the space of conservative William H. Clark, who did
not seek re-election. Clay, like Clark, will probably be one
of the more moderate of the conservatives, and might
occasionally swing in favor of ABC-promoted social

ventures.
The city is Still very evenly divided between the two
campus, a division reflected in referenda as well as in
Council elections. It is difficult to find a trend in the 1970
defeat of the downtown hospital development, the 1971
defeat of the "Superblock" office, and the voters'
approval of the Holiday Inn hotel last year.
The candidates spent a sizable share of their time
during the campaign insisting that the old
residentialist/establishment split — between those who
favored more commercial and industrial development and
those that opposed it — no longer existed.
They devoted even more attention, however, to calling
their opponents either anti-business or pro-development.
Labels
Labels often confuse more than they clarify, but they
are convenient, and, the protests of some of the
candidates notwithstanding, the old labels seemed to have
had some validity in this campaign.

The vote represented a victory' for coalition politics
and for incumbency. ABC and PA73 each provided their
candiates with funds, a precinct organization, and
large-scale newspaper advertising. Hence it was no surprise
that the first ten places in the at-large race were all taken
by ABC and PA73 endorsees.
Coalitions obviously don't mean everything, however.
Nobody expected one slate to sweep all six seats, and
neither slate did. The coalitions were not homogenous on
issues, and each candidate emphasized his individual
qualifications.
The five winners for full terms in the at-large race
included four incumbents seeking re-election and a former
councilman trying a comeback. Seman, the other
incumbent on the ballot, was an appointee who had never
won an election. The veteran Council members took
advantage of their name recognition and campaign
experience, and also had the benefit of Palo Alto Times
endorsements.
