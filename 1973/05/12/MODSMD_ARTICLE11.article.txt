# Conference Continues Tonight
## Political Prisoners Punished 
### 
Thursday, May 5, was the first
of a two-part conference on
"Political Prisoners — At Home
and Abroad." Speakers addressed
the particular situations in the
Philippines, South East Asia and
the United States.
Father Bruno Hicks, who was
expelled from the Philippines for
violating marshall law BEFORE it
was declared (the law was
retroactive), spoke about the
situation in that country.
Since President Marcos
declared marshall law in October,
8,000 people have been arrested.
A sign on the jail Fr. Hicks was
taken to said: "Anyone who
comes in the interests of a
suspected subversive is a suspected
subversive."
Insist On Marshall Law
Marcos has insisted that
marshall law was a necessary
deterrant to a military take-over;
Hicks says that there was no such
danger but that the Filipino

people were beginning to demand
some political power and to
express rising nationalistic and
anti-U.S. sentiments.
Hicks said Marcos was forced
to adopt marshall law because he
was in a situation where . . the
truth is out. And when the truth
is out, people get angry and begin
organizing for change or reform or
revolution." So Marcos had to
stop the truth, and since he had
lost the power of persuasion with
the Filipino people, he had to use
the gun. "And the gun is an
American gun."
Who benefits from this
situation? U.S. businessmen. 800
U.S. corporations now operate in
the Philippines. Recently the
Filipino Supreme Court ruled that
in 1974, when present treaties run
out, they will not be renewed.
U.S. businessmen would no longer
have a free reign in the islands. By
declaring marshall law, Marcos
assured U.S. corporations that

they would not lose their
property. Realizing this, the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce in the
Philippines promptly declared its
support for his actions.
'Potential Vietnam'
Hicks, who sees the Philippines
as a "potential Vietnam," said
that Marcos couldn't "carry this
out for three weeks without
American munitions." The
policeman who arrested him (as
well as the policemen in Vietnam,
Cambodia, Thailand, etc.) was
trained by U.S. advisors.
It is easy for those of us in
America to look at the Philippines
and say, "Isn't that terrible? No
freedom of speech, and then
forget about it. But the situation
is not only critical in the
Philippines and South Vietnam, it
is critical here. Dr. Halsted
Holman, who moderated the
conference and whose daughter is
currently a political prisoner in
connection with the Chino Escape

Gini Faller

Case, feels that everyone in the
United States is, to some extent, a
political prisoner. Nearly anyone
who has signed a petition or
marched in an anti-war march has
a file with the FBI. And as we
speak out against a system whose
god is gold and that denies basic
human rights, we become targets
of "law enforcement" agencies.
Anyone who works against the
drug traffic in the cities (Los Tres
del Barrio) or against racism (Gary
Lawton) or works in the prison
movement (The "Chino
Defendants") may be the target of
the next political trial. Here, as in
the Philippines, "law
enforcement" is directed against
those who threaten big business'
control over the country. And at
Stanford, we have a situation
where those who protest war or
genocide lose their jobs or are
suspended from school or go to
jail. Yet Shockley promotes
genocide and enjoys academic
tenure and fraternity boys sell a
human being, thus degrading all
women, in relative peace; the
University is concered only
because it has been embarrassed.
Selective Harassment
This system of selective
harassment and prosecution,
coupled with a society whose
make-up predetermines that the
inmates of a prison are largely
Third World and poor, means that
the prisons are filling up with a
"new breed" of convict. Caesar
Moore, a former jailhouse lawyer
and member of Venceremos, said,
at the conference, that when he
first went to jail, the attitude
among prisoners was "that they
deserved to be beaten and
humiliated .... But today people
are different." Prisoners today are
aware of the structure of the
society which sent them there and
the need to change that structure.
With more political prisoners
and prisoners who are political,
the "corrections" system has seen
the need for instituting more
measures of control within the
prisons. Moore described one
attempt at this — the
"Psychosurgery Program," by
which modern day lobotomies
will be tested on "potentially
violent" prison inmates.
But in the U.S., "potentially
violent" means anyone who
doesn't go along with the status
quo. According to Moore, of 84
people in a similar program at
Vacaville, only 6 had violent
histories. The others were people
who had attended Marxist study
groups or who had otherwise
refused to conform.
Affects All
From the Philippines to
California, the situation of
political prisoners affects us all.
The least we can do is learn about
it. .. and then perhaps we can do
something about it.
Come to the Political Prisoners
Conference tonight at 7:30 p.m.
in Bishop Auditorium, School of
Business. Among others, Charles
Garry (attorney for "Los Siete de
la Raza," the Black Panthers and
the "Chino Defendants") will
speak.

at the conference, that when he
first went to jail, the attitude
among prisoners was "that they
deserved to be beaten and
humiliated .... But today people
are different." Prisoners today are
aware of the structure of the
society which sent them there and
the need to change that structure.
With more political prisoners
and prisoners who are political,
the "corrections" system has seen
the need for instituting more
measures of control within the
prisons. Moore described one
attempt at this — the
"Psychosurgery Program," by
which modern day lobotomies
will be tested on "potentially
violent" prison inmates.
But in the U.S., "potentially
violent" means anyone who
doesn't go along with the status
quo. According to Moore, of 84
people in a similar program at
Vacaville, only 6 had violent
histories. The others were people
who had attended Marxist study
groups or who had otherwise
refused to conform.
Affects All
From the Philippines to
California, the situation of
political prisoners affects us all.
The least we can do is learn about
it. .. and then perhaps we can do
something about it.
Come to the Political Prisoners
Conference tonight at 7:30 p.m.
in Bishop Auditorium, School of
Business. Among others, Charles
Garry (attorney for "Los Siete de
la Raza," the Black Panthers and
the "Chino Defendants") will
speak.
(Gini Faller is a member of
Stanford Venceremos.)
Thursday, May 5, was the first
of a two-part conference on
"Political Prisoners — At Home
and Abroad." Speakers addressed
the particular situations in the
Philippines, South East Asia and
the United States.
Father Bruno Hicks, who was
expelled from the Philippines for
violating marshall law BEFORE it
was declared (the law was
retroactive), spoke about the
situation in that country.
Since President Marcos
declared marshall law in October,
8,000 people have been arrested.
A sign on the jail Fr. Hicks was
taken to said: "Anyone who
comes in the interests of a
suspected subversive is a suspected
subversive."
Insist On Marshall Law
Marcos has insisted that
marshall law was a necessary
deterrant to a military take-over;
Hicks says that there was no such
danger but that the Filipino

people were beginning to demand
some political power and to
express rising nationalistic and
anti-U.S. sentiments.
Hicks said Marcos was forced
to adopt marshall law because he
was in a situation where . . the
truth is out. And when the truth
is out, people get angry and begin
organizing for change or reform or
revolution." So Marcos had to
stop the truth, and since he had
lost the power of persuasion with
the Filipino people, he had to use
the gun. "And the gun is an
American gun."
Who benefits from this
situation? U.S. businessmen. 800
U.S. corporations now operate in
the Philippines. Recently the
Filipino Supreme Court ruled that
in 1974, when present treaties run
out, they will not be renewed.
U.S. businessmen would no longer
have a free reign in the islands. By
declaring marshall law, Marcos
assured U.S. corporations that

they would not lose their
property. Realizing this, the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce in the
Philippines promptly declared its
support for his actions.
'Potential Vietnam'
Hicks, who sees the Philippines
as a "potential Vietnam," said
that Marcos couldn't "carry this
out for three weeks without
American munitions." The
policeman who arrested him (as
well as the policemen in Vietnam,
Cambodia, Thailand, etc.) was
trained by U.S. advisors.
It is easy for those of us in
America to look at the Philippines
and say, "Isn't that terrible? No
freedom of speech, and then
forget about it. But the situation
is not only critical in the
Philippines and South Vietnam, it
is critical here. Dr. Halsted
Holman, who moderated the
conference and whose daughter is
currently a political prisoner in
connection with the Chino Escape

Gini Faller

Case, feels that everyone in the
United States is, to some extent, a
political prisoner. Nearly anyone
who has signed a petition or
marched in an anti-war march has
a file with the FBI. And as we
speak out against a system whose
god is gold and that denies basic
human rights, we become targets
of "law enforcement" agencies.
Anyone who works against the
drug traffic in the cities (Los Tres
del Barrio) or against racism (Gary
Lawton) or works in the prison
movement (The "Chino
Defendants") may be the target of
the next political trial. Here, as in
the Philippines, "law
enforcement" is directed against
those who threaten big business'
control over the country. And at
Stanford, we have a situation
where those who protest war or
genocide lose their jobs or are
suspended from school or go to
jail. Yet Shockley promotes
genocide and enjoys academic
tenure and fraternity boys sell a
human being, thus degrading all
women, in relative peace; the
University is concered only
because it has been embarrassed.
Selective Harassment
This system of selective
harassment and prosecution,
coupled with a society whose
make-up predetermines that the
inmates of a prison are largely
Third World and poor, means that
the prisons are filling up with a
"new breed" of convict. Caesar
Moore, a former jailhouse lawyer
and member of Venceremos, said,
at the conference, that when he
first went to jail, the attitude
among prisoners was "that they
deserved to be beaten and
humiliated .... But today people

conference and whose daughter is
currently a political prisoner in
connection with the Chino Escape

Gini Faller

Case, feels that everyone in the
United States is, to some extent, a
political prisoner. Nearly anyone
who has signed a petition or
marched in an anti-war march has
a file with the FBI. And as we
speak out against a system whose
god is gold and that denies basic
human rights, we become targets
of "law enforcement" agencies.
Anyone who works against the
drug traffic in the cities (Los Tres
del Barrio) or against racism (Gary
Lawton) or works in the prison
movement (The "Chino
Defendants") may be the target of
the next political trial. Here, as in
the Philippines, "law
enforcement" is directed against
those who threaten big business'
control over the country. And at
Stanford, we have a situation
where those who protest war or
genocide lose their jobs or are
suspended from school or go to
jail. Yet Shockley promotes
genocide and enjoys academic
tenure and fraternity boys sell a
human being, thus degrading all
women, in relative peace; the
University is concered only
because it has been embarrassed.
Selective Harassment
This system of selective
harassment and prosecution,
coupled with a society whose
make-up predetermines that the
inmates of a prison are largely
Third World and poor, means that
the prisons are filling up with a
"new breed" of convict. Caesar
Moore, a former jailhouse lawyer
and member of Venceremos, said,
at the conference, that when he
first went to jail, the attitude
among prisoners was "that they
deserved to be beaten and
humiliated .... But today people
are different." Prisoners today are
aware of the structure of the
society which sent them there and
the need to change that structure.
With more political prisoners
and prisoners who are political,
the "corrections" system has seen
the need for instituting more
measures of control within the
prisons. Moore described one
attempt at this — the
"Psychosurgery Program," by
which modern day lobotomies
will be tested on "potentially
violent" prison inmates.
But in the U.S., "potentially
violent" means anyone who
doesn't go along with the status
quo. According to Moore, of 84
people in a similar program at
Vacaville, only 6 had violent
histories. The others were people
who had attended Marxist study
groups or who had otherwise
refused to conform.
Affects All
From the Philippines to
California, the situation of
political prisoners affects us all.
The least we can do is learn about
it. .. and then perhaps we can do
something about it.
Come to the Political Prisoners
Conference tonight at 7:30 p.m.
in Bishop Auditorium, School of
Business. Among others, Charles
Garry (attorney for "Los Siete de
la Raza," the Black Panthers and
the "Chino Defendants") will
speak.

Stanford Venceremos.)
Thursday, May 5, was the first
of a two-part conference on
"Political Prisoners — At Home
and Abroad." Speakers addressed
the particular situations in the
Philippines, South East Asia and
the United States.
Father Bruno Hicks, who was
expelled from the Philippines for
violating marshall law BEFORE it
was declared (the law was
retroactive), spoke about the
situation in that country.
Since President Marcos
declared marshall law in October,
8,000 people have been arrested.
A sign on the jail Fr. Hicks was
taken to said: "Anyone who
comes in the interests of a
suspected subversive is a suspected
subversive."
Insist On Marshall Law
Marcos has insisted that
marshall law was a necessary
deterrant to a military take-over;
Hicks says that there was no such
danger but that the Filipino

people were beginning to demand
some political power and to
express rising nationalistic and
anti-U.S. sentiments.
Hicks said Marcos was forced
to adopt marshall law because he
was in a situation where . . the
truth is out. And when the truth
is out, people get angry and begin
organizing for change or reform or
revolution." So Marcos had to
stop the truth, and since he had
lost the power of persuasion with
the Filipino people, he had to use
the gun. "And the gun is an
American gun."
Who benefits from this
situation? U.S. businessmen. 800
U.S. corporations now operate in
the Philippines. Recently the
Filipino Supreme Court ruled that
in 1974, when present treaties run
out, they will not be renewed.
U.S. businessmen would no longer
have a free reign in the islands. By
declaring marshall law, Marcos
assured U.S. corporations that

they would not lose their
property. Realizing this, the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce in the
Philippines promptly declared its
support for his actions.
'Potential Vietnam'
Hicks, who sees the Philippines
as a "potential Vietnam," said
that Marcos couldn't "carry this
out for three weeks without
American munitions." The
policeman who arrested him (as
well as the policemen in Vietnam,
Cambodia, Thailand, etc.) was
trained by U.S. advisors.
It is easy for those of us in
America to look at the Philippines
and say, "Isn't that terrible? No
freedom of speech, and then
forget about it. But the situation
is not only critical in the
Philippines and South Vietnam, it
is critical here. Dr. Halsted
