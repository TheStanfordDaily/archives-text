Historically, the fundamental policy choice in
American foreign relations has been between
military intervention (often called imperialism by its
opponents) and non-intervention (often called
isolationism by its opponents).
But intertwined with this basic policy question
of keeping American troops and planes and ships on
guard around the world or leaving them at home, is
a question of method in analyzing foreign relations.
How should one view the persons who decide
foreign policy and the forces at work there?
On this question, the choice for
twentieth-century American elite decision-makers
has been between pragmatic realism and Wilsonian
moralistic universalism. Henry Kissinger, the most
important court intellectual in the Nixon regime,
adheres to a position of interventionist realism.
Wilsonians
Kissinger departs from the Wilsonian
liberal-internationalist mode of analysis, although he
definitely shares some practical goals with the
Wilsonians. His approach differs from that of the
famous Wilsonians Herbert Hoover, Cordell Hull,
Franklin D. Roosevelt, and John Foster Dulles.
Historian Gordon Levin has lucidly described
the Wilsonian legacy: "For Wilson, as for many of
his successors in the ranks of American
decision-makers, the national interest became
merged with liberal ideology. ... The policy of
building a rational international-capitalist order
served for the Wilson Administration, at one and the
same time, the varied but related tasks of countering
Germany's atavistic imperialism, for answering
Lenin's demands for world revolution, and, finally,
of maximizing the moral and economic expansion
of the liberal American nation-state."
But Kissinger rejects the Wilsonian approach. As
Barnard Law Collier wrote in the New York Times
Magazine, "Henry has pointed out time and again
that the world of the nineteen-seventies is no place
for the rhetoric of a John Kennedy, who pledged in
his inaugural that the United States would fight any
time, anywhere, any enemy to defend liberty." (By
"liberty," Kennedy meant an expanding corporate
liberal world order.)
Realism
What precisely are these non-Wilsonian views of
Kissinger's governing ideas are those of a
pragmatic realism heavily influenced by German
intellectual thought.
According to philosophy professor Tibor
Machan, "Kissinger is a man who sees the function
of the international politician as a valiant pragmatist,
an actor with a paradoxical sense of the prevailing
skepticism: action is necessary, 'right' is
unascertainable in the planning stages (right is
hindsight and historical), and the overriding purpose
is restrained survival and the avoidance of
catastrophe."
The real importance of David Landau's book is
that it is an imperfect though helpful effort to
describe Kissinger's realist approach to foreign

policy, to trace the intellectual and psychological
roots of the approach, and finally to show how the
approach works in practice (in Indochina).
L«ndau tells of Kissinger's interest in and
intellectual debt to Kant, Hegel, and Spengler.
Landau tells of the development in the early Cold
War years by "men in the mold of [George] Kennan
and [Hans] Morgenthau" of the realist alternative
to Wilsonian policy. Finally, Landau tells of
Kissinger's admiration for and emulation of the
nineteenth-century balance-of-power diplomacy of
Prince Metternich and Viscount Castlereagh.
European Balance
Landau describes the old balance-of-power
system as follows: "The essence of the system was a
common recognition by each of its members that
the survival of the others must never be challenged.
'There might be peripheral disagreements, and
wars might be fought to resolve them, but there
must be universally accepted limitations on the
exercise of international power. With these
understandings, negotiation became an effective
tool."
Such a view does indeed underlie Kissinger's
approach as an examination of President Nixon's
May 3 State of the World message makes clear.
However, in claiming primacy for the influence
of Metternich's example, Landau does seem to go
beyond what the evidence will support.
Throne And Altar
Metternich's ideological devotion to
traditionalism as symbolized in Throne and Altar is
contrary to Kissinger's anti-ideological pragmatism,
as James Chace has pointed out.
Kissinger is amoral like Bismarck and defines
balance-of-power in essentially Bismarckian terms,
recognizing that any such equilibrium represents
forces in flux.
What Kissinger really seeks is an overarching
understanding, what he calls a "stable structure" of
the powers. But here he faces trouble which his
anti-utopian, anti-ideological approach is
ill-equipped to handle.
The status quo of the international system that
such stability is intended to protect may be an
unjust status quo, or widely viewed as such. In fact,
Kissinger's nonideological rhetoric of "stability"
and "world peace" is linked to policies designed to
sustain the status quo and hence American global
hegemony. It is here that Kissinger comes into
practical agreement with many of the Wilsonians.
Kissinger recognizes in his own writings that the
U.S. is a status quo power. He also recognizes that
changes in the status quo are quite possible.
Yet because Kissinger views all questions of
"right" and "justice" as arbitrary and willful — and
incapable of rational, objective resolution —
ideologies and doctrines of justice are subversive of
his international system and really cannot be
accommodated by it.
In the end, Kissinger must oppose all efforts to
revise, in the name of justice, the status quo.
