Good Intentions
Editor:
I was grossly mis-paraphrased
in the Daily's article on the
History department on May 8.
Not only was the statement
attributed to me incompre
hensible, it was also inaccurate.
The Women's Caucus is well aware
that efforts were made to
"consider hiring qualified
women." The issue is not the
History department's intentions,
as the article implied. Rather, the
W omen's Caucus is concerned
because inadequate search
procedures make it unlikely that
good intentions can be translated
into practice.

Edifice Complex
Editor:
I was tremendously impressed
by the picture in the Daily of the
new look of the Campus (May 2).
The picture on the front page of
the Daily of April 24, where it
says "Edifice Complex" struck me
more, however.
Since coming to Stanford
almost 5 years ago, I have been
wondering why there are always
millions for building and a
minimum of funds for upkeep of
buildings, classrooms and grounds.
The explanation given was that
the very wealthy are willing to
give vast sums when their name
will appear in large letters on
these new edifices.
How about inaugurating a
program of sponsored
maintenance, having plaques
available stating: "This
building/these grounds maintained
by the generous donation of
" the size of
such plaque commensurate with
the generosity of the donor?

Misplaced Sexism
Editor:
It seems that recently a
number of people have become
upset over a raffle at a Stanford
fraternity. Cries of sexism have
arisen which, to me, seem to be
misplaced.
A major argument of the
feminist movement is that women
should have control over their
own bodies (and I include a mind
as well). According to this any
woman who wishes to be a
physicist, a housewife, or a
prostitute should be able to do so
without restraints imposed upon
them.
For the above reason I see no
cause for the cry of "sexism" to
be sounded. The woman involved
knew what was going on and
agreed to it. The only thing that
can be said to those people who
object on "sexist" grounds is that
it is none of their business.
In Thursday's Daily one
woman was reported to have
asked — "If there were an Uncle
Tom black, and he offered to sell
himself into slavery, would that
be alright?" Again — it is no one
else's business except for the
person involved. If the woman
who asked the question does not
wish to be a slave that is her own
affair, however any attempt to
impose her sense of morality on
others is an invasion of their right
to self determination.

Editor:
Saturday night my daughter's
roommate at the University of
Oregon was killed in an
automobile accident. The life of a
lovely, bright young girl was lost
unnecessarily. Her friend, who
was driving, had been drinking. He
is in the hospital in intensive care
and if he lives will probably be
paralyzed.
The message is clear.
I recount this sad story with
the hope that the fine young
people with whom I come in
contact at Stanford will hear the
message.
I don't want the tragedy that
befell these two beautiful young
people to happen to you.

I was tremendously impressed
by the picture in the Daily of the
new look of the Campus (May 2).
The picture on the front page of
the Daily of April 24, where it
says "Edifice Complex" struck me
more, however.
Since coming to Stanford
almost 5 years ago, I have been
wondering why there are always
millions for building and a
minimum of funds for upkeep of
buildings, classrooms and grounds.
The explanation given was that
the very wealthy are willing to
give vast sums when their name
will appear in large letters on
these new edifices.
How about inaugurating a
program of sponsored
maintenance, having plaques
available stating: "This
building/these grounds maintained
by the generous donation of
" the size of
such plaque commensurate with
the generosity of the donor?

Misplaced Sexism
Editor:
It seems that recently a
number of people have become
upset over a raffle at a Stanford
fraternity. Cries of sexism have
arisen which, to me, seem to be
misplaced.
A major argument of the
feminist movement is that women
should have control over their
own bodies (and I include a mind
as well). According to this any
woman who wishes to be a
physicist, a housewife, or a
prostitute should be able to do so
without restraints imposed upon
them.
For the above reason I see no
cause for the cry of "sexism" to
be sounded. The woman involved
knew what was going on and
agreed to it. The only thing that
can be said to those people who
object on "sexist" grounds is that
it is none of their business.
In Thursday's Daily one
woman was reported to have
asked — "If there were an Uncle
Tom black, and he offered to sell
himself into slavery, would that
be alright?" Again — it is no one
else's business except for the
person involved. If the woman
who asked the question does not
wish to be a slave that is her own
affair, however any attempt to
impose her sense of morality on
others is an invasion of their right
to self determination.

Saturday night my daughter's
roommate at the University of
Oregon was killed in an
automobile accident. The life of a
lovely, bright young girl was lost
unnecessarily. Her friend, who
was driving, had been drinking. He
is in the hospital in intensive care
and if he lives will probably be
paralyzed.
The message is clear.
I recount this sad story with
the hope that the fine young
people with whom I come in
contact at Stanford will hear the
message.
I don't want the tragedy that
befell these two beautiful young
people to happen to you.

I was grossly mis-paraphrased
in the Daily's article on the
History department on May 8.
Not only was the statement
attributed to me incompre
hensible, it was also inaccurate.
The Women's Caucus is well aware
that efforts were made to
"consider hiring qualified
women." The issue is not the
History department's intentions,
as the article implied. Rather, the
W omen's Caucus is concerned
because inadequate search
procedures make it unlikely that
good intentions can be translated
into practice.
