Sooner or later, you will want to submit to the Daily; why not make
it sooner? Articles, letters, obscure song titles, and limericks should be
typed on a 62-space line and should include signature and an address
and phone number so we can send you your prize. Please place your
submission face up in the opinion editor's box by two p.m. two days
prior to publication. And don't forget, the Daily is on the lookout for
a new cartoonist, so you illiterate out there who can only draw, why
not stuff a few etchings in the box too. For more information call ex.
4632 or The Governor's Mansion, Sacramento.
