# 'Total Waste' Or Helpful
## LSAT Preparatory Courses Evaluated 
### BOB SIEGEL 
"The course proved to be a
total waste. I feel stupid for
taking it."
"The students usually say that
the course definitely helped
them. ..."
'"The result of all this
preparation is that our students
take the actual LSAT fully
prepared and knowingexactlywhat
to expect. The resulting
psychological advantage cannot be
underestimated."
The Law School Admission
Test (LSAT) is an exercise all
prospective law students must
endure. It is administered five
times each year by the
Educational Testing Service
(ETS), under contract to the Law
School Admission Council, Inc. —
an organization which represents
137 accredited law schools.
According to the Law School
Admission Bulletin, published by
ETS, "the LSAT is a half-day
objective test designed to measure
certain mental capacities
important in the study of
law. ..." Its purpose is "to assess
the probability that the applicant
willbe successful in the study of
law."
Preparation Recommendations
Assoc. Law School Dean
William Keogh recommended that
students prepare for the LSAT by
choosing "courses which impose
an intellectual demand and pursue
them vigorously in a discipline
which appeals to them."
In recent years the number of
law school applications has
dramatically increased an;pressure
to do well on the LSAT has grown
progressively worse.
Since the LSAT is designed to
measure aptitude, short-term
preparation islimitedto sharpening
exam-taking skills and becoming
familiar with the test's format.
Almost everyone who has taken
the test, however, agrees that
some preparation is helpful.
Three Courses
Within the past three years,
three LSAT preparation courses
have begun operating in the Bay
Area. They provide students with
timed, in-class practice tests
written by employees of the
respective organizations.
Instructors also discuss test
questions and explain the
rationale behind correct answers.
All courses claim to help the
student raise his LSAT score.
The Stanley H. Kaplan
Educational Center, located in
San Jose, provides preparation for
a variety of tests required for
admission to post-graduate
schools. The LSAT classes meet
weekly for six 3'/2-hour periods
prior to the test date. The course
costs $175, plus a refundable $25
deposit for homework materials.

According to center director
Mike Bluth, "Our classes aren't
larger than 15 students and allow
individual attention."
Average Enrollment
The average enrollment is
30-40 students and the majority
of students come from Stanford
and Berkeley, Bluth said.
Homework materials provide
exercises in each LSAT area, and
students spend about ten hours
per week completing the
assignments, the director said.
Course instructors are law
students or recent law school
graduates. Bluth explained, "We
hire instructors on the basis of
their exam [LSAT] scores. We
take students because they
haven't been away from tests for
too long."
Bar Exam Results
Instructor Ron Cote, a 1972
Stanford Law School graduate, is
currently awaiting the results of
his California Bar Examination.
He pointed out, "The course
won't do anything radical [such
as] give you a rich vocabulary,
reading skills, or memory . . . but
can help you in subtle ways." He
gave an example of how the
course trains a student to spot
discrepancies between what a
person did and what a solution
says he did.
The LSAT Review Course is
taught by practicing attorneys in
Berkeley and consists of five
four-hour sessions. The $75
course is taught to the entire
50-60 student enrollment.
The course brochure reads, in
part, "At each class the student
gets to know and understand the
LSAT while at home he works on
homework which is given at each
class and reviewed at the
following class." It continues,
".. .at each class he (the student)
is taught important techniques for
improving his score. ... He will
learn how to approach certain
questions without imposing his
own values."
Self-Discipline
The course also "teaches a
student why he makes an error
and how to avoid repeating
it... furthermore [it] eliminates
any problem of disciplining
oneself to allot a certain amount
of time to prepare for the exam,"
the brochure concludes.
Pat Flowers, supervisor of the
LSAT Review Course, observed,
"The three key elements
(necessary for doing well on the
test) seem to be (a) being familiar
with the test, (b) having good
reading skills, and (c) thinking
logically." She stated that
students who have gone through
the course generally raise their
test scores "between 70 and 100
points."

When asked why lawyers are
used as instructors, she replied
.. attorneys know law well
enough so they can gear students
in the right direction."
Constant Updating
Both the Kaplan and LSAT
Review Courses emphasize their
practice tests and materials are
constantly updated on the basis of
the most recent LSAT's. When
asked how such information is
obtained, Bluth replied, "I really
don't know. I get the materials
from New York and I know they
have a staff working on that all
the time .. . you might call it a
trade secret."
The third course, the Western
States LSAT Study and
Preparation Seminar, is directed
by Ilson W. New in San Francisco.
It is given in four sessions covering
two days (Friday and Saturday)
just prior to the LSAT and lasts a
total of 15 hours. Tuition is $85.
The class size is usually
between 40 and 50 people and
director reported "the draw from
well-known schools was light." <
Instructors
The seminar enploys
instructors with Ph.D.'s in
psychology and education and
are, according to the course
brochure, "prominently
recognized authorities on testing."
New pointed out "there is nothing
in law school or law practice that
teaches you how to instruct."
In evaluating the seminar's
value, he said "Having an intensive
review and analysis [of the
LSAT] a short time before the
test helps the student to gain a
better perspective and overview of
the entire test."
The Educational Testing
Service downgrades the value of
such preparatory courses. The
Law School Admission Bulletin
states "Since the LSAT measures
intellectual qualities that develop
gradually and types of knowledge
that one accumulates over
relatively long periods of time, no
specific preparation can be made
immediately before the test."
No Sanction
It then concludes "There is no
evidence that taking cram courses
or studying review books results
in significant score gains. Neither
the Law School Admission
Council nor ETS sponsors,
supports, or sanctions courses,
schools, or books purporting to
improve LSAT scores."
Tibby did mention that
"people out of academia [such as
in service] for a while might be
helped in brushing up on skills"
by the LSAT courses.
Guy Browning of Stanford's
Psychological Counciling and
Testing Service believes "Much
can be learned by teaching ways
of thinking about a given type of
test item. A person after coaching
on test items and knowing about
the scale ... is in a better position
to take the test than a person who
doesn't know."
Familiarity Helpful
He continued "A person who is
familiar with the psychonometric
structure of the test... is less apt
to panic," and explained "A big
part of test taking is how a person
addresses himself to the test."
Jim Friend, a senior who has
recently taken the Kaplan course,
believes the preparation's
usefulness was not derived from
"helping you to answer questions
any better, but making you less
nervous going into the test."
Most people who have taken

the LSAT or advise law school
candidates agree that some review
is helpful. Differences of opinion
seem to center on whether or not
a student can prepare on his own
(using review books and old
LSAT's) as well as he can taking
the courses.
'Discipline'
Friend suggested "if a student
has the discipline to work alone, I
think he could probably get as
much as he could by taking the
course."
Gene Morones, a second year
law student and a pre-law advisor
»aaj3e stating "You can gain the
same feeling [of being
psychologically prepared for the
test] by buying a preparation
book or by working on a sample
test in the Pre law Handbook
provided by LSAT."
He added, "I never recommend
they [students] take the course,
but I'm not presumptuous to tell
them not t0.... I don't know of
anyone who recommends the
course."
Cites Pressures
Moloney believes the
preparation courses in the Bay
Area began as competition among
students became more intense and
"pressures from parents and other
sources to get into the best law
school. These people [students]
are easy prey."
Dean Keogh said "The Law
School Admissions Council is
continuously looking at these
enterprises to protect—so far as is
possible—prospective law
students. We're most concerned
with blatant irresponsibility—such
as promises to increase scores."
He added, however, "we haven't
found much of that."
In summarizing his regard for
the sources, Keogh declared "I'm
not aware of anything which goes
on in these courses which would
distinguish them from the review
possible when a student goes
through the published tests on his
or her own."
'Books Too Easy'
Director Bluth responded to
this criticism by saying "The
practice books are too
easy . . . [whereas] Kaplan tests
are more difficult than the
LSAT."
A number of students who
have taken the courses disagree,
however. For example, when Erin
Moore, a senior who took the
Berkeley review course was asked
whether the course can do more
for a student than available review
books, she answered "I would say
no."
Mark Morgenthaler took the
Kaplan course prior to last
October's LSAT. He also believes
a student could prepare
effectively on his own—if he did it
diligently, but he said "For me it
was easier to pay the money. ... I
spent a lot less time than I would
have on my own."
Timed Tests
The courses do provide five or
six time-disciplined practice tests
which might help the student who
would not otherwise take such

tests on his own. Even law schools
believe experience under pressure
with the LSAT helpful in raising
scores since they generally do not
recognize an improvement in a
student's second LSAT results
unless they exceed his first score
by 50 points.
Students seem to agree that
preparation provided by the
courses is as good as any—if any
preparation for the LSAT is
worthwhile. The question is
whether or not the courses are
worth $75 to $175 tuition.
Mike Bluth reports that
Kaplan's feedback has been "very
favorable" while director New of
the Western States Seminar stated
"we've had less than 2 percent
negative (responses)."
On the other hand, of the
seven Stanford students
interviewed for this article—who
have taken either the Kaplan or
LSAT Review courses—six
believed the courses were not
worth the expense."

but I'm not presumptuous to tell
them not t0.... I don't know of
anyone who recommends the
course."
Cites Pressures
Moloney believes the
preparation courses in the Bay
Area began as competition among
students became more intense and
"pressures from parents and other
sources to get into the best law
school. These people [students]
are easy prey."
Dean Keogh said "The Law
School Admissions Council is
continuously looking at these
enterprises to protect—so far as is
possible—prospective law
students. We're most concerned
with blatant irresponsibility—such
as promises to increase scores."
He added, however, "we haven't
found much of that."
In summarizing his regard for
the sources, Keogh declared "I'm
not aware of anything which goes
on in these courses which would
distinguish them from the review
possible when a student goes
through the published tests on his
or her own."
'Books Too Easy'
Director Bluth responded to
this criticism by saying "The
practice books are too
easy . . . [whereas] Kaplan tests
are more difficult than the
LSAT."
A number of students who
have taken the courses disagree,
however. For example, when Erin
Moore, a senior who took the
Berkeley review course was asked
whether the course can do more
for a student than available review
books, she answered "I would say
no."
Mark Morgenthaler took the
Kaplan course prior to last
October's LSAT. He also believes
a student could prepare
effectively on his own—if he did it
diligently, but he said "For me it
was easier to pay the money. ... I
spent a lot less time than I would
have on my own."
Timed Tests
The courses do provide five or
six time-disciplined practice tests
which might help the student who
would not otherwise take such

tests on his own. Even law schools
believe experience under pressure
with the LSAT helpful in raising
scores since they generally do not
recognize an improvement in a
student's second LSAT results
unless they exceed his first score
by 50 points.
Students seem to agree that
preparation provided by the
courses is as good as any—if any
preparation for the LSAT is
worthwhile. The question is
whether or not the courses are
worth $75 to $175 tuition.
Mike Bluth reports that
Kaplan's feedback has been "very
favorable" while director New of
the Western States Seminar stated
"we've had less than 2 percent
negative (responses)."
On the other hand, of the
seven Stanford students
interviewed for this article—who
have taken either the Kaplan or
LSAT Review courses—six
believed the courses were not
worth the expense."

The Law School Admission
Test (LSAT) is an exercise all
prospective law students must
endure. It is administered five
times each year by the
Educational Testing Service
(ETS), under contract to the Law
School Admission Council, Inc. —
an organization which represents
137 accredited law schools.
According to the Law School
Admission Bulletin, published by
ETS, "the LSAT is a half-day
objective test designed to measure
certain mental capacities
important in the study of
law. ..." Its purpose is "to assess
the probability that the applicant
willbe successful in the study of
law."
Preparation Recommendations
Assoc. Law School Dean
William Keogh recommended that
students prepare for the LSAT by
choosing "courses which impose
an intellectual demand and pursue
them vigorously in a discipline
which appeals to them."
In recent years the number of
law school applications has
dramatically increased an;pressure
to do well on the LSAT has grown
progressively worse.
Since the LSAT is designed to
measure aptitude, short-term
preparation islimitedto sharpening
exam-taking skills and becoming
familiar with the test's format.
Almost everyone who has taken
the test, however, agrees that
some preparation is helpful.
Three Courses
Within the past three years,
three LSAT preparation courses
have begun operating in the Bay
Area. They provide students with
timed, in-class practice tests
written by employees of the
respective organizations.
Instructors also discuss test
questions and explain the
rationale behind correct answers.
All courses claim to help the
student raise his LSAT score.
The Stanley H. Kaplan
Educational Center, located in
San Jose, provides preparation for
a variety of tests required for
admission to post-graduate
schools. The LSAT classes meet
weekly for six 3'/2-hour periods
prior to the test date. The course
costs $175, plus a refundable $25
deposit for homework materials.

According to center director
Mike Bluth, "Our classes aren't
larger than 15 students and allow
individual attention."
Average Enrollment
The average enrollment is
30-40 students and the majority
of students come from Stanford
and Berkeley, Bluth said.
Homework materials provide
exercises in each LSAT area, and
students spend about ten hours
per week completing the
assignments, the director said.
Course instructors are law
students or recent law school
graduates. Bluth explained, "We
hire instructors on the basis of
their exam [LSAT] scores. We
take students because they
haven't been away from tests for
too long."
Bar Exam Results
Instructor Ron Cote, a 1972
Stanford Law School graduate, is
currently awaiting the results of
his California Bar Examination.
He pointed out, "The course
won't do anything radical [such
as] give you a rich vocabulary,
reading skills, or memory . . . but
can help you in subtle ways." He
gave an example of how the
course trains a student to spot
discrepancies between what a
person did and what a solution
says he did.
The LSAT Review Course is
taught by practicing attorneys in
Berkeley and consists of five
four-hour sessions. The $75
course is taught to the entire
50-60 student enrollment.
The course brochure reads, in
part, "At each class the student
gets to know and understand the
LSAT while at home he works on
homework which is given at each
class and reviewed at the
following class." It continues,
".. .at each class he (the student)
is taught important techniques for
improving his score. ... He will
learn how to approach certain
questions without imposing his
own values."
Self-Discipline
The course also "teaches a
student why he makes an error
and how to avoid repeating
it... furthermore [it] eliminates
any problem of disciplining
oneself to allot a certain amount
of time to prepare for the exam,"
the brochure concludes.
Pat Flowers, supervisor of the
LSAT Review Course, observed,
"The three key elements
(necessary for doing well on the
test) seem to be (a) being familiar
with the test, (b) having good
reading skills, and (c) thinking
logically." She stated that
students who have gone through
the course generally raise their
test scores "between 70 and 100
points."

When asked why lawyers are
used as instructors, she replied
.. attorneys know law well
enough so they can gear students
in the right direction."
Constant Updating
Both the Kaplan and LSAT
Review Courses emphasize their
practice tests and materials are
constantly updated on the basis of
the most recent LSAT's. When
asked how such information is
obtained, Bluth replied, "I really
don't know. I get the materials
from New York and I know they
have a staff working on that all
the time .. . you might call it a
trade secret."
The third course, the Western
States LSAT Study and
Preparation Seminar, is directed
by Ilson W. New in San Francisco.
It is given in four sessions covering
two days (Friday and Saturday)
just prior to the LSAT and lasts a
total of 15 hours. Tuition is $85.
The class size is usually
between 40 and 50 people and
director reported "the draw from
well-known schools was light." <
Instructors
The seminar enploys
instructors with Ph.D.'s in
psychology and education and
are, according to the course
brochure, "prominently
recognized authorities on testing."
New pointed out "there is nothing
in law school or law practice that
teaches you how to instruct."
In evaluating the seminar's
value, he said "Having an intensive
review and analysis [of the
LSAT] a short time before the
test helps the student to gain a
better perspective and overview of
the entire test."
The Educational Testing
Service downgrades the value of
such preparatory courses. The
Law School Admission Bulletin
states "Since the LSAT measures
intellectual qualities that develop
gradually and types of knowledge
that one accumulates over
relatively long periods of time, no
specific preparation can be made
immediately before the test."
No Sanction
It then concludes "There is no
evidence that taking cram courses
or studying review books results
in significant score gains. Neither
the Law School Admission
Council nor ETS sponsors,
supports, or sanctions courses,
schools, or books purporting to
improve LSAT scores."
Tibby did mention that
"people out of academia [such as
in service] for a while might be
helped in brushing up on skills"
by the LSAT courses.
Guy Browning of Stanford's
Psychological Counciling and
Testing Service believes "Much
can be learned by teaching ways
of thinking about a given type of
test item. A person after coaching
on test items and knowing about
the scale ... is in a better position
to take the test than a person who
doesn't know."
Familiarity Helpful
He continued "A person who is
familiar with the psychonometric
structure of the test... is less apt
to panic," and explained "A big
part of test taking is how a person
addresses himself to the test."
Jim Friend, a senior who has
recently taken the Kaplan course,
believes the preparation's
usefulness was not derived from
"helping you to answer questions
any better, but making you less
nervous going into the test."
Most people who have taken

the LSAT or advise law school
candidates agree that some review
is helpful. Differences of opinion
seem to center on whether or not
a student can prepare on his own
(using review books and old
LSAT's) as well as he can taking
the courses.
'Discipline'
Friend suggested "if a student
has the discipline to work alone, I
think he could probably get as
much as he could by taking the
course."
Gene Morones, a second year
law student and a pre-law advisor
»aaj3e stating "You can gain the
same feeling [of being
psychologically prepared for the
test] by buying a preparation
book or by working on a sample
test in the Pre law Handbook
provided by LSAT."
He added, "I never recommend
they [students] take the course,
but I'm not presumptuous to tell
them not t0.... I don't know of
anyone who recommends the
course."

Instructors
The seminar enploys
instructors with Ph.D.'s in
psychology and education and
are, according to the course
brochure, "prominently
recognized authorities on testing."
New pointed out "there is nothing
in law school or law practice that
teaches you how to instruct."
In evaluating the seminar's
value, he said "Having an intensive
review and analysis [of the
LSAT] a short time before the
test helps the student to gain a
better perspective and overview of
the entire test."
The Educational Testing
Service downgrades the value of
such preparatory courses. The
Law School Admission Bulletin
states "Since the LSAT measures
intellectual qualities that develop
gradually and types of knowledge
that one accumulates over
relatively long periods of time, no
specific preparation can be made
immediately before the test."
No Sanction
It then concludes "There is no
evidence that taking cram courses
or studying review books results
in significant score gains. Neither
the Law School Admission
Council nor ETS sponsors,
supports, or sanctions courses,
schools, or books purporting to
improve LSAT scores."
Tibby did mention that
"people out of academia [such as
in service] for a while might be
helped in brushing up on skills"
by the LSAT courses.
Guy Browning of Stanford's
Psychological Counciling and
Testing Service believes "Much
can be learned by teaching ways
of thinking about a given type of
test item. A person after coaching
on test items and knowing about
the scale ... is in a better position
to take the test than a person who
doesn't know."
Familiarity Helpful
He continued "A person who is
familiar with the psychonometric
structure of the test... is less apt
to panic," and explained "A big
part of test taking is how a person
addresses himself to the test."
Jim Friend, a senior who has
recently taken the Kaplan course,
believes the preparation's
usefulness was not derived from
"helping you to answer questions
any better, but making you less
nervous going into the test."
Most people who have taken

the LSAT or advise law school
candidates agree that some review
is helpful. Differences of opinion
seem to center on whether or not
a student can prepare on his own
(using review books and old
LSAT's) as well as he can taking
the courses.
'Discipline'
Friend suggested "if a student
has the discipline to work alone, I
think he could probably get as
much as he could by taking the
course."
Gene Morones, a second year
law student and a pre-law advisor
»aaj3e stating "You can gain the
same feeling [of being
psychologically prepared for the
test] by buying a preparation
book or by working on a sample
test in the Pre law Handbook
provided by LSAT."
He added, "I never recommend
they [students] take the course,
but I'm not presumptuous to tell
them not t0.... I don't know of
anyone who recommends the
course."
Cites Pressures
Moloney believes the
preparation courses in the Bay
Area began as competition among
students became more intense and
"pressures from parents and other
sources to get into the best law
school. These people [students]
are easy prey."
Dean Keogh said "The Law
School Admissions Council is
continuously looking at these
enterprises to protect—so far as is
possible—prospective law
students. We're most concerned
with blatant irresponsibility—such
as promises to increase scores."
He added, however, "we haven't
found much of that."
In summarizing his regard for
the sources, Keogh declared "I'm
not aware of anything which goes
on in these courses which would
distinguish them from the review
possible when a student goes
through the published tests on his
or her own."
'Books Too Easy'
Director Bluth responded to
this criticism by saying "The
practice books are too
easy . . . [whereas] Kaplan tests
are more difficult than the
LSAT."
A number of students who
have taken the courses disagree,
however. For example, when Erin
Moore, a senior who took the
Berkeley review course was asked
whether the course can do more
for a student than available review
books, she answered "I would say
no."
Mark Morgenthaler took the
Kaplan course prior to last
October's LSAT. He also believes
a student could prepare
effectively on his own—if he did it
diligently, but he said "For me it
was easier to pay the money. ... I
spent a lot less time than I would
have on my own."
Timed Tests
The courses do provide five or
six time-disciplined practice tests
which might help the student who
would not otherwise take such

tests on his own. Even law schools
believe experience under pressure
with the LSAT helpful in raising
scores since they generally do not
recognize an improvement in a
student's second LSAT results
unless they exceed his first score
by 50 points.
Students seem to agree that
preparation provided by the
courses is as good as any—if any
preparation for the LSAT is
worthwhile. The question is
whether or not the courses are
worth $75 to $175 tuition.
Mike Bluth reports that
Kaplan's feedback has been "very
favorable" while director New of
the Western States Seminar stated
"we've had less than 2 percent
negative (responses)."
On the other hand, of the
seven Stanford students
interviewed for this article—who
have taken either the Kaplan or
LSAT Review courses—six
believed the courses were not

The Law School Admission
Test (LSAT) is an exercise all
prospective law students must
endure. It is administered five
times each year by the
Educational Testing Service
(ETS), under contract to the Law
School Admission Council, Inc. —
an organization which represents
137 accredited law schools.
According to the Law School
Admission Bulletin, published by
ETS, "the LSAT is a half-day
objective test designed to measure
certain mental capacities
important in the study of
law. ..." Its purpose is "to assess
the probability that the applicant
willbe successful in the study of
law."
Preparation Recommendations
Assoc. Law School Dean
William Keogh recommended that
students prepare for the LSAT by
choosing "courses which impose
an intellectual demand and pursue
them vigorously in a discipline
which appeals to them."
In recent years the number of
law school applications has
dramatically increased an;pressure
to do well on the LSAT has grown
progressively worse.
Since the LSAT is designed to
measure aptitude, short-term
preparation islimitedto sharpening
exam-taking skills and becoming
familiar with the test's format.
Almost everyone who has taken
the test, however, agrees that
some preparation is helpful.
Three Courses
Within the past three years,
three LSAT preparation courses
have begun operating in the Bay
Area. They provide students with
timed, in-class practice tests
written by employees of the
respective organizations.
Instructors also discuss test
questions and explain the
rationale behind correct answers.
All courses claim to help the
student raise his LSAT score.
The Stanley H. Kaplan
Educational Center, located in
San Jose, provides preparation for
a variety of tests required for
admission to post-graduate
schools. The LSAT classes meet
weekly for six 3'/2-hour periods
prior to the test date. The course
costs $175, plus a refundable $25
deposit for homework materials.

According to center director
Mike Bluth, "Our classes aren't
larger than 15 students and allow
individual attention."
Average Enrollment
The average enrollment is
30-40 students and the majority
of students come from Stanford
and Berkeley, Bluth said.
Homework materials provide
exercises in each LSAT area, and
students spend about ten hours
per week completing the
assignments, the director said.
Course instructors are law
students or recent law school
graduates. Bluth explained, "We
hire instructors on the basis of
their exam [LSAT] scores. We
take students because they
haven't been away from tests for
too long."
Bar Exam Results
Instructor Ron Cote, a 1972
Stanford Law School graduate, is
currently awaiting the results of
his California Bar Examination.
He pointed out, "The course
won't do anything radical [such
as] give you a rich vocabulary,
reading skills, or memory . . . but
can help you in subtle ways." He
gave an example of how the
course trains a student to spot
discrepancies between what a
person did and what a solution
says he did.
The LSAT Review Course is
taught by practicing attorneys in
Berkeley and consists of five
four-hour sessions. The $75
course is taught to the entire
50-60 student enrollment.
The course brochure reads, in
part, "At each class the student
gets to know and understand the
LSAT while at home he works on
homework which is given at each
class and reviewed at the
following class." It continues,
".. .at each class he (the student)
is taught important techniques for
improving his score. ... He will
learn how to approach certain
questions without imposing his
own values."
Self-Discipline
The course also "teaches a
student why he makes an error
and how to avoid repeating
it... furthermore [it] eliminates
any problem of disciplining
oneself to allot a certain amount
of time to prepare for the exam,"
the brochure concludes.
Pat Flowers, supervisor of the
LSAT Review Course, observed,
"The three key elements
(necessary for doing well on the
test) seem to be (a) being familiar
with the test, (b) having good
reading skills, and (c) thinking
logically." She stated that
students who have gone through
the course generally raise their
test scores "between 70 and 100
points."

When asked why lawyers are
used as instructors, she replied
.. attorneys know law well
enough so they can gear students
in the right direction."
Constant Updating
Both the Kaplan and LSAT
Review Courses emphasize their
practice tests and materials are
constantly updated on the basis of
the most recent LSAT's. When
asked how such information is
obtained, Bluth replied, "I really
don't know. I get the materials
from New York and I know they
have a staff working on that all
the time .. . you might call it a
trade secret."
The third course, the Western
States LSAT Study and
Preparation Seminar, is directed
by Ilson W. New in San Francisco.
It is given in four sessions covering
two days (Friday and Saturday)
just prior to the LSAT and lasts a
total of 15 hours. Tuition is $85.
The class size is usually
between 40 and 50 people and
director reported "the draw from
well-known schools was light." <

students or recent law school
graduates. Bluth explained, "We
hire instructors on the basis of
their exam [LSAT] scores. We
take students because they
haven't been away from tests for
too long."
Bar Exam Results
Instructor Ron Cote, a 1972
Stanford Law School graduate, is
currently awaiting the results of
his California Bar Examination.
He pointed out, "The course
won't do anything radical [such
as] give you a rich vocabulary,
reading skills, or memory . . . but
can help you in subtle ways." He
gave an example of how the
course trains a student to spot
discrepancies between what a
person did and what a solution
says he did.
The LSAT Review Course is
taught by practicing attorneys in
Berkeley and consists of five
four-hour sessions. The $75
course is taught to the entire
50-60 student enrollment.
The course brochure reads, in
part, "At each class the student
gets to know and understand the
LSAT while at home he works on
homework which is given at each
class and reviewed at the
following class." It continues,
".. .at each class he (the student)
is taught important techniques for
improving his score. ... He will
learn how to approach certain
questions without imposing his
own values."
Self-Discipline
The course also "teaches a
student why he makes an error
and how to avoid repeating
it... furthermore [it] eliminates
any problem of disciplining
oneself to allot a certain amount
of time to prepare for the exam,"
the brochure concludes.
Pat Flowers, supervisor of the
LSAT Review Course, observed,
"The three key elements
(necessary for doing well on the
test) seem to be (a) being familiar
with the test, (b) having good
reading skills, and (c) thinking
logically." She stated that
students who have gone through
the course generally raise their
test scores "between 70 and 100
points."

When asked why lawyers are
used as instructors, she replied
.. attorneys know law well
enough so they can gear students
in the right direction."
Constant Updating
Both the Kaplan and LSAT
Review Courses emphasize their
practice tests and materials are
constantly updated on the basis of
the most recent LSAT's. When
asked how such information is
obtained, Bluth replied, "I really
don't know. I get the materials
from New York and I know they
have a staff working on that all
the time .. . you might call it a
trade secret."
The third course, the Western
States LSAT Study and
Preparation Seminar, is directed
by Ilson W. New in San Francisco.
It is given in four sessions covering
two days (Friday and Saturday)
just prior to the LSAT and lasts a
total of 15 hours. Tuition is $85.
The class size is usually
between 40 and 50 people and
director reported "the draw from
well-known schools was light." <
Instructors
The seminar enploys
instructors with Ph.D.'s in
psychology and education and
are, according to the course
brochure, "prominently
recognized authorities on testing."
New pointed out "there is nothing
in law school or law practice that
teaches you how to instruct."
In evaluating the seminar's
value, he said "Having an intensive
review and analysis [of the
LSAT] a short time before the
test helps the student to gain a
better perspective and overview of
the entire test."
The Educational Testing
Service downgrades the value of
such preparatory courses. The
Law School Admission Bulletin
states "Since the LSAT measures
intellectual qualities that develop
gradually and types of knowledge
that one accumulates over
relatively long periods of time, no
specific preparation can be made
immediately before the test."
No Sanction
It then concludes "There is no
evidence that taking cram courses
or studying review books results
in significant score gains. Neither
the Law School Admission
Council nor ETS sponsors,
supports, or sanctions courses,
schools, or books purporting to
improve LSAT scores."
Tibby did mention that
"people out of academia [such as
in service] for a while might be
helped in brushing up on skills"
by the LSAT courses.
Guy Browning of Stanford's
Psychological Counciling and
Testing Service believes "Much
can be learned by teaching ways
of thinking about a given type of
test item. A person after coaching
on test items and knowing about
the scale ... is in a better position
to take the test than a person who
doesn't know."
Familiarity Helpful
He continued "A person who is
familiar with the psychonometric
structure of the test... is less apt
to panic," and explained "A big
part of test taking is how a person
addresses himself to the test."
Jim Friend, a senior who has
recently taken the Kaplan course,
believes the preparation's
usefulness was not derived from
"helping you to answer questions
any better, but making you less
nervous going into the test."
Most people who have taken

the LSAT or advise law school
candidates agree that some review
is helpful. Differences of opinion
seem to center on whether or not
a student can prepare on his own
(using review books and old
LSAT's) as well as he can taking
the courses.
'Discipline'
Friend suggested "if a student
has the discipline to work alone, I
think he could probably get as
much as he could by taking the
course."
Gene Morones, a second year
law student and a pre-law advisor
»aaj3e stating "You can gain the
same feeling [of being
psychologically prepared for the
test] by buying a preparation
book or by working on a sample
test in the Pre law Handbook
provided by LSAT."
He added, "I never recommend
they [students] take the course,
but I'm not presumptuous to tell
them not t0.... I don't know of
anyone who recommends the
course."
Cites Pressures
Moloney believes the
preparation courses in the Bay
Area began as competition among
students became more intense and
"pressures from parents and other
sources to get into the best law
school. These people [students]
are easy prey."
Dean Keogh said "The Law
School Admissions Council is
continuously looking at these
enterprises to protect—so far as is
possible—prospective law
students. We're most concerned
with blatant irresponsibility—such
as promises to increase scores."
He added, however, "we haven't
found much of that."
In summarizing his regard for
the sources, Keogh declared "I'm
not aware of anything which goes
on in these courses which would
distinguish them from the review
possible when a student goes
through the published tests on his
or her own."
'Books Too Easy'
Director Bluth responded to
this criticism by saying "The
practice books are too
easy . . . [whereas] Kaplan tests
are more difficult than the
LSAT."
A number of students who
have taken the courses disagree,
however. For example, when Erin
Moore, a senior who took the
Berkeley review course was asked
whether the course can do more
for a student than available review
books, she answered "I would say
no."
Mark Morgenthaler took the
Kaplan course prior to last
October's LSAT. He also believes
a student could prepare
effectively on his own—if he did it
diligently, but he said "For me it
was easier to pay the money. ... I
spent a lot less time than I would
have on my own."
Timed Tests
The courses do provide five or
six time-disciplined practice tests
which might help the student who
would not otherwise take such

tests on his own. Even law schools
believe experience under pressure
with the LSAT helpful in raising
scores since they generally do not
recognize an improvement in a
student's second LSAT results
unless they exceed his first score
by 50 points.
Students seem to agree that
preparation provided by the
courses is as good as any—if any
preparation for the LSAT is
worthwhile. The question is
whether or not the courses are
worth $75 to $175 tuition.
Mike Bluth reports that
Kaplan's feedback has been "very
favorable" while director New of
the Western States Seminar stated
"we've had less than 2 percent
negative (responses)."
On the other hand, of the
seven Stanford students
interviewed for this article—who
have taken either the Kaplan or
LSAT Review courses—six
believed the courses were not
worth the expense."

"The course proved to be a
total waste. I feel stupid for
taking it."
"The students usually say that
the course definitely helped
them. ..."
'"The result of all this
preparation is that our students
take the actual LSAT fully
prepared and knowingexactlywhat
to expect. The resulting
psychological advantage cannot be
underestimated."
The Law School Admission
Test (LSAT) is an exercise all
prospective law students must
endure. It is administered five
times each year by the
Educational Testing Service
(ETS), under contract to the Law
School Admission Council, Inc. —
an organization which represents
137 accredited law schools.
According to the Law School
Admission Bulletin, published by
ETS, "the LSAT is a half-day
objective test designed to measure
certain mental capacities
important in the study of
law. ..." Its purpose is "to assess
the probability that the applicant
willbe successful in the study of
law."
Preparation Recommendations
Assoc. Law School Dean
William Keogh recommended that
students prepare for the LSAT by
choosing "courses which impose
an intellectual demand and pursue
them vigorously in a discipline
which appeals to them."
In recent years the number of
law school applications has
dramatically increased an;pressure
to do well on the LSAT has grown
progressively worse.
Since the LSAT is designed to
measure aptitude, short-term
preparation islimitedto sharpening
exam-taking skills and becoming
familiar with the test's format.
Almost everyone who has taken
the test, however, agrees that
some preparation is helpful.
Three Courses
Within the past three years,
three LSAT preparation courses
have begun operating in the Bay
Area. They provide students with
timed, in-class practice tests
written by employees of the
respective organizations.
Instructors also discuss test
questions and explain the
rationale behind correct answers.
All courses claim to help the
student raise his LSAT score.
The Stanley H. Kaplan
Educational Center, located in
San Jose, provides preparation for
a variety of tests required for
admission to post-graduate
schools. The LSAT classes meet
weekly for six 3'/2-hour periods
prior to the test date. The course
costs $175, plus a refundable $25
deposit for homework materials.

According to center director
Mike Bluth, "Our classes aren't
larger than 15 students and allow
individual attention."
Average Enrollment
The average enrollment is
30-40 students and the majority
of students come from Stanford
and Berkeley, Bluth said.
Homework materials provide
exercises in each LSAT area, and
students spend about ten hours
per week completing the
assignments, the director said.
Course instructors are law
students or recent law school
graduates. Bluth explained, "We
hire instructors on the basis of
their exam [LSAT] scores. We
take students because they
haven't been away from tests for
too long."

The Law School Admission
Test (LSAT) is an exercise all
prospective law students must
endure. It is administered five
times each year by the
Educational Testing Service
(ETS), under contract to the Law
School Admission Council, Inc. —
an organization which represents
137 accredited law schools.
According to the Law School
Admission Bulletin, published by
ETS, "the LSAT is a half-day
objective test designed to measure
certain mental capacities
important in the study of
law. ..." Its purpose is "to assess
the probability that the applicant
willbe successful in the study of
law."
Preparation Recommendations
Assoc. Law School Dean
William Keogh recommended that
students prepare for the LSAT by
choosing "courses which impose
an intellectual demand and pursue
them vigorously in a discipline
which appeals to them."
In recent years the number of
law school applications has
dramatically increased an;pressure
to do well on the LSAT has grown
progressively worse.
Since the LSAT is designed to
measure aptitude, short-term
preparation islimitedto sharpening
exam-taking skills and becoming
familiar with the test's format.
Almost everyone who has taken
the test, however, agrees that
some preparation is helpful.
Three Courses
Within the past three years,
three LSAT preparation courses
have begun operating in the Bay
Area. They provide students with
timed, in-class practice tests
written by employees of the
respective organizations.
Instructors also discuss test
questions and explain the
rationale behind correct answers.
All courses claim to help the
student raise his LSAT score.
The Stanley H. Kaplan
Educational Center, located in
San Jose, provides preparation for
a variety of tests required for
admission to post-graduate
schools. The LSAT classes meet
weekly for six 3'/2-hour periods
prior to the test date. The course
costs $175, plus a refundable $25
deposit for homework materials.

According to center director
Mike Bluth, "Our classes aren't
larger than 15 students and allow
individual attention."
Average Enrollment
The average enrollment is
30-40 students and the majority
of students come from Stanford
and Berkeley, Bluth said.
Homework materials provide
exercises in each LSAT area, and
students spend about ten hours
per week completing the
assignments, the director said.
Course instructors are law
students or recent law school
graduates. Bluth explained, "We
hire instructors on the basis of
their exam [LSAT] scores. We
take students because they
haven't been away from tests for
too long."
Bar Exam Results
Instructor Ron Cote, a 1972
Stanford Law School graduate, is
currently awaiting the results of
his California Bar Examination.
He pointed out, "The course
won't do anything radical [such
as] give you a rich vocabulary,
reading skills, or memory . . . but
can help you in subtle ways." He
gave an example of how the
course trains a student to spot
discrepancies between what a
person did and what a solution
says he did.
The LSAT Review Course is
taught by practicing attorneys in
Berkeley and consists of five
four-hour sessions. The $75
course is taught to the entire
50-60 student enrollment.
The course brochure reads, in
part, "At each class the student
gets to know and understand the
LSAT while at home he works on
homework which is given at each
class and reviewed at the
following class." It continues,
".. .at each class he (the student)
is taught important techniques for
improving his score. ... He will
learn how to approach certain
questions without imposing his
own values."
Self-Discipline
The course also "teaches a
student why he makes an error
and how to avoid repeating
it... furthermore [it] eliminates
any problem of disciplining
oneself to allot a certain amount
of time to prepare for the exam,"
the brochure concludes.
Pat Flowers, supervisor of the
LSAT Review Course, observed,
"The three key elements
(necessary for doing well on the
test) seem to be (a) being familiar
with the test, (b) having good
reading skills, and (c) thinking
logically." She stated that
students who have gone through
the course generally raise their
test scores "between 70 and 100
points."

When asked why lawyers are
used as instructors, she replied
.. attorneys know law well
enough so they can gear students
in the right direction."
Constant Updating
Both the Kaplan and LSAT
Review Courses emphasize their
practice tests and materials are
constantly updated on the basis of
the most recent LSAT's. When
asked how such information is
obtained, Bluth replied, "I really
don't know. I get the materials
from New York and I know they
have a staff working on that all
the time .. . you might call it a
trade secret."
The third course, the Western
States LSAT Study and
Preparation Seminar, is directed
by Ilson W. New in San Francisco.
It is given in four sessions covering
two days (Friday and Saturday)
just prior to the LSAT and lasts a
total of 15 hours. Tuition is $85.
The class size is usually
between 40 and 50 people and
director reported "the draw from
well-known schools was light." <
Instructors
The seminar enploys
instructors with Ph.D.'s in
psychology and education and
are, according to the course
brochure, "prominently
recognized authorities on testing."
New pointed out "there is nothing
in law school or law practice that
teaches you how to instruct."
In evaluating the seminar's
value, he said "Having an intensive
review and analysis [of the
LSAT] a short time before the
test helps the student to gain a
better perspective and overview of
the entire test."
The Educational Testing
Service downgrades the value of
such preparatory courses. The
Law School Admission Bulletin
states "Since the LSAT measures
intellectual qualities that develop
gradually and types of knowledge
that one accumulates over
relatively long periods of time, no
specific preparation can be made
immediately before the test."
No Sanction
It then concludes "There is no
evidence that taking cram courses
or studying review books results
in significant score gains. Neither
the Law School Admission
Council nor ETS sponsors,
supports, or sanctions courses,
schools, or books purporting to
improve LSAT scores."
Tibby did mention that
"people out of academia [such as
in service] for a while might be
helped in brushing up on skills"
by the LSAT courses.
Guy Browning of Stanford's
Psychological Counciling and
Testing Service believes "Much
can be learned by teaching ways
of thinking about a given type of
test item. A person after coaching
on test items and knowing about
the scale ... is in a better position
to take the test than a person who
doesn't know."
Familiarity Helpful
He continued "A person who is
familiar with the psychonometric
structure of the test... is less apt
to panic," and explained "A big
part of test taking is how a person
addresses himself to the test."
Jim Friend, a senior who has
recently taken the Kaplan course,
believes the preparation's
usefulness was not derived from
"helping you to answer questions
any better, but making you less
nervous going into the test."
Most people who have taken

the LSAT or advise law school
candidates agree that some review
is helpful. Differences of opinion
seem to center on whether or not
a student can prepare on his own
(using review books and old
LSAT's) as well as he can taking
the courses.
'Discipline'
Friend suggested "if a student
has the discipline to work alone, I
think he could probably get as
much as he could by taking the
course."
Gene Morones, a second year
law student and a pre-law advisor
»aaj3e stating "You can gain the
same feeling [of being
psychologically prepared for the
test] by buying a preparation
book or by working on a sample
test in the Pre law Handbook
provided by LSAT."
He added, "I never recommend
they [students] take the course,
but I'm not presumptuous to tell
them not t0.... I don't know of
anyone who recommends the
course."
Cites Pressures
Moloney believes the
preparation courses in the Bay
Area began as competition among
students became more intense and
"pressures from parents and other
sources to get into the best law
school. These people [students]
are easy prey."
Dean Keogh said "The Law
School Admissions Council is
continuously looking at these
enterprises to protect—so far as is
possible—prospective law
students. We're most concerned
with blatant irresponsibility—such
as promises to increase scores."
He added, however, "we haven't
found much of that."
In summarizing his regard for
the sources, Keogh declared "I'm
not aware of anything which goes
on in these courses which would
distinguish them from the review
possible when a student goes
through the published tests on his
or her own."
'Books Too Easy'
Director Bluth responded to
this criticism by saying "The
practice books are too
easy . . . [whereas] Kaplan tests
are more difficult than the
LSAT."
A number of students who
have taken the courses disagree,
however. For example, when Erin
Moore, a senior who took the
Berkeley review course was asked
whether the course can do more
for a student than available review
books, she answered "I would say
no."
Mark Morgenthaler took the
Kaplan course prior to last
October's LSAT. He also believes
a student could prepare
effectively on his own—if he did it
diligently, but he said "For me it
was easier to pay the money. ... I
spent a lot less time than I would
have on my own."
Timed Tests
The courses do provide five or
six time-disciplined practice tests
which might help the student who
would not otherwise take such

tests on his own. Even law schools
believe experience under pressure
with the LSAT helpful in raising
scores since they generally do not
recognize an improvement in a
student's second LSAT results
unless they exceed his first score
by 50 points.
Students seem to agree that
preparation provided by the
courses is as good as any—if any
preparation for the LSAT is
worthwhile. The question is
whether or not the courses are
worth $75 to $175 tuition.
Mike Bluth reports that
Kaplan's feedback has been "very
favorable" while director New of
the Western States Seminar stated
"we've had less than 2 percent
negative (responses)."
On the other hand, of the
seven Stanford students
interviewed for this article—who
have taken either the Kaplan or
LSAT Review courses—six
believed the courses were not
worth the expense."

book or by working on a sample
test in the Pre law Handbook
provided by LSAT."
He added, "I never recommend
they [students] take the course,
but I'm not presumptuous to tell
them not t0.... I don't know of
anyone who recommends the
course."
Cites Pressures
Moloney believes the
preparation courses in the Bay
Area began as competition among
students became more intense and
"pressures from parents and other
sources to get into the best law
school. These people [students]
are easy prey."
Dean Keogh said "The Law
School Admissions Council is
continuously looking at these
enterprises to protect—so far as is
possible—prospective law
students. We're most concerned
with blatant irresponsibility—such
as promises to increase scores."
He added, however, "we haven't
found much of that."
In summarizing his regard for
the sources, Keogh declared "I'm
not aware of anything which goes
on in these courses which would
distinguish them from the review
possible when a student goes
through the published tests on his
or her own."
'Books Too Easy'
Director Bluth responded to
this criticism by saying "The
practice books are too
easy . . . [whereas] Kaplan tests
are more difficult than the
LSAT."
A number of students who
have taken the courses disagree,
however. For example, when Erin
Moore, a senior who took the
Berkeley review course was asked
whether the course can do more
for a student than available review
books, she answered "I would say
no."
Mark Morgenthaler took the
Kaplan course prior to last
October's LSAT. He also believes
a student could prepare
effectively on his own—if he did it
diligently, but he said "For me it
was easier to pay the money. ... I
spent a lot less time than I would
have on my own."
Timed Tests
The courses do provide five or
six time-disciplined practice tests
which might help the student who
would not otherwise take such

tests on his own. Even law schools
believe experience under pressure
with the LSAT helpful in raising
scores since they generally do not
recognize an improvement in a
student's second LSAT results
unless they exceed his first score
by 50 points.
Students seem to agree that
preparation provided by the
courses is as good as any—if any
preparation for the LSAT is
worthwhile. The question is
whether or not the courses are
worth $75 to $175 tuition.
Mike Bluth reports that
Kaplan's feedback has been "very
favorable" while director New of
the Western States Seminar stated
"we've had less than 2 percent
negative (responses)."
On the other hand, of the
seven Stanford students
interviewed for this article—who
have taken either the Kaplan or
LSAT Review courses—six
believed the courses were not
worth the expense."
