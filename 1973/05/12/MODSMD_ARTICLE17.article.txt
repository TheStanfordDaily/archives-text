# Noted Government Advisor Endows GSB Faculty Chair
## 
### 
Marriner S. Eccles,
internationally-known banker,
business executive, and
government adviser, has
established the nation's first
professorship in public and private
management at the Graduate
School of Business.
The first holder of the Eccles
professorship has yet to be
announced.
Business School Dean Arjay
Miller termed the new
professorship "a fitting expression
of Marriner Eccles' longtime
recognition of the
interdependence of the public and
private sectors of our economy.
This is the first known
professorship of its kind devoted
to both government and business
management, and that's no
accident. Marriner Eccles has
never waited on tradition once he
has been convinced of a real
need."
Eccles has broad top-level
experience in government as well
as business and finance, having
served as assistant to the Secretary
of the Treasury in 1934, as
chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board from 1936 to 1948, and as
an adviser on fiscal and monetary
affairs throughout the Roosevelt
and Truman administrations.
"As a citizen," said Eccles, "I
am deeply concerned that
government, as well as business,

attract the high level of
management needed to face and
solve this country's problems
wisely and effectively. We must
prepare for change — rapid change
— and I think our first order of
priority is the training of
managers capable of assuming
leadership positions in both
sectors. I'm very impressed with
the Business School's new
program in public management.
The establishment of this
professorship also expresses my
appreciation for the managerial
talent Stanford has supplied Utah
International Inc. over the years,
and recognizes my own close
identification with the
University."
A resident of Salt Lake City,
Marriner Eccles maintains an
office at Utah International
Incorporated's San Francisco
headquarters, where he is honorary
chairman of the board.
He was born in Logan, Utah, in
1890, son of a Scottish immigrant
who amassed a fortune in lumber,
sugar, banking, mining and
construction enterprises in Utah,
Idaho, and Oregon. He attended
Brigham Young College and spent
his early working years managing
his family's business interests.
He has been the founder and
president and now the chairman
of the board of the First Security
Banking Corp. of Salt Lake City,

which owns and operates
numerous banks in Utah, Idaho,
and Wyoming; is the former
president and chairman of the
board of Utah Mining and
Construction Co. (now Utah
International Inc.) and the current
chairman of Amalgamated Sugar
Co. in Ogden.
After becoming active in
government during the depression
of the 19305, he served as a
member of the Board of
Economic Stabilization during
World War II and was a U.S.
delegate to the Bretton Woods
Conference in 1944. In addition,
he has served on a number of
government commissions and
industry councils concerned with
world trade and international
monetary and financial problems.
He has also been active in groups
urging world population control.
In 1972 he was given the
International Achievement award
by the World Trade Club in San
Francisco. In a speech accepting
the award, Eccles said: "For most
of my life, I have been working
for those issues which seem to me
basic for a stable and prosperous
society at home and a respected
position abroad. Whether it was
the population dilemma, fiscal
and monetary matters, or world
affairs, a lifetime of pressing for
change is actually all I can claim
credit for."

International Achievement award
by the World Trade Club in San
Francisco. In a speech accepting
the award, Eccles said: "For most
of my life, I have been working
for those issues which seem to me
basic for a stable and prosperous
society at home and a respected
position abroad. Whether it was
the population dilemma, fiscal
and monetary matters, or world
affairs, a lifetime of pressing for
change is actually all I can claim
credit for."
Marriner S. Eccles,
internationally-known banker,
business executive, and
government adviser, has
established the nation's first
professorship in public and private
management at the Graduate
School of Business.
The first holder of the Eccles
professorship has yet to be
announced.
Business School Dean Arjay
Miller termed the new
professorship "a fitting expression
of Marriner Eccles' longtime
recognition of the
interdependence of the public and
private sectors of our economy.
This is the first known
professorship of its kind devoted
to both government and business
management, and that's no
accident. Marriner Eccles has
never waited on tradition once he
has been convinced of a real
need."
Eccles has broad top-level
experience in government as well
as business and finance, having
served as assistant to the Secretary
of the Treasury in 1934, as
chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board from 1936 to 1948, and as
an adviser on fiscal and monetary
affairs throughout the Roosevelt
and Truman administrations.
"As a citizen," said Eccles, "I
am deeply concerned that
government, as well as business,

attract the high level of
management needed to face and
solve this country's problems
wisely and effectively. We must
prepare for change — rapid change
— and I think our first order of
priority is the training of
managers capable of assuming
leadership positions in both
sectors. I'm very impressed with
the Business School's new
program in public management.
The establishment of this
professorship also expresses my
appreciation for the managerial
talent Stanford has supplied Utah
International Inc. over the years,
and recognizes my own close
identification with the
University."
A resident of Salt Lake City,
Marriner Eccles maintains an
office at Utah International
Incorporated's San Francisco
headquarters, where he is honorary
chairman of the board.
He was born in Logan, Utah, in
1890, son of a Scottish immigrant
who amassed a fortune in lumber,
sugar, banking, mining and
construction enterprises in Utah,
Idaho, and Oregon. He attended
Brigham Young College and spent
his early working years managing
his family's business interests.
He has been the founder and
president and now the chairman
of the board of the First Security
Banking Corp. of Salt Lake City,

which owns and operates
numerous banks in Utah, Idaho,
and Wyoming; is the former
president and chairman of the
board of Utah Mining and
Construction Co. (now Utah
International Inc.) and the current
chairman of Amalgamated Sugar
Co. in Ogden.
After becoming active in
government during the depression
of the 19305, he served as a
member of the Board of
Economic Stabilization during
World War II and was a U.S.
delegate to the Bretton Woods
Conference in 1944. In addition,
he has served on a number of
government commissions and
industry councils concerned with
world trade and international
monetary and financial problems.
He has also been active in groups
urging world population control.
In 1972 he was given the
International Achievement award
by the World Trade Club in San
Francisco. In a speech accepting
the award, Eccles said: "For most
