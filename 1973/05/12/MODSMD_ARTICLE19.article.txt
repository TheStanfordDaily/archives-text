# Loggins, Messina Well Received In Berkeley
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
Kenny Loggins and Jim Messina appeared at the
Berkeley Community Theatre last Friday before a
very receptive audience. Their show was just what a
good rock concert should be, a progression from
quiet songs to a rocking finish, with plenty of
opportunity for the soloists to stretch out.
Loggins began solo, on acoustic guitar and
singing his own "House at Pooh Corner," which was
fortunately a little less sickeningly sweet than the
recorded version.
Next he did "Danny's Song," which he also
wrote, although it has been made popular by a
mediocre AM radio single. Drummer Merel Bregante
and bassist Larry Sims joined him midway through
the next song, after which he introduced Messina.
During the rest of the set, they were backed by a
two-man "everything section," Al Garth and Jon
Clarke. Garth plays alto sax, violin, recorders, and
percussion, and Clarke, soprano, tenor, and baritone
saxes, recorders, electric flute, and percussion.
Important Additions
Between them they manage to add more music
to the band than seems possible. Garth did a fine
alto solo and a duet with Clarke's soprano on
"Angry Eyes," then a hot duet with Clarke's tenor
and soprano.
Most of the latter half of the set was from the
band's first album, "Sittin' In," including "Lovin'
Me," a string of three songs which ends with the
beautiful "Peace of Mind."
Jim and Kenny's vocals, with occasional help
from Larry Sims, were excellent, and just plain felt

good.
The two leaders' stage styles are quite different,
but both add to the overall effect of the band.
Kenny runs and jumps around the stage with the
enthusiasm of a kid with a new toy, while Jim
stands off to one side playing the cool rock star
game, and moving all over the stage when it's his
turn to lead. Once or twice he would go over to one
of the other musicians and play duet passages or
trade licks.
Highlight
The highlight of the set was "Vahevella," a song
about sailors and ports in Jamaica. Part of the song
has a sort of calypso feel, but there is a long
instrumental break which featured Clarke's electric
flute. Using echoes and othereffects, imitating sea
sounds, he gave the impression of an extremely long
ocean voyage, with the excitement building as thf-y
approach shore.
The band saved its current hit single, "Your
Mama Don't Dance and Your Daddy Don't Rock
and Roll," for their encore, and had no trouble
keeping the crowd on its feet all the way through.
They finished with "Nobody But You," from the
first album. The audience called for more, but the
band had another show to do, and declined another
encore.
There are certainly bands around with bigger
stars than Loggins and Messina, but they gave a
creditable performance which was musically
interesting and satisfying and was warmly received
by the audience. That seems to me the best way to
judge the success of any concert.

very receptive audience. Their show was just what a
good rock concert should be, a progression from
quiet songs to a rocking finish, with plenty of
opportunity for the soloists to stretch out.
Loggins began solo, on acoustic guitar and
singing his own "House at Pooh Corner," which was
fortunately a little less sickeningly sweet than the
recorded version.
Next he did "Danny's Song," which he also
wrote, although it has been made popular by a
mediocre AM radio single. Drummer Merel Bregante
and bassist Larry Sims joined him midway through
the next song, after which he introduced Messina.
During the rest of the set, they were backed by a
two-man "everything section," Al Garth and Jon
Clarke. Garth plays alto sax, violin, recorders, and
percussion, and Clarke, soprano, tenor, and baritone
saxes, recorders, electric flute, and percussion.
Important Additions
Between them they manage to add more music
to the band than seems possible. Garth did a fine
alto solo and a duet with Clarke's soprano on
"Angry Eyes," then a hot duet with Clarke's tenor
and soprano.
Most of the latter half of the set was from the
band's first album, "Sittin' In," including "Lovin'
Me," a string of three songs which ends with the
beautiful "Peace of Mind."
Jim and Kenny's vocals, with occasional help
from Larry Sims, were excellent, and just plain felt

good.
The two leaders' stage styles are quite different,
but both add to the overall effect of the band.
Kenny runs and jumps around the stage with the
enthusiasm of a kid with a new toy, while Jim
stands off to one side playing the cool rock star
game, and moving all over the stage when it's his
turn to lead. Once or twice he would go over to one
of the other musicians and play duet passages or
trade licks.
Highlight
The highlight of the set was "Vahevella," a song
about sailors and ports in Jamaica. Part of the song
has a sort of calypso feel, but there is a long
instrumental break which featured Clarke's electric
flute. Using echoes and othereffects, imitating sea
sounds, he gave the impression of an extremely long
ocean voyage, with the excitement building as thf-y
approach shore.
The band saved its current hit single, "Your
Mama Don't Dance and Your Daddy Don't Rock
and Roll," for their encore, and had no trouble
keeping the crowd on its feet all the way through.
They finished with "Nobody But You," from the
first album. The audience called for more, but the
band had another show to do, and declined another
encore.
There are certainly bands around with bigger
stars than Loggins and Messina, but they gave a
creditable performance which was musically
interesting and satisfying and was warmly received
by the audience. That seems to me the best way to
judge the success of any concert.
