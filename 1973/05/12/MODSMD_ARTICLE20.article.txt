# 'Tournee' Screens Innovative Flicks
## 
### ROBERT SHERWOOD 
Selected from over 500 entries,
the final twenty-one films that
comprise the Eighth International
Tournee of Animation to be
shown Saturday, May 12 in
Memorial Auditorium, represent
the year's highest achievements in
animated shorts.
They vary from colorful
cartoons to bizarre graphic
montages to grim stop-frame
collages. Their effects are
sometimes humorous, sometimes
mind-tickling; and sometimes
prophetic. The program features
films from Eastern and Western
Europe, Japan, Canada, and nine
shorts from the United States.
Heading the list of unique
animation styles is "Frank Film"
done by Frank Mouris in New
York. In a free-association,
auto-biographical narrative,
Mouris uses thousands of
magazine cutouts as a kinetic
statement on American
materialism and how it has shaped
his life. "Sandman," also done in
New York, animates sand into an
evocative presentation of a dream.
"Damon The Mower," from
Great Britain, enacts a surreal
sequence from a famous line in
one of Shelley's poems. "Nails," a
Swiss film, uses stop-frame
photography to show "the origin,
overpropogation and degeneration
of the human race in an abstract
way."
Social Commentaries
Two films treat man's social
situation in differing manners:
"Propaganda Message" by the
National Film Board of Canada
and "Tup Tup," by a Yugoslavian
animator. The Canadian film
attempts to deal with man's social
problems in a numerous, though
insightful fashion.
"Tup Tup," an Academy
Award Nominee, records the
frustrations of a man who is

trying to escape from a thumping
sound he attributes to life in the
city. His attempts at escape lead
into a sort of apocalyptic revenge
on the entire human race.
Three cartoon features are
included in his collection of
films.: an eight-minute version of
the Academy Award winning "A
Christmas Carol" from England, a
Hollywood version of the Chaucer
tale "The Magic Pear Tree," and a
monster spoof about a man-eating
chocolate cake entitled "The Mad
Baker." "A Christmas Carol" is an
excellent rendition of the Dickens
story and can be seen as a tribute
to Walt Disney's animated
spectaculars.
Best of Animation
"The Magic Pear Tree" is an
example of the best of
present-day modern Hollywood
animation. The outstanding
feature of "The Mad Baker" is
that the dozen or so voices in the
film are done by the same person.
Other interesting shorts include
the perplexing work by
Frenchman Piotr Kan ' r entitled
"Delicious Castastropny." Its
obscure symbolism is purely
unfathomable and lends itself to
endless interpretation, i* or Your
Pleasure" is a powerful
commentary on our tendency to
destroy our environment in the
pursuit of pleasure.
"5.0.5.," a Hungarian film, is a
grim allegorical work on death by
drowning and is done in the style
of an Edvard Munch woodcut.
The notes and chords of a piano
create exotic gardens and colorful
figures in "Fantasy of Piano."
In many ways film animation
can be considered the most
complex art form yet devised.
Innovative and engaging, these
twenty-one shorts represent
consummate craftsmanship in the
art.

Best of Animation
"The Magic Pear Tree" is an
example of the best of
present-day modern Hollywood
animation. The outstanding
feature of "The Mad Baker" is
that the dozen or so voices in the
film are done by the same person.
Other interesting shorts include
the perplexing work by
Frenchman Piotr Kan ' r entitled
"Delicious Castastropny." Its
obscure symbolism is purely
unfathomable and lends itself to
endless interpretation, i* or Your
Pleasure" is a powerful
commentary on our tendency to
destroy our environment in the
pursuit of pleasure.
"5.0.5.," a Hungarian film, is a
grim allegorical work on death by
drowning and is done in the style
of an Edvard Munch woodcut.
The notes and chords of a piano
create exotic gardens and colorful
figures in "Fantasy of Piano."
In many ways film animation
can be considered the most
complex art form yet devised.
Innovative and engaging, these
twenty-one shorts represent
consummate craftsmanship in the
art.
Selected from over 500 entries,
the final twenty-one films that
comprise the Eighth International
Tournee of Animation to be
shown Saturday, May 12 in
Memorial Auditorium, represent
the year's highest achievements in
animated shorts.
They vary from colorful
cartoons to bizarre graphic
montages to grim stop-frame
collages. Their effects are
sometimes humorous, sometimes
mind-tickling; and sometimes
prophetic. The program features
films from Eastern and Western
Europe, Japan, Canada, and nine
shorts from the United States.
Heading the list of unique
animation styles is "Frank Film"
done by Frank Mouris in New
York. In a free-association,
auto-biographical narrative,
Mouris uses thousands of
magazine cutouts as a kinetic
statement on American
materialism and how it has shaped
his life. "Sandman," also done in
New York, animates sand into an
evocative presentation of a dream.
"Damon The Mower," from
Great Britain, enacts a surreal
sequence from a famous line in
one of Shelley's poems. "Nails," a
Swiss film, uses stop-frame
photography to show "the origin,
overpropogation and degeneration
of the human race in an abstract
way."
Social Commentaries
Two films treat man's social
situation in differing manners:
"Propaganda Message" by the
National Film Board of Canada
and "Tup Tup," by a Yugoslavian
animator. The Canadian film
attempts to deal with man's social
problems in a numerous, though
insightful fashion.
"Tup Tup," an Academy
Award Nominee, records the
frustrations of a man who is

trying to escape from a thumping
sound he attributes to life in the
city. His attempts at escape lead
into a sort of apocalyptic revenge
on the entire human race.
Three cartoon features are
included in his collection of
films.: an eight-minute version of
the Academy Award winning "A
Christmas Carol" from England, a
Hollywood version of the Chaucer
tale "The Magic Pear Tree," and a
monster spoof about a man-eating
chocolate cake entitled "The Mad
Baker." "A Christmas Carol" is an
excellent rendition of the Dickens
story and can be seen as a tribute
to Walt Disney's animated
spectaculars.
