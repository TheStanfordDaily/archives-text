Officials Disclaim Burglary
LOS ANGELES — The Pentagon papers trial judge
released four affidavits yesterday from Justice
Department officials who swore they had no
knowledge of a burglary at the office of Daniel
Ellsberg's psychiatrist until it was mentioned in a
memo from the Watergate prosecutor April 16.
However, none of the four explained why the
judge was not informed of the matter until 10 days
later on April 26.
U.S. District Court Judge Matt Byrne had asked
the government, at the request of the defendants, to
explain about the delay.
But the four affidavits from Asst. Atty. Gen.
Henry E. Petersen, Deputy Asst. Atty. Gen. Kevin
T. Maroney, Justice Department attorney John
Martin and the trial prosecutor, Asst. U.S. Atty.
David Nissen, made no mention of the time lapse.
A spokesman for defense attorneys representing
Ellsberg and Anthony J. Russo said they considered
the affidavits "entirely insufficient" and would
continue to press for a hearing with testimony on
the matter.
Defense attorneys, in their original arguments for
such a hearing, cited news reports alleging that
President Nixon personally impeded the disclosure
to the judge. The defense has suggested that Nixon
might be eligible for subpoena to testify if such a
hearing is held. They said they are still "actively
considering" that possibility.
Petersen, director of the criminal division of the
Justice Department and head of the Watergate
probe, said he had heard nothing of a September
1971 break-in at Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office until
he received the April 16 memorandum from
Watergate prosecutor Earl J. Silbert.
Silbert did not submit an affidavit, and has
refused to tell the judge the source of his
information that Watergate conspirators E. Howard
Hunt and G. Gordon Liddy allegedly had
committed the burglary.
"I am unaware of any information received by
the Department of Justice in connection with its
investigation of ... the Pentagon papers," Petersen
said, ".. . which came, or could have come, from
the alleged burglary ..."
FBI Spied On Demonstrators
WASHINGTON — FBI agents and informers

infiltrated the leadership of most groups that
demonstrated at the national political conventions
last summer and took part in planning protests, a
Justice Department source said yesterday.
The source said he attended several department
meetings at which convention intelligence reports
from the FBI and other federal agencies, including
Army intelligence, were discussed.
He said then-Atty. Gen. Richard G. Kleindienst
ran the meetings and Former FBI acting Director L.
Patrick Gray 111 and Robert Mardian, a former top
department official who then was a staff member of
the Committee for the Re-election of the President,
attended them. The careers of all three men later
were touched by the Watergate scandal.
The source said he did not know the names of
any of the groups the FBI infiltrated or of any
protest planning that undercover agents and
informers may have prompted during the Miami
Beach, Fla., conventions of the Democratic and
Republican parties.
An FBI spokesman said the bureau maintains
surveillance through agents and informants on
groups deemed a threat to national security. He said
there were such groups in Miami Beach but declined
to name them.
"This does not mean we had informants in
legitimate peace groups," he added.
The source said that Mardian, head of the Justice
Department's Internal Security Division until March
1972, had no status within the department at the
time of the meetings. His job then was solely with
the re-election committee. No representative of the
Democratic Party ever attended the meetings, he
said.
Radical Alleges Mistreatment
MADISON, Wis. — Karleton L. Armstrong, accused
of arson and murder in the 1970 bombing of a
University of Wisconsin building, has accused the
prosecution of treating him like an animal in a
circus arena.
"I don't want to be a spectator at my own trial,"
Armstrong said Tuesday in a 60-minute telephone
interview.
The former University of Wisconsin student
telephoned The Associated Press in defiance of an
injunction which bars him from discussing the case
with members of the press.
Armstrong, 27, now held in Dane County Jail in

lieu of $450,000 bail, was indicted in the 1970
bombing of UW's Army Mathematics Research
Center following antiwar demonstrations. Robert
Fassnacht, 33, a research physicist working in a
laboratory, was killed in the predawn explosion.
Lebanese Attack Guerrillas
BEIRUT — Lebanese jet fighters rocketed and
strafed Palestinian guerrilla positions near the Syrian
border late yesterday after a day-long artillery
barrage against commando infiltrators.
Residents of villages near the border said the jets
— Hawker Hunters, Mirages and a Fouga Magister —
hit positions near the villages of Yanta, Deir el
Ashayer and Bayader al Adass for more than two
hours.
A Lebanese army spokesman confirmed the
report. There were 20 sorties, according to
witnesses.
President Suleiman Franjieh halted the use of air
force jets Tuesday night when he appealed to both
sides to abide by the cease-fire.
But the Lebanese army, which has assumed
control of the country under the state of
emergency, warned guerrillas that "if they do not
abide by the cease-fire we will retaliate intensively
and violently." The army said the firing was in self
defense "to save lives."
Indictments Returned
SIOUX FALLS, S.D. — A federal grand jury in
Sioux Falls has returned 24 indictments against 31
persons involved in the seige of Wounded Knee, the
U.S. Attorney's office said yesterday.
Most of the indictments returned Monday and
Tuesday charged obstruction of federal officers by
attempting to leave or enter Wounded Knee with
supplies. Addresses of many of those charged were
not immediately available.
The grand jury has held two previous sessions to
consider indictments as a result of the 70-day
occupation. Asst. U.S. Atty. David Geinapp said he
anticipated another grand jury session June 4.
