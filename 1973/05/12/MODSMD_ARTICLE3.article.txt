# Reason For Election Withdrawal
## Joint Council Cites Competition 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Stanford Joint Council spokesman
Don Mowery yesterday cited
unwanted competition with United
Stanford Employees (USE) as the
reason for the Joint Council's
withdrawal from the June 6
representation election for over 1600
University employees.
"Our surveys showed that one-third
of the electorate is going to vote 'no
union' no matter what happens. That
leaves only two-thirds for us and USE
to split up. There'd almost certainly be
a runoff between one of us and 'no
union' and with the [initial] campaign
being so rough, 'no union' would
probably win," Mowery explained.
"I think a contest between two

unions obscures the real issues of
whether the employees want to
organize to get better conditions with
the University," Mowery added.
The Stanford Joint Council is made
up of Local 101 of American
Federation of State, County, and
Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and
Local 3 of the International
Brotherhood of Operating Engineers.
It requested withdrawal from the
election over the weekend.
Mowery, an international organizer
for AFSCME, explained that he and
Walt Norris, an Operating Engineers
organizer, made the decision to
withdraw on their own, without any
pressure from either union or the
AFL-CIO.
AFL-CIO Position
The Joint Council spokesman made
it clear that the AFL-CIO did not
object to having two of its member
unions running against each other in
such an election. USE has affiliated
with the Service Employees
International Union (SEIU), also of
the AFL-CIO.
"The AFL-CIO can exert no
control over its affiliate bodies.
However, no one in the AFL-CIO likes
to see 'blood-letting' between two of
its members," Mowery said.
Asked whether the Joint Council
would support USE, Mowery said that
it would take no position, but that he
would never urge "any employee to
vote against any organization in the
AFL-CIO."
Employees' Choice
"If anyone asks me, I'll tell them to
make their own decision based on the
issues," Mowery continued.
Should USE win the June 6
election, in which it will be against

only a 'no union' choice, Mowery said
that the Joint Council would make no
attempt to organize any other group
of Stanford employees.
If USE doesn't win, "we'll have to
re-examine the situation," Mowery
said.
The AFSCME organizer refused to
comment on whether he thought USE
would win, saying only that "if we had
been on the ballot, they certainly
wouldn't have won," and hinting that
he felt neither AFL-CIO organization
would have been able to garner 50
percent of the vote in either the
general election or the runoff.
"It wouldn't have been in the best
interests of ourselves or the employees
to have two unions on the ballot,"
Mowery said.
Ridiculous Salaries
"The issue should be the
employer," Mowery said. "The salaries
are ridiculously low in some jobs at
the University; at some other schools
in the county employees make almost
twice what they get at Stanofrd,
especially in fringe benefits."
The now-defunct Stanford Joint
Council, does claim one legacy: USE's
affilitation with the SEIU.
"We were highly instrumental in
moving USFintothe house of labor. It
became apparent that the major
portion of the employees were
interested in an AFL-CIO union,"
after the Joint Council's formation,
Mowery said.
The Joint Council's withdrawal will
probably become official early today.
The National Labor Relations Board
has reached the decision but has not
released the information pending
notification of all parties this morning,
the Daily has learned.

union' and with the [initial] campaign
being so rough, 'no union' would
probably win," Mowery explained.
"I think a contest between two

unions obscures the real issues of
whether the employees want to
organize to get better conditions with
the University," Mowery added.
The Stanford Joint Council is made
up of Local 101 of American
Federation of State, County, and
Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and
Local 3 of the International
Brotherhood of Operating Engineers.
It requested withdrawal from the
election over the weekend.
Mowery, an international organizer
for AFSCME, explained that he and
Walt Norris, an Operating Engineers
organizer, made the decision to
withdraw on their own, without any
pressure from either union or the
AFL-CIO.
AFL-CIO Position
The Joint Council spokesman made
it clear that the AFL-CIO did not
object to having two of its member
unions running against each other in
such an election. USE has affiliated
with the Service Employees
International Union (SEIU), also of
the AFL-CIO.
"The AFL-CIO can exert no
control over its affiliate bodies.
However, no one in the AFL-CIO likes
to see 'blood-letting' between two of
its members," Mowery said.
Asked whether the Joint Council
would support USE, Mowery said that
it would take no position, but that he
would never urge "any employee to
vote against any organization in the
AFL-CIO."
Employees' Choice
"If anyone asks me, I'll tell them to
make their own decision based on the
issues," Mowery continued.
Should USE win the June 6
election, in which it will be against

only a 'no union' choice, Mowery said
that the Joint Council would make no
attempt to organize any other group
of Stanford employees.
If USE doesn't win, "we'll have to
re-examine the situation," Mowery
said.
The AFSCME organizer refused to
comment on whether he thought USE
would win, saying only that "if we had
been on the ballot, they certainly
wouldn't have won," and hinting that
he felt neither AFL-CIO organization
would have been able to garner 50
percent of the vote in either the
general election or the runoff.
"It wouldn't have been in the best
interests of ourselves or the employees
to have two unions on the ballot,"
Mowery said.
Ridiculous Salaries
"The issue should be the
employer," Mowery said. "The salaries
are ridiculously low in some jobs at
the University; at some other schools
in the county employees make almost
twice what they get at Stanofrd,
especially in fringe benefits."
The now-defunct Stanford Joint
Council, does claim one legacy: USE's
affilitation with the SEIU.
"We were highly instrumental in
moving USFintothe house of labor. It
became apparent that the major
portion of the employees were
interested in an AFL-CIO union,"
after the Joint Council's formation,
Mowery said.
The Joint Council's withdrawal will
probably become official early today.
The National Labor Relations Board
has reached the decision but has not
released the information pending
notification of all parties this morning,
the Daily has learned.

Stanford Joint Council spokesman
Don Mowery yesterday cited
unwanted competition with United
Stanford Employees (USE) as the
reason for the Joint Council's
withdrawal from the June 6
representation election for over 1600
University employees.
"Our surveys showed that one-third
of the electorate is going to vote 'no
union' no matter what happens. That
leaves only two-thirds for us and USE
to split up. There'd almost certainly be
a runoff between one of us and 'no
union' and with the [initial] campaign
being so rough, 'no union' would
probably win," Mowery explained.
