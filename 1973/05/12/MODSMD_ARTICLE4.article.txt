## 
### JAMES LOBSENZ 
The Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (C-US) declined yesterday to
act as an arbitrator between the Policy
Board of the Student Center for
Innovation and Research in Education
(SCIRE) and the Office of the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies (ODUS).
C-US had been asked to act as a
final arbitrator by the SCIRE Policy
Board, to resolve the question of what
body, ODUS or the Policy Board, had
been granted the authority to
supervise the actions of the SCIRE
director,
Ron Jones, the present director of
SCIRE, was notified recently by James
L. Gibbs, Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, that he would not be offered
another contract when his present one
expires this June 30.
The Policy Board, in a unanimous
decision, announced thereafter that
they were severing all official
connections with ODUS, and fully
supported the retention of Ron Jones
as director.
Jones has filed a petition for a
grievance hearing with the Department
of Personnel and Employee Relations.
C-US chairman Edwin Good, a
professor of religion, stated that C-US
felt it had no authority or
responsibility to arbitrate on the issue
at hand. Their decision, indicated
Good, was unanimous.
"The decisions about SCIRE and
the Policy Board were made in actions
by the Faculty Senate, in renewing
SCIRE's charge this last January,"
asserted Good. "We [C-US] think that
the problems are soluble [sic] in terms
of the charges."
Furthermore Good stated that it
was imperative that "C-US stay
entirely out of the grievance
procedures."
As far as solving the issue of
administrative supervision of the
SCIRE director, Good stated "my
personal belief is that the Policy Board
should sit down with the dean and
talk."
