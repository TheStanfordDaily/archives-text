# Transportation Official Resigns, Authorized Ellsberg Break-In
## 
### Associated Press 
WASHINGTON — Another top level
executive quit the Nixon
administration yesterday, accepting
full responsibility for dispatching a
team of burglars to rifle Daniel
Ellsberg's psychiatric files.
"With public confidence in our
government already shaken by the
Watergate affair, and with the
complete affirmation of your personal
integrity so imperative at this time, I
cannot remain in the administration,"

Egil Krogh wrote President Nixon.
Krogh was undersecretary of
transportation, a $42,500-a-year job
he took last January after leaving a
White House post as assistant to John
D. Ehrlichman.
His resignation brought the number
of high echelon people leaving or being
fired from the administration to at
least 10, including Ehrlichman, who
had been Nixon's top domestic
assistant.
'Plumbers'
The 33-year-old Krogh had said
earlier he agreed to the burglary
mission hatched by Watergate
conspirators G. Gordon Liddy and E.
Howard Hunt, whom he had hired as
"plumbers" to investigate leaks of the
Pentagon Papers.
Hunt has testified that he and
Liddy supervised the burglary of the
office of Dr. Lewis Fielding in Beverly
Hills, Calif. He said he and Liddy
photographed Fielding's office and
cased the operation a week in advance
and then returned with three Cubans
Sept. 3, 1971 and acted as lookouts
while they searched the files of
Ellsberg, now on trial for stealing the
Pentagon Papers.
Krogh's resignation came as the
White House moved to recover original
documents that ousted presidential
counsel John W. Dean 111 secreted in a
bank safe deposit box before he was
fired by Nixon.
Keys Sent To Judge
Dean had sent the keys to the box
to Chief U.S. Dist. Judge John J. Sirica
saying that on the one hand he feared
they would otherwise be destroyed
and, on the other, that he — Dean —
had no right to them since he no
longer had security clearance.
"As Mr. Dean acknowledges, these
documents 'may have a bearing' on the
subjects under investigation" by the
Watergate grand jury, the
government's brief said. It voiced no
objection to copies being held by the
court and by prosecutors.
In other Watergate developments,
Elliot L. Richardson said yesterday he
would delegate full responsibility for
the Watergate case to a special
prosecutor if he is confirmed as
attorney general, but refused to
surrender final authority.
Warren's Advice
Richardson, now defense secretary,
said he would seek the advice of
former Chief Justice Earl Warren and
leading attorneys in making selection
of the person to direct the
government's investigation of the

Watergate case.
He also said he believes the
prosecutor should be part of the
Justice Department with the title of
special assistant attorney general and
should answer to no one but himself.
The special prosecutor, he said,
should not be established in an
independent agency created by
Congress because he would lack the
resources of the Justice Department.
Richardson made his comments in
his first appearance before the Senate
Judiciary Committee reviewing his
credentials to succeed Richard G.
Kleindienst as attorney general.
Kleindienst resigned last week
because his close personal and
professional friends had been
implicated in the Watergate scandal.
Richardson is not expected to run

into trouble before the committee but
there was speculation that the panel
might delay final consideration of his
nomination until he names the special
prosecutor.
Sen. Philip A. Hart (D-Mich.), said
the committee "ought not move
toward confirmation until there is an
agreement on the ground rules
governing the special prosecutor.
"We're concerned with more than
giving the President his man," said
Hart. "We're concerned with getting
all the facts in the Watergate case and
with restoring public confidence in the
ability of government to work."
The Michigan Democrat's
statements were prompted by
Richardson's refusal to excuse himself
from the Watergate case as did
Kleindienst.
