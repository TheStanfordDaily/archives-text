# Beaty Admits Lying In Chino Escape Case
## 
### 
Convict Ronald Wayne Beaty
admitted under cross-examination in
his escape case yesterday that he had
lied to a county grand jury in a
statement involving fired English Prof.
H. Bruce Franklin.
Beaty faced extensive examination
from Oakland attorney Charles Garry,
who also is defense attorney for the
Black Panthers, in the trial in which
Beaty is the star prosecution witness.
He has testified against defendants
Benton Douglas Burt, and wife Andrea
Holman Burt, who is the daugher of
Medicine Prof. Halsted Holman.
The Burts are charged with murder,
assault and freeing a prisoner in the
Oct. 6 escape by Beaty from two
prison guards while enroute for a
courthouse appearance from the
California Institution for Men at
Chino.
Garry's Question
Garry asked Beaty, who has turned
state's evidence although he himself

has been sentenced to life in prison on
a murder charge in the same case, this
question:
"Did you lie when you testified
before the grand jury on Dec. 21,
1972?"
Beaty replied: "I didn't tell the
complete truth."
Lied About Blindfolding
When Garry pressed the witness for
details, Beaty told the court that he
lied to the grand jury in saying that
Franklin gave instructions to blindfold
him en route to a San Mateo County
cabin hide-out.
Beaty also admitted he told the
grand jury that he did not know the
exact location of the cabin because he
was blindfolded while he was driven
there, when in fact he was not
blindfolded at all during the drive and
was able to observe the route to the
hideaway.
Garry also elicited an admission
from the witness that he had lied in
saying he spent the first night after the
escape at the Los Altos home of a
woman he identified as Sylvia Stead.
Beaty had testified in court on
Monday about where he was that
night.
Previous Conviction
Garry referred to a 1971 Beaty
kidnapping-escape incident after which
he said Beaty "created the same kind
of atmosphere by implicating other
people." Garry pointed out that Beaty
was convicted of the Arizona
kidnapping because the jury could not
believe his explanation of the incident.
Beaty answered questions about a
code among convicts that encourages
them to lie while they are testifying in
court proceedings. Garry claimed that
Beaty had adhered to that code when
he lied about the facts of the 1971
kidnapping-escape.
The cross-examination of the
escapee occupied the entire court
session yesterday and will continue
today. Garry will make further
attempts to convince the jury that
Beaty is not credible as a witness.
