# Individual Learning Augments Lectures
## 
### JANIS ULEVICH 
A feeling that lecture hall learning
alone is not enough has prompted the
creation of increasingly popular
individualized learning programs at
Stanford, chiefly in the sciences.
Tutorial programs have been
established in the physics, math and
chemistry departments to supplement
the student's classroom work as well as
to permit the student to advance on a
more individual basis.
The first such experiment was the
physics department's "Reference
Frame," begun in autumn of 1971 by
Profs. Mason Yearian and Walter
Meyerhof. The "Frame" is a tutorial
and counseling drop-in center for
physics students, especially those in
the introductory courses.
The center, according to Yearian,
replaces teaching assistants' office
hours and makes assistants available
almost continuously in one place from
morning to evening each weekday, for
consultation by phone or in person.
"Students like the idea that there's
somebody there 40 hours a week," he
said.
1400 Visits
Equipped with a small library and
an electronic calculator, the center is
working "exceptionally well," Yearian
said, citing the 1400 student visits last
quarter. Its only problem, he said, is
that overcrowding occasionally causes
long waits.

The "Reference Frame" has
become a model for similar
departmental programs, most of which
have been aided in planning and
administration by the new Learning
Assistance Center begun last fall.
The math department's Consulting
Center was initiated autumn quarter
by Prof. Paul Berg, because of "a
long-perceived need — namely that
students weren't really using office
hours as one might hope they would."
Office Hours Inconvenient
Individual office hours aren't
always used well, Berg said, because
they are often inconvenient; a student
frequently needs help in the middle of
a homework assignment, when his
professor or course assistant isn't
available. In addition, Berg said,
students sometimes feel reluctant to
"appear stupid" in front of the
instructor who grades them.
The chemistry department, too, has
set up an information room to give
students an opportunity to "talk
chemistry," according to a department
resume. Formerly students were
hesitant about going into a research
lab to find their TAs, chemistry
lecturer Karen Long said.
The response of course assistants to
these programs is generally good.
"There are sometimes more grad
students than are actually scheduled"
to help students at the "Reference
