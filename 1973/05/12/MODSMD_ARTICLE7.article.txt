# Individual Learning Augments Lectures
## 
### JANIS ULEVICH 
A feeling that lecture hall learning
alone is not enough has prompted the
creation of increasingly popular
individualized learning programs at
Stanford, chiefly in the sciences.
Tutorial programs have been
established in the physics, math and
chemistry departments to supplement
the student's classroom work as well as
to permit the student to advance on a
more individual basis.
The first such experiment was the
physics department's "Reference
Frame," begun in autumn of 1971 by
Profs. Mason Yearian and Walter
Meyerhof. The "Frame" is a tutorial
and counseling drop-in center for
physics students, especially those in
the introductory courses.
The center, according to Yearian,
replaces teaching assistants' office
hours and makes assistants available
almost continuously in one place from
morning to evening each weekday, for
consultation by phone or in person.
"Students like the idea that there's
somebody there 40 hours a week," he
said.
1400 Visits
Equipped with a small library and
an electronic calculator, the center is
working "exceptionally well," Yearian
said, citing the 1400 student visits last
quarter. Its only problem, he said, is
that overcrowding occasionally causes
long waits.

The "Reference Frame" has
become a model for similar
departmental programs, most of which
have been aided in planning and
administration by the new Learning
Assistance Center begun last fall.
The math department's Consulting
Center was initiated autumn quarter
by Prof. Paul Berg, because of "a
long-perceived need — namely that
students weren't really using office
hours as one might hope they would."
Office Hours Inconvenient
Individual office hours aren't
always used well, Berg said, because
they are often inconvenient; a student
frequently needs help in the middle of
a homework assignment, when his
professor or course assistant isn't
available. In addition, Berg said,
students sometimes feel reluctant to
"appear stupid" in front of the
instructor who grades them.
The chemistry department, too, has
set up an information room to give
students an opportunity to "talk
chemistry," according to a department
resume. Formerly students were
hesitant about going into a research
lab to find their TAs, chemistry
lecturer Karen Long said.
The response of course assistants to
these programs is generally good.
"There are sometimes more grad
students than are actually scheduled"
to help students at the "Reference
Frame," Yearian said.
Math graduate student Eric
Isaacson admitted the consulting
center entails more work than office
hours, but, he said, "it's work that I
should be doing. The TA's time, which
the students deserve, is finally being
used by the students."
The chemistry information center,
however, is being used much less now
than in the past two quarters. "There's
a test Friday," course assistant Jeffrey
Richardson said, "and we might have
five students up here." Long
attributed this in part to the
elimination this quarter of chemistry
discussion sessions, which provided an
initial foundation for more interaction
between teaching assistants and
students.
Besides the department-based
programs, the Learning Assistance
Center (LAC) is responsible for other
learning services.
'Dating Bureau'
The LAC office contains a file of
over 150 tutors on all subjects, which
director Mike McHargue compared to
a "dating bureau." The student comes
in, locates a tutor in his subject, and
the two set up their own contract,
which usually pays the tutor $3.50 per
hour.
The Undergraduate Writing
Program (UWP), however, offers free
tutoring in writing. The program's
tutors, director Ellen Nold said, are
mostly "college English teachers who
are out of jobs or are moonlighting."
Not only tutoring programs, but
actual courses geared more than usual
toward the individual, are increasing in
number.
'Mastery Learning'
A math department experiment
called "Scientific Analysis Through

Mathematical Understanding," created
by Prof. Karel deLeeuw and graduate
student Philip Faillace, is based on
"mastery learning." This educational
theory assumes that "aptitude" is
related primarily to the length of time
a student requires to achieve a given
level of competence, rather than to
any predetermined limit of ability.
The UWP offers some small group
tutorial courses, Nold said, both for
students who have not completed the
writing requirement and for those who
simply want to improve their writing.
A feeling that lecture hall learning
alone is not enough has prompted the
creation of increasingly popular
individualized learning programs at
Stanford, chiefly in the sciences.

an electronic calculator, the center is
working "exceptionally well," Yearian
said, citing the 1400 student visits last
quarter. Its only problem, he said, is
that overcrowding occasionally causes
long waits.

The "Reference Frame" has
become a model for similar
departmental programs, most of which
have been aided in planning and
administration by the new Learning
Assistance Center begun last fall.
The math department's Consulting
Center was initiated autumn quarter
by Prof. Paul Berg, because of "a
long-perceived need — namely that
students weren't really using office
hours as one might hope they would."
Office Hours Inconvenient
Individual office hours aren't
always used well, Berg said, because
they are often inconvenient; a student
frequently needs help in the middle of
a homework assignment, when his
professor or course assistant isn't
available. In addition, Berg said,
students sometimes feel reluctant to
"appear stupid" in front of the
instructor who grades them.
The chemistry department, too, has
set up an information room to give
students an opportunity to "talk
chemistry," according to a department
resume. Formerly students were
hesitant about going into a research
lab to find their TAs, chemistry
lecturer Karen Long said.
The response of course assistants to
these programs is generally good.
"There are sometimes more grad
students than are actually scheduled"
to help students at the "Reference
Frame," Yearian said.
Math graduate student Eric
Isaacson admitted the consulting
center entails more work than office
hours, but, he said, "it's work that I
should be doing. The TA's time, which
the students deserve, is finally being
used by the students."
The chemistry information center,
however, is being used much less now
than in the past two quarters. "There's
a test Friday," course assistant Jeffrey
Richardson said, "and we might have
five students up here." Long
attributed this in part to the
elimination this quarter of chemistry
discussion sessions, which provided an
initial foundation for more interaction
between teaching assistants and
students.
Besides the department-based
programs, the Learning Assistance
Center (LAC) is responsible for other
learning services.
'Dating Bureau'
The LAC office contains a file of
over 150 tutors on all subjects, which
director Mike McHargue compared to
a "dating bureau." The student comes
in, locates a tutor in his subject, and
the two set up their own contract,
which usually pays the tutor $3.50 per
hour.
The Undergraduate Writing
Program (UWP), however, offers free
tutoring in writing. The program's
tutors, director Ellen Nold said, are
mostly "college English teachers who
are out of jobs or are moonlighting."
Not only tutoring programs, but
actual courses geared more than usual
toward the individual, are increasing in
number.
'Mastery Learning'
A math department experiment
called "Scientific Analysis Through

Mathematical Understanding," created
by Prof. Karel deLeeuw and graduate
student Philip Faillace, is based on
"mastery learning." This educational
theory assumes that "aptitude" is
related primarily to the length of time
a student requires to achieve a given
level of competence, rather than to
any predetermined limit of ability.
The UWP offers some small group
tutorial courses, Nold said, both for
students who have not completed the
writing requirement and for those who
simply want to improve their writing.
A feeling that lecture hall learning
alone is not enough has prompted the
creation of increasingly popular
individualized learning programs at
Stanford, chiefly in the sciences.
Tutorial programs have been
established in the physics, math and
chemistry departments to supplement
the student's classroom work as well as
to permit the student to advance on a
more individual basis.
The first such experiment was the
physics department's "Reference
Frame," begun in autumn of 1971 by
Profs. Mason Yearian and Walter
Meyerhof. The "Frame" is a tutorial
and counseling drop-in center for
physics students, especially those in
the introductory courses.
The center, according to Yearian,
replaces teaching assistants' office
hours and makes assistants available
almost continuously in one place from
morning to evening each weekday, for
consultation by phone or in person.
"Students like the idea that there's
somebody there 40 hours a week," he
said.
