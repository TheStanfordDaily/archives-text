## About SCIRE 
### 
When the SCIRE and SWOPSI charges came up for
renewal before the Faculty Senate last quarter, we noted the
educational value of the innovative programs and urged that
they remain at least partially autonomous from the Office of
the Dean of Undergraduate Studies (ODUS).
We opposed measures that would grant the dean
complete authority over both programs because we felt
"placing the programs under total control of a high-ranking
administrator would destroy the central concept of SWOPSI
and SCIRE... two of the most innovative educational
experiments in the nation. You don't improve an
experiment by hopelessly constraining it."
Our fears of domination of both programs by ODUS have
been confirmed by the recent events concerning the
dismissal of SCIRE director Ron Jones.
When the new SCIRE charge came before the Faculty
Senate in January, it was billed as a "compromise proposal"
maintaining enough of the program's autonomy to facilitate
innovation, yet providing a structural link to the University
to avoid misuse of academic credit within the program. We
supported the compromise.
Unfortunately, four months later, it seems that the new
charge is incapable of protecting SCIRE from almost
complete domination by ODUS. While SCIRE was initiated
with broadly-based participatory decision-making on the
part of students and faculty, the new charge clearly transfers
all administrative powers and decisions other than
accredition away from the faculty-student Policy Board to
the Dean of Undergraduate Studies.
Under the program's new charge Dean of Undergraduate
Studies James Gibbs is empowered to dismiss the SCIRE
program director without consultation with the SCIRE
Policy Board. Jones was hired under the old SCIRE charge
which provided that he was answerable only to the Policy
Board and that he culd be rehired by the board should both
Jones and the board find this desirable.
Noting that the Policy Board unanimously voted to
support Jones over the dean's recommendation and that the
board is legally powerless to intervene against the dean's
action, we feel that the original spirit of the charge has been
violated. The students and the faculty have been stripped of
their decision-making power, and SCIRE is in grave danger
of an ODUS takeover.
The rehiring of Ron Jones, it appears, is an issue as
symbolic as it is substantive. Serious questions have been
raised as to Jones' ability to manage SCIRE effectively.
Whether he deserves rehiring remains to be seen. We support
the decision of the Policy Board, which we feel should have
the final say in who runs the program they help to direct.
We urge review of Jones' dismissal by both Provost
William Miller and the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies, bearing in mind the original spirit of the SCIRE
charge. Their decisions will be crucial to the question of who
will ultimately control SCIRE, the dean or the Policy Board.
As in January, we support reasonable institutional
constraints over the program to promote academic quality.
Both the SCIRE and SWOPSI charges, as presently
constituted though, provide for emasculation of the
programs, shortchanging the students of extremely
worthwhile academic experiences.
As former ASSU co-president Brent Appel pointed out,
"Not only does student and faculty control of the program
enhance innovation, but it also gives the program protection
from pressures on the Dean of Undergraduate Studies [by]
interest groups, disgruntled alumni, and external sponsors of
University projects."
In addition, we strongly urge the Faculty Senate to
review the present SCIRE and SWOPSI charges to reinstate
the autonomy of the programs and to restore both the
faculty and student voices in decisions affecting these
programs. We realize, of course, that revision of the charges
is highly unlikely; in fact, it has a snowball's chance in hell.
However, we feel that only revision can restore the original
spirit with which SCIRE and SWOPSI were founded.
Finally, we encourage all students and faculty who have
been associated with SCIRE in the past to write Provost
Miller to urge his careful review of Dean Gibbs'
recommendation.
Immediate action is necessary, lest ODUS's bureaucratic
domination continue creeping over what President Richard
Lyman referred to as "valuable opportunities for intellectual
inquiry," much to the detriment of both SCIRE and
SWOPSI.
