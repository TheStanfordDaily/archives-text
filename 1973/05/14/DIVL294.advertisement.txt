| Fire Chars Trailer Office j
A fire in the lounge area of the Manzanita Trailer Park
office destroyed one sofa, damaged another, and charred a
wall panel at about 3 a.m. Saturday morning.
"There was very little fire damage," commented Stanford
Fire Captain Carl Gamble. According to Gamble, most of the
| damage was caused by the office sprinkler system, which
: extinguished the fire.
: Manzanita Park Director Karen Murray said the damage to
the lounge area carpet was "fairly severe" and the carpet,
along with the two sofas would probably need replacing.
Gamble estimated the total damage at "possibly $1000."
However, Murray stated, "All indications are that the fire
was accidentally caused and there is no reason to believe it was
deliberately set."
