So you've got your college degree. And
with it, enough kisses, head-pats and con
gratulations to last you the rest of your life.
What you need now is a little green
stuff. Money. Or better yet, credit.
That's what we've got for you: credit
and then some-to meet the world head-on.
All wrapped up in a neat package called
Gradplan.
Gradplan can set you up with a credit
line big enough to do the kind of things you
want to do. It'll show you how to get your J - •
checks cashed immediately when they're I | 1 CTI *
needed. How to write yourself an instant X •
loan. And how to take some of the pain out
of finding a job (excuse the expression),
with a really handy new booklet you'll find
right there in the Gradplan package.
Come in. Ask for our special Gradplan
Representative. And get yourself some
credit-plus.
Out there, in the real world, you need
all that you can get.
