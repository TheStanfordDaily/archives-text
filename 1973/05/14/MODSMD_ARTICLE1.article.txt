# McCloskey Reregisters GOP, Won't Desert Sinking Party
## 
### Mark Simonian 
Rep. Paul N. McCloskey
(R-Menlo Park), reversing a move
he initiated in March, reregistered
Friday as a Republican.
He had filled out a
change-of-address registration
form, because he had moved from
his Portola Valley house to his
mother's home in Menlo Park, and
in doing so, switched his party
affiliation from Republican to
"decline to state."
McCloskey indicated then he
was considering running as an
independent, or even dropping
out of politics entirely.
In announcing his decision to
remain a Republican, the
congressman said he did not want
to desert a "sinking" party. "The
greatest political challenge today
is to try to restore faith in the
Republican Party," he said.
No Difference
"There is really no definable
difference between the two major
Parties, and all I can do is to serve
one and try to make it more
honest, make it work, and make it
effective."
His decision, McCloskey added,
was prompted by recent events,
notably in the Watergate affair.
The congressman hailed the
ousters of former Attorney
General John Mitchell, former
Secretary of Commerce Maurice
Stans, and former White house
staffers John Ehrlichman and
H.R. Haldeman.
He praised as "people of
integrity" such newly-promoted
or appointed Republicans as
attorney general-designate Elliot
Richardson, Defense
Secretary-designate James
Schlesinger, acting FBI Director

William Ruckelshaus, and new
presidential counsel Leonard
Garment.
McCloskey also said Congress
must question President Nixon
about the Watergate scandal if the
Justice Department does not.
'Criminal Conduct'
The maverick Republican
stated that there are "potential
areas of criminal conduct on the
part of the President" and Nixon
should be "treated like any other
citizen."
He noted the House of
Representatives is
"constitutionally the only body
that can impeach a President."
"We could very possibly be
faced with the situation under
which the President himself may
be guilty of obstructing justice or
failing to report it when it comes
to his attention, which is a felony.
"The President has said he has
nothing to hide," McCloskey told
the news conference. The
representative from Menlo Park
said it was significant that
Richardson revealed Wednesday
that the White House would not
invoke executive privilege and
refuse to answer to a special
Justice Department prosecutor.
Tough Question
He emphasized nothing has
been proved, but remarked that
Justice Department so far has
failed to ask "the tough question,
which is 'Did the President know
about it or not?' "
Nixon's "Achilles Heel has
always been dirty campaign
tactics and the reliance on large,
secret campaign contributions
from big contributors," said
McCloskey, who challenged Nixon
for the GOP presidential

nomination last year.
Speaking in Redwood City
Friday, McCloskey said he wished
to submit the name of San Mateo
County Dist. Atty. Keith
Sorenson to be the special
prosecutor in the Watergate case.
McCloskey visited Sorenson's
Redwood City office to discuss
the nomination but said the
district attorney was not in.
'Perfect Man'
"He's the perfect man," said
McCloskey of Sorenson, 52. "He's
a Democrat, he's extremely
honest and he has a good record
as a prosecutor."
McCloskey said he thinks
someone from outside a
metropolitan area will be named
as prosecutor, which also would
qualify Sorenson for the post.
Sorenson, who was first elected
district attorney nearly 20 years
ago, has been described by
colleagues as "scrupulously
honest."
