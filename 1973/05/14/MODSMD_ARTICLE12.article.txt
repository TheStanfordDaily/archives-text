# Participation Is Vital
## We Need Women Students 
###

This is an appeal to the women
graduate and undergraduate
students of the Stanford
community to apply now for
service on a University committee
next year. If your first reaction to
such an appeal is "Committee
work? Forget it", please keep
reading anyway. One woman by
her presence or absence can make
all the difference in the present
committee structure at Stanford.
The official University Roster
lists 69 committees, panels, and
commissions with a total of 705
members. At present, of those
705 members, only 94 (or 13
percent) are women — students
(39), faculty (36), and staff (19).
Thirteen of these bodies have no
woman member at all.
As you yourselves are acutely
aware, the number of women on
Stanford's faculty is very small —
only 72 of the 1080 faculty
members are women. One
consequence of this situation is
that it has been impossible in
many cases to find a woman
faculty member to serve on a
committee — in 42 cases, to be

precise. On 14 committees a
woman student is the only woman
member.
The participation of women
students is therefore vital if
women are to have a voice in the
University's policy decisions. And
yet women students are
underrepresented proportionately
in the committee positions
allotted to students. Although
women compose a third of the
total student body, only a fifth,
or 39 of the 172 student
committee members, are women.
If it hadn't been for one
woman graduate student, there
would have been no woman at all
on the Committee on Graduate
Studies when recently it
developed its recommendations
on affirmative action for women
graduate students. (At present the
ratio of men to women in
graduate study is five to one).
If it weren't for one woman
staff member, there would be no
women at all on the Faculty-Staff
Affairs Committee, which is now
reviewing the University's
relationship to the Children's

Center for the Stanford
Community, the only drop-in care
center in the area.
Perhaps you see the
importance of representing the
concerns of women on
committees that deal with
undergraduate admissions and
financial aid (C-UAFA), or
advising (CUS), or part-time and
continuing education (C-AAA),
physical education (C-APER),
financial affairs (AC-ÜBAP), or
CEEWU. But you're still not sure
that the general principle is worth
your own individual and very
valuable time.
From a survey the Committee
on the Education and
Employment of Women
conducted last year, we know the
odds are high that you have
professional ambitions for
yourself. You may plan to be a
scholar, a lawyer, a doctor, a
scientist or engineer. In any case,
you will move out into a world of
work dominated by men, as a
committee structure at Stanford is
dominated by men.
The experience of serving on a

University committee can give
you the opportunity to learn how
to function effectively in that
world — to articulate your ideas
carefully and persuasively, to
develop and use the political
techniques required to accomplish
goals you consider important.
At the same time, by your
presence and activity on a
committee, you will be helping to
change the perceptions of a small
group of men of the role and
importance of women in the
University. If you are active and
effective, your work is additional
evidence that women can and
should be part of the power
structure — that it may be
weakened in other areas by their
absence.
If you want to serve on a
University committee next year,
you should fill out an application
at the ASSU office in Tresidder
immediately.
Your decision does matter. The
deadline for applications is
Friday, May 18.

all the difference in the present
committee structure at Stanford.
The official University Roster
lists 69 committees, panels, and
commissions with a total of 705
members. At present, of those
705 members, only 94 (or 13
percent) are women — students
(39), faculty (36), and staff (19).
Thirteen of these bodies have no
woman member at all.
As you yourselves are acutely
aware, the number of women on
Stanford's faculty is very small —
only 72 of the 1080 faculty
members are women. One
consequence of this situation is
that it has been impossible in
many cases to find a woman
faculty member to serve on a
committee — in 42 cases, to be

precise. On 14 committees a
woman student is the only woman
member.
The participation of women
students is therefore vital if
women are to have a voice in the
University's policy decisions. And
yet women students are
underrepresented proportionately
in the committee positions
allotted to students. Although
women compose a third of the
total student body, only a fifth,
or 39 of the 172 student
committee members, are women.
If it hadn't been for one
woman graduate student, there
would have been no woman at all
on the Committee on Graduate
Studies when recently it
developed its recommendations
on affirmative action for women
graduate students. (At present the
ratio of men to women in
graduate study is five to one).
If it weren't for one woman
staff member, there would be no
women at all on the Faculty-Staff
Affairs Committee, which is now
reviewing the University's
relationship to the Children's

Center for the Stanford
Community, the only drop-in care
center in the area.
Perhaps you see the
importance of representing the
concerns of women on
committees that deal with
undergraduate admissions and
financial aid (C-UAFA), or
advising (CUS), or part-time and
continuing education (C-AAA),
physical education (C-APER),
financial affairs (AC-ÜBAP), or
CEEWU. But you're still not sure
that the general principle is worth
your own individual and very
valuable time.
From a survey the Committee
on the Education and
Employment of Women
conducted last year, we know the
odds are high that you have
professional ambitions for
yourself. You may plan to be a
scholar, a lawyer, a doctor, a
scientist or engineer. In any case,
you will move out into a world of
work dominated by men, as a
committee structure at Stanford is
dominated by men.
The experience of serving on a

University committee can give
you the opportunity to learn how
to function effectively in that
world — to articulate your ideas
carefully and persuasively, to
develop and use the political
techniques required to accomplish
goals you consider important.
At the same time, by your
presence and activity on a
committee, you will be helping to
change the perceptions of a small
group of men of the role and
importance of women in the
University. If you are active and
effective, your work is additional
evidence that women can and
should be part of the power
structure — that it may be
weakened in other areas by their
absence.
If you want to serve on a
University committee next year,
you should fill out an application
at the ASSU office in Tresidder
immediately.
Your decision does matter. The
deadline for applications is
Friday, May 18.
