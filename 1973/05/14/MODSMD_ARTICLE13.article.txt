## Titles That Didn't Make It 
### 
Daniel Brenner

About this time of year. New York
publishing houses wildly promote their spring
titles. Book publishing is a precarious biz and
few of the "First Great Americal Novels" ever
make the inside pages of "Book World."
Biographies are the hula hoop of this season,
followed by flakey novels, follow-the-dots
love manuals, organic cake decorating books,
and how-to books on defending oneself in a
paternity suit.
Each publishing company has its own
characteristic offering. For instance, Dell isn't
about to come out with anything that will
excite New York literati (after all, they are
publishers of Jerry Lewis comic books, among
other tomes). Viking is bound to prove their
sophistication by underplaying the greats so
that they can overplay their new authors. And
Scribners, still raking it in from Great Gatsby
days, can be more audacious, but doesn't dare
take the plunge.
But, what of those manuscripts which
never see the inner reaches of a cloth binding?
It so happens that this very day a wood
nymph wearing no more than a rouge Pixie
Band dropped a stack of works that no New
York publisher choose to touch. She begged
me to print a description of each in the event
some publisher here at Stanford might be
interested. How could I refuse especially when
she offered me the better half of a Hostess
Twinkie?
