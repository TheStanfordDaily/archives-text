# Let Us Put It This Way
## Don't Raffle Our Sisters

Mr. Miller and other men seem
to think that the anger women
feel at seeing another woman
raffled to "the boys" is based on
outraged morality. That is not the
case. The woman's movement,
more than any other in history,
has pushed for the sexual freedom
of women (and men). But sexual
freedom and sexual exploitation
are not the same thing, and that is
the issue here.
Let me put it this way. How
many socialites or sorority girls do
you find doing the "grind" in
burlesque halls or being raffled for
a lay by fraternity boys? Tot
many. The reason is that to
survive comfortably they don't
have to. Most topless dancers,
strippers, etc. are working class
women. If you look at the want
ads in the newspapers you'll find
that about the only jobs that
these women can get that pay as
well as most men's jobs (i.e.
$200+/wk) is as topless waitresses
and dancers.
Remember. According to the
Dept. of Labor most women who
work have to. Well over 6,000,000
are heads of families, and yet
black and white women earn
roughly half of what black and
white men earn. Not enough to
support yourself comfortably,
much less a family.
If, to make a comfortable
living, black people, or brown
people, or any class of people had
to take off their clothes and dance
for the entertainment of white
people, even the most racist men,
even fraternity boys, would say
that was degrading to all of those

people. Then why is it okay for
working women to survive that
way?
For most women, the issue
here is not of "free moral choice,"
but of economic necessity.
Economic exploitation by race,
sex and class is profitable for the
white men who control the money
and run this society. It is an
integral part of an economy based
on private gain. These
exploitations are not issues of
morality, issues of "boorish
behavior," but different faces of a
corrunt and oppressive political
system.
When I was in court this winter
'i prostitute sat down next to me.
She had one child. Her choice was
welfare (s2oo+/mo.), clerical
work ($4OO/mo. minus childcare),
or prostitution, which pays quite
well. As a poor woman she had
the choice of peddling herself to
men, one way or another, or
poverty.
Historically it has been shown
that if freely given a choice, i.e. a
choice independent of economic
need, most women will not peddle
themselves to men for a living.
In the most socialist countries,
such as China and North Vietnam,
where women are paid on the
same scale as men, women don't
choose to be prostitutes or
strippers, or raffled. Those things
are extinct there.
After all, what revolutionary
Vietnamese man who has fought
side by side with a National
Liberation Front woman for a just
and equal society is going to ask
her to dance naked on the table

tops and raffle herself for his
entertainment?
And what socialist woman with
an AK-47 in her hand would put
up with it anyway? Yes, Phi Delts,
you who went along with the
raffle are pigs. Any one who looks
at other humans as livestock to be
looked at and sold for your
pleasure, shows contempt for all
women. Your jeering at one
dancer because she "looks like she
had three kids" makes me sick.
She has done three times as much
as you spoiled frat brats
demanding your gratification.
You remind us too much of
the "nice, American boys" who
have turned "free" South
Vietnam into dance joints and
brothels (for your "harmless fun,"
of course), where Vietnamese
women to support their husbands
and families, "entertain" you.
This is part of what the
national liberation forces in
Vietnam are fighting against. The
revolutionary movement in China,
North Korea and North Vietnam
have begun to end this kind of
economic exploitation of women.
Some day soon, Phi Delts, right
here in your own backyard,
working women, black, brown
women and men, and
revolutionaries are going to begin
putting an end to the exploitation
of may by man, and of woman by
man. By any means necessary,
"brothers."
