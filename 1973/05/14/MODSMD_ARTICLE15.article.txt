A Mind For Sale?
Editor:
As long as we're separating
mind and body, I would like to
say that I don't object to the
possible sale of my body one
tenth as much as I object to the
actual sale of my mind. Every day
I am required to occupy my mind
with things which do not fascinate
me in order to teach a class, write
a paper, eventually to earn the
degree which will allow me to
spend the rest of my life being
required to attend to things which
do not fascinate me. You will no
doubt be quick to suggest: Why
don't you quit? You are not
required to pursue a Ph.D. I
answer: Until this society
supports professional dilettantes
and day-dreamers, I am forced to
sell my mind in order to make a
living. If this is not as great an
injustice as having to sell one's
body in order to earn a living, I do
not know what it is. Where are the
champions of light-heartedness
and light-headedness?

On Page 7 of your May 7
edition you not only libelled and
slandered my client, Donald H.
Tollefson, but you also
demonstrated gross
irresponsibility, incompetence,
malice, stupidity, bad taste and
arrogance. Furthermore, you lied.
You mistakenly claimed that my
client "has contracted a social
disease." The reporter who wrote
the story and numerous other
members of your staff were fully
aware of the fact that Mr.
Tollefson is not suffering from a
social disease, but is laid up with
mononucleosis, which he suffered
only because of putting in many
hard hours working for your
organization.
As a result of your lies, my
client has suffered irreparable
damage. Not only were his
Smokey the Bear Junior Fire
Marshal badge and Dick Tracy
Decoder Ring repossessed, but his
honorary membership in the
Association of Administration
Lackeys has also been cancelled.
Accordingly, I hereby demand
that you retract the lies printed
on May 7 and that as punitive
damages you provide my client
with a lifetime supply of
Budweiser, the beer that made Ed
McMahon famous, two lifetime
passes to the Santa Cruz Beach
and Boardwalk and a lifetime
subscription to "Ms." magazine.
Failure to provide these
damages within one week will
result in the filing of a $2.8
million libel suit against your
paper. Please also realize that my
client is extremely angry and he
has threatened to expose the real
reason why Rich Jaroslovsky
drives a Ford Galaxie if his
damages aren't forthcoming
immediately. Justice shall prevail.

Libel Suit
Editor:
On Page 7 of your May 7
edition you not only libelled and
slandered my client, Donald H.
Tollefson, but you also
demonstrated gross
irresponsibility, incompetence,
malice, stupidity, bad taste and
arrogance. Furthermore, you lied.
You mistakenly claimed that my
client "has contracted a social
disease." The reporter who wrote
the story and numerous other
members of your staff were fully
aware of the fact that Mr.
Tollefson is not suffering from a
social disease, but is laid up with
mononucleosis, which he suffered
only because of putting in many
hard hours working for your
organization.
As a result of your lies, my
client has suffered irreparable
damage. Not only were his
Smokey the Bear Junior Fire
Marshal badge and Dick Tracy
Decoder Ring repossessed, but his
honorary membership in the
Association of Administration
Lackeys has also been cancelled.
Accordingly, I hereby demand
that you retract the lies printed
on May 7 and that as punitive
damages you provide my client
with a lifetime supply of
Budweiser, the beer that made Ed
McMahon famous, two lifetime
passes to the Santa Cruz Beach
and Boardwalk and a lifetime
subscription to "Ms." magazine.
Failure to provide these
damages within one week will
result in the filing of a $2.8
million libel suit against your
paper. Please also realize that my
client is extremely angry and he
has threatened to expose the real
reason why Rich Jaroslovsky
drives a Ford Galaxie if his
damages aren't forthcoming
immediately. Justice shall prevail.

A Mind For Sale?
Editor:
As long as we're separating
mind and body, I would like to
say that I don't object to the
possible sale of my body one
tenth as much as I object to the
actual sale of my mind. Every day
I am required to occupy my mind
with things which do not fascinate
me in order to teach a class, write
a paper, eventually to earn the
degree which will allow me to
spend the rest of my life being
required to attend to things which
do not fascinate me. You will no
doubt be quick to suggest: Why
don't you quit? You are not
required to pursue a Ph.D. I
answer: Until this society
supports professional dilettantes
and day-dreamers, I am forced to
sell my mind in order to make a
living. If this is not as great an
injustice as having to sell one's
body in order to earn a living, I do
not know what it is. Where are the
champions of light-heartedness
and light-headedness?
