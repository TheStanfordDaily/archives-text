# Spring Festival

The second annual Stanford Spring Festival was co-sponsored by
the Bridge and project Synergy last weekend. The purpose of having
the festival, as "Bridge Banana" Hank Levin put it, was to have "a
joyous, creative way of supporting ourselves and celebrating Spring at
Stanford." The event involved the whole Stanford community, and
people from surrounding areas.
Created only last year, the Bridge is a community drop-in,
counseling center. Its primary source of income is the Spring festival.
The Bridge advertised for artisans, craftsmen and entertainers. The
response was so great that many had to be turned away. A total of
over 135 artist stands were set up. Among the most popular items
were candles, hand-made musical instruments, photographs, and
pottery. There were also 15 food stands, 50 entertainment groups and
50 alternative groups sponsored by Project Synergy.
The people at the festival were as heterogeneous as the arts and
crafts they came to see. "Freaks" in costumes and painted faces
browsed side by side with "the all american housewife," while nude
children played in Claw fountain.
Quasar ended the Festival Sunday night with a two hour concert.
