# Doctor Clarifies Kissing Disease Myth

### Dave Tebberson 
Infectious mononucleosis is a
relatively difficult disease to
contract — and once you catch it,
you keep it for a while.
According to Dr. Phillip A.
Gelpi, a physician at Cowell
Student Health Center who treats
three or four cases of mono per
week, mono's nickname — "the
kissing disease" — is based on fact;
the majority of mono patients
contract the disease through
kissing.
Almost every patient reports
recent contact with another
person who was carrying the virus
disease. Thus, Gelpi explains, with
a few exceptions, mono tends to
pass from male to female, female
to male.
Whether or not a person
exposed to the mono virus will
actually contract the disease has
nothing to do with how tired or
"run-down" he is at the time of

contact, Gelpi adds. After a
person is exposed to the virus
whether or not he develops the
symptoms of infectious
mononucleosis is determined by
the amount of virus transmitted,
and by his immunity to the
disease from a previous case of
mono.
The most obvious symptoms of
mono are swollen lymph glands,
fever, and a painful sore throat.
Because there is no specific

medication that cures mono,
Cowell simply treats the disease
symptomatically. Patients
complaining of severe throat pain
stay in the infirmary for several
days and are given a liquid diet
that makes it easier for them to
swallow. Other patients, says
Gelpi, require only aspirin and
rest.
Infectious mononucleosis has
no serious or long-term
side-effects. Very rarely, the

spleen may swell and rupture,
causing a complication.
In recent years the mono virus
has been isolated, and doctors
now believe that the disease has a
long incubation period. This
means that the patient is
potentially infectious months
after he contracts the virus and his
symptoms have disappeared, the
doctor explains.
He points out that in
underdeveloped countries mono
may be passed between small
children, who play in germ-ridden,
crowded areas. Under the hygenic
environmental conditions that
prevail in the United States,
however, infectious
mononucleosis is truly a "kissers'
disease."

ANOTHER BLAZE — Two Stanford firemen extinguish any remaining sparks from the Manzanita Park
office sofa early Saturday morning. Last year, a blaze completely gutted the office, causing $35,000 to
$40,000 damage.
