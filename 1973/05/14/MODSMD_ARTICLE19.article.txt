# Conference Unites Latinos, Chicanas

### Kathy Alcala 
A conference entitled "The
Latin American Woman and the
Chicana — Theory and Practice of
Liberation" brought together 75
Latin American and Chicana
women at the Graduate School of
Business, May 12-13.
Maria Baeza of the Office of
the Dean of the Graduate School
chaired the conference.
Four Latinas and one Chicana
participated in a panel discussion
that opened the conference on
Saturday. Each participant gave
her own view of the study and
solution of the problems shared
by Latin American and Chicana
women.
The experience of Antonia
Castaneda, a University of
Washington professor and
co-editor of an anthology called
Literature Chicana, typified the
contradictions inherent in the
position of many of the women at
the conference. Castaneda
considers herself typical, yet

atypical; she was raised in the
traditional manner by
migrant-worker parents, and yet is
now participating in conferences
and studies rather than submitting
to the traditional housekeeping
role.
Conference workshops
included "The History of the
Chicana," "Political
Consciousness and Community
Action," and "Studying Women
in the Indian Communities of
Latin America." Workshops were
led by women with special
interest in each area.
Other issues raised at the
conference included the different
roles occupied by the Latina, how
class and occupation of women
affects their experiences, and
whether or not North American
researchers, including women,
could overcome the barriers of
culture and upbringing to
interpret the position of the
Latina and the Chicana.
