# Chicano Group Files Complaint
## CLSA Challenges Law School 
### Chess Erwin 
The Chicano Law Students'
Association (CLSA) has filed a
complaint with the Department of
Health, Education, and Welfare in
San Francisco calling for an
investigation of the admissions
policies of the Law School, said
Ralph Arreola, chairman of the
campus CLSA, before a crowd of
75 at a rally Friday in front of the
Law School.
Arreola specified that the
complaint requested a review of
the Law School's positions
concerning affirmative action,
financial aids, as well as the
recruitment and admissions
policies.
Legal action by a coalition of
Chicano groups against the Law
School is also being considered,
added Arreola. He explained that
plans for a suit are still indefinite.
However, if a suit is filed, it will
be directed at the University
program for Affirmative Action,
the use of LSAT admissions data,
and CLSA input into Law School
admissions.
Law School Dean Thomas
Ehrlich was out of town and other
Law School officials had no
immediate comment.
Arreola directed his remarks to
the problems that the CLSA has
had in the last three years. He also
reiterated the CLSA demands that
had been transmitted to Ehrlich
last week.
A memo outlining the areas of
disagreement between the CLSA
and Ehrlich concerning the earlier
CLSA statement has been sent to
the dean's office, Arreola said.
According to the memo, no
agreement has been reached

between the parties concerning
the CLSA demands.
Another area of discord, said
Arreola, is the use of the various
admissions criteria for Chicano
applicants. "Chicanos are often at
a disadvantage with respect to
CPA, for example," commented
Arreola. "We have to balance off
poor grades in the first two years
of college, caused by poor
educational backgrounds with

better ones later on, resulting in a
GPA of 2.7 or 2.8."
In the memo and other
statements and discussions with
Ehrlich, the CLSA has emphasized
that "we are quite willing to use
whatever academic criteria the
school required. We are primarily
interested in having other criteria,
such as committment, considered
as well."
Arreola noted that some

Spanish-surname applicants are
admitted who lack a commitment
to the Chicano community. "We
want the Law School to consider
deserving people and not give
special consideration to those
with minority names."
In asking for the right to send
30 letters of acceptance to
Chicano applicants, the memo
added that "at no time did we
mean to imply that we challenged
the faculty's power to determine
the academic criteria or make the
final decisions ... 30 acceptances
will generally yield less than 15
students."
The memo also repeated the
CLSA request for a ceiling on the
loan burden of individual
students. The suggested limit was
$15,000 or 50 percent of the

student's total need.
"There are only one and a half
Chicano employees on a staff of
120 in the Law School and only
four Chicano Law School
graduates," said Arreola. The
CLSA statement attributed this
not to a lack of qualified Chicanos
but rather to a small applicant
pool that "was due to a lack of
active effort by the Law School to
recruit minorities."

special consideration to those
with minority names."
In asking for the right to send
30 letters of acceptance to
Chicano applicants, the memo
added that "at no time did we
mean to imply that we challenged
the faculty's power to determine
the academic criteria or make the
final decisions ... 30 acceptances
will generally yield less than 15
students."
The memo also repeated the
CLSA request for a ceiling on the
loan burden of individual
students. The suggested limit was
$15,000 or 50 percent of the

student's total need.
"There are only one and a half
Chicano employees on a staff of
120 in the Law School and only
four Chicano Law School
graduates," said Arreola. The
CLSA statement attributed this
not to a lack of qualified Chicanos
but rather to a small applicant
pool that "was due to a lack of
active effort by the Law School to
recruit minorities."
The Chicano Law Students'
Association (CLSA) has filed a
complaint with the Department of
Health, Education, and Welfare in
San Francisco calling for an
investigation of the admissions
policies of the Law School, said
Ralph Arreola, chairman of the
campus CLSA, before a crowd of
75 at a rally Friday in front of the
Law School.
Arreola specified that the
complaint requested a review of
the Law School's positions
concerning affirmative action,
financial aids, as well as the
recruitment and admissions
policies.
Legal action by a coalition of
Chicano groups against the Law
School is also being considered,
added Arreola. He explained that
plans for a suit are still indefinite.
However, if a suit is filed, it will
be directed at the University
program for Affirmative Action,
the use of LSAT admissions data,
and CLSA input into Law School
admissions.
Law School Dean Thomas
Ehrlich was out of town and other
Law School officials had no
immediate comment.
Arreola directed his remarks to
the problems that the CLSA has
had in the last three years. He also
reiterated the CLSA demands that
had been transmitted to Ehrlich
last week.
A memo outlining the areas of
disagreement between the CLSA
and Ehrlich concerning the earlier
CLSA statement has been sent to
the dean's office, Arreola said.
According to the memo, no
agreement has been reached

between the parties concerning
the CLSA demands.
Another area of discord, said
Arreola, is the use of the various
admissions criteria for Chicano
applicants. "Chicanos are often at
a disadvantage with respect to
CPA, for example," commented
Arreola. "We have to balance off
poor grades in the first two years
of college, caused by poor
educational backgrounds with

better ones later on, resulting in a
GPA of 2.7 or 2.8."
In the memo and other
statements and discussions with
Ehrlich, the CLSA has emphasized
that "we are quite willing to use
whatever academic criteria the
school required. We are primarily
interested in having other criteria,
such as committment, considered
as well."
Arreola noted that some

Spanish-surname applicants are
admitted who lack a commitment
to the Chicano community. "We
want the Law School to consider
deserving people and not give
special consideration to those
with minority names."
