# Whites Outplay Reds: 14-8
## Defense Shines In Spring Game 
### Mark White 
A contest that has traditionally
v,en a passing duel between
tarttfrbacks became a show of
/tensive strength Saturday as the
<&i'tes outplayed the Reds 14-8 in
annual Red-White game that
i+ninates four weeks of spring
Q'Mball.
Tn the past five years Jim
' aukett, Don Bunce, Dave
: mar and Mike Boryla propelled
teams to combined scores of
6?re than 40 points in the annual
•jitest. But Saturday defensive
cktes Pete Hanson, Tom Ryska
■yi Drew Palin anchored
i'cnsive units that held their
u'farisive counterparts to the
output in years.
v t can't say that I was pleased
discouraged with the game"
head coach Jack Christiansen,
•/firing practice is that part of the
where you look at
idViduals, where you evaluate
• bur personnel. Now if your first
i'fi&se couldn't handle your third
■ fittse, then we would be
>£ried, but these teams were
-Hi'y evenly balanced and the
-ftilt was a close contest."
L Reds Take Boryla
In the draft held by the
staff to determine the
of the two teams, the Reds
no up with offensive stars Mike
/ and John Winesberry and a
j.• ii balanced defensive squad
/ijffered around defensive

linemen Roger Stillwell, Joe
Martin and Pete Hanson. The
young White squad countered
with a crack defensive secondary
headed by Randy Poltl (who
along with Boryla, was in Chicago
Sunday being honored as one of
Playboy Magazine's All-American
football selections) and a strong
corps of receivers, headed by Glen
Stone and Bill Singler.
In the end, however, the
overall strength and depth of both
defensive teams prevailed over
offensive squads that were not
used to playing together and were
short on experience.
"There is no doubt that we are
going to have a real strong defense
this year" said offensive line
coach Hudson Houck. "The
deepest part of the team is in the
linebacking and right now the
down four looks very strong. The
weakness is in the offensive line
presently, not because of attitude,
but because of inexperience. We
have a lot of junior college
transfers and freshmen who just
have not played that much."
Goldstein Interception
Max Goldstein gave the Reds
the first break of the game when
he intercepted a pass and ran it
back to the White's 21 yard line at
7:55 in the first quarter. Seconds
later Boryla lofted a pass that just
went off of Reggie Ishman's
fingertips in the right corner of
the endzone. An attempted field
goal subsequently failed when the
holder fumbled the center's snap.
Neither team could move the
ball steadily until the second
quarter when freshman Jerry
Waldvogel marched the Whites 66
yards for the longest drive of the
contest and the game's first score.
Using a combination of short
passes, inside handoffs to his
backs and quarterback keepers,
Waldvogel kept the Red defense
honest and brought his team
inside the Red ten yard line.

Red resistance stiffened,
however, and Rod Garcia came in
to attempt a field goal. The
attempt was good, but the Reds
were caught offside, and the
Whites got the ball first and goal
on the Red three. Waldvogel then
handed off to his teammate from
last year's frosh squad, David
Tenn, who scored on a blast to
the left. Garcia's kick made it 7-0
with 8:14 to go in the quarter.
Second Score
Three minutes later Palin, who
was named outstanding defensive
player of the game for his 10
tackles and tough line plays,
recovered a Winesberry fumble on
the Red 38.
With the Whites in possession,
Joe Baumgaertner's fine run
brought up third and inches on
the 28. In the deftest play of the
day, Waldvogel faked a handoff
up the middle and hit the
streaking Stone with a perfectly
executed touchdown pass.
Garcia's second PAT made it 14-0
Whites.
"We were in the huddle on
third down when I looked over
my shoulder and noticed the Red
defense had already broken for
the play and were in a goal line
defense," explained Waldvogel.
"Since they were expecting the
run I decided to gamble and go
for the touchdown. Our receivers
were so open I could have hit any
one of them."
Interceptions and punts
dominated play through the rest
of the second and third quarters
as neither team could generate
prolonged drives. Then midway in
the fourth quarter Doc Blanchard
nabbed his third interception of
the day and ran it back 22 yards
to the White's 23 yard line.
Reds Score
Jeff Siemens, who had replaced
Boryla in the third period, came
in and directed the Reds to their
only score of the game. Two runs
by Winesberry and one by

Laidlaw set up a third and goal on
the three from where Winesberry
scored. Siemens then galloped
around right end for the two
point conversion to close out the
scoring, 14-8.
"We had a good spring,"
summarized coach Christiansen.
"Today we looked at our
offensive linemen and with some
work, we'll have several people
capable of playing good offensive
line. The main thing is in the
receiving. While we would prefer
to keep him in the backfield
where we can get the ball to him,
we may have to play Winesberry
at flanker some."
"We are looking forward to the
start of the regular season. The
players would prefer to open with
a strong team and Penn State is
one of the best. The rematch with
Michigan the following weekend
will be good. It's a season we look
forward to."

L Reds Take Boryla
In the draft held by the
staff to determine the
of the two teams, the Reds
no up with offensive stars Mike
/ and John Winesberry and a
j.• ii balanced defensive squad
/ijffered around defensive

linemen Roger Stillwell, Joe
Martin and Pete Hanson. The
young White squad countered
with a crack defensive secondary
headed by Randy Poltl (who
along with Boryla, was in Chicago
Sunday being honored as one of
Playboy Magazine's All-American
football selections) and a strong
corps of receivers, headed by Glen
Stone and Bill Singler.
In the end, however, the
overall strength and depth of both
defensive teams prevailed over
offensive squads that were not
used to playing together and were
short on experience.
"There is no doubt that we are
going to have a real strong defense
this year" said offensive line
coach Hudson Houck. "The
deepest part of the team is in the
linebacking and right now the
down four looks very strong. The
weakness is in the offensive line
presently, not because of attitude,
but because of inexperience. We
have a lot of junior college
transfers and freshmen who just
have not played that much."
Goldstein Interception
Max Goldstein gave the Reds
the first break of the game when
he intercepted a pass and ran it
back to the White's 21 yard line at
7:55 in the first quarter. Seconds
later Boryla lofted a pass that just
went off of Reggie Ishman's
fingertips in the right corner of
the endzone. An attempted field
goal subsequently failed when the
holder fumbled the center's snap.
Neither team could move the
ball steadily until the second
quarter when freshman Jerry
Waldvogel marched the Whites 66
yards for the longest drive of the
contest and the game's first score.
Using a combination of short
passes, inside handoffs to his
backs and quarterback keepers,
Waldvogel kept the Red defense
honest and brought his team
inside the Red ten yard line.

Red resistance stiffened,
however, and Rod Garcia came in
to attempt a field goal. The
attempt was good, but the Reds
were caught offside, and the
Whites got the ball first and goal
on the Red three. Waldvogel then
handed off to his teammate from
last year's frosh squad, David
Tenn, who scored on a blast to
the left. Garcia's kick made it 7-0
with 8:14 to go in the quarter.
Second Score
Three minutes later Palin, who
was named outstanding defensive
player of the game for his 10
tackles and tough line plays,
recovered a Winesberry fumble on
the Red 38.
With the Whites in possession,
Joe Baumgaertner's fine run
brought up third and inches on
the 28. In the deftest play of the
day, Waldvogel faked a handoff
up the middle and hit the
streaking Stone with a perfectly
executed touchdown pass.
Garcia's second PAT made it 14-0
Whites.
"We were in the huddle on
third down when I looked over
my shoulder and noticed the Red
defense had already broken for
the play and were in a goal line
defense," explained Waldvogel.
"Since they were expecting the
run I decided to gamble and go
for the touchdown. Our receivers
were so open I could have hit any
one of them."
Interceptions and punts
dominated play through the rest
of the second and third quarters
as neither team could generate
prolonged drives. Then midway in
the fourth quarter Doc Blanchard
nabbed his third interception of
the day and ran it back 22 yards
to the White's 23 yard line.
Reds Score
Jeff Siemens, who had replaced
Boryla in the third period, came
in and directed the Reds to their
only score of the game. Two runs
by Winesberry and one by

Laidlaw set up a third and goal on
the three from where Winesberry
scored. Siemens then galloped
around right end for the two
point conversion to close out the
scoring, 14-8.
"We had a good spring,"
summarized coach Christiansen.
"Today we looked at our
offensive linemen and with some
work, we'll have several people
capable of playing good offensive
line. The main thing is in the
receiving. While we would prefer
to keep him in the backfield
where we can get the ball to him,
we may have to play Winesberry
at flanker some."
"We are looking forward to the
start of the regular season. The
players would prefer to open with
a strong team and Penn State is
one of the best. The rematch with
Michigan the following weekend
will be good. It's a season we look

L Reds Take Boryla
In the draft held by the
staff to determine the
of the two teams, the Reds
no up with offensive stars Mike
/ and John Winesberry and a
j.• ii balanced defensive squad
/ijffered around defensive

linemen Roger Stillwell, Joe
Martin and Pete Hanson. The
young White squad countered
with a crack defensive secondary
headed by Randy Poltl (who
along with Boryla, was in Chicago
Sunday being honored as one of
Playboy Magazine's All-American
football selections) and a strong
corps of receivers, headed by Glen
Stone and Bill Singler.
In the end, however, the
overall strength and depth of both
defensive teams prevailed over
offensive squads that were not
used to playing together and were
short on experience.
"There is no doubt that we are
going to have a real strong defense
this year" said offensive line
coach Hudson Houck. "The
deepest part of the team is in the
linebacking and right now the
down four looks very strong. The
weakness is in the offensive line
presently, not because of attitude,
but because of inexperience. We
have a lot of junior college
transfers and freshmen who just
have not played that much."
Goldstein Interception
Max Goldstein gave the Reds
the first break of the game when
he intercepted a pass and ran it
back to the White's 21 yard line at
7:55 in the first quarter. Seconds
later Boryla lofted a pass that just
went off of Reggie Ishman's
fingertips in the right corner of
the endzone. An attempted field
goal subsequently failed when the
holder fumbled the center's snap.
Neither team could move the
ball steadily until the second
quarter when freshman Jerry
Waldvogel marched the Whites 66
yards for the longest drive of the
contest and the game's first score.
Using a combination of short
passes, inside handoffs to his
backs and quarterback keepers,
Waldvogel kept the Red defense
honest and brought his team
inside the Red ten yard line.

Red resistance stiffened,
however, and Rod Garcia came in
to attempt a field goal. The
attempt was good, but the Reds
were caught offside, and the
Whites got the ball first and goal
on the Red three. Waldvogel then
handed off to his teammate from
last year's frosh squad, David
Tenn, who scored on a blast to
the left. Garcia's kick made it 7-0
with 8:14 to go in the quarter.
Second Score
Three minutes later Palin, who
was named outstanding defensive
player of the game for his 10
tackles and tough line plays,
recovered a Winesberry fumble on
the Red 38.
With the Whites in possession,
Joe Baumgaertner's fine run
brought up third and inches on
the 28. In the deftest play of the
day, Waldvogel faked a handoff
up the middle and hit the
streaking Stone with a perfectly
executed touchdown pass.
Garcia's second PAT made it 14-0
Whites.
"We were in the huddle on
third down when I looked over
my shoulder and noticed the Red
defense had already broken for
the play and were in a goal line
defense," explained Waldvogel.
"Since they were expecting the
run I decided to gamble and go
for the touchdown. Our receivers
were so open I could have hit any
one of them."
Interceptions and punts
dominated play through the rest
of the second and third quarters
as neither team could generate
prolonged drives. Then midway in
the fourth quarter Doc Blanchard
nabbed his third interception of
the day and ran it back 22 yards
to the White's 23 yard line.
Reds Score
Jeff Siemens, who had replaced
Boryla in the third period, came
in and directed the Reds to their
only score of the game. Two runs
by Winesberry and one by

Laidlaw set up a third and goal on
the three from where Winesberry
scored. Siemens then galloped
around right end for the two
point conversion to close out the
scoring, 14-8.
"We had a good spring,"
summarized coach Christiansen.
"Today we looked at our
offensive linemen and with some
work, we'll have several people
capable of playing good offensive
line. The main thing is in the
receiving. While we would prefer
to keep him in the backfield
where we can get the ball to him,
we may have to play Winesberry
at flanker some."
"We are looking forward to the
start of the regular season. The
players would prefer to open with
a strong team and Penn State is
one of the best. The rematch with
Michigan the following weekend
will be good. It's a season we look
forward to."
