# Cards Second: 14 Shots Back
## Trojans Win Southern Division Golf 
### Dave Robinson 
USC used a strong final round
performance to turn the first
annual Pacific Eight Southern
Division golf tournament into a
runaway, coasting to an easy 14
shot victory over three other
teams Saturday on the Stanford
course.
The Trojans led Stanford by
only two shots after Friday's
opening 36 holes, but USC's top
four players carded rounds of 67,
70, 70, and 76 in Saturday's final
round, leaving the Cards a distant
second at 881, 14 shots behind
USC's winning 867 total. UCLA
was third at 887 and California
fourth at 916.
USC's victory, its fifth major
tournament title of the year,
establishes the Trojans as clear-cut
favorites in the Pacific Eight
tournament, which begins today
in Clarkston, Wash. The eight
conference teams will play 36
holes today and 36 tomorrow in
the grueling 72 hole tourney.
The clear-cut favorite in the
Pac-8 individual competition has
to be USC's Craig Stadler, who
fired rounds of 66-76-70 for a 212
total and a four shot victory in
this weekend's Southern Division
event.
"I've been playing well for
about a month now," Stadler said
afterward, but it would probably
be more correct to say that
Stadler has played well ever since
the day he swung his first five
iron. The talented sophomore,

who won the Junior World title in
1969, now has five major
collegiate victories to his credit in
1973 and is on his way to almost
certain first team All-American
recognition.
May Challenge Crenshaw
"Stadler is the most impressive
golfer I've ever played with," said
Stanford's Dave Baskins, who tied
for second with USC's Don Baker,
four shots behind Stadler. "Ben
Crenshaw [two-time NCAA
champion from Texas] is going to
have to do some playing to beat
Craig for a third NCAA
championship."
Everyone knew before the
tournament started that Stadler
was good, but after Friday's
opening 18 holes some observers
were wondering if he was human.
Stadler tamed the tough Stanford
layout with a brilliant three under
par 66 (the course normally plays

to a par of 71 but the 15th and
16th holes were shortened
because a portion of those
fairways is being reseeded after a
waterline was replaced) to take a
six shot lead over the rest of the
field.
But in the afternoon round
Stadler's individual lead dwindled
to one and the Trojans' 12 shot
team advantage shrunk to two.
Stadler skied to a 76 while
Stanford was playing its best golf
of the tournament (Conrad
Nilmeier shot 69, Baskins shot 71,
and Denny Colvin and Aly
Trompas each carded 73's).
Saturday, however, the Trojans
asserted themselves early and the
Cards never seriously threatened.
Baskins, who had trailed Stadler
by just one shot going into the
round, lost a ball on the seventh
hole, making a costly double
bogey on the easiest birdie hole

on the course.
Haney Comes Back
Meanwhile USC played
excellent golf throughout the final
18 holes. Stadler coasted home
with a 70, Mike Haney carded a
67 after earlier rounds of 79-71 to
finish fourth, Baker shot 70, and
Mark Pfeil shot 76.
Stanford's final individual
scores were: Baskins (72-71-73,
216), Trompas (74-73-73, 220),
John Beers (77-74-71, 222),
Nilmeier (77-69-77, 223), Colvin
(77-73-73, 223), and George
Pettinger (78-74-78, 230).
Cardinal coach Bud Finger was
disappointed with his team's
performance, but acknowledged
that USC is one of the nation's
top teams. "USC has a fine team,"
he said. "If they put it all
together, they're gonna beat
anybody."
