# Mayer Wins Cal State Title
## 
### Viae Kershner 
Sandy Mayer has surprised the
"experts" who seeded him sixth
in the California State Tennis
Championships by winning the
tournament.
Mayer, who has now won the
Cal State title two years in a row,
beat South African pro Ray
Moore 6-4, 7-5, 3-6, 6-3 in
yesterday's final at the Alpine

Hills Tennis Club 'u Portola
Valley.
Mayer's defeat of the
second-seeded Moore was not as
surprising as his 6-4, 6-4 win over
first-seeded Dick Crealy Saturday.
In that match, Mayer played
steadily, winning early service
breaks in both sets from the
Australian pro.
Previously, on Friday, Mayer,
who was the lone Stanford player
to reach the quarterfinals, topped
Dick Bohrnstedt of Redlands, 6-4,
7-6.
Thus, it looks like the junior,
after a minor slump of a few
months, is ready to take on the
challenge of this week's Pac-8

championship at USC.
In doubles, Mayer teamed with
Delaney to reach the finals.
Friday, Mayer-Delaney beat F.D.
Robbins-Richard Russen 7-6, 7-5.
In Saturday's semifinals, the
Stanford duo, which has played
together for only a month, beat
Dick Dell-Sherwood Stewart 3-6,
6-3, 6-2 in a minor upset.
The pair finally lost in the
finals to Tom Edelfsen-Tom
Leonard 6-3, 3-6, 6-2.
The Cal State singles
championship carries with it a
$2,000 prize and qualification
into the rich Alan King tourney in
Las Vegas. However, due to his
amateur standing, Mayer will be
able to accept neither prize.
