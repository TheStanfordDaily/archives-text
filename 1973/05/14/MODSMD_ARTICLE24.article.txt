# Cards Sweep Cal, Finish Second
## 
### S. Stanford Dailey 
Cal's Steve Bartkowski swung
his bat three times and swung his
fists a few more times than that,
but he couldn't keep Stanford
from taking both ends of a
doubleheader at Sunken Diamond
oaturday to sweep the final series
of the season and finish second in
the Pac-8 Southern Division.
The series win, coupled with
USC's three game sweep of
UCLA, sent the Cardinals racing
into second place behind USC,
and dropped the Bears into the
cellar. Stanford finished the Pac-8
season at 9-9 for the second year
in a row. Cal slid to 6-9 in the
conference.
The Cards rallied behind the
five-hit pitching of Dave Frost in
the first game, getting a two-run
homer from Bob Hampton in the
bottom of the first, winning , 5-2.
Hampton cracked a two-run
double in the second game to help
the Cards to a 6-3,
come-from-behind victory.
Bob DiPietro hurled a five-hit
shutout in Friday's series opener
in Berkeley. DiPietro struck out
eight, setting down the Bears, 4-0.
Saturday, Bartkowski staked
the bears to a 2-0 lead in the top
of the first with the first of two
home runs, but he got more
attention after the second game
when he stalked three Stanford
fans and started swinging.
Fans Bothering Bartkowski
The three fans had been
taunting Bartkowski during the
doubleheader, shouting, "We want
Ferragamo" (Cal's freshman
quarterback who won the starting
position from Bartkowski last fall)
and other slogans which an
onlooker said were "a lot meaner
than that."
All three of the fans were
Stanford students. According to
Kurt Peterson, one of the students
involved in the entanglement, an
unidentified man and a woman
pointed out the three to
Bartkowski after the second game
and told him that they were the
three who were shouting at him.
Bartkowski went into the
stands and started swinging at the
three, aided by Cal catcher Claude
Westmoreland, according to
Peterson. Peterson, who is 6'3"
and weighs 190 pounds, said no
one was seriously injured by the
6'4", 215-pound Bartkowski.
Peterson also said that the woman
was swinging a bat at some of the
fans.
'Asinine'
When reached for comment,
Stanford Athletic Director Joseph
H. Ruetz acknowledged it was the
first he had heard of the incident,
but said, "I think it's asinine for

people to be yelling things like
that, and I think it's equally
asinine for someone to take that
kind of thing personally."
Ruetz said he would definitely
look into the matter.
Not all the swinging was in the
stands, though. During the games
it was confined to the field, and
the only recipients of a clout from
a Hillerich & Bradsby were
baseballs.
Cards Rally
Trailing 2-1 in the seventh
inning of the second game,
Cardinal hitters unleashed a
barrage at Cal starter Juan
Eichelberger. Steve Davis led off

with a walk, charging to second
when ball four sailed to the
backstop. Kim Hannaford tied the
score at two apiece with a single
off Eichelberger's first delivery.
Reliever and winner Nick
Peterson, who had come in for
starting pitcher A 1 Arthur in the
top of the inning, laced into the
next pitch Eichelberger threw for
a single that sent Hannaford to
third. After Gary Bei struck out,
catcher Dave Baker was hit by a
pitch, putting men on first and
third with Bob Hampton at the
plate.
Hampton tore into an

Eichelberger delivery for a double
that scored Peterson and Baker.
Cal had taken a 2-1 lead in the
fourth when Bartkowski slammed
his second home run of the day
and his twelfth of the season
somewhere into the Spring
Festival in White Plaza.
Bartkowski's first home run
came in the first inning of the
opening game off a Frost fastball.
Stanford centerfielder Bob
Hampton knotted the score in the
bottom of the inning when he
drove a two-and-two pitch from
Joe Serena over the 375-ft. sign in
left center, with Mark Lucich
aboard.
Frost, who picked up his sixth
win against no losses, held Cal
scoreless the rest of the way while
the Cards two runs in the fifth
and a single run in the sixth.
Hannaford led off the fifth with a
single, stole second, and scored on
Gary Bei's one-out single. Bei
scored from first when Lucich
nailed Serena's first pitch for a
single.

year against Cal in the first game of Saturday's doubleheader with the
Bears. Frost, who was unbeaten this season, struck out six and walked

Nick Peterson, who finished at 7-2 for the year, picking up the win in
relief.

LARCENY — Second baseman Kim Hannaford steals second during the fifth inning of Saturday's first
game with Cal. Hannaford, who scored on Gary Bei's single, had four hits in seven trips to the plate for
the two games.
Cal's Steve Bartkowski swung
his bat three times and swung his
fists a few more times than that,
but he couldn't keep Stanford
from taking both ends of a
doubleheader at Sunken Diamond
oaturday to sweep the final series
of the season and finish second in
the Pac-8 Southern Division.
The series win, coupled with
USC's three game sweep of
UCLA, sent the Cardinals racing
into second place behind USC,
and dropped the Bears into the
cellar. Stanford finished the Pac-8
season at 9-9 for the second year
in a row. Cal slid to 6-9 in the
conference.
The Cards rallied behind the
five-hit pitching of Dave Frost in
the first game, getting a two-run
homer from Bob Hampton in the
bottom of the first, winning , 5-2.
Hampton cracked a two-run
double in the second game to help
the Cards to a 6-3,
come-from-behind victory.
Bob DiPietro hurled a five-hit
shutout in Friday's series opener
in Berkeley. DiPietro struck out
eight, setting down the Bears, 4-0.
Saturday, Bartkowski staked
the bears to a 2-0 lead in the top
of the first with the first of two
home runs, but he got more
attention after the second game
when he stalked three Stanford
fans and started swinging.
Fans Bothering Bartkowski
The three fans had been
taunting Bartkowski during the
doubleheader, shouting, "We want
Ferragamo" (Cal's freshman
quarterback who won the starting
position from Bartkowski last fall)
and other slogans which an
onlooker said were "a lot meaner
than that."
All three of the fans were
Stanford students. According to
Kurt Peterson, one of the students
involved in the entanglement, an
unidentified man and a woman
pointed out the three to
Bartkowski after the second game
and told him that they were the
three who were shouting at him.
Bartkowski went into the
stands and started swinging at the
three, aided by Cal catcher Claude
Westmoreland, according to
Peterson. Peterson, who is 6'3"
and weighs 190 pounds, said no
one was seriously injured by the
6'4", 215-pound Bartkowski.
Peterson also said that the woman
was swinging a bat at some of the
fans.
'Asinine'
When reached for comment,
Stanford Athletic Director Joseph
H. Ruetz acknowledged it was the
first he had heard of the incident,
but said, "I think it's asinine for

people to be yelling things like
that, and I think it's equally
asinine for someone to take that
kind of thing personally."
Ruetz said he would definitely
look into the matter.
Not all the swinging was in the
stands, though. During the games
it was confined to the field, and
the only recipients of a clout from
a Hillerich & Bradsby were
baseballs.
Cards Rally
Trailing 2-1 in the seventh
inning of the second game,
Cardinal hitters unleashed a
barrage at Cal starter Juan
Eichelberger. Steve Davis led off

with a walk, charging to second
when ball four sailed to the
backstop. Kim Hannaford tied the
score at two apiece with a single
off Eichelberger's first delivery.
Reliever and winner Nick
Peterson, who had come in for
starting pitcher A 1 Arthur in the
top of the inning, laced into the
next pitch Eichelberger threw for
a single that sent Hannaford to
third. After Gary Bei struck out,
catcher Dave Baker was hit by a
pitch, putting men on first and
third with Bob Hampton at the
plate.
Hampton tore into an

Eichelberger delivery for a double
that scored Peterson and Baker.
Cal had taken a 2-1 lead in the
fourth when Bartkowski slammed
his second home run of the day
and his twelfth of the season
somewhere into the Spring
Festival in White Plaza.
Bartkowski's first home run
came in the first inning of the
opening game off a Frost fastball.
Stanford centerfielder Bob
Hampton knotted the score in the
bottom of the inning when he
drove a two-and-two pitch from
Joe Serena over the 375-ft. sign in
left center, with Mark Lucich
aboard.
Frost, who picked up his sixth
win against no losses, held Cal
scoreless the rest of the way while
the Cards two runs in the fifth
and a single run in the sixth.
Hannaford led off the fifth with a
single, stole second, and scored on
Gary Bei's one-out single. Bei
scored from first when Lucich
nailed Serena's first pitch for a
single.

UNDEFEATED SEASON — Dave Frost hurled his sixth win of the
year against Cal in the first game of Saturday's doubleheader with the
Bears. Frost, who was unbeaten this season, struck out six and walked
two, as Stanford won, 5-2. The Cards took the second game, 6-3, with
Nick Peterson, who finished at 7-2 for the year, picking up the win in
relief.

LARCENY — Second baseman Kim Hannaford steals second during the fifth inning of Saturday's first
game with Cal. Hannaford, who scored on Gary Bei's single, had four hits in seven trips to the plate for
the two games.
Cal's Steve Bartkowski swung
his bat three times and swung his
fists a few more times than that,
but he couldn't keep Stanford
from taking both ends of a
doubleheader at Sunken Diamond
oaturday to sweep the final series
of the season and finish second in
the Pac-8 Southern Division.
The series win, coupled with
USC's three game sweep of
UCLA, sent the Cardinals racing
into second place behind USC,
and dropped the Bears into the
cellar. Stanford finished the Pac-8
season at 9-9 for the second year
in a row. Cal slid to 6-9 in the
conference.
The Cards rallied behind the
five-hit pitching of Dave Frost in
the first game, getting a two-run
homer from Bob Hampton in the
bottom of the first, winning , 5-2.
Hampton cracked a two-run
double in the second game to help
the Cards to a 6-3,
come-from-behind victory.
Bob DiPietro hurled a five-hit
shutout in Friday's series opener
in Berkeley. DiPietro struck out
eight, setting down the Bears, 4-0.
Saturday, Bartkowski staked
the bears to a 2-0 lead in the top
of the first with the first of two
home runs, but he got more
attention after the second game
when he stalked three Stanford
fans and started swinging.
Fans Bothering Bartkowski
The three fans had been
taunting Bartkowski during the
doubleheader, shouting, "We want
Ferragamo" (Cal's freshman
quarterback who won the starting
position from Bartkowski last fall)
and other slogans which an
onlooker said were "a lot meaner
than that."
All three of the fans were
Stanford students. According to
Kurt Peterson, one of the students
involved in the entanglement, an
unidentified man and a woman
pointed out the three to
Bartkowski after the second game
and told him that they were the
three who were shouting at him.
Bartkowski went into the
stands and started swinging at the
three, aided by Cal catcher Claude
Westmoreland, according to
Peterson. Peterson, who is 6'3"
and weighs 190 pounds, said no
one was seriously injured by the
6'4", 215-pound Bartkowski.
Peterson also said that the woman
was swinging a bat at some of the
fans.
'Asinine'
When reached for comment,
Stanford Athletic Director Joseph
H. Ruetz acknowledged it was the
first he had heard of the incident,
but said, "I think it's asinine for

people to be yelling things like
that, and I think it's equally
asinine for someone to take that
kind of thing personally."
Ruetz said he would definitely
look into the matter.
Not all the swinging was in the
stands, though. During the games
it was confined to the field, and
the only recipients of a clout from
a Hillerich & Bradsby were
baseballs.
Cards Rally
Trailing 2-1 in the seventh
inning of the second game,
Cardinal hitters unleashed a
barrage at Cal starter Juan
Eichelberger. Steve Davis led off

with a walk, charging to second
when ball four sailed to the
backstop. Kim Hannaford tied the
score at two apiece with a single
off Eichelberger's first delivery.
Reliever and winner Nick
Peterson, who had come in for
starting pitcher A 1 Arthur in the
top of the inning, laced into the
next pitch Eichelberger threw for
a single that sent Hannaford to
third. After Gary Bei struck out,
catcher Dave Baker was hit by a
pitch, putting men on first and
third with Bob Hampton at the
plate.
Hampton tore into an

Eichelberger delivery for a double
that scored Peterson and Baker.
Cal had taken a 2-1 lead in the
fourth when Bartkowski slammed
his second home run of the day
and his twelfth of the season
somewhere into the Spring
Festival in White Plaza.
Bartkowski's first home run
came in the first inning of the
opening game off a Frost fastball.
Stanford centerfielder Bob
Hampton knotted the score in the
bottom of the inning when he
drove a two-and-two pitch from
Joe Serena over the 375-ft. sign in
left center, with Mark Lucich
aboard.
Frost, who picked up his sixth
win against no losses, held Cal
