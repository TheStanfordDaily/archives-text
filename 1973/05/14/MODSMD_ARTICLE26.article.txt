# Dave Baker Has Fun Behind The Plate

"We got two down out there
red, c'mon Ken buddy, get one in
there ...."
This past year, Stanford
baseball fans have gotten used to
the stream of chatter mouthed by
freshman catcher Dave Baker.
"My idea of playing ball is to
go out and have fun," Baker says.
"Some guys think they're so
sophisticated or intellectual it's
below them to have a good time.
"I'm past the point of caring
about people who don't like me
because I have a 'jock' image. If I
go out and yell real loud that's the
way I am; that's the fun of the
game for me," Baker adds.
"I really enjoy baseball. I've
been playing since I was nine and
I've never gotten tired of it.
"Our family revolves around
sports. When I was catching in
high school, I had one brother

pitching and another in Jeft field,"
Baker says.
At San Leandro's Pacific High
School in the East Bay, Baker not
only caught but played
quarterback well enough to be
voted into the Northern California
chapter of the National Football
Hall of Fame.
Thus, last year he had the
choice of signing with the Los
Angeles Dodgers baseball team for
a large bonus, going to Dartmouth
on a football scholarship, or
playing baseball for any one of
what he calls the "Big Three" —
Arizona State, USC, and Stanford.
Baker decided against a
football career due to his small
size (6-0, 170), and turned down
the Dodgers' offer to come here!
Honest Appraisal
"The thing you get with a
Stanford education — the people
you meet — go without saying. I'd
like to say I was here because I
like to study but that wouldn't be
true," Baker says frankly.
Since coming here, Baker,
dubbed "baby maker" in a play
on his name, has had his ups and
downs academically. However, his
first baseball season has been an
almost complete success.
Baker was promoted from the
frosh-soph team midway through
the spring and almost immediately
won the starting catching job with
his hot bat.
Despite a slump against USC,
Baker, who chokes up two inches
on his bat, finished with a .363
average, .300 in Pac-8 play.
Coach's Views
"We put a lot of pressure on
him," Coach Ray Young admits.
"But he started off really well.
"Dave plays on emotion a great
deal," Young adds. "We like to
see that; it means he's enjoying
the game.
"We have had very few players
who will take it upon themselves
to tell other players when they're

upset about something the way
Dave does."
Takes Criticism
Young, who will coach Baker
again this summer at Anchorage,
indicated that he is impressed
with the way the young catcher
accepts and gives criticism.
Baker had to take a lot of
criticism early in the year because
he couldn't catch pitches in the
dirt.
"The pitchers are really good
here, compared to high school.
Their curve balls really curve. But
I think I've improved a lot,"
Baker says, crediting his success
defensively to help from catchers
Bob Reece and Ed Orizzi and
outfielder-catcher Glen Johnson.

Baker hopes his future career
will be in baseball. "I'd like to
play until I can't do the job any
more. If I can't make it when I'm
in the minors, or in the big
leagues, or if it had happened
here, then I'd quit."
In the two or three varsity
years ahead of him, one of Baker's
chief goals is to help the Cardinals
win the Pac-8 title. To do this,
Baker thinks "we've got to get
some spirit going, get more
aggressiveness than we had this
year.
"This last weekend against Cal
we played great. We've won five
straight conference games and I
think we can keep some of that
going into next year," Baker says.
