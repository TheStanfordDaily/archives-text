Bruce Arrives In China
HONG KONG — Veteran diplomat David E.K.
Bruce entered China today to establish the
first American diplomatic mission since the
Communists took over in 1949. He said his
assignment was "very intriguing."
Bruce, his wife and three others crossed the
Shum Chun river frontier at Lowu shortly
after noon. From there they will fly to
Peking.
Bruce, scion of a socially prominent
Baltimore family, is called an ambassador's
ambassador because he is the very essence of
the suave and seasoned diplomat, the only
American career officer to hold the posts of
envoy to Bonn, Paris and London.
He retired in 1969 and was called back a
first time to head the American delegation at
the Paris peace talks on Vietnam.
He has been summoned out of retirement a
second time by President Nixon to fill the
China post, one which the President said
required a man of "great stature."
The 75-year-old diplomat will have the title
of U.S. representative, but he will be an
ambassador in everything but name.
At about the time he is officially opening
the Peking liaison office, China's former
ambassador to France, Huang Chen, one of
Mao Tse-tung's companions on the Long
March retreat of the 19305, will be
inaugurating the first Chinese Communist
liaison office in Washington.
Skylab Launch Set For Today
CAPE KENNEDY, Fla. — The men of Skylab
1, poised for a 28-day adventure in space
living, flew to this launch base yesterday as
final preparations advanced smoothly toward
today's liftoff of America's first space station.
Taking off and flying in a precise Navy
formation, astronauts Charles Conrad Jr., Dr.
Joseph P. Kerwin and Paul J. Weitz left
Ellington Air Force Base near Houston's
Johnson Space Center aboard two gleaming
white T3B jets and reared halfway across the
country to the nation's spaceport.
The astronauts circled the Cape Kennedy
area under clear, cloudless skies to make an
aerial inspection of the two rockets, coiled for

launch, which will start the Skylab era of
America's space program.
The astronauts, Charles Conrad Jr., Dr.
Joseph P. Kerwin, and Paul J. Weitz, observed
final preparation of the powerful Saturn 5
rocket which will launch the unmanned
Skylab space station at 10:30 p.m. PDT. Eight
thousand feet away, on a separate pad stood
the smaller Saturn IB rocket which will lift
the astronauts into orbit at 1 p.m. tomorrow.
The orbiting laboratory must function
flawlessly before it is cleared for occupation
by the crew. An on-board computer will cause
the space station to pressurize itself,
automatically deploy wings of solar cells
which convert sunlight to electrical power and
stabilize itself in space.
Skylab is the largest space vehicle ever
launched and is equivalent in size to a
1,600-square foot, three-bedroom house.
Skylab's primary goal is to prove man can
live and work for long periods of time in outer
space. Unlike the previous American space
programs, Skylab tests not only hardware and
equipment but also man himself.
During their four weeks aborad Skylab, the
astronauts will be carefully monitored with a
variety of medical devices. Should the long
exposure to weightlessness dangerously
de-condition the astronauts, officials said the
mission could be ended early.
The spacemen will also conduct
experiments designed to learn more about the
sun, the stars and earth.
Congress May Cut War Funds
WASHINGTON — Plans of 39 senators to join
in sponsoring legislation to bar funds for any
further U.S. involvement in Indochina
hostilities without specific approval of
Congress were announced Sunday.
Sen. Clifford P. Case (R-N.J.), said he and
Sen. Frank Church (D-Idaho), will offer the
measure, which also would bar U.S. aid to
North Vietnam without specific approval of
Congress.
"The purpose of the Case-Church
amendment is simply to assure that Congress
will henceforth be able to exercise its
constitutional responsibility and decide
whether or not the United States should

continue to fight in Indochina," Case said.
UN To Debate Mid-East Crisis
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. - U.N. Security
Council members have agreed to start
full-scale debate on the Middle East problem
May 29 and are talking privately about setting
up a special committee to try to defuse the
issue.
Nobody will admit authorship of the ideas
floating around the United Nations. But one
idea, attributed to the British, calls for a
committee of all 15 council members.
Another, attributed to the Russians, is for a
committee of four.
The public Soviet position favors revival
of the Middle East talks of the Soviet,
American, British and French council
delegates, suspended on U.S. insistence in
September 1971.
Under an Egyptian resolution adopted
April 20, the council will look into "all the
efforts undertaken by the United Nations in
the Middle East since June 1967," when Israel
defeated Egypt, Jordan and Syria in a six-day
war.
Impeachment Threatened
WASHINGTON — The ranking Republican on
the Senate's Watergate investigating
committee said Sunday President Nixon faces
possible impeachment if facts clearly prove he
was involved.
Sen. Howard Baker (R-Tenn.), said he has
no reason at present to believe Nixon was not
telling the truth when he said he had no
participation or knowledge of either the
Watergate bugging or its alleged coverup.
Baker said he would not exclude the
possibility the President may be offered an
opportunity by the Senate committee to
"state his side of the case."
At the same time, he said, staff
investigators are not ignoring the possibility of
involvement by Democratic candidates in
illegal or unethical political acts last year.
And he posed the possibility that the scope
of the Senate investigation may be broadened
far beyond its present mandate to include the
elections of 1968, 1964 and 1960.
The possibility of impeachment was on the
minds of other political figures also, most of
whom said they did not believe it even
remotely probable.

Communists took over in 1949. He said his
assignment was "very intriguing."
Bruce, his wife and three others crossed the
Shum Chun river frontier at Lowu shortly
after noon. From there they will fly to
Peking.
Bruce, scion of a socially prominent
Baltimore family, is called an ambassador's
ambassador because he is the very essence of
the suave and seasoned diplomat, the only
American career officer to hold the posts of
envoy to Bonn, Paris and London.
He retired in 1969 and was called back a
first time to head the American delegation at
the Paris peace talks on Vietnam.
He has been summoned out of retirement a
second time by President Nixon to fill the
China post, one which the President said
required a man of "great stature."
The 75-year-old diplomat will have the title
of U.S. representative, but he will be an
ambassador in everything but name.
At about the time he is officially opening
the Peking liaison office, China's former
ambassador to France, Huang Chen, one of
Mao Tse-tung's companions on the Long
March retreat of the 19305, will be
inaugurating the first Chinese Communist
liaison office in Washington.
Skylab Launch Set For Today
CAPE KENNEDY, Fla. — The men of Skylab
1, poised for a 28-day adventure in space
living, flew to this launch base yesterday as
final preparations advanced smoothly toward
today's liftoff of America's first space station.
Taking off and flying in a precise Navy
formation, astronauts Charles Conrad Jr., Dr.
Joseph P. Kerwin and Paul J. Weitz left
Ellington Air Force Base near Houston's
Johnson Space Center aboard two gleaming
white T3B jets and reared halfway across the
country to the nation's spaceport.
The astronauts circled the Cape Kennedy
area under clear, cloudless skies to make an
aerial inspection of the two rockets, coiled for

launch, which will start the Skylab era of
America's space program.
The astronauts, Charles Conrad Jr., Dr.
Joseph P. Kerwin, and Paul J. Weitz, observed
final preparation of the powerful Saturn 5
rocket which will launch the unmanned
Skylab space station at 10:30 p.m. PDT. Eight
thousand feet away, on a separate pad stood
the smaller Saturn IB rocket which will lift
the astronauts into orbit at 1 p.m. tomorrow.
The orbiting laboratory must function
flawlessly before it is cleared for occupation
by the crew. An on-board computer will cause
the space station to pressurize itself,
automatically deploy wings of solar cells
which convert sunlight to electrical power and
stabilize itself in space.
Skylab is the largest space vehicle ever
launched and is equivalent in size to a
1,600-square foot, three-bedroom house.
Skylab's primary goal is to prove man can
live and work for long periods of time in outer
space. Unlike the previous American space
programs, Skylab tests not only hardware and
equipment but also man himself.
During their four weeks aborad Skylab, the
astronauts will be carefully monitored with a
variety of medical devices. Should the long
exposure to weightlessness dangerously
de-condition the astronauts, officials said the
mission could be ended early.
The spacemen will also conduct
experiments designed to learn more about the
sun, the stars and earth.
Congress May Cut War Funds
WASHINGTON — Plans of 39 senators to join
in sponsoring legislation to bar funds for any
further U.S. involvement in Indochina
hostilities without specific approval of
Congress were announced Sunday.
Sen. Clifford P. Case (R-N.J.), said he and
Sen. Frank Church (D-Idaho), will offer the
measure, which also would bar U.S. aid to
North Vietnam without specific approval of
Congress.
"The purpose of the Case-Church
amendment is simply to assure that Congress
will henceforth be able to exercise its
constitutional responsibility and decide
whether or not the United States should

continue to fight in Indochina," Case said.
UN To Debate Mid-East Crisis
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. - U.N. Security
Council members have agreed to start
full-scale debate on the Middle East problem
May 29 and are talking privately about setting
up a special committee to try to defuse the

Nobody will admit authorship of the ideas
floating around the United Nations. But one
idea, attributed to the British, calls for a

Another, attributed to the Russians, is for a

The public Soviet position favors revival
of the Middle East talks of the Soviet,
American, British and French council
delegates, suspended on U.S. insistence in

Under an Egyptian resolution adopted
April 20, the council will look into "all the

Impeachment Threatened
WASHINGTON — The ranking Republican on
the Senate's Watergate investigating
committee said Sunday President Nixon faces
possible impeachment if facts clearly prove he
was involved.
Sen. Howard Baker (R-Tenn.), said he has
no reason at present to believe Nixon was not
telling the truth when he said he had no
participation or knowledge of either the
Watergate bugging or its alleged coverup.
Baker said he would not exclude the
possibility the President may be offered an
opportunity by the Senate committee to
"state his side of the case."
At the same time, he said, staff
investigators are not ignoring the possibility of
involvement by Democratic candidates in
illegal or unethical political acts last year.
And he posed the possibility that the scope
of the Senate investigation may be broadened
far beyond its present mandate to include the
elections of 1968, 1964 and 1960.
The possibility of impeachment was on the
minds of other political figures also, most of

after noon. From there they will fly to
Peking.
Bruce, scion of a socially prominent
Baltimore family, is called an ambassador's
ambassador because he is the very essence of
the suave and seasoned diplomat, the only
American career officer to hold the posts of
envoy to Bonn, Paris and London.
He retired in 1969 and was called back a
first time to head the American delegation at
the Paris peace talks on Vietnam.
He has been summoned out of retirement a
second time by President Nixon to fill the
China post, one which the President said
required a man of "great stature."
The 75-year-old diplomat will have the title
of U.S. representative, but he will be an
ambassador in everything but name.
At about the time he is officially opening
the Peking liaison office, China's former
ambassador to France, Huang Chen, one of
Mao Tse-tung's companions on the Long
March retreat of the 19305, will be
inaugurating the first Chinese Communist
liaison office in Washington.
Skylab Launch Set For Today
CAPE KENNEDY, Fla. — The men of Skylab
1, poised for a 28-day adventure in space
living, flew to this launch base yesterday as
final preparations advanced smoothly toward
today's liftoff of America's first space station.
Taking off and flying in a precise Navy
formation, astronauts Charles Conrad Jr., Dr.
Joseph P. Kerwin and Paul J. Weitz left
Ellington Air Force Base near Houston's
Johnson Space Center aboard two gleaming
white T3B jets and reared halfway across the
country to the nation's spaceport.
The astronauts circled the Cape Kennedy
area under clear, cloudless skies to make an
aerial inspection of the two rockets, coiled for

launch, which will start the Skylab era of
America's space program.
The astronauts, Charles Conrad Jr., Dr.
Joseph P. Kerwin, and Paul J. Weitz, observed
final preparation of the powerful Saturn 5
rocket which will launch the unmanned
Skylab space station at 10:30 p.m. PDT. Eight
thousand feet away, on a separate pad stood
the smaller Saturn IB rocket which will lift
the astronauts into orbit at 1 p.m. tomorrow.
The orbiting laboratory must function
flawlessly before it is cleared for occupation
by the crew. An on-board computer will cause
the space station to pressurize itself,
automatically deploy wings of solar cells
which convert sunlight to electrical power and
stabilize itself in space.
Skylab is the largest space vehicle ever
launched and is equivalent in size to a
1,600-square foot, three-bedroom house.
Skylab's primary goal is to prove man can
live and work for long periods of time in outer
space. Unlike the previous American space
programs, Skylab tests not only hardware and
equipment but also man himself.
During their four weeks aborad Skylab, the
astronauts will be carefully monitored with a
variety of medical devices. Should the long
exposure to weightlessness dangerously
de-condition the astronauts, officials said the
mission could be ended early.
The spacemen will also conduct
experiments designed to learn more about the
sun, the stars and earth.
Congress May Cut War Funds
WASHINGTON — Plans of 39 senators to join
in sponsoring legislation to bar funds for any
further U.S. involvement in Indochina
hostilities without specific approval of
Congress were announced Sunday.
Sen. Clifford P. Case (R-N.J.), said he and
Sen. Frank Church (D-Idaho), will offer the
measure, which also would bar U.S. aid to
North Vietnam without specific approval of
Congress.
"The purpose of the Case-Church
amendment is simply to assure that Congress
will henceforth be able to exercise its
constitutional responsibility and decide
whether or not the United States should

continue to fight in Indochina," Case said.
UN To Debate Mid-East Crisis
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. - U.N. Security
Council members have agreed to start
full-scale debate on the Middle East problem
May 29 and are talking privately about setting
up a special committee to try to defuse the
issue.
Nobody will admit authorship of the ideas
floating around the United Nations. But one
idea, attributed to the British, calls for a
committee of all 15 council members.
Another, attributed to the Russians, is for a
committee of four.
The public Soviet position favors revival
of the Middle East talks of the Soviet,
American, British and French council
delegates, suspended on U.S. insistence in
September 1971.
Under an Egyptian resolution adopted
April 20, the council will look into "all the
efforts undertaken by the United Nations in
the Middle East since June 1967," when Israel
defeated Egypt, Jordan and Syria in a six-day
war.
Impeachment Threatened
WASHINGTON — The ranking Republican on
the Senate's Watergate investigating
committee said Sunday President Nixon faces
possible impeachment if facts clearly prove he
was involved.
Sen. Howard Baker (R-Tenn.), said he has
no reason at present to believe Nixon was not
telling the truth when he said he had no
participation or knowledge of either the
Watergate bugging or its alleged coverup.
Baker said he would not exclude the
possibility the President may be offered an
opportunity by the Senate committee to
"state his side of the case."
At the same time, he said, staff
investigators are not ignoring the possibility of
involvement by Democratic candidates in
illegal or unethical political acts last year.
And he posed the possibility that the scope
of the Senate investigation may be broadened
far beyond its present mandate to include the
elections of 1968, 1964 and 1960.
The possibility of impeachment was on the
minds of other political figures also, most of
whom said they did not believe it even
remotely probable.
Fair Weather Continues
Fair through Tuesday but with low clouds and
