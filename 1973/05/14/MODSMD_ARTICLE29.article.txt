# Physicists From Stanford Receive Statewide Honors

Physics Prof. Arthur L. Schawlow and Asst. Prof.
Theodor W. Hansch share the $5,000 California
Scientist of the Year award, presented by the
California Museum of Science and Industry and its
educational affiliate, the California Museum
Foundation.
In a joint presentation last Thursday in Los
Angeles, alumni William R. Hewlett and David H.
Packard together were named California
Industrialists of the Year.
The four well-known Stanford figures made a
clean sweep of the statewide honors, marking the
first time in the 16-year history of the awards that
the honors were both shared and concentrated in
the Bay Area.
Dr. Frederick Raines, Dean of the School of
Physical Sciences at the University of California,
Ojai, presented the award to Schawlow and Hansch.
He said of the two physicists, "Their discovery has
enabled scientists to resolve or distinguish the
characteristic absorption lines of an atom which
differ by as little as one part in several billion."
Lasers Involved
That discovery involves the use of tuneable lasers
to reveal the fine structure of virtually all atoms and
molecules.
Schawlow, co-inventor of the laser, explains, "We
have been able to do much science with lasers, but
we had to do problems that were tuned to some

existing laser. Now we can tune the laser to the
problem."
Hewlett and Packard were cited for "devotion
and dedication to the improvement of American
life, both inside and outside their company," and
for "their outstanding philanthropic and public
service activities."
Stanford Trustee
Hewlett, president of the Hewlett-Packard Co.,
of Palo Alto, is currently a Stanford trustee. He
accepted the award from San Francisco Chamber of
Commerce Chairman James Stretch.
Packard, former president of the University
Board of Trustees and current chairman of
Hewlett-Packard, did not attend the presentation,
and remained in Washington D.C.
He served under Richard Nixon from January,
1969 through December 1971 as U.S. Deputy
Secretary of Defense. He recently declined an offer
from Nixon asking him to succeed Eliot Richardson
as Secretary of Defense.
The two men, who founded Hewlett-Packard in
1939, are long-time benefactors of Stanford.
They and their families are the principal donors
for a new $9.2 million engineering building
honoring Emeritus Provost Frederick E. Terman,
with whose encouragement they started the
corporation that is now one of the largest electronic
manufacturing firms in the world.

enabled scientists to resolve or distinguish the
characteristic absorption lines of an atom which
differ by as little as one part in several billion."
Lasers Involved
That discovery involves the use of tuneable lasers
to reveal the fine structure of virtually all atoms and
molecules.
Schawlow, co-inventor of the laser, explains, "We
have been able to do much science with lasers, but
we had to do problems that were tuned to some

existing laser. Now we can tune the laser to the
problem."
Hewlett and Packard were cited for "devotion
and dedication to the improvement of American
life, both inside and outside their company," and
for "their outstanding philanthropic and public
service activities."
Stanford Trustee
Hewlett, president of the Hewlett-Packard Co.,
of Palo Alto, is currently a Stanford trustee. He
accepted the award from San Francisco Chamber of
Commerce Chairman James Stretch.
Packard, former president of the University
Board of Trustees and current chairman of
Hewlett-Packard, did not attend the presentation,
and remained in Washington D.C.
He served under Richard Nixon from January,
1969 through December 1971 as U.S. Deputy
Secretary of Defense. He recently declined an offer
from Nixon asking him to succeed Eliot Richardson
as Secretary of Defense.
The two men, who founded Hewlett-Packard in
1939, are long-time benefactors of Stanford.
They and their families are the principal donors
for a new $9.2 million engineering building
honoring Emeritus Provost Frederick E. Terman,
with whose encouragement they started the
corporation that is now one of the largest electronic
manufacturing firms in the world.
