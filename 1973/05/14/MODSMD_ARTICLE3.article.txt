# 'Daily' Editor Turns Down Tolly Award
## 
### 
Copywrong 1973, The Freshman Daily
The first annual presentation
of the Tolly Awards to
outstanding veterans of the Daily
staff by the Freshman Daily
Academy of Journalists Arts,
Sciences, and Metaphysics, was
marked by the Daily
editor-in-chief's refusal to accept
his "Tolly."
A. Charles Hoffman, who was
cited by the Academy for "best
performance by a tree in an
editorial position," declined the
honor at the Tolly Awards
Banquet held early this morning
at the Menlo House Restaurant in
Atherton.
"You've made me an offer that
I can refuse," Hoffman explained
to the Academy. "I will join the
ranks of George C. Scott and
Marlon Brando and decline this
award, in the hope that my refusal
will call attention to the ranks of
oppressed freshmen at the Daily."
The audience was moved to
silence as Hoffman finished his
short speech and left the rostum.
Academy President Bill Weinstein

finally looked up from his box
lunch to break the hush, saying,
"We don't laugh at Charlie
anymore because being six feet,
seven inches tall means never
having to say you're sorry."
Other recipients of the Tolly
Awards expressed gratitude to the

Academy in their acceptance
speeches.
Daily Operations Manager Rick
Rolandi, upon receiving the
Academy's "Good Tasting Tuna
Award," declared, "I am both
honred and surprised to attain this
recognition — I thought you were
looking for total tunas with good
taste."
The list of award-winners
included Rich Jaroslovsky (cited
for outstanding performance in
"What Made the Campus Report
Parody Famous Made a Turkey
Out of Me"), Glenn Kramon
(awarded a Tolly for his
supporting role in "I've Got a
Nose for News"), George Dobbins
(honored for his portrayal of the
elf in "On Top of the Christmas
Tree"), and Heismann Trophy
Candidate Hall Daily (acclaimed
for his starring role in "Sports
Highlights of 1972-73").
Managing editor James
Wascher, the Chicago flash,
accepted his Tolly Award for
"Best Performance by a Chicago

Cubs' Fan," by announcing, "I am
so pleased with this award that I
feel I must give the Academy
something in return — who wants
gum?"
Weinstein announced the
Academy's decision to recognize
columnist Bill Evers with a Tolly

Award, although they were not
sure of what he had specifically
done recently to deserve it.
Weinstein said, "We recognize Bill
for his many years of meritorious
- er-umm-service?"
Several award recipients were
unable to acknowledge their
Tollies in person at the ceremony.
Buz Battle accepted former sprots
editor Stan Wilson's award for a
commendable performance as the
Italian Stallion in "I Wanna Hurt
Somebody."
Quote Board Editor Glenn
Garvin was unable to accept the
Rudy Tamm Congeniality Award,
as he was recently hospitalized
with labor pains.
The most boisterous applause
of the evening was accorded to
"Uncle" Ed Kohn, who received a
special award for his contributions
to the Womens' Equality
Movement.
Entertainment Editor Chrissy
Douglas, accepting Kohn's award,
stated, "I really can't repeat what
Ed would say if he could be here
today."
