# Ellsberg, Russo To Sue Government
## 
### Terry Anzur Mark Simonian News Summary 
Defense attorney Leonard
Boudin announced Saturday that
Daniel Ellsberg and Anthony
Russo will file a damage suit in
Washington against Nixon
administration officials to recover
part of the estimated $900,000
spent by their defense in the
Pentagon Papers trial.
United States District Court
Judge Matt Byrne dismissed
charges of espionage, theft, and

conspiracy against the two men
Friday.
Boudin revealed that plans for
the suit did not presently include
charging President Nixon in
connection with the burglary of
Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office and
the bugging of Ellsberg's phone
conversations.
"The evidence against the
President is substantial, but
circumstantial," the attorney
stated. "Unless enough evidence
can be produced to justify his
being named, Mr. Nixon will not

be included."
Boudin said the suit would
require a hearing, and indicated
that the defense would call
persons implicated during the
prosecution of Ellsberg and
Russo.
He named no individuals in
particular, but those he previously
asked to be summoned in the trial
include former attorney general
John Mitchell, former White
House aides John Ehrlichman and
H.R. Haldeman, ousted
presidential counsel John Dean,
former acting FBI director L.
Patrick Gray, and other Nixon
aides.
After celebrating the dismissal
of charges at a champagne victory
party attended by 300 supporters
Friday night, Ellsberg and Russo
spoke about their case at a
Saturday morning news
conference.
"The war is not over, but in a
long struggle, the country has
something to celebrate," Ellsberg
said.
Asked whether he would join a
movement to impeach Nixon,
Ellsberg replied, "I've been
thinking about Richard Nixon for
several years. I've thought enough
about him. I hope never to think
about him again."

Russo, however, said he
intended to work on a national
impeach-Nixon effort, and
announced he was flying to
Chicago to attend a meeting to
discuss that action.
In a related development,
presidential advisor Henry A.
Kissinger implied Saturday that he

had witnessed results of a
wiretapping that contributed to
the dismissal of the Pentagon
Papers case.
Kissinger, who was asked at a
White House briefing whether or
not he had any knowledge of the
tap on the home telephone of his
