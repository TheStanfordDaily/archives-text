# Apolitical Dollies Resent 'Aloof' Image
## 
### Janet Sanders 
For years, five beautiful pom pon girls
appropriately called the Stanford Dollies have
provided high kicks and go-go dance routines
for eager onlookers at football games. Their
immaculate appearance and clean-cut image
sharply contrast with the often raucous band
which they accompany.
For many spectators, the girls, with their
constant smiles and sleek figures, have an
image which one band member accurately
summed up as "China dolls set up on the
shelf," aloof and somewhat unreal.
But this year's newly-chosen Dollies, all
freshmen, resent the stereotype with which
they have been labeled. "Stereotyping is the
result of ignorance," said new Dolly Linda
Thomas. Dolly Jackie Nelson echoed her
sentiments by saying that the "dolly image" is
completely false.
But despite the fact that the new Dollies
do not fit any mold, they do have some
common interests.
For example, all of them are apolitical. "In
politics, I'm ignorant," said Marcella Deffke,
classifying herself as a "liberal conservative."
Dolly Stephanie Jubina, who is Deffke's
roommate, admitted that she turns to the
sports pages first if she reads the newspaper at
all.
Apolitical Views
In the few political beliefs they do have,
four out of five Dollies classify themselves as
conservatives to moderates. Thomas, the one

exception, said, "My opinions are not clear
enough for me to know where I stand on the
political spectrum."
All of the Dollies also have academic
interests centered in humanities. Dollies Linda
Jenks and Jackie Nelson are studying foreign
languages, Jubina is an art major, and Thomas
is planning a double major in French and
human biology. Deffke, as yet undecided in
her major, is interested in "anything that isn't
science or math."
Except for Thomas, who is planning to
work as a physical therapist, none of the girls
have any career ambitions after graduation.
"Although I'm not planning a career, I would
like to have something I can do if I have to
work," commented Jenks.
Like Stanford
All Californians, the new Dollies are
enthusiastic about their first year at Stanford
and can find little to criticize about the
school. They tried out for their present
position out of a love for dancing and an
interest in the band. Jenks added, "It is also a
good way to get involved."
Since March 5 when the band selected
them out of 23 applicants, the Dollies have
experienced little change in their social
groups. Negative reactions among
acquaintances to their new job have been
almost nonexistent, although Deffke said,
"One of my Christian friends believed that
being a Dolly was immoral."
The similarities stop when the Dollies talk

about the woman's role in society, however.
Although none of them are involved in the
women's liberation movement, a few of them
are more sympathetic with its goals than the
others.
'Male The Leader'
Deffke, Jubina and Jenks, active in the
Campus Crusade for Christ, hold very
traditional views of a woman's role. "The
male is the natural aggressor and leader,"
explained Deffke, "and the woman is the
passive and compassionate one, submissive to
the man."
Her roommate, Jubina, agreed. Disparaging
women's lib, she added that "You cause a lot
of problems when you try to switch the roles
around."
All three girls are strong proponents of
marriage. "Women were created to get
married," said Jubina. They all plan to have a
family and consider it necessary for the
woman to stay at home after she has children.
Nelson and Thomas were more pragmatic
in their approaches to women's lib. "Women
have a social right to be independent and
strong," said Thomas. However, she noted
that the women's movement often tries "to
tell people how to act too much."
Nelson pointed out the need for equal pay
and equal job opportunities for women.
However, "The movement tries to lump all
women together when maybe they don't want
to be included," she added.

SEX SYMBOLS? — The 1973-74 Dollies, from left, Linda Thomas, Jackie Nelson, Linda Jenks, Marcella
Deffke, and Stephanie Jubina, don't feel they are sex symbols or "china dolls." But others disagree.
Despite this split over the woman's role in
society, the five Dollies fit together
remarkably well. They are excited about the
coming year of sports and dancing routines in
front of enthusiastic crowds. Uniforms are
being fitted and last-minute touches to their
dances are being added.

The Dollies as sex symbols? Although none
of them regard themselves as such, band
member Jeff Dykes disagrees. "Of course the
Dollies are sex symbols," he said. "That's
basically what they're out there for."
A quick glance at the Dollies' attractive
appearance and sexy dance movements will
lead most spectators to agree.

The similarities stop when the Dollies talk

about the woman's role in society, however.
Although none of them are involved in the
women's liberation movement, a few of them
are more sympathetic with its goals than the
others.
'Male The Leader'
Deffke, Jubina and Jenks, active in the
Campus Crusade for Christ, hold very
traditional views of a woman's role. "The
male is the natural aggressor and leader,"
explained Deffke, "and the woman is the
passive and compassionate one, submissive to
the man."
Her roommate, Jubina, agreed. Disparaging
women's lib, she added that "You cause a lot
of problems when you try to switch the roles
around."
All three girls are strong proponents of
marriage. "Women were created to get
married," said Jubina. They all plan to have a
family and consider it necessary for the
woman to stay at home after she has children.
Nelson and Thomas were more pragmatic
in their approaches to women's lib. "Women
have a social right to be independent and
strong," said Thomas. However, she noted
that the women's movement often tries "to
tell people how to act too much."
Nelson pointed out the need for equal pay
and equal job opportunities for women.
However, "The movement tries to lump all
women together when maybe they don't want
to be included," she added.

SEX SYMBOLS? — The 1973-74 Dollies, from left, Linda Thomas, Jackie Nelson, Linda Jenks, Marcella
Deffke, and Stephanie Jubina, don't feel they are sex symbols or "china dolls." But others disagree.
Despite this split over the woman's role in
society, the five Dollies fit together
remarkably well. They are excited about the
coming year of sports and dancing routines in
front of enthusiastic crowds. Uniforms are
being fitted and last-minute touches to their
dances are being added.

The Dollies as sex symbols? Although none
of them regard themselves as such, band
member Jeff Dykes disagrees. "Of course the
Dollies are sex symbols," he said. "That's
basically what they're out there for."
A quick glance at the Dollies' attractive
appearance and sexy dance movements will
lead most spectators to agree.
For years, five beautiful pom pon girls
appropriately called the Stanford Dollies have
provided high kicks and go-go dance routines
for eager onlookers at football games. Their
immaculate appearance and clean-cut image
sharply contrast with the often raucous band
which they accompany.
For many spectators, the girls, with their
constant smiles and sleek figures, have an
image which one band member accurately
summed up as "China dolls set up on the
shelf," aloof and somewhat unreal.
But this year's newly-chosen Dollies, all
freshmen, resent the stereotype with which
they have been labeled. "Stereotyping is the
result of ignorance," said new Dolly Linda
Thomas. Dolly Jackie Nelson echoed her
sentiments by saying that the "dolly image" is
completely false.
But despite the fact that the new Dollies
do not fit any mold, they do have some
common interests.
For example, all of them are apolitical. "In
politics, I'm ignorant," said Marcella Deffke,
classifying herself as a "liberal conservative."
Dolly Stephanie Jubina, who is Deffke's
roommate, admitted that she turns to the
sports pages first if she reads the newspaper at
all.
Apolitical Views
In the few political beliefs they do have,
four out of five Dollies classify themselves as
conservatives to moderates. Thomas, the one

exception, said, "My opinions are not clear
enough for me to know where I stand on the
political spectrum."
All of the Dollies also have academic
interests centered in humanities. Dollies Linda
Jenks and Jackie Nelson are studying foreign
languages, Jubina is an art major, and Thomas
is planning a double major in French and
human biology. Deffke, as yet undecided in
her major, is interested in "anything that isn't
science or math."
Except for Thomas, who is planning to
work as a physical therapist, none of the girls
have any career ambitions after graduation.
"Although I'm not planning a career, I would
like to have something I can do if I have to
work," commented Jenks.
Like Stanford
All Californians, the new Dollies are
enthusiastic about their first year at Stanford
and can find little to criticize about the
school. They tried out for their present
position out of a love for dancing and an
interest in the band. Jenks added, "It is also a
good way to get involved."
Since March 5 when the band selected
them out of 23 applicants, the Dollies have
experienced little change in their social
groups. Negative reactions among
acquaintances to their new job have been
almost nonexistent, although Deffke said,
"One of my Christian friends believed that
being a Dolly was immoral."

shelf," aloof and somewhat unreal.
But this year's newly-chosen Dollies, all
freshmen, resent the stereotype with which
they have been labeled. "Stereotyping is the
result of ignorance," said new Dolly Linda
Thomas. Dolly Jackie Nelson echoed her
sentiments by saying that the "dolly image" is
completely false.
But despite the fact that the new Dollies
do not fit any mold, they do have some
common interests.
For example, all of them are apolitical. "In
politics, I'm ignorant," said Marcella Deffke,
classifying herself as a "liberal conservative."
Dolly Stephanie Jubina, who is Deffke's
roommate, admitted that she turns to the
sports pages first if she reads the newspaper at
all.
Apolitical Views
In the few political beliefs they do have,
four out of five Dollies classify themselves as
conservatives to moderates. Thomas, the one

exception, said, "My opinions are not clear
enough for me to know where I stand on the
political spectrum."
All of the Dollies also have academic
interests centered in humanities. Dollies Linda
Jenks and Jackie Nelson are studying foreign
languages, Jubina is an art major, and Thomas
is planning a double major in French and
human biology. Deffke, as yet undecided in
her major, is interested in "anything that isn't
science or math."
Except for Thomas, who is planning to
work as a physical therapist, none of the girls
have any career ambitions after graduation.
"Although I'm not planning a career, I would
like to have something I can do if I have to
work," commented Jenks.
Like Stanford
All Californians, the new Dollies are
enthusiastic about their first year at Stanford
and can find little to criticize about the
school. They tried out for their present
position out of a love for dancing and an
interest in the band. Jenks added, "It is also a
good way to get involved."
Since March 5 when the band selected
them out of 23 applicants, the Dollies have
experienced little change in their social
groups. Negative reactions among
acquaintances to their new job have been
almost nonexistent, although Deffke said,
"One of my Christian friends believed that
being a Dolly was immoral."
The similarities stop when the Dollies talk

about the woman's role in society, however.
Although none of them are involved in the
women's liberation movement, a few of them
are more sympathetic with its goals than the
others.
'Male The Leader'
Deffke, Jubina and Jenks, active in the
Campus Crusade for Christ, hold very
traditional views of a woman's role. "The
male is the natural aggressor and leader,"
explained Deffke, "and the woman is the
passive and compassionate one, submissive to
the man."
Her roommate, Jubina, agreed. Disparaging
women's lib, she added that "You cause a lot
of problems when you try to switch the roles
around."
All three girls are strong proponents of
marriage. "Women were created to get
married," said Jubina. They all plan to have a
family and consider it necessary for the
woman to stay at home after she has children.
Nelson and Thomas were more pragmatic
in their approaches to women's lib. "Women
have a social right to be independent and
strong," said Thomas. However, she noted
that the women's movement often tries "to
tell people how to act too much."
Nelson pointed out the need for equal pay
and equal job opportunities for women.
However, "The movement tries to lump all
women together when maybe they don't want
to be included," she added.

SEX SYMBOLS? — The 1973-74 Dollies, from left, Linda Thomas, Jackie Nelson, Linda Jenks, Marcella
Deffke, and Stephanie Jubina, don't feel they are sex symbols or "china dolls." But others disagree.
Despite this split over the woman's role in
society, the five Dollies fit together
remarkably well. They are excited about the
coming year of sports and dancing routines in
front of enthusiastic crowds. Uniforms are
being fitted and last-minute touches to their
dances are being added.

The Dollies as sex symbols? Although none
of them regard themselves as such, band
member Jeff Dykes disagrees. "Of course the
Dollies are sex symbols," he said. "That's
basically what they're out there for."
A quick glance at the Dollies' attractive
appearance and sexy dance movements will
lead most spectators to agree.
