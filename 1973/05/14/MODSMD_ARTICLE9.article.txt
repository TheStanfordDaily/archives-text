# A 						'Daily' Fairy Tale
## You're A Good Giraffe, Chuck 
### 
The Staff

Once upon a time there was a
forest in Chicago named Schmaley
Forest (in all due respect to the
mayor of course!).
For the most part, the animals
got along together quite well and
were happy with their
surroundings. Those few times,
however, when there was
dissatisfaction, commotion and
quarreling illustrated the need for
a leader to keep order.
All the animals met one day, in
a meadow at the edge of the pine
tree grove, and, following an
ancient custom, elected the lion as
king of the forest. Thus began
Sargeant Piffelson's career as their
leader.
Piffy was a good king, very
wise in the ways of the forest, and
very devoted to his task of
keeping order. He spent most of
his waking hours listening to
problems and disputes of the
animals and discovering new ways
for everyone to get along.
Piffy had much invaluable help
from the other animals, such as
Jaros, the jumping brown bear,
and Doc Jamie Dryer, the tall,
thin roadrunner.
Piffy spent so much of his time
with the animals and keeping the
forest in good order that one
morning he woke up very tired,
sick and overworked. The animals
were very unhappy for Piffy and
very sympathetic. They took
turns caring for him and feeding
him his favorite foods; bananas
and baby shrimp.
The animals soon discovered
that it would be quite some time
before Piffy would be back on his
feet again, and, realizing their
need for a new king, they met at
the meadow and elected Chuck,
the giraffe, as their new leader.
Chuck, a kindly and gentle

giraffe, was very pleased to be
elected king of the forest. He
immediately began to put his
kingdom in order, seeking help
from Archie Kra, the "nose for
news" anteater, and from HTC,
the red rockett tiger.
Chuck was particularly
interested in making sure
everyone was happy and having a
good time. One of his ideas was
for a huge spring banquet, so he
called the animals together to plan
it.
Brenny, the ecology-minded
raccoon was there, with his friend,
D.M., the cheerful, "light of my
life" coyote. Both of them told
jokes throughout the meeting.
Sissy, the beautiful swan
showed up with Peorge the puma.
They were especially interested in
the occasion, suggesting a softball
game beforehand. This was greatly
applauded by that sportsminded
swinger, Donald the duck.
Bobkin, the groundhog,
suggested that the gala affair begin
early in the morning and last
through the evening. Krav-it, the
kangaroo, hopped into the
meeting late and had to be caught
up on the details. Teeman, the
fox, offered to help Krav-it.
The animals grew enthusiastic
as the meeting progressed and
plans developed for good food,
good music and great fun.
Everyone offered to help, and the
gathering broke up with all the
animals still discussing the
banquet and vowing to show up
early.
Chuck was happiest of all,
feeling pleased that his idea was
such a success.
The day of the feast dawned
bright and clear. Chuck woke up
early and right away galloped off

to the location of the feast.
No one else was there, so
Chuck settled down to wait,
figuring everyone would arrive
before long.
Four hours later, a very
dejected giraffe was still sitting in
the field, with baseball cap and
tennis shoes still on, ready to
play softball but without any
playmates.
At sundown, Chuck decided to
give up and go home. He was a

very sad giraffe and fell asleep
thinking the animals had let him
down, and that no one really
loved him after all.
It was noon the next day when
all the animals, in the middle of
their softball game, decided to
send someone to find out if
Chuck was planning on attending
their feast.

Once upon a time there was a
forest in Chicago named Schmaley
Forest (in all due respect to the
mayor of course!).
For the most part, the animals
got along together quite well and
were happy with their
surroundings. Those few times,
however, when there was
dissatisfaction, commotion and
quarreling illustrated the need for
a leader to keep order.
All the animals met one day, in
a meadow at the edge of the pine
tree grove, and, following an
ancient custom, elected the lion as
king of the forest. Thus began
Sargeant Piffelson's career as their
leader.
Piffy was a good king, very
wise in the ways of the forest, and
very devoted to his task of
keeping order. He spent most of
his waking hours listening to
problems and disputes of the
animals and discovering new ways
for everyone to get along.
Piffy had much invaluable help
from the other animals, such as
Jaros, the jumping brown bear,
and Doc Jamie Dryer, the tall,
thin roadrunner.
Piffy spent so much of his time
with the animals and keeping the
forest in good order that one
morning he woke up very tired,
sick and overworked. The animals
were very unhappy for Piffy and
very sympathetic. They took
turns caring for him and feeding
him his favorite foods; bananas
and baby shrimp.
The animals soon discovered
that it would be quite some time
before Piffy would be back on his
feet again, and, realizing their
need for a new king, they met at
the meadow and elected Chuck,
the giraffe, as their new leader.
Chuck, a kindly and gentle

giraffe, was very pleased to be
elected king of the forest. He
immediately began to put his
kingdom in order, seeking help
from Archie Kra, the "nose for
news" anteater, and from HTC,
the red rockett tiger.
Chuck was particularly
interested in making sure
everyone was happy and having a
good time. One of his ideas was
for a huge spring banquet, so he
called the animals together to plan
it.
Brenny, the ecology-minded
raccoon was there, with his friend,
D.M., the cheerful, "light of my
life" coyote. Both of them told
jokes throughout the meeting.
Sissy, the beautiful swan
showed up with Peorge the puma.
They were especially interested in
the occasion, suggesting a softball
game beforehand. This was greatly
applauded by that sportsminded
swinger, Donald the duck.
Bobkin, the groundhog,
suggested that the gala affair begin
early in the morning and last
through the evening. Krav-it, the
kangaroo, hopped into the
meeting late and had to be caught
up on the details. Teeman, the
fox, offered to help Krav-it.
The animals grew enthusiastic
as the meeting progressed and
plans developed for good food,
good music and great fun.
Everyone offered to help, and the
gathering broke up with all the
animals still discussing the
banquet and vowing to show up
early.
Chuck was happiest of all,
feeling pleased that his idea was
such a success.
The day of the feast dawned
bright and clear. Chuck woke up
early and right away galloped off

to the location of the feast.
No one else was there, so
Chuck settled down to wait,
figuring everyone would arrive
before long.
Four hours later, a very
dejected giraffe was still sitting in
the field, with baseball cap and
tennis shoes still on, ready to
play softball but without any
playmates.
At sundown, Chuck decided to
give up and go home. He was a

very sad giraffe and fell asleep
thinking the animals had let him
down, and that no one really
loved him after all.
