YOU PROBABLY THINK
THAT YOU'RE PRETTY SMART
PROVE IT!
If you weren't talented, articulate and creative you wouldn't be at Stanford,
would you? You got in because you're smart. You'll get through because
you're smart. And when you've got your sheepskin you're going to prove to
the world just how smart you are. Why wait? Why not take all you've learned
in sociology and psychology and economics and art and put a little theory
into practice. You may get straight A's, but that doesn't mean much when
you're trying to convince a merchant to buy an ad. Or when you're designing
an ad. Or when you're running a newspaper's circulation department. So if
you think you can prove you're talented, articulate and creative, out of the
classroom, we want you. The 'Daily' is now accepting applications for its '73-
'74 school year business staff. We primarily are seeking people to fill sales
positions. All interested students should attend a meeting on WEDNESDAY,

If you can't attend the meeting, drop by between 10-5 today or tomorrow and
fill out an application. We're located at Panama and Lomita St.
