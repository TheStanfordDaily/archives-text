# Student Firemen Work With Pros
## 
### KITTY PATTERSON 
Remember dreaming of becoming a
fireman when you grew up? Fourteen
Stanford students must. They help the
twenty-seven full time firemen in the
Stanford Fire Department fight all the
fires on Stanford property.
The student firemen live and train
at the firehouse during the entire
school year. They can perform almost
every fire-fighting task like
professionals. They know each
compartment in each of the
department's four big trucks. They can
operate the hoses, scramble up the
aerial ladder, and administer advanced
first aid.
The only thing they can't do is
drive the fire trucks.
A rookie student fireman undergoes
preliminary training in rescuing fire
victims, using the hose, and, of course,
putting out fires. Once he joins the

force, he must continue training from
one to five on weekends.
Training methods range from
lectures and first aid films in the
firehouse classroom to fire simulations
in the training tower* behind the
station. The tower enables students to
practice raising ladders, rushing up
stairs, and setting up hoses.
The most useful training and the
most enjoyable experience, according
to student fireman Bill Bamattre,
comes informally from the
professional firemen. Says Bamattre,
they provide on-the-scene advice and
"generally show us the ropes."
Amazing Rapport
In the meantime, students and paid
men develop an amazing rapport.
Students respect the paid men
because, according to one student
fireman, "they teach us a lot — not
just about work — but about life away

from a sheltered dorm."
Most of the paid men are young;
several have served in Vietnam.
Bamattre considers simply being
around them "a good learning
experience."

Since the paid men on duty at night
have little to do, students spend a lot
of time with them, talking, joking, and
playing pool, ping pong, and cards.
"The only drawback," says Bamattre,
