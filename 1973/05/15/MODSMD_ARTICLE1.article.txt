# Student Firemen Work With Pros
## 
### KITTY PATTERSON 
Remember dreaming of becoming a
fireman when you grew up? Fourteen
Stanford students must. They help the
twenty-seven full time firemen in the
Stanford Fire Department fight all the
fires on Stanford property.
The student firemen live and train
at the firehouse during the entire
school year. They can perform almost
every fire-fighting task like
professionals. They know each
compartment in each of the
department's four big trucks. They can
operate the hoses, scramble up the
aerial ladder, and administer advanced
first aid.
The only thing they can't do is
drive the fire trucks.
A rookie student fireman undergoes
preliminary training in rescuing fire
victims, using the hose, and, of course,
putting out fires. Once he joins the

force, he must continue training from
one to five on weekends.
Training methods range from
lectures and first aid films in the
firehouse classroom to fire simulations
in the training tower* behind the
station. The tower enables students to
practice raising ladders, rushing up
stairs, and setting up hoses.
The most useful training and the
most enjoyable experience, according
to student fireman Bill Bamattre,
comes informally from the
professional firemen. Says Bamattre,
they provide on-the-scene advice and
"generally show us the ropes."
Amazing Rapport
In the meantime, students and paid
men develop an amazing rapport.
Students respect the paid men
because, according to one student
fireman, "they teach us a lot — not
just about work — but about life away

from a sheltered dorm."
Most of the paid men are young;
several have served in Vietnam.
Bamattre considers simply being
around them "a good learning
experience."

Since the paid men on duty at night
have little to do, students spend a lot
of time with them, talking, joking, and
playing pool, ping pong, and cards.
"The only drawback," says Bamattre,

"is that quite a few guys find it hard
to study."
Students live and work upstairs at
the station. Their quarters look like
any normal dorm. Two students share
a room filled with two desks,
bookcases, and bunk beds. At the end
of the hall is a large lounge, complete
with two refrigerators, a few
dilapidated couches, and a color
television.
Nighttime Schedules
Student firemen work on nighttime
schedules. Each student serves every
other night from seven to seven and
one afternoon each weekend.
An on-duty student signs in at
seven. Then he helps check over the
trucks. "After that," says Bamattre,
"it's your own time." He can attend a
nighttime class, as long as he remains
ready to respond to a fire signal. If
anyone pulls a fire alarm, the fire
station horn blasts sixteen times, and
the student must report at once.
Even though large fires rarely occur
at Stanford, firemen don't lead an
idyllic life. Warns one student, "If the
campus breaks loose, this isn't a fun

place to be."
During the riots in the past few
years, student firemen had to stand by
all night. During a bomb threat like
the ones this year, they must evaculate
the building and often must help
search for the bomb.
Free Room
For their work students receive free
room and about $160 a month. The
pay varies with seniority. In addition,
nine of them have the chance to work
on a professional fireman's schedule
and pay during the summer.
Students must obey ostensibly
strict rules of conduct. Women may
visit their quarters between one and
five p.m. with the permission of the
captain on duty. After five, they are
not allowed. Liquor is also forbidden.
Except for flagrant violations,
however, captains do not enforce the
rules strictly.
Variety Of Types
The present group of student
firemen comprises a variety of types.
The number of students in each class
splits fairly evenly. Most of the
students became firemen in their
sophomore year and stay until they

graduate.
Their majors range from
engineering to anthropology. Over half
of them belong to fraternities, where
they eat their meals, and Bamattre
estimates there are about five
Christians.
All the students, however, passed
through the Financial Aid Office
before receiving the job. Most of them
heard about the job from friends;
some heard directly from the Office.
If a student wants to become a
fireman, it helps for him to come
around the firehouse, preferably on
Saturdays. The students now working
there may recommend friends for
open positions; although the students
have no direct say in the final decision,
Chief Jurian is likely to prefer
applicants whom either he or the
students know.
Technically, women students may
apply for the job. But, according to
state law, the firehouse does not offer
appropriate facilities for women. The
students have only one bathroom; for
women to live there, another
bathroom might have to be installed.
