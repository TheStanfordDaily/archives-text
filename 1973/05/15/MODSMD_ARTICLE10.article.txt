# Watergate And The Fabric Of The Republic
## Our Future Is Not Beyond Control 
### 
Allard K. Lawenstein

The unprecedented events and
revelations of the past few months
should make it unnecessary to
stress that we cannot afford the
customary "off-year" period of
detachment or disengagement.
The most scrofulous
administration in our history is
tottering, and we must try to
influence the course of affairs in
this extraordinary situation with
all the determination and
resources we can command.
One cannot be expected not to
feel a kind of interior satisfaction
over the capsizing of a palace
guard whose combination of
arrogance, dishonesty, and
corruption has done such general
damage to the nation and to
cherished institutions. But we
must also shudder at what all this
has done to accelerate the decline
of the credibility of all politics
and of all government, and to
further erode the influence of
morality and high purpose in
shaping the public's attitude
toward its governance. Thus, in
addition to exposing wrong-doing

and bringing the guilty to justice,
we must assess the extent of the
damage and search out ways to
repair, protect, and improve the
fabric of the Republic. We must
examine what has happened to us
as a people during the cumulative
tragedy of the last ten years, and
we must think out what we want
next: How did we get from there
to here r . What went wrong? How
do we go about setting things
right?
Meanwhile, there is the
additional task of defending much
that is hopeful and good against
continuing assault. One might
hope that the Administration,
with its prestige in tatters, would
abandon at least some of the
politics which have divided and
weakened a country weary of
discord and division. But so far
there is little to sustain such a
hope.
Bombing
The effort to justify years of
horror in Indochina has extended
to December-scale bombing in
Cambodia, now without a scrap of

legal or constitutional sanction.
The national outcry for
reordered priorities has been
twisted into the excision from the
national budget of some of its
most necessary and hopeful
ingredients — and to achieve this
strange end even stranger
procedures are concocted,
including the ignoring of laws
duly enacted whenever they don't
suit the President.
Newsmen who insist on
upholding the First Amendment
face jail, while special "privileges"
are discovered to shield executive
bureaucrats who break the law.
Compassion
The famous "compassion"
which Henry Kissinger seeks for
liars and crooks in high places is
not sufficiently expansive to
apply to the unwillingly
unemployed, or to Cambodian
peasants, or to welfare mothers,
or to draft resisters, or to reatrded
children.
"Strict constructionism"
vanishes (and the Constituion
reels) under bombings,
impoundments, and
concealments, while some of the
highest law-enforcement agencies
and officials in the land
rationalize and sometimes
organize crimes, burglarize
people's files and burn their own,
and peddle illegal influence while
waving banners touting law, order,
and honor.
Meanwhile, the vital aspects of
the national agenda remain
neglected, though not even the
current Ambassador to India is
now likely to try to describe this
neglect as benign.
But this sad, apalling, and
sinister mess provides
opportunities almost as extensive
as the dangers. The quality of
Presidential leadership is clearer to
millions of Americans, and people
of all persuasions are disgusted as
seldom in the past. It begins to be
generally understood that men
who lie about buggings can lie
about bombings, that those who
find "honor" in the Vietnam
involvement are the same people
who found honor in degrading the
F. 8.1., and that some who rode to
power exploiting fears of crime
used power, once attained, to
commit crimes and to shield
criminals. So now it should be
easier to focus attention and
harness energies to deal effectively
with real problems, and to forge
new alliances out of shared
frustrations. Everyone determined
to end the corruption of the
public arena and to prevent the
dismantling of much of what has
been most promising in America
since World War II should now be
able to join together.
Join Together
The end of the fighting in
Vietnam should make possible the
end of the fighting about Vietnam
in the Democratic Party and
among all Americans alarmed by
the attitudes and tactics of the
Nixon Administration. To refight
the past in the midst of this
present is tc invite renewed defeat
in the future. Wouldn't it be more
useful to join together to try to
prevent even more privilege from
flowing to the too-privileged, and
to try to restore constitutional
balance and protect the general
liberties? And then to use the
watershed of Watergate to elect a
different leadership in 1974 and
1976?
What America needs now is the
involvement and unified efforts of
concerned and outraged people,
not what Burke once called the
"lumpish acquiescence" of a
citizenry grown cynical about its
capacity to end wrong-doing.
One dangerous side-effect of
last fall's election is that some
otherwise sensible people now

seem to believe that the ideas and
programs we have worked for are
unacceptable to a majority of
Americans.
Demagogues
There will always be moments
when people of principle find
themselves swimming upstream.
There will always be sensitivities
that unscrupulous, ambitious
people can seek to manipulate to
their own advantage.
But whatever else November
1972 was, it was not a repudiation
of the Roosevelt-Kennedy
tradition. The desperate
maneuverings of demagogues
determined to divert attention
and misstate choices show how
clearly the President and his
surrogates understood this central
political reality. We must
understand it as clearly, and act
accordingly: to clarify what the
Administration seeks to confuse,
to unify whom the
Administration seeks to polarize.
One sad fact underscored by
the voting is how many Americans
are losing faith in the electoral
process. Mandates and coattails,
trends and inconsistencies, all
must be argued against the
backdrop of record numbers of
citizens refusing to vote for
anyone in an election featuring
presidential candidates whose
goals and programs offered very
real choices. We failed to make
those choices clear and compelling
to most voters. But that is a very
different problem than we would
face if most voters had
understood the choices and were
prepared to vote for injustice, and
against their own best interests in
the process.
Now More .. .
So now more than ever we
must work to inform and arouse
opinion, and to do that effectively
we must offer honest and
intelligent leadership that can
articulate and inspire. This will
not be easy in the face of the
wealth and power to distort now
concentrated in the White House,
and in the wake of bullets that
destroyed those best equipped to
lead the effort. But the fact that
these things are not easily done
should propel us into working
harder to do them, if we
understand the stakes and care as
we have professed to care about
the outcome.
We are not at a high point in
the annals of the Republic. But
there is reason for hope, and
where there is reason for hope,
there is incentive for work.
Certainly there is no excuse for
quitting when there is so much to
do — so many wrongs to right, so
many wounds to heal.
Robert Kennedy once wrote,
"Our future may lie beyond our
vision, but it is not beyond our

control. It is the shaping impulse
of America that neither fate nor
nature nor the irresistable tides of
history, but the work of our own
hands, matched to reason and
principle, will determine our
destiny. There is pride in that,
even arrogance, but there is also
experience and truth. In any
event, it is the only way we can
live."
What we need now is to end
the damaging detour that has led
to such waste of lives and
resources and has so hobbled the
national spirit. Given the urgency
and virtue of our goals, we would
have to work for them even if
they seemed impossible. But we
should know they are not
impossible — and that knowledge
should increase our determination
to work to achieve them. In any
event, that is the only way we can
live.

understand the stakes and care as
we have professed to care about
the outcome.
We are not at a high point in
the annals of the Republic. But
there is reason for hope, and
where there is reason for hope,
there is incentive for work.
Certainly there is no excuse for
quitting when there is so much to
do — so many wrongs to right, so
many wounds to heal.
Robert Kennedy once wrote,
"Our future may lie beyond our
vision, but it is not beyond our

control. It is the shaping impulse
of America that neither fate nor
nature nor the irresistable tides of
history, but the work of our own
hands, matched to reason and
principle, will determine our
destiny. There is pride in that,
even arrogance, but there is also
experience and truth. In any
event, it is the only way we can
live."
What we need now is to end
the damaging detour that has led
to such waste of lives and
resources and has so hobbled the
national spirit. Given the urgency
and virtue of our goals, we would
have to work for them even if
they seemed impossible. But we
should know they are not
impossible — and that knowledge
should increase our determination
to work to achieve them. In any
event, that is the only way we can
live.

The unprecedented events and
revelations of the past few months
should make it unnecessary to
stress that we cannot afford the
customary "off-year" period of
detachment or disengagement.
The most scrofulous
administration in our history is
tottering, and we must try to
influence the course of affairs in
this extraordinary situation with
all the determination and
resources we can command.
One cannot be expected not to
feel a kind of interior satisfaction
over the capsizing of a palace
guard whose combination of
arrogance, dishonesty, and
corruption has done such general
damage to the nation and to
cherished institutions. But we
must also shudder at what all this
has done to accelerate the decline
of the credibility of all politics
and of all government, and to
further erode the influence of
morality and high purpose in
shaping the public's attitude
toward its governance. Thus, in
addition to exposing wrong-doing

and bringing the guilty to justice,
we must assess the extent of the
damage and search out ways to
repair, protect, and improve the
fabric of the Republic. We must
examine what has happened to us
as a people during the cumulative
tragedy of the last ten years, and
we must think out what we want
next: How did we get from there
to here r . What went wrong? How
do we go about setting things
right?
Meanwhile, there is the
additional task of defending much
that is hopeful and good against
continuing assault. One might
hope that the Administration,
with its prestige in tatters, would
abandon at least some of the
politics which have divided and
weakened a country weary of
discord and division. But so far
there is little to sustain such a
hope.
Bombing
The effort to justify years of
horror in Indochina has extended
to December-scale bombing in
Cambodia, now without a scrap of

legal or constitutional sanction.
The national outcry for
reordered priorities has been
twisted into the excision from the
national budget of some of its
most necessary and hopeful
ingredients — and to achieve this
strange end even stranger
procedures are concocted,
including the ignoring of laws
duly enacted whenever they don't
suit the President.
Newsmen who insist on
upholding the First Amendment
face jail, while special "privileges"
are discovered to shield executive
bureaucrats who break the law.
Compassion
The famous "compassion"
which Henry Kissinger seeks for
liars and crooks in high places is
not sufficiently expansive to
apply to the unwillingly
unemployed, or to Cambodian
peasants, or to welfare mothers,
or to draft resisters, or to reatrded
children.
"Strict constructionism"
vanishes (and the Constituion
reels) under bombings,
impoundments, and
concealments, while some of the
highest law-enforcement agencies
and officials in the land
rationalize and sometimes
organize crimes, burglarize
people's files and burn their own,
and peddle illegal influence while
waving banners touting law, order,
and honor.
Meanwhile, the vital aspects of
the national agenda remain
neglected, though not even the
current Ambassador to India is
now likely to try to describe this
neglect as benign.
But this sad, apalling, and
sinister mess provides
opportunities almost as extensive
as the dangers. The quality of
Presidential leadership is clearer to
millions of Americans, and people
of all persuasions are disgusted as
seldom in the past. It begins to be
generally understood that men
who lie about buggings can lie
about bombings, that those who
find "honor" in the Vietnam
involvement are the same people
who found honor in degrading the
F. 8.1., and that some who rode to
power exploiting fears of crime
used power, once attained, to
commit crimes and to shield
criminals. So now it should be
easier to focus attention and
harness energies to deal effectively
with real problems, and to forge
new alliances out of shared
frustrations. Everyone determined
to end the corruption of the
public arena and to prevent the
dismantling of much of what has
been most promising in America
since World War II should now be
able to join together.
Join Together
The end of the fighting in
Vietnam should make possible the
end of the fighting about Vietnam
in the Democratic Party and
among all Americans alarmed by
the attitudes and tactics of the
Nixon Administration. To refight
the past in the midst of this
present is tc invite renewed defeat
in the future. Wouldn't it be more
useful to join together to try to
prevent even more privilege from
flowing to the too-privileged, and
to try to restore constitutional
balance and protect the general
liberties? And then to use the
watershed of Watergate to elect a
different leadership in 1974 and
1976?
What America needs now is the
involvement and unified efforts of
concerned and outraged people,
not what Burke once called the
"lumpish acquiescence" of a
citizenry grown cynical about its
capacity to end wrong-doing.
One dangerous side-effect of
last fall's election is that some
otherwise sensible people now

seem to believe that the ideas and
programs we have worked for are
unacceptable to a majority of
Americans.
Demagogues
There will always be moments
when people of principle find
themselves swimming upstream.
There will always be sensitivities
that unscrupulous, ambitious
people can seek to manipulate to
their own advantage.
But whatever else November
1972 was, it was not a repudiation
of the Roosevelt-Kennedy
tradition. The desperate
maneuverings of demagogues
determined to divert attention
and misstate choices show how
clearly the President and his
surrogates understood this central
political reality. We must
understand it as clearly, and act
accordingly: to clarify what the
Administration seeks to confuse,
to unify whom the
Administration seeks to polarize.
One sad fact underscored by
the voting is how many Americans
are losing faith in the electoral
process. Mandates and coattails,
trends and inconsistencies, all
must be argued against the
backdrop of record numbers of
citizens refusing to vote for
anyone in an election featuring
presidential candidates whose
goals and programs offered very
real choices. We failed to make
those choices clear and compelling
to most voters. But that is a very
different problem than we would
face if most voters had
understood the choices and were
prepared to vote for injustice, and
against their own best interests in
the process.
Now More .. .
So now more than ever we
must work to inform and arouse
opinion, and to do that effectively
we must offer honest and
intelligent leadership that can
articulate and inspire. This will
not be easy in the face of the
wealth and power to distort now
concentrated in the White House,
and in the wake of bullets that
destroyed those best equipped to
lead the effort. But the fact that
these things are not easily done
should propel us into working
harder to do them, if we
understand the stakes and care as
we have professed to care about
the outcome.
We are not at a high point in
the annals of the Republic. But
there is reason for hope, and
where there is reason for hope,
there is incentive for work.
Certainly there is no excuse for

determined to divert attention
and misstate choices show how
clearly the President and his
surrogates understood this central
political reality. We must
understand it as clearly, and act
accordingly: to clarify what the
Administration seeks to confuse,
to unify whom the
Administration seeks to polarize.
One sad fact underscored by
the voting is how many Americans
are losing faith in the electoral
process. Mandates and coattails,
trends and inconsistencies, all
must be argued against the
backdrop of record numbers of
citizens refusing to vote for
anyone in an election featuring
presidential candidates whose
goals and programs offered very
real choices. We failed to make
those choices clear and compelling
to most voters. But that is a very
different problem than we would
face if most voters had
understood the choices and were
prepared to vote for injustice, and
against their own best interests in
the process.
Now More .. .
So now more than ever we
must work to inform and arouse
opinion, and to do that effectively
we must offer honest and
intelligent leadership that can
articulate and inspire. This will
not be easy in the face of the
wealth and power to distort now
concentrated in the White House,
and in the wake of bullets that
destroyed those best equipped to
lead the effort. But the fact that
these things are not easily done
should propel us into working
harder to do them, if we
understand the stakes and care as
we have professed to care about
the outcome.
We are not at a high point in
the annals of the Republic. But
there is reason for hope, and
where there is reason for hope,
there is incentive for work.
Certainly there is no excuse for
quitting when there is so much to
do — so many wrongs to right, so
many wounds to heal.
Robert Kennedy once wrote,
"Our future may lie beyond our
vision, but it is not beyond our

control. It is the shaping impulse
of America that neither fate nor
nature nor the irresistable tides of
history, but the work of our own
hands, matched to reason and
principle, will determine our
destiny. There is pride in that,
even arrogance, but there is also
experience and truth. In any
event, it is the only way we can
live."
What we need now is to end
the damaging detour that has led
to such waste of lives and
resources and has so hobbled the
national spirit. Given the urgency
and virtue of our goals, we would
have to work for them even if
they seemed impossible. But we
should know they are not
impossible — and that knowledge
should increase our determination
to work to achieve them. In any
event, that is the only way we can
live.

The unprecedented events and
revelations of the past few months
should make it unnecessary to
stress that we cannot afford the
customary "off-year" period of
detachment or disengagement.
The most scrofulous
administration in our history is
tottering, and we must try to
influence the course of affairs in
this extraordinary situation with
all the determination and
resources we can command.
One cannot be expected not to
feel a kind of interior satisfaction
over the capsizing of a palace
guard whose combination of
arrogance, dishonesty, and
corruption has done such general
damage to the nation and to
cherished institutions. But we
must also shudder at what all this
has done to accelerate the decline
of the credibility of all politics
and of all government, and to
further erode the influence of
morality and high purpose in
shaping the public's attitude
toward its governance. Thus, in
addition to exposing wrong-doing

and bringing the guilty to justice,
we must assess the extent of the
damage and search out ways to
repair, protect, and improve the
fabric of the Republic. We must
examine what has happened to us
as a people during the cumulative
tragedy of the last ten years, and
we must think out what we want
next: How did we get from there
to here r . What went wrong? How
do we go about setting things
right?
Meanwhile, there is the
additional task of defending much
that is hopeful and good against
continuing assault. One might
hope that the Administration,
with its prestige in tatters, would
abandon at least some of the
politics which have divided and
weakened a country weary of
discord and division. But so far
there is little to sustain such a
hope.
Bombing
The effort to justify years of
horror in Indochina has extended
to December-scale bombing in
Cambodia, now without a scrap of

legal or constitutional sanction.
The national outcry for
reordered priorities has been
twisted into the excision from the
national budget of some of its
most necessary and hopeful
ingredients — and to achieve this
strange end even stranger
procedures are concocted,
including the ignoring of laws
duly enacted whenever they don't
suit the President.
Newsmen who insist on
upholding the First Amendment
face jail, while special "privileges"
are discovered to shield executive
bureaucrats who break the law.
Compassion
The famous "compassion"
which Henry Kissinger seeks for
liars and crooks in high places is
not sufficiently expansive to
apply to the unwillingly
unemployed, or to Cambodian
peasants, or to welfare mothers,
or to draft resisters, or to reatrded
children.
"Strict constructionism"
vanishes (and the Constituion
reels) under bombings,
impoundments, and
concealments, while some of the
highest law-enforcement agencies
and officials in the land
rationalize and sometimes
organize crimes, burglarize
people's files and burn their own,
and peddle illegal influence while
waving banners touting law, order,
and honor.
Meanwhile, the vital aspects of
the national agenda remain
neglected, though not even the
current Ambassador to India is
now likely to try to describe this
neglect as benign.
But this sad, apalling, and
sinister mess provides
opportunities almost as extensive
as the dangers. The quality of
Presidential leadership is clearer to
millions of Americans, and people
of all persuasions are disgusted as
seldom in the past. It begins to be
generally understood that men
who lie about buggings can lie
about bombings, that those who
find "honor" in the Vietnam
involvement are the same people
who found honor in degrading the
F. 8.1., and that some who rode to
power exploiting fears of crime
used power, once attained, to
commit crimes and to shield
criminals. So now it should be
easier to focus attention and
harness energies to deal effectively
with real problems, and to forge
new alliances out of shared
frustrations. Everyone determined
to end the corruption of the
public arena and to prevent the
dismantling of much of what has
been most promising in America
since World War II should now be
able to join together.
Join Together
The end of the fighting in
Vietnam should make possible the
end of the fighting about Vietnam
in the Democratic Party and
among all Americans alarmed by
the attitudes and tactics of the
Nixon Administration. To refight
the past in the midst of this
present is tc invite renewed defeat
in the future. Wouldn't it be more
useful to join together to try to
prevent even more privilege from
flowing to the too-privileged, and
to try to restore constitutional
balance and protect the general
liberties? And then to use the
watershed of Watergate to elect a
different leadership in 1974 and
1976?
What America needs now is the
involvement and unified efforts of
concerned and outraged people,
not what Burke once called the
"lumpish acquiescence" of a
citizenry grown cynical about its
capacity to end wrong-doing.
One dangerous side-effect of
last fall's election is that some
otherwise sensible people now

seem to believe that the ideas and
programs we have worked for are
unacceptable to a majority of
Americans.
Demagogues
There will always be moments
when people of principle find
themselves swimming upstream.
There will always be sensitivities
that unscrupulous, ambitious
people can seek to manipulate to
their own advantage.
But whatever else November
1972 was, it was not a repudiation
of the Roosevelt-Kennedy
tradition. The desperate
maneuverings of demagogues
determined to divert attention

end of the fighting about Vietnam
in the Democratic Party and
among all Americans alarmed by
the attitudes and tactics of the
Nixon Administration. To refight
the past in the midst of this
present is tc invite renewed defeat
in the future. Wouldn't it be more
useful to join together to try to
prevent even more privilege from
flowing to the too-privileged, and
to try to restore constitutional
balance and protect the general
liberties? And then to use the
watershed of Watergate to elect a
different leadership in 1974 and
1976?
What America needs now is the
involvement and unified efforts of
concerned and outraged people,
not what Burke once called the
"lumpish acquiescence" of a
citizenry grown cynical about its
capacity to end wrong-doing.
One dangerous side-effect of
last fall's election is that some
otherwise sensible people now

seem to believe that the ideas and
programs we have worked for are
unacceptable to a majority of
Americans.
Demagogues
There will always be moments
when people of principle find
themselves swimming upstream.
There will always be sensitivities
that unscrupulous, ambitious
people can seek to manipulate to
their own advantage.
But whatever else November
1972 was, it was not a repudiation
of the Roosevelt-Kennedy
tradition. The desperate
maneuverings of demagogues
determined to divert attention
and misstate choices show how
clearly the President and his
surrogates understood this central
political reality. We must
understand it as clearly, and act
accordingly: to clarify what the
Administration seeks to confuse,
to unify whom the
Administration seeks to polarize.
One sad fact underscored by
the voting is how many Americans
are losing faith in the electoral
process. Mandates and coattails,
trends and inconsistencies, all
must be argued against the
backdrop of record numbers of
citizens refusing to vote for
anyone in an election featuring
presidential candidates whose
goals and programs offered very
real choices. We failed to make
those choices clear and compelling
to most voters. But that is a very
different problem than we would
face if most voters had
understood the choices and were
prepared to vote for injustice, and
against their own best interests in
the process.
Now More .. .
So now more than ever we
must work to inform and arouse
opinion, and to do that effectively
we must offer honest and
intelligent leadership that can
articulate and inspire. This will
not be easy in the face of the
wealth and power to distort now
concentrated in the White House,
and in the wake of bullets that
destroyed those best equipped to
lead the effort. But the fact that
these things are not easily done
should propel us into working
harder to do them, if we
understand the stakes and care as
we have professed to care about
the outcome.
We are not at a high point in
the annals of the Republic. But
there is reason for hope, and
where there is reason for hope,
there is incentive for work.
Certainly there is no excuse for
quitting when there is so much to
do — so many wrongs to right, so
many wounds to heal.
Robert Kennedy once wrote,
"Our future may lie beyond our
vision, but it is not beyond our

control. It is the shaping impulse
of America that neither fate nor
nature nor the irresistable tides of
history, but the work of our own
hands, matched to reason and
principle, will determine our
destiny. There is pride in that,
even arrogance, but there is also
experience and truth. In any
event, it is the only way we can
live."
What we need now is to end
the damaging detour that has led
to such waste of lives and
resources and has so hobbled the
national spirit. Given the urgency
and virtue of our goals, we would
have to work for them even if
they seemed impossible. But we
should know they are not
impossible — and that knowledge
should increase our determination
to work to achieve them. In any
event, that is the only way we can
live.

Chairman of Americans for

The unprecedented events and
revelations of the past few months
should make it unnecessary to
stress that we cannot afford the
customary "off-year" period of
detachment or disengagement.
The most scrofulous
administration in our history is
tottering, and we must try to
influence the course of affairs in
this extraordinary situation with
all the determination and
resources we can command.
One cannot be expected not to
feel a kind of interior satisfaction
over the capsizing of a palace
guard whose combination of
arrogance, dishonesty, and
corruption has done such general
damage to the nation and to
cherished institutions. But we
must also shudder at what all this
has done to accelerate the decline
of the credibility of all politics
and of all government, and to
further erode the influence of
morality and high purpose in
shaping the public's attitude
toward its governance. Thus, in
addition to exposing wrong-doing

and bringing the guilty to justice,
we must assess the extent of the
damage and search out ways to
repair, protect, and improve the
fabric of the Republic. We must
examine what has happened to us
as a people during the cumulative
tragedy of the last ten years, and
we must think out what we want
next: How did we get from there
to here r . What went wrong? How
do we go about setting things
right?
Meanwhile, there is the
additional task of defending much
that is hopeful and good against
continuing assault. One might
hope that the Administration,
with its prestige in tatters, would
abandon at least some of the
politics which have divided and
weakened a country weary of
discord and division. But so far
there is little to sustain such a
hope.
Bombing
The effort to justify years of
horror in Indochina has extended
to December-scale bombing in
Cambodia, now without a scrap of

legal or constitutional sanction.
The national outcry for
reordered priorities has been
twisted into the excision from the
national budget of some of its
most necessary and hopeful
ingredients — and to achieve this
strange end even stranger
procedures are concocted,
including the ignoring of laws
duly enacted whenever they don't
suit the President.
Newsmen who insist on
upholding the First Amendment
face jail, while special "privileges"
are discovered to shield executive
bureaucrats who break the law.
Compassion
The famous "compassion"
which Henry Kissinger seeks for
liars and crooks in high places is
not sufficiently expansive to
apply to the unwillingly
unemployed, or to Cambodian
peasants, or to welfare mothers,
or to draft resisters, or to reatrded
children.
"Strict constructionism"
vanishes (and the Constituion
reels) under bombings,
impoundments, and
concealments, while some of the
highest law-enforcement agencies
and officials in the land
rationalize and sometimes
organize crimes, burglarize
people's files and burn their own,
and peddle illegal influence while
waving banners touting law, order,
and honor.
Meanwhile, the vital aspects of
the national agenda remain
neglected, though not even the
current Ambassador to India is
now likely to try to describe this
neglect as benign.
But this sad, apalling, and
sinister mess provides
opportunities almost as extensive
as the dangers. The quality of
Presidential leadership is clearer to
millions of Americans, and people
of all persuasions are disgusted as
seldom in the past. It begins to be
generally understood that men
who lie about buggings can lie
about bombings, that those who
find "honor" in the Vietnam
involvement are the same people
who found honor in degrading the
F. 8.1., and that some who rode to
power exploiting fears of crime
used power, once attained, to
commit crimes and to shield
criminals. So now it should be
easier to focus attention and
harness energies to deal effectively
with real problems, and to forge
new alliances out of shared
frustrations. Everyone determined
to end the corruption of the
public arena and to prevent the
dismantling of much of what has
been most promising in America
since World War II should now be
able to join together.
Join Together
The end of the fighting in
Vietnam should make possible the
end of the fighting about Vietnam
in the Democratic Party and
among all Americans alarmed by
the attitudes and tactics of the
Nixon Administration. To refight
the past in the midst of this
present is tc invite renewed defeat
in the future. Wouldn't it be more
