Congratulations
Editor:
Having read several sides of the
Phi Delt story I would like to
respond with congratulations, to
the Phi Delts. The fact that
fraternity parties have once again
become such that they are
regarded by some as excessively
wild is, to me, a hopeful sign.
It does not greatly surprise me
that our liberal institution
(Stanford) feels itself upset over
the incident. Although it has given
up its in loco parentis functions —
no longer attempting to force
moral decisions upon us as though
we were children — the University
has not given up its collective
political "conscience." The Phi
Delts will be investigated and
perhaps prosecuted for their
transgressions of the political and
economic beliefs of the
"community." The political
transgression was (hysterically)
pointed out by Flocks and
Jameson. The economic
transgression was simply that the
incident was an example of
relatively free enterprise in action,
an uncommon occurrence
hereabouts.
If some people want to be
outraged by the existence of an
opportunity for collegiate man
and women to learn something of
men, women, themselves, and the
free market, then let them be
outraged, but don't let them
control the rest of us.
