# Seven Buildings Get Sprinklers
## 
### 
Seven major Stanford buildings
will be protected from fire by
means of a sprinkling system,
following Board of Trustees
approval.
The seven include all Law
School, Memorial Church, Old
Union, Women's Clubhouse,
School of Education, The Knoll,
and the center wing of Encina
Hall.
Dan DeYoung, director of
plant services, said the installation
process will be lengthy because
each system has to be
custom-designed for the building
it serves.
Estimated cost of the project is
$465,000 part of a $3.6 million
"housekeeping" program
approved by the board to be
spread over the next five to 10
years.
Also budgeted are
improvements to the University's
utilities service including the
steam plant, electrical, and chilled
water air conditioning system.
Much of the steam and
electrical plant improvements will
be necessary because of the
proposed expansion of the
Stanford Medical Center,
DeYoung said. Equipment will be
"beefed up" to prevent blackouts
as power demand increases.
Included in the project is a
note on the deepening national

fuel crisis â€” a proposed
30,000-gallon fuel oil tank to
maintain operations at the Steam
Plant when natural gas runs short.
"The winter, for the first time
in several years, the University
had to burn fuel oil instead of
natural gas for three days"
DeYoung observed.
Seven major buildings which
have their own air conditioning
systems will be converted to the
central chilled water system.
These are the Medical Center,
Varian Physics, McCullough
Engineering, Meyer Library,
Graduate School of Business,
Herrin Biology Laboratories, and
the Hoover Institution.
Parking areas displaced by
hospital expansion are already
being relocated and paved, and
Quarry Road will be cut through
to Campus Drive.
Campus Drive also will be
diverted at Alvarado Row
diagonally to connect with Lasuen
at Granada. This will be a single
two-lane road.
This will be accomplished prior
to the completion of the new Law
School in August 1974. Stillman
House will be relocated to make
way for the road, which will allow
expansion of Parking Lot J and
eliminate "extreme traffic hazards
and congestion," according to
DeYoung's report.
