## Connally Assigned Healer Role 
### 
From The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - John Connally
has his first assignment as a
Republican, and it is made to
order for a man with the peculiar
problems of the former chief
Democrat for Nixon.
As special adviser to the
President, Connally will have a
hand in putting the White Houe
image back together â€” a healer
and mender with a role much like

the one which launched his boss
to the Oval Office.
At the same time, Connally
didn't want or get a full-time
Washington job that would tie
him in too closely with the
Watergate upheaval. He can advise
and minister to his party's wounds
from a position where the scandal
is least likely to rub off on him.
The appointment Thursday
came the morning after Nixon

made it clear he is going to do all
he can to get the nation's
attention back on the choice it
made in last year's election and
off the seamier revelations about
the campaign.
Connally's dissident Democrat
movement played a big part in
Nixon's landslide, and his
presence in the new Nixon's
official family may be expected to
return national thought to the
issues of 1972 and away from the
less favorable issues of 1973.
Nixon told a fund-raising
dinner last week he would not
allow Watergate to deter him from
"achieving the great goals that an
overwhelming majority of the
American people elected us to
achieve in November of 1972."
But if he is to do that, Nixon
must first get his New American
Majority to renew its concern for
the national issues which turned it
to him last year. Connally is a
good start toward that.
Connally's switch to the GOP,
coming at the height of the
Watergate storm, has been
probably the biggest boost the
embattled party has had in its
crisis and undoubtedly will be
appreciated for years to come.
The former Democratic
governor of Texas and treasury
secretary in Nixon's first term
cabinet won't move to
Washington, but he will be
available to help Nixon reshape
his administration and lend his
lustre where it is sorely needed.
If the Nixon administration
can overcome the scandal which

party officials openly complain is
hurting fund raising and
threatening election grief in 1974,
Connally undoubtedly will get a
nice share of the credit. If it
doesn't, he isn't likely to get the
blame.
Coincidentally, it was in a
similar role that Nixon began to
pick up the pieces of a shattered
party in 1964 after Barry
Goldwater's humiliating
presidential defeat.
Aiding party candidates, Nixon
contributed largely to surprising
successes in 1966. His reputation
as a savior of the party was
perhaps the biggest ingredient in
Nixon's own presidential
nomination two years later.
