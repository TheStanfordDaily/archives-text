# Xerox Corp. Pledges $500,000 Donation

Xerox Corporation has made a
$500,000 pledge to the Campaign
for Stanford, University President
Richard W. Lyman announced last
week.
The pledge is in addition to
support which Stanford annually
receives from Xerox in the form
of research grants and
membership in the University's
affiliates programs.
One-third of the Xerox pledge
will be used to help provide
facilities for the Computer
Science Department; one-third
will be added to a fund for a new
Applied Physics building; and
one-third will endow graduate
fellowships with a preference for
minorities.
Commenting on the pledge,
President Lyman said: "By its
recognition of our capital needs,
both for buildings and
endowment, Xerox is making a
most significant contribution to
the University and to our
Campaign."
Lyman was especially pleased

that one-third of the pledge would
be used to endow fellowships. "It
is particularly important," he said,
"that talented minority students
who do not have the financial
resources to support themselves
be encouraged to pursue
professional careers."
That part of the Xerox pledge
directed to the Computer Science
Department will help support
what is widely considered as one
of the best such departments in
the nation. It has 13 regular
faculty members and over 100
graduate students. More than
2,600 Stanford students each year
take courses in computing.
The Xerox support for a new
Applied Physics building will help
to provide a central facility for a
department whose field of
teaching and research lies between
pure science and engineering. Its
activities concentrate largely in
areas of physics that give promise
of having potentially useful
applications.
