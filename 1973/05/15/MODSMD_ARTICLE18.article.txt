# Trust Endows New Professorship
## 
### 
The University has received a grant of $750,000
to establish an endowed professorship honoring
William R. Kenan, Jr., a distinguished chemist,
engineer, farmer and industrialist who died in 1965.
In making the award, the trustees of the William
R. Kenan Jr. Charitable Trust stated their wish "to
support and encourage a scholar-teacher whose
enthusiasm for learning, commitment to teaching
and sincere personal interest in students will
enhance the learning process and make an effective
contribution to your undergraduate community."
Under the terms of the grant, the President of
the University is responsible for the selection of the
Kenan Professor and the departmen with which he
or she will be affiliated.
To the extent that the annual return on the
endowment is not required to pay the Kenan
professor's salary, it will be used in connection with
the professor's teaching activities, including
secretarial and other assistance and travel.
University President Richard W. Lyman said,
"This is an unusual gift both in its size and in the
latitude it allows the University to recognize faculty
distinction.
"Over the years, one would expect the Kenan
chair to be held by scholar-teachers in many schools
and departments throughout the University,
Stanford is profoundly grateful for the award."
William R. Kenan Jr. was born in Wilmington,
N.C., on April 30, 1872, and graduated from the
University of North Carolina in 1894 with a
bachelor of science degree.
While in college and for several years thereafter,
he was engaged in chemical research at the
University of North Carolina. Subsequently he was a

chemical and mechanical engineering adviser, and
installed several important plants for the carbide
and acetylene industry in the U.S., Australia, and
Germany.
For more than 60 years Kenan was an active
member of the American Chemical Society, the
American Institute of Electrical Engineers, and a
charter member of the American-Electro Chemical
Society.
Shortly after the turn of the century, Kenan was
invited by Henry M. Flagler to join him as a
consulting and construction engineer for his
expanding empire of railroad, hotels, utilities, and
other enterprises along the east coast of Florida.
From 1924 to the time of his death, Kenan was
president and part owner of the Flagler System
companies. In Lockport, N.Y., he was part owner of
the Western Block Co., manufacturers of tackle
blocks for industrial and marine use. He also owned
Randleigh Farm, which was noted as a model Jersey
dairy cattle farm operated for experimental and
breeding purposes.
Kenan's strong convictions with respect to
education prompted this statement in his will: "I
have always believed firmly that a good education is
the most cherished gift an individual can receive and
it is my sincere hope that the provisions of this
Article will result in a substantial benefit to
mankind."
To support and perpetuate his wishes Kenan
provided for the William R. Kenan Jr. Charitable
Trust, and named A. Roberts MacMannis; John L.
Gray Jr. a partner in the law firm of Dewey,
Ballantine, Bushby, Palmer & Wood; and Morgan
Guaranty Trust Company of New York as trustees.
