# New Defense Chief Earns Anti-Bureaucratic Image

WASHINGTON - James R.
Schlesinger, nominated Thursday
as the nation's new defense chief,
is an unlikely boss of generals.
He's a pipe-smoking former
professor who likes to watch
birds.
But the 43-year-old Schlesinger
has earned a reputation as a tough
administrator having no fear of
shaking up the bureaucracy during
his four years with the Nixon
administration.
Schlesinger, a dedicated family
man with eight children, will take
over the defense secretary's post
after only four months as head of
the Central Intelligence Agency,

the nation's spy unit.
Before that, the tall,
prematurely gray Schlesinger
headed the Atomic Energy
Commission for little over a year.
He began his federal work,
however, in the old budget
bureau, now the Office of
Management and Budget. It was
there that he attracted President
Nixon's attention, heading a
survey in 1971 to evaluate the
nation's intelligence-gathering
activities. The study led to a
sweeping reorganization of the
nation's intelligence effort and
more prestige for Schlesinger.
Schlesinger is a Harvard-trained
economist who taught that

subject at the University of
Virginia. He is no stranger to the
issues he will face as defense chief.
He served at the Rand Corp.
"think tank" at Santa
Monica . . . where he advised the
government on nuclear arms and
other national-security subjects.
Schlesinger is becoming one of
the administration's
jack-of-all-trades in high federal
spots, even though he was not
Nixon's first choice for the
defense job. The man Schlesinger
will replace, Elliot Richardson,
and Treasury Secretary George P.
Shultz are among administration
officials who have moved from
one high job to another.
Although his CIA tenure was
brief, Schlesinger found himself in
an unusual role for a spy chief
Wednesday â€” testifying before
senators on the burglary of the
Los Angeles office of the
psychiatrist who treated Pentagon
papers defendant Daniel Ellsberg.
Schlesinger said the CIA was
ill-advised in giving technical aid
to highly placed White House
aides who used it to commit the
burglary. Although the technical
aid was given before Schlesinger
was named to head the agency, he
promised quick reforms.
