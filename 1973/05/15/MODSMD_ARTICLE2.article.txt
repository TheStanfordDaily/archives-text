# Chapel Dean Bars Black Muslim From Giving Speech In Mem Chu
## 
### KEVIN SMITH 
Dean of the Chapel Robert Hamerton-Kelly has denied
a request that Black Muslim Minister John Muhammad be
allowed to speak in Memorial Church this Thursday. The
request was made by Asst. Psychology Prof. Cedric X, a
Black Muslim.
Citing the "racist aspect" of the Black Muslim religion
as the major reason for his decision, Kelly stated, "I am
not objecting to the teaching of Islam as a whole," but
rather to the specific theology preached by the sect
herded by Elijah Muhammad "which I cannot in good
conscience allow to be represented in Memorial Church."
Kelly, who comes from South Africa, continued, "I
cannot allow black racism any more than I can allow
white racism. I would have to be satisfied by Mr. [John]
Muhammad on that issue."
Kelly said he had talked to X over the telephone last
Thursday and had requested a meeting with John
Muhammad to discover for himself whether the Black
Muslim religion was in fact racist. Kelly said he has not
heard from X since that time.
Insult To Muhammad
Although X claimed he did not recall Kelly's request
for a meeting between Kelly and John Muhammed, X
declared, "I could never do that because it would be an
insult to Minister Muhammad."
Commenting on Kelly's conception of the Black
Muslims, X declared, "The whole purpose of bringing
Minister Muhammad" to campus "was so that people
could hear for themselves the teachings" of the Islam
religion. X claimed the speech might clear up some of the
many "distortions" about the religion.

Although X called his conversation with Kelly "very
cordial," he sighed, "At this point I've almost given up
hope because there seems to be such intrasigence and
inflexibility" about the rules of the Church.
Asked why such a large auditorium was needed, X
replied, "The X-Shockley debate drew 1800, and I think a
lot of people came to hear about Islam as well as about
Shockley." He felt Muhammad would attract a similar
crowd.
Although X stressed that he would prefer Muhammad
to speak this week, he added, "I am not upset because I
feel sure he will appear" sometime in the near future.
ASSU Co-President Charles Ogletree, who is chairman
of the Black Students Union and the ASSU Speakers
Bureau, commented on Kelly's opinion of the Black
Muslims, "I think it's absurd that he would even suggest
such a thing. This is the first time the Honorable Elijah
Muhammad has allowed his representative from the West
Coast Temple of Islam to speak to an integrated audience
on a college campus. That in itself should be grounds for
letting him speak."
John Muhammad is minister of Elijah Muhammad's
Temple of Islam Number 26 in San Francisco and is Elijah
Muhammad's Bay Area representative.
Despite X's claim that Memorial Auditorium was being
used for another purpose Thursday night, Public Affairs
Director Thomas Bacchetti commented, "My recollection
is that Mem Aud was available that night," but that the
people bringing Muhammad to speak wanted to hold the
event in the Church. Bachetti said the speech could still be
held in Memorial Auditorium Thursday night if the
auditorium were in fact available.

Shockley." He felt Muhammad would attract a similar
crowd.
Although X stressed that he would prefer Muhammad
to speak this week, he added, "I am not upset because I
feel sure he will appear" sometime in the near future.
ASSU Co-President Charles Ogletree, who is chairman
of the Black Students Union and the ASSU Speakers
Bureau, commented on Kelly's opinion of the Black
Muslims, "I think it's absurd that he would even suggest
such a thing. This is the first time the Honorable Elijah
Muhammad has allowed his representative from the West
Coast Temple of Islam to speak to an integrated audience
on a college campus. That in itself should be grounds for
letting him speak."
John Muhammad is minister of Elijah Muhammad's
Temple of Islam Number 26 in San Francisco and is Elijah
Muhammad's Bay Area representative.
Despite X's claim that Memorial Auditorium was being
used for another purpose Thursday night, Public Affairs
Director Thomas Bacchetti commented, "My recollection
is that Mem Aud was available that night," but that the
people bringing Muhammad to speak wanted to hold the
event in the Church. Bachetti said the speech could still be
held in Memorial Auditorium Thursday night if the
auditorium were in fact available.
Dean of the Chapel Robert Hamerton-Kelly has denied
a request that Black Muslim Minister John Muhammad be
allowed to speak in Memorial Church this Thursday. The
request was made by Asst. Psychology Prof. Cedric X, a
Black Muslim.
Citing the "racist aspect" of the Black Muslim religion
as the major reason for his decision, Kelly stated, "I am
not objecting to the teaching of Islam as a whole," but
rather to the specific theology preached by the sect
herded by Elijah Muhammad "which I cannot in good
conscience allow to be represented in Memorial Church."
Kelly, who comes from South Africa, continued, "I
cannot allow black racism any more than I can allow
white racism. I would have to be satisfied by Mr. [John]
Muhammad on that issue."
Kelly said he had talked to X over the telephone last
Thursday and had requested a meeting with John
Muhammad to discover for himself whether the Black
Muslim religion was in fact racist. Kelly said he has not
heard from X since that time.
Insult To Muhammad
Although X claimed he did not recall Kelly's request
for a meeting between Kelly and John Muhammed, X
declared, "I could never do that because it would be an
insult to Minister Muhammad."
Commenting on Kelly's conception of the Black
Muslims, X declared, "The whole purpose of bringing
Minister Muhammad" to campus "was so that people
could hear for themselves the teachings" of the Islam
religion. X claimed the speech might clear up some of the
many "distortions" about the religion.

Although X called his conversation with Kelly "very
cordial," he sighed, "At this point I've almost given up
hope because there seems to be such intrasigence and
inflexibility" about the rules of the Church.
Asked why such a large auditorium was needed, X
replied, "The X-Shockley debate drew 1800, and I think a
lot of people came to hear about Islam as well as about
Shockley." He felt Muhammad would attract a similar
crowd.
Although X stressed that he would prefer Muhammad
to speak this week, he added, "I am not upset because I
feel sure he will appear" sometime in the near future.
