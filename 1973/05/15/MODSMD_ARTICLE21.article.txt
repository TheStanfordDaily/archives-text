# 'Happy Talk': TV News With Personality
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Critics have labelled it a "journalistic laugh-in," the
"happy talk" approach to newscasting, "intramural
horseplay," or the "laugh-a-minute news."
But despite criticism from traditionalists who view the
presentation of television news as anything but a laughing
matter, the trend toward a lighter tone in local TV news
programming is challenging the previously uncontested
cannons of television journalism both in the battle for
ratings and in the competition for journalistic honors.
If KGO-TV's News Scene is an example of the happy
talk trend, the nice-guy newscasters in the Bay Area are
winning the contest in both arenas.
"It's easy to carry a moniker like 'happy talk' " admits
Pat Polillo, news director at KGO (channel seven in San
Francisco) and the man who is responsible for News

Scene's format. "It's very easy to say that we're jocular,
and if you have to lay that on somebody, we deserve it
more than anyone else."
Not Kidding Around
But News Scene's impressive gains in the ratings game
and the Emmy awarded to the program by the San
Francisco Chapter of the National Academy of Television
Arts and Sciences suggest that Polillo and the News Scene
gang are not just kidding around.

Polillo, a veteran of television markets in Baltimore,
Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and San Francisco, leans forward
in his desk chair and puffs a cigar as he tells what has
made KGO-TV news "the finest television news
organization in California."
"The concept of humanizing the news is something I
have believed in for 12 years," he remarks. Although KGO
is one of five stations owned by the American
Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), the happy news concept
did not originate with the network. "It generates here,
from the people we have, their talents. We put it together,
and it's quite distinct from any other television station in
the country," Polillo stated in an Academy publication,
shortly after News Scene won the Emmy award.
Happy Time News
Historically, the "happy time" news format originated
in 1961 in New York with Westinghouse Broadcasting's
Eyewitness News program. The creator of that program,
and Polillo, developed their news philosophy while they
worked together at Pittsburgh station KDKA.
According to Polillo, KGO's Channel Seven News was
"slow, stodgy, dull, and contained old news," before he
became news director of the station in June, 1970. After
noticing low ratings for all 11 o'clock news programs in
the San Francisco market, he determined that all local
stations lacked both imagination and competence, and
were simply rehashing six o'clock news at 11 p.m.
Because the San F>ancisco Westinghouse station was
already calling their program "Eyewitness News," he
invented the name "News Scene" and proceeded to
promote a departure from traditional news delivery on the
11 o'clock news by encouraging anchormen Van Amburg
and Jerry Jensen, sportscaster John O'Reilly, and
weatherman Pete Giddings to "be what they are" on the
air, emphasizing coverage of late-breaking stories, and

increasing the number of stories on the program from 12
to 25 or 30.
Impressive Ratings
"That 11 o'clock news is the most successful news
program in the United States of America,"he boasts,
lighting a fresh cigar. "Fifty percent of the people
watching television at that time are watching us and 70
percent of those people watching news are watching us.
Not only do we win at 11 o'clock, we completely
dominate."
KGO also airs a two-hour block of evening news which
includes 4:30 and 6:00 p.m. News Scenes and one-half
hour of national news, and its popularity is also on the
increase.
The change to a happier news format started an instant
growth in ratings for the station that had lacked an image

in news programming for 23 years. Less than one year
later, KGO's 11 p.m. News Scene had moved from last to
first place in local ratings. Polillo must have done
something right.
Advertisements for News Scene introduce channel
seven's news team (Amburg, Jensen, Giddings, O'Reilly)
as "news people who like people," and Polillo does not
deny that allowing their personalities to develop on the air
has contributed much to the success of the program.
News Scene Gang
"If you have effective people on the air doing the
news, the overall impression is one hell of a lot greater
than if you have an automaton reading the same story,"
he points out.
Polillo also defends the newscasters' informal, personal
approach to the news. "The Walter Cronkite approach is
not the right way to do it, but it has been for twenty
years the only way it's been done. So I come along with
the idea that that's a bunch of crap... I get the
impression that the stonefaces could care less about what
they're talking about."
Anchorman Amburg, who says he "grew up with the
guys who didn't laugh" prefers to do the news the way he
feels it. "We are getting away from the patent leather
look," he remarks, looking up from his cluttered
newsroom desk. "We have transcended that. We are
human beings first and newsmen second."
Emotion, Opinion
While Amburg emphasizes "compassion" in his delivery
of the day's news, Polillo maintains that the newsman's
opinions are as important as his emotions and should be
presented on the air. "The opinion of the Walter
Cronkite-type people will always be there anyway. Even
Walter Cronkite has broken down and cried on the air,"
he comments.
The reason for the impression of jocularity on News
Scene, claims Polillo, is that "by my direct order ... we
always end our program with a smile." Except when a
last-minute story breaks, News Scene always ends with a
humorous anecdote, selected from wire-service copy and
read on the air by co-anchorman Jensen.
"Like everything else on the show it was my idea, but
it had to be approved by the news director," Jensen
proclaims, as he pauses in the process of evaluating the
humorous element in a wire story about tattoos for
turkeys. On one occasion three weeks ago, he selected the
story of the raffle of a naked female dancer at a Stanford
fraternity rush party for the program's closing note.
Ooops .. .
But critics are disturbed over the danger that the
fun-and-games approach may carry over to serious
portions of the newscast. Newsweek reported one
incident in which a Denver anchorman chuckled through
the story of a teen-age psychopath charged with two

counts of murder. The station subsequently terminated its
experiment with "happy talk" news.
On-the-air chuckles abound on News Scene. Polillo
recalls a recent incident in which sportscaster O'Reilly
began laughing hysterically when the studio technician
giving him his cue burped.
"John should have been able to control that," Polillo
explained. "What bothered me was that he assumed that
everybody in the audience had heard and of course we
didn't and didn't know what was going on. Someone
should have stopped it and they couldn't. And then they
used that story about Fritz Weaver getting hit in the
testicles with a line drive and between those two things
occurring it was pandemonium. It was a good thing it was
the end of the program, or they wouldn't have done the
damn thing at all."
Inside Jokes
Another inherent danger in the personal approach is
the use of inside jokes on the air. Weatherman Giddings,
for example, is often kidded by Jensen and Amburg about
the polka-dot ties he consistently wears on the program.
According to Polillo, the tie gimmick developed
spontaneously on the show one day and he then suggested
that it be continued. "My one concern is that anybody
new watching the show won't know what we're talking
about so we therefore make sure that we reiterate the fact
that he always wears polka-dot ties," the news director
says.
Giddings, well known by Bay Area viewers for his "go
do it" weather forecasts, prepares his reports on the fifth
floor of the KGO studio building. The weather room is so
distant from the newsroom (at street level two buildings
down the street) due to the prohibitive cost of
transporting sensitive weather forecast instruments.
As Giddings prepared the map for the day's weather
report, he was efficient, businesslike, and terse. In fact, he
was anything but jocular as he pointed out camera angle
problems and instructed cameramen and studio
technicians, "I always have the predicament of sticking
my ass in the cameraman's face — that's bad news."
'No Way To Program Pete'
Says Polillo, "There's no way to program Pete
Giddings, and you can see the results."
There is no conscious attempt to write humor into the
program Polillo adds, "When you make a mistake, not
only should you make the best of it, but under no
circumstances should you ignore it."
But it would be unfair to characterize News Scene only
in terms of its on-the-air team. "We do better than anyone
else in getting done the things journalists like to get
done," asserts the news director. "We got an Emmy for it
and the people who gave us the Emmy werp not
enthralled with Pete Giddings' charisma or Van Amburg's
charisma. I have an organization of journalists here and
that is really what we are."
The Emmy was awarded on the basis of newscasts
taped from all participating Northern California stations
last December 28. The tapes were judged in Washington
D.C., and the station that dealt most effectively with the
day's news received the Emmy.
Competition Scramble
How has journalistic recognition affected News Scene's
local competition? Says Polillo, "Since the Emmy there

has been a very great interest in what we have been saying
about our news very quietly and that is that we're the
best. We're changing everybody. You find everybody
doing a lot of different things and they're doing it very
badly. They must, at first, because they don't know why
they are doing it."
Interestingly, many stations around the country that
are beginning to experiment with the "happy talk" format
have also adopted the name "News Scene."
News Scene's appeal appears broad-based. Polillo

points out the importance of viewers who inform the
news department of stories because they feel a duty to
call the station and "tell Van Amburg something that is
happening in case he doesn't know about it."
"That's where friendliness and humanization helps
you," he adds, contentedly puffing still another cigar.
Emphasis On Violence
Because KGO's news organization makes a special
effort to cover events occurring between the 6 p.m. and
11 p.m. newscasts, the higher rate of violence in evening

and night hours has caused viewers to criticize News
Scene's apparent tendency to stress violence.
"The news is pretty goddamn gruesome," agrees
Polillo. "On a given day we have somebody raped, a
couple people killed, some people drowned, burned alive,
going on and off welfare, and hauled in jail. But we only
overemphasize it if you can compare it to what the
competition did that night. If we have 19 violent stories
and the competition has 15, they probably didn't even
know about the other four. If they know about them,
they use them too." Polillo says consistency in covering
and breaking more stories influences people to watch
KGO "because they know we have the very latest."
He feels that News Scene's 29 percent minority staff
provides input for coverage of minority affairs. And
Action 7, a consumer action service which KGO first
included on its 4:30 edition is now being imitated by a

competing station. "They're even going to use our name,
isn't that nice?" Polillo remarks.
National, Local Coverage
News Scene concentrates on local news, covering only
the most crucial national events in depth and summarizing
national news on the 6 p.m. report. Of the Nixon
administration's attempt to control network news
coverage at a local level, Polillo says, "1 don't think we
have to worry about the White House anymore. The
Watergate scandal will be the greatest single vindication of
freedom of the press. There is no way to control local
news, or network news at a local level."
Although "happy news" has gained increasing shares of
audiences in Chicago, and New York as well as in San
Francisco, it is doubtful whether the light approach to
newscasting will spread to national news programming.
Local newscasters have more freedom than network
newsmen because they appeal to a specific area, says
Polillo. "Every time we do something on the air we offend
someone. We can take certain liberties with the local news
because everybody here knows who Joe Alioto is and who
Bobby Seale is, and we can move in and out with a 'Joe'
here and a 'Bobby' there."
News Scene's creator views those "liberties" as "a
significant departure from traditional news and delivery."
Critics of the happy talk news format suggest that the
trend toward humanization, jocularity, or showmanship in
local newscasting may promote disregard for what former
CBS executive Fred Friendly has termed "a special
responsibility not to impose views on the public and to
make them understand the salients of the story."
Go Do It
But success or failure of a television program is not
determined by its journalistic quality. In the race for
ratings, it's performance that counts, and as long as News
Scene continues to dominate the ratings, the
"laugh-a-minute" newscasters are here to stay.
Increasing numbers of viewers are attracted by the
News Scene formula: Amburg leads off with the latest in
local violence, Giddings advises weather fans to "go do
it," O'Reilly barely stifles a chuckle as he takes his cue,
and smiling Jensen warms up for the funny finish.
"But say what you want about 'happy talk,' " Polillo
concludes. "At the end of the show we may be laughing
but before the program our correspondent tells us, 'The
war isn't over guys, and I'm standing here in the middle of
It.' "

IF IT FEELS GOOD .. . News Scene anchorman Van Amburg learned television newscasting side by side with "the
guys who didn't laugh" but he prefers to do the news the way he feels it. He sees nothing wrong with injecting "a
father's compassion' in any story where he deems it approoriate.


OOPS . . . News Scene Sportscaster John O'Reilly recently
allowed a studio incident to interfere with his on the air
composure, reflecting the fears of "happy talk" critics
that the jocular approach to news may occasionally get
out of hand.


HAPPY TALKER — KGO's Jerry Jensen selects humorous anecdotes from wire service copy to end News Scene with
a smile. He rejected one item concerning armpit tattoos for FBI agents because "it wouldn't be in the interests of
national security."


IRASCIBLE - Channel seven news director Pat Polillo
admits that News Scene deserves the jocular label "more
than anyone else," but also emphasizes the competence of
his news-gathering organization. During an interview with
the 'Daily,' he spoke out candidly, in a manner
reminiscent of the "Lou Grant" character that appears on
the Mary Tyler Moore Show.


GO DO IT — News Scene meteorologist Pete Giddings betrays none of his on-the-air jocularity as he warns
technicians of camera angle problems while preparing the day's weather map. Pete's reply to fans who want to know
why he wears polka-dot ties: "Why do (women) wear panty hose to a dance?"
