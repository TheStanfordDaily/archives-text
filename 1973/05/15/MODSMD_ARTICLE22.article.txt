# Pro Musica In Memorable Concert
## 
### DOUG SMITH 
The New York Pro Musica's
final concert at Stanford last
Friday was a moving experience in
more than one respect. Its
centerpiece was the Missa Ave,
Maris Stella by the Spanish
composer Cristobal de Morales,
which Pro Musica director George
Houle described as "one of the
most intense, complicated and
mystical works of the
Renaissance." Further, this was
the final concert with the Pro
Musica for two of its most
talented members, gambist Mary
Springfels and lutenist Lucy
Cross.
In addition, many students,
especially those in the Music
Department, had become closely
acquainted with Pro Musica
members and reacquainted with
Dr. Houle during the group's
week-long residence at Stanford.
And finally, the concert took
place in Memorial Church, which
is far more conducive to
memorable artistic experiences
than is Memorial Auditorium.
The stage was thus set for a
legendary evening, and the
musical performance did not
disappoint.
Beginning Piece
The concert began with the
Kyrie and Gloria from Morales'
mass. Most of the mass is in five
voices; those voices which were
not sung with two on a part were
doubled by viol, bass shawm, flute
or recorder and cornetto.
The blend of voices and
instruments was so good that I
could not distinguish any
instrument except the viol and
occasionally the cornetto.
Periodically, for purposes of
contrast, a section was sung
unaccompanied.
The work itself is just as Houle
characterized it; it is full of canon,
imitation and other sophisticated
contrapuntal devices and is thus
difficult to digest. For this reason
secular pieces were inserted
between the remaining three
movements.
This is in keping with the
spirit of the composition, since all
masses were sung at that time
with prayers, chants, etc.
interspersed.
Virtuosity
The next section of the concert
featured pieces which showed off
the virtuosity and musicality of
the Pro Musica's instrumentalists.

Whether playing recorders,
crumhorns, flute, viol or lute their
ensemble was tight and their
musical interpretations
appropriately lively or
contemplative.
Come suele en bianco zisne
(anonymous) was especially
appealing; it represents the
peaceful resignation of a dying
swan or a wise old man and was
softly and beautifully played by
tenor and bass flute with viol.
Four pieces for vocal ensemble
followed, Here again skillful
programming was evidenced, as
the mood ranged from subline
fervor to merry earthliness.

Both O dulce contemplation
and Ojos morenos of Juan
Vasquez were particularly
difficult songs, relying upon
expert blend, control and vocal
beauty for effect. These

requirements were easily met by
the Pro Musica's singers.
After the Credo of Morales'
mass, an intermission and the
awesome Sanctus there followed a
series of short songs, variations,

ricercars, etc. featuring vocal and
instrumental soloists and a shawm
band.
Flies in the ointment were
technically incomplete sackbut
playing which spoiled the shawm

pieces, and the bass solo of
Rodney Godshall, who was
painfully out of tune.
Judy Hubbell sang brightly and
accurately, exhibiting great
showmanship with her flirtatious

facial expressions and fingertip
cymbals. Countertenor Daniel
Collins sang an austere motet like
a voice from the past, but
Christine Whittlesey was a voice
from heaven.
She has a crystalline, pure
vocal quality and was wonderfully
expressive. She was accompanied
by tenor flute and viol and the
effect was heartrendingly
beautiful.
The program closed with
Morales' Agnus Dei. It was only
appropriate that this concert, like
some of the world's greatest music
(Beethoven's piano sonata opus
111), should end quietly.

Flies in the ointment were
technically incomplete sackbut
playing which spoiled the shawm

pieces, and the bass solo of
Rodney Godshall, who was
painfully out of tune.
Judy Hubbell sang brightly and
accurately, exhibiting great
showmanship with her flirtatious

facial expressions and fingertip
cymbals. Countertenor Daniel
Collins sang an austere motet like
a voice from the past, but
Christine Whittlesey was a voice
from heaven.
She has a crystalline, pure
vocal quality and was wonderfully
expressive. She was accompanied
by tenor flute and viol and the
effect was heartrendingly
beautiful.
The program closed with

ARCHITECT AND EMPEROR—John Caldwell as the Emperor and
Michael E. Goldstein as the Architect star in the male version of
Arrobal's "The Architect and the Emperor," showing at 8 p.m. at the
Nitery today through May 19. A female cast also performs a special
midnight show, running May 17-19.
The New York Pro Musica's
final concert at Stanford last
Friday was a moving experience in
more than one respect. Its
centerpiece was the Missa Ave,
Maris Stella by the Spanish
composer Cristobal de Morales,
which Pro Musica director George
Houle described as "one of the
most intense, complicated and
mystical works of the
Renaissance." Further, this was
the final concert with the Pro
Musica for two of its most
talented members, gambist Mary
Springfels and lutenist Lucy
Cross.
In addition, many students,
especially those in the Music
Department, had become closely
acquainted with Pro Musica
members and reacquainted with
Dr. Houle during the group's
week-long residence at Stanford.
And finally, the concert took
place in Memorial Church, which
is far more conducive to
memorable artistic experiences
than is Memorial Auditorium.
The stage was thus set for a
legendary evening, and the
musical performance did not
disappoint.
Beginning Piece
The concert began with the
Kyrie and Gloria from Morales'
mass. Most of the mass is in five
voices; those voices which were
not sung with two on a part were
doubled by viol, bass shawm, flute
or recorder and cornetto.
The blend of voices and
instruments was so good that I
could not distinguish any
instrument except the viol and
occasionally the cornetto.
Periodically, for purposes of
contrast, a section was sung
unaccompanied.
The work itself is just as Houle
characterized it; it is full of canon,
imitation and other sophisticated
contrapuntal devices and is thus
difficult to digest. For this reason
secular pieces were inserted
between the remaining three
movements.
This is in keping with the
spirit of the composition, since all
masses were sung at that time
with prayers, chants, etc.
interspersed.
Virtuosity
The next section of the concert
featured pieces which showed off
the virtuosity and musicality of
the Pro Musica's instrumentalists.

Whether playing recorders,
crumhorns, flute, viol or lute their
ensemble was tight and their
musical interpretations
appropriately lively or
contemplative.
Come suele en bianco zisne
(anonymous) was especially
appealing; it represents the
peaceful resignation of a dying
swan or a wise old man and was
softly and beautifully played by
tenor and bass flute with viol.
Four pieces for vocal ensemble
followed, Here again skillful
programming was evidenced, as
the mood ranged from subline
fervor to merry earthliness.

Both O dulce contemplation
and Ojos morenos of Juan
Vasquez were particularly
difficult songs, relying upon
expert blend, control and vocal
beauty for effect. These

requirements were easily met by
the Pro Musica's singers.
After the Credo of Morales'
mass, an intermission and the
awesome Sanctus there followed a
series of short songs, variations,

ricercars, etc. featuring vocal and
instrumental soloists and a shawm
band.
Flies in the ointment were
technically incomplete sackbut
playing which spoiled the shawm

pieces, and the bass solo of
