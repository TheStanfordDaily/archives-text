# Artistic Documentary
## Getting High On 'Monterey Jazz' 
### DAN FORTE 
Of all the music festival documentaries to
come out in recent years, ("Woodstock,"
"Gimme Shelter," "Mad Dogs and
Englishmen," "WattStax," et al), "Monterey
Jazz" easily ranks as number one.
The basic model festival documentary
includes three elements: first, a lot of live
footage of the artists performing, second,
interviews with these artists interspersed with
the music to break the monotony, and third, a
lot of artistic photography of the scene,
musicians, and audience.
In all three areas, "Monterey Jazz" far
exceeds its predecessors. It's the only one I've
seen so far in which the interviews
strengthened, rater than detracted from, the
general theme of the movie.
These segments included interviews with
John Lewis, pianist of the Modern Jazz
Quartet, Jimmy Lyons, general manager of
the Monterey Jazz Festival, and Duke
Ellington. One of the film's highlights was an
interview with an unknown gatecrasher-motor
cyclist, who was a classic example of a
stereotype hipster.
Best Names
As for the music, "Monterey Jazz" features
some of the best names in contemporary blues
and jazz, performing at the 13th Annual
Monterey Jazz Festival, 1970.
After a lot of setting up, the program
begins with the Johnny Otis Show, which was
featured at Monterey's traditional Saturday
afternoon of blues. First up was "The Boss Of
The Blues," Big Joe Turner, who was first to
record "Shake, Rattle, and Roll." Turner's
Kansas City, boogie woogie style was an
appropriate starting point. He sang two fast
boogie numbers, "Hide And Go Seek" and
"Roll 'Em Pete."
Following Turner was Margie Evans, who

sang a fast, soul-ish version of Count Basie's "I
May Be Wrong." I wasn't very impressed.
What I thought to be the highlight of the
film came next with Eddie "Cleanhead"
Vinson. Vinson is among that all-too-rare
breed of bluesmen with a solid background in
the Big Band Era, (like Lonnie Johnson,
T-Bone Walker, and Jimmy Witherspoon).
Good Rendition
Vinson belted out a fantastic rendition of
"Cleanhead's Blues":
"When it comes Winter, you know, I gets
kinda' cold.
I try to grow some hair, but I can't to save
my soul.
When Summer comes, you know, I get
such a pretty tan.
You can hear all the women holler, 'Where
can I find that Cleanhead man?"
Unfortunately, Vinson's sax solo was
edited out of the movie. Vinson is a fine alto
player with a beautiful tone.
Next was Little Esther Phillips who has
been with the Johnny Otis Show since age 14,
which was some years ago. She sang a medley
which included a variation of "I'm In the
Mood For Love" and her hit "Release Me,"
later recorded by Englebert Humperdink.
"Mr. Five-By-Five," the late Jimmy
Rushing, long-time vocalist with the Count
Basie Band, was next. Rushing, then 67, sang
beautifully on "Everyday I Have The Blues"
and "Sent For You Yesterday."
Excerpt Ends
This closed the Johnny Otis excerpt.
Included in Otis' back-up band were such
names as "Sugarcane" Harris (violin),
Johnny's son, Shuggie (guitar), and Gene
"The Mighty Flea" Connors (trombone). Otis,
whose claim to fame is "Willie And The Hand
Jive," played piano.
The Modern Jazz Quartet, which has been

together for twenty years, represents four of
the biggest giants in jazz: bassist Percy Heath,
drummer Connie Kay, pianist John Lewis
(musical director of the festival), and Milt
Jackson on vibes. Newsweek called MJQ "a
living legend."
The photography of the MJQ as they
perform"Walkin' Stomp'Ms almost as excellent
as the music.
The next artist is flautist Tim Weisberg.
Weisberg's style is more rock than jazz, and I
thought his performance of "A Day At The
Fair" was out of step with the rest of the
movie. No doubt it was included to show the
direction in which jazz may be heading. I
think the footage could have been put to
better use.
Great Duke
The movie ends with the great Duke
Ellington saying, "We do all love you madly."
Nothing could be more appropriate. Ellington
and his big band perform one of his newer
compositions, "Afro-Eurasian Eclipse," before
bringing out Woody Herman, who plays "I
Got It Bad (And That Ain't Good)" on alto
sax, backed by the Ellington band.
Then, Ellington brings out the great jazz
singer Joe Williams, who was featured vocalist
with Count Basie from 1950 to 1961.
Williams delivers "Don't Get Around Much
Anymore" with Herman supplying
complimentary riffs on alto.
The movie ends with Williams singing
"Everyday I Have The Blues," (which
contrasts quite a bit with Rushing's version),
after which we are left with a still shot of
Williams embracing Herman.
Besides being a showcase for some fine jazz
artists, "Monterey Jazz" is itself a carefully
put together piece of art. It accurately
represents the roots, emotions, class, and joy
that is jazz.

the music to break the monotony, and third, a
lot of artistic photography of the scene,
musicians, and audience.
In all three areas, "Monterey Jazz" far
exceeds its predecessors. It's the only one I've
seen so far in which the interviews
strengthened, rater than detracted from, the
general theme of the movie.
These segments included interviews with
John Lewis, pianist of the Modern Jazz
Quartet, Jimmy Lyons, general manager of
the Monterey Jazz Festival, and Duke
Ellington. One of the film's highlights was an
interview with an unknown gatecrasher-motor
cyclist, who was a classic example of a
stereotype hipster.
Best Names
As for the music, "Monterey Jazz" features
some of the best names in contemporary blues
and jazz, performing at the 13th Annual
Monterey Jazz Festival, 1970.
After a lot of setting up, the program
begins with the Johnny Otis Show, which was
featured at Monterey's traditional Saturday
afternoon of blues. First up was "The Boss Of
The Blues," Big Joe Turner, who was first to
record "Shake, Rattle, and Roll." Turner's
Kansas City, boogie woogie style was an
appropriate starting point. He sang two fast
boogie numbers, "Hide And Go Seek" and
"Roll 'Em Pete."
Following Turner was Margie Evans, who

sang a fast, soul-ish version of Count Basie's "I
May Be Wrong." I wasn't very impressed.
What I thought to be the highlight of the
film came next with Eddie "Cleanhead"
Vinson. Vinson is among that all-too-rare
breed of bluesmen with a solid background in
the Big Band Era, (like Lonnie Johnson,
T-Bone Walker, and Jimmy Witherspoon).
Good Rendition
Vinson belted out a fantastic rendition of
"Cleanhead's Blues":
"When it comes Winter, you know, I gets
kinda' cold.
I try to grow some hair, but I can't to save
my soul.
When Summer comes, you know, I get
such a pretty tan.
You can hear all the women holler, 'Where
can I find that Cleanhead man?"
Unfortunately, Vinson's sax solo was
edited out of the movie. Vinson is a fine alto
player with a beautiful tone.
Next was Little Esther Phillips who has
been with the Johnny Otis Show since age 14,
which was some years ago. She sang a medley
which included a variation of "I'm In the
Mood For Love" and her hit "Release Me,"
later recorded by Englebert Humperdink.
"Mr. Five-By-Five," the late Jimmy
Rushing, long-time vocalist with the Count
Basie Band, was next. Rushing, then 67, sang
beautifully on "Everyday I Have The Blues"
and "Sent For You Yesterday."
Excerpt Ends
This closed the Johnny Otis excerpt.
Included in Otis' back-up band were such
names as "Sugarcane" Harris (violin),
Johnny's son, Shuggie (guitar), and Gene
"The Mighty Flea" Connors (trombone). Otis,
whose claim to fame is "Willie And The Hand
Jive," played piano.
The Modern Jazz Quartet, which has been

together for twenty years, represents four of
the biggest giants in jazz: bassist Percy Heath,
drummer Connie Kay, pianist John Lewis
(musical director of the festival), and Milt
Jackson on vibes. Newsweek called MJQ "a
living legend."
The photography of the MJQ as they
perform"Walkin' Stomp'Ms almost as excellent
as the music.
The next artist is flautist Tim Weisberg.
Weisberg's style is more rock than jazz, and I
thought his performance of "A Day At The
Fair" was out of step with the rest of the
movie. No doubt it was included to show the
direction in which jazz may be heading. I
think the footage could have been put to
better use.
Great Duke
The movie ends with the great Duke
Ellington saying, "We do all love you madly."
Nothing could be more appropriate. Ellington
and his big band perform one of his newer
compositions, "Afro-Eurasian Eclipse," before
bringing out Woody Herman, who plays "I
Got It Bad (And That Ain't Good)" on alto
sax, backed by the Ellington band.
Then, Ellington brings out the great jazz
singer Joe Williams, who was featured vocalist
with Count Basie from 1950 to 1961.
Williams delivers "Don't Get Around Much
Anymore" with Herman supplying
complimentary riffs on alto.
The movie ends with Williams singing
"Everyday I Have The Blues," (which
contrasts quite a bit with Rushing's version),
after which we are left with a still shot of
Williams embracing Herman.
Besides being a showcase for some fine jazz
artists, "Monterey Jazz" is itself a carefully
put together piece of art. It accurately
represents the roots, emotions, class, and joy
that is jazz.
Of all the music festival documentaries to
come out in recent years, ("Woodstock,"
"Gimme Shelter," "Mad Dogs and
Englishmen," "WattStax," et al), "Monterey
Jazz" easily ranks as number one.
The basic model festival documentary
includes three elements: first, a lot of live
footage of the artists performing, second,
interviews with these artists interspersed with
the music to break the monotony, and third, a
lot of artistic photography of the scene,
musicians, and audience.

John Lewis, pianist of the Modern Jazz
Quartet, Jimmy Lyons, general manager of
the Monterey Jazz Festival, and Duke
Ellington. One of the film's highlights was an
interview with an unknown gatecrasher-motor
cyclist, who was a classic example of a
stereotype hipster.
Best Names
As for the music, "Monterey Jazz" features
some of the best names in contemporary blues
and jazz, performing at the 13th Annual
Monterey Jazz Festival, 1970.
After a lot of setting up, the program
begins with the Johnny Otis Show, which was
featured at Monterey's traditional Saturday
afternoon of blues. First up was "The Boss Of
The Blues," Big Joe Turner, who was first to
record "Shake, Rattle, and Roll." Turner's
Kansas City, boogie woogie style was an
appropriate starting point. He sang two fast
boogie numbers, "Hide And Go Seek" and
"Roll 'Em Pete."
Following Turner was Margie Evans, who

sang a fast, soul-ish version of Count Basie's "I
May Be Wrong." I wasn't very impressed.
What I thought to be the highlight of the
film came next with Eddie "Cleanhead"
Vinson. Vinson is among that all-too-rare
breed of bluesmen with a solid background in
the Big Band Era, (like Lonnie Johnson,
T-Bone Walker, and Jimmy Witherspoon).
Good Rendition
Vinson belted out a fantastic rendition of
"Cleanhead's Blues":
"When it comes Winter, you know, I gets
kinda' cold.
I try to grow some hair, but I can't to save
my soul.
When Summer comes, you know, I get
such a pretty tan.
You can hear all the women holler, 'Where
can I find that Cleanhead man?"
Unfortunately, Vinson's sax solo was
edited out of the movie. Vinson is a fine alto
player with a beautiful tone.
Next was Little Esther Phillips who has
been with the Johnny Otis Show since age 14,
which was some years ago. She sang a medley
which included a variation of "I'm In the
Mood For Love" and her hit "Release Me,"
later recorded by Englebert Humperdink.
"Mr. Five-By-Five," the late Jimmy
Rushing, long-time vocalist with the Count
Basie Band, was next. Rushing, then 67, sang
beautifully on "Everyday I Have The Blues"
and "Sent For You Yesterday."
Excerpt Ends
This closed the Johnny Otis excerpt.
Included in Otis' back-up band were such
names as "Sugarcane" Harris (violin),
Johnny's son, Shuggie (guitar), and Gene
"The Mighty Flea" Connors (trombone). Otis,
whose claim to fame is "Willie And The Hand
Jive," played piano.
The Modern Jazz Quartet, which has been

together for twenty years, represents four of
the biggest giants in jazz: bassist Percy Heath,
drummer Connie Kay, pianist John Lewis
(musical director of the festival), and Milt
Jackson on vibes. Newsweek called MJQ "a
living legend."
The photography of the MJQ as they
perform"Walkin' Stomp'Ms almost as excellent
as the music.
The next artist is flautist Tim Weisberg.
Weisberg's style is more rock than jazz, and I
thought his performance of "A Day At The
Fair" was out of step with the rest of the
movie. No doubt it was included to show the
direction in which jazz may be heading. I
think the footage could have been put to
better use.
Great Duke
The movie ends with the great Duke
Ellington saying, "We do all love you madly."
Nothing could be more appropriate. Ellington
and his big band perform one of his newer
compositions, "Afro-Eurasian Eclipse," before
bringing out Woody Herman, who plays "I
Got It Bad (And That Ain't Good)" on alto
sax, backed by the Ellington band.
Then, Ellington brings out the great jazz
singer Joe Williams, who was featured vocalist
with Count Basie from 1950 to 1961.
Williams delivers "Don't Get Around Much
Anymore" with Herman supplying
complimentary riffs on alto.
The movie ends with Williams singing
"Everyday I Have The Blues," (which
contrasts quite a bit with Rushing's version),
after which we are left with a still shot of
Williams embracing Herman.
Besides being a showcase for some fine jazz
artists, "Monterey Jazz" is itself a carefully
put together piece of art. It accurately
represents the roots, emotions, class, and joy
that is jazz.
Of all the music festival documentaries to
come out in recent years, ("Woodstock,"
"Gimme Shelter," "Mad Dogs and
Englishmen," "WattStax," et al), "Monterey
Jazz" easily ranks as number one.
The basic model festival documentary
includes three elements: first, a lot of live
footage of the artists performing, second,
interviews with these artists interspersed with
the music to break the monotony, and third, a
lot of artistic photography of the scene,
musicians, and audience.
In all three areas, "Monterey Jazz" far
exceeds its predecessors. It's the only one I've
seen so far in which the interviews
strengthened, rater than detracted from, the
general theme of the movie.
