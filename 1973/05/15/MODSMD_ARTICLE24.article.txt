Sky lab Mission Faces Trouble
CAPE KENNEDY, Fla. - A cranky set of solar power
panels failed to deploy properly yesterday on Skylab 1,
forcing a five-day delay in the launch of the astronauts
and a severe curtailment of their eventual mission.
Skylab program director William Schneider announced
the decision after the nation's first space station had been
rocketed flawlessly into orbit.
Skylab 1 astronauts, Charles Conrad Jr.. Dr. Joseph P.
Kerwin and Paul J. Weitz, were to have blasted off today
for 28 days in orbit. Now, they are to return to
quarantine quarters at the Johnson Space Center near
Houston.
Schneider said the new launch time of Skylab 1 will be
at 11 a.m. EDT Sunday.
Trouble developed soon after the 118-foot Skylab was
thrust by a Saturn 5 rocket from a Cape Kennedy launch
pad.
Schneider said analysis of telemetry data from the
space station indicates that a paper-thin aluminum
overcoat which protects the orbiting laboratory from
meteorites may have deployed too early and been ripped
away by the jolting forces of the launch.
Loss of the panels, he said, cut the amount of power
available on the $294 million Skylab to about half. To
help carry the load, he said, power will be transferred
from the Apollo command ship which will ferry the
astronauts to Skylab.
Schneider said the oxygen and hydrogen aboard the
command ship will only last 16 to 21 days, but he said the
mission could be lengthened to the planned 28 days by
curtailing activities.
Bruce Opens U.S.-China Relations
HONG KONG — David K.E. Bruce, the white-haired,
diplomat called out of retirement to open the American
liaison office in Peking, entered China yesterday to begin
a new era of relations between the United States and
China.
Among the greeters at Peking airport was Vice Foreign
Minister Han Nien-lung. according to Kyodo, the Japanese
news service.
Bruce made it clear he has a fairly free hand as he
builds on the foundation laid by presidential adviser
Henry A. Kissinger and President Nixon in their visits to
the Chinese capital.
A former ambassador to such capitals as Bonn, Paris
and London and at one time America's chief delegate to
the Paris peace talks on Vietnam, Bruce obviously looked
forward to the challenge of heading the first U.S. mission
in China in 24 years.
Group To Probe U.S. Bombing
SAIGON — The four-nation international peacekeeping
group voted unanimously yesterday to investigate
Communist allegations that the United States has resumed
bombing in South Vietnam, causing serious losses in lives
and property.
The Saigon government leveled charges of its own
against the Communist side, accusing North Vietnam of
"war preparations."
North Vietnam issued a "white paper," denying it had
violated the ceasefire, but accusing the United States and
Saigon of serious infractions of the peace agreement.
Le Due Tho arrived in Paris yesterday from Hanoi for
new talks scheduled to begin Thursday with Henry A.
Kissinger, President Nixon's foreign affairs adviser.
Tho, a member of the North Vietnamese Communist
party's Politburo, declared on arrival, however, that the
meetings "will definitely not take place" if there is any
further American bombing of areas controlled by the Viet
Cong in South Vietnam.

Court Bolsters Women's Rights
WASHINGTON - In an 8 to 1 decision bolstering
women's rights yesterday, the Supreme Court declared
unconstitutional a federal law that extends benefits to
servicemen while denying equal treatment to women in
the armed forces.
The issue, however, failed to muster a court majority
willing to declare that all discrimination based on sex is —
like that based on race — unconstitutional.
The court struck down a feature of the federal law that
grants housing and medical benefits to the wives of
servicemen while at the same time denying those benefits
to husbands of women in the service unless it is proved
that the servicewoman provides at least half her husband's
support.
Four Justices, William J. Brennan Jr., William 0.
Douglas, Byron R. White and Thurgood Marshall,
compared sex discrimination to that based on national
origin or race.
While finding the laws in question unconstitutional.
Justices Lewis F. Powell Jr. and Harry A. Blackmun and
Chief Justice Warren E. Burger deferred to the political
process on the larger question.
Groups Question Energy Report
SAN FRANCISCO — A utilities-paid Stanford Research
Institute report claiming California will face an energy
shortage was an attempt by power producers to hoist oil
prices and deregulate natural gas prices, antagonists
charged yesterday.
The Sierra Club and San Francisco Consumer Action
contended at a news conference that the report has the
effect of holding the home consumer "for ransom under
the guise of an energy shortage."
SRI was paid $75,000 for the report by the
Sacramento Municipal Utility District, Pacific Gas &
Electric, Southern California Edison, Los Angeles Water &
Power and San Diego Gas & Electric.
The report last week urged further development of
state energy sources and claimed economic stability
should be more important if a crisis occurs than using
environmentally acceptable fuels.
David Pesonen of the Sierra Club called the SRI report
naive to assume that energy demand is inelastic and that
increased prices for energy use would not change
the pattern of public demand.
Gold Prices Soar
LONDON — The price of gold soared to record levels
yesterday, above the once unimaginable figure of $100 an
ounce, and kept on climbing.
At the same time, the dollar faced some of the worst
selling pressure it has encountered since the February
devaluation, leading to fears of a new dollar crisis.
Dealers blamed the dollar drop partly on the soaring
gold pricc and partly on continued uncertainty about the
stability of the Nixon administration because of the
Watergate scandal.
Some dealers suggested the meeting next month of
President Nixon and the Soviet Communist party leader,
Leonid I. Brezhnev, may be a factor in the new gold rush.
The Russians are a major supplier of newly mined gold,
but they have been holding their gold off world markets
recently, helping to push the price up.
Today's Weather
Partly cloudy through tomorrow with low clouds and
patchy fog near the ocean. Low in the 50s. Highs today
and tomorrow in low 60s near the coast to the 70s or low
80s inland. Westerly wind 10 to 20 mph in afternoon.
