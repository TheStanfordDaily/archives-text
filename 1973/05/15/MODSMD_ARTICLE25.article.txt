# Sex Discrimination Petition
## 
### 
Nancy Jewell Cross and Linda
Crouse, plaintiffs in a sex
discrimination court action
against Stanford University, filed
a petition for certiorari with the
United States Supreme Court last
week. The petition seeks a
Supreme Court review of the case.
The case, described by Cross as
a measure "to impress trusts,
constitutions and statutes for
equality by sex-race in education
and employment at Stanford
University" was initiated before

the California State Superior
Court in April 1971.
When a Stanford-sought
motion to dismiss the case was
granted by the court, Cross
appealed her action to the
California State Supreme Court
which denied her petition on
February 8, 1973.
Cross had ninety days from
that denial to take action, and
filed her petition for certiorari on
May 9. She expects the University
to again seek dismissal of the case.
