From the Associated Press
WASHINGTON - John D.
Ehrlichman's White House safe
contained Daniel Ellsberg's and 16
other missing wiretap files, it was
disclosed yesterday" by acting FBI
Director William D. Ruckelshaus. He
said he "had to arm wrestle with the
Secret Service" to get them.
The startling revelation was made as
the White House worried publicly
about the effect of televised Senate
hearings on Watergate legal processes
and a judge ordered John W. Dean Ill's
potentially explosive papers turned
over to government and Senate
investigators.
Meanwhile, Elliot L. Richardson
was ready to name a special prosecutor
from a list of four names, including a
Stanford trustee. There was testimony
on Capitol Hill that Ehrlichman, H.R.

Haldeman and Dean tried to involve
the CIA in covert activities other than
the burglary of Ellsberg's psychiatrist.
The FBI explained, several hours
after the Ruckelshaus news
conference, that the acting chief did
not intend to convey he physically
wrested the wiretap files from the
Secret Service but only to show the
zealousness with which they were
guarded. "It was just a figure of
speech," a spokesman said.
The whereabouts of the Ellsberg
wiretaps had been a mystery until
Ruckelshaus' disclosure. The missing
files were a major factor last week in
the dismissal of all charges against
Ellsberg and Anthony Russo in the
Pentagon Papers trial in Los Angeles.
Choices Narrowed
Meanwhile, Atty. Gen. Designate
Elliot Richardson told newsmen he
had narrowed his choices of a special
Watergate prosecutor to four men:
—Harold R. Tyler Jr., 51, a U.S.
District judge in the southern district
of New York, a Republican who
served as an assistant attorney general
in the last year of the Eisenhower
administration.
—David Peck, a former New York
state judge now in private practice.

—Judge William Erickson, 49, of
the Colorado Supreme Court, who
helped draft the American Bar
Association's administration of
criminal justice standards.
—Warren Christopher, a Los
Angeles attorney and former deputy
U.S. Attorney general.
Stanford Graduate
Christopher was a 1949 graduate of
Stanford Law School and the first
president of the Stanford Law Review.
He was elected to the school's Board
of Trustees in 1972.
Sen. Stuart Symington (D-Mo.),
said the ClA's deputy director told the
Senate Armed Services Committee
yesterday "there were other matters
besides the Ellsberg case in which the
White House staff tried to involve the
CIA."
Symington, acting chairman of the
committee, alluded to closed-door
testimony from four CIA officials and
said the new revelations had come
from Army Lt. Gen. Vernon Walters,
the agency's deputy director.
He gave no details but said: "What I
learned today that I didn't know
before was how deeply involved
Haldeman was — as well as Ehrlichman
and Dean."
