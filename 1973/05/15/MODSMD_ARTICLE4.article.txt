# Student Transportation Study Urges Halt To Subsidizing Of Campus Autos
## 
### CHRISTY WISE 
A newly released transportation
study by a group of students and
recent graduates declares that Stanford
"is not acting responsibly in the field
of transportation planning and
management."

The report, a supplement to the
1971 SWOPSI publication, Balanced
Transportation Planning for Suburban
and Academic Communities, states
that automobile traffic on campus is
being subsidized by the University at
Lhe cost of more than $400,000 per
year.
According to Christopher Lovelock,
editor of both publications, operating
costs such as maintenance and
enforcement are not offset by
revenues from student parking fees
and parking violations, thereby
creating a deficit of $100,000 per
year. In addition, capital costs total
$300,000 per year.
The study recommends adoption of
a formal policy to make motor

vehicles pay their own way. This
would include a University-wide paid
vehicle registration program set at $20
per vehicle for faculty and students
and between $4 and $20 for staff
members, depending on salary- range.
No More Free Parking
"Nobody likes to be charged for
parking," the report states, "but free
parking is a luxury Stanford can no
longer afford."
Lovelock explained, "At present,
faculty and staff park free." He
continued, "People who don't travel
to campus by car, don't receive
comparable assistance. They don't get
free bus tickets or anything and this is
really inequitable."
The study states that Stanford has a

"financial responsibility to itself and
to its students and employees to
publicize existing transit services and
lobby for improvements."
Bulletin Boards
This would include erection of
bulletin boards containing transit maps
and schedules, revision of present
campus visitor maps to include local
bus and train stations, inclusion of
information on transit services with all
materials distributed to new students
and the possibility of purchasing
second-hand buses for lease to
employee and student groups in low
income neighborhoods to provide
low-cost commuter charter service
between these communities and the
