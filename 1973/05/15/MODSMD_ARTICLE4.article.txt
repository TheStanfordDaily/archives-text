# Student Transportation Study Urges Halt To Subsidizing Of Campus Autos
## 
### CHRISTY WISE 
A newly released transportation
study by a group of students and
recent graduates declares that Stanford
"is not acting responsibly in the field
of transportation planning and
management."

The report, a supplement to the
1971 SWOPSI publication, Balanced
Transportation Planning for Suburban
and Academic Communities, states
that automobile traffic on campus is
being subsidized by the University at
Lhe cost of more than $400,000 per
year.
According to Christopher Lovelock,
editor of both publications, operating
costs such as maintenance and
enforcement are not offset by
revenues from student parking fees
and parking violations, thereby
creating a deficit of $100,000 per
year. In addition, capital costs total
$300,000 per year.
The study recommends adoption of
a formal policy to make motor

vehicles pay their own way. This
would include a University-wide paid
vehicle registration program set at $20
per vehicle for faculty and students
and between $4 and $20 for staff
members, depending on salary- range.
No More Free Parking
"Nobody likes to be charged for
parking," the report states, "but free
parking is a luxury Stanford can no
longer afford."
Lovelock explained, "At present,
faculty and staff park free." He
continued, "People who don't travel
to campus by car, don't receive
comparable assistance. They don't get
free bus tickets or anything and this is
really inequitable."
The study states that Stanford has a

"financial responsibility to itself and
to its students and employees to
publicize existing transit services and
lobby for improvements."
Bulletin Boards
This would include erection of
bulletin boards containing transit maps
and schedules, revision of present
campus visitor maps to include local
bus and train stations, inclusion of
information on transit services with all
materials distributed to new students
and the possibility of purchasing
second-hand buses for lease to
employee and student groups in low
income neighborhoods to provide
low-cost commuter charter service
between these communities and the

campus.
The study recommends vigorous
enforcement of all vehicle registration
regulations. The University, according
to Lovelock, "is losing tens of
thousands of dollars through poor
enforcement . . . People are not
registering their cars when they should
be."
In January, a survey was taken of
approximately one dozen different
parking areas, comprising almost one
thousand parked automobiles, to
establish the extent of illegal parking.
The results showed that 327(35.1%) of
all cars surveyed had no parking
sticker at all, while another 127 bore a
sticker which did not entitle them to
park in their present locations. The
report concludes, "Almost one half of
all cars surveyed were illegally
parked!"
Other recommendations include
installation of parking meters at all
time limit visitor parking locations,
efforts to facilitate and encourage
formation of carpools, establishment
of six categories of parking areas, and
introduction of some variation of
staggered working hours on campus.
The study, a critical review of
progress made on recommendations in
the original report, asserts that
"socially and environmentally, the
University's transportation policies
display a lack of responsiveness to
known problems besetting the wider

community of which it is a part,
including air pollution, immobility of
low income groups and the growing
energy shortage."
Out Of Touch
Lovelock thinks the problem is that
the administration seems "to be out of
touch with the outside world. They've
done nothing to discourage
automobile use or make it pay its own
way, despite the fact the University
seems to have financial problems."
The report commends the
University for its recognition of "the
increasing demand for bicycling
facilities among faculty, staff and
students alike," and for its current
construction "of a number of new
bicycle paths, segregated from existing
automobile traffic."

The administration is urged by the
study to adopt a "leadership role" to
set "an example for the Midpeninsula"
rather than act as a burden upon it.
Little Response
Lovelock explained that there has
been little University action in
response to the first publication or in
response to the administration's own
Parking and Traffic Committee
recommendations, released nine
months ago.
"The only change which actually
came about from the committee
recommendations," said Lovelock,
"was a new parking sticker. ..
enforcement is no better."
Administration officials who were
contacted had not had time to read
the report and therefore could offer
no comment.

increasing demand for bicycling
facilities among faculty, staff and
students alike," and for its current
construction "of a number of new
bicycle paths, segregated from existing
automobile traffic."

The administration is urged by the
study to adopt a "leadership role" to
set "an example for the Midpeninsula"
rather than act as a burden upon it.
Little Response
Lovelock explained that there has
been little University action in
response to the first publication or in
response to the administration's own
Parking and Traffic Committee
recommendations, released nine
months ago.
"The only change which actually
came about from the committee
recommendations," said Lovelock,
"was a new parking sticker. ..
enforcement is no better."
Administration officials who were
contacted had not had time to read
the report and therefore could offer
no comment.
A newly released transportation
study by a group of students and
recent graduates declares that Stanford
"is not acting responsibly in the field
of transportation planning and
management."

The report, a supplement to the
1971 SWOPSI publication, Balanced
Transportation Planning for Suburban
and Academic Communities, states
that automobile traffic on campus is
being subsidized by the University at
Lhe cost of more than $400,000 per
year.
According to Christopher Lovelock,
editor of both publications, operating
costs such as maintenance and
enforcement are not offset by
revenues from student parking fees
and parking violations, thereby
creating a deficit of $100,000 per
year. In addition, capital costs total
$300,000 per year.
The study recommends adoption of
a formal policy to make motor

vehicles pay their own way. This
would include a University-wide paid
vehicle registration program set at $20
per vehicle for faculty and students
and between $4 and $20 for staff
members, depending on salary- range.
No More Free Parking
"Nobody likes to be charged for
parking," the report states, "but free
parking is a luxury Stanford can no
longer afford."
Lovelock explained, "At present,
faculty and staff park free." He
continued, "People who don't travel
to campus by car, don't receive
comparable assistance. They don't get
free bus tickets or anything and this is
really inequitable."
The study states that Stanford has a

"financial responsibility to itself and
to its students and employees to
publicize existing transit services and
lobby for improvements."
Bulletin Boards
This would include erection of
bulletin boards containing transit maps
and schedules, revision of present
campus visitor maps to include local
bus and train stations, inclusion of
information on transit services with all
materials distributed to new students
and the possibility of purchasing
second-hand buses for lease to
employee and student groups in low
income neighborhoods to provide
low-cost commuter charter service
between these communities and the

campus.
The study recommends vigorous
enforcement of all vehicle registration
regulations. The University, according
to Lovelock, "is losing tens of
thousands of dollars through poor
enforcement . . . People are not
registering their cars when they should
be."
In January, a survey was taken of
approximately one dozen different
parking areas, comprising almost one
thousand parked automobiles, to
establish the extent of illegal parking.
The results showed that 327(35.1%) of
all cars surveyed had no parking
sticker at all, while another 127 bore a
sticker which did not entitle them to
park in their present locations. The
report concludes, "Almost one half of
all cars surveyed were illegally
parked!"
Other recommendations include
installation of parking meters at all
time limit visitor parking locations,
efforts to facilitate and encourage
formation of carpools, establishment
of six categories of parking areas, and
introduction of some variation of
staggered working hours on campus.
The study, a critical review of
progress made on recommendations in
the original report, asserts that
"socially and environmentally, the
University's transportation policies
display a lack of responsiveness to
known problems besetting the wider

community of which it is a part,
including air pollution, immobility of
low income groups and the growing
energy shortage."
Out Of Touch
Lovelock thinks the problem is that
the administration seems "to be out of
touch with the outside world. They've
done nothing to discourage
automobile use or make it pay its own
way, despite the fact the University
seems to have financial problems."

of six categories of parking areas, and
introduction of some variation of
staggered working hours on campus.
The study, a critical review of
progress made on recommendations in
the original report, asserts that
"socially and environmentally, the
University's transportation policies
display a lack of responsiveness to
known problems besetting the wider

community of which it is a part,
including air pollution, immobility of
low income groups and the growing
energy shortage."
Out Of Touch
Lovelock thinks the problem is that
the administration seems "to be out of
touch with the outside world. They've
done nothing to discourage
automobile use or make it pay its own
way, despite the fact the University
seems to have financial problems."
The report commends the
University for its recognition of "the
increasing demand for bicycling
facilities among faculty, staff and
students alike," and for its current
construction "of a number of new
bicycle paths, segregated from existing
automobile traffic."

The administration is urged by the
study to adopt a "leadership role" to
set "an example for the Midpeninsula"
rather than act as a burden upon it.
Little Response
Lovelock explained that there has
been little University action in
response to the first publication or in
response to the administration's own
Parking and Traffic Committee
recommendations, released nine
months ago.
"The only change which actually
came about from the committee
recommendations," said Lovelock,
"was a new parking sticker. ..
enforcement is no better."
Administration officials who were
contacted had not had time to read
the report and therefore could offer
no comment.
