# Cambodia Bombing Supports 'Tottering' Regime
## 
### DOYLE McMANUS BILL EVERS News Analysis 
The Pentagon's belated disclosure last
Tuesday of the official figures on the U.S.
bombing of Cambodia, and the House's
refusal Friday to transfer funds to cover the
costs of the continuing operation, point up
the fact that American military involvement
in Cambodia has vastly increased since the
signing of the Vietnam ceasefire on Jan. 27.
And while the political and military
situation in Cambodia remains in flux, it is
apparent that the Nixon Administration fully
intends to continue its bombing in support of
Marshal Lon Nol's increasingly unpopular
regime — with or without the consent of
Congress.
Administration spokesmen argue before
Congress that the raids are both
constitutionally and politically justified in
view of the alleged failure of North Vietnam
to withdraw its troops from Cambodia.
Official American sources in Phnom Penh,
however, say that while there are North
Vietnamese advisers in insurgent-held areas,

there is no documented proof that any
Vietnamese Communist troops serve in
combat roles in Cambodia.
Bombing Objectives
Instead, it appears that the real object of
the bombing is to aid the tottering
government of Lon Not against insurgents
who, while Communists are among them, are
relatively heterogeneous in political
orientation — and increasingly independent of
Vietnamese influence.
While Defense Secretary Elliot Richardson
openly avowed May 8 that the purpose of
American bombing is to preserve the Lon Nol
regime, he told the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee that Cambodia is in imminent
danger of falling to North Vietnam, and
warned that the North Vietnamese would like
to use the country as a "staging area" for
attacks on South Vietnam.
Yet American officials in Phnom Penh,
reports the New York Times, estimate that
there are only about 40,000 North
Vietnamese and National Liberation Front
(Viet Cong) logistics troops in Cambodia,
stationed along the border with South
Vietnam. Of those, not more than a third are

combat troops — and those are not interested
in attacking Phnom Penh, and may not be
interested in Cambodia at all, the American
sources said. A military spokesman for the
Lon Nol government admitted in January that
the remaining North Vietnamese were logistics
battalions. Vietnamese Communists may be
serving with Cambodian insurgent units as
advisers in some areas, but are apparently not
participating in current fighting around
Phnom Penh and the southern provincial
capital of Takeo.
Unprecedented Level
Meanwhile, American bombing of
Cambodia and Laos has been stepped up in
recent weeks to unprecedented levels. Deputy
Assistant Defense Secretary Dennis J. Doolin
told the House Armed Services Committee
Tuesday that U.S. planes had dropped 82,837
tons of bombs on Cambodia in 12,136 raids
between Jan. 27 (the date of the signing of
the Paris agreement) and April 30, at a cost of
$159.5 million.
Doolin, currently on leave from the Hoover
Institution, also said 63,082 tons had been
dropped on Laos during the same period, at a

cost of $99.2 million. The three-month figure
for Cambodia approaches the approximately
90,000 tons that were dropped on Cambodia
in all of 1970, and the bombardment shows
no sign of abating.
Some of the bombing has been in heavily
populated areas. In late April, a Christian
Science Monitor correspondent cited the
village of Prek Youn as an example of the
"needless damage inflicted on civilians" by
the air war. American ordnance unloaded over
the village had included anti-personnel cluster
bombs, and parts of the village were
devastated. Along with the bombs, the
American planes had dropped
Vietnamese-language leaflets, but inhabitants
of the village testified after that they have yet
to see any Vietnamese Communist troops;
only native Cambodian insurgents have been
in the area.
The insurgents have co-ordinated their
military activities, but political unity has thus
far eluded them. Sihanoukists,
anti-monarchists, nationalists, and
Communists are among the diverse political

elements now in active military opposition to
Lon Nol.
Rivalry Between Clans
In some respects, politics in Cambodia
takes the form of rivalry between clans, each
with its own group of dependents. These clans
have historically maneuvered for advantageous
political positions from which to reap the
material rewards and perquisites of office.
Two of the leading political figures in
Cambodia — Prince Norodom Sihanouk on
one side, Prince Sisowath Sirik Matak on the
other — are members of rival branches of the
Cambodian royal family.
Bearing this in mind, it is still possible to
describe a political spectrum in Cambodia. On
the left, according to Daniel Roy of Le Monde
Diplomatique, are the "reds," intellectuals of
lower class origin, young reformers, urban
laborers, teachers, and liberals who want to
avoid a foreign policy that would give the U.S.
the dominant influence in the country.
This group is represented militarily by the
original Khmer Rouge, a group of communists
and left nationalists that fought against
Sihanouk in the 1960's and is now
allied with him against Lon Nol.
Best Organized
The original Khmer Rouge is
the best organized of the
opposition groups. Its leadership
includes Communist Party
members and three leftist former
National Assembly deputies. The
Far Eastern Economic Review
describes this leadership as
"effective and extremely
intelligent" both "for negotiation
and administration."
Next come students and urban
intelligentsia who are
anti-monarchist and who, in the
spring of 1970, went into battle
against the North Vietnamese.
The corruption of the Lon Nol
government and the brutality of
its South Vietnamese allies led
these intellectuals to join the
opposition to the Phnom Penh
government.
In the middle lies the great
bulk of the population, which is
Sihanoukist. This group,
composed largely of peasants and
small landowners, is strongly
opposed to communism. The
Sihanoukist farmers dislike the
communist goal of eventual
nationalization of their land.
Peking politically backs the
Sihanoukists, while Moscow and
Hanoi prefer the original Khmer
Rouge.
Sihanouk himself remains a
deft politician and is revered in
some rural areas as a "god-king."
U.S. Alliance
On the right are the "blues" —
business, military, and other
elements that support the Lon
Nol government and an alliance
with the United States. Lon Nol
came to power in March, 1970, in
a rightist coup.

Observers (in this case, Mark
Gayn of the Toronto Star)
describe his administration as
"politically inept, shamelessly
corrupt, and callously indifferent
to public well-being."
Knowledgeable Western sources
say some generals at the front are
selling their U.S.-supplied
ammunition to the insurgents — as
well as many of their essential
supplies, including fuel and rice.
Last fall, Lon Nol's personal
physician was driven to resign
from his post as a presidential
adviser after the press revealed
that he had sold much of Phnom
Penh's rice reserve to the
Communists in a time when food
shortages had driven soldiers and
civilians to a three-day riot.
Under a system where the
government pays its armed forces
through the unit commanders,
officers routinely pad their rosters
with the names of nonexistent
soldiers — to the point where
Minister of Information Keam
Reth told a press conference early
this year that 80,000 of the men
on the army's payroll of 300,000
did not exist at all.
Fictitious 'Children'
Boys as young as eight are
sometimes enlisted and payed
'allowances' by their officers —
who then collect the official
salary, often augmented by
dependents' payments for the
boys' fictitious 'children.'
On the third anniversary of the
1970 coup, Sihanouk's son-in-law
stole an air force jet and
attempted to bomb the
Presidential Palace, Lon Nol's
official residence.
Lon Nol used this isolated act
as justification for martial law,
and suspended the
constitutionally-guaranteed

freedoms of speech, thought,
assembly, and press as well as the
rights to privacy of residence and
correspondence. Political
dissenters were imprisoned, and
emigration from the country was
made extremely difficult.
Problematic
The prospects for a settlement
of the military and political
conflict in Cambodia can only be
described as problematic. The
Nixon Administration apparently
does not want a ceasefire until the
Lon Nol government is in a
stronger negotiating position, but
the Administration is using its
charges of North Vietnamese
ceasefire violations to build
pressure for an eventual
settlement.
The Lon Nol government in
late April announced that it
would enter negotiations with the
insurgents once all North
Vietnamese troops had left
Cambodia. With Peking's backing,
however, Sihanouk adamantly
refuses to negotiate with Lon
Nol's government, though he is
willing to talk to the American
government.
Finally, the U.S., the Soviet
Union, France, Great Britain, and
the Lon Nol government (which is
diplomatically recognized by
these powers, including the Soviet
Union) desire an internationally
supervised ceasefire between the
U.S., Lon Nol, and Sihanouk.
Sihanouk wants a bilateral
agreement with the U.S. and
opposes international supervision.
But it is apparent that the
bombing will go on for the time
being — probably even in spite of
Congressional action to cut off
funds. The House Thursday
denied President Nixon's
$430-million defense-spending

transfer request, which included
at least $175 million to cover past
and future bombing. Secretary
Richardson has said, however,
that the bombing effort "to force
a Cambodia ceasefire" would not
be obstructed by Congressional
fund cutoffs or rejection of
transfer authority, and that the
Administration would transfer
funds on its own authority to
finance the continued air war.
