# Cambodia Bombing Supports 'Tottering' Regime
## 
### DOYLE McMANUS BILL EVERS News Analysis 
The Pentagon's belated disclosure last
Tuesday of the official figures on the U.S.
bombing of Cambodia, and the House's
refusal Friday to transfer funds to cover the
costs of the continuing operation, point up
the fact that American military involvement
in Cambodia has vastly increased since the
signing of the Vietnam ceasefire on Jan. 27.
And while the political and military
situation in Cambodia remains in flux, it is
apparent that the Nixon Administration fully
intends to continue its bombing in support of
Marshal Lon Nol's increasingly unpopular
regime — with or without the consent of
Congress.
Administration spokesmen argue before
Congress that the raids are both
constitutionally and politically justified in
view of the alleged failure of North Vietnam
to withdraw its troops from Cambodia.
Official American sources in Phnom Penh,
however, say that while there are North
Vietnamese advisers in insurgent-held areas,

there is no documented proof that any
Vietnamese Communist troops serve in
combat roles in Cambodia.
Bombing Objectives
Instead, it appears that the real object of
the bombing is to aid the tottering
government of Lon Not against insurgents
who, while Communists are among them, are
relatively heterogeneous in political
orientation — and increasingly independent of
Vietnamese influence.
While Defense Secretary Elliot Richardson
openly avowed May 8 that the purpose of
American bombing is to preserve the Lon Nol
regime, he told the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee that Cambodia is in imminent
danger of falling to North Vietnam, and
warned that the North Vietnamese would like
to use the country as a "staging area" for
attacks on South Vietnam.
Yet American officials in Phnom Penh,
reports the New York Times, estimate that
there are only about 40,000 North
Vietnamese and National Liberation Front
(Viet Cong) logistics troops in Cambodia,
stationed along the border with South
Vietnam. Of those, not more than a third are

combat troops — and those are not interested
in attacking Phnom Penh, and may not be
interested in Cambodia at all, the American
sources said. A military spokesman for the
Lon Nol government admitted in January that
the remaining North Vietnamese were logistics
battalions. Vietnamese Communists may be
serving with Cambodian insurgent units as
advisers in some areas, but are apparently not
participating in current fighting around
Phnom Penh and the southern provincial
capital of Takeo.
Unprecedented Level
Meanwhile, American bombing of
Cambodia and Laos has been stepped up in
recent weeks to unprecedented levels. Deputy
Assistant Defense Secretary Dennis J. Doolin
told the House Armed Services Committee
Tuesday that U.S. planes had dropped 82,837
tons of bombs on Cambodia in 12,136 raids
between Jan. 27 (the date of the signing of
the Paris agreement) and April 30, at a cost of
$159.5 million.
Doolin, currently on leave from the Hoover
Institution, also said 63,082 tons had been
dropped on Laos during the same period, at a

cost of $99.2 million. The three-month figure
for Cambodia approaches the approximately
90,000 tons that were dropped on Cambodia
in all of 1970, and the bombardment shows
no sign of abating.
Some of the bombing has been in heavily
populated areas. In late April, a Christian
Science Monitor correspondent cited the
village of Prek Youn as an example of the
"needless damage inflicted on civilians" by
the air war. American ordnance unloaded over
the village had included anti-personnel cluster
bombs, and parts of the village were
devastated. Along with the bombs, the
American planes had dropped
Vietnamese-language leaflets, but inhabitants
of the village testified after that they have yet
to see any Vietnamese Communist troops;
only native Cambodian insurgents have been
in the area.
The insurgents have co-ordinated their
military activities, but political unity has thus
far eluded them. Sihanoukists,
anti-monarchists, nationalists, and
Communists are among the diverse political

elements now in active military opposition to
Lon Nol.
Rivalry Between Clans
In some respects, politics in Cambodia
takes the form of rivalry between clans, each
with its own group of dependents. These clans
have historically maneuvered for advantageous
political positions from which to reap the
material rewards and perquisites of office.
Two of the leading political figures in
Cambodia — Prince Norodom Sihanouk on
one side, Prince Sisowath Sirik Matak on the
other — are members of rival branches of the
Cambodian royal family.
Bearing this in mind, it is still possible to
describe a political spectrum in Cambodia. On
the left, according to Daniel Roy of Le Monde
Diplomatique, are the "reds," intellectuals of
lower class origin, young reformers, urban
laborers, teachers, and liberals who want to
avoid a foreign policy that would give the U.S.
the dominant influence in the country.
This group is represented militarily by the
original Khmer Rouge, a group of communists
and left nationalists that fought against
