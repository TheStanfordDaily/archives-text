# Paternalism In The Universities
## On Liberal Racism 
### 
Chris Hocker

The phrase "liberal racism" has
been a familiar one to many
people on the Right for some
years now. The most-frequently
cited examples of this
phenomenon are those instances
in which a paragon of liberal
virtue, say George McGovern, is
found sending his children to a
well-protected, lily-white private
institution instead of the
neighborhood integrated school.
Other specific examples rarely
go beyond this sort of thing,
probably because the word
"racism" is tricky to define.
Usually, its meaning can be made
to conform to the
Humpty-Dumpty formula, by
which "words mean what I want
them to mean."
Hard evidence is available,
however, vyhich gives a good
indication of the extent to which
liberal racism has permeated
certain parts of society, notably
higher education. Thomas Sowell,
a UCLA economist, has studied
this problem for some time, and
has recently published a book,
Black Education: Myths and
Tragedies, which details instances
of racist attitudes on the part of
institutional liberals.
Stereotype
Sowell, a black man, contends
that colleges and universities are
deliberately passu % up highly
talented and qualitied blacks in
favor of less-qualified individuals
who more accurately fit the
stereotype of what a
ghetto-raised, * militant,
downtrodden, discriminated
against black is "supposed" to be.
To illustrate his thesis, Sowell
cites the case of a black woman
rejected by Cornell University.
According to Cornell, this
individual's "cultural and
educational background did not
indicate deprivation to the extent
necessary for qualification."
This reasoning appalls Sowell,
and he is not alone.
In another instance, Sowell
describes recruitment policies of
certain programs under the
Department of Health, Education,
and Welfare. "Talent Search"
makes it a point to aid black

students whose high school grades
range from D+ to B-, while the
Council on Legal Educational
Opportunity, intended for
prospective black law students,
confine their help to students
whose Law Boards do not exceed
500.
Editorial
In Sowell's opinion, these cases
are a clear illustration of the
liberal attitude that a black person
is not "really" black unless he
behaves a certain way — the way
the liberals think a black should
act.
This is racism, at least under
the definition of the term which
means "to judge a person or
persons primarily on the basis of
their race."
This attitude is not missing at
Stanford, either among
administration or students. One
glaring example occurred in a
Daily editorial of about ten days
ago, when recommendations were
made for Palo Alot City Council.
Incredible
One of the candidates for the
Council was Roy Clay, a member
of the more conservative Palo
Alto '73 slate. In explaining why
Clay did not receive an
endorsement, the Daily made the
following incredible statement:
"Roy Clay, who is black, is not
a spokesman for the city's
minority groups. He has instead
shown himself to represent the
real estate development interests
which domianted the city during
most of the 19605."
There are a number of
implications in such a statement:
(1) That a minority candidate
should speak for his group,
instead of merely for himself;
Interests
(2) That to be a successful real
estate developer is to be in
conflict with the interests of the
minority group; and
(3) That the Editorial Board of
the Stanford Daily is uniquely
qualified to judge what are the
interests of Palo Alto minority
groups, as a collective entity, and
to determine that Roy Clay,
despite his color, isn't a "real"
black.

This is just one more example
of the kind of attitude Thomas
Sowell talks about in his book —
an attitude which is patronizing,
paternalistic, and racist.
And this same attitude will
persist among the so-called
enlightened liberal elitists until
the notions of "group interests"
and "collective identities" give
way to the view of each man and
woman as separate, unique
individuals who should be dealt
with only on an individual basis.
