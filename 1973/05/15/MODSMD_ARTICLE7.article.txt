# Amnesty International
## Helping Political Prisoners 
### 
Sidney Block

"The political prisoner's greatest fear is being forgotten. His gratitude
to anybody or any organization that keeps him alive in the outside
world is humble and boundless. "
Thus the words of a Ugandan magazine editor after his release from
prison. One organization that refuses to forget, and persists in
reminding governments that the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, to which most are signatories, provides for freedom of
thought, conscience, and religion, is Amnesty International.
Founded in 1961 by an English lawyer, Amnesty works for the
release of persons who are "imprisoned, detained, restricted, or
otherwise subjected to physical coercion or restraint by reason of
their political, religious, or other conscientiously held belief or by
reason of their ethnic origin, color, or language, provided that they
have not used or advocated violence." Such persons may become
"prisoners of conscience," and be "adopted" by Amnesty.
Groups
How does Amnesty work? At its London headquarters, a research
staff considers material received from a variety of sources about
prospective prisoners of conscience. Once convinced that the prisoner
is eligible for support, the full case study is sent to one of 1100 groups

located in 28 countries throughout the world.
Each group is assigned three prisoners — always prisoners of a
nationality other than their own, and distributed among the
ideological forces of the East, West, and Third World. The group then
campaigns to persuade the respective state to release its prisoner — to
grant amnesty.
A variety of methods is adopted: letters to the leaders of the
government concerned, visits to the local embassy, use of private
contacts with local business organizations, churches, and professional
associations, publicity in the home media, agitation in Congress or
Parliament. The approach, in large part, is one of meddling, of
creating a nuisance.
Support
The prisoner and his family are supported throughout the
campaign with friendship and often financial aid. The essential
objectives: freedom of the prisoner and recognition of Articles five,
nine, 18, and 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Once an adopted priosner is released (and Amnesty's record is
gratifyingly substantial here)there is a gigantic international 'reservoir'
from which to acquire another prisoner. Groups unfortunately never
run out of clients.
Amnesty International works in other areas too. It sends
investigation teams to certain countries to gather data on the abuse of
prisoners, particularly the widespread use of torture. Amnesty reports
on the atrocious treatment of political prisoners in Greece contributed
significantly to the forced resignation of Greece from the Council of
Europe for violation of the European Declaration on Human Rights.
Ireland
More recently, reports have been published drawing attention to
allegations of ill treatment in Northern Ireland and allegations of
torture in Brazil. In 1973, Amnesty is conducting an international
campaign for the abolition of torture.
The organization has substantiated thousands of cases of torture in
Western, Communist bloc, and Third World countries alike. Torture
knows no boundaries, geographical, political or ideological. Its growth
is epidemic, and it seems to become contagious. The aim of Amnesty's
campaign this year is the total abolition of torture, and to make
torture as unthinkable as slavery.
You can play a significant role by working in the newly-established
Stanford group of Amnesty. At this stage, we have two assigned
prisoners, a Spaniard charged with "illegal association and
propaganda," and a Brazilian lawyer whom we know relatively little
about. We will be allocated a prisoner in a Communist bloc country
shortly. Our task is to help free these people. If you would like to join
the campus Amnesty group or are interested to learn more about
Amnesty, please contact Sidney Bloch at 327-0129.

Rights, to which most are signatories, provides for freedom of
thought, conscience, and religion, is Amnesty International.
Founded in 1961 by an English lawyer, Amnesty works for the
release of persons who are "imprisoned, detained, restricted, or
otherwise subjected to physical coercion or restraint by reason of
their political, religious, or other conscientiously held belief or by
reason of their ethnic origin, color, or language, provided that they
have not used or advocated violence." Such persons may become
"prisoners of conscience," and be "adopted" by Amnesty.
Groups
How does Amnesty work? At its London headquarters, a research
staff considers material received from a variety of sources about
prospective prisoners of conscience. Once convinced that the prisoner
is eligible for support, the full case study is sent to one of 1100 groups

located in 28 countries throughout the world.
Each group is assigned three prisoners — always prisoners of a
nationality other than their own, and distributed among the
ideological forces of the East, West, and Third World. The group then
campaigns to persuade the respective state to release its prisoner — to
grant amnesty.
A variety of methods is adopted: letters to the leaders of the
government concerned, visits to the local embassy, use of private
contacts with local business organizations, churches, and professional
associations, publicity in the home media, agitation in Congress or
Parliament. The approach, in large part, is one of meddling, of
creating a nuisance.
Support
The prisoner and his family are supported throughout the
campaign with friendship and often financial aid. The essential
objectives: freedom of the prisoner and recognition of Articles five,
nine, 18, and 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Once an adopted priosner is released (and Amnesty's record is
gratifyingly substantial here)there is a gigantic international 'reservoir'
from which to acquire another prisoner. Groups unfortunately never
run out of clients.
Amnesty International works in other areas too. It sends
investigation teams to certain countries to gather data on the abuse of
prisoners, particularly the widespread use of torture. Amnesty reports
on the atrocious treatment of political prisoners in Greece contributed
significantly to the forced resignation of Greece from the Council of
Europe for violation of the European Declaration on Human Rights.
Ireland
More recently, reports have been published drawing attention to
allegations of ill treatment in Northern Ireland and allegations of
torture in Brazil. In 1973, Amnesty is conducting an international
campaign for the abolition of torture.
The organization has substantiated thousands of cases of torture in
Western, Communist bloc, and Third World countries alike. Torture
knows no boundaries, geographical, political or ideological. Its growth
is epidemic, and it seems to become contagious. The aim of Amnesty's
campaign this year is the total abolition of torture, and to make
torture as unthinkable as slavery.
You can play a significant role by working in the newly-established
Stanford group of Amnesty. At this stage, we have two assigned
prisoners, a Spaniard charged with "illegal association and
propaganda," and a Brazilian lawyer whom we know relatively little
about. We will be allocated a prisoner in a Communist bloc country
shortly. Our task is to help free these people. If you would like to join
the campus Amnesty group or are interested to learn more about
Amnesty, please contact Sidney Bloch at 327-0129.
