SUMMARY REPORT ON STUDENT DISCIPLINARY ACTION
The University Administration filed charges for viola
tion of the Honor Code against a student who submitted
a take-home final examination on which unpermitted aid
was received.
Before turning in the exam, the student charged read
another student's exam which was obtained through no
fault of the other student.
At the request of the student charged, the Dean of
Student Atfairs heard the case and recommended that
the student be denied credit for the course. The instruc
tor in the course concurred, and the President approved
the recommendation. The dean noted that such denial of
credit might prevent graduation at the end of the current
quarter as the student had planned.

Charges were brought by the University Administra
tion for violation of the Honor Code against a student
for revising and resubmitting a quiz for regrading.
At the request of the student charged, the Dean of
Student Atlairs heard the case and recommended in light
of mitigating circumstances that the student be per
mitted to give two hours weekly to serve as an aide in
the department where the Honor Code violation occur
red in lieu of suspension from the University for the
remainder of the current quarter or for Fall Quarter
1973.
The purpose of having the student serve as an aide in
checking in homework, reports, and other similar materi
als is to put the student in close contact with the
purpose and function of the grading system.
The dean's recommendation was approved by the
President.
