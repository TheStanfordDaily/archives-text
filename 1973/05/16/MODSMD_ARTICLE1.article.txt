Stanford Trustee Warren Minor
Christopher appeared yesterday to be
U.S. Atty. Gen.-designate Elliot L.
Richardson's most likely choice for
special Watergate prosecutor.
Richardson had said Monday that
Christopher and three other persons
were on "a list of finalists" for the
appointment. One finalist, U.S.
District Judge Harold R. Tyler Jr., of
New York, yesterday withdrew his
name from consideration because he
was reluctant to resign from the
judiciary.
Christopher, 47, is a Stanford Law
School alumnus and is currently a
member of the Law School's Board of
Visitors. Law School Dean Thomas
Ehrlich and Associate Dean J. Keith
Mann refused to comment about
Christopher unless he is appointed.

Chairman James 0. Eastland
(D-Miss.) of the Senate Judiciary
Committee told newsmen after
meeting privately with Richardson
that Christopher would be a good
choice as an independent prosecutor
for the Watergate scandal. "He'd run
the show or quit," said Eastland.
Sen. John V. Tunney (D-Calif.), a
member o f the Judiciary Committee,
said yesterday that Christopher would
be "100 percent acceptable" to him.
"He'd be totally impartial,
independent and fair," according to
Tunney.
During Tunney's 1970 campaign
for the Senate, Christopher chaired the
Friends of John V. Tunney South, Inc.
A Sept. 1970 article in Scanlan's
Monthly purported to show that
Christopher was the mastermind
behind Tunney's attempt to make
Congressman George Brown, his
Democratic primary opponent, appear
to be anti-Israel and in favor of
terrorism in the United States.
Christopher has been a partner
since 1958 in the Los Angeles law firm
of O'Melveny and Myers, which the
Scanlan's article said had "been
instrumental in electing" Tunney, Sen.
Alan Cranston, former Gov. Edmund
G. Brown and Gov. Ronald W. Reagan.

Christopher served, briefly in 1959
as Brown's special counsel and was
vice chairman of the governor's
commission which investigated the
Watts riot of 1965.
In July 1967, President Lyndon
Johnson appointed Christopher
deputy attorney general under Ramsey
Clark. The President praised
Christopher as an "able, experienced
young man." Soon after assuming
office, Christopher was sent to Detroit
as the Justice Department's ranking
official present during the rioting
there.
As deputy attorney general until
Jan. 1969, Christopher was Johnson's
principal civilian adviser on urban
disorders and riots.
After his graduation from Law
School here in 1949, Christopher
served as the law clerk for U.S.
Supreme Court Justice William O.
Douglas for one year and then joined
O'Melveny and Myers.
The alumni elected Christopher as a
trustee last year.

Christopher appeared yesterday to be
U.S. Atty. Gen.-designate Elliot L.
Richardson's most likely choice for
special Watergate prosecutor.
Richardson had said Monday that
Christopher and three other persons
were on "a list of finalists" for the
appointment. One finalist, U.S.
District Judge Harold R. Tyler Jr., of
New York, yesterday withdrew his
name from consideration because he
was reluctant to resign from the
judiciary.
Christopher, 47, is a Stanford Law
School alumnus and is currently a
member of the Law School's Board of
Visitors. Law School Dean Thomas
Ehrlich and Associate Dean J. Keith
Mann refused to comment about
Christopher unless he is appointed.

Chairman James 0. Eastland
(D-Miss.) of the Senate Judiciary
Committee told newsmen after
meeting privately with Richardson
that Christopher would be a good
choice as an independent prosecutor
for the Watergate scandal. "He'd run
the show or quit," said Eastland.
Sen. John V. Tunney (D-Calif.), a
member o f the Judiciary Committee,
said yesterday that Christopher would
be "100 percent acceptable" to him.
"He'd be totally impartial,
independent and fair," according to
Tunney.
During Tunney's 1970 campaign
for the Senate, Christopher chaired the
Friends of John V. Tunney South, Inc.
A Sept. 1970 article in Scanlan's
Monthly purported to show that
Christopher was the mastermind
behind Tunney's attempt to make
Congressman George Brown, his
Democratic primary opponent, appear
to be anti-Israel and in favor of
terrorism in the United States.
Christopher has been a partner
since 1958 in the Los Angeles law firm
of O'Melveny and Myers, which the
Scanlan's article said had "been
instrumental in electing" Tunney, Sen.

Johnson appointed Christopher
deputy attorney general under Ramsey
Clark. The President praised
Christopher as an "able, experienced
young man." Soon after assuming
