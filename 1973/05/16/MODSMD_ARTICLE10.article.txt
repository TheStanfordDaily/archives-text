# When 'Justice' Is Injustice
## In The Matter Of Doug And Andrea Burt 
### 
Peter Goldtcheider

I recently returned from a stay
in San Bernadino where I
attended the trial of Doug and
Andrea Holman Burt. People in
the Stanford community, if they
are attuned to current events at
all, are probably aware of the
basic circumstances of the trial.
The prosecution of the
defendents for the crimes of
murder and escape hinges
primarily upon the testimony of
one man, the admitted organizer

of those crimes — Ronald Wayne
Beaty. Mr. Beaty was being
cross-examined at the time of my
visit by Charles Garry, and several
impressions came to my mind at
that time.
In the history of the radical
and labor movements in this
country, frameups, company
and/or government inspired, have
taken certain familiar patterns.
One has been that those
prosecuted have often been

engaged in organizing or
supportive legal-oriented
activities. Doug Burt was a 'prison
lawyer' who continued his interest
in aiding inmates in their
problems within the prisons after
he was released. Andrea Hoi man
Burt was similarly involved.
IWW
The second thing that struck
me about this prosecution fitting
into a pattern was Mr. Beaty
himself. About sixty years ago a
character named Harry Orchard
testified that Bill Haywood of the
IWW and other union men had
been part of a conspiracy to
murder the former governor of
Idaho (which Orchard had been
involved in) and other illegal
activities.
Mr. Orchard was an interesting
character. He was verbose, an
honest-looking chap and quite
charismatic. At different points in
his life, he himself did not know
where his loyalties lay. At times
he thought himself a union man,
even an anti-establishment figure.
At other times he clearly
understood that his only loyalty
was to himself and that he must
pursue that interest actively.
He attempted to fabricate
connections with various groups
and individuals, and ingratiated
himself with people whom he
might later use. He acted
independently in committing
certain crimes (murder) and only
afterwards collaborated with the
government officials who were
attempting to crush the "red
menace." Orchard, who had an
elaborate history of criminal
activity, said that he had suddenly

seen God; that was the reason for
his testimony against the others.
Connections
Ronald Wayne Beaty, a
sincere-looking, loquacious and
physically attractive man was at
various times in his life aligned
with Nazis, the Mexican Mafia,
the revolutionary movement and
finally the FBI. While he has never
embraced any loyalty to anything
he was always attempting to make
connections.
He wrote to prison lawyer
Faye Stender describing his
radical political loyalties in an
attempt to smuggle a message to
the late George Jackson, the
substance of which being that
Jackson should lie about
knowing Beaty for the purpose of
aiding Beaty's defense in a trial.
He feigned loyalty with Nazis and
others in arranging his first escape
in 1970. His story at that time
was that the two people he was
charged with kidnapping were
actually helping him escape.
The government did not
believe this story — but it is ironic
and perhaps more than
coincidental that now, when his

story involves revolutionaries, he
is suddenly on the side of the
government. Beaty, with a record
of six felony convictions, said he
suddenly felt bad about the dead
guard and felt sympathy for the
child whose parents he had helped
send to jail. This change
apparently occurred only after he
was apprehended.
Fabrication
It is unfortunate that the press
has picked up only that testimony
of Beaty's that attempts to
implicate the defendents and
ignores placing him in the context
of those, such as the "informer"
in the Berrigans' trial, who have
fabricated testimony for their
own purposes. In all cases of this
sort, when radicals and others
who actively challenge injustice
are under attack, honest people
should inquire into all the facts.
In the age of Watergate, the
Pentagon Papers, and Grand Jury
radical hunts, "justice" is often
injustice and law and order often
a cover for encroaching fascism.
