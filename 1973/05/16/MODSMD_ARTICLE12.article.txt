A Schizoid Reaction
Editor:
As students we are shocked to
find next year's Dollies so
blatantly pro-Communist. Pinkos
of this type are not needed at
Stanford. We urge that the Dollies
resign.

Editor:
The 50s have indeed returned.
At least, according to the Dollies
(May 14). We of the Emergency
Committee to Stave Off a Return
to the Fifties and to Preserve
Open-Mindedness recommend the
following emergency action to all
our members:
I.leave
2. hide in the hills
We, alas, have thrown in the
towel.

Image-Shattering
Editor:
The eternal quest to "get
involved" yet not "cause a lot of
problems" has found some noble
(nubile?) young recruits. Some of
this year's image-shattering
Stanford Dollies give us cause for
hope in the three M's of American
women: Marriage, Motherhood
and Men. It's really nice to see
such eagerness to accomplish
meaningful goals in life, especially
to "have something to do" if one
has to work. Not that women

should get jobs, mind you. They
"were created to get married," so
naturally they should stay home
and take care of the children
afterward.
What are we poor, horny
Stanford boys to do before
marriage and all the wifely duties
that accompany it? Ye Gods, the
price of women is high enough at
$55 a throw. It's a comfort to
know that we can get it free,
watching the Dollies for our

jollies. Who needs the Phi Delts?
Not that these lovelies are selling
their bodies. They just like to
dance and prance for the aesthetic
kick it gives them. Perhaps we
should give them credit for
fulfilling a crucial need at
Stanford. Besides, girls will be
girls.
