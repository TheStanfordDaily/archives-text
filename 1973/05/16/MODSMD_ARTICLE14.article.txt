Is there anyone on campus
with a complete and up-to-date
listing of local day care centers?
Any evaluations available? J.M.
No, there doesn't seem to be.
The Children's Center of the
Stanford Community has a list
but according to a worker there,
the list is out of date.
There will be two day care
centers on campus next fall. They
are the Children's Center, at 591
Mayfield Avenue, and the
Escondido Cooperative Nursery
School, which is scheduled to
open in September. (The first
registration period for the
Escondido Co-op is scheduled for
this afternoon from 1 until 5 in
Apt. 82E in Escondido Village.)
A quick trip through the
Yellow Pages brings forth other

Why has Campus Drive been
resurfaced where it seemed to

need it least — by the Cowell
Health Center and in front of
Florence Moore — when the
stretch between Alvarado Row
and Lasuen is full of bumps and
potholes and is a serious hazard to
bicycle riders? Is repair of this
section being planned? R.M.
According to Roads and
Grounds Manager Perry Hackett,
the section of Campus Drive
between Flo Mo and Cowell was
beginning to show signs of wear
because of the number of heavy
construction trucks that travel on
it. Because that section of Campus
Drive will continue to be used for
traffic, it was repaved before the
condition of the road got too bad.
In an article in the Daily (May
2, 1973), it was announced that as
part of the University's "Dynamic
Steady State" plan, several streets
would be turned into pedestrian
malls. One of these planned malls
is the section of Campus Drive
between Alvarado Row and
Lasuen.
Hackett commented that it
wouldn't make too much sense to
repave a road that was going to be
converted to a mall, so there are
no plans for repaving that section.

1 understand that the
University publishes a schedule of
suggested dates for midterms in
various departments. Each time a
midterm is announced in my
organic chemistry class, there is a
major uproar because of conflicts
with bio or econ midterms. Is
there any way that this schedule
can be more widely publicized
and enforced? J.H.
Venetia Gleason, Room
Scheduling and Exam secretary in
the Registrar's office, said that in
the 3V2 years she has been working
at Stanford, a schedule of
suggested midterm dates has not
come to her attention. She said
that midterm scheduling is
handled through the separate
departments.
