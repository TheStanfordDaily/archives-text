# Hayman May Get School Job
## 
### 
Roble Hall resident fellow
Warren Hayman will apparently
be named permanent
superintendent of the
Ravenswood Elementary School
district, following the resignation
yesterday of John Cleveland just
two weeks before he was to
assume the post.
Cleveland, director of Urban
Education at Cal State San Diego,
was hired in March to succeed
former Supt. John Minor.
Hayman assumed Minor's duties
as acting superintendent last
October, and was one of the
candidates for the permanent job.

However, East Palo Alto voters
last month elected a slate of
school board candidates favorable
to Hayman. The new board
almost immediately began to
explore ways to give Hayman the
permanent position.
Hayman yesterday said that "I
don't have any idea" when, or if,
he'll be appointed to fill the
permanent job.
Cleveland's resignation
apparently ends the months-old
controversy, which saw a one-day
boycott by nearly half the
district's 4700 students to
demonstrate support for Hayman.
