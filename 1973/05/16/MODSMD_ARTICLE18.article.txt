# Feliciano Pleases Audience With 'Out-Of-Soul' Singing
## 
### DAN BRENNER 
Viva Feliciano! — that was the exclamation
coming from over 1200 patrons of De Anza
College's Flint Center Saturday night for one
of America's most talented pop guitarists.
Feliciano in concert is faithful to the high
quality of his studio recordings.
Tremendously talented, with just the right
cabaret influence in his patter between
numbers, he seems happy and at ease on stage
and generates that feeling to his audience.
His artistry with the guitar is a show in
itself. Feliciano used three guitars for this
show: a six string; a cuatro (ten strings) and a
rhythm electric. On some numbers he would
play with only one hand, strumming and
fretting with five fingers. On others he would
move his fret hand to the tuning pegs and
change notes by twisting.
But what has for me been the mark of
Feliciano as a superstar is that out-of-his-soul
voice. Ever since his monster, "Light My
Fire," with which he concluded the De Anza
show, Feliciano has shown that singing along
with the music is not the only way to produce
beautiful sounds.
Magical Lyrics
The result of this unsynchronized music is
a performer trying to emphasize the magic
and meaning of lyrics more than the
commonplace harmony which exists in almost
all music.
Thus, Feliciano turns "Satisfaction," into a
number quite unlike its rock version. The
same may be said for "I'll Be There," and
"Love Train." And, while his arrangement of
the super-hit "You Are The Sunshine of My
Life" lacked the pleasing musical progression

of Stevie Wonder's version, the Feliciano voice
applied to lyrics so meaningful sung by a blind
person triggered enthusiastic and sustained
applause.
Of course, his familiar repertoire of "Listen
To The Rain," "California Dreaming" (he
threw in "Cupertino" in one of the verses, to
the pleasure of his generally mod (read
stylishly square) fans, "Light My Fire" was
what the people had come to see. It is to
Feliciano's credit that he did not shy away
from these hits, however unfulfilling their
performance may now be for him.
Versatility
During the patter sessions, Feliciano
demonstrated an entertaining versatility as a
humorist. His impersonation of Marlon
Brando's Don Coreleone was a crack-up; and
his introduction of "Light My Fire" as "I
would now like to play for you a medley of
my hit" brought the house closer to the
performer.
Feliciano was accompanied by a bass
player who did not shine and a dummer who
did. Moreover, in his rendition of "Crocodile
Rock," the star showed that this could easily
have been a one-man show.
A word about Flint Center: probably the
most beautiful and acoustically perfected
concert hall in Northern California, it is a
shame that this 2500-capacity building has an
out-to-lunch staff running lights and stage.
When the follow spotlight people weren't
experimenting with the rainbow on the
performer's face, they were toying with the
size of the spot. Particularly unnecessary was
the use of a single spot on the guitar in order
to accentuate its color. The end result of this

bright idea was to reflect a glare throughout
the auditorium.
Late Start
The stage crew was another sore. The
performance began 25 minutes late with the
crew setting up during the delay. A "short set,
change" between Williamson and Feliciano
lasted 20 minutes sans snack bar. And the
audio produced feedback often enough to be
noticeable.
With such a wonderful auditorium and an
excellent schedule (Vladamir Ashkenazy is
next) it is a shame to have such dingdongs at
the switch. (In fairness, however, it should be
noted that the concluding lighting of
Feliciano, a bright yellow undercut by an
orange border almost made up for the rest of
the night.)
Expertise
But when it came down to pleasing the
people, Feliciano did it by singing and playing
with emotion and expertise. As the words
from "A Simple Song," a cut off his new
album "Compartments," goes: "The words
are very simple, but the feeling comes on
strong."
Also appearing was a Carol King-er named 1
Cris Williamson, who rendered several of her
own compositions for guitar and piano. She
has a fine singing voice and writes well. Her |
piece dedicated to Wounded Knee was the ,
finest number, in my opinion.
Yet unlike the main act, she lacked the I
stage presence which prevented her from
establishing a rapport with the people. Also,
owing to the sound system, she spoke too fast
to be understood.
