## Testament To Two Giants Rodin's 'Balzac' Exhibited 
### JOHN LOOMIS 
A testament to two giants is
now on view at the Stanford
Museum. These two giants are the
French writer Honore de Balzac
and the French sculptor Auguste
Rodin. The show consists of
works from the nearly fifty
studies made by Rodin for a
monument to the deceased
Balzac.
They span a time period from
1891-98. When in 1898 Rodin
was finally pressured by his
commissioners, the Societe des
Gens des Lettres, to show his final
work, the result of years of
search, experiment, and change, it
created a national scandal of
incredible magnitude and has

become a landmark of modern
sculpture.
To Rodin, Balzac represented
an extremely fascinating figure.
There are many interesting
similarities between the two men.
Both were the recognized masters
in their own art during their own

time. Both had a phenomenal
drive in their work and were
relentless in pursuing excellence.
Moreover, both lived their lives
with the utmost gusto.
Many Sources
As can be seen in the show,
Rodin drew from many sources in
his studies for Balzac: old
photographs, various living models
who resembled him in one way or

another, and newspaper
caricatures. Especially interesting
is this use of caricatures and then
his own exaggerations in an
attempt to arrive at what was the
essence of Balzac, an essence that
transcends the purely visual.
In making a monument to a

great man, Rodin was acting
completely within the role of a
19th century sculptor. However,
this concern with the 'essential'
places him far ahead of his time.
Twentieth century modern
sculpture that focuses upon the
'essential' and the 'minimal,' is
rooted in part in Rodin's Balzac.
More than just a portrait of
Balzac, the exhibition is a

portrait of Rodin, the evolution
of his ideas, his thought process."
Along with the sculptures is a
photo-essay tracing Rodin's
different concepts throughout the
years and further showing how
Rodin's final project came about.
Casting Viewed
Sadly, the final work of Balzac
which caused such an uproar was
never cast in Rodin's own time.
However, a casting of it, as well as
of other studies, are on view at
the exhibition. All these fine
works have been made available
by the generous loan of the
Cantor, Fitzgerald Foundation.
The Balzac show and the
research behind it represent years
of scholarship on the part of Dr.
Albert Elsen of the Stanford Art
Department. He is one of the
foremost experts on Rodin.
Also instrumental in the
organization of the show were his
two assistants, graduate students
Steve McGough and Steven
Wander. They have written the
catalogue which will be published
this summer and will accompany
the Balzac exhibition as it tours
the country.
The Stanford Museum is open
Tues.-Fri. 10-5, Sat. and Sun. 1-5
and is closed Mondays.

A testament to two giants is
now on view at the Stanford
Museum. These two giants are the
French writer Honore de Balzac
and the French sculptor Auguste
Rodin. The show consists of
works from the nearly fifty
studies made by Rodin for a
monument to the deceased
Balzac.
They span a time period from
1891-98. When in 1898 Rodin
was finally pressured by his
commissioners, the Societe des
Gens des Lettres, to show his final
work, the result of years of
search, experiment, and change, it
created a national scandal of
incredible magnitude and has

become a landmark of modern
sculpture.
To Rodin, Balzac represented
an extremely fascinating figure.
There are many interesting
similarities between the two men.
Both were the recognized masters
in their own art during their own

time. Both had a phenomenal
drive in their work and were
relentless in pursuing excellence.
Moreover, both lived their lives
with the utmost gusto.
Many Sources
As can be seen in the show,
Rodin drew from many sources in
his studies for Balzac: old
photographs, various living models
who resembled him in one way or

another, and newspaper
caricatures. Especially interesting
is this use of caricatures and then
his own exaggerations in an
attempt to arrive at what was the
essence of Balzac, an essence that
transcends the purely visual.
In making a monument to a

great man, Rodin was acting
completely within the role of a
19th century sculptor. However,
this concern with the 'essential'
places him far ahead of his time.
Twentieth century modern
sculpture that focuses upon the
'essential' and the 'minimal,' is
rooted in part in Rodin's Balzac.
More than just a portrait of
Balzac, the exhibition is a

portrait of Rodin, the evolution
of his ideas, his thought process."
Along with the sculptures is a
photo-essay tracing Rodin's
different concepts throughout the
years and further showing how
Rodin's final project came about.
Casting Viewed
Sadly, the final work of Balzac
which caused such an uproar was
never cast in Rodin's own time.
However, a casting of it, as well as
of other studies, are on view at
the exhibition. All these fine
works have been made available
by the generous loan of the
Cantor, Fitzgerald Foundation.
The Balzac show and the
research behind it represent years
of scholarship on the part of Dr.
Albert Elsen of the Stanford Art
Department. He is one of the
foremost experts on Rodin.
Also instrumental in the
organization of the show were his
two assistants, graduate students
Steve McGough and Steven
Wander. They have written the
catalogue which will be published
this summer and will accompany
the Balzac exhibition as it tours
the country.
