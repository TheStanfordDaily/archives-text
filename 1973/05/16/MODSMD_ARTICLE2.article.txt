# Dean Sought CIA Help To Cover Up Break-In

From The Associated Press
WASHINGTON — Ten days after the
Watergate break-in, John W. Dean 111
asked the CIA in vain to pay bail or
salaries of the men arrested inside
Democratic Party headquarters, it was
disclosed yesterday.
The disclosure, by the number two
man in the CIA, makes it "very clear
to me that there was an attempt to
unload major responsibility for the
Watergate bugging and coverup on the
CIA," said Sen. Stuart Symington
(D-Mo.).
Symington released a summary of
some of the testimony given Monday
behind closed doors by Army Lt. Gen.
Vernon A. Walters, the deputy CIA
director.
'No Way'
It quotes Walters: "He told Mr.
Dean that there was no way this could

be done . . . Gen. Walters stated that
he told Mr. Dean that to spend funds
in this way would implicate the agency
and that he, Gen. Walters, was
prepared to resign rather than to do
this."
Former Acting FBI Director L.
Patrick Gray 111 told Senate
investigators the FBI never found links
between the Watergate wiretapping
and the, White House, an official
summary of Gray's remarks showed
yesterday.
Gray said a CIA official had him to
postpone FBI interviews with two
Watergate witnesses, and that this
caused much confusion.
But he said that when he told
President Nixon about this in a
telephone conversation last July 6 he
blamed it on "either carelessness or
indifference" by White House aides.
Caution
Although he cautioned Nixon that
it "could wound the President," he
didn't deduce that top White House
aides had attempted to enlist the ClA's
aid to coverup the scandal.
Gray said Walters told him
personally last June 23, six days after
the Watergate raid, that the CIA had
some interest in two witnesses,
Mexican lawyer Manuel Ogarrio
Daguerre and Minneapolis attorney
Kenneth H. Dahlberg.
These two men furnished a
financial link between the wiretapping
and the Nixon campaign.
Their names appeared on checks
that were given to the Nixon campaign
as contributions, and which ended in
the Miami bank account of Bernard L.
Barker, one of five men caught
burglarizing Democratic offices.
Gray said Walters' attempt to
postpone the interviews caused
confusion because Walters' boss then,
CIA Director Richard Helms, had told
him earlier there was no CIA
involvement in the Watergate case.
When Gray tried to get together
with Helms and Walters to straighten
the matter out, he said, then White

House aide John D. Ehrlichman
called Gray and ordered him to cancel
the meeting. This was June 28.
Some Discussion
Gray said there was "some
discussion as to who was to run the
investigation," and that "Ehrlichman
conceded that Gray was running it,
but the meeting was cancelled
anyway."
At the White House, press secretary
Ronald L. Ziegler said President Nixon
had asked for an investigation of
possible White House involvement last
August "and was satisfied with what
he was told."
But asked who had given Nixon the
information, Ziegler replied: "I cannot
get into that." He added it got to the
President "in various ways."
Last Aug. 29, in a news conference,
Nixon said Dean — the presidential
lawyer who was fired last month —
had "conducted a complete
investigation of all leads which might
involve any present members of the
White House staff or anybody in the
government."
'No One'
Nixon said then "no one in this
administration presently employed
was involved in this very bizarre
incident."
Dean said he never wrote such a
report. "On a couple of occasions
when I was asked to write some fairy
tales, I drafted one which showed I
thought they were fairy tales and just
had other people speaking for
themselves," he told Mary McGrory of
the Washington Star-News in an
interview yesterday.
Dean spent three hours at the
federal courthouse yesterday giving a
pre-trial statement in the civil suit
seeking disclosure of Nixon campaign
fund raising before last year's April 7
reporting deadline.
Dean also is being investigated by
the grand jury and will have to testify
before the Senate Watergate
committee, which starts its public
hearings tomorrow.
