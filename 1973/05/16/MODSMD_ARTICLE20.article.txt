# Stanford Seeded Behind USC
## Pac-8 Tennis Tourney Opens Tomorrow 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Stanford faces an uphill climb
in its bid for the 1973 Pacific
Eight tennis championship
tomorrow through Saturday at
USC.
The Cardinals were seeded
second in the tournament, despite
being ranked as the nation's best
tennis team. This seeding means
Stanford will have to beat both
USC and UCLA in order to win
the league title for a second
straight season.
The reason for the seeding is
that Stanford finished only 4-2 in
Pac-8 Southern Division play,
while USC finished at 5-1.

Although the Cardinals split
with the Trojans in the team's two
Pac-8 meetings, USC's record is
better because it beat UCLA
twice, while the Cards could
manage only a 1-1 split with the
Bruins.
The Pac-8 title is decided by
team vs. team pairings. The four
Pac-8 southern division schools
are all ranked ahead of the four
northern division schools. In the
tournament's first round, the No.
1 ranked team, USC, will play the
league's eight-ranked team,
Washington State.
Meet Oregon First
Stanford's first opponent will

be Oregon in a 9 a.m. Thursday
meeting. The match, Coach Dick
Gould explains, shouldn't be too
tough, as "none of the Northern
schools have much of a chance."
In other Thursday matches,
third-ranked UCLA plays
Washington, while fourth-ranked
California plays Oregon State in
what undoubtably will be the
only match of the day where the
northern school has a ghost of a
chance.
USC's advantage for gaining
the first seed will become
apparent on Friday. The Trojans
will face the Cal-Oregon State
winner at 9 am., while Stanford

will square off against UCLA at 1
p.m.
UCLA, according to Gould, "Is
the third-best team in the
country, a lot better than SMU."
Southern Methodist, in Texas, was
ranked third in a recent Atlanta
Journal poll which put Stanford
first and USC second. "I think the
poll is right about that," Gould
said.
UCLA Tough
Stanford will be hard-pressed
to get by UCLA, which is led by
Jeff Austin and Bob Kreiss and
includes the Ojai-winning doubles
team of Steve Krulevitz and
Rayno Seegers.
Should the Cardinals win this
match, they will undoubtably
play against USC at 1 p.m.
Saturday for the Pac-8 title.
USC will be led by Raul
Ramirez, back with the team after
a leave-of-absence so he could
play on Mexico's Davis Cup team.
Ramirez has a two-match win
streak going against Stanford's
Sandy Mayer, who would be his
first singles opponent. However,
Mayer's tennis has improved
tremendously since April, when
those matches were played.
Backing up Ramirez on the
Trojan side will be John Andrews,
who finished second in the Ojai
competition behind Ramirez.
Same Card Lineup
Stanford's lineup will be the
same one that beat USC and
UCLA here in April: Singles
players Mayer, Jim Delaney, Rick
Fisher, Pat DuPre, Chip Fisher
and John Whitlinger, and doubles
teams Mayer-Delaney, Rick
Fisher-Gery Groslimond, and
Whitlinger-DuPre.
USC will naturally have an
advantage in this prospective
match, as it will be held at the
Trojans' new David Marks tennis
stadium on campus, where USC
has never lost.
The Trojans' fans are quite
vociferous in their support of
their team, as Stanford found out
in its first trip to the new edifice.

This tournament can be
compared in format to the
National Indoor Tourney held in
Madison in February. In that dual
match event, consisting, like this
one, of six singles and three
doubles matches, Stanford beat
both USC and UCLA 6-3 to win
the title.
Gould called the Madison
tourney "round one" in the
five-round battle for national
supremacy between USC, UCLA,
and Stanford.
Round two, the series of dual
matches between the three
schools, was won by USC with a
3-1 record. Stanford came back to
win round three, the Ojai
Intercollegiate tournament, by a
16-14 margin over the Trojans.
Thus the Pac-8 tourney
becomes round four in the series.
Actually, though, from Stanford's
point of view, the only round that
really matters is the fifth and final
one — the NCAA outdoor
championships to be held in
Princeton, New Jersey, June
18-23.

ANOTHER BIG BATTLE- UCLA's Bob Kreiss (left), Stanford's Sandy Mayer (middle), and USC's Raul Ramirez will meet once again at the Pacific Eight tennis championships
this weekend in Los Angeles. The three teams are battling in "round four ' of the five-round struggle to find out who is the nation's best tennis team. When the three schools
met here in April, Mayer beat Kreiss but lost to Ramirez. Both were tough three-set matches. This weekend Stanford will probably play UCLA Friday, and, if it wins that
match, will undoubtably face USC for the league crown Saturday.
