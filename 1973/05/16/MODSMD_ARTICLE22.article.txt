# Volleyballers Host Wilt's Big Dippers
## 
### PETE BHATIA 
Wilt Chamberlain's Big
Dippers, a world reknowned
exhibition volleyball team, makes
its first appearance in the Bay
Area this weekend, meeting
Stanford's volleyball team in a
7:30 p.m. game Friday night at
Maples Pavilion.
The Big Dippers team is
composed of several of the
world's best volleyball players,
including founder Gene Selznick,
"Mr. USA Volleyball." Selznick
began the Dippers five years ago
after a South American women's
volleyball team had been killed in
an airplane crash.
To raise funds to help those
who lost relatives in the crash,
Selznick enlisted Chamberlain,
whom he heard had taken up
volleyball to strengthen a
damaged knee. Chamberlain
agreed to play and today the
Dippers have evolved into a
promotional gimmick for all of
volleyball.
They don't play for serious
awards â€” just for fun. All the
money raised by their appearances
goes to the United States
Volleyball Association.
The team's featured attraction
is of course, Chamberlain, one of
the most imposing figures ever to
set foot on a basketball court.
And with his seven-foot stature,
he is indeed an impressive hitter
on the volleyball court.
Nation's Best
Selznick is the only American
ever to be named to the All-World
team . He has been playing
volleyball since it began in the
United States and is still
considered the best in the nation
although he's now in his forties.
Larry Rundell was named
Most Valuable Player at the
United States Nationals for three
straight years (1968-1970). Butch
May, who played on Santa Monica
College's NCAA champions last
year, is regarded as one of the
premier defensive players in the
country.
These four men, who (with the
obvious exception of
Chamberlain) are very small in
stature, play against standard
six-man teams and are very rarely
beaten. They run a quick passing
and hitting offense, making great
use of short sets and the reach of
Chamberlain. They use the
"power system" of volleyball,
which is the same style used in the
Olympics. Power volleyball is a
different type of volleyball than
most people at Stanford have ever
seen. It is a far cry from the
hit-and-throw volleyball that is
played at most grade schools.
Two former UCLA basketball
players and fine volleyball players
in their own right, back up the
starting four for the Dippers.

Keith Erickson, now of the Los
Angeles Lakers, was regarded as a
top volleyball prospect for the
future before he turned to pro
basketball. John Vallely, now of
the Atlanta Hawks is one of the
best sand volleyball players in the
world.
The Dippers will play a
Stanford team that was runnerup
in last year's United States
Collegiate Division tournament.
The Cards return four players
from that great team for Friday's
game, but it is under rather
unusual circumstances. Due to
lack of funding and volleyball's
club sport status at Stanford, the
top three returnees from last years
team are currently playing for an
open team out of the San Jose
YMCA. There, funding is
adequate and the coaching is
good.
Those three players, who are
all Stanford undergraduates, will
return to the Card team to play
against the Dippers.
Jim lams last year earned
honorable mention honors at the
national tournament. He has
coached the Stanford team this
year while playing in the open
division and he could well be
regarded as the top collegiate
player in the country.
Steve Hoch, whose two
strongest assets are his strong
hitting and pinpoint passing, and
Steve Leroy, who is probably
Stanford's best setter and
all-around player, are the other
two players who will rejoin the
Card Squad.
Mannon Also Returns
They will be joined in the
starting lineup by the only
returnee from last year's team
who chose to stick it out at
Stanford this year, Willie Mannon.
Mannon (6-6) is a strong hitter
and has been Stanford's captain
and team leader this season.
Other starters include George
McPheeters, a good setter, and
Greg Amundsen, a Vietnam
veteran who played a great deal of
volleyball while in the service.
Subs for the Cards include
John Mueller, Bill Rix, and Andy
Wenska.
Mannon promised a few
surprises for the Dippers,
including a possible towering
blocking wall of Cardinal
basketball players Rich Kelley
(7-0), Tim Patterson (6-11), and
Mike Mann (6-9). Kelley is
currently nursing a sore ankle and
despite this temporary ploy, it
seems pretty doubtful that the
three cagers can contain the
Dippers.
Advance tickets are now on
sale at the Athletic Department
for the Friday night match. They
are $1 for students and $2 for
adults.
