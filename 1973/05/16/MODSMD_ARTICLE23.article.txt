# More Weekend Results
## 
### 
Space limitations in Monday's issue forced the
omission of several weekend stories. Here is a brief
summary:
Track
Stanford's distance medley relay team of John
Anderson, Vernell Jackson, Les McFadden, and
Brian Mittelstaedt finished second at the West Coast
Relays in Fresno. The Cardinal quartet was timed in
9:57.1.
Other Stanford highlights in the meet included
Terry Albritton's fifth place shot put of 59-7, and
Ken Curl's 9.6 clocking in the 100 yard dash, good
for sixth place.
The Fresno competition featured top athletes
from all over the western half of the country.
Lacrosse
The Lacrosse team evened its final record at 7-7
with a win and a loss in the Northern California
Lacrosse Association playoffs Saturday and Sunday
on the Stanford rugby field.
In a game in which coach Peter Schneider played
all of the players on his roster, the Cardinals edged

Oakland Lacrosse Club 9-7 Saturday.
Sunday a relaxed Stanford team lost to
California 9-7 as Schneider again allowed everyone
on the team to play. The loss placed the Cards fifth
in the eight-team league, behind four teams which
will complete the tournament this weekend at
Golden Gate Park.
Brown Named Commissioner
Andrew Brown, 29, currently administrative
assistant to Stanford Athletic Director Joseph
Ruetz, was named as the first commissioner of the
Southwestern Athletic Conference.
The appointment of Brown was announced
Saturday at the conference headquarters in Jackson,
Miss. It is effective July 1.
Brown, who received a master's degree in
administration and supervision at Southern
University in 1966, will head a conference which
includes Southern, Alcorn A&M, Grambling,
