# Card Rally Falls Short At Pac-8 Golf Tourney
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Stanford made an incredible
final round charge at the Pacific
Eight golf tournament yesterday
at Clarkston, Wash., but the
Cardinal rally fell short and USC
won its third conference title in a
row.
Stanford's top four golfers
played the final 18 holes in 11
under par to pick up 25 shots on
third round leader Oregon State.
Meanwhile, though, USC also
played magnificent golf, scoring
five under par as a team to edge
the Cards by nine shots.
USC's winning total was 1124,
Stanford was second at 1133, and
Oregon State third at 1134.
California, Oregon, Washington
State, UCLA, and Washington
followed, all far off the pace.
Stanford's amazing final round
charge included a six under par 64
by Dave Baskins, Conrad
Nilmeier's 65, and even par 70's
for Aly Trompas and John Beers.
"It was a great effort," said

Stanford coach Bud Finger,
speaking with uncharacteristic
enthusiasm for a veteran golf
coach. "USC was scared stiff. If
we had another 36 holes
tomorrow we'd beat the hell out
of 'em."
After Monday morning's
opening 18 holes of the 72 hole
ordeal, Stanford was dead last in
the eight-team field. After 36
holes the Cards were fourth, and
after 54 holes Stanford trailed
Oregon State by 24 shots and
USC by 20.
Yesterday afternoon's final
round charge wasn't enough to
catch USC, but it was certainly
enough to establish Stanford as a
legitimate contender for next
month's NCAA tournament,
especially because of the brilliant
individual rounds recorded by
Nilmeier and Baskins.
"Dave proved an awful lot to
himself today," Finger said after
his normally consistent but not
sensational sophomore had carded
his 64. "He's got to realize that
he's got the talent and can go
anywhere with it."
"It was easily the best
competitive round I've had," said
an elated Baskins. "I've never
been so pumped up in my life."
Baskins, whose earlier rounds
were 74-74-70, finished eight
strokes behind individual
champion Mark Pfeil of USC, who
fired rounds of 70-69-68-67 for a
274 total. Cal's Don Compton and

Oregon State's Scott Massingill
tied for second at 276, defending
champion Craig Griswold of
Oregon finished fourth, USC's
Craig Stadler was fifth, OSU's
Dave Molitor sixth, and Nilmeier
tied Baskins for seventh on rounds
of 76-69-72-65.
Stanford's other scores were:
Trompas (73-70-71-70, 284),
Beers (75-68-72-70, 285), Denny
Colvin (74-72-71-71, 288), and
George Pettinger (79-71-80-72,
302).

THE BAND WARMS UP—The incomparable Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band performed in civilian clothes Saturday at
the annual Red-White scrimmage. Band manager Doug Peterson was
apparently pleased with the performance, adding that "spring games
aren't really that consequential." The LSJUMB will be going for a
second straight undefeated season when the band opens against Penn
State on Sept. 15 at Stanford Stadium. The following week the
LSJUMB will travel to Ann Arbor to compete against a Michigan band
Stanford soundly defeated at the 1972 Rose Bowl.
