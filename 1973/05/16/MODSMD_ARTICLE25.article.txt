# Shuffling The Cards
## Wines Assesses 'Last Spring' 
### Dave Robinson 
John Winesberry has never really enjoyed spring
football, but after enduring his third and last spring
ordeal, the All-American candidate expressed
renewed optimism for the upcoming 1973 season.
"There's not a lot of motivation for spring
football," Winesberry admitted, "especially after
you've gone through it two years. But coming out
of Saturday's game I was a lot more optimistic
about next year than when we started practice."
Winesberry, one of three remaining Cardinals
who started in the 1972 Rose Bowl (the others are
Randy Poltl and James Ferguson), should be in as
good a position as anyone to evaluate Stanford's
1973 chances.
"I think we'll have a lot more motivation and
desire because of what happened last year,"
Winesberry said, referring to the Cards'
disappointing 6-5 record. "It was a long season
because we lost and no one wants to repeat it."
Stanford will be playing perhaps its toughest
schedule ever next fall, and Winesberry feels the
first month of the season wil be pivotal. The Cards
open against Penn State at Stanford Stadium on
Sept. 15 before facing Michigan. San Jose State, and
Illinois.
Tested Early
"We have a lot of young ballplayers who will be
tested right away," Winesberry said. "That first
month will probably tell us what kind of a season
we'll have."
Winesberry maintains that "we may come out of
it unbeaten," but says that even a 2-2 record would
put Stanford in good shape going into the
conference opener against UCLA on October 13.
Head coach Jack Christiansen is still uncertain as
to what position Winesberry will play this fall, but
the versatile senior will obviously be Stanford's
most explosive offensive weapon either at running
back or at flanker. Asa sophomore flanker in 1971,
he caught 37 passes for 543 yards and last year as a
running back he led the Card rushers with 536 yards

on 125 carries.
He played running back during spring drills, but
after the offense sputtered during Saturday's
Red-White game, Christiansen indicated that
Winesberry might be moved back to flanker, with
Sig Ostrom and Scott Laidlaw handling the running
chores.
Probably Play Both
"As of yet they [the coaches | haven't decided,"
Winesberry said," but I'll probably see some time at
both positions," adding that he has no real
preference.
"Flanker would probably be my position as a
pro, but I'd still like to have a good year as a
running back for my own satisfaction."
After an impressive list of accomplishments
during his first two years at Stanford (including his
eight catches against Michigan in the Rose Bowl and
a 135 yard, three touchdown performance last year
against West Virginia), the 9-7 sprinter from Tulsa,
Oklahoma has some lofty personal goals for the
1973 season.
"I have some personal goals but I don't usually
reveal them because they're so high," he said. "My
number one objective, though, is to win. I'm a bad
loser — I hate to lose. To be All-American on a team
with a 6-5 record is nothing like playing on a 9-2, or
10-1, or 11-9 team.
And Winesberry insists that Stanford has a
chance to be a winner in 1973. "In the past
Stanford depended on guys like Jim Plunkett, Jeff
Siemon, Pete Lazetich, Charles McCloud, Benny
Barnes, or Jackie Brown to make a key play, but
this year our success will be dependent on team
unity," Winesberry said. "I think everybody realizes
that instead of depending on somebody else, we'll
have to depend on ourselves." *
Well, that's almost correct, but when the 1973
Stanford Cardinals take the field against teams like
Penn State, Michigan, and USC, they'll be
depending pretty heavily on John Winesberry.

Randy Poltl and James Ferguson), should be in as
good a position as anyone to evaluate Stanford's
1973 chances.
"I think we'll have a lot more motivation and
desire because of what happened last year,"
Winesberry said, referring to the Cards'
disappointing 6-5 record. "It was a long season
because we lost and no one wants to repeat it."
Stanford will be playing perhaps its toughest
schedule ever next fall, and Winesberry feels the
first month of the season wil be pivotal. The Cards
open against Penn State at Stanford Stadium on
Sept. 15 before facing Michigan. San Jose State, and
Illinois.
Tested Early
"We have a lot of young ballplayers who will be
tested right away," Winesberry said. "That first
month will probably tell us what kind of a season
we'll have."
Winesberry maintains that "we may come out of
it unbeaten," but says that even a 2-2 record would
put Stanford in good shape going into the
conference opener against UCLA on October 13.
Head coach Jack Christiansen is still uncertain as
to what position Winesberry will play this fall, but
the versatile senior will obviously be Stanford's
most explosive offensive weapon either at running
back or at flanker. Asa sophomore flanker in 1971,
he caught 37 passes for 543 yards and last year as a
running back he led the Card rushers with 536 yards

on 125 carries.
He played running back during spring drills, but
after the offense sputtered during Saturday's
Red-White game, Christiansen indicated that
Winesberry might be moved back to flanker, with
Sig Ostrom and Scott Laidlaw handling the running
chores.
Probably Play Both
"As of yet they [the coaches | haven't decided,"
Winesberry said," but I'll probably see some time at
both positions," adding that he has no real
preference.
"Flanker would probably be my position as a
pro, but I'd still like to have a good year as a
running back for my own satisfaction."
After an impressive list of accomplishments
during his first two years at Stanford (including his
eight catches against Michigan in the Rose Bowl and
a 135 yard, three touchdown performance last year
against West Virginia), the 9-7 sprinter from Tulsa,
Oklahoma has some lofty personal goals for the
1973 season.
"I have some personal goals but I don't usually
reveal them because they're so high," he said. "My
number one objective, though, is to win. I'm a bad
loser — I hate to lose. To be All-American on a team
with a 6-5 record is nothing like playing on a 9-2, or
10-1, or 11-9 team.
And Winesberry insists that Stanford has a
chance to be a winner in 1973. "In the past
Stanford depended on guys like Jim Plunkett, Jeff
Siemon, Pete Lazetich, Charles McCloud, Benny
Barnes, or Jackie Brown to make a key play, but
this year our success will be dependent on team
unity," Winesberry said. "I think everybody realizes
that instead of depending on somebody else, we'll
have to depend on ourselves." *
Well, that's almost correct, but when the 1973
Stanford Cardinals take the field against teams like
Penn State, Michigan, and USC, they'll be
depending pretty heavily on John Winesberry.
John Winesberry has never really enjoyed spring
football, but after enduring his third and last spring
ordeal, the All-American candidate expressed
renewed optimism for the upcoming 1973 season.
"There's not a lot of motivation for spring
football," Winesberry admitted, "especially after
you've gone through it two years. But coming out
of Saturday's game I was a lot more optimistic
about next year than when we started practice."

who started in the 1972 Rose Bowl (the others are
Randy Poltl and James Ferguson), should be in as
