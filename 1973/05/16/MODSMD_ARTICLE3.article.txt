# Seale Loses Oakland Election
## Reading Wins Mayoral Post 
### ROBERT BACON 
Conservative Republican John
Reading was re-elected Mayor of
Oakland yesterday, trouncing Black
Panther Party Chairman Bobby Seale.
With 64 percent of the ballots
counted, Reading had 53,886 votes
(68 percent) and Seale had 24,985 (32
percent).
The result was expected. In the
April 17 non-partisan primary,
Reading fell only a handful of votes
short of gaining a majority of the
ballots and thereby winning a third
term without a runoff. Seale polled 19
percent of the vote in the primary.
Between 60 and 65 percent of the
city's voters went to the polls
yesterday. The turnout was
disproportionately high in white areas
and low in the minority areas where
Seale was expected to run strongest.
The same was true in the primary,
when Seale and two other liberal
candidates split the half of the votes
that did not go to Reading.
Economic Objectives
Reading said last night that his
victory showed Oakland voters favored
"strong economic objectives as
opposed to an emphasis on social
programs."
Seale, refusing to concede defeat at
10 p.m., said that "whether we win or
lose, something has happened in this
town that has never happened before
in the history of this country. I feel I'll
make a good showing in relation to the
past apathy of this community."
A poll taken last week showed
Seale trailing heavily.
When the first returns came in last
night, Reading had over 90 percent of
the vote. His percentage fell as more
precincts reported, but his landslide
victory was never in doubt.
Non-Partisan
Reading, 55, a balding meat
packing executive, has held the
part-time, nonpartisan mayor's job
since 1966, the year Seale and Huey

Newton cofounded the Panther party.
Effective April 17 the mayor's annual
salary went from $7500 to $15,000.
Seale had admitted the odds were
long that he could win, but he said it
was possible.
He contended there were 40,000
registered voters in the poor, black and
Spanish-surnamed neighborhoods who
hadn't bothered to vote in the primary
"because they didn't think I had a
chance."
He said he and his people had to
convince these people to vote — and
vote for him.
Low-Key
The mayor conducted a low-key
campaign, telling voters if they liked
what was happening in Oakland during
his two terms they should return him
to office.
He referred to Seale as a "fine,

young American," praised Seale's
legion of enthusiastic, young black
volunteers and told voters Seale ran a
gentleman's campaign.
One-Third Black
Population in Oakland — fifth
largest city in the state — is about one
third black and 20 percent
Spanish-sumamed. The affluent, white
population is concentrated in the
surrounding, tree-shaded hill
communities.
Seale, 36, conducted a hard-driving
campaign, shaking hands and making
speeches for most of a year before
Tuesday's runoff.
He and Panther Elaine Brown, who
lost her bid for a city council seat in
April, had boarded commuter buses
crossing Oakland on workday
mornings, making short "commute
speeches."
