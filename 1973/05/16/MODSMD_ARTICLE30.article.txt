Skylab Repair Mission Proposed
CAPE KENNEDY, Fla. — Space officials said
yesterday they may send astronauts into space to rig
a shield to shade the troubled Skylab space station
where temperatures soared to a desert-like 120
degrees.
Officials said an initial long-term manned mission
to the $294 million orbiting laboratory, already
crippled by a serious power shortage, is unlikely
because of the high temperatures.
The space agency said temperatures had reached
100 degrees in the craft. But by 6:30 p.m. PDT,
flight controller Don Puddy said the temperatures
had risen to 120 in the orbiting space cabin, the
nation's first such vehicle.
Instead of the 28-day mission that had been
planned for Skylab 1 astronauts Charles Conrad,
Joseph Kerwin and Paul Weitz, engineers are now
studying ways that the astronauts could install some
device on the space station to salvage something
from the new $2.6 billion American space project.
Puddy said one proposal was to have the
astronauts, during a space walk, install a balloon
which would shade the side of the spacecraft facing
the sun.
"If we could cover 30 to 40 percent of the
spacecraft, it would solve the problem," said Puddy.
He said this would involve either a large balloon or a
thermal insulation blanket 42 feet long and 12 feet
wide.
Earlier, a space agency source said engineers were
considering a short inspection mission by the Skylab
1 crew which would involve a fly-around of the
space station and picture taking, followed possibly
by a docking and brief on board inspection.
Another possibility, the source said, is for
astronauts to envelope the spaceship with a giant
sheet of Mylar, an insulating material. This would
block heat from the sun and allow the orbiting
station to cool off.
If the insulating sheet is used, the source said, it
more than likely would be installed by the Skylab 2
crew. The tedious operation would require extensive
training and there is time before the Skylab 2
launch in August for such training.
In this event, said the source, the Skylab 1 flight
of Conrad, Weitz and Kerwin would probably be
limited to an inspection trip lasting only a few days.
Other options are being studied and no decision
has been made, an official said.
Conrad, Kerwin and Weitz are tentatively
scheduled to be launched at 8:01 a.m. PDT Sunday
for an as yet undefined mission.
Problems developed aboard Skylab, the nation's
first space station and the largest spacecraft ever
launched, on Monday only minutes after the
118-foot craft was flawlessly launched from Cape
Kennedy.
Two of six sets of solar cell panels failed to open
properly, cutting the Skylab electrical power supply
by half. The solar panels convert sunlight to

electricity.
Skylab is orbiting the earth at 272 miles while
engineers seek solutions to the problems.
Magee Trial Moved To San Jose
SAN FRANCISCO — The retrial of San Quentin
convict Ruchell Magee on an aggravated kidnaping
charge in the 1970 killing of a Superior Court judge
was transferred to San Jose yesterday.
A Santa Clara County Superior Court aide said
the trial likely will be held in the same courtroom
where Magee's one-time codefendant, black militant
Angela Davis, was acquitted last June of kidnap,
murder and conspiracy charges in the same case.
A trial date for Magee will be set later.
San Francisco Superior Court Judge John Ertola
said he selected Santa Clara County from several
possibilities recommended by the state Judicial
Council after a change of venue was granted.
The first trial originally had been set for the
Marin County courthouse, site of the shootout
which claimed four lives. It was moved to San
Francisco after Magee's attorneys claimed he could
not get a fair trial in San Rafael.
That trial ended in a hung jury April 3.
Liddy Gave GOP Legal Pointers
WASHINGTON — At the same time he was helping
plan what would become the Watergate affair, G.
Gordon Liddy was warning Republican congressmen
not to break the new 1972 campaign reporting law.
Liddy was also advising the congressmen how
they could avoid that law and get away with it.
As it turned out, Liddy's advice on avoiding the
law was wrong.
A seminar on the new law was held Feb. 23,
1972, and was jointly sponsored by the Republican
Congressional Committee and the House Republican
Conference. Liddy was present as counsel to the
Committee to Re-elect the President.
Liddy, eventually convicted in the bugging and
burglary of the Democratic National Committee
headquarters, warned the GOP congressmen there
were criminal sanctions attached to the new
campaign reporting law and that the congressmen
had better be careful.
But Liddy also cited two ways congressmen
could get around the law, both involving the
collection and expenditure of funds before the law
took effect.
"He told us to go out and get all the money we
could before April 7," said one congressional aide
who attended the seminar.
"He said we wouldn't have to name contributors
and, even better, we could go out and buy television
and radio time with the money collected before
April 7 and it wouldn't count against the law's
limitations on media expenses."
Dollar Hits New Lows
LONDON — Gold hit record highs in Europe for the

second straight day yesterday and the U.S. dollar
touched new lows, but experts said another
international monetary crisis appeared unlikely.
Dealers here and on the Continent reported that
by late in the day some of the steam had gone out
of the feverish trading in dollars and gold since the
weekend.
Gold nevertheless closed in London and Zurich,
the world's two largest bullion markets, at a record
$110.50 an ounce, up $8 for the day.
But $5 of that climb came in the first hour alone
and the markets appeared relatively steady later on.
The skyrocketing gold price and declining dollar
were chief factors cited in a sharp drop of prices on
New York stock exchanges. For the fourth straight
day stocks plummeted, but then recovered some of
the loss in later trading.
In Paris, gold soared to an all-time high of
$124.13 an ounce, up a phenomenal $17.93 on the
day. Bankers there said buyers were in the market
for gold "at any price."
The Paris gold market, however, is a special case,
because French government controls limit the
import and export of gold. The Paris gold price has
little effect on larger centers elsewhere.
Dealers reported a vicious circle on financial
markets earlier in the day. As gold rose, speculators
cashed in dollars and U.S. securities to buy more
gold and get on the bandwagon.
This pushed dollar exchange rates down and
encouraged more gold buying. The process
depressed the dollar to record lows in Paris and
Frankfurt.
Vietnamese Prisoners Freed
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia - A group of 121
Vietnamese residents of Cambodia flew home to
Saigon yesterday, free after spending from six
months to five years in Phnom Penh jails as political
prisoners.
About 40 were women and 50 were children.
Most of the Vietnamese had been arrested and
imprisoned following the March 1970 overthrow of
Prince Norodom Sihanouk, when anti-Vietnamese
passions ran strong and Cambodians feared invasion
by North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces.
They were accused of having aided or
collaborated with the enemy, they said, but none
had been tried on the charges.
Some had been arrested as recently as six months
ago, but one man said he had been jailed in 1968,
two years before the anti-Sihanouk coup.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow except occasional high
cloudiness and low clouds near the coast night and
mornings. Little temperature change. Low tonight
in the 50s. Highs today and tomorrow from the 60s
near the coast to the 70s inland. Westerly wind 5 to
15 mph.
