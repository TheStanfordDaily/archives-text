# Lyman Sees No Basis For Chicano Complaint
## 
### DAVID THIEMANN 
President Richard W. Lyman last
night said he "can't for the life of me
see any grounds, under statute or
administrative order," for complaints
to the federal government about law
school admissions policies.
The Chicano Law Students
Association (CLSA) announced Friday
that it had filed a complaint with the
Department of Health, Education, and
Welfare (HEW) challenging law school
admissions and hiring practices toward
chicanos.
Lyman said he does not know
"exactly what the substance of the
complaint is," even after reading
reports and correspondence about the
dispute and meeting with two CLSA
leaders.
"It's a little hard to see what HEW
can do. I'm not sure there's likely to
be intervention," he commented.
Statutes empower HEW to conduct
field investigations and under some
circumstances withhold federal funds,
but a lack of manpower has hampered
agency enforcement efforts.
Lyman maintained that attempts to
selectively admit the most
disadvantaged minority applicants,
advocated by some CLSA spokesmen,

are "not fruitful, and sometimes
counterproductive," creating
"bitterness and conflict within ethnic
groups, and an unfair distribution
within the professions."
The University will search for and
recruit the ablest available minority
applicants, but will not attempt to
choose students who will later work in
chicano communities or aid chicano
causes, he said.
Commenting on another
controversy, Lyman said the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies
"did the right thing" when it refused
to mediate a dispute between the
SCIRE Policy Board and James Gibbs,
Deaii of Undergraduate Studies.
Lyman said there is no "serious
structural problem" afflicting SCIRE
if Gibbs and the board will "drop their
extreme charges" and "sit down and
talk together."
SCIRE and SWOPSI exercise
"desirable flexibility and freedom,"
Lyman opined, but lack systematic,
critical evaluation.
He criticized the current Board and
director, Ron Jones, for giving "all of
the emphasis to innovation and the
so-called catalytic function and no
emphasis to academic activities."
