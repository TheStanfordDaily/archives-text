# Muslim May Speak
## 
### 
A decision will apparently be
reached today on whether Black
Muslim minister John Muhammad will
speak on campus this week.
Memorial Church appears to be out
as a possible site for the talk after a
fruitless meeting yesterday between
representatives of the Black Students
Union and Dean of the Chapel Robert
G. H. Kelly.
Kelly had said he would not let
Muhammad use Mem Chu until he had
a chance to discuss "what I
understood to be a 'racist' element" in
Muslim theology with Muhammad.
BSU Chairman Charles Ogletree has
reserved the use of Memorial
Auditorium for Muhammad's talk,
scheduled for Thursday. However, he
expressed doubt yesterday whether
Muhammad would still want to speak,

citing the publicity Kelly's stand has
received.
It would be "impractical" for
Muhammad to discuss the theological
questions with Kelly, said Ogletree,
and "other people don't speak for the
minister; the minister speaks for
himself."
Ogletree said Psychology Prof.
Cedric X would consult with the San
Francisco Black Muslim headquarters
today to see whether Muhammad
would still want to speak here.
Ogletree said there may be
"physical security problems" now if
Muhammad speaks on campus, since
he has "publicly been labeled a racist"
by Kelly.
X told the University News Service
yesterday that he felt sure Muhammad
"will appear on campus sometime."
