From The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - The Senate
Appropriations Committee voted 24
to 0 yesterday to cut off all funds for
bombing in Cambodia or Laos.
The committee adopted an
amendment to a supplemental
appropriation bill, proposed by Sen.
Thomas F. Eagleton (D-Mo.), to apply
the spending ban for combat activities
to all money previously appropriated.
The House voted last week to apply
the restriction only to money in the
supplemental bill itself and only
against its use for bombing in
Cambodia.
Eagleton told newsmen that his
amendment will be subject to a point
of order in the Senate but he will
appeal from the ruling of the chair and
seek to override the objection by a
majority vote.
Subcommittee
The funding ban was approved

Monday by the appropriations defense
subcommittee.
Eagleton said the over-all ban on
use of any money was prompted by
the statement of Secretary of Defense
Elliot L. Richardson that other funds
could be found to continue the
Cambodian bombing if the prohibition
applied only to the supplemental
money bill.
Sen. Edward W. Brooke (R-Mass.),
said that his amendment to add a ban
on combat activity in Laos to the
House-passed language applying to
Cambodia only also was adopted in
the committee by a unanimous roll
call vote.
The bill is expected to reach the
Senate floor for action possibly late
this week or next Monday.
The Foreign Relations Committee
earlier adopted a fund cutoff for any
hostile action in Cambodia, Laos and
Vietnam, or for U.S. aid to North

Vietnam, without specific approval of
Congress.
The broader Indochina hostility
ban, designed to recapture the
constitutional authority of Congress to
declare war. was introduced by Sens.
Clifford P. Case (R-N.J.), and Frank
Church (D-Idaho), as an amendment
to a $570 million State Department
authorization bill.
The Case-Church amendment had
40 Senate co-sponsors.
Transfer Authority
The appropriations committee
action related to a Defense
Department request for authority to
transfer up to $500 million between
accounts to make up specific deficits,
including $25 million for continued air
operations in Cambodia until June 30.
The House rejected the transfer
authority on the basis of arguments
that it might be interpreted as
Congressional sanction for the

bombing.
The Senate subcommittee voted to
allow transfers up to $170 million,
including $110 million to make up for
the effects of dollar devaluation and
$60 million for increases in food and
subsistence costs.
Cambodia Or Laos
But a ban on use of any money in
the transfer for bombing in Cambodia
or Laos was added as a cor dition.
Senate Majority L.;ader Mike
Mansfield (D-Mont.), said Senate
action might be scheduled for
tomorrow or Friday.
Sen. John L. McClellan (D-Ark.),
chairman of both the aporopriations
committee and its defense
subcommittee, said he supported the
subcommittee action. He said the
continued bombing risks further U.S.
military involvement in Indochina and
the capture of additional American
prisoners.

SPEED ON CAMPUS — Recently, this flock of 10-speed creatures was seen
migrating across the Stanford campus. They are similar to human beings except
for the fact that large metal bike frames are attached to their limbs. They seem
to thrive on sunshine, fast speeds, and spring breezes. Jonathan Livingston
Ten-Speed, leader of the flock, assumed his reign after an exceptional year as a
Five-Speed Lieutenant, when he accumulated 29 pedestrian knockdowns in
White Plaza and 15 tickets for running Bike STOP signs.
