# How Do You Win Labor Elections?
## USE Maps Campaign Strategy For June 6 Election 
### GLENN GARVIN News Analysis 
When the Stanford Joint Council announced last
week it was pulling out of the June 6 National
Labor Relations Board election, United Stanford
Employee executives must have breathed a sigh of
relief.
USE was running against the Joint Council for
the election's big prize — the right to bargain
collectively for 1600 Stanford blue-collar workers.
USE officers deny that they were the least bit
scared by the Joint Council — which is quite likely
true. The Joint Council's campaign, while loud, was
rather ineffective; the organization simply didn't
know the campus or how to go about organizing it.
Misleading
But the mere presence of the Council diverted a
lot of USE time and money. Every time Employees
Organize, the USE newspaper, made an appearance,
a substantial portion was devoted to debunking
misleading (and sometimes outright false) claims by
the Joint Council.
Even University administrators, who usually have
to be strongly persuaded to say anything about
labor unions, noted the distortions in Joint Council
campaign material. "I feel there were misstatements
in the Joint Council literature," said Doug Barton,
University staff counsel.
"It was full of a number of inaccuracies."
The Joint Council's withdrawal also means that
USE executives will not have to spend any more

time swapping charges and countercharges through
the press and leaflets. They can get on to what most
union people consider "the real enemy" — the
University.
Not Easy
That doesn't figure to be easy. Many Stanford
employees like their jobs and figure that while they
aren't perfect, a union is more likely to cause
problems than do any good.
Some of them still fear USE from the old days
when the union kept a higher political profile that
many workers thought was too radical. Many
employees just fear change, period. There are others
who want a union but believe USE is too weak to
handle the job.
USE has done its best to keep radical politics
from becoming an issue in this election, as it was
last year. The NLRB election last spring showed
how deadly a radical taint can be; both of USE's
competitors used it against the group, knocking it
out in the primary.
Then, as the Teamsters became increasingly
involved with the Maoist Venceremos organization,
they became the target of anti-radical sentiment.
No Politics
By and large, USE has avoided even the
appearance of political involvement for the last 10
months. Whether workers have forgotten the old
reputation is something that no one can really
know.
USE has made overtures to the "strong union"

segment of the workers by affiliating with the
Service Employees International Union, an
AFL-CIO group. Now no one can charge that USE is
a weak in-house group with no strength to back up
its demands.
The affiliation has been highly publicized, but
again, it's a question of how easily Stanford
employees can get rid of their old notions about
USE and adopt the new ones.
While the solutions to the questions of strength
and politicalization are relatively easy, what to do
about workers who fear labor unions or change in
general is not so obvious. The situation is
complicated by the fact that the same things USE
does to woo the "strong union" vote alienate those
who fear unions.
More Time
About the only tactic available to USE is to keep
publicizing what it can offer Stanford workers, what
they have to gain by USE's presence. Now that USE
no longer has to deal with the Joint Council, the
union's executives will undoubtedly put in more
time on this problem.
The University is unlikely to openly oppose USE
unless the union begins making blatantly false
promises to employees, as the Teamsters did last
year. So USE has no opposition: it must stand or
fall strictly on its own merits.
In the next three weeks, it will be frantically
trying to convice employees that it should stand.
