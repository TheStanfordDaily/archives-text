# Feminism's Goals And Tactics
## Don't Call Us Pigs 
### 
Ben C. Scheible

The women's liberation
movement appears to have run
into difficulties here at Stanford.
Changes, if any, are coming
slowly; a "battle of the sexes"
seems near.
In an attempt to find where
the problem is I examined the
goals of the movement and the
tactics and techniques used to
achieve those goals. In both cases
this was not an in-depth study;
merely an examination of how the
movement appears as it expresses
itself in day-to-day happenings
here on campus.
I am sorry to say that I was
unable to find the problem.
Goals
Taking goals first, I found
them not only honorable, but
indeed very reasonable. Women
want to be given equal
opportunities and be treated as
human beings, not objects. The
sexism and discrimination that
now flourish must end.
I am especially impressed to
find that many feel that by
allowing women equal educational
and social opportunities women
can in turn become a more useful
and positive force in our society,
that by developing the talents that
now so often lie dormant we can
make strides towards the
betterment of all humanity.
Taking tactics next I was still
unable to find the problem. They
seem to do everything right.
When a man opens a door for
them they glare at him and call

him a "male chauvinist pig,"
maybe adding an obscene word or
two if it was a big door. When a
"sexist" comment issues from a
movie screen, oinks and hisses are
soon heard.
The handling of the recent Phi
Delt situation was superb!
Recognizing that a woman cannot
be allowed the freedom to control
her own body, the women's
libbers leaped into action.
First they produced picket
signs with phrases thoughtfully
constructed to help insure that a
rational dialogue would develop;
for example, "Off Phi Delt Pigs."
The Phi Delts lost their
individuality and were quickly
stereotyped and de-humanized.
Finally, actions are now being
taken to seek retribution.
Change
So that I won't be charged
with doing the same thing that
this article criticizes I will clarify
my position and seek a "rational
dialogue."
The need for change in our
society is apparent to me. Women
are, in many cases, subjected to a
second class position. Great talent
is often either undeveloped, lost
or wasted. But I don't think a
battle is called for. On the
contrary, I think cooperation is
needed, with discussion and
education.
I often do "sexist" things
without knowing it or realizing
the implications. But when
someone calls me a pig I don't
usually prepare myself to seek out

her ideas and to see how I can
change in a way that will benefit
society. Instead I prepare to
defend myself and argue, then a
wall is built between me and the
person that is criticizing me.
Women's liberation is not an
isolated cause that can achieve its
goals without help. I'm not the
only male that wants to change a
little. But if you keep calling us
male chauvinist pigs we might just
quit trying and believe you. After
all, what good does it do for a
"pig" to change?

The need for change in our
society is apparent to me. Women
are, in many cases, subjected to a
second class position. Great talent
is often either undeveloped, lost
or wasted. But I don't think a
battle is called for. On the
contrary, I think cooperation is
needed, with discussion and
education.
I often do "sexist" things
without knowing it or realizing
the implications. But when
someone calls me a pig I don't
usually prepare myself to seek out

her ideas and to see how I can
change in a way that will benefit
society. Instead I prepare to
defend myself and argue, then a
wall is built between me and the
person that is criticizing me.
Women's liberation is not an
isolated cause that can achieve its
goals without help. I'm not the
only male that wants to change a
little. But if you keep calling us
male chauvinist pigs we might just
quit trying and believe you. After
all, what good does it do for a
"pig" to change?

The women's liberation
movement appears to have run
into difficulties here at Stanford.
Changes, if any, are coming
slowly; a "battle of the sexes"
seems near.
In an attempt to find where
the problem is I examined the
goals of the movement and the
tactics and techniques used to
achieve those goals. In both cases
this was not an in-depth study;
merely an examination of how the
movement appears as it expresses
itself in day-to-day happenings
here on campus.
I am sorry to say that I was
unable to find the problem.
Goals
Taking goals first, I found
them not only honorable, but
indeed very reasonable. Women
want to be given equal
opportunities and be treated as
human beings, not objects. The
sexism and discrimination that
now flourish must end.
I am especially impressed to
find that many feel that by
allowing women equal educational
and social opportunities women
can in turn become a more useful
and positive force in our society,
that by developing the talents that
now so often lie dormant we can
make strides towards the
betterment of all humanity.
Taking tactics next I was still
unable to find the problem. They
seem to do everything right.
When a man opens a door for
them they glare at him and call

him a "male chauvinist pig,"
maybe adding an obscene word or
two if it was a big door. When a
"sexist" comment issues from a
movie screen, oinks and hisses are
soon heard.
The handling of the recent Phi
Delt situation was superb!
Recognizing that a woman cannot
be allowed the freedom to control
her own body, the women's
libbers leaped into action.
First they produced picket
signs with phrases thoughtfully
constructed to help insure that a
rational dialogue would develop;
for example, "Off Phi Delt Pigs."
The Phi Delts lost their
individuality and were quickly
stereotyped and de-humanized.
Finally, actions are now being
taken to seek retribution.
Change
So that I won't be charged
with doing the same thing that
this article criticizes I will clarify
my position and seek a "rational
dialogue."
