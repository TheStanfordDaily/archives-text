# SESPA: A New Organization
## On Scientists And Politics 
### 
Kahn And Fricke

A widespread characteristic of
science — and particularly
engineering — departments in
most American universities has
been the consistent lack of
political and social awareness on
the part of students and faculty.
This lack of awareness has its
roots in the economic and
political structure of corporate,
state, and Federal research
policies. Research funds have been
consistently poured into
politically and economically
conservative sectors — principally

those in defense of vested
interests.
Any projects that may
significantly alter or redirect
America's foreign stance or
domestic economic, political, and
social structures are rejected.
Instead, money is poured into
projects that are innately designed
to at best maintain the status quo,
and at worst wipe out mankind.
Complacency
Having established the
conservative-destructive nature of
much of technical research in the

United States, it is now easier to
understand the complacency of so
many science and engineering
departments in American
universities. Scientific study and
engineering have developed into
particularly impersonal activities.
The average researcher is not
enough concerned with such
questions as the usage and
purpose of his work. Instead, he
overly limits himself to the
narrow considerations of making
his design work within the
parameters of funding and

regulations. Today, technology'
urgently needs a consciousness of
larger human needs, not narrow
career pursuits.
At Stanford, the lack of an
issue-oriented awareness in the
natural sciences and engineering is
the rule rather than the exception.
Issues
In Palo Alto, we have been
hearing less about DoD research;
less about the bombing of
Cambodia; less about the U.S.'s
'foreign aid' in the form of mass
birth control in Latin America;
less about the way big business is
co-opting the issues of ecology
and environmental consciousness;
less about the power lobbies'
attempts to limit large-scale fusion
research; less about the electronic
gadgetry that is listening in on
more of us each year. The list goes
on. Yet, as a community that is
integrally involved in such
matters, are we, at Stanford,
willing to act on these issues,
assuming we know about them?
There can be only one answer,
and that is yes. An organization
through which such action can be
effected is being assembled. Called
the Stanford Chapter of Scientists
and Engineers for Social and
Political Action (SESPA), our
group intends to attack the
problems of apathy and lack of
commitment in the sciences and
engineering, and of social
injustice, with a three-fold mode
of action:
(1) SESPA at Stanford plans to
increase the Stanford
community's awareness of the
issues with a program of activities
including open meetings with
guest speakers, and rallies.
Consciousness
(2) Through such meetings we
plan to have a position on most
any political or social issue that is
brought to our attention by other
chapters of SESPA or intrinsic to
the Palo Alto area. In short we
will develop a strong
consciousness of the issues both
technical and otherwise, that have
received so little recognition at
Stanford.
(3) Finally, we plan a People's
Science Combine where our
technological resources are
applied towards the needs of the
people, be it through an
information bank or actual
technical projects.
There is much to be done.
If you are interested in joining
or just want to find out more, call
Philip Kahn at 328-4336 or Tom
Fricke 328-6797; or come to our
meeting Wednesday May 16 at 8
p.m. in Bldg. 310 (Architecture
Corner in Quad).
