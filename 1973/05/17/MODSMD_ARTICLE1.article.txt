# Minority Enrollment Percentages Remain The Same
## 
### LARRY FLEECE (First of two parts) 
The total number of minority students admitted to
next year's incoming freshman class is "roughly the same"
as last year's total, according to Dean of Admissions Fred
A. Hargadon.
With the admissions process for next year all but
completed, Hargadon reported that approximately 75
black students, 70-75 Chicanos, and 15-20 Native
Americans will be enrolled as freshmen next fall.
Entering students from the three minority groups
combined will make up roughly 12 percent of the 1450
entering freshmen. The incoming class was selected from
an applicant pool of 9300 candidates.
Hargadon said the percentages of minority students for
next fall's freshmen correspond closely to the present
undergraduate minority student percentages. Hargadon
estimated that presently, the undergraduate student body
is composed of six percent blacks, five percent Chicanos,
and slightly over one percent Native Americans.
But Hargadon stressed that there is no University quota
policy which fixes the percentages or numbers of minority
students eligible for entrance. "The University has a
commitment to encourage the enrollment of students
from the three minority groups, but this commitment
does not imply a specific, arbitrarily set number of
minority students," Hargadon said.
Five-Year Old Program
The University administration agreed to give special
attention to the enrollment of black students in the spring
of 1968, in the wake of the assassination of Dr. Martin
Luther King, and extended its commitment to Chicano
and Native American students shortly thereafter.
President Richard W. Lyman, who is presently
undertaking a major review of all University minority
student programs, defined the University's commitment
this way: "Stanford is committed to bringing members of

minority groups into full participation in the life of the
institution.
"Vigorous recruitment programs, adequate financial
aid, and appropriate curricular and co-curricular programs
are essential parts of that commitment."
Several Criteria
But Hargadon said he does not interpret the University
commitment to imply that minority students should be
admitted simply on the basis of their ethnic background.
"Undergraduate applications are reviewed as a whole,"
Hargadon said, "on the basis of several standard criteria."
He listed the criteria, in no specific order of importance,
as:
— High school grade point average;
— Scholastic Aptitude and Achievement test scores;
— Evidence of outstanding strengths in a single area
(i.e., science, English, etc.);
— Two teachers' recommendations and the applicant's
essay; and
— The strength of the academic program at the
applicant's high school.
Emily Canales, admissions officer on Hargadon's staff,
said the final criterion is most relevant in relation to the
question of minority admissions. "In considering the
academic program at the applicant's high school, we
attempt to assess how well the applicant has made use of
the resources available to him. A minority student will be
considered in light of his performance within the
academic framework of his particular high school,
whether it be in a disadvantaged ghetto district or not,"
Canales said.
Rural Consideration
"Similarly, a non-minority applicant from a small, rural
high school will receive consideration relative to his
situation."
Hargadon said that as recently as six years ago,
minority students comprised as little as one-half of one

percent of the student enrollment at Stanford. When the
University embarked on its intensive minority recruiting
program as a result of its recognized commitment, two
assumptions were made:
— that minority students would be socio-economically
disadvantaged; and
— that they would be educationally disadvantaged.
"Both of these assumptions haunt the admissions
office now," Hargadon said. He explained that with the
exception of the general socio-economic disadvantage of
the Native Americans, the admissions office encounters
the full range of credentials among minority applicants.
Wide 'Advertising'
In order to fulfill the University commitment to
minority students, Hargadon and his nine-member staff
cover some 40 states prior to the application deadline,
visiting and speaking at schools. "I certainly think it's fair
to say that we're advertising ourselves to a wider variety
and larger number of students than in the past," Hargadon
said. "This year we visited a number of never-before
visited high schools."
Hargadon said one new method of getting to the
maximum number of applicants is by sending out flyers in
advance advertising regional meetings for any interested
high school students in the area.
To supplement the recruiting program for minority
students, the admissions office has prepared black student
and Chicano student brochures, and a smaller Native
American leaflet, which describe the costs, financial aids
opportunities and curricular offerings for minority
students entering Stanford.
No More 'Early Admission'
In addition, the admissions office under Hargadon's
administration has done away with the old University
policy of sending out "early response" letters of
acceptance to "outstanding candidates." "There is simply

greater equity in notifying all candidates at the same time,
regardless of their qualifications," Hargadon said.
As further evidence of the University commitment to
minority recruiting, Financial Aids Counselor Lorene Leos
reported that "after everything has been computed on the
basis of individual need, the minority student is awarded
his first-year scholarship in the form of a gift, rather than
a loan or part-time job." As the rationale behind this,
Leos cited the belief that the first-year transition for the
minority student from the ghetto or reservation to the
Stanford community is a more difficult one.
But Gwen Shunatona, head of the Native American
Studies Program, feels there is "great ambiguity" in the
goals and the success of the University commitment to
minority students. "In their minds, the University feels
they are recruiting Indians, but in our minds, they are not
doing it effectively," Shunatona said.
She said that this year, three recruiting trips for Native
American applicants were planned: to the Southwest, to
the Midwest, and to North and South Dakota. Shunatona
herself went on the first two trips, but said that "since I
couldn't go on the third trip, no one went."
"It isn't even my job to go recruiting," Shunatona said,
"but I do." She pointed out that although there is a
Chicano admissions officer [Emily Canales] and a
part-time black admissions officer (James Simmons] on
Hargadon's staff, there is no Native American admissions
officer.
Shunatona also said that the Stanford curriculum
virtually ignores Native American history and culture, and
that as a result, her youthful Native American Studies
Program is seeking to diversify the curricular options. "We
are promoting Native American studies not only for
Native Americans, but for everyone interested,"
Shunatona said.
