(The following editorials on
the Watergate scandal are here
reprinted for our readers'
edification. The first originally
appeared in Berkeley's Daily
Californian on May 3; the second
in the Harvard Crimson on May
I.)
Inoperative
It is particularly satisfying to
read day-by-day the continuing
saga of President Nixon and the
Watergate Seven — Ten —
Fifty
It is even more satisfying to be
not only morally right, as we have
often been in the past to no avail
with Tricky Dick, but even right
within the legal and political
system itself.
We were right on the Indochina
war — and busted our heads
against a stone wall of secrecy and
power that .many of us in jail
and forced to emigrate while war
criminals dumped daily dishes of
death on the Vietnamese people
and Nixon watched football
games on TV.
Subversion
We saw ITT attempt to subvert
democracy in Chile through the
CIA and the legal system at home,
with blatantly scandalous
anti-trust evasions arranged bv

high Nixon administration
officials.
We heard the President and
Vice-President decry the "bias" of
the "Eastern-liberal press" while
subverting the people's right to
know with limited news
conferences, prior restraint
attempts, and non-news events
unscrupulously devised to obscure
any real issues.
And we listened to the
administration attack
demonstrators as treasonous while
at the same time devising
ingenious plots such as
wiretapping and preventive
detention to calcify our national
backbone.
Minority
And throughout the five years
that these demoralizing incidents
and concepts were thrusted upon
us, we were always the minority,
always unable to nail down the
President on his unconstitutional
behavior.
But finally all the malodorous
schemes that brewed out of public
reach at the White House have
been symbolized — publicly — by
the Watergate fiasco.
It is one of the greatest
scandals to come to light in this or
any other democratic country's

history when those we entrust
with the enforcement of the
nation's law conspire to cover-up
criminality. President Nixon has
personally accepted responsibility
for the entire matter.
Bullshit
And yet some say we must
preserve our system by retraining
from attack upon the President, as
if he were some god rather than a
common human being, elected by
his fellows to govern honestly and
wisely.
They say that to preserve our
country, and what is left of the
trust people have in our
government, we must shield the
President from culpability and let
him flit around the world on our
air force jets conspiring with other
equally corrupt heads of state
over how best to carve up the
globe.
Bullshit.
Boil
The only way we will have
even partial trust in this
government is to see the boil —
Nixon, his cronies and their
subordinates — lanced, and flush
the pus down the Potomac River
as John Ehrlichman would like to
have done with sensitive FBI files.
According to a public survey,
only nine percent of the American
people trust Nixon's statements
on Watergate. A government this
weak with its people has lost its
right to power.
If Nixon were a senator, or
prime minister in any
parliamentary system, he would
have long since been removed
from office.
Because of the timid, slow
process our senators and
representatives seem to prefer,
Congress is unlikely to impeach
Nixon. But it must stand up and
assume de facto control of the
country while there is still time.
Nixon's attempts at muzzling
congress can now be met head on
and shot down.
Government by one man, as
Nixon has tried to design for five
years now looks impossible. A
breeding ground for arrogance and
criminality, it has become, to
quote Ronald Ziegler out of
context, "inoperative."
(The Daily CalifornianJ
Watergate
After only two months of his
second term, President Nixon has
already become a lame duck
President. The Watergate crisis has
seriously undermined the
credibility of his Administration,
and has doomed any domestic and
foreign policy progrmas that
Nixon intended to push through
the slightly Democratic Congress.
April 30's mass resignation
came 13 days after the President
announced that his own
investigation of the bugging
scandal had brought "major
developments" to his attention.
Thirteen days of innuendo, 13
days of leaks to the press, 13 days
of endless rumor. Although the
recent revelations clearly
demanded immediate honest and
forthright action, the President
chose to retire to the solitude of
Camp David, Md., to contemplate
the effect of the Watergate affair,
and to decide what moves must be
made to save his Administration
from ruination.
When he emerged, Nixon
finally took the course everyone
expected him to take. He asked
for the resignations of his top
aides, fired his legal counsel, and
delivered a nationwise address on
television. In that speech, he
accepted responsibility, but did
not pinpoint blame. He again
shillyshallied on the issue,
stressing domestic and foreign
policy goals instead of taking a
positive stand.

Nixon may be too late. When
the crisis called for directness,
Nixon answered with evasiveness.
When it became clear that his
chief legal counsel supervised a
coverup, Nixon answered with a
phone call "you're still my
counsel." When the situation
called for leadership, Nixon
answered by further isolating
himself from the American
people.
Instead of asking 13 days
earlier for the resignation of his
aides involved with the break-in at
Democratic National
Headquarters or those implicated
in the alleged coverup attempt,
Nixon asked Henry A. Kissinger,
his foreign policy adviser, to give a
major speech on European
relations. Kissinger's speech
momentarily displaced the
Watergate affair as the top news
story, but it proved the
detrimental effect the Watergate
affair is having on Nixon's
programs. When Kissinger pleaded
for "compassion," it was not only
for the convicted conspirators,
but for Nixon's floundering
Administration as well.
Those familiar with Nixon's
career know that political
double-dealing is not above
Nixon. In the 1962 California
gubernatorial race, the Nixon
campaign sent postcards to
500,000 Democrats soliciting
funds. The postcard did not
mention Nixon's name, or the
Republican party. It asked:
"Please send a contribution to
preserve the Democratic Party in
California." A California court
ruled that Nixon "reviewed,
amended, and finally approved"
the operation. But more
importantly, the court found that
a number of present Nixon
associates were involved in the
project, including Nixon's
personal lawyer Herbert
Kalmbach, HEW's Caspar

Weinberger, communications
director Herb Klein, and Maurice
Stans. The director of the project
was H.R. Haldeman.
Tricks
Nixon knew of the 1962
attempt at political sabotage, and
there is no doubt that his 1972
re-election committee ran one of
the most suspect campaigns in
American political history. But to
conjure up political tricks from
Nixon's past is not enough to
implicate the President himself.
Even now, the Washington Post
asserts the Nixon Administration
is devising a strategy to offset the
full disclosure planned by legal
counsel John W. Dean.
The resignation of attorney
general Richard G. Kleindienst
demonstrates an important
distinction that must be
emphasized in the Watergate case
or any other public scandal.
Behavior need not be criminal to
be disreputable, and men may be
unfit for public trust before being
convicted on crime like perjury or
obstruction of justice. If President
Nixon recognized thenecessity of
accepting Kleindienst's resignation
— submitted because of the
attorney general's "close
association" with those involved
in the scandal, he must also
recognize the unsavory light this
logic casts on his entire
Administration.
As President, Nixon is
ultimately responsible for both his
Administration and his party. The
Watergate affair has discounted
any possibility that he could
effectively lead either. The
unusual circumstances brought on
by the Watergate scandal calls for
unusual measures to meet the
crisis. In keeping with his own
sense of decency, the President
must resign his office, and
Vice-President Agnew must resign
as well.
