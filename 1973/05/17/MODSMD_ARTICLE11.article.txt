Dollies Demur
Editor:
I am writing on behalf of the
five new Dollies concerning your
front page article (May 14).
As a preface to her interview,
Ms. Sanders indicated that she was
interested in getting to know a
little about us as individuals. She
explained that she had no idea of
what she was going to include in
the story itself, which was why
her questions were so varied.
It seemed to us, after reading
the article, that Ms. Sanders had a
definite purpose in mind. . What
we thought would be a feature
story about five individuals turned
out to be an impersonal
affirmation of Ms. Sanders'
preconceived ideas of a "Stanford
Dolly."
Among the misquotes and
misleading comments in Ms.
Sanders' article was the statement
concerning our career ambitions.
All of us are planning to make use
of our Stanford degrees after
graduation, but we have no
definite plans as yet. Although we
are considered "apolitical," we
feel that that attitude is shared by
many Stanford students. On the
whole, the negative tone of the
story and its use of quotations did
not give an accurate account of
our statements.
Ms. Sanders was very efficient
in fitting us to the stereotyped
"Dolly image" that we refuted.

The article's emphasis was on
politics and women's liberation,
areas in which none of us are
actively involved.
What makes us unique
Stanford students, worthy (in the
Daily's opinion) of a feature
article, is involvement with
the Stanford Band as Stanford
Dollies. None of us would have
tried out if we felt the Dolly
image was undesirable. What
attracted us to try out for the
position was that we share the
Band's perspective on the purpose
of their entertainment. They are
there to have a good time and
please their audience. Although
we will work hard to fulfil our
part of the entertainment, we
don't consider what we are doing
serious business. Our "constant
smiles" are the proof that we are
enjoying what we are doing.
It seems to us that Ms. Sanders
was not at all interested in the
topic she reported and whether or
not she intended her story to be a
hatchet job, that was how it
appeared. We regret that we all
share naivete in an interview
situation for the Daily. Next time,
if there is a next time, there will
be more awareness on our part
and if it can be helped, a lot more
honesty on the part of the
interviewer.
