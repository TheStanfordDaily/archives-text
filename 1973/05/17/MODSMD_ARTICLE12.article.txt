# Public, Private Management Specialist
## Endowed GSB Professor Named 
### 
Alain C. Enthoven, 42, a
Stanford Rhodes scholar who was
a top aide in the Department of
Defense during the Kennedy and
Johnson administrations, has been
appointed to the Marriner S.
Eccles professorship of public and
private management at the
Graduate School of Business.
He is the first occupant of the
endowed chair recently
established by Marriner S. Eccles,
banker, business executive and
former chairman of the Federal
Reserve Board.
Enthoven, currently president
of Litton Medical Products, a
subsidiary of Litton Industries in
Beverly Hills, will join the faculty
in August.
Business School Dean Arjay
Miller termed Enthoven's
appointment "one of the most
exciting possible developments in
our evolving public management
program. With his academic
training, his top level executive
experience in both the public and
private sectors, and his particular
research interests, I can't conceive
of a more suitable appointment
for the Eccles chair."
Provost William F. Miller said
Enthoven "brings to the

University and to the Business
School's new public management
program an unusual blend of
achievement as a scholar and as an
executive in both business and
government.
Enthoven's background and
business and government
experience qualify him to teach a
wide range of subjects including
economics, business policy, public
policy, and the broader area of
issues in business and government.
In addition, his major research
interest is in health care delivery
systems, a field in which the
Business and Medical schools have
a joint research program.
Enthoven is the second major
faculty addition to the Business
School's new program in public
management in the last year.
Former Rand Corporation
President Henry S. Rowen was
named to the faculty last spring.
Rowen who served in the
Department of Defense with
Enthoven, called the appointment
"a great coup" for Stanford.
Enthoven was one of a group
of civilian experts former
Secretary of Defense Robert
McNamara brought to the
Pentagon from the Rand
Corporation at the start of the
Kennedy administration. That
group also included Charles J.
Hitch, now president of the
University of California.
Enthoven was a key figure in
implementing McNamara
authorized reforms in the
Pentagon budgetary and planning
process â€” reforms which made
wide use of cost-benefit
techniques in determining defense
budgets, and in choosing weapons
systems, and military strategies.
For his government service
President Kennedy in 1963

presented him with the President's
award for distinguished federal
civilian service, and in 1969 then
Defense Secretary Clark Clifford
awarded Enthoven the
Department's medal for
outstanding public service.

He has written extensively on
monetary theory, mathematical
economics, decision theory,
systems analysis and national
defense. Among his writings are
"How Much is Enough? Shaping
the Defense Program 1961-69,"

which he coauthored with K.
Wayned Smith; "Defense Planning
and Organization," which he
wrote with Rowen; "A
Neo-Classical Model of Money,
Debt, Economic Growth," from a
book by Stanford economists
John Gurley and E.S. Shaw; and
"The Simple Mathematcis of
Maximization," from a book
coauthored by Charles Hitch.
Born in Seattle and trained as
an economists, Enthoven holds an
A.B. from Stanford, A.B. Phil,
from Oxford, which he earned as
Rhodes scholar, and a Ph.D. from
MIT.
He spent a year as an
economics instructor at MIT and
four years as an economist at
Rand Corporation before joining
the Department of Defense in
1960.
He left the government in 1969
to work in the health industry
with Litton Industries, and in
1971 was named president of
Litton Medical Products. Among
his professional associations, he is
a member of the Institute of
Medicine of the National
Academy of Sciences.
Enthoven is expected to move
to the Stanford area in August.
