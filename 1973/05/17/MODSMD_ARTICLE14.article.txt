# Indians Here Win Debate Tournament
## 
### 
Four representatives of the
Stanford American Indian
Organization returned with a
first-place award from a ten-team
debate tournament held at the
University of Montana.
The topic, "Resolved: the
takeover of the Bureau of Indian
Affairs in Washington D.C. was
detrimental to Indian people,"
was prepared by Stanford
students Sara Sneed, a sophomore
in history, Tony Vaska, a graduate
student in anthropology, A 1
Harris, a junior in political
science, and Irwin Harrison, a
sophomore in pre-medical studies.
Harris and Harrison took the
affirmative position while Sneed
and Vaska argued the negative.
The debates were held as part
of the Fifth Kyi-yo Youth
Conference, which gathers
500-700 Indian youths yearly to
deal with different aspects of
American Indian affairs. This
year's theme was cultural
integrity.
Each of the Stanford groups
debated three times and was rated
on a point system. Opposing

schools included Eastern
Montana, Berkeley, Green River
Community College, and the
University of Washington.
Debates were of regular college
debating format except that time
periods were shortened.
Constructive speeches were eight
minutes instead of the usual ten;
and rebuttals were four rather
than five minutes.
The Kyi-yo debates were
judged on six different counts by
University of Montana faculty
members and Indian leaders.
Categories included presentation,
evidence, and argument.
Sneed, Vaska, Harris, and
Harrison were selected for the
debate team by try-outs from
Stanford's American Indian
Organization. None on the
Stanford team had debated
before.
The four were coached by a
Stanford law student, who aided
them chiefly in format and
strategy, according to Vaska.
The debate team was
sponsored by Stanford's American
Indian Program.
