# Delightful Dance
## 
### ANN MALMUTH 
Many native African dance groups have appeared in the area:
Dancers of Mali, Senegal Dancers, and now Les Ballets Africains at
Flint Center, May 3. Each African country seems duty bound to tour
its national dance group through Europe and America.
Although there is not much difference in the basic style of dancing
exhibited by these groups, there is great difference in the imagination
brought to bear on the theatrical garnishings.
Of all the groups, Les Ballets Africains from the Republic of
Guinea, reign supreme in this realm. Intricate story lines involving
heart-rending tales of woe or expert Abbot-Casteloesque humor, are
woven into these dances.
Good Direction
The costumes and props are the most beautiful and the overall
direction, the best. It is also clear that the dancer's spirits are high and
that they perform for their own pleasure.
More than other African Ensembles, Les Ballets Africains is
concerned with the amusement of the Western audience. Presumably
this requires greater deviation from the dance styles as practiced in the
native villages.
Thus, their movements and choreography have more variation than
repetition, and their interpretation is much more graphic and literal
than the original ethnic product.
The dances depict the history of the people and the flavor of their
lives. In the touching presentation of "The Lion King," symbolic of
the hope for a unified Africa, Sudiata Keita is heir to the Kangaba
throne.
Exiled
Crippled since birth and exiled from his land by a usurping
brother, he painstakingly brings himself to walk and eventually
succeeds in regaining his throne and unifying a large part of Africa.
Les Ballets Africains consists of 45 participants selected from
village groups. The men stamp, leap, and shake with incredible
abandon on the ground or high stilts. The women seem less skilled in
comparison to the women of other African groups, but they are very
young and pretty.
Although Les Ballets Africains' bids for the Western audience with
a diverse array of theatrical devices, their fundamental attraction
remains the strength, frankness, and spontaneity of the dancers.
