## 'Last Tango' Lacks Deep Impact 
### ELLEN KENESHEA 
Bernardo Bertolucci's "Last
Tango in Paris" is a depressing
study in human relationships. The
film is by turns bitter, or cynical,
its characters are nasty, foolish
and lost. They are people of
unrealized potentials, trapped by
their own incapacities for dealing
with life and with each other.
They act, but they do not feel.
Unfortunatley, "Last Tango"
itself, for all its fitful bursts of
frenzy, finally fails to break
through to the agony beneath,
and lacks emotional depth.
Bertolucci never quite pulls the
threads of his film together. "Last
Tango" has strength in bits and
pieces, but it wants the power that
comes from being more than just
the sum of its parts.
The story covers a few days in
the lives of its characters. Paul
(Marlon Brando), has spent his life
bouncing from unsuccessful job to
job, landed in Paris and married
the proprietress of a sleazy hotel.
As the film opens, his wife has
just committed suicide, and he is
looking for an apartment,
presumedly to get away from his
hotel and his wife's death.
Encounter
Paul meets Jeanne (Maria
Schneider), a twenty year old
Parisian looking for an apartment
for herself and her fiance (Jean
Pierre Leaud). In the bare
apartment Paul attacks Jeanne,

she responds with vehemence;
they decide to meet there for sex
without ties — they don't even tell
each other their names.
Eventually Jeanne tires of the
game and wants to break it off for
her marriage, but Paul decides

that he loves her, won't let her go,
and wants to know her name.
Brando does his best to make
Paul's actions believable and even
sympathetic throughout. He tries
to get at the fears — of death,
defeat, age — that hound the man.
But Brando's acting is inconsistent
in "Last Tango," and not entirely
successful with Paul. In some
moments with Schneider Paul
seems to emerge, but on the
whole it is always Brando present
on the screen, and not always
Brando at his best.
Jeanne's fiance is a young
would be film director. He has
decided to make a film about
J eanne and their love, and thus

they are continuously followed by
an entire film crew,
photographing and recording their
relationship.
Travesty
Bertolucci uses Leaud and the
scenes with Schneider to make a

travesty of French New Wave
films. Sincy Leaud starred in a
number of such films, particularly
Francois Truffaut's, the irony is
double-edged.
But these sequences finally
miss the mark, for while they do
comment on the banality and
absurdity of Leaud's character
and actions, they also become
silly and tiresome in themselves.
Bertolucci is most harsh with
Schneider's character . Jeanne
allows Leaud to direct her
emotional life, in fact to ridicule
their relationship by turning it
into nothing but the script for an
inane movie.
She allows Paul to direct her

sexual life, and to turn it into a
series of degrading and
humiliating encounters. None of
this seems to bother her much,
for, as Bertolucci would have it,
Jeanne is a brainless girl without
any moral fiber or will of her own.

emotional content to them, only
violent and abrupt physical
brutality. Paul's relationship to
Jeanne can best be described as
sado-masochistic, which leaves
one to wonder of what exactly his
sudden "love" for her at the end
of the film consists.
Still, Brando is more
convincing here than in a long
monologue delivered to his dead
wife's corpse, a speech that is
maudlin and so awkward as to be
almost silly.
Vittorio Storraro's camera sets
up lush and heavy patterns for
"Last Tango." But if the
photography adds both richness
and a feeling of encroaching
darkness to the atmosphere, it has
little of the formal beauty of
Bertolucci's last film "The
Conformist."
Gato Barbieri's semi-jazz score
for the film fits now and then, but
is almost as often grating and
unhelpful to the visual images.
In some ways, "Last Tango in
Paris" is an extreme example of
the male's paranoid projection of
woman as whore and destroyer.
The vision seems to belong not
only to Paul, but to Bertolucci as
well. In any case, "Last Tango"
falls short of the intensity and
excellence of "The Conformist."
By comparison, "Last Tango"
seems disunified and dissatisfying.
Bertolucci is a fine director, but
this is not his best work.

Further, though Brando always
appears fully clothed, Schneider is
generally half-dressed or nude
when she is with him, waiting for
Paul to tell her what to do. And
though in the end it is he who
chases after her, this is hardly a
victory for a girl who, when asked
whether to prove her love she
would eat vomit, replies, "yes,
and more."
The sex scenes in "Last Tango"
are no more explicit than those
for a number of other feature
films, and, of course, contain
nowhere near anything like the
graphic detail of hard core
pornographic films. The scenes are
also anti-erotic in that there is no
