# 'A & E' Acted By Able Female Cast
## 
### JEFFERY SEGAL 
There is no need to think of the late show cast of "The Architect
and the Emperor of Assyria" as the "second" cast, because these two
wonderful actresses, Carol Bunker and Ellen Mease, can hold their
own against the men any day.
As a matter of fact, that thought is the thematic basis of the female
production, which is an experimental production of the script
involving a complete symbolic transvaluation and rewrite of Fernando
Arrabal's script by director John Chioles.
The play is still about the panic of modern civilization, cut off
from its social and metaphysical roots by its own so-called progress.
But the rewritten production deals with the additional modern
problem of women trying to cope with a man's world which they have
usurped in an effort to make it their own.
This added element, rather than confusing the play with something
that doesn't belong, actually seems to clarify the basic theme in the
hands of these two exciting women.
Finest Performance
Carol Bunker gives her finest performance this year as the
Architect, struggling valiantly to keep up an image of power, yet
panicked as she surveys the bridges burned behind her. Her physical
beauty and emotional power are arresting.
Director Chioles has transformed the male, aggressive element of
the Emperor's long speech about proving the existence of god by his
own power at a pinball machine into a seductive strip for Bunker that
is one of the great, satirically comic moments in the show.
Lithe and loveable Ellen Mease is the perfect complement for
Bunker. As the complexly symbolic character of the innocent
Architect she is at once comic and touching. Her warmth is quick to
put an audience very much at ease.
Control
The great analytical and creative work which Chioles has put into
this production is obvious. The show, even in its most wild moments,
is clearly under tight directional control. Chioles has changed the
ending of the play to something more vague, less theatrical, and,
unfortunately, less interesting.
But even if the ending leaves you a little empty, the body of the
work is powerful and enjoyable, making for a truly fulfilling way to
spend the weekend's wee hours.
The female cast of "The Architect and the Emperor of Assyria"
plays again this weekend, May 17-19, at midnight. The male cast
continues through Saturday, May 19, nightly at 8 p.m. Both casts play
in the Nitery in the Old Union, Tickets are $2 for non-studnets and $1
for students, on sale at the door one half hour before performance.
