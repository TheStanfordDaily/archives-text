# Could Have Talked At Mem Aud
## Black Muslim Postpones Campus Speech 
### KEVIN SMITH 
Black Muslim Minister John
Muhammad has "indefinitely
postponed" a speech he was scheduled
to present on campus tonight,
according to Asst. Psychology Prof.
Cedric X. Muhammad postponed his
speech despite the fact that Memorial
Auditorium was available to
accommodate him.
No specific reason was given for the
postponement and X expressed hope
that Muhammad will appear
"sometime in the future." Muhammad
is due to speak at Berkeley May 23.
Muhammad's decision climaxed a
week of controversy during which it
was discovered that Muhammad had
been denied permission to speak in
Memorial Church by Chapel Dean
Robert G. H. Kelly, pending a meeting
between Muhammad and Kelly. Last
Monday Kelly expressed reservations
about the "racist aspect" of the Black
Muslim religion, as his reason for
requesting such a meeting.
'Undignified Remarks'
While hesitating to speculate on the
reasons for Muhammed's decision not
to speak, X remarked, "It might have
been due to some of the undignified
remarks made about Islam by Dean
Kelly."

Kelly would only say, "I regret that
he is not going to speak."
ASSU Co-President Charles
Ogletree, who chairs the Black
Students Union, and three other
students met with Kelly on Tuesday in
an unsuccessful attempt to resolve the
issue of Muhammad speaking in the
Church.
According to Ogletree, the meeting
"didn't clear up or change the status at
all." Ogletree said Kelly held firm to
his position "that he would have to
talk to Minister Muhammad before he
would allow him to speak."
Claiming that such a meeting would
not be held, Ogletree stated, "Minister
Muhammad is not accustomed to
having briefings" before he speaks.
Protest
Kelly said the article in the Daily
last Tuesday misrepresented his
position, and specifically protested the
headline. In a press release distributed
Tuesday, Kelly said:
"I regret that the headline in the
Stanford Daily gave the impression
that the request for John Muhammad
to speak had been turned down. A
final decision had not been made, and
I hope the following points will
explain the true situation.
"1. According to the policy which

we have been following, events
scheduled by me must be adopted as
part of the religious program of the
Church.
"2. We did not have enough
information on which to base a
decision whether to adopt this event
or not.
"3. I asked for an opportunity to
discuss the event with the principals,
mentioning particularly my reservation
about what I understood to be a
'racist' element in Elijah Muhammad's
theology.
"4. The request is being held
pending such discussion."
No 'Standard Regulations'
However, Ogletree said that in the
discussion Tuesday, Kelly informed
him that "there were not any standard
or decided regulations" governing
speakers who want to use the Church.
Kelly claimed the article "did a
great disservice to the whole cause of
human understanding — especially the
headline." Kelly said he felt the article
"probably had a lot to do with" the
postponement of the speech. X labeled
the article "fair."
When asked whether he felt anyone
had acted in bad faith, X quipped,
"No, I think they're acting out of
Christian faith!" He elaborated, "I

think people are acting on the basis of
their prejudices and beliefs. I think all
of us act on the basis of our prejudices
and beliefs ..
Racism
However, X said of Kelly, who
comes from South Africa, "This whole
thing is kind of ironic to think that a
man from that part of the world
should presume to know about racism.

BELEAGUERED CHAPEL DEAN Robert G.H. Kelly has stood firm on his
decision not to allow Black Muslim Minister John Muhammad to speak in
Memorial Church unless Muhammad agrees to meet with Kelly first. Kelly said
he was disturbed by what he saw as "racist aspects" of the Black Muslim
religion. Muhammad has since "indefinitely postponed" his speech, which had
been scheduled to take place tonight.
I have nothing against Kelly
personally. I understand
him .... When you understand why a
person behaves the way he does, you
have compassion towards him."
A final mix-up in this incident
occurred over the availability of
Memorial Auditorium. Muhammad
was originally scheduled to speak in
Memorial Auditorium Tuesday
night, but the speech was rescheduled
for tonight.
X and Ogletree claimed that they

were told the auditorium was not
available for tonight, and therefore
never put in a request to use it.
However, Public Events Director
Thomas Bacchetti said Monday that
the auditorium was available and to his
knowledge always had been.
When Ogletree determined that the
Church was unavailable, he did make
arrangements Tuesday to hold the
speech in Memorial Auditorium
tonight, but these plans fell through
when Muhammad called off the
speech.

BELEAGUERED CHAPEL DEAN Robert G.H. Kelly has stood firm on his
decision not to allow Black Muslim Minister John Muhammad to speak in
Memorial Church unless Muhammad agrees to meet with Kelly first. Kelly said
he was disturbed by what he saw as "racist aspects" of the Black Muslim
religion. Muhammad has since "indefinitely postponed" his speech, which had
been scheduled to take place tonight.
I have nothing against Kelly
personally. I understand
him .... When you understand why a
person behaves the way he does, you
have compassion towards him."
A final mix-up in this incident
occurred over the availability of
Memorial Auditorium. Muhammad
was originally scheduled to speak in
Memorial Auditorium Tuesday
night, but the speech was rescheduled
for tonight.
X and Ogletree claimed that they

were told the auditorium was not
available for tonight, and therefore
never put in a request to use it.
However, Public Events Director
Thomas Bacchetti said Monday that
the auditorium was available and to his
knowledge always had been.
When Ogletree determined that the
Church was unavailable, he did make
arrangements Tuesday to hold the
speech in Memorial Auditorium
tonight, but these plans fell through
when Muhammad called off the
speech.
Black Muslim Minister John
Muhammad has "indefinitely
postponed" a speech he was scheduled
to present on campus tonight,
according to Asst. Psychology Prof.
Cedric X. Muhammad postponed his
speech despite the fact that Memorial
Auditorium was available to
accommodate him.
No specific reason was given for the
postponement and X expressed hope
that Muhammad will appear
"sometime in the future." Muhammad
is due to speak at Berkeley May 23.
Muhammad's decision climaxed a
week of controversy during which it
was discovered that Muhammad had
been denied permission to speak in
Memorial Church by Chapel Dean
Robert G. H. Kelly, pending a meeting
between Muhammad and Kelly. Last
Monday Kelly expressed reservations
about the "racist aspect" of the Black
Muslim religion, as his reason for
requesting such a meeting.
'Undignified Remarks'
While hesitating to speculate on the
reasons for Muhammed's decision not
to speak, X remarked, "It might have
been due to some of the undignified
remarks made about Islam by Dean
Kelly."

Kelly would only say, "I regret that
he is not going to speak."
ASSU Co-President Charles
Ogletree, who chairs the Black
Students Union, and three other
students met with Kelly on Tuesday in
an unsuccessful attempt to resolve the
issue of Muhammad speaking in the
Church.
According to Ogletree, the meeting
"didn't clear up or change the status at
all." Ogletree said Kelly held firm to
his position "that he would have to
talk to Minister Muhammad before he
would allow him to speak."
Claiming that such a meeting would
not be held, Ogletree stated, "Minister
Muhammad is not accustomed to
having briefings" before he speaks.
Protest
Kelly said the article in the Daily
last Tuesday misrepresented his
position, and specifically protested the
headline. In a press release distributed
Tuesday, Kelly said:
"I regret that the headline in the
Stanford Daily gave the impression
that the request for John Muhammad
to speak had been turned down. A
final decision had not been made, and
I hope the following points will
explain the true situation.
"1. According to the policy which

we have been following, events
scheduled by me must be adopted as
part of the religious program of the
Church.
"2. We did not have enough
information on which to base a
decision whether to adopt this event
or not.
"3. I asked for an opportunity to
discuss the event with the principals,
mentioning particularly my reservation
about what I understood to be a
'racist' element in Elijah Muhammad's
theology.
"4. The request is being held
pending such discussion."
No 'Standard Regulations'
However, Ogletree said that in the
discussion Tuesday, Kelly informed
him that "there were not any standard
or decided regulations" governing
speakers who want to use the Church.
Kelly claimed the article "did a
great disservice to the whole cause of

headline." Kelly said he felt the article

remarks made about Islam by Dean
Kelly."

Kelly would only say, "I regret that
he is not going to speak."
ASSU Co-President Charles
Ogletree, who chairs the Black
Students Union, and three other
students met with Kelly on Tuesday in
an unsuccessful attempt to resolve the
issue of Muhammad speaking in the
Church.
According to Ogletree, the meeting
"didn't clear up or change the status at
all." Ogletree said Kelly held firm to
his position "that he would have to
talk to Minister Muhammad before he
would allow him to speak."
Claiming that such a meeting would
not be held, Ogletree stated, "Minister
Muhammad is not accustomed to
having briefings" before he speaks.
Protest
Kelly said the article in the Daily
last Tuesday misrepresented his
position, and specifically protested the
headline. In a press release distributed
Tuesday, Kelly said:
"I regret that the headline in the
Stanford Daily gave the impression
that the request for John Muhammad
to speak had been turned down. A
final decision had not been made, and
I hope the following points will
explain the true situation.
"1. According to the policy which

we have been following, events
scheduled by me must be adopted as
part of the religious program of the
Church.
"2. We did not have enough
information on which to base a
decision whether to adopt this event
or not.
"3. I asked for an opportunity to
discuss the event with the principals,
mentioning particularly my reservation
about what I understood to be a
'racist' element in Elijah Muhammad's
theology.
"4. The request is being held
pending such discussion."
No 'Standard Regulations'
However, Ogletree said that in the
discussion Tuesday, Kelly informed
him that "there were not any standard
or decided regulations" governing
speakers who want to use the Church.
Kelly claimed the article "did a
great disservice to the whole cause of
human understanding — especially the
headline." Kelly said he felt the article
"probably had a lot to do with" the
postponement of the speech. X labeled
the article "fair."
When asked whether he felt anyone
had acted in bad faith, X quipped,
"No, I think they're acting out of
Christian faith!" He elaborated, "I

think people are acting on the basis of
their prejudices and beliefs. I think all
of us act on the basis of our prejudices
and beliefs ..
Racism
However, X said of Kelly, who
comes from South Africa, "This whole
thing is kind of ironic to think that a
man from that part of the world
should presume to know about racism.

BELEAGUERED CHAPEL DEAN Robert G.H. Kelly has stood firm on his
decision not to allow Black Muslim Minister John Muhammad to speak in
Memorial Church unless Muhammad agrees to meet with Kelly first. Kelly said
he was disturbed by what he saw as "racist aspects" of the Black Muslim
religion. Muhammad has since "indefinitely postponed" his speech, which had
been scheduled to take place tonight.
I have nothing against Kelly
personally. I understand
him .... When you understand why a
person behaves the way he does, you
have compassion towards him."
A final mix-up in this incident
occurred over the availability of
Memorial Auditorium. Muhammad
was originally scheduled to speak in
Memorial Auditorium Tuesday
night, but the speech was rescheduled
for tonight.
X and Ogletree claimed that they

were told the auditorium was not
available for tonight, and therefore
never put in a request to use it.
However, Public Events Director
Thomas Bacchetti said Monday that
the auditorium was available and to his
knowledge always had been.
When Ogletree determined that the
Church was unavailable, he did make
arrangements Tuesday to hold the
speech in Memorial Auditorium
tonight, but these plans fell through
when Muhammad called off the
speech.
