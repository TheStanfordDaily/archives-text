# Emmys To Salute Cream Of TV Crop
## 
### DAN KRAVETZ 
May 20, for those who really
care, is the date the television
industry pats itself on the back at
the annual Emmy Awards
presentations. There are so many
award categories that anyone who
has ever worked in television
ought to have an Emmy or two
lying around the house; hence,
there is nothing to match the
glamor of the Oscar or the Tony.
Some of the more likely picks
for this year's major awards are
below. Note that each category
awards its Emmy, not for "the
best" but simply for an
"outstanding" achievement. That
adjective has some extra
advantages that are appropriate
for TV; if you don't believe this,
visit a fish market sometime.
You'll discover some outstanding
smells.
Outstanding Comedy Series:
You can usually determine this
award by calculating the IQ of the
average viewer for each show.
"Mary Tyler Moore" will win it
this year, over "Sanford," Archie,
"Maude" and "MASH," in that
order. See?
Outstanding Drama Series:
"Columbo" should get it, if only
because "McCloud" wasn't
nominated.
Misleading
Outstanding Variety Musical
Series: "Musical" is misleading;
this category really represents
non-situation comedy. "Carol
Burnett" wins the IQ test over
Andrews, Wilson, Cavett and the
Bonos.
Outstanding New Series:
Alastair Cooke's "America" series
is tops, even more so because it is
an NBC show, not a PBS
documentary. It just goes to show
that the networks, if they really
want to, can beat educational TV
at its own game.
Outstanding Performance by a
Series Leading Actor /Comedy: Of
all the nominees, only Redd Foxx
is a true original. And he's a lot
funnier than Carroll O'Connor.
Same award for an actress: It's
a toss-up between Jean Stapleton
and Moore (Tyler-Moore?). The
former has got to be a real pro to
play Edith Bunker week after
week, but then the latter has
come a long way since she
portrayed a pair of legs in "Peter
Gunn."
Supporting actor and actress in
a comedy series: Most of the
nominees are from the "Mary
Tyler Moore Show," and why
not? Edward Asner (Mr. Grant)
and Valerie Harper (Rhoda) seem
the most delightfully human.
Second Banana
Supporting performer in a
variety show: This is also known
as the second-banana award, given
to comic sidekicks. This year, one
of them has top-drawer talent; Lily
Tomlin of "Laugh-In."
Outstanding Single
Program/Classical Music: This
medium is dying but not dead.
This year we were treated to a
gala performance at the
Metropolitan Opera, honoring the
retirement of the company's
manager, Sir Rudolf Bing. If only
he could retire more
often ... don't laugh; there are
some musicians who do.
Sports programming awards:
There are several of these, and
ABC's Summer Olympic Games
coverage deserves every one.
News programming awards:
There are as many categories for
news as there are for all other
shows put together. With three
networks covering a typical
election year, very little can be
labelled outstanding; political
conventions, in particular, cause
one to wonder why TV news
exists at all.
Nevertheless, CBS News
deserves somthing for its coverage
of the Wallace shooting, and ABC
Sports for switching to hard news
during the Munich murders. For
more predictable events, NBC
News might as well carry off all
the rest, if only for giving us solid
evening news and convention

coverage without trying to look
foolish.
Not All Categories
Those are some of the Emmys
which will probably be given this
year; they, alas, don't cover all the
possible categories. Hence the
following list of Stanford Daily
TV Awards for 1973:
The Most Overrated Show of
the Year: "The Waltons." This is
"The Real McCoys" with tongue
in cheek. Liberal intellectuals,
who used to look down their
noses at the idea of "Middle
America," are now given to
praising "The Waltons" over
two-martini lunches.
If they were sincere about
what they say the show
represents, they'd all be joining
communes. Those of us who are
truly hip hated "The Waltons"
even when it was a 1961 movie
called "Spencer's Mountain."
Take away them Virginny Hills
and you're left with — Doris Day.
The Stolen Idea of The Year:

"Kung Fu." TV shows are
expected to steal material from
each other, but the entire premise
for this one appeared some seven
years ago in MAD magazine.
In its satire on "The Flying

Nun," MAD offered some
predicitons of future shows with a
"religious" gimmick. One of them
was called "Frontier Buddhist,"
and MAD, in its wisdom
recommended that Jerry Van
Dyke be cast, a proposition that
might have proven more
fascinating than David Carradine.
Bad Taste
The Bad Taste Award: To
Walter Cronkite and the CBS
Evening News team. One evening,
that show closed by running the
opening titles of CBS's own "All
in the Family" on the screen

while Uncle Walter informed us
simply that a murder had
occurred on the very street where
the sequence had been shot. End
of story — "And that's the way it
is... "

Since no details of the murder
were given, the only conclusion to
be drawn is that Walter & Co.
were exploiting an unimportant
news item for its own purposes.
That's right, plugsville. Come to
think of it, CBS News deserves a
dozen Bad Taste Awards for its
use of a teletype soundtrack
during Cronkite's show and for all
the other gimmicks that give it a
"Big Brother" aura.
The trouble with Cronkite is
that he's been made into a symbol
of authority — "The Ministry of
Truth," as Orwell would say.

Chancellor, Reasoner and Smith
have, at the very least, humility.
The Most Boring Show of the
Year: "An American Family."
This travesty has replaced "All in
the Family" as the primary
subject of cocktail chatter. It
figures. Both shows cater to the
same voyeuristic tastes and are
equally unreal.
Those sickies who tuned in
faithfully to hear Archie's latest
ethnic slur last year were more
recently tuning in to watch
ex-Stanford Dolly Pat Loud fidget
and to watch Lance Loud mince.
The Welcome Relief Award:
To Dick Cavett, who is much
more enjoyable now that'his show
appears only one week a month.
Unfortunately, Jack Paar is much
less enjoyable, now that he's back
on the air. Paar, like everything
else in the '50s was best when he
was a distant memory. Nobody
really wants to Hue that decade
again.
