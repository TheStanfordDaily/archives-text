# Boz Scaggs, Talented Band Perform Well-Rounded' Set
## 
### DAN FORTE 
Tickets for Friday night's Boz
Scaggs/Doctor John/Stoneground
concert at Berkeley Community
Theater sold so fast that a
Saturday night show was added
on at the last minute. Saturday
night's tickets sold equally well.
The show got under way at
about 7:45 with Stoneground.
Like most warm-up bands,
Stoneground plays mostly
"music-to-jump-around-to." This
is not to say that it's bad; It all
depends on what you go to a
concert for.
Since changing its personnel
slightly, Stoneground consists of
guitar, bass, drums, piano, sax,
and three female vocalists. Gone
from the group was Sal Valentino
(formerly with the Beau
Brummels) who was largely
responsible for Stoneground's hit
single, "Passion Flower," which
the group did not do in his
absence Saturday night.
Back for Encore
The group went over fairly well
and came back for an encore, sung
by Deirdre LaPorte. Its three
female singers make the group
slightly different and more
interesting than the everyday hard
rock band; especially LaPorte.
Her voice and style defy
description, but she definitely has
a nostalgic sort of quality in
everything she does. She is one of
the most captivating people I've
ever seen on stage.
I'm not, and never have been, a
Doctor John fan, but ever since
hearing his first LP, "Gris Gris,"
I've always been curious about
what he'd be like in person.
"The Night Tripper" made his
entrance Saturday night wearing a
huge collection of beads, rags, and
animal hides. His face was
painted, and he was also wearing a
huge head-dress made of feathers,
flowers, and a snake skin.
In one hand he was waving a
big straw fan, and with the other
hand he threw handfuls of glitter
at the audience, giving one the
feeling of having been subjected
to some terrible curse.
Boring Music
As it turned out, the curse was
having to sit through an hour of
Doctor John's music. He first sat
down at the electric piano and
sang his new single, "I Was In The
Right Place, But It Must Have
Been The Wrong Time."
The Doctor was backed by a
guitar, bass, drums, trumpet,
tenor, and two female singers.
Doctor John Creaux played piano,
electric piano, and guitar. Except
for the horn players and Doctor
John, all of the members were
black.
With the exception of a couple
of fine boogie woogie piano

breaks, I found Doctor John's
music to be little more than
second-rate R&B, and his voice to
be bad to the point of being
irritating. It lies somewhere
between Leon Russell and
Wolfman Jack.
The one bright spot in Doctor
John's set was the background
singing. I thought his two girl
singers were all in all superior to
the three in Stoneground.
Ovation
After finishing with "Mama
Don't 'Low," Doctor John got a
big ovation and came back (more
glitter, etc.) and did "I Was In The
Right Place,. . ." once again.
Boz Scaggs has once again
changed his personnel, but once
again the result is a tight,
extremely capable unit. The
present line-up includes Rev. Ron
Stallings on tenor, alto, and flute,
Thomas Butler on bass, Joaquin
Young still on organ (all three are
black), a drummer, a guitarist, and
Boz on vocals and guitar.
The band was recording a live

LP for Columbia, and stayed on
for a total of nearly two hours,
counting the three numbers they
did for an encore.
Boz first got things going with
two fast numbers, his hit "We
Were Always Sweethearts" and
"Monkey Time." Next was the
beautiful "Painted Bells" from his
"Moments" LP.
Some of the better selections
included in Boz's well-rounded set
were: "I'm Easy;" "Runnin
Blue;" and Elvin Bishop's "Rock
Bottom," sung by Stallings, with
al great guitar solo by Boz's
guitarist, Les "Something
or other."
Easily the most outstanding
song in Scaggs' repertoire is "Loan

Me A Dime," featuring a fantastic
introduction by Young on piano,
organ, and synthesizer. Although
Scaggs is not what you'd call a
blues musician, "Loan Me A
Dime" (his own composition) is
one of the best slow blues I've
ever heard. It appears on Boz's
first album, on Atlantic.
Scaggs ended the set, after
playing for an hour and a half,
with his semi-hit "Dyna Flo." He
then came back for another three
songs, including Big Bill
Broonzey's "I Feel So Good."
Boz Scaggs' latest LP is "My
Time" on Columbia. Judging by
his performance Saturday night,
Scaggs' upcoming live LP should
be great.

In one hand he was waving a
big straw fan, and with the other
hand he threw handfuls of glitter
at the audience, giving one the
feeling of having been subjected
to some terrible curse.
Boring Music
As it turned out, the curse was
having to sit through an hour of
Doctor John's music. He first sat
down at the electric piano and
sang his new single, "I Was In The
Right Place, But It Must Have
Been The Wrong Time."
The Doctor was backed by a
guitar, bass, drums, trumpet,
tenor, and two female singers.
Doctor John Creaux played piano,
electric piano, and guitar. Except
for the horn players and Doctor
John, all of the members were
black.
With the exception of a couple
of fine boogie woogie piano

breaks, I found Doctor John's
music to be little more than
second-rate R&B, and his voice to
be bad to the point of being
irritating. It lies somewhere
between Leon Russell and
Wolfman Jack.
The one bright spot in Doctor
John's set was the background
singing. I thought his two girl
singers were all in all superior to
the three in Stoneground.
Ovation
After finishing with "Mama
Don't 'Low," Doctor John got a
big ovation and came back (more
glitter, etc.) and did "I Was In The
Right Place,. . ." once again.
Boz Scaggs has once again
changed his personnel, but once
again the result is a tight,
extremely capable unit. The
present line-up includes Rev. Ron
Stallings on tenor, alto, and flute,
Thomas Butler on bass, Joaquin
Young still on organ (all three are
black), a drummer, a guitarist, and
Boz on vocals and guitar.
The band was recording a live

LP for Columbia, and stayed on
for a total of nearly two hours,
counting the three numbers they
did for an encore.
Boz first got things going with
two fast numbers, his hit "We
Were Always Sweethearts" and
"Monkey Time." Next was the
beautiful "Painted Bells" from his
"Moments" LP.
Some of the better selections
included in Boz's well-rounded set
were: "I'm Easy;" "Runnin
Blue;" and Elvin Bishop's "Rock
Bottom," sung by Stallings, with
al great guitar solo by Boz's
guitarist, Les "Something
or other."
Easily the most outstanding
song in Scaggs' repertoire is "Loan

Me A Dime," featuring a fantastic
introduction by Young on piano,
organ, and synthesizer. Although
Scaggs is not what you'd call a
blues musician, "Loan Me A
Dime" (his own composition) is
one of the best slow blues I've
ever heard. It appears on Boz's
first album, on Atlantic.
Scaggs ended the set, after
playing for an hour and a half,
with his semi-hit "Dyna Flo." He
then came back for another three
songs, including Big Bill
Broonzey's "I Feel So Good."
Boz Scaggs' latest LP is "My
Time" on Columbia. Judging by
his performance Saturday night,
Scaggs' upcoming live LP should
be great.
Tickets for Friday night's Boz
Scaggs/Doctor John/Stoneground
concert at Berkeley Community
Theater sold so fast that a
Saturday night show was added
on at the last minute. Saturday
night's tickets sold equally well.
The show got under way at
about 7:45 with Stoneground.
Like most warm-up bands,
Stoneground plays mostly
"music-to-jump-around-to." This
is not to say that it's bad; It all
depends on what you go to a
concert for.
Since changing its personnel
slightly, Stoneground consists of
guitar, bass, drums, piano, sax,
and three female vocalists. Gone
from the group was Sal Valentino
(formerly with the Beau
Brummels) who was largely
responsible for Stoneground's hit
single, "Passion Flower," which
the group did not do in his
absence Saturday night.
Back for Encore
The group went over fairly well
and came back for an encore, sung
by Deirdre LaPorte. Its three
female singers make the group
slightly different and more
interesting than the everyday hard
rock band; especially LaPorte.
Her voice and style defy
description, but she definitely has
a nostalgic sort of quality in
everything she does. She is one of
the most captivating people I've
ever seen on stage.
I'm not, and never have been, a
Doctor John fan, but ever since
hearing his first LP, "Gris Gris,"
I've always been curious about
what he'd be like in person.
"The Night Tripper" made his
entrance Saturday night wearing a
huge collection of beads, rags, and
animal hides. His face was
painted, and he was also wearing a
huge head-dress made of feathers,
flowers, and a snake skin.
In one hand he was waving a
big straw fan, and with the other
hand he threw handfuls of glitter
at the audience, giving one the

LP for Columbia, and stayed on
for a total of nearly two hours,
counting the three numbers they
did for an encore.
Boz first got things going with
two fast numbers, his hit "We
Were Always Sweethearts" and
"Monkey Time." Next was the
beautiful "Painted Bells" from his
"Moments" LP.
Some of the better selections
included in Boz's well-rounded set
were: "I'm Easy;" "Runnin
Blue;" and Elvin Bishop's "Rock
Bottom," sung by Stallings, with
al great guitar solo by Boz's
guitarist, Les "Something
or other."
Easily the most outstanding
song in Scaggs' repertoire is "Loan

Me A Dime," featuring a fantastic
introduction by Young on piano,
organ, and synthesizer. Although
Scaggs is not what you'd call a
blues musician, "Loan Me A
Dime" (his own composition) is
one of the best slow blues I've
ever heard. It appears on Boz's
first album, on Atlantic.
Scaggs ended the set, after
playing for an hour and a half,
with his semi-hit "Dyna Flo." He
then came back for another three
songs, including Big Bill
Broonzey's "I Feel So Good."
Boz Scaggs' latest LP is "My
Time" on Columbia. Judging by
his performance Saturday night,
Scaggs' upcoming live LP should
be great.
Tickets for Friday night's Boz
Scaggs/Doctor John/Stoneground
concert at Berkeley Community
Theater sold so fast that a
Saturday night show was added
on at the last minute. Saturday
night's tickets sold equally well.
The show got under way at
about 7:45 with Stoneground.
Like most warm-up bands,
Stoneground plays mostly
"music-to-jump-around-to." This
is not to say that it's bad; It all
depends on what you go to a
concert for.
Since changing its personnel
slightly, Stoneground consists of
guitar, bass, drums, piano, sax,
and three female vocalists. Gone
from the group was Sal Valentino
(formerly with the Beau
Brummels) who was largely
responsible for Stoneground's hit
single, "Passion Flower," which
the group did not do in his
absence Saturday night.
Back for Encore
The group went over fairly well
and came back for an encore, sung
by Deirdre LaPorte. Its three
female singers make the group
slightly different and more
interesting than the everyday hard
rock band; especially LaPorte.
Her voice and style defy
description, but she definitely has
a nostalgic sort of quality in
everything she does. She is one of
the most captivating people I've
ever seen on stage.
I'm not, and never have been, a
Doctor John fan, but ever since
hearing his first LP, "Gris Gris,"
I've always been curious about
what he'd be like in person.
"The Night Tripper" made his
entrance Saturday night wearing a
huge collection of beads, rags, and
animal hides. His face was
painted, and he was also wearing a
huge head-dress made of feathers,
flowers, and a snake skin.
In one hand he was waving a
big straw fan, and with the other
hand he threw handfuls of glitter
at the audience, giving one the
feeling of having been subjected
to some terrible curse.
Boring Music
As it turned out, the curse was
having to sit through an hour of
Doctor John's music. He first sat
down at the electric piano and
sang his new single, "I Was In The
Right Place, But It Must Have
Been The Wrong Time."
The Doctor was backed by a
guitar, bass, drums, trumpet,
tenor, and two female singers.
Doctor John Creaux played piano,
electric piano, and guitar. Except
for the horn players and Doctor
John, all of the members were
black.
With the exception of a couple
of fine boogie woogie piano

breaks, I found Doctor John's
music to be little more than
second-rate R&B, and his voice to
be bad to the point of being
irritating. It lies somewhere
between Leon Russell and
Wolfman Jack.
The one bright spot in Doctor
John's set was the background
singing. I thought his two girl
singers were all in all superior to
the three in Stoneground.
Ovation
After finishing with "Mama
Don't 'Low," Doctor John got a
big ovation and came back (more
glitter, etc.) and did "I Was In The
Right Place,. . ." once again.
Boz Scaggs has once again
changed his personnel, but once
again the result is a tight,
extremely capable unit. The
present line-up includes Rev. Ron
Stallings on tenor, alto, and flute,
Thomas Butler on bass, Joaquin
Young still on organ (all three are
black), a drummer, a guitarist, and
Boz on vocals and guitar.
