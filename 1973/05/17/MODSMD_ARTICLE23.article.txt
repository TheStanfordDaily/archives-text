SEC Chairman Cook Resigns
WASHINGTON — G. Bradford Cook, under fire for
discussing an SEC suit with officials of the Nixon
re-election campaign committee, resigned yesterday as
chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Top campaign officials have been indicted in New York
on charges of interfering with the SEC suit and the
investigation that led up to it.
Cook, at 36 the youngest chairman in SEC history, said
in his letter of resignation he had done nothing improper
but had been caught in a "web of circumstance" involving
the case.
Meanwhile in New York, the senior partner of a Wall
Street brokerage firm was accused in a criminal
information yesterday of making $48,000 in illegal,
indirect contributions to Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey's
presidential primary campaign last year.
John L. Loeb, 70, of Loeb, Rhoades & Co., was
charged in papers filed in U.S. District Court with
channeling funds to 12 campaign committees through
eight persons, most of them clerical employees of his firm.
Replying to the charge, Loeb said in a statement that
there was "no intent on my part to evade the law." He
added that he was accused of "technical and unwitting
violation of a procedural provision" of the 1971 campaign
contribution law.
Senator Questions CIA 'Crimes'
WASHINGTON - Sen. John L. McClellan (D-Ark.) said
yesterday he believes the CIA was forced into breaking its
own charter and into possibly criminal acts by a series of
requests from high White House officials.
McClellan commented after a three-hour interrogation
of former CIA Director Richard Helms before the Senate
Appropriations subcommittee on intelligence activities the
Arkansas Democrat heads.
After his testimony Helms hurried from the office
building, ignoring newsmen's questions.
But McClellan said the spy agency's former head
confirmed accounts by other officials of White House
requests that the CIA involve itself in a cover-up of the
Watergate affair and in helping White House aides in the
burglary of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office.
McClellan said he will demand explanations from
former White House aides H.R. Haldeman, John
Ehrlichman and David Young.
Crew May Install Sun Shade
CAPE KENNEDY — There's still hope of launching
astronauts Sunday to install a sun shade to cool the
sweltering skylab space station, officials said yesterday.
But they admitted that some items on the $294 million
orbiting lab already have been spoiled by heat.
William C. Schneider, director of the Skylab program,

said special sensitive film has been fogged. Other sources
said about 50 percent of the medicine in the craft may
have been ruined and some of the food also affected.
Temperatures in part of the space ship have reached
190 degrees, but NASA officials say the average
temperature has stabilized at 109.5.
Schneider said the heat may also have caused some
blistering of bonding insuiation in the craft, but this "is
no problem."
The program director said engineers are studying ways
to install a canopy to shade the space station from the
sun. He said there is still hope of launching Skylab 1
astronauts Charles Conrad Jr., Dr. Joseph P. Kerwin and
Paul J. Weitz Sunday for a repair mission.
"We plan to deploy the solar sunshield as soon as
possible, on the first or second day of the mission and
then do a full 28-day mission," said Schneider. "If we get
the solar shield deployed we feel we'll be able to get the
full 28 days."
Nixon Wants Election Reform
WASHINGTON — President Nixon, citing "widespread
abuses during the presidential campaign of 1972," urged
Congress yesterday to create a bipartisan commission to
recommend sweeping federal election reforms.
In a special message, Nixon called for establishment of
a 17-member Nonpartisan Commission on Federal
Election Reform to conduct a broad post-Watergate study
and come up with specific legislative recommendations by
Dec. 1.
"The commission's mandate would be as broad as the
federal process itself," said Nixon. "Nothing would be
excluded."
While the President made no direct reference to the
Watergate scandal, he predicted many more disclosures of
1972 campaign misdeeds "will doubtless soon be made."
Terming the need for reform "essential and urgent,"
Nixon said in a companion address taped for radio
broadcast that changes are needed "that will help to
restore the faith of the American people in the integrity
of their political processes."
Among the matters Nixon suggested as areas worthy of
commission considerations were limiting a president to a
single non-renewable six-year term and electing House
members, who now serve two years, to four-year terms.
Both would require a constitutional amendment.
