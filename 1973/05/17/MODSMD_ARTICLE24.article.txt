# Student Falls From Roof
## 
### 
An apparently drunken student
early yesterday morning fell 25 feet
from a dormitory roof to the roof of
an adjacent lounge, breaking his thigh,
lacerating his face, and possibly
fracturing his jaw.
Robert J. Tovar, a sophomore,
underwent surgery at Stanford
Hospital yesterday afternoon and was
in "stable condition" in the intensive
care unit last night, according to
hospital spokesman Gary Cavalli.
Tovar fell from the three-story Casa
Zapata roof in the Stern complex at
about 3 a.m. The sound of the fall
wakened two second-floor residents,

who telephoned the Stanford Fire
Department.
When they arrived firemen had to
radio back to their station for a basket
stretcher to transport the victim. They
finally carried Tovar through a dorm
window and down to a waiting
ambulance at 3:30 a.m.
Tovar had been drinking beer alone
on the roof before he fell, according to
Stanford policemen. University
regulations supposedly bar people
from dorm roofs, but students
commonly relax or hold parties on
them.
