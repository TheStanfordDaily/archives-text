# Long Hair Cuts Barber Business
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
". . . O say, can you see my eyes if you can then
my hair's too short . .. down to where it stops by
itself: don't have to cut it cause it stops by itself."
These lyrics, from the song "Hair" and the rock
musical of the same name, symbolized the attitude
that shocked parents, dismayed teachers — and
caused a sharp decline in the barber business. Newell
Whitford, co-owner and manager of the Tresidder
Barber Shop, remembers the trend.
Four More Chairs
"We were located in the Old Union, in a small
six-chair shop until 1962," he said. "When Tresidder
opened in September 11962], we moved here [its
present location ]."
During the next three years the shop expanded,
reaching a peak of ten chairs and ten barbers in
1965. Newell, who has cut hair here for 20 years,
said that when long hair became popular, the
number of barbers had to be reduced, to match the
decline in the demand for haircuts.
Within seven years, the number of barbers
decreased from ten to four, its current level.
Whitford was confident though, when he said that
the demand for haircuts "seems to have been
leveling off over the last two years."
Short Hair Trend?
However, he has not observed an opposite trend.
"I'm often asked if short hair is coming bask in, but

I really haven't noticed," Whitford commented.
The barber shop gets an evenly distributed
cross-section, mostly of stud°nts, faculty and staff.
"I still get a few alumni that I've done over the
years, but not many," Whitford said.
He added that the shop's busiest periods were
during interviews for business and law schools and
during finals week ... the times that students have
to look their best.
Conversationalist
Most people typically think of barbers as being
conversationalists. Whitford explained the reason
for talking with the customer.
"We want to make the customer feel at ease, and
we want to create a pleasant attitude." The goal is
to have the customer "come back to your chair."
This is done, Whitford said, by selling the quality
of the haircut, but just as important, providing an
enjoyable atmosphere.
The path on the way to becoming a barber begins
at a barber college. Preparation consists of 1250
hours of school, where one is taught how to cut
hair, shave, and so forth.
A candidate must study about the muscles and
nerves he will be working with too.
Apprentice License
After completing the schooling, the applicant
takes a state board examination, which entitles
those who pass to obtain an apprentice license.

After working in this role for a year and a half, the
apprentice must take another test to become a full
barber.
The examinations are long: a 40-page written
section, an oral session and demonstration of a
certain degree of competence shown by giving
haircuts, shaves and scalp massages.
It is also possible to go one step further, and
become a hair stylist. Whitford said that becoming a
stylist takes more schooling and a different type of
training, although he said the basic skills could be
picked up through experience.
Whitford said protein is good for hair, but added
that there are other things one should use. He
claimed that an "acid-balanced shampoo" is one of
the best things for hair care.
However, few of the big companies with large
advertising campaigns provide acid-balanced
shampoos, he added, explaining that the quality of
the other shampoos is not as good for hair.
During his time here, Whitford has noticed that
people have become more and more concerned
about their hair, especially recently. He said it has
become an added responsibility of the barber to
provide information about hair care to hi«;
customers.
"It is not good to have too dry or too oily hair,"
he remarked. "Barbers can suggest methods to deal
with these and other problems."
