# Witnesses, Cameramen Line Up For Senate Watergate Hearings
## 
### 
From The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - The Senate's
televised Watergate hearings, beginning
today may shape American
government and politics for a
generation or more.
Some changes already were evident

as the cameras warmed up and
wiretappers, burglars, campaign
workers and former White House aides
lined up to testify.
Starting at 7 a.m. PDT today tht
Select Committee on Presidential
Campaign Activities will begin by

reconstructing the bungled burglary of
last June.
Channels 4, 5 and 7 will telecast the
hearings beginning at 7 a.m., but only
Channel 5 will carry the hearings until
their conclusion at 1 p.m. PDT.
Today's hearings will also be broadcast
on KZSU (90.1 FM) beginning at 7
a.m.
In other news, Stanford Trustee
Warren M. Christopher, a Los Angeles
lawyer and former deputy U.S.
attorney general, was reported
yesterday to have asked that he not be
considered as special prosecutor in the
Watergate case.
He met during the day with Atty.
Gen.-designate Elliot L. Richardson
then returned to California.
Christopher was one of four on "a
list of finalists" that Richardson said
he had drawn up from about 100
names suggested to him for
appointment.
Judge Harold R. Tyler Jr., of the
U.S. District Court in New York City,

to whom Richardson offered the post
first, declined Tuesday. He said he was
"reluctant to resign as an active
judge," as he would have been
required to do.
The other two on the list are David
W. Peck, a Wall Street lawyer and
former New York State jurist, and
William H. Erickson, a Colorado
Supreme Court justice.
Dean Blamed
Meanwhile the White House blamed
its faulty in-house investigation of the
Watergate scandal on banished counsel
John W. Dean 111 yesterday as the
Senate prepared to open its public
hearings into the muddied affair.
"There was a certain inadequacy to
the materials provided" by Dean who
had been assigned responsibility for
the probe, Press Secretary Ronald L.
Ziegler said.
Dean, who is expected to be a star
witness in the televised Senate
hearings, said last week there was a
concerted effort to "get" him, limit
his testimony and to discredit him
personally in the hope of "discrediting
my testimony."
Widespread Wiretapping
A White House spokesman
acknowledged that longtime

wiretapping of more than a dozen
National Security Council and
Pentagon aides was personally
approved by the President because "it
was a national security matter."
The persons whose phones were
tapped were not identified, but The
New York Times said they included
Henry Kissinger aides Daniel I.
Davidson, Anthony Lake, and Winston
Lord.
Ehrlichman Had Records
The Washington Post quoted high
administration sources as saying that
former White House deputy John D.
Ehrlichman had the health records of
Sen. Thomas F. Eagleton (D-Mo.)
several weeks before information

about the Democratic vice-presidential
candidate was leaked to the news
media.
The Post said in its Wednesday
editions it could not be determined
how Ehrlichman got the records,
which described the nervous condition
and shock treatment that led to
Eagleton's withdrawal from the
campaign.
The paper reported that former
Atty. Gen. Ramsey Clark has said
Eagleton's health records were in FBI
files and material from the files was
provided to White House and Nixon
campaign aides by former Assistant
Atty. Gen. Robert C. Mardian.

campaign aides by former Assistant
Atty. Gen. Robert C. Mardian.
From The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - The Senate's
televised Watergate hearings, beginning
today may shape American
government and politics for a
generation or more.
Some changes already were evident

as the cameras warmed up and
wiretappers, burglars, campaign
workers and former White House aides
lined up to testify.
Starting at 7 a.m. PDT today tht
Select Committee on Presidential
Campaign Activities will begin by

reconstructing the bungled burglary of
last June.
Channels 4, 5 and 7 will telecast the
hearings beginning at 7 a.m., but only
Channel 5 will carry the hearings until
their conclusion at 1 p.m. PDT.
Today's hearings will also be broadcast
on KZSU (90.1 FM) beginning at 7
a.m.
In other news, Stanford Trustee
Warren M. Christopher, a Los Angeles
lawyer and former deputy U.S.
attorney general, was reported
yesterday to have asked that he not be
considered as special prosecutor in the
Watergate case.
He met during the day with Atty.
Gen.-designate Elliot L. Richardson
then returned to California.
Christopher was one of four on "a
list of finalists" that Richardson said
he had drawn up from about 100
names suggested to him for
appointment.
Judge Harold R. Tyler Jr., of the
U.S. District Court in New York City,

to whom Richardson offered the post
first, declined Tuesday. He said he was
"reluctant to resign as an active
judge," as he would have been
required to do.
The other two on the list are David
W. Peck, a Wall Street lawyer and
former New York State jurist, and
William H. Erickson, a Colorado
Supreme Court justice.
Dean Blamed
Meanwhile the White House blamed
its faulty in-house investigation of the
Watergate scandal on banished counsel
John W. Dean 111 yesterday as the
Senate prepared to open its public
hearings into the muddied affair.
"There was a certain inadequacy to
the materials provided" by Dean who
had been assigned responsibility for
the probe, Press Secretary Ronald L.
Ziegler said.
Dean, who is expected to be a star
witness in the televised Senate
hearings, said last week there was a
concerted effort to "get" him, limit
his testimony and to discredit him
personally in the hope of "discrediting
my testimony."
Widespread Wiretapping
A White House spokesman
acknowledged that longtime

wiretapping of more than a dozen
National Security Council and
Pentagon aides was personally
approved by the President because "it
was a national security matter."
The persons whose phones were
tapped were not identified, but The
New York Times said they included
Henry Kissinger aides Daniel I.
Davidson, Anthony Lake, and Winston
Lord.
Ehrlichman Had Records
The Washington Post quoted high
administration sources as saying that
former White House deputy John D.
Ehrlichman had the health records of
Sen. Thomas F. Eagleton (D-Mo.)
several weeks before information

about the Democratic vice-presidential
candidate was leaked to the news
media.
The Post said in its Wednesday
editions it could not be determined
how Ehrlichman got the records,
which described the nervous condition
and shock treatment that led to
Eagleton's withdrawal from the
campaign.
The paper reported that former
Atty. Gen. Ramsey Clark has said
Eagleton's health records were in FBI
files and material from the files was
provided to White House and Nixon
campaign aides by former Assistant
Atty. Gen. Robert C. Mardian.
