# Magee Trial Shifts To San Jose; Reasons Behind Choice Unclear
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
The Ruchell Magee kidnaping trial
will almost certainly be held in the
same high-security San Jose courtroom
where Angela Davis was tried last year.
Santa Clara County Undersheriff
Tom Rosa said yesterday that "there
was no discussion about having it at
North County" Courthouse in Palo
Alto.
The trial was assigned to Santa
Clara County Tuesday on a change of
venue from San Francisco.

When Davis' trial was moved to
Santa Clara County late in 1971,
consideration was given to holding it
in Palo Alto.
Stanford Fear
One of the factors which motivated
the eventual decision to try Davis in
San Jose was Stanford administrators'
fear that holding the trial in Palo Alto
might lead to campus unrest by Davis'
supporters.
Magee is charged with taking part in
the bloody Marin County Court House
gun battle in San Rafael on Aug. 7,
1970, in which four people including a
judge were killed.
He was tried in San Francisco
earlier this year on kidnap and murder
charges, but that trial ended in a hung

jury. The murder charge was dropped
and the trial venue changed for his
forthcoming retrial.
Davis, accused in the same incident,
was aquitted of all charges last June.
No Stanford Contact
University administrators stated
yesterday that they had not been in
contact with county officials regarding
the location of the Magee trial.
James Siena, legal adviser to
President Lyman, said "the first I
knew of the change of venue was
reading it in the newspaper." He knew
of no contact between University and
county officials and doubted that
there had been any.
"The situation is different from the

Angela Davis trial," Siena explained.
"The case is much less controversial.
The climate on the campus is quite
different now from what we thought it
might be at the time of the Davis trial.
"The Davis trial was close to San
Jose State and that was the source of
no problems as far as I know,"he
noted.
Marvin Herrington, Director of
Police Services, also said he knew of
the venue change only through the
newspaper and anticipated that the
trial would be held in San Jose. Other
officials made similar comments.
Rosa confirmed yesterday that the
Sheriff's office has about 50 vacancies
in a force of 500 deputies, and that
the department is under a
court-ordered hiring freeze until it can
develop 44c u 11 ure-f air, "
non-discriminatory employment
examinations.
He said the Magee trial "would
certainly put a strain on our resources.
The shortage [of deputies] has done
that already and this isn't going to
help any."
He anticipated that new
examinations would be developed and
that the department would be able to
resume hiring "long before the trial is
over" but doubted that outside
assistance would be required to
provide security at the trial.
"We plan to start with the same
security setup we used with the Davis
trial. Certainly there will be no stricter
security. We may modify it as the trial
goes on," Rosa added.
He also noted that "from Magee's
previous trial, it doesn't appear that
there will be the same interest as for
the Angela Davis trial".
