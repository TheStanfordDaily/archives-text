# Kissinger & Foreign Policy
## Metternich Or Wilson? 
### 
ißill Evers

Henry Kissinger has, it seems,
rejected the ideology preached by
Woodrow Wilson. Instead,
pragmatic realism is going to
govern American foreign policy in
years ahead. There will be a return
to the balance-of-power doctrines
of Metternich and Bismarck.
Yet this prognosis leaves
several unanswered questions.
Most importantly, will the new
realism be able to enlist the
enthusiasm of the American
public? Although foreign policy in
a democracy is made by an
oligarchic elite just as it was in
nineteenth-century Austria, still a
democratic regime needs at least
acquiescence in its policies, and in
time of crisis it needs enthusiastic
support.
Will American elite
decision-makers or the American
public embrace the new Kissinger
model for the long run? It appears
unlikely. Wilsonian ideology has
been the accepted basis of
American foreign policy across
the political spectrum from Henry
Wallace on the left to Ayn Rand
on the right, with George
McGovern, McGeorge Bundy, and
John Foster Dulles in between.
All of these figures share a broad
agreement with the Wilsonian
approach.
Expansion and Prosperity
The ideology of Wilsonian
diplomacy is summarized well by
Martin J. Sklar: "As an early
adherent of [historian Frederick
Jackson] Turner's frontier thesis,
Wilson defined the nation's
natural political-economic
development and its prosperity as
a function of westward expansion.
"With the end of the
continental frontier, expansion
into world markets with the
nation's surplus manufactured
goods and capital was, in his view,
indispensible to the stability and
prosperity of the economy.
"It was also no more than a
natural development in the life of
any industrial nation, and, to him,
in no way morally invidious,
since, in his view, the nation's
economic expansion was a
civilizing force that carried with it
principles of democracy and
Christianity as well as bonds of
international understanding and
peace."
This glorious Wilsonian project
to extend American political

culture, "to make the world safe
for democracy," lends itself well
to propaganda capable of stirring
the enthusiasm and commitment
of a mass society. It is, in the
phrase of Samuel F. Wells, Jr., a
"secular evangelism of American
political economy."
But the maneuvers and shifts
of international politics aimed
primarily at maintaining a balance
of power have no such appeal.
As a result, either domestic
support will erode for foreign
policy designed to uphold
American global hegemony, or
American decision-makers will
have to return to Wilson,
discarding pragmatic realism.
'National Interest'
With the possibility in mind of
a future move from Kissinger's
realism back to Wilsonian
moralism, we might do well to
consider whether Kissinger
himself has really been able to
escape Wilson's legacy.
On the one hand, one must
acknowledge the influence of
realism upon Nixon's State of the
World messages and Kissinger's
press briefings, as well as the
Administration's willingness to aid
China in the Sino-Soviet dispute.
Yet Kissinger's realism, like all
other Machtpolitik doctrines, rests
on some concept of the "national
interest." The "national interest"
is a phrase that is ambiguous in
itself, but it is the Wilsonians who
for decades have been infusing the
formulation "national interest"
with their own programmatic
content. This is a heritage which
Kissinger cannot escape simply
through pragmatism.
Transitional Device
Some analysts see the
pragmatic realist Kissinger as only
an expert technician brought in to
solve a difficult problem for the
makers of American foreign
policy, namely, the Indochina
problem.
Historian Gabriel Kolko
believes that "the so-called new
diplomacy is pre-eminently but a
transitional device to attempt to
win the Indochina war
diplomatically with the
co-operation of the U.S.S.R. and
China, after which it will be
discarded on behalf of the more
traditional, conflict-prone

assumptions of postwar American
policy."
I think, however, that Kolko
finds more continuity between
Nixon and his predecessors than is
actually there. Kissinger's
approach to foreign policy is a
genuine departure in many ways
from the Wilsonian past. But new
revolutions, trouble with Japan,
lack of domestic enthusiasm for
foreign policy, or something else
might well provoke a return to
Wilsonian moralism — making
Kissinger's realism a mere brief
interlude.

Woodrow Wilson. Instead,
pragmatic realism is going to
govern American foreign policy in
years ahead. There will be a return
to the balance-of-power doctrines
of Metternich and Bismarck.
Yet this prognosis leaves
several unanswered questions.
Most importantly, will the new
realism be able to enlist the
enthusiasm of the American
public? Although foreign policy in
a democracy is made by an
oligarchic elite just as it was in
nineteenth-century Austria, still a
democratic regime needs at least
acquiescence in its policies, and in
time of crisis it needs enthusiastic
support.
Will American elite
decision-makers or the American
public embrace the new Kissinger
model for the long run? It appears
unlikely. Wilsonian ideology has
been the accepted basis of
American foreign policy across
the political spectrum from Henry
Wallace on the left to Ayn Rand
on the right, with George
McGovern, McGeorge Bundy, and
John Foster Dulles in between.
All of these figures share a broad
agreement with the Wilsonian
approach.
Expansion and Prosperity
The ideology of Wilsonian
diplomacy is summarized well by
Martin J. Sklar: "As an early
adherent of [historian Frederick
Jackson] Turner's frontier thesis,
Wilson defined the nation's
natural political-economic
development and its prosperity as
a function of westward expansion.
"With the end of the
continental frontier, expansion
into world markets with the
nation's surplus manufactured
goods and capital was, in his view,
indispensible to the stability and
prosperity of the economy.
"It was also no more than a
natural development in the life of
any industrial nation, and, to him,
in no way morally invidious,
since, in his view, the nation's
economic expansion was a
civilizing force that carried with it
principles of democracy and
Christianity as well as bonds of
international understanding and
peace."
This glorious Wilsonian project
to extend American political

culture, "to make the world safe
for democracy," lends itself well
to propaganda capable of stirring
the enthusiasm and commitment
of a mass society. It is, in the
phrase of Samuel F. Wells, Jr., a
"secular evangelism of American
political economy."
But the maneuvers and shifts
of international politics aimed
primarily at maintaining a balance
of power have no such appeal.
As a result, either domestic
support will erode for foreign
policy designed to uphold
American global hegemony, or
American decision-makers will
have to return to Wilson,
discarding pragmatic realism.
'National Interest'
With the possibility in mind of
a future move from Kissinger's
realism back to Wilsonian
moralism, we might do well to
consider whether Kissinger
himself has really been able to
escape Wilson's legacy.
On the one hand, one must
acknowledge the influence of
realism upon Nixon's State of the
World messages and Kissinger's
press briefings, as well as the
Administration's willingness to aid
China in the Sino-Soviet dispute.
Yet Kissinger's realism, like all
other Machtpolitik doctrines, rests
on some concept of the "national
interest." The "national interest"
is a phrase that is ambiguous in
itself, but it is the Wilsonians who
for decades have been infusing the
formulation "national interest"
with their own programmatic
content. This is a heritage which
Kissinger cannot escape simply
through pragmatism.
Transitional Device
Some analysts see the
pragmatic realist Kissinger as only
an expert technician brought in to
solve a difficult problem for the
makers of American foreign
policy, namely, the Indochina
problem.
Historian Gabriel Kolko
believes that "the so-called new
diplomacy is pre-eminently but a
transitional device to attempt to
win the Indochina war
diplomatically with the
co-operation of the U.S.S.R. and
China, after which it will be
discarded on behalf of the more
traditional, conflict-prone

assumptions of postwar American
policy."
I think, however, that Kolko
finds more continuity between
Nixon and his predecessors than is
actually there. Kissinger's
approach to foreign policy is a
genuine departure in many ways
from the Wilsonian past. But new
revolutions, trouble with Japan,
lack of domestic enthusiasm for
foreign policy, or something else
might well provoke a return to
Wilsonian moralism — making
Kissinger's realism a mere brief
interlude.
