# Registration 'Unwarranted'
## The 						Great Bicycle Menace 
### 
P. A. Trout

They said it couldn't happen here. Not even the worst left-crazy
nay-sayers figured it would come before 1984, which they settled on
for literary elegance as much as anything else. But they were all
deluded, all of them; despite the now seemingly unmistakeable signs
of encroaching fascism — the systematic stifling of domestic
radicalism, the extension of police power, the repression of the press
— few were alert enough to stem the tide.
Bicycle registration!
Yesterday the Santa Clara County Sheriff's department began
issuing citations to unlicensed bicycles. If the offending velocipedes'
owners fail to hustle down to their local police outpost, fork over a

dollar, and register their machines, in one week they will live in
imminent danger of being deprived of transportation.
Midnight Knock
I do not exaggerate. In one week, otherwise harmless cyclists may
expect the close scrutiny of the police, the sudden disappearance of a
loved one, the midnight knock on the door.
In other words, their bicycles will be summarily impounded.
Snatched, purloined, lifted ... by the very forces of law and order
upon whom we rely for protection from this sort of thing.
This strikes me as a small outrage. And since, like most students, I
insist upon remaining unaffected by large outrages (Watergate,
Cambodia, farm-workers, American Indians; there is still a formidable
list), I must equally insist on the right to fulminate on small, but
personal, ones.
State Power
The arguments against this unwarranted extension of state power
into the personal lives of citizens are legion and well-known. The
general principles have been amply publicized by the opponents of
gun-control legislation; and, if only bicycles killed people and were
protected by the Constitution, there might be a clever analogy there.
But it is an interesting question: why should bicycle registration,
presumably for the benefit of the cyclist and no one else, be
compulsory?
Why, if I consider a dollar too high a price for little security (very
little: police admit they only recover 25 percent of all stolen bicycles,
including registered ones), or if I resent the inconvenience of
registering, or if I simply don't care as to whether some scoundrel
absconds with my velo, should I be placed under imminent threat of
official rapine?
Tubular Rights
Why should I be forced to even enter a police station, where I may
be apprehended for past parking tickets or present intoxication? Why
am I required to pay a dollar of my dwindling (albeit inflationary)
grocery money towards the maintenance of this apparatus of
repression?
Why must I submit my name, address, and vital statistics along
with those of my bicycle? Consider the frightening implications: when
every citizen is readily identifiable by the bicycle he rides, our
cherished rights won't be worth a tube full of holes.
Now, gentle reader, don't get me wrong. I'm no libertarian: none
of this troglodytic, property-rights laissez-faire stuff for me (except on
this, and maybe a couple of other issues). But bicycle registration
strikes to the very center of my life-style, such as it is: at the heart of
the counter-culture, the very fulcrum of the uneasy balance of student
life.
Hence I feel compelled to announce the formation of a new,
broadly-based student movement: the Free People's Free Bicycle
Brigade. If this doesn't stir up a little trouble on this all-too-quiescent
campus, nothing will.
Bicycle-riders, unite: you have nothing to lose but your chains.
Remember that Czechs presumably registered their bicycles. And
assure everyone you meet that when bicycles are outlawed, only the
few of us who resisted will have bicycles.
