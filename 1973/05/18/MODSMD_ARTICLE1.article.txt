# Class Sign-Up Period To Replace Advance Registration For Fall
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
A class list sign-up period from May
22 to June 5 will replace advance
registration for autumn quarter,
Acting Registrar Robert Houghton
announced Wednesday.
However, advance registration for
winter and spring quarters will
continue next year.
Students who wish to enroll in
autumn courses requiring advance
sign ups may obtain autumn program
cards in the Registrar's Office
beginning Monday. Class lists will be
available in Old Union, or at the
various departments.
The autumn program card is not an
official study list. Students will receive
study list forms as part of the Permit

To Register (PTR) during autumn
registration, Sept. 24-25.
The program cards do not require
advisor's signatures and should be used
only by students who need to sign
advance class lists, the registrar advises.
The schedule for class list sign-ups will
appear in the Time Schedule, which
should be available soon.
Popular Advance Registration
Advance registration was initiated
during winter quarter 1972, when
students preregistered for the
upcoming spring. Two-thirds of the
12,000-member student body took
advantage of the advance registration
option, and advance registration for
spring and winter quarters this year
elicited a similarly enthusiastic

student response.
In a recent memo to Provost
William Miller, Houghton outlined the
advantages of advance registration as
— slowing down the hurried
registration process,
— enabling students to return to
campus after registration day by
allowing them to pay tuition and fees,
and register for classes in advance,
— reducing "the pressure of having
all students in a confined area —
helpful when there are signs or
possibilities of demonstrations,"
— relieving the workload of all
university offices involved in the
registration process,
— taking the first step toward the
registrar's long-range goal of
registration by mail, and
— allowing the University to receive
financial benefit from early tuition
payments.
Poor Turnout
But last year's spring advance
registration for fall quarter of this year
was not so successful, from the
University's viewpoint. Only about
one-third of all students initiated
advance registration, and a scant
one-fourth of the student body had
actually completed advance
registration by autumn quarter
registration day.
Students who changed their minds
during the summer about what courses
they would take in the fall
complicated the process by returning

on registration day last fall and signing
different class lists. Others, who had
already completed tuition payment
and class signups, returned on
registration day to obtain ID card
validations and football season tickets.
"We were going to the Rose Bowl,
you know," recalls Houghton.
But other difficulties originate with
the University. Explains Houghton,
"What is different about advance
registration for autumn quarter is that
the fee payment or commitment part
of advance registration was not
feasible in spring quarter."
Administrative Problems
Students cannot pay room and
board bills for the autumn in the
spring because housing assignments are
not finalized until August. "Housing
information printed on PTR's now
would be only partially correct by
fall," reports David Garvin of the
Housing Office.
Last year, the University attempted
to surmount the delay in processing
housing assignments by mailing bills to
advanced-registered students in
August. Because special envelopes
were needed to mail the PTR's and
because many students were unable to
return payments within a two-week
deadline period, the procedure was
"highly inefficient," according to
Houghton.
"The cost in personnel effort,
dollars and relations between offices
was appalling " he claims.

OUT OF THE TREES — Last weekend's Spring Festival attracted large crowds
to White Plaza, recalling earlier, less peaceful, vernal gatherings on campus.
Perhaps the warm weather is responsible for the cooling of the campus.
