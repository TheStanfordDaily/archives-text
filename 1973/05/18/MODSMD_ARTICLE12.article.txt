# Symbolic Importance
## Tree Planting Festival Coming 
### 
[Ann Malmuth

The Stanford community is
cordially invited to the arboretum
on campus on Sunday May 20th
for a tree planting festival. This
happening is sponsored by Jewish
Students of Stanford in
conjunction with Stanford Plant
Services and the Stanford
Conservation Club.
The University has provided us
with hundreds of trees to plant as
part of the campus-wide
community volunteer clean-up
program. Live Oak trees will be
planted to enhance the garden-like

atmosphere of this beautiful
section of campus. This day of
celebration will take place at the
northeast corner of the
intersection of Campus Drive and
Palm Drive. Soft drinks will be
provided and people are welcome
to wander about.
For those of us in the
community who would like to
participate in a unique ceremony,
we will be holding services for a
tree planting festival on Lag
B'Omer once an hour on the hour,
starting 10 a.m. and ending 6 p.m.
They were developed at the
Brandeis Institute in Southern
California by Norman Corwin and
Dore Schary. It is a meaningful
yet short service of 15 minutes. It
begins in this way:
Festival Day
"We are gathered here today
under the canopy of God's sky to
celebrate Lag B'Omer, the 33rd
day since Passover. This day is a
nature festival. In Israel, two
months before Passover, and in
other sections of the world where
conditions permit, another day is
celebrated — the New Year Day of
Trees. This holiday is called Tu
B'Shvat, the 15th day of the
month of Shvat.
"These two days remind us

once again that basic in Jewish
tradition and lore is the love and
appreciation of God's blessing
here on earth. Deep in the soul of
our people is the love of all living
things and admiration for the
wonders of the earth. It is some of
these wonders which we
contemplate today, and it is some
of these living things for which we
thank God today.
"All of us are participating in a
holy function, in a sacred
obligation. We are placing into the
earth something of life. We are
restoring to the earth something
that will flourish and grow.
Give and Take
"In our lifetime, all of us
consume trees and the products
that come from trees: wood, with
which we build our homes, our
furniture, some of our boats and
wagons; paper, on which we write;
syrup, which we use for food;
flowers and leaves to cheer our
spirits and decorate our lives;
fruits and nuts, which sustain us.
And there is, too, the simply
living beauty of a tree which
gladens us and makes the earth a
garden.
"Yes, during our lives we take
from the earth and it is right that
we replace into the earth that

which we have used. By planting
trees that may one day serve
generations unborn, we are
functioning as God wants us to
function.
"This day of Lag B'Omar was
chosen for still other reasons.
Years ago during the days of
oppressive Roman rule, the
famous teacher, Rabbi Akiba,
defied the Romans by founding a
school.
Special Rejoicing
"During a plague, many of
Rabbi Akiba's students were
struck down. The plague abated
on the 33rd day of Omar, so this
day was marked for special
rejoicing.
"Also, at that time, it was
forbidden to study Jewish law and
teachers, under threat of death,
were forbidden to teach. But since
it was permitted to gather in fields
and woods to hunt, the students
used the device of pretending to
hunt in order to meet and study
together the word of God in the
open spaces of God's world.
"We therefore also note and
consider on Lag B'Omer the
courage and persistence of these
men."

with hundreds of trees to plant as

They were developed at the

begins in this way:
Festival Day
"We are gathered here today
under the canopy of God's sky to
celebrate Lag B'Omer, the 33rd
day since Passover. This day is a
nature festival. In Israel, two
months before Passover, and in
other sections of the world where
conditions permit, another day is
celebrated — the New Year Day of
Trees. This holiday is called Tu
B'Shvat, the 15th day of the
month of Shvat.
"These two days remind us

once again that basic in Jewish
tradition and lore is the love and
appreciation of God's blessing
here on earth. Deep in the soul of
our people is the love of all living
things and admiration for the
wonders of the earth. It is some of
these wonders which we
contemplate today, and it is some
of these living things for which we
thank God today.
"All of us are participating in a
holy function, in a sacred
obligation. We are placing into the
earth something of life. We are
restoring to the earth something
that will flourish and grow.
Give and Take
"In our lifetime, all of us
consume trees and the products
that come from trees: wood, with
which we build our homes, our
furniture, some of our boats and
wagons; paper, on which we write;
syrup, which we use for food;
flowers and leaves to cheer our
spirits and decorate our lives;
fruits and nuts, which sustain us.
And there is, too, the simply
living beauty of a tree which
gladens us and makes the earth a
garden.
"Yes, during our lives we take
from the earth and it is right that
we replace into the earth that

which we have used. By planting
trees that may one day serve
generations unborn, we are
functioning as God wants us to
function.
"This day of Lag B'Omar was
chosen for still other reasons.
Years ago during the days of
oppressive Roman rule, the
famous teacher, Rabbi Akiba,
defied the Romans by founding a
school.
Special Rejoicing
"During a plague, many of
Rabbi Akiba's students were
struck down. The plague abated
on the 33rd day of Omar, so this
day was marked for special
rejoicing.
"Also, at that time, it was
forbidden to study Jewish law and
teachers, under threat of death,
were forbidden to teach. But since
it was permitted to gather in fields
and woods to hunt, the students
used the device of pretending to
hunt in order to meet and study
together the word of God in the
open spaces of God's world.
"We therefore also note and
consider on Lag B'Omer the
courage and persistence of these
men."
