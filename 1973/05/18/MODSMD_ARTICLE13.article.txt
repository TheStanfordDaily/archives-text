Traffic Hints
Editor:
Under the title "Student
Transportation Study Urges Halt
to Subsidizing of Campus Autos,"
which appeared in Monday's
Daily, it was reported that a
SWOPSI report recommends a
vehicle registration fee of from $4
to $20.
This assessment would be,
reportedly, for the purpose of
obtaining revenues, making
"motor vehicles pay their own
way," and alleviation of the
parking problem.
A registration fee would gain
revenues, and make motor
vehicles pay their own way
(faculty and staff drivers already
provide a service â€” their labor)
but the so called parking problem
is a lot of hogwash produced by
people too lazy to walk a few
steps.
I have a few suggestions:
First: I suggest that those who
are constantly screaming that
there are no parking spaces, take a
look at the lots south of the old
pavilion and adjacent to Wilbur
Hall on Campus drive. At any
time of the day, these lots have
row upon row of empty parking
spaces. Both of these lots are
within 6 minutes (by my stop
watch) walking time of the quad.
Second: No one living on
campus should have to use his car
unless handicapped, or for
emergencies and recreation in the
evenings and on weekends.
Bicycles or walking are excellent
transportation and exercise, and
there is no place on campus that
cannot be reached from any other
location within 15 or 20 minutes
walking time.
Third: All parking areas should
be haunted by the security force,
and citations issued to all illegally
parked vehicles.
Fourth: There should be a
rearrangement of the "Staff" and
"Reserved" parking areas which
would create more staff and less
reserved spaces.
Fifth: During certain periods
of the day when parking spaces
are hard to find around the inner
campus area, traffic could be

routed to less congested parking
areas.
The idea of a registration fee
should not be entertained until all
other possible solutions have been
thoroughly investigated; they
obviously have not been.
Off campus staff and faculty
should not have to pay a fee in
order to park their cars.

During a recent flight of what I
will call "overt altruism," a trait
so infrequently observed in these
most selfish times, yet woven so
deeply into the very fibre of this
missive, I came upon a product of
the fourth estate which had
come not just from your journal,
but from the opinion page.
While removing several sheets
of newsprint from the bottom of
the care of a Toucan temporarily
in residence in my apartment,
your Mr. Coleman's article caught
my eye. Actually it was not Mr.
Coleman's article which caught
my eye at all but a rather large
mauve indiscretion the bird had
committed the previous evening
upon Mr. Coleman's article.
Having had my attention tweaked
as it were, I quickly perused those
portions of the article still

unobscured by the slowly
spreading mass.
Let me say at this time that I
cannot be too glowing! Mr.
Coleman's grasp of the intangible
aesthetic is exceeded only by his
subtle treatment of one's
sensibilities. His humor melded
with his creative imagination are
for me the only true cathartic and
never fail to produce total
abreaction. In short, Mr. Coleman
produces, as does the
aforementioned Toucan,. good
shit.

Correction
Editor:
In reference to Tuesday's
article about the Stanford Student
Firemen, the following statement
was misleading: "Except for
flagrant violations, the rules are
not strictly enforced."
All violations of the rules of
conduct pertaining to Student
Firemen result in disciplinary
action. These rules are enforced
by the Captains in order to insure
the maximum response of the
Stanford Fire Department in its
responsibilities to the Stanford
Community.
