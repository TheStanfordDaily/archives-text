Do you ever get the feeling that you're paying more for your milk
and enjoying it less? Well in fact you may actually be getting less for
your milk dollar than you think you are. Reporter Larry Werner
reported on the case of the shrinking milk jugs in a recent issue of The
Louisville Courier-Journal.
"Plastic gallon milk containers are being adopted by dairies and
touted for their convenience, but James Oslin, supervisor of the
Louisville Division of Weights and Measures, has discovered that the
jugs have one drawback that could cost consumers money. They
shrink.
"The discovery resulted from an investigation conducted by Oslin
recently after he received several compalints from consumers who
claimed that there weren't full gallons of milk in their plastic gallon
milk containers.
"When he visited several Louisville milk plants to check the
complaints, Oslin found that some of the gallons were not gallons at
all, but were as much as 5 percent short of containing the proper
amount of milk.
"According to Oslin, the plastic containers shrink if they sit for
more than 24 hours after they are molded, and the short-measured
gallons were the result of the milk plants allowing the jugs to sit
before filling them.
"Oslin said he didn't issue citations to the milk plants found with
short-measured gallons, but warned them they could be subject to
legal action if they are caught again."
"Bait and Switch" is a common illegal advertising practice which is
used to defraud innumerable consumers every day. In an effort to help
consumers combat this practice, the California Department of
Consumer Affairs recently released a detailed description of the
practice.
According to the Department, here is basically what happens in a
"Bait and Switch" situation: A company or store will place an ad for
an item at an extremely low price, but when a consumer attempts to
purchase the advertised merchandise, he is "switched" to another
product which is more expensive. Consumers are lured into the store
by the promise of large savings and then they discover that the
salesman is determined to "switch" them to a much higher priced
item.
The Department of Consumer Affairs warns consumers who feel
they are being "switched" to leave the store and to report the store to
the Department. Don't be pressured into buying. Don't hesitate to say

The California Department of Consumer Affairs recently held
hearings on the need for open code-dating of food products. Witnesses
from government, industry and consumer groups testified at the
hearings, which were designed in part to help the Department decide
if it should sponsor legislation requiring open code-dating.
Among the issues raised at the hearings were the problems of
differing regulations among states, means of enforcement and the
possibility of an anti-competititve effect if small industries were
forced out of business or forced to raise prices in order to comply
with regulations.
One major problem is deciding which date to require. Among the
possibilities are the manufacturer date — the date the product was
manufactured; the pack date — the date the product was packaged for
retail sale; the pull date — the recommended last date for retail sale
with allowance for reasonable time for home storage before use; the
freshness date — the last date the processor estimates the product will
retain original freshness or peak quality although it may be usable for
a longer period; the expiration date — the last date the product can be
expected to perform in "a manner equal to consumer expectations"
and the shelf display date — the date an item is placed by a retailer on
the shelf.
The Department of Consumer Affairs is currently reviewing the
findings of its hearing in an attempt to " discern whether open code
dating is feasible on a state level and of maximum benefit to the
consumer." John Kehoe, director of the Department has said that
*>open code dating would be a valuable asset to California consumers."
