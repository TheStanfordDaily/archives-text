# Watergate Testimony Today
## McCord Broke Silence 
### 
From The Associated Press
WASHINGTON — James McCord,
the talkative conspirator, planted
the seed of disclosure now coming
to bloom. He broke the silence
that let the Watergate story come
tumbling through.
It was an uncharacteristic act
for an unusual man, a real-life spy
whose world was secrecy and
codes and a willingness to do
anything for a cause — except
take the rap for others.
When McCord steps before the
cameras today at 7 a.m. (PDT) in
the opening phase of the Senate's
Watergate hearings, he'll be in a
spotlight that he helped focus
with a clumsily typed letter in
March.
(The hearings will be broadcast
live by TV channels 4, 5 and 7
and by KZSU — 90.1 FM, and
rebroadcast by channel 9
beginning at 8 p.m.)
Then McCord stood before a
judge prepared to impose a heavy
sentence for being caught in the
act burgling and bugging
Democratic party headquarters.
Letter to Sirica
The letter, at that time already

in Chief U.S. District Court Judge
John J. Sirica's hands, changed it
all.
"In the interests of justice,"
McCord wrote, "I will state the
following to you at this time."
And then came three terse
paragraphs of allegations:
Political Pressure
—There was political pressure
applied to the defendants in the
Watergate trial to plead guilty and
remain silent.
—Perjury occurred during the
trial.
—Others involved in the
Watergate operation were not
identified during the trial, when
they could have been by those
testifying.
Plans For Bugging
Later the same day, March 23,
McCord met with investigators for
the special Senate Watergate
committee. He talked about point
three: He'd been told that John
N. Mitchell, Jeb S. Magruder and
John V. Dean 111 planned
Watergate with G. Gordon Liddy,
his codefendant in the trial.
Another time he talked of
point one: The Committee for the
Re-election of the President
promised money; presidential
aides promised clemency in return
for stony silence.

Aid to lawyers in civil suits
McCord talked of point 2: Jeb
Magruder lied, he said.
Sensational Testimony
McCord's testimony was so
sensational it leaked out before
stenographers had a chance to
transcribe it. He talked so much
that only two days of depositions
totaled 380 pages.
He is certain to be the most
sensational of the early witnesses
in the Senate's great Caucus
Room '
What viewers will see is an
average-looking man, 49 years old,
with a somewhat reedy voice,
speaking softly.
Lawyers Unaware
Not even McCord's lawyers
were aware of his letter to
the judge. And no one outside the
now-disclosed large circle of
people in the know could foresee
how his knowledge would shake
the summit.
James McCord didn't write the
script. But the outline was his.
It is said he's writing a book —
not about his score of years in the
CIA or about his years in the FBI
or his exploits as a
doak-and-dagger man. It'll be
about Watergate.
The title: "Malice in
Blunderland."
