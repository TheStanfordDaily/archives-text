SAN JOSE (AP) - The film
"Deep Throat" was seized at a
movie theater here Wednesday,
but the manager said another reel
was flown in and the evening
show went on as scheduled before
a full house.
Police confirmed that officers
with a warrant had confiscated
the film earlier in the day.
Pussycat II manager Paula
Miranda said police told her that
if another copy of the movie was
obtained "the chances are the
same procedure would be taken."
