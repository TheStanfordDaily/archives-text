Can you tell me about the origins of the LSJUMBand's version of
the national anthem? I've heard it was Band Director Arthur Barnes'
response to JFK's assassination. Was it? Where and when was it first
played? Is it really "nationally-known?"L.A.B.
Arthur Barnes said that he arranged the national anthem which
begins with a trumpet solo, while he was at Fresno State College and
brought it with him when he came to Stanford in 1963.
According to Sports Information Director Bob Murphy, the
Barnes' arrangement of the national anthem was first played at the Big
Game on November 30, 1963. The game, originally scheduled for
Nov. 23, was postponed because of John Kennedy's assassination. As
a result, the atmosphere was highly emotional when the Stanford
Band played their new version of the national anthem for the first
time.
The arrangement was played at the Rose Bowl game against
Michigan on Jan. 1, 1972. The game was nationally televised.

Who or what is that little man on the lower left corner of those
Spring Fling posters that recently appeared? K.L.
'The Flush," created by Kai Lanz, is a take-off on "The Flash," a
comic book character.
Lanz uses "The Flush" in his satires on DC Comics.
On the posters, "The Flush" is depicted flinging a spring. .. .

Could you explain the history and representative symbolism of the
three sculptures above the main library entrance? In regard to this,
who was Edgar Walter? D. C.
The only information regarding the sculptures to be found in the
University Archives was in a booklet published by the University in
1919, entitled "New Building of the University Library: A History of
the Library 1891-1919."
"The three figures over the entrance, representing Art, Philosophy
and Science, give a certain amount of contrast to the heavy walls."
Susan Rosenberg, University Archivist, doesn't have any
information on the history of the sculptures or on an Edgar Walter.
