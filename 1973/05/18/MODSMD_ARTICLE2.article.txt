# CRP Office Manager On Stand

From The Associated Press
WASHINGTON â€” Even while he was
attorney general, John N. Mitchell was
making major decisions in President
Nixon's re-election campaign, the
Senate Watergate committee was told
yesterday at the start of its historic
hearings.
Robert C. Odle, former director of
administration at the Committee for
the Re-election of the President
(CRP), said memoranda were going
to Mitchell at the Justice Department
as far back as May 1971. Mitchelk
resigned as attorney general in March
1972 and joined the campaign as
director a month later.
Convicted Watergate burglar James
W. McCord, one-time security chief of
CRP, will testify today. His testimony
will be televised by channels 4 and 5
and broadcast by KZSU (90.1 FM)
beginning at 7 a.m. (PDT).
Odle said also that on the day five
men broke into Democratic Party
headquarters, he removed a file from
committee offices that he now believes
contained "things which have no place
in a political campaign."

The 28-year-old Odle, who is
winding up the re-election committee's
affairs, was the leadoff witness in the
hearings.
He was followed to the stand by
Bruce Kehrli, aide to former White
House chief of staff H.R. Haldeman,
who quit under fire in the Watergate
scandal on April 30.
Kehrli's testimony was restricted to
describing White House staff
organization. The senators reserved for
a later appearance by Kehrli questions
concerning his drilling open the White
House safe of Watergate conspirator E.
Howard Hunt.
Policeman Testifies
Also testifying was Sgt. Paul W.
Leeper, one of the three plainclothes
policemen who surprised five men in
the act of rifling Democratic
headquarters in the Watergate office
building in the post-midnight hours of
June 17, and arrested them.
"They were probably five of the
easiest lockups I've ever had," Leeper
said.
Odle said instruction for him to
remove the file stored in the desk of

campaign deputy Jeb S. Magruder,
came in a three-way conversation with
Magruder initiated by himself and
Robert Reisner. Magruder was in
California that day.
Magruder 'Concerned'
Magruder "was concerned about the
file because he feared for the security
of the building," Odle said. "I was
possibly concerned about retribution.
I was concerned about general
security."
There have been published reports
that the file contained summaries of
wiretaps placed in the Democratic
Committee offices in an earlier
break-in. But Odle said he didn't look
at the folder he said was about VA
inches thick.
He said it was returned to Magruder
on the Monday following the break-in.
White House Influence
Speaking in the huge Senate Caucus
Room to a special panel of seven
senators, Odle said there was no doubt
that ultimate political authority for
the campaign rested in the White
House.
"Is it fair to say that the committee

was set up, organized and directed
from the White House?" asked Sen.
Herman Talmadge (D-Ga.).
"The White House had influence,"
Odle said. "But the campaign director
was not from the White House. He
came from the Justice Department."
The comment brought laughter in the
room crowded with newsmen, other
spectators and television cameras that
carried the proceedings live on all
networks.
