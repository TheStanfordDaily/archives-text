# Mixed Reactions To New Releases
## 
### 
Diamond Girl — Seals and Crofts
Warner Bros. 852699
Seals and Crofts have had a
fairly sizeable cult following for a
long while, but it wasn't until the
single "Summer Breeze" was
released last year that they
received real mass exposure. They
chose a fine single for their AM
debut and now they have
produced an excellent new album
which should sizeably swell the
ranks of their fans.
James Seals and Dash Crofts
are two extremely talented
musicians who remind me very
much of Kenny Loggins and Jim
Messina in terms of their
versatility. Besides being
harmonious and melodious
vocalists and accomplished
guitarists, the two are equally at
home on other instruments. On
this album, Seals plays a very
good alto sax and Crofts does a
beautiful passage on the
mandolin.
"Diamond Girl" is one of those
rare albums which does not
contain a bad cut. Starting with
the title song, there is a steady
steam of enjoyable and varied
songs, which are extremely
relaxing.
This is the kind of album
which goes well with a friend, a
little wine and some candlelight.
There is one good rocker,
"Standin' On A Mountain Top"
and one great country/western
cut, "Dust On My Saddle," but
other than that it is an album full
of beautiful musical poetry.
The album is dedicated to Seals
and Crofts' wives and there is real
love in the music. "Diamond Girl"
is sincerely moving as is "Jessica,"
but perhaps "Nine Houses" has
the most beautiful lyrics of all.
The end of "Nine Houses" goes
like this:
So there's a lotta sense in livin'
When the world we know
starts givin'
And we can spread our wings
some sunny day

And fly away
But till we fly together
What sense does it make?
Definitely one of the finest
releases so far this year.

Made In Japan — Deep Purple
Warner Bros. 2W52701
Considering this is a live album,

it isn't a bad effort. There is very
little of the usual inane small talk
with the audience and the album's
sound quality is surprisingly high.
But considering that Deep Purple
has been one of the most
consistent English rock groups
over the last five years, this album
is disappointingly inconsistent.
About half of the music is in
the best Deep Purple tradition.
Jon Lord again shows why he is
considered one of the most
talented organists around and on
part of the album, he leads the
band through the kind of
high-energy, often-frantic rock
that has become their trademark.
But on the rest of the album,
there are a number of problems.
There is some needless
screaming, including vocal miming
of a guitar in the worst tradition
of Edgar Winter. A large amount
of time is wasted on an uninspired
drum solo and even some of the

better cuts are hurt considerably
when the band goes off on
unnecessary instrumental
tangents.
"Space Truckin'," which gets
off to a fine start, suffers from the
tangent problem, but it is still a
good number which fills all of side
four. "Smoke On The Water" is a
solid cut, "Highway Star" features
some of Lord's best-ever organ

work and "Strange Kind of
Woman" is also very good, despite
the Edgar Winter mime routine.
I don't think this should have
been a two record set. If some of
the songs were a bit crisper and
more concise and a few were
eliminated all together, this would
be an outstanding album. As it is,
it's a mixed bag from one of

England's finest groups.

Flo & Eddie — Flo & Eddie
Warner Bros. M 52141
Remember the Turtles who
produced a number of very similar
Top 10 hits during the 60s and
ended up playing a command
performance at the White House?

Following their White House
appearance the group quickly
slipped into oblivion. Now two of
the Turtles, Mark Volman and
Howard Kaylan, have reappeared
as Flo & Eddie.
After working for awhile with
Frank Zappa and T. Rex, Volman
and Kaylan formed this group
with a number of experienced

musicians including former
Turtles bassist Jim Pons and John
Mayall's former drummer,
Aynsley Dunbar. Enough said
about who they are, it's time to
discuss what they do.
This is one of those albums
that slides off you much like a
politician's promise. It isn't a very
bad album, nor is it a very good
one. It gets off to a good start
with "If We Only Had The Time"
and "Days," but then Flo & Eddie
start floating around from one
musical style to the next.
A number of the songs have
traces of the Turtles' style and
"Afterglow" is a blatant
paraphrase of an old Turtles song.
But the group also screws around
with an asinine song about a
matador complete with Spanish
accents and flamenco guitar style,
a Sha-Na-Na type number called
"Best Part of Breaking Up," and a
completely ridiculous parody of a
circus announcer called "The
Sanzini 8r05.," in which they talk
about a "sodomy trick," as if to
assure they will never be invited
back to Dick's house.
The group has been touring
with Alice Cooper and as you
might expect, one of the numbers
includes some passages which are
clear imitations of Alice's style.
Flo & Eddie is a group with no
real direction. I see some faint
rays of talent shining through, but
they've definitely got a long way
to go.

the most beautiful lyrics of all.
The end of "Nine Houses" goes
like this:
So there's a lotta sense in livin'
When the world we know

And we can spread our wings

And fly away
But till we fly together
What sense does it make?
Definitely one of the finest
releases so far this year.

Made In Japan — Deep Purple
Warner Bros. 2W52701
Considering this is a live album,

it isn't a bad effort. There is very
little of the usual inane small talk
with the audience and the album's
sound quality is surprisingly high.
But considering that Deep Purple
has been one of the most
consistent English rock groups
over the last five years, this album
is disappointingly inconsistent.
About half of the music is in
the best Deep Purple tradition.
Jon Lord again shows why he is
considered one of the most
talented organists around and on
part of the album, he leads the
band through the kind of
high-energy, often-frantic rock
that has become their trademark.
But on the rest of the album,
there are a number of problems.
There is some needless
screaming, including vocal miming
of a guitar in the worst tradition
of Edgar Winter. A large amount
of time is wasted on an uninspired
drum solo and even some of the

better cuts are hurt considerably
when the band goes off on
unnecessary instrumental
tangents.
"Space Truckin'," which gets
off to a fine start, suffers from the
tangent problem, but it is still a
good number which fills all of side
four. "Smoke On The Water" is a
solid cut, "Highway Star" features
some of Lord's best-ever organ

work and "Strange Kind of
Woman" is also very good, despite
the Edgar Winter mime routine.
I don't think this should have
been a two record set. If some of
the songs were a bit crisper and
more concise and a few were
eliminated all together, this would
be an outstanding album. As it is,
it's a mixed bag from one of

England's finest groups.

Flo & Eddie — Flo & Eddie
Warner Bros. M 52141
Remember the Turtles who
produced a number of very similar
Top 10 hits during the 60s and
ended up playing a command
performance at the White House?

Following their White House
appearance the group quickly
slipped into oblivion. Now two of
the Turtles, Mark Volman and
Howard Kaylan, have reappeared
as Flo & Eddie.
After working for awhile with
Frank Zappa and T. Rex, Volman
and Kaylan formed this group
with a number of experienced

musicians including former
Turtles bassist Jim Pons and John
Mayall's former drummer,
Aynsley Dunbar. Enough said
about who they are, it's time to
discuss what they do.
This is one of those albums
that slides off you much like a
politician's promise. It isn't a very
bad album, nor is it a very good
one. It gets off to a good start
with "If We Only Had The Time"
and "Days," but then Flo & Eddie
start floating around from one
musical style to the next.
A number of the songs have
traces of the Turtles' style and
"Afterglow" is a blatant
paraphrase of an old Turtles song.
But the group also screws around
with an asinine song about a
matador complete with Spanish
accents and flamenco guitar style,
a Sha-Na-Na type number called
"Best Part of Breaking Up," and a
completely ridiculous parody of a
circus announcer called "The
Sanzini 8r05.," in which they talk
about a "sodomy trick," as if to
assure they will never be invited
back to Dick's house.
The group has been touring
with Alice Cooper and as you
might expect, one of the numbers
includes some passages which are
clear imitations of Alice's style.
Flo & Eddie is a group with no
real direction. I see some faint
rays of talent shining through, but
they've definitely got a long way
to go.

Diamond Girl — Seals and Crofts
Warner Bros. 852699
Seals and Crofts have had a
fairly sizeable cult following for a
long while, but it wasn't until the
single "Summer Breeze" was
released last year that they
received real mass exposure. They
chose a fine single for their AM
debut and now they have
produced an excellent new album
which should sizeably swell the
ranks of their fans.
James Seals and Dash Crofts
are two extremely talented
musicians who remind me very
much of Kenny Loggins and Jim
Messina in terms of their
versatility. Besides being
harmonious and melodious
vocalists and accomplished
guitarists, the two are equally at
home on other instruments. On
this album, Seals plays a very
good alto sax and Crofts does a
beautiful passage on the
mandolin.
"Diamond Girl" is one of those
rare albums which does not
contain a bad cut. Starting with
the title song, there is a steady
steam of enjoyable and varied
songs, which are extremely
relaxing.
This is the kind of album
which goes well with a friend, a
little wine and some candlelight.
There is one good rocker,
"Standin' On A Mountain Top"
and one great country/western
cut, "Dust On My Saddle," but
other than that it is an album full
of beautiful musical poetry.
The album is dedicated to Seals
and Crofts' wives and there is real
love in the music. "Diamond Girl"
is sincerely moving as is "Jessica,"
but perhaps "Nine Houses" has
the most beautiful lyrics of all.
The end of "Nine Houses" goes

off to a fine start, suffers from the
tangent problem, but it is still a
good number which fills all of side
four. "Smoke On The Water" is a
solid cut, "Highway Star" features
some of Lord's best-ever organ

work and "Strange Kind of
Woman" is also very good, despite
the Edgar Winter mime routine.
I don't think this should have
been a two record set. If some of
the songs were a bit crisper and
more concise and a few were
eliminated all together, this would
be an outstanding album. As it is,
it's a mixed bag from one of

England's finest groups.

Flo & Eddie — Flo & Eddie
Warner Bros. M 52141
Remember the Turtles who
produced a number of very similar
Top 10 hits during the 60s and
ended up playing a command
performance at the White House?

Following their White House
appearance the group quickly
slipped into oblivion. Now two of
the Turtles, Mark Volman and
Howard Kaylan, have reappeared
as Flo & Eddie.
After working for awhile with
Frank Zappa and T. Rex, Volman
and Kaylan formed this group
with a number of experienced

musicians including former
Turtles bassist Jim Pons and John
Mayall's former drummer,
Aynsley Dunbar. Enough said
about who they are, it's time to
discuss what they do.
This is one of those albums
that slides off you much like a
politician's promise. It isn't a very
bad album, nor is it a very good
one. It gets off to a good start
with "If We Only Had The Time"
and "Days," but then Flo & Eddie
start floating around from one
musical style to the next.
A number of the songs have
traces of the Turtles' style and
"Afterglow" is a blatant
paraphrase of an old Turtles song.
But the group also screws around
with an asinine song about a
matador complete with Spanish
accents and flamenco guitar style,
a Sha-Na-Na type number called
"Best Part of Breaking Up," and a
completely ridiculous parody of a
circus announcer called "The
Sanzini 8r05.," in which they talk
about a "sodomy trick," as if to
assure they will never be invited
back to Dick's house.
The group has been touring
with Alice Cooper and as you
might expect, one of the numbers
includes some passages which are
clear imitations of Alice's style.
Flo & Eddie is a group with no
real direction. I see some faint
rays of talent shining through, but
they've definitely got a long way
to go.

Diamond Girl — Seals and Crofts
Warner Bros. 852699
Seals and Crofts have had a
fairly sizeable cult following for a
long while, but it wasn't until the
single "Summer Breeze" was
released last year that they
received real mass exposure. They
chose a fine single for their AM
debut and now they have
produced an excellent new album
which should sizeably swell the
ranks of their fans.
James Seals and Dash Crofts
are two extremely talented
musicians who remind me very
much of Kenny Loggins and Jim
Messina in terms of their
versatility. Besides being
harmonious and melodious
vocalists and accomplished
guitarists, the two are equally at
home on other instruments. On
this album, Seals plays a very
good alto sax and Crofts does a
beautiful passage on the
mandolin.
"Diamond Girl" is one of those
rare albums which does not
contain a bad cut. Starting with
the title song, there is a steady
steam of enjoyable and varied
songs, which are extremely
relaxing.
This is the kind of album
which goes well with a friend, a
little wine and some candlelight.
There is one good rocker,
"Standin' On A Mountain Top"
and one great country/western
cut, "Dust On My Saddle," but
other than that it is an album full
of beautiful musical poetry.
The album is dedicated to Seals
and Crofts' wives and there is real
love in the music. "Diamond Girl"
is sincerely moving as is "Jessica,"
but perhaps "Nine Houses" has
the most beautiful lyrics of all.
The end of "Nine Houses" goes
like this:
So there's a lotta sense in livin'
When the world we know
starts givin'
And we can spread our wings
some sunny day

And fly away
But till we fly together
What sense does it make?
Definitely one of the finest
releases so far this year.

Made In Japan — Deep Purple
Warner Bros. 2W52701
Considering this is a live album,

it isn't a bad effort. There is very
little of the usual inane small talk
with the audience and the album's
sound quality is surprisingly high.
But considering that Deep Purple
has been one of the most
consistent English rock groups
over the last five years, this album
is disappointingly inconsistent.
About half of the music is in
the best Deep Purple tradition.
Jon Lord again shows why he is
considered one of the most
talented organists around and on
part of the album, he leads the
band through the kind of
high-energy, often-frantic rock
that has become their trademark.
But on the rest of the album,
there are a number of problems.
There is some needless
screaming, including vocal miming
of a guitar in the worst tradition
of Edgar Winter. A large amount
of time is wasted on an uninspired
drum solo and even some of the

better cuts are hurt considerably
when the band goes off on
unnecessary instrumental
tangents.
"Space Truckin'," which gets
off to a fine start, suffers from the
tangent problem, but it is still a
good number which fills all of side
four. "Smoke On The Water" is a
solid cut, "Highway Star" features
