# Simplistic Dialogue In 'American Hero'
## 
### ROBERT SHERWOOD 
The LAST AMERICAN HERO
Directed by Lamut Johnson
a Screenplay by William Roberts
"The Last American Hero" is
not a tragic story. In fact it is very
little story at all. Jeff Bridges stars
a a "wild-assed moutain boy,"
Elroy Jackson Junior, who learns
all about fast driving running
moonshine for his father in
Wilkesboro, Georgia.
His father, a "mule-headed
man of principles," is caught and
sentenced to a year in prison,
forcing Junior to continue the
business literally underground and
turn to stock car racing for
money.
Jeff Bridges has played the
clean-cut tough guy since his
movie debut in "The Last Picture
Show." Evidently he is hot
property in Hollywood, judging
from his subsequent major roles in
"Bad Company" and "Fat City."
In "The Last American Hero" he
does a good job within the
confines of the moralizing script
and the simplistic dialogue.
Why Junior Jackson is the last
American hero is not made very
clear in the film, but we are given
a few clues. He seems to have
inherited his father's contempt for
city hall that "is so full of crooks
they're falling out of the
windows," as the subtle script
puts it.
Prefers Excitement
Junior prefers the excitement
and glory of stock car racing to a
mundane job as garage mechanic.
Finally, Junior daydreams himself
"into thinking he can whip the
whole world single handed."
Another quality Junior has is
the spirit of making it on his own,
of being his own boss. Other
drivers have sold out, he explains
to his unfaithful sweetheart
Marge, by hiring themselves out to
rich patrons who run the whole
show and take the largest profit
cut. Tension is supposed to build
as we wonder if he will be forced
to sell out himself.
Lamut Johnson directed this

rather bland film that is clearly
aiming at a teenage audience.
There is little excitement in the
photography of the film's five car
races, which alternate between
medium shots of Jeff Bridges at
the wheel and long shots of the
car being driven by a professional.
Adapted Screenplay
Scriptwriter William Roberts
adapted the screenplay from Tom
Wolfe's novel. Most scenes are so
black and white in their moral
statements that one easily begins
to predict upcoming situations in
the film.
Of course Junior cannot be
happy with an unfaithful
girlfriend, so she must run off
with another driver after vowing
to love him forever. There is also a
dismal attempt to capture
Southern teenage dialogue in lines
like, "I guess smarts just ain't my
suit."
What seems to make Junior
Jackson a hero in the film is that
he does not want to conform to
the rules of a society that is out to
prevent him from making it big as
a racing driver. He is forced to
compromise in the end, but it is a
compromise in his favor.
About the only thing one can
really say about "The Last
American Hero" is that Jeff
Bridges does have some talent and
may go far with it. Hollywood
seems to think so as well but
persists in casting him in a similar
role in each film, a role he seems
capable of moving away from by
now.

the rules of a society that is out to
prevent him from making it big as
a racing driver. He is forced to
compromise in the end, but it is a
compromise in his favor.
About the only thing one can
really say about "The Last
American Hero" is that Jeff
Bridges does have some talent and
may go far with it. Hollywood
seems to think so as well but
persists in casting him in a similar
role in each film, a role he seems
capable of moving away from by
now.
The LAST AMERICAN HERO
Directed by Lamut Johnson
a Screenplay by William Roberts
"The Last American Hero" is
not a tragic story. In fact it is very
little story at all. Jeff Bridges stars
a a "wild-assed moutain boy,"
Elroy Jackson Junior, who learns
all about fast driving running
moonshine for his father in
Wilkesboro, Georgia.
His father, a "mule-headed
man of principles," is caught and
sentenced to a year in prison,
forcing Junior to continue the
business literally underground and
turn to stock car racing for
money.
Jeff Bridges has played the
clean-cut tough guy since his
movie debut in "The Last Picture
Show." Evidently he is hot
property in Hollywood, judging
from his subsequent major roles in
"Bad Company" and "Fat City."
In "The Last American Hero" he
does a good job within the
confines of the moralizing script
and the simplistic dialogue.
Why Junior Jackson is the last
American hero is not made very
clear in the film, but we are given
a few clues. He seems to have
inherited his father's contempt for
city hall that "is so full of crooks
they're falling out of the
windows," as the subtle script
puts it.
Prefers Excitement
Junior prefers the excitement
and glory of stock car racing to a
mundane job as garage mechanic.
Finally, Junior daydreams himself
"into thinking he can whip the
whole world single handed."
Another quality Junior has is
the spirit of making it on his own,
of being his own boss. Other
drivers have sold out, he explains
to his unfaithful sweetheart
Marge, by hiring themselves out to
rich patrons who run the whole
show and take the largest profit
cut. Tension is supposed to build
as we wonder if he will be forced
to sell out himself.
Lamut Johnson directed this

rather bland film that is clearly
aiming at a teenage audience.
There is little excitement in the
photography of the film's five car
races, which alternate between
medium shots of Jeff Bridges at
the wheel and long shots of the
car being driven by a professional.
Adapted Screenplay
Scriptwriter William Roberts
adapted the screenplay from Tom
Wolfe's novel. Most scenes are so
black and white in their moral
statements that one easily begins
to predict upcoming situations in
the film.
Of course Junior cannot be
happy with an unfaithful
girlfriend, so she must run off
with another driver after vowing
to love him forever. There is also a
dismal attempt to capture
Southern teenage dialogue in lines
like, "I guess smarts just ain't my
suit."
What seems to make Junior
Jackson a hero in the film is that
he does not want to conform to
the rules of a society that is out to
prevent him from making it big as
a racing driver. He is forced to
compromise in the end, but it is a
compromise in his favor.
