# Afternoon Entertainment
## Rock Music Series At Circle Star 
### ROD KOON 
Far away from the land of
sunshine, of lazy lake afternoon,
suntans, sailboats, and canoes,
exists the Rock n' Round concert
series being held every Saturday in
San Carlos. In theory, a hot spring
afternoon is not the best day to
spend four hours inside listening
to music, but the Circle Star
Theatre manages to stay dark and
keep the theatre itself cool.
And if you manage to
overcome your psycho
rockological hangups of being
cooped up on a hot afternoon,
and watching a rock group during
the day, then you might be ready
for a trip to Circle Star Theatre.
Last Saturday, two groups
appeared in concert between one
and five o'clock in the afternoon.
Starting the show was a group
called Abel. The talent present in
the personnel handling 3 horns,
bass and regular guitar, bongo and
regular drums made for a good
dance band.
The music was fine to listen to
but better to dance to (if you can
imagine doing that on a Saturday
afternoon) but Circle Star is not
equipped with a dance floor.
Presence Marred
The band's fairly professional
stage presence was marred
somewhat when, after performing
for half an hour, another member
of the band showed up, walked
onto stage in the middle of a song,
carrying a suitcase, tambourine,
and cigarette.
He added little to the band,
keeping his back toward the
audience while he faced the
drummer on most songs, as if he
were getting cues from him on
how to play the tambourine. He
acted as if he were enjoying his
cigarette more than the
tambourine he was playing.
The band played mostly their
own original material, including
one song, "That's Life," which
they said would probably be on
their next album. I was surprised
that they even had one album out.
They might be doing better if
they did more standard "horn"

material, perhaps Chicago, which
they would surely be able to
handle.
A good change of pace from
their predominant fast rock
format was an instrumental
version of "Ain't No Sunshine,"
with a talented saxophone player
in the lead. The song reminded me
that it was still afternoon, and I
wished I were outside in the
sunshine again.
Good Beat
Overall, aside from the fixation
their guitarist had with his
wah-wah pedal, and his frequent
comments in between songs like
"Hey, we want you all to really
get into it and have a mellow time
today," the band played fairly
well.
They have a good beat and you
can dance to them, provided
there's a dance floor. What you
don't want to do is sit and stare at
them for over two hours. And
don't bother saving your nickels
and dimes for any of their albums.
One of the biggest problems
with the overall concert was that
Abel played three 45-minute sets,
which is a long time to just sit and
watch any group of this calibre.
Sporadically, members of the
sparse crowd, which numbered
around 300, would get up and
leave for awhile.
Fortunately the Circle Star
concession stand was open, and it
must have had a good day that
day. Unfortunately, one of the
sets of bathrooms was locked.
The main act of the show
featured Larry Graham, who was
formerly the bass player for Sly
and the Family Stone. He was
with Sly in the early "Dance to
the Music," "Stand," and
"Higher," days, before splitting to
form his own group entitled
Graham Central Station.
Late Start
They didn't get on stage until
3:30 and by the time they were
tuned and had played a lengthy
instrumental to introduce the five
men and one woman in the band,
it was a quarter to four. Which is
rather late for the main attraction

to get started.
Nevertheless, once they got
started, things went well. Graham
exhibited a lively showmanship on
stage. He was the one in
command, and the rest of his
band rallied behind him. Flanked
by an organist on each side, a lead
guitarist (the only white member
in the group), a girl singer clad
only in hip boots and a fringed
bikini, and a dummer in the rear,
Graham put in a good
performance.
Aside from performing some of
their own material, they handled
current popular hits by other
artists quite well, such as
"Superstitious," and "Taking Care
of Business."
One of the more mysterious
elements of the band was the
instrument (Graham called it a
"thought machine"(?)) which the
girl singer would play
occasionally. It seemed to make
no sound at all. When she did play
I "

it, it was a one fingered effort,
and she looked like a pretty
secretary typing ten words a
minute in a busy office, and
amazed at how busy everyone was
around her.
Occasionally she played the
tambourine, but most of all she
played sexy. After watching her,
you would think she might be
better off just playing the
tambourine.
Good Voice
Aside from all this, she actually
(id have a good voice and made
some fine harmony when coupled
with Graham's voice, which seemd
deeper and more powerful than
this bass guitar. One of the better
displays of this was In a song
called "People" an original
composition which will be on
their first album to be released by
Warner Brothers soon.
Elsewhere during their first set,
the drummer was brought out of
seclusion to do a solo, which
sounded impressive and looked

even better on his set of clear
drums. He also had quite a
workout reaching for four of the
highest status cymbals I have ever
seen a drummer use.
Overall, Graham Central
Station put on a good
performance. The audience kept
responding to their numbers, and
they had enough stage presence,
like old Sly & Co., to make you
want to watch them, and not
worry about dancing, though their
music is good for both.
This Saturday, May 19, the
Chambers Brothers will be
featured in the Rock n' Round,
same time, same place. Though
not much has come from them in
the past few years, they should
still put on quite a show, which
might be worth seeing. But when I
think of what a nice day I missed
by spending four hours in a
darkened arena listening to music,
I don't think I'll be back there
this weekend. Unless of course, it
rains.

highest status cymbals I have ever
seen a drummer use.
Overall, Graham Central
Station put on a good
performance. The audience kept
responding to their numbers, and
they had enough stage presence,
like old Sly & Co., to make you
want to watch them, and not
worry about dancing, though their
music is good for both.
This Saturday, May 19, the
Chambers Brothers will be
featured in the Rock n' Round,
same time, same place. Though
not much has come from them in
the past few years, they should
still put on quite a show, which
might be worth seeing. But when I
think of what a nice day I missed
by spending four hours in a
darkened arena listening to music,
I don't think I'll be back there
this weekend. Unless of course, it
rains.
Far away from the land of
sunshine, of lazy lake afternoon,
suntans, sailboats, and canoes,
exists the Rock n' Round concert
series being held every Saturday in
San Carlos. In theory, a hot spring
afternoon is not the best day to
spend four hours inside listening
to music, but the Circle Star
Theatre manages to stay dark and
keep the theatre itself cool.
And if you manage to
overcome your psycho
rockological hangups of being
cooped up on a hot afternoon,
and watching a rock group during
the day, then you might be ready
for a trip to Circle Star Theatre.
Last Saturday, two groups
appeared in concert between one
and five o'clock in the afternoon.
Starting the show was a group
called Abel. The talent present in
the personnel handling 3 horns,
bass and regular guitar, bongo and
regular drums made for a good
dance band.
The music was fine to listen to
but better to dance to (if you can
imagine doing that on a Saturday
afternoon) but Circle Star is not
equipped with a dance floor.
Presence Marred
The band's fairly professional
stage presence was marred
somewhat when, after performing
for half an hour, another member
of the band showed up, walked
onto stage in the middle of a song,
carrying a suitcase, tambourine,
and cigarette.
He added little to the band,
keeping his back toward the
audience while he faced the
drummer on most songs, as if he
were getting cues from him on
how to play the tambourine. He
acted as if he were enjoying his
cigarette more than the
tambourine he was playing.
The band played mostly their
own original material, including
one song, "That's Life," which
they said would probably be on
their next album. I was surprised
that they even had one album out.
They might be doing better if
they did more standard "horn"

material, perhaps Chicago, which
they would surely be able to
handle.
A good change of pace from
their predominant fast rock
format was an instrumental
version of "Ain't No Sunshine,"
with a talented saxophone player
in the lead. The song reminded me
that it was still afternoon, and I
wished I were outside in the
sunshine again.
Good Beat
Overall, aside from the fixation
their guitarist had with his
wah-wah pedal, and his frequent
comments in between songs like
"Hey, we want you all to really
get into it and have a mellow time
today," the band played fairly
well.
They have a good beat and you
can dance to them, provided
there's a dance floor. What you
don't want to do is sit and stare at
them for over two hours. And
don't bother saving your nickels
and dimes for any of their albums.
One of the biggest problems
with the overall concert was that
Abel played three 45-minute sets,
which is a long time to just sit and
watch any group of this calibre.
Sporadically, members of the
sparse crowd, which numbered
around 300, would get up and
leave for awhile.
Fortunately the Circle Star
concession stand was open, and it
must have had a good day that
day. Unfortunately, one of the
sets of bathrooms was locked.
The main act of the show
featured Larry Graham, who was
formerly the bass player for Sly
and the Family Stone. He was
with Sly in the early "Dance to
the Music," "Stand," and
"Higher," days, before splitting to
form his own group entitled
Graham Central Station.
Late Start
They didn't get on stage until
3:30 and by the time they were
tuned and had played a lengthy
instrumental to introduce the five
men and one woman in the band,
it was a quarter to four. Which is
rather late for the main attraction

to get started.
Nevertheless, once they got
started, things went well. Graham
exhibited a lively showmanship on
stage. He was the one in
command, and the rest of his
band rallied behind him. Flanked
by an organist on each side, a lead
guitarist (the only white member
in the group), a girl singer clad
only in hip boots and a fringed
bikini, and a dummer in the rear,
Graham put in a good
performance.
Aside from performing some of
their own material, they handled
current popular hits by other
artists quite well, such as
"Superstitious," and "Taking Care
of Business."
One of the more mysterious
elements of the band was the
instrument (Graham called it a
"thought machine"(?)) which the
girl singer would play
occasionally. It seemed to make
no sound at all. When she did play
I "

it, it was a one fingered effort,
and she looked like a pretty
secretary typing ten words a
minute in a busy office, and
amazed at how busy everyone was
around her.
Occasionally she played the
tambourine, but most of all she
played sexy. After watching her,
you would think she might be
better off just playing the
tambourine.
Good Voice
Aside from all this, she actually
(id have a good voice and made
some fine harmony when coupled
with Graham's voice, which seemd
deeper and more powerful than
this bass guitar. One of the better
displays of this was In a song
called "People" an original
composition which will be on
their first album to be released by
Warner Brothers soon.
Elsewhere during their first set,
the drummer was brought out of
seclusion to do a solo, which
sounded impressive and looked

even better on his set of clear
drums. He also had quite a
workout reaching for four of the
highest status cymbals I have ever
seen a drummer use.
Overall, Graham Central
Station put on a good
performance. The audience kept
responding to their numbers, and
they had enough stage presence,

around her.
Occasionally she played the
tambourine, but most of all she
played sexy. After watching her,
you would think she might be
better off just playing the
tambourine.
Good Voice
Aside from all this, she actually
(id have a good voice and made
some fine harmony when coupled
with Graham's voice, which seemd
deeper and more powerful than
this bass guitar. One of the better
displays of this was In a song
called "People" an original
composition which will be on
their first album to be released by
Warner Brothers soon.
Elsewhere during their first set,
the drummer was brought out of
seclusion to do a solo, which
sounded impressive and looked

even better on his set of clear
drums. He also had quite a
workout reaching for four of the
highest status cymbals I have ever
seen a drummer use.
Overall, Graham Central
Station put on a good
performance. The audience kept
responding to their numbers, and
they had enough stage presence,
like old Sly & Co., to make you
want to watch them, and not
worry about dancing, though their
music is good for both.
This Saturday, May 19, the
Chambers Brothers will be
featured in the Rock n' Round,
same time, same place. Though
not much has come from them in
the past few years, they should
still put on quite a show, which
might be worth seeing. But when I
think of what a nice day I missed
by spending four hours in a
darkened arena listening to music,
I don't think I'll be back there
this weekend. Unless of course, it
rains.
Far away from the land of
sunshine, of lazy lake afternoon,
suntans, sailboats, and canoes,
exists the Rock n' Round concert
series being held every Saturday in
San Carlos. In theory, a hot spring
afternoon is not the best day to
spend four hours inside listening
to music, but the Circle Star
Theatre manages to stay dark and
keep the theatre itself cool.
And if you manage to
overcome your psycho
rockological hangups of being
cooped up on a hot afternoon,
and watching a rock group during
the day, then you might be ready
for a trip to Circle Star Theatre.
Last Saturday, two groups
appeared in concert between one
and five o'clock in the afternoon.
Starting the show was a group
called Abel. The talent present in
the personnel handling 3 horns,
bass and regular guitar, bongo and
regular drums made for a good
dance band.
The music was fine to listen to
but better to dance to (if you can
imagine doing that on a Saturday
afternoon) but Circle Star is not
equipped with a dance floor.
Presence Marred
The band's fairly professional
stage presence was marred
somewhat when, after performing
for half an hour, another member
of the band showed up, walked
onto stage in the middle of a song,
carrying a suitcase, tambourine,
and cigarette.
He added little to the band,
keeping his back toward the
audience while he faced the
drummer on most songs, as if he
were getting cues from him on
how to play the tambourine. He
acted as if he were enjoying his
cigarette more than the
tambourine he was playing.
The band played mostly their
own original material, including
one song, "That's Life," which
they said would probably be on
their next album. I was surprised
that they even had one album out.
They might be doing better if
they did more standard "horn"

material, perhaps Chicago, which
they would surely be able to
handle.
A good change of pace from
their predominant fast rock
format was an instrumental
version of "Ain't No Sunshine,"
with a talented saxophone player
in the lead. The song reminded me
that it was still afternoon, and I
wished I were outside in the
sunshine again.
Good Beat
Overall, aside from the fixation
their guitarist had with his
wah-wah pedal, and his frequent
comments in between songs like
"Hey, we want you all to really
get into it and have a mellow time
today," the band played fairly
well.
They have a good beat and you
can dance to them, provided
there's a dance floor. What you
don't want to do is sit and stare at
them for over two hours. And
don't bother saving your nickels
and dimes for any of their albums.
One of the biggest problems
with the overall concert was that
Abel played three 45-minute sets,
which is a long time to just sit and
watch any group of this calibre.
Sporadically, members of the
sparse crowd, which numbered
around 300, would get up and
leave for awhile.
Fortunately the Circle Star
concession stand was open, and it
must have had a good day that
day. Unfortunately, one of the
sets of bathrooms was locked.
The main act of the show
featured Larry Graham, who was
formerly the bass player for Sly
and the Family Stone. He was
with Sly in the early "Dance to
the Music," "Stand," and
"Higher," days, before splitting to
form his own group entitled
Graham Central Station.
Late Start
They didn't get on stage until
3:30 and by the time they were
tuned and had played a lengthy
instrumental to introduce the five
men and one woman in the band,
it was a quarter to four. Which is
rather late for the main attraction

to get started.
Nevertheless, once they got
started, things went well. Graham
exhibited a lively showmanship on
stage. He was the one in
command, and the rest of his
band rallied behind him. Flanked
by an organist on each side, a lead
guitarist (the only white member
in the group), a girl singer clad
only in hip boots and a fringed
bikini, and a dummer in the rear,
Graham put in a good
performance.
Aside from performing some of
their own material, they handled
current popular hits by other
artists quite well, such as
"Superstitious," and "Taking Care
of Business."
One of the more mysterious
elements of the band was the
instrument (Graham called it a
"thought machine"(?)) which the
girl singer would play
occasionally. It seemed to make
no sound at all. When she did play
I "

it, it was a one fingered effort,
and she looked like a pretty
secretary typing ten words a
minute in a busy office, and
amazed at how busy everyone was
around her.
Occasionally she played the
tambourine, but most of all she
played sexy. After watching her,
you would think she might be
better off just playing the
tambourine.
