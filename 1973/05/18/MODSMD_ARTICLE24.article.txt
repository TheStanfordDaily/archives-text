# Cards Hope For Fifth Place Finish
## UCLA Favored In Pac-8 Track Meet 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
The 14th annual Pacific Eight
Conference Track and Field
Championships will be held today
and tomorrow at Hayward Field
at Oregon. Stanford will field a
16-man squad for the meet, led by
Coach Payton Jordan and his
assistant, Marshall Clark.
There seems to be little doubt
in anyone's mind that UCLA will
take the conference title away
from USC this year. The Bruins
have controlled every team they
have come up against this season,
including the Trojans.
"UCLA is capable of scoring
upwards of 180 points if they pull
out all the stops," Jordan
commented. Last year's winning

total was 140. "I figure USC and
Oregon will fight it out for
second, with Oregon the slight
favorite," he continued.
"Oregon State should be
fourth, and after that, it will be a
fight. We should be able to beat
Washington, and even though
both Cal and Washington State are
slightly favored over us, I think
we've got a goot shot at them. If
we get the breaks, we might even
catch Oregon State."
The scoring system in the Pac-8
meet is 10-8-6-4-2-1 for first
through sixth respectively. In an
eight-team meet such as this, a
few high places count much more
than in the smaller meets. Last
year the Cards took seventh with

23 points, including only one
second and one third.
Stanford has one possible
conference champion in Terry
Albritton. Only a freshman,
Albritton has already set school
records twice in his specialty, the
shot put, as well as throwing the
discus 168 feet.
Besides Albritton, the Cards
have several other possibilities for
high places. Dave Bagshaw took
sixth last year in the high hurdles
with a 14.2 and has lowerd his
time to 14.1 this year.
Ken Curl took sixth in the 100
last year with 9.7, and has run 9.6
more than once this season. Rod
Utley was likewise sixth in the
triple jump in the 1972
conference meet with 49-1 and
has bettered that mark this year.
Jordan is also looking for a
high place from Kenny Kring,
Stanford's decathlon ace. This is
the first year the decathlon has
been run in the Pac-8, and Kring's
two years of junior college
decathlon experience should
prove very helpful.
The meet begins at 9 a.m.
today with decathlon events. The
other events begin at 2:30 p.m.
with the pole vault. The Pac-8
meet is traditionally the premier
conference meet in the country,
and the winner is more often than
not the NCAA favorite.
GENERAL OUTLOOK
100—The favorite here is
UCLA's Gordon Peppars with a
9.5. Six others have run 9.6,
including Ken Curl and Oregon's
A 1 Hearvey, who has placed in the
last three conference meets.
220—USC's Don Quarrie is the
leader with a 20.8. UCLA's Benny
Brown and Gordon Peppars are
right on his heels. Curl is a
possibility for a place, too, at

21.3.
440—Benny Brown should
have no trouble at this distance as
he leads the Pac-8, as well as the
rest of the world, at 45.0.
Teammate Maxie Parks and USC's
Ken Randle should be fighting it
out for second. John Anderson
has an outside chance to score for
the Cards.
880-Hailu Ebba of Oregon
State has the best time this year at
1:48.2, but defending champion
Rick Brown of Cal ran 1:47.7 last
year and won't give up his title
without a fight. Vemell Jackson is
Stanford's hope in the half.
Mile—Oregon has four of the
top five milers led by Steve
Prefontaine's 3:55. Ebba has run
3:58.1. Mittelstaedt is currently
sixth, and will be joined in
the mile field by teammate Les
McFadden.
120 High Hurdles-Jerry
Wilson of USC and Charles Rich
and Clim Jackson of UCLA have
all run 13.7, so it should be an
interesting race. Dave Bagshaw's
14.1 is sixth in the conference this
year.
440 Intermediate
Hurdles—USC's Bob Coffman has
clocked 51.4, as has UCLA's
Lynnsey Guerrero. Both Bagshaw
and Matt Hogsett will be
representing Stanford.
Three-Mile-Oregon's
Prefontaine leads the conference
at 13:06.4. Tony Sandoval has a
shot at placing for the Cards, as
does Mark McConnell. Both have
run lifetime bests this year.
Six-Mile—Once again it's
Prefontaine over 1:40 ahead of his
nearest competition at 27:09.4.
Sandoval is presently fourth in the
Pac-8 with a 28:58.6.
Decathlon—Craig Brigham of
Oregon is the favorite, with

UCLA's Sam Albanese, USC's Bo
Sterner, and Kenny Kring all close
behind.
Shot Put-Albritton is the
Pac-8 leader at 61-6V6, but Kent
Pagel and Dave Schiller of UCLA
are both just inches away.
Discus—Mao Wilkins of Oregon
is the only man over 200 feet
here.Jim Howard is currently
sixth for the Cards at 174-2.
Javelin—Gary Quitsland of
Washington and Bruce v Kennedy
of Cal should have a good duel
here. Steven Hopkins will throw
for Stanford.
Long Jump—Randy Williams of
USC and UCLA's James McAlister
are over a foot ahead of the rest
of the field. Stanford's Tom
Anderson has a good shot at
placing here.
High Jump—With eight
seven-footers led by Oregon
State's Tom Woods (7-4 1 /2), it
would take a miracle for
Anderson (6-6) to place.
Triple Jump—Harry Freeman
(53-2%) and Milan Tiff (52-6 3 / 4 ) of
UCLA are the favorites, Rod
Utley has a chance for a place.
Pole Vault—UCLA's Francois
Tracanelli is the leader at 17-5,
with teammate Ron Mooers a
distant second at 16-7V&. Stanford
has no entries.

TAKING OFF—California pole vaulter Ed Otter, shown here
competing against Stanford in the Big Meet, will be hard pressed to
challenge UCLA's Francois Tracanelli (17-5) in this weekend's Pacific
Eight Championships at Eugene, Ore. UCLA is favored to win the
Pac-8 title while Stanford, California, and Washington State will most
likely battle it out for fifth place.

Teammate Maxie Parks and USC's
Ken Randle should be fighting it
out for second. John Anderson
has an outside chance to score for
the Cards.
880-Hailu Ebba of Oregon
State has the best time this year at
1:48.2, but defending champion
Rick Brown of Cal ran 1:47.7 last
year and won't give up his title
without a fight. Vemell Jackson is
Stanford's hope in the half.
Mile—Oregon has four of the
top five milers led by Steve
Prefontaine's 3:55. Ebba has run
3:58.1. Mittelstaedt is currently
sixth, and will be joined in
the mile field by teammate Les
McFadden.
120 High Hurdles-Jerry
Wilson of USC and Charles Rich
and Clim Jackson of UCLA have
all run 13.7, so it should be an
interesting race. Dave Bagshaw's
14.1 is sixth in the conference this
year.
440 Intermediate
Hurdles—USC's Bob Coffman has
clocked 51.4, as has UCLA's
Lynnsey Guerrero. Both Bagshaw
and Matt Hogsett will be
representing Stanford.
Three-Mile-Oregon's
Prefontaine leads the conference
at 13:06.4. Tony Sandoval has a
shot at placing for the Cards, as
does Mark McConnell. Both have
run lifetime bests this year.
Six-Mile—Once again it's
Prefontaine over 1:40 ahead of his
nearest competition at 27:09.4.
Sandoval is presently fourth in the
Pac-8 with a 28:58.6.
Decathlon—Craig Brigham of
Oregon is the favorite, with

UCLA's Sam Albanese, USC's Bo
Sterner, and Kenny Kring all close
behind.
Shot Put-Albritton is the
Pac-8 leader at 61-6V6, but Kent
Pagel and Dave Schiller of UCLA
are both just inches away.
Discus—Mao Wilkins of Oregon
is the only man over 200 feet
here.Jim Howard is currently
sixth for the Cards at 174-2.
Javelin—Gary Quitsland of
Washington and Bruce v Kennedy
of Cal should have a good duel
here. Steven Hopkins will throw
for Stanford.
Long Jump—Randy Williams of
USC and UCLA's James McAlister
are over a foot ahead of the rest
of the field. Stanford's Tom
Anderson has a good shot at
placing here.
High Jump—With eight
seven-footers led by Oregon
State's Tom Woods (7-4 1 /2), it
would take a miracle for
Anderson (6-6) to place.
Triple Jump—Harry Freeman
(53-2%) and Milan Tiff (52-6 3 / 4 ) of
UCLA are the favorites, Rod
Utley has a chance for a place.
Pole Vault—UCLA's Francois
Tracanelli is the leader at 17-5,
with teammate Ron Mooers a
distant second at 16-7V&. Stanford
has no entries.

TAKING OFF—California pole vaulter Ed Otter, shown here
competing against Stanford in the Big Meet, will be hard pressed to
challenge UCLA's Francois Tracanelli (17-5) in this weekend's Pacific
Eight Championships at Eugene, Ore. UCLA is favored to win the
Pac-8 title while Stanford, California, and Washington State will most
likely battle it out for fifth place.
The 14th annual Pacific Eight
Conference Track and Field
Championships will be held today
and tomorrow at Hayward Field
at Oregon. Stanford will field a
16-man squad for the meet, led by
Coach Payton Jordan and his
assistant, Marshall Clark.
There seems to be little doubt
in anyone's mind that UCLA will
take the conference title away
from USC this year. The Bruins
have controlled every team they
have come up against this season,
including the Trojans.
"UCLA is capable of scoring
upwards of 180 points if they pull
out all the stops," Jordan
commented. Last year's winning

total was 140. "I figure USC and
Oregon will fight it out for
second, with Oregon the slight
favorite," he continued.
"Oregon State should be
fourth, and after that, it will be a
fight. We should be able to beat
Washington, and even though
both Cal and Washington State are
slightly favored over us, I think
we've got a goot shot at them. If
we get the breaks, we might even
catch Oregon State."
The scoring system in the Pac-8
meet is 10-8-6-4-2-1 for first
through sixth respectively. In an
eight-team meet such as this, a
few high places count much more
than in the smaller meets. Last
year the Cards took seventh with

23 points, including only one
second and one third.
Stanford has one possible
conference champion in Terry
Albritton. Only a freshman,
Albritton has already set school
records twice in his specialty, the
shot put, as well as throwing the
discus 168 feet.
Besides Albritton, the Cards
have several other possibilities for
high places. Dave Bagshaw took
sixth last year in the high hurdles
with a 14.2 and has lowerd his
time to 14.1 this year.
Ken Curl took sixth in the 100
last year with 9.7, and has run 9.6
more than once this season. Rod
Utley was likewise sixth in the
triple jump in the 1972
conference meet with 49-1 and
has bettered that mark this year.
Jordan is also looking for a
high place from Kenny Kring,
Stanford's decathlon ace. This is
the first year the decathlon has
been run in the Pac-8, and Kring's
two years of junior college
decathlon experience should
prove very helpful.
The meet begins at 9 a.m.
today with decathlon events. The
other events begin at 2:30 p.m.
with the pole vault. The Pac-8
meet is traditionally the premier
conference meet in the country,
and the winner is more often than
not the NCAA favorite.
GENERAL OUTLOOK
100—The favorite here is
UCLA's Gordon Peppars with a
9.5. Six others have run 9.6,
including Ken Curl and Oregon's
A 1 Hearvey, who has placed in the
last three conference meets.
220—USC's Don Quarrie is the
leader with a 20.8. UCLA's Benny
Brown and Gordon Peppars are
right on his heels. Curl is a
possibility for a place, too, at

21.3.
440—Benny Brown should
have no trouble at this distance as
he leads the Pac-8, as well as the
rest of the world, at 45.0.

likely battle it out for fifth place.
The 14th annual Pacific Eight
Conference Track and Field
Championships will be held today
and tomorrow at Hayward Field
at Oregon. Stanford will field a
16-man squad for the meet, led by
Coach Payton Jordan and his
assistant, Marshall Clark.
There seems to be little doubt
in anyone's mind that UCLA will
take the conference title away
from USC this year. The Bruins
have controlled every team they
have come up against this season,
including the Trojans.
"UCLA is capable of scoring
upwards of 180 points if they pull
out all the stops," Jordan
commented. Last year's winning

total was 140. "I figure USC and
Oregon will fight it out for
second, with Oregon the slight
favorite," he continued.
"Oregon State should be
fourth, and after that, it will be a
fight. We should be able to beat
Washington, and even though
both Cal and Washington State are
slightly favored over us, I think
we've got a goot shot at them. If
we get the breaks, we might even
catch Oregon State."
The scoring system in the Pac-8
meet is 10-8-6-4-2-1 for first
through sixth respectively. In an
eight-team meet such as this, a
few high places count much more
than in the smaller meets. Last
year the Cards took seventh with

23 points, including only one
second and one third.
Stanford has one possible
conference champion in Terry
Albritton. Only a freshman,
Albritton has already set school
records twice in his specialty, the
shot put, as well as throwing the
discus 168 feet.
Besides Albritton, the Cards
have several other possibilities for
high places. Dave Bagshaw took
sixth last year in the high hurdles
with a 14.2 and has lowerd his
time to 14.1 this year.
Ken Curl took sixth in the 100
last year with 9.7, and has run 9.6
more than once this season. Rod
Utley was likewise sixth in the
triple jump in the 1972
conference meet with 49-1 and
has bettered that mark this year.
Jordan is also looking for a
high place from Kenny Kring,
Stanford's decathlon ace. This is
the first year the decathlon has
been run in the Pac-8, and Kring's
two years of junior college
decathlon experience should
prove very helpful.
The meet begins at 9 a.m.
today with decathlon events. The
other events begin at 2:30 p.m.
with the pole vault. The Pac-8
meet is traditionally the premier
conference meet in the country,
and the winner is more often than
not the NCAA favorite.
GENERAL OUTLOOK
100—The favorite here is
UCLA's Gordon Peppars with a
9.5. Six others have run 9.6,
including Ken Curl and Oregon's
A 1 Hearvey, who has placed in the
last three conference meets.
220—USC's Don Quarrie is the
leader with a 20.8. UCLA's Benny
Brown and Gordon Peppars are
right on his heels. Curl is a
possibility for a place, too, at

21.3.
440—Benny Brown should
have no trouble at this distance as
he leads the Pac-8, as well as the
rest of the world, at 45.0.
Teammate Maxie Parks and USC's
Ken Randle should be fighting it
out for second. John Anderson
has an outside chance to score for
the Cards.
880-Hailu Ebba of Oregon
State has the best time this year at
1:48.2, but defending champion
Rick Brown of Cal ran 1:47.7 last
year and won't give up his title
without a fight. Vemell Jackson is
Stanford's hope in the half.
Mile—Oregon has four of the
top five milers led by Steve
Prefontaine's 3:55. Ebba has run
3:58.1. Mittelstaedt is currently
sixth, and will be joined in
the mile field by teammate Les
McFadden.
120 High Hurdles-Jerry
Wilson of USC and Charles Rich
and Clim Jackson of UCLA have
all run 13.7, so it should be an
interesting race. Dave Bagshaw's
14.1 is sixth in the conference this
year.
440 Intermediate
Hurdles—USC's Bob Coffman has
clocked 51.4, as has UCLA's
Lynnsey Guerrero. Both Bagshaw
and Matt Hogsett will be
representing Stanford.
Three-Mile-Oregon's
Prefontaine leads the conference
at 13:06.4. Tony Sandoval has a
shot at placing for the Cards, as
does Mark McConnell. Both have
run lifetime bests this year.
Six-Mile—Once again it's
Prefontaine over 1:40 ahead of his
nearest competition at 27:09.4.
Sandoval is presently fourth in the
Pac-8 with a 28:58.6.
Decathlon—Craig Brigham of
Oregon is the favorite, with

UCLA's Sam Albanese, USC's Bo
Sterner, and Kenny Kring all close
behind.
Shot Put-Albritton is the
Pac-8 leader at 61-6V6, but Kent
Pagel and Dave Schiller of UCLA
are both just inches away.
Discus—Mao Wilkins of Oregon
is the only man over 200 feet
here.Jim Howard is currently
sixth for the Cards at 174-2.
Javelin—Gary Quitsland of
Washington and Bruce v Kennedy
of Cal should have a good duel
here. Steven Hopkins will throw
for Stanford.
Long Jump—Randy Williams of
USC and UCLA's James McAlister
are over a foot ahead of the rest
of the field. Stanford's Tom
Anderson has a good shot at
placing here.
High Jump—With eight
seven-footers led by Oregon
State's Tom Woods (7-4 1 /2), it
would take a miracle for
Anderson (6-6) to place.
Triple Jump—Harry Freeman
(53-2%) and Milan Tiff (52-6 3 / 4 ) of
UCLA are the favorites, Rod
Utley has a chance for a place.
Pole Vault—UCLA's Francois
Tracanelli is the leader at 17-5,
with teammate Ron Mooers a
distant second at 16-7V&. Stanford
has no entries.

rest of the world, at 45.0.
Teammate Maxie Parks and USC's
Ken Randle should be fighting it
out for second. John Anderson
has an outside chance to score for
the Cards.
880-Hailu Ebba of Oregon
State has the best time this year at
1:48.2, but defending champion
Rick Brown of Cal ran 1:47.7 last
year and won't give up his title
without a fight. Vemell Jackson is
Stanford's hope in the half.
Mile—Oregon has four of the
top five milers led by Steve
Prefontaine's 3:55. Ebba has run
3:58.1. Mittelstaedt is currently
sixth, and will be joined in
the mile field by teammate Les
McFadden.
120 High Hurdles-Jerry
Wilson of USC and Charles Rich
and Clim Jackson of UCLA have
all run 13.7, so it should be an
interesting race. Dave Bagshaw's
14.1 is sixth in the conference this
year.
440 Intermediate
Hurdles—USC's Bob Coffman has
clocked 51.4, as has UCLA's
Lynnsey Guerrero. Both Bagshaw
and Matt Hogsett will be
representing Stanford.
Three-Mile-Oregon's
Prefontaine leads the conference
at 13:06.4. Tony Sandoval has a
shot at placing for the Cards, as
does Mark McConnell. Both have
run lifetime bests this year.
Six-Mile—Once again it's
Prefontaine over 1:40 ahead of his
nearest competition at 27:09.4.
Sandoval is presently fourth in the
Pac-8 with a 28:58.6.
Decathlon—Craig Brigham of
Oregon is the favorite, with

UCLA's Sam Albanese, USC's Bo
Sterner, and Kenny Kring all close
behind.
Shot Put-Albritton is the
Pac-8 leader at 61-6V6, but Kent
Pagel and Dave Schiller of UCLA
are both just inches away.
Discus—Mao Wilkins of Oregon
is the only man over 200 feet
here.Jim Howard is currently
sixth for the Cards at 174-2.
Javelin—Gary Quitsland of
Washington and Bruce v Kennedy
of Cal should have a good duel
here. Steven Hopkins will throw
for Stanford.
Long Jump—Randy Williams of
USC and UCLA's James McAlister
are over a foot ahead of the rest
of the field. Stanford's Tom
Anderson has a good shot at
placing here.
High Jump—With eight
seven-footers led by Oregon
State's Tom Woods (7-4 1 /2), it
would take a miracle for
Anderson (6-6) to place.
Triple Jump—Harry Freeman
(53-2%) and Milan Tiff (52-6 3 / 4 ) of
UCLA are the favorites, Rod
Utley has a chance for a place.
Pole Vault—UCLA's Francois
Tracanelli is the leader at 17-5,
with teammate Ron Mooers a
distant second at 16-7V&. Stanford
has no entries.

TAKING OFF—California pole vaulter Ed Otter, shown here
competing against Stanford in the Big Meet, will be hard pressed to
challenge UCLA's Francois Tracanelli (17-5) in this weekend's Pacific
Eight Championships at Eugene, Ore. UCLA is favored to win the
Pac-8 title while Stanford, California, and Washington State will most
likely battle it out for fifth place.
