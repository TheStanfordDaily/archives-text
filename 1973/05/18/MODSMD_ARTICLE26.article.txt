# 'Little Big Game'
## Storey Meets Cal's Delta Gammas 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Stanford women take the field
at 4 p.m. today to defend the
Farm's honor in the first annual
"Little Big Game" between the
Cards and Berkeley.
Storey House will battle a team
from Cal's Delta Gamma sorority
on the rugby field near the
Sunken Diamond in a powderpuff
flag football contest that is
rapidly shaping up as the most
important game this afternoon.
Star quarterback Barb Booth

will direct the Storey girls,
throwing to award-winning wide
receivers Susie (FLASH) Adams
and Sally Vaughn. Running backs
Shelly Content and Vicki Van
Dyke offer balance to the Storey
attack.
The Storey girls,
eight-touchdown favorites, took
second place in last fall's women's
league. "We would have done
better, but we played too many
games on Sunday's after Saturday
night parties," co-captain Suzanne
Biggs, a guard, told the Daily.
She said her team was strongest
in the defensive secondary, but
weak in both offensive and
defensive lines.
"Two of our stalwarts went
overseas this quarter," Biggs

explained.
The other co-captain is center
Anna Durbin. Filling out the
roster are Molly Brecht, Wendy
Slobe, Pam Richey, Ann Carter,
Karen Swisher, Alina Gonzalez,
and several minor league players
yet to be named.
Coaching are seniors Kip
Blakemore and John McCormack.
