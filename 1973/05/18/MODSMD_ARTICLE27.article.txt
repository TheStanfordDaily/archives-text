# Crew Competes At Western Sprints
## 
### 
Stanford will be one of 11
teams trying to unseat
perennial champion
Washington this weekend at
the Western Sprint Rowing
Championships at Lexington
Reservoir in Los Gatos.
The Huskies, who have
seven lettermen back from
last year's Western Sprint
champions and are
undefeated in 1973
competition, are the odds-on
favorites to win again this
year. The leading Pac-8 boat
in the Western Sprints is
annually declared the Pac-8
champion and Washington is
also favored to win its 11th
league title in the past 14
years.
Besides the varsity
competition, Stanford will
enter five other boats in the
two-day event, which
includes heats today and final
races tomorrow.
