# Shuffling The Cards
## WSU's Dishonesty 
### Dave Robinson 
Colleges and universities are periodically reprimanded by the
NCAA for flagrant violations of recruiting rules, but all too often
more subtle efforts by college athletic departments to win at all costs
remain unpunished.
The Pacific Eight golf tournament Monday and Tuesday at
Clarkston, Wash, was a clear illustration of the latter problem. The
tournament, originally scheduled for Manito Golf Course in Spokane,
was suddenly switched to Clarkston Golf Course in Clarkston only
two days prior to the start of the tourney.
Eugene Patterson, coach of the host Washington State team,
explained that the Manito course was "unplayable" due to some work
on the greens and decided Saturday to move the tournament to
Clarkston where coincidentally his Cougars had won the Pac-8
Northern Division title.
Most of the other Pac-8 coaches were less than thrilled by the
prospect of an extra two hour drive from the Spokane airport to
Clarkston, but they accepted Patterson's decision and showed up for a
practice round Sunday at Clarkston Golf Course, a 5850 yard layout
Stanford coach Bud Finger described as "rinky-dink" and Card senior
John Beers more eloquently termed "an ungraceful thrasher's course."
Meanwhile USC coach Stan Wood, disturbed by the state of affairs
and its possible consequences for his favored Trojan squad, made a
trip to Manito and discovered that the course was indeed playable.
Wood spoke with the course superintendent, who denied ever telling
Washington State that the course wasn't in good enough shape for the
tournament.
While Manito is a championship calibre course suitable for a major
tournament like the Pac-B's, Clarkston hardly provided a legitimate
test for the league's top golfers. Stanford's Dave Baskins fired a six
under par 64 in the final round and other scores in the 60's were
commonplace.
It is certainly true that those subpar rounds represented some
outstanding golf and that the best team (USC) still won and the
second best team (Stanford) still finished second, but the tournament
was deprived of some of the excitement and challenge provided by a
championship calibre golf course.

The Indian seems to have died pretty quietly as the mascot of
Stanford's athletic teams (except for some occasional slips by KSFO
announcers Don Klein and Bob Murphy during last fall's football
season), but the Indian returned in Wednesday's edition of the San
Francisco Chronicle. Chronicle sportswriter Darrell Wilson wrote that
Stanford track coach Payton Jordan "hopes that freshman Terry
Albritton can win the shot put and that several Indians can break
through the mass of talent for points" at the Pac-8 track meet.

Linebacker Jim Merlo, the most valuable player on Stanford's 1972
football team, has signed a three-year contract with the New Orleans
Saints of the National Football League.
Merlo, the Saints' fourth round draft choice, wouldn't reveal any
figures, but said that his contract was reportedly more lucrative than
any of the 15 fourth round draft choices who had already signed.

figures, but said that his contract was reportedly more lucrative than
any of the 15 fourth round draft choices who had already signed.
Colleges and universities are periodically reprimanded by the
NCAA for flagrant violations of recruiting rules, but all too often
more subtle efforts by college athletic departments to win at all costs
remain unpunished.
The Pacific Eight golf tournament Monday and Tuesday at
Clarkston, Wash, was a clear illustration of the latter problem. The
tournament, originally scheduled for Manito Golf Course in Spokane,
was suddenly switched to Clarkston Golf Course in Clarkston only
two days prior to the start of the tourney.
Eugene Patterson, coach of the host Washington State team,
explained that the Manito course was "unplayable" due to some work
on the greens and decided Saturday to move the tournament to
Clarkston where coincidentally his Cougars had won the Pac-8
Northern Division title.
Most of the other Pac-8 coaches were less than thrilled by the
prospect of an extra two hour drive from the Spokane airport to
Clarkston, but they accepted Patterson's decision and showed up for a
practice round Sunday at Clarkston Golf Course, a 5850 yard layout
Stanford coach Bud Finger described as "rinky-dink" and Card senior
John Beers more eloquently termed "an ungraceful thrasher's course."
Meanwhile USC coach Stan Wood, disturbed by the state of affairs
and its possible consequences for his favored Trojan squad, made a
trip to Manito and discovered that the course was indeed playable.
Wood spoke with the course superintendent, who denied ever telling
Washington State that the course wasn't in good enough shape for the
tournament.
While Manito is a championship calibre course suitable for a major
tournament like the Pac-B's, Clarkston hardly provided a legitimate
test for the league's top golfers. Stanford's Dave Baskins fired a six
under par 64 in the final round and other scores in the 60's were
commonplace.
It is certainly true that those subpar rounds represented some
outstanding golf and that the best team (USC) still won and the
second best team (Stanford) still finished second, but the tournament
was deprived of some of the excitement and challenge provided by a
championship calibre golf course.

The Indian seems to have died pretty quietly as the mascot of
Stanford's athletic teams (except for some occasional slips by KSFO
announcers Don Klein and Bob Murphy during last fall's football
season), but the Indian returned in Wednesday's edition of the San
Francisco Chronicle. Chronicle sportswriter Darrell Wilson wrote that
Stanford track coach Payton Jordan "hopes that freshman Terry
Albritton can win the shot put and that several Indians can break
through the mass of talent for points" at the Pac-8 track meet.

Linebacker Jim Merlo, the most valuable player on Stanford's 1972
football team, has signed a three-year contract with the New Orleans
Saints of the National Football League.
Merlo, the Saints' fourth round draft choice, wouldn't reveal any
figures, but said that his contract was reportedly more lucrative than
any of the 15 fourth round draft choices who had already signed.
