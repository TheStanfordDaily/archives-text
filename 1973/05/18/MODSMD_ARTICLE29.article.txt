# Card Netters Swamp Oregon, Face UCLA In Pac-8's Today
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Having disposed of weak
Oregon 9-0 yesterday, Stanford's
tennis team must go to work
today when it plays UCLA in the
semifinals of the Pacific Eight
tennis championships at USC.
The Cards are favored in the 1
p.m. semifinal match against the
tough Bruins for, in practical
terms, the right to meet USC for
the league crown Saturday.
In other matches yesterday at
David Marks Stadium in Los
Angeles, UCLA beat Washington
7-2, and USC whitewashed
Washington State 9-0. The
California-Oregon State result was
unavailable. Whichever team won,
however, USC will have no
trouble beating them tomorrow.
Stanford's win was noteworthy
only in that the Cardinals did not
lose more than three games in any
one set. Highlights of the 9 a.m.
battle were 6-0, 6-0 wins by Jim
Delaney (second singles), and Pat
DuPre (fourth).

Also winning were Sandy
Mayer (first), Rick Fisher (third),
Chip Fisher (fifth), John
Whitlinger (sixth), and the
Mayer-Delaney, R. Fisher-Gery
Groslimond, and DuPre-Whitlinger
doubles teams.
Stanford's lineup will be the
same today. UCLA is also
expected to play the lineup they
used in downing the Huskies:
Singles players (in order) are
Bob Kreiss, Jeff Austin, Steve
Krulevitz, Brian Teacher, Rayno
Seegers, and Steve Mott.
Doubles pairings are
Kreiss-Austin, Krulevitz-Seegers,
and Teacher-Mott.
Yesterday, Kreiss lost at first
singles, and he and Austin
forfeited at first doubles, possibly

in that Kreiss has not recovered
from the wrist injury' which, three
weeks ago, forced his exit from
the Ojai tourney.
USC definitely has an injured
player — third singles star Mike
Machette. However, Trojans'
publicity office said that
Machette, who has an ankle
injury, will play in tomorrow's
final match.
Thus, the USC lineup that
Stanford is likely to face looks
like this:
Singles (in order): Raul
Ramirez, John Andrews,
Machette, Sashi Menon, John
Holladay, and Michael Wayman.
Doubles: Ramirez-Machette,
Menon-Andrews, and
Holladay-Dave Borelli.

semifinals of the Pacific Eight
tennis championships at USC.
The Cards are favored in the 1
p.m. semifinal match against the
tough Bruins for, in practical
terms, the right to meet USC for
the league crown Saturday.
In other matches yesterday at
David Marks Stadium in Los
Angeles, UCLA beat Washington
7-2, and USC whitewashed
Washington State 9-0. The
California-Oregon State result was
unavailable. Whichever team won,
however, USC will have no
trouble beating them tomorrow.
Stanford's win was noteworthy
only in that the Cardinals did not
lose more than three games in any
one set. Highlights of the 9 a.m.
battle were 6-0, 6-0 wins by Jim
Delaney (second singles), and Pat
DuPre (fourth).

Also winning were Sandy
Mayer (first), Rick Fisher (third),
Chip Fisher (fifth), John
Whitlinger (sixth), and the
Mayer-Delaney, R. Fisher-Gery
Groslimond, and DuPre-Whitlinger
doubles teams.
Stanford's lineup will be the
same today. UCLA is also
expected to play the lineup they
used in downing the Huskies:
Singles players (in order) are
Bob Kreiss, Jeff Austin, Steve
Krulevitz, Brian Teacher, Rayno
Seegers, and Steve Mott.
Doubles pairings are
Kreiss-Austin, Krulevitz-Seegers,
and Teacher-Mott.
Yesterday, Kreiss lost at first
singles, and he and Austin
forfeited at first doubles, possibly

in that Kreiss has not recovered
from the wrist injury' which, three
weeks ago, forced his exit from
the Ojai tourney.
USC definitely has an injured
player — third singles star Mike
Machette. However, Trojans'
publicity office said that
Machette, who has an ankle
injury, will play in tomorrow's
final match.
Thus, the USC lineup that
Stanford is likely to face looks
like this:
Singles (in order): Raul
Ramirez, John Andrews,
Machette, Sashi Menon, John
Holladay, and Michael Wayman.
Doubles: Ramirez-Machette,
Menon-Andrews, and
Holladay-Dave Borelli.
