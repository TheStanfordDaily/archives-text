# Second Round Of Housing Draw Keeps 700 Students Unassigned
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
The results of round two of the
1973 spring undergraduate housing
draw, released yesterday, were a relief
to some, but a disappointment to
many. Of the 3084 students who
entered the second round (325 less
than were in round one), 700 — 386
men and 314 women — remained
unassigned.
The cutoff numbers rose slightly in
round two: from 2485 in round one to
2994 for men, and from 3297 to 3358
for women.
In all, 2386 spaces were available in
the second round. Forty-one were
reserved for transfer students, and the
remaining 2345 were assigned
according to draw number.
Round Two Spaces
Manzanita Park was the only
residence with a large number of
spaces available in round two: 120 for
women and 148 for men. Eucalypto,
Jordan, and Lambda Nu had no new
assignments, and many other
residences had five or less.
All groups of four students who
applied for Manzanita were assigned
trailers. In addition, all female groups
of three and one group of two were
assigned places.
Students who were assigned at the
end of round two and wish to accept
their space, must sign a residence
agreement in their current residence
office before June 1, if they have not
already done so. Students who do not
want to accept their assignment should
notify the Housing Office so that their
space can be reassigned to another
student.
Ten Dollar Fee
Any student who was assigned in
round two and chooses not to accept
the assignment, or anyone who accepts
the assignment and cancels it before
August 1, is obligated to pay a $10
administrative fee.
Any person assigned, either through
the draw or a waiting list, who cancels
the assignment after August 1, must
forfeit the $50 housing deposit which
secured that space.
Waiting lists are the next hope for
the 700 unassigned students who want
a place in the residence system.
Not Yet
However, they will not be available
for signing before May 24. Between

that date and June 1, students who
participated in the draw will have
waiting list priority according to draw
number.
Anyone who wishes to claim this
priority must sign the waiting lists in
the Housing Office, Old Union, before
June 1.
After that date, priority for
assignments from waiting lists will be
based on the date of application.
All waiting lists, except those for
independent houses and special
programs are located in the Housing
Office. There are two types of waiting
lists: inter-residence switches for
students who are assigned, but wish to
be reassigned to another residence, and
assignment into the residence system

for students who are not assigned, but
wish to be.
Fraternities
A few possibilities remain for those
who are unassigned, besides waiting
lists. Several fraternities will have
spaces for boarders next year.
The University maintains a Rental
Housing Information Office to assist
students, as well as faculty and staff, in
finding accommodations in Palo Alto
and surrounding communities.
More information concerning the
housing draw and waiting lists is
available in each residence office. A
roster, listing all students from that
residence who participated in round
two and their assignments, is also
posted there.

Ten Dollar Fee
Any student who was assigned in
round two and chooses not to accept
the assignment, or anyone who accepts
the assignment and cancels it before
August 1, is obligated to pay a $10
administrative fee.
Any person assigned, either through
the draw or a waiting list, who cancels
the assignment after August 1, must
forfeit the $50 housing deposit which
secured that space.
Waiting lists are the next hope for
the 700 unassigned students who want
a place in the residence system.
Not Yet
However, they will not be available
for signing before May 24. Between

that date and June 1, students who
participated in the draw will have
waiting list priority according to draw
number.
Anyone who wishes to claim this
priority must sign the waiting lists in
the Housing Office, Old Union, before
June 1.
After that date, priority for
assignments from waiting lists will be
based on the date of application.
All waiting lists, except those for
independent houses and special
programs are located in the Housing
Office. There are two types of waiting
lists: inter-residence switches for
students who are assigned, but wish to
be reassigned to another residence, and
assignment into the residence system

for students who are not assigned, but
wish to be.
Fraternities
A few possibilities remain for those
who are unassigned, besides waiting
lists. Several fraternities will have
spaces for boarders next year.
The University maintains a Rental
Housing Information Office to assist
students, as well as faculty and staff, in
finding accommodations in Palo Alto
and surrounding communities.
More information concerning the
housing draw and waiting lists is
available in each residence office. A
roster, listing all students from that
residence who participated in round
two and their assignments, is also
posted there.
The results of round two of the
1973 spring undergraduate housing
draw, released yesterday, were a relief
to some, but a disappointment to
many. Of the 3084 students who
entered the second round (325 less
than were in round one), 700 — 386
men and 314 women — remained
unassigned.
The cutoff numbers rose slightly in
round two: from 2485 in round one to
2994 for men, and from 3297 to 3358
for women.
In all, 2386 spaces were available in
the second round. Forty-one were
reserved for transfer students, and the
remaining 2345 were assigned
according to draw number.
Round Two Spaces
Manzanita Park was the only
residence with a large number of
spaces available in round two: 120 for
women and 148 for men. Eucalypto,
Jordan, and Lambda Nu had no new
assignments, and many other
residences had five or less.
All groups of four students who
applied for Manzanita were assigned
trailers. In addition, all female groups
of three and one group of two were
assigned places.
Students who were assigned at the
end of round two and wish to accept
their space, must sign a residence
agreement in their current residence
office before June 1, if they have not
already done so. Students who do not
want to accept their assignment should
notify the Housing Office so that their
space can be reassigned to another
student.
