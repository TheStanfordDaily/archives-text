Kissinger Ordered Phone Taps?
WASHINGTON — Some former staff members of the
National Security Council say Henry A. Kissinger ordered
phonetaps on aides and newsmen when Kissinger himself
was the prime source of leaks.
Kissinger denied to newsmen on at least two occasions
that he initiated the electronic surveillance of members of
his staff or newsmen, but he acknowledged talking about
leaks and ways to stop them with then FBI Director J.
Edgar Hoover.
However, the sources, who served on the NSC both
during and after the 1969-70 period in which the phone
taps were used, say Kissinger himself provided the names
of the men he wanted checked.
One of the former NSC staffers said at least two of the
newsmen whose phone conversations were listened to had
direct and frequent access to Kissinger and much of their
reporting was based on what he told them.
The newsmen were CBS diplomatic correspondent
Marvin Kalb and London Sunday Times correspondent
Henry Brandon. The sources say Kalb particularly was
given sensitive information by Kissinger dealing with
Vietnam, the Mideast and other areas they say involved
national security.
Among the NSC staffers who were eavesdropped on
was Winston Lord, a key aide to Kissinger, Helmut
Sonnenfeld, recently nominated as undersecretary of the
treasury, and Morton Halperin, an agency consultant who
left in 1971.

TAMPA, Fla. — Donald H. Segretti pleaded innocent
yesterday to charges of distributing a phony campaign
letter during the Florida presidential primary that accused
two Democratic candidates of sexual misconduct.
Segretti, a 28-year-old California lawyer and Nixon
campaign figure, was given 30 days to file motions on the
two-count indictment.
The indictment was returned by a federal grand jury in
Orlando on May 4 accusing Segretti of publishing and
distributing an anonymous campaign letter and conspiracy
to distribute it. Both counts are misdemeanors, punishable
by a maximum of one year in jail and $1,000 in fines.
Tampa attorney Raymond LaPorte represented Segretti
during the brief hearing before U.S. Magistrate Paul Game.
He advised his client not to make any statements.
"You keep asking him questions and it puts him in a
difficult position," said LaPorte, admonishing a crowd of
newsmen as he ushered Segretti to the U.S. marshal's
office for fingerprinting. "He doesn't want to be rude to
anybody ... he's not that type."
Prosecutor To Have A Free Hand"
WASHINGTON — Atty. Gen.-designate Elliot Richardson
promised yesterday that the special prosecutor picked to
handle the Watergate case in the courtroom would have a
free hand.
Richardson said the yet-to-be-named special prosecutor
would have complete freedom to investigate and
prosecute anyone he thinks necessary in the political
espionage and sabotage case.
At the same time, it was learned that Richardson had
widened his search for the special prosecutor by adding at
least three and possibly as many as five new names to the
list of prospects.
The new names, which were not revealed, join Justice
William H. Erickson, 49, of the Colorado Supreme Court
and David W. Peck, retired New York state appellate
judge.
Two previous candidates, Warren M. Christopher, a
former deputy attorney general, and New York federal
judge Harold R. Tyler Jr., had told Richardson they
weren't interested.
But Richardson may have made the job more attractive
as well as mollifying some Senate critics with his
announcement of the job specification and guidelines for
the prosecutor role. Many senators had said the
prosecutor should be completely clear of administration
influence in an investigation that will include the White
House.
In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee,
Richardson softened his earlier public attitude and met all
of the conditions the members had suggested. He said the
special prosecutor would have the power to frame
indictments and decide "whether or not to prosecute any
individual firm, corporation or group of individuals."
At the White House yesterday, Press Secretary Ronald
L. Ziegler said "it is totally and completely in the hands
of Mr. Richardson" as to whether Richardson might
exercise some control over the prosecutor but he said
Richardson was free to grant total independence.
Kissinger-Tho Open New Talks
PARIS — With a display of mutual cordiality, U.S.
presidential security adviser Henry A. Kissinger and

Hanoi's Le Due Tho opened a new series of talks
yesterday to firm up the Vietnam peace agreement they
negotiated last winter.
They were in a relaxed and smiling mood as they
conferred behind closed doors for five hours and agreed to
resume their talks this afternoon.
Kissinger also will meet today with President Georges
Pompidou to discuss preparations for talks between
President Nixon and Pompidou in Iceland May 31-June 1,
the White House and the French government announced.
Corporate Profits Surge Upward
WASHINGTON — Before-tax corporate profits
sky-rocketed by $11.6 billion to near-record levels in the
first three months of this year, the Commerce Department
reported yesterday.
The figures were not good news for the Nixon
administration. They show that U.S. industry has
prospered since the lifting of the Phase 2 mandatory price
controls at the same time prices have been rising sharply
throughout the economy.
Union leaders are sure to use the figures as ammunition
during contract negotiations with many major industries
later this year.
The before-tax corporate profits were more than
double the fourth-quarter increase of $5.8 billion last year
and second only to the record increase of $11.7 billion in
the first quarter of 1971, a post-recession year.
In addition, revised statistics showed that inflation
increased at a whopping 6.6 percent rate during the first
three months, instead of the 6 percent reported earlier. It
was the largest such increase since 13 percent in the first
quarter of 1951.
Skylab Repair Delayed Again
CAPE KENNEDY — A repair mission to the Skylab space
station, scheduled to begin Sunday, was put off for
another five days yesterday to allow the astronauts to
train for a space walking roof repair job on the sweltering
orbital laboratory.
An announcement said that Skylab 1 astronauts Charles
Conrad Jr., Dr. Joseph P. Kerwin and Paul J. Weitz will be
launched at 6:02 a.m. PDT, Friday, May 25, carrying with
them the tools and materials to attach a sun shade on
Skylab.
John Discher, the deputy Skylab program director, said
the delay was made possible because engineers have been
able to stabilize the heat buildup in the troubled $294
million space station.
Mission Control experts bought the extra time by
orienting the space station with one side away from the
sun. This caused temperatures in the craft to drop from an
average of 100 to 110 to an average of 90 to 105.
Conrad, Kerwin and Weitz practiced yesterday the
techniques they will use to install the sun shade. The
Car Bomb Kills Three In Belfast
BELFAST — A car bomb killed at least three people and
mutilated two others today in an upsurge of Northern
Ireland violence.
Two men were shot dead in other incidents, and
underground guerrillas of the Irish Republican Army
threatened to wreck Belfast Airport and all planes using it.

astronauts had to learn to perform both of two suggested
methods of attaching the sun shield.
The bomb erupted in a car park at Omagh, County
Tyrone, as a dance was breaking up. Rescue workers
found pieces of bodies strewn over the car park and an
adjoining field.
Five men were about to get into the car when it
exploded.
In Belfast, a 30-year-old Roman Catholic was shot dead
as he played darts in a pub, and two 14-year-old
schoolgirls were wounded, one critically, by shots
apparently aimed at a British armored car.
Close to the border with the republic at Pettigo,
County Fermanagh, a man was shot dead by police who
said he fled a road check. He was identified as Michael
Joseph Leonard, a 22-year-old cattle dealer from County
Donegal in the Irish republic.
Pilots of major British airlines called an emergency
meeting to decide on action in the face of the militant
Provisional IRA's threat to blow up Belfast's Aldergrove
Airport.
The threat followed the discovery of two bombs on the
runways early yesterday. One exploded, causing minor
damage. The other was defused.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow, except low clouds along the coast
spreading inland night and mornings. Slightly cooler
today. Low tonight in the low 50s. Highs today and
tomorrow from near 60 along the coast to the upper 60s
to mid 70s inland. Westerly wind 10 to 20 mph in
afternoons.

Kissinger Ordered Phone Taps?
WASHINGTON — Some former staff members of the
National Security Council say Henry A. Kissinger ordered
phonetaps on aides and newsmen when Kissinger himself
was the prime source of leaks.
Kissinger denied to newsmen on at least two occasions
that he initiated the electronic surveillance of members of
his staff or newsmen, but he acknowledged talking about
leaks and ways to stop them with then FBI Director J.
Edgar Hoover.
However, the sources, who served on the NSC both
during and after the 1969-70 period in which the phone
taps were used, say Kissinger himself provided the names
of the men he wanted checked.
One of the former NSC staffers said at least two of the
newsmen whose phone conversations were listened to had
direct and frequent access to Kissinger and much of their
reporting was based on what he told them.
The newsmen were CBS diplomatic correspondent
Marvin Kalb and London Sunday Times correspondent
Henry Brandon. The sources say Kalb particularly was
given sensitive information by Kissinger dealing with
Vietnam, the Mideast and other areas they say involved
national security.
Among the NSC staffers who were eavesdropped on
was Winston Lord, a key aide to Kissinger, Helmut
Sonnenfeld, recently nominated as undersecretary of the
treasury, and Morton Halperin, an agency consultant who
left in 1971.

TAMPA, Fla. — Donald H. Segretti pleaded innocent
yesterday to charges of distributing a phony campaign
letter during the Florida presidential primary that accused
two Democratic candidates of sexual misconduct.
Segretti, a 28-year-old California lawyer and Nixon
campaign figure, was given 30 days to file motions on the
two-count indictment.
The indictment was returned by a federal grand jury in
Orlando on May 4 accusing Segretti of publishing and
distributing an anonymous campaign letter and conspiracy
to distribute it. Both counts are misdemeanors, punishable
by a maximum of one year in jail and $1,000 in fines.
Tampa attorney Raymond LaPorte represented Segretti
during the brief hearing before U.S. Magistrate Paul Game.
He advised his client not to make any statements.
"You keep asking him questions and it puts him in a

Prosecutor To Have A Free Hand"
WASHINGTON — Atty. Gen.-designate Elliot Richardson
promised yesterday that the special prosecutor picked to
handle the Watergate case in the courtroom would have a
free hand.
Richardson said the yet-to-be-named special prosecutor
would have complete freedom to investigate and
prosecute anyone he thinks necessary in the political
espionage and sabotage case.
At the same time, it was learned that Richardson had
widened his search for the special prosecutor by adding at
least three and possibly as many as five new names to the
list of prospects.
The new names, which were not revealed, join Justice
William H. Erickson, 49, of the Colorado Supreme Court
and David W. Peck, retired New York state appellate
judge.
Two previous candidates, Warren M. Christopher, a
former deputy attorney general, and New York federal
judge Harold R. Tyler Jr., had told Richardson they
weren't interested.
But Richardson may have made the job more attractive
as well as mollifying some Senate critics with his
announcement of the job specification and guidelines for
the prosecutor role. Many senators had said the
prosecutor should be completely clear of administration
influence in an investigation that will include the White
House.
In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee,
Richardson softened his earlier public attitude and met all
of the conditions the members had suggested. He said the
special prosecutor would have the power to frame
indictments and decide "whether or not to prosecute any
individual firm, corporation or group of individuals."
At the White House yesterday, Press Secretary Ronald
L. Ziegler said "it is totally and completely in the hands
of Mr. Richardson" as to whether Richardson might
exercise some control over the prosecutor but he said
Richardson was free to grant total independence.
Kissinger-Tho Open New Talks
PARIS — With a display of mutual cordiality, U.S.
presidential security adviser Henry A. Kissinger and

Hanoi's Le Due Tho opened a new series of talks
yesterday to firm up the Vietnam peace agreement they
negotiated last winter.
They were in a relaxed and smiling mood as they
conferred behind closed doors for five hours and agreed to
resume their talks this afternoon.
Kissinger also will meet today with President Georges

President Nixon and Pompidou in Iceland May 31-June 1,
the White House and the French government announced.
Corporate Profits Surge Upward
WASHINGTON — Before-tax corporate profits
sky-rocketed by $11.6 billion to near-record levels in the
first three months of this year, the Commerce Department
reported yesterday.
The figures were not good news for the Nixon
administration. They show that U.S. industry has
prospered since the lifting of the Phase 2 mandatory price
controls at the same time prices have been rising sharply
throughout the economy.
Union leaders are sure to use the figures as ammunition
during contract negotiations with many major industries
later this year.
The before-tax corporate profits were more than
double the fourth-quarter increase of $5.8 billion last year
and second only to the record increase of $11.7 billion in
the first quarter of 1971, a post-recession year.
In addition, revised statistics showed that inflation
increased at a whopping 6.6 percent rate during the first
three months, instead of the 6 percent reported earlier. It
was the largest such increase since 13 percent in the first
quarter of 1951.
Skylab Repair Delayed Again
CAPE KENNEDY — A repair mission to the Skylab space
station, scheduled to begin Sunday, was put off for
another five days yesterday to allow the astronauts to
train for a space walking roof repair job on the sweltering
orbital laboratory.
An announcement said that Skylab 1 astronauts Charles
Conrad Jr., Dr. Joseph P. Kerwin and Paul J. Weitz will be
launched at 6:02 a.m. PDT, Friday, May 25, carrying with
them the tools and materials to attach a sun shade on
Skylab.
John Discher, the deputy Skylab program director, said
the delay was made possible because engineers have been
able to stabilize the heat buildup in the troubled $294
million space station.
Mission Control experts bought the extra time by
orienting the space station with one side away from the
sun. This caused temperatures in the craft to drop from an
average of 100 to 110 to an average of 90 to 105.
Conrad, Kerwin and Weitz practiced yesterday the
techniques they will use to install the sun shade. The

Skylab Repair Delayed Again
CAPE KENNEDY — A repair mission to the Skylab space
station, scheduled to begin Sunday, was put off for
another five days yesterday to allow the astronauts to
train for a space walking roof repair job on the sweltering
orbital laboratory.
An announcement said that Skylab 1 astronauts Charles
Conrad Jr., Dr. Joseph P. Kerwin and Paul J. Weitz will be
launched at 6:02 a.m. PDT, Friday, May 25, carrying with
them the tools and materials to attach a sun shade on
Skylab.
John Discher, the deputy Skylab program director, said
the delay was made possible because engineers have been
able to stabilize the heat buildup in the troubled $294
million space station.
Mission Control experts bought the extra time by
orienting the space station with one side away from the
sun. This caused temperatures in the craft to drop from an
average of 100 to 110 to an average of 90 to 105.
Conrad, Kerwin and Weitz practiced yesterday the

Car Bomb Kills Three In Belfast
BELFAST — A car bomb killed at least three people and
mutilated two others today in an upsurge of Northern
Ireland violence.
Two men were shot dead in other incidents, and
underground guerrillas of the Irish Republican Army
threatened to wreck Belfast Airport and all planes using it.

astronauts had to learn to perform both of two suggested
methods of attaching the sun shield.
The bomb erupted in a car park at Omagh, County
Tyrone, as a dance was breaking up. Rescue workers
found pieces of bodies strewn over the car park and an
adjoining field.
Five men were about to get into the car when it
exploded.
In Belfast, a 30-year-old Roman Catholic was shot dead
as he played darts in a pub, and two 14-year-old
schoolgirls were wounded, one critically, by shots
apparently aimed at a British armored car.
Close to the border with the republic at Pettigo,
County Fermanagh, a man was shot dead by police who
said he fled a road check. He was identified as Michael
Joseph Leonard, a 22-year-old cattle dealer from County
Donegal in the Irish republic.
Pilots of major British airlines called an emergency
meeting to decide on action in the face of the militant
Provisional IRA's threat to blow up Belfast's Aldergrove
Airport.
The threat followed the discovery of two bombs on the
runways early yesterday. One exploded, causing minor
damage. The other was defused.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow, except low clouds along the coast
spreading inland night and mornings. Slightly cooler

Kissinger Ordered Phone Taps?
WASHINGTON — Some former staff members of the
National Security Council say Henry A. Kissinger ordered
phonetaps on aides and newsmen when Kissinger himself
was the prime source of leaks.
Kissinger denied to newsmen on at least two occasions
that he initiated the electronic surveillance of members of
his staff or newsmen, but he acknowledged talking about
leaks and ways to stop them with then FBI Director J.
Edgar Hoover.
However, the sources, who served on the NSC both
during and after the 1969-70 period in which the phone
taps were used, say Kissinger himself provided the names
of the men he wanted checked.
One of the former NSC staffers said at least two of the
newsmen whose phone conversations were listened to had
direct and frequent access to Kissinger and much of their
reporting was based on what he told them.
The newsmen were CBS diplomatic correspondent
Marvin Kalb and London Sunday Times correspondent
Henry Brandon. The sources say Kalb particularly was
given sensitive information by Kissinger dealing with
Vietnam, the Mideast and other areas they say involved
national security.
Among the NSC staffers who were eavesdropped on
was Winston Lord, a key aide to Kissinger, Helmut
Sonnenfeld, recently nominated as undersecretary of the
treasury, and Morton Halperin, an agency consultant who
left in 1971.

TAMPA, Fla. — Donald H. Segretti pleaded innocent
yesterday to charges of distributing a phony campaign
letter during the Florida presidential primary that accused
two Democratic candidates of sexual misconduct.
Segretti, a 28-year-old California lawyer and Nixon
campaign figure, was given 30 days to file motions on the
two-count indictment.
The indictment was returned by a federal grand jury in
Orlando on May 4 accusing Segretti of publishing and
distributing an anonymous campaign letter and conspiracy
to distribute it. Both counts are misdemeanors, punishable
by a maximum of one year in jail and $1,000 in fines.
Tampa attorney Raymond LaPorte represented Segretti
during the brief hearing before U.S. Magistrate Paul Game.
He advised his client not to make any statements.
"You keep asking him questions and it puts him in a

Prosecutor To Have A Free Hand"
WASHINGTON — Atty. Gen.-designate Elliot Richardson
promised yesterday that the special prosecutor picked to
handle the Watergate case in the courtroom would have a
free hand.
Richardson said the yet-to-be-named special prosecutor
would have complete freedom to investigate and
prosecute anyone he thinks necessary in the political
espionage and sabotage case.
At the same time, it was learned that Richardson had
widened his search for the special prosecutor by adding at
least three and possibly as many as five new names to the
list of prospects.
The new names, which were not revealed, join Justice
William H. Erickson, 49, of the Colorado Supreme Court
and David W. Peck, retired New York state appellate
judge.
Two previous candidates, Warren M. Christopher, a
former deputy attorney general, and New York federal
judge Harold R. Tyler Jr., had told Richardson they
weren't interested.
But Richardson may have made the job more attractive
as well as mollifying some Senate critics with his
announcement of the job specification and guidelines for
the prosecutor role. Many senators had said the
prosecutor should be completely clear of administration
influence in an investigation that will include the White
House.
In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee,
Richardson softened his earlier public attitude and met all
of the conditions the members had suggested. He said the
special prosecutor would have the power to frame
indictments and decide "whether or not to prosecute any
individual firm, corporation or group of individuals."
At the White House yesterday, Press Secretary Ronald
L. Ziegler said "it is totally and completely in the hands
of Mr. Richardson" as to whether Richardson might
exercise some control over the prosecutor but he said
Richardson was free to grant total independence.
Kissinger-Tho Open New Talks
PARIS — With a display of mutual cordiality, U.S.
presidential security adviser Henry A. Kissinger and

Hanoi's Le Due Tho opened a new series of talks
yesterday to firm up the Vietnam peace agreement they
negotiated last winter.
They were in a relaxed and smiling mood as they
conferred behind closed doors for five hours and agreed to
resume their talks this afternoon.
Kissinger also will meet today with President Georges
Pompidou to discuss preparations for talks between
President Nixon and Pompidou in Iceland May 31-June 1,
the White House and the French government announced.
Corporate Profits Surge Upward
WASHINGTON — Before-tax corporate profits
sky-rocketed by $11.6 billion to near-record levels in the
first three months of this year, the Commerce Department
reported yesterday.
The figures were not good news for the Nixon
administration. They show that U.S. industry has
prospered since the lifting of the Phase 2 mandatory price
controls at the same time prices have been rising sharply
throughout the economy.
Union leaders are sure to use the figures as ammunition
during contract negotiations with many major industries
later this year.
The before-tax corporate profits were more than
double the fourth-quarter increase of $5.8 billion last year
and second only to the record increase of $11.7 billion in
the first quarter of 1971, a post-recession year.
In addition, revised statistics showed that inflation
increased at a whopping 6.6 percent rate during the first
three months, instead of the 6 percent reported earlier. It
was the largest such increase since 13 percent in the first
quarter of 1951.

Kissinger-Tho Open New Talks
PARIS — With a display of mutual cordiality, U.S.
presidential security adviser Henry A. Kissinger and

Hanoi's Le Due Tho opened a new series of talks
yesterday to firm up the Vietnam peace agreement they
negotiated last winter.
They were in a relaxed and smiling mood as they
conferred behind closed doors for five hours and agreed to
resume their talks this afternoon.
Kissinger also will meet today with President Georges
Pompidou to discuss preparations for talks between
President Nixon and Pompidou in Iceland May 31-June 1,
the White House and the French government announced.
Corporate Profits Surge Upward
WASHINGTON — Before-tax corporate profits
sky-rocketed by $11.6 billion to near-record levels in the
first three months of this year, the Commerce Department
reported yesterday.
The figures were not good news for the Nixon
administration. They show that U.S. industry has
prospered since the lifting of the Phase 2 mandatory price
controls at the same time prices have been rising sharply
throughout the economy.
Union leaders are sure to use the figures as ammunition
during contract negotiations with many major industries
later this year.
The before-tax corporate profits were more than
double the fourth-quarter increase of $5.8 billion last year
and second only to the record increase of $11.7 billion in
the first quarter of 1971, a post-recession year.
In addition, revised statistics showed that inflation
increased at a whopping 6.6 percent rate during the first
three months, instead of the 6 percent reported earlier. It
was the largest such increase since 13 percent in the first
quarter of 1951.
Skylab Repair Delayed Again
CAPE KENNEDY — A repair mission to the Skylab space
station, scheduled to begin Sunday, was put off for
another five days yesterday to allow the astronauts to
train for a space walking roof repair job on the sweltering
orbital laboratory.
An announcement said that Skylab 1 astronauts Charles
Conrad Jr., Dr. Joseph P. Kerwin and Paul J. Weitz will be
launched at 6:02 a.m. PDT, Friday, May 25, carrying with
them the tools and materials to attach a sun shade on
Skylab.
John Discher, the deputy Skylab program director, said
the delay was made possible because engineers have been
able to stabilize the heat buildup in the troubled $294
million space station.
Mission Control experts bought the extra time by
orienting the space station with one side away from the
sun. This caused temperatures in the craft to drop from an
average of 100 to 110 to an average of 90 to 105.
Conrad, Kerwin and Weitz practiced yesterday the
techniques they will use to install the sun shade. The
Car Bomb Kills Three In Belfast
BELFAST — A car bomb killed at least three people and
mutilated two others today in an upsurge of Northern
Ireland violence.
Two men were shot dead in other incidents, and
underground guerrillas of the Irish Republican Army
threatened to wreck Belfast Airport and all planes using it.

astronauts had to learn to perform both of two suggested
methods of attaching the sun shield.
The bomb erupted in a car park at Omagh, County
Tyrone, as a dance was breaking up. Rescue workers
found pieces of bodies strewn over the car park and an
adjoining field.
Five men were about to get into the car when it
exploded.
In Belfast, a 30-year-old Roman Catholic was shot dead
as he played darts in a pub, and two 14-year-old
schoolgirls were wounded, one critically, by shots
apparently aimed at a British armored car.
Close to the border with the republic at Pettigo,
County Fermanagh, a man was shot dead by police who
said he fled a road check. He was identified as Michael
Joseph Leonard, a 22-year-old cattle dealer from County
Donegal in the Irish republic.
Pilots of major British airlines called an emergency
meeting to decide on action in the face of the militant
Provisional IRA's threat to blow up Belfast's Aldergrove
Airport.
The threat followed the discovery of two bombs on the
runways early yesterday. One exploded, causing minor
damage. The other was defused.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow, except low clouds along the coast
spreading inland night and mornings. Slightly cooler
today. Low tonight in the low 50s. Highs today and
tomorrow from near 60 along the coast to the upper 60s
to mid 70s inland. Westerly wind 10 to 20 mph in
afternoons.
Kissinger Ordered Phone Taps?
WASHINGTON — Some former staff members of the
National Security Council say Henry A. Kissinger ordered
phonetaps on aides and newsmen when Kissinger himself
was the prime source of leaks.
Kissinger denied to newsmen on at least two occasions
that he initiated the electronic surveillance of members of
his staff or newsmen, but he acknowledged talking about
leaks and ways to stop them with then FBI Director J.
Edgar Hoover.
However, the sources, who served on the NSC both
during and after the 1969-70 period in which the phone
taps were used, say Kissinger himself provided the names
of the men he wanted checked.
One of the former NSC staffers said at least two of the
newsmen whose phone conversations were listened to had
direct and frequent access to Kissinger and much of their
reporting was based on what he told them.
The newsmen were CBS diplomatic correspondent
Marvin Kalb and London Sunday Times correspondent
Henry Brandon. The sources say Kalb particularly was
given sensitive information by Kissinger dealing with
Vietnam, the Mideast and other areas they say involved
national security.
Among the NSC staffers who were eavesdropped on
was Winston Lord, a key aide to Kissinger, Helmut
Sonnenfeld, recently nominated as undersecretary of the
treasury, and Morton Halperin, an agency consultant who
left in 1971.

TAMPA, Fla. — Donald H. Segretti pleaded innocent
yesterday to charges of distributing a phony campaign
letter during the Florida presidential primary that accused
two Democratic candidates of sexual misconduct.
Segretti, a 28-year-old California lawyer and Nixon
campaign figure, was given 30 days to file motions on the
two-count indictment.
The indictment was returned by a federal grand jury in
Orlando on May 4 accusing Segretti of publishing and
distributing an anonymous campaign letter and conspiracy
to distribute it. Both counts are misdemeanors, punishable
by a maximum of one year in jail and $1,000 in fines.
Tampa attorney Raymond LaPorte represented Segretti
during the brief hearing before U.S. Magistrate Paul Game.
He advised his client not to make any statements.
"You keep asking him questions and it puts him in a
difficult position," said LaPorte, admonishing a crowd of
newsmen as he ushered Segretti to the U.S. marshal's
office for fingerprinting. "He doesn't want to be rude to
anybody ... he's not that type."
Prosecutor To Have A Free Hand"
WASHINGTON — Atty. Gen.-designate Elliot Richardson
promised yesterday that the special prosecutor picked to
handle the Watergate case in the courtroom would have a
free hand.
Richardson said the yet-to-be-named special prosecutor
would have complete freedom to investigate and
prosecute anyone he thinks necessary in the political
espionage and sabotage case.
At the same time, it was learned that Richardson had
widened his search for the special prosecutor by adding at
least three and possibly as many as five new names to the
list of prospects.
The new names, which were not revealed, join Justice
William H. Erickson, 49, of the Colorado Supreme Court
and David W. Peck, retired New York state appellate
judge.
Two previous candidates, Warren M. Christopher, a
former deputy attorney general, and New York federal
judge Harold R. Tyler Jr., had told Richardson they
weren't interested.
But Richardson may have made the job more attractive
as well as mollifying some Senate critics with his
announcement of the job specification and guidelines for
the prosecutor role. Many senators had said the
prosecutor should be completely clear of administration
influence in an investigation that will include the White
House.
In a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee,
Richardson softened his earlier public attitude and met all
of the conditions the members had suggested. He said the
special prosecutor would have the power to frame
indictments and decide "whether or not to prosecute any
individual firm, corporation or group of individuals."
At the White House yesterday, Press Secretary Ronald
L. Ziegler said "it is totally and completely in the hands
of Mr. Richardson" as to whether Richardson might
exercise some control over the prosecutor but he said
Richardson was free to grant total independence.
