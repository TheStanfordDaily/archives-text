# Course Review Out Soon
## 
### 
The long-planned ASSU Course Review will go on
sale early next week, ASSU Vice President Jim
Friend said yesterday. Price for the Review will be
$1 for students and $2 for non-students, and copies
will be available at the Bookstore and the ASSU
office.
Co-editor Kevin Smith said the Review was
designed to be both "a shopping guide for students"
and an opportunity for professors to gauge student
reaction to their classes.
The 160-page publication covers some 280
courses that were offered last autumn and winter
quarters. No spring quarter classes were evaluated.
Smith and co-editors Stephen Carter and Melody
Broadbent did a major portion of the work on the
project, although a staff of more than 50 people
aided them in preparing and assembling the course
evaluations of various departments.
The evaluations will also include brief essays on
each course, as well as pertinent comments from
students who have already taken the course.
"The last thing people want to read is a dry,
statistical summary," declares Smith. However, all
the raw data used in assembling the Review will be
available for inspection in the ASSU office.
Former Vice President Brent Appel co-ordinated
the program for the ASSU this year.
"It will take us a while to build up a reputation,"
said Carter, who thinks that students will need some
exposure to the Review before they seriously begin
to use it in choosing classes.
