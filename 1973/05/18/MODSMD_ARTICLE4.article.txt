# Grad Schools' Recruitment Affects Minority Enrollment
## 
### LARRY FLEECE (Second of two parts) 
Minority student enrollment in Stanford's graduate
programs varies widely among the separate graduate
schools, and depends largely on the enthusiasm of each
school toward minority recruiting, according to Assistant
Dean of Graduate Studies Thom Rhue.
Together with Maria Baeza, assistant to the dean,
Rhue's major responsibility is coordinating the
recruitment of minority students to Stanford's graduate
programs.
"When you talk about graduate admissions of any
kind," Rhue said, "You're talking about at least 65
different admissions policies. Various departments
respond differently to the University commitment for
minority enrollment."
Since 1968-69, the number of black and Chicano
graduate students has increased from 77 to 400, while
total graduate enrollment has declined slightly from 5244
to 4962. In addition, there are now 22 Native American
graduate students and about 100 Asian Americans.
Varies Greatly
But Rhue pointed out that while minority students
make up almost nine percent of the graduate student
body, the percentage varies greatly from school to school.
In the School of Education, for example, minority
enrollment is 18 percent, while in the School of Earth
Sciences it is seven-tenths of one percent.
"It's almost impossible to generalize about admissions
on the graduate level," Rhue said. "For instance, some
departments concentrate on Graduate Record exam scores
for admission, whereas other departments may hardly use
the scores at all.
"But overall, the impact of the University commitment
to minority students is clear. I would estimate that not
more than a half-dozen major graduate schools across the

nation have higher minority student percentages â€” and
perhaps not even that many," Rhue said.
No Quotas
Although there are no quotas of any kind for minority
admissions, Rhue feels that "it is impossible to talk about
increased minority enrollment without talking about
goals." Rhue's fear is that without more clearly outlined
goals concerning minority enrollment, a false sense of
satisfaction and accomplishment may prevail. "After
hearing about minority problems for four years, people
may be thinking that the problem is solved. The faculty
may be tired of the issue."
Rhue acknowledged the steps being taken to aid
minority students financially. "To some extent, there is
preferential treatment in this respect." He cited the
University policy under which graduate minority students
in humanities, sciences, and social sciences are granted
half of their first-year fellowships in University funds.
"But the most difficult implication of any question
about minority admissions," Rhue said, "is the inference
that a graduate student is here either because he's
competent, or because he's black.
"These two conditions are not mutually exclusive,"
Rhue emphasized. He said that in the short period which
graduate minority students have had to prove themselves,
"the survival rate of minority students seems to be better
than that of whites."
Mixed Feelings
Rhue expressed mixed feelings about the influence, on
minority enrollment of such measures as the affirmative
action resolution passed this week by the Faculty Senate
advocating greater effort on the graduate level toward
attracting women and minority students.
"The strength of the resolution," Rhue said, "is that it
gives faculty endorsement to affirmative action.
Obviously, the faculty wield a great deal of power and
influence, and their concern is valuable."
But Rhue termed the resolution "vague," and said, "My
reservation is in the way the resolution lumps women's
and minority issues together." He said that both women
and minorities deserve special attention and consideration,
but that each group's problems are unique, and should be
kept separate.
Different Situation
"Women have been discriminated against, and they will
go back and pursue their careers in white, professional
communities. The situation is different with minority
students who return to the ghetto, barrio, or reservation,"
Rhue said.
(Presently, there are 4069 men enrolled in graduate
education, and 892 women.)
Discussing the demands of the Chicano Law Students
Association (CLSA) for increased Chicano hiring and
admissions, recently rejected by Law School Dean
Thomas Ehrlich, Rhue said, "The 'elitism' of students in
the University can be defined in two ways: first, elitism in
their social and economic backgrounds; and second,
elitism in their ability to handle the academic workload.
"The CLSA simply wants to separate these definitions,
and to recruit and enroll minority students who fit the
second 'elitist' definition, but not necessarily the first."
Rhue said that the direction of the work of Maria
Baeza, chief recruiter for Chicano graduate students, has
been toward greater attention to the needs and problems
of the Chicano community at large.
