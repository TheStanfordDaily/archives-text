# New Campus Telephone System To Begin Operation In 1974
## 
### CHESS ERWIN 
A new, larger campus telephone
network, the Centrex system, will be
in operation by April, 1974, according
to Oley Killingsworth, the
Communications Supervisor in the
Plant Services office.
Killingsworth said that the new
system would consolidate the phone
networks of the Stanford Hospital and
Medical Center, Hansen Labs, and the
Electronics Labs with those of the rest
of the University. The only exception,
he noted, will be the SLAC phone
system, which will remain separate.
In order to accommodate the new
equipment and increased size of the
Centrex system, a new building is
under construction in the Plant
Services area on Bonair Siding. The
present facility is located on Panama
Street northeast of the Old Union.
Killingsworth estimated that
construction of the building and
installation of the equipment will cost
about $720,000.
Edna Barnes, chief University
telephone operator, said that the
Centrex system was designed to divert
calls past the University switchboard.

except when a caller didn't know a
phone number or needed information.
The University will have its own
exchange rather than sharing one with
other parties.
The new exchange will be 497
instead of 321. By dialing 497-2300, a
caller will get a University operator if
he needs assistance. Otherwise, by
using the 497 exchange and a four
digit extension number, persons calling
from outside the University can
telephone any University number
directly.
Inter-office calls will be handled
somewhat differently under the new
system, stated Killingsworth. Rather
than dialing a University extension
directly, a person must dial "7" and
then the extension with the Centrex
system, he said.
"About 80 percent of the phones
will maintain their old extension
numbers under the Centrex system,"
Killingsworth commented.
The Centrex system will also permit
University callers to telephone
"anywhere in the world, simply by
dialing '9' and then the area code and
number they want," said

Killingsworth. "Under the present
system, off-campus calls are limited to
a single message unit area," he
explained.
Barnes added that "it will be the
responsibility of each department on
campus to see to it that the new
system is used properly and not
abused." She noted that in the past
her department had had little
difficulty with people who misuse the
phone system.
"We have simply outgrown the old
system," explained Killingsworth.
"The new building is constructed
where it can be readily expanded when
that is necessary. We want to avoid
getting locked into a system that can't
be changed," he said.
Presently, the University phone
system is accommodating
approximately 5400 lines. "We're
building the new system for the same
number of lines that we have now. The
capacity of the new building will be
7600 lines, which should be enough to
last ten years or so. If in the future we
adopt a new system or reach 7600
lines, we can expand by adding on to
the new complex," concluded
Killingsworth.

CENTREX — Some of the University's operators may not be so busy after the
Centrex system becomes operational in April 1974. Centrex will consolidate
phone networks of the Stanford Hospital, Hansen Labs and the Electronics Labs
and will facilitate calling into specific extensions from outside the University.
