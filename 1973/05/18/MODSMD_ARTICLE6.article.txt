# Those 'RA' Blues
## An Old West Analogy 
### 
Jerry Coleman

The prairie dogs were moving
out. It was Springtime and they
were heading west for their annual
burrow-occupying ceremony in
the frontier territories. Only this
year there were rumors that the
Burrow Resident Committee had
changed the ground rules, and
that lots of the prairie dogs were
in for some disappointment.
After a long, grueling march
that eliminated some of their
number from the running, the
prairie dogs finally reached the
territorial outpost. Actually, they
only got to the outskirts of the
outpost, because of the unusually
large crowds already in town.
The little critters soon received
a second surprise when they
discovered that not all those in
town were prairie dogs; it seemed
that there were three types of
holes being occupied: one for
them, one for the ground hogs,
and one for the lil* doagies.
So Complicated?
"Why are things so
complicated this year? whinned
one prairie dog. "Shhh — the
Governor of the Territory's about
to speak; he'll clear things up,"
said another.
"My dear little burrow
dwellers," the Governor began, "it
is with great sadness in my heart
that I must inform you of the
situation at hand: there are many
openings in the ground, but even
so, there just aren't enough
burrows to go around.
"Now I'm sure you're aware of
this scarcity: it's this way every
year. But we've decided to change
the occupying ceremony a bit to
give you every possible chance of
finding a compatible hole. This
years, all of you will be asked to
speak to the Chief Law Officer in
the part of the territory you'd
most like to burrow.
Bon Chance
"In fact," continued the
Governor, "you can speak with as
many Sheriffs and Marshals and
Constables as you'd like, so as to 1
maximize your chances of getting
any burrow. Good luck to you all,
and if you have any questions or
suggestions for how to run the
ceremony next year, hop on over
to my office."
Was there a commotion of
barking in the outpost that night!
The small creatures were busily
planning all the burrow
subdivisions they'd try out for,
and their shouts of destinations
for the coming days rose higher
than the flames of the campfire:
"Laramie!" "Fort Dodge!"
"Cheyenne!" "Virginia City!"
"Dry Gulch!"
"Dry Gulch? What you wanta
go to Dry Gulch fer?" asked an

aged ground hog who'd been to so
many ceremonies he'd earned the
name 'Pops.' "You youngins don't
know what you're talking about —
I bet you done caught a touch of
the fever from this here campfire.
Why — there's only outlaws living
round the Dry Gulch burrows:
outlaws and drifters who don't
give a hoot fer you being 'round."
Little Balls
"I knows it!" replied a brash
lil' doagie, "And I reckon that'll
give me a better chance of finding
a burrow." With that remark, his
fellow doagies whooped their
approval, prompting 'Pop' to utter
his now-famous slogan, "Get
along lil' doagies." After much
chuckles and barking all around,
the critters calmed down and
curled into sleepy little balls of
fur.
But the night's merriment soon
turned into the day's despair, as
Sheriff after Sheriff were
confronted by the same 70 or 80
critters hopping after the four
burrows in their towns. "Ain't I
seen you at one of these
meetings?" became a familiar line
of dialogue among the prairie
dogs, whose desperation grew as
long as the setting sun's shadows.
The ground hogs were in better
shape: some of them had been in
certain burrows last year and were
allowed to keep them a year
longer.
You Woz Gone!
In one town, the Chief Law
Officer was walking down the
street when a familiar little
ground hog limped up to him and
said, "Marshal Dillon—? Marshal
Dillon! I been with you a long
time, ain't I? And I took care of
town fer you when you woz gone,
so can I have my very own

burrow, Marshal Dillon?"
The handsome lawman leaned
down and replied, "I reckon so,
Limpy. And if I give the burrow
to you, that's one less burrow to
have to give to a stranger."
By the end of Spring, all the
burrows had been ceremoniously
occupied, but amid great
confusion and disappointment
from those not fortunate enough
to have found an opening. "It's
the system's fault, not mine,
shouted 'Pop' who had been
rejected for the seventh spring
straight: "the way they set it up, I
didn't have a dog's chance!"
One stray doagie was yelping
quietly in the corner of
Tombstone's main square, when
the Sheriff's wife walked out of
the general store and noticed him.
"Don't cry, lil' feller," she said,
consoling him; "You're all so cute
and cuddly and we had so very
hard a decision to make, between
you and the others."
The doagie wiped his eyes with
one paw, then started down the
main street toward the town
sheriff standing about 100 yards
away. "What do I do now, Mr.
Erp?" asked the doagie of the
lawman who stood rigid, his hands
at his sides. Came his reply: "This
town ain't big enough for the
both of us, doagie .. . DRAW!"
Sadly, the doagie put his paw
into the cardboard box the Sheriff
held out for him, and drew out a
number ... number 4789. "Just
ain't my day,"he mumbled as he
turned tail and slunk out of the
territory.

Was there a commotion of
barking in the outpost that night!
The small creatures were busily
planning all the burrow
subdivisions they'd try out for,
and their shouts of destinations
for the coming days rose higher
than the flames of the campfire:
"Laramie!" "Fort Dodge!"
"Cheyenne!" "Virginia City!"
"Dry Gulch!"
"Dry Gulch? What you wanta
go to Dry Gulch fer?" asked an

aged ground hog who'd been to so
many ceremonies he'd earned the
name 'Pops.' "You youngins don't
know what you're talking about —
I bet you done caught a touch of
the fever from this here campfire.
Why — there's only outlaws living
round the Dry Gulch burrows:
outlaws and drifters who don't
give a hoot fer you being 'round."
Little Balls
"I knows it!" replied a brash
lil' doagie, "And I reckon that'll
give me a better chance of finding
a burrow." With that remark, his
fellow doagies whooped their
approval, prompting 'Pop' to utter
his now-famous slogan, "Get
along lil' doagies." After much
chuckles and barking all around,
the critters calmed down and
curled into sleepy little balls of
fur.
But the night's merriment soon
turned into the day's despair, as
Sheriff after Sheriff were
confronted by the same 70 or 80
critters hopping after the four
burrows in their towns. "Ain't I
seen you at one of these
meetings?" became a familiar line
of dialogue among the prairie
dogs, whose desperation grew as
long as the setting sun's shadows.
The ground hogs were in better
shape: some of them had been in
certain burrows last year and were
allowed to keep them a year
longer.
You Woz Gone!
In one town, the Chief Law
Officer was walking down the
street when a familiar little
ground hog limped up to him and
said, "Marshal Dillon—? Marshal
Dillon! I been with you a long
time, ain't I? And I took care of
town fer you when you woz gone,
so can I have my very own

burrow, Marshal Dillon?"
The handsome lawman leaned
down and replied, "I reckon so,
Limpy. And if I give the burrow
to you, that's one less burrow to
have to give to a stranger."
By the end of Spring, all the
burrows had been ceremoniously
occupied, but amid great
confusion and disappointment
from those not fortunate enough
to have found an opening. "It's
the system's fault, not mine,
shouted 'Pop' who had been
rejected for the seventh spring
straight: "the way they set it up, I
didn't have a dog's chance!"
One stray doagie was yelping
quietly in the corner of
Tombstone's main square, when
the Sheriff's wife walked out of
the general store and noticed him.
"Don't cry, lil' feller," she said,
consoling him; "You're all so cute
and cuddly and we had so very
hard a decision to make, between
you and the others."
The doagie wiped his eyes with
one paw, then started down the
main street toward the town
sheriff standing about 100 yards
away. "What do I do now, Mr.
Erp?" asked the doagie of the
lawman who stood rigid, his hands
at his sides. Came his reply: "This
town ain't big enough for the
both of us, doagie .. . DRAW!"
Sadly, the doagie put his paw
into the cardboard box the Sheriff
held out for him, and drew out a
number ... number 4789. "Just
ain't my day,"he mumbled as he
turned tail and slunk out of the
territory.

The prairie dogs were moving
out. It was Springtime and they
were heading west for their annual
burrow-occupying ceremony in
the frontier territories. Only this
year there were rumors that the
Burrow Resident Committee had
changed the ground rules, and
that lots of the prairie dogs were
in for some disappointment.
After a long, grueling march
that eliminated some of their
number from the running, the
prairie dogs finally reached the
territorial outpost. Actually, they
only got to the outskirts of the
outpost, because of the unusually
large crowds already in town.
The little critters soon received
a second surprise when they
discovered that not all those in
town were prairie dogs; it seemed
that there were three types of
holes being occupied: one for
them, one for the ground hogs,
and one for the lil* doagies.

I bet you done caught a touch of
the fever from this here campfire.
Why — there's only outlaws living
round the Dry Gulch burrows:
outlaws and drifters who don't
give a hoot fer you being 'round."
Little Balls
"I knows it!" replied a brash
lil' doagie, "And I reckon that'll
give me a better chance of finding
a burrow." With that remark, his
fellow doagies whooped their
approval, prompting 'Pop' to utter
his now-famous slogan, "Get
along lil' doagies." After much
chuckles and barking all around,
the critters calmed down and
curled into sleepy little balls of
fur.
But the night's merriment soon
turned into the day's despair, as
Sheriff after Sheriff were
confronted by the same 70 or 80
critters hopping after the four
burrows in their towns. "Ain't I
seen you at one of these
meetings?" became a familiar line
of dialogue among the prairie
dogs, whose desperation grew as
long as the setting sun's shadows.
The ground hogs were in better
shape: some of them had been in
certain burrows last year and were
allowed to keep them a year
longer.
You Woz Gone!
In one town, the Chief Law
Officer was walking down the
street when a familiar little
ground hog limped up to him and
said, "Marshal Dillon—? Marshal
Dillon! I been with you a long
time, ain't I? And I took care of
town fer you when you woz gone,
so can I have my very own

burrow, Marshal Dillon?"
The handsome lawman leaned
down and replied, "I reckon so,
Limpy. And if I give the burrow
to you, that's one less burrow to
have to give to a stranger."
By the end of Spring, all the
burrows had been ceremoniously
occupied, but amid great
confusion and disappointment
from those not fortunate enough
to have found an opening. "It's
the system's fault, not mine,
shouted 'Pop' who had been
rejected for the seventh spring
straight: "the way they set it up, I
didn't have a dog's chance!"
One stray doagie was yelping
quietly in the corner of
Tombstone's main square, when
the Sheriff's wife walked out of
the general store and noticed him.
"Don't cry, lil' feller," she said,
consoling him; "You're all so cute
and cuddly and we had so very
hard a decision to make, between
you and the others."
The doagie wiped his eyes with
one paw, then started down the
main street toward the town
sheriff standing about 100 yards
away. "What do I do now, Mr.
Erp?" asked the doagie of the
lawman who stood rigid, his hands
at his sides. Came his reply: "This
town ain't big enough for the
both of us, doagie .. . DRAW!"
Sadly, the doagie put his paw
into the cardboard box the Sheriff
held out for him, and drew out a
number ... number 4789. "Just
ain't my day,"he mumbled as he
turned tail and slunk out of the
territory.

The prairie dogs were moving
out. It was Springtime and they
were heading west for their annual
burrow-occupying ceremony in
the frontier territories. Only this
year there were rumors that the
Burrow Resident Committee had
changed the ground rules, and
that lots of the prairie dogs were
in for some disappointment.
After a long, grueling march
that eliminated some of their
number from the running, the
prairie dogs finally reached the
territorial outpost. Actually, they
only got to the outskirts of the
outpost, because of the unusually
large crowds already in town.
The little critters soon received
a second surprise when they
discovered that not all those in
town were prairie dogs; it seemed
that there were three types of
holes being occupied: one for
them, one for the ground hogs,
and one for the lil* doagies.
So Complicated?
"Why are things so
complicated this year? whinned
one prairie dog. "Shhh — the
Governor of the Territory's about
to speak; he'll clear things up,"
said another.
"My dear little burrow
dwellers," the Governor began, "it
is with great sadness in my heart
that I must inform you of the
situation at hand: there are many
openings in the ground, but even
so, there just aren't enough
burrows to go around.
"Now I'm sure you're aware of
this scarcity: it's this way every
year. But we've decided to change
the occupying ceremony a bit to
give you every possible chance of
finding a compatible hole. This
years, all of you will be asked to
speak to the Chief Law Officer in
the part of the territory you'd
most like to burrow.
Bon Chance
"In fact," continued the
Governor, "you can speak with as
many Sheriffs and Marshals and
Constables as you'd like, so as to 1
maximize your chances of getting
any burrow. Good luck to you all,
and if you have any questions or
suggestions for how to run the
ceremony next year, hop on over
to my office."
Was there a commotion of
barking in the outpost that night!
The small creatures were busily
planning all the burrow
subdivisions they'd try out for,
and their shouts of destinations
for the coming days rose higher
than the flames of the campfire:
"Laramie!" "Fort Dodge!"
"Cheyenne!" "Virginia City!"
"Dry Gulch!"
"Dry Gulch? What you wanta
go to Dry Gulch fer?" asked an

aged ground hog who'd been to so
many ceremonies he'd earned the
name 'Pops.' "You youngins don't
know what you're talking about —
I bet you done caught a touch of
the fever from this here campfire.
Why — there's only outlaws living
round the Dry Gulch burrows:
