# 'Now' Image
## Stereotyping And Dollies 
### 
Charlene Peterson

Again, Stanford University has
caused my head to spin in
bewilderment. In this particular
instance I am referring to the
article in the Stanford Daily of
May 14, entitled "Apolitical
Dollies Resent 'Aloof' Image."
This year Stanford's Dollies
seem to be united by a common
cause. They seem to be struggling
for personal identity and
individualism. Their cry is similar
this year to the Frat Man's cry
against "stereotyping." Linda

Thomas has come out against
"ignorance." and Jackie Nelson
echoes her sentiments.
Yes, it is a valid criticism that
stereotypeing can be a bias and
prejudice against individualism. So
let us now recall some of the
Dollies' statements in support of
themselves and their supposed
"new image."
Apolitical
First of all, they claim to be
apolitical. "In politics, I'm
ignorant," said Marcella Deffke,
and then continues by
stereotyping herself as a "liberal
conservative." The article goes on
to quote Stephanie Jubina who
says that she reads the "sports
page first, if she reads the
newspaper at all."
In this one paragraph alone the
Dollies imply that they have no
interest in or knowledge of
contemporary events. Their
corsages and ice cream cones
reveal their lack of feeling and
awareness about issues such as
Vietnam, Watergate, or the
struggle of the Third World
against oppression.
In the next several paragraphs
of the Daily the Dollies do not
even go on to talk about their
intellectual, although apolitical,
enthusiasms and excitements.
They speak of college in terms of
their "major" and their lack of
"career ambition," and then seem
to imply that they are in school
merely for the thrill of dance and
exhibition.
Even the Dollies' views on
Christianity express the feeling
that Christianity exits for the
suppression and traditional
stereotyping of women, and that
Christianity should most certainly
not be a struggle to change the
corrupt values of our
contemporary society.

It is incredible how these
"Dollies" have stereotyped
themselves in a harsher, more
extreme way than even I would
catagorize them in my
imagination's most embittered
harangue.
Never, before this time, would
I have said that the Stanford
Dollies were all: 1) "conservative"
and "ignorant" politically, 2)
seeming to have little career or
personal ambition after
graduation, 3) Californian "cutsie
boopsies," 4) find nothing to
criticize about Stanford or
themselves, 5) Repressive
Christians, active in the Campus
Crusade for Christ, 6) hold the
most traditional views on the role
stereotyping of women, and
finally 7) admit themselves to
being docile and submissive to the
male, who is, of course, the
natural agressor and leader.
People in turn will say that I fit
a particular stereotype. And this is
true. I belong to that group within
society who considers themselves
totally alienated from the
philosophy of the "liberal
conservative." These people cry
for freedom and individuality
while at the same time they work
to confine their thought processes
to a limited spectrum of android
behavior.
They are the people who
applaud with capitalistic fervor
the buying, selling, and usury of
themselves and others within
society. Yes, folks, they are the
same ones who have made
possible the bombing of
Southewast Asia as well as the
Watergate incident.

being docile and submissive to the
male, who is, of course, the
natural agressor and leader.
People in turn will say that I fit
a particular stereotype. And this is
true. I belong to that group within
society who considers themselves
totally alienated from the
philosophy of the "liberal
conservative." These people cry
for freedom and individuality

to confine their thought processes
to a limited spectrum of android
behavior.
They are the people who
applaud with capitalistic fervor
the buying, selling, and usury of
themselves and others within
society. Yes, folks, they are the
same ones who have made
possible the bombing of
Southewast Asia as well as the
Watergate incident.

Again, Stanford University has
caused my head to spin in
bewilderment. In this particular
instance I am referring to the
article in the Stanford Daily of
May 14, entitled "Apolitical
Dollies Resent 'Aloof' Image."
This year Stanford's Dollies
seem to be united by a common
cause. They seem to be struggling
for personal identity and
individualism. Their cry is similar
this year to the Frat Man's cry
against "stereotyping." Linda

Thomas has come out against
"ignorance." and Jackie Nelson
echoes her sentiments.
Yes, it is a valid criticism that
stereotypeing can be a bias and
prejudice against individualism. So
let us now recall some of the
Dollies' statements in support of
themselves and their supposed
"new image."
Apolitical
First of all, they claim to be
apolitical. "In politics, I'm
ignorant," said Marcella Deffke,
and then continues by
stereotyping herself as a "liberal
conservative." The article goes on
to quote Stephanie Jubina who
says that she reads the "sports
page first, if she reads the
newspaper at all."
In this one paragraph alone the
Dollies imply that they have no
interest in or knowledge of
contemporary events. Their
corsages and ice cream cones
reveal their lack of feeling and
awareness about issues such as
Vietnam, Watergate, or the
struggle of the Third World
against oppression.
In the next several paragraphs
of the Daily the Dollies do not
even go on to talk about their
intellectual, although apolitical,
enthusiasms and excitements.
They speak of college in terms of
their "major" and their lack of
"career ambition," and then seem
to imply that they are in school
merely for the thrill of dance and
exhibition.
Even the Dollies' views on
Christianity express the feeling
that Christianity exits for the
suppression and traditional
stereotyping of women, and that
Christianity should most certainly
not be a struggle to change the
corrupt values of our
contemporary society.

It is incredible how these
"Dollies" have stereotyped
themselves in a harsher, more
extreme way than even I would
catagorize them in my
imagination's most embittered
harangue.
Never, before this time, would
I have said that the Stanford
Dollies were all: 1) "conservative"
and "ignorant" politically, 2)
seeming to have little career or
personal ambition after
graduation, 3) Californian "cutsie
boopsies," 4) find nothing to
criticize about Stanford or
themselves, 5) Repressive
Christians, active in the Campus
Crusade for Christ, 6) hold the
most traditional views on the role
stereotyping of women, and
finally 7) admit themselves to
being docile and submissive to the
male, who is, of course, the
natural agressor and leader.
