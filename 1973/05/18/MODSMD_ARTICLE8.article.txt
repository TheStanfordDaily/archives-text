# Stanford Highly Pressured
## Only Another Cry 
### 
Scott Morrison

It was very refreshing to read Cliff Spiro's recent comment on the
"self-centered nature of the typical Stanford student and his petty
manifestations," but, unfortunately, I couldn't help feel that his plea
for a more humane and brotherly attitude on campus was only
another lonely cry into the darkness which envelops us all in America.
For Stanford, as well as any other educational institution, is merely an
extension of the American society which we ars all a part, no matter
how much we try to escape from it.
We are not isolated from the "real world" as many Stanford
students believe; instead, its problems are our problems. We bring to
Stanford the same zealous competitiveness, the same prejudice, the
same values that are the source of most, if not all, of the problems
that we as a nation face today. This whole school is geared to
assimilate us into a highly pressurized and ridiculously competitive
society where the fruits of monetary success buy our happiness for us,
and where the drive for profits over-shadows any concern for human
fellowship.
We live in the midst of America's distorted priorities here on
campus â€” students cheat as a way of life because the competition to
stay alive academically is so great. I don't need to remind you of what
happens during exams. Life and death rest in the fate of the G.P.A.
And look at the price we pay. Bikes, cars, dorm rooms, houses,
practically everything that we possess must be chained, bolted, and
barred in order to deter people from ripping us off. We live in fear of
our brother instead of with him. And can we hope that the pressures
that create the cold and hectic atmosphere at Stanford will cease to
exist once we leave here?
Won't they actually get worse under the intensity of urban life and
the cut-throat consciousness of the business community? If we can't
"slow down, relax, enjoy, care" now, how are we ever going to do it
once we become the older generation?
We don't have to live this way. Maybe it's about time that we
questioned our own motivations as well as society's. If now is not the
time to re-order America's priorities, when is?
