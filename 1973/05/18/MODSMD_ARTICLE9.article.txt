# Become A Columnist
## 
### 
Want to do something meaningful next year? Whether you do or
not, why not also become a Stanford Daily columnist. You'll join that
elite fraternity of scribes who week after week try to be clever,
influential, biting, and above all, verbose.
To apply, simply leave a note in the box of the current opinion
editors giving your name, phone number, and what sort of column
you'd like to write â€” humor, political, fiction, or sanskrit translation.
You'll be asked to show some exemplars of your work.
