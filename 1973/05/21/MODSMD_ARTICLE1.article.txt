# Muslim Speech Denial Challenged
## BSU Protests Kelly Decision 
### ROBERT BACON 
About 50 members of the Black
Students Union (BSU) demonstrated
at Memorial Church yesterday,
protesting Chapel Dean Robert G.H.
Kelly's refusal last week to permit a
Black Muslim minister to speak in the
Church.
BSU Chairman Charles Ogletree
read a statement outlining the BSU
position to the congregation during
the 11 a.m. worship service, after
Kelly had briefly outlined his position.
Earlier, the BSU members had
picketed in front of the Church,
chanting slogans.
Last week, Kelly declined to permit
Black Muslim minister John
Muhammad to speak in the Church,
saying that he wished to discuss the
Black Muslim religion — particularly
what he called its "racist aspect" —

with the promoters of the Muhammad
appearance.
Ridiculous
The BSU statement read by
Ogletree yesterday said that it was
"ridiculous" that Muhammad was not
permitted to speak in the Church
when many "controversial political
figures" have recently made addresses
there.
Ogletree also complained that "one
individual [Kelly] is allowed to
determine what's right" in the use of
the Church.
The BSU requested "that the
University and Directors of Memorial
Church consider the feasibility of
including Islam as a regular part of the
religious services held in Memorial
Church."
After the service, Kelly said that at
present the only groups regularly using

the church were the church's own staff
and campus Roman Catholics. Before
another religious group were offered
use of the facilities, he said, "we
would have to think about it and
discuss it."
Exile
Prior to introducing Ogletree during
the service, Kelly stated that "I am in
voluntary exile from [South] Africa
because of my opposition to
racism .. . Racism is very heavy on my
mind.
"I cannot in good conscience and in
obedience to my Lord allow a
representative of any organization that
has racism in its basic creed, to speak
in this church," he continued.
The statement which Ogletree read
insisted that, by his own admission,

CHURCH CONFRONTATION — Tony Briscoe (in white jacket) outlines to fellow Black Students Union (BSU)
members the procedures for their demonstration at Memorial Church yesterday. A few minutes later, about 50 BSU
members marched into the Church during morning worship services to insist that Black Muslim John Muhammad be
permitted to make a speech in the Church. BSU Chairman Charles Ogletree stands at Briscoe's right.
