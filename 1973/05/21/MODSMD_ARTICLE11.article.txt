# Forgotten Undergraduates?
## Asian Americans 
### 
I could only express chagrin
upon reading Larry Fleece's May
17 article headlined, "Minority
Enrollment Percentages Remain
The Same." It parodies exactly
those themes of "insensitivity and
inconsistency" which a previous
article (May 1), "On
Asian-American Admissions,"
asked the question: "Why does
Stanford University include
Asian-Americans as an ethnic
minority when citing progress in
its Affirmative Action (minority
hiring) programs, when it does not
consider them as a minority in its
undergraduate admission
policies?"
Mr. Fleece has quoted the
Dean of Admissions as saying in
reference to eligibility quotas:
"The University has a
committment to encourage the
enrollment of students from the
three minority groups .. ." (italics
added). My point of contention is
not over the issue of quotas, but
over the recognition of the three
minority groups, i.e.
Afro-Americans, Chicanos, and
Native Americans.
Indeed Mr. Fleece has seen fit
to exclude from his discussion one
of the largest groups in the Bay
Area, Asian-Americans. That Mr.
Fleece did not pursue this line of
inquiry in his interviews with
administration officials is
understandable on at least two
points: 1) his disregard or
apparent ignorance of the Asian
Students' Admissions
Subcommittee's Daily article of
May 1; 2) the non-existence of
data from the Office of
Undergraduate Admissions.
Audacity?
In addition to this, in what can
be interpreted as either an
innocent act of reporting or
unmitigated audacity, Mr. Fleece
follows up with a quote from
President Richard W. Lyman:
"Stanford is committed to
bringing members of minority
groups into full participation in
the life of the institution."
"Vigorous recruitment
programs, adequate financial aid,
and appropriate curricular and
co-curricular programs are
essential parts of that
committment."
These are fine words, worthy
of any traditionally liberal
institution, but their value as a
theoretical structure suffers from
a lack of practice. Hence, it may
very well be that the Asian
Students' charge that Stanford's
ethnic minority policies have been
"reactions designed to placate
demands, rather than to address
problems," is a valid one, and that
the "Stanford administration does
not understand the special needs
of the Asian-American
community."
Problems In Chinatown
What are these problems?
Take, for example, San
Francisco's Chinatown. Of the

u
approximately 35,000
predominantly Chinese residents
of the area:
1) 40% of Chinese families earn
less than the Federal poverty level
of $4,000 a year. 75% earn less
than $6,000.
2) Two-thirds of the adults
have below a seventh-grade
education, the, median years of
schooling at roughly 1.7 years.
The last school was built in 1925.
3) Unemployment (as of 1970)
was 12.8% versus 6.7% for the rest
of San Francisco.
4) Approximately 10,000
citizens need Medicare and cannot
afford it.
5) 82% of the people live in
three rooms or less. 60% share
bathrooms or have none.
6) 26% live in "overcrowded
conditions" (defined by the US
census bureau as 1.1 persons or
more per room), encompassing
3,700 housing units in which
there are 17,800 residences.
7) For Chinese living in
Chinatown the TB rate is four
times that of the rest of the city.
8) The suicide rate has ranged
since 1954 from two to six times
the overall city rate. (Sources: San
Francisco Department of City
Planning, S.F. Chinatown and
Housing Program, March 1972.
Atlantic, March 1970. Newsweek,
Feb. 1970.)
I do not wish to dispute
Stanford's desire or right to range
over 40 states to recruit
minority-student applicants from
locales other than its own
backyard. It is merely being
indicated for the second time that
there exists a problem of
inconcistency in the University's
defining and dealing with the
"socio-economically
disadvantaged minorities."
'Made It?'
What I can only interpret,
given the information provided by
the article on minority enrollment
is that the University deems the
nature of its "commitment" (?) to
Asian-Americans as satisfactory to
the point of exclusion from
further considerations. Although
the bulk of Asian-Americans are
neither economically
disadvantaged, nor residents of
the Asian ghettoes, Stanford
would probably not fail to point
out that "Orientals" are heavily
represented within the
undergraduate student body.
The only problem in using
upper and upper-middle income
Asian-Americans as showcase
ethnic enrollment, however, is
that it fosters the myth that the
majority of Asian-Americans have
"made it." This is clearly not the
case and to promulgate this myth
is to deny the existence of entire
"gilded ghettoes" across the
United States.
