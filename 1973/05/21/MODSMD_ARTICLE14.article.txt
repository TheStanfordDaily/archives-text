## 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
The Stanford track team ended
its 1973 conference season on a
disappointing note Saturday as
the Cards walked away from the
14th Pac-8 championship meet in
last place with 25 points.
To no one's surprise, UCLA
took the league title with a record
156 points, USC knocked out
Oregon in the final event to take
second with 111 to the Ducks'
110. Washington State was fourth
(88), Oregon State fifth (78),
Washington sixth (34), and
California seventh (26).
Competition began Friday
morning with the first five events
of the decathlon. At the end of
the first day, Stanford's Kenny
Kring was in third place behind
Oregon's Craig Brigham and
UCLA's Sam Albanese.
Afternoon finals included the
shotput, where favored Terry
Albritton could manage only fifth
for the Cards at 59-21\ behind
Oregon State's Mac Wilkins, who
had a lifetime best of 63-7. Tony
Sandoval placed sixth in the
six-mile at 29:28.4.
Williams Jumps 27-9
In other finals, Leonard Hill of
Oregon State won the
steeplechase in 8:43. Francois
Tracanelli of UCLA won the pole
vault at 17 feet. Randy Williams,
the Olympic gold medalist in the
long jump from USC,
overwhelmed the rest of the field
with a wind-aided 27-9. Jim Judd
of Oregon State was the surprise
winner in the javelin at 250-0.
In qualifying heats for the
finals Saturday, Ken Curl ran an
outstanding wind-aided 9.4 100
and a legal 21.1 in the 220. Dave
Bagshaw qualified in the high
hurdles with a lifetime best of
14.0.
Saturday's finals began with
the completion of the final five
decathlon events. Kring moved up
to second with a 7124 total
behind Brigham's 7673.
The mile, as distance coach
Marshall Clark had predicted,
turned out to be a very
competitive race. Hailu Ebba of
Oregon State nosed out Oregon's
Knut Kvalheim as both were
clocked at 3:57.9. Oregon's Mark
Feig came in third less than a
second ahead of Stanford's Brian
Mittelstaedt. Mittelstaedt came

within a stride of becoming
Stanford's second four minute
miler as he crossed the finish line
in a lifetime best 4:00.1.
The only other Stanford points
came in the sprints. Curl took
fourth in the 100 as he and the
other three top finishers were all
timed in 9.6, led by USC's Don
Quarrie. Quarrie also won the 220
in 20.7, and Curl picked up six
points for the Cards with a
lifetime best of 21.0 for third.
Saturday's highlight came in
the 880 where Cal's Rick Brown
set meet, track, and school
records with a lifetime best of
1:46.7. UCLA's Milan Tiff took
the triple jump title with a
tremendous 54-3V6 leap. Wilkins
of Oregon State followed his shot
win with a 199-9 victory in the
discus.
The Bruins' Benny Brown won
the 440 in 46.2. Tom Woods won
the high jump for Oregon State at
seven feet. USC won the 440 relay
in 39.9.
USC's Jerry Wilson led the
field in the high hurdles at 13.6.
Jeff Oveson of Oregon State was
an upset victor in the intermediate
hurdles at 51.3. Oregon's Steve

Saturday's best-of-five match against Wilt's "Big Dippers."Stanford
lost three games to one.
The Stanford track team ended
its 1973 conference season on a
disappointing note Saturday as
the Cards walked away from the
14th Pac-8 championship meet in
last place with 25 points.
To no one's surprise, UCLA
took the league title with a record
156 points, USC knocked out
Oregon in the final event to take
second with 111 to the Ducks'
110. Washington State was fourth
(88), Oregon State fifth (78),
Washington sixth (34), and
California seventh (26).
Competition began Friday
morning with the first five events
of the decathlon. At the end of
the first day, Stanford's Kenny
Kring was in third place behind
Oregon's Craig Brigham and
UCLA's Sam Albanese.
Afternoon finals included the
shotput, where favored Terry
Albritton could manage only fifth
for the Cards at 59-21\ behind
Oregon State's Mac Wilkins, who
had a lifetime best of 63-7. Tony
Sandoval placed sixth in the
six-mile at 29:28.4.

outstanding wind-aided 9.4 100
and a legal 21.1 in the 220. Dave
Bagshaw qualified in the high
hurdles with a lifetime best of
14.0.
Saturday's finals began with
the completion of the final five
decathlon events. Kring moved up
to second with a 7124 total

The mile, as distance coach
Marshall Clark had predicted,
turned out to be a very
competitive race. Hailu Ebba of
Oregon State nosed out Oregon's
Knut Kvalheim as both were
clocked at 3:57.9. Oregon's Mark
Feig came in third less than a
second ahead of Stanford's Brian
Mittelstaedt. Mittelstaedt came
