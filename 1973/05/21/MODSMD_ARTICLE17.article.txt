# Wilt's Volleyballers Win In Four Games
## Big Dippers Impress Stanford Fans 
### PETE BHATIA 
Wilt Chamberlain's Big Dippers
did exactly what they intended to
do Friday night, as they made
their debut performance in the
Bay Area. With their excellent
performance, the Dippers made it
clear to all in attendance that
volleyball really is a viable major
sport on all levels.
Performing before a crowd of
over 3000 new volleyball fans in
Maples Pavilion, the Dippers hit
and show boated their way to a
15-5, 10-15, 15-9, 15-11 victory
over the Stanford volleyball team.
In the preliminary game,
Stanford's women's team came
back from an early deficit, largely
on the hitting and blocking of
Kathy Nilsson, to defeat the
Hayward Women's Volleyball

Club, 15-11.
The Dipper match was actually
a measure of how well Stanford
could overcome the other three
players on the floor besides the
7-0 Chamberlain. Wilt, despite his
size, was the worst volleyball
player on the floor for the
Dippers, but considering the fact
that the others on the court were
among the best in the world,
that's not so bad.
