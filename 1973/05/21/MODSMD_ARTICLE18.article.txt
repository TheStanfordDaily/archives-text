# Women Win Net Playoffs
## 
### 
Stanford's women's tennis
team won 17 out of 18 individual
matches Saturday on the women's
courts, cruising to an easy victory
over three other schools in the
Northern California
Intercollegiate Athletic
Conference playoffs.
The Cards defeated Fresno
State 6-0, California 6-0, and UC
Davis 5-1 in the round <*obin event
which matched the top two teams
from each NCIAC division.
Stanford finished with 17 points,
followed by Cal and UC Davis
with eight each, and Fresno State
with three.
Coach Curly Neal's Cardinal
team lost only six sets all day in
the competition which began at 9
a.m. and continued through 4:30
p.m. Tracy MacNair, Andrea
Barnes, and Maureen O'Keefe all
won three singles matches, while
the doubles teams of Whitney
Grant-Terry Albert and Marlene
Veach-Kathy Wright were also
victorious against all three
schools.
Stanford's only loss of the day
came in the second doubles match
against UC Davis, which Ann
Feeley and Vicki Van Dyke lost
3-6, 3-6.
Stanford's victory was its third
straight in the three year history
of the NCIAC playoffs.

The crowd began to warm up
for the match when the teams
warmed up. Chamberlain's first
practice hit went straight down no
more than a foot on the other side
of the net and brought utterances
of disbelief from the audience.
The Dippers, with Wilt, Gene
Selznick, Larry Rundle, and Rick
Raffero, easily won the first game
15-5, largely on the strength of
Raffero's hits and Selznick's sets,
and it looked as if the fans might
go home early.
But Stanford came back in the
second game and the Dipper team
of Wilt, John Vallely, Toshi
Toyoda, and Kirt Kilgore eased up
a little, allowing Stanford to win
15-10. The final point came off a
big hit by Jim lams, who along
with Willie Mannon, was
impressive for Stanford the entire
evening.
In the third game, the Dippers
changed lineups frequently, but
Wilt was overpowering, pounding
several good sets from Toyoda
into the ground for points.
Vallely Stars
Perhaps the best player of the
night was Vallely, formerly of
UCLA basketball and volleyball
fame. Vallely was hitting superbly
all night and his influence was
strongest in the final game when
he put in hit after hit and the
Dippers held on to win the game
15-11, and the match 3-1.
After the game Toshi Toyoda,
who made several spectacular digs
throughout the play, said that, "it
was our first match of the year
and we didn't play as well as we
could have. But it was a good
match and both teams played
hard."
Then the time came for this
awe-stricken reporter to interview
Chamberlain. When I asked if I
might have a word with him, the
behemoth responded, to the
delight of his teammates, "no."
Then a grin came across his face
and he said, "Sure man. What can

I do for you?"
Chamberlain, being in the
limelight for as long as he has,
offered pretty stock answers to
the stock questions. Yet, he did
say he was very satisfied to open
the season with such a receptive
crowd. He said the Dippers tried
to give the crowd a good show
and it was encouraging to see such
a good volleyball crowd.
Commenting on Stanford's
team Wilt said, "It's tough for
another team to play us. Our
four-man squad has its advantages
and disadvantages. For instance,
our passing, with only two or
three men, has to be more
accurate, and we always have to
have our heads up around the net.
Yet, we have power when we
want it. I think they'll do a lot
better the next time they play
us."

crowd. He said the Dippers tried
to give the crowd a good show
and it was encouraging to see such
a good volleyball crowd.
Commenting on Stanford's
team Wilt said, "It's tough for
another team to play us. Our
four-man squad has its advantages
and disadvantages. For instance,
our passing, with only two or
three men, has to be more
accurate, and we always have to
have our heads up around the net.
Yet, we have power when we
want it. I think they'll do a lot
better the next time they play
us."
Stanford's women's tennis
team won 17 out of 18 individual
matches Saturday on the women's
courts, cruising to an easy victory
over three other schools in the
Northern California
Intercollegiate Athletic
Conference playoffs.
The Cards defeated Fresno
State 6-0, California 6-0, and UC
Davis 5-1 in the round <*obin event
which matched the top two teams
from each NCIAC division.
Stanford finished with 17 points,
followed by Cal and UC Davis
with eight each, and Fresno State
with three.
Coach Curly Neal's Cardinal
team lost only six sets all day in
the competition which began at 9
a.m. and continued through 4:30
p.m. Tracy MacNair, Andrea
Barnes, and Maureen O'Keefe all
won three singles matches, while
the doubles teams of Whitney
Grant-Terry Albert and Marlene
Veach-Kathy Wright were also
victorious against all three
schools.
Stanford's only loss of the day
came in the second doubles match
against UC Davis, which Ann
Feeley and Vicki Van Dyke lost
3-6, 3-6.
Stanford's victory was its third
straight in the three year history
of the NCIAC playoffs.

The crowd began to warm up
for the match when the teams
warmed up. Chamberlain's first
practice hit went straight down no
more than a foot on the other side
of the net and brought utterances
of disbelief from the audience.
The Dippers, with Wilt, Gene
Selznick, Larry Rundle, and Rick
Raffero, easily won the first game
15-5, largely on the strength of
Raffero's hits and Selznick's sets,
and it looked as if the fans might
go home early.
But Stanford came back in the
second game and the Dipper team
of Wilt, John Vallely, Toshi
Toyoda, and Kirt Kilgore eased up
a little, allowing Stanford to win
15-10. The final point came off a
big hit by Jim lams, who along
with Willie Mannon, was
impressive for Stanford the entire
evening.
In the third game, the Dippers
changed lineups frequently, but
Wilt was overpowering, pounding
several good sets from Toyoda
into the ground for points.
Vallely Stars
Perhaps the best player of the
night was Vallely, formerly of
UCLA basketball and volleyball
fame. Vallely was hitting superbly
all night and his influence was
strongest in the final game when
he put in hit after hit and the
Dippers held on to win the game
15-11, and the match 3-1.
After the game Toshi Toyoda,
who made several spectacular digs
throughout the play, said that, "it
was our first match of the year
and we didn't play as well as we
could have. But it was a good
match and both teams played
hard."
Then the time came for this
awe-stricken reporter to interview
Chamberlain. When I asked if I
might have a word with him, the
behemoth responded, to the
delight of his teammates, "no."
Then a grin came across his face
and he said, "Sure man. What can

I do for you?"
Chamberlain, being in the
limelight for as long as he has,
offered pretty stock answers to
the stock questions. Yet, he did
say he was very satisfied to open
the season with such a receptive
crowd. He said the Dippers tried
to give the crowd a good show
and it was encouraging to see such
a good volleyball crowd.
