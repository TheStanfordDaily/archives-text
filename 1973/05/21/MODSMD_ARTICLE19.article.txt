# UCLA Stuns Stanford, USC For Pac-8 Net Title
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
LOS ANGELES - UCLA, rated as
the weakest member of collegiate
tennis' "Big Three," shocked
fellow club members USC and
Stanford over the weekend by
winning the Pacific Eight
championship.
The Bruins knocked off
Stanford 5-4 Friday and USC 6-3
Saturday in matches at the David
Marks Stadium at USC to win the
league crown and leave their more
highly-regarded foes with nothing
to do but analyze the results.
Stanford Coach Dick Gould,
whose team finished third by
beating Oregon State 8-1 Saturday
morning, said after the UCLA
loss, "we just hung back and let
them beat us. It was just like
when we lost to them in March â€”
we didn't go out and get them."
The Bruins clinched their
victory over the Cardinals when
third doubles team Steve Mott
and Brian Teacher beat John
Whitlinger and Pat DuPre 6-2, 6-2.
But the loss of the match
cannot be blamed on
Whitlinger-DuPre; it was
Stanford's poor third-set singles
play which sealed its doom.
At second singles, UCLA star

Jeff Austin topped Jim Deianey
6-7, 6-4, 7-6. Deianey rallied from
a 5-2 third-set deficit to force the
tiebreaker, but Austin put him
away 5-1 to win the match.
At third singles, Steve
Krulevitz and Rick Fisher, two
evenly-matched rivals, dueled each
other for the fourth time this
year. Krulevitz won 7-5, 1-6, 7-5
to even his 1973 score with Fisher
at two all.
UCLA then switched their
order around in a successful effort
to beat DuPre at fourth singles.
The Bruins put Brian Teacher,
who generally does well against
DuPre, at fourth singles, and
Teacher came through with a 4-6,
6-2, 6-1 win.
Only Good Performance
UCLA's usual fourth singles
player, Ray no Seegers, played
fifth singles this weekend, and
conclusively beat Chip Fisher 6-4,
6-2. Gould said "Seegers was the
only player on either team who
play aggressively."
Stanford did win the other
four matches. At first singles,
Sandy Mayer beat Bob Kreiss 6-2,
7-5, in a hard fought match where
the players wouldn't shake hands
at the finish because of a
protracted dispute on a line call.
At sixth singles, Whitlinger
came back from match point
against him to top Steve Mott 2-6,
7-6, 6-4.
Doubles Wins
The Cardinals also won the
first and second doubles events,
with Mayer-Delaney beating
Austin-Kreiss 6-4, 6-4, and R.
Fisher-Gery Groslimond topping
Seegers-Krulevitz by the same
score.
Stanford's players got up early
the next morning to beat Oregon
State for an unwanted third-place
award. Rick Fisher was the only
Cardinal player to lose, bowing to
Roger McKee 2-6, 6-3, 7-5, and
was badly upset by the loss to a
weaker opponent.
The Beavers played excellent
tennis throughout the
tournament, but, like everyone
else in the country, are no match
for the "Big Three."
UCLA Wins Again
Later Saturday, Stanford got
some consolation when UCLA
topped USC. The Bruins again
showed surprising singles power,
winning five of six matches.
UCLA's biggest upset was

scored by Kreiss, who shocked
Mexican Davis Cupper Raul
Ramirez 7-5, 5-7, 6-3 at first
singles. Kreiss, labelled "a real
gutty performer" by Gould, has
been suffering from a back injury.
The Pac-B's can be categorized
as "round four" in the five-round
battle for the national
championship.
Round one, at the National
Indoor Championships in Madison
this February, was won by
Stanford. Round two, the series
of dual matches among Pac-8
Southern Division schools, went
to USC.
Round three, at Ojai, went to
Stanford, but the Cards' victory
was a shaky one. Round four, of
course, is the first won by UCLA.
Round five is the NCAA
championship in Princeton, New
Jersey, June 18-23.
And the lead in the battle for
the National championship keeps
going round and round.
