# KZSU Needs FCC Power Boost Approval For Stereo Signal To Be Heard Off Campus
## 
### CHRISTY WISE 
KZSU is currently in the process of acquiring the
permission and equipment necessary to increase its
broadcast power and broadcast in stereo over two
channels.
A newly purchased three-part stereo transmitter
will enable KZSU to boost its power from 10 watts
to 500, providing that the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) approves the power increase.
Broadcasting in stereo on campus will begin as
soon as KZSU receives equipment, required by the
FCC, to keep output level (modulation) in the
proper range. "We have one [limiter] for one
channel, but not for both channels," said Station
Manager Lloyd Snook. He noted the station has
been working on converting to stereo for five
months.
However, the stereo signal, without the power
increase, "will get down to the campus, but not
much further," explained Snook. For KZSU to
reach the same area with two channels as they
presently do with one, "the signal has to be twice as
strong."

The power increase application, filed in January,
is subject to objections by neighboring stations.
Rumors hint that KFJC at Foothill College in Los
Altos Hills might file objections due to possible
interference over an area in Palo Alto.
Snook, however, is hopeful that no objections
were filed because the deadline was May 2 and as
yet, he has "heard about no objections."
Difference
According to Snook, interference in this case is a
matter of interpretation. KZSU, he said, doesn't
think the power increase interferes with KFJC, and
"they think it does."
He explained that "for 10 watt stations, the FCC
makes a lot of allowances." Their decisions in these
cases are based on equations and rules rather than
investigation of the area. "They don't look at it
carefully," said Snook, adding that this "eases their
bookkeeping."
Snook claimed, if the FCC "looks at the
equations, the power increase won't interfere. If
they look at reality, it will interfere." He added the
FCC is primarily concerned with interference in the

prime coverage area, adding that the power increase
"won't interfere with that."
In June, 1972, KZSU filed for an increase to
3000 watts which was denied because it interfered
over seven square miles of land with KCMA in San
Francisco. KZSU calculations show that by
decreasing their request to 500 watts they will not
interfere with anybody "on paper."
Student Fees
The new equipment, totalling $7692, was funded
with 1972-73 student fee assessment. The station
replaced its old transmitter, which was "on its last
legs," according to Snook. He explained that KZSU
"couldn't buy a stereo generator to be compatible
with the old transmitter."
Snook said they got a lower price by buying
everything at once, and assuming they are granted a
power increase "fairly soon, it was most economical
to buy the entire package."
Presently, the 10-watt exciter, partially replacing
the old transmitter, is the only part in use. The
power amplifier, antenna, and stereo generator
await power increase approval.
