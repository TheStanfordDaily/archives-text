Stanford concluded a
disappointing crew season over
the weekend, as only one of six
Cardinal boats qualified for the
finals at the Western Sprint
Rowing Championships in Los
Gatos.
The freshman four was the
only boat to survive the qualifying
heats and eventually finished
fourth in an original field of 12.
Stanford's varsity eights, freshman
eights, JV eights, and two
lightweight fours failed to place in
the top two in their respective
heats.
Unbeaten Washington
dominated the two-day
competition, sweeping five of six
races Saturday to earn a berth in
the famed Henley Regatta in
London next month.
Stanford's season was
disappointing, but the Cards'
1973 performance represented a
considerable improvement over
last year, when Stanford . >n only
one varsity race and one freshman
race. "We definitely improved a
lot over last year," said varsity
coxswain Corey haden, who
attributed "a lot of our minor
successes" to first year coach Len
Sherr.
