Venezuelan Plane Hijacked
CARACAS, Venezuela — A Venezuelan
airliner hijacked to Cuba returned here
yesterday with the passengers and crew taken
as hostages by armed leftists on an erratic trip
through five countries.
Authorities said the plane landed at
Maiquetia Airport at 9:30 p.m. with 25
passengers and five crew members aboard.
Originally there were 32 passengers, but
three were allowed to debark in Panama
before the flight to Havana and the plane left
the four hijackers in Cuba, where they
evidently sought asylum.
The passengers were taken away
immediately for questioning by Venezuelan
police investigating the underground
organization "Punto Cero" Point Zero — to
which the four hijackers said they belonged.
The Mexican government announced that
an Interior Ministry official had gone aboard
the hijacked plane Saturday afternoon in
Mexico City as the young hijackers tried to
negotiate with Venezuelan representatives for
the release of prisoners in Venezuelan jails.
The heavily armed leftists, who
commandeered the plane Friday night during
a domestic flight to Caracas, had threatened
to blow up the plane along with its crew and
passengers unless Venezuela freed the 79
"political prisoners."
Flights Threaten Peace Talks
SAIGON — Hanoi charged yesterday that the
United States is making new reconaissance
flights over North Vietnam.
It said the flights "have a negative effect"
on the current talks in Paris between Le Due
Tho and Henry A. Kissinger.
There was no immediate comment from
U.S. officials in Saigon. They have publicly
acknowledged that unmanned reconnaissance
flights have been carried out in the past over

North Vietnam, using pilotless aircraft called
drones.
An official statement from the North
Vietnamese Foreign Ministry broadcast over
Radio Hanoi implied that Tho might decide to
break off his talks with Kissinger.
'The U.S. government must be held totally
responsible for all the consequences arising
from its violations," the statement said.
Tho and Kissinger took a day off yesterday
in their secret talks, but their two deputies
met to discuss details of the negotiations.
There was no word when Kissinger and Tho
would confer again.
The U.S. presidential adviser is expected to
return to Washington later this week after
several more meetings to explore ways of
stopping violations of the peace agreement
signed in Paris Jan. 27 and means of putting
into effect several key provisions that have
never been carried out.
Skylab Salvage Scheduled
CAPE KENNEDY, Fla. — Astronauts flew to
Alabama's Marshall Space Flight Center
yesterday for a "swim through" practice of
the first space salvage job.
Emergency fabrication was nearly finished
on sun shades which may save the overheated
Skylab space station.
Skylab 1 astronauts Charles Conrad Jr., Dr.
Joseph P. Kerwin and Paul J. Weitz will don
bulky white space suits today and enter a
huge water tank to train on the techniques for
erecting sun screens on the orbiting
laboratory.
By practicing the job underwater, the
astronauts experience sensations similar to
working in weightlessness. In the tank are
actual-size models of the Skylab and the
Apollo spacecraft which will carry the
astronauts into orbit.
Exhausted from a crash training program
which began after last Monday's launch of the

troubled Skylab, the astronauts took half a
day off Sunday. They spent the time in their
quarantine quarters at the Johnson Space
Center near Houston.
After their launch Friday, the astronauts
are to rendezvous with the station about 1:43
p.m. (PDT). They will fly around the
118-foot-long lab for an inspection.
Depending on what they find, final plans will
be made for the salvage effort.
Five candidate designs for the Skylab sun
shield are being studied and built.
Reconstruction Planned
SAIGON — President Nguyen Van Thieu
unveiled yesterday a postwar reconstruction
and economic program for South Vietnam.
He said it was designed to beat the
Communist hopes "to take over South
Vietnam," and to "build a genuine and lasting
peace for ourselves."
While Thieu put no price tag on the
eight-year economic package, analysts
estimated it would cost up to $4 billion in
foreign aid, with South Vietnam expecting
$650 million in the first fiscal year beginning
in July.
The bulk of the aid would come from the
United States.
Thieu, in a nationwide radio and television
address to South Vietnam's 18 million
inhabitants, made only slight mention of the
U.S. role. Thieu couched his appeal for
foreign aid in broad terms, telling the nation:
"Friendly nations, especially the United
States, are all ready to provide maximum
support for the Republic of Vietnam's
postwar rehabilitation and construction
efforts. We cannot afford to let the
opportunity go by."
Thieu said his program would be carried
out in three phases over the next eight years
and that by the next decade South Vietnam

should be self-sufficient economically. He
made no mention of military aid money.
Emmy Awards Issued
LOS ANGELES - "The Waltons," a gentle
tale of a Depression family in the Blue Ridge
Mountains of Virginia, captured top honors at
the 25th Television Academy Awards last
night.
"The Mary Tyler Moore Show" scored in
the comedy division with the best comedy
acting Emmy for its star — Mary Tyler Moore
— while Jack Klugman, the sloppy roommate
in "The Odd Couple," was voted best actor in
a comedy series.
"All in the Family," the pace-setting show
depicting an amiable bigot, was hailed as the
outstanding comedy of the 1972-73 television
season. It was the third year in a row for the
CBS highrated series.
Supporting awards in television comedy
went to Ted Knight and Valerie Harper,
talented second bananas of the "Mary Tyler
Moore Show."
Tim Conway won an Emmy as supporting
performer in the musical variety for "The
Carol Burnett Show." His statuette was
accepted by his fellow performer on the show,
Harvey Korman, who claimed he had also won
"because we were running as an entry."
Bob Fosse was in the running for the
equivalent of show biz' grand slam with his
Emmy nomination for directing the special
"Liza with a Z." Earlier this year he collected
a Tony for "Pippin" and an Oscar for
"Cabaret."
Probable winner in the musical categories

Gas Discounts Disappear
NEW YORK — The driver who used to buy
gas at independent service stations to save
money often finds there's no bargain left.
Independent dealers have been the victims
of a tight domestic supply situation that has
raised wholesale prices from independent
distributors by 10 to 35 percent in the last
two months.
The increased costs in many cases have
eliminated the price edge the independents
used to enjoy over name-brand dealers.
Independents account for about a quarter
of all gasoline sales in the country.
Retail gasoline prices of major brand
dealers have generally remained unchanged,
but discounts have virtually disappeared in
cities like Chicago.
Some independents curtailed operations or
went out of business. An estimated 500 to
600 of the 220,000 independent gas stations
in the country were forced to close
temporarily or permanently.
Most independent distributors, however,
turned to the foreign market to make up for
the lack of domestic supplies.
The price situation for independents may
ease somewhat following a new Nixon

administration oil allocation plan which
would have suppliers allocate petroleum
products to all customers — including
independents — according to their percentage
purchases in the base period from October
1971 to September 1972.
Animals Victim Of Blast
GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. — The main
victims of a mile-deep nuclear blast in
northwestern Colorado apparently were small
animals which burrow underground.
It will be months before scientists know
whether Thursday's explosions succeeded in
their principal aim of freeing natural gas at an
economical price.
But "significant changes" in some local
wildlife habitats resulted from the nuclear
detonation, a spokesman for the Atomic
Energy Commission said Saturday night.
Dave Jackson, the AEC spokesman, said
some small animals that burrow underground
were killed when earth tremors from the blast
caused their burrows to cave in.
Plants, birds, fish and other animals were
probably killed in cave-ins or rockfalls, he
said, but had no precise figures.
Today's Weather
Fair through Tuesday but with low clouds
along coast extending inland locally night and
mornings. A little warmer Monday. Lows
Monday night in upper 40s to low 50s. Highs
both days near 60 along coast to the low 70s
inland.

raised wholesale prices from independent
distributors by 10 to 35 percent in the last
two months.
The increased costs in many cases have
eliminated the price edge the independents
used to enjoy over name-brand dealers.
Independents account for about a quarter
of all gasoline sales in the country.
Retail gasoline prices of major brand
dealers have generally remained unchanged,
but discounts have virtually disappeared in
cities like Chicago.
Some independents curtailed operations or
went out of business. An estimated 500 to
600 of the 220,000 independent gas stations
in the country were forced to close
temporarily or permanently.
Most independent distributors, however,
turned to the foreign market to make up for
the lack of domestic supplies.
The price situation for independents may
ease somewhat following a new Nixon

administration oil allocation plan which
would have suppliers allocate petroleum
products to all customers — including
independents — according to their percentage
purchases in the base period from October
1971 to September 1972.
Animals Victim Of Blast
GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. — The main
victims of a mile-deep nuclear blast in
northwestern Colorado apparently were small
animals which burrow underground.
It will be months before scientists know
whether Thursday's explosions succeeded in
their principal aim of freeing natural gas at an
economical price.
But "significant changes" in some local
wildlife habitats resulted from the nuclear
detonation, a spokesman for the Atomic
Energy Commission said Saturday night.
Dave Jackson, the AEC spokesman, said
some small animals that burrow underground
were killed when earth tremors from the blast
caused their burrows to cave in.
Plants, birds, fish and other animals were
probably killed in cave-ins or rockfalls, he
said, but had no precise figures.
Today's Weather
Fair through Tuesday but with low clouds
along coast extending inland locally night and
mornings. A little warmer Monday. Lows
Monday night in upper 40s to low 50s. Highs
both days near 60 along coast to the low 70s
inland.
Venezuelan Plane Hijacked
CARACAS, Venezuela — A Venezuelan
airliner hijacked to Cuba returned here
yesterday with the passengers and crew taken
as hostages by armed leftists on an erratic trip
through five countries.
Authorities said the plane landed at
Maiquetia Airport at 9:30 p.m. with 25
passengers and five crew members aboard.
Originally there were 32 passengers, but
three were allowed to debark in Panama
before the flight to Havana and the plane left
the four hijackers in Cuba, where they
evidently sought asylum.
The passengers were taken away
immediately for questioning by Venezuelan
police investigating the underground
organization "Punto Cero" Point Zero — to
which the four hijackers said they belonged.
The Mexican government announced that
an Interior Ministry official had gone aboard
the hijacked plane Saturday afternoon in
Mexico City as the young hijackers tried to
negotiate with Venezuelan representatives for
the release of prisoners in Venezuelan jails.
The heavily armed leftists, who
commandeered the plane Friday night during
a domestic flight to Caracas, had threatened
to blow up the plane along with its crew and
passengers unless Venezuela freed the 79
"political prisoners."
Flights Threaten Peace Talks
SAIGON — Hanoi charged yesterday that the
United States is making new reconaissance
flights over North Vietnam.
It said the flights "have a negative effect"
on the current talks in Paris between Le Due
Tho and Henry A. Kissinger.
There was no immediate comment from
U.S. officials in Saigon. They have publicly
acknowledged that unmanned reconnaissance
flights have been carried out in the past over

North Vietnam, using pilotless aircraft called
drones.
An official statement from the North
Vietnamese Foreign Ministry broadcast over
Radio Hanoi implied that Tho might decide to
break off his talks with Kissinger.
'The U.S. government must be held totally
responsible for all the consequences arising
from its violations," the statement said.
Tho and Kissinger took a day off yesterday
in their secret talks, but their two deputies
met to discuss details of the negotiations.
There was no word when Kissinger and Tho
would confer again.
The U.S. presidential adviser is expected to
return to Washington later this week after
several more meetings to explore ways of
stopping violations of the peace agreement
signed in Paris Jan. 27 and means of putting
into effect several key provisions that have
never been carried out.
Skylab Salvage Scheduled
CAPE KENNEDY, Fla. — Astronauts flew to
Alabama's Marshall Space Flight Center
yesterday for a "swim through" practice of
the first space salvage job.
Emergency fabrication was nearly finished
on sun shades which may save the overheated
Skylab space station.
Skylab 1 astronauts Charles Conrad Jr., Dr.
Joseph P. Kerwin and Paul J. Weitz will don
bulky white space suits today and enter a
huge water tank to train on the techniques for
erecting sun screens on the orbiting
laboratory.
By practicing the job underwater, the
astronauts experience sensations similar to
working in weightlessness. In the tank are
actual-size models of the Skylab and the
Apollo spacecraft which will carry the
astronauts into orbit.
Exhausted from a crash training program
which began after last Monday's launch of the

troubled Skylab, the astronauts took half a
day off Sunday. They spent the time in their
quarantine quarters at the Johnson Space
Center near Houston.
After their launch Friday, the astronauts
are to rendezvous with the station about 1:43
p.m. (PDT). They will fly around the
118-foot-long lab for an inspection.
Depending on what they find, final plans will
be made for the salvage effort.
Five candidate designs for the Skylab sun
shield are being studied and built.
Reconstruction Planned
SAIGON — President Nguyen Van Thieu
unveiled yesterday a postwar reconstruction
and economic program for South Vietnam.
He said it was designed to beat the
Communist hopes "to take over South
Vietnam," and to "build a genuine and lasting
peace for ourselves."
While Thieu put no price tag on the
eight-year economic package, analysts
estimated it would cost up to $4 billion in
foreign aid, with South Vietnam expecting
$650 million in the first fiscal year beginning
in July.
The bulk of the aid would come from the
United States.
Thieu, in a nationwide radio and television
address to South Vietnam's 18 million
inhabitants, made only slight mention of the
U.S. role. Thieu couched his appeal for
foreign aid in broad terms, telling the nation:
"Friendly nations, especially the United
States, are all ready to provide maximum
support for the Republic of Vietnam's
postwar rehabilitation and construction
efforts. We cannot afford to let the
opportunity go by."
Thieu said his program would be carried
out in three phases over the next eight years
and that by the next decade South Vietnam

should be self-sufficient economically. He
made no mention of military aid money.
Emmy Awards Issued
LOS ANGELES - "The Waltons," a gentle
tale of a Depression family in the Blue Ridge
Mountains of Virginia, captured top honors at
the 25th Television Academy Awards last
night.

outstanding comedy of the 1972-73 television
season. It was the third year in a row for the
CBS highrated series.
Supporting awards in television comedy
went to Ted Knight and Valerie Harper,
talented second bananas of the "Mary Tyler

Gas Discounts Disappear
NEW YORK — The driver who used to buy
gas at independent service stations to save
money often finds there's no bargain left.
Independent dealers have been the victims
of a tight domestic supply situation that has
raised wholesale prices from independent
distributors by 10 to 35 percent in the last
two months.
The increased costs in many cases have
eliminated the price edge the independents
used to enjoy over name-brand dealers.
Independents account for about a quarter
of all gasoline sales in the country.
Retail gasoline prices of major brand
dealers have generally remained unchanged,
but discounts have virtually disappeared in
cities like Chicago.
Some independents curtailed operations or
went out of business. An estimated 500 to
600 of the 220,000 independent gas stations
in the country were forced to close
temporarily or permanently.
Most independent distributors, however,
turned to the foreign market to make up for
the lack of domestic supplies.
The price situation for independents may
ease somewhat following a new Nixon

administration oil allocation plan which
would have suppliers allocate petroleum
products to all customers — including
independents — according to their percentage
purchases in the base period from October
1971 to September 1972.
Animals Victim Of Blast
GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. — The main
victims of a mile-deep nuclear blast in
northwestern Colorado apparently were small
animals which burrow underground.
It will be months before scientists know
whether Thursday's explosions succeeded in
their principal aim of freeing natural gas at an
economical price.
But "significant changes" in some local
wildlife habitats resulted from the nuclear
detonation, a spokesman for the Atomic
Energy Commission said Saturday night.
Dave Jackson, the AEC spokesman, said
some small animals that burrow underground
were killed when earth tremors from the blast
caused their burrows to cave in.
Plants, birds, fish and other animals were
probably killed in cave-ins or rockfalls, he
said, but had no precise figures.
Today's Weather
Fair through Tuesday but with low clouds
along coast extending inland locally night and
mornings. A little warmer Monday. Lows
Monday night in upper 40s to low 50s. Highs
both days near 60 along coast to the low 70s
inland.
Venezuelan Plane Hijacked
CARACAS, Venezuela — A Venezuelan
airliner hijacked to Cuba returned here
yesterday with the passengers and crew taken
as hostages by armed leftists on an erratic trip
through five countries.
Authorities said the plane landed at
Maiquetia Airport at 9:30 p.m. with 25
passengers and five crew members aboard.
Originally there were 32 passengers, but
three were allowed to debark in Panama
before the flight to Havana and the plane left
the four hijackers in Cuba, where they
evidently sought asylum.
The passengers were taken away
immediately for questioning by Venezuelan
police investigating the underground
organization "Punto Cero" Point Zero — to
which the four hijackers said they belonged.
The Mexican government announced that
an Interior Ministry official had gone aboard
the hijacked plane Saturday afternoon in
Mexico City as the young hijackers tried to
negotiate with Venezuelan representatives for
the release of prisoners in Venezuelan jails.
The heavily armed leftists, who
commandeered the plane Friday night during
a domestic flight to Caracas, had threatened
to blow up the plane along with its crew and
passengers unless Venezuela freed the 79
"political prisoners."
Flights Threaten Peace Talks
SAIGON — Hanoi charged yesterday that the
United States is making new reconaissance
flights over North Vietnam.
It said the flights "have a negative effect"
on the current talks in Paris between Le Due
Tho and Henry A. Kissinger.
There was no immediate comment from
U.S. officials in Saigon. They have publicly
acknowledged that unmanned reconnaissance
flights have been carried out in the past over

North Vietnam, using pilotless aircraft called
drones.
An official statement from the North
Vietnamese Foreign Ministry broadcast over
Radio Hanoi implied that Tho might decide to
break off his talks with Kissinger.
'The U.S. government must be held totally
responsible for all the consequences arising
from its violations," the statement said.
Tho and Kissinger took a day off yesterday
in their secret talks, but their two deputies
met to discuss details of the negotiations.
There was no word when Kissinger and Tho

The U.S. presidential adviser is expected to

never been carried out.
Skylab Salvage Scheduled
CAPE KENNEDY, Fla. — Astronauts flew to
Alabama's Marshall Space Flight Center
yesterday for a "swim through" practice of
the first space salvage job.
Emergency fabrication was nearly finished
on sun shades which may save the overheated
Skylab space station.
Skylab 1 astronauts Charles Conrad Jr., Dr.
Joseph P. Kerwin and Paul J. Weitz will don
bulky white space suits today and enter a
huge water tank to train on the techniques for
erecting sun screens on the orbiting
laboratory.
By practicing the job underwater, the
astronauts experience sensations similar to
working in weightlessness. In the tank are
actual-size models of the Skylab and the
Apollo spacecraft which will carry the
astronauts into orbit.
Exhausted from a crash training program
which began after last Monday's launch of the

troubled Skylab, the astronauts took half a
day off Sunday. They spent the time in their
quarantine quarters at the Johnson Space
Center near Houston.
After their launch Friday, the astronauts
are to rendezvous with the station about 1:43
p.m. (PDT). They will fly around the
118-foot-long lab for an inspection.
Depending on what they find, final plans will
be made for the salvage effort.
Five candidate designs for the Skylab sun
shield are being studied and built.
Reconstruction Planned
SAIGON — President Nguyen Van Thieu
unveiled yesterday a postwar reconstruction
and economic program for South Vietnam.
He said it was designed to beat the
Communist hopes "to take over South
Vietnam," and to "build a genuine and lasting
peace for ourselves."
While Thieu put no price tag on the
eight-year economic package, analysts
estimated it would cost up to $4 billion in
foreign aid, with South Vietnam expecting
$650 million in the first fiscal year beginning
in July.
The bulk of the aid would come from the
United States.
Thieu, in a nationwide radio and television
address to South Vietnam's 18 million
inhabitants, made only slight mention of the
U.S. role. Thieu couched his appeal for
foreign aid in broad terms, telling the nation:
"Friendly nations, especially the United
States, are all ready to provide maximum
support for the Republic of Vietnam's
postwar rehabilitation and construction
efforts. We cannot afford to let the
opportunity go by."
Thieu said his program would be carried
out in three phases over the next eight years
and that by the next decade South Vietnam

should be self-sufficient economically. He
made no mention of military aid money.

CAPE KENNEDY, Fla. — Astronauts flew to
Alabama's Marshall Space Flight Center
yesterday for a "swim through" practice of
the first space salvage job.
Emergency fabrication was nearly finished
on sun shades which may save the overheated
Skylab space station.
Skylab 1 astronauts Charles Conrad Jr., Dr.
Joseph P. Kerwin and Paul J. Weitz will don
bulky white space suits today and enter a
huge water tank to train on the techniques for
erecting sun screens on the orbiting
laboratory.
By practicing the job underwater, the
astronauts experience sensations similar to
working in weightlessness. In the tank are
actual-size models of the Skylab and the
Apollo spacecraft which will carry the
astronauts into orbit.
Exhausted from a crash training program
which began after last Monday's launch of the

troubled Skylab, the astronauts took half a
day off Sunday. They spent the time in their
quarantine quarters at the Johnson Space
Center near Houston.
After their launch Friday, the astronauts
are to rendezvous with the station about 1:43
p.m. (PDT). They will fly around the
118-foot-long lab for an inspection.
Depending on what they find, final plans will
be made for the salvage effort.
Five candidate designs for the Skylab sun
shield are being studied and built.
Reconstruction Planned
SAIGON — President Nguyen Van Thieu
unveiled yesterday a postwar reconstruction
and economic program for South Vietnam.
He said it was designed to beat the
Communist hopes "to take over South
Vietnam," and to "build a genuine and lasting
peace for ourselves."
While Thieu put no price tag on the
eight-year economic package, analysts
estimated it would cost up to $4 billion in
foreign aid, with South Vietnam expecting
$650 million in the first fiscal year beginning
in July.
The bulk of the aid would come from the
United States.
Thieu, in a nationwide radio and television
address to South Vietnam's 18 million
inhabitants, made only slight mention of the
U.S. role. Thieu couched his appeal for
foreign aid in broad terms, telling the nation:
"Friendly nations, especially the United
States, are all ready to provide maximum
support for the Republic of Vietnam's
postwar rehabilitation and construction
efforts. We cannot afford to let the
opportunity go by."
Thieu said his program would be carried
out in three phases over the next eight years
and that by the next decade South Vietnam

should be self-sufficient economically. He
made no mention of military aid money.
Emmy Awards Issued
LOS ANGELES - "The Waltons," a gentle
tale of a Depression family in the Blue Ridge
Mountains of Virginia, captured top honors at
the 25th Television Academy Awards last
night.
"The Mary Tyler Moore Show" scored in
the comedy division with the best comedy
acting Emmy for its star — Mary Tyler Moore
— while Jack Klugman, the sloppy roommate
in "The Odd Couple," was voted best actor in
a comedy series.
"All in the Family," the pace-setting show
depicting an amiable bigot, was hailed as the
outstanding comedy of the 1972-73 television
season. It was the third year in a row for the
CBS highrated series.
Supporting awards in television comedy
went to Ted Knight and Valerie Harper,
talented second bananas of the "Mary Tyler
Moore Show."
Tim Conway won an Emmy as supporting
performer in the musical variety for "The
Carol Burnett Show." His statuette was
accepted by his fellow performer on the show,
Harvey Korman, who claimed he had also won
"because we were running as an entry."
Bob Fosse was in the running for the
equivalent of show biz' grand slam with his
Emmy nomination for directing the special
"Liza with a Z." Earlier this year he collected
a Tony for "Pippin" and an Oscar for
"Cabaret."
Probable winner in the musical categories
was "The Julie Andrews Hour." Cancelled
because of poor ratings, the weekly variety
show won 10 nominations.
Gas Discounts Disappear
NEW YORK — The driver who used to buy
gas at independent service stations to save
money often finds there's no bargain left.
Independent dealers have been the victims
of a tight domestic supply situation that has
raised wholesale prices from independent
distributors by 10 to 35 percent in the last
two months.
The increased costs in many cases have
eliminated the price edge the independents
used to enjoy over name-brand dealers.
Independents account for about a quarter
of all gasoline sales in the country.
Retail gasoline prices of major brand
dealers have generally remained unchanged,
but discounts have virtually disappeared in
cities like Chicago.
Some independents curtailed operations or
went out of business. An estimated 500 to
600 of the 220,000 independent gas stations
in the country were forced to close
temporarily or permanently.
Most independent distributors, however,
turned to the foreign market to make up for
the lack of domestic supplies.
The price situation for independents may
ease somewhat following a new Nixon

administration oil allocation plan which
would have suppliers allocate petroleum
products to all customers — including
independents — according to their percentage
purchases in the base period from October
1971 to September 1972.
Animals Victim Of Blast
GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. — The main
victims of a mile-deep nuclear blast in
northwestern Colorado apparently were small
animals which burrow underground.
It will be months before scientists know
whether Thursday's explosions succeeded in
their principal aim of freeing natural gas at an
economical price.
But "significant changes" in some local
wildlife habitats resulted from the nuclear
detonation, a spokesman for the Atomic
Energy Commission said Saturday night.
Dave Jackson, the AEC spokesman, said
some small animals that burrow underground
were killed when earth tremors from the blast
caused their burrows to cave in.
Plants, birds, fish and other animals were
probably killed in cave-ins or rockfalls, he
said, but had no precise figures.
Today's Weather
Fair through Tuesday but with low clouds
along coast extending inland locally night and
mornings. A little warmer Monday. Lows
Monday night in upper 40s to low 50s. Highs
both days near 60 along coast to the low 70s
inland.
Venezuelan Plane Hijacked
CARACAS, Venezuela — A Venezuelan
airliner hijacked to Cuba returned here
yesterday with the passengers and crew taken
as hostages by armed leftists on an erratic trip
through five countries.
Authorities said the plane landed at
Maiquetia Airport at 9:30 p.m. with 25
passengers and five crew members aboard.
Originally there were 32 passengers, but
three were allowed to debark in Panama
before the flight to Havana and the plane left
the four hijackers in Cuba, where they
evidently sought asylum.
The passengers were taken away
immediately for questioning by Venezuelan
police investigating the underground
organization "Punto Cero" Point Zero — to
which the four hijackers said they belonged.
The Mexican government announced that
an Interior Ministry official had gone aboard
the hijacked plane Saturday afternoon in
Mexico City as the young hijackers tried to
negotiate with Venezuelan representatives for
the release of prisoners in Venezuelan jails.
The heavily armed leftists, who
commandeered the plane Friday night during
a domestic flight to Caracas, had threatened
to blow up the plane along with its crew and
passengers unless Venezuela freed the 79
"political prisoners."
Flights Threaten Peace Talks
SAIGON — Hanoi charged yesterday that the
United States is making new reconaissance
flights over North Vietnam.
It said the flights "have a negative effect"
on the current talks in Paris between Le Due
Tho and Henry A. Kissinger.
There was no immediate comment from
U.S. officials in Saigon. They have publicly
acknowledged that unmanned reconnaissance
flights have been carried out in the past over

North Vietnam, using pilotless aircraft called
drones.
An official statement from the North
Vietnamese Foreign Ministry broadcast over
Radio Hanoi implied that Tho might decide to
break off his talks with Kissinger.
'The U.S. government must be held totally
responsible for all the consequences arising
from its violations," the statement said.
Tho and Kissinger took a day off yesterday
in their secret talks, but their two deputies
met to discuss details of the negotiations.
There was no word when Kissinger and Tho
would confer again.
The U.S. presidential adviser is expected to
return to Washington later this week after
several more meetings to explore ways of
stopping violations of the peace agreement
signed in Paris Jan. 27 and means of putting
into effect several key provisions that have
never been carried out.
