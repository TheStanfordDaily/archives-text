# Lyman Calls For 'Generalists'
## 
### 
The trend toward educational specializa
tion has gone so far that "the need for
generalists has never been greater," said
Stanford University President Richard W.
Lyman.
"Without strong and thrustful programs in
the liberal arts, all the vocational skills in the
world won't solve our problems, either
individually or as a society," Lyman said in
remarks prepared for the annual alumni
assembly meeting here Saturday.
Generalists "are needed to keep the tribes
of specialists from running into one another,"
he said. "They're needed to strike a
productive balance between the advantages of
competition and those of collaboration.
"They're needed to bring perspective to
the formidable task of improving the quality
of life in a climate of freedom and individual
self-fulfillment."

An increasing pressure for vocationalism,
said Lyman, has accompanied concern over
rising educational costs and the tough job
market for college graduates.
However, he said, "Training without
education means the development of a
person's capacity in a one-sided and dangerous
way. It produces expertise without wisdom,
widely recognized as an explosive and
unstable compound."
"A Stanford lawyer should have broader
views and a more comprehensive grasp
because he or she has studied law in a
university setting. A Stanford doctor should
be able to see her or his profession in the
wider context of the world and of the human
intellect, because the Medical School is part of
a great university.
"The unique strength of American higher
education, for all its sins ... has been its

ecumenical quality, its effort to bridge the gap
between academia and the world of practical
affairs."
To be effective, he said, liberal education
"must enable people to learn the difference
between wish and achievement — and how to
blend the two.
"It must assist everyone, regardless of
vocational expectations, in learning how to
think critically. And that does not mean
merely how to become skeptical of the
Establishment — That's too easy, and requires
no disciplined thought whatsoever.
"It means how to amass, consider, and
weigh evidence; how to distinguish among
kinds of knowledge, not for the purpose of
denigrating some and elevating others, but so
as to know what one knows, and what the
limits and qualifications on that knowledge
are."
