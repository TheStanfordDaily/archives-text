# Senate Watergate Panel Won't Seek Nixon Views
## 
### 
From The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - Sen. Sam J. Ervin
(D-N.C.) said yesterday it is highly
improbable his Senate Watergate
investigating committee will question
or seek a written statement from
President Nixon about any
involvement in the scandal.
The testimony Friday by convicted
Watergate burglar James McCord that
offers of executive clemency were
made to buy his silence "is not
evidence against the President," Ervin
said.
The North Carolina Democrat spoke
on the ABC television program "Issues
and Answers," amid indications that
the committee hearings were speeded
up by McCord's statements and new
disclosures by government auditors of
money funneled to the Watergate
conspirators.
Hearings Resume
The committee's televised hearings
resume at 7 a.m. (PDT) tomorrow
with McCord still the witness.
He is expected to be questioned
closely about his statement Friday
that as security chief of the
Committee for the Re-election of the
President he received daily intelligence
reports from the Internal Security
Division of the Justice Department.
Committee investigators said they
will want to know whether
government wiretap information was
included.
"We already know of FBI wiretaps
on reporters and White House aides,"
one investigator said. "We know about
the Watergate taps. But there may
have been 25 or 100 Watergates we
don't know about yet that were
carried out by the government and
turned over to the Nixon re-election
committee."
McCord's testimony is likely to lead
the committee to call Robert C.

Mardian, former head of the Internal
Security Division and later a Nixon
re-election campaign official.
Personal Lawyer
Auditors for the General
Accounting Office (GAO) said
Saturday that President Nixon's
former personal lawyer, Herbert W.
Kalmbach, told them he collected and
paid at least $210,000 "for
distribution through intermediaries to
the Watergate defendants or their
attorneys."
Most of the money, according to
the GAO report, came from Maurice
Stans and Frederick C. Laßue — two
officials of the re-election campaign —
last summer after the arrest of the
bugging crew.
The GAO also reported that
Thomas V. Jones, president and
chairman of Northrop Corp., gave at
least $50,000 to the fund, but thought
it was a campaign contribution that
would be reported as such. It wasn't
reported, the GAO said.
Stanford Trustee
Jones, 52, has been a member of
Stanford's Board of Trustees since
1968 and resides in Los Angeles. He
also serves on the Board of Directors
of the Stanford Research Institute.
The GAO said Stans, the former
commerce secretary recently indicted
by a New York grand jury, admitted
giving $75,100 to Kalmbach but said
he contended it wasn't campaign

money and that he was unaware the
money was intended for the Watergate
defendants.
Laßue declined to talk to
investigators, the GAO said.
McCord testified Friday he received
cash payments of $21,000 in salary
and $25,000 "legal fees" from the late
Mrs. E. Howard Hunt, wife of one of
the seven men convicted in the
conspiracy. McCord said he was told
by Mrs. Hunt the money came from
the Nixon campaign through certain
lawyers.
Denial
The re-election committee denied it
had done anything illegal, but didn't
contest Kalmbach's statement about
payments to the Watergate
wiretappers. It described the GAO's
conclusions as incomplete, inaccurate,
unbalanced, sensational, premature,
unsupported, hastily drafted and
arbitrary.
In forwarding the report to the
Justice Department for consideration,
the GAO said Kalmbach's transactions
appeared to violate the federal
campaign spending law that took
effect April 7 last year.
The Senate investigating committee
had planned to lay the groundwork at
its hearings by proceeding first with
the break-ins of the Democratic party
headquarters last Memorial Day and
June 17, when McCord and four
others were arrested.

Denial
The re-election committee denied it
had done anything illegal, but didn't

conclusions as incomplete, inaccurate,

unsupported, hastily drafted and
arbitrary.
In forwarding the report to the
Justice Department for consideration,
the GAO said Kalmbach's transactions
appeared to violate the federal
campaign spending law that took
effect April 7 last year.

From The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - Sen. Sam J. Ervin
(D-N.C.) said yesterday it is highly
improbable his Senate Watergate
investigating committee will question
or seek a written statement from
President Nixon about any
involvement in the scandal.
The testimony Friday by convicted
Watergate burglar James McCord that
offers of executive clemency were
made to buy his silence "is not
evidence against the President," Ervin
said.
The North Carolina Democrat spoke
on the ABC television program "Issues
and Answers," amid indications that
the committee hearings were speeded
up by McCord's statements and new
disclosures by government auditors of
money funneled to the Watergate
conspirators.
Hearings Resume
The committee's televised hearings
resume at 7 a.m. (PDT) tomorrow
with McCord still the witness.
He is expected to be questioned
closely about his statement Friday
that as security chief of the
Committee for the Re-election of the
President he received daily intelligence
reports from the Internal Security
Division of the Justice Department.
Committee investigators said they
will want to know whether
government wiretap information was
included.
"We already know of FBI wiretaps
on reporters and White House aides,"
one investigator said. "We know about
the Watergate taps. But there may
have been 25 or 100 Watergates we
don't know about yet that were
carried out by the government and
turned over to the Nixon re-election
committee."
McCord's testimony is likely to lead
the committee to call Robert C.

Mardian, former head of the Internal
Security Division and later a Nixon
re-election campaign official.
Personal Lawyer
Auditors for the General
Accounting Office (GAO) said
Saturday that President Nixon's
former personal lawyer, Herbert W.
Kalmbach, told them he collected and
paid at least $210,000 "for
distribution through intermediaries to
the Watergate defendants or their
attorneys."
Most of the money, according to
the GAO report, came from Maurice
Stans and Frederick C. Laßue — two
officials of the re-election campaign —
last summer after the arrest of the
bugging crew.
The GAO also reported that
Thomas V. Jones, president and
chairman of Northrop Corp., gave at
least $50,000 to the fund, but thought
it was a campaign contribution that
would be reported as such. It wasn't
reported, the GAO said.
Stanford Trustee
Jones, 52, has been a member of
Stanford's Board of Trustees since
1968 and resides in Los Angeles. He
also serves on the Board of Directors
of the Stanford Research Institute.
The GAO said Stans, the former
commerce secretary recently indicted
by a New York grand jury, admitted
giving $75,100 to Kalmbach but said
he contended it wasn't campaign

money and that he was unaware the
money was intended for the Watergate
defendants.
Laßue declined to talk to
investigators, the GAO said.
