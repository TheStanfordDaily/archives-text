# ASSU Co-Presidents Blast Cambodia Bombing Raids
## 
### JOAN HINMAN 
At a press conference held Friday at
San Francisco International Airport,
ASSU co-presidents Kevin O'Grady,
Jim Friend, Beth Garfield, and Charles
Ogletree presented a statement
condemning the bombing of Cambodia
and imploring congressional action.
Also present at the press conference
was Congressman Paul N. McCloskey
(R-Menlo Park). McCloskey was
invited to attend the press conference
by the students because of what
Friend termed "his continued efforts
in Congress" to put an end to the war.
The statement which was read by
O'Grady was also signed by eight other
student body presidents from the Bay
Area. The presidents said:
'Insulted'
"We are insulted by presidential
statements that contend that the war
is over. We abhor the executive
arrogance that insists that the president
has the power to continue to wage this
war.
"But on a more favorable note we
are very encouraged by recent
Congressional developments that
indicate finally that Congress is willing
to take a stand against the president
and assert its constitutional authority
by cutting off funding for the war."
So far this position has been
adopted by the heads of the student
governments at Stanford, UC
Berkeley, UC Davis, Cal State San

Francisco, Cal State San Jose,
University of San Francisco,
University of the Pacific, Canada
College, and Foothill College. But
Friend indicated that additional
endorsers are still being sought.
'Glad'
In reaction to the statement,
McCloskey commented, "I'm glad to
see you do this. I thought the student
movement had died once the draft was
over."
Garfield replied, "Well, we didn't
want people to think that."
During a question and answer
period which followed the official
statement, the ASSU council was
asked whether their effort was made
on behalf of the total student body, or
whether this was a personal statement.
Friend explained that the statement
was not made on behalf of the student
body, but that the group made the
statement "as student body
presidents."
McCloskey defended the presidents'
statement, saying,"You don't need to
poll the students to ascertain their
views. Two years ago during the
invasion of Cambodia they were 100
percent against the war."
"Now that the majority of
Americans condemn the war, it only
stands to reason that they are just as
opposed as they were two years ago
when everyone supported the war."

in Congress" to put an end to the war.
The statement which was read by
O'Grady was also signed by eight other
student body presidents from the Bay
Area. The presidents said:
'Insulted'
"We are insulted by presidential
statements that contend that the war
is over. We abhor the executive
arrogance that insists that the president
has the power to continue to wage this
war.
"But on a more favorable note we
are very encouraged by recent
Congressional developments that
indicate finally that Congress is willing
to take a stand against the president
and assert its constitutional authority
by cutting off funding for the war."
So far this position has been
adopted by the heads of the student
governments at Stanford, UC
Berkeley, UC Davis, Cal State San

Francisco, Cal State San Jose,
University of San Francisco,
University of the Pacific, Canada
College, and Foothill College. But
Friend indicated that additional
endorsers are still being sought.
'Glad'
In reaction to the statement,
McCloskey commented, "I'm glad to
see you do this. I thought the student
movement had died once the draft was
over."
Garfield replied, "Well, we didn't
want people to think that."
During a question and answer
period which followed the official
statement, the ASSU council was
asked whether their effort was made
on behalf of the total student body, or
whether this was a personal statement.
Friend explained that the statement
was not made on behalf of the student
body, but that the group made the
statement "as student body
presidents."
McCloskey defended the presidents'
statement, saying,"You don't need to
poll the students to ascertain their
views. Two years ago during the
invasion of Cambodia they were 100
percent against the war."
"Now that the majority of
Americans condemn the war, it only
stands to reason that they are just as
opposed as they were two years ago
when everyone supported the war."
