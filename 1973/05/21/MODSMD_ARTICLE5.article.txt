# Reading Device Offers Blind Better Opportunities
## 
### JOAN HINMAN 
Candy Linvill, a 21-year-old
psychology major, will read this
morning's Daily without the use of
Braille despite the fact that she is
blind. Candy will use the Optacon, an
electronic device which allows the
blind to feel the shapes of letters on a
printed page.
The Optacon, or "optical-to-tactical
converter," is the invention of Candy's
father, Dr. John G. Linvill, chairman
of the Department of Electrical
Engineering.
The current Optacon consists of
two parts: a camera about the size of a
pocket knife, and a device about the
size of a textbook which holds a
tactile display screen.
The reader guides the tiny silicon
retina of the camera over the print
with his right hand. The image of the
print is then relayed to the tactile
display screen.
The tactile screen is made up of 144
small vibrating pins arranged in a six
by 24 pin array. The array is one half
inch by one inch, just the size of a
fingertip. While guiding the camera,
the blind reader rests a finger of his
left hand on the array and feels the
shapes of the letters as they are
formed by the vibrating pins.
Speedy
Candy Linvill is able to read at 90
words per minute, or about half her
Braille reading speed, using the

Optacon. Although this is too slow to
be practical for long reading
assignments, the Optacon has given the
blind some unique opportunities.
At a rehabilitation center in
Heidelberg, West Germany, 15 men
have been trained to program
computers through use of the
Optacon; previously it was necessary
to build computers which could do
printouts in Braille.
According to Linvill, 13 of the 15
programmers are already employed,
"and the 14th one was holding out for
higher wages."
Along with computer programming,
the Optacon can be used to work out
complex mathematical formulae.
Lorin Schoof, a blind research
associate to the Optacon project, uses
the device to read the answers to
problems which he works out on a
pocket calculator. Candy Linvill used
the Optacon with success in the
statistics course required for her
major.
A recent development may make it
possible for readers to increase their
reading speed beyond 90 words per
minute. A one-hand Optacon the size
of a pack of king size cigarettes has
been simulated.
One-Hander
The one-hand device will house
both the silicon retina and the tactile
array, allowing the reader to guide the
camera and feel the print with the

same hand.
Because the present two-hand
system involves a more complicated
neurological pathway than
the one-hand system would employ, it
is believed that the reading speed may
increase.
Candy Linvill has trained with the
one-hand Optacon for about four
hours, yet she has already matched her
two-hand speed. Because the one-hand
device would be extremely compact
and battery operated, it would
represent a tremendous convenience
for the blind.
"What the Optacon really gives the
blind person is independence, so that
he doesn't have to have someone there
all the time," explains Dr. Linvill. "It
makes the blind job seeker competitive
in the sighted world."
250 In Use
More than 250 Optacons are in use
at present. The devices are
manufactured by Telesensory Systems
Incorporated (TSI), a small Palo Alto
firm founded in 1971 by Drs. J.C.
Bliss and J.S. Brugler, two project
research associates. TSI produces 25
Optacons a month.
The present price of a two-hand
Optacon is $3500. A training program
is given to the purchaser by TSI for an
additional $500, bringing the total
cost to $4000.
According to Dr. Linvill,
improvements in the device and

increased demand should bring the
price of the Optacon down so that
most blind people will be able to
afford one.
While TSI continues to produce the
two-hand Optacon, research will
continue on the one-hand model.
Linvill predicts that the one-hand
device should be fully developed
within two years.
But, the Office of Education of the
Department of Health, Education, and
Welfare has just cancelled its funds for
the project.
'Garden Of Eden'
"The Office of Education is
unaccustomed to dealing with
technology," states Dr. Linvill
sympathetically, "and they are
absolutely unaccustomed to having to
develop technology on their own.
They're usually in a sort of Garden of
Eden where they are given devices
which have been developed through
the Department of Defense, or the
space program."
Although Dr. Linvill is hopeful that
the project will find alternative
funding, he is not certain that funds
will become available immediately.
"The real tragedy," he explains,
"would be to lose some of our
researchers who are familiar with the
project between the time we lose this
funding and the time we get
alternative funding."

psychology major, will read this
morning's Daily without the use of
Braille despite the fact that she is
blind. Candy will use the Optacon, an
electronic device which allows the
blind to feel the shapes of letters on a
printed page.
The Optacon, or "optical-to-tactical
converter," is the invention of Candy's
father, Dr. John G. Linvill, chairman
of the Department of Electrical
Engineering.
The current Optacon consists of
two parts: a camera about the size of a
pocket knife, and a device about the
size of a textbook which holds a
tactile display screen.
The reader guides the tiny silicon
retina of the camera over the print
with his right hand. The image of the
print is then relayed to the tactile
display screen.
The tactile screen is made up of 144
small vibrating pins arranged in a six
by 24 pin array. The array is one half
inch by one inch, just the size of a
fingertip. While guiding the camera,
the blind reader rests a finger of his
left hand on the array and feels the
shapes of the letters as they are
formed by the vibrating pins.
Speedy
Candy Linvill is able to read at 90
words per minute, or about half her
Braille reading speed, using the

Optacon. Although this is too slow to
be practical for long reading
assignments, the Optacon has given the
blind some unique opportunities.
At a rehabilitation center in
Heidelberg, West Germany, 15 men
have been trained to program
computers through use of the
Optacon; previously it was necessary
to build computers which could do
printouts in Braille.
According to Linvill, 13 of the 15
programmers are already employed,
"and the 14th one was holding out for
higher wages."
Along with computer programming,
the Optacon can be used to work out
complex mathematical formulae.
Lorin Schoof, a blind research
associate to the Optacon project, uses
the device to read the answers to
problems which he works out on a
pocket calculator. Candy Linvill used
the Optacon with success in the
statistics course required for her
major.
A recent development may make it
possible for readers to increase their
reading speed beyond 90 words per
minute. A one-hand Optacon the size
of a pack of king size cigarettes has
been simulated.
One-Hander
The one-hand device will house
both the silicon retina and the tactile
array, allowing the reader to guide the
camera and feel the print with the

same hand.
Because the present two-hand
system involves a more complicated
neurological pathway than
the one-hand system would employ, it
is believed that the reading speed may
increase.
Candy Linvill has trained with the
one-hand Optacon for about four
hours, yet she has already matched her
two-hand speed. Because the one-hand
device would be extremely compact
and battery operated, it would
represent a tremendous convenience
for the blind.
"What the Optacon really gives the
blind person is independence, so that
he doesn't have to have someone there
all the time," explains Dr. Linvill. "It
makes the blind job seeker competitive
in the sighted world."
250 In Use
More than 250 Optacons are in use
at present. The devices are
manufactured by Telesensory Systems
Incorporated (TSI), a small Palo Alto
firm founded in 1971 by Drs. J.C.
Bliss and J.S. Brugler, two project
research associates. TSI produces 25
Optacons a month.
The present price of a two-hand
Optacon is $3500. A training program
is given to the purchaser by TSI for an
additional $500, bringing the total
cost to $4000.
According to Dr. Linvill,
improvements in the device and

increased demand should bring the
price of the Optacon down so that
most blind people will be able to
afford one.
While TSI continues to produce the
two-hand Optacon, research will
continue on the one-hand model.
Linvill predicts that the one-hand
device should be fully developed
within two years.
But, the Office of Education of the
Department of Health, Education, and
Welfare has just cancelled its funds for
the project.
'Garden Of Eden'
"The Office of Education is
unaccustomed to dealing with
technology," states Dr. Linvill
sympathetically, "and they are
absolutely unaccustomed to having to
develop technology on their own.
They're usually in a sort of Garden of
Eden where they are given devices
which have been developed through
the Department of Defense, or the
space program."
Although Dr. Linvill is hopeful that
the project will find alternative
funding, he is not certain that funds
will become available immediately.
"The real tragedy," he explains,
"would be to lose some of our
researchers who are familiar with the
project between the time we lose this
funding and the time we get
alternative funding."

Braille despite the fact that she is
blind. Candy will use the Optacon, an
electronic device which allows the
blind to feel the shapes of letters on a
printed page.
The Optacon, or "optical-to-tactical
converter," is the invention of Candy's
father, Dr. John G. Linvill, chairman
of the Department of Electrical
Engineering.
The current Optacon consists of
two parts: a camera about the size of a
pocket knife, and a device about the
size of a textbook which holds a
tactile display screen.
The reader guides the tiny silicon
retina of the camera over the print
with his right hand. The image of the
print is then relayed to the tactile
display screen.
The tactile screen is made up of 144
small vibrating pins arranged in a six
by 24 pin array. The array is one half
inch by one inch, just the size of a
fingertip. While guiding the camera,
the blind reader rests a finger of his
left hand on the array and feels the
shapes of the letters as they are
formed by the vibrating pins.
Speedy
Candy Linvill is able to read at 90
words per minute, or about half her
Braille reading speed, using the

Optacon. Although this is too slow to
be practical for long reading
assignments, the Optacon has given the
blind some unique opportunities.
At a rehabilitation center in
Heidelberg, West Germany, 15 men
have been trained to program
computers through use of the
Optacon; previously it was necessary
to build computers which could do
printouts in Braille.
According to Linvill, 13 of the 15
programmers are already employed,
"and the 14th one was holding out for
higher wages."
Along with computer programming,
the Optacon can be used to work out
complex mathematical formulae.
Lorin Schoof, a blind research
associate to the Optacon project, uses
the device to read the answers to
problems which he works out on a
pocket calculator. Candy Linvill used
the Optacon with success in the
statistics course required for her
major.
A recent development may make it
possible for readers to increase their
reading speed beyond 90 words per
minute. A one-hand Optacon the size
of a pack of king size cigarettes has
been simulated.
One-Hander
The one-hand device will house
both the silicon retina and the tactile
array, allowing the reader to guide the
camera and feel the print with the

same hand.
Because the present two-hand
system involves a more complicated
neurological pathway than
the one-hand system would employ, it
is believed that the reading speed may
increase.
Candy Linvill has trained with the
one-hand Optacon for about four
hours, yet she has already matched her
two-hand speed. Because the one-hand
device would be extremely compact
and battery operated, it would
represent a tremendous convenience
for the blind.
"What the Optacon really gives the
blind person is independence, so that
he doesn't have to have someone there
all the time," explains Dr. Linvill. "It
makes the blind job seeker competitive
in the sighted world."
250 In Use
More than 250 Optacons are in use
at present. The devices are
manufactured by Telesensory Systems
Incorporated (TSI), a small Palo Alto
firm founded in 1971 by Drs. J.C.
Bliss and J.S. Brugler, two project
research associates. TSI produces 25
Optacons a month.
The present price of a two-hand
Optacon is $3500. A training program
is given to the purchaser by TSI for an
additional $500, bringing the total
cost to $4000.
According to Dr. Linvill,
improvements in the device and

increased demand should bring the
price of the Optacon down so that
most blind people will be able to
afford one.
While TSI continues to produce the
two-hand Optacon, research will
continue on the one-hand model.
Linvill predicts that the one-hand
device should be fully developed
within two years.
But, the Office of Education of the
Department of Health, Education, and
Welfare has just cancelled its funds for
the project.
'Garden Of Eden'
"The Office of Education is
unaccustomed to dealing with
technology," states Dr. Linvill
sympathetically, "and they are
absolutely unaccustomed to having to
develop technology on their own.
They're usually in a sort of Garden of
Eden where they are given devices
which have been developed through
the Department of Defense, or the
space program."
Although Dr. Linvill is hopeful that
the project will find alternative
funding, he is not certain that funds
will become available immediately.
"The real tragedy," he explains,
"would be to lose some of our
researchers who are familiar with the
project between the time we lose this
funding and the time we get
alternative funding."
