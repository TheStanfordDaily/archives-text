## No Safe-Way Out Of It 
### 
One of the emerging social
issues that seems determined to
linger through the spring and
summer is the Teamsters-United
Farm Workers battle. Unlike the
grape boycott a few years back,
the current issues are more subtle
and less dramatic. What it boils
down to is whether farm workers
are going to be able to choose
which union they want to
represent them.
A major side issue has been the
boycotting of Safeway
supermarkets, the nation's largest
chain with headquarters in
Oakland. While this writer could
easily bid bon voyage to grapes
and non-UFW iceberg lettuce,
saying so long to Safeway for an
indefinite period isn't so easy.
Just think of the Safeway
brands that have become part of
the contemporary American
environment. Busy Baker oatmeal
snaps, LaLani Pineapple Tidbits,
Crown Colony spices, Party Pride
potato chips, Bel Air frozen grape
drink — all these can be given up.
But.. . Mrs. Wright — how can
this writer say goodbye to Mrs.
Wright, the namesake of
Safeway's brand label for cakes,
cupcakes, super enriched white
bread, lady fingers?
A Doubt
To be frank, there has always
been a doubt in my mind whether
Mrs. Wright actually exists. Like
Betty Crocker, Poppin Fresh, and
Hungry Jack, she has always
maintained a fantasy aura about
her. If this writer were to
construct a anthropomorphism,
Mrs. Wright would probably be a
white-haired, thin lady, with
horn-rimmed glasses who worked
in a little bakery shop until
discovered by a Safeway talent
scout.
"How about a ginger snap,
dearie," Mrs. Wright might have
said to the blazer-bedecked
Safeway advance man.
"Thanks, baby. Th&e snaps are
whamo, I mean they take off!"
"They're just my regular batch.
You oughtta try one of these
vanilla wafers — made with the
real thing."
Hot Stuff
Chomp, chomp. "Hot stuff.
Say, how'd you like to sign with
the big S; your name will be on
every angel food cake sold. You'll
be the most looked-at name at
meal time since the Swiss Miss."
Well, the offer was too good to
refuse, probably. Today Mrs.
Wright reigns as Safeway's bakery
queen, perched on a throne of
spiced hot cross buns.
So this writer is faced with a
moral crisis. Does he continue his
sweet affair (ugh, terrible pun)
with Mrs. Wright or does he
abstain from buying Safeway
goods until the Farm Workers
Union, the growers, and Safeway
settle their differences? My
decision follows.
Mrs. Wright, Bakery Department
Safeway Stores
Oakland, California
Dear Mrs. Wright,
This is my first letter to you,
so I hope you won't be offended
that I used a comma instead of a
colon in the saluation. To be
frank, I have to tell you that this
affair we've been having in the
aisles of the local Safeway is over
for the time being.
Don't take this personally. I've
enjoyed your sourdough English
muffins, your heat-n-serve parker
house rolls, your cocoanut creme
pies. Your coffee cakes have been
deelish. And those prune danish —
fantastique!
But the Safeway stores have

been making life very difficult for
the United Farm Workers who
have been trying to bring about a
decent way of life for the
hard-working people who toil in
the fields of California. Safeway
has avoided UFW products and
has been very snug with the
Teamsters, a union which was
tossed out of the AFL-CIO. Now,
even the Bakers Union is a
member of the AFL-CIO. And so

Daniel Brenner

is UFW.
So, Mrs. Wright, I trust you
will understand why we won't be
getting together for a while. Even
if you are a figment of
somebody's imagination, it is not
too hard to realize that everyone
needs his daily bread.
Even the farm workers.

Mrs. Wright, Bakery Department
Safeway Stores
Oakland, California
Dear Mrs. Wright,
This is my first letter to you,
so I hope you won't be offended
that I used a comma instead of a
colon in the saluation. To be
frank, I have to tell you that this
affair we've been having in the
aisles of the local Safeway is over
for the time being.
Don't take this personally. I've
enjoyed your sourdough English
muffins, your heat-n-serve parker
house rolls, your cocoanut creme
pies. Your coffee cakes have been
deelish. And those prune danish —
fantastique!
But the Safeway stores have

been making life very difficult for
the United Farm Workers who
have been trying to bring about a
decent way of life for the
hard-working people who toil in
the fields of California. Safeway
has avoided UFW products and
has been very snug with the
Teamsters, a union which was
tossed out of the AFL-CIO. Now,
even the Bakers Union is a
member of the AFL-CIO. And so

Daniel Brenner

is UFW.
So, Mrs. Wright, I trust you
will understand why we won't be
getting together for a while. Even
if you are a figment of
somebody's imagination, it is not
too hard to realize that everyone
needs his daily bread.
Even the farm workers.
(Daniel Brenner's column
appears on this page every
Monday.)
One of the emerging social
issues that seems determined to
linger through the spring and
summer is the Teamsters-United
Farm Workers battle. Unlike the
grape boycott a few years back,
the current issues are more subtle
and less dramatic. What it boils
down to is whether farm workers
are going to be able to choose
which union they want to
represent them.
A major side issue has been the
boycotting of Safeway
supermarkets, the nation's largest
chain with headquarters in
Oakland. While this writer could
easily bid bon voyage to grapes
and non-UFW iceberg lettuce,
saying so long to Safeway for an
indefinite period isn't so easy.
Just think of the Safeway
brands that have become part of
the contemporary American
environment. Busy Baker oatmeal
snaps, LaLani Pineapple Tidbits,
Crown Colony spices, Party Pride
potato chips, Bel Air frozen grape
drink — all these can be given up.
But.. . Mrs. Wright — how can
this writer say goodbye to Mrs.
Wright, the namesake of
Safeway's brand label for cakes,
cupcakes, super enriched white
bread, lady fingers?
A Doubt
To be frank, there has always
been a doubt in my mind whether
Mrs. Wright actually exists. Like
Betty Crocker, Poppin Fresh, and
Hungry Jack, she has always
maintained a fantasy aura about
her. If this writer were to
construct a anthropomorphism,
Mrs. Wright would probably be a
white-haired, thin lady, with
horn-rimmed glasses who worked
in a little bakery shop until
discovered by a Safeway talent
scout.
"How about a ginger snap,
dearie," Mrs. Wright might have
said to the blazer-bedecked
Safeway advance man.
"Thanks, baby. Th&e snaps are
whamo, I mean they take off!"
"They're just my regular batch.
You oughtta try one of these
vanilla wafers — made with the
real thing."
Hot Stuff
Chomp, chomp. "Hot stuff.
Say, how'd you like to sign with
the big S; your name will be on
every angel food cake sold. You'll
be the most looked-at name at
meal time since the Swiss Miss."
Well, the offer was too good to
refuse, probably. Today Mrs.
Wright reigns as Safeway's bakery
queen, perched on a throne of
spiced hot cross buns.
So this writer is faced with a
moral crisis. Does he continue his
sweet affair (ugh, terrible pun)
with Mrs. Wright or does he
abstain from buying Safeway
goods until the Farm Workers
Union, the growers, and Safeway
settle their differences? My
decision follows.
