Ever since I wrote the article
on the Dollies (May 14), I have
either been praised as a crusading
muckraker or lambasted as a cynic
and a liar. When the wave of
criticism hit, I carefully re-read
my notes from the interviews to
check for misquotations or
quotations out of context, and
could not find either error.
In my opinion, the views of
three Dollies on the woman's role
in society cast the worst light on
them and most clearly affirmed
the popular belief in a "dolly
image." Fresh from a Campus
Crusade "Feminar," Defflte,
Jubina, and Jenks were clear in
their definition of woman as
"Adam's rib," compassionate,
submissive and dependent.
According to them, a woman
cannot be a whole person until
she has a man beside her; her
identity can never be found in a
career. Any work after college
would stop when the girls have
children. I think my impression of
these girls as more family- and
marriage-oriented than
career-oriented is an accurate one.
I began the story looking for a
refutation of the "dolly image,"
but unfortunately, I found little
basis for such an argument. In the
30-minute to one-hour interviews
with each girl, I asked a variety of
questions and specifically sought
answers which would bring out
individuality. The Dollies had
little information to offer on their
interests apart from dancing and
school. In fact, the only outside
interest I was told about and
failed to report was Jenks' hobby
of waterskiing. To most of my
queries concerning controversial
topics, the Dollies had no
comment at all. For instance, only
Jackie Nelson had a clear opinion
on the Watergate affair; the other
four said they did not know
enough about it to have an
opinion.
I stand by my honesty as a
reporter, and although I did not
foresee the ensuing violent
reactions, I do not regret the
manner in which I wrote the
article. If I could have spent a
week with each Dolly and if they
had given me more material from
which to work, my impressions
might have been different.

To: President Richard Lyman
With all due respect to your
position as president of this
University we wish to correct you
on your statements to the Daily
(May 16).
From your statements to the
Daily it appears that you are
under the impression that our
complaint to HEW is based on the

Law School's admissions policies
when in fact the thrust of our
complaint is based on the
employment, recruitment and
financial assistance policies. This
is not to imply that we have
abandoned the possibility of
initiating legal action against the
Law School's Chicano admissions
policies.
At this point, we are
particularly interested in having
HEW investigate the violations of
the "Affirmative Action Program"
under Executive Order 11246.
With respect to your comments
that "It's a little hard to see what
HEW can do ..we also refer
you to the October 1, 1972
memorandum directed to your
office from J. Stanley Pottinger,
Director, Office for Civil Rights.

I heartily add my voice to that
of P.A. Trout in protest of bicycle
registration (May 17). Friends, do
you realize that this is far worse
than creeping in loco parentis? To
me, with my corn-fed background
of American democracy, any
compulsory payment of money to
any government agency for
services questionably rendered is a
tax — and personally, I don't feel
that the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's chief clerk represents me.
Consider my plight, friends: I
have a bicycle that used to be a
3-speed. Now it had only one:
low. It had one brake and a lot of
rust. I couldn't sell it for a dollar.
My only hope is to let them take
it from me, and hope I won't be
traced through my fingerprints.
After all, I could be charged with
negligence, abandonment, tax
evasion. Oh, God, is there no
justice?

By the standards of today's
woman I am remarkably
unliberated (I can easily find it
within me, however, to smile at
the humility of several of the
'73-'74 Dollies who have
graciously informed us that
"women are made for marriage."
Sweeties, there are other things in
life.... Anyway, in the
innocence of my unliberatedness
— and incidentally from my firm
belief in each person's right to
control his or her own life — I
think it was up to the infamous
Phi Delt rafflee to decide what she
wanted to do that evening — and
that it was NO ONE'S prerogative
to judge either her or the Phi
Delts. Furthermore, itseemsto me
that the loud squawks of
indignation that have issued from
the avenging libbers decrying what
after all is really not their business
— and libbers, don't tell me that
every woman's business is your
business because I'm a woman and
you can just leave me to decide
when I'm being persecuted — is
just the type of behavior a
meddling, busybody unliberated
woman would be expected to
engage in.
Also, at the risk of receiving a
deluge of propositioning phone
calls — to which I say "pfarn!" —
I'd like to ask why all the "poor,
horny Stanford guys" (to quote
Tad Simons and Chip Marris in
their letter printed May 16) aren't
doing something about mitigating
their problem — such as asking
some damsels out. Upon arrival
here as a freshman girl, I was
warned that social life was likely
to be flat because all the guys
were so shy. If that's the case (and
it's either that or you're just not
interested), any uncomfortable
consequences are really you guys'
fault.

the popular belief in a "dolly
image." Fresh from a Campus
Crusade "Feminar," Defflte,
Jubina, and Jenks were clear in
their definition of woman as
"Adam's rib," compassionate,
submissive and dependent.
According to them, a woman
cannot be a whole person until
she has a man beside her; her
identity can never be found in a
career. Any work after college
would stop when the girls have
children. I think my impression of
these girls as more family- and
marriage-oriented than
career-oriented is an accurate one.
I began the story looking for a
refutation of the "dolly image,"
but unfortunately, I found little
basis for such an argument. In the
30-minute to one-hour interviews
with each girl, I asked a variety of
questions and specifically sought
answers which would bring out
individuality. The Dollies had
little information to offer on their
interests apart from dancing and
school. In fact, the only outside
interest I was told about and
failed to report was Jenks' hobby
of waterskiing. To most of my
queries concerning controversial
topics, the Dollies had no
comment at all. For instance, only
Jackie Nelson had a clear opinion
on the Watergate affair; the other
four said they did not know
enough about it to have an
opinion.
I stand by my honesty as a
reporter, and although I did not
foresee the ensuing violent
reactions, I do not regret the
manner in which I wrote the
article. If I could have spent a

had given me more material from

With all due respect to your
position as president of this
University we wish to correct you
on your statements to the Daily
(May 16).
From your statements to the
Daily it appears that you are
under the impression that our
complaint to HEW is based on the

Law School's admissions policies
when in fact the thrust of our
complaint is based on the
employment, recruitment and
financial assistance policies. This
is not to imply that we have
abandoned the possibility of
initiating legal action against the
Law School's Chicano admissions
policies.
At this point, we are
particularly interested in having
HEW investigate the violations of
the "Affirmative Action Program"
under Executive Order 11246.
With respect to your comments
that "It's a little hard to see what
HEW can do ..we also refer

I heartily add my voice to that
of P.A. Trout in protest of bicycle
registration (May 17). Friends, do
you realize that this is far worse
than creeping in loco parentis? To
me, with my corn-fed background
of American democracy, any
compulsory payment of money to
any government agency for
services questionably rendered is a
tax — and personally, I don't feel
that the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's chief clerk represents me.
Consider my plight, friends: I
have a bicycle that used to be a
3-speed. Now it had only one:
low. It had one brake and a lot of
rust. I couldn't sell it for a dollar.
My only hope is to let them take
it from me, and hope I won't be
traced through my fingerprints.
After all, I could be charged with
negligence, abandonment, tax
evasion. Oh, God, is there no
justice?

think it was up to the infamous
Phi Delt rafflee to decide what she

every woman's business is your
business because I'm a woman and
you can just leave me to decide
when I'm being persecuted — is
just the type of behavior a
meddling, busybody unliberated
woman would be expected to
engage in.
Also, at the risk of receiving a
deluge of propositioning phone
calls — to which I say "pfarn!" —
I'd like to ask why all the "poor,
horny Stanford guys" (to quote
Tad Simons and Chip Marris in
their letter printed May 16) aren't
doing something about mitigating
their problem — such as asking
some damsels out. Upon arrival

career-oriented is an accurate one.
I began the story looking for a
refutation of the "dolly image,"
but unfortunately, I found little
basis for such an argument. In the
30-minute to one-hour interviews
with each girl, I asked a variety of
questions and specifically sought
answers which would bring out
individuality. The Dollies had
little information to offer on their
interests apart from dancing and
school. In fact, the only outside
interest I was told about and
failed to report was Jenks' hobby
of waterskiing. To most of my
queries concerning controversial
topics, the Dollies had no
comment at all. For instance, only
Jackie Nelson had a clear opinion
on the Watergate affair; the other
four said they did not know
enough about it to have an
opinion.
I stand by my honesty as a
reporter, and although I did not
foresee the ensuing violent
reactions, I do not regret the
manner in which I wrote the
article. If I could have spent a
week with each Dolly and if they
had given me more material from
which to work, my impressions
might have been different.

To: President Richard Lyman
With all due respect to your
position as president of this
University we wish to correct you
on your statements to the Daily
(May 16).
From your statements to the
Daily it appears that you are
under the impression that our
complaint to HEW is based on the

Law School's admissions policies
when in fact the thrust of our
complaint is based on the
employment, recruitment and
financial assistance policies. This
is not to imply that we have
abandoned the possibility of
initiating legal action against the
Law School's Chicano admissions
policies.
At this point, we are
particularly interested in having
HEW investigate the violations of
the "Affirmative Action Program"
under Executive Order 11246.
With respect to your comments
that "It's a little hard to see what
HEW can do ..we also refer
you to the October 1, 1972
memorandum directed to your
office from J. Stanley Pottinger,
Director, Office for Civil Rights.

I heartily add my voice to that
of P.A. Trout in protest of bicycle
registration (May 17). Friends, do
you realize that this is far worse
than creeping in loco parentis? To
me, with my corn-fed background
of American democracy, any
compulsory payment of money to
any government agency for
services questionably rendered is a
tax — and personally, I don't feel
that the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's chief clerk represents me.
Consider my plight, friends: I
have a bicycle that used to be a
3-speed. Now it had only one:
low. It had one brake and a lot of
rust. I couldn't sell it for a dollar.
My only hope is to let them take
it from me, and hope I won't be
traced through my fingerprints.
After all, I could be charged with
negligence, abandonment, tax
evasion. Oh, God, is there no
justice?

By the standards of today's
woman I am remarkably
unliberated (I can easily find it
within me, however, to smile at
the humility of several of the
'73-'74 Dollies who have
graciously informed us that
"women are made for marriage."
Sweeties, there are other things in
life.... Anyway, in the
innocence of my unliberatedness
— and incidentally from my firm
belief in each person's right to
control his or her own life — I
think it was up to the infamous
Phi Delt rafflee to decide what she
wanted to do that evening — and
that it was NO ONE'S prerogative
to judge either her or the Phi
Delts. Furthermore, itseemsto me
that the loud squawks of
indignation that have issued from
the avenging libbers decrying what
after all is really not their business
— and libbers, don't tell me that
every woman's business is your
business because I'm a woman and
you can just leave me to decide
when I'm being persecuted — is
just the type of behavior a
meddling, busybody unliberated
woman would be expected to
engage in.
Also, at the risk of receiving a
deluge of propositioning phone
calls — to which I say "pfarn!" —
I'd like to ask why all the "poor,
horny Stanford guys" (to quote
Tad Simons and Chip Marris in
their letter printed May 16) aren't
doing something about mitigating
their problem — such as asking
some damsels out. Upon arrival
here as a freshman girl, I was
warned that social life was likely
to be flat because all the guys
were so shy. If that's the case (and
it's either that or you're just not
interested), any uncomfortable
consequences are really you guys'
fault.

Ever since I wrote the article
on the Dollies (May 14), I have
either been praised as a crusading
muckraker or lambasted as a cynic
and a liar. When the wave of
criticism hit, I carefully re-read
my notes from the interviews to
check for misquotations or
quotations out of context, and
could not find either error.
In my opinion, the views of
three Dollies on the woman's role
in society cast the worst light on
them and most clearly affirmed
the popular belief in a "dolly
image." Fresh from a Campus
Crusade "Feminar," Defflte,
Jubina, and Jenks were clear in
their definition of woman as
"Adam's rib," compassionate,
submissive and dependent.
According to them, a woman
cannot be a whole person until
she has a man beside her; her
identity can never be found in a
career. Any work after college
would stop when the girls have
children. I think my impression of
these girls as more family- and
marriage-oriented than
career-oriented is an accurate one.
