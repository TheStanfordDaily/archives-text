# What You Bring Is What You Get
## I-Center: University Of Culture 
### 
Man's old dream of transforming the world into a harmonious
community is still not dead. Hopefully. Is not the cosmopolitan
population of such a "city" as Stanford the ideal ground to develop,
at a micro level, such a project? We read that the percentage of foreign
citizens out of the total number of students at Stanford is one of the
highest ones among the US Universities: around 12%.
We also know that one of the major characteristics of Stanford
University is to encourage the students to live on campus by providing
them with a remarkable variety of housing programs, both from the
standpoint of the number and of the diversity of the options offered.
Where could be a better environment?

When we look at some figures we realize how Stanford represents
not only a university of disciplines of knowledge, but also a university
of cultures with among the 12% of foreign students on campus, and
without including their family members: 423 students from Asia, 383
from Latin America, 321 from Europe, 108 from the Middle-East and
North Africa, 38 from Africa and 32 from the Pacific Basin (Fall 1972
figures).
Unique Opportunity
There is a unique opportunity and a reason for enthusiasm for all
those who dream, write and overwhelm us with their ideas about
"synergy," "international re-education," "conflict resolution,"
"multi-ethnicism,""bi-cultural training programs," ...and for all
those, more or less idealistic, who want to lay the bases for the
development of mutual understanding. Here can be worked out the
projects that will influence a community of individuals who will soon
be leaders in their own societies.
One such basis is the International Center. Sometimes confused
with a club, the International Center is more like an embassy, where
advice, services and information are available to anyone, or more like
a forum, where ideas and opinions are exchanged. To some it is like a
commune, where experiences and lives are shared.
The growing population and diversity of foreign elements have
made the I-Center more creative and innovative in the recent past.
Among the activities favoring cross-cultural exchanges and
comparisons that have been displayed recently, we can note the
year-long series of conference-discussions around the fashionable
topic: "The Earth and Its Limits," the Monday series of foreign
movies, the Sunday international cooking dinners, the weekly
discussion-lunches, the regular art exhibits, the recent party between
Europeans and American students about travel or studies in Europe,
and the weekly KZSU confrontations between American and
non-American students' on timely topics (this program, "World
Views," is aired on Wednesdays at 7:30 p.m., on 90.1 FM).
General Apathy
Despite its creativity, the I-Center has suffered the general apathy
that seems to characterize most institutions nowadays, as far as
participation and voting behavior are concerned. It seems that voting
is no more a duty and is nothing but a chore. Illustrative is the fact
that about 68 million people registered for vote did not vote in the
last American presidential elections of 1972. The Stanford
community at large does not escape the rule, since, with only 3500
votes in the last ASSU elections, it broke a new record.
"The ordinary citizen seemed wholly indifferent to the interests of
the town he lived in. In towns where a semblance of free election had
been retained, he was pressed to go to the voting urns, but he usually
preferred to stay at home. Every student of history knows that this
phenomenon is a common one ...," Alexis de Tocqueville wrote in
the 1850's.
Has the average voter become lazy or has he gained so much
wisdom that he knows, in advance, what to expect? A new system has
been designed that would consist in casting one's vote through the
mail, simply by dropping a postcard into the closest mailbox instead
of running to the urns.
Tired Electorate
Is that enough? The electorate is tired of having to choose between
two of a same kind or to have to express a "no" or a "yes" about a
"wrong" issue.
The philosophy of the advisory committee (around Lee Zeigler,
director of the I-Center) is that the issues are up to you. What you
bring is what you get!
Here is your chance! If you care about the life at Stanford, and if
you want to make it a profitable and enriching cultural experience,
then we urge you to submit your name as a nominee for one of the
ten positions to be elected to the advisory council of your I-Center.
According to the Council Charter, ten members have to be elected
during the Spring Quarter, as follows: five foreign students (at least
two from Escondido Village); two U.S. students; one foreign scholar
and two members-at-large from the Stanford community (including
the above categories and not restricted to students.)
Submit your nomination to the I-Center, by Monday May 21st.
The Council needs your support to continue its accomplishments after
one year of existence. The Council is representative of the Stanford
community at large.
