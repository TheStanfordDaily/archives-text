# Internal Espionage Force
## Plan For CIA Revealed 
### 
From The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - Sen. Stuart
Symington (D-Mo.) said yesterday he
has obtained secret White House
documents sketching a plan to use the
CIA and the Pentagon to gather
intelligence information within the
United States.
Symington made the statement in
quoting yesterday afternoon's
testimony of Tom Charles Houston, a
former White House employee, before
a closed session of the Senate Armed
Services Committee.
Symington said the plans did not
specifically include political spying,
and were never implemented.
The acting chairman of the Senate
panel said the apparent thrust of the
plan was to increase the espionage role
of the Central Intelligence Agency and
the Department of Defense within the
United States.
Testifying before the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, former
CIA director Richard Helms described
a meeting between him, H.R.
Haldeman, then the President's chief
of staff and Deputy CIA director,
Army Lt. Gen. Vernon A. Walters.
Haldeman asked Walters to tell
acting FBI director Patrick Gray 111
that an FBI probe of laundering of
Nixon campaign funds through a
Mexican bank would compromise CIA
resources in Mexico.
'President's Wish'
Walters' memo of that meeting, said
Haldeman had turned to Walters and
said, "It is the President's wish that
you go and see Mr. Gray."
Helms said he was in the room at
the time, but cannot specifically recall
whether Haldeman cited Nixon as his
authority.
He did say, however, that he
assumed such a request would not
have been made without the
President's authority.
Helms' Resistance
The meeting, which took place six
days after the break-in at Democratic
headquarters in the Watergate Hotel,
was listed by Helms as one of several
times in which he resisted White House
attempts to involve the agency.
The CIA is forbidden by law from
any domestic intelligence-gathering
role. Military intelligence has been
used in the past only in cases where
there was a threat of civil disturbance
that would require the use of federal
troops.

Symington said some of the
proposals for such a role were
contained in documents hidden by
ousted White House counsel John W.
Dean 111 for a time in a safety deposit
box at a suburban bank.
Much Burglary Possible
The documents "set no limits on
i the amount of burglary" the Central
; Intelligence Agency and the
i Department of Defense could have
been involved in, said Symington.
I Houston, a former aide to Dean,
told the committee that copies of the
plan to gather espionage information
were to go to President Nixon and
White House chief of staff H.R.
Haldeman, Symington said.
Houston testified he dealt only
with Haldeman, not Nixon, according
to Symington.

Gerald L. Warren, deputy press
secretary at the White House, said he
had not seen Houston's testimony. But
he added, on the basis of news reports
there appears to be inaccuracies in the
account Houston gave the committee.
Symington declined to release the
texts of the two sets of documents
because of any adverse impact
affecting national security.
Symington said J. Edgar Hoover,
the late FBI director, resisted
implementation of the White House
proposals. The FBI by law has the
principal responsibility for the nation's
internal security.
In answering newsmen's questions,
Symington did not rule out that
burglaries of foreign embassies were
contemplated within the framework of
the proposals.

Houston testified he dealt only
with Haldeman, not Nixon, according
to Symington.

Gerald L. Warren, deputy press
secretary at the White House, said he
had not seen Houston's testimony. But
he added, on the basis of news reports
there appears to be inaccuracies in the
account Houston gave the committee.
Symington declined to release the
texts of the two sets of documents
because of any adverse impact
affecting national security.
Symington said J. Edgar Hoover,
the late FBI director, resisted
implementation of the White House
proposals. The FBI by law has the
principal responsibility for the nation's
internal security.
In answering newsmen's questions,
Symington did not rule out that
burglaries of foreign embassies were
contemplated within the framework of
the proposals.

WASHINGTON - Sen. Stuart
Symington (D-Mo.) said yesterday he
has obtained secret White House
documents sketching a plan to use the
CIA and the Pentagon to gather
intelligence information within the
United States.
Symington made the statement in
quoting yesterday afternoon's
testimony of Tom Charles Houston, a
former White House employee, before
a closed session of the Senate Armed
Services Committee.
Symington said the plans did not
specifically include political spying,
and were never implemented.
The acting chairman of the Senate
panel said the apparent thrust of the
plan was to increase the espionage role
of the Central Intelligence Agency and
the Department of Defense within the
United States.
Testifying before the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, former
CIA director Richard Helms described
a meeting between him, H.R.
Haldeman, then the President's chief
of staff and Deputy CIA director,
Army Lt. Gen. Vernon A. Walters.
Haldeman asked Walters to tell
acting FBI director Patrick Gray 111
that an FBI probe of laundering of
Nixon campaign funds through a
Mexican bank would compromise CIA
resources in Mexico.
'President's Wish'
Walters' memo of that meeting, said
Haldeman had turned to Walters and
said, "It is the President's wish that
you go and see Mr. Gray."
Helms said he was in the room at
the time, but cannot specifically recall
whether Haldeman cited Nixon as his
authority.
He did say, however, that he
assumed such a request would not
have been made without the
President's authority.
Helms' Resistance
The meeting, which took place six
days after the break-in at Democratic
headquarters in the Watergate Hotel,
was listed by Helms as one of several
times in which he resisted White House
attempts to involve the agency.
The CIA is forbidden by law from
any domestic intelligence-gathering
role. Military intelligence has been
used in the past only in cases where
there was a threat of civil disturbance
that would require the use of federal
troops.

Symington said some of the
proposals for such a role were
contained in documents hidden by
ousted White House counsel John W.
Dean 111 for a time in a safety deposit
box at a suburban bank.
Much Burglary Possible
The documents "set no limits on
i the amount of burglary" the Central
; Intelligence Agency and the
i Department of Defense could have
been involved in, said Symington.
I Houston, a former aide to Dean,
told the committee that copies of the
plan to gather espionage information
were to go to President Nixon and
White House chief of staff H.R.
Haldeman, Symington said.
Houston testified he dealt only
with Haldeman, not Nixon, according
to Symington.
