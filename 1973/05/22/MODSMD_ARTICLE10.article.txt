# Vietnamese 'Detainees'
## Thousands In Prisons 
### 
Raymond Meyer

The Department of Defense
estimates that at least 100,000
citizens of South Vietnam are
imprisoned as "political
detainees." Others estimate
200,000 or more. By this mass
imprisonment of neutralists,
Catholics, Buddhists, politicians,
political activists, journalists,
university and high school
students, the present regime of
South Vietnam hopes to eliminate
or render ineffectual opposition
to its policies and to its continued
existence.
The peace agreement signed by
the U.S. states: "The U.S. is not
committed to any political
tendancy or any personality in
South Vietnam and does not seek
to impose a pro-American regime
in Saigon." Yet since 1967 funds
for South Vietnam's prisons and

police systems have come from
the CIA, AID (U.S. Agency for
International Development) and
the Department of Defense. AID
funds for these prisons in 1973
are $2 million more than in 1972.
On Jan. 7, 1971, the U.S. Navy
Dept. gave $400,000 to a U.S.firm
(Raymond, Morrison,
Knudson-Brown, Root and Jones)
to build 384 new "tiger cages."
As the cease-fire approached,
many political prisoners were
reclassified as common criminals;
their release was thus no longer
required by the terms of the
cease-fire. Many were moved to
isolated jails and their records
destroyed. Many have disappeared
completely. Released prisoners
have told of executions of
"political detainees." According
to information recently received

from other sources the execution
of political prisoners in South
Vietnam continues at the present
time.
The lives of thousands of these
victims of political oppression can
be saved by letters to your
Congressmen insisting that they
force Congress to investigate
Thieu's prisons and our
government's part in funding,
staffing and supporting them, and
by letters of enquiry about
individual prisoners sent to South
Vietnamese officials and to the
prisoners themselves. The released
prisoners mentioned above have
attested to the effectiveness of
such letters in improving the
treatment of prisoners.
The names and locations of
political prisoners in South
Vietnam and the names and
addresses of officials to whom
letters should be sent can be
obtained from the Coalition to
Free South Vietnamese Political
Prisoners, 2302 Ellsworth St.,
