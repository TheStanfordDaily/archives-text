## Shoe Registration 
### 
Artemus Monk

Effective Monday, May 28,
Stanford students, faculty, and
staff will be required by law to
register their shoes with the Santa
Clara County Sheriff's Office,
Lieutenant Paxton Brair
announced today.
"The Stanford area has been
one of the hardest hit by shoe
theft and damage," a statement
from Brair's office reads. "Over
two thousand dollars in shoe
losses were sustained in Frost
Amphitheater alone during the
Miles Davis concert last fall, and
with the skyrocketing shoe prices
on the black market, it is
estimated that three out of five
Stanford people will be walking
barefoot by the end of May."
In a telephone interview with
the Daily, Brair denied that the
registration was intended to cut
back the number of shoes worn.
"The expected result will be just
the opposite," he claimed. "When
the shoe-wearing public falls
under stricter law enforcement,
more and more folks will
naturally turn to shoes. Fear of
shoe disappearance is the big
enemy here."
Brair's report notes that the
number of shoes and boots in this
area has dropped considerably
since the winter of 1908, when
fifteen inches of snow fell on the

Stanford campus. Probably 60 to
70 percent of these shoes were
stolen, the Sheriff's Office
believes. "At least none of the
owners have accounted from them
otherwise," the report states.
"Nor does the growing
popularity of so-called
'orthopedic' sandals explain why
shoes are rarely seen nowadays."
(Such sandals do not fit the
definition of "shoes" under the
law, which states: "Shoes shall
have protective panels, or uppers,
of a material substance forming a
canopy over the toes.")
The report concludes, "Either
we will bring the shoes in this
county up to mandatory
standards by January 1974, or
face an unprecedented rash of
shoe-related injuries."
Stanford students, faculty, and
staff are reminded that they are
required to register all shoes,
without charge, at the Sheriff's
Office by May 28, or face
impoundment of their shoes.
Additionally, any shoes which
cannot legally be worn in Santa
Clara County must be turned over
to the Sheriff's Office for
safekeeping.
