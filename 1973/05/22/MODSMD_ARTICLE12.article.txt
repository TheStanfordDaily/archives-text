Sad Dollies
Editor:
Concerning the article,
"Apolitical Dollies Resent 'Aloof'
Image," at first we thought the
article was a joke. After realizing
that no humor was intended, we
were surprised. We sincerely hope
that these dollies do not represent
very many Freshman women. In
refuting their dolly image, they
portray themselves exactly as
dollies.
It is highly embarrassing to us
— and, we think, to the majority
of Stanford students — to have
the "Stanford woman" saying
things like:
(1) "In politics, I'm ignorant."
(2) "My opinions are not clear
enough for me to know where I
stand on the political spectrum."
(3) "The male is the natural
aggressor and leader, and the
woman is the passive and
compassionate one, submissive to
the man."
(4) "You cause a lot of
problems when you try to switch
the roles around."
(5) "Women were created to
get married."
These five women are entitled
to their opinions just like
everyone else. But it is sad to
think that they in any way
represent Stanford women.

'Sane Male'
Editor:
I would like to make one very
to-the-point comment on the
characters of the Stanford
"pom-pon girls." I am certain that
neither I nor any sane male would
want to have anything to do with
the Stanford doll(ie)s or any other
such imitation women.

Spare Change?
Editor:
In the May 4 issue of the Daily
I am reported as saying that a new
$7.2 million undergraduate
building for chemistry is being
financed by Syntex Corporation
of Palo Alto. Unfortunately, the
facts are that Syntex was kind
enough to pledge $1 million
towards the construction, but
some $6 million remains to be
raised before ground can be
broken.

'Superior Attitudes'
Editor:
What business has Charlene
Peterson (Daily, May 18, 1973) —
or anyone — to publicly pass
judgment on the personal and
political views of the Stanford
Dollies as Dollies? If their position
were to involve anything like
decisions on the allotment of
ASSU funds or a voice in dean's
office policy making, this sort of
evaluation would be fair. As it is,
Dollies are selected and function
on the basis of their
choreographic imagination and
abilities, not as political
representatives or reflections of
the Stanford community.
Regardless of individual political
and social awareness and
preferences or lack thereof, the
recent personal ridiculing of the
Dollies has been cruel and unjust,
manifesting a dearth of clear
vision in sorting out relevant
issues as well as a few suspiciously
superior attitudes.
