# Naftalin Exhibits Musical Expertise
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
Solo playing is one of the
toughest tests of any musician.
Last Monday night in Tresidder,
pianist Mark Naftalin gave a quite
commendable solo performance
of blues, country, and boogie
woogie.
Naftalin has had considerable
experience in ensemble playing
and recording, with a variety of
rock, blues, and gospel musicians,
including the original Paul
Butterfield Blues Band. He has
only recently begun giving solo
concerts, including one here in
February.
He sees solo concerts as a
chance to expand musically, both
in terms of repertoire and within a
given piece of music. On the other
hand, a solo performer obviously
cannot depend upon other
musicians to help him convey the
message of his music.
Feelings Conveyed
Before about 150 people in
Tresidder's Large Lounge,
Naftalin had no trouble conveying
the feelings behind his music —
whatever style he chose to play in.
Although there was an electric
piano set up, he played the entire
first set, about an hour and a half,
on the grand piano. He made good
use of the instruments' range of
tone and dynamics, and played
very clean notes, hardly ever using
the pedals.
He began with some nice, easy,
medium-tempo boogie woogie,
then some slower, brooding blues,
with an occasional country tune
thrown in. While most of his songs
were structurally similar — 12-bar
blues with a "walking " bass line —
there was enough variation in
tempo, lead passages, and general
feel that the set was not in the
least bit boring.
Musical Switch
Naftalin sang several of the
songs, another switch from
ensemble playing. Both on his
own material and songs by others,
his singing carried the same sort of
feeling as his piano, although with
somewhat less intensity.
After a break, he began one
song at the grand, then changed
his mind and switched to the
electric piano, where he started it
again. He only played a few
numbers on the electric, an
instrument which he played most
of the time with Butterfield.
He showed the same degree of
control as on the grand, making
use of the electric piano's unique
tonal qualities, but soon switched
back to the grand, with which
both he and the audience seemed
most comfortable.
One of the nice touches
throughout the show was
Naftalin's handling of applause.
Unlike many performers, he did
not seem anxious to hold out the
applause as long as possible;
rather, he would begin the next
song well before the clapping had
died down.
He certainly did not ignore the

audience, but he seemed more
concerned with the music than
wringing every last bit of response
out of them after each song.
Warm Applause
The applause was warm and
genuine, and there were several
encores. On one, a voice from the
audience requested "something
slow in G." He complied, and was
accompanied by a harmonica.
The harp player, a Sunnyvale
musician named David Holehouse,
played quite well, and before long
was up at the mike, alternately
playing harp and singing.
Naftalin quickly settled back
into his ensemble style, playing
backup with occasional leads.
Occasionally he looked over his
shoulder, nodding his approval of
some of the harp licks.
Throughout the show, I was
impressed by the depth of
expression in Naftalin's music,
especially in his blues numbers. In
addition to technical expertise, he
displayed the kind of feeling that
cannot be faked and which
distinguishes an inspired
performance from a merely
competent one.
