# NY Camerata Lacks Vitality
## 
### BRUCE LAMOTT 
A deservedly small audience
heard The New York Camerata in
an unimaginative performance of
late Baroque and English
Renaissance chamber music in
Dinkelspiel Saturday night. "In
their programs they have explored
the music of many styles and
periods," reads the publicity; and
explore they did, but with few
discoveries.
A Trio Sonata in E Minor by
Boismortier was the appetizer for
the bland diet to follow.
Proficient instrumentalists all —
Paula Hatcher, flute, Charles
Forbes, cello, and Glenn
Jacobson, harpsichord — they
seemed content with playing most
of the right notes at the right
time.
Little dialogue between the
two soloists, no sense of
improvisatory freedom in the slow
movement, and a routine
continuo realization stifled the
vitality of the work.
The pedestrian reading of the
Bach G Major Cello Suite by
Charles Forbes included a
rhythmically amorphous
Sarabande, an agrressive but
ungraceful Menuetto, and a Gigue
whose tempo was unmotivated by
energy or accent.
Particularly disappointing is
the fact that Forbes' technical
accom pishment, careful
intonation, and singing tone gave
him every chance to turn his
attention to musical values.
Understatement
Understatement seems to
characterize their conception of
late Baroque styles, though the

Handel Flute Sonata in A Minor
made no statement at all.
Harmonic changes in the opening
Largo were rendered meaningless
by lack of preparation by either
flute or harpsichord. Though
ornamentation was conspicuously
added, it failed to integrate with
the melodic line.
This was particularly true of
the Lento movement, where a
concluding bravura flourish jolted
the listener out of the character of
the piece. That the cello was
omitted from the continuo line,

though essential to the texture of
this literature, indicates that they
have more discoveries to make in
the performance of this music.
The English Renaissance found
its way onto the program in the
form of three keyboard pieces by
William Byrd transcribed —
"orchestrated" is perhaps the
better term — for recorder and
cello with harpsichord. The trio
had difficulty negotiating the
complex variations, and since
Hatcher's recorder playing was
seldom in tune, the music might
better have been left in its original
form.
Suppressed Excitement
Glenn Jacobson rushed two
Scarlatti harpsichord sonatas

beyond control, suppressing their
intrinsic excitement with
aggression that should be taken
out on a Steinway. The lyric
sonata between them, however,
was the most coherent and
sensitive performance of the
evening.
Concluding the program was
the Concert No. 3 from Rameau's
Pieces de Clavecin en Concerts,
which, for all its technical
demands showed the Camerata to
have little identity as an ensemble.
Though imitative writing pervades

the work, there was little
expressive interplay among the
instruments.
Unimpeded by musical interest
within the structure of the piece,
tempos accelerated out of seeming
boredom. How fitting that the
encore was a truncated version of
the final movement played half
again as fast.
In a brief comment to the
audience, Forbes explained that
because "this medium is terribly
familiar to you all," there would
be no need for additional remarks.
This being the case, such an
audience should expect sensitive
stylistic interpretation, not public
explorations.

Largo were rendered meaningless
by lack of preparation by either
flute or harpsichord. Though
ornamentation was conspicuously
added, it failed to integrate with
the melodic line.
This was particularly true of
the Lento movement, where a
concluding bravura flourish jolted
the listener out of the character of
the piece. That the cello was
omitted from the continuo line,

though essential to the texture of
this literature, indicates that they
have more discoveries to make in
the performance of this music.
The English Renaissance found
its way onto the program in the
form of three keyboard pieces by
William Byrd transcribed —
"orchestrated" is perhaps the
better term — for recorder and
cello with harpsichord. The trio
had difficulty negotiating the
complex variations, and since
Hatcher's recorder playing was
seldom in tune, the music might
better have been left in its original
form.
Suppressed Excitement
Glenn Jacobson rushed two
Scarlatti harpsichord sonatas

beyond control, suppressing their
intrinsic excitement with
aggression that should be taken
out on a Steinway. The lyric
sonata between them, however,
was the most coherent and
sensitive performance of the
evening.
Concluding the program was
the Concert No. 3 from Rameau's
Pieces de Clavecin en Concerts,
which, for all its technical
demands showed the Camerata to
have little identity as an ensemble.
Though imitative writing pervades

the work, there was little
expressive interplay among the
instruments.
Unimpeded by musical interest
within the structure of the piece,
tempos accelerated out of seeming
boredom. How fitting that the
encore was a truncated version of
the final movement played half
again as fast.
In a brief comment to the
audience, Forbes explained that
because "this medium is terribly
familiar to you all," there would
be no need for additional remarks.
This being the case, such an
audience should expect sensitive
stylistic interpretation, not public
explorations.

The 'Daily'
Entertainment
A deservedly small audience
heard The New York Camerata in
an unimaginative performance of
late Baroque and English
Renaissance chamber music in
Dinkelspiel Saturday night. "In
their programs they have explored
the music of many styles and
periods," reads the publicity; and
explore they did, but with few
discoveries.
A Trio Sonata in E Minor by
Boismortier was the appetizer for
the bland diet to follow.
Proficient instrumentalists all —
Paula Hatcher, flute, Charles
Forbes, cello, and Glenn
Jacobson, harpsichord — they
seemed content with playing most
of the right notes at the right
time.
Little dialogue between the
two soloists, no sense of
improvisatory freedom in the slow
movement, and a routine
continuo realization stifled the
vitality of the work.
The pedestrian reading of the
Bach G Major Cello Suite by
Charles Forbes included a
rhythmically amorphous
Sarabande, an agrressive but
ungraceful Menuetto, and a Gigue
whose tempo was unmotivated by
energy or accent.
Particularly disappointing is
the fact that Forbes' technical
accom pishment, careful
intonation, and singing tone gave
him every chance to turn his
attention to musical values.
Understatement
Understatement seems to
characterize their conception of
late Baroque styles, though the

Handel Flute Sonata in A Minor
made no statement at all.
Harmonic changes in the opening
Largo were rendered meaningless
by lack of preparation by either
flute or harpsichord. Though
ornamentation was conspicuously
added, it failed to integrate with
the melodic line.
