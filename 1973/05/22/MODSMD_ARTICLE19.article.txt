Well, here we go again: 1 don 't
know how much more of this /
can take. If you've never seen
these sort of movies, you must go
down to your local theater and
take one in; beyond one, though,
its your own ulcer, not mine.
Today I review films playing at
the O'Farrell Theater and Sutter
Cinema. Once again I remind you:
if the flick you want isn't listed
on the movie page, don't pout —
it'll come again soon.o

"IT HAPPENED IN
HOLLYWOOD" - Last time I
only reviewed the preview for this
movie; today I do the whole
thing. And what a movie! Imagine
a bidet with an Arabian genie
hidden in it, insemination by
telephone, a fire swallower, a
$300 suit pocket filled with crispy
fettucine, donald duck appearing
out of nowhere in a four second
part, and a sound track of a saw
going through wood during every
lovemaking sequence: sound like
something I'd put in one of my
"On The Light Side Columns"?
Well you can see it all, in living
color, at the O'Farrell, and while
you're there, you can buy some
popcorn, candy, or magazines, sit
in a modem and comfy lounge, or
browse through an art gallery of
erotic paintings.
Even the bathroom comes
equipped with Muzak. This movie
spent more money on costumes,
actors, and sets than any I've seen,
the dialogue is unusual in that it
appears to be actually written by
a human, and the many different
soundtracks even correspond to
their proper parts in the movie.
For those of you who read my
last review, you'll know this flick
to be really kinky: the girl wears
the wristwatch! Outrageously
weird and funny, "It Happened In
Hollywood" will spoil you for any
porno movies to come. (That last
sentence is sheer PR — maybe the
theater will use it on its
advertising layout; but then, who
would believe the Stanford

Daily?)
Anyway, go see this flick; if
you're a bit embarassed about
entering such theaters, don't
worry this time: the theater was
packed with people — couples,
young, old — and with all
the publicity this movie is bound
to get, you shouldn't feel in any
way alone or deviant in attending
a showing.

"EVEREADY TREASURE"- In
the number two spot today is this
ancient, mottled, black and white
cartoon, complete with a
background of canned laughter. If
your thing is seeing snakes make
love, or a farmer show affection
toward his donkey, or a "tool
duel," then this short feature is
for you. Remember, though, that
it's only a cartoon. People in the
know at the Sutter say it only
shows occasionally, so you may
want to call ahead.

"JUST PLAIN BILL" - I came in
the middle of this one on its last
showing for that evening, but I
probably didn't miss much.
Evidently, the plot concerns a
plain young man — nobody special
— who gets a lot of casual visitors
coming to and at his house.
The last visitor is a young
woman representing the New
Society of the Blessed Virgin, who
arrives announcing Christ's
coming and leaves announcing her
own. Whether Bill was really saved
is the lingering question, perhaps
it is I who was saved — the film
broke.
"POSITIVELY OUTRAGEOUS"
— The title says it all. Two
couples play strip poker in this
flick. One man and the other
man's wife lose quickly and go off
to the bedroom. The other wife
takes everything off but her
curlers, but the other husband
keeps his clothes and his cool.

Bored to tears, he turns to
Curlers and says, "Put your
clothes back on. You want to play
canasta?" The movie ends with a
rather extended love sequence
between the two wives (sans
curlers).

"SWING THING" - Finishing at
the bottom of the heap is this
story of Suburban swinging,
featuring love on the bathroom
floor, the side of the bathtub, and
atop the dishwasher. One lovely
prefers a cucumber and a banana
to her hubby, while the other
wives like to play "Guess who's
on top of me while I'm
blindfolded."
The only redeeming value to
"Swing Thing" is the background
music song entitled,
"Ding-a-Ling," and the fact that
nobody wears a wristwatch.
"BLUEBOOK" - A real quickie:
Jeff has an illicit affair with a
college Freshman coed (ha, ha,
some freshman). He downs two
six oz. tumblers of gin, then
shows her his little friend, "Mr
Charlie," whom, Jeff adds, will be
waiting for her anytime. The best
part about this one is the
cameraman's shadow passing over
the actors.
"YOUR WIFE OR MINE?" -
This pseudo-documentary on wife
swapping (a narrator at the start
says"it could happen in your
neighborhood") has only two
redeeming virtues: some
interesting camera angles, and a
group grope scene. One of the
husbands keeps his glasses on
during the whole affair, but his
wife makes him take off his socks,
saying that to keep them on
"would be obscene."
This movie is also the winner
of the 'Best Line of the Evening'
Award: during an especially torrid
oral love scene, one encounters
this short conversation: —
"Sheldon — I don't know u we
should be doing this." HE —
"Mmph . . . glumph . . ."
That's all folks!
