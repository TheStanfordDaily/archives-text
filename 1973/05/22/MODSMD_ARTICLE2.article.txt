# 'Daley Machine' Figures Convicted
## Prosecutors Attack Chicago Corruption 
### JIM WASCHER News Analysis 
In recent months, county and federal prosecutors
have obtained indictments and convictions of
leading figures in the already-notorious political
organization of Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley.
Federal juries have convicted both Otto Kerner, a
federal appellate judge, and Edward J. Barrett,
long-time Cook County (111.) Clerk, on bribery,
income tax evasion, mail fraud and other charges.
Both have been sentenced to prison terms.
On May 4, the Cook County grand jury indicted
City Council members Thomas E. Keane and Edwin
P. Fifielski for conflict of interest, official
misconduct and conspiracy. The grand jury accused
the two of voting to deposit city funds, with no
interest paid, at a bank in which both held shares.
Keane is chairman of the City Council's finance
committee and has served as Daley's floor leader in
the Council for 15 years.
Some observers speculate that the prosecution of
Daley's associates is politically motivated.
Columnist Jack Anderson charged in March that
"President Nixon personally ordered the federal
crackdown on corruption in Chicago as an act of
political vengeance."
Stolen Votes
In 1960, Illinois Republicans had brought Nixon
enough evidence to convince the just-defeated
presidential candidate that Daley had stolen the
state's crucial electoral votes for John F. Kennedy.
Although Nixon did not press these charges at
the time, Anderson stated that "when he finally
reached the White House eight years later, he let the

Justice Department know that he wanted to clean
up Chicago."
According to Anderson, "a high-powered strike
force and a squad of Washington-based tax agents
were dispatched to Chicago to put the Daley
machine under a federal microscope."
Indeed, soon after James R. Thompson became
U.S. District Attorney for the Chicago area late in
1971, the Justice Department increased the funding
for his office, allowing Thompson to boost his staff
of lawyers from 23 to 72.
Thompson set up a special division to investigate
government corruption and, according to Time
magazine, vowed to then-U.S. Atty. Gen. Richard
G. Kleindienst: "I'm going to kick ass until I get rid
of the crooks."
In a phone interview last Friday, Thompson said
that a federal investigation of Keane was underway
and added that "around a dozen" other City
Council members "are under investigation for
allegations of payoffs for zoning variances" from
which they profited. The Council's only two
Republican members have already been indicted for
this sort of misconduct.
'Silly, False'
Thompson told the Daily that Anderson's
column tying President Nixon. to the Chicago
indictments was "not only silly, but false." For
example, he said the investigation of Kerner, a
former two-term Governor of Illinois "had its
beginnings in 1968, when Lyndon Johnson was still
President."
According to the federal prosecutor, "there's no
reason at all for the President to wait 12 years to

order two criminal prosecutions [Kerner's and
Barrett's] as an act of political reprisal for
something that happened in 1960. That's just
ludicrous and insane. If he wanted to revenge
himself for the loss in '60, I'm sure he would have
done it much earlier and much more directly."
Thompson said he persuaded the Justice
Department to increase funding for his office by
pointing out that his "district was traditionally
understaffed. We had one of the smallest staffs for
the largest district in the nation."
Political pundits have also speculated that
Thompson's zeal may be motivated by personal
political ambition. Chicago Sun-Times Political
Editor Jerome Watson noted in February that
"Thompson could be unstoppable [for the 1975
Republican mayoral nomination in Chicago] if he
continues to win spectacular convictions in U.S.
District Court."
One month later, Watson said "it either is, or
soon may be, inconceivable to imagine him being
denied the Republican nomination for mayor in
1975, should he decide to seek it." If nominated,
Thompson would probably meet Daley in the
general election.
However, Thompson told the Daily Friday that
he had "rebuffed" those Republican leaders who
had approached him about seeking office.
Thompson said: "Not only don't I have any
political ambitions at the moment, I think it would
be wrong to entertain them because it would impair
my function as United States Attorney."
According to Thompson, "I run a non-political
office here and I'm not interested in politics."

reached the White House eight years later, he let the

Justice Department know that he wanted to clean
up Chicago."
According to Anderson, "a high-powered strike
force and a squad of Washington-based tax agents
were dispatched to Chicago to put the Daley
machine under a federal microscope."
Indeed, soon after James R. Thompson became
U.S. District Attorney for the Chicago area late in
1971, the Justice Department increased the funding
for his office, allowing Thompson to boost his staff
of lawyers from 23 to 72.
Thompson set up a special division to investigate
government corruption and, according to Time
magazine, vowed to then-U.S. Atty. Gen. Richard
G. Kleindienst: "I'm going to kick ass until I get rid
of the crooks."
In a phone interview last Friday, Thompson said
that a federal investigation of Keane was underway
and added that "around a dozen" other City
Council members "are under investigation for
allegations of payoffs for zoning variances" from
which they profited. The Council's only two
Republican members have already been indicted for
this sort of misconduct.
'Silly, False'
Thompson told the Daily that Anderson's
column tying President Nixon. to the Chicago
indictments was "not only silly, but false." For
example, he said the investigation of Kerner, a
former two-term Governor of Illinois "had its
beginnings in 1968, when Lyndon Johnson was still
President."
According to the federal prosecutor, "there's no
reason at all for the President to wait 12 years to

order two criminal prosecutions [Kerner's and
Barrett's] as an act of political reprisal for
something that happened in 1960. That's just
ludicrous and insane. If he wanted to revenge
himself for the loss in '60, I'm sure he would have
done it much earlier and much more directly."
Thompson said he persuaded the Justice
Department to increase funding for his office by
pointing out that his "district was traditionally
understaffed. We had one of the smallest staffs for
the largest district in the nation."
Political pundits have also speculated that
Thompson's zeal may be motivated by personal
political ambition. Chicago Sun-Times Political
Editor Jerome Watson noted in February that
"Thompson could be unstoppable [for the 1975
Republican mayoral nomination in Chicago] if he
continues to win spectacular convictions in U.S.
District Court."
One month later, Watson said "it either is, or
soon may be, inconceivable to imagine him being
denied the Republican nomination for mayor in
1975, should he decide to seek it." If nominated,
Thompson would probably meet Daley in the
general election.
However, Thompson told the Daily Friday that
he had "rebuffed" those Republican leaders who
had approached him about seeking office.
Thompson said: "Not only don't I have any
political ambitions at the moment, I think it would
be wrong to entertain them because it would impair
my function as United States Attorney."
According to Thompson, "I run a non-political
office here and I'm not interested in politics."
In recent months, county and federal prosecutors
have obtained indictments and convictions of
leading figures in the already-notorious political
organization of Chicago Mayor Richard J. Daley.
Federal juries have convicted both Otto Kerner, a
federal appellate judge, and Edward J. Barrett,
long-time Cook County (111.) Clerk, on bribery,
income tax evasion, mail fraud and other charges.
Both have been sentenced to prison terms.
On May 4, the Cook County grand jury indicted
City Council members Thomas E. Keane and Edwin
P. Fifielski for conflict of interest, official
misconduct and conspiracy. The grand jury accused
the two of voting to deposit city funds, with no
interest paid, at a bank in which both held shares.
Keane is chairman of the City Council's finance
committee and has served as Daley's floor leader in
the Council for 15 years.
Some observers speculate that the prosecution of
Daley's associates is politically motivated.
Columnist Jack Anderson charged in March that
"President Nixon personally ordered the federal
crackdown on corruption in Chicago as an act of
political vengeance."
Stolen Votes
In 1960, Illinois Republicans had brought Nixon
enough evidence to convince the just-defeated
presidential candidate that Daley had stolen the
state's crucial electoral votes for John F. Kennedy.
Although Nixon did not press these charges at
the time, Anderson stated that "when he finally
