Caulfield Testifies Today
WASHINGTON — The special Senate committee
investigating the Watergate scandal prepared to
resume its televised hearings today with the witness
again Watergate conspirator James W. McCord Jr.
John C. Caulfield, who McCord says relayed offers
of executive clemency to buy his silence, was to
follow.
In Watergate-related developments yesterday:
— Former Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell and
former Commerce Secretary Maurice H. Stans, along
with attorney Harry L. Sears, pleaded not guilty in a
New York court to charges related to a secret
$200,000 contribution to Nixon's 1972 re-election
campaign. The charges involve a federal
investigation of financier Robert L. Vesco.
— Elliot L. Richardson's prospects for
confirmation as attorney general brightened after he
told the Senate Judiciary Committee that Archibald
Cox will have full, independent authority as special
Watergate prosecutor.
Cox assured the senators he will follow the
Watergate trail "wherever that trail may lead" —
even to Nixon's office. He said his power to act
independently is as much "as anyone could ask."
— Vice President Spiro T. Agnew told a
Republican club to guard against "being stampeded
into protesting entirely too much" about Watergate.
"Republicans must not allow the content of their
speeches, statements and even private conversations
to be controlled by those who are literally obsessed
with one subject," the vice president said.
— The White House said it will disclose Friday
details of President Nixon's land transactions in
California and Florida.
The issue was raised in a story in the Santa Ana,
Calif., Register that said Senate investigators were
looking into the possibility that 1968 campaign
funds may have been used to finance Nixon's San
Clemente, Calif., estate. The White House and the
Senate Watergate committee vehemently denied the
report.
A story in the Washington Star-News said
Nixon campaign advisers still were distributing
"hush money" to the Watergate conspirators as
recently as April when the Watergate coverup story
began to emerge.
School Consolidation Blocked
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court yesterday
blocked consolidation of predominantly black
Richmond, Va., schools with those in white
suburbs, but left unsettled the fate of similar plans
elsewhere.
The high court split evenly on the issue, 4-4, thus
setting no precedent for other courts to follow.
Tie votes affirm the lower court decision under
appeal, in this case one by the U.S. Circuit Court in
Richmond.
No opinions are issued in tie votes, nor is the
breakdown of the vote announced. The tie was
made possible because Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., a
former member of both the Richmond and Virginia
State School Boards, took no part in the case.
The split vote placed Powell, perhaps the least
predictable of President Nixon's four conservative

appointees to the court, at the center of the
controversy over the course of school desegregation
in the 19705.
Similar metropolitan desegregation suits are
pending in Atlanta, Boston, Louisville, Detroit,
Dallas and other cities.
Memphis Gunman Kills Five
MEMPHIS, Tenn. — A gunman spraying a ghetto
street with rifle fire killed four passersby and a
policeman, wounded a fifth person and then was
slain by police bullets yesterday afternoon, officials
said.
Police Chief Bill Price said the gunman, armed
with a .30.30-lever action rifle, opened up in front
of a liquor store in south Memphis, killing three
men and a woman, whose bodies were found in
front of the store and in the yard of a small house
across the street.
"The four apparently were innocent victims,"
Price said. He said police had not established the
reason for the outbreak of gunfire.
A federal probation man working in the area
responded to the sound of gunfire, officers said, and
was seriously wounded. He was not immediately
identified.
Price said the dead policeman, identified as
Patrolman David Clark, 31, was among officers who
arrived in response to first reports. The chief said
Clark, an eight-year police veteran, thought the
gunman was hiding in a residence nearby and, as he
crept around the house, died when the man stepped
from behind a garage and shot him in the back.
Viet Talks Make Progress
PARIS — American and North Vietnamese
negotiators have made "some progress" in their
talks on ways to implement the shaky Vietnam
peace agreement, Henry A. Kissinger said yesterday.
President Nixon's national security adviser made
the brief comment to newsmen after meeting five
hours with Le Due Tho, Hanoi's top Vietnam
negotiator. It was the fourth session in their current
series of meetings, which began last Thursday.
Kissinger spoke after bidding Tho a cordial
goodby. He declined to elaborate on the talks, but
the two delegations said Kissinger would meet with
Tho again today.
The second-ranking delegates, Deputy Asst.
Secretary of State William Sullivan and the North
Vietnamese deputy foreign minister, Nguyen Co
Thach, were to meet last night to discuss technical
details, a spokesman said.
Apart from Kissinger's brief remark, both sides
maintained their news blackout. There was no
indication whether Kissinger and Tho were
preparing an interpretive annex to the Jan. 27
cease-fire pact in an effort to stop the violations
each side has charged against the other.
Brezhnev Lauds Brandt Talks
BONN, Germany y Soviet leader Leonid I.
Brezhnev, proclaiming that durable peace is closer
than ever before, said last night he wants to lead
Russia out of isolation into increasing cooperation
with the West.

Brezhnev also revealed in a televised address after
talks with Chancellor Willy Brandt of West Germany
that domestic opposition had to be overcome before
he could begin a new era of friendlier relations with
his former German enemies.
"I must say very openly that it was not so easy
for the Soviet people as well as its leadership to
open up this new page in our relations," Brezhnev
said. "For millions of Soviet citizens the memories
of the past war, the huge sacrifices and the horrible
destruction wrought by Hitler's aggression are still
too alive.
"We have been able to overcome the past in
relations to your country because we do not want a
return to this past," Brezhnev said.
Prior to the Soviet leader's trip to Bonn, two
members of the ruling Soviet Communist party
Politburo were removed for apparently opposing
Brezhnev's plans to launch an accommodation with
the West.
Skylab On "Thermal Tightrope 1
CAPE KENNEDY, Fla. — Battling time, the Skylab
1 astronauts yesterday practiced the tedious
maneuvers they must perform perfectly to save
America's space station.
Mission Control walked "a thermal tightrope"
keeping the overheated orbiting lab in shape for
salvage.
Astronauts Charles Conrad Jr., Dr. Joseph P.
Kerwin and Paul J. Weitz worked in simulators at
the Johnson Space Center near Houston, rehearsing
the techniques for fixing a broken solar panel on
Skylab and for installing an umbrella-like sun
bonnet to cool off the lab.
The baking effect of the sun is causing
temperatures to hover at 115 degrees in the crew
and workshop part of Skylab. Another section of
the 118-foot-long craft is facing away from the sun
and temperatures there are approaching 34 degrees.
Engineers worried that water in a plumbing system
may freeze, causing pipes to burst.
Saccharin Linked To Cancer
WASHINGTON — A new federal report yesterday
showed "presumptive evidence" that saccharin in
high doses caused cancerous bladder tumors in rats.
The Food and Drug Administration said it will
not move against saccharin, the only artificial
sweetener remaining on the market since cyclamate
was banned, until it receives a recommendation
from the National Academy of Sciences.
Virgil O. Wodicka, director of FDA's Bureau of
Foods, said the pathology report on the agency's
two-year rat-feeding studies shows "presumptive
evidence" that saccharin caused cancerous bladder
tumors in three of 48 rats fed saccharin as 7.5
percent of their total diet.
