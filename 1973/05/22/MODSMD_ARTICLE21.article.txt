# Europe Travel Guide Goes On Sale Today
## 
### 
Festoon, a new Europe travel guide
published especially for students, will
go on sale today at the Stanford
Bookstore as well as the ASSU Travel
Service, which prepared the guide.
The guide will focus on "festivals
and adventure" occurring primarily in
Western Europe, according to
Managing Editor Mary Corff. In
addition to covering specific events,
the 80-page publication will contain a
lengthy calendar of European festivals
scheduled for this summer.
Festoon differs in purpose from
other Europe travel guides, according
to ASSU Travel Manager Russ
MacAusland, in that the others "are
concerned primarily with the ins and
outs of travelling abroad,
recommending hotels and restaurants
and pointing out a few sights.
"ASSU Travel Service felt that
students were interested in more than
just passive attractions such as
museums and historical points of
interest. The ASSU guide therefore
will be concerned entirely with giving
information about various events in

Europe and things to do," MacAusland
said.
Among the subjects covered in
Festoon are the Running of the Bulls
in Pamplona, the Cannes Film Festival,
the Monte Carlo Grand Prix, the
Shakespeare Festival, and several rock
and jazz festivals. Unusual activities
such as working on a farm in Norway,
participating in a dig in Israel,"living
with monks in Greece, and taking a
hot-air balloon trip in Switzerland will
also be explored.
Corff said that the guide will be
updated annually, noting that next
February's edition "may be twice as
big."
