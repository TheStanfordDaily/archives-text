# Private Food Services Company To Direct Tresidder Operation
## 
### JANET SANDERS 
University officials signed a
contract yesterday with Tout de Suite,
Inc. (TDS), a Bay Area corporation, to
manage all Tresidder Memorial Union
food services operations. TDS named
John Shaw as food services manager.
Beginning June 18, Tresidder's 55
employees will cease working for the
University and "will instead have the
opportunity of continuing work in the
Tresidder operations as employees of
TDS," Gordon Starr, Tresidder general
manager, said.
"The company will provide
essentially the same benefits that the
University has provided," said Skip
Mclntyre, president of TDS. He
explained that there will be no change
in wages and that the company will

offer identical employee benefits in
health care, life insurance, and medical
insurance as the University.
According to Starr, employees will
also maintain their privileges in the
credit unions if they have a balance of
$50 in their savings accounts with the
unions. Presently, workers only need a
$5 balance.
However, Tresidder employees will
lose their eligibility for Stanford's
Tuition Reimbursement Plan when
they begin work for TDS. Starr noted
that no present worker is taking
advantage of the program.
Guckenheimer Subsidiary
TDS is a subsidiary of
Guckenheimer Enterprises, a Northern
California corporation operating 25
Bay Area food facilities. Its president,
Dr. Stewart Ritchie 111, is a Stanford
Medical School graduate who started
in the food business by selling
sandwiches in the school's courtyard.
Both he and Starr were confident
that TDS could pull the troubled
Union out of its financial crisis.
Tresidder's projected deficit for this
year is $240,000, substantially higher
than the previously projected deficit
of $150,000.
Starr pointed out several advantages
of hiring a company instead of an
independent food manager. "This past
year, we have proved that we cannot
handle our problems by hiring our
own food manager," he said.
Tresidder's last manager, Joe Xavier,
quit after four days.
Back-Up Support
"TDS will provide the back-up
support which only an experienced
management company could provide,"
said Starr. By giving a professional
organization full managerial authority
in food services, the Union's major
money-loser, Starr anticipated that the
deficit next year will be cut down to
under $100,000.

New food manager John Shaw
begins work today, replacing
temporary food manager Jerry
Philpot. Shaw was previously district
supervisor for a commercial restaurant
chain.
"For the next 30 days, I am going
to absorb all the facts and figures,"
Shaw said. No changes in the food
services will be made until June 18
when the contract goes into effect.
More Student Employment?
Ritchie assured that the changes
implemented will not call for
reductions in student employment.
"In fact, we hope to employ more
students when we begin to

substantially increase the Union's
sales." Last month, Starr eliminated
about 250 hours per week in student
labor in order to cut costs.
Starr would not reveal the duration
and the financial terms of the
University's contract with TDS, but he
said that the conditions were
favorable.
"We chose TDS because it has a
successful record in the food service
industry and are responsible employers
who share the employee-oriented
management attitudes that we have
been working to implement this past
year," Starr said.
