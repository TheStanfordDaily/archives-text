# Heroin Abuse Closes Drug Addiction Center
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
The controversial Palo Alto
Residents Treatment Center for
narcotics addicts has been closed for
more thai a week, it was revealed
yesterday.
Members of the center staff told
the City C< anoil last night that the
center, whirh had been in operation
only four weeics, was closed May 10
when some of its residents were found
to be u iing heroin.
The center, a drug-free environment
for the rehabilitation of addicts, is
located at 851 University Avenue.
Staff member Sam Cannistraci told
the Council last night that the center's
staff planned to reopen the program
on June 11, after completly
"restructuring" the center's treatment
programs.
He said that a "halfway house" of
this type is very difficult to operate,

and asserted that other such houses
had suffered major crises for their first
several years of operation.
Cannistraci said that "I feel good
about our prospects after we reopen."
Hard Work
Councilman John Beahrs repeated
his suggestion, made last fall when the
center was proposed, that addicts be
treated at a rural facility where they
would do hard physical labor "rather
than sit around and moan about their
problem."
Cannistraci, city Drug Abuse Board
Chairwoman Carla Vespe, and drop-in
center staff member Nancy Buell
appeared before the Council to answer
questions at Mayor Kirke Comstock's
request.
Comstock and several other Council
members questioned the three about
events leading up to the closing of the
residential center, but expressed
confidence that the center would be
able to reopen and continue
operations.
Dumbarton Bridge
In other action, the Council voted
to once again protest the proposed
construction of a new Dumbarton
Bridge connecting the Palo Alto-Menlo
Park area with the East Bay.
State authorities have proposed a
four-lane bridge to replace the existing
two-lane bridge, and the Council
expressed fears that traffic from the
new structure would overburden Palo
Alto residential streets.
Last night, the Council
unanimously urged the Metropolitan
Transportation Commission, a regional
agency, to remove the bridge from the
top-priority section of its forthcoming
Regional Transportation Plan.
Barron Park
Earlier, the Council unanimously
requested that the city staff study the
possibility of annexing the
unincorporated Barron Park residential
area to the city.
During discussion of the proposed
annexation, Beahrs expressed
apprehension that the proposal might
also include the Stanford campus.
"I'm not friendly to a group of
well-intentioned Stanford students
voting for a bond issue for this town,
and then leaving after two years
without paying for it," Beahrs stated.
City Manager George Sipel assured
him that the only Stanford lands in
Barron Park were three uninhabited,
undeveloped industrial acres, and that
the annexation o f the campus was not
contemplated.
