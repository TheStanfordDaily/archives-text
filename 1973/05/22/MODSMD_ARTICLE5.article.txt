# Girl Scouts Teaches Independence

### JANET SANDERS 
Girl Scouts, a thriving American
institution for 61 years, "was the
original women's lib organization,"
according to Stanford employee
Brenda Christensen, a troop leader in
Palo Alto.
"Girl Scouts has been ahead of the
times," said Doris Purrington, assistant
to the Executive Director of the Santa
Clara County Girl Scout Council.
The official goal of the program
stated in the Girl Scout National
Constitution is "to inspire girls to the
higher ideals of character, conduct,
patriotism and service, that they may
become happy and resourceful
citizens." According to Purrington,
independence and responsibility are
key points of the program.
In the Stanford community, there
are seven Girl Scout troops, drawing
membership from Escondido and
Lucille Nixon elementary schools.
Approximately 20 girls, mostly
children of graduate students and
faculty, make up each group.
Five Stanford students, all
freshmen, have taken on the ambitious

project of providing volunteer
leadership for two Girl Scout troops
from Escondido School. Blowdwen
Tarter, Kim Weller, and Jackie Nelson
head a group of 14 Brownies, Girl
Scouts seven and eight years old.
Connie Lara and Pam Richie are in
charge of 16 Brownies.
Many Activities
For the weekly meetings, the
student leaders have planned activities
which included everything from
making paper flowers to picnicking at
Lake Lagunita. On April 28, Tarter's
group picked up 19 bags of trash
around Branner Hall for "Keep
America Beautiful" day.
The leaders estimated that they
spend four to five hours per week
working for Girl Scouts. Tarter, a
former Girl Scout of 10 years,
explained that the girls take more
responsibility in planning their own
activities as they grow older.
"The Girl Scouts aim at
independence," said Tarter. The girls
earn "proficiency badges," small
patches which symbolize completed
work in some field, once they advance

to Junior Girl Scouts, the level after
Brownies.
Program Develops Leadership
Christensen, leader of a junior high
school group of Cadette Girl Scouts,
stressed that her girls plan what they
want to do. "The program helps to
develop responsible young women
with experience in decision-making
and leadership," she said.
Christensen's husband, a graduate
student in geology, is a co-leader of
the troop.
Wednesday, Christensen's troop
attended a lecture on self-defense for
women at a local junior high school.
Besides making use of community
resources, the Girl Scout program also
teaches outdoor skills in camping,
guidelines in personal health and
safety, and domestic skills.
"The scouting experience largely
depends on what the girls themselves
make of it," said Purrington.
Diversity Emphasized
Because of the girls' role in
planning, diversity in the troop is very
important. "Girl Scouts have made
