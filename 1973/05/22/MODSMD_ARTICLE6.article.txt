## On Cambodia 
### 
It is startling to consider that since the Vietnam cease-fire
was signed on Jan. 27, the United States has dropped more
than 100,000 tons of bombs on Cambodia.
That is more than was dropped on that country in all of
1970, the year of the invasion — and the bombardment
shows no sign of abating.
The toll, as always, has been human as well as financial.
The bombing cost no less than $159.5 million between Jan.
27 and April 30. Much more important, some of it has been
in heavily populated areas. American correspondents have
reported scenes reminiscent of the worst bombing of
Vietnam: "devastation" of parts of villages, civilians
wounded by anti-personnel bombs — and uncertain effects
on the insurgents the bombs are supposed to discourage.
We have often criticized the United States'
counterinsurgent role in southeast Asia. The particular case
of Cambodia is, if anything, even more questionable.
The Nixon Administration has argued that the raids are
justified by the alleged failure of North Vietnam to
withdraw its troops from Cambodia. But embassy officials in
Phnom Penh contradict the Administration's contention
that Vietnamese Communist troops are serving in combat
roles in Cambodia; and last week CIA analyst Samuel A.
Adams, accusing the American intelligence community of
"dishonesty," estimated that there are no more than 2,000
Vietnamese Communist troops in Cambodia - and said that
those are serving only as advisers.
The Administration admits that one purpose of the
bombing is to support the unpopular government of Marshal
Lon Nol. We believe that to be the bombing's primary
purpose — if not its only purpose.
Nearly all accounts hold Lon Nol to be remarkably
corrupt; his regime, which has been ruling under martial law
since March, is anything but democratic. Nearly all accounts
estimate the domestic opposition — which includes
moderate as well as Communist elements — to have the
support of roughly three-quarters of the populace.
The bombing of Cambodia is being conducted without
any authorization or sanction of Congress. The House of
Representatives has refused to allow any transfer of funds
for the continuing action. Last week the Gallup Poll revealed
that the American people oppose the bombing by two to
one.
A B-52 gunner stationed on Guam echoed the concerns
of many last month when he wrote to Senator J. William
Fulbright: "I am concerned about our increasing
involvement in Cambodia and Laos. I fear that we will get
into another situation like the one that led to the ten years
of Vietnam.... I for one, sir, do not wish to die as a
mercenary for a foreign dictator."
Cambodia does, indeed, look suspiciously like the
quagmire that was recognized all too late in Vietnam. We
condemn the bombing and demand that it be stopped; we
call upon Congress to move swiftly and decisively to
prohibit this and similar military adventures. And if the
Administration continues the bombing despite Congressional
prohibition — as Defense Secretary Richardson has said it
will - the current murmurs of impeachment may grow to a
roar. It would not be without good reason.

The toll, as always, has been human as well as financial.
The bombing cost no less than $159.5 million between Jan.
27 and April 30. Much more important, some of it has been
in heavily populated areas. American correspondents have
reported scenes reminiscent of the worst bombing of
Vietnam: "devastation" of parts of villages, civilians
wounded by anti-personnel bombs — and uncertain effects
on the insurgents the bombs are supposed to discourage.
We have often criticized the United States'
counterinsurgent role in southeast Asia. The particular case
of Cambodia is, if anything, even more questionable.
The Nixon Administration has argued that the raids are
justified by the alleged failure of North Vietnam to
withdraw its troops from Cambodia. But embassy officials in
Phnom Penh contradict the Administration's contention
that Vietnamese Communist troops are serving in combat
roles in Cambodia; and last week CIA analyst Samuel A.
Adams, accusing the American intelligence community of
"dishonesty," estimated that there are no more than 2,000
Vietnamese Communist troops in Cambodia - and said that
those are serving only as advisers.
The Administration admits that one purpose of the
bombing is to support the unpopular government of Marshal
Lon Nol. We believe that to be the bombing's primary
purpose — if not its only purpose.
Nearly all accounts hold Lon Nol to be remarkably
corrupt; his regime, which has been ruling under martial law
since March, is anything but democratic. Nearly all accounts
estimate the domestic opposition — which includes
moderate as well as Communist elements — to have the
support of roughly three-quarters of the populace.
The bombing of Cambodia is being conducted without
any authorization or sanction of Congress. The House of
Representatives has refused to allow any transfer of funds
for the continuing action. Last week the Gallup Poll revealed
that the American people oppose the bombing by two to
one.
A B-52 gunner stationed on Guam echoed the concerns
of many last month when he wrote to Senator J. William
Fulbright: "I am concerned about our increasing
involvement in Cambodia and Laos. I fear that we will get
into another situation like the one that led to the ten years
of Vietnam.... I for one, sir, do not wish to die as a
mercenary for a foreign dictator."
Cambodia does, indeed, look suspiciously like the
quagmire that was recognized all too late in Vietnam. We
condemn the bombing and demand that it be stopped; we
call upon Congress to move swiftly and decisively to
prohibit this and similar military adventures. And if the
Administration continues the bombing despite Congressional
prohibition — as Defense Secretary Richardson has said it
will - the current murmurs of impeachment may grow to a
roar. It would not be without good reason.
It is startling to consider that since the Vietnam cease-fire
was signed on Jan. 27, the United States has dropped more
than 100,000 tons of bombs on Cambodia.
That is more than was dropped on that country in all of
1970, the year of the invasion — and the bombardment
shows no sign of abating.
