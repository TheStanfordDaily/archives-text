## A 						Dollies-Phi Delt Link

STANFORD, CALIFORNIA—
Fifteen members of the
all-male Phi Delta Kappa
fraternity, along with three
members of the notorious
Stanford Dancing Dollies, were
convicted of complicity in United
States war crimes today.
The d- ision to convict was
h&pded by a People's
" : bunal alter just forty minutes
01 deliberation.
The Dollies are due to be
sentenced June 12. The Phi Delt
members must face another trial
for the rape-murder of a young
housewife in Chico, California
early last year. The maximum
punishment for complicity in war
crimes is death.
Large Implication
The decision climaxed a
year-long investigation of the Phi
Delts and the Dollies which
eventually implicated a large part
of me Stanford campus. The
investigation was touched off by
the uncovering of a clandestine
plot within the Phi Delt house to
degrade womanhood.
Shortly thereafter, a stunning
expose in the Stanford Daily
revealed the Stanford Dollies to
be involved in a mystical
organization. The Dollies,
self-proclaimed apolitical
liberal-conservatives, were arrested
by the People's Sheriff after their
connection with the Indochina
War became clear.
Originally a five-member
group, the Dollies' numbers were
pared to three after the suicide of
one member and the renunciation
by the other one of her bourgeois
life style. She is now a disciple of
Helen Reddy.
The close relationship between
the Dollies and the Indochina War
was revealed in a letter to the

Daily by Charlene Peterson. Ms.
Peterson acted as prosecutor in
the three-week-long trial.
Jubilant
Ms. Peterson was also
responsible for establishing the
connection between the War and
the Phi Delts. The fraternity
members were shown to be in
close sympathy and collusion with
the ideology and outlook of the
Dollies.
The co-prosecutor in the case,
Ms. Helen Chauncey, was jubilant
after the decision was delivered.
"We knew the People wouldn't let
us down," she said. Ms. Chauncey
is credited with establishing the
link between the Phi Delts and the
Chico tragedy in an article in the
Daily shortly after the Phi Delt
plot was uncovered.
The attorney for the defense,
John Mitchell, appeared downcast
after the defeat. "We never stood
much of a chance," said Mitchell,

"especially since I had to be out
of town for so much of the trial."
When asked if he planned to
appeal the decision, Mitchell said,
"Why bother?"
Set Precedents
The Phi Delt-Dolly trial is
expected to set several legal
precedents. Previously, complicity
in war crimes had been defined as
actual physical involvement with
the commission of the criminal
act.
In this case, however, Judge
Ramsey Clark ruled that mental
sympathy with the values,
ideologies, and beliefs, or lack of
them, of the participants in the
crime was a basis for prosecution
and constituted a breach of
international law.
"It is obvious," said Judge
Clark, "that a man with a
split-level ranch house in West
Covina, a Ford Maverick with a
Nixon bumper sticker on it, a

color TV, and a pair of brass
flamingoes on his front lawn is no
better, morally, than Lieutenant
William Calley."
"If he is no better morally,
then he certainly is no better
legally."
The conviction of the Phi Delts
and the Dollies is expected to
bring an end to fraternities,
football and other sports which
emphasize individual
achievement drinking hard
liquor, suggestive clothing or
dances, and the Stanford Band at
the University.
Instead, according to a resident
of Cotton Mather House on the
campus, students will spend their
time "reordering our priorities
and making sure everyone's
engaged in some sort of
productive activity. After all, idle
hands are the Devil's plaything."

STANFORD, CALIFORNIA—
Fifteen members of the
all-male Phi Delta Kappa
fraternity, along with three
members of the notorious
Stanford Dancing Dollies, were
convicted of complicity in United
States war crimes today.
The d- ision to convict was
h&pded by a People's
" : bunal alter just forty minutes
01 deliberation.
The Dollies are due to be
sentenced June 12. The Phi Delt
members must face another trial
for the rape-murder of a young
housewife in Chico, California
early last year. The maximum
punishment for complicity in war
crimes is death.
Large Implication
The decision climaxed a
year-long investigation of the Phi
Delts and the Dollies which
eventually implicated a large part
of me Stanford campus. The
investigation was touched off by
the uncovering of a clandestine
plot within the Phi Delt house to
degrade womanhood.
Shortly thereafter, a stunning
expose in the Stanford Daily
revealed the Stanford Dollies to
be involved in a mystical
organization. The Dollies,
self-proclaimed apolitical
liberal-conservatives, were arrested
by the People's Sheriff after their
connection with the Indochina
War became clear.
Originally a five-member
group, the Dollies' numbers were
pared to three after the suicide of
one member and the renunciation
by the other one of her bourgeois
life style. She is now a disciple of
Helen Reddy.
The close relationship between
the Dollies and the Indochina War
was revealed in a letter to the

Daily by Charlene Peterson. Ms.
Peterson acted as prosecutor in
the three-week-long trial.
Jubilant
Ms. Peterson was also
responsible for establishing the
connection between the War and
the Phi Delts. The fraternity
members were shown to be in
close sympathy and collusion with
the ideology and outlook of the
Dollies.
The co-prosecutor in the case,
Ms. Helen Chauncey, was jubilant
after the decision was delivered.
"We knew the People wouldn't let
us down," she said. Ms. Chauncey
is credited with establishing the
link between the Phi Delts and the
Chico tragedy in an article in the
Daily shortly after the Phi Delt
plot was uncovered.
The attorney for the defense,
John Mitchell, appeared downcast
after the defeat. "We never stood
much of a chance," said Mitchell,

"especially since I had to be out
of town for so much of the trial."
When asked if he planned to
appeal the decision, Mitchell said,
"Why bother?"
Set Precedents
The Phi Delt-Dolly trial is
expected to set several legal
precedents. Previously, complicity
in war crimes had been defined as
actual physical involvement with
the commission of the criminal
act.
In this case, however, Judge
Ramsey Clark ruled that mental
sympathy with the values,
ideologies, and beliefs, or lack of
them, of the participants in the
crime was a basis for prosecution
and constituted a breach of
international law.
"It is obvious," said Judge
Clark, "that a man with a
split-level ranch house in West
Covina, a Ford Maverick with a
Nixon bumper sticker on it, a

color TV, and a pair of brass
flamingoes on his front lawn is no
better, morally, than Lieutenant
William Calley."
