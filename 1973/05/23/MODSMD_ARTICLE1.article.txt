# Says Dean Ordered Move
## Nixon Aide Offered Clemency To McCord 
### 
From The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - Former White
House aide John C. Caulfield swore
yesterday he relayed offers of
executive clemency to Watergate
burglar James W. McCord Jr., but
doesn't know whether President Nixon
"personally had endorsed this offer."
Caulfield said he was assigned to
contact McCord by John W. Dean 111,
who was the White House counsel at
the time. He said he asked Dean: " 'Do
you want me to tell him it [the
clemency offer] comes from the
President?'
"He said words to the effect, 'No,
don't do that, say that it comes from
way up at the top' ..
McCord, who finished two days of
questioning yesterday, had said that
when he received the offers from
Caulfield in January, he assumed they
came from the President — the only

person who can grant executive
clemency.
No Knowledge
Caulfield said "I specifically never
spoke to the President of the United
States and have no knowledge of my
own as to whether he personally had
endorsed this offer or indeed whether
anyone had ever discussed it with
him."
McCord said he had been told by
Caulfield that the President knew of
the clemency offer, that the President
would be told McCord's response and
that McCord could expect a personal
telephone call from Nixon after the
meeting.
Caulfield's statement differed from
McCord's in two major respects.
Executive Clemency
McCord had testified Caulfield told
him the President was aware of the
executive clemency offer and would

receive a report about it.
Caulfield said he had no knowledge
that the President knew the offer was
being made.
McCord also had said he placed
calls to two embassies in an effort to
have the government disclose that his
conversations were overheard on
wiretaps. He identified the embassies
as those of Chile and Israel. He said he
knew such evidence would not result
in having his case dismissed, but would
test the truthfulness of the
government which was saying there
were no such taps.
Embarrassment
But Caulfield testified McCord told
him the scheme was a way to save the
White House embarrassment over
Watergate.
As the committee recessed for a
vote on the Senate floor, McCord's
attorney, Bernard Fensterwald, said
his cleint would not volunteer answers
to questions on the differences.
Caulfield said "I viewed my role
simply as one of a messenger," and
added he actively resisted the role.
'Ruthless Attempt'
McCord had said earlier he was so
angered by "a ruthless attempt" by
the White House to blame the CIA for
the Watergate burglary that he sent a

letter promising:
"Every tree in the forest will fall. It
will be a scorched desert."
Caulfield acknowledged receiving
the letter.
Message From Dean
He said he took it to Dean at the
White House and soon after received a
message from Dean to McCord.
Caulfield said the message consisted
of three things:
"A year is a long time; your wife
and family will be taken care of; you
will be rehabilitated with employment
when this is all over."
Same Offers
McCord had testified about the
same offers in his first day before the
special Senate committee last week.
"I immediately realized I was being
asked to do a very dangerous thing,"
said Caulfield, a former New York
City policeman who won a number of
honors for his work.
"I said to Mr. Dean that I did not
think it was wise to send me on such a
mission since Mr. McCord knew, as
many others did, that I had worked
closely with Mr. Dean and Mr.
Ehrlichman at the White House and
therefore it might be quickly guessed
that any messages I was conveying
were probably from one of the two."

From The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - Former White
House aide John C. Caulfield swore
yesterday he relayed offers of
executive clemency to Watergate
burglar James W. McCord Jr., but
doesn't know whether President Nixon
"personally had endorsed this offer."
Caulfield said he was assigned to
contact McCord by John W. Dean 111,
who was the White House counsel at
the time. He said he asked Dean: " 'Do
you want me to tell him it [the
clemency offer] comes from the
President?'
"He said words to the effect, 'No,
don't do that, say that it comes from
way up at the top' ..
McCord, who finished two days of
questioning yesterday, had said that
when he received the offers from
Caulfield in January, he assumed they
came from the President — the only

person who can grant executive
clemency.
No Knowledge
Caulfield said "I specifically never
spoke to the President of the United
States and have no knowledge of my
own as to whether he personally had
endorsed this offer or indeed whether
anyone had ever discussed it with
him."
McCord said he had been told by
Caulfield that the President knew of
the clemency offer, that the President
would be told McCord's response and
that McCord could expect a personal
telephone call from Nixon after the
meeting.
Caulfield's statement differed from
McCord's in two major respects.
Executive Clemency
McCord had testified Caulfield told
him the President was aware of the
executive clemency offer and would

receive a report about it.
Caulfield said he had no knowledge
that the President knew the offer was
being made.
McCord also had said he placed
calls to two embassies in an effort to
have the government disclose that his
conversations were overheard on
wiretaps. He identified the embassies
as those of Chile and Israel. He said he
knew such evidence would not result
in having his case dismissed, but would
test the truthfulness of the
government which was saying there
were no such taps.
Embarrassment
But Caulfield testified McCord told
him the scheme was a way to save the
White House embarrassment over
Watergate.
As the committee recessed for a
vote on the Senate floor, McCord's
attorney, Bernard Fensterwald, said
his cleint would not volunteer answers
to questions on the differences.
Caulfield said "I viewed my role
simply as one of a messenger," and
added he actively resisted the role.
'Ruthless Attempt'
McCord had said earlier he was so
angered by "a ruthless attempt" by
the White House to blame the CIA for
the Watergate burglary that he sent a

letter promising:
"Every tree in the forest will fall. It
will be a scorched desert."
Caulfield acknowledged receiving
the letter.
Message From Dean
He said he took it to Dean at the
White House and soon after received a
message from Dean to McCord.
Caulfield said the message consisted
of three things:
"A year is a long time; your wife
and family will be taken care of; you
will be rehabilitated with employment
when this is all over."
Same Offers
McCord had testified about the
same offers in his first day before the
special Senate committee last week.
"I immediately realized I was being
asked to do a very dangerous thing,"
said Caulfield, a former New York
City policeman who won a number of
honors for his work.
"I said to Mr. Dean that I did not
think it was wise to send me on such a
