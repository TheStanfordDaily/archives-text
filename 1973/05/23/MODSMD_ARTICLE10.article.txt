# USU, Stanford
## Local Union Issue 
### 
On 17 May the Daily carried an
advertisement entitled "Talking
union ..." which claimed to
present unbiased information
about unions and collective
bargaining. The article was paid
for by the University, presumably
using monies provided at least in
part through the tuition paid by
the student body. As students
interested in the welfare of
Stanford workers, we were
outraged by the University's
financing of what was in fact
anti-union election propaganda.
While purporting to "promote an
understanding of the meaning of
the election and of the possible
issues involved in the outcome,"
the article distorts both the legal
and practical consequences of
collective bargaining.
For example, a theme running
throughout the article was the
spectre of a union impotent in
negotiations with the employer
but incessantly meddlesome in the
rights of individual workers. On
both counts, the article is an
unfair representation of the
choice facing workers on June 6.
At the very beginning of its
article the Office of Employee
Relations solemnly announces
that a USE victory would
guarantee only "the right to
bargain with the University" and
that any change in wages and
working conditions would have to
be agreed to by the University. Of
course USE has never claimed that
it could gain unilateral control
over working conditions. It
obviously cannot do so. What the
article fails to mention is that
today, without a union, wages and
working conditions are
unilaterally set by the employer.
Omission
The University version of
"collective representation" also
omits the fact that if Stanford
workers select USE as their
representative, federal law
imposes on the University an
affirmative duty to bargain with
the union in good faith. The
University is presently under no

ASSU Presidents 9 Law Group

such obligation. If USE wins the
election, arbitrary refusals to
negotiate on wages and working
conditions would subject the
University to legal sanctions.
The article goes on to suggest
that the presence of USE at
Stanford will somehow prevent
workers from getting a whole
array of benefits now available to
them for the asking. The
University warns that individual
dealings between workers and the
University will no longer be
possible if a union enters the
scene. Nowhere does the article
discuss the unequal bargaining
positions of a typical individual
worker versus the University.
Nowhere does it discuss
difficulties faced by workers in
the past in attempts to deal with
their not always benevolent
employer. The University likewise
fails to mention the possibility
that to a large extent, those
improvements in working
conditions which have taken place
in the last few years have been in
response to the mere threat of
workers forming a union.
Straw Man
Rather than discuss the merits
of the concrete proposals put
forward by USE, the Office of
Employee Relations chose to ask
itself whether a union can legally
refuse to file a grievance and
whether a union can legally
negotiate larger wage increases for
some workers than for others.
What a union can or cannot
"legally" do in the abstract is
nothing but a straw man.
The important question is not
what some hypothetical union
might be able to do without
violating the law. The relevant
question is what in fact USE
proposes to do and whether these
plans reflect the desires of
Stanford workers. The article put
out by the University seeks only
to divert attention from the real
issues involved.

Relations solemnly announces
that a USE victory would
guarantee only "the right to
bargain with the University" and
that any change in wages and
working conditions would have to
be agreed to by the University. Of
course USE has never claimed that
it could gain unilateral control
over working conditions. It
obviously cannot do so. What the
article fails to mention is that
today, without a union, wages and
working conditions are
unilaterally set by the employer.
Omission
The University version of
"collective representation" also
omits the fact that if Stanford
workers select USE as their
representative, federal law
imposes on the University an
affirmative duty to bargain with
the union in good faith. The
University is presently under no

ASSU Presidents 9 Law Group

such obligation. If USE wins the
election, arbitrary refusals to
negotiate on wages and working
conditions would subject the
University to legal sanctions.
The article goes on to suggest
that the presence of USE at
Stanford will somehow prevent
workers from getting a whole
array of benefits now available to
them for the asking. The
University warns that individual
dealings between workers and the
University will no longer be
possible if a union enters the
scene. Nowhere does the article
discuss the unequal bargaining
positions of a typical individual
worker versus the University.
Nowhere does it discuss
difficulties faced by workers in
the past in attempts to deal with
their not always benevolent
employer. The University likewise
fails to mention the possibility
that to a large extent, those
improvements in working
conditions which have taken place
in the last few years have been in
response to the mere threat of
workers forming a union.
Straw Man
Rather than discuss the merits
of the concrete proposals put
forward by USE, the Office of
Employee Relations chose to ask
itself whether a union can legally
refuse to file a grievance and
whether a union can legally
negotiate larger wage increases for
some workers than for others.
What a union can or cannot
"legally" do in the abstract is
nothing but a straw man.
The important question is not
what some hypothetical union
might be able to do without
violating the law. The relevant
question is what in fact USE
proposes to do and whether these
plans reflect the desires of
Stanford workers. The article put
out by the University seeks only
to divert attention from the real
issues involved.

On 17 May the Daily carried an
advertisement entitled "Talking
union ..." which claimed to
present unbiased information
about unions and collective
bargaining. The article was paid
for by the University, presumably
using monies provided at least in
part through the tuition paid by
the student body. As students
interested in the welfare of
Stanford workers, we were
outraged by the University's
financing of what was in fact
anti-union election propaganda.
While purporting to "promote an
understanding of the meaning of
the election and of the possible
issues involved in the outcome,"
the article distorts both the legal
and practical consequences of
collective bargaining.
For example, a theme running
throughout the article was the
spectre of a union impotent in
negotiations with the employer
but incessantly meddlesome in the
rights of individual workers. On
both counts, the article is an
unfair representation of the
choice facing workers on June 6.
