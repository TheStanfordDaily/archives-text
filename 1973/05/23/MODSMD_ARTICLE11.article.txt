Deputy Jerry Coleman's article
(Daily, May 15) on the RA Blues
was sure fine an' dandy, but us
Westerners got one complaint. Li'l
dogies are li'l cows, an' no cow
I've taken down the Abilene Trail
recently had paws. Didn't live in
holes, neither. If the Deputy
wants to argue, I'll meet him
outside the Red Pepper Saloon at
sun-up.

The innuendos toward Chapel
Dean Robert Kelly's alleged
prejudiced Christian faith and his
scant knowledge of racism
("Black Muslim Postpones
Campus Speech," 17 May 1973)
do not call for a defense, but do
require a response. Prof. Cedric
X's remarks were unfortunate in
revealing not only (an
understandable) lack of
knowledge of the nature of
Christian faith, but of the
circumstances surrounding Mr.
Kelly's national origin and of his
attitudes toward it.
Because these remarks were
not qualified by X or by the
Daily, they contribute to an
unfair representation of Mr.
Kelly's personal religious views
and racial attitudes. Without
arguing the merits or rationale of
Mr. Kelly's request to first speak
with John Muhammad before
deciding on granting the use of
the Church, the point should be
made that Mr. Kelly's decision
demonstrated not only a
consistency of conviction (which
Prof. X undoubtedly shares) but a
responsible and conscientious
attitude toward his own personal
faith which, while disagreeable to
some, is more than can be said for
many other religious leaders who
may be dogmatically consistent,
but irresponsible or
unconscientious in actually living
their professed beliefs.
I might add that my personal
acquaintance with Mr. Kelly has
led me to recognize his profound
religious and ethical bearing, a
bearing which would caution him
from making impetuous,
imprudent, and unqualified
remarks such as those he has had
to field.

I was pleased but not terribly
surprised to read Congressman
McCloskey's statement (Daily,
May 31) that "You don't need to
poll the students to ascertain their
views." The last politician to share
that opinion was a Midwestern
neo-socialist who wanted to save
the world by riding the youth
vote to the White House.
Hopefully some of Senator
McGovern's luck will rub off on
Mr. McCloskey in his next
election campaign.

The innuendos toward Chapel
Dean Robert Kelly's alleged
prejudiced Christian faith and his
scant knowledge of racism
("Black Muslim Postpones
Campus Speech," 17 May 1973)
do not call for a defense, but do
require a response. Prof. Cedric
X's remarks were unfortunate in
revealing not only (an
understandable) lack of
knowledge of the nature of
Christian faith, but of the
circumstances surrounding Mr.
Kelly's national origin and of his
attitudes toward it.
Because these remarks were
not qualified by X or by the
Daily, they contribute to an
unfair representation of Mr.
Kelly's personal religious views
and racial attitudes. Without
arguing the merits or rationale of
Mr. Kelly's request to first speak
with John Muhammad before
deciding on granting the use of
the Church, the point should be
made that Mr. Kelly's decision
demonstrated not only a
consistency of conviction (which
Prof. X undoubtedly shares) but a
responsible and conscientious
attitude toward his own personal
faith which, while disagreeable to
some, is more than can be said for
many other religious leaders who
may be dogmatically consistent,
but irresponsible or
unconscientious in actually living
their professed beliefs.
I might add that my personal
acquaintance with Mr. Kelly has
led me to recognize his profound
religious and ethical bearing, a
bearing which would caution him
from making impetuous,
imprudent, and unqualified
remarks such as those he has had
to field.

I was pleased but not terribly
surprised to read Congressman
McCloskey's statement (Daily,
May 31) that "You don't need to
poll the students to ascertain their
views." The last politician to share
that opinion was a Midwestern
neo-socialist who wanted to save
the world by riding the youth
vote to the White House.
Hopefully some of Senator
McGovern's luck will rub off on
Mr. McCloskey in his next
election campaign.
