# 'Bug Me'
## 
### 
My husband will be a resident at the Stanford Medical Center
beginning this July. I am a graduate student in English at Berkeley and
I will have to be on the Berkeley campus almost every day next year. 1
am very interested in finding out about the bus between the
campuses. Can you give me any information? I have heard that there
is a daily bus from Stanford to Berkeley and back but no one seems to
know more. Do you know the times it leaves each place, where it
departs from, how much it costs, and most important, the
arrangements that must be made in order to ride it? S.N.
There is a bus between Berkeley and Stanford, but it is mostly for
people commuting to Stanford from Berkeley, as evidence by the
schedule.
According to Robert Hrigley, head of the Peninsula Commuter
Club, the group that chartered the bus, it leaves Berkeley at 6:35 a.m.
and arrives at Stanford at 7:45. The return trip begins at Stanford at
5:05 p.m., and ends in Berkeley at 6:15.
The bus stops in front of the Old Pavilion at Stanford, on the
corner of Serra and Galvez streets.
It travels through Berkeley, making more than one stop. The bus
begins in north Berkeley, stopping first at the corner of Shattuck and
Rose. It travels down Shattuck to Hearst, and then cuts over to
Oxford. It goes south on Oxford, which eventually turns into Fulton.
Then the bus turns east onto Ashby and continues out to Highway 13.
The price is $1.65 one way, or you can buy a package of tickets
good for rides Monday through Friday for $11.
There are no special arrangements to be made in order to ride the
bus.

Today I went to the information window in the Old Union to pick
up a summer bulletin. The person behind me in line just wanted to
turn in a form. We waited for 20 minutes while the only woman on
duty helped one person. Why can't there be two windows — one for
"express " (picking up and turning in things) and one for real problems
that are going to take longer to solve? If not, why don't they set up a
table with booklets, etc. and have a basket for people to drop forms
in? M.M.
Armista Cook, Information Secretary and Supervisor in the
Registrar's office emphasized that staffers working at the Information
window do the best they can to serve people. She said that normally
there are two windows open when they are needed.
Cook explained that at the time the complaint was made, three of
the people who work in the Information office were sick. As a result,
the office was temporarily understaffed.
She went on to say that it is not feasible for them to leave booklets
out on a table. She said that they had tried putting booklets out in the
Old Union lobby, but people would "walk out with armloads."

duty helped one person. Why can't there be two windows — one for
"express " (picking up and turning in things) and one for real problems
that are going to take longer to solve? If not, why don't they set up a
table with booklets, etc. and have a basket for people to drop forms
in? M.M.
Armista Cook, Information Secretary and Supervisor in the
Registrar's office emphasized that staffers working at the Information
window do the best they can to serve people. She said that normally
there are two windows open when they are needed.
Cook explained that at the time the complaint was made, three of
the people who work in the Information office were sick. As a result,
the office was temporarily understaffed.
She went on to say that it is not feasible for them to leave booklets
out on a table. She said that they had tried putting booklets out in the
Old Union lobby, but people would "walk out with armloads."
My husband will be a resident at the Stanford Medical Center
beginning this July. I am a graduate student in English at Berkeley and
I will have to be on the Berkeley campus almost every day next year. 1
am very interested in finding out about the bus between the
campuses. Can you give me any information? I have heard that there
is a daily bus from Stanford to Berkeley and back but no one seems to
know more. Do you know the times it leaves each place, where it
departs from, how much it costs, and most important, the
arrangements that must be made in order to ride it? S.N.
There is a bus between Berkeley and Stanford, but it is mostly for
people commuting to Stanford from Berkeley, as evidence by the
schedule.
According to Robert Hrigley, head of the Peninsula Commuter
Club, the group that chartered the bus, it leaves Berkeley at 6:35 a.m.
and arrives at Stanford at 7:45. The return trip begins at Stanford at
5:05 p.m., and ends in Berkeley at 6:15.
The bus stops in front of the Old Pavilion at Stanford, on the
corner of Serra and Galvez streets.
It travels through Berkeley, making more than one stop. The bus
begins in north Berkeley, stopping first at the corner of Shattuck and
Rose. It travels down Shattuck to Hearst, and then cuts over to
Oxford. It goes south on Oxford, which eventually turns into Fulton.
Then the bus turns east onto Ashby and continues out to Highway 13.
The price is $1.65 one way, or you can buy a package of tickets
good for rides Monday through Friday for $11.
There are no special arrangements to be made in order to ride the
bus.

Today I went to the information window in the Old Union to pick
up a summer bulletin. The person behind me in line just wanted to
turn in a form. We waited for 20 minutes while the only woman on
duty helped one person. Why can't there be two windows — one for
"express " (picking up and turning in things) and one for real problems
that are going to take longer to solve? If not, why don't they set up a
table with booklets, etc. and have a basket for people to drop forms
