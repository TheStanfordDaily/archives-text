# Affirmative Action Criteria Debated
## 
### 
In enforcing affirmative action,
particularly in universities, the
Department of Health, Education,
and Welfare made fundamental
errors in assuming that
discrimination could always be
inferred from statistical data
alone, and in going beyond the
law against discrimination in
employment to encouraging
numerical quotas or goals, and
timetables, according to Sidney
Hook. Now a senior research
fellow at the Hoover Institution,
he formerly was a professor of
philosophy at New York
University.
"If the most qualified person is
not hired in a university, we will
soon be swamped by seas of
mediocrities,"Hook told an
audience of 150 people at
Stanford Thursday in a discussion
on affirmative action with Anne
S. Miner, University affirmative
action officer.
"If Prof. Hook's question is
'Isn't discrimination against white
males still discrimination and isn't
that a bad thing to build into
policy?' my answer to that is
'Yes,' " Miner responded.
"But there has been nationally
a version of this question which
goes something like this: 'Isn't
there a sweeping tide, due to
liberal guilt and based on a
reparations theory of affirmative
action, because of which white
male Ph.D.'s can hardly get a job
and the standards of academic
performance will crumble?'
"My answer to that is
unequivocally, 'No.' On the

whole, I think those who are
suggesting that that is the case are
irresponsible," Miner said.
"I'm not suggesting that Prof.
Hook is irresponsible, but I'm
raising the problem because, if
one speaks in a public forum and
suggests that it's true that,
particularly in faculty hiring,
there's a sweeping inrush of
women and minorities, this denies
the current reality that this is
simply not the case numerically.
"I think this question speaks to
the importance of using numbers
and using collected aggregate data
to look at what's actually
happening," Miner suggested.
Hook replied that "All my life
I have fought against
discrimination and quotas,
because I have suffered from them
in my own career. I admit that
discrimination does exist against
women and minorities, and it
must stop."
But he added: "Quotas and
goals are cognitively
indistinguishable." In either case a
person is being judged not in
terms of individual qualifications
but by membership within a
group.
"The consequence of such
hiring practices is reverse
discrimination against white
males," Hook argued. "Reverse
discrimination is just as bad as
present discrimination.
Everywhere young white men are
protesting that they are not being
allowed to compete fairly on the
basis of their individual
qualifications."

basis of their individual
qualifications."
In enforcing affirmative action,
particularly in universities, the
Department of Health, Education,
and Welfare made fundamental
errors in assuming that
discrimination could always be
inferred from statistical data
alone, and in going beyond the
law against discrimination in
employment to encouraging
numerical quotas or goals, and
timetables, according to Sidney
Hook. Now a senior research
fellow at the Hoover Institution,
he formerly was a professor of
philosophy at New York
University.
"If the most qualified person is
not hired in a university, we will
soon be swamped by seas of
mediocrities,"Hook told an
audience of 150 people at
Stanford Thursday in a discussion
on affirmative action with Anne
S. Miner, University affirmative
action officer.
"If Prof. Hook's question is
'Isn't discrimination against white
males still discrimination and isn't
that a bad thing to build into
policy?' my answer to that is
'Yes,' " Miner responded.
"But there has been nationally
a version of this question which
goes something like this: 'Isn't
there a sweeping tide, due to
liberal guilt and based on a
reparations theory of affirmative
action, because of which white
male Ph.D.'s can hardly get a job
and the standards of academic
performance will crumble?'
"My answer to that is
unequivocally, 'No.' On the

whole, I think those who are
suggesting that that is the case are
irresponsible," Miner said.
"I'm not suggesting that Prof.
Hook is irresponsible, but I'm
raising the problem because, if
one speaks in a public forum and
suggests that it's true that,
particularly in faculty hiring,
there's a sweeping inrush of
women and minorities, this denies
the current reality that this is
simply not the case numerically.
"I think this question speaks to
the importance of using numbers
and using collected aggregate data
to look at what's actually
happening," Miner suggested.
Hook replied that "All my life
I have fought against
discrimination and quotas,
because I have suffered from them
in my own career. I admit that
discrimination does exist against
women and minorities, and it
must stop."
But he added: "Quotas and
goals are cognitively
indistinguishable." In either case a
person is being judged not in
terms of individual qualifications
but by membership within a
group.
"The consequence of such
hiring practices is reverse
discrimination against white
males," Hook argued. "Reverse
discrimination is just as bad as
present discrimination.
Everywhere young white men are
protesting that they are not being
allowed to compete fairly on the
basis of their individual
qualifications."
