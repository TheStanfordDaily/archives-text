# Pentagon Uncertain About Success Of Voluntary Armed Forces Concept
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Some Pentagon
officials are becoming increasingly uncertain
that the United States can maintain adequate
armed forces on an all-volunteer basis.
The Pentagon's official position is that the
all-volunteer concept can and will succeed.
That has been its line since the outset of the
Nixon administration, long before the
government stopped drafting young men into
the Army last December.
But Gen. Creighton W. Abrams, the Army
chief of staff, told a reporter recently he is
not yet prepared to predict the outcome.
Abrams indicated he expects to know by next
winter, after about a year of experience
without the presence of the draft to spur
enlistments.
Another general said privately, "The
feeling is growing that it is doubtful we can
make it."

In a study for Congress, the General
Accounting Office predicted early this month
that the armed services could fall as many as
83,000 short of their goal of the 354,000 new
enlistments next year unless mental standards
are lowered.
But the Army and the other services resist
the idea of accepting more men who have not
graduated from high school and who score
among the lowest in qualification tests.
Ten months ago, the Pentagon put into
effect a new $1,500 bonus to lure young men
into enlisting for ground-combat jobs in the
Army and the Marine Corps, an area of
considerable difficulty in raising enough
manpower.
But late last month, the Pentagon had to
raise that bonus to $2,500 for a four-year
enlistment because the small bonus wasn't
working well enough. The higher bonus is

being tested this month and next, along with a
new $2,500 enlistment bonus for men
equipped to handle a dozen technical skills in
short supply.
The bonus is only one of a range of new
initiatives the Nixon administration opened
up over the past four years in its bid for
shifting away from a draft-based military
force to one built out of volunteers only.
There were major increases in military pay,
improvements in the general conditions of
service life, elimination of some of the
spit-and-polish and "Mickey Mouse"
annoyances, greatly intensified recruiting
efforts and other measures.
The question now facing Pentagon military
and civilian officials is: What can work, if all
the improvements and enticement attempted
so far do not?
