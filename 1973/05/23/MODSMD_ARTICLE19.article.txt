# Interview With Sunday Flicks Manager
## 
### LARRY HUMMER 
Come Sunday night, chances
are you can find the masses at the
Flicks. This year, attendance has
on five occasions surpassed the
high for last year. Faced with a
choice between the library and
the movies, studs, dollies, libbers,
and freaks have been increasingly
opting for the entertainment
provided by Baker Terry, this
year's ASSU Sunday Flicks
Manager.
Terry is totally responsible for
selecting and scheduling the
movies, placing the advertising,
and making sure the whole thing
comes off. Recently the Daily
talked to Terry, to find out how
he operates, and to get his
personal views on movies.
He impresses the interviewer
with his dynamism. He knows
what he is doing, and he sets out
to do it. Terry is very forthright in
expressing his opirlions. One
might think from his job that he
would be , a Communications
major, but no. An economics
major with a "strong leaning
toward political science," Terry

will be going on to law school
next fall.
"I am not a movie freak," he
said. "It's just sort of an office
job. You're kind of running a
small business.
Independence
"I enjoy very much the
independence of it, I work the
hours I choose to work. I run the
flicks the way I choose to run the
flicks." He is almost entirely free
of supervision, although he is
answerable to the ASSU Financial
Manager.
Terry is supported by a staff of
box office people and
concessionaires drawn from
various fraternities. The student
police, all Theta Delts, take the
tickets at the door.
Terry, a member of SAE,
worked in the box office for last
year's Flicks Manager, a personal
friend, Bob Sisson.
Terry was responsible for
carrying receipts to the bank, and
he was able to learn about Sisson's
job while working with him. When
the position came open, he

applied and got it over four
others.
Wide Appeal
His most important task as
manager is to shedule movies with
wide audience appeal among
Stanford students.
The Flicks needs to draw two
thousands people just to break
even, and Terry believes most
people are basically looking for
sheer entertainment. This is why
there have not been many "arty"
movies, because the average
student is not a film connoisseur.
Terry avoids what he calls the
"genre" movie like the plague.
For example, he feels that
"Downhill Racer" is the kind of
movie that would appeal only to
skiers, that "Le Mans" would
appeal only to car freaks.
To figure out what has wide
appeal, Terry relies on ideas
provided by his friends, national
attendance figures as published in
"Variety," and questionnaires
distributed at the Flicks. He
collects ideas throughout the
quarter previous to the one he is
going to be scheduling for.
Difficult Task
Then he gets on the phone to
the distributors in San Francisco,
to see what films are available.
Really big current pictures like
"The Godfather" are next to
impossible to get because they are
heavily scheduled at regular
theatres.
Surprisingly, he was able to get
"The Candidate" last fall, so he
showed it two days before the
election. With that same uncanny
sense of timing, the last film this
year will be "The Graduate,"
which was suggested by a student
on a questionnaire.
After he has established the
schedule, he sets up the
advertising, using standard ads
provided by the distributor, which
is why they are so
professional-looking. Terry spends
$120 to have 10,000 copies of the
schedule printed up and
distributed on campus.
He also runs ads on Thursday
and Friday in the Daily, generally
using a copy of the ad used for
the schedule, "for
reinforcement." The idea is to
give quick identification by using
the same form, to get people in

the habit of going to the Flicks.
Commmission Basis
Much of the Flicks Manager's
pay is essentially on a commission
basis, made dependent on the
attendance. With the attendance
high, Terry has been paid well:
around $650 per quarter, for
about 100 hours of work.
Of course, scheduling is not all
there is to the job. Keeping the
Flicks running can be an
interesting task. The manager has,
for instance, had to deal with the
problems caused by young
non-Stanford students, who were
creating disturbances during the
movies.
"It was a matter of them being
unfriendly to the Flicks," Terry
said. "My primary responsibility is
to Stanford students. I'm not
opposed to people making
comments, having a good time. It
is a fifty cent flick. But we had a
crowd of kids who were not as
interested in seeing the Flicks as
in getting together with
themselves."
Things were getting out of
hand. Some kids were lowering
themselves through a skylight over
the stage, and then getting down
by a series of catwalks, a highly
dangerous practice at best.
Damaged Backdrops
Some stage backdrops were
damaged. The Flicks Manager was
getting all kinds of complaints.
Since "it threatened the future of
the Flicks," Terry decided to ban
non-students under 18 unless they
were with their parents. That
move ended the problem.
Another time Terry had to deal
with a power failure during "A
Man for All Seasons." He worked
out a deal with the distributor in
which the film was shown again
for free on another date.
Terry has found that
sometimes the job calls for fast
talking, pure and simple. The
night that "I Am Curious,
Yellow" was shown, there was a
scuffle in the lobby between two
individuals, so the Stanford police
were called. They passed the call
to the Sheriffs Department.
"Five cars roared up," said
Terry. "A guy got out with a
ten-gallon hat on. They're kind of
keyed; they want to shut down
the Flicks. I went out, identified

myself as the Flicks Manager, and
talked with them. I explained that
there wasn't really a riot, but there
would be one if they went in
there."
Front Page Pic
The Daily next day had a front
page picture of a policeman in
front of Mem Aud, under the
headline "Disturbance Plagues
Flicks."
"I was enraged at the Daily's
coverage," Terry Said. "That's,
lousy reporting." He feels that a
big thing was made out of
nothing. Perhaps as a result of this
incident, Terry seemed at times
quite suspicious of the Daily's
present intentions in interviewing
him.
That Monday Baker Terry was
called into the office of the
University's legal counsel, James
Siena. Siena did want to talk
about the big ruckus, but the
University's main concern was to
be certain that age requirements
were being enforced at X-rated
movies. Terry is quick to
emphasize that "there has been
absolutely no pressure on me at
all by the University on what I
schedule."
He does believe, however, that
scheduling of films more
pornographic than "I Am Curious,
Yellow" would run into
opposition from alumni and
student groups.
Hesitancy
"I have some hesitancy, " he
said, "in showing certain
pornographic films because of the
hassles I would go through as
Flicks Manager. I do not impose
personal moral standards. But
trying to show 'Deep Throat' at
the Sunday Flicks would cause a
lot of controversy that could be
avoided."
He does not want to end up
hurting "the interests of the
Sunday Flicks itself as a Stanford
institution. It does have a
reputation."
Regarding the raging
controversy over whether
portrayals of violence in
the movies does not encourage
violence among some people,
Terry says,"I do think it is a very
dangerous trend to restrict what
all people can do because we
think it's important for a few

people. We can restrict all people
from crossing state lines. There is
a trend to restrict people so that
people can be more easily
controlled. I think that's an
ominous trend."
Violence Exploits
However, to protect children
from bad influences, Terry
believes that television should not
portray violence that exploits
what he calls the "machismo
feeling, that it's strong, forceful,
and masculine to be violent."
He believes children should not
see violent movies in theatres
without the use of the rating
system to assure their parents'
consent.
As to his own viewing
preferences, Terry goes to all

different kinds of movies, based
on what friends say about them.
He does not care what stars are in
them, but just whether the acting
is good. Undoubtedly, these
viewing habits have helped him to
the scheduling successes he has
had this year.
Just as the Flicks are more
popular this year, so is the job of
Flicks manager. Fully twenty
people submitted applications for
next year's post. The selection
was jointly made by Baker Terry,
ASSU Financial Manager Sarah
Moore, and incoming Financial
Manager Dave Martin after a
lengthy culling process.
Bob Sisson, last year's Flicks
manager, will again be in charge.
And the show goes on.
