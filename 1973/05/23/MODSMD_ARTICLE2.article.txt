# Chapel Dean Regrets 'Bad Communications'
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
Dean of the Chapel Robert G. H.
Kelly last night attributed the
postponement of Black Muslim
Minister John Muhammad's speech to
a "series of bad communications."
"If we had it to do again, we could
make it an important contribution to
the religious life of the University,"
Kelly said.
Asst. Psychology Prof. Cedic X and
Black Students Union (BSU) leaders
last week asked Kelly to schedule the
Muhammad appearance in the Church.
Before Kelly had made a final
decision, Muhammad's spokesmen said
he would not appear.
"I sincerely regret that my
questions about the Black Muslims
became public," Kelly said on KZSU's
"Campus Conference" last night. Kelly
last week described his discussions
with X to the Daily.
South Africa
The 34-year-old South African-born
dean said it was "very painful to find
myself in this position . . . appearing as
an opponent of blacks. . . . I'm deeply
attached to Africa and Africans. I feel
at home with them."
"Racism — lumping all members of
a group together as somehow less than
human — is the foot in the door. After
that, all things can follow . . . genocide
finally becomes possible," Kelly said,
emphasizing his study of Jewish
history as well as his background as a
"voluntary exile" from South Africa.
Last night, he said that he had
invited "a representative group from
the Stanford community" to serve as
an advisory board in making decisions
regarding events sought to be
scheduled in the Church. The board
will meet for the first time on
Thursday.
Consultation
"In the future, I hope decisions
| regarding use of the Church | will be
made ultimately by me ... in real
consultation with the representative
board," he said.
He said he had only the Church

staff to consult during the Muhammad
incident.
"I was predisposed to let
Muhammad speak if we could talk
with them [Muhammad's local
sponsors] and work out an
appropriate event. We did this with
I.F. Stone's recent appearance," Kelly
remarked.
Kelly said he discussed the
proposed Muhammad appearance with
X, who said that he was not able to
discuss the racial content of
Muhammad's theology with Kelly.
Before any further discussions
could be held, the Daily reported the
situation, and after one meeting
between Kelly and BSU leaders, the
BSU announced that Muhammad
would not appear at Stanford.
Pickets
Last Sunday, about 50 BSU
members picketed the Church and BSU
Chairman Charles Ogletree, at Kelly's
suggestion, outlined the BSU position
to the congregation in Memorial
Church.
"The community wants the church
to be more pluralistic and free than I
had initially interpreted the policy
statements" regarding use of the
Church, Kelly continued. "I'm very
happy that the church should be a free
space .... But I don't like to ride
roughshod over anyone's sensibilities."
He said that future policy regarding
use of the church will generally
continue as in the past under former
Dean B. Davie Napier. "We're here to
serve students first," Kelly said.
He said that he and BSU leaders
Ogletree and Tony Briscoe were
"planning to work together to combat
racism .... They're interested in the
investment policy of the University,"
specifically, in opposing University
investment in corporations with
facilities in South Africa and other
African nations ruled by wliit»-
minority governments.
He said that during a recent visit to
his native land he had engaged in
"political things that I can't discuss."
