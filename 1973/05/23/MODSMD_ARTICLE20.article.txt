# 'Lost Horizon' Loses Out
## 
### ELLEN KENESHEA 
Ross Hunter's production of
"Lost Horizon," a musical remake
of the Frank Capra film of the
same name, is socially
anachronistic, politically
reactionary, and excrutiatingly
naive in its philosophy.
The story begins in the present
as three white Americans and two
white Englishmen board a plane
to escape from a revolution in
Southeast Asia. Unbeknownst to
them, the pilot is actually from a
lost valley deep in the Himalayas
called Shangri La.
The pilot takes them to
Shangri La instead of home
because the High Lama there is
dying and has chosen one of the
Englishmen, Peter Finch, to be his
successor.
It turns out that all of the
people on the plane except
Finch's brother, Michael York,
have been running through their
lives unhappily, looking for a way
out. Sally Kellerman plays a
nervous Newsweek reporter, a
high strung pill popper. George
Kennedy is an engineer turned
bankrupt capitalist and on the lam
from his creditors.
Bobby Van is the washed up
comedian of the group, and Finch
portrays everyone's dream of the
idealistic but strong humanitarian.
He got involved with the
revolution in the first place only
as head of a United Nations
peace-keeping team.
Utopia
For these four, Shangri La
turns out to be Utopia. Only

Michael York, a young and
energetic journalist wants a way
out of the valley, because, we are
led to assume, he can't learn how
to be at peace with himself.
Shangri La has been set up by
its leader as the model for a future
humanity. It is a repository for
the cultural artifacts of current
civilization (only, however, the
non-technological,
non-mechanical ones like books
and paintings), and when society
destroys itself in some final
holocaust, Shangri La alone will
remain to point out the way to
enlightenment.
But what is Shangri La? It is,
from what we see, a hierarchical
male-dominated culture. It is also
an imperialistic one, since, though
most of the population of several
thousand is composed of
Tibetan/Oriental natives, the
ruling class is strictly imported,
white, and Western.
Hypocritical Motto
The motto of Shangri La is "be
kind," yet its leaders feel no
compunction about kidnapping
five people and forcing them to
remain, whether with or without
consent. And when Chang (John
Gielgud) announces the arrival of
the strangers to the High Lama
(Charles Boyer), he fails to even
mention the death of the plane's
pilot, a long-time member of the
community himself.
Given that the content cannot
be salvaged, what of the rest of
"Lost Horizon?" Unfortunately it
is as unremittingly dull and witless
as its concept of Shangri La.

Burt Bacharach's score for the
film is the kind one tends to
quickly forget, and Hal David's
lyrics are the type that one wants
to forget. The banality of Larry
Kramer's screenplay is a fair
match for the music.
Director Charles Jarrott does
no good by any of the fine actors
and actresses under his command.
He is better on special effects and
shots of people struggling through
snowy mountains, but it's entirely
possible that his second unit
directors did the mountain
sequences.
Jarrott's actors seldom look
comfortable whether or not
they're supposed to. Michael York
gives the best performancy of the
lot, which is still far from his best.
Given the script, though, and the
stereotyped feel to the characters,
bringing feeling to any of the
parts is all uphill work.
Finch is much too somber and
heavy for the musical moments of

"Lost Horizon," and fairly stolid
the rest of the time. One can't
help but suspect that he stays in
Shangri La out of a lust for power
rather than for any
"humanitarian" motives.
The others are simply dull,
with the exception of Sally
Kellerman who becomes
antagonizingly silly as the film
wears on.
The over-riding contradiction
in "Lost Horizon" is, of course,
that this slick motion picture,
product of a technological
society, should celebrate the
virtues of a meditative,
non-mechanized culture that has
no need of movies, and exists as a
condemnation of those societies
that make films at all. It is a
contradiction that "Lost
Horizon" fails to deal with, as it
finally fails to deal with any of
the ideas or problems upon which
it is based.
