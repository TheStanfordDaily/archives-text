# Musical 'Gigi' Needs Vast Revision
## 
### JEFFERY SEGAL 
Since their collaboration began
in 1942, Alan Jay Lerner and
Frederick Loewe have provided
the musical theater with many of
its most memorable moments in
"Brigadoon," "Paint Your
Wagon," "My Fair Lady," and
"Camelot," to name their most
famous stage musicals.
When Loewe retired after
"Camelot" it appeared that the
musical theater would never see
another new musical from that
team. However, the San Francisco
Civic Light Opera has managed to
coax them back together again to

write a stage version of their film
musical, "Gigi."
Sadly, the promise of a great,
new musical from the famous pair
has been betrayed. Although
"Gigi" has some fine moments
and a good deal of potential,
currently the work is
overwhelmingly flawed.
Parisian Tomboy
The story of the musical, based
on the writings of Colette
concerns a Parisian tomboy
named Gigi, whose grandmother,
Mamita, and her great aunt, Alice,
are determined to educate her in
the ways of a high society

courtesan.
Gaston Lachailles, a friend of
the family, is a rich and handsome
member of Parisian high society,
and is thoroughly bored with it.
He finds an innocent refuge in the
company of young, fresh, honest
Gigi. But when little Gigi grows
up into a beautiful young woman,
their relationship must change,
and so it does, into love.
Gaston's uncle and Mamita's
former lover, an aging roue named
Honore, is our guide through the
love affair and the whole Parisian
milieu.
Had Lerner stayed with the
simple story of human
relationships he began with, and
focused on genuine interaction
between the characters, rather
than wasting his time trying to be
as gratuitously witty as Neil
Simon, the script might have
turned out much better.
Cluttered Script
Instead he cluttered it with a
thoroughly inadequate and
inconsequential view of the
Parisian social life, spending far
too much time saying too little.
The chorus number, "Da Da
Da Da," which attempts to
imitate the hushed gossip of the
society crowd, is even worse than
the number that probably inspired
it, Rodgers and Hammerstein's
equivalent, "Ya Ta Ta," from
their fiasco, "Allegro."
The major trouble, primarily in
the first act, is that Lerner was

trying to write a mood play, yet
never established the mood.
However, all this is placing too
much blame on Lerner alone.
Loewe's usually stirring music,
which kept people from thinking
too hard about major weaknesses
in the script of "Camelot," is
banal and trite. If anything saves
the new songs it is the occasional
inspiration of Lemer's lyrics.
Rare Inspiration
"In This Wide, Wide World,"
sung by Gigi, is the only
individual new number where
both music and lyrics show a level
of technical, emotional, and
intellectual complexity sorely
lacking in the other new numbers.

singing in what sounds like an
immature voice and then later
sang beautifully in the most
touching moment of the show,
"In This Wide, Wide World."
However, had she decided to
keep the melifluousness of her
voice as young Gigi, as does young
Lili in "Carnival," she would not
have been so irritating. She nearly
flogged the audience to death
with "The Parisians," and could
only try to redeem herself in the
insipid "I Never Want to Go
Home Again."
Disappointing Portrayal
Most disappointing was Agnes
Moorehead, whose portrayal of
caustic Aunt Alice was bogged
