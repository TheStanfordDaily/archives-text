Also worthy of mention for its
uniqueness is a short, witty, comic
operetta within the second act
called "The Contract." But aside
from those numbers, the audience
was left to applaud the musical
genius of the old hits, which took
up half the score.
The performer who kept the
sky from falling and literally
carried the show on his shoulders
is Alfred Drake as Honore. One
must see the show if for no other
reason than to see that the man
who played the first romantic lead
of the modern musical theater
some thirty years ago — Curly in
"Oklahoma!" — is more
handsome, suave, and appealing,
as well as being a far better singer
and actor, than the show's leading
man, Daniel Massey.
Drake's eyes flashed at the
audience with a roguish intimacy
that drew them to him entranced,
and his engaging grace and perfect
timing made his scenes float miles
above the rest of the show.
Pleasurable Acting
Maria Karnilova as Mamita was
also very warm, and a pleasure to
watch.
Gaston was played like the pale
ghost of Henry Higgins by Daniel
Massey, rather to the detriment of
his personal appeal as a lover. He
is not too much of a singer and
seems a bit out of place in musical
comedy, but even if he was not
inspiring, he at least passed
amiably by.
Teresa Stevens did her best
with a role written to be far more
petulant than appealing as Gigi.
She tried a very ambitious mode
of characterizing young Gigi by

down in drawling dowdiness. Her
lines came out at times like taffy
being pulled, and slowed the show
dangerously down.
Small, supportive roles were
well executed. But the chorus was
soft and indistinct. Amazingly,
academy award winner Ona White
has provided some of the dullest
choreography in the history of the
musical stage in the first act.
Tired execution by a mediocre
dance company didn't make it
look any better.
Oliver Smith's set, which is
attractive in individual scenes, is a
mechanical monstrosity, poorly
masked, profusely using cut drops
that throw innovative scenic
design back two centuries.
Admirable Lighting
Lighting by Thomas Skelton
tied Smith's set together as much
as it could, and represents an
admirable job.
The finest of the technical
achievements came in the
marvelous use of texture and
color to say more about the
characters than the script did in
the costumes of Oliver Messel.
Faced with the difficult job of
overseeing this troubled show,
director Joseph Hardy has done
a good, clean job of presenting
what he was given to work with,
although possibly the exertion of
stronger directorial judgment over
the artistic whole might have
aided the production.
Dispite the best efforts of
many tremendously talented
people, "Gigi" is in a lot of
trouble. Unless some serious
reworking is done quickly, she
may not be with us for long.

overseeing this troubled show,
director Joseph Hardy has done
a good, clean job of presenting
what he was given to work with,
although possibly the exertion of
stronger directorial judgment over
the artistic whole might have
aided the production.
Dispite the best efforts of
many tremendously talented
people, "Gigi" is in a lot of
trouble. Unless some serious
reworking is done quickly, she
may not be with us for long.
Also worthy of mention for its
uniqueness is a short, witty, comic
operetta within the second act
called "The Contract." But aside
from those numbers, the audience
was left to applaud the musical
genius of the old hits, which took
up half the score.
The performer who kept the
sky from falling and literally
carried the show on his shoulders
is Alfred Drake as Honore. One
must see the show if for no other
reason than to see that the man
who played the first romantic lead
of the modern musical theater
some thirty years ago — Curly in
"Oklahoma!" — is more
handsome, suave, and appealing,
as well as being a far better singer
and actor, than the show's leading
man, Daniel Massey.
Drake's eyes flashed at the
audience with a roguish intimacy
that drew them to him entranced,
and his engaging grace and perfect
timing made his scenes float miles
above the rest of the show.
Pleasurable Acting
Maria Karnilova as Mamita was
also very warm, and a pleasure to
watch.
Gaston was played like the pale
ghost of Henry Higgins by Daniel
Massey, rather to the detriment of
his personal appeal as a lover. He
is not too much of a singer and
seems a bit out of place in musical
comedy, but even if he was not
inspiring, he at least passed
amiably by.
Teresa Stevens did her best
with a role written to be far more
petulant than appealing as Gigi.
She tried a very ambitious mode
of characterizing young Gigi by

down in drawling dowdiness. Her
lines came out at times like taffy
being pulled, and slowed the show
dangerously down.
Small, supportive roles were
well executed. But the chorus was
soft and indistinct. Amazingly,
academy award winner Ona White
has provided some of the dullest
choreography in the history of the
musical stage in the first act.
Tired execution by a mediocre
dance company didn't make it
look any better.
Oliver Smith's set, which is
attractive in individual scenes, is a
mechanical monstrosity, poorly
masked, profusely using cut drops
that throw innovative scenic
design back two centuries.
Admirable Lighting
Lighting by Thomas Skelton
tied Smith's set together as much
as it could, and represents an
admirable job.
The finest of the technical
achievements came in the
marvelous use of texture and
color to say more about the
characters than the script did in
the costumes of Oliver Messel.
