# Belly Dancing Hailed As 'Liberation'
## 
### CLAIRE SPIEGEL 
The Middle Eastern belly dance has struggled for years
against Victorian morality to keep its toehold in the
Western world. Now American women of all ages and
shapes are hailing it as their sexual liberation and
trampling the ancient art form with their enthusiasm.
Battered into a bold sexual statement, the dance sells as a
commodity.
The rash of how-to-do-it books can't keep up with the
demand. Advertising belly dancing on his sex talk show,
KNEW radio, along with Make-Love body lotion and
erotic waterbeds, Don Chamberlain coos, "Belly dancing
makes your body beautiful."
Magana Baptiste, who owns a huge yoga, dance, and
health studio-complex in San Francisco, has capitalized on
the fad. Enrollment in her belly dancing classes has
skyrocketed to over 300. She hires out her best students
to dance at private parties and to teach at YWCA's and
cultural centers on the peninsula. She and her troupe have
appeared on the Ed Sullivan and Jim Dunbar television
shows. "Many housewives take lessons; airline
stewardesses and office workers, too" she says.

"Some are repressed and tense. For some, their
boyfriends and husbands have requested it. Others just
want to dance to keep in shape." Her classes bridge the
generation gap. "Life is a body trip," exclaimed one
daring grandmother in a sequined, chiffon costume. "I
should have started 20 years and 20 pounds ago." She is
sandwiched between a college co-ed, draped casually in an
Indian bedspread, and a middle-aged housewife in a
gold-coined bra and girdle.
The studio's atmosphere is more spectacular than
either Magana's instruction or her students' performance.
A jewelled Turkish maypole. Eastern sculpture, bizarre
paintings, paper flowers, and flickering, colored lights lend

an oriental flavor. Each woman picks an exotic name —
like Nefertiti or Nashahah. Just as their names and
costumes vary, so do their dance styles. Magana invites,
"Do what you feel like with the music, girls."
The response is mayhem. One woman breaks into a
rambunctious breast shimmy, and the gold coins fly from
her bra. The girl beside her withdraws into a seductive
belly roll, rippling her stomach in and out in time to the
sinuous beat of drums and the clatter of finger cymbals. A
more advanced student works into a frenzy of twirls,
collapses into a backbend, and eases her spine flat against
the floor while writhing and pulling her fingers through
her hair.
This lascivious 20th century approach disgusts the
professional Jamila Salimpour, first teacher of belly
dancing in California and second dancer to come to San
Francisco. "I don't like the fingers through the hair, hair
through the teeth - the hissing dancer who is so torrid she
turns every man on."
Scorning those who imitate American burlesque and
the girlii* shows, she says, "A dancer must be an
inspiration. She must challenge the audience with her
incredible pace and stamina." One of her students, a
performer at the Casbah Nightclub in San Francisco says,
"I don't have to show leg and ass. I reach the audience
with the art in my movement."
A Fad?
As for the fad, Jamila says bluntly, "It ignores
tradition and technique." The origins of the belly dance,
she explains, were serious rituals, venerating the
involuntary spasms of childbirth, which later became a
mime form and then dance. Her students are trying to
revive the art's rigorous muscular technique and
abdominal gymnastics. They learn from Jamila in the back
of a poultry warehouse.
If the fad is fussy, thriving upon atmosphere and decor.

Jamila skips the frills and equips her studio with essentials
— a slick, wooden floor; an enormous mirror; tape
recorder; and live drummers. Steel gray curtains covering
the walls encourage concentration.
Class begins with 15 minutes of intricate finger cymbal
exercise — triplets alternate with three against four
rhythm counterpointing the music. Dancers must acquire
an ear for strange Middle Eastern instruments like the oud
and kanoun and for modal melodies. They must also
discover and isolate movement in muscles they never
knew existed, learn to rotate one hip at a time while
vibrating the shoulders and relaxing the stomach
"lateral shimmies." "Raise your knees like pistons,"
Jamila says forcefully.
"Move the gluteus muscle, not the pelvis." With a rare
burst of smile she rewards their effort. She is a large
woman with big feet and hands. She moves subtly, with
dignity and strength. Thick, black braids fall to her waist
from the hair piled high on her head. Her students call her
"Mother-Goddess."
Although amateurs have fabricated a less rigorous
version of the dance, it remains good exercise for the

abdomen and buttocks. "How else can you work out on
these parts of your body unless you're going to lift
weights with your hips?" one woman asked. Others claim
that belly dancing trims the waistline and increases the
bust. Students generally agree that the more a girl has to
shake, the better.
"An excess of hips and bust looks great," one said,
confiding she is too heavy to make it as a modern dancer.
A Stanford co-ed looked for cross-cultural comparisons.
"Belly dancing isn't a part of the American 'tininess
thing.' Over here, people think that sticking your stomach
in and out is pretty gross, because in our culture we're not
even supposed to have stomachs. It's the flat look, you
know. But in the Middle East, it's good to have something
to shake."
Spiritual Release
For many, belly dancing is a spiritual, as well as
physical, release. Magana Baptiste claims the dance
vibrates the "solar plexus, the feeling center." One of her
middle-aged students bubbled, "I'm spreading love, joy,
and beauty." A student at the Palo Alto cultural center
and mother of five grown children says the music turns
her on,
"I get a really good feeling from letting loose." Her
confidence has picked up too. Since she went to her first
lesson in a leotard and tights, she has stripped down to the
minimum like the others. "My friends are pretty
impressed with an old bag like me," she laughed.
Although most women confide that they perform for
their boyfriends and husbands, only a few put it blatantly.
"This is a sex education class for women," Theressa
explained. "The teacher says things that embarrass the
hell out of me." Leonore suggested that the dance
provides an opportunity for women to fulfill their
fantasies. Robin said, very confidentially, "It definitely
loosens you up in bed." Barbara put it nicely, "You are
tightening up THOSE muscles."
The recreation and cultural centers and the YWCA's
have spread the belly dance fad. Women are signing
waiting lists for classes which enroll as many as 30
students for as much as $3.50 a lesson. Although the Mid
Peninsula YWCA offers only two classes, the program
director says she could easily fill four. Teachers are
selected pretty casually. She explained, "Our 'Taji
Rakesmha' just happened to apply for a job at the right
time when we needed a teacher."
Aura Of Mystery
"Zarifa Aradoon" teaches four classes at the Palo Alto
cultural center. A contract with the Department of Parks
and Recreation has boosted her enrollment to over 200.

Surrounding herself with an aura of mystery, Zarifa shies
away from personal questions. She prefers not to label
herself by nationality and says simply. "Americans think
I'm an Arab, and Arabs think I'm American." Quoting her
favorite author, Kahil Gibran, she explains, " The human
family is my life,' too I think religion, race, and where a
person is from divides people. 1 do not wish to be involved
in these divisions. It's part of my philosophy. I just want
to be Zarifa."
But who is "Zarifa," really? Vicki Banes — graduate
from Cal Berkeley in 1965 with a B.A. in fine arts, a
mother of two and wife of a writer. Always an avid
dancer, and a performer with a professional Afro-Cuban
dance troupe at age 17, she took up belly dancing during
her undergraduate days. Now she is writing the "first
serious book" on the belly dance based upon a summer
spent in the Middle East and confidential sources. When
pressed, she admits she has studied with various teachers,
but insists nevertheless, she is a "self-made" dancer. "I
don't give credit to my teachers," she said, "because they
didn't make me the dancer I am today."
Jamila Salimpour, one of her former teachers,
denounces as imposters those who set themselves up as
authorities. "It's gotten so that any woman who likes
costume jewelry, who has taken a few lessons and has
enough nerve, can call herself a belly dancer, start
teaching at exorbitant rates, and who's going to call her a
phoney? There is no criterion."
Jamila expects honesty of others, and she is blunt
about herself. Born and raised in New York City, she says
candidly, "I was born in the United States — just like all
the others." But unlike the others, Jamila was dancing and
teaching long before belly dancing became an in-thing.
Years ago, when her husband's relatives immigrated to the
United States from Persia, they were horrified at her
dancing.
The American public, too, considered the dance
"risque," she said. Then, she had only three students and
barely enough money to pay the studio rent and her
babysitter. Twenty-seven years later, she is bombarded
with customers. But Jamila is looking for dancers, not
business. "They must be young and the goddess-type,"
she said assertively. "And I find I can only communicate
with females who don't play games. I don't think the
dance should be the speciality of predatory women."
Pursuing High Standards
If she sets high standards for others, she has set even
higher ones for herself, by comparing her ability with the
great Egyptian classicists. Nearly 50 years old, she
describes how she became intrigued by the dance almost
30 years ago. "I used to go to the Egyptian movies with
my Egyptian landlady. Once in a while, we'd see the
dancers. I was awed! These were the top dancers.
"If we had anything like them in this country today,
all of us would run and hide. How dare we say we are any
kind of exponent simply because we know the mechanics.
But we certainly can not execute them like the Middle
Eastern dancers. Shame, shame on us! Although I held my
own in clubs with Algerian girls, and Turkish and
Egyptian dancers, 1 would never say 1 am the caliber that
they are, simply because they were dancers over there. I
became a dancer over here."

Her knowledge and style have developed from close
observation of great artists like Samia Jamal. "If she were
in this country today, THERE would be the criterion,"
Jamila exclaimed. Farid Nabti from Lebanon, has seen
Samia Jamal dance with a boa constrictor about 12 feet
long and one-half foot in diameter. "She blows up your
mind!" he said. Like a goddess, she enters a huge cage
and soothes a snake which has been goaded to anger by
young girls picking his skin with long needles.

"And soon she is dancing with the snake, with her arms
around him, like man and wife with her arms on his
shoulder. And when she kisses him, you see her make-up
glistening on his skin. They move together, so beautiful! 1
do not know if the snake imitates the girl or the girl
imitates the snake." He continued, 'Wo man, wherever in
the world he comes from, can think of her as a sex
object." She arouses them, but she soothes them too, "in
a way that they are completely taken in and fascinated by
her movement."
The belly dance in the Middle Kast has run the gauntlet
— from its abduction into the harem, to its common

exploitation today as a girlie show for tourists. Although
the female figure in Egypt is officially under wraps, Farid
confesses that some girls "take off their clothes and shake
up a bit, anyhow."
All too typical are "belly dancers" like the ones
accompanying a Lebanese orchestra on tour of the United
States last summer. With their nparkling high heels and big
bows covering the pubic area, they looked mori ..»«• Las

Vegas chorus girls. In 1967, Nasser tried to clean up the
dance when he ordered performers to wear body stocking
covering their navels; his efforts have met with only
limited success.
Slanderous History
In the United States, too, the belly dance has suffered
a slanderous history, beginning with its introduction in
1893 by an American entrepreneur, who sponsored a
troupe of Middle Eastern scorpion-swallowers, glass-eaters,
and belly dancers at the Chicago Fair. An imitator, "Little
Egypt," who passed herself off as an original, set a
demeaning precedent when she emerged naked from a
huge pie served at an all-male party.
Today, belly dancers performing next door to
hard-core sex acts in San Francisco's North Beach are
pressured to reveal more of their bodies and to imitate the
girlie shows. One performer at the Casbah nightclub
explained that there arc some checks. "If any belly dancer
were to go topless, she'd get such violent reactions from
the others that she wouldn't stick around for long."
If the belly dance survives the onslaught of 20th
century commercialism, much of the credit will go to
young, dedicated professionals like Aida. "If you're into
dancing to make money, you won't last long," she
predicts. "The work is too hard." She dances at the
Casbah Nightclub seven days a week, three 45-minute
shows each night until 2:00. In addition, she teaches in
the morning and studies classical Arabic and Middle
Eastern music in the afternoon.
"I'm eating, breathing, and living the Arabic culture,"
she says energetically, "but I don't know if I'm digesting
it all." The real test is performance. "You don't prove it
by talking it," she emphasizes, "You prove it by dancing
it — up there on stage." And so she does. Her tattoos and
costume are authentic. She responds intuitively to changes
in tempo and beat and moves deftly, balancing a long
sabre on her head. Building the movements of the dance
to a climax, she creates a symphony. She becomes an
ensemble with the musicians, and, she adds, "Believe me,
if they wanted to, they could make me look bad!" A
musician herself, she received her B.A. in voice and opera
and was a bassoonist with the California State orchestra.
Belly dancing has become more than her profession.
She looks ahead eagerly, "There is so much to learn about
it, so many things to l)e translated and understood. It's a
virgin field."

GROSS? — "Bollv Dancing isn't a part of the American 'tininess thing'. Over here, people think that sticking your
stomach in and out is pretty gross, because in our culture we're not even supposed to have stomachs. It's the flat look.
But in the Middle East, it's good to have something to shake."
