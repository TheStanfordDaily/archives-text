## Biggest Tennis Battle Looms Ahead 
### Viae Kershner 
Pundits from coast to coast are now trying
to decide which collegiate tennis team is the
best in the country.
For a while, the choice was easy — the top
team must be Stanford, by virtue of its win at
the National Indoor Tournament in Madison
last February.
Then USC started catching up, and
compiled the best record in the Pac-8
Southern Division. Then Stanford came back
with a win at the Ojai tournament, and an
Atlanta Journal poll rated the Cards Number
One, with Troy just behind.
And then, at the Pac-8 tournament in Los
Angeles last weekend, UCLA upset both
schools to take the conference title.
So trying to figure out which of tennis'
"Big Three" will win this year's NCAA title
involves a lot of guesswork. One thing is clear:
Stanford's tennis team wants the title. Very
much so.
Stanford has never won an official NCAA
tennis championship, and indeed hasn't won a
title in any sport since 1934, when the track
team won. That statistic pales when you take
a look at the trophy rooms (floors is a more
apt description) at USC's Heritage Hall.
View From The Dungeon
Coach Dick Gould looked worried after
spending hours in the dungeon of David Marks
Stadium Saturday watching UCLA beat his
Cardinals. Gould had to view the match from
the subterranean tunnel so he could confer
with any of his players in need of friendly
advice.
"All three teams [USC, UCLA, and
Stanford] are so evenly matched you can't

really predict the NCAA's. The way it's set
up, if you lose one player early you can lose
the whole thing."
The NCAA tournament which Stanford
wants so badly is a monstrosity — boasting
256 players. Every school in the NCAA can
enter four singles players and two doubles
teams — and many of them do.
Thus, the tourney winner is likely to be
decided, not by whether Sandy Mayer beats
Raul Ramirez in the finals, but rather by
whether Pat DuPre or Mike Machette is able
to get by some tough third round opponent
who is the big gun of some school which
doesn't have a chance to win anything.
Seedings Crucial
Obviously, the seedings will make a big
difference. The tournament may be won or
lost by the luck or lack of same each of the
"Big Three" get in the draw.
One thing is clear — either USC, or
Stanford, or UCLA will win.
After Friday's loss, one Stanford player
commented on the loss with the single
word . . . well, you know what it is.
Another observer, Alex Mayer Sr., father
of Sandy and Gene (one of Stanford's prize
recruits) accused UCLA of deliberate
alteration of its lineup in order to win.
The senior Mayer's suggestion was that
Stanford put Chico Hagey at second singles.
Hagey, of course, is recovering from injury
and would probably be beaten, but the rest of
the order — Jim Delaney at third, Rick Fisher
at fourth, etc. would win.
Gould also heard similar suggestions to the
same effect; switch DuPre and Chip Fisher to

avoid a UCLA trap . . . switch Rick Fisher and
Delaney, since Delaney, at least, would win.
And so on.
Various lineup tricks of USC and UCLA
were also noted by players and fans who made
the pilgrimage to Los Angeles, but it's
impossible to prove whether these alterations
were made for just cause or for trickery.
No Lineup Changes
Gould doesn't go along with switching
around his lineup in retaliation, or for any
other reason, and at least five times Friday
night, he told questioners, including most of
his players, that he wouldn't do so.
Gould also refused to make any excuses for
the loss to UCLA. But he seemed worried. "I
can't see any way that we could have prepared
any differently," so that Pat DuPre, Jim
Delaney, and/or Rick Fisher would have won
their third sets.
"We just hung back and let them beat us,"
Gould said.
Chip Fisher then said "it's a lot easier to
just go out and play when you're the
underdog."
Gould replied, "Well, we certainly earned
that right today ... I'd definitely say USC is
the favorite in the NCAAs now, but I'd bet on
us."
The next day, mighty USC, which looked
too good on paper to be beaten by a UCLA
lineup especially prepared for Stanford, was
beaten.
So now there is no favorite for the
NCAA's. But my bet is on the same team
Gould's is.

WOMEN NETTERS SET FOR NATIONALS—A week before USC, UCLA, and Stanford decide the
NCAA tennis championship at Princeton, New Jersey, Stanford's women's team will be vying for the
national title in Auburn, Alabama. Last Saturday the Cards won the Northern California Intercollegiate
Athletic Conference Playoffs. Stanford's first doubles team of Whitney Grant (left) and Terry Albert won
matches against UC Davis, California, and Fresno State in the playoffs, as the Cards cruised to easy
victories over all three schools.

doesn't have a chance to win anything.
Seedings Crucial
Obviously, the seedings will make a big
difference. The tournament may be won or
lost by the luck or lack of same each of the
"Big Three" get in the draw.
One thing is clear — either USC, or
Stanford, or UCLA will win.
After Friday's loss, one Stanford player
commented on the loss with the single
word . . . well, you know what it is.
Another observer, Alex Mayer Sr., father
of Sandy and Gene (one of Stanford's prize
recruits) accused UCLA of deliberate
alteration of its lineup in order to win.
The senior Mayer's suggestion was that
Stanford put Chico Hagey at second singles.
Hagey, of course, is recovering from injury
and would probably be beaten, but the rest of
the order — Jim Delaney at third, Rick Fisher
at fourth, etc. would win.
Gould also heard similar suggestions to the
same effect; switch DuPre and Chip Fisher to

avoid a UCLA trap . . . switch Rick Fisher and
Delaney, since Delaney, at least, would win.
And so on.
Various lineup tricks of USC and UCLA
were also noted by players and fans who made
the pilgrimage to Los Angeles, but it's
impossible to prove whether these alterations
were made for just cause or for trickery.
No Lineup Changes
Gould doesn't go along with switching
around his lineup in retaliation, or for any
other reason, and at least five times Friday
night, he told questioners, including most of
his players, that he wouldn't do so.
Gould also refused to make any excuses for
the loss to UCLA. But he seemed worried. "I
can't see any way that we could have prepared
any differently," so that Pat DuPre, Jim
Delaney, and/or Rick Fisher would have won
their third sets.
"We just hung back and let them beat us,"
Gould said.
Chip Fisher then said "it's a lot easier to
just go out and play when you're the
underdog."
Gould replied, "Well, we certainly earned
that right today ... I'd definitely say USC is
the favorite in the NCAAs now, but I'd bet on
us."
The next day, mighty USC, which looked
too good on paper to be beaten by a UCLA
lineup especially prepared for Stanford, was
beaten.
So now there is no favorite for the
NCAA's. But my bet is on the same team
Gould's is.

WOMEN NETTERS SET FOR NATIONALS—A week before USC, UCLA, and Stanford decide the
NCAA tennis championship at Princeton, New Jersey, Stanford's women's team will be vying for the
national title in Auburn, Alabama. Last Saturday the Cards won the Northern California Intercollegiate
Athletic Conference Playoffs. Stanford's first doubles team of Whitney Grant (left) and Terry Albert won
matches against UC Davis, California, and Fresno State in the playoffs, as the Cards cruised to easy
victories over all three schools.
Pundits from coast to coast are now trying
to decide which collegiate tennis team is the
best in the country.
For a while, the choice was easy — the top
team must be Stanford, by virtue of its win at
the National Indoor Tournament in Madison
last February.
Then USC started catching up, and
compiled the best record in the Pac-8
Southern Division. Then Stanford came back
with a win at the Ojai tournament, and an
Atlanta Journal poll rated the Cards Number
One, with Troy just behind.
And then, at the Pac-8 tournament in Los
Angeles last weekend, UCLA upset both
schools to take the conference title.
So trying to figure out which of tennis'
"Big Three" will win this year's NCAA title
involves a lot of guesswork. One thing is clear:
Stanford's tennis team wants the title. Very
much so.
Stanford has never won an official NCAA
tennis championship, and indeed hasn't won a
title in any sport since 1934, when the track
team won. That statistic pales when you take
a look at the trophy rooms (floors is a more
apt description) at USC's Heritage Hall.
View From The Dungeon
Coach Dick Gould looked worried after
spending hours in the dungeon of David Marks
Stadium Saturday watching UCLA beat his
Cardinals. Gould had to view the match from
the subterranean tunnel so he could confer
with any of his players in need of friendly
advice.
"All three teams [USC, UCLA, and
Stanford] are so evenly matched you can't

really predict the NCAA's. The way it's set
up, if you lose one player early you can lose
the whole thing."
The NCAA tournament which Stanford
wants so badly is a monstrosity — boasting
256 players. Every school in the NCAA can
enter four singles players and two doubles
teams — and many of them do.
Thus, the tourney winner is likely to be
decided, not by whether Sandy Mayer beats
Raul Ramirez in the finals, but rather by
whether Pat DuPre or Mike Machette is able
to get by some tough third round opponent
who is the big gun of some school which
doesn't have a chance to win anything.

the favorite in the NCAAs now, but I'd bet on
us."
The next day, mighty USC, which looked
too good on paper to be beaten by a UCLA
lineup especially prepared for Stanford, was
beaten.
So now there is no favorite for the
NCAA's. But my bet is on the same team
Gould's is.

WOMEN NETTERS SET FOR NATIONALS—A week before USC, UCLA, and Stanford decide the
NCAA tennis championship at Princeton, New Jersey, Stanford's women's team will be vying for the
national title in Auburn, Alabama. Last Saturday the Cards won the Northern California Intercollegiate
Athletic Conference Playoffs. Stanford's first doubles team of Whitney Grant (left) and Terry Albert won
matches against UC Davis, California, and Fresno State in the playoffs, as the Cards cruised to easy
victories over all three schools.
Pundits from coast to coast are now trying
to decide which collegiate tennis team is the
best in the country.
For a while, the choice was easy — the top
team must be Stanford, by virtue of its win at
the National Indoor Tournament in Madison
last February.
Then USC started catching up, and
compiled the best record in the Pac-8
Southern Division. Then Stanford came back
with a win at the Ojai tournament, and an
Atlanta Journal poll rated the Cards Number
One, with Troy just behind.
And then, at the Pac-8 tournament in Los
Angeles last weekend, UCLA upset both
schools to take the conference title.
So trying to figure out which of tennis'
"Big Three" will win this year's NCAA title
involves a lot of guesswork. One thing is clear:
Stanford's tennis team wants the title. Very
much so.
Stanford has never won an official NCAA
tennis championship, and indeed hasn't won a
title in any sport since 1934, when the track
team won. That statistic pales when you take
a look at the trophy rooms (floors is a more
apt description) at USC's Heritage Hall.
View From The Dungeon
Coach Dick Gould looked worried after
spending hours in the dungeon of David Marks
Stadium Saturday watching UCLA beat his
Cardinals. Gould had to view the match from
the subterranean tunnel so he could confer
with any of his players in need of friendly
advice.
"All three teams [USC, UCLA, and
Stanford] are so evenly matched you can't

really predict the NCAA's. The way it's set
up, if you lose one player early you can lose
the whole thing."
The NCAA tournament which Stanford
wants so badly is a monstrosity — boasting
256 players. Every school in the NCAA can
enter four singles players and two doubles
teams — and many of them do.
Thus, the tourney winner is likely to be
decided, not by whether Sandy Mayer beats
Raul Ramirez in the finals, but rather by
whether Pat DuPre or Mike Machette is able
to get by some tough third round opponent
who is the big gun of some school which
doesn't have a chance to win anything.
Seedings Crucial
Obviously, the seedings will make a big
difference. The tournament may be won or
lost by the luck or lack of same each of the
"Big Three" get in the draw.
One thing is clear — either USC, or
Stanford, or UCLA will win.
After Friday's loss, one Stanford player
commented on the loss with the single
word . . . well, you know what it is.
Another observer, Alex Mayer Sr., father
of Sandy and Gene (one of Stanford's prize
recruits) accused UCLA of deliberate
alteration of its lineup in order to win.
The senior Mayer's suggestion was that
Stanford put Chico Hagey at second singles.
Hagey, of course, is recovering from injury
and would probably be beaten, but the rest of
the order — Jim Delaney at third, Rick Fisher
at fourth, etc. would win.
Gould also heard similar suggestions to the
same effect; switch DuPre and Chip Fisher to

avoid a UCLA trap . . . switch Rick Fisher and
Delaney, since Delaney, at least, would win.
And so on.
Various lineup tricks of USC and UCLA
were also noted by players and fans who made
the pilgrimage to Los Angeles, but it's
impossible to prove whether these alterations
were made for just cause or for trickery.
No Lineup Changes
Gould doesn't go along with switching
around his lineup in retaliation, or for any
other reason, and at least five times Friday
night, he told questioners, including most of
his players, that he wouldn't do so.
Gould also refused to make any excuses for
the loss to UCLA. But he seemed worried. "I
can't see any way that we could have prepared
any differently," so that Pat DuPre, Jim
Delaney, and/or Rick Fisher would have won
their third sets.
"We just hung back and let them beat us,"
Gould said.
Chip Fisher then said "it's a lot easier to
just go out and play when you're the
underdog."
Gould replied, "Well, we certainly earned
that right today ... I'd definitely say USC is
the favorite in the NCAAs now, but I'd bet on
us."
The next day, mighty USC, which looked
too good on paper to be beaten by a UCLA
lineup especially prepared for Stanford, was
beaten.
So now there is no favorite for the
NCAA's. But my bet is on the same team
Gould's is.
