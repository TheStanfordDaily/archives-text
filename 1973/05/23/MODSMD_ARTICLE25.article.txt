## Aquatic Program On Rise 
### Mike Chansson 
Stanford's acquatic program will be stronger next
year with the addition of an excellent group of
incoming water polo players and swimmers, who
will be among the first swimmers to compete in
Stanford's new aquatic complex.
From what must be described as one of the best
group of high school swimmers and divers ever to
graduate in one year, the Cardinals signed three top
prospects who will hopefully mean additional points
next season.
The top recruit is Dave Fairbank from Rio
Americano High School near Sacramento. Fairbank
has clocked 20.7 and 45.5 in the 50 and 100
freestyles respectively. Both times would have
placed him in the top six at this year's NCAA
Championships.
Fairbank was a member of the 1972 Olympic
team as an alternate for the 400 meter freestyle
relay. He was also a second place finisher in this
year's AAU National Championships in the 100
freestyle.
Another outstanding prospect is Brian Roux
from Cupertino High School in Cupertino. Roux has
recorded the fastest high school 100 butterfly time
this year at 50.0. This would have scored high in the
NCAA's as well as helped move Stanford's 400
medley relay into first place. Roux was fifth in the
100 fly in this year's AAU Championships.
The third prospect is Wayne Wager, a diver from
Newport High School in Belvue, Washington. Coach
Jim Gaughran believes Wager could be one of the
top three or four divers in the Pacific-Eight next
season.
It definitely appears that Wager can defeat any
diver USC, UCLA, or Washington will have in next
year's dual meets.
Gaughran will also be welcoming four freshman
water polo standouts this fall. . From
Menlo-Atherton High School are All-Americans
Chris Dorst and Glen Proctor. Dorst is expected to

battle for the starting goalie position, while Proctor
will vie for a field position.
Tom Pureell and Drew McDonnell will also fight
for a spot in the field on next year's squad which
hopes to qualify for the NCAA Championships.
Pureell is an All-American from Bellermine High
School in San Jose, while McDonnell is from East
Bay water polo power Miramonte High School.
The most versatile prospect for next year is
Junior College transfer Rick Gebers. Gebers, from
DeAnza College in Cupertino, is an excellent
backstroker with a 53.8 clocking in the 100, and is
also one of the most outstanding water polo players
in the country.
Stanford should score more points next year in
the NCAA Swimming Championships than this year,
but may be unable to move up in the standings from
this year's 6th place finish. USC and Washington
appeared to have won the recruiting war, with the
Trojans considered almost a sure bet to unseat
Indiana for the NCAA title.
The Huskies gained three Olympic medal winners
which could move them up from last year's fifth
place spot, while Indiana and runner-up Tennessee
will be no weaker than this year. UCLA, last year's
fourth place finisher, while not fairing exceptionally
well in recruiting, regains Olympian Steve Center
and loses little off this year's squad.
In water polo the top two teams in the Pac-8
enter the NCAA Championships. The Cards must
get by defending champion UCLA, a Cal team that
is finally off probation for the Isaac Curtis affair,
and the always tough Trojans. Stanford will be
much improved over last year's squad, but may lack
the experience necessary to defeat UCLA and Cal.
Since the other aquatic powers also did well in
recruiting talent in a bumper year, it is a question
mark whether Stanford can move up in either sport.
In any case the Cards will certainly be competitive.

IS THIS MAN A SISSY?—Not too many opposing football players
have questioned Randy Poltl's masculinity, but according to Tony
Simpson, head football coach at Northshore Junior High School in
Galena Park, Tex., a "male with long hair is cute, he is pretty, and he
is sweet." Simpson said, "IT is time that American coaches stopped
allowing themselves to be personally represented bv male athletic
teams and individuals that look like females." Despite Simpson's
suggestions, it seems likely that Stanford head coach Jack Christiansen
will allow All-American candidate Poltl and his long-haired teammates
compete for the Cards in 1973.
