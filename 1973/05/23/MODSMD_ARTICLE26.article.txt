# Nilmeier Survives First U.S. Open Golf Trial
## 
### 
Stanford sophomore Conrad
Nilmeier is now only 36 holes
away from a berth in the U.S.
Open golf tournament.
Nilmeier fired rounds of 75-76
in the local qualifying at Silverado
Country Club in Napa Monday
and yesterday to earn one of 14
berths in the sectional trials June

I 4 at Mission Viejo Country Club
near Los Angeles.
A still undetermined number
will advance from the sectional
qualifying to the Open at
Oakmont Country Club in
Pittsburgh, June 14-17. Nationally
there are approximately 600
golfers still in the running for 117
spots in the Open field.
Nilmeier tied for tenth in the
83-man field at Silverado, seven
strokes behind medalist Brad
Lozares. Lozares carded rounds of
73-71 for an even par 144 total.
The 14 qualifiers included eight
professionals and six amateurs.
Nilmeier, who last weekend
tied for seventh in the Pac-8
tournament and earlier this season
won the U.S. Collegiate
Invitational, was Stanford's only
entrant in this year's Open
qualifying. Most of the other
varsity players were apparently
dissuaded by the $40 entry fee
and the necessity to miss two
more days of school after taking
off most of last week for the
Pac-B's.
If Nilmeier can survive the
sectional trials, he will join the
116 other qualifiers plus 33
exempt players in the final Open
field.
