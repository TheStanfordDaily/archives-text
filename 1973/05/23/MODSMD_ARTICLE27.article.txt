# New Schedule Approved For Pac-8 Baseball
## 
### 
The Pacific Eight Council has
approved a 26-game conference
baseball schedule for next spring
which will include eight
inter-division games for each
school.
This year the four teams in the
Northern Division (Washington,
Washington State, Oregon, and
Oregon State) and the four
Southern Division schools
(Stanford, California, USC, and
UCLA) played 18 league games,
six against each division
opponent.
The new format will maintain
the 18 game schedule within each
division and simply add a
two-game series against each team
in the opposite division. The
additional games were approved
with a provision that there be no
increase in funds budgeted for
the sport.
The council also approved next
season's basketball game of the
week television schedule. Stanford
will make two appearances on the
game of the week, on Jan. 12 at
UCLA and on Feb. 9 against
Washington State at Maples
Pavilion.
