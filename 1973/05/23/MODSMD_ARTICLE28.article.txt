# High School Coach Blasts 'Longhairs'
## 
### 
AUSTIN, TEX. - Long hair
on boys and men is the sign of a
sissy and should be banned from
American athletic fields,
according to the lead article in the
May issue of the Texas High
School Coaches Association's
magazine.
Tor.y Simpson head football
coach at Northshore Junior High
School in the Houston suburb of
Galena Park, said God made man
to dominate woman and,
therefore, meant for man to wear
short hair.
"It is time that American
coaches stopped allowing
themselves to be personally
represented by male athletic
teams and individuals that look
like females," Simpson said in his
article in "Texas Coach."
"Only in the animal world is
the male designed to be most
attractive or the prettiest — for
example, the male lion has the
mane, the male peacock has the
feathers," Simpson said. "This is
normal in the animal world only.
"However, a male with long
hair is cute, he is pretty and he is
sweet," said Simpson, who wears
his blond hair cropped short. "If
the coaches of America would
grow long hair like their athletes,
we might be able to scare the
Russian and Chinese Communists
to death with our lack of
masculinity.
"It should be pointed out here
that the only reason males are free

to look like females and their
coaches are free to permit this is
because we had real men that
were not cute, not sweet and not
pretty with courage and sense
enough to kill our enemies on
battlefields all over the globe."
Simpson said.
The article in the magazine
came within weeks of the coaches'
association's decision to ban long
hair on athletes in its annual high
school football and basketball
all-star games.
Two Houston athletes,
including the most sought-after
prep basketball player in Texas —
Eddie Owens of Houston
Wheatley — said they would
boycott the games before they
would trim back their sideburns
and long Afros.
"If common sense indicates
that long hair on a man is a
disgrace, let's stop compromising
our common sense by allowing
it," Simpson said.
He said a woman who wants a
man with long hair is not "a real
woman in her soul.
"But the American male youth
— and many not so young — wear
their hair long simply because they
know the female will like it. These
so called males are in submission
to the warped norms and
standards of females who like to
set the dress and grooming
standards for their mousey
husbands, their pantvwaist
boyfriends and feminine sons."

"It should be pointed out here
that the only reason males are free

to look like females and their
coaches are free to permit this is
because we had real men that
were not cute, not sweet and not
pretty with courage and sense
enough to kill our enemies on
battlefields all over the globe."
Simpson said.
The article in the magazine
came within weeks of the coaches'
association's decision to ban long
hair on athletes in its annual high
school football and basketball
all-star games.
Two Houston athletes,
including the most sought-after
prep basketball player in Texas —
Eddie Owens of Houston
Wheatley — said they would
boycott the games before they
would trim back their sideburns
and long Afros.
"If common sense indicates
that long hair on a man is a
disgrace, let's stop compromising
our common sense by allowing
it," Simpson said.
He said a woman who wants a
man with long hair is not "a real
woman in her soul.
"But the American male youth
— and many not so young — wear
their hair long simply because they
know the female will like it. These
so called males are in submission
to the warped norms and
standards of females who like to
set the dress and grooming
standards for their mousey
husbands, their pantvwaist
boyfriends and feminine sons."
AUSTIN, TEX. - Long hair
on boys and men is the sign of a
sissy and should be banned from
American athletic fields,
according to the lead article in the
May issue of the Texas High
School Coaches Association's
magazine.
Tor.y Simpson head football
coach at Northshore Junior High
School in the Houston suburb of
Galena Park, said God made man
to dominate woman and,
therefore, meant for man to wear
short hair.
"It is time that American
coaches stopped allowing
themselves to be personally
represented by male athletic
teams and individuals that look
like females," Simpson said in his
article in "Texas Coach."
"Only in the animal world is
the male designed to be most
attractive or the prettiest — for
example, the male lion has the
mane, the male peacock has the
feathers," Simpson said. "This is
normal in the animal world only.
"However, a male with long
hair is cute, he is pretty and he is
sweet," said Simpson, who wears
his blond hair cropped short. "If
the coaches of America would
grow long hair like their athletes,
we might be able to scare the
Russian and Chinese Communists
to death with our lack of
masculinity.
