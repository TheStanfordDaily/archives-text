Publisher Links Hughes - Watergate
LAS VEGAS, Nev. — Newspaper publisher Hank
Greenspun said yesterday that Watergate conspirators may
have been after his extensive files on Howard Hughes —
including purportedly handwritten memos from the
elusive billionaire — when they planned to burglarize his
office last year.
"I don't think they were as much interested in the
information we had on this Democratic candidate as they
were in the Hughes documents," he said at a news
conference at the Las Vegas Sun. "It's very possible that
they were anxious to recover those documents."
Watergate conspirator James W. McCord told the select
Senate committee investigating the affair Tuesday he had
been told by fellow conspirator G. Gordon Liddy that a
Hughes plane was standing by to fly the burglary team to
Latin America after the break-in.
But McCord also said the burglary never occurred,
although Greenspun says an unsuccessful attempt was
made last summer to break into his safe.
Greenspun denied statements by McCord that he had
some type of "blackmail" material that could be used
against Sen. Edmund Muskie (D-Maine). The material
purportedly could link Muskie to racketeers and could
show that he could be influenced by them, McCord said.
Greenspun admitted he had some material on Muskie,
but said it "absolutely" did not link him to organized
crime and was not of "sufficient significance to besmirch
the character of a presidential candidate."
He said the material had never been published and
declined to say what the documents contained.
He said, however, that the Hughes documents "disclose
Hughes' game plans for the election of presidents, of
senators and of governors" and "really tell a history of
Mr. Hughes' operation in Nevada . .. from the first time
he got here."
"It must have been the Hughes documents they were
after," he said, "because they were going to use a Hughes
plane to go to South America and at that time Hughes was
in Nicaragua."
Greenspun also said he was "disturbed" by the
selection of Archibald Cox as the special Watergate
prosecutor. He said Cox' brother, Max, is general counsel
for the Hughes empire.
"If Mr. Hughes is in any way linked to Watergate,"
Greenspun said, "it might be a compromising position for
Mr. Cox to be in."
Skylab Repair Flight Rehearsed
CAPE KENNEDY, Fla. — Astronauts conducted a final
rehearsal yesterday of the repair job which must work if
America's Skylab is to be saved. Workers meanwhile
prepared for countdown toward a Friday launch of the
first space salvage mission.
Working underwater in a tank at the Marshall Space
Flight Center near Huntsville, Ala., Skylab 1 astronauts
Charles Conrad Jr. and Dr. Joseph P. Kerwin practiced
erecting a sun shield designed to cool off the overheated
space station.
The third Skylab 1 crewman, Paul J. Weitz, planned an
underwater rehearsal of a possible space-walking attempt
to unjam and deploy a solar power panel which failed on
the space station.
Full-scale mockups of the Skylab space station and the
astronauts' Apollo ship are submerged in the huge tank,
where the astronauts get sensations similar to working in
weightlessness.
Workers at Cape Kennedy were preparing to start at
2:30 a.m. PDT tomorrow the countdown toward launch
of the astronauts at 6 a.m. PDT Friday.
If all goes as planned, Conrad, Kerwin and Weitz will

be drilled into orbit aboard an Apollo command module
stuffed with tools and equipment designed to rescue the
crippled $294 million Skylab from failure.
The Skylab deputy program director, John H. Disher,
said Tuesday the astronauts will carry hardware for two,
and perhaps three, alternate methods of shading the
sun-heated orbiting laboratory.
Senate Overrides Budget Veto
WASHINGTON — The Senate voted yesterday to override
President Nixon's veto of a bill requiring Senate approval
of two key White House budget men.
The vote was 62 to 22, six votes more than the
necessary two thirds.
The matter now goes to the House, where Democratic
leaders said the veto would be difficult to override. A
House vote is scheduled today.
Majority Leader Mike Mansfield said before the Senate
vote:
"This issue affects squarely the balance of the
executive and legislative branches . . . The Senate faces
one of its most severe tests on whether it is ready, willing
and able to restore itself to the status of a co-equal
branch."
Sen. Charles Percy (R-Ill.), said the President's veto
"clashes directly with his expressions of a new era of
cooperation."
The Senate had originally passed the bill requiring
confirmation of the director and deputy director of the
Office of Management and Budget by a vote of 73 to 19.
House passage had been on a vote of 229-171.
The original Senate margin was larger than the
two-thirds required for passage over a veto. The House
vote was less than two-thirds. Both branches have to vote
to override or the veto stands.
The measure, drafted by Sen. Sam Ervin (D-N.C.),
would have the immediate effect of the Senate having to
vote on confirmation of the current chief officers, Roy
Ash and Frederick Malek, respectively.
Ervin and his allies see this as one element in what they
call reasserting Congress' constitutional powers.
The budget head has become one of the most powerful
officials in government, often having a major voice as to
whether and how a department's programs are to
continue.
Guide To Sex Laws Published
SACRAMENTO — A California sex education group
introduced a book yesterday which reveals it is unlawful
to send a messenger boy to a variety theater, or for an
embalmer to curse in front of a deceased.
It also says that obscenity is excluded from a student's
freedom of expression, and that the first successful human
artificial insemination was accomplished in 1760.
Called "Sex Code of California, A Compendium," the
200-page book represents two years of research by the
Berkeley-based Public Education and Research Committee
of California.
The researchers told a news conference that it was
published for informational purposes only, and any
advocacy is completely lacking.
The book contains the exact texts of current laws,
along with definitions and history.
