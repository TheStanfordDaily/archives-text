# Nixon Denies Role In Watergate; Richardson Confirmation Delayed
## 
### 
From The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - President Nixon
conceded yesterday that there were
major efforts to cover up the
Watergate scandal. But he said any
insinuations that he was involved
misinterpret his actions.
In a statement, Nixon said that
reports about him which purport to
implicate him in the Watergate bugging
and subsequent attempted coverup are
erroneous.
Nixon said that any actions he took

reflect a legitimate concern on his
part with national security. And he
said again he will not resign.
Shortly before Nixon's statement
was issued, Atty. Gen.-designate Elliot
Richardson told the Senate Judiciary
Committee that Nixon was made
aware in late March of the break-in at
the Los Angeles office of a psychiatrist
treating Pentagon papers defendant
Daniel Ellsberg.
Testifying at the unexpected
reopening of his confirmation

hearings, Richardson told senators that
former presidential counsel John Dean
111 "informed the President, or so I've
heard, that there had been a break-in"
at the psychiatrist's office.
Richardson added, however, that
this appeared to mean that "the
President was made aware of the
Ellsberg break-in but not who was
involved or what came of it."
It was almost a month later, on
April 27, that the judge in the
Pentagon papers case announced that
the Justice Department had been
informed that Watergate conspirators
E. Howard Hunt and G. Gordon Liddy
had been involved in the burglary.
CIA Involvement
In his statement yesterday, Nixon
said that when he heard about the
Watergate break-in he initially thought
"there was a possibility of CIA
involvement in some way."
Nixon acknowledged that he
ordered his two top aides, H.R.
Haldeman and John D. Ehrlichman,
"to insure that the investigation of the
break-in not expose an unrelated
covert operation of the CIA or the
activities of the White House
Investigations Unit."
That unit, which came to be known
as the "Plumbers," was organized to
plug security leaks in the White House.
'Plumbers'
Two of the plumbers, Liddy and
Hunt, have since been convicted in the
Watergate affair, and the two other
members of the group have resigned
their administration posts.
"It was certainly not my intent, nor
my wish, that the investigation of the
Watergate break-in or of related acts
be impeded in any way," Nixon said.
The Senate Judiciary Committee
had been expected to approve
Richardson's nomination yesterday
and the reopening of the hearings was
a surprise.
Special Prosecutor
The holdup in Richardson's
confirmation delayed the official start
of work by Archibald Cox, the
Harvard law professor tabbed by
Richardson to be the special

prosecutor in the Watergate case.
Nonetheless, Cox asked that the
regular prosecutors who have been
working on the federal government's
Watergate case for nearly a year meet
with him today.
U.S. Atty. Harold H. Titus Jr. said
the meeting probably would be this
afternoon, but declined to answer any
questions, including whether the
Watergate investigation would be
halted until Cox could take over.
Daniel Ellsberg
Richardson's confirmation hearing
was apparently reopened because
Daniel Ellsberg raised with the
committee some questions about
Richardson's earlier testimony.
Ellsberg was one of the defendants in
the Pentagon papers trial, dismissed
two weeks ago.
Richardson testified yesterday, as
he has before, that he received a
telephone call on April 30 from
Ehrlichman. During the call,
Richardson said, Ehrlichman asked
him to meet with White House aide
Egil Krogh Jr. who had "worthwhile
information to give him."
Richardson said he met with Krogh
the next day, on May 1, at which time
Krogh told Richardson of his role in
the break-in at the office of the Los
Angeles psychiatrist treating Ellsberg.
Richardson said he told Krogh he
could not advise him what to do, but
said he believed the information
should be made public.
Affidavit
Krogh later filed an affidavit with
the court trying Ellsberg.
Sen. John V. Tunney (D-Calif.),
said at the hearings yesterday that
Ellsberg called his office and said
"from the dates and sequence of
events, Richardson should have known
about the break-in."
"We want to find out if Richardson
was part of the coverup," Tunney said.
Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.),
said he hoped Richardson could be
approved by the committee today
because he didn't want Senate action
on the nomination held over until
after the Memorial Day recess.

From The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - President Nixon
conceded yesterday that there were
major efforts to cover up the
Watergate scandal. But he said any
insinuations that he was involved
misinterpret his actions.
In a statement, Nixon said that
reports about him which purport to
implicate him in the Watergate bugging
and subsequent attempted coverup are
erroneous.
Nixon said that any actions he took

reflect a legitimate concern on his
part with national security. And he
said again he will not resign.
Shortly before Nixon's statement
was issued, Atty. Gen.-designate Elliot
Richardson told the Senate Judiciary
Committee that Nixon was made
aware in late March of the break-in at
the Los Angeles office of a psychiatrist
treating Pentagon papers defendant
Daniel Ellsberg.
Testifying at the unexpected
reopening of his confirmation

hearings, Richardson told senators that
former presidential counsel John Dean
111 "informed the President, or so I've
heard, that there had been a break-in"
at the psychiatrist's office.
Richardson added, however, that
this appeared to mean that "the
President was made aware of the
Ellsberg break-in but not who was
involved or what came of it."
It was almost a month later, on
April 27, that the judge in the
Pentagon papers case announced that
the Justice Department had been
informed that Watergate conspirators
E. Howard Hunt and G. Gordon Liddy
had been involved in the burglary.
CIA Involvement
In his statement yesterday, Nixon
said that when he heard about the
Watergate break-in he initially thought
"there was a possibility of CIA
involvement in some way."
Nixon acknowledged that he
ordered his two top aides, H.R.
Haldeman and John D. Ehrlichman,
"to insure that the investigation of the
break-in not expose an unrelated
covert operation of the CIA or the
activities of the White House
Investigations Unit."
That unit, which came to be known
as the "Plumbers," was organized to
plug security leaks in the White House.
'Plumbers'
Two of the plumbers, Liddy and
Hunt, have since been convicted in the
Watergate affair, and the two other
members of the group have resigned
their administration posts.
"It was certainly not my intent, nor
my wish, that the investigation of the
Watergate break-in or of related acts
be impeded in any way," Nixon said.
The Senate Judiciary Committee
had been expected to approve
Richardson's nomination yesterday
and the reopening of the hearings was
a surprise.
Special Prosecutor
The holdup in Richardson's
confirmation delayed the official start
of work by Archibald Cox, the
Harvard law professor tabbed by
Richardson to be the special

prosecutor in the Watergate case.
Nonetheless, Cox asked that the
regular prosecutors who have been
working on the federal government's
Watergate case for nearly a year meet
with him today.
U.S. Atty. Harold H. Titus Jr. said
the meeting probably would be this
afternoon, but declined to answer any
questions, including whether the
Watergate investigation would be
halted until Cox could take over.
Daniel Ellsberg
Richardson's confirmation hearing
was apparently reopened because
Daniel Ellsberg raised with the
committee some questions about
Richardson's earlier testimony.
Ellsberg was one of the defendants in
the Pentagon papers trial, dismissed
two weeks ago.
Richardson testified yesterday, as
he has before, that he received a
telephone call on April 30 from
Ehrlichman. During the call,
Richardson said, Ehrlichman asked
him to meet with White House aide
Egil Krogh Jr. who had "worthwhile
information to give him."
Richardson said he met with Krogh
the next day, on May 1, at which time
Krogh told Richardson of his role in
the break-in at the office of the Los
Angeles psychiatrist treating Ellsberg.
Richardson said he told Krogh he
could not advise him what to do, but
said he believed the information
should be made public.
Affidavit
Krogh later filed an affidavit with
the court trying Ellsberg.
Sen. John V. Tunney (D-Calif.),
said at the hearings yesterday that
Ellsberg called his office and said
"from the dates and sequence of
events, Richardson should have known
about the break-in."
"We want to find out if Richardson
was part of the coverup," Tunney said.

said he believed the information
should be made public.
Affidavit
Krogh later filed an affidavit with
the court trying Ellsberg.
Sen. John V. Tunney (D-Calif.),
said at the hearings yesterday that
Ellsberg called his office and said
"from the dates and sequence of
events, Richardson should have known
about the break-in."
"We want to find out if Richardson
was part of the coverup," Tunney said.
Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.),
said he hoped Richardson could be
approved by the committee today
because he didn't want Senate action
on the nomination held over until
after the Memorial Day recess.
