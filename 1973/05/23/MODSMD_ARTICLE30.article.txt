# Study Probes Student Lifestyles
## 
### JANIS ULEVICH 
The search for a better personal lifestyle on college
campuses has prompted the creation of a continuing study
in which about 300 Stanford undergraduates will be asked
to participate during the next several weeks.
The Student Environment Study was begun in 1970 to
determine "how you can make student life more
productive by changing the student environment,"
according to Stanford Medical School psychiatrist Alfred
Bochner, the study's director.
The study was started, Bochner said, because "students
had complained bitterly that it was hard to establish a
satisfactory personal style of life on this campus, whereas
on the overseas campuses a lifestyle was more easily
evolved."
About 1968, when the University began responding to
student demands for coeducational housing, Bochner and
his colleagues wanted to see if the changes brought about
any improvements.
'Overdose'
When people get together with new people, Bochner
said, "they seem to need a very large overdose of helpful
factors. Being together isn't enough. You've got to have
things to do together."
He attributed the success of overseas programs, which
students said were highly successful in generating
friendships, to providing many things for each group to do
together.
Bochner said that roughly half cf the college students
who have filled out questionnaires for the study reported
frequent periods of severe depression. These students were
selected to represent the various types of campus housing.
Depression and loneliness, he said, are "related to the
need for easy access to people with whom one can speak
openly. A relationship means being able to confide and
get support for one's need for self-esteem."
In addition, he said, "students often are very uncertain
about what they want from college, and feel they're not
getting what they need." Needing close friends, students
frequently find that people they counted on for help are

not sufficiently interested, he added. There is also the
barrier of competition — both academic and romantic.
"Some students feel deeply lonely and depressed," he
said, "just because the popular expectation is that they
are living in a paradise and should feel content. But
college is not a paradise and some students have feelings
af personal failure because they are not as happy as they
ire expected to be."
The Student Environment Study has also been
concerned with different living arrangements and their
affects on male-female relationships.
'Sexual Moratorium'
"We had a theory that coed living would drive many
students into a sexual moratorium," Bochner said, "that
people would not want to get too closely involved with
the opposite sex." This prediction, based on studies at
Stanford and Berkeley in the early sixties, was disproven
by more recent data, he said.
But "there really isn't such an entity as a coed house,"
said Marjorie Lozoff, a research associate at the Wright
Institute in Berkeley who is also involved in the study.
She emphasized the wide diversity even among houses of
the same type.
Bochner cited the generally increased ease of casual
interaction between males and females due to coed
housing, and the opportunity for the sexes to come into
contact "without becoming exploiters."
Availability Advantage
Lozoff, however, also noted the advantage in
availability of a wide spectrum of living choices, so that
students who want to live in single-sex residences can still
do so.
Some students, especially those who have been very
studious before coming to college, she said, "really want
to develop close relationships with members of the same
sex before they move into a more complicated
heterosexual relationship."
The questionnaire to be completed anonymously by
Stanford students is also going to seven or eight other
colleges across the country this spring.

About 1968, when the University began responding to
student demands for coeducational housing, Bochner and
his colleagues wanted to see if the changes brought about
any improvements.
'Overdose'
When people get together with new people, Bochner
said, "they seem to need a very large overdose of helpful
factors. Being together isn't enough. You've got to have
things to do together."
He attributed the success of overseas programs, which
students said were highly successful in generating
friendships, to providing many things for each group to do
together.
Bochner said that roughly half cf the college students
who have filled out questionnaires for the study reported
frequent periods of severe depression. These students were
selected to represent the various types of campus housing.
Depression and loneliness, he said, are "related to the
need for easy access to people with whom one can speak
openly. A relationship means being able to confide and
get support for one's need for self-esteem."
In addition, he said, "students often are very uncertain
about what they want from college, and feel they're not
getting what they need." Needing close friends, students
frequently find that people they counted on for help are

not sufficiently interested, he added. There is also the
barrier of competition — both academic and romantic.
"Some students feel deeply lonely and depressed," he
said, "just because the popular expectation is that they
are living in a paradise and should feel content. But
college is not a paradise and some students have feelings
af personal failure because they are not as happy as they
ire expected to be."
The Student Environment Study has also been
concerned with different living arrangements and their
affects on male-female relationships.
'Sexual Moratorium'
"We had a theory that coed living would drive many
students into a sexual moratorium," Bochner said, "that
people would not want to get too closely involved with
the opposite sex." This prediction, based on studies at
Stanford and Berkeley in the early sixties, was disproven
by more recent data, he said.
But "there really isn't such an entity as a coed house,"
said Marjorie Lozoff, a research associate at the Wright
Institute in Berkeley who is also involved in the study.
She emphasized the wide diversity even among houses of
the same type.
Bochner cited the generally increased ease of casual
interaction between males and females due to coed
housing, and the opportunity for the sexes to come into
contact "without becoming exploiters."
Availability Advantage
Lozoff, however, also noted the advantage in
availability of a wide spectrum of living choices, so that
students who want to live in single-sex residences can still
do so.
Some students, especially those who have been very
studious before coming to college, she said, "really want
to develop close relationships with members of the same
sex before they move into a more complicated
heterosexual relationship."
The questionnaire to be completed anonymously by
Stanford students is also going to seven or eight other
colleges across the country this spring.
The search for a better personal lifestyle on college
campuses has prompted the creation of a continuing study
in which about 300 Stanford undergraduates will be asked
to participate during the next several weeks.
The Student Environment Study was begun in 1970 to
determine "how you can make student life more
productive by changing the student environment,"
according to Stanford Medical School psychiatrist Alfred
Bochner, the study's director.
The study was started, Bochner said, because "students
had complained bitterly that it was hard to establish a
satisfactory personal style of life on this campus, whereas
on the overseas campuses a lifestyle was more easily
evolved."
