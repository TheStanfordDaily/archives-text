# University Censures Phi Delta Theta
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
The University has censured Phi
Delta Theta for conduct that "went
beyond the bounds of acceptable
behavior in a Stanford residence."
The censure came as a result of the
fraternity's recent rush party which
involved the raffle of a hired stripper.
Phi Delta Theta will remain in the
campus housing system during the
1973-74 academic year, but the
University has warned that it will
carefully review future activities of the
house.
Larry Horton, associate dean for
residential education, announced the
University's decision yesterday in a
letter to Phi Delt president Robert
Major. Horton said he was concerned
with whether or not the fraternity
should continue as a living group
occupying a prime campus housing
facility, and not with formal
disciplinary- action against the house
for the party.
"No living group which tends to
undermine the academic and
educational goals of the University can
be permitted to exist on campus,"
Horton wrote.
He termed the Phi Delts as one unit
of a "diverse student housing system"
in which "living groups or programs
which contribute to the educational
and intellectual vitality of the campus
should have priority for space over
groups which do not."
'Out Of Hand'
Although Horton labeled the
behavior at the party "unacceptable,"
he also noted, "The most charitable
judgment is that the party got out of
hand and that the local leadership lost
control."
However the party is only part of
the University's concern, Horton

added. He referred to other Phi Delt
incidents described in a report by
director of fraternities Norman
Robinson, including egg- and
rock-throwing battles with Sigma
Alpha Epsilon,. a neighboring
fraternity.
The report also charged the Phi
Delts with seeking "to promote itself
as precisely the type of house which
might hold a party like the one on
April 20," according to Morton.
Mills College—Beware
Robinson referred specifically to a
statement in this year's fraternity
rushbook that he felt presented a
questionable image of the Phi Delts.
The rushbook statement begins with a
quote from the Mills College
handbook urging its all-female student
body to " 'watchout... for the Phi
Delts of Stanford,' " and continues,
"This may or may not tell you what
we believe is significant about. . . Phi
Delta Theta."
Interestingly, the University
suspended the Phi Delts and ordered
the fraternity to vacate University
housing in 1966, after learning of Phi
Delt "misconduct" during an exchange
party with Mills College co-eds.
However, in 1972, the Phi Delts do
not immediately face suspension or
other severe disciplinary action.
"While a judgment of suspension
could be easily sustained on the basis
of the facts, I am persuaded that you
[Major] and the other members of Phi
Delta Theta are sincere about your
desire to improve your living group,"
Horton wrote.
He continued, "The University is
reserving judgment on the suspension
of Phi Delta Theta and will carefully
evaluate Phi Delta Theta's
performance as a living group for the

remainder of this academic year and
throughout the 1973-74 academic
year."
University Evaluation
Robinson said that the evaluation
would involve frequent meetings of
the Phi Delt president, the director of
fraternities, the resident fellow of
Cluster 1, associate dean of students
Harold Boyd, and the resident
associate of the Phi Delt house. He
described the evaluation as an attempt
to "keep abreast of what's
happening," and to prevent future
fraternity misconduct.
Robinson added that he will
maintain close contact with the
presidents and resident associates of all
fraternities. However, he said that the
University will not attempt to
chaperone the actual frat activities,
but will rely on University-employed
resident associates to attend house
functions.
Horton said the University would
consider the recommendations of the
director of fraternities and the resident

fellow before allocating a house to the
Phi Delts in the 1974-75 housing
configuration.
Major was unavailable for comment
on the fraternity's probation, but one
Phi Delt stated that the stripper
incident had not hampered this year's
rush. He said freshmen who pledged
had come to many other parties and
were interested in the house long
before the highly-publicized incident.
The Phi Delt pointed out that the
fraternity had freuqently hired
strippers for parties, and that the
incident differed from past parties
only "in that it just happened to be on
the front page of the San Jose
Mercury."
He added that the "future behavior
of the Phi Delts would be determined
by the past," and that there would be
"no specific house policy against
strippers." He also refuted charges of
questionable publicity practices and
characterized the Phi Delts as "just
good people who like to have a good
time."

performance as a living group for the

remainder of this academic year and
throughout the 1973-74 academic
year."
University Evaluation
Robinson said that the evaluation
would involve frequent meetings of
the Phi Delt president, the director of
fraternities, the resident fellow of
Cluster 1, associate dean of students
Harold Boyd, and the resident
associate of the Phi Delt house. He
described the evaluation as an attempt
to "keep abreast of what's
happening," and to prevent future
fraternity misconduct.
Robinson added that he will
maintain close contact with the
presidents and resident associates of all
fraternities. However, he said that the
University will not attempt to
chaperone the actual frat activities,
but will rely on University-employed
resident associates to attend house
functions.
Horton said the University would
consider the recommendations of the
director of fraternities and the resident

fellow before allocating a house to the
Phi Delts in the 1974-75 housing
configuration.
Major was unavailable for comment
on the fraternity's probation, but one
Phi Delt stated that the stripper
incident had not hampered this year's
rush. He said freshmen who pledged
had come to many other parties and
were interested in the house long
before the highly-publicized incident.
The Phi Delt pointed out that the
fraternity had freuqently hired
strippers for parties, and that the
incident differed from past parties
only "in that it just happened to be on
the front page of the San Jose
Mercury."
He added that the "future behavior
of the Phi Delts would be determined
by the past," and that there would be
"no specific house policy against
strippers." He also refuted charges of
questionable publicity practices and
characterized the Phi Delts as "just
good people who like to have a good
time."
The University has censured Phi
Delta Theta for conduct that "went
beyond the bounds of acceptable
behavior in a Stanford residence."
The censure came as a result of the
fraternity's recent rush party which
involved the raffle of a hired stripper.
Phi Delta Theta will remain in the
campus housing system during the
1973-74 academic year, but the
University has warned that it will
carefully review future activities of the
house.
Larry Horton, associate dean for
residential education, announced the
University's decision yesterday in a
letter to Phi Delt president Robert
Major. Horton said he was concerned
with whether or not the fraternity
should continue as a living group
occupying a prime campus housing
facility, and not with formal
disciplinary- action against the house
for the party.
"No living group which tends to
undermine the academic and
educational goals of the University can
be permitted to exist on campus,"
Horton wrote.
He termed the Phi Delts as one unit
of a "diverse student housing system"
in which "living groups or programs
which contribute to the educational
and intellectual vitality of the campus
should have priority for space over
groups which do not."
'Out Of Hand'
Although Horton labeled the
behavior at the party "unacceptable,"
he also noted, "The most charitable
judgment is that the party got out of
hand and that the local leadership lost
control."
However the party is only part of
the University's concern, Horton

added. He referred to other Phi Delt
incidents described in a report by
director of fraternities Norman
Robinson, including egg- and
rock-throwing battles with Sigma
Alpha Epsilon,. a neighboring
fraternity.
The report also charged the Phi
Delts with seeking "to promote itself
as precisely the type of house which
might hold a party like the one on
April 20," according to Morton.
Mills College—Beware
Robinson referred specifically to a
statement in this year's fraternity
rushbook that he felt presented a
questionable image of the Phi Delts.
The rushbook statement begins with a
quote from the Mills College
handbook urging its all-female student
body to " 'watchout... for the Phi
Delts of Stanford,' " and continues,
"This may or may not tell you what
we believe is significant about. . . Phi
Delta Theta."
Interestingly, the University
suspended the Phi Delts and ordered
the fraternity to vacate University
housing in 1966, after learning of Phi
Delt "misconduct" during an exchange
party with Mills College co-eds.
However, in 1972, the Phi Delts do
not immediately face suspension or
other severe disciplinary action.
"While a judgment of suspension
could be easily sustained on the basis
of the facts, I am persuaded that you
[Major] and the other members of Phi
Delta Theta are sincere about your
desire to improve your living group,"
Horton wrote.
He continued, "The University is
reserving judgment on the suspension
of Phi Delta Theta and will carefully
evaluate Phi Delta Theta's
performance as a living group for the

remainder of this academic year and
throughout the 1973-74 academic
year."

behavior at the party "unacceptable,"
he also noted, "The most charitable
judgment is that the party got out of
hand and that the local leadership lost
control."
However the party is only part of
the University's concern, Horton

added. He referred to other Phi Delt
incidents described in a report by
director of fraternities Norman
Robinson, including egg- and
rock-throwing battles with Sigma
Alpha Epsilon,. a neighboring
fraternity.
The report also charged the Phi
Delts with seeking "to promote itself
as precisely the type of house which
might hold a party like the one on
April 20," according to Morton.
Mills College—Beware
Robinson referred specifically to a
statement in this year's fraternity
rushbook that he felt presented a
questionable image of the Phi Delts.
The rushbook statement begins with a
quote from the Mills College
handbook urging its all-female student
body to " 'watchout... for the Phi
Delts of Stanford,' " and continues,
"This may or may not tell you what
we believe is significant about. . . Phi
Delta Theta."
Interestingly, the University
suspended the Phi Delts and ordered
the fraternity to vacate University
housing in 1966, after learning of Phi
Delt "misconduct" during an exchange
party with Mills College co-eds.
However, in 1972, the Phi Delts do
not immediately face suspension or
other severe disciplinary action.
"While a judgment of suspension
could be easily sustained on the basis
of the facts, I am persuaded that you
[Major] and the other members of Phi
Delta Theta are sincere about your
desire to improve your living group,"
Horton wrote.
He continued, "The University is
reserving judgment on the suspension
of Phi Delta Theta and will carefully
evaluate Phi Delta Theta's
performance as a living group for the

remainder of this academic year and
throughout the 1973-74 academic
year."
University Evaluation
Robinson said that the evaluation
would involve frequent meetings of
the Phi Delt president, the director of
fraternities, the resident fellow of
Cluster 1, associate dean of students
Harold Boyd, and the resident
associate of the Phi Delt house. He
described the evaluation as an attempt
to "keep abreast of what's
happening," and to prevent future
fraternity misconduct.
Robinson added that he will
maintain close contact with the
presidents and resident associates of all
fraternities. However, he said that the
University will not attempt to
chaperone the actual frat activities,
but will rely on University-employed
resident associates to attend house
functions.
Horton said the University would
consider the recommendations of the
director of fraternities and the resident

fellow before allocating a house to the
Phi Delts in the 1974-75 housing
configuration.
Major was unavailable for comment
on the fraternity's probation, but one
Phi Delt stated that the stripper
incident had not hampered this year's
rush. He said freshmen who pledged
had come to many other parties and
were interested in the house long
before the highly-publicized incident.
The Phi Delt pointed out that the
fraternity had freuqently hired
strippers for parties, and that the
incident differed from past parties
only "in that it just happened to be on
the front page of the San Jose
Mercury."
He added that the "future behavior
of the Phi Delts would be determined
by the past," and that there would be
"no specific house policy against
strippers." He also refuted charges of
questionable publicity practices and
characterized the Phi Delts as "just
good people who like to have a good
time."
