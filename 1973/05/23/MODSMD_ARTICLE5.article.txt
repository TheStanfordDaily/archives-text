# Harvey Resumes Job As Hospital Worker
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Children's Hospital employee Julia
Harvey has returned to her job after a
two-month layoff, but vows to
continue fighting for job security for
University employees.
Harvey, a 23-year employee,
returned to her job Monday after
Pediatrics Department Chairman Irving
Schulman, apparently under pressure,
agreed to accept funds coming from

the Children's Hospital's clinic to pay
Harvey's salary.
Harvey is working four days a week
as a research assistant to her old
supervisor, Biochemistry Prof. William
Robertson, the man who originally
suggested the new funding source for
Harvey's salary. She continues to be
eligible for University pension
benefits.
"The only hitch," Harvey said
yesterday, "is that I feel 1 should be
paid back pay from March 31," when
she was laid off, until she resumed
work May 21.
The back pay dispute remains to be
arbitrated. When the matter is settled,
Harvey said she would go to Schulman
"to bury the hatchet."
Schulman was out of town
yesterday and could not be reached
for comment.
Although her case seems near
satisfactory resolution, Harvey remains
unhappy with University procedures
which led to her being laid off.
"The question of job security for
workers who have been here a long
time has not been solved ... my case
was solved on an individual basis, in
part because I have so many friends."
These friends, according to Harvey,
included University employees, faculty
members, and medical students who
demonstrated on her behalf.
The longtime employee disagrees
with the University's claim that it
cannot offer job security to those
workers whose jobs are funded by
federal grants.
Harvey suggests that the University
and federal government set aside a
fraction of each grant to provide
security for workers whose grants are
suddenly terminated.
