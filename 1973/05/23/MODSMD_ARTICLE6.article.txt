## Campus Cooling 
### 
Everybody at Stanford except freshmen and transfer students from
small religious colleges knows that this year is very different on the
major campuses from the last few years. Unfortunately so, I think.
What has been called "the cooling of the campuses" has led to the
near-disappearance not only of civil disturbances but also of political
activism nearer the mainstream. The same things that caused
destructive riots also caused a lot of good, constructive things. The
same disenchantment that moved some people to violence moved
many more to try to make the world a better place — to canvass for
peace, to march for justice, to work in many ways for humanitarian
goals.
That's missing this year. Obviously it's an exaggeration to say that
every freshman this year is a pre-med, a Jesus freak, or both. It's
equally out of order to say that all pre-meds and Jesus freaks are
provincial, inner-directed apolitical conservatives. And pre-meds and
fundamentalist Christians do not exhaust the categories of people who
are not activists.
But there's truth in each assertion, and they help to explain why
student bodies have abdicated the role of national conscience this
year.
National Conscience
If we ever needed a national conscience, we need one now. The
long-awaited "generation of peace" is, as Daily cartoonist Gene Mater
suggested a couple of weeks ago, awfully heavy on the napalm. The
House Ways and Means Committee has postponed consideration of
the tax reform until it finishes regressive protectionist trade legislation
(more exactly, anti-trade legislation). And we have discovered
probably-unprecedented moral sickness in the highest circles of our
government — perhaps the worst of Harding and Forrestal rolled into
one.
Another thing that's been talked about a lot this year is the role
atid responsibility of the press — including college and university
newspapers. Such papers, particularly at the greatest universities, best
fulfill their responsibility to their readership when they convey the
impression that the things that are most important to students usually
happen far away from the campus.
Every major non-academic newspaper reflects the fact that the
things most important to its readers usually happen somewhere other
than the city in which the readers and the paper's staff live.
The Nation's Finest
It is no accident that the university newspapers which are
consistently acclaimed the nation's finest are those few which
demonstrate by their news priorities that the moral health of the
nation is more important — even to undergraduates — than is the
outlook for nonwhite applicants to medical schools; and that the
peregrinations of Henry Kissinger in search of peace are more vital
than the ideological battles over a Ron Jones or a William Shockley.
And while they're winning acclaim as the nation's best university
newspapers, they're also acting against provincialism and
inner-directedness and for humanitarianism and social consciousness.
Perhaps they don't make much difference — but perhaps they do. The
newspapers that emphasize things local can only throw their weight in
the opposite direction.
Hope Of The Future
It is a commencement speakers' cliche — apropos at this time of
year -- that today's students, especially at the great universities, are
the hope of the future. The last few years proved that they can be the
conscience of the present as well. But this year has shown, most
unfortunately, that they can also be "detached Americans" — the
kind of people who live in the "Little Boxes" that Malvina Reynolds
sang about.
If students at major universities turn to inner-directed and
apocalyptic religion and to fanatical competitive pursuit of academics,
who will take their place promoting morality and ethics in the
government?
If academic community newspapers don't by their news priorities
encourage students to take on the role of national conscience, who
will? Isn't that what journalistic responsibility is all about?

If academic community newspapers don't by their news priorities
encourage students to take on the role of national conscience, who
will? Isn't that what journalistic responsibility is all about?

Everybody at Stanford except freshmen and transfer students from
small religious colleges knows that this year is very different on the
major campuses from the last few years. Unfortunately so, I think.
What has been called "the cooling of the campuses" has led to the
near-disappearance not only of civil disturbances but also of political
activism nearer the mainstream. The same things that caused
destructive riots also caused a lot of good, constructive things. The
same disenchantment that moved some people to violence moved
many more to try to make the world a better place — to canvass for
peace, to march for justice, to work in many ways for humanitarian
goals.
That's missing this year. Obviously it's an exaggeration to say that
every freshman this year is a pre-med, a Jesus freak, or both. It's
equally out of order to say that all pre-meds and Jesus freaks are
provincial, inner-directed apolitical conservatives. And pre-meds and
fundamentalist Christians do not exhaust the categories of people who
are not activists.
But there's truth in each assertion, and they help to explain why
student bodies have abdicated the role of national conscience this
year.
National Conscience
If we ever needed a national conscience, we need one now. The
long-awaited "generation of peace" is, as Daily cartoonist Gene Mater
suggested a couple of weeks ago, awfully heavy on the napalm. The
House Ways and Means Committee has postponed consideration of
the tax reform until it finishes regressive protectionist trade legislation
(more exactly, anti-trade legislation). And we have discovered
probably-unprecedented moral sickness in the highest circles of our
government — perhaps the worst of Harding and Forrestal rolled into
one.
Another thing that's been talked about a lot this year is the role
atid responsibility of the press — including college and university
newspapers. Such papers, particularly at the greatest universities, best
fulfill their responsibility to their readership when they convey the
impression that the things that are most important to students usually
happen far away from the campus.
Every major non-academic newspaper reflects the fact that the
things most important to its readers usually happen somewhere other
than the city in which the readers and the paper's staff live.
The Nation's Finest
It is no accident that the university newspapers which are
consistently acclaimed the nation's finest are those few which
demonstrate by their news priorities that the moral health of the
nation is more important — even to undergraduates — than is the
outlook for nonwhite applicants to medical schools; and that the
peregrinations of Henry Kissinger in search of peace are more vital
than the ideological battles over a Ron Jones or a William Shockley.
And while they're winning acclaim as the nation's best university
newspapers, they're also acting against provincialism and
inner-directedness and for humanitarianism and social consciousness.
Perhaps they don't make much difference — but perhaps they do. The
newspapers that emphasize things local can only throw their weight in
the opposite direction.
Hope Of The Future
It is a commencement speakers' cliche — apropos at this time of
year -- that today's students, especially at the great universities, are
the hope of the future. The last few years proved that they can be the
conscience of the present as well. But this year has shown, most
unfortunately, that they can also be "detached Americans" — the
kind of people who live in the "Little Boxes" that Malvina Reynolds
sang about.
If students at major universities turn to inner-directed and
apocalyptic religion and to fanatical competitive pursuit of academics,
who will take their place promoting morality and ethics in the
government?
If academic community newspapers don't by their news priorities
encourage students to take on the role of national conscience, who
will? Isn't that what journalistic responsibility is all about?
