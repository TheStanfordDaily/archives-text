# Not The Type
## Nixon Not Guilty 
### FRANK DEALE 
The Watergate scandal is not
over. Everyday new revelations
are made, more rumors are spread
and soon, it is reasonable to
believe entire books will be
written about the subject. In this
article I will analyze briefly only
one aspect of the Watergate
scandal, the moral integrity of
President Nixon and his overriding
concern for the welfare of our
nation above and beyond his own
political ambitions. For the many
Stanford students who have not
only tried and convicted the
President of obstructing justice
but have passed moral judgement
as well it might come as a shock
that I still have faith and
confidence in Mr. Nixon.
I will not explore the
Watergate affair itself; too many
facts are still unknown. Instead I
will examine an earlier event in
American history where the facts
are in and unequivocally show
President Nixon's overriding
concern for America's welfare.
In 1960 Earl Mazo began a
series of articles in the New York
Herald Tribune that documented
evidence of vote fraud in Illinois
and Texas during the 1960
presidential election. Typical of
these reports were facts such as
one precinct where 86 individual
ballots were cast but the officially
reported vote was 148 for
Kennedy-Johnson and 24 for
Nixon Lodge. The state of Texas,
which Nixon lost by a margin of
46,000 votes clearly showed that

there were a minimum of 100,000
votes tabulated for
Kennedy-Johnson that simply
didn't exist. These were not
frauds of minor significance but
results that cost Mr. Nixon the
election.
After four of these articles had
appeared Mr. Mazo was called by
Vice-President Nixon for a
discussion. Naturally Mr. Mazo
thought that heads would roll.
Instead Mr. Nixon informed him
that he had no intention of
pursuing the matter. This was
done in view of great pressure
from the Republican party that he
pursue the matter fully. Mr.
Nixon explained the potential
international crises that could be
handled only by a President with
a united country.
At one point Mr. Mazo quotes
Mr. Nixon as saying, "Our
country can't afford the agony of
a constitutional crisis â€” and I
damn well will not be a party to
creating one just to become
President or anything else." Mr.
Nixon successfully pleaded in
having the articles discontinued.
This is not the type of man
who would engage in any ruthless
only to ensure that a
landslide victory would become
and even bigger landslide. It is
instead a man who before nation
wide television has the courage
and patriotism to say such trite
things as "God Bless America."
