# 'Differences Are Vast'
## On The UFW-Teamsters Dispute 
### 
"I'm not sure how effective a
union can be composed of
Mexican-Americans and Mexican
nationals with temporary visas.
Maybe as agriculture becomes
more sophisticated, more
mechanized, with fewer
transients, fewer green cards
(aliens), and as jobs become more
attractive to whites, then we can
build a union that can have
structure and that can negotiate
(with management) from strength

and have membership
participation." (Einar Mohn, head
of the Western Conference of
Teamsters.)
"We are constantly with farm
workers because we are one with
them, and the Teamsters are
constantly with the growers
because they are one with the
growers." (Cesar Chavez,
President of United Farm Workers
AFL-CIO.)
In March and early April, 1973

in the midst of tension over the
renewal of the UFW grape
contracts, the grape growers
reassured Cesar Chavez and the
United Farm Workers that their
hard-earned contracts would be
renewed. On April 12, 1973, 17
growers in the Coachella Valley
signed contracts with the Western
Conference of Teamsters — no
farmworkers were consulted; no
elections were held; UFW was not
informed. April 16 - HUELGA.
UFW went on strike.
On January 16, 1973 the
lettuce growers of California and
Arizona renegotiated contracts
with the Western Conference of
Teamsters again secretly without
consulting farmworkers. At that
time Cesar Chavez railed for a
strike of lettuce growers and a
boycott of Safeway and A&P
stores, major chain stores which
buy Teamster lettuce and support
the Teamsters Union.
As the growers and the
Teamsters conspire to destroy the
United Farm Workers once and
for all, the strike and boycott
grow in strength. The grape strike
has the support of over 2000 field
workers and the AFL-CIO. The
boycott has already turned away
over 10,000 people at Safeway
stores in the bay area.
One Distinction
The differences between the
UFW and the Teamsters revolve
around one primary distinction:
UFW is a union founded by
farmworkers, supported by the
farmworkers, and dedicated to the
improvement of the total living
and working conditions of
farmworkers — a union through
which a farmworker can express
his dignity as a human being. The
predominantly white Teamsters
Union, on the other hand, has
little knowledge of any little
concern for the problems of the
predominately third world field
workers — a union purportedly
representing the farmworkers but
in reality by and for the grower.
There are four fundamental
issues at stake in the UFW
struggle:
1. UFW has requested a secret
ballot election among the farm
workers to decide which, if any,
union they wish to have represent
them. The growers and Teamsters
have refused to hold those
elections;
2. UFW demands a hiring hall
system to replace the corrupt
labor contractor hiring system.
The hiring hall system consists of
an open pool of workers who are
chosen for jobs based on seniority
whereas in the labor contractor
system, one man decides who
shall work, oversees the worker,
handles the workers pay, and may
control his transportation,
housing, and food. The labor
contractor system, based as it is
on the decisions of one man, is
open to a great deal of corruption,
esp. in the form of bribes and
favoritism. The Teamsters support
the labor contractor.
Pesticide Issue
3. UFW has provisions in their
contracts for the elimination of
certain pesticides injurious to a
workers health (e.g. Monitor IV,
Phosdirin, Lannate, Parathion)
Teamster officials claim these
pesticides pose no problems.
4. The Teamsters contracts
primarily concerned with an
increase in wages and /or pay for
piece work (of course, no,
farmworker has ever seen a
Teamster contract). UFW J
however, is interested in the total,
welfare of the farmworker. UFW
chooses its leadership and makes
most intra-union decisions

Rice, Bustamonte, Bone

democratically. Farmworkers
elect ranch committees to
participate in any grievance
proceedings with growers, and all
union officials are chosen by
popular election. Furthermore,
UFW builds and operates health
clinics for farmworkers — the
third and most recent of which
opened in Sanger, California on
May 5. Also olu age homes like
Agbayan Village in Delano are
being built.
Overt Support
Since 1961 the Teamsters
Union with the overt support of
Safeway and A&P stores has tried
to subvert UFW attempts at
organizing a grass roots union to
serve farmworkers. Safeway, a
buyer of 25 percent of the
nation's lettuce, purchases mainly
Teamster lettuce. In fact, in 1970
Safeway stated flatly that they
would not cooperate with the
UFW lettuce boycott. Safeway
has a history of cooperation with
the Teamsters Union, and several
members of Safeways Board of
Directors are also owners of large
farms, e.g., Ernest Arbuckle is on
the board of the Kern Land
Company, a company which owns
much of the land which grows
nonunion grapes.
So it is — our help is needed
desperately! With it, UFW will
win! You can help in many ways:
1. BOYCOTT SAFEWAY AND
A&P
2. BOYCOTT NON-UFW
LETTUCE AND TABLE
GRAPES (ask your store manager
which type she carries)
3. HELP PICKET SAFEWAY
— We picket Thursday, Friday,
Saturday: 10 a.m.-6 p.m.
4. Donate dry goods and
canned goods for striking
farmworkers families. Help collect
it in your neighborhood.
5. If you can volunteer to work
full-time this summer (room and
board and $5/week), your skills
would be appreciated.
