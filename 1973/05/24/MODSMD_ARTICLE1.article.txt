# Middle-Aged Students Pursue Interests, Careers
## 
### JANET SANDERS 
In a sea of young faces at a lecture
class, there is often one face that is not
so young. No matter how hard this
student may try to appear
unobtrusive, most younger classmates
will immediately notice him or her.
"Sometimes I feel a little foolish,"
said Bonita Chandler, a 46-year-old
mother of two. She returned to
Stanford after a 20 year absence to
brush up on some graduate courses in
education.
Like Chandler, most students over
30 returned to school to pick up extra
credentials, often helpful in the ever
tightening job market of the 70's.
Some are only adding to previous
academic interests, but others return
to completely change their careers.
For example, Ed Fagan, a
47-year-old graduate student working
on his Ph.D. in history, practiced law
for 15 years before he decided to be a
teacher. Although he got his bachelor's
degree in history, he went to Stanford
Law School insteadof continuing study
in history.
"I'm just picking up where I left
off," said Fagan. He switched careers,
not because he did not like law, but
because "I just like teaching better."
Career Changes
Judith Dearring, a graduate student
in Spanish and Portuguese, also
returned to school to change her
career. After graduating in 1956, she
worked as a secretary for awhile.

"1 found no satisfaction in that
kind of work," explained Dearring, so
she returned to Stanford in 1965 to
work on a master's degree. She now
wants to be a teacher.
Ruth Carter, a 44-year-old
graduate-at-large, returned to Stanford
because she "needed something
constructive to do." When her two
children grew up, housekeeping did
not suffice, and she decided to become
a piano teacher.
Women Workers
As more women join the work
forces all over the country, people like
Carter are coming back to school to
start a career which they never had.

But, at the same time, the state of the
economy has tightened job markets to
a point where some people who have
had careers are now out of work.
Phil Houseman, a professor of
history for ten years, found himself
without a job last year at a time when
there was little demand for historians
in the job market. At the age of 51, he
returned to earn a school
administration credential.
With the extra credential,
Houseman feels that the possibility of
getting a job will be better when he
finishes this summer. "If the only way
I can get back on a campus is through
the administration office, then that's

what I'll do," he said.
Mary Ann Noyes, a 47-year-old
graduate student in linguistics, also
wanted to increase the range of her job
opportunities. After 8 years as a
reading teacher at the elementary
school level, she went back to school
to qualify as a teacher in a junior
college.
For diverse reasons, people over 30
are going back to school, and the
position in which they find
themselves, sometimes studying beside
people their childrens' age, is a unique
one.
More often than not, the older
student feels slightly uncomfortable in

the youthful college environment. "I
think some students don't want to talk
to me," said Noyes, mother of two
college age kids. "Some people have
had enough of mother," she laughingly
speculated.
"I don't socialize with younger
students," said Houseman. "I think it's
important to keep with your own age
group."
Besides the age differences, the
older student has more responsibilities
outside of college than his younger
classmate. Most older students have
families, and some are working
part-time in addition to going to
school.

For example, Chandler finds
studying extremely difficult with a
three year old child to take care of.
With home responsibilities taking up
more and more studying time, she had
to drop a course this quarter.
"I almost lost by cool first
quarter," said Nancy Peterson, a
35-year-old graduate student, research
assistant and mother of two young
children. "Marriage complicates
things," she said, and went on to
encourage college girls "to finish
everything they want to do before
having a family."
Complications
Although complications arise out of
these multiple responsibilities, some
older students feel that the diversity in
their lives is good. Noyes, a part-time
teacher, mother, and student said that
she enjoys "the variety of three
different worlds."
Besides having so many other things
to do, some older students have
difficulty writing examinations and
papers after a long absence from
school. "The shock of readjustment to
studying takes about two months to
get over," explained Peterson.
Despite all of these differences,
young and old students probably have
more in common than outward
appearances may convey. Echoing the
sentiments of many students 20 years
younger, Chandler said, "School is a
hassle. It was when 1 was last here and
it still is."

worked as a secretary for awhile.

"1 found no satisfaction in that
kind of work," explained Dearring, so
she returned to Stanford in 1965 to
work on a master's degree. She now
wants to be a teacher.
Ruth Carter, a 44-year-old
graduate-at-large, returned to Stanford
because she "needed something
constructive to do." When her two
children grew up, housekeeping did
not suffice, and she decided to become
a piano teacher.
Women Workers
As more women join the work
forces all over the country, people like
Carter are coming back to school to
start a career which they never had.

But, at the same time, the state of the
economy has tightened job markets to
a point where some people who have
had careers are now out of work.
Phil Houseman, a professor of
history for ten years, found himself
without a job last year at a time when
there was little demand for historians
in the job market. At the age of 51, he
returned to earn a school
administration credential.
With the extra credential,
Houseman feels that the possibility of
getting a job will be better when he
finishes this summer. "If the only way
I can get back on a campus is through
the administration office, then that's

what I'll do," he said.
Mary Ann Noyes, a 47-year-old
graduate student in linguistics, also
wanted to increase the range of her job
opportunities. After 8 years as a
reading teacher at the elementary
school level, she went back to school
to qualify as a teacher in a junior
college.
For diverse reasons, people over 30
are going back to school, and the
position in which they find
themselves, sometimes studying beside
people their childrens' age, is a unique
one.
More often than not, the older
student feels slightly uncomfortable in

the youthful college environment. "I
think some students don't want to talk
to me," said Noyes, mother of two
college age kids. "Some people have
had enough of mother," she laughingly
speculated.
"I don't socialize with younger
students," said Houseman. "I think it's
important to keep with your own age
group."
Besides the age differences, the
older student has more responsibilities
outside of college than his younger
classmate. Most older students have
families, and some are working
part-time in addition to going to
school.

For example, Chandler finds
studying extremely difficult with a
three year old child to take care of.
With home responsibilities taking up
more and more studying time, she had
to drop a course this quarter.
"I almost lost by cool first
quarter," said Nancy Peterson, a
35-year-old graduate student, research
assistant and mother of two young
children. "Marriage complicates
things," she said, and went on to
encourage college girls "to finish
everything they want to do before
having a family."
Complications
Although complications arise out of
these multiple responsibilities, some
older students feel that the diversity in
their lives is good. Noyes, a part-time
teacher, mother, and student said that
she enjoys "the variety of three
different worlds."
Besides having so many other things
to do, some older students have
difficulty writing examinations and
papers after a long absence from
school. "The shock of readjustment to
studying takes about two months to
get over," explained Peterson.
Despite all of these differences,
young and old students probably have
more in common than outward
appearances may convey. Echoing the
sentiments of many students 20 years
younger, Chandler said, "School is a
hassle. It was when 1 was last here and
it still is."
In a sea of young faces at a lecture
class, there is often one face that is not
so young. No matter how hard this
student may try to appear
unobtrusive, most younger classmates
will immediately notice him or her.
"Sometimes I feel a little foolish,"
said Bonita Chandler, a 46-year-old
mother of two. She returned to
Stanford after a 20 year absence to
brush up on some graduate courses in
education.
Like Chandler, most students over
30 returned to school to pick up extra
credentials, often helpful in the ever
tightening job market of the 70's.
Some are only adding to previous
academic interests, but others return
to completely change their careers.
For example, Ed Fagan, a
47-year-old graduate student working
on his Ph.D. in history, practiced law
for 15 years before he decided to be a
teacher. Although he got his bachelor's
degree in history, he went to Stanford
Law School insteadof continuing study
in history.
"I'm just picking up where I left
off," said Fagan. He switched careers,
not because he did not like law, but
because "I just like teaching better."

Judith Dearring, a graduate student
in Spanish and Portuguese, also
returned to school to change her
career. After graduating in 1956, she

graduate student in linguistics, also
wanted to increase the range of her job
opportunities. After 8 years as a
reading teacher at the elementary
school level, she went back to school
to qualify as a teacher in a junior
college.
For diverse reasons, people over 30
are going back to school, and the
position in which they find
themselves, sometimes studying beside
people their childrens' age, is a unique
one.
More often than not, the older
student feels slightly uncomfortable in

the youthful college environment. "I
think some students don't want to talk
to me," said Noyes, mother of two
college age kids. "Some people have
had enough of mother," she laughingly
speculated.
"I don't socialize with younger
students," said Houseman. "I think it's
important to keep with your own age
group."
Besides the age differences, the
older student has more responsibilities
outside of college than his younger
classmate. Most older students have
families, and some are working
part-time in addition to going to
school.

For example, Chandler finds
studying extremely difficult with a
three year old child to take care of.
With home responsibilities taking up
more and more studying time, she had
to drop a course this quarter.
"I almost lost by cool first
quarter," said Nancy Peterson, a
35-year-old graduate student, research
assistant and mother of two young
children. "Marriage complicates
things," she said, and went on to
encourage college girls "to finish
everything they want to do before
having a family."
Complications
Although complications arise out of
these multiple responsibilities, some
older students feel that the diversity in
their lives is good. Noyes, a part-time
teacher, mother, and student said that
she enjoys "the variety of three
different worlds."
Besides having so many other things
to do, some older students have
difficulty writing examinations and
papers after a long absence from
school. "The shock of readjustment to
studying takes about two months to
get over," explained Peterson.
Despite all of these differences,
young and old students probably have
more in common than outward
appearances may convey. Echoing the
sentiments of many students 20 years
younger, Chandler said, "School is a
hassle. It was when 1 was last here and
it still is."
In a sea of young faces at a lecture
class, there is often one face that is not
so young. No matter how hard this
student may try to appear
unobtrusive, most younger classmates
will immediately notice him or her.
"Sometimes I feel a little foolish,"
said Bonita Chandler, a 46-year-old
mother of two. She returned to
Stanford after a 20 year absence to
brush up on some graduate courses in
education.
Like Chandler, most students over
30 returned to school to pick up extra
credentials, often helpful in the ever
tightening job market of the 70's.
Some are only adding to previous
academic interests, but others return
to completely change their careers.
For example, Ed Fagan, a
47-year-old graduate student working
on his Ph.D. in history, practiced law
for 15 years before he decided to be a
teacher. Although he got his bachelor's
degree in history, he went to Stanford
Law School insteadof continuing study
in history.
"I'm just picking up where I left
off," said Fagan. He switched careers,
not because he did not like law, but
because "I just like teaching better."
Career Changes
Judith Dearring, a graduate student
in Spanish and Portuguese, also
returned to school to change her
career. After graduating in 1956, she
worked as a secretary for awhile.

"1 found no satisfaction in that
kind of work," explained Dearring, so
she returned to Stanford in 1965 to
work on a master's degree. She now
wants to be a teacher.
Ruth Carter, a 44-year-old
graduate-at-large, returned to Stanford
because she "needed something
constructive to do." When her two
children grew up, housekeeping did
not suffice, and she decided to become
a piano teacher.
Women Workers
As more women join the work
forces all over the country, people like
Carter are coming back to school to
start a career which they never had.

But, at the same time, the state of the
economy has tightened job markets to
a point where some people who have
had careers are now out of work.
Phil Houseman, a professor of
history for ten years, found himself
without a job last year at a time when
there was little demand for historians
in the job market. At the age of 51, he
returned to earn a school
administration credential.
With the extra credential,
Houseman feels that the possibility of
getting a job will be better when he
finishes this summer. "If the only way
I can get back on a campus is through
the administration office, then that's

what I'll do," he said.
Mary Ann Noyes, a 47-year-old
graduate student in linguistics, also
wanted to increase the range of her job
opportunities. After 8 years as a
reading teacher at the elementary
school level, she went back to school
to qualify as a teacher in a junior
