# World Crisis In Oil?
## Successful Cartel At Work 
### 
Bill Evers, Joe Kalt

Anyone who drives an
automobile has noticed that
gasoline prices are going up.
Anyone who reads a magazine has
difficulty avoiding the
advertisements by oil companies
proclaiming a new petroleum
shortage What is behind all this
•I'icussion of a world energy crisis,
especially in oil?
The industry and the various
governments involved want the
public (the victimized consumers)
to believe that the oil shortage is
somehow a natural or market
phenomenon, related to a surge in
demand and massive depletion in
the world's resources.
On the contrary, according to
M.I.T. economist M.A. Adelman
writing in the winter 1972-73
issue of Foreign Policy, the oil
shortage is not the result of a
surge in demand or of increased,
long-run scarcity of oil. Adelman
cites empirical evidence showing
that demand has not accelerated
significantly in recent years. He
also notes that new discoveries
and potential production are not
falling behind consumption.
Monopolization
The oil shortage and the

consequent high prices are instead
the result of successful
cartelization, i.e., monopolization,
of the oil industry. This industry
cartelization has been made
possible by the united
governments of the oil producing
countries and by the cooperation
of the U.S. State Department.
In the 19605, although the
major companies in the
international oil industry desired
to obtain for themselves the
profitable rewards of a cartel
arrangement, they were unable to
do so because of intense price
competition among themselves.
Beginning in 1970, the oil
producing nations grouped
together in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) came to agree upon a
program of unified action. They
proceeded to require higher tax
payments from the oil companies.
Oligopoly
In Adelman's words, "the
multinational companies
producing oil were amenable to
these tax * increases
because . . . they fhave used the
occasion of tax increases] to
increase their margins and return
on investment in both crude and
products."
This new taxing arrangement
has enabled the companies to
stabilize and rationalize the
industry as an informally
organized oligopoly.
Anytime a few companies want
to enjoy a monopoly situation
together, it is crucial that they
prevent price competition. It is
also necessary that they devise
some schema for price changes
which is both predictable and
readily reveals attempts at
chiseling.
Price-Fixing
Without such a schema, all
cartels tend to fall apart because
there are inherent incentives for
each individual member secretly
to cut his price and thus increase
his share of the market. This price
competition leads to the
dissolution of the cartel.
Since 1970, the OPEC has, in
effect, served as the administrative
board for the oil industry cartel.
As Adelman describes it, "All
price-fixing cartels must either
control output or detect and
prevent individual price
reductions, which would erode
the price down toward the
competitive level. The OPEC tax
system accomplishes this simply
and efficiently. Every important
OPEC nation publishes its taxes
per barrel; they are a public
record, impossible to falsify
much. Outright suppression would
be a confession of cheating. Once
the taxes are set by concerted
company-government action, the
price floor of taxes-plus-cost is
safe." This provides the system of
visible pricing focal points and
predictable price behavior which
is vital to all cartels.
Declining Previously
Before the OPEC's
arrangement prevailed, the price
for oil was declining, moving away
from the price that would obtain
under cartel conditions. With the
new arrangement, while the
companies have incurred costs in
the form of increased taxes, the
benefits which they have realized
from their long-sought cartel far
outweight these costs.
It is not surprising, therefore,
to find the companies approving
of the OPEC actions. This
symbiotic relationship of the
producing countries and the
companies is recognized by
industry leaders like the head of
Shell as well as by the
secretary-general of the OPEC.
They both speak in terms of
"marrriage" and the absence of
any basic conflict of interests.
Additional pressure which

enforces the maintenance of an
unnaturally high price for oil
comes from the many European
governments with investments in
nationalized coal industries. They
wish to see the price of oil high in
order to increase their revenue
from coal sales. A possible other
source of pressure sustaining
governmental support of high oil
prices is the export industry in the
United States which stands to
benefit from the increased
revenues flowing into the oil
producing countries.
Large Excess
Rather than being pressed by
short supply and rising demand,
the oil industry, as Adelman

points out, is in fact characterized
by large excess productive
capacity. On a competitive
market, such a situation would
imply downward pressure on
prices as producers attempted to
gain revenue from their idle
resources.
The fact that oil prices are now
rapidly increasing as productive
resources remain unused is
indicative of the existence of an
effective cartel — a cartel which
has been made possible by
collusion between industry and
governments.
