## Black Doctors 
### 
Donald it. Hearn

It began Friday, May 18, the
evening of — as a group of
tomorrow's Black doctors
congregrated in the lounge of
Bechtel's Internationa) Center.
The planning had been done — the
people contacted, the wine
bought, the food prepared, and
even the arrangement of table and
chairs, all long before — as these
future doctors watched, talked,
and listened. As they did they
became educated as to what it
takes to get in and complete
medical school — without losing
one's identity.
The educators were people like
Dr. Ewart Brown-Habor General
Hospital in Torrance, California,
Dr. Wilbert Jordan-Beth-Israel
Hospital in Boston,
Massachusettes, Dr. Samuel
Kountz of Downstate Medical
Center in Brooklyn, New York, and
of course the keynote speaker Dr.
Frances Welsing-Howard
University, Department of
Psychiatry, and so an idea became
so much more — a reality.
Under the auspices of Brenda
Young the dinner not only
succeeded in producing a socially
relaxed atmosphere — but even
the food was good. As the wine
poured and the forks lifted, the
doctors of today and those yet to
be shared the commoness of
enjoyment.
Enlightening Day
The dinner was only the
prelude to a most enlightening
day — Saturday — as the people
began pouring into Bishop
Auditorium around 9:30 a.m. for
registration. The topic for the day
was, "BLACK HEALTH CARE-
A COMMON GOAL." After
registration the general
introductory assembly began —
led by Woody Myers, whose
leadership expertise
complemented the planning of
Joe Brewster in making this affair
possible — and was followed by a
panel discussion.
The panel consisted of Myers,
Steve Brooks-Harvard Medical
Student, Dr. Ewart Brown, Dr.
Andrew Thomas-Project-75, and
Dr. George Tolbert of H.E.W. Just
prior to the panel dicussion a
comical satire by Reggie Ishman
and Larry Terry got basic
important ideas across and
displayed how well organized the
day was to be. After Dr. Welsing's
keynote address — that conveyed
why Black Health-Care must exist
— lunch, afternoon workshops
and a conference wrap-up
rounded out the rest of the day.
During lunch the pre-med
students, who came from all ovev

California, had the rare
opportunity to talk, receive
information from, and make some
sort of impression on the
university admission
representatives.
The universities represented
were Meharry, Howard, Boston,
Tufts, Harvard, Pennsylvania, U.C.
— San Francisco, and of course
Stanford — represented by Dr.
Ernie Lowe. The workshops
highlighted the day as
representatives from the before
mentioned universities and
hospitals speculated and expressed
the diverse roles of the Black
Doctor. The participating
students, who came from San Jose
State, Berkeley, Irvine,
Northridge, U.S.F., Stanford, and
son on — left with so much more
than what they had come with.
Feeling of Accomplishment
Yet, by participating, they
made the conference a success and
also left with a feeling of
accomplishment. The University,
hospital, H.E.W., and Project 75
representatives all were throughly
impressed — the first major event
presented by the Black
Pre-Medical Society at Stanford,
must be reviewed as a complete
success.
The conference was made
financially possible through grants
obtianed from Project 75, a
service of the National Medical
Association, Office of Health
Affairs, United States Office of
Economic Opportunity, and
Community Services, Department
of Health, Education, and
Welfare. Having sincerely,
benefitted from the experience of
such a conference, we as members
of the Black Pre-Medical Society,
hope we will be able to contribute
in our own wav to a common goal
BLACK HEALTH CARE.

It began Friday, May 18, the
evening of — as a group of
tomorrow's Black doctors
congregrated in the lounge of
Bechtel's Internationa) Center.
The planning had been done — the
people contacted, the wine
bought, the food prepared, and
even the arrangement of table and
chairs, all long before — as these
future doctors watched, talked,
and listened. As they did they
became educated as to what it
takes to get in and complete
medical school — without losing
one's identity.
The educators were people like
Dr. Ewart Brown-Habor General
Hospital in Torrance, California,
Dr. Wilbert Jordan-Beth-Israel
Hospital in Boston,
Massachusettes, Dr. Samuel
Kountz of Downstate Medical
Center in Brooklyn, New York, and
of course the keynote speaker Dr.
Frances Welsing-Howard
University, Department of
Psychiatry, and so an idea became
so much more — a reality.
Under the auspices of Brenda
Young the dinner not only
succeeded in producing a socially
relaxed atmosphere — but even
the food was good. As the wine
poured and the forks lifted, the
doctors of today and those yet to
be shared the commoness of
enjoyment.
Enlightening Day
The dinner was only the
prelude to a most enlightening
day — Saturday — as the people
began pouring into Bishop
Auditorium around 9:30 a.m. for
registration. The topic for the day
was, "BLACK HEALTH CARE-
A COMMON GOAL." After
registration the general
introductory assembly began —
led by Woody Myers, whose
leadership expertise
complemented the planning of
Joe Brewster in making this affair
possible — and was followed by a
panel discussion.
The panel consisted of Myers,
Steve Brooks-Harvard Medical
Student, Dr. Ewart Brown, Dr.
Andrew Thomas-Project-75, and
Dr. George Tolbert of H.E.W. Just
prior to the panel dicussion a
comical satire by Reggie Ishman
and Larry Terry got basic
important ideas across and
displayed how well organized the
day was to be. After Dr. Welsing's
keynote address — that conveyed
why Black Health-Care must exist
— lunch, afternoon workshops
and a conference wrap-up
rounded out the rest of the day.
During lunch the pre-med
students, who came from all ovev

California, had the rare
opportunity to talk, receive
information from, and make some
sort of impression on the
university admission
representatives.
The universities represented
were Meharry, Howard, Boston,
Tufts, Harvard, Pennsylvania, U.C.
— San Francisco, and of course
Stanford — represented by Dr.
Ernie Lowe. The workshops
highlighted the day as
representatives from the before
mentioned universities and
hospitals speculated and expressed
the diverse roles of the Black
Doctor. The participating
students, who came from San Jose
State, Berkeley, Irvine,
Northridge, U.S.F., Stanford, and
son on — left with so much more
than what they had come with.
Feeling of Accomplishment
Yet, by participating, they
made the conference a success and
also left with a feeling of
accomplishment. The University,
hospital, H.E.W., and Project 75
representatives all were throughly
impressed — the first major event
presented by the Black
Pre-Medical Society at Stanford,
must be reviewed as a complete
success.
The conference was made
financially possible through grants
obtianed from Project 75, a
service of the National Medical
Association, Office of Health
Affairs, United States Office of
Economic Opportunity, and
Community Services, Department
of Health, Education, and
Welfare. Having sincerely,
benefitted from the experience of
such a conference, we as members
of the Black Pre-Medical Society,
hope we will be able to contribute
in our own wav to a common goal
BLACK HEALTH CARE.
