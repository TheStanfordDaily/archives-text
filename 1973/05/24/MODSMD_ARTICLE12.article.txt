Reading's Election
Editor:
The impression of Oakland's
Mayor John Reading left by your
article (Daily, May 16) about his
victory over Bobby Seale is that
of a rather benign, tolerant,
though conservative, person. He is
quoted as referring to Seale as a
"fine young American" and to
Scale's campaign workers (who
encompassed, incidentally a far
broader spectrum in age and color
than simply young blacks) in
similarly honeyed phrases.
The campaign on behalf of
Reading could not, however, resist
the opportunity to raise the issues
of race and class in their baser
forms. A campaign mailing prior
to the April 17 primary warned
that "the Radicals will all be
voting on April 17, will you?"
Such a question was clearly
designed to evoke the spectre of
Oakland becoming another
Berkeley, however unlikely that
prospect and despite obvious
dissimilarities between the two
cities. Another mailing prior to
the run-off election warned that if
Reading's supporters did not vote
as hevily in this election as in the
primary, "Bobby SEale could be
Oakland's next mayor. Think
about it."
The implications were as clear
as the color of Bobby Seale's skin.
The voter was expected to fill in
the implied blanks with his own
attitudes and prejudices. All the
visceral feelings about race and
class, fear and hatred, black and
radical were unmistakably to be
elicited. Such were the scare
tactics against what Reading
himself characterized as Seale's
"gentleman's campaign."

I am offended that more men
haven't responded seriously to the
issues raised by the public auction
of a woman for purposes of
prostitution at a fraternity party.
Men represent about 2/3 of the
Stanford community and I know
many disapprove of the sale of
human beings. Private enterprise is
not the question, nor is private
sexual behavior. The question is
what constitutes the limits of
acceptable behavior at this
university. In a time of sensitivity
to minority and women's rights, a
grave offense has been committed.
Why hasn't the president of the
fraternity resigned? Have any
members resigned? Why hasn't the
almost all male Daily interviewed
its officers and followed this story
more thoroughly?
Women's liberation has freed
many women of the fear of
speaking out. The masculine
mystique is so powerful that men
are unable to condemn their peers
for fear of being thought
unmanly.

It is indeed sad to me that a
person interested in participating
in a university organization is
forced to represent anyone or
thing other than himself.
It was not the too distant past
in which the Stanford Military
Marching Band was forced to step
high and look shiny because they
represented the University.
Somehow, the band has managed
to free itself from this notion and
now it represents individuals
interested in good rtiusic and fun.
Although I personally do not
agree with the opinions or views
on women of the "Dollies" I
would indeed be shortsighted in
judging them representative of
anything other than themselves, as
Lynn Robinson and the 15
Durand members suggest I might
("it is sad to think that they in
any way represent Stanford
Women.")
I believe it is essential not to
judge these 16 narrow-minded
people as representative of the
openness to individual opinions of
Stanford students.

Although I personally do not
agree with the opinions or views
on women of the "Dollies" I
would indeed be shortsighted in
judging them representative of
anything other than themselves, as
Lynn Robinson and the 15
Durand members suggest I might
("it is sad to think that they in
any way represent Stanford
Women.")
I believe it is essential not to
judge these 16 narrow-minded
people as representative of the
openness to individual opinions of
Stanford students.
Paul DeYoung
Reading's Election
Editor:
The impression of Oakland's
Mayor John Reading left by your
article (Daily, May 16) about his
victory over Bobby Seale is that
of a rather benign, tolerant,
though conservative, person. He is
quoted as referring to Seale as a
"fine young American" and to
Scale's campaign workers (who
encompassed, incidentally a far
broader spectrum in age and color
than simply young blacks) in
similarly honeyed phrases.
The campaign on behalf of
Reading could not, however, resist
the opportunity to raise the issues
of race and class in their baser
forms. A campaign mailing prior
to the April 17 primary warned
that "the Radicals will all be
voting on April 17, will you?"
Such a question was clearly
designed to evoke the spectre of
Oakland becoming another
Berkeley, however unlikely that
prospect and despite obvious
dissimilarities between the two
cities. Another mailing prior to
the run-off election warned that if
Reading's supporters did not vote
as hevily in this election as in the
primary, "Bobby SEale could be
Oakland's next mayor. Think
about it."
The implications were as clear
as the color of Bobby Seale's skin.
The voter was expected to fill in
the implied blanks with his own
attitudes and prejudices. All the
visceral feelings about race and
class, fear and hatred, black and
radical were unmistakably to be
elicited. Such were the scare
tactics against what Reading
himself characterized as Seale's
"gentleman's campaign."

I am offended that more men
haven't responded seriously to the
issues raised by the public auction
of a woman for purposes of
prostitution at a fraternity party.
Men represent about 2/3 of the
Stanford community and I know
many disapprove of the sale of
human beings. Private enterprise is
not the question, nor is private
sexual behavior. The question is
what constitutes the limits of
acceptable behavior at this
university. In a time of sensitivity
to minority and women's rights, a
grave offense has been committed.
Why hasn't the president of the
fraternity resigned? Have any
members resigned? Why hasn't the
almost all male Daily interviewed
its officers and followed this story
more thoroughly?
Women's liberation has freed
many women of the fear of
speaking out. The masculine
mystique is so powerful that men
are unable to condemn their peers
for fear of being thought
unmanly.

It is indeed sad to me that a
person interested in participating
in a university organization is
forced to represent anyone or
thing other than himself.
It was not the too distant past
in which the Stanford Military
Marching Band was forced to step
high and look shiny because they
represented the University.
Somehow, the band has managed
to free itself from this notion and
now it represents individuals
interested in good rtiusic and fun.
