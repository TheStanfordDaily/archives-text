# Minority Enrollment Slightly Up
## 
### 
During the past five years, black,
Chicano, and Native American enrollment
here has grown to more than nine percent
of the student body.
While most have been admitted on a
preferential basis, they have generally
fulfilled the University's initial judgment
that they are capable of performing
satisfactorily in the curriculum as it stands,
say University spokesmen.
Students from these minority groups
complete their academic programs on
about the same schedule and at about the
same rate as other Stanford students. Their
attrition (or "drop out") rates are similar.
But these general signs of progress
should not be taken as the basis for
"destructive complacency" by the
University, according to Robert M.
Rosenzweig, vice provost and adviser to
President Lyman.
In a newly published report
it—• i -.Mmj- ■■.mm, j - rurr - - rrai" - - mmw ' J—r. ;

summarizing information requested on a
University-wide basis by Lyman early this
year, Rosenzweig said 9.9 percent of the
undergraduate student body last fall were
from these three minority groups.
The total included 294 blacks, 296
Chicanos, and 47 Native Americans among
6,413 undergraduates. The number of
black students declined from 1971-72,
with Chicanos becoming slightly more
numerous for the first time.
In the graduate and professional
schools, minority enrollment grew to 428,
an increase of almost 25 percent over
1971-72. Blacks outnumbered Chicanos
239 to 164, but Chicano enrollment
appears to be growing at a faster rate,
Rosenzweig noted.
"This does not appear to be the product
of a conscious policy. It may be a
temporary phenomenon or it may be more
lasting, reflecting the fact that Chicanos

outnumber blacks in California and the
Southwest."
In the past five years, more than $5.7
million has been devoted to financial aid
grants to minority undergraduates,
Rosenzweig said. Of this total, more than
$4.4 million came from University funds.
Each year since 1968 has seen an increase
over the previous year in these
expenditures.
"In every school, the per capita grant to
minority students was substantially higher
than for other students, and a higher
proportion of total financial need to
minority students is met by grants than is
the case with other students," he noted.
"It is clear that minority students
uniformly are perceived as having greater
financial need and as needing more grant as
opposed to loan funds. The scarcity of
grant funds, combined with the growing
number of minority students needing aid,

may be causing a change in the latter
pattern.
"The Graduate School of Business and
the School of Medicine, for example,
report a turn to loans to meet a higher
proportion of student need. That is
probably also true in those graduate
departments with the smallest number of
fellowship dollars.
"The size of the debt incurred by some
minority students by the time their
education is completed is widely seen as an
especially acute form of a phenomenon
increasingly characteristic of all students."
So far as evaluating the progress of
various groups at Stanford is concerned, he
adds, the University has no means of
measuring academic performance "that is
much more refined than the simple
notations that a student remains in good
standing, is no longer enrolled, or has
graduated."

outnumber blacks in California and the
Southwest."
In the past five years, more than $5.7
million has been devoted to financial aid
grants to minority undergraduates,
Rosenzweig said. Of this total, more than
$4.4 million came from University funds.
Each year since 1968 has seen an increase
over the previous year in these
expenditures.
"In every school, the per capita grant to
minority students was substantially higher
than for other students, and a higher
proportion of total financial need to
minority students is met by grants than is
the case with other students," he noted.
"It is clear that minority students
uniformly are perceived as having greater
financial need and as needing more grant as
opposed to loan funds. The scarcity of
grant funds, combined with the growing
number of minority students needing aid,

may be causing a change in the latter
pattern.
"The Graduate School of Business and
the School of Medicine, for example,
report a turn to loans to meet a higher
proportion of student need. That is
probably also true in those graduate
departments with the smallest number of
fellowship dollars.
"The size of the debt incurred by some
minority students by the time their
education is completed is widely seen as an
especially acute form of a phenomenon
increasingly characteristic of all students."
So far as evaluating the progress of
various groups at Stanford is concerned, he
adds, the University has no means of
measuring academic performance "that is
much more refined than the simple
notations that a student remains in good
standing, is no longer enrolled, or has
graduated."
During the past five years, black,
Chicano, and Native American enrollment
here has grown to more than nine percent
of the student body.
While most have been admitted on a
preferential basis, they have generally
fulfilled the University's initial judgment
that they are capable of performing
satisfactorily in the curriculum as it stands,
say University spokesmen.
Students from these minority groups
complete their academic programs on
about the same schedule and at about the
same rate as other Stanford students. Their
attrition (or "drop out") rates are similar.
But these general signs of progress
should not be taken as the basis for
"destructive complacency" by the
University, according to Robert M.
Rosenzweig, vice provost and adviser to
President Lyman.
In a newly published report

summarizing information requested on a
University-wide basis by Lyman early this
year, Rosenzweig said 9.9 percent of the
undergraduate student body last fall were
from these three minority groups.
The total included 294 blacks, 296
Chicanos, and 47 Native Americans among
6,413 undergraduates. The number of
black students declined from 1971-72,
with Chicanos becoming slightly more
numerous for the first time.
In the graduate and professional
schools, minority enrollment grew to 428,
an increase of almost 25 percent over
1971-72. Blacks outnumbered Chicanos
239 to 164, but Chicano enrollment
appears to be growing at a faster rate,
Rosenzweig noted.
"This does not appear to be the product
of a conscious policy. It may be a
temporary phenomenon or it may be more
lasting, reflecting the fact that Chicanos

outnumber blacks in California and the
Southwest."
