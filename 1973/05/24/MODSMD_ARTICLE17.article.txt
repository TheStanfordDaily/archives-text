The United States will face new challenges in the
field of foreign relations in the next few years.
Today the Daily is presenting three articles on some
of those problems. This is not a complete treatment
of all the major problems the U.S. must deal with,
and space limitations do not allow the three very
complex areas dealt with here to be covered in any

depth. The hope is that these articles will spur the
readers to further study and thought.
As in the regular opinions pages, the views
expressed here are solely those of the authors.
Robert C. North's article was inadvertently printed
three weeks ago, but to assure it the widest
exposure, the Daily is again printing it today as
originally scheduled. â€”L.H.
