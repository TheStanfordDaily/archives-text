# Energy Crisis
## Resource Scarcity 
### 
Robert C. North

The international configuration
of power and tendencies toward
international conflict and violence
are often affected in important
ways by differences, from country
to country, in levels and rates of
change in population, technology,
and access to critical resources.
Uneven rates of growth of
these dimensions contribute to
political economic and sometimes
military penetration of
low-capability societies by
high-capability countries and to
acute international competitions,
crises, and wars.
In the world today, population
increases combined with rapid
technological advances in the
industrialized countries are
escalating demands for primary
energy, critical metals, and other
basic resources. Absolute
scarcities are not needed to
exacerbate competitions and
conflicts — only rising demands
and higher costs of exploration,
extraction, transportation, and
refining.
Questions
The influence of population,
technology, and access to
resources raises troublesome
questions about the control of
international conflicts and the
avoidance of war. It suggests that
mediation, conciliation,
adjudication, the development of
international law, and other
alternatives to war are not in
themselves likely to be sufficient
for the preservation of peace.
On the contrary, the basic
"causes" of war seem to reside in
the uneven development of
national dimensions and attributes
over which, in the past, national
and international political
processes have had very little
control. One might conjure up a
somewhat oversimplified picture
of a dozen nuclear missile
establishments zeroed in on each
other with the trip wires attached
to a multivariate threshold
involving differentials of
population, technology, and
access to resources and markets.
This suggests the need for a
whole new set of worldwide
investigations into the nature of
these inequalities and uneven
distributions of resources and
capabilities. It suggests that the
environment, resource allocation,
the characteristics of different

ecologies, and the "sovereign"
state as a basic unit of political
and economic organization are
important starting places for
research not only into the causes
of war, but also for designing and
putting into effect a more
peaceful and effective alternative
international system.
Drain
In many respects the industrial
superpowers are like huge vacuum
cleaners sucking up resources
from all over the world in order to
maintain productivity, military
capabilities, and consumer
demands. In 1960, with six
percent of the world's population,
the U.S. consumed approximately
30 percent of the world's total
production of minerals. If the
whole world had been
industrialized to the same level,
the annual drain in 1960 would be
about five times what it actually
was.
At current population,
technological, and consumption
growth rates in the U.S.,
northwestern Europe, the
U.S.S.R., Japan, and a few other
industrialized regions, there is
likely to be sharper competition
for resources over the next 50
years unless a more rational and
just distribution can be achieved.
Differentials in world and
regional consumption of fuel
energy offer a rough indicator of
the spread between
high-capability and low-capability
countries:
PRIMARY ENERGY, 1970
Per Capita Consumption
(In kilograms of coal equivalent)
United States 11.144
Sweden 6,311
U.S.S.R 4,445
Japan 3,210
China 505
Burundi 9
These sparse data are a stark
indicator of some of the world's
current realities that are often
overlooked by citizens of the
more industrialized and affluent
societies. Short of careful
husbanding and selective
application of resources,
enlightened negotiations and
agreements among producer and
competing consumer countries,
and wholly new levels of
international cooperation and
pooling of interests, there are high

risks of acute competitions among
high consumption countries and
also between consumer countries
and resource-rich but
technology-poor countries of the
Third World.

The international configuration
of power and tendencies toward
international conflict and violence
are often affected in important
ways by differences, from country
to country, in levels and rates of
change in population, technology,
and access to critical resources.
Uneven rates of growth of
these dimensions contribute to
political economic and sometimes
military penetration of
low-capability societies by
high-capability countries and to
acute international competitions,
crises, and wars.
In the world today, population
increases combined with rapid
technological advances in the
industrialized countries are
escalating demands for primary
energy, critical metals, and other
basic resources. Absolute
scarcities are not needed to
exacerbate competitions and
conflicts — only rising demands
and higher costs of exploration,
extraction, transportation, and
refining.
Questions
The influence of population,
technology, and access to
resources raises troublesome
questions about the control of
international conflicts and the
avoidance of war. It suggests that
mediation, conciliation,
adjudication, the development of
international law, and other
alternatives to war are not in
themselves likely to be sufficient
for the preservation of peace.
On the contrary, the basic
"causes" of war seem to reside in
the uneven development of
national dimensions and attributes
over which, in the past, national
and international political
processes have had very little
control. One might conjure up a
somewhat oversimplified picture
of a dozen nuclear missile
establishments zeroed in on each
other with the trip wires attached
to a multivariate threshold
involving differentials of
population, technology, and
access to resources and markets.
This suggests the need for a
whole new set of worldwide
investigations into the nature of
these inequalities and uneven
distributions of resources and
capabilities. It suggests that the
environment, resource allocation,
the characteristics of different

ecologies, and the "sovereign"
state as a basic unit of political
and economic organization are
important starting places for
research not only into the causes
of war, but also for designing and
putting into effect a more
peaceful and effective alternative
international system.
Drain
In many respects the industrial
superpowers are like huge vacuum
cleaners sucking up resources
from all over the world in order to
maintain productivity, military
capabilities, and consumer
demands. In 1960, with six
percent of the world's population,
the U.S. consumed approximately
30 percent of the world's total
production of minerals. If the
whole world had been
industrialized to the same level,
the annual drain in 1960 would be
about five times what it actually
was.
At current population,
technological, and consumption
growth rates in the U.S.,
northwestern Europe, the
U.S.S.R., Japan, and a few other
industrialized regions, there is
likely to be sharper competition
for resources over the next 50
years unless a more rational and
just distribution can be achieved.
Differentials in world and
regional consumption of fuel
energy offer a rough indicator of
the spread between
high-capability and low-capability
countries:
