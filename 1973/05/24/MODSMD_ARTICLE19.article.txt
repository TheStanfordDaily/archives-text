# Contradictions Abound
## U.S. Policies Limit Arms Control 
### 
Forrest R. Frank

The Nixon Administration's
accomplishments in the field of
arms control and disarmament
during the last four years are
difficult to evaluate in light of
concurrent and subsequent events.
The new international agreements
conferences, contacts, and
perceptions of national security
problems have been contradicted
by negotiating strategies, military
programs and military assistance
policies. The net result suggests
that if arms control agreements
are reached in the next four years,
it will be because of their
domestic political utility and not
because they reduce the
likelihood of war.
During the period 1969-1972,
the Nixon Administration
concluded the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Sea
Bed Treaty, the Bacteriological
Warfare Convention, the ABM
Limitation Treaty and the Interim
Agreement on Offensive Strategic
Weapons. At the same time,
according to the Center for
Defense Information, the number
of nuclear weapons in the U.S.
strategic arsenal grew from 4054
to 6120, and will grow further to
9075 by the year 1972.
Military expenditures rose
from $41.3 billion to $55.3
billion (constant 1963 dollars),
reflecting increased procurement
for both strategic and general
purpose forces. The expenditures
for military research and
development also rose. Such
expenditures are expected to rise

further in the future from $7.1
billion to $9.2 billion (constant
1972 dollars) according to TTie
Budget of the United States for
FY 1974 (these figures include
military research conducted by
the Atomic Energy Commission).
Yet, the President recently
announced that the 14 million
dollar budget of the Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency had
been cut by more than 6 million

4 Band-Aid 9 Agreements

dollars, and that the Office of
Science and Technology and the
President's Science Advisorary
Committee were eliminated
outright. These three
organizations are generally
acknowledged as having been
effective arms control advocates.
The Administration indicated
its changed perception of the
world by adopting the vocabulary
of strategic "sufficiency,"
replacing Nixon's 1968 campaign
call for strategic "superiority"
vis-a-vis the Soviet Union. The
change in perception of the world
is further manifested by U.S.
participation in several new
conferences and its continued

active participation in the
standing United Nations
sponsored conference on arms
control. Most recently, however,
the Administration has ceased
using the term "sufficiency" and
is pushing for accelerated
development of the B-l manned
bomber, the TRIDENT submarine
missile system, and a variety of
other new strategic systems
outlined in Secretary of Defense

Richardson's Posture Statement
of April 10, 1973.
The Administration's favorite
negotiating tactic of linking
progress in arms control to
progress in other areas of
international negotiation has had
serious debilitating consequences.
The tactic, as applied to the 1968
Non-Proliferation Treaty, whose
ratification was held up until
1970, broke the momentum
towards arms control, weakened
the positions of arms control
advocates, and raised serious
doubts about U.S. intentions with
regard to its commitment to
pursue negotiations in good faith.

The linking of the beginning of
the Strategic Arms Limitation
Talks (SALT) to Soviet assistance
in settling the Middle East and
Indochina conflicts resulted in a
delay. This delay permitted the
bureaucratic and domestic
interests which rely on strategic
weaponry to be nourished to a
point that all the first round of
SALT could do was a mild
pruning job.
Let us briefly examine the
current international arms control
negotiations and where they are
likely to lead.
SALT II: The second round of
SALT has three main objectives.
The first is the conclusion of a
permanent treaty limiting
offensive strategic weapons. As
the Interim Agreement did not
cover manned bombers, it is likely
that the permanent treaty will
permit each side to mix a force of
bombers, land-based
intercontinental ballistic missiles,
and submarine launched ballistic
missiles. Ideally, the SALT II
treaty will contain further limits
on both the quality and quantity
of weapons, just as the ABM
Treaty froze the current ABM
technology as well as numbers.
Thus, a Permanent Treaty,
qualitative constraints, and
quantitive reduction can be
regarded as the most optimistic
outcome at this point.
The European Security
Conference: This conference
meeting in Helsinki is the
brainchild of the Soviet Union. Its

primary function is to legitimize
the East German Government.
The West has decided to attempt
to open the closed Eastern
European societies to some
extent, and thus far, the Warsaw
Pact nations have agreed to this
agenda item. Likely outcomes
include: a permanent consultative
body; provisions for the exchange
of scholars, journalists, and more
tourists; and exchanges of military
information either through
mutual reporting or the stationing
of military observers on opposite
sides of the "Iron Curtain."
The Conference on Mutual and
Balanced Force Reductions: This
conference is attempting to cut
the Gordian knot of military
balance between NATO and the
Warsaw Pact. Among the
asymmetries to be considered are
geographical distances over which
troops on each side would be
pulled back; numbers of armored
units on each side; numbers of
aircraft with the capability of
delivering nuclear weapons to the
homeland of the Soviet Union,
France and Great Britain; and the
distribution of forces presently
deployed by both sides in Europe.
Little progress can be expected
until the issue of U.S. forward
based nuclear weapons systems is
resolved at SALT II or the U.S.
Congress simply cuts off funds for
maintenance < r U.S. forces in
Europe. Should the latter occur,
Western negotiating power would
be handicapped if the Soviets
were sincere in their desire for an
agreement. If they could care less
about an agreement, there is
legitimate question about the
expense of a "bargaining chip,"
especially when the other side has
no intention of bargaining.
The Conference of the
Committee on Disarmament: This
on-going U.N. sponsored
Conference in Geneva will
consider three specific topics: the
limitation of chemical warfare; a
comprehensive nuclear test ban
covering underground testing in
addition to atmospheric,
underwater, and exo-atmospheric
tests; and an agreement banning
environmental warfare. The
control of conventional arms
transfers from advanced nations
to Third World Countries will
probably be discussed, but little
progress can be expected. The
Administration's promise to ship
arms embodied in the so-called
"Nixon Doctrine" will work to
inhibit agreement on limitation of
conventional arms transfers.
The past four years have seen
several spectacular agreements,
many of which are quite
significant in the field of arms
control. However, as long as most
Congressional constituencies are
dependent on the Pentagon's
budget in one form or another, all
arms control can do is apply
"band-aid" agreements in the
hope that if a war should occur, it
won't escalate into a nuclear
holacaust. As long as the
Administration can make political
capital of international
agreements, they will come. But it
is really up to the Congress to
eliminate the contradictions in the
Administration's arms control
policies and move from arms
control to arms reduction.
