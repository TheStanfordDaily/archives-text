# First Impressions Favorable
## Tresidder Workers Acclaim Tout de Suite 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Tresidder food service workers
haven't had time to do more than just
meet representatives from Tout de
Suite, Inc. (TDS), but their first
impressions of their new employers are
favorable.
TDS will officially manage all
Tresidder food operations beginning
June 18, when it will take over the
financially-troubled cafeteria from the
University. Representatives from the
company, including TDS President Dr.
Stewart Ritchie 111 and new TMU food
manager John Shaw, have been
meeting with the 55 career food
service workers, all of whom have the
option of continuing work with TDS.
Food service worker Agnes
Anderson said that "it's too early to

make any decisions, but the
impression I got was that they [TDS]
were very nice." Anderson related that
when a TDS representative saw her
lifting a heavy bucket, he took the
bucket from her, saying "you don't
have to carry that."
Another employee, Lee Crawford,
echoed the sentiment that the TDS
managers seem to be good persons to
work for. She added her feeling that
"it was either that [get a private
company to run Tresidder food
services] or closing."
Impressions
Three other workers interviewed
yesterday also had positive first
impressions of their new employers.
One cook did express worry over loss
of University "pension and seniority

benefits."
Asked about this, Ritchie said "the
benefits we give will be at least equal
to those of the University and I think
they may be quite a bit better."
Ritchie specifically cited TDS' medical
plan as having a higher limit of
coverage than does the University.
Ritchie also stated that there are no
plans to lay off any of the 55 career
employees now working at the food
service, and added that workers will
not be subject to any pay cuts.
Increasing Student Employment
TDS also plans to increase student
employment. "We want to provide
additional employment for students at
Tresidder. As we increase sales, our
primary source of additional labor
which will be needed will be
students," Ritchie said.
He added that he thought the
policy of TMU general manager
Gordon Starr of hiring students
whenever career workers retire would
be continued.
Ritchie also vowed to "look hard at
rates of pay where students are pulling
down substantially less than career
workers for the same jobs."
The hiring of new student workers
is, of course, largely dependent on
increasing sales. Ritchie outlined
several "ploys" by which this could be
accomplished, and noted that TDS has
taken over six other food services
which were losing money "and always
increased sales by anywhere from 50
to 300 percent."
Optimism
While optimistic statements from
employers and employees alike fill the
air, there is one serious topic for
discussion — the status of United
Stanford Employees.
Tresidder's food service workers
will be members of USE's bargaining
unit if the entire unit (some 1600
University employees) votes to allow
USE to represent it on June 6.
However, on June 18, the food
service workers will no longer be
employed by the University. "At that
point of time," said University Staff
Legal Counsel Doug Barton, "it's up to
Tout de Suite to accept a position vis a
vis the employees."
Unionization?
Ritchie said Tout de Suite doesn't
care "whichever way our employees
decide," on the question of
unionization.
USE President Glenda Jones
strongly protested Tout de Suite's
taking over the Tresidder operation.
She read a prepared statement saying
"USE recognizes that the timing was
deliberately* prepared on the
University's part ... two weeks prior
to voting."

Jones questioned Tout de Suite's
retirement benefits saying that it
apparently does not cover workers
who are employed less than nine years.
She also asked "Why couldn't the
workers decide whether they want the
continued benefits of being Stanford
employees?"
However, on the key question of
whether USE will be allowed to be the
official representative of Tout de Suite
employees working at Tresidder, Jones
could only say "that will have to be
worked out with USE."

"it was either that [get a private
company to run Tresidder food
services] or closing."
Impressions
Three other workers interviewed
yesterday also had positive first
impressions of their new employers.
One cook did express worry over loss
of University "pension and seniority

benefits."
Asked about this, Ritchie said "the
benefits we give will be at least equal
to those of the University and I think
they may be quite a bit better."
Ritchie specifically cited TDS' medical
plan as having a higher limit of
coverage than does the University.
Ritchie also stated that there are no
plans to lay off any of the 55 career
employees now working at the food
service, and added that workers will
not be subject to any pay cuts.
Increasing Student Employment
TDS also plans to increase student
employment. "We want to provide
additional employment for students at
Tresidder. As we increase sales, our
primary source of additional labor
which will be needed will be
students," Ritchie said.
He added that he thought the
policy of TMU general manager
Gordon Starr of hiring students
whenever career workers retire would
be continued.
Ritchie also vowed to "look hard at
rates of pay where students are pulling
down substantially less than career
workers for the same jobs."
The hiring of new student workers
is, of course, largely dependent on
increasing sales. Ritchie outlined
several "ploys" by which this could be
accomplished, and noted that TDS has
taken over six other food services
which were losing money "and always
increased sales by anywhere from 50
to 300 percent."
Optimism
While optimistic statements from
employers and employees alike fill the
air, there is one serious topic for
discussion — the status of United
Stanford Employees.
Tresidder's food service workers
will be members of USE's bargaining
unit if the entire unit (some 1600
University employees) votes to allow
USE to represent it on June 6.
However, on June 18, the food
service workers will no longer be
employed by the University. "At that
point of time," said University Staff
Legal Counsel Doug Barton, "it's up to
Tout de Suite to accept a position vis a
vis the employees."
Unionization?
Ritchie said Tout de Suite doesn't
care "whichever way our employees
decide," on the question of
unionization.
USE President Glenda Jones
strongly protested Tout de Suite's
taking over the Tresidder operation.
She read a prepared statement saying
"USE recognizes that the timing was
deliberately* prepared on the
University's part ... two weeks prior
to voting."

Jones questioned Tout de Suite's
retirement benefits saying that it
apparently does not cover workers
who are employed less than nine years.
She also asked "Why couldn't the
workers decide whether they want the
continued benefits of being Stanford
employees?"
However, on the key question of
whether USE will be allowed to be the
official representative of Tout de Suite
employees working at Tresidder, Jones
could only say "that will have to be
worked out with USE."

Tresidder food service workers
haven't had time to do more than just
meet representatives from Tout de
Suite, Inc. (TDS), but their first
impressions of their new employers are
favorable.
TDS will officially manage all
Tresidder food operations beginning
June 18, when it will take over the
financially-troubled cafeteria from the
University. Representatives from the
company, including TDS President Dr.
Stewart Ritchie 111 and new TMU food
manager John Shaw, have been
meeting with the 55 career food
service workers, all of whom have the
option of continuing work with TDS.
Food service worker Agnes
Anderson said that "it's too early to

make any decisions, but the
impression I got was that they [TDS]
were very nice." Anderson related that
when a TDS representative saw her
lifting a heavy bucket, he took the
bucket from her, saying "you don't
have to carry that."
Another employee, Lee Crawford,
echoed the sentiment that the TDS
managers seem to be good persons to
work for. She added her feeling that
"it was either that [get a private
company to run Tresidder food
services] or closing."
