# Need For New Relationship
## U.S. Should Welcome Latin Diversity 
### 
Robert A. Packenham

Political and economic predictions are always
risky and often foolish. Yet they can also be
interesting and occasionally they are even useful. In
this spirit, and emphasizing that both the United
States and Latin America are short names for very
complex realities, I will hazard some guesses about
trends in Latin America in the seventies, and about
the effects of North American actions on those
trends.
Although Latin America is the richest part of the
Third World, it is still mostly a poor region whose
wealth is more unequally distributed than any other
major world area. In the future, therefore, the drive
for better standards of living will continue. In some,
though not enough, countries, economic
development will be defined in ways sensitive to
local circumstances rather than in terms of concepts
"imported" without adaptation from the most
technologically-advanced societies.
A closely-related and enormously important issue
is the maldistribution of resources within Latin
American societies and the linkages between these
inequities and foreign actors. The United States is
not the only cause of the social ills that beset Latin
America. However, the United States is the most
powerful actor in an international context that
affects Latin American societies in various ways.
North American political and social liberalism
sometimes erodes the rigidity and elitism of
traditional social structures. At the same time,
however, political and economic liberalism
emanating from the United States generates and
perpetuates various kinds of inequalities by its
intense political anti-radicalism, its stress on
productivity and aggregate growth more than
redistribution, and its reliance on classical formulas
in international economic relations. In these and
other ways, both intended and unintended but all
consequential, North American public and private
groups reinforce and sustain those forces working to
maintain the socioeconomic status quo.

The size and impact of U.S. bilateral aid
programs have both been fairly small in recent
years. They will probably remain so. This trend will
not usually harm developmental efforts much; in
some instances it may help them.
Other U.S. economic instruments, however, will
be much more consequential in the region. These
include semi-public lending agencies like the

Errors Of Omission

Export-Import and Inter-American Development
Banks, multilateral lenders (heavily influenced by
the U.S.) like the World Bank, trade, direct private
investment, and huge multinational corporations.
Whether these agencies and processes will have good
or bad effects on Latin American interests will
depend mainly on the steps Latin American
governments take to defend themselves.
If any force is likely to be more prominent than
the drive for economic development in the years
ahead it is nationalism. Nearly all Latin American
governments are nationalistic, though the content of
that nationalism differs.
One manifestation of nationalism is the urge to
reduce dependence on the United States.
Dependence results mainly from disparities in power:
weak states tend to be dependent on powerful ones.
Hence dependency is reduced by strengthening
government capabilities, increasing economic
resources, and fostering national pride and

identification. Although contradictions abound, in
general it is precisely these processes which are
proceeding apace in most of the major Latin
American countries today.
Some degree of dependence — if not on the U.S.,
then on Europe, Japan, or the U.S.S.R. — will be
inevitable for all countries. Even the weakest
countries, however, have a certain freedom of action
(more in politics than economics), as Cuba and
Chile, to say nothing of Panama, have recently
reminded us. Within limits, the extent of
dependence will reflect not only international
realities but also internal choices of Latin American
actors.
The Nixon administration has de-emphasized
Latin American affairs. Although Nixon's "low
profile" was adopted partly for the wrong reasons
(less because it was seen as desirable than because
no other course was seen as feasible), at least the
U.S. has recently avoided such acts of high
statesmanship as the Bay of Pigs and the Dominican
intervention. For example, although it has applied
severe economic sanctions in Chile, and despite the
worst efforts of the ITT, the Nixon administration
has avoided major clashes over expropriations in
Bolivia, Peru, and Chile.
The Nixon administration has avoided the worst
errors of commission; it has, however, made errors
of omission. For instance, it has failed to respond
adequately to Latin American complaints about
such problems as aid with strings, tariffs and quotas,
and debt servicing costs. Nor has it done anything
significant to work out a constructive new
relationship with Latin American countries.
Consequently the United States may find itself
increasingly isolated politically and diplomatically
in the hemisphere in the future.
A final major issue area is national political
systems. Latin American politics will continue to be
quite diverse in form, process, and outputs. In the
aggregate they will probably become a little more

radical, participatory, and organizationally strong
than in the past, but traditions of conservatism,
elitism, and institutional weakness will persist and
limit change.
Although genuine revolutions- profound, rapid,
usually violent sociopolitical upheaval? — will
perhaps occur in a few countries, it seems doubtful
many of them will occur all at once. The United
States will continue to oppose radical politics in the
region. It will be more successful in this effort than
in any attempts it might make to promote liberal
constitutionalism. However, where radical
movements are popularly-based the United States
will find it increasingly difficult and costly to stop
them.
In the face of such trends, what should North
Americans do? Change comes hard in Latin
America; when it occurs, the United States should
rejoice and get out of the way, not oppose it. If the
pace of change is too fast, Latin Americans will slow
it; there is little empirical or moral justification for
North Americans to do so.
We should worry less about the size of aid
programs in the region, although this question might
sometimes be important, and more about the
broader question of how to transfer resources
constructively and equitably from rich to poor
countries. Finally, North Americans of all political
persuasions should learn to live with and appreciate
a diversity of political and economic forms in the
region.
The foregoing suggestions say more about what
to avoid than what to achieve. If we can learn to
avoid mistakes, however, perhaps we can also learn,
eventually, how to participate in a genuinely
positive relationship with Latin American countries.
If we do not learn how to do this, some of the more
apocalyptic visions of the future of Latin American
and the United States may come to pass.

though not enough, countries, economic
development will be defined in ways sensitive to
local circumstances rather than in terms of concepts
"imported" without adaptation from the most
technologically-advanced societies.
A closely-related and enormously important issue
is the maldistribution of resources within Latin
American societies and the linkages between these
inequities and foreign actors. The United States is
not the only cause of the social ills that beset Latin
America. However, the United States is the most
powerful actor in an international context that
affects Latin American societies in various ways.
North American political and social liberalism
sometimes erodes the rigidity and elitism of
traditional social structures. At the same time,
however, political and economic liberalism
emanating from the United States generates and
perpetuates various kinds of inequalities by its
intense political anti-radicalism, its stress on
productivity and aggregate growth more than
redistribution, and its reliance on classical formulas
in international economic relations. In these and
other ways, both intended and unintended but all
consequential, North American public and private
groups reinforce and sustain those forces working to
maintain the socioeconomic status quo.

The size and impact of U.S. bilateral aid
programs have both been fairly small in recent
years. They will probably remain so. This trend will
not usually harm developmental efforts much; in
some instances it may help them.
Other U.S. economic instruments, however, will
be much more consequential in the region. These
include semi-public lending agencies like the

Errors Of Omission

Export-Import and Inter-American Development
Banks, multilateral lenders (heavily influenced by
the U.S.) like the World Bank, trade, direct private
investment, and huge multinational corporations.
Whether these agencies and processes will have good
or bad effects on Latin American interests will
depend mainly on the steps Latin American
governments take to defend themselves.
If any force is likely to be more prominent than
the drive for economic development in the years
ahead it is nationalism. Nearly all Latin American
governments are nationalistic, though the content of
that nationalism differs.
One manifestation of nationalism is the urge to
reduce dependence on the United States.
Dependence results mainly from disparities in power:
weak states tend to be dependent on powerful ones.
Hence dependency is reduced by strengthening
government capabilities, increasing economic
resources, and fostering national pride and

identification. Although contradictions abound, in
general it is precisely these processes which are
proceeding apace in most of the major Latin
American countries today.
Some degree of dependence — if not on the U.S.,
then on Europe, Japan, or the U.S.S.R. — will be
inevitable for all countries. Even the weakest
countries, however, have a certain freedom of action
(more in politics than economics), as Cuba and
Chile, to say nothing of Panama, have recently
reminded us. Within limits, the extent of
dependence will reflect not only international
realities but also internal choices of Latin American
actors.
The Nixon administration has de-emphasized
Latin American affairs. Although Nixon's "low
profile" was adopted partly for the wrong reasons
(less because it was seen as desirable than because
no other course was seen as feasible), at least the
U.S. has recently avoided such acts of high
statesmanship as the Bay of Pigs and the Dominican
intervention. For example, although it has applied
severe economic sanctions in Chile, and despite the
worst efforts of the ITT, the Nixon administration
has avoided major clashes over expropriations in
Bolivia, Peru, and Chile.
The Nixon administration has avoided the worst
errors of commission; it has, however, made errors
of omission. For instance, it has failed to respond
adequately to Latin American complaints about
such problems as aid with strings, tariffs and quotas,
and debt servicing costs. Nor has it done anything
significant to work out a constructive new
relationship with Latin American countries.
Consequently the United States may find itself
increasingly isolated politically and diplomatically
in the hemisphere in the future.
A final major issue area is national political
systems. Latin American politics will continue to be
quite diverse in form, process, and outputs. In the
aggregate they will probably become a little more

radical, participatory, and organizationally strong
than in the past, but traditions of conservatism,
elitism, and institutional weakness will persist and
limit change.
Although genuine revolutions- profound, rapid,
usually violent sociopolitical upheaval? — will
perhaps occur in a few countries, it seems doubtful
many of them will occur all at once. The United
States will continue to oppose radical politics in the
region. It will be more successful in this effort than
in any attempts it might make to promote liberal
constitutionalism. However, where radical
movements are popularly-based the United States
will find it increasingly difficult and costly to stop
them.
In the face of such trends, what should North
Americans do? Change comes hard in Latin
America; when it occurs, the United States should
rejoice and get out of the way, not oppose it. If the
pace of change is too fast, Latin Americans will slow
it; there is little empirical or moral justification for
North Americans to do so.
We should worry less about the size of aid
programs in the region, although this question might
sometimes be important, and more about the
broader question of how to transfer resources
constructively and equitably from rich to poor
countries. Finally, North Americans of all political
persuasions should learn to live with and appreciate
a diversity of political and economic forms in the
region.
The foregoing suggestions say more about what
to avoid than what to achieve. If we can learn to
avoid mistakes, however, perhaps we can also learn,
eventually, how to participate in a genuinely
positive relationship with Latin American countries.
If we do not learn how to do this, some of the more
apocalyptic visions of the future of Latin American
and the United States may come to pass.

traditional social structures. At the same time,
however, political and economic liberalism
emanating from the United States generates and
perpetuates various kinds of inequalities by its
intense political anti-radicalism, its stress on
productivity and aggregate growth more than
redistribution, and its reliance on classical formulas
in international economic relations. In these and
other ways, both intended and unintended but all
consequential, North American public and private
groups reinforce and sustain those forces working to
maintain the socioeconomic status quo.

The size and impact of U.S. bilateral aid
programs have both been fairly small in recent
years. They will probably remain so. This trend will
not usually harm developmental efforts much; in
some instances it may help them.
Other U.S. economic instruments, however, will
be much more consequential in the region. These
include semi-public lending agencies like the

Errors Of Omission

Export-Import and Inter-American Development
Banks, multilateral lenders (heavily influenced by
the U.S.) like the World Bank, trade, direct private
investment, and huge multinational corporations.
Whether these agencies and processes will have good
or bad effects on Latin American interests will
depend mainly on the steps Latin American
governments take to defend themselves.
If any force is likely to be more prominent than
the drive for economic development in the years
ahead it is nationalism. Nearly all Latin American
governments are nationalistic, though the content of
that nationalism differs.
One manifestation of nationalism is the urge to
reduce dependence on the United States.
Dependence results mainly from disparities in power:
weak states tend to be dependent on powerful ones.
Hence dependency is reduced by strengthening
government capabilities, increasing economic
resources, and fostering national pride and

identification. Although contradictions abound, in
general it is precisely these processes which are
proceeding apace in most of the major Latin
American countries today.
Some degree of dependence — if not on the U.S.,
then on Europe, Japan, or the U.S.S.R. — will be
inevitable for all countries. Even the weakest
countries, however, have a certain freedom of action
(more in politics than economics), as Cuba and
Chile, to say nothing of Panama, have recently
reminded us. Within limits, the extent of
dependence will reflect not only international
realities but also internal choices of Latin American
actors.
The Nixon administration has de-emphasized
Latin American affairs. Although Nixon's "low
profile" was adopted partly for the wrong reasons
(less because it was seen as desirable than because
no other course was seen as feasible), at least the
U.S. has recently avoided such acts of high
statesmanship as the Bay of Pigs and the Dominican
intervention. For example, although it has applied
severe economic sanctions in Chile, and despite the
worst efforts of the ITT, the Nixon administration
has avoided major clashes over expropriations in
Bolivia, Peru, and Chile.
The Nixon administration has avoided the worst
errors of commission; it has, however, made errors
of omission. For instance, it has failed to respond
adequately to Latin American complaints about
such problems as aid with strings, tariffs and quotas,
and debt servicing costs. Nor has it done anything
significant to work out a constructive new
relationship with Latin American countries.
Consequently the United States may find itself
increasingly isolated politically and diplomatically
in the hemisphere in the future.
A final major issue area is national political
systems. Latin American politics will continue to be
quite diverse in form, process, and outputs. In the
aggregate they will probably become a little more

radical, participatory, and organizationally strong
than in the past, but traditions of conservatism,
elitism, and institutional weakness will persist and
limit change.
Although genuine revolutions- profound, rapid,
usually violent sociopolitical upheaval? — will
perhaps occur in a few countries, it seems doubtful
many of them will occur all at once. The United
States will continue to oppose radical politics in the
region. It will be more successful in this effort than
in any attempts it might make to promote liberal
constitutionalism. However, where radical
movements are popularly-based the United States
will find it increasingly difficult and costly to stop
them.
In the face of such trends, what should North
Americans do? Change comes hard in Latin
America; when it occurs, the United States should
rejoice and get out of the way, not oppose it. If the
pace of change is too fast, Latin Americans will slow
it; there is little empirical or moral justification for
North Americans to do so.
We should worry less about the size of aid
programs in the region, although this question might
sometimes be important, and more about the
broader question of how to transfer resources
constructively and equitably from rich to poor
countries. Finally, North Americans of all political
persuasions should learn to live with and appreciate
a diversity of political and economic forms in the
region.
The foregoing suggestions say more about what
to avoid than what to achieve. If we can learn to
avoid mistakes, however, perhaps we can also learn,
eventually, how to participate in a genuinely
positive relationship with Latin American countries.
If we do not learn how to do this, some of the more
apocalyptic visions of the future of Latin American
and the United States may come to pass.

Political and economic predictions are always
risky and often foolish. Yet they can also be
interesting and occasionally they are even useful. In
this spirit, and emphasizing that both the United
States and Latin America are short names for very
complex realities, I will hazard some guesses about
trends in Latin America in the seventies, and about
the effects of North American actions on those
trends.
Although Latin America is the richest part of the
Third World, it is still mostly a poor region whose
wealth is more unequally distributed than any other
major world area. In the future, therefore, the drive
for better standards of living will continue. In some,
though not enough, countries, economic
development will be defined in ways sensitive to
local circumstances rather than in terms of concepts
"imported" without adaptation from the most
technologically-advanced societies.
A closely-related and enormously important issue
is the maldistribution of resources within Latin
American societies and the linkages between these
inequities and foreign actors. The United States is
not the only cause of the social ills that beset Latin
America. However, the United States is the most
powerful actor in an international context that
affects Latin American societies in various ways.
North American political and social liberalism
sometimes erodes the rigidity and elitism of
traditional social structures. At the same time,
however, political and economic liberalism
emanating from the United States generates and
perpetuates various kinds of inequalities by its
intense political anti-radicalism, its stress on
