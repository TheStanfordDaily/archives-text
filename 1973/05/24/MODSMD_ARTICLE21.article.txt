# Simon Blends 'Old And New'
## 
### ROD KOON 
At San Francisco's Opera
House last Sunday night, Paul
Simon gave a superb professional
performance, leaving the
near-capacity crowd with a taste
of his old songs, a little bit of
gospel music, a glimpse at South
American music, and a desire to
hear much, much more. The
concert contained a perfect blend
of the old and the new Simon,
complete from his roots of
influence to his new paths of
direction.
"Me and Julio Down by the
Schoolyard" was the first song
Simon performed, and it
flawless down to the last whistled
note. The crowd loved it,
responding with tremendous
applause. Simon simply smiled
and humbly commented, "That
was nothing." He followed with
"Wear Your Body Down," which
is also on his first solo album.
Again, the sound was strong,
clear, and polished.
Throughout the concert, his
comments to the audience helped
bring the audience and performer
closer together. His songs as well
as his spontaneous comments
were humorous and entertaining.
After his first two songs he
announced, "I'm going to do
some new songs tonight. Most
audiences don't like to hear new
songs... but I'm going to play
them anyway."
The enthusiastic crowd
applauded, then he added,
"There's no need for applause." If
there weren't the rest of his
performance certainly merited it.
New Song
After playing a new song about
a sunny day which melted into
"Cecilia," Simon sang a new song
from his latest album, "The
Adventures of Rhymin' Simon."
The words dealt with strange,
humorous visions, of Simon flying
high while his "eyes could clearly
see the Statue of Liberty floating
out to sea."
Pausing briefly between songs,
he talked of 1965, the pre-Simon
and Garfunkel days, when he was

performing in a Paris theatre. It
was there that he met a group
called "Los Incas" which played
South American music. It was
here that Simon first heard and
fell in love with their instrumental
version of "El Condor Pasa," a
song to which Simon added words
three years later.
The group played background
for the song on Simon and
Garfunkel's "Bridge Over
Troubled Water" album, and later
joined Simon on his first solo
album to add their unique sound
for the song "Duncan."
This was all a way of
' itroducing Urubamba, which is a
reformation of Los Incas,
containing two of the original
members from the old group. The
four men came onstage and joined
Simon in "Ei Condor Pasa."
There was a problem with the
lighting, and after Simon
commented that the band needed
more light and the problem was
corrected, there was much
applause. He commented, "That's
the biggest hand of the night so
far." As the night went on they
got bigger and louder.
Instrumental
After performing "Duncan,"
Simon announced tht they were
going to play two South American
instrumentals, "Song of
Goodbye," and "Death in Santa
Cruz." The California-minded
audience laughed at the latter
title, but Simon corrected them:
"Not this Santa Cruz. There are
other Santa Cruzes in the world."
He instructed the audience: "Take
note of the drummer on these
songs." And who should the
drummer turn out to be but
Rhymin' Simon himself.
The two songs provided a
pleasant change, but aside from
the flute playing in "Santa Cruz,"
they were nothing extraordinary.
Neither was Simon's talent on the
drum. As the applause died down
after the two songs, he smiled and
said, "and I haven't been playing
the drums too long. I don't know
what it is, I just pick it up and it
comes."

The first set concluded with
Simon back in the foreground,
playing his more familiar
instrument, the guitar, for "The
Boxer." After a short break he
bounced back alone for "Mrs.
Robinson" and "Congratula
tions."
Both were eloquently
performed, from the harshness of
the guitar which fits so well into
the song from"The Graduate," to
the soft, intricate guitar picking
which so adequately
supplemented "Congratulations."
Next he "looked back on all the
crap" he learned in high school as
he performed another song from
his new album, "Mamma Don't
Take My Koda-Chrome Away."
Old Hits
Soon his musical pendulum
swung back to the past again as he
played the first guitar chords for
one of his old hits. The crowd
immediately broke into applause
as they recognized "Homeward
Bound." Simon stopped playing
to announce: "This is a song by
Bobby Darin," and laughed with
the crowd.
He went on to sing about "a
poet and a one-man band," and
also now a one-man singer
without his tall, skinny sidekick
Art Garfunkel. His absence was
really noticed in only a few
numbers, and one of these was
"Sounds of Silence." Though the
rendition of the hit good, one
could not help but notice that the
softness and carefully woven
harmonies of the original Simon
and Garfunkel hit were missing. A
Simon solo on this song could
have been more moving.
The Dixson Singers did prove
to be a better complement to two
other Simon songs, "Bridge Over
Troubled Water" (which is quite
different with an organ in place of
the piano), and most notably the
rocking "Mother and Child
Reunion."
After these songs, Simon left
the stage to the Dixson Singers,
who did two Jesus rock songs to
the enthusiastic rhythmic clapping

of the audience, and then it was
all over except for the encores.
The first time Simon came back
with the Dixson Singers and
performed an old-time sounding
rock number about his mother
loving him like the rock of ages.
Solo Encore
More bows, applause, and
standing ovations passed before
Simon returned alone for a solo
encore. Immediately the crowd
began shouting requests to him.
After refusing a few requests with
a simple "Na," another barrage of
suggestions followed. He said
suddenly, "What was that one?"
The crowd was now
silent ... until a distant voice
yelled "Play all night!" Turning
this request down, Simon settled
on "America" for his finale song,
which is one of the most moving
and meaningful songs he has ever
written.
It was also very appropriate for
an encore number because it ties
together the humor, love, lack of
communication, and lonely
searching which appear in so
many of his other songs. After a
beautiful rendition of the song, he
bowed graciously to a standing
ovation, and said, "I really, really
thank you," and disappeared
behind stage.
He had performed for nearly
two hours total, but it seemed
that he was gone too soon. Once
again, Simon proved in this flaless
performance that he has been, and
will continue to be a leading
figure in the music scene of today.
As he sang "The Boxer"
Sunday night, he added a new
verse which included the words,
"after changes upon changes we
are more or less the same."
Although the content and style of
Simon's music has changed
somewhat over the years, his
distinctive smooth voice and
talented guitar playing still show
that he is one of the best in the
business. And in that sense, he is
still "more or less the same."
Hopefully, he will stay that
way.

clear, and polished.
Throughout the concert, his
comments to the audience helped
bring the audience and performer
closer together. His songs as well
as his spontaneous comments
were humorous and entertaining.
After his first two songs he
announced, "I'm going to do
some new songs tonight. Most
audiences don't like to hear new
songs... but I'm going to play
them anyway."
The enthusiastic crowd
applauded, then he added,
"There's no need for applause." If
there weren't the rest of his
performance certainly merited it.
New Song
After playing a new song about
a sunny day which melted into
"Cecilia," Simon sang a new song
from his latest album, "The
Adventures of Rhymin' Simon."
The words dealt with strange,
humorous visions, of Simon flying
high while his "eyes could clearly
see the Statue of Liberty floating
out to sea."
Pausing briefly between songs,
he talked of 1965, the pre-Simon
and Garfunkel days, when he was

performing in a Paris theatre. It
was there that he met a group
called "Los Incas" which played
South American music. It was
here that Simon first heard and
fell in love with their instrumental
version of "El Condor Pasa," a
song to which Simon added words
three years later.
The group played background
for the song on Simon and
Garfunkel's "Bridge Over
Troubled Water" album, and later
joined Simon on his first solo
album to add their unique sound
for the song "Duncan."
This was all a way of
' itroducing Urubamba, which is a
reformation of Los Incas,
containing two of the original
members from the old group. The
four men came onstage and joined
Simon in "Ei Condor Pasa."
There was a problem with the
lighting, and after Simon
commented that the band needed
more light and the problem was
corrected, there was much
applause. He commented, "That's
the biggest hand of the night so
far." As the night went on they
got bigger and louder.
Instrumental
After performing "Duncan,"
Simon announced tht they were
going to play two South American
instrumentals, "Song of
Goodbye," and "Death in Santa
Cruz." The California-minded
audience laughed at the latter
title, but Simon corrected them:
"Not this Santa Cruz. There are
other Santa Cruzes in the world."
He instructed the audience: "Take
note of the drummer on these
songs." And who should the
drummer turn out to be but
Rhymin' Simon himself.
The two songs provided a
pleasant change, but aside from
the flute playing in "Santa Cruz,"
they were nothing extraordinary.
Neither was Simon's talent on the
drum. As the applause died down
after the two songs, he smiled and
said, "and I haven't been playing
the drums too long. I don't know
what it is, I just pick it up and it
comes."

The first set concluded with
Simon back in the foreground,
playing his more familiar
instrument, the guitar, for "The
Boxer." After a short break he
bounced back alone for "Mrs.
Robinson" and "Congratula
tions."
Both were eloquently
performed, from the harshness of
the guitar which fits so well into
the song from"The Graduate," to
the soft, intricate guitar picking
which so adequately
supplemented "Congratulations."
Next he "looked back on all the
crap" he learned in high school as
he performed another song from
his new album, "Mamma Don't
Take My Koda-Chrome Away."
Old Hits
Soon his musical pendulum
swung back to the past again as he
played the first guitar chords for
one of his old hits. The crowd
immediately broke into applause
as they recognized "Homeward
Bound." Simon stopped playing
to announce: "This is a song by
Bobby Darin," and laughed with
the crowd.
He went on to sing about "a
poet and a one-man band," and
also now a one-man singer
without his tall, skinny sidekick
Art Garfunkel. His absence was
really noticed in only a few
numbers, and one of these was
"Sounds of Silence." Though the
rendition of the hit good, one
could not help but notice that the
softness and carefully woven
harmonies of the original Simon
and Garfunkel hit were missing. A
Simon solo on this song could
have been more moving.
The Dixson Singers did prove
to be a better complement to two
other Simon songs, "Bridge Over
Troubled Water" (which is quite
different with an organ in place of
the piano), and most notably the
rocking "Mother and Child
Reunion."
After these songs, Simon left
the stage to the Dixson Singers,
who did two Jesus rock songs to
the enthusiastic rhythmic clapping

of the audience, and then it was
all over except for the encores.
The first time Simon came back
with the Dixson Singers and
performed an old-time sounding
rock number about his mother
loving him like the rock of ages.
Solo Encore
More bows, applause, and
standing ovations passed before
Simon returned alone for a solo
encore. Immediately the crowd
began shouting requests to him.
After refusing a few requests with
a simple "Na," another barrage of
suggestions followed. He said
suddenly, "What was that one?"
The crowd was now
silent ... until a distant voice
yelled "Play all night!" Turning
this request down, Simon settled
on "America" for his finale song,
which is one of the most moving
and meaningful songs he has ever
written.
It was also very appropriate for
an encore number because it ties
together the humor, love, lack of
communication, and lonely
searching which appear in so
many of his other songs. After a
beautiful rendition of the song, he
bowed graciously to a standing
ovation, and said, "I really, really
thank you," and disappeared
behind stage.
He had performed for nearly
two hours total, but it seemed
that he was gone too soon. Once
again, Simon proved in this flaless
performance that he has been, and
will continue to be a leading
figure in the music scene of today.
As he sang "The Boxer"
Sunday night, he added a new
verse which included the words,
"after changes upon changes we
are more or less the same."
Although the content and style of
Simon's music has changed
somewhat over the years, his
distinctive smooth voice and
talented guitar playing still show
that he is one of the best in the
business. And in that sense, he is
still "more or less the same."
Hopefully, he will stay that
way.

RHYMIN' SIMON—At the San Francisco Opera House last Sunday, Paul Simon gave a performance of his
old songs as well as songs he has recently added to his repertoire. For a review of the concert see article at

At San Francisco's Opera
House last Sunday night, Paul
Simon gave a superb professional
performance, leaving the
near-capacity crowd with a taste
of his old songs, a little bit of
gospel music, a glimpse at South
American music, and a desire to
hear much, much more. The
concert contained a perfect blend
of the old and the new Simon,
complete from his roots of
influence to his new paths of
direction.
"Me and Julio Down by the
Schoolyard" was the first song
Simon performed, and it
flawless down to the last whistled
note. The crowd loved it,
responding with tremendous
applause. Simon simply smiled
and humbly commented, "That
was nothing." He followed with
"Wear Your Body Down," which

high while his "eyes could clearly
see the Statue of Liberty floating
out to sea."
Pausing briefly between songs,
he talked of 1965, the pre-Simon
and Garfunkel days, when he was

performing in a Paris theatre. It
was there that he met a group
called "Los Incas" which played
South American music. It was
here that Simon first heard and
fell in love with their instrumental
version of "El Condor Pasa," a
song to which Simon added words
three years later.
The group played background
for the song on Simon and
Garfunkel's "Bridge Over
Troubled Water" album, and later
joined Simon on his first solo
album to add their unique sound
for the song "Duncan."
This was all a way of
' itroducing Urubamba, which is a
reformation of Los Incas,
containing two of the original
members from the old group. The
four men came onstage and joined
Simon in "Ei Condor Pasa."
There was a problem with the
lighting, and after Simon
commented that the band needed
more light and the problem was
corrected, there was much
applause. He commented, "That's
the biggest hand of the night so
far." As the night went on they
got bigger and louder.
Instrumental
After performing "Duncan,"
Simon announced tht they were
going to play two South American
instrumentals, "Song of
Goodbye," and "Death in Santa
Cruz." The California-minded
audience laughed at the latter
title, but Simon corrected them:
"Not this Santa Cruz. There are
other Santa Cruzes in the world."
He instructed the audience: "Take
note of the drummer on these
songs." And who should the
drummer turn out to be but
Rhymin' Simon himself.
The two songs provided a
pleasant change, but aside from
the flute playing in "Santa Cruz,"
they were nothing extraordinary.
Neither was Simon's talent on the
drum. As the applause died down
after the two songs, he smiled and
said, "and I haven't been playing
the drums too long. I don't know
what it is, I just pick it up and it
comes."

The first set concluded with
Simon back in the foreground,
playing his more familiar
instrument, the guitar, for "The
Boxer." After a short break he
bounced back alone for "Mrs.
Robinson" and "Congratula
tions."
Both were eloquently
performed, from the harshness of
the guitar which fits so well into
the song from"The Graduate," to
the soft, intricate guitar picking
which so adequately
supplemented "Congratulations."
Next he "looked back on all the
crap" he learned in high school as
he performed another song from
his new album, "Mamma Don't
Take My Koda-Chrome Away."
Old Hits
Soon his musical pendulum
swung back to the past again as he
played the first guitar chords for
one of his old hits. The crowd
immediately broke into applause
as they recognized "Homeward
Bound." Simon stopped playing
to announce: "This is a song by
Bobby Darin," and laughed with
the crowd.
He went on to sing about "a
poet and a one-man band," and
also now a one-man singer
without his tall, skinny sidekick
Art Garfunkel. His absence was
really noticed in only a few
numbers, and one of these was
"Sounds of Silence." Though the
rendition of the hit good, one
could not help but notice that the
softness and carefully woven
harmonies of the original Simon
and Garfunkel hit were missing. A
Simon solo on this song could
have been more moving.
The Dixson Singers did prove
to be a better complement to two
other Simon songs, "Bridge Over
Troubled Water" (which is quite
different with an organ in place of
the piano), and most notably the
rocking "Mother and Child
Reunion."
After these songs, Simon left
the stage to the Dixson Singers,
who did two Jesus rock songs to
the enthusiastic rhythmic clapping

of the audience, and then it was
all over except for the encores.
The first time Simon came back
with the Dixson Singers and
performed an old-time sounding
rock number about his mother
loving him like the rock of ages.
Solo Encore
More bows, applause, and
standing ovations passed before
Simon returned alone for a solo
encore. Immediately the crowd
began shouting requests to him.
After refusing a few requests with
a simple "Na," another barrage of
suggestions followed. He said
suddenly, "What was that one?"
The crowd was now
silent ... until a distant voice
yelled "Play all night!" Turning
this request down, Simon settled
on "America" for his finale song,
which is one of the most moving
and meaningful songs he has ever
written.
It was also very appropriate for
an encore number because it ties
together the humor, love, lack of
communication, and lonely
searching which appear in so
many of his other songs. After a
beautiful rendition of the song, he
bowed graciously to a standing
ovation, and said, "I really, really
thank you," and disappeared
behind stage.
He had performed for nearly
two hours total, but it seemed
that he was gone too soon. Once
again, Simon proved in this flaless
performance that he has been, and
will continue to be a leading
figure in the music scene of today.
As he sang "The Boxer"
Sunday night, he added a new
verse which included the words,
"after changes upon changes we
are more or less the same."
Although the content and style of
Simon's music has changed
somewhat over the years, his
distinctive smooth voice and
talented guitar playing still show
that he is one of the best in the
business. And in that sense, he is
still "more or less the same."
Hopefully, he will stay that
way.

RHYMIN' SIMON—At the San Francisco Opera House last Sunday, Paul Simon gave a performance of his
old songs as well as songs he has recently added to his repertoire. For a review of the concert see article at
left.
At San Francisco's Opera
House last Sunday night, Paul
Simon gave a superb professional
performance, leaving the
near-capacity crowd with a taste
of his old songs, a little bit of
gospel music, a glimpse at South
American music, and a desire to
hear much, much more. The
concert contained a perfect blend
of the old and the new Simon,
complete from his roots of
influence to his new paths of
direction.
"Me and Julio Down by the
Schoolyard" was the first song
Simon performed, and it
flawless down to the last whistled
note. The crowd loved it,
responding with tremendous
applause. Simon simply smiled
and humbly commented, "That
was nothing." He followed with
"Wear Your Body Down," which
is also on his first solo album.
Again, the sound was strong,
clear, and polished.
Throughout the concert, his
comments to the audience helped
bring the audience and performer
closer together. His songs as well
as his spontaneous comments
were humorous and entertaining.
After his first two songs he
announced, "I'm going to do
some new songs tonight. Most
audiences don't like to hear new
songs... but I'm going to play
them anyway."
The enthusiastic crowd
applauded, then he added,
"There's no need for applause." If
there weren't the rest of his
performance certainly merited it.

After playing a new song about
a sunny day which melted into
"Cecilia," Simon sang a new song

reformation of Los Incas,
containing two of the original
members from the old group. The
four men came onstage and joined
Simon in "Ei Condor Pasa."
There was a problem with the
lighting, and after Simon
commented that the band needed
more light and the problem was
corrected, there was much
applause. He commented, "That's
the biggest hand of the night so
far." As the night went on they
got bigger and louder.
Instrumental
After performing "Duncan,"
Simon announced tht they were
going to play two South American
instrumentals, "Song of
Goodbye," and "Death in Santa
Cruz." The California-minded
audience laughed at the latter
title, but Simon corrected them:
"Not this Santa Cruz. There are
other Santa Cruzes in the world."
He instructed the audience: "Take
note of the drummer on these
songs." And who should the
drummer turn out to be but
Rhymin' Simon himself.
The two songs provided a
pleasant change, but aside from
the flute playing in "Santa Cruz,"
they were nothing extraordinary.
Neither was Simon's talent on the
drum. As the applause died down
after the two songs, he smiled and
said, "and I haven't been playing
the drums too long. I don't know
what it is, I just pick it up and it
comes."

The first set concluded with
Simon back in the foreground,
playing his more familiar
instrument, the guitar, for "The
Boxer." After a short break he
bounced back alone for "Mrs.
Robinson" and "Congratula
tions."
Both were eloquently
performed, from the harshness of
the guitar which fits so well into
the song from"The Graduate," to
the soft, intricate guitar picking
which so adequately
supplemented "Congratulations."
Next he "looked back on all the
crap" he learned in high school as
he performed another song from
his new album, "Mamma Don't
Take My Koda-Chrome Away."
Old Hits
Soon his musical pendulum
swung back to the past again as he
played the first guitar chords for
one of his old hits. The crowd
immediately broke into applause
as they recognized "Homeward
Bound." Simon stopped playing
to announce: "This is a song by
Bobby Darin," and laughed with
the crowd.
He went on to sing about "a
poet and a one-man band," and
also now a one-man singer
without his tall, skinny sidekick
Art Garfunkel. His absence was
really noticed in only a few
numbers, and one of these was
"Sounds of Silence." Though the
rendition of the hit good, one
could not help but notice that the
softness and carefully woven
harmonies of the original Simon
and Garfunkel hit were missing. A
Simon solo on this song could
have been more moving.
The Dixson Singers did prove
to be a better complement to two
other Simon songs, "Bridge Over
Troubled Water" (which is quite
different with an organ in place of
the piano), and most notably the
rocking "Mother and Child
Reunion."
After these songs, Simon left
the stage to the Dixson Singers,
who did two Jesus rock songs to
the enthusiastic rhythmic clapping

of the audience, and then it was
all over except for the encores.
The first time Simon came back
with the Dixson Singers and
performed an old-time sounding
rock number about his mother
loving him like the rock of ages.
Solo Encore
More bows, applause, and
standing ovations passed before
Simon returned alone for a solo
encore. Immediately the crowd
began shouting requests to him.
After refusing a few requests with
a simple "Na," another barrage of
suggestions followed. He said
suddenly, "What was that one?"
The crowd was now
silent ... until a distant voice
yelled "Play all night!" Turning
this request down, Simon settled
on "America" for his finale song,
which is one of the most moving
and meaningful songs he has ever
written.
It was also very appropriate for
an encore number because it ties
together the humor, love, lack of
communication, and lonely
searching which appear in so
many of his other songs. After a
beautiful rendition of the song, he
bowed graciously to a standing
ovation, and said, "I really, really
thank you," and disappeared
behind stage.
He had performed for nearly
two hours total, but it seemed
that he was gone too soon. Once
again, Simon proved in this flaless
performance that he has been, and
will continue to be a leading
figure in the music scene of today.
As he sang "The Boxer"
Sunday night, he added a new
verse which included the words,
"after changes upon changes we
are more or less the same."
Although the content and style of
Simon's music has changed
somewhat over the years, his
distinctive smooth voice and
talented guitar playing still show
that he is one of the best in the
business. And in that sense, he is
still "more or less the same."
Hopefully, he will stay that
way.

RHYMIN' SIMON—At the San Francisco Opera House last Sunday, Paul Simon gave a performance of his
old songs as well as songs he has recently added to his repertoire. For a review of the concert see article at
left.
At San Francisco's Opera
House last Sunday night, Paul
Simon gave a superb professional
performance, leaving the
near-capacity crowd with a taste
of his old songs, a little bit of
gospel music, a glimpse at South
American music, and a desire to
hear much, much more. The
concert contained a perfect blend
of the old and the new Simon,
complete from his roots of
influence to his new paths of
direction.
"Me and Julio Down by the
Schoolyard" was the first song
Simon performed, and it
flawless down to the last whistled
note. The crowd loved it,
responding with tremendous
applause. Simon simply smiled
and humbly commented, "That
was nothing." He followed with
"Wear Your Body Down," which
is also on his first solo album.
Again, the sound was strong,
clear, and polished.
Throughout the concert, his
comments to the audience helped
bring the audience and performer
closer together. His songs as well
as his spontaneous comments
were humorous and entertaining.
After his first two songs he
announced, "I'm going to do
some new songs tonight. Most
audiences don't like to hear new
songs... but I'm going to play
them anyway."
The enthusiastic crowd
applauded, then he added,
"There's no need for applause." If
there weren't the rest of his
performance certainly merited it.
New Song
After playing a new song about
a sunny day which melted into
"Cecilia," Simon sang a new song
from his latest album, "The
Adventures of Rhymin' Simon."
The words dealt with strange,
humorous visions, of Simon flying
high while his "eyes could clearly
see the Statue of Liberty floating
out to sea."
Pausing briefly between songs,
he talked of 1965, the pre-Simon
and Garfunkel days, when he was

performing in a Paris theatre. It
was there that he met a group
called "Los Incas" which played
South American music. It was
here that Simon first heard and
fell in love with their instrumental
version of "El Condor Pasa," a
song to which Simon added words
three years later.
The group played background
for the song on Simon and
Garfunkel's "Bridge Over
Troubled Water" album, and later
joined Simon on his first solo
album to add their unique sound
for the song "Duncan."
This was all a way of
' itroducing Urubamba, which is a
reformation of Los Incas,
containing two of the original
members from the old group. The
four men came onstage and joined
Simon in "Ei Condor Pasa."
There was a problem with the
