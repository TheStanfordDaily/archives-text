# Chenier, Waters Surpass Hot Tuna At Winterland
## 
### DAN FORTE 
Saturday's line-up at
Winterland consisted of Hot Tuna,
Muddy Waters, and Clifton
Chenier.
When I last saw Clifton
Chenier, about a year and a half
ago at Palo Alto's now-defunct In
Your Ear, he started playing at 9
and ended at 1 in the morning.
There were no "sets" and no
intermissions.
At Winterland Saturday night
he was allowed only about 50
minutes, but this was ample time
for Clifton Chenier and his Red
Hot Louisiana Band to provide
one of the most unusual, most
entertaining shows the Bay Area
has seen in a long, long time.
Chenier, a black Cajun, 47
years old, is the South's leading
exponent of "zydeco" music, a
mixture of Cajun and
contemporary blues. He is
considered the "King of the
South," a title which he is openly

proud of.
His Red Hot Band consists of
guitar, bass, tenor sax, drums, and
Clifton's brother, Cleveland, on
rub-board, a corregated metal vest
which he plays with beer bottle
openers. Clifton sings and plays
the accordian like you've never
heard it played before.
Chenier began at 8 by saying,
"Where we come from even the
crawfish has soul." He then broke
into "Shake, Rattle, and Roll."
During the set the band played
blues, like James Cotton's "Love
Me Or Leave Me," Eddie Boyd's
"Five Long Years," and Elmo
James' standard "Dust My
Broom;" and also B&B, and even
Chuck Berry's "Reelin' and
Rockin'."
But, the songs that went over
best were Chenien's zydeco
numbers. These included two
instrumentals, "Wrap It Up" and
"Zydeco Cha Cha," a waltz
entitled "Jole Blon," sung in
French, and a zydeco version of
Albert King's "I Get Evil."
On these numbers only Clifton,
Cleveland, and the drummer,
Robert St. Julian, played.
Cleveland was spotlighted with a
dynamite rub-board solo in "Wrap
It Up."
Up-Front Numbers
Muddy Waters' band started
next with two up-front numbers,
"Chicken Shack" and "Night
Train." The band's present
members are Sammy Lawhorn
and Pee Wee Madison on guitars,
Calvin Jones (bass), George
Bufrod (harp), Willie Smith
(drums), and "Pinetop" Perkins
on piano (great).
Muddy walked on stage to a
huge ovation and sang "Forty
Days and Forty Nights." This was
followed by his most famous
song, "Hootchie Kootchie Man."
During the set, Muddy sang
fine renditions of blues standards
made famous by him and other
blues veterans as well. These

included "Baby Please Don't Go,"
"Outskirts of Town," "Blow Wind
Blow," and "Honey Bee," with a
well-applauded slide guitar solo by
Muddy. The highlight of all of
these numbers was, as usual,
Muddy Waters' unmistakable,
powerful voice.
Muddy ended the set with "I
Got My Mojo Workin'." Muddy
is now in his late 60s and about
three years ago broke his hip in a
car accident, but he hasn't slowed
down much.
Lets Loose
During "Mojo," Muddy, who
had been sitting down the entire
set, let loose and broke into a fast
"buck" dance. Naturally, the
crowd went insane. For an encore
Muddy returned to sir.g a few
more choruses of "Got My Mojo
Workin'."
As usual, my personal tastes
and those of the Winterland
audience were in exact
disagreement, as evidenced by
who received top billing (and the
most applause) for this particular
show. I am not a Hot Tuna fan,
but this is not to say that I
completely disdain all of their
music.
I could name countless rock
bands which I dislike much more
and have had to sit through on
occasion waiting for the act I
came to see.
But, on Saturday night, since
Hot Tuna was the final act, I
decided I didn't have to sit
through them, and left after their
first song.
As far as I'm concerned that
was the only advantage of having
them head the bill. In all other
respects, I think it's an insult to
such a great name as Muddy
Waters to have to play second
fiddle to a group like Hot Tuna
(whose fiddler, Papa John
"Screach" isn't that good
anyway).
In my opinion, Clifton Chenier
and his Red Hot Louisiana Band
stole the show.
