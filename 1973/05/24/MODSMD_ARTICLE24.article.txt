This is the third in a series prepared
by Personnel and Employee
Relations for Stanford employees
eligible to vote in the NLRB
eleetion on June 6. The purpose of
the series is to promote an
understanding of the eleetion and
of the possible issues involved in
the outcome.

The advantage most often cited for unionization is the greater bargaining
power which can be achieved through united action. Before the election
each voter should decide whether such added strength would improve the
quality of his/her individual employment situation at Stanford.
Specifically:
] How much say would the individual er~Moyee
have in determining the purposes for which a
union's collective strength is used?
2 How may a union's collective strength be used
to control an individual employee's actions?

EMPLOYEE CONTROL OF A UNION

• What determines how a union
is governed?
For the most part, a union's
constitution and by-laws are the deciding
factors. Federal law places some
restrictions on a union's internal rules but
generally leaves such matters for
determination by the union.
• Does USE have a constitution and
by-laws?
USE has a constitution, but the
leadership of USE has not yet submitted
by-laws (other than a dues provision) for
approval of its members.
• Do all local union rules have to be
approved by the local's members?
No. Many rules are determined by the
international union with which the local
is affiliated. As a local union of the SEIU,
USE is bound by the SEIU constitution
and by-laws. In cases of conflict with the
local's rules, the SEIU constitution and
by-laws control.
This could mean, for example, that if
the SEIU voted to raise the minimum
dues for local unions and if this required
minimum were more than the present
USE dues, then USE dues would have to
be raised regardless of the wishes of USE
members.
• Would I have to be a member of USE
to vote on changes in union rules or other
union matters?
Probably so. The present USE
constitution provides for voting by
members only.

• Would members of USE who are not
part of the bargaining unit get to vote on
matters of concern to the bargaining unit
such as contract proposals, contract
ratification, and whether or not to go on
strike?
Ask USE. Some unions permit all
members to vote. Other unions permit*
only members who are part of the
bargaining unit to vote. As yet USE has
no approved by-law on this subject.
• How many of USE's members are not
in the bargaining unit?
Ask USE. The University does not
have this information and is prohibited
by law from asking for it. It is a fact,
however, that four of the six USE officers
are not part of the bargaining unit.
• Would I get to vote to select USE's
officers?
Yes, if you are a union member at the
time of the election of officers.
%
• Would I get to vote to select my shop
steward or other union spokesman?
This would depend on USE's by-laws
which have not yet been established.

UNION CONTROL OF EMPLOYEES

• Does a union have the right to
discipline its members?
Yes. The law permits a union to
discipline members for breaking rules
related to legitimate union interests.
9
• For what kind of action might I be
fined or otherwise disciplined by a union?
This would depend on the union's
by-laws. Most union by-laws list actions
for which a member may be disciplined.
• Does USE have rules concerning union
discipline?
USE does not have such rules, but its
international (SEIU) does.
• What could I be charged with as a
member of USE?
Article XVI of the SEIU constitution
and by-laws provides that members of
local unions, such as USE, may be
charged for many different actions. Some
of them are:
"(2) Violation of the oath of loyalty
to the International Union and the local
Union;....
"(4) Gross disloyalty or conduct
unbecoming a member;....
"(8) Advocating or engaging in dual
unionism or secession;
"(9) Abuse, libel or slander of
members or officers;
"(10) A ctivities which tend to bring the
International Union or the Local Union
into disrepute;
"(11) Disobedience to the regulations,
rules, mandates and decrees of the
International Union or Local Union;....
"(13.) Working as a strike breaker or
violating wage or work stcndards
established by the International Union or
a Local Union;...."

• If charged with any of these actions,
would I have the right to a trial?
You would have the right to adequate
notice and a hearing. Your case would
probably be judged by the executive
committee of the union, which consists
of the union's principal officers.
• What penalties might I receive?
You could be fined, suspended,
expelled from membership, or otherwise
deprived of the benefits of membership.
• Is there any way I could avoid the
threat of union discipline?
If you did not join the union or
resigned from the union before you
engaged in an action for which you might
be charged, you could avoid union
discipline. But if you are not a member,
then you lose whatever right a member
has to participate in union
decision-making.

EMPLOYEE CONTROL OF A UNION

• What determines how a union
is governed?
For the most part, a union's
constitution and by-laws are the deciding
factors. Federal law places some
restrictions on a union's internal rules but
generally leaves such matters for
determination by the union.
• Does USE have a constitution and
by-laws?
USE has a constitution, but the
leadership of USE has not yet submitted
by-laws (other than a dues provision) for
approval of its members.
• Do all local union rules have to be
approved by the local's members?
No. Many rules are determined by the
international union with which the local
is affiliated. As a local union of the SEIU,
USE is bound by the SEIU constitution
and by-laws. In cases of conflict with the
local's rules, the SEIU constitution and
by-laws control.
This could mean, for example, that if
the SEIU voted to raise the minimum
dues for local unions and if this required
minimum were more than the present
USE dues, then USE dues would have to
be raised regardless of the wishes of USE
members.
• Would I have to be a member of USE
to vote on changes in union rules or other
union matters?
Probably so. The present USE
constitution provides for voting by
members only.

• Would members of USE who are not
part of the bargaining unit get to vote on
matters of concern to the bargaining unit
such as contract proposals, contract
ratification, and whether or not to go on
strike?
Ask USE. Some unions permit all
members to vote. Other unions permit*
only members who are part of the
bargaining unit to vote. As yet USE has
no approved by-law on this subject.
• How many of USE's members are not
in the bargaining unit?
Ask USE. The University does not
have this information and is prohibited
by law from asking for it. It is a fact,
however, that four of the six USE officers
are not part of the bargaining unit.
• Would I get to vote to select USE's
officers?
Yes, if you are a union member at the
time of the election of officers.
%
• Would I get to vote to select my shop
steward or other union spokesman?
This would depend on USE's by-laws
which have not yet been established.

UNION CONTROL OF EMPLOYEES

• Does a union have the right to
discipline its members?
Yes. The law permits a union to
discipline members for breaking rules
related to legitimate union interests.
9
• For what kind of action might I be
fined or otherwise disciplined by a union?
This would depend on the union's
by-laws. Most union by-laws list actions
for which a member may be disciplined.
• Does USE have rules concerning union
discipline?
USE does not have such rules, but its
international (SEIU) does.
• What could I be charged with as a
member of USE?
Article XVI of the SEIU constitution
and by-laws provides that members of
local unions, such as USE, may be
charged for many different actions. Some
of them are:
"(2) Violation of the oath of loyalty
to the International Union and the local
Union;....
"(4) Gross disloyalty or conduct
unbecoming a member;....
"(8) Advocating or engaging in dual
unionism or secession;
"(9) Abuse, libel or slander of
members or officers;
"(10) A ctivities which tend to bring the
International Union or the Local Union
into disrepute;
"(11) Disobedience to the regulations,
rules, mandates and decrees of the
International Union or Local Union;....
"(13.) Working as a strike breaker or
violating wage or work stcndards
established by the International Union or
a Local Union;...."

• If charged with any of these actions,
would I have the right to a trial?
You would have the right to adequate
notice and a hearing. Your case would
probably be judged by the executive
committee of the union, which consists
of the union's principal officers.
• What penalties might I receive?
You could be fined, suspended,
expelled from membership, or otherwise
deprived of the benefits of membership.
• Is there any way I could avoid the
threat of union discipline?
If you did not join the union or
resigned from the union before you
engaged in an action for which you might
be charged, you could avoid union
discipline. But if you are not a member,
then you lose whatever right a member
has to participate in union
decision-making.

power which can be achieved through united action. Before the election
each voter should decide whether such added strength would improve the
quality of his/her individual employment situation at Stanford.

have in determining the purposes for which a
union's collective strength is used?
2 How may a union's collective strength be used
to control an individual employee's actions?

EMPLOYEE CONTROL OF A UNION

• What determines how a union
is governed?
For the most part, a union's
constitution and by-laws are the deciding
factors. Federal law places some
restrictions on a union's internal rules but
generally leaves such matters for
determination by the union.
• Does USE have a constitution and
by-laws?
USE has a constitution, but the
leadership of USE has not yet submitted
by-laws (other than a dues provision) for
approval of its members.
• Do all local union rules have to be
approved by the local's members?
No. Many rules are determined by the
international union with which the local
is affiliated. As a local union of the SEIU,
USE is bound by the SEIU constitution
and by-laws. In cases of conflict with the
local's rules, the SEIU constitution and
by-laws control.
This could mean, for example, that if
the SEIU voted to raise the minimum
dues for local unions and if this required
minimum were more than the present
USE dues, then USE dues would have to
be raised regardless of the wishes of USE
members.
• Would I have to be a member of USE
to vote on changes in union rules or other
union matters?
Probably so. The present USE
constitution provides for voting by
members only.

• Would members of USE who are not
part of the bargaining unit get to vote on
matters of concern to the bargaining unit
such as contract proposals, contract
ratification, and whether or not to go on
strike?
Ask USE. Some unions permit all
members to vote. Other unions permit*
only members who are part of the
bargaining unit to vote. As yet USE has
no approved by-law on this subject.
• How many of USE's members are not
in the bargaining unit?
Ask USE. The University does not
have this information and is prohibited
by law from asking for it. It is a fact,
however, that four of the six USE officers
are not part of the bargaining unit.
• Would I get to vote to select USE's
officers?
Yes, if you are a union member at the
time of the election of officers.
%
• Would I get to vote to select my shop
steward or other union spokesman?
This would depend on USE's by-laws
which have not yet been established.

UNION CONTROL OF EMPLOYEES

• Does a union have the right to
discipline its members?
Yes. The law permits a union to
discipline members for breaking rules
related to legitimate union interests.
9
• For what kind of action might I be
fined or otherwise disciplined by a union?
This would depend on the union's
by-laws. Most union by-laws list actions
for which a member may be disciplined.
• Does USE have rules concerning union
discipline?
USE does not have such rules, but its
international (SEIU) does.
• What could I be charged with as a
member of USE?
Article XVI of the SEIU constitution
and by-laws provides that members of
local unions, such as USE, may be
charged for many different actions. Some
of them are:
"(2) Violation of the oath of loyalty
to the International Union and the local
Union;....
"(4) Gross disloyalty or conduct
unbecoming a member;....
"(8) Advocating or engaging in dual
unionism or secession;
"(9) Abuse, libel or slander of
members or officers;
"(10) A ctivities which tend to bring the
International Union or the Local Union
into disrepute;
"(11) Disobedience to the regulations,
rules, mandates and decrees of the
International Union or Local Union;....
"(13.) Working as a strike breaker or
violating wage or work stcndards
established by the International Union or
a Local Union;...."

• If charged with any of these actions,
would I have the right to a trial?
You would have the right to adequate
notice and a hearing. Your case would
probably be judged by the executive
committee of the union, which consists
of the union's principal officers.
• What penalties might I receive?
You could be fined, suspended,
expelled from membership, or otherwise
deprived of the benefits of membership.
• Is there any way I could avoid the
threat of union discipline?
If you did not join the union or
resigned from the union before you
engaged in an action for which you might
be charged, you could avoid union
discipline. But if you are not a member,
then you lose whatever right a member
has to participate in union
decision-making.
