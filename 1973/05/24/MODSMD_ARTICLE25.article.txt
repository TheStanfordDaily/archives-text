Salvage Mission Ready
CAPE KENNEDY — Parts and crew for the first
space salvage mission came together here yesterday
as the countdown moved smoothly toward launch
tomorrow of the troubleshooting Skylab 1
astronauts.
Astronauts Charles Conrad Jr., Dr. Joseph P.
Kerwin, and Paul J. Weitz passed a
launch-minus-two days medical examination and
then received briefings on the repair job they will
try to do on the crippled Skylab space station,
orbiting 272 miles above the earth.
Tools, materials and improvised sunshades
designed to rescue the overheated Skylab from
failure began arriving at Cape Kennedy from the
space agency's other centers.
The star device of the space patch job is an
umbrella-shaped shade developed at the Johnson
Space Center near Houston. Experts believe the
shiny aluminum and orange parasol will block
enough of the sun's heat from the Skylab to permit
a full 28-day mission by Conrad, Kerwin and Weitz.
Countdown on the Saturn IB Rocket which will
drill the astronauts into orbit toward Skylab, started
on time yesterday morning and proceeded
smoothly.
Launch is scheduled for 6 a.m. PDT tomorrow.
'Significant Progress" In Talks
WASHINGTON — Henry A. Kissinger said yesterday
in Paris he and Hanoi's Le Due Tho have made
"significant progress" in six days of talks to make
the Vietnam peace agreement work better.
Before departure for Washington, Kissinger told
newsmen he and Tho will meet again June 6 to
complete a new accord designed to stop cease-fire
violations.
Kissinger's chief aide in the cease-fire talks,
William Sullivan, was in Saigon to report to
President Nguyen Van Thieu on the Paris sessions.
Kissinger, smiling and visibly relaxed, read a
prepared statement which he said he had cleared in
advance with Tho.
"He will confirm what I am saying," Kissinger
declared.
He said Sullivan was submitting agreed proposals
to Thieu in Saigon and hinted that neither the
United States nor Hanoi would allow possible
objections from Thieu to prevent conclusion of the
new agreement at the next session.
Sullivan flew to Saigon Tuesday night after
attending Kissinger-Tho meetings for a total of more
than 30 hours and several meetings at expert level,
including a 12-hour session Sunday.
House Upholds Nixon Veto
WASHINGTON — President Nixon won a key test

of his power yesterday when the House upheld his
veto of a bill that would have required Senate
approval of his top budget aides.
The vote to override the veto was 236 to 178, or
40 short of the two-thirds majority needed to force
the bill into law.
Those voting to sustain Nixon included 167
Republicans, while 18 of their GOP colleagues
joined 218 Democrats against the President.
The action came just a day after the Senate
handed Nixon a six-vote defeat on the bill.
The legislation would have abolished the jobs of
Director Roy Ash and Deputy Director Frederic
Malek of the President's Office of Management and
Budget, and would have promptly set up similar
posts requiring the new step of Senate confirmation
of presidential nominees.
Nixon denounced this as unconstitutional and a
"back-door method" of getting around presidential
authority to remove an officer he has appointed.
Congressional opponents of the bill said it would
set a precedent whereby Congress would remove
executive officers by means other than
impeachment by the House and conviction by the
Senate.
Ford Bows To Demands
BUENOS AIRES — The Ford Motor Co. bowed to
leftist terrorist demands yesterday that it pay $1
million to forestall the kidnaping or slaying of one
of its executives in Argentina.
The guerrillas said the money would go for
hospital equipment and milk for slum children.
Officials of Ford Motor Co. in Dearborn, Mich.,
said they had decided to submit to the demands by
the Trotskyite People's Revolutionary Army after
conferring with company executives in Buenos
Aires.
Edgar R. Molina, a Ford vice president, said the
demands called for 154 ambulances and other
donations to hospitals.
"We will turn the equipment over directly to the
hospitals," Molina said.
Molina made no mention of the demand that his
company supply milk for slum children.
"We believe under the circumstances we had no
choice but to meet these demands," Molina said.
This was the first time Ford has faced a ransom
demand by a terrorist group, the company said. The
extortion attempt came as foreign dignitaries began
arriving for the inauguration Friday of Hector J.
Campora, president-elect, who won his office with
the backing of former dictator Juan D. Peron.
Court To Hear Calley Appeal
WASHINGTON - The U.S. Court of Military-
Appeals yesterday agreed to hear an appeal from Lt.

William Calley Jr. for his conviction in the My Lai
massacre.
But in agreeing to a hearing, the three-member
court also narrowed from 30 to 3 the issues on
which it would consider overturning or reducing
Galley's sentence to 20 years imprisonment.
The military court, which is likely to set a
hearing date for next October, said it would decide
only:
~ If pretrial publicity prevented the 29-year-old
former platoon leader from receiving a fair trial.
— If the judge in the 1971 court-martial which
convicted Calley gave inadequate, confusing,
erroneous,or misleading instructions to members of
the court.
— Or if there was insufficient evidence to prove
Calley guilty of murdering no fewer than 22
Vietnamese civilians.
Today's Weather
Slight chance of showers today. Partly cloudy
tonight and tomorrow. Little temperature change.
Low both nights in the low 50s. High today and
tomorrow in the upper 50s near the ocean to the
upper 60s and low 70s inland. Westerly winds 10 to
20 mph.

Aires.
Edgar R. Molina, a Ford vice president, said the
demands called for 154 ambulances and other
donations to hospitals.
"We will turn the equipment over directly to the
hospitals," Molina said.
Molina made no mention of the demand that his
company supply milk for slum children.
"We believe under the circumstances we had no
choice but to meet these demands," Molina said.
This was the first time Ford has faced a ransom
demand by a terrorist group, the company said. The
extortion attempt came as foreign dignitaries began
arriving for the inauguration Friday of Hector J.
Campora, president-elect, who won his office with
the backing of former dictator Juan D. Peron.
Court To Hear Calley Appeal
WASHINGTON - The U.S. Court of Military-
Appeals yesterday agreed to hear an appeal from Lt.

William Calley Jr. for his conviction in the My Lai
massacre.
But in agreeing to a hearing, the three-member
court also narrowed from 30 to 3 the issues on
which it would consider overturning or reducing
Galley's sentence to 20 years imprisonment.
The military court, which is likely to set a
hearing date for next October, said it would decide
only:
~ If pretrial publicity prevented the 29-year-old
former platoon leader from receiving a fair trial.
— If the judge in the 1971 court-martial which
convicted Calley gave inadequate, confusing,
erroneous,or misleading instructions to members of
the court.
— Or if there was insufficient evidence to prove
Calley guilty of murdering no fewer than 22
Vietnamese civilians.
Today's Weather
Slight chance of showers today. Partly cloudy
tonight and tomorrow. Little temperature change.
Low both nights in the low 50s. High today and
tomorrow in the upper 50s near the ocean to the
upper 60s and low 70s inland. Westerly winds 10 to
20 mph.
Salvage Mission Ready
CAPE KENNEDY — Parts and crew for the first
space salvage mission came together here yesterday
as the countdown moved smoothly toward launch
tomorrow of the troubleshooting Skylab 1
astronauts.
Astronauts Charles Conrad Jr., Dr. Joseph P.
Kerwin, and Paul J. Weitz passed a
launch-minus-two days medical examination and
then received briefings on the repair job they will
try to do on the crippled Skylab space station,
orbiting 272 miles above the earth.
Tools, materials and improvised sunshades
designed to rescue the overheated Skylab from
failure began arriving at Cape Kennedy from the
space agency's other centers.
The star device of the space patch job is an
umbrella-shaped shade developed at the Johnson
Space Center near Houston. Experts believe the
shiny aluminum and orange parasol will block
enough of the sun's heat from the Skylab to permit
a full 28-day mission by Conrad, Kerwin and Weitz.
Countdown on the Saturn IB Rocket which will
drill the astronauts into orbit toward Skylab, started
on time yesterday morning and proceeded
smoothly.
Launch is scheduled for 6 a.m. PDT tomorrow.
'Significant Progress" In Talks
WASHINGTON — Henry A. Kissinger said yesterday
in Paris he and Hanoi's Le Due Tho have made
"significant progress" in six days of talks to make
the Vietnam peace agreement work better.
Before departure for Washington, Kissinger told
newsmen he and Tho will meet again June 6 to
complete a new accord designed to stop cease-fire
violations.
Kissinger's chief aide in the cease-fire talks,
William Sullivan, was in Saigon to report to
President Nguyen Van Thieu on the Paris sessions.
Kissinger, smiling and visibly relaxed, read a
prepared statement which he said he had cleared in
advance with Tho.
"He will confirm what I am saying," Kissinger
declared.
He said Sullivan was submitting agreed proposals
to Thieu in Saigon and hinted that neither the
United States nor Hanoi would allow possible
objections from Thieu to prevent conclusion of the
new agreement at the next session.
Sullivan flew to Saigon Tuesday night after
attending Kissinger-Tho meetings for a total of more
than 30 hours and several meetings at expert level,
including a 12-hour session Sunday.
House Upholds Nixon Veto
WASHINGTON — President Nixon won a key test

of his power yesterday when the House upheld his
veto of a bill that would have required Senate
approval of his top budget aides.
The vote to override the veto was 236 to 178, or
40 short of the two-thirds majority needed to force
the bill into law.
Those voting to sustain Nixon included 167
Republicans, while 18 of their GOP colleagues
joined 218 Democrats against the President.
The action came just a day after the Senate
handed Nixon a six-vote defeat on the bill.
The legislation would have abolished the jobs of
Director Roy Ash and Deputy Director Frederic
Malek of the President's Office of Management and
Budget, and would have promptly set up similar
posts requiring the new step of Senate confirmation
of presidential nominees.
Nixon denounced this as unconstitutional and a
"back-door method" of getting around presidential
authority to remove an officer he has appointed.
Congressional opponents of the bill said it would
set a precedent whereby Congress would remove
executive officers by means other than
impeachment by the House and conviction by the
Senate.
Ford Bows To Demands
BUENOS AIRES — The Ford Motor Co. bowed to
leftist terrorist demands yesterday that it pay $1

of its executives in Argentina.

Officials of Ford Motor Co. in Dearborn, Mich.,
said they had decided to submit to the demands by
the Trotskyite People's Revolutionary Army after

to Thieu in Saigon and hinted that neither the
United States nor Hanoi would allow possible
objections from Thieu to prevent conclusion of the
new agreement at the next session.
Sullivan flew to Saigon Tuesday night after
attending Kissinger-Tho meetings for a total of more
than 30 hours and several meetings at expert level,
including a 12-hour session Sunday.
House Upholds Nixon Veto
WASHINGTON — President Nixon won a key test

of his power yesterday when the House upheld his
veto of a bill that would have required Senate
approval of his top budget aides.
The vote to override the veto was 236 to 178, or
40 short of the two-thirds majority needed to force
the bill into law.
Those voting to sustain Nixon included 167
Republicans, while 18 of their GOP colleagues
joined 218 Democrats against the President.
The action came just a day after the Senate
handed Nixon a six-vote defeat on the bill.
The legislation would have abolished the jobs of
Director Roy Ash and Deputy Director Frederic
Malek of the President's Office of Management and
Budget, and would have promptly set up similar
posts requiring the new step of Senate confirmation
of presidential nominees.
Nixon denounced this as unconstitutional and a
"back-door method" of getting around presidential
authority to remove an officer he has appointed.
Congressional opponents of the bill said it would
set a precedent whereby Congress would remove
executive officers by means other than
impeachment by the House and conviction by the
Senate.
Ford Bows To Demands
BUENOS AIRES — The Ford Motor Co. bowed to
leftist terrorist demands yesterday that it pay $1
million to forestall the kidnaping or slaying of one
of its executives in Argentina.
The guerrillas said the money would go for
hospital equipment and milk for slum children.
Officials of Ford Motor Co. in Dearborn, Mich.,
said they had decided to submit to the demands by
the Trotskyite People's Revolutionary Army after
conferring with company executives in Buenos
Aires.
Edgar R. Molina, a Ford vice president, said the
demands called for 154 ambulances and other
donations to hospitals.
"We will turn the equipment over directly to the
hospitals," Molina said.
Molina made no mention of the demand that his
company supply milk for slum children.
"We believe under the circumstances we had no
choice but to meet these demands," Molina said.
This was the first time Ford has faced a ransom
demand by a terrorist group, the company said. The
extortion attempt came as foreign dignitaries began
arriving for the inauguration Friday of Hector J.
Campora, president-elect, who won his office with
the backing of former dictator Juan D. Peron.
Court To Hear Calley Appeal
WASHINGTON - The U.S. Court of Military-
Appeals yesterday agreed to hear an appeal from Lt.

William Calley Jr. for his conviction in the My Lai
massacre.
But in agreeing to a hearing, the three-member
court also narrowed from 30 to 3 the issues on
which it would consider overturning or reducing
Galley's sentence to 20 years imprisonment.
The military court, which is likely to set a
hearing date for next October, said it would decide
only:
~ If pretrial publicity prevented the 29-year-old
former platoon leader from receiving a fair trial.
— If the judge in the 1971 court-martial which
convicted Calley gave inadequate, confusing,
erroneous,or misleading instructions to members of
the court.
— Or if there was insufficient evidence to prove
Calley guilty of murdering no fewer than 22
Vietnamese civilians.
Today's Weather
Slight chance of showers today. Partly cloudy
tonight and tomorrow. Little temperature change.
Low both nights in the low 50s. High today and
tomorrow in the upper 50s near the ocean to the
upper 60s and low 70s inland. Westerly winds 10 to
20 mph.
Salvage Mission Ready
CAPE KENNEDY — Parts and crew for the first
space salvage mission came together here yesterday
as the countdown moved smoothly toward launch
tomorrow of the troubleshooting Skylab 1
astronauts.
Astronauts Charles Conrad Jr., Dr. Joseph P.
Kerwin, and Paul J. Weitz passed a
launch-minus-two days medical examination and
then received briefings on the repair job they will
try to do on the crippled Skylab space station,
orbiting 272 miles above the earth.
Tools, materials and improvised sunshades
designed to rescue the overheated Skylab from
failure began arriving at Cape Kennedy from the
space agency's other centers.
The star device of the space patch job is an
umbrella-shaped shade developed at the Johnson
Space Center near Houston. Experts believe the
shiny aluminum and orange parasol will block
enough of the sun's heat from the Skylab to permit
a full 28-day mission by Conrad, Kerwin and Weitz.
Countdown on the Saturn IB Rocket which will
drill the astronauts into orbit toward Skylab, started
on time yesterday morning and proceeded
smoothly.
Launch is scheduled for 6 a.m. PDT tomorrow.
'Significant Progress" In Talks
WASHINGTON — Henry A. Kissinger said yesterday
in Paris he and Hanoi's Le Due Tho have made
"significant progress" in six days of talks to make
the Vietnam peace agreement work better.
Before departure for Washington, Kissinger told
newsmen he and Tho will meet again June 6 to
complete a new accord designed to stop cease-fire
violations.
Kissinger's chief aide in the cease-fire talks,
William Sullivan, was in Saigon to report to
President Nguyen Van Thieu on the Paris sessions.
Kissinger, smiling and visibly relaxed, read a
prepared statement which he said he had cleared in
advance with Tho.
"He will confirm what I am saying," Kissinger
declared.
He said Sullivan was submitting agreed proposals
to Thieu in Saigon and hinted that neither the
United States nor Hanoi would allow possible
objections from Thieu to prevent conclusion of the
new agreement at the next session.
