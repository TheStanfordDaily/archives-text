J The School of Medicine has received thep
t largest grant in the history of heart transplant j
\ research, according to University spokesmen.
j The National Heart and Lung Institute 2
i(NHLI) funded the $2,569,311, five-year
i grant for continued research in human hearty
transplantation. 3
3 The primary goal of the research effort will be j
ij further refinement of the post-operative 2
3 treatment of transplant patients. The program 2
Swill focus on four main areas: gj
— improvement of the diagnosis of
2
1 — development of new methods to treaty
4 rejection;
— prevention of some of the long-term 2
4 consequences of immunosuppressive drugs (drugs l :
which check the body's immune or defense 2
3 system); and *
3 — utilization of biomedical engineering to*
heart function in transplant patients. *
1 Rejection of the transplanted heart by thejs
immune system remains the main obstacle *
3to more successful heart transplantation. For*
Jyears, researchers have sought better methods to 2
| detect and treat rejection in its earliest stages. *
