# Budget Cuts Hamper Arms Control Agency

Former Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency (ACDA)
counselor Lawrence Weiler addressed
about twenty students enrolled in Poli.
Sci. 1388 "Problems of Arms Control
& Disarmament," yesterday on the
subject of negotiating arms control
agreements. Weiler was a delegate to
the first round of SALT talks held in
Helsinki.
Weiler spoke briefly about the
recent budget cut suffered by ACDA,
and the acceptance of pro forma
resignations by President Nixon of all
of the higher level executives of
ACDA. While refusing to comment on
the President's motive, Weiler said
"the agency will survive, but it will be
a very, very long time before it may be
brought back to its present state of
effectiveness. And I don't think many
people in Washington are going to shed
tears over it."
"ACDA is in a state ofhemorrhage
that cannot be stopped," asserted
Weiler, and he termed the affair "a
very serious loss to the country."
Weiler stated that ACDA's role in
negotiations has been increasingly
reduced during the Nixon
Administration, but pointed out that
the position of director of ACDA still
carries with it the right to head the
SALT delegation.
In reviewing the entire process of
arms control negotiations Weiler broke
up the process into three stages. The
first stage is one of 'initial policy
development' in which it is decided
whether or not to seek an agreement,
and what the 'package aspects' of that
agreement are to be. Weiler
characterized this stage as one of
intense debate primarily within the
executive branch of the government.
Congress is not generally directly
involved in this stage.
Negotiating Process
The second stage is the negotiating
process itself, carried out by the
delegations and by high level direct
communications between heads of
state. In this stage, the areas of

agreement and disagreement are
determined, and then
recommendations are sent back to the
capitals of the respective countries as
to what changes should be made in the
bargaining stands.
The third, and most important
stage, is the process of policy review
that occurs while the delegations
confer. Here is decided "whether or
how changes in policy may be made
that will enhance the probability of an
agreement." Weiler again emphasizes
the fact that "only on rare occasions
does Congress really participate in this
part of the process..."
"For those who argue for a greater
role for Congress the nature of
decision making of arms control
negotiations presents a real problem,"
stated Weiler.

confer. Here is decided "whether or
how changes in policy may be made
that will enhance the probability of an
agreement." Weiler again emphasizes
the fact that "only on rare occasions
does Congress really participate in this
part of the process..."
"For those who argue for a greater
role for Congress the nature of
decision making of arms control
negotiations presents a real problem,"
stated Weiler.
Former Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency (ACDA)
counselor Lawrence Weiler addressed
about twenty students enrolled in Poli.
Sci. 1388 "Problems of Arms Control
& Disarmament," yesterday on the
subject of negotiating arms control
agreements. Weiler was a delegate to
the first round of SALT talks held in
Helsinki.
Weiler spoke briefly about the
recent budget cut suffered by ACDA,
and the acceptance of pro forma
resignations by President Nixon of all
of the higher level executives of
ACDA. While refusing to comment on
the President's motive, Weiler said
"the agency will survive, but it will be
a very, very long time before it may be
brought back to its present state of
effectiveness. And I don't think many
people in Washington are going to shed
tears over it."
"ACDA is in a state ofhemorrhage
that cannot be stopped," asserted
Weiler, and he termed the affair "a
very serious loss to the country."
Weiler stated that ACDA's role in
negotiations has been increasingly
reduced during the Nixon
Administration, but pointed out that
the position of director of ACDA still
carries with it the right to head the
SALT delegation.
In reviewing the entire process of
arms control negotiations Weiler broke
up the process into three stages. The
first stage is one of 'initial policy
development' in which it is decided
whether or not to seek an agreement,
and what the 'package aspects' of that
agreement are to be. Weiler
characterized this stage as one of
intense debate primarily within the
executive branch of the government.
Congress is not generally directly
involved in this stage.
Negotiating Process
The second stage is the negotiating
process itself, carried out by the
delegations and by high level direct
communications between heads of
state. In this stage, the areas of

agreement and disagreement are
determined, and then
recommendations are sent back to the
capitals of the respective countries as
to what changes should be made in the
bargaining stands.
The third, and most important
stage, is the process of policy review
that occurs while the delegations
confer. Here is decided "whether or
how changes in policy may be made
that will enhance the probability of an
agreement." Weiler again emphasizes
the fact that "only on rare occasions
does Congress really participate in this
part of the process..."
"For those who argue for a greater
role for Congress the nature of
decision making of arms control
negotiations presents a real problem,"
stated Weiler.
