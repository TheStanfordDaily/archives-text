# Chino Witnesses Link Hurts To Murder Site
## 
### 
Three witnesses testified this week
that they saw Andrea Holman Burt
and Benton Douglas Burt at or near
the scene of the Oct. 6 ambush-murder
that freed convict Ronald Beaty.
The Burts are on trial in San
Bernardino for murder, assault, and
rescue (removing a prisoner from
custody) in the escape, which took
place near the California Institution
for Men at Chino, at which Beaty was
an inmate.
Martha Veldhuizen, said Monday in
San Bernardino County Superior
Court that she heard gunshots on the
day of the escape and saw Douglas
Burt from the window of her home
near the ambush scene.
When Deputy District Attorney
Joseph D. Canty asked Veldhuizen if
she recognized anyone in the
courtroom from that day, the
housewife pointed to Douglas Burt
and said, "Yes, that's him right there."
California Highway Patrolman
Keith Hittson testified on Monday
that he saw two cars which have been
linked to the escape in the vicinity
where the incident took place on the
morning of Oct. 6. and identified
Andrea Holman Burt, the daughter of
Medicine Prof. Halsted Holman, as the
driver of one of the cars.
He also said he saw a man who
resembled Douglas Burt, but added he
couldn't make a positive
identification.
Testimony Challenged
Hittson's testimony came after
Judge Thomas Haldorsen denied a
defense motion to prevent Hittson's
testimony. Defense attorney Charles

Garry had challenged the admissability
of the officer's testimony, questioning
the circumstances under which Hittson
wrote his report of the event.
Hittson said he did not realize the
vehicles he saw were involved in a
crime until he read a newspaper
account of the incident and saw a
picture of Andrea Holman Burt on
Oct. 26, nearly three weeks after the
event.
He later filed a report which he
wrote in pencil on a day when he had
a bad cold. The sheriff's office
subsequently destroyed the original
report and Hittson's account was
incorporated in another document.
Alleged Inconsistencies
During cross-examination, Garry
attempted to show inconsistencies
between the patrolman's earlier
reports and his court testimony about
the ambush vehicles and their
occupants.
A part-time employee of a
hardware store in the Chino area
testified Tuesday that he sold bolt
cutters to Andrea Holman Burt prior
to the escape.
Yesterday telephone company
official Richard Steinbach answered
the prosecutor's questions about
phone calls Beaty made to the Burts
and others he implicated in the escape
plan. Garry will cross-examine
Steinbach on Tuesday. Today Vivian
Ferrera. the landlady of the Havward
apartment where the Burts lived prior
to their arrest, will take the witness
stand.
Two others implicated by Beaty's
testimony last week, former
Venceremos member Jean Hobson and
accused "trigger-man" Robert
Seabock, will face similar
escape-related charges in a separate
trial. Pre-trial motions in their case
began on Monday. The motions
included allegations that
"psychological isolation" is
contributing to Hobson's "mental
deterioration" and limiting her ability
to assist in her own defense. The San
Bernardino County Sheriff's office
contends they are holding Hobson and
Seabock in nearly total isolation for
security reasons.
Last week in the Burts' trial, Beaty
admitted under cross-examination that
he had lied to a federal grand jury in
his description of the aftermath of the
escape. But he also testified that it was
"common gossip" among prison
guards and inmates that the Burts have
offered a $10,000 price for his death.

"psychological isolation" is
contributing to Hobson's "mental
deterioration" and limiting her ability
to assist in her own defense. The San
Bernardino County Sheriff's office
contends they are holding Hobson and
Seabock in nearly total isolation for
security reasons.
Last week in the Burts' trial, Beaty
admitted under cross-examination that
he had lied to a federal grand jury in
his description of the aftermath of the
escape. But he also testified that it was
"common gossip" among prison
guards and inmates that the Burts have
offered a $10,000 price for his death.
Three witnesses testified this week
that they saw Andrea Holman Burt
and Benton Douglas Burt at or near
the scene of the Oct. 6 ambush-murder
that freed convict Ronald Beaty.
The Burts are on trial in San
Bernardino for murder, assault, and
rescue (removing a prisoner from
custody) in the escape, which took
place near the California Institution
for Men at Chino, at which Beaty was
an inmate.
Martha Veldhuizen, said Monday in
San Bernardino County Superior
Court that she heard gunshots on the
day of the escape and saw Douglas
Burt from the window of her home
near the ambush scene.
When Deputy District Attorney
Joseph D. Canty asked Veldhuizen if
she recognized anyone in the
courtroom from that day, the
housewife pointed to Douglas Burt
and said, "Yes, that's him right there."
California Highway Patrolman
Keith Hittson testified on Monday
that he saw two cars which have been
linked to the escape in the vicinity
where the incident took place on the
morning of Oct. 6. and identified
Andrea Holman Burt, the daughter of
Medicine Prof. Halsted Holman, as the
driver of one of the cars.
He also said he saw a man who
resembled Douglas Burt, but added he
couldn't make a positive
identification.
Testimony Challenged
Hittson's testimony came after
Judge Thomas Haldorsen denied a
defense motion to prevent Hittson's
testimony. Defense attorney Charles

Garry had challenged the admissability
of the officer's testimony, questioning
the circumstances under which Hittson
wrote his report of the event.
Hittson said he did not realize the
vehicles he saw were involved in a
crime until he read a newspaper
account of the incident and saw a
picture of Andrea Holman Burt on
Oct. 26, nearly three weeks after the
event.
He later filed a report which he
wrote in pencil on a day when he had
a bad cold. The sheriff's office
subsequently destroyed the original
report and Hittson's account was
incorporated in another document.
Alleged Inconsistencies
During cross-examination, Garry
attempted to show inconsistencies
between the patrolman's earlier
reports and his court testimony about
the ambush vehicles and their
occupants.
A part-time employee of a
hardware store in the Chino area
testified Tuesday that he sold bolt
cutters to Andrea Holman Burt prior
to the escape.
Yesterday telephone company
official Richard Steinbach answered
the prosecutor's questions about
phone calls Beaty made to the Burts
and others he implicated in the escape
plan. Garry will cross-examine
Steinbach on Tuesday. Today Vivian
Ferrera. the landlady of the Havward
apartment where the Burts lived prior
to their arrest, will take the witness
stand.
Two others implicated by Beaty's
testimony last week, former
Venceremos member Jean Hobson and
accused "trigger-man" Robert
Seabock, will face similar
escape-related charges in a separate
trial. Pre-trial motions in their case
began on Monday. The motions
included allegations that
"psychological isolation" is
contributing to Hobson's "mental
deterioration" and limiting her ability
to assist in her own defense. The San
Bernardino County Sheriff's office
contends they are holding Hobson and
Seabock in nearly total isolation for
