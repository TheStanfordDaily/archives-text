From The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - Elliot L. Richardson
received overwhelming Senate approval
yesterday to be the new attorney
general. The action freed the special
Watergate prosecutor to begin business
officially.
Richardson's confirmation, by a
vote of 82 to 3, gave him his third top
Cabinet post under Nixon. Richardson
has been secretary of Health,
Education and Welfare and secretary of
Defense. He also served as
undersecretary of State.
Earlier in the day, Richardson had
been approved unanimously by the
Senate Judiciary Committee.
His Senate approval amounts to a

go-ahead signal for Archibald Cox, the
man named by Richardson as special
Watergate prosecutor. As one of his
first acts, Cox had planned a meeting
with the regular prosecutors who have
been pursuing the Watergate case for
11 months.
CIA — Poor Judgment
In another Watergate development,
James R. Schlesinger, director of the
Central Intelligence Agency, said he
believes there was a combination of
poor judgment by CIA officials who
became involved in the Watergate
developments and overzealousness by
White House aides.
Schlesinger made the comments
before he testified at a closed session

of th. Senate Armed Services
Committee.
It has since been disclosed that the
CIA gave technical assistance to E.
Howard Hunt, later convicted as a
Watergate conspirator. The assistance
was used by Hunt to engineer the
burglary of the office of a psychiatrist
treating Pentagon papers defendant
Daniel Ellsberg. CIA officials have said
they didn't know the material they
gave Hunt would be used for a
burglary.
It also has been alleged that White
House aides sought CIA assistance in
trying to stop an FBI investigation of
the movement of Republican campaign
funds through Mexico.
"There have been indications there
were a number of errors of judgment
by CIA officials made with regard to
certain requests from the White
House," Schlesinger said.
Lawyer Testifies
Meanwhile, the lawyer who
represented James W. McCord Jr. at
the Watergate trial testified yesterday
he never suggested that McCord should
blame the CIA for the break-in at
Democratic party headquarters.
In a 1 V'2-hour appearance before the
Senate Watergate committee, Gerald
Alch angrily accused his former client
of making allegations against him that
are "in some instances completely false
and in other instances have been
twisted out of context into untruths"
to serve some unknown purpose.
"What kind of man is this?" Alch
said he asked himself after McCord

accused him last Friday of pressing the
CIA defense.
Alch outlined a relationship that
ranged from effusive praise to
unanswered telephone calls and finally
replacement after McCord's
conspiracy-burglary-wiretap conviction
with attorney Bernard W. Fensterwald
Jr., representing him. And, with
Fensterwald sitting a few rows behind
him, Alch quoted Fensterwald as
saying at one point:
"We're going after the President of
the United States."
Caulfield-Alch At Odds
Earlier, the senators heard two
former White House employees say
they knew they were breaking the law
by relaying executive clemency offers
to McCord in the midst of the trial.
John J. Caulfield said he was
spurred on in the belief that President
Nixon had made the offer.
But Alch said he was totally
ignorant of it if such offers were made.
McCord had said that he received
executive clemency offers repeatedly,
from Caulfield and fellow Watergate
defendant E. Howard Hunt — dating
back to September 1972.
McCord was in the hearing room
during part of the time Alch was
reading his statement, then retired to a
stairwell to read a copy.
Fensterwald approached chairman
Sam J. Ervin (D-N.C.), when the
committee recessed for the day and
asked that he and McCord be
permitted to testify Thursday morning
in response.
