# Among 12 Cagers Named
## Kelley Selected For China Tour 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Stanford sophomore center Rich
Kelley is one of 12 basketball players
selected for a goodwill tour of the
People's Republic of China, the Daily
has learned.
Official announcement of the
squad, which will play eight exhibition
games against Chinese teams from
June 16 to July 5, is expected today in
Washington, D.C.
The basketball team is one of two
groups of American athletes scheduled
to tour China this summer. The State
Department earlier announced that a
group of swimmers would leave for
China on June 2 for a series of
exhibitions and clinics.
Stanford swimming and water polo
coach Jim Gaughran will direct the
swimming squad, which includes
Stanford swim captain Brian Job and
five other former Olympians.
Arranged By Kissinger
Both tours are apparently the result
of cultural exchange discussions
between Henry Kissinger and the
Chinese government during Kissinger's
visit to China.
Kelley, who averaged 17.3 points
and 13.2 rebounds for Stanford this
season and was a first team All-Pacific
Eight selection, will leave on June 4
for Memphis, where the team will
practice for nine days under the
direction of Memphis State University
coach Gene Bartow.
Bartow and the team will then leave
for Hong Kong on June 13 before
arriving in China on June 16. The
Americans will play eight exhibition
games during their three week stay and
return to the United States on July 8.
Bartow, whose Memphis State team
lost to UCLA in this year's NCAA
finals, told Kelley yesterday that "this
is a friendship tour." But he also
indicated that the team would be

playing serious basketball.
'Friendship First'
"There is a Chinese slogan that goes
'Friendship first, competition
second,'" Bartow told the
seven-footer from Menlo Park. "But
I'm a much friendlier guy if I'm
winning."
Some of the other top players
named to the squad include Larry
Finch and Ronnie Robinson of

Memphis State, John Schumate of
Notre Dame, Alvin Adams of
Oklahoma State, Kevin Stacom of
Providence, and North Carolina's
George Karl.
Athletic diplomacy between the
United States and China began in
April, 1971, when a team of American
table tennis players visited China for a
series of exhibitions against the
Chinese team.

Athletic diplomacy between the
United States and China began in
April, 1971, when a team of American
table tennis players visited China for a
series of exhibitions against the
Chinese team.

OFF TO CHINA — Sophomore Rich Kelley, shown here moving against UCLA's
Bill Walton during the Bruins' 51-45 victory over the Cards in March, was one
of 12 American basketball players selected for a goodwill tour of China next
month. The seven-foot center earned first team all-league honors for his
performance during the 1972-73 Pac-8 season.
Stanford sophomore center Rich
Kelley is one of 12 basketball players
selected for a goodwill tour of the
People's Republic of China, the Daily
has learned.
Official announcement of the
squad, which will play eight exhibition
games against Chinese teams from
June 16 to July 5, is expected today in
Washington, D.C.
The basketball team is one of two
groups of American athletes scheduled
to tour China this summer. The State
Department earlier announced that a
group of swimmers would leave for
China on June 2 for a series of
exhibitions and clinics.
Stanford swimming and water polo
coach Jim Gaughran will direct the
swimming squad, which includes
Stanford swim captain Brian Job and
five other former Olympians.
Arranged By Kissinger
Both tours are apparently the result
of cultural exchange discussions
between Henry Kissinger and the
Chinese government during Kissinger's
visit to China.
Kelley, who averaged 17.3 points
and 13.2 rebounds for Stanford this
season and was a first team All-Pacific
Eight selection, will leave on June 4
for Memphis, where the team will
practice for nine days under the
direction of Memphis State University
coach Gene Bartow.
Bartow and the team will then leave
for Hong Kong on June 13 before
arriving in China on June 16. The
Americans will play eight exhibition
games during their three week stay and
return to the United States on July 8.
Bartow, whose Memphis State team
lost to UCLA in this year's NCAA
finals, told Kelley yesterday that "this
is a friendship tour." But he also
indicated that the team would be

playing serious basketball.
'Friendship First'
"There is a Chinese slogan that goes
'Friendship first, competition
second,'" Bartow told the
seven-footer from Menlo Park. "But
I'm a much friendlier guy if I'm
winning."
Some of the other top players
named to the squad include Larry
Finch and Ronnie Robinson of

Memphis State, John Schumate of
Notre Dame, Alvin Adams of
Oklahoma State, Kevin Stacom of
Providence, and North Carolina's
George Karl.
