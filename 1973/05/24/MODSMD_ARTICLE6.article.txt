## 'Safeway Stores 
### 
After five years of the grape strike and boycott, most
major table grape growers signed contracts with Cesar
Chavez's young United Farm Workers union. Among the
progressive gains achieved were an end to favoritism through
closed shop labor contracting; an end to summary firings; a
prohibition against dangerous pesticides harmful to the
health of farm workers and consumers; and a medical plan
providing maternity care, doctor visits, and medicine.
Now, at the third expiration of those hard-won contracts,
the gains of the UFW are being voided as growers rush to the
backdoor to sign contracts with the Teamsters Union. Such
restrictive contracts remove the worker's freedom of choice
•to select which union representation he or she desires.
Indeed, the curious entry of the Teamsters into farm labor
representation has been characterized by an unlabor-like
alliance with growers on issues such as pesticide control, job
security, and closed hiring halls. As George Meany, president
of the AFL-CIO, observed regarding a recent agreement, the
Teamsters "signed a sweetheart contract that the court
kicked out so they went in and signed a super sweetheart
contract. And the purpose of that contract is to destroy the
Farm Workers Union.'"
The issues, again, are table grapes from the Coachella
Valley, and iceberg lettuce. But the UFW has a new target to
bring meaningful, effective representation of those who
must toil in the fields: a boycott of the Safeway
supermarket chains.
The rationale for a Safeway boycott is simple: as the
nation's largest chain of food stores, Safeway buys 25
percent of all lettuce picked in California. If pressure can be
brought to bear against the giant chain UFW-contract
growers will have a major buyer for their products.
At present, Safeway's disposition towards union products
is unclear. For several years, the chain intentionally avoided
stocking UFW products if non-UFW goods were available.
The policy was something more than "benign neglect,"
however, giant agribusinessman J.G. Boswell is a member of
the Safeway Board of Directors and hardly a friend of the
UFW.
Whether or not a chain-wide ban still exists against UFW
goods is not known. Some stores — for example, in San Jose
- have intermittently stocked UFW products, but this
concession came after weeks of boycott picketing. But in
general, Safeway has avoided UFW goods not because of
price, but because it objects to farm workers being
represented by Chavez's union.
In addition to the decision of the San Jose stores to stock
UFW goods, the boycott has produced other encouraging
signs. Last Tuesday, Safeway Board Chairman Quentin
Reynolds met with Chavez, the first time the chain has
consented to deal so directly with the union.
Just as the boycott of grapes and lettuce was and still is
for farm workers to obtain justice for their labors, so, too, a
boycott of Safeway stores is a legitimate and meaningful way
for the public to show its disapproval of backdoor labor
contracting. Until farm workers can freely choose which
union they want to represent them, there can be no true
freedom for farm workers. We urge a boycott of Safeway
stores until grievances can be properly resolved.
