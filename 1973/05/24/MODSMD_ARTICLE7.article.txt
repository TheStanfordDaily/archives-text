# Scourge Of War
## Gibbon's Future? 
### 
Dr. Shirley McGreal

Young people all over the
world have been protesting the
slaughter of human beings in
Indochina. Defenders of the war
claim that both sides do terrible
things and turn their thoughts to
something else. Yet their is one
aspect of the Asian devastation in
which the U.S. military is
unrivalled, and this is the
destruction of the environment
and wildlife of Indochina. Even
those who accept the principle of
slaughtering people who do not
choose to accept the Watergate
Way of Life would be hard put to
devise a rationale for the
destruction of the birds and
animals of the area.
The great anthropoid apes, the
gorillas, orangutans and
chimpanzees, have long held the
imagination of the world. Yet
there is an equally fascinating

smaller ape, the gibbon, and he
lives exclusively in the jungles and
cloud-forests of Southeast Asia
and the nearby islands.
The gibbon is the most agile
acrobat in the animal kingdom
and it is a spectacular sight to see
a group of gibbons arm swinging
through the trees or running
upright, outstretched, with their
slender hips swaying from side to
side. The gibbon lives almost
entirely on fruit, leaves and
vegetables, and has only one
enemy — man.
Cousins
The subspecies of gibbon is the
White-Cheeked Gibbon; he lives in
Laos, and his cousin, the
Gabriella, lives in Vietnam. Both
have suffered from the war —
directly and indirectly.
1) Many have been roasted

alive, napalmed or crippled by
falling bombs.
2) Defoliation has wrecked
their habitat.
3) Herbicides have poisoned
the leaves which are the basis of
their diet.
4) Arms have been issued to
civilians, the recipients are
supposed to shoot a "commie"
but more often, kill a gibbon for
dinner or to steal its baby for
export.
Endangered or Extinct?
The Pileated Gibbon has been
on the Endangered List since
1970. The adult male is black
with a striking white cap and the
female has a beautiful black V on
her chest and a black cap; her fur
is brown. This delightful animal
has the misfortune to live in
Cambodia, and by the time the
bombing stops, may well have
moved from the Endangered to
the Extinct List.
Another gibbon, the
White-Handed Gibbon lives in
Thailand, so perhaps he will be
the next to go.
Other primates in the
Indochina area include monkeys
and prosimians: One of the most
beautiful monkeys is the Douc
Langur; this graceful animal is
now almost extinct as a result of
the war.
Superactive Animals
Gibbons are superactive
animals, full of fun. Their hooting
and calling brings life to the
forests of Southeast Asia. They
have taken millions of years to
evolve, and once the last
White-Cheeked or Pileated
Gibbons have disappeared, there
will be no way to bring them
back.
Eliott Richardson has stated
tht he will continue the bombing
of Cambodia regardless of what
the American elected
representatives think. Could this
mean that the United States is, in
spite of a framework of "liberty"
a quasi-dictatorship? Is there any
way to save the gibbon and the
other primates of Southeast Asia?

is here organizing a Primate
Protection League.)
