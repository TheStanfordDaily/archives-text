# Judge Denies Dismissal Motion In Franklin's Reinstatement Case
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
H. Bruce Franklin, fired associate
professor of English, yesterday won
the first round in his reinstatement
lawsuit against the University.
Santa Clara County Superior Court
Judge Joseph P. Kelly denied two
University motions which sought a
judgment against Franklin without a
full-scale trial.
Franklin's attorneys will now begin
preparations for a trial on the merits
of the case, but University officials
indicated that they may appeal Kelly's
decision to an appellate court.
Franklin was dismissed in January
1972 for his role in fomenting campus
disruptions in February 1971.
Advisory Board
Kelly's 15-page opinion, issued in
San Jose yesterday, held that the
findings of the faculty Advisory Board
which recommended Franklin's
dismissal do not settle the matter for
the courts.
"This Court has decided its duty in
this case is not simply to review the
record of the Advisory Board
proceedings but to accord plaintiff
[Franklin] plenary trial of the facts.
The Board's decision cannot be
consulted as a source of facts because
it is hearsay," the opinion stated.
Kelly also ruled that the University
had not convinced him that Franklin
was fired wholly in accordance with
provisions of his employment contract
with Stanford.
He pointed to state laws which
prevent an employer from regulating
his employees' political activity, and
said that the briefs in the case were
not conclusive as to whether
Franklin's activities were entitled to
protection under those laws.
Outrageous
Franklin said that Kelly's decision
"shows that Stanford's position is so
outrageous that even the Santa Clara
County court has to throw it out of
court."
"There's no question on which side
the law stands. There's no question
that my firing was illegal under any

fair-minded reading of the
Constitution. But getting a court to
rule against Stanford and in favor of
the right of a Communist
revolutionary to have a job at a
university is a different matter," he
added.
Charles Marson, Legal Director of
the Northern California American Civil
Liberties Union, counsel for Franklin
in the case, called Kelly's decision
"courageous and correct."

He said that his office would
proceed with preparation for the trial,
gathering facts both about the
incidents surrounding Franklin's firing
and about Stanford's connection with
federal and state governments.
One of Franklin's contentions is
that Stanford's ties — especially
financial — to government agencies
make it a public body and entitle him
to the same protections a public
employee would receive. The

University's brief vigorously took issue
with that claim.
Kelly reserved that issue for the
trial.
Marson said that he would file the
first "discovery motion" seeking such
facts from Stanford, next week. He
expected the entire process to take
several months — "partly it depends
on how fast we can work, and partly
on how hard Stanford resists," he

indicated.
Lyman Disappointed
University President Richard
Lyman expressed his disappointment
at the decision.
"The most troubling aspect of the
court's ruling is its suggestion that the
University's own processes for judging

the behavior of faculty are to be given
no weight at all," he said.
'The result of this conclusion, if it
stands, would be to subvert hard-won
principles of faculty self-government
and academic independence," he
added.
San Francisco attorney David M.
Heilbron, who represents the
University in the case, had not seen
the text of Kelly's decision yesterday
and declined substantive comment.
Kelly in effect invited the
University to seek appellate review of
one aspect of yesterday's decision.
He stated in his opinion that he
could find no precednets as to
whether, if Stanford is held to be a
public agency, the Advisory Board's
findings of fact should be presumed
correct in the way a public
administrative agency's would be.
Kelly decided the issue in favor of
Franklin by holding that the Advisory
Board's 168-page decision was not to
be presumed correct, but he called
attention to the fact that there were
no available precedents and said "it
may be appropriate for the parties to
consider seeking extraordinary review"
in the appellate courts.
The suit was filed last August 15,
and argued before Kelly on March 2.
Franklin alleged in the suit that his
speeches on Feb. 10, 1971 did not
violate his contract with the University
and that they were protected by the
first amendment to the U.S.
Constitution.
He insisted that because of his
firing he "has suffered the loss of his
career ... and professional ostracism."

indicated.
Lyman Disappointed
University President Richard
Lyman expressed his disappointment
at the decision.
"The most troubling aspect of the
court's ruling is its suggestion that the
University's own processes for judging

the behavior of faculty are to be given
no weight at all," he said.
'The result of this conclusion, if it
stands, would be to subvert hard-won
principles of faculty self-government
and academic independence," he
added.
San Francisco attorney David M.
Heilbron, who represents the
University in the case, had not seen
the text of Kelly's decision yesterday
and declined substantive comment.
Kelly in effect invited the
University to seek appellate review of
one aspect of yesterday's decision.
He stated in his opinion that he
could find no precednets as to
whether, if Stanford is held to be a
public agency, the Advisory Board's
findings of fact should be presumed
correct in the way a public
administrative agency's would be.
Kelly decided the issue in favor of
Franklin by holding that the Advisory
Board's 168-page decision was not to
be presumed correct, but he called
attention to the fact that there were
no available precedents and said "it
may be appropriate for the parties to
consider seeking extraordinary review"
in the appellate courts.
The suit was filed last August 15,
and argued before Kelly on March 2.
Franklin alleged in the suit that his
speeches on Feb. 10, 1971 did not
violate his contract with the University
and that they were protected by the
first amendment to the U.S.
Constitution.
He insisted that because of his
firing he "has suffered the loss of his
career ... and professional ostracism."
H. Bruce Franklin, fired associate
professor of English, yesterday won
the first round in his reinstatement
lawsuit against the University.
Santa Clara County Superior Court
Judge Joseph P. Kelly denied two
University motions which sought a
judgment against Franklin without a
full-scale trial.
Franklin's attorneys will now begin
preparations for a trial on the merits
of the case, but University officials
indicated that they may appeal Kelly's
decision to an appellate court.
Franklin was dismissed in January
1972 for his role in fomenting campus
disruptions in February 1971.
Advisory Board
Kelly's 15-page opinion, issued in
San Jose yesterday, held that the
findings of the faculty Advisory Board
which recommended Franklin's
dismissal do not settle the matter for
the courts.
"This Court has decided its duty in
this case is not simply to review the
record of the Advisory Board
proceedings but to accord plaintiff
[Franklin] plenary trial of the facts.
The Board's decision cannot be
consulted as a source of facts because
it is hearsay," the opinion stated.
Kelly also ruled that the University
had not convinced him that Franklin
was fired wholly in accordance with
provisions of his employment contract
with Stanford.
He pointed to state laws which
prevent an employer from regulating
his employees' political activity, and
said that the briefs in the case were
not conclusive as to whether
Franklin's activities were entitled to
protection under those laws.
Outrageous
Franklin said that Kelly's decision
"shows that Stanford's position is so
outrageous that even the Santa Clara
County court has to throw it out of
court."
"There's no question on which side
the law stands. There's no question
that my firing was illegal under any

fair-minded reading of the
Constitution. But getting a court to
rule against Stanford and in favor of
the right of a Communist
revolutionary to have a job at a
university is a different matter," he
added.
Charles Marson, Legal Director of
the Northern California American Civil
Liberties Union, counsel for Franklin
in the case, called Kelly's decision
"courageous and correct."

He said that his office would
proceed with preparation for the trial,
gathering facts both about the
incidents surrounding Franklin's firing
and about Stanford's connection with
federal and state governments.
One of Franklin's contentions is
that Stanford's ties — especially
financial — to government agencies
make it a public body and entitle him
to the same protections a public
employee would receive. The

University's brief vigorously took issue
with that claim.
Kelly reserved that issue for the
trial.

disruptions in February 1971.
Advisory Board
Kelly's 15-page opinion, issued in
San Jose yesterday, held that the
findings of the faculty Advisory Board
which recommended Franklin's
dismissal do not settle the matter for
the courts.
"This Court has decided its duty in
this case is not simply to review the
record of the Advisory Board
proceedings but to accord plaintiff
[Franklin] plenary trial of the facts.
The Board's decision cannot be
consulted as a source of facts because
it is hearsay," the opinion stated.
Kelly also ruled that the University
had not convinced him that Franklin
was fired wholly in accordance with
provisions of his employment contract
with Stanford.
He pointed to state laws which
prevent an employer from regulating
his employees' political activity, and
said that the briefs in the case were
not conclusive as to whether
Franklin's activities were entitled to
protection under those laws.
Outrageous
Franklin said that Kelly's decision
"shows that Stanford's position is so
outrageous that even the Santa Clara
County court has to throw it out of
court."
"There's no question on which side
the law stands. There's no question
that my firing was illegal under any

fair-minded reading of the
Constitution. But getting a court to
rule against Stanford and in favor of
the right of a Communist
revolutionary to have a job at a
university is a different matter," he
added.
Charles Marson, Legal Director of
the Northern California American Civil
Liberties Union, counsel for Franklin
in the case, called Kelly's decision
"courageous and correct."

He said that his office would
proceed with preparation for the trial,
gathering facts both about the
incidents surrounding Franklin's firing
and about Stanford's connection with
federal and state governments.
One of Franklin's contentions is
that Stanford's ties — especially
financial — to government agencies
make it a public body and entitle him
to the same protections a public
employee would receive. The

University's brief vigorously took issue
with that claim.
Kelly reserved that issue for the
trial.
Marson said that he would file the
first "discovery motion" seeking such
facts from Stanford, next week. He
expected the entire process to take
several months — "partly it depends
on how fast we can work, and partly
on how hard Stanford resists," he

REINSTATEMENT SUIT — Fired English Prof. H. Bruce Franklin, seen
speaking to a February 26 Palo Alto City Council meeting, won the first round
in his lawsuit to regain his job. A Santa Clara County Superior Court judge
rejected University motions for summary judgment in its favor.
indicated.
Lyman Disappointed
University President Richard
Lyman expressed his disappointment
at the decision.
"The most troubling aspect of the
court's ruling is its suggestion that the
University's own processes for judging

the behavior of faculty are to be given
no weight at all," he said.
'The result of this conclusion, if it
stands, would be to subvert hard-won
principles of faculty self-government
and academic independence," he
added.
San Francisco attorney David M.
Heilbron, who represents the
University in the case, had not seen
the text of Kelly's decision yesterday
and declined substantive comment.
Kelly in effect invited the
University to seek appellate review of
one aspect of yesterday's decision.
He stated in his opinion that he
could find no precednets as to
whether, if Stanford is held to be a
public agency, the Advisory Board's
findings of fact should be presumed
correct in the way a public
administrative agency's would be.
Kelly decided the issue in favor of
Franklin by holding that the Advisory
Board's 168-page decision was not to
be presumed correct, but he called
attention to the fact that there were
no available precedents and said "it
may be appropriate for the parties to
consider seeking extraordinary review"
in the appellate courts.
The suit was filed last August 15,
and argued before Kelly on March 2.
Franklin alleged in the suit that his
speeches on Feb. 10, 1971 did not
violate his contract with the University
and that they were protected by the
first amendment to the U.S.
Constitution.
He insisted that because of his
firing he "has suffered the loss of his
career ... and professional ostracism."
