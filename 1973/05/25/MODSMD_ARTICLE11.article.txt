# A 						Monopoly And Its Employees
## Food Service Hashers: Unionize! 
### 
Jim Buser

Meal hours for a student on
campus are generally considered a
time to eat and relax in an
easy-going, social atmosphere.
Hashers, too, share this student
perspective and are motivated to
mak the meal hours enjoyable.
Unfortunately, the policies of
the Food Service bureaucrats
destroy this desired relaxed
atmosphere for both hashers and
their fellow students by
establishing an unnecessary and
uncomfortable business-like
atmosphere.
I hope to utilize the insights
and perspectives I have gained
from four years of hashing,
supplemented with the various
viewpoints of the hashers and

students I work with at Wilbur to
illuminate the absurdities of many
of the Food Service's peculiar
policies. My perspective is, of
course, limited to Wilbur, but
despite managerial differences
between different complexes, I
am assuming that many University
Food Service policies are
unpopular on a campus-wide
basis. All of the topics to be
covered have already been futilely
criticized within the framework of
the Food Service itself, and these
comments are cynically submitted
to the Daily as a last resort. It is
also significant that many of these
comments, felt by many hashers,
have to be publicly aired by a
graduating senior — job security

has a way of inhibiting hasher
criticism.
Brainstorm
The recent Food Serivce
brainstorm which periodically
requires meal card checkers to
literally hold in his hand and
scrutinize each and every
student's I.D. card (sometimes
referred to as "Gestapo Day") is
perhaps, of all the Food Service
policies, the greatest annoyance to
students and hashers. The idea
was conceived by well-intentioned
managers to curb the rate of meal
rip-offs through phony meal
tickets (whicn is actually a
primitive and infrequent method
of food rip-offs, anyway).
While the idea has some merit
at the beginning of the year or
when the checker is otherwise
unfamiliar with his line, this
system turns invO a farce for the
regular checker on the line. One
obvious fault with this system is
that it slows down the service, but
the major problem is its
harassment element. When the
"regulars" come through a line,
why should a checker demand, as
a hard-ass sergeant would, that a
person remove his meal ticket
from his wallet cellophane, when
he's seen the damn card all year,
and if he's a good checker, knows
who that person is?
Amazingly, to promote this
business-like uniformity, checkers
are even instructed to clutch cards
in the same impersonal,
machine-like manner from other
hashers who they are undoubtedly
acquainted with, and who are
highly unlikely to be stealing
food! This ridiculous policy forces
the checker, if he values his job,
to become very impersonal and
authoritarian with the people he's
supposed to be "serving," creating
undesired poor relations between
red-coats and students. The
people who suffer from this
arrangement are not the
freeloaders who simply try
another method of getting food,
but the regular students who use
the line and the poor checker who
gets shit from both the
management and the student.
Hashers As Children
Implicit in the development of
this particular policy, and many
other gems, is the managerial
perception of hashers (and thus,
students) as children. They want
to be certain each checker is
holding every card in his hand,
regardless of its familiarity,
presumably because without these
precautions, the checkers would
be totally incapable of performing
the simple tasks of matching faces
and checking labels. Maybe all
students look alike to those
nebulous powers that designed
this system, and they failed to
consider that students could
actually easily differentiate
between and remember other
students' faces.
The best alternative to the
present system is, as in the old
system, to have the checker
exercise discretion in how
carefully he examines each card.
It might also be advisable to select
a checker from the dorms he's
serving. The people a checker is
certain are legitimate should not
be subjected to a customs search
— whereas unfamiliar faces should
receive closer investigation (which
should not upset the stranger,
either, since he would not expect
the checker to know him).
After all, since the red coats
are supposedly selected for their
trustworthiness and reliability,
why should not these skills be
exercised in performing their job?
Dress
Unreasonable dress standards
are another problem a hasher has
to contend with, as do the people

who get sub-par service from an
irritable hasher who is dressed like
a polar bear serving hot food on a
nice spring day. The same kind of
meaningless dress standards that
were halted during the days of
high school student activism have
been resurrected for this
University's hashers. Regardless of
the temperature, white-coat
hashers are expected to button
their top, choke-collar button,
while red coats must wear a tie
and a long-sleeved, heavy red coat.
Hashers have only recently
been permitted to wear bermudas,
but "sloppy" cut-offs are still
forbidden as are any "unusual" or
"messy" dress styles, or any
innovations, such as hat
decorations. The powers that be in
the Food Service do not justify
these standards with health
regulations, which would be
difficult to criticize (though easy
to ignore), but rather with the
notion that hashers should present
a "neat, uniform image." This
image might be appropriate for a
convention of retired
businessmen, or in a prison, but to
serve the Stanford student body,
which prides itself on its
individuality, such conformist
dress regulations are totally
incongruous.
In fact, I am confident that
hashers and students alike would
benefit if the hashers were
allowed to express their
originality in altering their
uniforms, provided their work was
not interfered with. One need
only look at the high morale and
student popularity of the
Band. .. .
Promotions
The promotion system within
the Food Service is another major
grievance among hashers. Instead
of seniority and performance,
intangibles such as "attitude" and
"neatness" are the most
significant determinants in
promoting hashers to the
"responsibility-laden" red coat
positions.
Unfortunately, there is a
tendency among ambitious young
hashers to try to "impress"
managers (stronger terminology
will be avoided), something which
a shy but competent person, or
the poor guys who have been
stuck in the breakfast dishroom,
are unable to do. Though I believe
most managers are sincere and
conscientious in their appraising
of hashers, the unwanted variable
of their personal biases still exists.
How can the Food Service
claim that, on the basis of
subjectively-evaluated neatness
and attitude, one hasher is more
qualified than another to count
meal tickets or stack coffee cups?
Assuming that most Stanford
students are, indeed, capable of
meeting the stringent demands of
red coat jobs, a pure seniority
promotion system, which is
employed by the libraries, seems
to be the fairest alternative
system.
Role
The central issue involved in all
of these problems is the ambiguity
of the role of the Food Service.
Diplomatically, they pretend to
be a student service, responsive to
the wishes and ideas of the
students they serve; yet, on
another level, they are a
hard-nosed business, rigidly
controlling their employees, as
they enjoy their monopolistic
position.
If the Food Service is truly
interested in behaving like a
business, they could certainly
improve their efficiency and
budgeting: many "easy-money"
red coat jobs could be altered or
eliminated, while many sources of
food waste (unpopular dishes,

etc.) could be investigated.
However, the Food Service seems
ill-prepared to compete with their
commercial rivals in either cost or
product. Instead, its redeeming
value is based on its functioning as
a student service, providing
unlimited seconds, a central
location, and ideally, a pleasant
atmosphere.
Why then, is there such a
glaring communication gap
between the students and the
Food Service bureaucrats which
has resulted in policies which
unnecessarily harass students and
which establish inappropriate
dress and behavior standards for
hashers?
Unionize
The answer lies, I believe, in
the absence of a student-oriented
body to work in conjunction with
the Food Service policy-makers.
The Food Service will be quick to
point out that student committees
to taste food, etc. have been
failures, due to the tendency of
students to lose interest in the
meetings and their failue to make
proposals within the capabilities
of the Food Service. A better
solution for this need would be
the creation of a hashers union,
which would have the advantage
of providing a student voice which
is already knowledgeable about
and involved with the Food
Service.
Sadly, though, the power
structure within the Food Service
takes a dim view of this idea. As
older hashers will attest, several
attempts to create a hashers union
in the past have been met with
hasher immobility, through fear
of their jobs, and have resulted in
the instigators being fired, or
exiled to weekend dishroom
shifts.
Nevertheless, several factors,
not present in the previous
attempts, would increase the
probability of a hashers union not
being taken so lightly:
campus-wide hasher organization,
hasher determination, and student
pressure. Hopefully, younger
hashers with similar inclinations
can find the energy and
motivation to establish this
much-needed organization in the
upcoming year.

undesired poor relations between
red-coats and students. The
people who suffer from this
arrangement are not the
freeloaders who simply try
another method of getting food,
but the regular students who use
the line and the poor checker who
gets shit from both the
management and the student.
Hashers As Children
Implicit in the development of
this particular policy, and many
other gems, is the managerial
perception of hashers (and thus,
students) as children. They want
to be certain each checker is
holding every card in his hand,
regardless of its familiarity,
presumably because without these
precautions, the checkers would
be totally incapable of performing
the simple tasks of matching faces
and checking labels. Maybe all
students look alike to those
nebulous powers that designed
this system, and they failed to
consider that students could
actually easily differentiate
between and remember other
students' faces.
The best alternative to the
present system is, as in the old
system, to have the checker
exercise discretion in how
carefully he examines each card.
It might also be advisable to select
a checker from the dorms he's
serving. The people a checker is
certain are legitimate should not
be subjected to a customs search
— whereas unfamiliar faces should
receive closer investigation (which
should not upset the stranger,
either, since he would not expect
the checker to know him).
After all, since the red coats
are supposedly selected for their
trustworthiness and reliability,
why should not these skills be
exercised in performing their job?
Dress
Unreasonable dress standards
are another problem a hasher has
to contend with, as do the people

who get sub-par service from an
irritable hasher who is dressed like
a polar bear serving hot food on a
nice spring day. The same kind of
meaningless dress standards that
were halted during the days of
high school student activism have
been resurrected for this
University's hashers. Regardless of
the temperature, white-coat
hashers are expected to button
their top, choke-collar button,
while red coats must wear a tie
and a long-sleeved, heavy red coat.
Hashers have only recently
been permitted to wear bermudas,
but "sloppy" cut-offs are still
forbidden as are any "unusual" or
"messy" dress styles, or any
innovations, such as hat
decorations. The powers that be in
the Food Service do not justify
these standards with health
regulations, which would be
difficult to criticize (though easy
to ignore), but rather with the
notion that hashers should present
a "neat, uniform image." This
image might be appropriate for a
convention of retired
businessmen, or in a prison, but to
serve the Stanford student body,
which prides itself on its
individuality, such conformist
dress regulations are totally
incongruous.
In fact, I am confident that
hashers and students alike would
benefit if the hashers were
allowed to express their
originality in altering their
uniforms, provided their work was
not interfered with. One need
only look at the high morale and
student popularity of the
Band. .. .
Promotions
The promotion system within
the Food Service is another major
grievance among hashers. Instead
of seniority and performance,
intangibles such as "attitude" and
"neatness" are the most
significant determinants in
promoting hashers to the
"responsibility-laden" red coat
positions.
Unfortunately, there is a
tendency among ambitious young
hashers to try to "impress"
managers (stronger terminology
will be avoided), something which
a shy but competent person, or
the poor guys who have been
stuck in the breakfast dishroom,
are unable to do. Though I believe
most managers are sincere and
conscientious in their appraising
of hashers, the unwanted variable
of their personal biases still exists.
How can the Food Service
claim that, on the basis of
subjectively-evaluated neatness
and attitude, one hasher is more
qualified than another to count
meal tickets or stack coffee cups?
Assuming that most Stanford
students are, indeed, capable of
meeting the stringent demands of
red coat jobs, a pure seniority
promotion system, which is
employed by the libraries, seems
to be the fairest alternative
system.
Role
The central issue involved in all
of these problems is the ambiguity
of the role of the Food Service.
Diplomatically, they pretend to
be a student service, responsive to
the wishes and ideas of the
students they serve; yet, on
another level, they are a
hard-nosed business, rigidly
controlling their employees, as
they enjoy their monopolistic
position.
If the Food Service is truly
interested in behaving like a
business, they could certainly
improve their efficiency and
budgeting: many "easy-money"
red coat jobs could be altered or
eliminated, while many sources of
food waste (unpopular dishes,

etc.) could be investigated.
However, the Food Service seems
ill-prepared to compete with their
commercial rivals in either cost or
product. Instead, its redeeming
value is based on its functioning as
a student service, providing
unlimited seconds, a central
location, and ideally, a pleasant
atmosphere.
Why then, is there such a
glaring communication gap
between the students and the
Food Service bureaucrats which
has resulted in policies which
unnecessarily harass students and
which establish inappropriate
dress and behavior standards for
hashers?
Unionize
The answer lies, I believe, in
the absence of a student-oriented
body to work in conjunction with
the Food Service policy-makers.
The Food Service will be quick to
point out that student committees
to taste food, etc. have been
failures, due to the tendency of
students to lose interest in the
meetings and their failue to make
proposals within the capabilities
of the Food Service. A better
solution for this need would be
the creation of a hashers union,
which would have the advantage
of providing a student voice which
is already knowledgeable about
and involved with the Food
Service.
Sadly, though, the power
structure within the Food Service
takes a dim view of this idea. As
older hashers will attest, several
attempts to create a hashers union
in the past have been met with
hasher immobility, through fear
of their jobs, and have resulted in
the instigators being fired, or
exiled to weekend dishroom
shifts.
Nevertheless, several factors,
not present in the previous
attempts, would increase the
probability of a hashers union not
being taken so lightly:
campus-wide hasher organization,
hasher determination, and student
pressure. Hopefully, younger
hashers with similar inclinations
can find the energy and
motivation to establish this
much-needed organization in the
upcoming year.

psychology and a hasher.)

Meal hours for a student on
campus are generally considered a
time to eat and relax in an
easy-going, social atmosphere.
Hashers, too, share this student
perspective and are motivated to
mak the meal hours enjoyable.
Unfortunately, the policies of
the Food Service bureaucrats
destroy this desired relaxed
atmosphere for both hashers and
their fellow students by
establishing an unnecessary and
uncomfortable business-like
atmosphere.
I hope to utilize the insights
and perspectives I have gained
from four years of hashing,
supplemented with the various
viewpoints of the hashers and

students I work with at Wilbur to
illuminate the absurdities of many
of the Food Service's peculiar
policies. My perspective is, of
course, limited to Wilbur, but
despite managerial differences
between different complexes, I
am assuming that many University
Food Service policies are
unpopular on a campus-wide
basis. All of the topics to be
covered have already been futilely
criticized within the framework of
the Food Service itself, and these
comments are cynically submitted
to the Daily as a last resort. It is
also significant that many of these
comments, felt by many hashers,
have to be publicly aired by a
graduating senior — job security

has a way of inhibiting hasher
criticism.
Brainstorm
The recent Food Serivce
brainstorm which periodically
requires meal card checkers to
literally hold in his hand and
scrutinize each and every
student's I.D. card (sometimes
referred to as "Gestapo Day") is
perhaps, of all the Food Service
policies, the greatest annoyance to
students and hashers. The idea
was conceived by well-intentioned
managers to curb the rate of meal
rip-offs through phony meal
tickets (whicn is actually a
primitive and infrequent method
of food rip-offs, anyway).
While the idea has some merit
at the beginning of the year or
when the checker is otherwise
unfamiliar with his line, this
system turns invO a farce for the
regular checker on the line. One
obvious fault with this system is
that it slows down the service, but
the major problem is its
harassment element. When the
"regulars" come through a line,
why should a checker demand, as
a hard-ass sergeant would, that a
person remove his meal ticket
from his wallet cellophane, when
he's seen the damn card all year,
and if he's a good checker, knows
who that person is?
Amazingly, to promote this
business-like uniformity, checkers
are even instructed to clutch cards
in the same impersonal,
machine-like manner from other
hashers who they are undoubtedly
acquainted with, and who are
highly unlikely to be stealing
food! This ridiculous policy forces
the checker, if he values his job,
to become very impersonal and
authoritarian with the people he's
supposed to be "serving," creating
undesired poor relations between
red-coats and students. The
people who suffer from this
arrangement are not the
freeloaders who simply try
another method of getting food,

allowed to express their
originality in altering their
uniforms, provided their work was
not interfered with. One need
only look at the high morale and
student popularity of the
Band. .. .
Promotions
The promotion system within
the Food Service is another major
grievance among hashers. Instead
of seniority and performance,
intangibles such as "attitude" and
"neatness" are the most
significant determinants in
promoting hashers to the
"responsibility-laden" red coat
positions.
Unfortunately, there is a
tendency among ambitious young
hashers to try to "impress"
managers (stronger terminology
will be avoided), something which
a shy but competent person, or
the poor guys who have been
stuck in the breakfast dishroom,
are unable to do. Though I believe
most managers are sincere and
conscientious in their appraising
of hashers, the unwanted variable
of their personal biases still exists.
How can the Food Service
claim that, on the basis of
subjectively-evaluated neatness
and attitude, one hasher is more
qualified than another to count
meal tickets or stack coffee cups?
Assuming that most Stanford
students are, indeed, capable of
meeting the stringent demands of
red coat jobs, a pure seniority
promotion system, which is
employed by the libraries, seems
to be the fairest alternative
system.
Role
The central issue involved in all
of these problems is the ambiguity
of the role of the Food Service.
Diplomatically, they pretend to
be a student service, responsive to
the wishes and ideas of the
students they serve; yet, on
another level, they are a
hard-nosed business, rigidly
controlling their employees, as
they enjoy their monopolistic
position.
If the Food Service is truly
interested in behaving like a
business, they could certainly
improve their efficiency and
budgeting: many "easy-money"
red coat jobs could be altered or
eliminated, while many sources of
food waste (unpopular dishes,

etc.) could be investigated.
However, the Food Service seems
ill-prepared to compete with their
commercial rivals in either cost or
product. Instead, its redeeming
value is based on its functioning as
a student service, providing
unlimited seconds, a central
location, and ideally, a pleasant
atmosphere.
Why then, is there such a
glaring communication gap
between the students and the
Food Service bureaucrats which
has resulted in policies which
unnecessarily harass students and
which establish inappropriate
dress and behavior standards for
hashers?
Unionize
The answer lies, I believe, in
the absence of a student-oriented
body to work in conjunction with
the Food Service policy-makers.
The Food Service will be quick to
point out that student committees
to taste food, etc. have been
failures, due to the tendency of
students to lose interest in the
meetings and their failue to make
proposals within the capabilities
of the Food Service. A better
solution for this need would be
the creation of a hashers union,
which would have the advantage
of providing a student voice which
is already knowledgeable about
and involved with the Food
Service.
Sadly, though, the power
structure within the Food Service
takes a dim view of this idea. As
older hashers will attest, several
attempts to create a hashers union
in the past have been met with
hasher immobility, through fear
of their jobs, and have resulted in
the instigators being fired, or
exiled to weekend dishroom
shifts.
Nevertheless, several factors,
not present in the previous
attempts, would increase the
probability of a hashers union not
being taken so lightly:
campus-wide hasher organization,
hasher determination, and student
pressure. Hopefully, younger
hashers with similar inclinations
can find the energy and
motivation to establish this
much-needed organization in the
upcoming year.

psychology and a hasher.)

Meal hours for a student on
campus are generally considered a
time to eat and relax in an
easy-going, social atmosphere.
Hashers, too, share this student
perspective and are motivated to
mak the meal hours enjoyable.
Unfortunately, the policies of
the Food Service bureaucrats
destroy this desired relaxed
atmosphere for both hashers and
their fellow students by
establishing an unnecessary and
uncomfortable business-like
atmosphere.
I hope to utilize the insights
and perspectives I have gained
from four years of hashing,
supplemented with the various
viewpoints of the hashers and

students I work with at Wilbur to
illuminate the absurdities of many
of the Food Service's peculiar
policies. My perspective is, of
course, limited to Wilbur, but
despite managerial differences
between different complexes, I
am assuming that many University
Food Service policies are
unpopular on a campus-wide
basis. All of the topics to be
covered have already been futilely
criticized within the framework of
the Food Service itself, and these
comments are cynically submitted
to the Daily as a last resort. It is
also significant that many of these
comments, felt by many hashers,
have to be publicly aired by a
graduating senior — job security

has a way of inhibiting hasher
criticism.
Brainstorm
The recent Food Serivce
brainstorm which periodically
requires meal card checkers to
literally hold in his hand and
scrutinize each and every
student's I.D. card (sometimes
referred to as "Gestapo Day") is
perhaps, of all the Food Service
policies, the greatest annoyance to
students and hashers. The idea
was conceived by well-intentioned
managers to curb the rate of meal
rip-offs through phony meal
tickets (whicn is actually a
primitive and infrequent method
of food rip-offs, anyway).
While the idea has some merit
at the beginning of the year or
when the checker is otherwise
unfamiliar with his line, this
system turns invO a farce for the
regular checker on the line. One
obvious fault with this system is
that it slows down the service, but
the major problem is its
harassment element. When the
"regulars" come through a line,
why should a checker demand, as
a hard-ass sergeant would, that a
person remove his meal ticket
from his wallet cellophane, when
he's seen the damn card all year,
and if he's a good checker, knows
who that person is?
Amazingly, to promote this
business-like uniformity, checkers
are even instructed to clutch cards
in the same impersonal,
machine-like manner from other
hashers who they are undoubtedly
acquainted with, and who are
highly unlikely to be stealing
food! This ridiculous policy forces
the checker, if he values his job,
to become very impersonal and
authoritarian with the people he's
supposed to be "serving," creating
undesired poor relations between
red-coats and students. The
people who suffer from this
arrangement are not the
freeloaders who simply try
another method of getting food,
but the regular students who use
the line and the poor checker who
gets shit from both the
management and the student.
Hashers As Children
Implicit in the development of
this particular policy, and many
other gems, is the managerial
perception of hashers (and thus,
students) as children. They want
to be certain each checker is
holding every card in his hand,
regardless of its familiarity,
presumably because without these
precautions, the checkers would
be totally incapable of performing
the simple tasks of matching faces
and checking labels. Maybe all
students look alike to those
nebulous powers that designed
this system, and they failed to
consider that students could
actually easily differentiate
between and remember other
students' faces.
The best alternative to the
present system is, as in the old
system, to have the checker
exercise discretion in how
carefully he examines each card.
It might also be advisable to select
a checker from the dorms he's
serving. The people a checker is
certain are legitimate should not
be subjected to a customs search
— whereas unfamiliar faces should
receive closer investigation (which
should not upset the stranger,
either, since he would not expect
the checker to know him).
After all, since the red coats
are supposedly selected for their
trustworthiness and reliability,
why should not these skills be
exercised in performing their job?
Dress
Unreasonable dress standards
are another problem a hasher has
to contend with, as do the people

who get sub-par service from an
irritable hasher who is dressed like
a polar bear serving hot food on a
nice spring day. The same kind of
meaningless dress standards that
were halted during the days of
high school student activism have
been resurrected for this
University's hashers. Regardless of
the temperature, white-coat
hashers are expected to button
their top, choke-collar button,
while red coats must wear a tie
and a long-sleeved, heavy red coat.
Hashers have only recently
been permitted to wear bermudas,
but "sloppy" cut-offs are still
forbidden as are any "unusual" or
"messy" dress styles, or any
innovations, such as hat
decorations. The powers that be in
the Food Service do not justify
these standards with health
regulations, which would be
difficult to criticize (though easy
to ignore), but rather with the
notion that hashers should present
a "neat, uniform image." This
image might be appropriate for a
convention of retired
businessmen, or in a prison, but to
serve the Stanford student body,
which prides itself on its
individuality, such conformist
dress regulations are totally
incongruous.
In fact, I am confident that
hashers and students alike would
benefit if the hashers were
allowed to express their
originality in altering their
uniforms, provided their work was
not interfered with. One need
only look at the high morale and
student popularity of the

the creation of a hashers union,
which would have the advantage
of providing a student voice which
is already knowledgeable about
and involved with the Food
Service.
Sadly, though, the power
structure within the Food Service
takes a dim view of this idea. As
older hashers will attest, several
attempts to create a hashers union
in the past have been met with
hasher immobility, through fear
of their jobs, and have resulted in
the instigators being fired, or
exiled to weekend dishroom
shifts.
Nevertheless, several factors,
not present in the previous
attempts, would increase the
probability of a hashers union not
being taken so lightly:
campus-wide hasher organization,
hasher determination, and student
pressure. Hopefully, younger
hashers with similar inclinations
can find the energy and
motivation to establish this
much-needed organization in the
upcoming year.

Meal hours for a student on
campus are generally considered a
time to eat and relax in an
easy-going, social atmosphere.
Hashers, too, share this student
perspective and are motivated to
mak the meal hours enjoyable.
Unfortunately, the policies of
the Food Service bureaucrats
destroy this desired relaxed
atmosphere for both hashers and
their fellow students by
establishing an unnecessary and
uncomfortable business-like
atmosphere.
I hope to utilize the insights
and perspectives I have gained
from four years of hashing,
supplemented with the various
viewpoints of the hashers and

students I work with at Wilbur to
illuminate the absurdities of many
of the Food Service's peculiar
policies. My perspective is, of
course, limited to Wilbur, but
despite managerial differences
between different complexes, I
am assuming that many University
Food Service policies are
unpopular on a campus-wide
basis. All of the topics to be
covered have already been futilely
criticized within the framework of
the Food Service itself, and these
comments are cynically submitted
to the Daily as a last resort. It is
also significant that many of these
comments, felt by many hashers,
have to be publicly aired by a
graduating senior — job security

has a way of inhibiting hasher
criticism.
Brainstorm
The recent Food Serivce
brainstorm which periodically
requires meal card checkers to
literally hold in his hand and
scrutinize each and every
student's I.D. card (sometimes
referred to as "Gestapo Day") is
perhaps, of all the Food Service
policies, the greatest annoyance to
students and hashers. The idea
was conceived by well-intentioned
managers to curb the rate of meal
rip-offs through phony meal
tickets (whicn is actually a
primitive and infrequent method
of food rip-offs, anyway).
While the idea has some merit
at the beginning of the year or
when the checker is otherwise
unfamiliar with his line, this
system turns invO a farce for the
regular checker on the line. One
obvious fault with this system is
that it slows down the service, but
the major problem is its
harassment element. When the
"regulars" come through a line,
why should a checker demand, as
a hard-ass sergeant would, that a
person remove his meal ticket
from his wallet cellophane, when
he's seen the damn card all year,
and if he's a good checker, knows
who that person is?
Amazingly, to promote this
business-like uniformity, checkers
are even instructed to clutch cards
in the same impersonal,
machine-like manner from other
hashers who they are undoubtedly
acquainted with, and who are
highly unlikely to be stealing
food! This ridiculous policy forces
the checker, if he values his job,
to become very impersonal and
authoritarian with the people he's
supposed to be "serving," creating
undesired poor relations between
red-coats and students. The
people who suffer from this
arrangement are not the
freeloaders who simply try
another method of getting food,
but the regular students who use
the line and the poor checker who
gets shit from both the
management and the student.
Hashers As Children
Implicit in the development of
this particular policy, and many
other gems, is the managerial
perception of hashers (and thus,
students) as children. They want
to be certain each checker is
holding every card in his hand,
regardless of its familiarity,
presumably because without these
precautions, the checkers would
be totally incapable of performing
the simple tasks of matching faces
and checking labels. Maybe all
students look alike to those
nebulous powers that designed
this system, and they failed to
consider that students could
actually easily differentiate
between and remember other
students' faces.
The best alternative to the
present system is, as in the old
system, to have the checker
exercise discretion in how
carefully he examines each card.
It might also be advisable to select
a checker from the dorms he's
serving. The people a checker is
certain are legitimate should not
be subjected to a customs search
— whereas unfamiliar faces should
receive closer investigation (which
should not upset the stranger,
either, since he would not expect
the checker to know him).
After all, since the red coats
are supposedly selected for their
trustworthiness and reliability,
why should not these skills be
exercised in performing their job?
Dress
Unreasonable dress standards
are another problem a hasher has
to contend with, as do the people

who get sub-par service from an
irritable hasher who is dressed like
a polar bear serving hot food on a
nice spring day. The same kind of
meaningless dress standards that
were halted during the days of
high school student activism have
been resurrected for this
University's hashers. Regardless of
the temperature, white-coat
hashers are expected to button
their top, choke-collar button,
while red coats must wear a tie
and a long-sleeved, heavy red coat.
Hashers have only recently
been permitted to wear bermudas,
but "sloppy" cut-offs are still
forbidden as are any "unusual" or
"messy" dress styles, or any
innovations, such as hat
decorations. The powers that be in
the Food Service do not justify
these standards with health
regulations, which would be
difficult to criticize (though easy
to ignore), but rather with the
notion that hashers should present
a "neat, uniform image." This
image might be appropriate for a
convention of retired
businessmen, or in a prison, but to
serve the Stanford student body,
which prides itself on its
individuality, such conformist
dress regulations are totally
incongruous.
In fact, I am confident that
hashers and students alike would
benefit if the hashers were
allowed to express their
originality in altering their
uniforms, provided their work was
not interfered with. One need
only look at the high morale and
student popularity of the
Band. .. .
Promotions
The promotion system within
the Food Service is another major
grievance among hashers. Instead
of seniority and performance,
intangibles such as "attitude" and
"neatness" are the most
significant determinants in
promoting hashers to the
"responsibility-laden" red coat
positions.
Unfortunately, there is a
tendency among ambitious young
hashers to try to "impress"
managers (stronger terminology
will be avoided), something which
a shy but competent person, or
the poor guys who have been
stuck in the breakfast dishroom,
are unable to do. Though I believe
most managers are sincere and
conscientious in their appraising
of hashers, the unwanted variable
of their personal biases still exists.
How can the Food Service
claim that, on the basis of
subjectively-evaluated neatness
and attitude, one hasher is more
qualified than another to count
meal tickets or stack coffee cups?
Assuming that most Stanford
students are, indeed, capable of
meeting the stringent demands of
red coat jobs, a pure seniority
promotion system, which is
employed by the libraries, seems
to be the fairest alternative
system.
Role
The central issue involved in all
of these problems is the ambiguity
of the role of the Food Service.
Diplomatically, they pretend to
be a student service, responsive to
the wishes and ideas of the
students they serve; yet, on
another level, they are a
hard-nosed business, rigidly
controlling their employees, as
they enjoy their monopolistic
position.
If the Food Service is truly
interested in behaving like a
business, they could certainly
improve their efficiency and
budgeting: many "easy-money"
red coat jobs could be altered or
eliminated, while many sources of
food waste (unpopular dishes,

etc.) could be investigated.
However, the Food Service seems
ill-prepared to compete with their
commercial rivals in either cost or
product. Instead, its redeeming
value is based on its functioning as
a student service, providing
unlimited seconds, a central
location, and ideally, a pleasant
atmosphere.
Why then, is there such a
glaring communication gap
between the students and the
Food Service bureaucrats which
has resulted in policies which
unnecessarily harass students and
which establish inappropriate
dress and behavior standards for
hashers?
Unionize
The answer lies, I believe, in
the absence of a student-oriented
body to work in conjunction with
the Food Service policy-makers.
The Food Service will be quick to
point out that student committees
to taste food, etc. have been
failures, due to the tendency of
students to lose interest in the
meetings and their failue to make
proposals within the capabilities
of the Food Service. A better
solution for this need would be
the creation of a hashers union,
which would have the advantage
of providing a student voice which
is already knowledgeable about
and involved with the Food
Service.

system turns invO a farce for the
regular checker on the line. One
obvious fault with this system is
that it slows down the service, but
the major problem is its
harassment element. When the
"regulars" come through a line,
why should a checker demand, as
a hard-ass sergeant would, that a
person remove his meal ticket
from his wallet cellophane, when
he's seen the damn card all year,
and if he's a good checker, knows
who that person is?
Amazingly, to promote this
business-like uniformity, checkers
are even instructed to clutch cards
in the same impersonal,
machine-like manner from other
hashers who they are undoubtedly
acquainted with, and who are
highly unlikely to be stealing
food! This ridiculous policy forces
the checker, if he values his job,
to become very impersonal and
authoritarian with the people he's
supposed to be "serving," creating
undesired poor relations between
red-coats and students. The
people who suffer from this
arrangement are not the
freeloaders who simply try
another method of getting food,
but the regular students who use
the line and the poor checker who
gets shit from both the
management and the student.
Hashers As Children
Implicit in the development of
this particular policy, and many
other gems, is the managerial
perception of hashers (and thus,
students) as children. They want
to be certain each checker is
holding every card in his hand,
regardless of its familiarity,
presumably because without these
precautions, the checkers would
be totally incapable of performing
the simple tasks of matching faces
and checking labels. Maybe all
students look alike to those
nebulous powers that designed
this system, and they failed to
consider that students could
actually easily differentiate
between and remember other
students' faces.
The best alternative to the
present system is, as in the old
system, to have the checker
exercise discretion in how
carefully he examines each card.
It might also be advisable to select
a checker from the dorms he's
serving. The people a checker is
certain are legitimate should not
be subjected to a customs search
— whereas unfamiliar faces should
receive closer investigation (which
should not upset the stranger,
either, since he would not expect
the checker to know him).
After all, since the red coats
are supposedly selected for their
trustworthiness and reliability,
why should not these skills be
exercised in performing their job?
Dress
Unreasonable dress standards
are another problem a hasher has
to contend with, as do the people

who get sub-par service from an
irritable hasher who is dressed like
a polar bear serving hot food on a
nice spring day. The same kind of
meaningless dress standards that
were halted during the days of
high school student activism have
been resurrected for this
University's hashers. Regardless of
the temperature, white-coat
hashers are expected to button
their top, choke-collar button,
while red coats must wear a tie
and a long-sleeved, heavy red coat.
Hashers have only recently
been permitted to wear bermudas,
but "sloppy" cut-offs are still
forbidden as are any "unusual" or
"messy" dress styles, or any
innovations, such as hat
decorations. The powers that be in
the Food Service do not justify
these standards with health
regulations, which would be
difficult to criticize (though easy
to ignore), but rather with the
notion that hashers should present
a "neat, uniform image." This
image might be appropriate for a
convention of retired
businessmen, or in a prison, but to
serve the Stanford student body,
which prides itself on its
individuality, such conformist
dress regulations are totally
incongruous.
In fact, I am confident that
hashers and students alike would
benefit if the hashers were
allowed to express their
originality in altering their
uniforms, provided their work was
not interfered with. One need
only look at the high morale and
student popularity of the
Band. .. .
Promotions
The promotion system within
the Food Service is another major
grievance among hashers. Instead
of seniority and performance,
intangibles such as "attitude" and
"neatness" are the most
significant determinants in
promoting hashers to the
"responsibility-laden" red coat
positions.
Unfortunately, there is a
tendency among ambitious young
hashers to try to "impress"
managers (stronger terminology
will be avoided), something which
a shy but competent person, or
the poor guys who have been
stuck in the breakfast dishroom,
are unable to do. Though I believe
most managers are sincere and
conscientious in their appraising
of hashers, the unwanted variable
of their personal biases still exists.
How can the Food Service
claim that, on the basis of
subjectively-evaluated neatness
and attitude, one hasher is more
qualified than another to count
meal tickets or stack coffee cups?
Assuming that most Stanford
students are, indeed, capable of
meeting the stringent demands of
red coat jobs, a pure seniority
promotion system, which is
employed by the libraries, seems
to be the fairest alternative
system.
Role
The central issue involved in all
of these problems is the ambiguity
of the role of the Food Service.
Diplomatically, they pretend to
be a student service, responsive to
the wishes and ideas of the
students they serve; yet, on
another level, they are a
hard-nosed business, rigidly
controlling their employees, as
they enjoy their monopolistic
position.
If the Food Service is truly
interested in behaving like a
business, they could certainly
improve their efficiency and
budgeting: many "easy-money"
red coat jobs could be altered or
eliminated, while many sources of
food waste (unpopular dishes,

etc.) could be investigated.
However, the Food Service seems
ill-prepared to compete with their
commercial rivals in either cost or
product. Instead, its redeeming
value is based on its functioning as
a student service, providing
unlimited seconds, a central
location, and ideally, a pleasant
atmosphere.
Why then, is there such a
glaring communication gap
between the students and the
Food Service bureaucrats which
has resulted in policies which
unnecessarily harass students and
which establish inappropriate
dress and behavior standards for
hashers?
Unionize
The answer lies, I believe, in
the absence of a student-oriented
body to work in conjunction with
the Food Service policy-makers.
The Food Service will be quick to
point out that student committees
to taste food, etc. have been
failures, due to the tendency of
students to lose interest in the
meetings and their failue to make
proposals within the capabilities
of the Food Service. A better
solution for this need would be
the creation of a hashers union,
which would have the advantage
of providing a student voice which
is already knowledgeable about
and involved with the Food
Service.
Sadly, though, the power
structure within the Food Service
takes a dim view of this idea. As
older hashers will attest, several
attempts to create a hashers union
in the past have been met with
hasher immobility, through fear
of their jobs, and have resulted in
the instigators being fired, or
exiled to weekend dishroom
shifts.
Nevertheless, several factors,
not present in the previous
attempts, would increase the
probability of a hashers union not
being taken so lightly:
campus-wide hasher organization,
hasher determination, and student
pressure. Hopefully, younger
hashers with similar inclinations
can find the energy and
motivation to establish this
much-needed organization in the
upcoming year.

psychology and a hasher.)
