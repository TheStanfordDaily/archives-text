After two anc! one-half weeks
of insanely intense ' reaction to
May 14's Daily article on the
Dollies, I respectfully request that
members of the community turn
their attention elsewhere. The
Dolly story did deserve reaction,
but not more than any other
campus, national, or international
Issue dealt with in the pages of
this year's Daily.
There are many other far more
substantive issues awaiting
attention, so why doesn't
everybody quit dilly-dollying
around?

This is my last month at
Stanford. Before I retire, I want
to say how nice it has been to
work here. Having got here late,
there have been many jobs before
this. But none so rewarding. Here
if I did a good job, or helped
someone, it was appreciated. And
my association with students has
been great. To them I say, be
happy, you'll make it.
