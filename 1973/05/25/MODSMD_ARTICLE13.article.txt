# 'Name Doesn't Catch All We Do'
## Food Research Institute Work Varied 
### JAMES LOBSENZ 
"The name 'Food Research
Institute' [FRI] doesn't really
catch all that we do very well,"
asserts FRI Director Walter P.
Falcon. "We're broader than just
food research, and although we
are an institute we do grant
degrees as well."
At present the research
conducted by the FRI centers
around three major policy areas:
the organization of national and
international markets for primary
commodities; strategies for
development of low income
countries, with primary emphasis
on agriculture and industries
related to it; and interrelation
ships between population growth
and socioeconomic development.
The Institute presently has
about 35 graduate students
enrolled in its program. Both an
M.A. and a Ph.D. program are

offered. The student population
exhibits an international
composition. In 1970 fifteen
students were Americans, the
other 22 included students from
Australia, Nigeria, Kenya,
Tanzania, Taiwan, Malaysia, India,
Rhodesia, Sierra Leone, Ceylon
and Ethiopia.
The foreign students often
have positions with government
agencies and universities in their
home countries, and generally
return to their native land after
obtaining their degrees. American
students, states former FBI
director William O. Jones, are
most likely to obtain teaching
positions at American universities.
"A darn few, however, go into
government agencies, or work for
the Food and Agricultural
Organization of the United
Nations, or for the World Bank."
Falcon, the new director,
hopes to be able to build some
additional strong bridges to other
departments like the Economics
and Sociology departments," and
to initiate some "new work in the
nutritional area to complement
our research on economic
questions."
'International Outlook'
The research projects will
"retain our previous international
outlook" maintains Falcon.
Research on agricultural problems
within the United States is

unlikely to be pursued on a large
scale except where problems of
underdeveloped areas of the
United States parallel the
problems of the underdeveloped
countries of the world.
Falcon envisons a day when
"most of our faculty will also
have one good undergraduate
course in addition to their
graduate courses and research
projects." He sees a need to
"provide more of a service
function to the University in
teaching undergraduates." At
present the Institute's faculty
includes 13 members.
At present the Institute
co-sponsors ten courses open to
undergraduates with the
Economics department. One of
the most interesting of these
courses is Food Research Institute
133, 134 (same as Economics
127 A,8), a two quarter analysis of
the developmental problems and
policies common to "Third World
Economies with Colonial
Heritages." Taught by Assistant
Prof. Tetteh A. Kofi, the course
covers topics such as land tenure
systems, foreign investment
policies, balance of payments, and
international trade agreements.
Work On Africa
The Institute, largely known
for its work on Africa, will be
striving to achieve a "broader
research balance" in the future,

states Falcon, will be seeking to
open up research into the
economic development problems
of Latin America and Asia.
A new project has just gotten
underway that will be
investigating the determinants of
production, consumption and
trade of rice within the Asian
markets. One of the striking
revelations that has been made
and is being investigated is the
gross variation between the ratio
of the price of rice to the price of
fertilizer, from one country to
another. The variation is as great
as 1000 percent in some cases.
Other factors that are being
investigated are the effects of the
Japanese and U.S. rice export
trade which makes up about
one-half of the world's total
market. In the United States, rice
exportation is the single highest
export relative to production.
(This means that a greater
percentage of rice is exported
than any other percent
exportation of an agricultural
commodity). The effects of this
American rice market on the
currents of world trade, and on
consumption, production and
employment in Asian countries is
enormous.
Economic Efficiency
Prof. Pan A. Yotopoulos is
doing research on comparative
rates of economic efficiency in

Asian countries relative to
different types of farm
management plans. This research
is an extension of his work on
Indian agriculture in which he
concluded that small farm
agricultural organization was
superior to the large farm type.
His present study encompasses the
economies of Malaysia, Thailand
and Taiwan, and concentrates on
factors that affect employment
rates.
Recent research work by
Demography Prof. Dudley Kirk
and Research Demographer Arjun
Adlahka seems to be revealing
optimistic results concerning the
reduction of natality in
underdeveloped areas of the
world. Their work in comparing
the birth rates of countries that
became industrialized in the
previous century, and countries
that are presently approaching the
industrial revolution seems to
show that although the birth rates
of today's underdeveloped
countries are higher than those of
the Western countries at the point
of industrial take-off, they are and
will continue to fall off more
rapidly than did those of the
modern industrialized states.
The FRI has in the past
published eight research title
series including a thirteen volume
study of the effects of World War
II on food, agriculture and trade
patterns throughout the world,
and a grain economics series that
included the first study of the
socialized agriculture of the Soviet
Union.
In addition the periodical
entitled Food Research Institute
Studies is issued three or four
times a year.
