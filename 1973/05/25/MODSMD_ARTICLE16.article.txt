More information on the history of Arthur Barnes' version of the
National Anthem. .. .
Norman Halleen, assistant Band manager, said that the first time
Stanford played the new version of the anthem on national television
was at the home football game against Notre Dame, on Oct. 26,1963.
Halleen thought that the reason the new version was first noticed
at the Big Game on Nov. 30, 1963 was because of the drama of the
moment. He said that there was a minute of silence before the
trumpet player began his solo, without an introductory drum roll.
Haleen also mentioned that KBHK in San Francisco uses Stanford's
version of the national anthem as a sign-off. This was confirmed by
Art Freeman, production manager of KBHK, who added that the six
stations in the Kaiser network use the Stanford version of the anthem
for their sign-offs.

I am interested in the film clip that KGSC in San Jose uses as a
sign-off early Monday mornings. Is that little clip from the Smothers
Brothers' Show? If not, how was it made available to KGSC? R.J.
Adel Hall, administrative associate at KGSC, said that the clip, a
film of Bill Medley singing "Peace, Brother, Peace," was not from the
Smothers Brothers' Show.
She said that it was specially made to use as a television sign-on and
sign-off clip, and was made available to KGSC through the efforts of
an employee who worked there about four years ago.

Can you find out the cause for the terrible taste and appearance of
the water in Manzanita Park? Friends tell me that the water in Stern,
Wilbur, Branner and Toyon isn V so hot, either.
Would the situation be improved by installing a system of water

softeners? What are the University's plans? J.B.
Water for Manzanita Park (and all of the other residence halls on
campus) comes from wells on Stanford property, according to Homer
Davis, Utilities Manager. These wells are separate from the water
supply for Palo Alto and some University buildings.
Ronald Doty, Superintendent of Water Quality for Palo Alto, said
that any number of things might affect the taste of water. Identifying
what makes water taste "terrible" can be difficult, he explained,
because the reasons water has a taste can range from an individual's
perception of the water to the presence of large quantities of certain
chemicals.
Davis said that the cloudy appearance of the water in the residence
halls is caused by air bubbles. He noted that the water will clear if it is
left standing for a short time.
Both Davis and Doty agreed that water softeners probably
wouldn't change the taste of the water.
According to Davis, the University plans to convert entirely to the
San Francisco water system (also known as the Hetch Hetchy water
system) by the first of next year. The conversion will be made for
three reasons, said Davis: well water used in residence halls is "not
nearly as desireable" as water from the San Franciscjp system because
the well water is much harder; last July San Jose county imposed a
well tax, making Stanford's well water more expensive, and the wells
are "overaged" â€” they have already outlived their normal life
expectancy.
