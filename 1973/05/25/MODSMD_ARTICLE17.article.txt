# Liquid Diet Recipe Booklet Includes Tasty Steak Shake, Apple Pie Drink
## 
### 
Have you ever tried a steak shake, or an apple pie drink? They may
not appeal to many people, but to anyone on a liquid diet, they taste
delicious.
So claims Wilma King. The laboratory assistant in the Department
of Genetics at Stanford University School of Medicine has written a
recipie booklet for people who can't chew their food. Entitled Blend
and Mend, it contains meals that can be liquified to milkshake
consistency and drunk through a straw.
The suggestions are the results of the author's own culinary
experiments while recuperating from a jawbone graft performed at
Stanford in 1970. For almost four months her jaw was wired shut
with space enough for a straw where a tooth was knocked out. She
was restricted to a liquid diet for a year. "I was starving on the
tasteless hospital diet. When I got home, I decided I could whip up
much better meals," King said. Now she is sharing her recipes with
others on similar diets. The approximate number of calories per meal
is included to help readers plan their menus.
King admitted that the dishes may not look like what people are
used to, but pointed out that they provide variety as well as
nourishment. For a dinner of roast beef and mashed potatoes that is
670 calories, she suggests: a three-ounce serving of roast beef,
one-half cup mashed potatoes, one-half cup gravy and one cup beef
bouillon. Her instructions are to process meat in the blender two
cycles at chop, then add remaining ingredients and process one cycle
at stir, two cycles at blend.
Perhaps her most helpful selection is an original poem called
"Fears and Tears" which she offers in the book's introduction. It calls
for: "I cup happiness, one-half cup fear, one cup patience, one-fourth
cup tears, one cup time, dash of a year; put into blender fears and
tears, process three cycles at grind or until they disappear; add the
remaining ingredients, process one cycle at mix, two cycles at blend,
or until your good health reappears!"

The author also urges readers not to stay at home because of their
problem. "Cooks and waitresses in restaurants ... [will] blend things
to your order -and laugh with you — not at you — for your courage."
She, herself, has a lot of spirit and courage. Two weeks after she
was discharged from the hospital, she was back on the job she has
held here since 1962. "I couldn't sit still at home," she expalined.
"My head was bandaged, so I bought myself a wig and came back to
work, bandages and all!"
Actually, King hasn't had a good piece of steak since 1965, when
she first broke her jaw. It was wired together, but when the wires
loosened in 1970, the bone had deteriorated. He;lower jaw was
replaced with part of her hip bone in an operation performed by Dr.
Donald Laub, associate professor of surgery. The next year, just as
her recovery was considered complete, she smashed her new jaw in a
minor car accident. Further surgery was ruled out and she will
probably be on a soft diet the rest of her life, although she is not
confined solely to liquids.
Publishing expenses for the 24-page booklet came out of the
author's pocket, but she hopes to recoup them from sales. However,
she noted that her aim was not to make money. "I just want to get
the message out for the benefit of other people on liquid diets," she
said. At least 10 percent of the book's earnings will go to Laub and
Project Concern for the plastic and reconstructive surgery they help
provide to underprivileged Central American children. She would also
like to have enough to contribute to other worthy causes.
The booklet is more popular than she expected, commented King,
who does the advertising from her home in Mountain View with the
help of her husband Donald. She has sold the book to several local
stores, including the Stanford bookstores and the Hospital gift shop,
and has filled many individual requests from patients and physicians.
It sells for $1.95 a copy.

one-half cup mashed potatoes, one-half cup gravy and one cup beef
bouillon. Her instructions are to process meat in the blender two
cycles at chop, then add remaining ingredients and process one cycle
at stir, two cycles at blend.
Perhaps her most helpful selection is an original poem called
"Fears and Tears" which she offers in the book's introduction. It calls
for: "I cup happiness, one-half cup fear, one cup patience, one-fourth
cup tears, one cup time, dash of a year; put into blender fears and
tears, process three cycles at grind or until they disappear; add the
remaining ingredients, process one cycle at mix, two cycles at blend,
or until your good health reappears!"

The author also urges readers not to stay at home because of their
problem. "Cooks and waitresses in restaurants ... [will] blend things
to your order -and laugh with you — not at you — for your courage."
She, herself, has a lot of spirit and courage. Two weeks after she
was discharged from the hospital, she was back on the job she has
held here since 1962. "I couldn't sit still at home," she expalined.
"My head was bandaged, so I bought myself a wig and came back to
work, bandages and all!"
Actually, King hasn't had a good piece of steak since 1965, when
she first broke her jaw. It was wired together, but when the wires
loosened in 1970, the bone had deteriorated. He;lower jaw was
replaced with part of her hip bone in an operation performed by Dr.
Donald Laub, associate professor of surgery. The next year, just as
her recovery was considered complete, she smashed her new jaw in a
minor car accident. Further surgery was ruled out and she will
probably be on a soft diet the rest of her life, although she is not
confined solely to liquids.
Publishing expenses for the 24-page booklet came out of the
author's pocket, but she hopes to recoup them from sales. However,
she noted that her aim was not to make money. "I just want to get
the message out for the benefit of other people on liquid diets," she
said. At least 10 percent of the book's earnings will go to Laub and
Project Concern for the plastic and reconstructive surgery they help
provide to underprivileged Central American children. She would also
like to have enough to contribute to other worthy causes.
The booklet is more popular than she expected, commented King,
who does the advertising from her home in Mountain View with the
help of her husband Donald. She has sold the book to several local
stores, including the Stanford bookstores and the Hospital gift shop,
and has filled many individual requests from patients and physicians.
It sells for $1.95 a copy.
Have you ever tried a steak shake, or an apple pie drink? They may
not appeal to many people, but to anyone on a liquid diet, they taste
delicious.
So claims Wilma King. The laboratory assistant in the Department
of Genetics at Stanford University School of Medicine has written a
recipie booklet for people who can't chew their food. Entitled Blend
and Mend, it contains meals that can be liquified to milkshake
consistency and drunk through a straw.
The suggestions are the results of the author's own culinary
experiments while recuperating from a jawbone graft performed at
Stanford in 1970. For almost four months her jaw was wired shut
with space enough for a straw where a tooth was knocked out. She
was restricted to a liquid diet for a year. "I was starving on the
tasteless hospital diet. When I got home, I decided I could whip up
much better meals," King said. Now she is sharing her recipes with
others on similar diets. The approximate number of calories per meal
is included to help readers plan their menus.
King admitted that the dishes may not look like what people are
used to, but pointed out that they provide variety as well as
nourishment. For a dinner of roast beef and mashed potatoes that is
670 calories, she suggests: a three-ounce serving of roast beef,
one-half cup mashed potatoes, one-half cup gravy and one cup beef
bouillon. Her instructions are to process meat in the blender two
cycles at chop, then add remaining ingredients and process one cycle
at stir, two cycles at blend.
