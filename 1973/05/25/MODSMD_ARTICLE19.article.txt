Safeway Stores Inc., has voluntarily agreed to reduce prices by
$80,965 for items sold in excess of meat price ceiling regulations,
according to the Cost of Living Council.
Safeway's retail divisions in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Phoenix
and El Paso, have reduced the prices of as many as 86 meat items for
which the excessive prices were charged. Each of these has been
reduced to a level which will offset the prices charged above the
allowable ceiling price.
Council Director John T. Dunlop says "meat ceiling prices were
imposed to put a halt to rapidly rising prices. These ceilings will
remain in place as long as necessary. It is essential that the
stabilization program, through its Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
enforcement arms, continue to monitor prices charged by retailers,
wholesalers and processors to assure that food price inflation is
brought under control."
The Safeway price violations had an equivalent range of from one
to 20 cents per pound over the correctly determined ceiling prices.
Cost of Living Council regulations require that ceiling prices be in
effect for all meat items sold after slaughter on the basis of
transactions which occurred during the 30 day period prior to March
28, 1973. The ceiling prices is the highest price at or above which at
least 10 percent of the particular meat item was priced during this 30
day meat ceiling base.
Safeway, one of the nation's largest retailers, has voluntarily
checked all meat prices and has made the necessary adjustment,
according to stabilization officers from the IRS. The agreement
followed an intensive investigation by IRS agents and a review by
Safeway officials of Safeway's pricing records. The IRS will continue
to spot check Safeway for compliance with price controls.

The California Department of Consumer Affairs alerts California
consumers to be extremely cautious in handling gasoline storage cans.
These cans, normally used to fill power mowers, chain saws or
outboard motors, were recently tested by Consumers Union — a
non-profit consumer-advisory organization — and were found to be of
"Disappointing quality."
According to Consumers Union, "most of the 19 varieties of
gasoline cans recently tested" were found to have "shortcomings in
design, workmanship and quality control." The testing institute noted
that "16 of the 19 models tested leaked from caps or seams during
likely conditions of use and misuse."
With summer rapidly approaching with the increasing likelihood of
consumers using gasoline cans, the Department urges consumers to be
alert to the following dangers:
1. Allow at least an inch of space in the can for the gasoline's
expansion at high temperatures, when storing gasoline in a can.
2. Keep empty cans tightly capped as vapors remaining in the
container may be explosive. A little gas in the bottom of the can may
reduce the explosion vapaor by creating a "too-rich" vapor.
3. Never handle gasoline when smoking, or near a flame or spark
source.
4. Keep cans away from high temperatures. Excess heat may make
the liquid contents of a closed can expand, thus building up pressure
inside the can and creating stress, especially at seams and joints.
Governor Ronald Reagan's Consumer Fraud Task Force has called
for a change of priorities in California's law enforcement system. In a
report submitted to the Governor earlier this month, the Task Force
claimed that marketplace fraud is one of the costliest overall crimes
and complained that it is not given a high priority by many law
enforcement agencies.
The Task Force stated that anti-fraud laws are not uniformly
enforced throughout the state. In recommending better enforcement
procedures for California's existing consumer laws, the Task Force
emphasized the need for clear delineations of authority and active
cooperation among the Attorney General's office, district attorneys
and police departments.
A key recommendation of the study is the establishment of
regional offices throughout the state by the California Department of
Consumer Affairs to improve service to consumers and to establish the
Department as the primary contact .point for all concerns of all
California consumers.

gasoline cans recently tested" were found to have "shortcomings in
design, workmanship and quality control." The testing institute noted
that "16 of the 19 models tested leaked from caps or seams during
likely conditions of use and misuse."
With summer rapidly approaching with the increasing likelihood of
consumers using gasoline cans, the Department urges consumers to be
alert to the following dangers:
1. Allow at least an inch of space in the can for the gasoline's
expansion at high temperatures, when storing gasoline in a can.
2. Keep empty cans tightly capped as vapors remaining in the
container may be explosive. A little gas in the bottom of the can may
reduce the explosion vapaor by creating a "too-rich" vapor.
3. Never handle gasoline when smoking, or near a flame or spark
source.
4. Keep cans away from high temperatures. Excess heat may make
the liquid contents of a closed can expand, thus building up pressure
inside the can and creating stress, especially at seams and joints.
Governor Ronald Reagan's Consumer Fraud Task Force has called
for a change of priorities in California's law enforcement system. In a
report submitted to the Governor earlier this month, the Task Force
claimed that marketplace fraud is one of the costliest overall crimes
and complained that it is not given a high priority by many law
enforcement agencies.
The Task Force stated that anti-fraud laws are not uniformly
enforced throughout the state. In recommending better enforcement
procedures for California's existing consumer laws, the Task Force
emphasized the need for clear delineations of authority and active
cooperation among the Attorney General's office, district attorneys
and police departments.
A key recommendation of the study is the establishment of
regional offices throughout the state by the California Department of
Consumer Affairs to improve service to consumers and to establish the
Department as the primary contact .point for all concerns of all
California consumers.

Safeway Stores Inc., has voluntarily agreed to reduce prices by
$80,965 for items sold in excess of meat price ceiling regulations,
according to the Cost of Living Council.
Safeway's retail divisions in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Phoenix
and El Paso, have reduced the prices of as many as 86 meat items for
which the excessive prices were charged. Each of these has been
reduced to a level which will offset the prices charged above the
allowable ceiling price.
Council Director John T. Dunlop says "meat ceiling prices were
imposed to put a halt to rapidly rising prices. These ceilings will
remain in place as long as necessary. It is essential that the
stabilization program, through its Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
enforcement arms, continue to monitor prices charged by retailers,
wholesalers and processors to assure that food price inflation is
brought under control."
The Safeway price violations had an equivalent range of from one
to 20 cents per pound over the correctly determined ceiling prices.
Cost of Living Council regulations require that ceiling prices be in
effect for all meat items sold after slaughter on the basis of
transactions which occurred during the 30 day period prior to March
28, 1973. The ceiling prices is the highest price at or above which at
least 10 percent of the particular meat item was priced during this 30
day meat ceiling base.
Safeway, one of the nation's largest retailers, has voluntarily
checked all meat prices and has made the necessary adjustment,
according to stabilization officers from the IRS. The agreement
followed an intensive investigation by IRS agents and a review by
Safeway officials of Safeway's pricing records. The IRS will continue
to spot check Safeway for compliance with price controls.

The California Department of Consumer Affairs alerts California
consumers to be extremely cautious in handling gasoline storage cans.
These cans, normally used to fill power mowers, chain saws or
outboard motors, were recently tested by Consumers Union — a
non-profit consumer-advisory organization — and were found to be of
"Disappointing quality."
According to Consumers Union, "most of the 19 varieties of
gasoline cans recently tested" were found to have "shortcomings in
design, workmanship and quality control." The testing institute noted
that "16 of the 19 models tested leaked from caps or seams during
likely conditions of use and misuse."
