# Unassigned Students Blast Housing Draw
## 
### JOAN HINMAN 
"It's fucked!"
When questioned about the recent
housing draw, most unassigned
students reply using that adjective. At
the end of Round Two, 700 students,
or 22 percent of those who entered
the draw, were unassigned. When the
number assigned off-campus is added,
24 percent of those who drew are
without places.
"Off-campus just means you didn't
want to get screwed by being stuck in
Stern or Wilbur," protests a
sophomore resident of Ecology House.
The general housing problem stems
from the increased number of students
entering the draw this year. 34 09
students drew in the first round, in
contrast to the 2941 students who
drew last year. This means there were
468 more students in the draw with no
increase in spaces.
Few Reasons
According to Tim Boyle of the
Housing Office, there are a few
predictable reasons why so many
people entered this year's draw. Last
year Mirrielees House was empty and
absorbed some of the students from
the draw; this year, the same students
accounted for an additional 64 people
entering the draw. Improved
petitioning procedures allowed 46
additional students to draw. Due to
the closing of the Austrian campus, 42
students who normally would have
been going overseas in the fall were
forced into the system.
But the largest increase, 316
students, was not predictable.
According to Boyle, more people from
the dorms entered the draw seemingly
just because they wanted to draw.
"This is the first time we've been
faced with a problem like this,"
explains David Garvin, also of the
Housing Office.
Waiting Lists
While the unassigned began lining
up outside the Housing Office
yesterday to sign waiting lists, it was
also clear that not everyone was
dissatisfied with the draw. About 35
percent of those who entered the draw
received their first choice assignment
in the first round. However, if a
student was assigned to Lambda Nu,
this didn't necessarily help.
Of the students assigned to Lambda
Nu during Round One, eight were later
moved to their second choice. Due to
an agreement with the University
which dates back to when the house
first entered the draw, Lambda Nu can
never have more than 25 percent of its
members evicted through the draw.
After Round One, more than 50
percent of the residents had been
reassigned. The house protested to the
Housing Office, and eight of the newly
assigned students were moved to make
room for eight current Lambda Nu
residents.
No Arrangements
While Lambda Nu is protected from
a large number of evictions, most
houses do not have any special
arrangements. Despite special priority
lists and extensive screening
procedures, 20 present members of
Ecology House out of 37 who drew
were left unassigned or off-campus. If
a member of Ecology House (to be
called Terra House next year) had
placed anywhere in the housing
system, he would have been reassigned
to Terra for the fall.
Larry Horton, Assistant Dean of
Student Affairs in charge of the
housing system, considers himself to
be "the architect of the modern
draw," and firmly believes the system
is fair. He helped design the present

draw method which has been used
since 1971.
"Given the perfect system where
there were enough spaces for
everyone, no one would ever have to
move out of his present dorm if he
didn't want to," explains Horton.
"The system as it is works perfectly;
it's just that we have a situation of
scarce supply."
When asked when the needed new
residences will be built, Horton calls
the question his "number one
priority." Meetings are planned for the
summer which will determine what
kind of new housing will be built, but
actual construction will probably not
occur for at least two years.
On the question of funds for
building, Horton explains, "First we'll
decide exactly what we want to do,
then we'll find a way to do it. Funds
will definitely have to be raised."
It is doubtful that the new
residences would be similar to
Mirrielees or Manzanita Park.
Although popular during its first year,
Mirrielees did not fill during the first
round of this year's draw; Manzanita
has never been popular.
'Want To Be Free'
"I believe that people more than
anything want to be free, to be treated
like adults, and to be able to interact
with their peers," state Horton.
'There just isn't any interaction when
all the necessities are inclosed within
four walls. In a dorm you have to
share a common bathroom, brush your
teeth next to somebody.
"Maybe you don't talk to someone
for a whole quarter, but when you do,
you really already know them."
While brushing their teeth and
waiting for the new dorms to be built,
this year's unassigned students can
take courage in the fact that all of last
year's unassigneds who sat on waiting
lists through the summer eventually
found places in the system.

But the largest increase, 316
students, was not predictable.
According to Boyle, more people from
the dorms entered the draw seemingly
just because they wanted to draw.
"This is the first time we've been
faced with a problem like this,"
explains David Garvin, also of the
Housing Office.
Waiting Lists
While the unassigned began lining
up outside the Housing Office
yesterday to sign waiting lists, it was
also clear that not everyone was
dissatisfied with the draw. About 35
percent of those who entered the draw
received their first choice assignment
in the first round. However, if a
student was assigned to Lambda Nu,
this didn't necessarily help.
Of the students assigned to Lambda
Nu during Round One, eight were later
moved to their second choice. Due to
an agreement with the University
which dates back to when the house
first entered the draw, Lambda Nu can
never have more than 25 percent of its
members evicted through the draw.
After Round One, more than 50
percent of the residents had been
reassigned. The house protested to the
Housing Office, and eight of the newly
assigned students were moved to make
room for eight current Lambda Nu
residents.
No Arrangements
While Lambda Nu is protected from
a large number of evictions, most
houses do not have any special
arrangements. Despite special priority
lists and extensive screening
procedures, 20 present members of
Ecology House out of 37 who drew
were left unassigned or off-campus. If
a member of Ecology House (to be
called Terra House next year) had
placed anywhere in the housing
system, he would have been reassigned
to Terra for the fall.
Larry Horton, Assistant Dean of
Student Affairs in charge of the
housing system, considers himself to
be "the architect of the modern
draw," and firmly believes the system
is fair. He helped design the present

draw method which has been used
since 1971.
"Given the perfect system where
there were enough spaces for
everyone, no one would ever have to
move out of his present dorm if he
didn't want to," explains Horton.
"The system as it is works perfectly;
it's just that we have a situation of
scarce supply."
When asked when the needed new
residences will be built, Horton calls
the question his "number one
priority." Meetings are planned for the
summer which will determine what
kind of new housing will be built, but
actual construction will probably not
occur for at least two years.
On the question of funds for
building, Horton explains, "First we'll
decide exactly what we want to do,
then we'll find a way to do it. Funds
will definitely have to be raised."
It is doubtful that the new
residences would be similar to
Mirrielees or Manzanita Park.
Although popular during its first year,
Mirrielees did not fill during the first
round of this year's draw; Manzanita
has never been popular.
'Want To Be Free'
"I believe that people more than
anything want to be free, to be treated
like adults, and to be able to interact
with their peers," state Horton.
'There just isn't any interaction when
all the necessities are inclosed within
four walls. In a dorm you have to
share a common bathroom, brush your
teeth next to somebody.
"Maybe you don't talk to someone
for a whole quarter, but when you do,
you really already know them."
While brushing their teeth and
waiting for the new dorms to be built,
this year's unassigned students can
take courage in the fact that all of last
year's unassigneds who sat on waiting
lists through the summer eventually
found places in the system.
"It's fucked!"
When questioned about the recent
housing draw, most unassigned
students reply using that adjective. At
the end of Round Two, 700 students,
or 22 percent of those who entered
the draw, were unassigned. When the
number assigned off-campus is added,
24 percent of those who drew are
without places.
"Off-campus just means you didn't
want to get screwed by being stuck in
Stern or Wilbur," protests a
sophomore resident of Ecology House.
The general housing problem stems
from the increased number of students
entering the draw this year. 34 09
students drew in the first round, in
contrast to the 2941 students who
drew last year. This means there were
468 more students in the draw with no
increase in spaces.
Few Reasons
According to Tim Boyle of the
Housing Office, there are a few
predictable reasons why so many
people entered this year's draw. Last
year Mirrielees House was empty and
absorbed some of the students from
the draw; this year, the same students
accounted for an additional 64 people
entering the draw. Improved
petitioning procedures allowed 46
additional students to draw. Due to
the closing of the Austrian campus, 42
students who normally would have
been going overseas in the fall were
forced into the system.
But the largest increase, 316
students, was not predictable.

Ecology House out of 37 who drew
were left unassigned or off-campus. If
a member of Ecology House (to be
called Terra House next year) had
placed anywhere in the housing
system, he would have been reassigned
to Terra for the fall.
Larry Horton, Assistant Dean of
Student Affairs in charge of the
housing system, considers himself to
be "the architect of the modern
draw," and firmly believes the system
is fair. He helped design the present

draw method which has been used
since 1971.
"Given the perfect system where
there were enough spaces for
everyone, no one would ever have to
move out of his present dorm if he
didn't want to," explains Horton.
"The system as it is works perfectly;
it's just that we have a situation of
scarce supply."
When asked when the needed new
residences will be built, Horton calls
the question his "number one
priority." Meetings are planned for the
summer which will determine what
kind of new housing will be built, but
actual construction will probably not
occur for at least two years.
On the question of funds for
building, Horton explains, "First we'll
decide exactly what we want to do,
then we'll find a way to do it. Funds
will definitely have to be raised."
It is doubtful that the new
residences would be similar to
Mirrielees or Manzanita Park.
Although popular during its first year,
Mirrielees did not fill during the first
round of this year's draw; Manzanita
has never been popular.
'Want To Be Free'
"I believe that people more than
anything want to be free, to be treated
like adults, and to be able to interact
with their peers," state Horton.
'There just isn't any interaction when
all the necessities are inclosed within
four walls. In a dorm you have to
share a common bathroom, brush your
teeth next to somebody.
"Maybe you don't talk to someone
for a whole quarter, but when you do,
you really already know them."
While brushing their teeth and
waiting for the new dorms to be built,
this year's unassigned students can
take courage in the fact that all of last
year's unassigneds who sat on waiting
lists through the summer eventually
found places in the system.
"It's fucked!"
When questioned about the recent
housing draw, most unassigned
students reply using that adjective. At
the end of Round Two, 700 students,
or 22 percent of those who entered
the draw, were unassigned. When the
number assigned off-campus is added,
24 percent of those who drew are
without places.
"Off-campus just means you didn't
want to get screwed by being stuck in
Stern or Wilbur," protests a
sophomore resident of Ecology House.
The general housing problem stems
from the increased number of students
entering the draw this year. 34 09
students drew in the first round, in
contrast to the 2941 students who
drew last year. This means there were
468 more students in the draw with no
increase in spaces.
Few Reasons
According to Tim Boyle of the
Housing Office, there are a few
predictable reasons why so many
people entered this year's draw. Last
year Mirrielees House was empty and
absorbed some of the students from
the draw; this year, the same students
accounted for an additional 64 people
entering the draw. Improved
petitioning procedures allowed 46
additional students to draw. Due to
the closing of the Austrian campus, 42
students who normally would have
been going overseas in the fall were
forced into the system.
But the largest increase, 316
students, was not predictable.
According to Boyle, more people from
the dorms entered the draw seemingly
just because they wanted to draw.
"This is the first time we've been
faced with a problem like this,"
explains David Garvin, also of the
Housing Office.
Waiting Lists
While the unassigned began lining
up outside the Housing Office
yesterday to sign waiting lists, it was
also clear that not everyone was
dissatisfied with the draw. About 35
percent of those who entered the draw
received their first choice assignment
in the first round. However, if a
student was assigned to Lambda Nu,
this didn't necessarily help.
Of the students assigned to Lambda
Nu during Round One, eight were later
moved to their second choice. Due to
an agreement with the University
which dates back to when the house
first entered the draw, Lambda Nu can
never have more than 25 percent of its
members evicted through the draw.
After Round One, more than 50
percent of the residents had been
reassigned. The house protested to the
Housing Office, and eight of the newly
assigned students were moved to make
room for eight current Lambda Nu
residents.
No Arrangements
While Lambda Nu is protected from
a large number of evictions, most
houses do not have any special
arrangements. Despite special priority
lists and extensive screening
procedures, 20 present members of
Ecology House out of 37 who drew
were left unassigned or off-campus. If
a member of Ecology House (to be
called Terra House next year) had
placed anywhere in the housing
system, he would have been reassigned
to Terra for the fall.
