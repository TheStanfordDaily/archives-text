# Unending Mania
## Saga Of Stanford's Pinball Wizards 
### JOANNE JACOBS 
"It's better than sex," a senior
male exclaims.
What is? Where? How do I get
some?
It's pinball, a mania that is
luring students from their desks to
stuff quarters into a slot and
watch a steel ball bounce around.
Pinball is an end in it itself: the
purpose of the game is to win a
free game and thus continue
playing indefinitely.
A quotation on Mike (Pinball is
life!) Carter's door, an R.A. in
Oliva-Magnolia, reads: "The
pinball player lives for a solid
thump from somewhere in front
of the machine, the sound that
comes when the machine registers
a free game ... it is cause for joy
even if it does mean just another
chance to try the whole bloody
mess again."
Why?
Why do Stanford students
play?
"Academic frustration," says
Ross Miller, a sophomore.
"No, it's sexual," argues senior
Steve Dougherty.
"It's a sex substitute,"
sophomore Gary McGreal agrees.
"There's a certain appealing
degeneracy," says John Strader.
"It's easy to get carried away."
Strader, a sophomore in
mechanical engineering, maintains
twelve of the machines on
campus, about half of the total
number. He has been interested in
pinball "ever since the days back
in Stockton. There was nothing

else to do."
Contrary to popular belief, it is
not necessary to be deaf, dumb
and/or blind to be a pinball
wizard. "The best players around
are stony cold," Strader observes.
The really good people just stand
there, lean back slightly, their
eyes not focused on any particular
place, just seeing the whole
playing field. Expressionless."
Effective Control
Many players jiggle the
machine, or bang it, if the tilt is
not too sensitive. But Strader
believes that the flippers are the
most effective way to control the
ball. "A serious player never bangs
the machine. All he's interested in
is the replay."
Dougherty says the secret *o
his success is "lots of small
motions." He is holder of the
Roble record with 441,810 on
"Spanish Eyes" and once played
for eight hours on one quarter.
Skill is more important than
luck, pinball players agree. "The
sign of the dilettante is
inconsistency," McGreal says.
Some students are fascinated
by the esthetics of pinball. "The
noice is a cascade of pings and
bings mounting to a click or a
thunk," one player rhapsodized.
Frivolity
According to Miller, "A
favorite thing is to get stoned,
come down at two in the morning
and turn out all the lights and
play." Serious players eschew this
kind of frivolity.
Each machine has its own
personality, serious players claim.
An easy machine is known as a
"whore" or a "slut." In a game
dominated by balls and flippers,
analogies to human sexuality are
to be expected. In the laundry
room of the Roble basement, a
list of quotations taped to the
wall by the pinball machines is
filled with obscene references to
unkind acts by the machines.
One male chauvinist pinballer
has written, "A good machine,

like a good woman, gives free
balls."
In a more philosophic vein,
another pinwit has inscribed,
"The machine giveth . .. the
machine taketh away." Some
players have taped the lyrics to
"Pinball Wizard," a song from the
rock opera "Tommy" on their
walls for inspiration.
Conversation
Enthusiasts often talk to the
machine, threatening or begging.
"You've got to encourage it, talk
to it, be nice. Then you've got to
cuss at it sometimes," Dougherty
explains. "It's kind of like a
marriage — sometimes you fight
with your wife."
Players don't mind losing to an
interesting, challenging machine,
Strader believes. Multi-level
playing fields have been built and
he dreams of designing the first
three-dimensional machine. "The
state of the art advances," he says.
"Fireball is a classic machine —
you can get three balls at once.
The opening shot is very critical.
Lawman is a fine game. Spanish
Eyes is a difficult game when set
up properly."
Tresidder offers Baseball,
Drop-a-Card, Straight Flush,
2001, King Kool and Shangri-La.
Pictures on the playing area and
the scoreboard match the theme,
but it is usually irrelevant to the
set-up of the game.
Machine Shortage
Currently there is a shortage of
machines. "A good one is almost
impossible to get," Strader says.
Machines earn anywhere from $40
to $200 a week. The company
owning them takes 50-60 percent
of this, giving the rest to the dorm
or frat where the machine is
placed.
A meter in the machine tells
the maintenance man how many
free games it is giving away. He
can modify it to make the game
more difficult. Strader's machines
are adjusted to give replays 34
percent of the time, but the good

players get most of these. As
residents of a dorm gain skill and
win more replays, the machine is
adjusted to be tougher.
The machines take a lot of
abuse from frustrated players and
cheapskates looking for a free
game. "If there's a way to hit it
and get a free game, Stanford
students will find it," Strader
says. But students are also

perfectionists, complaining if a
bumper is poorly adjusted or a
light doesn't flash.
If a machine is wrecked at a
location, it will not be replaced.
"There's thrill in pushing it
around," Strader admits "But
people wreck it. The machine has
to protect itself. It's like any
other living thing."

SEE ME, FEEL ME-The challenge of pinball has virtually
addicted many Stanford students including this mesmerized lad
who waits hopefully for that inevitable "free" game.
