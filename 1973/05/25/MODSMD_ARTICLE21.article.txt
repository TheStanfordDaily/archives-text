# SF Light Show Combines Excellent Music And Art
## 
### MARY JO McNAMARA 
The Heavy Water Light Show
staged two performances for the
first time without a live band a
few weeks ago at the Palace of
Fine Arts Theater in San
Francisco. Recognized for several
years as San Francisco's best light
show, Heavy Water has worked
regularly at Winterland, in
addition to other Bay Area shows,
such as the Stanford Grateful
Dead concert.
The group was formed about
four years ago by Mary Ann
Mayer, a former art major who
had worked for Glenn McKay's
Headlights, and Joan Chase, who
was then working on a Master's
degree in literature. Recently
John Hardham has joined them
while Gilbert Johnson takes care
of the equipment. In a telephone
interview Mayer said that she first
became involved in light shows six
years ago because of her interest
in the combination of music and
visual imagery.
In the years since then Heavy
Water has become a professional
group, touring regularly with
Jefferson Airplane and
accompanying Santana to Africa
and Hawaii. In addition they have
been active in album illustration.
Individually or as a group, they
have been responsible for
illustrations for Slick-Kantner's
"Sunfighter," the Airplane's
"Thirty Seconds Over
Winterland," Santana's
"Caravanserai," and the Dead's
"Europe '72." They also were
involved in the design and
photography of the Santana and
Dead songbooks.
Enjoyable Evening
The recent performances
provided a thoroughly enjoyable
evening of art and music. The
semicircular seating and wide
screen of the theater were ideal
for a light show, allowing the
viewer to enjoy the show for its
own sake. There were no
competing stage lights to destroy
the intensity of the colors.
Although scratched in a few
places, the new soundtrack
prepared for the show was put
together well with only brief
pauses between numbers, and the
theater acoustics were quite good.

The music was well chosen for its
excellence, its variety of jazz and
rock, and its appropriateness for
visual images. Even with a
prepared soundtrack the show lost
none of its spontaneity. It began
with Santana's "Eternal Caravan
of Reincarnation." Reflectives
sending eerie beams of light
swooshing across the screen, and
evoking a sense of infinite depth,
formed a beautiful combination
with the bird calls and saxophone
that introduce the music. The
tempo then began to pick up with
Hot Tuna's "Water Song," Alice
Coltrane's "Hare Krishna," and
the Dead's "St. Stephen." The
first half was characterized by
quick changes of pace and
relatively short numbers.
Longer Segments
After an intermission during
which carrot juice was served in
the lobby, the show continued
with longer segments of mellower
music. Liquids were used very
effectively for several Paul Horn
pieces. Images and music
coalesced beautifully for the
Dead's "Morning Dew" and
Santana's "Every Step of the
Way," which ended the show.
Heavy Water uses a
combination of slides, liquids,
reflectives, and film. The slides are
collected from a wide variety of
sources and include Pop-like
images of science fiction
characters, Oriental and Egyptian
sculpture, and paintings.
Mayer said that she looks for
"something that strikes the eye,"
for objects that are visually strong
and beautiful. She would like to
open people's eyes to the images
of other eras and civilizations. It is
an interesting way of viewing art
for it allows the viewer to perceive
relationships between works of
different cultures in what is
essentially an ahistorical context.
The various images on the
surface are held together by the
agitated movement of the liquids.
Amoeba-like shapes swell and
contract as the soft sensuous
colors blend together. The total
effect is of layers of images that
build up slowly with each song.
Throughout the evening images
appear, disappear, and reappear in
different contexts.

At times overlapping images
cover the screen, the reflectives
move rapidly, and the liquids
quiver and vibrate until the entire
screen is one pulsating movement.
There is a conflict between the
images on the flat surface and the
sensation of depth provided by
the undulating water and the
reflectives that creates a surreal
world of ambiguous time and
space.
At quieter moments the
movements slow down, and the
emphasis is on the subtle color
combinations and patterns of
rippling water whose formlessness
suggests cosmic imagery. This art
form involves the viewer in an
almost physical experience. Mayer
said that she tries "to teach
people to see in a different way,
to get high naturally" through a
combination of sight and sound.
Monitors Installed
Recently Bill Graham has
decided not to use light shows
anymore at Winterland. Instead he
has installed monitors for an
audience that is so used to
television that it prefers seeing
close-up screen images to seeing
the real thing. Monitors have been
used effectively by bands such as
the Rolling Stones who put on a
stage performance. But the vast
majority of bands do not, and the
monitors can become a great bore.
Certain bands have always
supported the light shows, most
notably the Jefferson Airplane
whose contract stipulates that
they will not perform without
one. A spokesman at Graham's
office said that "light shows are
passe" while monitors are "more
modern," but that if a band insists
on a light show it will probably
get one.
Meanwhile Heavy Water
continues to have bookings and
recently worked at the New
Riders' concert at the Berkeley
Community Theater, which has
excellent facilities.
In June they are traveling to
Salt Lake City for a week of
shows, and they may do a concert
tour of colleges in the fall. In the
future they hope to produce light
shows for video cassettes.
