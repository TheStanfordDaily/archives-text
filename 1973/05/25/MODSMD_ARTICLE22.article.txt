# COMPOSER ROY HARRIS HONORED
## 
### 
On Sunday May 20th, a concert was held in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium to honor the 75th
birthday of the prominent American composer
Roy Harris. Of particular interest to the
Stanford community was the world premier of
two songs for soprano and wind ensemble sung
by Stanford voice professor Marie Gibson and
conducted by Professor Arthur Barnes.
Professor Barnes is a former student of Roy
Harris and a close personal friend. The
dedication of the songs reads as follows: "to a
dedicated friend and brilliant colleague, 'Art'
Barnes." The songs are entitled "Love" and
"Marriage," and the texts come from"The
Prophet" by Kahil Gibran.
Also on the program was "Abraham walks at
Midnight," a work scored for contralto and
string trio, as well as the "Concerto for
Amplified Piano, Brass, Percussion and String
Basses."
Finally, there was a performance of
"Soliquov and Dance" played by Pamela

Goldsmith (former Stanford viola instructor)
and Johana Harris, the composer's wife and a
pianist of international repute.
Roy Harris studied with Nadia Boulanger in
the 1930s and developed a distinctive
"American" style of composition. His
Americanism can be seen in such works as
"When Johnny Comes Marching Home," an
orchestral overture, "Gettsburg Address
Symphony," and "American Ballads."
Before becoming a composer, he worked as a
farmer, long-distance hitchhiker, soldier and
truck driver. Although his idiom is "modern,"
his works have had considerable success with
both audiences and critics.
In honor of his 75th birthday, many
performances of his works are being given
throughout the United States. This year the
New York Philharmonic under Leonard
Bernstein gave four performances of his Third
Symphony, and a new recording of his Seventh
Symphony is being made by Eugene Ormandy
and the Philadelphia Orchestra.
