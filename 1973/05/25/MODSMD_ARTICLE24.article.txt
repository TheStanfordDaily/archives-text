# Concert Tonight
## 
### 
The Stanford University Chorus, Choir, and Chorale will join
forces for a gala spring concert including two local premieres at 8
p.m. tonight in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Tickets are at Tresidder Union ticket office and local
Ticketron agencies.
The program features the West Coast premiere of Kirke
Mechem's "Singing Is So Good a Thing — An Elizabethan
Recreation;" the Bay Area premiere of Ronald Sindelar's
"Medusa — The Ship;" Luciano Berio's "Magnificat;" and a
celebration of spring, "Maienkantate," by Karl Marx.
Prof. Harold Schmidt, director of choral music, will conduct
the Marx, Berio and Mechem works, with conducting student
Vernon Sanders leading Sindelar's multi-media piece.
William Byrd's preface to a book of songs, called "Reasons
briefly set down by th' auctor to perswade every one to learne to
sing," is both the text and the theme of Mechem's unusual choral
and dance music.
"Singing Is So Good a Thing" combines Renaissance and
modern styles, using a number of pieces by Byrd in a modern
perspective, with new material added. Some of the pieces show
similarities between the Elizabethan madrigal and today's popular
music.
Mechem, who earned music degrees from Stanford and
Harvard, has more than a hundred published works to his credit.
His first symphony, performed by the San Francisco Symphony
in 1965, was called by conductor Josef Krips "one of the world's
great pieces of music."
His works have been performed by many orchestras and
chamber groups here and in Europe, and his "Psalm 100" was one
of the three works to represent American music in the United
Nations' 20th anniversary celebration.
Sindelar's "concert-drama" was inspired by the tragedy of the
French vessel Medusa, as depicted in a painting by Gericault of
1819. Because of the carelessness of captain, crew, and
pleasure-loving passengers, the ship foundered off the West
African coast. More than 100 passengers escaped on a crowded
raft, but in the struggle to stay alive they turned to murder and
cannibalism, reducing the number of survivors to a mere handful.
The performance of "Medusa" calls on almost every kind of
human communication: talking, breathing, shouting, singing,
dancing — and pits the human sounds against a chorus of
nonhuman noises from prerecorded tape and percussion
instruments. The artificial sounds imitate, interrupt, and finally
engulf the live voices.
Dance direction of "Medusa" is by Martha Casella; special
lighting was designed by John Hughes.
Soloists in the concert will include Nile Norton, tenor and
narrator in "Singing Is So Good a Thing," and sopranos Gail
Wilson and Michele Miland in Berio's "Magnificat."

Soloists in the concert will include Nile Norton, tenor and
narrator in "Singing Is So Good a Thing," and sopranos Gail
Wilson and Michele Miland in Berio's "Magnificat."
The Stanford University Chorus, Choir, and Chorale will join
forces for a gala spring concert including two local premieres at 8
p.m. tonight in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Tickets are at Tresidder Union ticket office and local
Ticketron agencies.
The program features the West Coast premiere of Kirke
Mechem's "Singing Is So Good a Thing — An Elizabethan
Recreation;" the Bay Area premiere of Ronald Sindelar's
"Medusa — The Ship;" Luciano Berio's "Magnificat;" and a
celebration of spring, "Maienkantate," by Karl Marx.
Prof. Harold Schmidt, director of choral music, will conduct
the Marx, Berio and Mechem works, with conducting student
Vernon Sanders leading Sindelar's multi-media piece.
William Byrd's preface to a book of songs, called "Reasons
briefly set down by th' auctor to perswade every one to learne to
sing," is both the text and the theme of Mechem's unusual choral
and dance music.
"Singing Is So Good a Thing" combines Renaissance and
modern styles, using a number of pieces by Byrd in a modern
perspective, with new material added. Some of the pieces show
similarities between the Elizabethan madrigal and today's popular
music.
Mechem, who earned music degrees from Stanford and
Harvard, has more than a hundred published works to his credit.
His first symphony, performed by the San Francisco Symphony
in 1965, was called by conductor Josef Krips "one of the world's
great pieces of music."
His works have been performed by many orchestras and
chamber groups here and in Europe, and his "Psalm 100" was one
of the three works to represent American music in the United
Nations' 20th anniversary celebration.
Sindelar's "concert-drama" was inspired by the tragedy of the
French vessel Medusa, as depicted in a painting by Gericault of
1819. Because of the carelessness of captain, crew, and
pleasure-loving passengers, the ship foundered off the West
African coast. More than 100 passengers escaped on a crowded
raft, but in the struggle to stay alive they turned to murder and
cannibalism, reducing the number of survivors to a mere handful.
The performance of "Medusa" calls on almost every kind of
human communication: talking, breathing, shouting, singing,
dancing — and pits the human sounds against a chorus of
nonhuman noises from prerecorded tape and percussion
instruments. The artificial sounds imitate, interrupt, and finally
engulf the live voices.
Dance direction of "Medusa" is by Martha Casella; special
lighting was designed by John Hughes.
Soloists in the concert will include Nile Norton, tenor and
narrator in "Singing Is So Good a Thing," and sopranos Gail
Wilson and Michele Miland in Berio's "Magnificat."
