# The 						'Daily' Entertainment
## Director Of 'Concentration' Engages In TV Talk 
### ROD KOON 
For the hardy, dedicated,
daytime television viewer, there
seems to be a vast wasteland of
game and quiz shows awaiting his
judgment. There are, however, a
few worthwhile ones. One of the
more popular of these shows, as
evidenced by its fifteen years of
running, is "Concentration." In an
exclusive Daily interview, Norm
Blumenthal, the show's director,
offered some of his knowledge,
attitudes, and opinions on not
only his show, but also on the
general television picture as a
whole:
DAILY: Some television shows
try to entertain, while others aim
to educate, and still other to let
the viewer relax. What are some of
the goals of "Concentration?"
BLUMENTHAL: We're not trying
to teach anybody anything, I
doubt very much whether
anybody would learn very much
on any game show, even if it's a
question and answer show because
the retentive quality is just not
there.
As far as entertainment is
concerned, yes, that's our major
function. We've come a long way
since people have created
entertainment at other people's
expense. You know the old
shows, where people had to tell a
horrible story about what was
happening to them in order to get
a prize.

We're not making fun of
anybody. We're showing a very
live situation where someone is
competing against someone else.
If the show is successful, then the
home viewer can indirectly
compete also, even though they're
not going to receive any
remuneration for it. They are
having fun watching this battle.
DAILY: Do you think
"Concentration" is like
"Jeopardy" in the way the viewer
can participate?
BLUMENTHAL: No, I think that
"Concentration" is more of an
audience game than "Jeopardy"
is. Now mind you, I'm not saying
that " Concentration" is a better
program. I do not mean that.
What I mean is that
"Concentration" was devised
solely for the visual medium.
A great many programs are
basically radio shows. You don't
really have to watch them. You
don't have to watch "Jeopardy"
because the MC repeats the
question and the contestants just
give an answer. On
"Concentration," you must watch
the program, and I think this is
the major reason for its success.
It's probably the most perfect
television game show in the
respect of adapting to the
medium. That's very important.
But I am not for one minute
saying we are any better or any
worse than anybody else.
DAILY: Then your show, as

opposed to say "Hollywood
Squares," focuses on the game
instead of the celebrities?
BLUMENTHAL: The show
focuses on human, ordinary
people playing a game. Another
interesting point about
"Concentration" is the fact that
this is a game that you don't have
to be a gtnious to play, whereas
with "Jeopardy" ycu m jy have to
have a little more edrcati Â« .
High ratings of verta n game
shows tell us that tnere is
obviously a lot of enjoyment in
watching people win. On
"Concentration" there is also a
great deal of personal satisfaction
for the home viewer when you
know you have beaten the
contestant and gotten the puzzle
first. And we know for a fact that
a great many people watch the
show in groups and try to beat the
other person.
For instance, we have a
bartender who was flown to New
York by the people in his bar
because every morning at 10:30
this group of men sits around and
watches "Concentration." They
don't watch any other game show,
but they watch "Concentration"
and they bet on it. And the
bartender was supposed to be the
one who had gotten it more often
than the others, and part of the
bet was to send the one who had
been the biggest champion on to
New York. And he won on the
show.

I think that this happens quite
a bit. We found out that ships at
sea, army posts, a great many
people in hospitals, all watch this
show in groups. I think what
you've got here is something
different.
When you're watching
"Jeopardy," or any other quiz
show, as soon as somebody yei.'s
out the answer, that's over. On
"Concentration," you're waiting
ten minutes sometimes before an
answer. So you're actually
competing against your mate or
whoever is watching the show
with you.
DAILY: How does
"Concentration" do in the
ratings?
BLUMENTHAL: "Concentra
tion," first of all, is the oldest
game show in continuous running
on a network. It'll be fifteen years
old August 25th. As far as the
ratings, they are higher now than
they have been in the past four
years. So we're on an upward
spiral.
DAILY: Is "Concentration" very
expensive to produce?
BLUMENTHAL: No, not in
comparison to other programs.
First of all, it's a house package,
which means it's owned by NBC.
Which is also unique because
every other game show is owned
by an outside packager, such as
Goodson-Todman.
NBC pays them a lump sum of
money to produce the program
and then they have to pay the
salaries of all their personnel and
so on. "Concentration" is owned
by NBC, we are all employees of
NBC, so we avoid that extra
charge. Now with regards to it
being expensive as opposed to
other programs, it's cheaper to do
any game show because you don't
have the high cost of talent.
Including technical personnel, you
have approximately forty people
involved in the show.
DAILY: How are potential
contestants chosen?
BLUMENTHAL: They have to
take a test which involves thirty

puzzles, the same type of puzzles
that we use on the air, in varying
stages of completion. In other
words, we don't show them the
entire puzzle, we show them the
puzzle about the way it would be
when we consider it solvable.
If they solve enough of them
they pass the first part of the test.
Then they go in for a personality
interview and if they pass that,
they're in. As far as percentage is
concerned, we interview some 150
people per week, and only acctpt
ten.

DAILY: What do you look for in
the personality interview?
BLUMENTHAL: We're just
looking for people who are
sincere. We don't want phonies,
and by the same token, we want
variety.
Let's say 150 people come in,
and only one is a man, then unless
that guy is really bad, if he passed
the test, we'd put him on. We like
to keep variety among our
contestants: young, old, fat,
skinny, men, women, black,
white.
DAILY: What is your opinion of
other quiz shows like "Let's Make
a Deal?"
BLUMENTHAL: That's a difficult
question for me to answer. All I

can say is you can't fight city hall.
You can't fight what the ratings
show, and the people are buying
it. The ratings are high. You and I
might sit there and we may feel
that all of television stinks, that it
is an improper way to program.
But unfortunately, there are
certain shows that people are
watching. For example, I don't
care for Johnny Carson. It's a
personal reaction. But I'm in the
business to live by the ratings, and
Carson is getting the ratings, so
you know, you can't fight it.

You've got to keep them on. And
I think it's the same way with
"Let's Make a Deal." That is what
people seem to be buying.
NBC lost a tremendous amount
of viewers when "Let's Make a
Deal" left NBC. We can't find
anything to stick in that spot to
beat them. You might say, "Don't
you have any ride in what you
do?" Well I do.
I happen to be very interested
in William Shakespeare, you
know, we all have different things.
Now if I were to use a remote
passage from Shakespeare with
the idea that if they don't know
it well, damn it, that's their own
tough luck, they should know

these things and now I want
everybody to go out and read
Shakespeare so they'll be able to
solve my puzzles. I wouldn't last
two weeks.
DAILY: How do you choose the
slogans for your puzzles?
BLUMENTHAL: I make them all
up. It's all based on what people
say. I'm not trying for anything
incredible. When I make up a
puzzle I have my associate
producer act as editor. I draw the
puzzles up, and hand them to
him, a group at a time. And if he
can't figure them out, or if he's
never heard the expression, it
won't go on the air.
We get a lot of people sending
them in, but my secretary has
instructions to send them back
without showing them to me.
Because we're always afraid of
somebody trying to make $1
million suing us if I make up a
puzzle, and someone has a carbon
copy of a letter they sent
suggesting that puzzle. They're
going to claim that I stole it from
them.
DAILY: Has the show changed
much from its original format?
BLUMENTHAL: No, the format
is basically the same as it has
been. I try to sprinkle the show
with extras. I try at least once a
week to give a little something
different in the game. It might be
an international game, in salute of
a particular country, and all the
prizes in the game would be
generic to that particular country.
We're also very concerned
about charity. We do a Boy Scout
show, we do a show for CARE at
Christmas time, and we've already
built thirteen schools
in underprivileged areas around the
world: Africa, Phillippines, and
they bear our name, the
Concentration School.
So we do a lot of charity work.
What people don't know is that
we do a great deal of work with
the mentally handicapped, also.
So in other words, it's not just
what you see on the screen.
