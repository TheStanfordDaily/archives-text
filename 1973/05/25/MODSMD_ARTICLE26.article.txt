# Fine Direction In 'Jackal'
## 
### ROBERT SHERWOOD 
Under Fred Zinneman's exacting
direction, Frederick Forsyth's best-selling
novel "The Day of the Jackal" has been
adapted into a suspensefully tight motion
picture. It concerns a fictitious assassination
attempt on President Charles De Gaulle in
1963 by the 0.A.5., a military extremist
group.
Irate about De Gaulle's freeing of
Algeria, the O.A.S. was in real life
responsible for seven assassination attempts,
a few of which inspired the events of "The
Day of the Jackal."
Edward Fox stars as "The Jackal," a
hired English political assassin who is to do
the job for a cool half million dollars. The
role, tailor-made for a Sean Connery, is
performed with smooth professionalism by
Fox. His moves are calculated with calm
self-assurance and deliberate restraint.
The Jackal's counterpart on the other
side of the law is Inspector Thomas, who
matches the Jackal's skill with equal
professionalism. Tony Britton is well cast as
the detective specialist in whose hands the
life of the President depends.
The Inspector must track down the
mysterious assassin, whose nationality is not
even known, on a single lead — the word

Jackal. His team of men work from
passport and birth certificate record files
and are able to finally close in on the
hired killer in the last seconds of the film.
Showdown
It is the classic showdown between the
wits of two professionals on opposite sides
of the law. The chase ranges from London,
to Genoa, to Austria, to France and ends
during a ceremonial parade at which De
Gaulle appears on the Champs Elysees in
Paris. This final state ceremony is
elaborately and painstakingly re-enacted
with a Frenchman playii-g the President.
"The Day of the Jarkal" clearly bears
65-year-old Fred Zinnemann's directorial
stamp. This veteran filmmaker's last work
was the impressive "A Man For All
Seasons," whose acting and photography
captured six academy awards. This is his
first film since then and reflects his
excellent control of composition and
camera movement.
The success of this film, however, lies
primarily in its tight editing, credited to
Ralph Kemplen, but obviously the product
of the film director himself. The film
moves at a fast, engaging pace that sustains
both interest and suspense. Although we
know the Jackal will not succeed, we feel

he must right up to the last minute as he
eludes his pursuers time and again.
Good Translation
Scriptwriter Kenneth Ross has
successfully translated the complex narrative
of the novel into a screenplay that works
without the usual orgy of sex and violence.
The dialogue is deliberately kept free from
the sort of gutsy vernacular that ruined a
similar attempt at international intrigue,
"Scorpio."
Using only location shooting in actual
settings, "The Day of the Jackal" keeps its
realism in hand at all times, with a result
comparable to Costa-Gavras' movie "Z."
One is caught up in "The Day of the
Jackal" because it is plausible. The
characters ring true to life. Events are
deliberately low-keyed so as to better
resemble real life.
Most of the credit for this movie,
which aims at nothing more than
entertainment in a realistic vein, is due to its
distinguished director Fred Zinnemann. His
touch is subtle but has lent dignity to a
film that might have gone the way most
Hollywood films based on best-selling
novels go, toward overstatement and
self-inflicted sensationalism.

STANFORD SAVOYARDS—Jeff Wilson, Karl Vandereau, and Rick Albrink get proper patches for
"The Pirates of Penzance" from Kathy Wong, who's in charge of costumes for the June 2-4
production at Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Under Fred Zinneman's exacting
direction, Frederick Forsyth's best-selling
novel "The Day of the Jackal" has been
adapted into a suspensefully tight motion
picture. It concerns a fictitious assassination
attempt on President Charles De Gaulle in
1963 by the 0.A.5., a military extremist
group.
Irate about De Gaulle's freeing of
Algeria, the O.A.S. was in real life
responsible for seven assassination attempts,
a few of which inspired the events of "The
Day of the Jackal."
Edward Fox stars as "The Jackal," a
hired English political assassin who is to do
the job for a cool half million dollars. The
role, tailor-made for a Sean Connery, is
performed with smooth professionalism by
Fox. His moves are calculated with calm
self-assurance and deliberate restraint.
The Jackal's counterpart on the other
side of the law is Inspector Thomas, who
matches the Jackal's skill with equal
professionalism. Tony Britton is well cast as
the detective specialist in whose hands the
life of the President depends.
The Inspector must track down the
mysterious assassin, whose nationality is not
even known, on a single lead — the word

Jackal. His team of men work from
passport and birth certificate record files
and are able to finally close in on the
hired killer in the last seconds of the film.
Showdown
It is the classic showdown between the
wits of two professionals on opposite sides
of the law. The chase ranges from London,
to Genoa, to Austria, to France and ends
during a ceremonial parade at which De
Gaulle appears on the Champs Elysees in
Paris. This final state ceremony is
elaborately and painstakingly re-enacted
with a Frenchman playii-g the President.
"The Day of the Jarkal" clearly bears
65-year-old Fred Zinnemann's directorial
stamp. This veteran filmmaker's last work
was the impressive "A Man For All
Seasons," whose acting and photography
captured six academy awards. This is his
first film since then and reflects his
excellent control of composition and
camera movement.
The success of this film, however, lies
primarily in its tight editing, credited to
Ralph Kemplen, but obviously the product
of the film director himself. The film
moves at a fast, engaging pace that sustains
both interest and suspense. Although we
know the Jackal will not succeed, we feel

he must right up to the last minute as he
eludes his pursuers time and again.
Good Translation
Scriptwriter Kenneth Ross has
successfully translated the complex narrative
of the novel into a screenplay that works
without the usual orgy of sex and violence.
The dialogue is deliberately kept free from
the sort of gutsy vernacular that ruined a
similar attempt at international intrigue,
"Scorpio."
Using only location shooting in actual
settings, "The Day of the Jackal" keeps its
realism in hand at all times, with a result
comparable to Costa-Gavras' movie "Z."
One is caught up in "The Day of the
Jackal" because it is plausible. The
characters ring true to life. Events are
deliberately low-keyed so as to better
resemble real life.
Most of the credit for this movie,
which aims at nothing more than
entertainment in a realistic vein, is due to its
distinguished director Fred Zinnemann. His
touch is subtle but has lent dignity to a
film that might have gone the way most
Hollywood films based on best-selling
novels go, toward overstatement and
self-inflicted sensationalism.
