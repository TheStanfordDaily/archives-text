# Mahler's Eighth Too Large For Oakland Symphony Orchestra
## 
### BRUCE LAMOTT 
Like two socialites wearing the
same dress to the same party, the
San Francisco and Oakland
Symphonies entered the
symphony scene this year with
the Mahler Eighth Symphony
scheduled to open and close their
respective seasons. Whether this
was the result of coincidence or
calculated rivalry, the Oakland
performance last Thursday night
in the Oakland Auditorium found
them in a work several sizes too
large.
Mahler's "invocation of the
creative spirit" is a monument to
late romanticism, fulfilling the
composer's vision of a universe
bursting into song. It requires
some of the most extensive forces
in the symphonic repertoire,
adding eight vocal soloists, two
mixed choruses, a boys' choir,
offstage brass choir, organ, and
mandolin to an exceptionally full
orchestral complement.
Texts for the Eighth
Symphony are as eclectic as its
musical style, opening with the
eigth century Latin hymn Veni
Creator Spiritus and concluding
with the final scene from Goethe's
Fans t.
Fast Tempo
Conductor Harold Farberman
seemed least in command of the
work, setting an incomprehensibly
fast tempo for the first movement
and charging through its
intricacies with all the sensitivity
of a drum major. The
harmonically convoluted fugal
lines dissolved into frenzy, and
the grandiose orchestration was
exploited into hysterical bombast.
Though the Symphony Cho*us,
directed by Joseph Liebhng,
showed itself to be the most
capable entity in the production,
Farberman gave it little charce
other than to dash from one
breathless cue to the next.
Nonetheless, when given the
chance, it showed fine quality and
balance, as well as rhythmic
precision which often exceeded
that of the orchestra.
Creditably Oakland called
upon local talent for the soloists,
but only some of them were
suited to the task. In the taxing
soprano roles, Marian Marsh and
LaVerne Williams met the
demands with considerable
control. Intonation problems
bothered tenor Steve Covington
and mezzo-soprano Mildred
Owen, while baritone John

Duykers delivered a syllabic and
square melodic contour.
Technical Anxieties
The orchestra contended
valiantly with the score, but
technical anxieties seemed to
preclude the mystical ecstasy which
would allow greater rhythmic
flexibility and a less incisive sound
in the strings.

Once again, the conductor
barely touched the visionary
quality of the second section —
actually three movements
integrated into one — and lacked
the control to provide the chorus,
as well as the well-trained San
Francisco Boys Chorus, with real
accompaniment.
Given the sizeable repertoire

within the capability of this ;
orchestra, some delusion of :
grandeur must have brought the j
musical direction of the Oakland
Symphony to program this,
perhaps the costliest of
symphonic productions. In view
of the bare adequacy of the
performance, it is difficult to
justify.
