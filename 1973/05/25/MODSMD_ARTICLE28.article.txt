# Spirited Folk Songs, Dance Performed In Opera House
## 
### HOWARD BOOSTER 
Last Friday night at the San
Francisco Opera House the
Duquesne University
Tamburitzans continued their
effort to promote better
understanding between peoples by
presenting in concert the folk
songs and folk dances that are the
essence of the Slavic, Armenian
and Ukrainian cultures.
This group of students from
Pittsburg, under the direction of
Walter Kolar, started in 1936 as a
tamburitz orchestra. Variations of
the tamburitz, a ukulele-like
instrument, are found throughout
eastern Europe and Asia. The
most familiar example is the
Russian balalaika.
As the group grew, dancing and
singing were added to their
repertoire. Several ethnologists
were also added to their staff to
research the songs and dances at
their sources. The result was that
by 1960, after two European and
numerous domestic tours, the
Tammies were recognized as one
of the best folk dance troupes in
the United States.
Resurrected Heritage
Since then they have continued
to delight audiences throughout
Europe, Russia, Canada and South
America by bringing to life some
of the heritage of the Balkan and
eastern European countries which
make these people unique.
Unfortunately Friday's
performance was not up to the
normal high standard. The
program was marred by a general
lack of precision and occassional
outright sloppiness. The problem
showed up most noticeably in the
dromes or shaking step that comes
in many of the Croatian dances.
The straight-kneed, very sharp
step Is supposed to set the whole,

finely pleated Croatian costume in
motion. Many of the dancers
could simply not do the difficult
step at the speed required by the
orchestra.
The high points of the evening
came from the efforts of two
individual performers. Cissy
Rebich, a soprano with the
Tammies, sang a Yugoslav gypsy
song entitled, Koliko Te Volim
("How Much I Love You").
Rebich's voice filled the Opera
House with the sad and poignant
spirit of the gypsy soul.
Climactic Moment
The climax came in the form
of a short stocky musician who
was almost completely hidden
behind his accordian. Leon Nark
began with a slow simple
Ukrainian folk melody. He then
increased its speed and
complexity until his fingers were
only a blur on the keyboard, yet
the notes came out clean and
pure.

The music infected the |
audience with such spirit and j
enthusiasum that they required j
him to play the whole piece over j
again. They would have demanded
many encores had not the
orchestra stepped in to give Nark
a well-deserved break.
All things considered, the
evening was quite enjoyable,
though this reviewer hopes that
much polishing will be done
before the next tour.

The high points of the evening
came from the efforts of two
individual performers. Cissy
Rebich, a soprano with the
Tammies, sang a Yugoslav gypsy
song entitled, Koliko Te Volim
("How Much I Love You").
Rebich's voice filled the Opera
House with the sad and poignant
spirit of the gypsy soul.
Climactic Moment
The climax came in the form
of a short stocky musician who
was almost completely hidden
behind his accordian. Leon Nark
began with a slow simple
Ukrainian folk melody. He then
increased its speed and
complexity until his fingers were
only a blur on the keyboard, yet
the notes came out clean and
pure.

The music infected the |
audience with such spirit and j
enthusiasum that they required j
him to play the whole piece over j
again. They would have demanded
many encores had not the
orchestra stepped in to give Nark
a well-deserved break.
All things considered, the
evening was quite enjoyable,
though this reviewer hopes that
much polishing will be done
before the next tour.
Last Friday night at the San
Francisco Opera House the
Duquesne University
Tamburitzans continued their
effort to promote better
understanding between peoples by
presenting in concert the folk
songs and folk dances that are the
essence of the Slavic, Armenian
and Ukrainian cultures.
This group of students from
Pittsburg, under the direction of
Walter Kolar, started in 1936 as a
tamburitz orchestra. Variations of
the tamburitz, a ukulele-like
instrument, are found throughout
eastern Europe and Asia. The
most familiar example is the
Russian balalaika.
As the group grew, dancing and
singing were added to their
repertoire. Several ethnologists
were also added to their staff to
research the songs and dances at
their sources. The result was that
by 1960, after two European and
numerous domestic tours, the
Tammies were recognized as one
of the best folk dance troupes in
the United States.
Resurrected Heritage
Since then they have continued
to delight audiences throughout
Europe, Russia, Canada and South
America by bringing to life some
of the heritage of the Balkan and
eastern European countries which
make these people unique.
Unfortunately Friday's
performance was not up to the
normal high standard. The
program was marred by a general
lack of precision and occassional
outright sloppiness. The problem
showed up most noticeably in the
dromes or shaking step that comes
in many of the Croatian dances.
The straight-kneed, very sharp
step Is supposed to set the whole,

finely pleated Croatian costume in
motion. Many of the dancers
could simply not do the difficult
step at the speed required by the
orchestra.
