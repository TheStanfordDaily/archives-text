## Unique Architecture Exhibited In SF 
### JOHN LOOMIS 
That Moshe Safdie is the
most brilliant living architect â€”
urban designer cannot be
doubted after viewing the
exhibit of his works entitled
"Moshe Safdia: For Everyone a
Garden," at the San Francisco
Museum of Art.
Moshe Safdie is best known
for his Habitats' 67 at Montreal's
Expo '67. Habitats '67 is the
most innovative housing system
that has been built. The exhibit,
however, brings us up to date
on Safdie's recent projects and
covers his first Habitat as well.
Moshe Safdie brings a unique
personal background to his
architecture, a background that
is very vital to his philosophy.
Safdie was born and lived in
Israel until 1953 when at 15, he
and his family moved to
Canada. Very much a part of
his life in Israel was the
communal spirit of the kibbutz.
This life style was the obvious
antithesis to North American
suburban living.
In 1960 Safdie submitted as

his masters thesis for his
architectural degree at McGill
not a monumental public
building or a private residence,
but a housing system. This was
a radical step to take at that
time, but it provided the basis
for all his further architectural
development.
Environmental Concern
Safdie's Habitats respond to
his concern for man's
environmental needs, especially
in urb&n areas. He sees industry
and technology as vital
components in his housing
systems. Since his success at
Montreal, he has completed
projects for Habitats in Israel,
Puerto Rico, New York and
Baltimore. Models and drawings
of these are on display.

For his Habitats Safie draws
interestingly upon vernacular
architecture of the
Mediterranean, especially Arab
villages. He recognizes how
when left to his own devices
within a traditional society man
creates very practical and
beautiful living spaces even at
high densities.
So it is not mere coincidence
that Safdie's Habitats look and
function in many ways like
Mediterranean villages and make
little reference to suburbia.
Varied Exhibit
The exhibit consists not only
of drawings and models but also
a slide show and three
videotapes. The video of Safdie's
involvement in Jerusalem is
particularly well done. There

Safdie is undertaking a housing
project, a rabbinical college, and
reconstruction around the
Wailing Wall.
His approach to construction
in that beautiful city with
hundreds of years of
architectural tradition is
extremely sensitive. When the
new tries to harmonize with the
old in architecture the result is
too often sickly superficial.
(Stanford is a good example of
this.) However, Safdie's
understanding of architecture is
too deep to produce superficial
results.
"Moshe Safdie: For Everyone
a Garden" will be on display
until June 17 at the San
Francisco Museum of Art.
