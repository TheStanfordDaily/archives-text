## 550 Vie For Committee Posts

Roughly 550 students have applied
for 120 positions on University
committees, according to ASSU Vice
President Beth Garfield. The
seven-member ASSU nominations
committee hopes to make its decisions
on applications by the end of dead
week.
Last year, according to Vice
President Jim Friend, there were 230
applicants for committee positions.
Friend, Garfield and ASSU President
Kevin O'Grady, all attributed the
increased number of applications to a
good publicity campaign.
O'Grady said the ASSU spent about
$150 on leaflets and advertising, and
noted that efforts to interest graduate
students were especially successful.
Some 4000 letters were sent to grad
students, with the result that they
comprise about half the present
applicants.
Leaflets And Letters
Garfield said leaflets were also
distributed to all the dorms on
campus, and thousands of two-page
letters were slipped under dorm doors.
Garfield also cited an increased
desire by students to become active in
different aspects of the University. In
the past, she added, people were
involved in more direct political
activities.
Garfield said the large number of
applicants has created some problems.
The nominating committee is trying to
interview each applicant for at least
five to 10 minutes, which will total
over 40 hours of interviewing. Garfield
said the interviews were very
important in the selection process but
the nominating committee knew "not
everyone comes off well in a five to
ten minute interview."
Active Members
Garfield said the nominating
committee was looking for people
with enthusiasm and committment,
people who would not just go to the
meetings, but take an active part.
She said because of the large
number of applications, the committee
could afford to be selective. "I think
we are going to get better
people .. . students who are going to
take the initiative on their committee
and do outside work." In the past,
Garfield said, there had been
"rubber-stamp committees with
rubber-stamp people" adding that

some students just wanted the
committee position for their records.
She said when they are used
correctly "the committees have a huge
amount of power in the University."
Favoritism
Garfield noted that in many cases
members of the nominating committee
favored applicants who agreed with
their own views. But since the
nominating committee is
representative of many interests on
campus, she contended, their choices
will balance out.
For instance, Garfield said she

favored applicants for the Committee
on Undergraduate Admissions who
would push for more vigorous
recruiting of qualified women
students.
The most popular committees with
applicants are the C-15, with six
student positions, the Committee on
the Educational Employment of
Women, the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies,
each with three student positions.
Each of these committees has 30-40
applicants.
