# Golfer Involved In Frustrating Struggle
## Trompas Tries To Regain Junior Magic 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Aly Trompas began playing
golf at the age of five, won his
first trophy at seven, was shooting
in the 70's at 11, shot 67 in a
tournament at 15, and won the
U.S. Junior at 16. It wasn't until
last year, as a 19 year old
Stanford freshman, that Trompas
discovered that golf was a difficult
game.
After a junior career where
scores over 75 almost never
appeared on his card, Trompas
was suddenly struggling to break
80 in collegiate competition. His
tee shots were going sideways, the
putts stopped falling, and those
miraculous recovery shots that
used to skirt through forests
began to find unfriendly limbs
and fall back into the rough.
This year things have improved
considerably, but the sophomore
communication major from San
Diego is still struggling to regain

the form that made him the
nation's premier junior golfer in
1969.
"A lot of it's mental,"
Trompas said. "After I won the
national junior 1 was untouchable
for a year and a half because 1 had
so much confidence — I just felt I
was that much better than anyone
else."
Early Success
Trompas continued to play
with unbridled confidence during
his first few months at Stanford
list fall. He fired rounds of
68-74-68-71 for a three under par
281 total in qualifying rounds for
the team and during October and
November his worst 18 hole score
was 74.
But when he began to play
again after a short layoff in
December, golf stopped being so
easy. "I got into some bad swing
habits," Trompas said. "I was
lining up to the right and coming

over the ball."
The swing problems persisted
throughout the year and Trompas'
first collegiate season was a
disappointment. He averaged over
77 shots a round and wasn't even
one of the five players Coach Bud
Finger selected to go to the
NCAA's.
Since then Trompas has once
again grooved his powerful swing
and his scores have dropped
considerably. He is currently
averaging 74.6 in collegiate
tournaments and finished second
in two major tourneys before
placing a respectable ninth in the
Pac-B's last week. But the
tournament victories that came so
easy a few years ago have been
absent.
'Have A Chance'
"I've got my swing
straightened out so that when I
tee it up I know I have a chance,"
he said, "but I still have a lot of
work to do on my attitude. When
I played junior golf I thought a lot
better on the course — golf was
the only thing on my mind then.
Now there are a lot of other
things to think about.
"Some people have said that
chess is the closest sport to golf
and I can see where it is because
you need so much concentration

in both. In golf you know the
swing, but it just takes
tremendous concentration to
repeat it so many times with fluid
movements. That's why little
things distract golfers. I guess I'm
a temperamental golfer just like
Bobby Fischer is a temperamental
chess player."
Golfers have always been
among the world's most
temperamental athletes
("Tempestuous Tommy Bolt,"
wrote Sports Illustrated golf
writer Dan Jenkins, "once missed
a short putt that cost him a couple
of thousand dollars and paused to
talk it over with the Lord. 'Me
again, huh?' Bolt said, squinting
upward and boiling. 'Why don't
you come down here and play me.
Come on, come on. You and your
kid too. I'll give you two a side
and play your low ball.' "), and
even though Trompas has never
been known to speak with the
Lord during a round, he candidly
admits that his success is
dependent on the proper mental
attitude.
Stay In The Ballgame
"Sometimes its hard for me to
stay in the ballgame after I've had
a real bad hole," he said. "I used
to be able to play bad and still

score well but I haven't been able
to do that lately."
It seems obvious, though, that
all Trompas needs is a major
tournament victory to regain his
confidence. His shotmaking is still
occasionally awe-inspiring and
most experts feel that he has a
bright pro future ahead of him.
His 23 year old brother Greg is
currently competing as a
professional.
"I'll definitely try pro golf for
two or three years," Trompas
said, "but I don't want to hang on
if I'm not playing well. If I'm
making money I'll continue — if
not, I'll go to law school."
In the near future, however,
Trompas' main concern is the
NCAA championships at
Stillwater, Oklahoma on June
18-23. At Stillwater, some of the
players he defeated in the junior
ranks will be among the favorites
to win the individual title.
Florida's Gary Koch, USC's
Craig Stadler, and even defending
champion Ben Crenshaw of Texas
were victims of Trompas a few
years ago.
"I usua ly came out on top in
those day? " he recalls wistfully,
and noth g would make Aly
Trompas happier than to come
out on top again at the NCAA's.

easy. "I got into some bad swing
habits," Trompas said. "I was
lining up to the right and coming

over the ball."
The swing problems persisted
throughout the year and Trompas'
first collegiate season was a
disappointment. He averaged over
77 shots a round and wasn't even
one of the five players Coach Bud
Finger selected to go to the
NCAA's.
Since then Trompas has once
again grooved his powerful swing
and his scores have dropped
considerably. He is currently
averaging 74.6 in collegiate
tournaments and finished second
in two major tourneys before
placing a respectable ninth in the
Pac-B's last week. But the
tournament victories that came so
easy a few years ago have been
absent.
'Have A Chance'
"I've got my swing
straightened out so that when I
tee it up I know I have a chance,"
he said, "but I still have a lot of
work to do on my attitude. When
I played junior golf I thought a lot
better on the course — golf was
the only thing on my mind then.
Now there are a lot of other
things to think about.
"Some people have said that
chess is the closest sport to golf
and I can see where it is because
you need so much concentration

in both. In golf you know the
swing, but it just takes
tremendous concentration to
repeat it so many times with fluid
movements. That's why little
things distract golfers. I guess I'm
a temperamental golfer just like
Bobby Fischer is a temperamental
chess player."
Golfers have always been
among the world's most
temperamental athletes
("Tempestuous Tommy Bolt,"
wrote Sports Illustrated golf
writer Dan Jenkins, "once missed
a short putt that cost him a couple
of thousand dollars and paused to
talk it over with the Lord. 'Me
again, huh?' Bolt said, squinting
upward and boiling. 'Why don't
you come down here and play me.
Come on, come on. You and your
kid too. I'll give you two a side
and play your low ball.' "), and
even though Trompas has never
been known to speak with the
Lord during a round, he candidly
admits that his success is
dependent on the proper mental
attitude.
Stay In The Ballgame
"Sometimes its hard for me to
stay in the ballgame after I've had
a real bad hole," he said. "I used
to be able to play bad and still

score well but I haven't been able
to do that lately."
It seems obvious, though, that
all Trompas needs is a major
tournament victory to regain his
confidence. His shotmaking is still
occasionally awe-inspiring and
most experts feel that he has a
bright pro future ahead of him.
His 23 year old brother Greg is
currently competing as a
professional.
"I'll definitely try pro golf for
two or three years," Trompas
said, "but I don't want to hang on
if I'm not playing well. If I'm
making money I'll continue — if
not, I'll go to law school."
In the near future, however,
Trompas' main concern is the
NCAA championships at
Stillwater, Oklahoma on June
18-23. At Stillwater, some of the
players he defeated in the junior
ranks will be among the favorites
to win the individual title.
Florida's Gary Koch, USC's
Craig Stadler, and even defending
champion Ben Crenshaw of Texas
were victims of Trompas a few
years ago.
"I usua ly came out on top in

and noth g would make Aly

THE TROMP — Sophomore Aly Trompas looks down the fairway
after hitting a tee shot during the Pac-8 Southern Division tournament
two weeks ago. After a disappointing freshman season, Trompas is
gradually regaining the form that made him the nation's top junior
golfer in 1969.
Aly Trompas began playing
golf at the age of five, won his
first trophy at seven, was shooting
in the 70's at 11, shot 67 in a
tournament at 15, and won the
U.S. Junior at 16. It wasn't until
last year, as a 19 year old
Stanford freshman, that Trompas
discovered that golf was a difficult
game.
After a junior career where
scores over 75 almost never
appeared on his card, Trompas
was suddenly struggling to break
80 in collegiate competition. His
tee shots were going sideways, the
putts stopped falling, and those
miraculous recovery shots that
used to skirt through forests
began to find unfriendly limbs
and fall back into the rough.
This year things have improved
considerably, but the sophomore
communication major from San
Diego is still struggling to regain

the form that made him the
nation's premier junior golfer in
1969.
"A lot of it's mental,"
Trompas said. "After I won the
national junior 1 was untouchable
for a year and a half because 1 had
so much confidence — I just felt I
was that much better than anyone
else."
Early Success
Trompas continued to play
with unbridled confidence during
his first few months at Stanford
list fall. He fired rounds of
68-74-68-71 for a three under par
281 total in qualifying rounds for
the team and during October and
November his worst 18 hole score
was 74.
But when he began to play
again after a short layoff in
December, golf stopped being so
easy. "I got into some bad swing

writer Dan Jenkins, "once missed
a short putt that cost him a couple
of thousand dollars and paused to
talk it over with the Lord. 'Me
again, huh?' Bolt said, squinting
upward and boiling. 'Why don't
you come down here and play me.
Come on, come on. You and your
kid too. I'll give you two a side
and play your low ball.' "), and
even though Trompas has never
been known to speak with the
Lord during a round, he candidly
admits that his success is
dependent on the proper mental
attitude.
Stay In The Ballgame
"Sometimes its hard for me to
stay in the ballgame after I've had
a real bad hole," he said. "I used
to be able to play bad and still

score well but I haven't been able
to do that lately."
It seems obvious, though, that
all Trompas needs is a major
tournament victory to regain his
confidence. His shotmaking is still
occasionally awe-inspiring and
most experts feel that he has a
bright pro future ahead of him.
His 23 year old brother Greg is
currently competing as a
professional.
"I'll definitely try pro golf for
two or three years," Trompas
said, "but I don't want to hang on
if I'm not playing well. If I'm
making money I'll continue — if
not, I'll go to law school."
In the near future, however,
Trompas' main concern is the
NCAA championships at
Stillwater, Oklahoma on June
18-23. At Stillwater, some of the
players he defeated in the junior
ranks will be among the favorites
to win the individual title.
Florida's Gary Koch, USC's
Craig Stadler, and even defending
champion Ben Crenshaw of Texas
were victims of Trompas a few
years ago.
"I usua ly came out on top in
those day? " he recalls wistfully,
and noth g would make Aly
Trompas happier than to come
out on top again at the NCAA's.

THE TROMP — Sophomore Aly Trompas looks down the fairway
after hitting a tee shot during the Pac-8 Southern Division tournament
two weeks ago. After a disappointing freshman season, Trompas is
gradually regaining the form that made him the nation's top junior
golfer in 1969.
Aly Trompas began playing
golf at the age of five, won his
first trophy at seven, was shooting
in the 70's at 11, shot 67 in a
tournament at 15, and won the
U.S. Junior at 16. It wasn't until
last year, as a 19 year old
Stanford freshman, that Trompas
discovered that golf was a difficult
game.
After a junior career where
scores over 75 almost never
appeared on his card, Trompas
was suddenly struggling to break
80 in collegiate competition. His
tee shots were going sideways, the
putts stopped falling, and those
miraculous recovery shots that
used to skirt through forests
began to find unfriendly limbs
and fall back into the rough.
This year things have improved
considerably, but the sophomore
communication major from San
Diego is still struggling to regain

the form that made him the
nation's premier junior golfer in
1969.
"A lot of it's mental,"
Trompas said. "After I won the
national junior 1 was untouchable
for a year and a half because 1 had
so much confidence — I just felt I
was that much better than anyone
else."
Early Success
Trompas continued to play
with unbridled confidence during
his first few months at Stanford
list fall. He fired rounds of
68-74-68-71 for a three under par
281 total in qualifying rounds for
the team and during October and
November his worst 18 hole score
was 74.
But when he began to play
again after a short layoff in
December, golf stopped being so
easy. "I got into some bad swing
habits," Trompas said. "I was
lining up to the right and coming

over the ball."
The swing problems persisted
throughout the year and Trompas'
first collegiate season was a
disappointment. He averaged over
77 shots a round and wasn't even
one of the five players Coach Bud
Finger selected to go to the
NCAA's.
Since then Trompas has once
again grooved his powerful swing
and his scores have dropped
considerably. He is currently
averaging 74.6 in collegiate
tournaments and finished second
in two major tourneys before
placing a respectable ninth in the
Pac-B's last week. But the
tournament victories that came so
easy a few years ago have been
absent.
'Have A Chance'
"I've got my swing
straightened out so that when I
tee it up I know I have a chance,"
he said, "but I still have a lot of
work to do on my attitude. When
I played junior golf I thought a lot
better on the course — golf was
the only thing on my mind then.
Now there are a lot of other
things to think about.
"Some people have said that
chess is the closest sport to golf
and I can see where it is because
you need so much concentration

in both. In golf you know the
swing, but it just takes
tremendous concentration to
repeat it so many times with fluid
movements. That's why little
things distract golfers. I guess I'm
a temperamental golfer just like
Bobby Fischer is a temperamental
chess player."
Golfers have always been
among the world's most
temperamental athletes
("Tempestuous Tommy Bolt,"
wrote Sports Illustrated golf
writer Dan Jenkins, "once missed
a short putt that cost him a couple
of thousand dollars and paused to
talk it over with the Lord. 'Me
