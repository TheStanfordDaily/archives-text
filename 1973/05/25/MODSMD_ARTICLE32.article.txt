# Coach, Athletes Set For China Trips
## 
### 
Yesterday's disclosure that Stanford
basketball star Rich Kelley will tour China
this summer culminated a series of
announcements in the past few weeks
regarding goodwill tours for Stanford athletes.
Kelley, a seven-foot sophomore center, was
one of 12 players named to compete against
Chinese teams in eight exhibition games from
June 16 to July 5. Earlier the State
Department announced that a group of
swimmers headed by Stanford swimming and
water polo coach Jim Gaughran would leave
for China on June 2 for a series of exhibitions
and clinics.
Football quarterback Mike Boryla will also
be making a goodwill tour this summer.
Boryla was among a group of college football
players selected by the NCAA to tour military
bases and hospitals in Korea and the
Philippines.
Boryla's Far Eastern tour is co-sponsored
by the NCAA and the Department of Defense.

Gaughran and Stanford swim captain Brian
Job will be the first to leave for China. The
swimming contingent will assemble in Los
Angeles Tuesday, arrive in Hong Kong May
31, and enter the People's Republic of China
on June 2. The swimmers will leave China on
June 22 or 23.
Three Olympic gold medal winners are
scheduled to take part. They are Jane
Barkman, Wayne, Pa.; Karen Moe, Santa
Clara; and Air Force Capt. Micki King,
Pontiac, Mich.
The remainder of the group includes Mitch
Ivey, Santa Clara; Lynn Vidali, San Francisco;
Frank Heckl, Los Angeles; Bernie Wrightson,
Escondido; Steve Power, Seattle; and Ellie
Daniel, Elkins Park, Pa.
The basketball squad, which will meet in
Memphis on June 4 for nine days of practice
under Memphis State University coach Gene
Bartow, will leave for Hong Kong on June 13
before arriving in China on June 16. After

playing eight exhibition games during its
three week stay, the team will return to the
United States on July 8.
Bartow, whose Memphis State team lost to
UCLA in this year's NCAA finals, will direct
an impressive squad of collegiate stars. Kelley,
a first team All-Pacific Eight selection, wijl be
joined on the 12-man team by Larry Finch
and Ronnie Robinson of Memphis State; John
Schumate, Notre Dame; Alvin Adams,
Oklahoma; Kevin Stacom, Providence; George
Karl, North Carolina; James Andrews and
Kevin Grevey, Kentucky; George Pannell,
South Plains College; Donald Jackson, Xavier
of Louisiana; and Quinn Buckner, Indiana.
The basketball and swimming tours are two
examples of a continuing effort to better
U.S.-China relations through athletic
diplomacy. A team of American table tennis
players visited China for a series of exhibitions
against the Chinese team in April, 1971 and
the Chinese men's and women's gymnastics
teams are currently touring the United States.
