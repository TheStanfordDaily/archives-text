British Official Resigns
LONDON — A second British aristocrat with access to
allied defense secrets resigned from Britain's Conservative
government yesterday, admitting he had "some casual
affairs" with prostitutes.
The sex and security scandal is Britain's worst since the
Profumo affair 10 years ago.
Earl Jellicoe, government leader in the House of Lords,
conceded yesterday in a public resignation statement that
his actions were "a grave embarrassment" to Prime
Minister Edward Heath's administration.
Jellicoe, 55, has long been a close personal friend and
trusted adviser of Heath. As a senior Cabinet minister he
had full access to top secret government papers.
Jellicoe's confession came 24 hours after similar
admissions by Lord Lambton, who resigned as air force
minister, a sub-Cabinet post. Lambton said "some sneak
pimp" had photographed him with a call girl.
The prime minister acted swiftly to avoid any
suggestion of a cover-up. He told a hushed House of
Commons there will be an independent inquiry into
security implications of the scandal.
Both Jellicoe, former minister for the royal navy, and
Lambton denied that their links with call girls had
involved lawbreaking, blackmail or security leaks.
Representative Found Dead
BALTIMORE - U.S. Rep. William O. Mills (R-Md.), was
found shot to death in an apparent suicide yesterday after
newspapers reported he had failed to disclose a $25,000
campaign contribution from the Committee to Re-elect
the President.
"At the present time, it appears the cause of death was
the result of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in the chest,
although the investigation in the matter is continuing,"
Talbot County State's Atty. William S. Hom said.
Horn said a caretaker found Mills' body with a
12-gauge shotgun beside it.
Mills, 48, had called Easton radio station WEMD
Wednesday night with a statement denying any
wrongdoing in connection with the 1971 campaign
contribution.
The Baltimore Sun, in this morning's editions, said
police sources indicated Mills had left six "notes of a
personal nature."
The paper said one reportedly declared his innocence
of any wrong doing but went on to say: "There is no way
of proving my innocence. This is the only way out."
The Sun reported that notes were left to his wife, his
son, his daughter and "my thousands of friends and
supporters."
Deserter Speaks To House Panel
WASHINGTON — An Army deserter came out of hiding
yesterday to tell a group of congressmen that
unconditional amnesty will help erase a decade of
bitterness over the Indochina war.
Edward Sowder, 25, of Detroit, appeared before an
unofficial House panel discussing amnesty to men who
fled the draft, deserted or resisted the war while in the
service.
Following his remarks to the House panel, Sowder was
arrested.
His statement followed emotional testimony by his

mother, Lori, who said her working-class family could not
afford college for him to get him a deferment.
She said he went into the Army against her wishes and
that she told him the "only thing he could accomplish was
to get killed."
Sowder then entered the hearing room and told the
panel when he volunteered for Vietnam he supported the
war.
"I was assigned to an evacuation hospital where we
received fresh casualties direct from combat areas. Many
of these victims were Vietnamese civilians, mostly women
and children hit by U.S. artillery and bombing.
"Many had been severely burned by napalm and white
phosphorous, weapons used only by the U.S."
Repair Launch Blast-Off
CAPE KENNEDY — Skylab 1 astronauts, the first space
do-it-yourself repairmen, were poised for a 6 a.m. PDT
launch today and the start of a salvage mission which
must succeed if America's space station is to be saved.
Astronauts Charles Conrad Jr., Dr. Joseph P. Kerwin
and Paul J. Weitz were scheduled to be lofted into orbit
aboard an Apollo command ship packed with tools and
materials to repair the overheated and underpowered
Skylab station.
Engineers, scrambling to complete the sun shields to
shade the space station, raced against the clock to have
the devices ready.
Space Agency officials, meanwhile, hesitated in
selecting which of four sun shade designs to fly on Skylab
1 and in what order to attempt to deploy them.
"All of the devices work to one degree or another,"
said William C. Schneider, Skylab program director. "All
of the devices have drawbacks to one degree or another."
Nixon Speaks To Former POWs
WASHINGTON — President Nixon told a cheering,
applauding audience of former American POWs yesterday
that it is "time to stop making heroes out of those who
steal secrets and publish them in newspapers."
Nixon spoke to about 450 former Vietnam prisoners
and asked them to help his administration in keeping
America's military strength high.
The POWs were here for a special homecoming salute
from the President. A gala black-tie tent dinner on the
White House lawn was one of the features.
Without mentioning the Watergate scandal, the
President nonetheless touched on the matter of secrecy in
and by his administration.
Nixon said the U.S. would not have made the progress
toward peace in the first years of his administration if
there had not been secrecy.
"Had we not had the secrecy, had we not had secret
negotiations with North Vietnam, had we not had secret
negotiations with the Soviet Union . . . there would have
been no China initiative, to limitations on arms, no
summit."
Today's Weather
Mostly fair today through tomorrow. Slightly warmer
today. Low temperatures both nights in the upper 40s to
mid 50s. High today and tomorrow in the mid 60s to mid
70s. Light winds becoming northwesterly 15 to 25 mph
