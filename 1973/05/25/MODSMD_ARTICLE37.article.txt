# University Ads Called Anti-Union
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
While United Stanford Employees
(USE) has no official opposition in its
drive to unionize some 1600
University employees, the AFL-CIO
group has been faced with an
advertising campaign paid for by the
University which many feel expresses
an anti-union sentiment.
The series of advertisements which
has appeared in Wednesday's Campus
Report and Thursday's Daily for the
last three weeks, purports to "promote
an understanding of the election and
of the possible issues involved in the
outcome."
But the ASSU Council of Presidents
and the Law School Civil Rights
Organization have presented a
somewhat different view of the
advertising.
In a statement printed in
Wednesday's Daily, the groups charged
that "the article is an unfair
representation of the choice facing
workers on June 6," the date of the
National Labor Relations Board
election.
Straw Man
Basically, the law school-ASSU
group argues that last week's
advertisement puts up a "straw man"
by pointing out a number of
"undesirable" things, such as
negotiating large salary increases for
some and small increases for others, a
union canlegally do.
These "legal technicalities"
prompted USE President Glenda Jones
to remark, "they're talking about
unions in general. .. USE stands on its
own record on how it represents the
workers."
This week's University
advertisement, which appeared in
yesterday's Daily, deals specifically
with USE and its parent union, Service

Employees International Union
(SEIU), AFL-CIO.
One-half of the three-quarter page
ad deals with "union control of
employees." This section emphasized
penalties the union could impose on
individual members.
Among actions quoted for which
the SEIU could, under its constitution,
punish a member, are "disobedience to
the regulations, rules mandates, and
decrees of the International Union of
the Local Union," and "abuse, libel, or
slander of members or officers."
While SEIU could fine, suspend or
expell any member for one of these
catch-all offenses, SEIU organizer Bob
Anderson promised last month "the
International will not step in as long as
you [USE] keep your books straight."

Barton denies that the purpose of
this and previous advertisements is to
put USE in a bad light, and reiterated
the University's stated policy of
neutrality.
"Our purpose ... is to provide a
better understanding of what
collective bargaining means, and of its
legal implications. For most
individuals who are not experienced in
collective bargaining, this
[union-individual] relationship is
pretty foreign," Barton said.
The University, Barton continued,
wants to promote "a full rounding out
of the issues," and thus is speaking to
questions the union is not. Of
necessity, many of these issues would
be of interest to those planning to vote
no."
