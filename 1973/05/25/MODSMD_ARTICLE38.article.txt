# Four More Issues
## 
### 
With this issue, the Daily goes
on its holiday-cum-dead week
schedule for the remainder of the
quarter. There will be no paper on
Monday, May 28, because of the
Memorial Day holiday; there will,
however, be papers on Tuesday,
Wednesday and Thursday.
There will be no Daily Friday,
June 1, because of the start of
dead week. The sole dead week
issue — Tuesday, June 5 — will be
the final edition of the quarter.
The twice-weekly summer
Daily will resume publication
Tuesday, June 26.
