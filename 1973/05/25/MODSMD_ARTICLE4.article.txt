# Burglary For 'National Security'
## Barker Cites Cuban Ties 
### 
From The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - Bernard L. Barker
said yesterday he broke into the
Watergate Hotel "as a matter of
national security" to look for
documents showing leftist or Cuban
contributions to the Democratic
presidential campaign.
He said he found none.
"I considered it duty for my
country," Barker told the Senate
Watergate committee. He added he has
not changed his mind.
Foremost in his mind — and that of
the three Cuban-Americans arrested
with him — was to gain support in high
places for another operation to
liberate Cuba from the Communist
government of Fidel Castro.
"I am part of a team with which I
am very proud to be associated," said
Barker in a choked voice. "We'll have
to live with the word 'burglar.' But we
resent, very emotionally, the words
that we were hired.
"There was no need to buy our
silence. We were not for sale ... We're
just plain people who very truthfully
believed that Cuba has a right to live."
Denies Espionage
He denied suggestions from the
Senators that he was engaged not in a
national security operation, but in

political espionage.
Barker received limited immunity
for his appearance. He was preceded
on the stand by Gerald Alch, former
attorney for convicted conspirator
James W. McCord Jr.
Then the committee called Alfred
C. Baldwin, the former FBI agent who
monitored the wiretapped
conversations from Democratic Party
headquarters.
No Immunity
Baldwin said he had asked no
immunity tor his testimony, that he
relied on government promises not to
prosecute him if he agreed to testify.
Barker, whose parents are
Americans, was born in Cuba and
spent half his life there — part of the
time in the pre-Castro Cuban police.
He was one of five men arrested
inside the Democratic offices last June
17 and one of five who pleaded guilty
to conspiracy, burglary and illegal
wiretapping.
The Watergate hearings were
recessed today until June 5, for the
Memorial Day holiday.
Gray Warned Nixon
Meanwhile, former FBI acting
director L. Patrick Gray 111 said
yesterday that he warned President
Nixon last summer "that people on
your staff are trying to mortally
wound you."
Gray made the disclosure before a
closed session of a Senate
appropriations subcommittee and was
quoted by the subcommittee
chairman, Sen. John L. McClellan,
(D.-Ark.)
Gray told the subcommittee,
according to McClellan, that he spoke
to Nixon last July 6 after agreeing
with Lt. Gen. Vernon Walters, deputy
CIA director, that confusion had
arisen about the investigation of
Mexican aspects of the Watergate case.
Haldeman Gave Orders
Former CIA Director Richard
Helms has said that last June 23, White
House chief of staff H.R. Haldeman
instructed Walters to tell Gray that the
FBI should quash its Mexican
investigations for fear of uncovering
covert CIA operations in Mexico.

Gray testified yesterday that the
message was delivered and the FBI
investigation was curtailed for a time,
but that he went to Clark MacGregor,
director of Nixon's re-election
committee, and asked MacGregor to
inform Nixon that Haldeman's orders
were causing a lot of confusion.
On July 6, Gray said, Nixon called
him and Gray told him, "Mr.
President, there is something I want to
speak to you about. Dick Walters and I
feel that people on your staff are
trying to mortally wound you by using
the CIA and FBI and by confusing the
question of CIA interest in, or not in,
people the FBI wishes to interview.
McClellan said Gray reported Nixon
paused and then replied, "Pat, you just
continue to conduct your aggressive
and thorough investigation."
In another development, Secretary
of the Treasury George P. Shultz
announced he had asked for and
received the resignation from the
Treasury Department of John J.
Caulfield, who had testified Tuesday
he offered executive clemency to
Watergate defendant McCord in return
for his silence.
Caulfield, 44, had worked as a
security agent for Nixon's 1968
presidential campaign and in April
1969, joined the White House staff
under Counsel to the President John
W. Dean 111 as a liaison to law
enforcement agencies.
He has been on administrative leave
from the Treasury Department since
press reports tied him to the Watergate
scandal early last week.
Also yesterday, U.S. Atty. Harold
H. Titus Jr. said that a key figure in
the Watergate scandal will plead guilty
without immunity and testify for the
prosecution, and indictments of others
are expected in 60 to 90 days.
The New York Times last night said
government sources identified the
figure as Jeb Stuart Magruder, a
former White House aide and later an
assistant to former Atty. Gen. John N.
Mitchell on the Nixon re-election
committee.

House chief of staff H.R. Haldeman
instructed Walters to tell Gray that the
FBI should quash its Mexican
investigations for fear of uncovering
covert CIA operations in Mexico.

Gray testified yesterday that the
message was delivered and the FBI
investigation was curtailed for a time,
but that he went to Clark MacGregor,
director of Nixon's re-election
committee, and asked MacGregor to
inform Nixon that Haldeman's orders
were causing a lot of confusion.
On July 6, Gray said, Nixon called
him and Gray told him, "Mr.
President, there is something I want to
speak to you about. Dick Walters and I
feel that people on your staff are
trying to mortally wound you by using
the CIA and FBI and by confusing the
question of CIA interest in, or not in,
people the FBI wishes to interview.
McClellan said Gray reported Nixon
paused and then replied, "Pat, you just
continue to conduct your aggressive
and thorough investigation."
In another development, Secretary
of the Treasury George P. Shultz
announced he had asked for and
received the resignation from the
Treasury Department of John J.
Caulfield, who had testified Tuesday
he offered executive clemency to
Watergate defendant McCord in return
for his silence.
Caulfield, 44, had worked as a
security agent for Nixon's 1968
presidential campaign and in April
1969, joined the White House staff
under Counsel to the President John
W. Dean 111 as a liaison to law
enforcement agencies.
He has been on administrative leave
from the Treasury Department since
press reports tied him to the Watergate
scandal early last week.
Also yesterday, U.S. Atty. Harold
H. Titus Jr. said that a key figure in
the Watergate scandal will plead guilty
without immunity and testify for the
prosecution, and indictments of others
are expected in 60 to 90 days.
The New York Times last night said
government sources identified the
figure as Jeb Stuart Magruder, a
former White House aide and later an
assistant to former Atty. Gen. John N.
Mitchell on the Nixon re-election
committee.
From The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - Bernard L. Barker
said yesterday he broke into the
Watergate Hotel "as a matter of
national security" to look for
documents showing leftist or Cuban
contributions to the Democratic
presidential campaign.
He said he found none.
"I considered it duty for my
country," Barker told the Senate
Watergate committee. He added he has
not changed his mind.
Foremost in his mind — and that of
the three Cuban-Americans arrested
with him — was to gain support in high
places for another operation to
liberate Cuba from the Communist
government of Fidel Castro.
"I am part of a team with which I
am very proud to be associated," said
Barker in a choked voice. "We'll have
to live with the word 'burglar.' But we
resent, very emotionally, the words
that we were hired.
"There was no need to buy our
silence. We were not for sale ... We're
just plain people who very truthfully
believed that Cuba has a right to live."
Denies Espionage
He denied suggestions from the
Senators that he was engaged not in a
national security operation, but in

political espionage.
Barker received limited immunity
for his appearance. He was preceded
on the stand by Gerald Alch, former
attorney for convicted conspirator
James W. McCord Jr.
Then the committee called Alfred
C. Baldwin, the former FBI agent who
monitored the wiretapped
conversations from Democratic Party
headquarters.
No Immunity
Baldwin said he had asked no
immunity tor his testimony, that he
relied on government promises not to
prosecute him if he agreed to testify.
Barker, whose parents are
Americans, was born in Cuba and
spent half his life there — part of the
time in the pre-Castro Cuban police.
He was one of five men arrested
inside the Democratic offices last June
17 and one of five who pleaded guilty
to conspiracy, burglary and illegal
wiretapping.
The Watergate hearings were
recessed today until June 5, for the
Memorial Day holiday.
Gray Warned Nixon
Meanwhile, former FBI acting
director L. Patrick Gray 111 said
yesterday that he warned President
Nixon last summer "that people on
your staff are trying to mortally
wound you."
Gray made the disclosure before a
closed session of a Senate
appropriations subcommittee and was
quoted by the subcommittee
chairman, Sen. John L. McClellan,
(D.-Ark.)
Gray told the subcommittee,
according to McClellan, that he spoke
to Nixon last July 6 after agreeing
with Lt. Gen. Vernon Walters, deputy
CIA director, that confusion had
arisen about the investigation of
Mexican aspects of the Watergate case.

am very proud to be associated," said
Barker in a choked voice. "We'll have
to live with the word 'burglar.' But we
resent, very emotionally, the words
that we were hired.
"There was no need to buy our
silence. We were not for sale ... We're
just plain people who very truthfully
believed that Cuba has a right to live."
Denies Espionage
He denied suggestions from the
Senators that he was engaged not in a
national security operation, but in

political espionage.
Barker received limited immunity
for his appearance. He was preceded
on the stand by Gerald Alch, former
attorney for convicted conspirator
James W. McCord Jr.
Then the committee called Alfred
C. Baldwin, the former FBI agent who
monitored the wiretapped
conversations from Democratic Party
headquarters.
No Immunity
Baldwin said he had asked no
immunity tor his testimony, that he
relied on government promises not to
prosecute him if he agreed to testify.
Barker, whose parents are
Americans, was born in Cuba and
spent half his life there — part of the
time in the pre-Castro Cuban police.
He was one of five men arrested
inside the Democratic offices last June
17 and one of five who pleaded guilty
to conspiracy, burglary and illegal
wiretapping.
The Watergate hearings were
recessed today until June 5, for the
Memorial Day holiday.
Gray Warned Nixon
Meanwhile, former FBI acting
director L. Patrick Gray 111 said
yesterday that he warned President
Nixon last summer "that people on
your staff are trying to mortally
wound you."
Gray made the disclosure before a
closed session of a Senate
appropriations subcommittee and was
quoted by the subcommittee
chairman, Sen. John L. McClellan,
(D.-Ark.)
Gray told the subcommittee,
according to McClellan, that he spoke
to Nixon last July 6 after agreeing
with Lt. Gen. Vernon Walters, deputy
CIA director, that confusion had
arisen about the investigation of
Mexican aspects of the Watergate case.
Haldeman Gave Orders
Former CIA Director Richard
Helms has said that last June 23, White
House chief of staff H.R. Haldeman
instructed Walters to tell Gray that the
FBI should quash its Mexican
investigations for fear of uncovering
covert CIA operations in Mexico.

Gray testified yesterday that the
message was delivered and the FBI
investigation was curtailed for a time,
but that he went to Clark MacGregor,
director of Nixon's re-election
committee, and asked MacGregor to
inform Nixon that Haldeman's orders
were causing a lot of confusion.
On July 6, Gray said, Nixon called
him and Gray told him, "Mr.
President, there is something I want to
speak to you about. Dick Walters and I
feel that people on your staff are
trying to mortally wound you by using
the CIA and FBI and by confusing the
question of CIA interest in, or not in,
people the FBI wishes to interview.
McClellan said Gray reported Nixon
paused and then replied, "Pat, you just
continue to conduct your aggressive
and thorough investigation."
In another development, Secretary
of the Treasury George P. Shultz
announced he had asked for and
received the resignation from the
Treasury Department of John J.
Caulfield, who had testified Tuesday
he offered executive clemency to
Watergate defendant McCord in return
for his silence.
Caulfield, 44, had worked as a
security agent for Nixon's 1968
presidential campaign and in April
1969, joined the White House staff
under Counsel to the President John
W. Dean 111 as a liaison to law
enforcement agencies.
He has been on administrative leave
from the Treasury Department since
press reports tied him to the Watergate
scandal early last week.
Also yesterday, U.S. Atty. Harold
H. Titus Jr. said that a key figure in
the Watergate scandal will plead guilty
without immunity and testify for the
prosecution, and indictments of others
are expected in 60 to 90 days.
The New York Times last night said
government sources identified the
figure as Jeb Stuart Magruder, a
former White House aide and later an
assistant to former Atty. Gen. John N.
Mitchell on the Nixon re-election
committee.
