# State Senator Analyzes '74 Politics
## 
### CHESS ERWIN 
State Sen. Mervyn Dymally (D-Los
Angeles), officially undeclared but
very much running for the office of
lieutenant governor, said yesterday
that the main issue in his campaign
would be the "reconciliation of the
various factions" in the state.
Speaking at a forum sponsored by
the Graduate School of Business,
Dymally said that the primary danger
for a black politician was in being
what he termed "super black." "In
order to campaign effectively at the
statewide level," he explained, "a
minority candidate must be able to
accommodate other groups as well."
Dymally stated that although
reconciliation was his primary issue, a
number of other topics were very
important. Among these are the
closing of tax loopholes through which
he said California loses $300 million
annually, and the promotion of "a
healthy economy."
Education
Higher education is also a major
issue, said Dymally. He advocates an
"open college" system where blue
collar workers in particular would be
able to attend school at night and on
weekends. "Working people have been
subsidizing the education of middle
class, mostly white students, for a long
time. It's time for them to get a piece
of the action."
Dymally also stressed the
importance of politics for minorities as
a "new option for involvement." He
added that he was "philosophically
against black capitalism" and that civil

rights activism yielded few direct
results. "Civil rights tends to be too
idealistic and doesn't deal with the
bread and butter issues that face
minorities."
For any politician starting out,
image is very important, commented
Dymally. This is especially true for a
black candidate, he noted. In order to
succeed however, a person must make
connections and form coalitions with
people sympathetic to their cause. He
cited Los Angeles mayoral candidate
Tom Bradley as a good example of this
phenomenon.
Crucial Politics
"Coalition politics are crucial to a
candidate's success. A person can serve
his constituents but be open to other
people too," noted Dymally. "Often,
the 'drop out' philosophy is dangerous
for minorities because they miss
opportunities to participate actively in
the political system."
Dymally said that he chose to run
for lieutenant governor because "there
wasn't much competition for the job"
and because he said that he doesn't
like to handle money. He also stated
that the duties of the office were more
closely in line with his personal
interests.
According to Dymally, he now has
fund-raisers working for him in seven
cities. He said that local campaign
organizations are also being assembled
in certain areas of the state. "It is
possible that mv campaign could
collapse internally, though, if there is
too much staff in-fighting or I can't
'turn people on' or just don't get
enough money."

UNDECLARED? — State Sen. Mervyn Dymally (D-Los Angeles) said yesterday
that the main issues in his 1974 campaign for lieutenant governor would be
"reconciliation of the various factions ' in the state, closing tax loopholes, the
promotion of a "healthy economy," and higher education. Dymally was
speaking at a forum sponsored hy the Graduate School of Business.
State Sen. Mervyn Dymally (D-Los
Angeles), officially undeclared but
very much running for the office of
lieutenant governor, said yesterday
that the main issue in his campaign
would be the "reconciliation of the
various factions" in the state.
Speaking at a forum sponsored by
the Graduate School of Business,
Dymally said that the primary danger
for a black politician was in being
what he termed "super black." "In
order to campaign effectively at the
statewide level," he explained, "a
minority candidate must be able to
accommodate other groups as well."
Dymally stated that although
reconciliation was his primary issue, a
number of other topics were very
important. Among these are the
closing of tax loopholes through which
he said California loses $300 million
annually, and the promotion of "a
healthy economy."
Education
Higher education is also a major
issue, said Dymally. He advocates an
"open college" system where blue
collar workers in particular would be
able to attend school at night and on
weekends. "Working people have been
subsidizing the education of middle
class, mostly white students, for a long
time. It's time for them to get a piece
of the action."
Dymally also stressed the
importance of politics for minorities as
a "new option for involvement." He
added that he was "philosophically
against black capitalism" and that civil

rights activism yielded few direct
results. "Civil rights tends to be too
idealistic and doesn't deal with the
bread and butter issues that face
minorities."
For any politician starting out,
image is very important, commented
Dymally. This is especially true for a
black candidate, he noted. In order to
succeed however, a person must make
connections and form coalitions with
people sympathetic to their cause. He
cited Los Angeles mayoral candidate
Tom Bradley as a good example of this
phenomenon.
Crucial Politics
"Coalition politics are crucial to a
candidate's success. A person can serve
his constituents but be open to other
people too," noted Dymally. "Often,
the 'drop out' philosophy is dangerous
for minorities because they miss
opportunities to participate actively in
the political system."
Dymally said that he chose to run
for lieutenant governor because "there
wasn't much competition for the job"
and because he said that he doesn't
like to handle money. He also stated
that the duties of the office were more
closely in line with his personal
interests.
According to Dymally, he now has
fund-raisers working for him in seven
cities. He said that local campaign
organizations are also being assembled
in certain areas of the state. "It is
possible that mv campaign could
collapse internally, though, if there is
too much staff in-fighting or I can't
'turn people on' or just don't get
enough money."
