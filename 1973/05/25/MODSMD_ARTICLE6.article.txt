# After The Council Elections
## Palo Alto And Berkeley 
### 
lbjul Robert Bacon

Is Palo Alto becoming another
Berkeley? The question came up
occasionally during the recent
Palo Alto municipal election
campaign. But a moment's
thought leads one to answer "no"
not only to that question but to
the more fundamental one, can
Palo Alto become another
Berkeley?
The subject is usually brought
up by conservatives who see Palo
Alto moving down the road to
radicalism and socialism. Unless a
conservative majority is returned
to the City Council, they seem to
imply (although they don't state
it so bluntly), Palo Alto will in a
few years have rampant crime and
narcotics addiction, a civilian
police review board, rent control,
and thousands of unshorn and
unbathed hippies swarming
downtown.
Ridiculous. In the first place,
the liberal Council majority,
which won another two years in
office this month, made it very
clear both before and during the
campaign that they did not
support rent control, a civilian
police review board, Council
meeting disruptions, and large
amounts of high-density low-rent
housing for minority groups. Palo
Alto's rehabilitation program for
narcotics addicts and its
not-yet-functioning apartment
manager licensing ordinance
hardly put it in the same league
with the "Athens of the West" as
a dispenser of municipal social
services.
Major Universities
That's one answer. But there is
another that is more fundamental,
that goes to the question, can Palo
Alto become another Berkeley?
The two cities have in common
their proximity to major
universities; the relevant similarity
stops there.
Palo Alto is, for better or
worse, an upper-middle-class
white suburb of 56,000 people 30
miles form San Francisco,
separated by a mile-wide park

from a relatively small major
private residential university
which is not within its
jurisdiction. It worries about
conserving its thousands of open
foothill acres.
It lives on commerce and
finance and high-technology light
industry. Its college student
population is fairly small, as is its
component of nonwhites and
poor people. The average Palo
Alto voter leaves for the polls
from a single-family house on a
tree-shaded street.
Across The Bay
Contrast that with the city
across the Bay — more urban than
suburban, more than twice Palo
Alto's size, almost one-third
black, adjoining industrial and
majority-nonwhite Oakland. In its
midst is the University of
California and its 27,000 students.
Berkeley has its high-income
hill district, but it is
counterbalanced by
predominantly black West
Berkeley and the politically and
socially volatile South Campus. It
is a city of renters and
apartment-dwellers, of the poor,
of blacks, and of students. It has
no vast open spaces left to
conserve.
The people who study voting
behavior would be rather shocked
if they found two such cities to be
politically alike. The people who
find similarities are those who
can't distinguish liberalism from
radicalism.
Conservatives
What Berkeley calls
"conservatives" are at least as far
left as are Palo Alto's "liberals."
Each group got about half the
vote in the recent municipal
elections. But in Berkeley the
other half went to the radicals and
only a handful to conservatives,
and here the other half was won
by the conservatives and it was
the radicals who finished under 10
percent.
The comparison of the two

cities indicates that for the next
few years there is little reason to
expect them to move together.
The people who worry about
Palo Alto becoming another
Berkeley shouldn't fear; their job
is easy. The ones who have their
work cut out for them are those
who are trying to make Palo Alto
politically like the city in the East
Bay.
Except in one area — electric
utilities. Palo Alto has had a
municipal electric utility since
1899. Berkeley is served by
PG&E, and last month its voters
rejected a proposal to buy out the
giant privately-owned utility's
Berkeley facilities. That was a
campaign to make Berkeley like
Palo Alto — and it failed, too.

Across The Bay
Contrast that with the city
across the Bay — more urban than
suburban, more than twice Palo
Alto's size, almost one-third
black, adjoining industrial and
majority-nonwhite Oakland. In its
midst is the University of
California and its 27,000 students.
Berkeley has its high-income
hill district, but it is
counterbalanced by
predominantly black West
Berkeley and the politically and
socially volatile South Campus. It
is a city of renters and
apartment-dwellers, of the poor,
of blacks, and of students. It has
no vast open spaces left to
conserve.
The people who study voting
behavior would be rather shocked
if they found two such cities to be
politically alike. The people who
find similarities are those who
can't distinguish liberalism from
radicalism.
Conservatives
What Berkeley calls
"conservatives" are at least as far
left as are Palo Alto's "liberals."
Each group got about half the
vote in the recent municipal
elections. But in Berkeley the
other half went to the radicals and
only a handful to conservatives,
and here the other half was won
by the conservatives and it was
the radicals who finished under 10
percent.
The comparison of the two

cities indicates that for the next
few years there is little reason to
expect them to move together.
The people who worry about
Palo Alto becoming another
Berkeley shouldn't fear; their job
is easy. The ones who have their
work cut out for them are those
who are trying to make Palo Alto
politically like the city in the East
Bay.
Except in one area — electric
utilities. Palo Alto has had a
municipal electric utility since
1899. Berkeley is served by
PG&E, and last month its voters
rejected a proposal to buy out the
giant privately-owned utility's
Berkeley facilities. That was a
campaign to make Berkeley like
Palo Alto — and it failed, too.

Is Palo Alto becoming another
Berkeley? The question came up
occasionally during the recent
Palo Alto municipal election
campaign. But a moment's
thought leads one to answer "no"
not only to that question but to
the more fundamental one, can
Palo Alto become another
Berkeley?
The subject is usually brought
up by conservatives who see Palo
Alto moving down the road to
radicalism and socialism. Unless a
conservative majority is returned
to the City Council, they seem to
imply (although they don't state
it so bluntly), Palo Alto will in a
few years have rampant crime and
narcotics addiction, a civilian
police review board, rent control,
and thousands of unshorn and
unbathed hippies swarming
downtown.
Ridiculous. In the first place,
the liberal Council majority,
which won another two years in
office this month, made it very
clear both before and during the
campaign that they did not
support rent control, a civilian
police review board, Council
meeting disruptions, and large
amounts of high-density low-rent
housing for minority groups. Palo
Alto's rehabilitation program for
narcotics addicts and its
not-yet-functioning apartment
manager licensing ordinance
hardly put it in the same league
with the "Athens of the West" as
a dispenser of municipal social
services.
Major Universities
That's one answer. But there is
another that is more fundamental,
that goes to the question, can Palo
Alto become another Berkeley?
The two cities have in common
their proximity to major
universities; the relevant similarity
stops there.
Palo Alto is, for better or
worse, an upper-middle-class
white suburb of 56,000 people 30
miles form San Francisco,
separated by a mile-wide park

from a relatively small major
private residential university
which is not within its
jurisdiction. It worries about
conserving its thousands of open
foothill acres.
It lives on commerce and
finance and high-technology light
industry. Its college student
population is fairly small, as is its
component of nonwhites and
poor people. The average Palo
Alto voter leaves for the polls
from a single-family house on a
tree-shaded street.
Across The Bay
Contrast that with the city
across the Bay — more urban than
suburban, more than twice Palo
Alto's size, almost one-third
