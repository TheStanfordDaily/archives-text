# Reunions 50 Years Hence'
## The 						Kinky Old Class Of '74 
### 
Jerry Coleman

THE TIME: June 13, 2024.
THE PLACE: A lead-lined underground grotto, 500 feet below the
site of the former Bowman Alumni House.
THE SCENE: The 50 year reunion of the Stanford Class of 74. The
300-odd members left are gathered, in formal attire, around the punch
bowl, reminiscing. Former Daily columnist Jerry Coleman, arrives
with his date, a ravishingly beautiful dolphin in a pink, floor-length
evening gown; the dolphin, a three-time winner of the Miss South
Pacific Aquatic Denizens Beauty Queen title, comes equipped with a
portable swim tank and an English/Squeak — Squeak/English
translational device. Coleman sees classmate and Senior Class
Co-President Dean Francis "Duck" Smith 111, and moves across the
cavern to greet him.
Gas
COLEMAN: Deano! Swell party you planned. But why no 20, 30
or 40 year reunion?
SMITH: Well, ever since the war, so many groups have been after
this radiation-free room that this is the first date we could reserve it.
And by the way, take off your gas mask: the air is clean down here.
COLEMAN: Great. And Dean, I'd like you to meet "Bubbles," my
date.
Red Paint?
SMITH: (Shaking her flipper) It's a pleasure. Why don't we all go
over to the punch bowl and reminisce.
COLEMAN: We sure had some great activities senior year, eh
Deano? I mean, take that field trip you and the others planned to

Golden Gate Park. All 1400 of us seniors filling Stowe Lake up with
wine, then diving in. And remember the Museum of Unnatural
Sciences ... the iguanas and all that red paint?
SMITH: How could I ever forget the iguanas. I almost died
laughing when you took those roller skates and the riding crop,
and ... but do YOU remember the aquarium?
Stewardesses
COLEMAN: Ah, yes — the Aquarium! (To Bubbles) You know,
sweetheart, I met your mother for the first time right there. Oh but
Deano, that Opportunities Day you planned for Winter Quarter was
an insightful idea too: having that panel discussion on career
possibilities with the stewardess, the nurse, and the fireman.
SMITH: You forgot the plumber.
COLEMAN: Yeah, we did have a plumber on the panel. But I can't
remember why.
The Bry
SMITH: Because at $18 an hour he made more than any of the
others.
COLEMAN: And remember how we stayed up hours think what
our Senior Gift would be? We finally decided on that crazy plan to
cover the entire Quad with astroturf. Remember that night in May
when the whole class tiptoed to the Quad and began tearing out the
concrete and rolling down the carpet of grass?
SMITH: We even posted guards all around the outside to make an
imitation owl's hoot if they saw anyone coming. Then, if we heard a
hoot, we'd jump into the bushes in the center of the Quad and wait
until the coast was clear.
Stood On
COLEMAN: Right! And around 2 a.m., we squeezed all 1400 into
those bushes when the Campus Police made their patrol, and they
never even noticed us! Boy, was Lyman surprised to see a
grass-covered Quad the next morning.
SMITH: There wouldn't have been any trouble if the Senior Freak
Brigade hadn't planted the wrong kind of grass right outside Bldg. 10.
COLEMAN: I guess I appreciated Graduation Ceremony the best.
The National Anthem never sounded better than that day with Carole
King singing it.
The Burning
SMITH: Carole King? I thought a couple sang the Anthem; you
know, some guy and his wife. Now who was it?
COLEMAN: Julie and David Eisenhower!
SMITH: Yeah, that's it. But the graduation speech was the finest
part of the afternoon. We worked awful hard to get Clint Eastwood
up to speak.
Deck
COLEMAN: You sure did a fine job picking his topic. I never felt
more proud than that day when I heard Eastwood's speech: "The
Youth of Today — Adults of Tomorrow."
SMITH: Looks like we're in for some entertainment right now,
too.
(A giant pie is brought in, decorated to show the portions of the
budget of the 1974 American Medical Association. As the pie is set
down, a male intern in a white labcoat with a sash across his cest
reading, "2024/' pops out, to the accompaniment of the Stanford
Band. A portion of the cavern's ceiling opens, dropping streams of
confetti over the celebrants?, as well as admitting some deadly rays of
surface radiation which cause fainting spells among the weaker class
members. Pandemonium breaks loose, and runs amok throughout the
cavern until his keepers can recapture him. Finally, some order is
restored.)
SMITH: Well, Jer. Looks like we're all out of fun activity for the
moment. But the evening's still young. I'm sure you'll be able to come
up with something that'll bring life back to the party. Any ideas?
COLEMAN: (After a quick, whispered conference with his date.)
How about raffling off two hours of fun with Bubbles in her tank?
SMITH: Fantastic! Something like that hasn't been done for 50
years. I'll go find a deck of cards. ...
(Jerry Coleman sure does have a healthy streak of self-respect. But,
gentle reader, fake heart: this is his last column — this year. For the
time being, you won't have Coleman to kick around any more.)

Jerry Coleman

THE TIME: June 13, 2024.
THE PLACE: A lead-lined underground grotto, 500 feet below the
site of the former Bowman Alumni House.
THE SCENE: The 50 year reunion of the Stanford Class of 74. The
300-odd members left are gathered, in formal attire, around the punch
bowl, reminiscing. Former Daily columnist Jerry Coleman, arrives
with his date, a ravishingly beautiful dolphin in a pink, floor-length
evening gown; the dolphin, a three-time winner of the Miss South
Pacific Aquatic Denizens Beauty Queen title, comes equipped with a
portable swim tank and an English/Squeak — Squeak/English
translational device. Coleman sees classmate and Senior Class
Co-President Dean Francis "Duck" Smith 111, and moves across the
cavern to greet him.
Gas
COLEMAN: Deano! Swell party you planned. But why no 20, 30
or 40 year reunion?
SMITH: Well, ever since the war, so many groups have been after
this radiation-free room that this is the first date we could reserve it.
And by the way, take off your gas mask: the air is clean down here.
COLEMAN: Great. And Dean, I'd like you to meet "Bubbles," my
date.
Red Paint?
SMITH: (Shaking her flipper) It's a pleasure. Why don't we all go
over to the punch bowl and reminisce.
COLEMAN: We sure had some great activities senior year, eh
Deano? I mean, take that field trip you and the others planned to

Golden Gate Park. All 1400 of us seniors filling Stowe Lake up with
wine, then diving in. And remember the Museum of Unnatural
Sciences ... the iguanas and all that red paint?
SMITH: How could I ever forget the iguanas. I almost died
laughing when you took those roller skates and the riding crop,
and ... but do YOU remember the aquarium?
Stewardesses
COLEMAN: Ah, yes — the Aquarium! (To Bubbles) You know,
sweetheart, I met your mother for the first time right there. Oh but
Deano, that Opportunities Day you planned for Winter Quarter was
an insightful idea too: having that panel discussion on career
possibilities with the stewardess, the nurse, and the fireman.
SMITH: You forgot the plumber.
COLEMAN: Yeah, we did have a plumber on the panel. But I can't
remember why.
The Bry
SMITH: Because at $18 an hour he made more than any of the
others.
COLEMAN: And remember how we stayed up hours think what
our Senior Gift would be? We finally decided on that crazy plan to
cover the entire Quad with astroturf. Remember that night in May
when the whole class tiptoed to the Quad and began tearing out the
concrete and rolling down the carpet of grass?
SMITH: We even posted guards all around the outside to make an
imitation owl's hoot if they saw anyone coming. Then, if we heard a
hoot, we'd jump into the bushes in the center of the Quad and wait
until the coast was clear.
Stood On
COLEMAN: Right! And around 2 a.m., we squeezed all 1400 into
those bushes when the Campus Police made their patrol, and they
never even noticed us! Boy, was Lyman surprised to see a
grass-covered Quad the next morning.
SMITH: There wouldn't have been any trouble if the Senior Freak
Brigade hadn't planted the wrong kind of grass right outside Bldg. 10.
COLEMAN: I guess I appreciated Graduation Ceremony the best.
The National Anthem never sounded better than that day with Carole
King singing it.
The Burning
SMITH: Carole King? I thought a couple sang the Anthem; you
know, some guy and his wife. Now who was it?
COLEMAN: Julie and David Eisenhower!
SMITH: Yeah, that's it. But the graduation speech was the finest
part of the afternoon. We worked awful hard to get Clint Eastwood
up to speak.
Deck
COLEMAN: You sure did a fine job picking his topic. I never felt
more proud than that day when I heard Eastwood's speech: "The
Youth of Today — Adults of Tomorrow."
SMITH: Looks like we're in for some entertainment right now,
too.
(A giant pie is brought in, decorated to show the portions of the
budget of the 1974 American Medical Association. As the pie is set
down, a male intern in a white labcoat with a sash across his cest
reading, "2024/' pops out, to the accompaniment of the Stanford
Band. A portion of the cavern's ceiling opens, dropping streams of
confetti over the celebrants?, as well as admitting some deadly rays of
surface radiation which cause fainting spells among the weaker class
members. Pandemonium breaks loose, and runs amok throughout the
cavern until his keepers can recapture him. Finally, some order is
restored.)

SMITH: Looks like we're in for some entertainment right now,
too.
(A giant pie is brought in, decorated to show the portions of the
budget of the 1974 American Medical Association. As the pie is set
down, a male intern in a white labcoat with a sash across his cest

Band. A portion of the cavern's ceiling opens, dropping streams of
confetti over the celebrants?, as well as admitting some deadly rays of
surface radiation which cause fainting spells among the weaker class
members. Pandemonium breaks loose, and runs amok throughout the
cavern until his keepers can recapture him. Finally, some order is
restored.)
SMITH: Well, Jer. Looks like we're all out of fun activity for the
moment. But the evening's still young. I'm sure you'll be able to come
up with something that'll bring life back to the party. Any ideas?
COLEMAN: (After a quick, whispered conference with his date.)
How about raffling off two hours of fun with Bubbles in her tank?
SMITH: Fantastic! Something like that hasn't been done for 50
years. I'll go find a deck of cards. ...

gentle reader, fake heart: this is his last column — this year. For the

Jerry Coleman

THE TIME: June 13, 2024.
THE PLACE: A lead-lined underground grotto, 500 feet below the
site of the former Bowman Alumni House.
THE SCENE: The 50 year reunion of the Stanford Class of 74. The
300-odd members left are gathered, in formal attire, around the punch
bowl, reminiscing. Former Daily columnist Jerry Coleman, arrives
with his date, a ravishingly beautiful dolphin in a pink, floor-length
evening gown; the dolphin, a three-time winner of the Miss South
Pacific Aquatic Denizens Beauty Queen title, comes equipped with a
portable swim tank and an English/Squeak — Squeak/English
translational device. Coleman sees classmate and Senior Class
Co-President Dean Francis "Duck" Smith 111, and moves across the
cavern to greet him.
Gas
COLEMAN: Deano! Swell party you planned. But why no 20, 30
or 40 year reunion?
SMITH: Well, ever since the war, so many groups have been after
this radiation-free room that this is the first date we could reserve it.
And by the way, take off your gas mask: the air is clean down here.
COLEMAN: Great. And Dean, I'd like you to meet "Bubbles," my
date.
Red Paint?
SMITH: (Shaking her flipper) It's a pleasure. Why don't we all go
over to the punch bowl and reminisce.
COLEMAN: We sure had some great activities senior year, eh
Deano? I mean, take that field trip you and the others planned to

Golden Gate Park. All 1400 of us seniors filling Stowe Lake up with
wine, then diving in. And remember the Museum of Unnatural
Sciences ... the iguanas and all that red paint?
SMITH: How could I ever forget the iguanas. I almost died
laughing when you took those roller skates and the riding crop,
and ... but do YOU remember the aquarium?
Stewardesses
COLEMAN: Ah, yes — the Aquarium! (To Bubbles) You know,
sweetheart, I met your mother for the first time right there. Oh but
Deano, that Opportunities Day you planned for Winter Quarter was
an insightful idea too: having that panel discussion on career
possibilities with the stewardess, the nurse, and the fireman.
SMITH: You forgot the plumber.
COLEMAN: Yeah, we did have a plumber on the panel. But I can't
remember why.
The Bry
SMITH: Because at $18 an hour he made more than any of the
others.
COLEMAN: And remember how we stayed up hours think what
our Senior Gift would be? We finally decided on that crazy plan to
cover the entire Quad with astroturf. Remember that night in May
when the whole class tiptoed to the Quad and began tearing out the
concrete and rolling down the carpet of grass?
SMITH: We even posted guards all around the outside to make an
imitation owl's hoot if they saw anyone coming. Then, if we heard a
hoot, we'd jump into the bushes in the center of the Quad and wait
until the coast was clear.
Stood On
COLEMAN: Right! And around 2 a.m., we squeezed all 1400 into
those bushes when the Campus Police made their patrol, and they
never even noticed us! Boy, was Lyman surprised to see a
grass-covered Quad the next morning.
SMITH: There wouldn't have been any trouble if the Senior Freak
Brigade hadn't planted the wrong kind of grass right outside Bldg. 10.
COLEMAN: I guess I appreciated Graduation Ceremony the best.
The National Anthem never sounded better than that day with Carole
King singing it.
The Burning
SMITH: Carole King? I thought a couple sang the Anthem; you
know, some guy and his wife. Now who was it?
COLEMAN: Julie and David Eisenhower!
SMITH: Yeah, that's it. But the graduation speech was the finest
part of the afternoon. We worked awful hard to get Clint Eastwood
up to speak.
Deck
COLEMAN: You sure did a fine job picking his topic. I never felt
more proud than that day when I heard Eastwood's speech: "The
Youth of Today — Adults of Tomorrow."
SMITH: Looks like we're in for some entertainment right now,
too.
