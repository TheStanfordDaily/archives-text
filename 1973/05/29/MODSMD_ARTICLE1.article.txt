# C-15 Approves Student Majority In Campus Judicial Proposal
## 
### KEVIN SMITH 
The Committee of 15 (C-15) last
Thursday approved its
recommendation for a new student
judicial system with provisions for a
student majority. The proposed
system passed the committee by a 14
to 1 vote, with only student Rich
Simons voting against it.
However the proposal makes it
possible for the University President,
the Academic Senate or the ASSU
Senate to terminate the student
majority at any time. In order to get
faculty and administration members of
the C-15 to approve a student
majority, students on the committee
agreed to a provision stating:
"Upon determining that the SJC is
impaired by the composition of that
body, the University President, or

two-thirds of those members of the
ASSU Senate presem and voting or
two-thirds of those members of the
Academic Senate present and voting
may reduce the number of student
positions on the SJC by one."
If this right were exercised, then
the composition of the SJC would be
identical to the current Campus
Judicial Panel (CJP), which has three
student members, three faculty
members and a faculty chairman who
would vote in case of a tie.
CJP Replacement
In order to take effect, the new
system, called the Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC), must be approved by
President Lyman, the Academic
Senate and the ASSU Senate. If passed
it would replace the CJP which was
established in 1971 by Lyman as an

interim system until a new proposal
was accepted.
The proposal calls for a panel
composed of four students, three
faculty members and a chairman from
the Law School, who would only vote
in the event of a tie.
Faculty members of the panel
would continue to be selected by the
Academic Senate.
Students would be chosen by a
complicated process in which the Dean
of Student Affairs would compile a list
of 60 randomly selected students.
The first 12 students on the list
who agree to serve on the SJC would
appear before a panel of two people:
the ASSU President or his designate,
and an individual selected by the
Academic Senate. Each of these two
people would be permitted to veto up
to three members from the original list
of 12.
The four student positions on the
SJC would then be filled by those four
students remaining at the top of the
list.
New Committee
If the system is adopted, the C-15
would cease to exist and would be
replaced by the Committee on Charter
Amendments (CCA) which would be
responsible for deliberating all
proposed changes of the SJC and the
Student Conduct Legislative Council
(SCLC).
The proposed system would
continue to use hearing officers to
determine the facts of cases brought
before the SJC.
Explaining why a student majority
was finally approved by the faculty
and administration on the C-15,
Committee Chairman Jim Anderson, a
student, speculated, "One of the
principal reasons was the way students
handled themselves in the Committee.
We showed them that we weren't
screaming radicals intent upon
destroying the University."
Another student member of the

C-15, Tom Flohr, attributed the
acceptance of the proposal by faculty
and administration members of the
Committee in part to their desire to
have student legitimation of the
system, but cautioned, "Our
bargaining power fades with each
passing year; this is probably our last
chance to exert any bargaining
power."
Anderson insisted that the
provision allowing abolition of the
student majority at any time "was
necessary to get a student majority."
Law Prof. Jack Friedenthal, a C-15
member who opposed a student
majority for the judicial system in the
past, said he changed his mind because
he believes "in a constitutional
government I think we ought to have a
constitutional plan that is approved by
all constituencies."
