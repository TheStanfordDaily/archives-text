# Prison Confab Begins
## Why A Conference? 
### 
Dennis Conrad

Tonight marks the beginning of the Third Annual
Conference on Prisons, sponsored by the Prison
Information Center and Syntex Corporation.
Featured speakers include Sheriff Richard
Hongisto, the controversial jail administrator from
San Francisco; Tom Murton, professor of criminal
justice at the University of Minnesota and former
superintendent of the Arkansas prison system
during the great scandal of the late sixties; Carlo
Prescott, an articulate and perceptive ex-prisoner
and KGO radio broadcaster; Phyllis Jo Baunach, a
consultant on prisons to the U.S. Labor Department
and an expert on women in prison. Other area
speakers round out what promises to be the most
comprehensive conference on prisons ever put
together in California.
Yet the question remains, "Why a conference on
prisons?" What good does it do to bring together
many of the top names in the field of prison reform
and have them mutually agree on how bad out
prison system is? The answers to these questions get
to the heart of why we feel the entire Conference is
worth the effort and money.
Awareness
First of all, public awareness is an essential
prelude to any meaningful change in our prison
system. As more people begin to care about the
bankruptcy of our present system, pressure will be
increasingly exerted upon the legislature to make
prison reform a high priority item.
Secondly, it is in everyone's self interest to care
about our prisons. Ninety-eight percent of all
prisoners will one day be released Unless we
improve the prisons and the social, economic, and

political factors which often lead men and women
there, we can continue to expect a 40-80 percent
recidivism rate.
And the crimes which return people to prison
can often affect us or people we know, not only as
real victims, but moral victims as well.
Fate
In the same vein, a Gallup Poll has shown that 90
percent of all Americans privately confess to having
committed an act for which they could have
received a jail sentence. Smoking marijuana,
consenting to homosexual relations, driving while
intoxicated, and even attempting suicide are all
crimes and are still being enforced. One quirk of
fate could potentially find anyone in prison, even a
Stanford student. It would seem that the thought of
going to jail should be impetus enough to change a
system which one day may come down upon us.
Finally, the men and women in our prisons are
prime examples of wasted human resources. Are
there any rational reasons why a person's
productivity should cease upon incarceration, or
why we should punish families of prisoners as well?
Prisons will undoubtedly be a fixture in at least
the near future, but if people begin to care about
them and their ultimate consequences, perhaps we
can at least redefine "paying one's debt to society"
as not including a promissory note on one's future.
If you do care, please attend the Conference on
Prisons, tonight, tomorrow, and Thursday, 7:30
p.m. at Cubberly Auditorium. Understanding is
the key to any meaningful change in our penal
system.
