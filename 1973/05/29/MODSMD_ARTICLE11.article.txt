The May 21 Daily reported
that Stanford Trustee Thomas V.
Jones had recently purchased at
least $50,000 worth of influence
in the U.S. government. While
Jones claims that he thought his
political contribution was going to
the above-ground 1972
Republican presidential campaign,
in fact it went instead to the
underground Watergate branch of
the Nixon apparatus.
It is unfortunate that the Daily
was unable to make a full
disclosure of Mr. Jones numerous
nefarious activities. An insight
into some of Mr. Jones' activities
may help us to understand why he
spent so heavily in the 1972
campaign.
Mr. Jones is the president and
chairman of Northrup
Corporation, one of the largest
Department of Defense
contractors and a major supplier
of weapons systems to the U.S.
armed forces during the Indochina
War.
Northrup and its subsidiaries
produce, among other things, the
F-5 fighter airplane, surveillance
drones, tactical communications
systems (including facilities in
Southeast Asia), electronic
guidance and countermeasure
equipment, assorted ordnance,
and additional materiel.
Mr. Jones' professional and
personal affiliations include the
Industry Advisory Council of the
Department of Defense, the Board
of Advisers of the Industrial
College of the Armed Forces, the
Board of Visitors of the Air Force
Systems Command, and the Los
Angeles World Affairs Council (a
local organization promoting
liberal-internationalist foreign
policy).
Mr. Jones sits on the board of
trustees of Stanford and of Cal
Tech, two of the most important
suppliers of trained engineers. He
is also a member of the board of
directors of Stanford Research
Institute, U.S. Steel, Wells Fargo
Bank, and the Times-Mirror
Company.
Although American uniformed
combat troops have just recently
been withdrawn from Vietnam,

Northrup is rapidly becoming a
major employer of civilian
mercenaries in Vietnam, providing
technical or combat support for
the Saigon regime.
Recent advertisements in the
San Francisco Chronicle, for
example, have recruited former
military personnel to return to
their old posts in South Vietnam:
"Page Communications Engineers,
Inc., a subsidiary of the Northrup
Corporation, has immediate
openings in Southeast Asia for
ground controlled approach radar
maintenance technicians. ... If
you had a minimum of 4 years Air
Force-related maintenance on
MPN-11, MPN-13, and MPN-14
please contact our local Page
representative for further
information."
Men like Mr. Jones have
interests that they wish to protect
and advance through large
political campaign contributions.
We should look closely at just
what activities such men are
engaged in and see to it that they
bear full responsibility for their
actions.

My congratulations to the Law
School Civil Rights Organization
and the ASSU Council of
Presidents for expressing my
indignation so completely in the
ad of May 23 in the Daily.
If it is the University's
intention to misinform those
concerned with what to expect
from unions it only muddied its
own image. Deceit under the guise
of enlightening the staff is not
what I expected the University to
stoop to.
If I were wavering, the
University's propaganda would
have completely checked my
indetermination. I am now truly
interested, along with many
"non-eligible voters," in seeing
USE win the election and
contribute to the betterment of
the staff on the Stanford Campus.

ad of May 23 in the Daily.
If it is the University's
intention to misinform those
concerned with what to expect
from unions it only muddied its
own image. Deceit under the guise
of enlightening the staff is not
what I expected the University to
stoop to.
If I were wavering, the
University's propaganda would
have completely checked my
indetermination. I am now truly
interested, along with many
"non-eligible voters," in seeing
USE win the election and
contribute to the betterment of
the staff on the Stanford Campus.

The May 21 Daily reported
that Stanford Trustee Thomas V.
Jones had recently purchased at
least $50,000 worth of influence
in the U.S. government. While
Jones claims that he thought his
political contribution was going to
the above-ground 1972
Republican presidential campaign,
in fact it went instead to the
underground Watergate branch of
the Nixon apparatus.
It is unfortunate that the Daily
was unable to make a full
disclosure of Mr. Jones numerous
nefarious activities. An insight
into some of Mr. Jones' activities
may help us to understand why he
spent so heavily in the 1972
campaign.
Mr. Jones is the president and
chairman of Northrup
Corporation, one of the largest
Department of Defense
contractors and a major supplier
of weapons systems to the U.S.
armed forces during the Indochina
War.
Northrup and its subsidiaries
produce, among other things, the
F-5 fighter airplane, surveillance
drones, tactical communications
systems (including facilities in
Southeast Asia), electronic
guidance and countermeasure
equipment, assorted ordnance,
and additional materiel.
Mr. Jones' professional and
personal affiliations include the
Industry Advisory Council of the
Department of Defense, the Board
of Advisers of the Industrial
College of the Armed Forces, the
Board of Visitors of the Air Force
Systems Command, and the Los
Angeles World Affairs Council (a
local organization promoting
liberal-internationalist foreign
policy).
Mr. Jones sits on the board of
trustees of Stanford and of Cal
Tech, two of the most important
suppliers of trained engineers. He
is also a member of the board of
directors of Stanford Research
Institute, U.S. Steel, Wells Fargo
Bank, and the Times-Mirror
Company.
Although American uniformed
combat troops have just recently
been withdrawn from Vietnam,

Northrup is rapidly becoming a
major employer of civilian
mercenaries in Vietnam, providing
technical or combat support for
the Saigon regime.
Recent advertisements in the
San Francisco Chronicle, for
example, have recruited former
military personnel to return to
their old posts in South Vietnam:
"Page Communications Engineers,
Inc., a subsidiary of the Northrup
Corporation, has immediate
openings in Southeast Asia for
ground controlled approach radar
maintenance technicians. ... If
you had a minimum of 4 years Air
Force-related maintenance on
MPN-11, MPN-13, and MPN-14
please contact our local Page
representative for further
information."
Men like Mr. Jones have
interests that they wish to protect
and advance through large
political campaign contributions.
We should look closely at just
what activities such men are
engaged in and see to it that they
bear full responsibility for their
actions.
