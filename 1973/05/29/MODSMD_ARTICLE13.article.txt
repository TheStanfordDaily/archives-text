# $415,000 For Education Probe
## Research Center Receives Gift 
### 
Stanford's Center for Research
and Development in Teaching in
the School of Education (SCRDT)
has received a $415,000 grant for
the improvement of education in
the most deprived and
poverty-stricken areas of the
nation.
The project, to be directed by
Prof. Robert N. Bush, director of
SCRDT, will affect 60 schools in
24 communities in 20 states and
Puerto Rico. An executive
director will be announced in a
few weeks.
The Urban/Rural School
Development Project will seek to
increase the educational
capabilities of youngsters in black,
Indian, chicano, and Puerto Rican
majority schools, in inner cities
and poverty pockets in rural
America and Appalachia, Prof.
Bush said.
Under Stanford's supervision,
school personnel with expertise in
schools of this nature will meet
with counterparts from other
similarly afflicted districts in
regional conferences and

workshops for the exchange of
ideas and techniques, he
explained.
A U.S. Office of Education
directive issued when the program
was established in 1970 said the
project "will join all the people
concerned with education in
deprived areas — administrators,
teachers. paraprofessionals,
students, parents and the
community — in writing a new
script for educational
performance within the school."
Creation, Responsibility
The directive said programs
will be the creation and
responsibility of the local school
staff and the local community,
with no dictation from
Washington.
"We expect the result to be a
school with a new environment
which is stimulating and satisfying
to the child and teacher alike, and
in which the academic
achievement and human
development of children will be
significantly increased," Bush
said.

The new program is Phase II of
a project which was launched at
SCRDT two years ago under the
direction of Robert D. Hess,
holder of the Lee L. Jacks
professorship 'in the School of
Education.
Data Collection
Phase I included data
collection and assistance to the
USOE in forming community
councils through which Phase II
will be administered.
"The principles of teacher
accountability and
community-school participation
will continue to guide the
project," Bush said.
Among cities in which heavily
racial schools will be aided are
Akron, East Chicago, Dayton,
Clay County, Tenn., Galena,
Kansas, San Antonio, Texas, San
Juan, P.R., and San Luis, Col.,
which is 100 percent chicano.
School Locations
Also included are schools in
mountainous West Virginia,
Hays-Lodgepole, Mont., Neah
Bay, Wash., and the Bronx, N.Y.

No California schools are
included.
National and regional
conferences and workshops will
be held, using materials developed
by SCRDT, national programs of
Competency-based Teacher
Education, the Right to Read and
Exceptional Children programs,
and all others aimed at improved
education in severely
economically distressed areas.
In addition to a special group
of staff assistants to Bush, a group
of half-time program assistants
will be used, and advanced
graduate students will work with
three local school sites.
4 To Improve Education'
Bush said: "We are pleased that
Stanford has been asked to
continue its efforts to improve
education in the poverty
communities.
"We have unique resources to
bring to bear on these problems.
These educational difficulties are
not easy to remedy, and we
should not expect miraculous
solutions tomorrow.
"But it is not all hopeless, by
any means, contrary to current
critics, such as [Christopher]
Jencks, who alleges that schooling
makes no difference in student
achievement.
"Schools do make a difference
and schools are working for many
children at many places. Our task
is to apply the knowledge and
expertise now available to the
difficult problem areas in a
practical manner. That is the goal
of this new effort."

24 communities in 20 states and
Puerto Rico. An executive
director will be announced in a
few weeks.
The Urban/Rural School
Development Project will seek to
increase the educational
capabilities of youngsters in black,
Indian, chicano, and Puerto Rican
majority schools, in inner cities
and poverty pockets in rural
America and Appalachia, Prof.
Bush said.
Under Stanford's supervision,
school personnel with expertise in
schools of this nature will meet
with counterparts from other
similarly afflicted districts in
regional conferences and

workshops for the exchange of
ideas and techniques, he
explained.
A U.S. Office of Education
directive issued when the program
was established in 1970 said the
project "will join all the people
concerned with education in
deprived areas — administrators,
teachers. paraprofessionals,
students, parents and the
community — in writing a new
script for educational
performance within the school."
Creation, Responsibility
The directive said programs
will be the creation and
responsibility of the local school
staff and the local community,
with no dictation from
Washington.
"We expect the result to be a
school with a new environment
which is stimulating and satisfying
to the child and teacher alike, and
in which the academic
achievement and human
development of children will be
significantly increased," Bush
said.

The new program is Phase II of
a project which was launched at
SCRDT two years ago under the
direction of Robert D. Hess,
holder of the Lee L. Jacks
professorship 'in the School of
Education.
Data Collection
Phase I included data
collection and assistance to the
USOE in forming community
councils through which Phase II
will be administered.
"The principles of teacher
accountability and
community-school participation
will continue to guide the
project," Bush said.
Among cities in which heavily
racial schools will be aided are
Akron, East Chicago, Dayton,
Clay County, Tenn., Galena,
Kansas, San Antonio, Texas, San
Juan, P.R., and San Luis, Col.,
which is 100 percent chicano.
School Locations
Also included are schools in
mountainous West Virginia,
Hays-Lodgepole, Mont., Neah
Bay, Wash., and the Bronx, N.Y.

No California schools are
included.
National and regional
conferences and workshops will
be held, using materials developed
by SCRDT, national programs of
Competency-based Teacher
Education, the Right to Read and
Exceptional Children programs,
and all others aimed at improved
education in severely
economically distressed areas.
In addition to a special group
of staff assistants to Bush, a group
of half-time program assistants
will be used, and advanced
graduate students will work with
three local school sites.
4 To Improve Education'
Bush said: "We are pleased that
Stanford has been asked to
continue its efforts to improve
education in the poverty
communities.
"We have unique resources to
bring to bear on these problems.
These educational difficulties are
not easy to remedy, and we
should not expect miraculous
solutions tomorrow.
"But it is not all hopeless, by
any means, contrary to current
critics, such as [Christopher]
Jencks, who alleges that schooling
makes no difference in student
achievement.
"Schools do make a difference
and schools are working for many
children at many places. Our task
is to apply the knowledge and
expertise now available to the
difficult problem areas in a
practical manner. That is the goal
of this new effort."
Stanford's Center for Research
and Development in Teaching in
the School of Education (SCRDT)
has received a $415,000 grant for
the improvement of education in
the most deprived and
poverty-stricken areas of the
nation.
The project, to be directed by
Prof. Robert N. Bush, director of
SCRDT, will affect 60 schools in
24 communities in 20 states and
Puerto Rico. An executive
