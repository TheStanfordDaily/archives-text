# Grateful Dead 'Good Times'
## 
### PATRICK A. TROUT 
Kezar Stadium was
"rechristened" Saturday in a
marathon eight-hour concert that
included some of the best boogie
music this side of the big ditch.
Between 20 and 30,000 Dead
freaks and hangers-on were on
hand, dancing, whooping,
sunbathing, and smoking up a
storm as the good old Grateful
Dead and two supporting acts that
could have stood on their own
converted the former football
field into San Francisco's largest
outdoor concert hall.
Despite questionable acoustics
— helped not at all by a persistent,
chilly, dust-whipping wind — it
was another fine performance by
the Dead, who seem to do their

best before audiences that would
forgive most mistakes anyway.
The concert was the first
large-scale outdoor rock concert
in San Francisco in several years.
It was the outcome of months of
negotiations between impresario
(and antihero) Bill Graham and
the city's Parks and Recreations
Commission; Graham finally won
the right to let audiences use the
Kezar field as well as the stands —
although only after rescheduling
the inaugural concert for the Cow
Palace and announcing that he
would cover that arena's vast floor
with artificial grass if necessary.
Sentimental Considerations
Graham will use the stadium,
late home of the '49ers. for
frequent shows — some of which,
like Led Zeppelin's appearance
this weekend, will draw crowds
larger than Saturday's. But
Graham put the Dead on first for
sentimental reasons: "They are
the perfect champagne for this

christening," he said. The
atmosphere was indeed
reminiscent of the early days of
San Francisco rock, when the
Dead, Quicksilver, and other
groups played free on nearby
greens.
While the New Riders of the
Purple Sage, long associated with
the Dead, and slightly freakish
country-western star Waylon
Jennings were welcomed with
enthusiasm, it was clear that the
crowd was saving most of its
energy for the headliners. That
could have been a matter of the
time of day, however: the New
Riders kicked off at 11 a.m., and
while they did a fine set, it was a
mite early to get into serious
insanity.

The Riders' p.a. system had
difficulty cutting through the
winds, too — a serious
disadvantage at Kezar, whose
typhoons sometimes rival those of
Candlestick Park.
Wavlon Jennings was a fine
surprise to those who were not
familiar with his very tight electric
cowboy music. Jennings'
performance was down-home and
good-humored; the pedal-steel
work of Ralph Mooney was real
joy. It's not difficult to see the
real affinities between the Dead's
acid-country-rock and Jennings'
more orthodox stuff.
Good Times
But the principal attraction
was the Dead, and they managed
to satisfy nearly everybody with
five big hours of good times. Their
ballyhooed new sound system
(more than 150 speakers of
between six inches and three feet
(—remember, the one they tried
out in Maples Pavilion two

months ago?) lived up to all
expectations and did a beautiful
job despite adverse conditions.
Starting out a little sloppily on
"High Over Albuquerque" (and a
version of "Box of Rain" this
reviewer feels they'd be better off
retiring), the quintessential
counterculture band got better
and tighter, as usual, as they
went along. By the end of their
first set (of three!) they were
playing very well indeed.
Even so, it was a while before
they got into any real
improvisation, the Deads'
hallmark and the talent that puts
them squarely in the category of
music to take seriously.
The rendition of "Playing in
the Band," their usual entree to
the trippy, acidic stuff, was
spirited but nothing
extraordinary. Not until a soulful
version of "He's Gone" — with
Jerry Garcia, incidentally, in rare
voice — did things begin to fly.
Enthusiasm Increases
The band, it was cleir, was

becoming more and more
enthusiastic. On one fifty-minute
song (a momentary lapse of this
reviewer's short-term memory
obscures the title) they put
together their best talents and
enthralled one and all with sheer
dynamic brilliance. In other
words, I found myself
dangerously close to Nirvana. It
was some of the best live Dead
heard in these parts in some time.
Seeing Jerry Garcia enjoy
himself is one of the rare joys of
rock music. By the end of the
Dead's five (count 'em)hours of
hard work, Garcia and the
20,000-odd in the stadium were
all having an exceptionally good
time.
The audience was on its feet
long before the finale of "Sugar
Magnolia," but that rouser and an
encore of "Casey Jones" sent
them happily on their way, a little
boogie in their feet and the usual
slightly glazed look in their eyes.
It was a fine way to spend a
Saturday afternoon.

PERFECT CHAMPAGNE — Last Saturday, the Grateful Dead performed with New Riders of the Purple
Sage and Waylon Jennings in the first of many Bill Graham-sponsored Kezar Stadium rock concerts to
come. Of The Grateful Dead, Graham said, "They are the perfect champagne for this christening."
Kezar Stadium was
"rechristened" Saturday in a
marathon eight-hour concert that
included some of the best boogie
music this side of the big ditch.
Between 20 and 30,000 Dead
freaks and hangers-on were on
hand, dancing, whooping,
sunbathing, and smoking up a
storm as the good old Grateful
Dead and two supporting acts that
could have stood on their own
converted the former football
field into San Francisco's largest
outdoor concert hall.
Despite questionable acoustics
— helped not at all by a persistent,
chilly, dust-whipping wind — it
was another fine performance by
the Dead, who seem to do their

best before audiences that would
forgive most mistakes anyway.
The concert was the first
large-scale outdoor rock concert
in San Francisco in several years.
It was the outcome of months of
negotiations between impresario
(and antihero) Bill Graham and
the city's Parks and Recreations
Commission; Graham finally won
the right to let audiences use the
Kezar field as well as the stands —
although only after rescheduling
the inaugural concert for the Cow
Palace and announcing that he
would cover that arena's vast floor
with artificial grass if necessary.
Sentimental Considerations
Graham will use the stadium,
late home of the '49ers. for
frequent shows — some of which,
like Led Zeppelin's appearance
this weekend, will draw crowds
larger than Saturday's. But
Graham put the Dead on first for
sentimental reasons: "They are
the perfect champagne for this

christening," he said. The
atmosphere was indeed
reminiscent of the early days of
San Francisco rock, when the
Dead, Quicksilver, and other
groups played free on nearby
greens.
While the New Riders of the
Purple Sage, long associated with
the Dead, and slightly freakish
country-western star Waylon
Jennings were welcomed with
enthusiasm, it was clear that the
crowd was saving most of its
energy for the headliners. That
could have been a matter of the
time of day, however: the New
Riders kicked off at 11 a.m., and
while they did a fine set, it was a
mite early to get into serious
insanity.

The Riders' p.a. system had
difficulty cutting through the
winds, too — a serious
disadvantage at Kezar, whose
typhoons sometimes rival those of
Candlestick Park.
Wavlon Jennings was a fine
surprise to those who were not
familiar with his very tight electric
cowboy music. Jennings'
performance was down-home and
good-humored; the pedal-steel
work of Ralph Mooney was real
joy. It's not difficult to see the
real affinities between the Dead's
acid-country-rock and Jennings'
more orthodox stuff.
Good Times
But the principal attraction
was the Dead, and they managed
to satisfy nearly everybody with
five big hours of good times. Their
ballyhooed new sound system
(more than 150 speakers of
between six inches and three feet
(—remember, the one they tried
out in Maples Pavilion two

months ago?) lived up to all
expectations and did a beautiful
job despite adverse conditions.
Starting out a little sloppily on
"High Over Albuquerque" (and a
version of "Box of Rain" this
reviewer feels they'd be better off
retiring), the quintessential
counterculture band got better
and tighter, as usual, as they
went along. By the end of their
first set (of three!) they were
playing very well indeed.
Even so, it was a while before
they got into any real
improvisation, the Deads'
hallmark and the talent that puts
them squarely in the category of
music to take seriously.
The rendition of "Playing in
the Band," their usual entree to
the trippy, acidic stuff, was
spirited but nothing
extraordinary. Not until a soulful
version of "He's Gone" — with
Jerry Garcia, incidentally, in rare
voice — did things begin to fly.
Enthusiasm Increases
The band, it was cleir, was

becoming more and more
enthusiastic. On one fifty-minute
song (a momentary lapse of this
reviewer's short-term memory
obscures the title) they put
together their best talents and
enthralled one and all with sheer
dynamic brilliance. In other
words, I found myself
dangerously close to Nirvana. It
was some of the best live Dead
heard in these parts in some time.
Seeing Jerry Garcia enjoy
himself is one of the rare joys of
rock music. By the end of the
Dead's five (count 'em)hours of
hard work, Garcia and the
20,000-odd in the stadium were
all having an exceptionally good
time.
The audience was on its feet
long before the finale of "Sugar
Magnolia," but that rouser and an
encore of "Casey Jones" sent
them happily on their way, a little
boogie in their feet and the usual
slightly glazed look in their eyes.
It was a fine way to spend a
Saturday afternoon.

20,000-odd in the stadium were
all having an exceptionally good
time.
The audience was on its feet
long before the finale of "Sugar
Magnolia," but that rouser and an
encore of "Casey Jones" sent
them happily on their way, a little
boogie in their feet and the usual
slightly glazed look in their eyes.
It was a fine way to spend a
Saturday afternoon.

PERFECT CHAMPAGNE — Last Saturday, the Grateful Dead performed with New Riders of the Purple
Sage and Waylon Jennings in the first of many Bill Graham-sponsored Kezar Stadium rock concerts to
come. Of The Grateful Dead, Graham said, "They are the perfect champagne for this christening."
Kezar Stadium was
"rechristened" Saturday in a
marathon eight-hour concert that
included some of the best boogie
music this side of the big ditch.
Between 20 and 30,000 Dead
freaks and hangers-on were on
hand, dancing, whooping,
sunbathing, and smoking up a
storm as the good old Grateful
Dead and two supporting acts that
could have stood on their own
converted the former football
field into San Francisco's largest
outdoor concert hall.
Despite questionable acoustics
— helped not at all by a persistent,
chilly, dust-whipping wind — it
was another fine performance by
the Dead, who seem to do their

best before audiences that would
forgive most mistakes anyway.
The concert was the first
large-scale outdoor rock concert
in San Francisco in several years.
It was the outcome of months of
negotiations between impresario
(and antihero) Bill Graham and
the city's Parks and Recreations
Commission; Graham finally won
the right to let audiences use the
Kezar field as well as the stands —
although only after rescheduling
the inaugural concert for the Cow
Palace and announcing that he
would cover that arena's vast floor
with artificial grass if necessary.
Sentimental Considerations
Graham will use the stadium,
late home of the '49ers. for
frequent shows — some of which,
like Led Zeppelin's appearance
this weekend, will draw crowds
larger than Saturday's. But
Graham put the Dead on first for
sentimental reasons: "They are
the perfect champagne for this

christening," he said. The
atmosphere was indeed
reminiscent of the early days of
San Francisco rock, when the
Dead, Quicksilver, and other
groups played free on nearby
greens.
While the New Riders of the
Purple Sage, long associated with
the Dead, and slightly freakish
country-western star Waylon
Jennings were welcomed with
enthusiasm, it was clear that the
crowd was saving most of its
energy for the headliners. That
could have been a matter of the
time of day, however: the New
Riders kicked off at 11 a.m., and
while they did a fine set, it was a
mite early to get into serious
insanity.

The Riders' p.a. system had
difficulty cutting through the
winds, too — a serious
disadvantage at Kezar, whose
typhoons sometimes rival those of
Candlestick Park.
Wavlon Jennings was a fine
surprise to those who were not
familiar with his very tight electric
cowboy music. Jennings'
performance was down-home and
good-humored; the pedal-steel
work of Ralph Mooney was real
joy. It's not difficult to see the
real affinities between the Dead's
acid-country-rock and Jennings'
more orthodox stuff.
Good Times
But the principal attraction
was the Dead, and they managed
to satisfy nearly everybody with
five big hours of good times. Their
ballyhooed new sound system
(more than 150 speakers of
between six inches and three feet
(—remember, the one they tried
out in Maples Pavilion two

months ago?) lived up to all
expectations and did a beautiful
job despite adverse conditions.
Starting out a little sloppily on
"High Over Albuquerque" (and a
version of "Box of Rain" this
reviewer feels they'd be better off
retiring), the quintessential
counterculture band got better
and tighter, as usual, as they
went along. By the end of their
first set (of three!) they were
playing very well indeed.
Even so, it was a while before
they got into any real
improvisation, the Deads'
hallmark and the talent that puts
them squarely in the category of
music to take seriously.
The rendition of "Playing in
the Band," their usual entree to
the trippy, acidic stuff, was
spirited but nothing
extraordinary. Not until a soulful
version of "He's Gone" — with
Jerry Garcia, incidentally, in rare
voice — did things begin to fly.
Enthusiasm Increases
The band, it was cleir, was

becoming more and more
enthusiastic. On one fifty-minute
song (a momentary lapse of this
reviewer's short-term memory
obscures the title) they put
together their best talents and
enthralled one and all with sheer
dynamic brilliance. In other
words, I found myself
dangerously close to Nirvana. It
was some of the best live Dead
heard in these parts in some time.
Seeing Jerry Garcia enjoy
himself is one of the rare joys of
rock music. By the end of the
Dead's five (count 'em)hours of
hard work, Garcia and the
20,000-odd in the stadium were
all having an exceptionally good
time.
