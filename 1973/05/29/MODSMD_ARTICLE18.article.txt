Skylab "Fully Activated'
HOUSTON — Skylab, the nation's first space station and
the largest spacecraft in the world, was pronounced fully
activated yesterday and ready for its business of scientific
study of the earth, the sun and man.
Skylab 1 astronauts Charles Conrad Jr., Dr. Joseph P.
Kerwin and Paul J. Weitz completed the long task of
unpacking and storing equipment and turning on and
checking out the complex scientific instruments.
Kerwin drew blood from himself and his crewmates
yesterday morning for the first of a weekly series of tests.
The blood tests start an intensive program of medical
experiments, which will include use of instruments to
check the heart, lungs and ability to work. Using the tests,
doctors on the ground will closely monitor how well the
men are adapting to living for weeks in weightlessness.
Weitz pumped away on an exercise bicycle but a
continuing heat problem may have clouded the results.
However, Kerwin said the three-man crew was
successful in conducting a test of blood vessel
conditioning and in beginning work with a complex
metabolic analyzer.
Setting up and activating the medical equipment went
smoothly except for one instrument. A mass measurement
device for weighing the crew's fecal wastes during their
28-day stay had been left on overnight and burned out.
There is another on board, however.
Experiments with a solar telescope are scheduled for
today. It will be the first time for a manned telescope to
get a view of the sun undimmed by atmosphere. Officials
said scientists were anxious for the telescope to gather
data on a region of the sun where solar flares have been
occurring recently.
Security Funds Improve Nixon Estate
SAN CLEMENTE — The federal government has spent
more than $100,000 for improvements at President
Nixon's San Clemente estate since he bought it four years
ago, records show.
Most of the work was done in the name of presidential
security. Much of it, however, has enhanced the value of
the oceanside property owned by Nixon and one of his
wealthy friends, New York industrialist Robert
Abplanalp.
The federal investment of more than $100,000 was
disclosed in city building permit records and in
subsequent interviews with government officials. The
figure is nearly three times the $39,525 which the White
House said during the weekend the government had spent
for improvements at the estate.
A spokesman for the Secret Service in Washington said
of the listings: "We recommended all of those items for
the compound."
The White House would not provide a breakdown on
the $123,514 figure it gave on Friday in a statement
disclosing that Nixon had sold all but 5.9 acres of the
29-acre tract to Alplanalp in December, 1970.
But among the security improvements were:
—A $3,360 storage shed with stucco walls to blend into
the architecture of the President's estate.
—A $2,000 cabana on the beach beneath Nixon's house
near a redwood crossover on the railroad tracks separating
the beach from the estate. The crossover is complete with
small red warning lights to signal if a train is approaching.
—Three gazebos and a gatehouse costing an estimated

$22,000 and used by security personnel who guard the
presidential property.
Tornadoes Hit Midwest, South
MOBILE — The Memorial Day weekend turned into a
holiday of horror for thousands of people in the South
and Midwest when a vicious storm system left at least 40
dead in 10 states and caused heavy damage in areas
already suffering from spring floods.
Tornadoes, heavy rains and flash floods caused seven
deaths in Alabama, three in Arkansas, one in Florida, two
in Georgia, three in Kansas, one in Mississippi, seven in
Missouri, seven in North Carolina, five in Oklahoma, ten
in Tennessee and one in Virginia.
The storms started Saturday night in Kansas and
Missouri, then criss-crossed their way South during the
day and night Sunday.
Ford Meets Guerrilla Demands
BUENOS AIRES — The Ford Motor Co. began meeting
leftist guerrillas' extortion demands yesterday with
$400,000 in cash donated to children's hospitals and
3,000 food packages delivered to a shanty town.
Some Peronist youths were reported opposed to
accepting the food because it came as a result of terrorist
activities.
The Rev. Carlos Mujica, a leader of a liberal religious
movement, told them: "Now is not the time to quarrel
about ideologies. Let's get this food to the people. At
least the children will have tasted milk and cocoa once in
their lives."
The food, part of a million dollar demand by
pay-or-die guerrillas, was stored in a church and was to be
distributed this morning. About 100 persons, many
wrapped in tattered ponchos against a chill autumn wind,
watched the food being stacked in the church.
The Trotstkyite People's Revolutionary
Army-ERP-told Argentina's Ford subsidiary last Tuesday
that if $1 million were not paid, executives of the firm
would be kidnaped or killed.
Cambodian Insurgents Attack Convey
PHNOM PENH — Two cargo ships and two tankers were
heavily damaged and a Filipino sailor was killed yesterday
as a supply convoy steamed up the Mekong River to
Phnom Penh under fire.
The entire convoy of six tankers, two cargo ships and
three ammunition barges limped into Phnom Penh at
dusk. One cargo ship was unable to anchor because its
anchor had been hit.
U.S. F4 fighter-bombers repeatedly pounded insurgent
positions along the 60-mile route from South Vietnam.
Cambodian soldiers in escort boats said several of their
colleagues were killed and wounded by fire from the
banks of the river.
It was the eighth supply convoy to run the hazardous
river passage in two months. Crewmen described
yesterday's voyage as the worst yet.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow but with patchy low clouds near
the coast tomorrow morning. Cooler coastal areas
tomorrow. Low tonight in the 50s. Highs in 80s to mid
90s inland and 70s near the coast today and 60s
tomorrow. Northwest wind 5 to 15 mph increasing
tomorrow afternoon.

A spokesman for the Secret Service in Washington said
of the listings: "We recommended all of those items for
the compound."
The White House would not provide a breakdown on
the $123,514 figure it gave on Friday in a statement
disclosing that Nixon had sold all but 5.9 acres of the
29-acre tract to Alplanalp in December, 1970.
But among the security improvements were:
—A $3,360 storage shed with stucco walls to blend into
the architecture of the President's estate.
—A $2,000 cabana on the beach beneath Nixon's house
near a redwood crossover on the railroad tracks separating
the beach from the estate. The crossover is complete with
small red warning lights to signal if a train is approaching.
—Three gazebos and a gatehouse costing an estimated

$22,000 and used by security personnel who guard the
presidential property.
Tornadoes Hit Midwest, South
MOBILE — The Memorial Day weekend turned into a
holiday of horror for thousands of people in the South
and Midwest when a vicious storm system left at least 40
dead in 10 states and caused heavy damage in areas
already suffering from spring floods.
Tornadoes, heavy rains and flash floods caused seven
deaths in Alabama, three in Arkansas, one in Florida, two
in Georgia, three in Kansas, one in Mississippi, seven in
Missouri, seven in North Carolina, five in Oklahoma, ten
in Tennessee and one in Virginia.
The storms started Saturday night in Kansas and
Missouri, then criss-crossed their way South during the
day and night Sunday.
Ford Meets Guerrilla Demands
BUENOS AIRES — The Ford Motor Co. began meeting
leftist guerrillas' extortion demands yesterday with
$400,000 in cash donated to children's hospitals and
3,000 food packages delivered to a shanty town.
Some Peronist youths were reported opposed to
accepting the food because it came as a result of terrorist
activities.
The Rev. Carlos Mujica, a leader of a liberal religious
movement, told them: "Now is not the time to quarrel
about ideologies. Let's get this food to the people. At
least the children will have tasted milk and cocoa once in
their lives."
The food, part of a million dollar demand by
pay-or-die guerrillas, was stored in a church and was to be
distributed this morning. About 100 persons, many
wrapped in tattered ponchos against a chill autumn wind,
watched the food being stacked in the church.
The Trotstkyite People's Revolutionary
Army-ERP-told Argentina's Ford subsidiary last Tuesday
that if $1 million were not paid, executives of the firm
would be kidnaped or killed.
Cambodian Insurgents Attack Convey
PHNOM PENH — Two cargo ships and two tankers were
heavily damaged and a Filipino sailor was killed yesterday
as a supply convoy steamed up the Mekong River to
Phnom Penh under fire.
The entire convoy of six tankers, two cargo ships and
three ammunition barges limped into Phnom Penh at
dusk. One cargo ship was unable to anchor because its
anchor had been hit.
U.S. F4 fighter-bombers repeatedly pounded insurgent
positions along the 60-mile route from South Vietnam.
Cambodian soldiers in escort boats said several of their
colleagues were killed and wounded by fire from the
banks of the river.
It was the eighth supply convoy to run the hazardous
river passage in two months. Crewmen described
yesterday's voyage as the worst yet.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow but with patchy low clouds near
the coast tomorrow morning. Cooler coastal areas
tomorrow. Low tonight in the 50s. Highs in 80s to mid
90s inland and 70s near the coast today and 60s
tomorrow. Northwest wind 5 to 15 mph increasing
tomorrow afternoon.
Skylab "Fully Activated'
HOUSTON — Skylab, the nation's first space station and
the largest spacecraft in the world, was pronounced fully
activated yesterday and ready for its business of scientific
study of the earth, the sun and man.
Skylab 1 astronauts Charles Conrad Jr., Dr. Joseph P.
Kerwin and Paul J. Weitz completed the long task of
unpacking and storing equipment and turning on and
checking out the complex scientific instruments.
Kerwin drew blood from himself and his crewmates
yesterday morning for the first of a weekly series of tests.
The blood tests start an intensive program of medical
experiments, which will include use of instruments to
check the heart, lungs and ability to work. Using the tests,
doctors on the ground will closely monitor how well the
men are adapting to living for weeks in weightlessness.
Weitz pumped away on an exercise bicycle but a
continuing heat problem may have clouded the results.
However, Kerwin said the three-man crew was
successful in conducting a test of blood vessel
conditioning and in beginning work with a complex
metabolic analyzer.
Setting up and activating the medical equipment went
smoothly except for one instrument. A mass measurement
device for weighing the crew's fecal wastes during their
28-day stay had been left on overnight and burned out.
There is another on board, however.
Experiments with a solar telescope are scheduled for
today. It will be the first time for a manned telescope to
get a view of the sun undimmed by atmosphere. Officials
said scientists were anxious for the telescope to gather
data on a region of the sun where solar flares have been
occurring recently.
Security Funds Improve Nixon Estate
SAN CLEMENTE — The federal government has spent
more than $100,000 for improvements at President
Nixon's San Clemente estate since he bought it four years
ago, records show.
Most of the work was done in the name of presidential
security. Much of it, however, has enhanced the value of
the oceanside property owned by Nixon and one of his
wealthy friends, New York industrialist Robert
Abplanalp.
The federal investment of more than $100,000 was
disclosed in city building permit records and in
subsequent interviews with government officials. The
figure is nearly three times the $39,525 which the White
House said during the weekend the government had spent
for improvements at the estate.
A spokesman for the Secret Service in Washington said
of the listings: "We recommended all of those items for

pay-or-die guerrillas, was stored in a church and was to be
distributed this morning. About 100 persons, many
wrapped in tattered ponchos against a chill autumn wind,
watched the food being stacked in the church.
The Trotstkyite People's Revolutionary
Army-ERP-told Argentina's Ford subsidiary last Tuesday
that if $1 million were not paid, executives of the firm
would be kidnaped or killed.
Cambodian Insurgents Attack Convey
PHNOM PENH — Two cargo ships and two tankers were
heavily damaged and a Filipino sailor was killed yesterday
as a supply convoy steamed up the Mekong River to
Phnom Penh under fire.
The entire convoy of six tankers, two cargo ships and
three ammunition barges limped into Phnom Penh at
dusk. One cargo ship was unable to anchor because its
anchor had been hit.
U.S. F4 fighter-bombers repeatedly pounded insurgent
positions along the 60-mile route from South Vietnam.
Cambodian soldiers in escort boats said several of their
colleagues were killed and wounded by fire from the
banks of the river.
It was the eighth supply convoy to run the hazardous
river passage in two months. Crewmen described
yesterday's voyage as the worst yet.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow but with patchy low clouds near
the coast tomorrow morning. Cooler coastal areas
tomorrow. Low tonight in the 50s. Highs in 80s to mid
90s inland and 70s near the coast today and 60s
tomorrow. Northwest wind 5 to 15 mph increasing
tomorrow afternoon.
Skylab "Fully Activated'
HOUSTON — Skylab, the nation's first space station and
the largest spacecraft in the world, was pronounced fully
activated yesterday and ready for its business of scientific
study of the earth, the sun and man.
Skylab 1 astronauts Charles Conrad Jr., Dr. Joseph P.
Kerwin and Paul J. Weitz completed the long task of
unpacking and storing equipment and turning on and
checking out the complex scientific instruments.
Kerwin drew blood from himself and his crewmates
yesterday morning for the first of a weekly series of tests.
The blood tests start an intensive program of medical
experiments, which will include use of instruments to
check the heart, lungs and ability to work. Using the tests,
doctors on the ground will closely monitor how well the
men are adapting to living for weeks in weightlessness.
Weitz pumped away on an exercise bicycle but a
continuing heat problem may have clouded the results.
However, Kerwin said the three-man crew was
successful in conducting a test of blood vessel
conditioning and in beginning work with a complex
metabolic analyzer.
Setting up and activating the medical equipment went
smoothly except for one instrument. A mass measurement
device for weighing the crew's fecal wastes during their
28-day stay had been left on overnight and burned out.
There is another on board, however.
Experiments with a solar telescope are scheduled for
today. It will be the first time for a manned telescope to
get a view of the sun undimmed by atmosphere. Officials
said scientists were anxious for the telescope to gather
data on a region of the sun where solar flares have been
occurring recently.
Security Funds Improve Nixon Estate
SAN CLEMENTE — The federal government has spent
more than $100,000 for improvements at President
Nixon's San Clemente estate since he bought it four years
ago, records show.
Most of the work was done in the name of presidential
security. Much of it, however, has enhanced the value of
the oceanside property owned by Nixon and one of his
wealthy friends, New York industrialist Robert
Abplanalp.
The federal investment of more than $100,000 was
disclosed in city building permit records and in
subsequent interviews with government officials. The
figure is nearly three times the $39,525 which the White
House said during the weekend the government had spent
for improvements at the estate.
A spokesman for the Secret Service in Washington said
of the listings: "We recommended all of those items for
the compound."
The White House would not provide a breakdown on
the $123,514 figure it gave on Friday in a statement
disclosing that Nixon had sold all but 5.9 acres of the
29-acre tract to Alplanalp in December, 1970.
But among the security improvements were:
—A $3,360 storage shed with stucco walls to blend into
the architecture of the President's estate.
—A $2,000 cabana on the beach beneath Nixon's house
near a redwood crossover on the railroad tracks separating
the beach from the estate. The crossover is complete with
small red warning lights to signal if a train is approaching.
—Three gazebos and a gatehouse costing an estimated

$22,000 and used by security personnel who guard the
presidential property.
Tornadoes Hit Midwest, South
MOBILE — The Memorial Day weekend turned into a
holiday of horror for thousands of people in the South
and Midwest when a vicious storm system left at least 40
dead in 10 states and caused heavy damage in areas
already suffering from spring floods.
Tornadoes, heavy rains and flash floods caused seven
deaths in Alabama, three in Arkansas, one in Florida, two
in Georgia, three in Kansas, one in Mississippi, seven in
Missouri, seven in North Carolina, five in Oklahoma, ten
in Tennessee and one in Virginia.
The storms started Saturday night in Kansas and
Missouri, then criss-crossed their way South during the
day and night Sunday.
Ford Meets Guerrilla Demands
BUENOS AIRES — The Ford Motor Co. began meeting
leftist guerrillas' extortion demands yesterday with
$400,000 in cash donated to children's hospitals and
3,000 food packages delivered to a shanty town.
Some Peronist youths were reported opposed to
accepting the food because it came as a result of terrorist
activities.
The Rev. Carlos Mujica, a leader of a liberal religious
movement, told them: "Now is not the time to quarrel
about ideologies. Let's get this food to the people. At
least the children will have tasted milk and cocoa once in
their lives."
The food, part of a million dollar demand by
pay-or-die guerrillas, was stored in a church and was to be
distributed this morning. About 100 persons, many
wrapped in tattered ponchos against a chill autumn wind,
