# Economics Faculty Discusses Dollar Crisis
## 
### BILL WEINSTEIN 
In the past three years, the
economy has been rr. c ked by a dollar
devaluation of over 20 percent,
inflation, high unemployment and
interest rates, and the price of gold,
which has soared from $35 an ounce
to $120 an ounce.
Amidst predictions of economic
recovery and an international
monetary collapse, four economics
professors expressed their views on the
dollar crisis.
"The dollar as an international
currency is both falling in value and is
a focal point of instability,"
commented Prof. Edward Shaw.
Because of this dollar instability
"the world is in darn serious danger of
a setback in international trading," he
warned. "There is a basic danger in the
decline of the world's production, a
break up of the world economy."
Futile Policies
Shaw claimed that present
economic policies for the issuance of
money were "futile and destabilizing.
We have another recession coming
next year. This means a rise in the
unemployment rate of the persons
who can stand it least."
In contrast, Department Chairman
Moses Abramovitz said "the economy
is better off than it was two or three
years ago. Per capita income is higher,
unemployment lower. In a short term
sense, the economy is better off."
Prof. John Gurley agreed that the
present economic policies have been
"terrifically effective. Corporative
profits are soaring. They're just
fabulous."
However, "In a longer term sense,"
cautioned Abramovitz, "the economy
faces the serious problem of
inflation." The four identified the
Federal Reserve Board's (FED)
monetary policies and the Vietnam
War as prime factors in the nation's
economic difficulties.
FED Behavior
"The FED has behaved in a matter
that economists can't understand,"
stated Prof. Ronald McKinnon. The
issuance or "proliferation" of money
by the FED according to Shaw
alternately fueled or braked the
economy, leaving an inflationary and
deflationary trail in its wake.
Shaw called the FED's actions
"dreadful" and said the issuance of
large amounts of money in the last few
years created much of the inflation the
country is now experiencing.
In addition, the four professors

mentioned the exporting of dollars
abroad to pay for imports and other
items such as the Vietnam War caused
a balance of payments imbalance, or
the importing of more than the nation
is exporting.
Mass Of Dollars
Foreigners have amassed large
amounts of dollars which must be
honored. The result of "bringing trade
into balance means that the United
States will have to pay more for their
imports," Abramovitz said. "The
result is the dollar gets devalued."
"Having embarked on a war, we did
not embark on a proper program of
war financing," he noted. "It [war
financing] would have brought home
the cost of the war."
The rise in gold prices raised little
concern with the four. "It [gold],"
according to McKinnon, "doesn't have
any casual significance. None of our
economic policies should be oriented
toward gold."
Best Of Our Output
What primarily concerned the four
was not so much economic indicators
but what Abramovitz said was
"making the best of our economic
output."
"There are manifest injustices in
the tax system that really need to be
corrected as well as a need to
redistribute income," the department
head stated. "The fact remains that
there are basic reforms that we need."
Gurley stated that profits in the
"corporate business area" should not
be given emphasis. "There is
something wrong with the poverty
conditions under which people live,"
he said.
"Twelve million people are
undernourished," Gurley added. Those
aren't the problems we're addressing
ourselves to. We're interested in those
goals of corporate profit, not the
problems of poverty, unemployment,
and undernourishment."
"There is a great deal to be done —
redistribution through a negative
income tax, anti-pollution investment
— all those things are important,"
Shaw stated. "But they are things that
are not accomplished fast, they are
things that will concern us forever."
