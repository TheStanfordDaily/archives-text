# Watergate Prosecutors May Subpoena President
## 
### 
From The Associated Press
WASHINGTON - Watergate
prosecutors say they have evidence
that would justify calling President
Nixon before the grand jury but are
not sure a subpoena would be
constitutional, the Washington Post
reported.
The newspaper, quoting
government sources in today's
editions, said the prosecutors have
recommended that former Atty. Gen.
John N. Mitchell and former White
House aides H.R. Haldeman and John
D. Ehrlichman be indicted.
"There's no bombshell tucked
away," one department source is
quoted as saying. "There is an
evidentiary pattern" that raises
questions about the President's role.
The Post, citing its sources, said the

prosecutors told their superiors that
the President should be questioned
about how high-level White House
staffers could have been involved in a
Watergate coverup without his
knowledge.
White House Press Secretary
Ronald L. Ziegler said the story, if
true, "reflects a shocking and
irresponsible abuse of authority on the
part of the federal prosecutors ...
Grand jury proceedings are by law
secret."
Ziegler said the White House is
asking Atty. Gen. Elliot L. Richardson
and special Watergate prosecutor
Archibald Cox "to investigate the
circumstances of these anonymous
charges against the President of the
United States — and to do so
immediately."
