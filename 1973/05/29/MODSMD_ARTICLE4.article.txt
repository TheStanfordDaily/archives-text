# Comstock Sees Council Election As Approval Of Past Directions
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
"I believe my greatest
accomplishment has been to get the
Council to work together in heavy and
tough times," Palo Alto Mayor Kirke
Comstock said in a KZSU interview
broadcast last night.
The Mayor said he expected no
major change in the balance of power
on the Council when two
newly-elected members take their seats
July 1. Comstock called the May 8
election "an approval of the directions
of the past two years."
He described relations between the
Council members as "very
good . .. generally quite civil. The
members don't carry lasting grudges,"
a condition he described as
"remarkable" in light of the
substantial differences in governmental
philosophy among the nine Council
members.
Comstock is one of five so-called
"liberal" Council members, who
frequently line up at odds with the
four more conservative Councilmen.
The election produced no change in
that balance, although it brought two
new faces to the Council.
Optimistic
Turning to specific issues,
Comstock was optimistic with regard
to the future of Stanford/Palo Alto

relations.
"Our relations have matured, for
which I give much credit to [Stanford
president] Dick Lyman and [Stanford
vice-president] Bob
Augsburger ... Stanford's land
development has matured ....
Stanford is now very adaptable and
amenable in the planning process," he
said.
Nevertheless, the Mayor cautioned
that "the relation will never be
entirely smooth. Each community has
its own interests."
Town And Gown
He pointed to his recent letter to
Stanford Trustees urging establishment
of a standing liaison between "town
and gown."
"We're communicating better. The
pressure is down a great deal" from
the late 19605, when several
development proposals for Stanford
lands became heated issues in Palo
Alto politics, Comstock noted.
Turning from Stanford land
development officials to radicals, the
Mayor defended his tactics in dealing
with disruptions of Council meetings.
"It bothers me to make strong
statements at the beginning of each
meeting," he said in reference to his
practice of calling attention to state
laws prohibiting meeting disruptions.
A prosecution for disruption would
be successful, he said, only if "there
was a clear disruption, clear
identification of those who did it, and
fairly consistent agreement by the
Council that that was the case."
Those conditions have never all
been present, he indicated.
Free Speech
Comstock, who has come under
considerable criticism from both
conservatives and radicals on this issue,
cautioned that "I don't have an easy
answer" and that "this is close to the
free speech issue, and that would be
hard-fought if any prosecution did
occur."
The Mayor was confident that the
Council would continue funding of the
controversial city drug abuse
treatment program.
He described the program's recent
problems — including the recent
temporary closure of the residential
treatment center when heroin was
found there — as part of "a learning
process .... There's a certain amount
of cost in going into new areas."
He praised the drug program staff

for attempting to solve the problems,
but said some Council members might
seek to have the program put under
closer control by city staff and the
Council.
Comstock, a Democrat, denied
higher political ambitions for himself,
although he conceded that in the past
he had "expressed interest" in taking
on State Sen. Clark Bradley (R-San
Jose).
He noted that the reapportionment
plans currently on the drawing boards
would put Palo Alto in the districts of
liberal State Sen. Arlen Gregorio
(D-San Mateo) and Assemblyman John
Vasconcellos (D-San Jose) rather than
the conservative Bradley.
