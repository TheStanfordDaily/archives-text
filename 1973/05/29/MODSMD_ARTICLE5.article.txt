# Sees Counterculture Break
## Wolfe Describes Youth Split 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Describing the lifestyles of surfers,
greasers, debutantes, hot-rodders and
new leftists with the perceptive style
that marks his writing, "new
journalist "-author Tom Wolfe spoke of
"Class Warfare Among Youth" to 300
people in Cubberley Auditorium
Saturday night.
Wolfe, author of The Electric Kool
Aid Acid Test, The Pump House Gang,
Radical Chic and Mau Mauing the
Flak-Catchers, and a frequent
contributor to Rolling Stone, Esquire,
and New York magazines, pointed out
that the "counterculture," seen at its
outset three years ago as a union of
people capable of rising up and
creating a revolution, is actually split
by bitter class and status warfare.

Although Wolfe countenanced the
flexibility of the American business
community's attempts to "sell
something" to the various factions of
the counterculture, he maintained that
discussion of class differences is "a
screaming taboo" among liberal youth
who still regard the movement as "an
actual mutation in the sensibility of
consciousness" cutting across class
lines.
Like the "debutante in blue jeans"
who boasts of spending weekends at
the day-care center " 'looking after the
most beautiful black children — and
learnings from them,' " people today
can't face the status-structure that was
"right out front" just over a decade
ago, he said.
'Teen Angels'
In the early '60's, Wolfe said,
middle class "greasers" and upper class
teens in a Westport, Connecticut high
school were so conscious of status
roles that actual fights broke out if a
greaser abandoned his "teen-angel"
look or her "beehive" hairdo to
overstep class boundaries.
In 1965, Wolfe "hung around" with
California surfers and heard about the
"greasers" or hotrodders who sported
fantastic hairdos and regarded the
tennie- and baggie-clad surfers as
"pansies." What he passed off as "local
color" at the time was actually the
beginning of a class split between the
middle-class surfers and the lower-class
hotrodders, he remarked.
Wolfe recalled the exploits of Ken
Kesey's Merry Pranksters, a collection
of drug-dabbling bohemians whose
lifestyle he described in The Electric
Kool Aid Acid Test. The Merry
Pranksters went "all the way" in
bridging the class gap in 1963 by
inviting the Hell's Angels to their
house in the hills near Stanford. When
the Angels arrived, they were greeted

by a naked Alan Ginsberg playing Hare
Krishna on the finger cymbals in front
of the La Honda house.
Out-Grossed
"The Angels were shocked," Wolfe
reminisced, "they had been
out-grossed!"
But the apparent honeymoon of
middle-class intelligentsia and the
lower-echelon Angels came to an
abrupt halt in 1965 as a flying wedge
of Angels literally demolished the first
student march in Berkeley, and later
volunteered for a tour of duty as
President Johnson's "gorillas" in
Vietnam, Wolfe related.
Wolfe, who holds a Yale doctorate
in American Studies, pointed out that
the crucial dividing line among youth
is whether or not the father has a
university Bachelor of Arts degree.
The BA class distinction includes such
subtle values as "good taste" he added.
Attack On The 'New Left'
He offered biting criticism of the
"new left" — the student
demonstration leaders of 1968-1970,
and its attempt to serve as the
ideological mobilizers of the poor
while severely attacking the middle
class and ignoring the indiscretions of
the upper echelons.
"When the collegians discarded the
MacGregor look for plaid workshirts
they did it wrong," he charged. "They
didn't look at the reality of life in the
streets and their mistake was a tip-off
to the class conflict split."
In response to former ASSU
vice-president Brent Appel's
countercharge that the Stanford new
left had actually attacked the upper
class and not the workers, Wolfe
stated, "The new left didn't attack the
workers, it alienated them and bought
the euphemisms for the other classes.
If the new left had approached the
