# Music Versus Public Affairs
## KZSU Programming Problem 
### CHRISTY WISE 
KZSU faces most of the same
decision-making problems as
educational radio stations not
affiliated with universities. A prime
example of this is the perpetual
dilemma of how much public affairs to
broadcast and at what time of day.
Licensed as an educational station,
KZSU has the responsibility "to do
something educational with that
license," said station manager Lloyd
Snook.
"That is our prime responsibility,"
he explained. "We should be putting
public affairs and educational
programming in prime time when most
people are listening."
On the other hand, many KZSU
staffers think that the station would
serve the public interest best by
broadcasting what the community
most wants to hear during the time
when most are able to listen.
'Serve The Students'
Station engineer Tom Hedges said
that during the evenings and early
mornings, "I think most people want
to listen to music." KZSU, he said,
"should primarily serve the Stanford
students with what they want."
A major dilemma is that of
identifying prime time, of determining
what the community wants to hear,
and of how best to serve the
community.
Snook thinks a lot of prime time

controversy comes down to "gut
feeling, when each person thinks
people are listening most."
Music Mood
Disc jockey Cory Boyon regards
prime time as after 8 p.m. "That's
when most people are in the mood to
listen to music. Unfortunately, the
public affairs department feels that's
prime time ... I don't think that's the
best time for public affairs."
Boyon said that there has been a
great deal of friction between the
public affairs department and disc
jockeys at KZSU, "more this year than
in the past." Hedges added, "The
people in the music department aren't
that dissatisfied right now."
Program director A 1 Gehri thinks
that "public affairs is a very important
part of what KZSU is doing," but that
KZSU should also "do what we can to
please our audience."
Gehri said, "I think people would
rather hear music at night than rap. At
the same time, they will listen to those
things they're interested in. You can't
say blanketly people won't listen to
public affairs.
'Quality'
Gehri suggests that if KZSU "can
do quality public affairs and make it
interesting, we can do more. That
situation has not arisen." He doesn't
think that just because a program is
public affairs, it should be broadcast.
A very sketchy survey was

conducted last year to determine
audience preference. Gehri said the
survey "seemed to show people tended
to listen more to music." He added
that this should not be the only
criterion on which to base
broadcasting decisions.
Surveys, according to Snook, are
not conducted on a regular basis
because they "take a lot of
time ... far more than we want to
spend." He agrees with Gehri that
determining audience preference does
not indicate how best to serve the
community.
A big preference in this area, said
Snook, is for KFRC. "Does that mean
you put on KFRC-type
programming?"
Idealistic Vs Pragmatic
Snook explained there is a tradeoff
between "how idealistic you get versus
how pragmatic... on one hand news
serves the public interest better than
the Osmond Brothers' Greatest Hits,
but the Osmonds will draw more
people." Bl cause KZSU isn't
commercial, Snook feels, "We have
room to be idealistic."
Snook queries, "If you have
mediocre public affairs, do you put
that on instead of a good music show?
Where do you draw the line?" KZSU,
he said, has drawn the line with a bias
toward public affairs.
The last couple of quarters KZSU
has broadcast "more public affairs
than in recent memory," said Snook.
"About double what it was last year."
He added, "If we could get more good
public affairs then I think we should
put that on. There shouldn't be an
upper limit to the amount of public
affairs."
Low Percentage
According to public affairs director
Bob Fuss, KZSU is currently
broadcasting about 15 hours a week of
public affairs and news. Since they are
on the air about 20 hours a day, seven
days a week, Fuss concludes, "That's
not a very high percentage."
Boyon said broadcasting of public
affairs should depend "on whether the
public affairs that's put on is well done
and worth listening to, or
incompetently and unprofessionally
produced, which in many cases it has
been."
KZSU priorities, according to
Snook, are determined by Federal
Communications Commission
suggestions about educational
programming and by the University's
suggestions, offered in a charter to
KZSU in 1946 which was reinforced in
1964, that KZSU carry live speeches
and events on campus that can't be

heard elsewhere.
Fuss agrees that KZSU's first
obligation is to the Stanford
community and to public affairs. He
explained that there are many
music-oriented radio stations in the
Bay Area, but "few places where
people can get a real diversity of
opinion."
