# The 						Highest Form Of Consciousness
## Paranoia: On The Rise 
### 
Larry Hummer

The Los Angeles Times
recently carried a letter which
mentioned that not one of the
so-called "Watergate Kids" has
long hair. The writer ruefully
noted that the nation has been
informed for a long time that
longhair hippies were out to
destroy it, but instead Watergate
is run by men with crew cuts.
Now, if you can't trust a man
with a crew cut, who can you
trust?
The answer is that you cannot
trust anybody. Perhaps Richard
Nixon deserves an award for
further advancing the already
advanced paranoia rampant in the
United States.
It seems a benevolent public
service to advance that paranoia.
Besides the positive effects such
action has on the psychiatric
profession, it also helps prepare
the population for the future.
People take time to adjust to new
things, and if the government does
not push things along, 1984 will
be here before we are all ready for
it. A President such as Nixon,
committed to "preparedness,"
obviously cannot allow such a
thing to happen.
Clever
Now Nixon is a clever man,
well skilled at playing on people's
collective psyches from his long
years in politics. Thus he took the
basic paranoia of our time, crime,
and gave it major billing. People
who miss being mugged on the
street now have to fear being
bugged by the White House.
The signs are that people are
already adjusting. Apathy is
setting in as a defensive reaction.
Housewives complain bitterly
when their soap operas are
bumped off the airwaves by Sam
Ervin's tea party. I recently talked
to an elderly woman on an
airplane who told me she could

not understand why there was all
the fuss about the Watergate
bugging.
After all, she said, with a glint
in her eye, her insurance company
had been bugging her for years!
She did not understand why
people should get mad at Nixon
for doing what they were doing
themselves. She felt his only
mistake was admitting it all on
television.
Scared
But some are not apathetic;
instead they are scared. Last week
I called up a friend of mine to
borrow some class notes.
"No comment," he answerd.
"I just wanted to ask you
about the Econ section."
"I can categorically state," he
said, "that I have never had any
connection whatsoever with that
organization."
CIA, NSC, USMC
"Cool it, Barney," I said, "I'm
not from the FBI."
"Oh, the CIA! Or is it the
Marine Corps, or the National
Security Council, or the Executive
Office of the President, or
the "
"Why would anybody be after
you, Barney?"
"I supported George McGovern
to the hilt; I even contributed a
quarter to his campaign."
Finally, we arranged a suitable
arrangement so that the transfer
of the notes could take place. I
drove to the phone booth on the
corner of Middlefield and San
Antonio road. Then Barney called
me and tole me to meet him at
Jack in the Box. As I drove up to
talk to Jack, Barney got in the car
on the passenger side.
I was aghast at his appearance.
His face was unshaven and he
seemed to have lost a lot of
weight, while his eyes constantly

darted back and forth across the
parking lot around us.
As I was paying for a couple of
hamburgers, Barney slipped the
notes into the ventilator duct on
the top of the dashboard. Then,
grabbing the hamburgers, he
disappeared, but not before
defiantly stating that he would
reject executive clemency.
So you see, the paranoia is well
advanced around us. The only
thing is, I fear poor Barney is
beginning to enjoy it.

long hair. The writer ruefully
noted that the nation has been
informed for a long time that
longhair hippies were out to
destroy it, but instead Watergate
is run by men with crew cuts.
Now, if you can't trust a man
with a crew cut, who can you
trust?
The answer is that you cannot
trust anybody. Perhaps Richard
Nixon deserves an award for
further advancing the already
advanced paranoia rampant in the
United States.
It seems a benevolent public
service to advance that paranoia.
Besides the positive effects such
action has on the psychiatric
profession, it also helps prepare
the population for the future.
People take time to adjust to new
things, and if the government does
not push things along, 1984 will
be here before we are all ready for
it. A President such as Nixon,
committed to "preparedness,"
obviously cannot allow such a
thing to happen.
Clever
Now Nixon is a clever man,
well skilled at playing on people's
collective psyches from his long
years in politics. Thus he took the
basic paranoia of our time, crime,
and gave it major billing. People
who miss being mugged on the
street now have to fear being
bugged by the White House.
The signs are that people are
already adjusting. Apathy is
setting in as a defensive reaction.
Housewives complain bitterly
when their soap operas are
bumped off the airwaves by Sam
Ervin's tea party. I recently talked
to an elderly woman on an
airplane who told me she could

not understand why there was all
the fuss about the Watergate
bugging.
After all, she said, with a glint
in her eye, her insurance company
had been bugging her for years!
She did not understand why
people should get mad at Nixon
for doing what they were doing
themselves. She felt his only
mistake was admitting it all on
television.
Scared
But some are not apathetic;
instead they are scared. Last week
I called up a friend of mine to
borrow some class notes.
"No comment," he answerd.
"I just wanted to ask you
about the Econ section."
"I can categorically state," he
said, "that I have never had any
connection whatsoever with that
organization."
CIA, NSC, USMC
"Cool it, Barney," I said, "I'm
not from the FBI."
"Oh, the CIA! Or is it the
Marine Corps, or the National
Security Council, or the Executive
Office of the President, or
the "
"Why would anybody be after
you, Barney?"
"I supported George McGovern
to the hilt; I even contributed a
quarter to his campaign."
Finally, we arranged a suitable
arrangement so that the transfer
of the notes could take place. I
drove to the phone booth on the
corner of Middlefield and San
Antonio road. Then Barney called
me and tole me to meet him at
Jack in the Box. As I drove up to
talk to Jack, Barney got in the car
on the passenger side.
I was aghast at his appearance.
His face was unshaven and he
seemed to have lost a lot of
weight, while his eyes constantly

darted back and forth across the
parking lot around us.
As I was paying for a couple of
hamburgers, Barney slipped the
notes into the ventilator duct on
the top of the dashboard. Then,
grabbing the hamburgers, he
disappeared, but not before
defiantly stating that he would
reject executive clemency.
So you see, the paranoia is well
advanced around us. The only
thing is, I fear poor Barney is
beginning to enjoy it.
