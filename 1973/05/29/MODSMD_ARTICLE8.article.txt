"I meant what I said,
And I said what I meant,
An elephant's faithful,
One hundred percent!"
â€”from Horton Hatches the Egg,
by Theodore Geisel (Dr. Seuss)
Stanford's burning issue for Spring Quarter was the notorious Phi
Delt party, and not suprisingly so, because the University
administration has a knack for sweeping more important matters
relevant to student life under the rug, at least as far as open debate is
concerned.
For over three years, the University has kept the lid on an essential
question, namely: What distinctions shall be made on the basis of skin
color in student housing? Rather than reaching out for wide-spread
reactions from the student body, Stanford has quietly implemented
various "experimental" programs known as "minority concentration
dorms" or, in other circles, "concentration camps."
These programs are under control of the Housing Office and, more
specifically, are generally the brainchild of Assistant Dean of Students
Larry N. Horton. In his earlier days, Horton supervised one of his
projects as Resident Fellow of Roble Hall. However, prompted by an
embarrassing series of events which culminated in the burning of his
motorcycle, Horton retreated to his office in the Old Union, where he
enjoys relative anonymity.
Philosophy
Meanwhile, after three years of tinkering with the lives of students,
the Housing Office has yet to come up with any official explanation
of its general philosophy.
Prof. John Palmer, during his 1968-70 tenure as Roble House
Fellow, charged that, "policy decisions in this area are usually made
on an ad hoc, piecemeal basis, more often in response to student
initiative than because of the leadership of professional staff with any
well-defined guidelines, let alone goals."
Early in 1970, the University had decided that undergraduate
students labeled as Black and Chicano (and later, Asian-American and
Native American) constituted monolithic groups with problems and
concerns above and beyond those of all other students. Plans were
underway to create minority concentration dorms for the 1970-71
academic year; rather than explore student opinion to any great
extent, the Housing Office managed to railroad its plans into action
by two principal methods.
Prove
First, to prove that its experiments were justified, the University
relied on "position papers" drawn up by leaders of campus
organizations (such as BSU and MEChA) which purported to be The
Voice of students of the respective ethnic groups.
Second, the Housing Office peddled a bill of goods to "minority"
students, particularly to incoming freshman, encouraging them to
believe that residential arrangements, based on ethnicity alone, are a
desirable facet of undergraduate life. Cliche-ridden statements urged
that "a sense of community" is necessary to avoid "culture shock" in
non-white Stanford students. No mention was made of the culture
shock suffered by students of all colors who are on their own in a big
University for the first time.
A 1971 report entitlted The Study of Residential Life said, "early
concentration of interests and inclinations may prevent the freshman's
exposure to backgrounds and ideas which might have a great impact
on his development. Accordingly, wherever the freshman lives, the
house should be composed of a sufficient number of his peers from
diverse backgrounds to provide for a solid cross-section of interests."
The Housing Office's unofficial amendment to this courageous
statement would have to read, "unless his skin isn't white."
Opportunities
The white and non white students of Stanford have more in
common than University officials are willing to admit; yet in the few
years that non-whites have been admitted to Stanford in significant
numbers, not enough opportunities for a true ethnic mix in housing
have been presented. Instead, the system in effect tells the non-white
student, "You people belong together," as if our non-campus society

were not sufficiently exclusive on ethnic grounds.
Because Stanford University housing consists of a number of
empty buildings which are filled each September at the whims of
Larry Horton and Co., there would be little difficulty in trying to
de-ghettoize part of society by implementing a sort of "racial
balance" in the dorms. The 1970 position papers reject any such
moves in terms such as these reported by Larry Horton: "They
perceive the predominant white culture within the residences as
hostile, intolerant, and racist, at worst, and disinterested and
self-centered, at best." When pinned down to specific complaints
against their former white neighbors, minority spokesmen could only
cite such incidents as squabbles over "playing our music or playint
their music," and other earth-shaking concerns which could easily
plague students of a single ethnic group as well as provoking racial
conflict.
It is certainly the University's fault that the myth of "white
culture" has been preserved, when it is no more than a reference to
the days when conformity was the rule and the non-conformist was an
outcast. In point of fact, "white" is not an ethnic group and has no
culture of its own. But rather than expose the myth for what it is, the
University has gone on to promote new myths of a "Black culture" or
"Chicano culture," to which students of the appropriate colors must
subscribe at the risk of being labeled outcasts.
