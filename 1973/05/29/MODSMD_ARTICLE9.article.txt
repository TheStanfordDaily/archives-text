# California Summer Project
## The 						Farmworkers Need Volunteers 
### 
Brent Appel and David Gorchoff

The media would have it that
movements for social change in
America are dead, that the
struggles for justice at home and
abroad that characterized the
1960s have somehow dissolved
without solution in the
supposedly apathetic seventies.
But just as a group of
concerned citizens joined together
for a "Mississippi Summer" to
work for the civil rights of racial
minorities, so too a group of local
citizens is organizing a "California
Summer" to protect the rights
and lives of farmworkers. The
central issue in the sturggle is the
very survival of the works' union,
theUnited Farm Workers (UFW) of
the AFL-CIO.
The record of the UFW in
improving the living standards and
working conditions of Farm

Workers is indisputable. In 1965,
before workers were represented
by the UFW, wages in the table
grape industry were one dollar per
hour for field hands. Farmworkers
had no protection from
indiscriminate firing. Women and
workers over the age of forty were
discriminated against in hiring.
After five years of grape strike
and boycott, the major growers
signed union contracts with the
United Farm Workers on July 29,
1970. Wages were increased to
$2.30 per hour, equal rights for
women were guaranteed, firing
without cause eliminated, and
working conditions improved.
Teamsters
Corporate agriculture,
however, seems determined to
break the union. This April, the
major growers in the Coachella

Valley, one of the largest grape
producing areas of California,
renegotiated the UFW contracts
with the giant Teamsters Union.
Granting substantially lower
benefits than the UFW negotiating
position, the contracts with the
Teamsters were signed despite a
Migrant Ministry poll which
showed that 80 percent of the
workers favored their own union,
the United Farm Workers, over
the outside entry of the
Teamsters.
Those familiar with labor
history in the United States no
doubt recognize the
Teamster-grower pacts as
infamous "sweet-heart" contracts
designed by the companies and a
cooperative outside group to
break the backs of a popular
indigenous union. Because the
growers have signed these
"sweet-heart" contracts that deny
farm workers substantial benefits
as well as the right to control their
own union, the United Farm
Workers are on strike.
Members of the Stanford
Community are urgently needed
to work with the Union during
the coming summer, a time when
the fate of farm-labor organizing
may be decided. Workers are
needed, both full and part-time,
to help with boycott activities
against Safeway and other stores
which stock non-UFW products.
Volunteers are need for leafleting,
picketing, and talking to
consumers about the farm
workers' struggle.
Struggle
Room and board with a small
amount of- money for expenses
will be provided to those who
volunteer to work full time with
the boycott staff this summer.
Those whose interest lies in
achieving monetary goals will find
the life unappealing. Not only are
the wages low, but the hours are
long and the struggle is hard.
But the California Summer is
an opportunity for personal
growth. Those who spent a
"Mississippi Summer" had an
experience they will never forget:
a similar opportunity is available
to you. Rather than
intellectualizing about politics,
you will be participating in a

struggle for economic justice with
the most effective organization for
non-violent social change in
America today.
In the next few weeks, there
will be a series of discussions
about "California Summer" which
you are encouraged to attend.
David Harris, former ASSU
President, co-organizer of the
Resistance, and current writer for
Rolling Stone will be discussing
"California Summer" and the
farm workers' struggle in the main

lounge of Florence Moore tonight
and in the Junipero Lounge of
Wilber Hall on May 31, both
meetings starting at eight o'clock.
The farm workers depend on
us, their supporters, now more
than ever, to join their struggle.
Work with the United Farm
Workers in a California Summer.
Viva la Huelga!
