# University Prepares To Suspend Delta Tau Delta For Two Years
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
University authorities are prepared
to suspend the Delta Tau Delta
fraternity from campus for two years
following numerous complaints of
misconduct.
Residents of nearby houses,
including Synergy and the Theta Xi
fraternity, have charged that Delta Tau
Delta members threw rocks and
bottles through house windows, fired
pdlet guns at car and house windows,
and set fire to a mattress on their own
front lawn.
In a letter hand-delivered to
fraternity officials Monday, Associate
Dean of Student Affairs Larry Horton
said "we are convinced that the
further use of the house by its present
residents will continue to be a serious
threat to people and property in the
immediate vicinity — a situation which
the University cannot tolerate."
After receiving the letter, which
announced the University's intention
to terminate the Delts' lease as of June
30, officials of the fraternity requested
a meeting with Horton to discuss the
situation.
Horton, Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons, Special Assistant to the
President John Schwartz, Director of
Fraternities Norman Robinson, and

Manager of Residences and
Fraternities Alan Cummings met for
more than two i ours early yesterday
morning with Delt House President
Brad Williams, Treasurer Bryan Wilson,
House Adviser Bill Allhouse and Delt
Alumni Corporation President Marty
Brill.
Meeting Today
At Brill's request, the University
authorities agreed to fully consider the
views expressed at the meeting and to
wait until this morning before
implementing any decision. Another
meeting has been scheduled for 8 a.m.
today.
However, Horton warned that "it
would be unwise to raise false
expectations" because of the delay in
publicly announcing any decision.
Regarding the charges of rock and
bottle throwing, Horton's letter says:
"The fraternity has repeatedly
acknowledged its responsibility for
many of those acts, and in several
cases has paid for the damage caused,
but the incidents continue."
Delts Warned
The letter said that representatives
of the Dean's office had "met with
officers of Delta Tau Delta six times
[in 19731, and on one occasion with
the entire house, to inform them that

those activities could not be tolerated
and would lead to suspension of the
fraternity."
According to the letter, house
officials and residents explained that
"such activities are a house tradition,
that some members are difficult to
control, and that some members feel
they may as well live up to an image
they believe they already have on the
campus."
Synergy House Associate Charlene
Peterson said yesterday that house
residents had written and sent to the
Dean's office "several complaints
providing different personal
accounts ... of rock throwing, B-B
shooting and window breaking"
directed at Synergy House.
Window Shattered
Peterson explained that "things
started happening when they [the
Delts J had their initiation in

February." She said one woman had
been "in her room studying late at
night ... when [a Delt] threw a rock
through her window and just about hit
her." According to Peterson, this
incident occurred "several weeks ago."
Theta Xi President Jerry Coleman
said the Delts had thrown bottles
through about five windows this year.
According to Coleman, "every time
they threw bottles at the house, we
notified" Robinson.
Coleman said his fraternity had also
complained to Robinson when Delts
"came into a pledge party" at Theta
Xi and behaved in "generally a rowdy
and drunken" manner.
In the spring of 1971, the Stanford
Judicial Council placed the Delts on
probation for the 1971-72 academic
year after complaints about similar
incidents involving Theta Xi.

they threw bottles at the house, we
notified" Robinson.
Coleman said his fraternity had also
complained to Robinson when Delts
"came into a pledge party" at Theta
Xi and behaved in "generally a rowdy
and drunken" manner.
In the spring of 1971, the Stanford
Judicial Council placed the Delts on
probation for the 1971-72 academic
year after complaints about similar
incidents involving Theta Xi.
University authorities are prepared
to suspend the Delta Tau Delta
fraternity from campus for two years
following numerous complaints of
misconduct.
Residents of nearby houses,
including Synergy and the Theta Xi
fraternity, have charged that Delta Tau
Delta members threw rocks and
bottles through house windows, fired
pdlet guns at car and house windows,
and set fire to a mattress on their own
front lawn.
In a letter hand-delivered to
fraternity officials Monday, Associate
Dean of Student Affairs Larry Horton
said "we are convinced that the
further use of the house by its present
residents will continue to be a serious
threat to people and property in the
immediate vicinity — a situation which
the University cannot tolerate."
After receiving the letter, which
announced the University's intention
to terminate the Delts' lease as of June
30, officials of the fraternity requested
a meeting with Horton to discuss the
situation.
Horton, Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons, Special Assistant to the
President John Schwartz, Director of
Fraternities Norman Robinson, and

Manager of Residences and
Fraternities Alan Cummings met for
more than two i ours early yesterday
morning with Delt House President
Brad Williams, Treasurer Bryan Wilson,
House Adviser Bill Allhouse and Delt
Alumni Corporation President Marty
Brill.
Meeting Today
At Brill's request, the University
authorities agreed to fully consider the
views expressed at the meeting and to
wait until this morning before
implementing any decision. Another
meeting has been scheduled for 8 a.m.
today.
However, Horton warned that "it
would be unwise to raise false
expectations" because of the delay in
publicly announcing any decision.
Regarding the charges of rock and
bottle throwing, Horton's letter says:
"The fraternity has repeatedly
acknowledged its responsibility for
many of those acts, and in several
cases has paid for the damage caused,
but the incidents continue."
Delts Warned
The letter said that representatives
of the Dean's office had "met with
officers of Delta Tau Delta six times
[in 19731, and on one occasion with
the entire house, to inform them that

those activities could not be tolerated
and would lead to suspension of the
fraternity."
According to the letter, house
officials and residents explained that
"such activities are a house tradition,
that some members are difficult to
control, and that some members feel
they may as well live up to an image
they believe they already have on the
campus."
Synergy House Associate Charlene
Peterson said yesterday that house
residents had written and sent to the
Dean's office "several complaints
providing different personal
accounts ... of rock throwing, B-B
shooting and window breaking"
directed at Synergy House.
Window Shattered
Peterson explained that "things
started happening when they [the
Delts J had their initiation in

February." She said one woman had
been "in her room studying late at
night ... when [a Delt] threw a rock
through her window and just about hit
her." According to Peterson, this
incident occurred "several weeks ago."
Theta Xi President Jerry Coleman
said the Delts had thrown bottles
through about five windows this year.
According to Coleman, "every time
they threw bottles at the house, we
notified" Robinson.
Coleman said his fraternity had also
complained to Robinson when Delts
"came into a pledge party" at Theta
Xi and behaved in "generally a rowdy
