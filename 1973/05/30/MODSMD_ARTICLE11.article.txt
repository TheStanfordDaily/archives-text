# Horton's Egg, Continued
## Minority Housing 'Groupthink' 
### 
Dan Kravetz

(Second of two parts)
The preservation by the
University, and specifically by its
housing office, of the myths of
"white culture," "Black culture,"
and "Chicano culture" has
threatened those students who do
not conform to the 'proper' roles
with being labeled outcasts. This
institutional application of
"groupthink" has penalized
individual Stanford students of all
colors.
One of the most compelling
examples of what the system does
to the individual is the case of a
white male undergraduate who
will be known here as Tom. Tom
came to Stanford from an
integrated public high school in a
large East Coast city. Two years
ago he was a resident of a
minority concentration dorm, and
the experience was one which
influenced his entire campus life
since then.

When questioned, Tom
described his experiences that
year: "I made enemies pretty
soon because I didn't always
know where I was off limits. For
example, I had a few arguments
about the use of dorm facilities,
like the lounges, the stereo and
TV. Nobody told me that I was
speaking for the whole white race,
so I was really thrown off balance
when petty arguments turned into
near-fights with self-appointed
minority leaders.
Jeers
"About halfway through the
year I started being the target of
jeers, insults and a few threats
whenever I would pass one of the
leaders in the dorm or anywhere
else. It reminded me of some of
the neighborhood bullies I knew
when I was a kid, and I couldn't
believe that this was happening at
Stanford University. Although
only three or four guys started the

treatment, the whole thing spread
until it was a big group activity to
scream and yell whenever anyone
saw me.
"It's been two years since I
lived with any of those guys, but
we still run into each other
around the campus, and the
routine hasn't changed. Even now,
any time I start to walk through
White Plaza, I remember my old
friends and hope I don't run into
them so they can create a scene
right in front of everybody.
Sometimes I even change
direction when I think I might
meet a couple of them and get the
treatment.
"The amazing thing is I only
spoke to them a few times during
the year we lived in the same
dorm, and only to the three or
four leaders of the gang. And all I
ever did was complain that I had
the right to be in the lounge or
the TV room whenever I choose. I
never tried .to use force or
coercion on anyone, although I
got punched in the jaw at one
point. But I'm always being
bothered by people who don't
even know me, except that
someone told them I was a
smart-ass white boy who had to
be taught a lesson."
Failure
Tom's experience may be
unique in many aspects, but many
other non-minority residents of
the concentration dorms have
reported a wide range of
treatment from physical violence
to cold stares. Reports in the press
of segregated social functions,
both formal and informal, are all
too familiar to repeat here. The
plain fact is that minority
concentration dorms are a failure
and should be eliminated as
quickly as possible.
Why have there been so few
voices of protest heard? First of
all, the white students involved
are often afraid of possible
repercussions by their own
neighbors; they are also reluctant
to speak out against views which
are the quintessence of liberal
chic. Anyone who has seen
political turmoil at Stanford can
vouch for that.
Besides, when students have
complained personally to
University authorities, they are
often reportedly received with
detached amusement of the type
usually reserved for Archie
Bunker on television.
Loaded
In the minority sector itself, no
matter how often researchers ask
whether students like the setup,
the question will always be a
loaded one. Ask any college
student whether he would like to
live among people who are similar
to himself, thus preventing
emotional turmoil and conflict; he
will find it hard to say no,
particularly if he is a disoriented
freshman. If the University were
to implement a campus-wide
computer matching of freshman
roommates, some progress might
be made, but short of such a
radical step, there is no substitute
for giving all students an equal
crack at working out their own
relationships, without any
predestined classifications
imposed.
It is time for Stanford to stop
drawing lines to separate the
races. As a first step, freshman
housing assignments should be
made without regard to race or
religion, while care should be
taken that white and non-white
ethnic groups — including WASPS
— are not unevenly distributed in
freshman living spaces. For
upperclassmen, no special
facilities for racial groups should
be offered, but students should be
permitted to draw in small groups,
which one assumes would be
made up of friends chosen in an

atmosphere free of prejudice.
If Larry Horton and his
colleagues are not interested in
eliminating racial barriers, then
the University should shop around
for a housing staff that is. If
Stanford fails to acknowledge that
every student is an individual,
whatever his color or creed, then

there may come a day when large
numbers of people like Tom
attempt to take matters into their
own hands, sending sociologists
scurrying back to their drawing
boards while Horton gets busy
hatching the next egg.

relationships, without any
predestined classifications
imposed.
It is time for Stanford to stop
drawing lines to separate the
races. As a first step, freshman
housing assignments should be
made without regard to race or
religion, while care should be
taken that white and non-white
ethnic groups — including WASPS
— are not unevenly distributed in
freshman living spaces. For
upperclassmen, no special
facilities for racial groups should
be offered, but students should be
permitted to draw in small groups,
which one assumes would be
made up of friends chosen in an

atmosphere free of prejudice.
If Larry Horton and his
colleagues are not interested in
eliminating racial barriers, then
the University should shop around
for a housing staff that is. If
Stanford fails to acknowledge that
every student is an individual,
whatever his color or creed, then

there may come a day when large
numbers of people like Tom
attempt to take matters into their
own hands, sending sociologists
scurrying back to their drawing
boards while Horton gets busy
hatching the next egg.

The preservation by the
University, and specifically by its
housing office, of the myths of
"white culture," "Black culture,"
and "Chicano culture" has
threatened those students who do
not conform to the 'proper' roles
with being labeled outcasts. This
institutional application of
"groupthink" has penalized
individual Stanford students of all
colors.
One of the most compelling
examples of what the system does
to the individual is the case of a
white male undergraduate who
will be known here as Tom. Tom
came to Stanford from an
integrated public high school in a
large East Coast city. Two years
ago he was a resident of a
minority concentration dorm, and
the experience was one which
influenced his entire campus life
since then.

When questioned, Tom
described his experiences that
year: "I made enemies pretty
soon because I didn't always
know where I was off limits. For
example, I had a few arguments
about the use of dorm facilities,
like the lounges, the stereo and
TV. Nobody told me that I was
speaking for the whole white race,
so I was really thrown off balance
when petty arguments turned into
near-fights with self-appointed
minority leaders.
Jeers
"About halfway through the
year I started being the target of
jeers, insults and a few threats
whenever I would pass one of the
leaders in the dorm or anywhere
else. It reminded me of some of
the neighborhood bullies I knew
when I was a kid, and I couldn't
believe that this was happening at
Stanford University. Although
only three or four guys started the

treatment, the whole thing spread
until it was a big group activity to
scream and yell whenever anyone
saw me.
"It's been two years since I
lived with any of those guys, but
we still run into each other
around the campus, and the
routine hasn't changed. Even now,
any time I start to walk through
White Plaza, I remember my old
friends and hope I don't run into
them so they can create a scene
right in front of everybody.
Sometimes I even change
direction when I think I might
meet a couple of them and get the
treatment.
"The amazing thing is I only
spoke to them a few times during
the year we lived in the same
dorm, and only to the three or
four leaders of the gang. And all I
ever did was complain that I had
the right to be in the lounge or
the TV room whenever I choose. I
never tried .to use force or
coercion on anyone, although I
got punched in the jaw at one
point. But I'm always being
bothered by people who don't
even know me, except that
someone told them I was a
smart-ass white boy who had to
be taught a lesson."
Failure
Tom's experience may be
unique in many aspects, but many
other non-minority residents of
the concentration dorms have
reported a wide range of
treatment from physical violence
to cold stares. Reports in the press
of segregated social functions,
both formal and informal, are all
too familiar to repeat here. The
plain fact is that minority
concentration dorms are a failure
and should be eliminated as
quickly as possible.
Why have there been so few
voices of protest heard? First of
all, the white students involved
are often afraid of possible
repercussions by their own
neighbors; they are also reluctant
to speak out against views which
are the quintessence of liberal
chic. Anyone who has seen
political turmoil at Stanford can
vouch for that.
Besides, when students have
complained personally to
University authorities, they are
often reportedly received with
detached amusement of the type
usually reserved for Archie
Bunker on television.
Loaded
In the minority sector itself, no
matter how often researchers ask
whether students like the setup,
the question will always be a
loaded one. Ask any college
student whether he would like to
live among people who are similar
to himself, thus preventing
emotional turmoil and conflict; he
will find it hard to say no,
particularly if he is a disoriented
freshman. If the University were
to implement a campus-wide
computer matching of freshman
roommates, some progress might
be made, but short of such a
radical step, there is no substitute
for giving all students an equal
crack at working out their own
relationships, without any
predestined classifications
imposed.

voices of protest heard? First of
all, the white students involved
are often afraid of possible
repercussions by their own
neighbors; they are also reluctant
to speak out against views which
are the quintessence of liberal
chic. Anyone who has seen
political turmoil at Stanford can
vouch for that.
Besides, when students have
complained personally to
University authorities, they are
often reportedly received with
detached amusement of the type
usually reserved for Archie
Bunker on television.
Loaded
In the minority sector itself, no
matter how often researchers ask
whether students like the setup,
the question will always be a
loaded one. Ask any college
student whether he would like to
live among people who are similar
to himself, thus preventing
emotional turmoil and conflict; he
will find it hard to say no,
particularly if he is a disoriented
freshman. If the University were
to implement a campus-wide
computer matching of freshman
roommates, some progress might
be made, but short of such a
radical step, there is no substitute
for giving all students an equal
crack at working out their own
relationships, without any
predestined classifications
imposed.
It is time for Stanford to stop
drawing lines to separate the
races. As a first step, freshman
housing assignments should be
made without regard to race or
religion, while care should be
taken that white and non-white
ethnic groups — including WASPS
— are not unevenly distributed in
freshman living spaces. For
upperclassmen, no special
facilities for racial groups should
be offered, but students should be
permitted to draw in small groups,
which one assumes would be
made up of friends chosen in an

atmosphere free of prejudice.
If Larry Horton and his
colleagues are not interested in
eliminating racial barriers, then
the University should shop around
for a housing staff that is. If
Stanford fails to acknowledge that
every student is an individual,
whatever his color or creed, then

there may come a day when large
numbers of people like Tom
attempt to take matters into their
own hands, sending sociologists
scurrying back to their drawing
boards while Horton gets busy
hatching the next egg.

The preservation by the
University, and specifically by its
housing office, of the myths of
"white culture," "Black culture,"
and "Chicano culture" has
threatened those students who do
not conform to the 'proper' roles
with being labeled outcasts. This
institutional application of
"groupthink" has penalized
individual Stanford students of all
colors.
One of the most compelling
examples of what the system does
to the individual is the case of a
white male undergraduate who
will be known here as Tom. Tom
came to Stanford from an
integrated public high school in a
large East Coast city. Two years
ago he was a resident of a
minority concentration dorm, and
the experience was one which
influenced his entire campus life
since then.

When questioned, Tom
described his experiences that
year: "I made enemies pretty
soon because I didn't always
know where I was off limits. For
example, I had a few arguments
about the use of dorm facilities,
like the lounges, the stereo and
TV. Nobody told me that I was
speaking for the whole white race,
so I was really thrown off balance
when petty arguments turned into
near-fights with self-appointed
minority leaders.
Jeers
"About halfway through the
year I started being the target of
jeers, insults and a few threats
whenever I would pass one of the
leaders in the dorm or anywhere
else. It reminded me of some of
the neighborhood bullies I knew
when I was a kid, and I couldn't
believe that this was happening at
Stanford University. Although
only three or four guys started the

treatment, the whole thing spread
until it was a big group activity to
scream and yell whenever anyone
saw me.
"It's been two years since I
lived with any of those guys, but
we still run into each other
around the campus, and the
routine hasn't changed. Even now,
any time I start to walk through
White Plaza, I remember my old
friends and hope I don't run into
them so they can create a scene
right in front of everybody.
Sometimes I even change
direction when I think I might
meet a couple of them and get the
treatment.
"The amazing thing is I only
spoke to them a few times during
the year we lived in the same
dorm, and only to the three or
four leaders of the gang. And all I
ever did was complain that I had
the right to be in the lounge or
the TV room whenever I choose. I
never tried .to use force or
coercion on anyone, although I
got punched in the jaw at one
point. But I'm always being
bothered by people who don't
even know me, except that
someone told them I was a
smart-ass white boy who had to
be taught a lesson."
Failure
Tom's experience may be
unique in many aspects, but many
other non-minority residents of
the concentration dorms have
reported a wide range of
treatment from physical violence
to cold stares. Reports in the press
of segregated social functions,
both formal and informal, are all
too familiar to repeat here. The
plain fact is that minority
concentration dorms are a failure
and should be eliminated as
quickly as possible.
