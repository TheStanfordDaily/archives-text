Nixon: Resign
In America, political memories
are short and political consciences
too often lean. Witness Ben
Scheible ("Nixon Not Guilty,"
Daily, May 23). Mr. Scheible
hastens to assure us that Mr.
Nixon could not possibly have
been implicated in the Watergate
Affair, that the President is a man
of sterling character interested
primarily in the unity of the
republic.
Well, the Republic is
floundering rather badly these
days and so is my frayed
confidence in the integrity of
Richard Nixon. This is the same
Richard Nixon, after all, who
grandstanded against Alger Hiss,
smeared Helen Gahagan Douglas,
supported Joseph McCarthy and,
later, Barry Goldwater's
"Extremism in the defense of
liberty is no vice. . ~" the same
Nixon who gave us the bathos of
Checkers and "you won't have
Nixon to kick around anymore,"
and who, more recently,
carpet-bombed to achieve "peace
with honor" and bombs merrily
and madly on to insure the
"cease-fire." And so, is this really
"not the type of man to engage in
any ruthless tactic only to insure
that a landslide victory would be
an even greater landslide
victory."? Before he perishes the
thought, Mr. Scheible might
reread Lord Acton's famous
dictum about power.
Finally, why did it take
"courage and patriotism to say
such trite things as 'God Bless
America?' " Too often, the trite is
simply trite, here the product of
Mr. Nixon's exasperatingly
uninventive mind, a mind
unwilling and unable to grapple
with real issues and so retreating
to the sententious.
Mr. Nixon should resign. If he
is guilty of a Watergate coverup,
that is enough of a "high
misdemeanor in office" to
warrant impeachment. If he is not
guilty, he was frighteningly
stupid, and blind to the
machinations of those aides
whom he appointed and for
whose actions he had at least
some responsibility. In either case,
Mr. Scheible, and we, should be
wary of overestimating his
underhandedness.

Fallacious
Editor:
In his May 23rd article
"Biggest Tennis Battle Looms

Ahead." Viae Kershner
fallaciously states that Stanford's
last NCAA championship was its
1934 track title. However, in
1942 Stanford, coached by
Everett Dean, defeated
Dartmouth by the score of 53-38
to become the NCAA basketball
champions. Howie Dallmar,
leading the victors, was the most
valuable player in the NCAA
tournament that year.
Although we are sure that you
have been deluged by a barrage of
outcries at this injustice to our
fine basketball tradition, we
nonetheless felt compelled to
correct the record.

Disgusting
Editor:
Unfortunately, sexism never
ends. Last Thursday night, at Phi
Kappa Psi Fraternity, a newly
initiated male brother was seized
and subjected to the grossest form
of female chauvinism. Before an
aghast crowd of helpless Phi Psi
brothers, he was raffled off to a
gaggle of drooling, leering,
oversexed females. He was
subsequently locked alone for
fifteeen minutes in an isolated
attic room and forced to commit
inhuman acts with a zealous,
horny Amazon. The young boy,
Duf Sundheim, has not been the
same since. Debbie Stinchfield
screamed in ecstasy as she won
the raffle. Ms. Stinchfield's sinful
and corrupting influence appears
all the more heinous as she hopes
to continue her control over Phi
Psi as an RA next year.
Perhaps most disgusting is the
hypocritical conduct of Beth
Garfield, a self-proclaimed
champion of women's rights and
an ASSU co-president, who
organized the entire
spectacle.Writhing in delight, she
cheered as another innocent lad,
Tom Gidwitz, was forced to
disrobe, dance, and endure the
taunts of her maniacal sexist
cohorts.
The double standard has
existed long enough. It is time for
Stanford males to shed the
shackles of slavery, and overthrow
female oppression. We, the Phi Psi
brothers, vow to spearhead the
drive to give Stanford women
what thev deserve
