# Strange Bedfellows
## English Mix Sex, Politics 
### 
From The Associated Press
Ever since the Duke of
Wellington, victor of Waterloo and
later prime minister, told the top
London call girl of his day to
"publish and be damned," the
British Cabinet has provided an
avid public with some of its
spicier sex scandals.
Those who profess to be
shocked by the goings-on
involving Lords Lambton and
Jellicoe — two peers who resigned
from the government after being
linked to call girls — should have
lived in the good old days when
politicians were really swingers
and the public loved them for it.
Hariette Wilson, the leading
denirep-19th century word for
call girl — told in her headline —
making story of the "Iron
Duke's" return from a victorious
campaign in Spain.
According to Hariette — and
no one has ever denied it —
Wellington, fresh from battle,
pounded on her door after
midnight while she was upstairs
with the Duke of Argyle.
'The Devil'
Argyle, she said, put on one of
her dressing gowns and night caps
and went to the window. A
slanging match started between
the two dukes which ended with
Wellington striding away shouting
"the devil."
From Hariette's point of view,
it all ended happily as Argyle
"swore that, this night at least, he
would be a match for the mighty
Wellington."
Another lover was Lord Byron,
the poet, whose best known affair
was with Lady Caroline Lamb, -
wife of the man who became Lord
Melbourne, prime minister of
England and beloved mentor of
the young Queen Victoria.
Melbourne also made sex :
headlines.
'Criminal Connection'
His trouble began with what,

from all evidence, was a
completely platonic relationship
with Caroline Norton. Her jealous,
politically frustrated husband,
George, did not take this attitude
and in April 1856, charged the
prime minister with "criminal
connection" with his wife.
King William IV said "no"
when asked if Melbourne should
resign. Wellington said he would
refuse to serve in any cabinet
formed as the result of such a
resignation.
Amidst intense public
agitation, came the day of the
trial. Couriers, booted and
spurred, waited to rush the verdict
to every important capital in
Europe. Thousands of curious
milled about outside.
The proceedings lasted 13
hours and the case ended at
midnight with the jury returning a
verdict of innocent without
leaving the box.
Thunderous Applause
There was thunderous applause
in the court and cheers in the
House of Commons.
The next criminal connection
case involved Melbourne's
brother-in-law, another prime
minister, Lord Palmerston.
Palmerston was referred to as
"Lord Cupid" by The Times of
London, and there were frequent
references to his affairs with the
Countess of Jersey and Princess
Lieven, wife of the Russian
ambassador.
It was on the 16th of June,
1863, when Palmerston was 79
and Britain's most popular
politician of the age, that an Irish

journalist named O'Kane brought
suit charging the noble lord had
committed adultery with his wife.
'More Than Ever*
Palmerston's rival, Benjamin
Disraeli, commented "it will make
Palmerston more popular than
ever."
Disraeli was right.
The Earl of Clarendon wrote
Lord Cowley, ambassador to
France, that "in town and
country nothing else was talked of
for days."
Finally, in October, Mrs.
O'Kane claimed she had never
been legally married to the man
who brought the divorce action.
Lord Palmerston submitted an
affidavit saying the suit had been
filed for "motives of extortion"
and it was dismissed.
There were cheers in every gin
palace in London.
Prince of Wales
Newspaper readers had only to
wait a few years for another
scandal in high political circles —
this one involving the Prince of
Wales.
Sir Charles Mordaunt filed for
divorce charging that his wife had
committed adultery with a
number of men including the
prince.
In a scene unprecedented in
English history, the Prince, later
King Edward VII, took the
witness stand on Feb. 23, 1870,
and was asked:
"Has there ever been any
improper familiarity or criminal
act between yourself and Lady
Mordaunt?"
"Never!" he replied.
