I have heard a rumor that the intercoms on the second floor of
Tresidder are two-way. Is this true? F.B.
Gordon Starr, Director of Tresidder, says that the intercoms are
definitely one way.
He said that the only time the intercoms can be used for something
other than broadcasting is if a microphone is hooked up to the
system. What is being said over the mike can be picked up and
broadcast in the other rooms in Tresidder.
Graduate students receive an average stipend of $300 per month.
They pay approximately 50 percent of that in rent if they live in
Escondido Village.
Are there any government figures about how much the average
American family pays for shelter as a percentage of income? Are there
any figures about where the poverty line is, or what classifies a
housing development as a poverty pocket? B.F.
A man from the Bureau of Labor Statistics said that an average
family of four spends about 25 percent of their income on housing.
(High income — $15,905 a year, spends $3,908; middle income —
$10,971, spends $2,638; low income — $7,214, spends $1,516.)
Although as a female student, 1 pay the same tuition as a male, I do
not have equal access to swimming facilities. Free swim" hours at the
small women's pool are practically nonexistant and there are no
facilities (showers, lockers, etc.) for women when they're allowed
(dubious privilege) into the men's pool. Plus, a new men's pool is
being built! What about this?! J.H.
Pamela Strathaim, chairman of the Women's Physical Education
department, said that what is being built is "the new swimming
complex," and not the "new men's pool" because both sexes will be
using it.
According to Strathairn, plans for 1973-74 call for all swimming
classes, except for the varsity teams, to be co-ed. Duplicate classes will
be offered at both the new pool and the present women's pool, which
will be called Lagunita pool. This means that students will be able to
choose the location that is most convenient for them.
I would like to know why the ASSU Student Financial Manager is
paid $3,990 while the whole Council of Presidents receives only
$2,600. (The figures were obtained from the budget reprint in the
Stanford Arena,) G.H.
Karen Rust, ASSU secretary, explained that the ASSU Financial
Manager has a great deal of responsibility and needs special financial
knowledge.
She went on to say that the Financial Manager has a full-time job
in the summer, and that during the school year the Manager and his
assistants "are not just doing little bookkeeping things. They put in a
lot of hours."
