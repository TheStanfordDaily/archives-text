I boxed myself up again in
darkened theaters just to present
to you the third in this limp series
or reviews. Might as well get right
to the good stuff and end this
introduction fast. Just stop
drooling over your newspaper:
your professor might notice.

"BEHIND THE GREEN DOOR"
— This hot flick's been making it
with nearly every theater in town.
For real comfort, go see it at the
O'Farrell. It stars Marilyn
Chambers, whose face appeared
on a box of soap flakes advertised
as "99 and 44/100% pure."
Ben Davidson of the World
Champion Oakland Raiders
Football Team (don't I wish)
starts the movie off with a bang
by popping a football in his bare
hands.
Then things get ethnic with a
greasy spoon cafe cook telling this
joke: "Ever hear about the Italian
hijacker who ordered $2 and 5000
parachutes to be put on the plane
before he released the crew?"
The plot concerns a wealthy
girl who is abducted and taken to
a private club (Davidson is the
bouncer) with the aim of showing
the girl so much beautiful love
that she'll never forget the
experience.
Club members watch her

"ravishment" but are sworn to
secrecy about the whole affair.
Two members take this secrecy
oath so seriously that they tell the
whole story to the cook in a
nearby cafe in exchange for some
Italian jokes.
Marilyn, the abducted one, is
beautiful, but awfully slow: it
takes her six female body
masseuses, one black "plumber"
(just like Watergate, to check the
pipes), and 40 minutes to reach
climax. The jazzy background
organ music picks up tempo with
the plumber's increasingly active
efforts to unclog the pipe.
Then a trapeze arrangement
swings down, and she waits hand
and mouth on three guys while a
fourth is seeing to her needs. The
club members — cum — spectators
get so turned on by this act that
they undress and get it on as well.
The entire scene is climaxed by
ultra slow motion photography,
double images, and colored filters:
great special effects. You could
call "Green Door" the "2001 of
Porno."

"NO TITLE" - Bored stiff is too
good a comment for this
not-so-short short with "Green
Door;" bored limp is closer. The
film concerns a S.F. prostitute
who hates the trade and wants to
get out. Most of the footage is

shot in the park and reveals the
intricacies of a frisbee game.
This unhappy girl meets Chuck
in the park and falls in love. But
at night she must leave him to pay
her pimp by plying her trade. The
movie tried to show the difference
between love and sex .. . nice try:
the only difference I could see
va5 that in love they screamed
harder.
The few camera shots of lawn
sprinklers and old men playing
cirds in the park were a nice relief
from the female lead's constant
monotonous diet of ground
Chuck meat. The movie's
highlight was the total loss of the
soundtrack, three times in 15
minutes.

"THE SEX GIFT" - Ever
thought how easy it would be to
take the normal porn film's
illiterate dialogue and make it
corny, truly funny, or the like?
Well, this film tried just that and
it's dialogue is worse than most.
The setting is Winter in Aspen,
Colorado, and during most of the
love scenes cute little furry
squirrels and bunnies steal most of
the stage with their playful antics.
No joke: while a couple goes at it
on a snowbank in the forest,
animals from all around pop out
of their burrows to get a look.
The plot action involves two

girls who hire a detective to look
for their missing father who's out
bugging all the snow queens in
town. Even the detective gets it in
the end.
"FU VK OR FLUCK" - Billy's
got i cademic troubles: he's failing
in Math and History. But Billy's
girl helps bail him out by seducing
all his teachers — and in a house
hidd m in the Oakland hills only
five minutes away from my own!
While the History teach and
the girl are making out on a
waterbed, Billy's right outside
making up his final exam.
Everybody gets made, even the
bed. In the final scene, Billy tells
his girl about an imminent F in
Art class. If she could only
'persuade' his art teacher things
would be all right; problem is, the
teacher is 55, grey, fat, and a
woman. The film leaves you
pondering . . . why you watched it
at all.

sprinklers and old men playing
cirds in the park were a nice relief
from the female lead's constant
monotonous diet of ground
Chuck meat. The movie's
highlight was the total loss of the
soundtrack, three times in 15
minutes.

"THE SEX GIFT" - Ever
thought how easy it would be to
take the normal porn film's
illiterate dialogue and make it
corny, truly funny, or the like?
Well, this film tried just that and
it's dialogue is worse than most.
The setting is Winter in Aspen,
Colorado, and during most of the
love scenes cute little furry
squirrels and bunnies steal most of
the stage with their playful antics.
No joke: while a couple goes at it
on a snowbank in the forest,
animals from all around pop out
of their burrows to get a look.
The plot action involves two

girls who hire a detective to look
for their missing father who's out
bugging all the snow queens in
town. Even the detective gets it in
the end.
"FU VK OR FLUCK" - Billy's
got i cademic troubles: he's failing
in Math and History. But Billy's
girl helps bail him out by seducing
all his teachers — and in a house
hidd m in the Oakland hills only
five minutes away from my own!
While the History teach and
the girl are making out on a
waterbed, Billy's right outside
making up his final exam.
Everybody gets made, even the
bed. In the final scene, Billy tells
his girl about an imminent F in
Art class. If she could only
'persuade' his art teacher things
would be all right; problem is, the
teacher is 55, grey, fat, and a
woman. The film leaves you
pondering . . . why you watched it
at all.

I boxed myself up again in
darkened theaters just to present
to you the third in this limp series
or reviews. Might as well get right
to the good stuff and end this
introduction fast. Just stop
drooling over your newspaper:
your professor might notice.

"BEHIND THE GREEN DOOR"
— This hot flick's been making it
with nearly every theater in town.
For real comfort, go see it at the
O'Farrell. It stars Marilyn
Chambers, whose face appeared
on a box of soap flakes advertised
as "99 and 44/100% pure."
Ben Davidson of the World
Champion Oakland Raiders
Football Team (don't I wish)
starts the movie off with a bang
by popping a football in his bare
hands.
Then things get ethnic with a
greasy spoon cafe cook telling this
joke: "Ever hear about the Italian
hijacker who ordered $2 and 5000
parachutes to be put on the plane
before he released the crew?"
The plot concerns a wealthy
girl who is abducted and taken to
a private club (Davidson is the
bouncer) with the aim of showing
the girl so much beautiful love
that she'll never forget the
experience.
Club members watch her

"ravishment" but are sworn to
secrecy about the whole affair.
Two members take this secrecy
oath so seriously that they tell the
whole story to the cook in a
nearby cafe in exchange for some
Italian jokes.
Marilyn, the abducted one, is
beautiful, but awfully slow: it
takes her six female body
masseuses, one black "plumber"
(just like Watergate, to check the
pipes), and 40 minutes to reach
climax. The jazzy background
organ music picks up tempo with
the plumber's increasingly active
efforts to unclog the pipe.
Then a trapeze arrangement
swings down, and she waits hand
and mouth on three guys while a
fourth is seeing to her needs. The
club members — cum — spectators
get so turned on by this act that
they undress and get it on as well.
The entire scene is climaxed by
ultra slow motion photography,
double images, and colored filters:
great special effects. You could
call "Green Door" the "2001 of
Porno."

"NO TITLE" - Bored stiff is too
good a comment for this
not-so-short short with "Green
Door;" bored limp is closer. The
film concerns a S.F. prostitute
who hates the trade and wants to
get out. Most of the footage is

shot in the park and reveals the
intricacies of a frisbee game.
This unhappy girl meets Chuck
in the park and falls in love. But
at night she must leave him to pay
her pimp by plying her trade. The
movie tried to show the difference
between love and sex .. . nice try:
the only difference I could see
va5 that in love they screamed
harder.

bouncer) with the aim of showing
the girl so much beautiful love
that she'll never forget the
experience.
Club members watch her

"ravishment" but are sworn to
secrecy about the whole affair.
Two members take this secrecy
oath so seriously that they tell the
whole story to the cook in a
nearby cafe in exchange for some
Italian jokes.
Marilyn, the abducted one, is
beautiful, but awfully slow: it
takes her six female body
masseuses, one black "plumber"
(just like Watergate, to check the
pipes), and 40 minutes to reach
climax. The jazzy background
organ music picks up tempo with
the plumber's increasingly active
efforts to unclog the pipe.
Then a trapeze arrangement
swings down, and she waits hand
and mouth on three guys while a
fourth is seeing to her needs. The
club members — cum — spectators
get so turned on by this act that
they undress and get it on as well.
The entire scene is climaxed by
ultra slow motion photography,
double images, and colored filters:
great special effects. You could
call "Green Door" the "2001 of
Porno."

"NO TITLE" - Bored stiff is too
good a comment for this
not-so-short short with "Green
Door;" bored limp is closer. The
film concerns a S.F. prostitute
who hates the trade and wants to
get out. Most of the footage is

shot in the park and reveals the
intricacies of a frisbee game.
This unhappy girl meets Chuck
in the park and falls in love. But
at night she must leave him to pay
her pimp by plying her trade. The
movie tried to show the difference
between love and sex .. . nice try:
the only difference I could see
va5 that in love they screamed
harder.
The few camera shots of lawn
sprinklers and old men playing
cirds in the park were a nice relief
from the female lead's constant
monotonous diet of ground
Chuck meat. The movie's
highlight was the total loss of the
soundtrack, three times in 15
minutes.

"THE SEX GIFT" - Ever
thought how easy it would be to
take the normal porn film's
illiterate dialogue and make it
corny, truly funny, or the like?
Well, this film tried just that and
it's dialogue is worse than most.
The setting is Winter in Aspen,
Colorado, and during most of the
love scenes cute little furry
squirrels and bunnies steal most of
the stage with their playful antics.
No joke: while a couple goes at it
on a snowbank in the forest,
animals from all around pop out
of their burrows to get a look.
The plot action involves two

girls who hire a detective to look
for their missing father who's out
bugging all the snow queens in
town. Even the detective gets it in
the end.
"FU VK OR FLUCK" - Billy's
got i cademic troubles: he's failing
in Math and History. But Billy's
girl helps bail him out by seducing
all his teachers — and in a house
hidd m in the Oakland hills only
five minutes away from my own!
While the History teach and
the girl are making out on a
waterbed, Billy's right outside
making up his final exam.
Everybody gets made, even the
bed. In the final scene, Billy tells
his girl about an imminent F in
Art class. If she could only
'persuade' his art teacher things
would be all right; problem is, the
teacher is 55, grey, fat, and a
woman. The film leaves you
pondering . . . why you watched it
at all.
