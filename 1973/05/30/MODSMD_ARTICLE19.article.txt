# Dramatic Conflict Lacking In Robert Wise's 'Two People'
## 
### ROBERT SHERWOOD 
TWO PEOPLE
Directed by Robert Wise
Screenplay by Richard De√üoy
"Two People," starring Peter
Fonda and newcomer Lindsay
Wagner, might have been a fine
love story. An unwillingness to
alter or improve the insipid
dialogue leaves the two
performers with rather flat,
uninteresting characters. Fonda is
an Army deserter who meets up
with a high fashion model (Miss
Wagner) in Marrakesh. They are
both enroute via Paris to New
York; he to face court martial, she
to see her four-year-old
illegitimate child.
During the long exposition of
their getting acquainted on the
train ride to Casablanca, there is
no hint that the characters are
interesting enough to think about.
He is the ethical son of a judge
and never had any questions until
reaching the battlefield in
Vietnam. She is from
Steubensville, Ohio, the daughter
of a coal miner and intimates that
she has made it to the top at the
cost of her morals.
The picture does not really
begin until it's two thirds over,

when the two arrive in Paris and
decide to come to terms with
their mutual attraction. Their
lovemaking is convincing, after
which Miss Wagner pleads they go
somewhere and live together. But
Fonda is adamant; he is tired of
running and "wants his life back."
Auspicious Beginning
Lindsay Wagner bears a great
likeness to Katherine Ross and
shows considerable talent in "Two
People," her first screen role.
Fonda is similarly well-case as
today's conscientious,
war-objecting youth. In the film
he has been in voluntary exile for
three years and is finally tiring of
being on the run. At first Miss
Wagner is angry at the calmness he
shows in the face of a possible
five-year prison sentence.
Without the authentic location
shooting in Morocco, Paris and
New York, "Two People" would
never have gotten off the ground.
As it is, these foreign locations
work well to vitalize the film.
The opening shots of the
Casbah of Marrakesh are colorful
and absorbing, as well as the shots
of Moroccan landscape from the
train. Paris is shot at night, from
the busy Place de la Concorde to

the interior of a chic night club.
French cinematographer Henri
Ducae is credited with the
photography.
Good Moments
Despite its lack of any real
conflict or drama, there are some
good moments in "Two People."
My favorite occurs when a fidgety
Miss Wagner goes into the
third-class car of the train to buy
some hashish. Almost
immediately she is surrounded by
a horde of young Moroccans all
offering her the best price.
Another happens after they
make love in Paris when Fonda
asks her if she wants a cup of
coffee. She makes about four
different replies at once, an
obvious indication of her present
state of mind.
Robert Wise produced and
directed this well-intentioned love
story. Richard De Roy's
screenplay fails to provide any
significant depth to the chracters,
and the inevitability of their
becoming lovers forfeits any
dramatic conflict or tension in the
film. The simplicity of the film's
title unfortunately parallels the
simplicity of the movie itself.
