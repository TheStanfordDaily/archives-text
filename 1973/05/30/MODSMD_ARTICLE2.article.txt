# San Francisco Sheriff Criticizes Jail System
## 
### CHESS ERWIN 
"We haven't gotten anywhere with
the jail system in San Francisco since
1889," said San Francisco Sheriff
Richard Hongisto last night at the
opening of the Third Annual
Conference on Prisons, sponsored by
the Prison Information Center.
Speaking before an audience of 75
people, Hongisto said that the problem
of prisons and prison reform is not a
new one. "Prison reform has been
around as long as there have been
prisons."
Expressing his own views on the
criminal justice system, Hongisto said,
"I am a reformer. My plan for reform
of the jails is very simple" he said. "We
must think in terms of achievable
goals. In order to ease the
overcrowding in the jails we ought to
get the people who have committed
victimless crimes out of jail.
"By victimless criminals, I mean
people such as habitual drunks,
prostitutes, junkies, and
marijuana-related offenders. If those
people were removed from the San
Francisco jail, the population there
would be reduced by at least 30
percent," Hongisto stated.
According to Hongisto, there are
numerous long term obstacles to
prison reform. "For one thing, the
county is tied up in the status quo of
the jail system. Many people in
government still believe that there are
groups of good guys and bad guys in
our society. In fact, many people still
hold to the idea of dangerous classes in
the society, too.
Power System At Fault
"It is the distribution of power in
our society through money, political
influence, and in other means that
perpetuates the fact that powerless
people in society, such as minorities
and the young go to jail."
Jails are low visibility institutions,

Hongisto continued. "The only time
that there is a push for jail reform is
when white people get thrown in
them." As an example of this
phenomenon, Hongisto cited the
uproar that happened in Berkeley after
some of the early demonstrations.
There is also the problem of
governmental resistance to jail reform
in general, added Hongisto. "Every
move to change who goes to jail or to
reduce jail populations is resisted,"
noted Hongisto.
Low Priority
"Governments have certain
priorities and in San Francisco, the jail
is not a very high priority item. After
meeting all their commitments, there
is very little money left for the
operation of the jail. In my case, the
City Council spent more time
worrying about dog shit than they did
about the jail," Hongisto said.
The budget for the San Francisco
Sheriff's department was $4 million
out of a total city budget of $830

PRISON REFORM? — The participants in last evening's opening session of the Conference on Prisons at Cubberley
Auditorium discussed the problems and possibilities for prison reform. S.F. Sheriff Richard Hongisto (right) was critical

Committee on Penal Reform explained the problems of penal reform legislation.
million last year. "The jail got only
$2'A [million] out of that $4 million
last year," explained Hongisto.
Hongisto was also highly critical of
the current San Francisco Grand Jury.
Calling it a "political club,"he noted
that the foreman of the Grand Jury
was the son-in-law of a San Francisco
judge.
"I must do whatever I can to
support the people who are seeking to
change the prison system," he
concluded.
Other Speakers »
Among the other speakers was San
Francisco State Prof. John Irwin.
Irwin directed his remarks towards
alternatives to the present prison
system saying that "I'm frightened at
the proposals that have been suggested
by conservatives, liberals, and radicals
alike . .He also emphasized the
importance of colleges in working to

establish alternatives to
institutionalization.
Jerry Haleva, the chief consultant
to the California Assembly Select
Committee on Penal Reform spoke on
the difficulties of prison reform
legislation. The principal obstacles to
reform, he said, are "the committee
process in the legislature and Governor
Ronald Reagan."
The Conference on Prisons will
continue tonight in Cubberley
Auditorium and tomorrow night in
room 214 of the History department.
Featured speakers this evening will be
Minnesota Prof. Tom Murton, former
superintendent of the Arkansas prison
system, and Phyllis Jo Baunach, a
consultant on prisons for the U.S.
Dept. of Labor.
Tomorrow, a slide and tape
program on the Stanford Prison
Experiment will be shown. Starting
time both nights is 7:30 p.m.

"We haven't gotten anywhere with
the jail system in San Francisco since
1889," said San Francisco Sheriff
Richard Hongisto last night at the
opening of the Third Annual
Conference on Prisons, sponsored by
the Prison Information Center.
Speaking before an audience of 75
people, Hongisto said that the problem
of prisons and prison reform is not a
new one. "Prison reform has been
around as long as there have been
prisons."
Expressing his own views on the
criminal justice system, Hongisto said,
"I am a reformer. My plan for reform
of the jails is very simple" he said. "We
must think in terms of achievable
goals. In order to ease the
overcrowding in the jails we ought to
get the people who have committed
victimless crimes out of jail.
"By victimless criminals, I mean
people such as habitual drunks,
prostitutes, junkies, and
marijuana-related offenders. If those
people were removed from the San
Francisco jail, the population there
would be reduced by at least 30
percent," Hongisto stated.
According to Hongisto, there are
numerous long term obstacles to
prison reform. "For one thing, the
county is tied up in the status quo of
the jail system. Many people in
government still believe that there are
groups of good guys and bad guys in
our society. In fact, many people still
hold to the idea of dangerous classes in
the society, too.
Power System At Fault
"It is the distribution of power in
our society through money, political
influence, and in other means that
perpetuates the fact that powerless
people in society, such as minorities
and the young go to jail."
Jails are low visibility institutions,

Hongisto continued. "The only time
that there is a push for jail reform is
when white people get thrown in
them." As an example of this
phenomenon, Hongisto cited the
uproar that happened in Berkeley after
some of the early demonstrations.
There is also the problem of
governmental resistance to jail reform
in general, added Hongisto. "Every
move to change who goes to jail or to
reduce jail populations is resisted,"
noted Hongisto.
Low Priority
"Governments have certain
priorities and in San Francisco, the jail
is not a very high priority item. After
meeting all their commitments, there
is very little money left for the
operation of the jail. In my case, the
City Council spent more time
worrying about dog shit than they did
about the jail," Hongisto said.
The budget for the San Francisco
Sheriff's department was $4 million
out of a total city budget of $830

PRISON REFORM? — The participants in last evening's opening session of the Conference on Prisons at Cubberley
Auditorium discussed the problems and possibilities for prison reform. S.F. Sheriff Richard Hongisto (right) was critical

million last year. "The jail got only
$2'A [million] out of that $4 million
last year," explained Hongisto.
Hongisto was also highly critical of
the current San Francisco Grand Jury.
Calling it a "political club,"he noted
that the foreman of the Grand Jury
was the son-in-law of a San Francisco
judge.
"I must do whatever I can to
support the people who are seeking to
change the prison system," he
concluded.
Other Speakers »
Among the other speakers was San
Francisco State Prof. John Irwin.
Irwin directed his remarks towards
alternatives to the present prison
system saying that "I'm frightened at
the proposals that have been suggested
by conservatives, liberals, and radicals
alike . .He also emphasized the
importance of colleges in working to

establish alternatives to
institutionalization.
Jerry Haleva, the chief consultant
to the California Assembly Select
Committee on Penal Reform spoke on
the difficulties of prison reform
legislation. The principal obstacles to
reform, he said, are "the committee
process in the legislature and Governor
Ronald Reagan."
The Conference on Prisons will
continue tonight in Cubberley
Auditorium and tomorrow night in
room 214 of the History department.
Featured speakers this evening will be
Minnesota Prof. Tom Murton, former
superintendent of the Arkansas prison
system, and Phyllis Jo Baunach, a
consultant on prisons for the U.S.
Dept. of Labor.
