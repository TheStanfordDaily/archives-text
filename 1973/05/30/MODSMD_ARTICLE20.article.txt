# Johnny Winter's Only Human
## 
### RAY STEN 
After an absence of two years,
albino guitar idol Johnny Winter
returned to San Francisco and
played to a wildly expectant
Saturday night Winterland
audience. However, to totally
fulfill the anticipations of his fans,
many of whom had never had the
opportunity to see him in concert,
would have required an almost
superhuman performance. Winter
nearly delivered.
Winter freaks began arriving at
the arena at 6 a.m. and, as if an
all-day wait wasn't enough to
ensure an appreciative crowd, two
hard rocking warm up bands were
included on the bill.
First up was Frampton's
Camel, an English group run by
Peter Frampton, the former lead
guitarist from Humble Pie who
resigned after a personality clash
with the Pie's lead singer.
Frampton is blessed with very
rapid fingers and his gymnastic
style excited the eager crowd but
apparently no one in the group is
capable of composing a
noteworthy tune.
With the exception of a paltry
rendition of "Jumpin' Jack Flash"
all their material was new and
unless they procure a new
songwriter, they will have
difficulty rising above third bill
status.
Quality Style
Appearing next was Foghat,
another English band that features
Lonesome Dave Peverett (lead
guitar and vocals), Tony Stevens
(bass), Roger Earl (drums), all
formerly of Savoy Brown, and
Rod Price (slide guitar). Their
unpretentious but high quality
style of straight-ahead rock was
perhaps best exemplified by the
old Savoy Brown classic "Leavin'
Again" which was highlighted by
incredibly nimble and fast bass

work by Stevens.
The greatest crowd response
was for their hit single, the Willie
Dixon standard "I Just Want To
Make Love To You" during which
Lonesome Dave exhibited some
flashy guitar licks and Price
showed his competence with the
slide. Formed about a year ago
and becoming increasingly
popular, Foghat was an excellent
foil for the main attraction.
Winter took the stage atop a
pair of five inch platform shoes
and launched immediately into an
intense and electric performance
of his "Rock Me Baby" that was
characterized by liberal use of
short feedback. That song seemed
to set the mood for most of the
evening as Johnny continued to
play exceedingly heavy tunes that
were dominated by his lightning
fast, shrill guitar.
Inferior Drummers
Joining Winter were bassist
Randy Hobbs and two drummers,
neither of whom did the work of
one-half of a good drummer. Also
on stage was a blitzed female
whose only apparent function was
to be the subject of lascivious
actions by the guitarist.

A compact one hour set gave
Winter ample opportunity to
prove that the hand is quicker
than the eye as his fingers blurred
while moving the length of the
neck and back, leaving only one's
ears to be certain that he had
really done it.
Very few flamenco guitarists,
I'm sure, can spray out a flurry of
notes as fast as Johnny. In the
past he has been criticized for
giving a blistering riff and then
finding himself with nowhere to
go, but now he is in total control,
knowing where he has been and
precisely where he is going.
Winter made his name as a
blues guitarist but Saturday's
show had a lamentable shortage of
genuine blues. A couple of
perverted shuffle-type blues had
Johnny playing slide in a manner
that Duane Allman could have
admired but unfortunately his l
hoarse vocals couldn't stay above
the volume of the music.
Slick Improvisation
The only slow blues done was
"Too Much Seconal" from his
new album. He made time stand
still with his slick improvisation
and I only wish that there had

been more.
The crowd demanded, and got,
three encores. During these
Johnny reverted somewhat to his
rock 'n' roll and blues heritage,
playing the inevitable "Johnny B.
Goode" and an almost
indistinguishable heavy version of
"Crossroads" that suffered badly
from the Cream comparison. The
show was closed with very tough
treatment of "Roll Over
Beethoven" which followed an
uninspired "Let It Bleed."
Audience response throughout
the concert was enthusiastic but
there was the feeling that people
were not completely satisfied.
They came to see a deity and it
would have been impossible for
any mortal to meet those
standards. But Johnny Winter
came as close as one could.
