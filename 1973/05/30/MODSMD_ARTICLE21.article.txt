# The
						Natural Affiliation Of Bill Parker
## Arborist Maintains Ties With Land 
### 
If there ever was a natural affiliation
between inan and land, it has to be
between University Arborist Bill Parker
and all the trees on 8600 acres of the
Stanford campus.
He suffers whenever one of the old
timers has to be cut down to make way for
a new building or a new road and, in
general, he fears for the future of the
Arboretum itself.
It's a feeling that goes' way back to his
boyhood on a ranch in the Arbuckle
Mountains of northern Oklahoma. His
Elizabethan contours indicate his heritage,
which he traces back to Irish, English, and
Indian forefathers.
Just in the !ast few years, a fine stand of
American beech, Canary Island pine, four
big elms, and a monkey-puzzle tree have
crashed down to make way for changes in
one form or another.
Some ancient sycamores in front of
Stillman House will have to go to make
way for removal of the house in deference
to a new routing of Campus Drive.
Parker's concern for the campus tree
population is well merited. The
Arboretum, which encompasses the

campus area roughly between Serra St.and
the edge of the Stanford Shopping Center
along El Camino Real, predates the
University itself.
Virtually all of the 1500-acre main
campus was once designated by Senator
Stanford as a place where samples of every
tree in the world "that will grow in this
climate" were to be planted.
Some were cut down to make way for
the University itself after Leland Jr.'s
death, Parker has found.
The plantings range from dawn
redwoods brought Irom Hopei, China, to
native plants and shrubs encouraged by the
Stanford's landscape architect, the famed
Frederick Law Olmsted.
The campus' massive growth of
eucalypti has a significant place in Stanford
history, Parker emphasizes.
The sturdy Australian native "blue
gums," fastgrowing and nearly impervious
to every pest and lbith, were originally
planted to screen the younger and more
vulnerable plants and other varieties ol
shrubs.
Through a series of complications,
mostly financial, dating back to President

Ray Lyman Wilbur's administration, the
"ecus" were not thinned out as originally
planned so that they have survived when
other plantings did not.
Since Parker joined the Plant Services
staff in 1966 — he used to manage the San
Francisco YWCA Camp in Jones Gulch
near La Honda — he has seen the campus
become much more aware of the ecological
crisis and the need for preservation of both
the University's history and its open space.
"The department's whole philosophy
has changed and the grounds staff, in
particular, is very concerned about
making each dollar go as far as it can to
preserve the appearance and beauty of the
campus," he said.
An outdoorsman all his life, Parker has
lived with the Pawnee Indians and once
attended Ozark Industrial College in
Arkansas. This was education frontier
style, he remembers, in which the school
plant was made from hand-hewn logs,
where students raised their own food and
were largely self-sufficient.
"We studied applied biology," he notes
with a chuckle.
He is pleased with the results of two

recent Sunday tree walks sponsored by
Plant Services.
"We opened the eyes of a lot of people
who have worked here for years without
knowing much about the landscaping," he
said.
With the help of donations from Pacific
Nurseries, Plant Services has planted many
new ornamentals and even though "we had
a severe winter," he points out, "we only
lost two out of 70 varieties of the
ornamental eucalyptus."
Bill favors Australian plants for this
climate because they resist everything,
including occasional droughts that have
lasted as long as two consecutive years.
He estimates it will take many
thousands of dollars to bring the
arboretum into the shape he feels it should
be, including an extensive irrigation system
so that plants and trees can be watered and
cared for regularly.
"The Arboretum has got to be kept free
of buildings, or our grandchildren will
suffer," Parker affirms. "It's our last
chance for lots of trees and open area, in
this part of the Peninsula at least."
