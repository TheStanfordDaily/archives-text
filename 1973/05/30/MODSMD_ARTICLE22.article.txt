## Stanford Athletics Stay Clean 
### Charlie Hoffman 
The increasing professionalism of sports has
polluted college sports programs to the point where
they exemplify few of the ideals that institutes of
higher education hold so dear.
The NCAA is constantly uncovering athletic
slush funds and exposing college athletic officials
who have tampered with athletes' grades and test
scores. A certain amount of corruption is being
accepted as the norm at many universities with
strong athletic programs.
Where does Stanford fit into all of this? The
athletic program here Is not 100 percent pure, but is
remarkably ethical.
Stanford has the only athletic director in the
Pacific Eight who advocates athletic scholarships
based on need. Joe Ruetz put this proposal before
the NCAA Convention in January of this year and it
was voted down by over a 2-1 margin. Athletic
directors refuse to create rules that would prevent
them from building an athletic dynasty in an
"open" and "competitive" system.
Coaches are looking for the best athletes, but the
best athletes are not necessarily the best students
and Stanford coaches labor under that distinction.
Unlike many schools, coaches here cannot secure
admission for all the athletes they want, and they
are limited in their searches for high school athletes
to those with B averages. Everyone knows that there
are some incredibly easy courses here if one looks
hard enough, but athletes have to get through
Stanford just like the rest of us and there is no great
conspiracy to sneak them through.
The condition severely limits coaches here.
Schools like Nebraska and Oklahoma can give out
160 football scholarships (Stanford hands out
around 80) and preserve their athletes' eligibility

any number of ways. That is how they can get the
amount of meat necessary to run the Wishbone-T.
Stanford has some hunks of meat too, but they
are few in number and usually come out of junior
colleges and wind up hanging around the gym
year-round. The vast majority of Stanford athletes,
however, are people who can compete with students
here in the classroom and with Michigan-type
players on the field. What our players lack in skill,
they make up for in intelligence and desire.
It is surprising that Stanford can be competitive
in athletics, given the athletically restricting rules
that our athletic department operates under.
Athletic officials here realize that they have to
project an image consistent with Stanford
University, and that shady financial deals and
tampering with transcripts.
The athletic program here effects probably the
best combination of two goals that sadly seem to
conflict: winning and the total welfare of the
student athlete.
There are a few practices our athletic department
engages in which conflict with Stanford's ideal,
however. Red-shirting keeps an athlete at school for
five years in an institution with a four year program.
This unconsistency should be resolved. Also,'
athletic scholarships should be given according to
need just like all other scholarships at Stanford.
There are also small injustices committed in pursuit
of victory. Overzealousness in the line of duty is not
restricted to the highest levels of government.
On the whole, however, our athletic program has
remained a good and honest representative of
Stanford. In these days where professionalism has
seeped down to little league, we can be thankful of
that.
