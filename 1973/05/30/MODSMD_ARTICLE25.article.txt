# Youngest Mountain View Champ
## Stanford Recruit Wins Tennis Crown 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Stanford recruit Nick Saviano
recorded one of the greatest
victories in his tennis career as he
won the Mountain View Tennis
Tournament Monday.
Saviano shocked Stanford's
John Whitlinger, 6-4, 6-4 in a
semifinal Sunday. But even this
impressive win paled compared to
the Gunn High School southpaw's
championship win Monday over
Dick Bohrnstedt.
Bohrnstedt, a former USC
player from Redlands, fell to
Saviano 6-0, 3-6, 6-3 Monday in
the finals of the tournament.
Thus, Saviano becomes the
youngest player in history to win
the Mountain View title. He will
be 18 next week.
In doubles play, Stanford's
team of Whitlinger and Jim
Delaney won the Mountain View

crown, downing the
Stanford-based team of John
Wright and Chico Hagey 6-1, 6-3
in the finals.
Delaney had also been
first-seeded in the singles

competition, but was
unexpectedly knocked out by
Whitlinger Saturday.
Two other Stanford doubles
teams, Mark Mitchell-Paul Sidone
and Craig Johnson-Jake Warde,

had been knocked out of the
competition in the quarter-finals.
Warde-Johnson lost their
quarterfinal match to
Delaney-Whitlinger, 6-2, 6-2. As
was the case in the California
State Championships earlier this
year, there were so many good
Stanford players in the
tournament that several knocked
each other out.
Meanwhile, in the Tulsa
Invitational Tennis Tournament
Friday, Stanford's Pat DuPre
scored a major upset by downing
Bob McKinley, the 15th ranked
player in the U.S., 6-2, 4-6, 7-5.
DuPre lost the next day,
however, 6-4, 6-1 to Alex Olmedo
of Los Angeles, but reached the
finals in doubles play.
Tonight, the team will be
honored at the fifth annual
"Stanford Tennis Recognition
Night Banquet," at Ming's
Restaurant in Palo Alto, beginning
