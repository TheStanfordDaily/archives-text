While House Used 'Secret Agents'
WASHINGTON — A White House plan to use secret
agents to spy on American radicals was ostensibly
canceled, then carried out later by an
interdepartmental undercover team inside the
government, sources close to the Watergate
investigation said yesterday.
Two sources, one of whom said he had seen the
plan, confirmed it was the text of that plan that
ousted White House Counsel John W. Dean 111
locked in a safe-deposit box and later turned over to
a federal judge. The text, classified "Top secret,"
has not been made public.
Asked to comment on the report, White House
Deputy Press Secretary Gerald Warren would not go
beyond a lengthy statement in which President
Nixon last week discussed the Watergate scandal.
Nixon at that time referred to a
domestic-intelligence plan that he said was
withdrawn without being implemented in July 1970
after FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover objected to the
proposal.
The following December, however, an
Intelligence Evaluation Committee was established
"to improve coordination among the intelligence
community and to prepare evaluations and
estimates of domestic intelligence," Nixon said.
The sources said they couldn't confirm whether
or how long the group performed that function. But
it soon became "a cover for a secret police
operation," the sources said.
They said the unit had access to "virtually all
agencies of government" and used that access to
intercept mail, tap telephones, audit income-tax
returns and plant informers.
"They were using the national-security plan that
Hoover objected to," one source said. "That was the
blueprint. They had copies of it and apparently
understood their actions were authorized.
"It was just like Watergate," the source said.
The burglars who broke into Democratic
headquarters in the Watergate have testified they
believed the operation had been approved by Nixon
or his top officials and therefore was legal.
Nixon Refuses To Testify
WASHINGTON — The Watergate investigators,
judicial and congressional, will get no testimony
from President Nixon, the White House said
yesterday.
"We feel it would be constitutionally
inappropriate," said press secretary Ronald L.
Ziegler. "It would do violence to the separation of
powers."
Ziegler said the ban applies to sworn testimony,
informal statements and written responses to
written questions.
The questions arose again after a story in the
Washington Post quoted federal prosecutors as
telling Justice Department superiors "there is
justification for calling" the President before the
federal grand jury.
Ziegler called the story "a shocking and
irresponsible abuse of authority on the part of the
federal prosecutors" if it is true. Ziegler said the

White House has ordered an investigation of what he
termed a leak of information dealing with a grand
jury investigation.
Nothing in the Constitution grants immunity to a
President. He may be summoned to court and is
liable to arrest.
Thomas Jefferson established a precedent in
refusing to appear as a witness in 1807 at the
treason trial of Aaron Burr, but the action did not
bind future Presidents.
Asked about a possible presidential appearance
before the Senate Watergate committee, Ziegler
said: "There's no consideration being given that at
all."
Later, Cox issued a statement that:
"The U.S. attorney and his aides have been
instructed to refrain from any kind of statement,
comment, or speculation about any aspect of the
investigation. All officials in the Department of
Justice will be so instructed. No previous statement
or comment about any aspect of the investigation
has been authorized by me."
New Viet Peace Pact Hinted
SAIGON — Henry A. Kissinger and Hanoi's Le Due
Tho have agreed to a new peace plan that calls for
Saigon and Viet Cong forces to stop shooting but
apparently makes no proposal for ending the war in
Cambodia, government sources said yesterday.
South Vietnam has given its approval in principle
to the new accord, Saigon sources reported, but has
asked for some unspecified modifications.
Canada announced in Ottawa that it will
withdraw its peacekeepers from the International
Commission of Control and Supervision, charged
with supervising the cease-fire.
It was not immediately clear what effect the
Canadian pullout would have on the reported
Kissinger-Tho agreement, though the Canadians said
they were giving the 69-day notice in an effort to
remain on hand for the first days of the new pact's
application.
The plan provides for an immediate halt to all
American reconnaissance flights over North
Vietnam and an end within 24 hours to hostilities
between Saigon government forces and the Viet
Cong.
Kissinger has emphasized he intends to conclude
the agreement with Tho at their next round of talks
beginning June 6 in Paris.
Gas Tax Hike Possible
WASHINGTON — The Nixon administration will
decide "in the very near future" whether to increase
the federal tax on gasoline, the administration's top
spokesman on oil said yesterday.
William E. Simon declined to say how much of
an increase was being contemplated, but other
sources said it could be from one to 10 cents per
gallon above the present tax of four cents.
Simon, who is Deputy Secretary of the Treasury
and chairman of the Oil Policy Committee, said one
purpose in raising the tax would be to reduce
demand by making gasoline more expensive.
He said it also may be warranted because of
environmental factors and its impact on government

revenues.
He said a one-cent increase in the gasoline tax
would increase revenues by $1 billion.
An argument against an increase in the gasoline
tax, Simon said, is that it would be regressive,
meaning the impact wo;iid fall most on low-income
persons.
Secretary of the Tr asuiy George P. Shultz said a
gasoline tax increase is "on? of the many things we
are reviewing all the time."
Berkeley Pol Law Voided
OAKLAND — A jut ge in ed the controversial
Berkeley Marijuana I li ;iative void and
unconstitutional yesteiday a' ter almost two hours
of legal arguments.
Alameda County Superior Court Judge Lionel J.
Wilson ordered the Berkeley city manager and the
nine-member City Council to "refrain and desist"
from ordering the police department to stop making
marijuana arrests in Berkeley.
Wilson made permanent a temporary order he
issued May 3 on a petition from state Atty. Gen.
Evelle J. Younger and Alameda County Dist. Atty.
Lowell Jensen. The petition contended there was
"reasonable cause to believe" that the Berkeley city
ordinance conflicts with state law because it
requires prior council approval for police to make
marijuana arrests.
Berkeley voters had passed the initiative April
17.
Court: Ideological Ad Ban OK
WASHINGTON — Radio and television stations may
flatly refuse to sell commercial time for statements
on public issues, a divided Supreme Court held
yesterday.
The court voted 7-2 to reverse a circuit court
that ruled a flat ban on paid public issue
announcements violated the First Amendment if
other kind of paid announcements were accepted.
The Justices, however, differed more widely on
just why the lower court was in error. The decision
left open the possibility that some type of
guaranteed access to the air waves could win
support from the high court.
Two justices, William O. Douglas and Potter
Stewart, decided that the First Amendment
prohibited, rather than required, any
government-mandated access.
The remainder who made up the majority, Chief
Justice Warren E. Burger, and Justices Byron R.
White, Harry Blackmun, Lewis F. Powell Jr. and
William H. Rehnquist did not go that far.
Dissenting were Justices William J. Brennan and
Thurgood Marshall. Brennan said the majority's
decision would inhibit robust debate of public
issues.
