# ASSU Senate Delays Vote On SJC Charter
## 
### SUE KING 
In a 12 to 11 roll-call vote, the
ASSU Senate last night decided to
postpone debate on the question of
accepting the Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC) charter proposed by the
Committee of 15 (C 15). The question
will be raised again at a special meeting
scheduled for Wednesday, June 6.
Arguments ranged from reaching a
decision at last night's meeting to
referring the proposal to the student
body for a vote.
Sens. Tom Flohr and Jim
Anderson, both members of the C-15,
urged that the Senate take action on
the proposal this year. They both felt
that the proposal would be in danger
of failing if debate was postponed
until next fall, when present student
members of the C-15 would not be at
Stanford to explain and defend the
proposal.
However, former ASSU Vice
President Brent Appel said "To suggest
that the student senate should pass the
proposal in one night is the most
arrogant thing I've ever heard of. To
suggest that the student senate should
pass the proposal in one week is the
second most arrogant thing I've ever
heard of."
Appel proposed referring the
charter to the student body for

approval, as was done with the
proposed SJC last fall.
The charter proposes an SJC
composed of four students, three
faculty members and a chairman from
the Law School. However, a provision
in the charter says that "upon
determining that the SJC is impaired
by the composition of that body, the
University President, or two-thirds of
those members of the ASSU Senate
present and voting or two-thirds of
those members of the Academic
Senate present and voting may reduce
the number of student positions on
the SJC by one."
In other business, the Senate
approved the ASSU operating budget
for next year, elected a new Elections
Commissioner to replace Mike Nilsson,
who resigned last night, and made
some minor changes in the by-laws.
Sen. Rick Haskell was elected to
the office, defeating Jack Handy, who
served as Assistant Commissioner
under Nilsson this year.
Nilsson said that he is going to ask
for a reconsideration of the results of
the election because he doesn't think
"Rick Haskell knows anything about
the Election Commissioner's job."
Nilsson said that he resigned
because he feels he will not have the
time to do the job next year.

The charter proposes an SJC
composed of four students, three
faculty members and a chairman from
the Law School. However, a provision
in the charter says that "upon
determining that the SJC is impaired
by the composition of that body, the
University President, or two-thirds of
those members of the ASSU Senate
present and voting or two-thirds of
those members of the Academic
Senate present and voting may reduce
the number of student positions on
the SJC by one."
In other business, the Senate
approved the ASSU operating budget
for next year, elected a new Elections
Commissioner to replace Mike Nilsson,
who resigned last night, and made
some minor changes in the by-laws.
Sen. Rick Haskell was elected to
the office, defeating Jack Handy, who
served as Assistant Commissioner
under Nilsson this year.
Nilsson said that he is going to ask
for a reconsideration of the results of
the election because he doesn't think
"Rick Haskell knows anything about
the Election Commissioner's job."
Nilsson said that he resigned
because he feels he will not have the
time to do the job next year.
