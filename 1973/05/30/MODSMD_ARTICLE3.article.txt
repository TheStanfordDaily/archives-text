# Campus Due Process Questioned
## Lyman Criticizes Franklin Ruling 
### 
A Superior Court judge's ruling last
week "calls into question the place of
due process on campus" and the
usefulness of "all the procedures that
universities and colleges have created
in support of their tenure policies,"
President Richard Lyman said last
night.
Judge Joseph Kelly held Thursday
that a faculty Advisory Board
recommendation to fire former
English Prof. H. Bruce Franklin would
not be considered in Franklin's civil
suit against the University.

The Board of Trustees voted to fire
Franklin, a tenured professor, for
allegedly inciting to violence and
disruption, and so engaging in
"personal conduct substantially
impairing" performance of his
"appropriate functions within the
community."
Speaking on Campus Conference, a
KZSU Public Affairs program, Lyman
said the judge had "declared in effect
that the case would have to be tried as
if there had been no hearings on the
campus, as if no facts had been
established."
Lyman criticized Kelly's decision as
a "threat to the whole structure the
American Association of University
Professors has been trying to build in
American colleges for half a century."
Beyond Expectations
The president said the ruling "went
beyond anything the University
expected or anticipated." He indicated
that Stanford probably will ask the
Court of Appeals to reverse at least
part of the decision, and "set some
limits on the amount of review that is
to take place in Superior Court."
A university faculty is in a better
position than a court to judge tenure
issues, and its findings should be given
some weight in court, Lyman
maintained.
Although he has not yet reviewed
the C-15 proposal for a judicial system
with a student majority, Lyman said
he was "sympathetic to their
findings." He said the administration
will wait for complete discussion
before approving or rejecting the
proposal, which must also receive
approval from the Student Senate and
Faculty Senate before taking effect.
Delt Victims 'Terrorized'
The president recounted University
attempts to resolve problems with the
Delta Tau Delta fraternity short of
suspension, and said victims of Delt

"attacks" have been "somewhat
terrorized, and I think that's not too
strong a word."
He said suspension came after "at
least ten episodes" involving rock- and
bottle-throwing at adjacent living
groups by frat members.
The suspension will not preclude
individual judicial prosecutions,
Lyman said, if evidence that would
"identify individuals and constitute
the basis for a case" emerges.

ruling would have on due process on campus and its effect on the tenure system.

of Delta Tau Delta if sufficient evidence can be gathered to warrant an
investigation.

limits on the amount of review that is
to take place in Superior Court."
A university faculty is in a better
position than a court to judge tenure
issues, and its findings should be given
some weight in court, Lyman
maintained.
Although he has not yet reviewed
the C-15 proposal for a judicial system
with a student majority, Lyman said
he was "sympathetic to their
findings." He said the administration
will wait for complete discussion
before approving or rejecting the
proposal, which must also receive
approval from the Student Senate and
Faculty Senate before taking effect.
Delt Victims 'Terrorized'
The president recounted University
attempts to resolve problems with the
Delta Tau Delta fraternity short of
suspension, and said victims of Delt

"attacks" have been "somewhat
terrorized, and I think that's not too
strong a word."
He said suspension came after "at
least ten episodes" involving rock- and
bottle-throwing at adjacent living
groups by frat members.
The suspension will not preclude
individual judicial prosecutions,
Lyman said, if evidence that would
"identify individuals and constitute
the basis for a case" emerges.

h RANKLIN RULING QUESTIONED — President Richard Lyman, speaking on
KZSU's Campus Conference, questioned the effect that a recent Superior Court
ruling would have on due process on campus and its effect on the tenure system.
Lyman also stated that the University may seek to prosecute individual members
of Delta Tau Delta if sufficient evidence can be gathered to warrant an
investigation.
A Superior Court judge's ruling last
week "calls into question the place of
due process on campus" and the
usefulness of "all the procedures that
universities and colleges have created
in support of their tenure policies,"
President Richard Lyman said last
night.
Judge Joseph Kelly held Thursday
that a faculty Advisory Board
recommendation to fire former
English Prof. H. Bruce Franklin would
not be considered in Franklin's civil
suit against the University.

The Board of Trustees voted to fire
Franklin, a tenured professor, for
allegedly inciting to violence and
disruption, and so engaging in
"personal conduct substantially
impairing" performance of his
"appropriate functions within the
community."
Speaking on Campus Conference, a
KZSU Public Affairs program, Lyman
said the judge had "declared in effect
that the case would have to be tried as
if there had been no hearings on the
campus, as if no facts had been
established."
Lyman criticized Kelly's decision as
a "threat to the whole structure the
American Association of University
Professors has been trying to build in
American colleges for half a century."
Beyond Expectations
The president said the ruling "went
beyond anything the University
expected or anticipated." He indicated
that Stanford probably will ask the
Court of Appeals to reverse at least
part of the decision, and "set some
limits on the amount of review that is
to take place in Superior Court."
