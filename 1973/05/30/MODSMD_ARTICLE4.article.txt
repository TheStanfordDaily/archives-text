# Bradley Wins Runoff, Unseats Mayor Yorty
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Thomas
Bradley defeated incumbent Sam
Yorty yesterday to become the first
black mayor of the nation's third
largest city.
Yorty, 63, the self-styled "maverick
mayor," acknowledged the trend was
against his try for an unprecedented
fourth full term, but refused to
concede.
Bradley, a 10-year veteran of the
city council, was described as
"cautiously optimistic" and vithheld a
victory statement.
With 75 percent of the vote
counted, it was Bradley 324,101 or
55.5 percent, Yorty 260,332 or 44.5
percent.
Very Radical
Yorty, one of the nation's veteran
politicians, said the change in city
government, if it happened, would "be
a very radical one and there will be a
lot of people who will wish they had
gone out and voted." That threat had
been a major Yorty theme during the
vituperative campaign.
Yorty blamed his apparent defeat
on a low voter turnout in his
strongholds, largely the sprawling San
Fernando Valley tracts that house
white, middle-class men and women.
In any event, Yorty said, "We'll
have the satisfaction of knowing we
gave the city the 12 best years of
government it's ever had."
Largest City
Bradley's victory makes Los

Angeles the nation's largest city ever
to have a black mayor.
The turnout was heaviest in the
pro-Bradley areas heavily populated
with blacks, who comprise about 16
percent of the city's three million
residents, and on the more liberal west
side.
Race was a major issue in the
vituperative rematch between the two
candidates. The campaign was similar
in many ways to four years ago when
Yorty won his third term.
Radical Takeover
Yorty charged that Bradley's
election would mean a radical takeover
of city government and he accused his
opponent of being "sort of a black
nationalist."
Bradley, president-elect of the
National League of Cities, said Yorty's
efforts to link him with black radicals
were "scurrilous" and he repudiated
an endorsement by Black Panther
leader lluey Newton.
The election had been rated a
toss-up by political experts who said
the outcome could hinge on who was
best able to turn out his supporters. In
the final Field Corp. poll last week,
Bradley held a five-point lead but
there was a large bloc of undecided
voters.
65 Percent
About 65 percent of the city's 1.2
million registered voters turned out
yesterday, election officials said,
compared with 76 percent four years
ago.
Bradley, a one-time police
lieutenant and the son of a
Mare-cropper, led the field of 13
candidates in the April 3 mayoral
primary, but Yorty was close behind.
Yorty drew criticism throughout
his tenure at city hall for his frequent
foreign travel and his attempts — all of
them unsuccessful — to win higher
office.
The flamboyant mayor made a
brief Quixotic run for the Presidency
in the spring of 1972.
Bradley said during the campaign
that Los Angeles was at a cross-roads,
facing major urban problems in the
wake of its spectacular post-World War
II development.

residents, and on the more liberal west
side.
Race was a major issue in the
vituperative rematch between the two
candidates. The campaign was similar
in many ways to four years ago when
Yorty won his third term.
Radical Takeover
Yorty charged that Bradley's
election would mean a radical takeover
of city government and he accused his
opponent of being "sort of a black
nationalist."
Bradley, president-elect of the
National League of Cities, said Yorty's
efforts to link him with black radicals
were "scurrilous" and he repudiated
an endorsement by Black Panther
leader lluey Newton.
The election had been rated a
toss-up by political experts who said
the outcome could hinge on who was
best able to turn out his supporters. In
the final Field Corp. poll last week,
Bradley held a five-point lead but
there was a large bloc of undecided
voters.
65 Percent
About 65 percent of the city's 1.2
million registered voters turned out
yesterday, election officials said,
compared with 76 percent four years
ago.
Bradley, a one-time police
lieutenant and the son of a
Mare-cropper, led the field of 13
candidates in the April 3 mayoral
primary, but Yorty was close behind.
Yorty drew criticism throughout
his tenure at city hall for his frequent
foreign travel and his attempts — all of
them unsuccessful — to win higher
office.
The flamboyant mayor made a
brief Quixotic run for the Presidency
in the spring of 1972.
Bradley said during the campaign
that Los Angeles was at a cross-roads,
facing major urban problems in the
wake of its spectacular post-World War
II development.
LOS ANGELES (AP) — Thomas
Bradley defeated incumbent Sam
Yorty yesterday to become the first
black mayor of the nation's third
largest city.
Yorty, 63, the self-styled "maverick
mayor," acknowledged the trend was
against his try for an unprecedented
fourth full term, but refused to
concede.
Bradley, a 10-year veteran of the
city council, was described as
"cautiously optimistic" and vithheld a
victory statement.
With 75 percent of the vote
counted, it was Bradley 324,101 or
55.5 percent, Yorty 260,332 or 44.5
percent.
Very Radical
Yorty, one of the nation's veteran
politicians, said the change in city
government, if it happened, would "be
a very radical one and there will be a
lot of people who will wish they had
gone out and voted." That threat had
been a major Yorty theme during the
vituperative campaign.
Yorty blamed his apparent defeat
on a low voter turnout in his
strongholds, largely the sprawling San
Fernando Valley tracts that house
white, middle-class men and women.
In any event, Yorty said, "We'll
have the satisfaction of knowing we
gave the city the 12 best years of
government it's ever had."
Largest City
Bradley's victory makes Los

Angeles the nation's largest city ever
to have a black mayor.
The turnout was heaviest in the
pro-Bradley areas heavily populated
with blacks, who comprise about 16
percent of the city's three million
residents, and on the more liberal west
side.
