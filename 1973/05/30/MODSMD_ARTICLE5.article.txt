# Policy Board Seeks Budget Increase
## Direction Of Urban Studies Disputed 
### JAMES LOBSENZ 
The Urban Studies Policy Board
and Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James L. Gibbs are having some
disagreements about the outlook for
the development of the Urban Studies
Program, but the atmosphere of the
negotiations has been termed
"amicable," by Gibbs, and "cordial"
by Urban Studies Director Henry van
der Voort.

The Policy Board recently
submitted to Gibbs a detailed analysis
of what they considered to be a viable
plan for the future of the program, but
Gibbs had reservations about the
Policy Board's view of "the direction
of the program."
Gibbs maintains that the "basic
problem is the fact that there are a lot
of faculty members with peripheral
interests in urban studies, but it looks

as if they prefer working in their own
departments rather than in an
interdisciplinary program."
Van der Voort concedes that this is
essentially true, but only because the
faculty members in question are
mostly junior faculty members, "so it
is bad for their careers to spend a lot
of time on Urban Studies." He pointed
out that for those seeking tenure, "it
would not be too smart on their part
to do so."
Gibbs also differs from the Policy
Board in his view of how the program
should be administrated. The Policy
Board requested that a full time
director be appointed, and that the
administrative duties of the program
be shared between the director and the
faculty chairman of the
Committee-In-Charge for Urban
Studies. The present chairman is
Michael Kirst, Asst. Prof. of
Education.
Gibbs agrees to the split in
administrative duties but feels that
some of the duties that the Policy
Board has ascribed to the director
should be handled instead by the
faculty chairman.
The long range plan for the future

of the program encompass the
eventual merging of the two positions,
with the program administrated by
one tenured professor who would
assume all administrative duties.
"The problem is," asserts van der
Voort, "there isn't that kind of money
around to buy that kind of person
right now."
The other major issue is the size of
the program's budget. Gibbs contends
that "the budget will take care of itself
once we take care of the other issues."
He declined to estimate what budget
figure might eventually be agreed
upon. The Policy Board has requested
a budget of $35,000. At present the
program's budget is $13,000.
Van der Voort says he understands
Gibbs' attitude toward the budget.
"He's the guy who has to sell it to the
Provost's Office." Although van der
Voort agrees with Gibbs that the
budget is not the central issue, he
holds that "it is still kind of crucial to
us. We're a bit worried about it."
In van der Voort's opinion "the
University is presently getting a good
deal of mileage out of us for relatively
little cost, and understandably they'd
like to keep it that way."
