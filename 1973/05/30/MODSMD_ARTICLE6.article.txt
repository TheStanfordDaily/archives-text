From The Associated Press
WASHINGTON — A commander of U.S. prisoners of war
formally accused eight enlisted men yesterday of
collaborating with the North Vietnamese while in
captivity.
Col. Theodore W. Guy filed formal charges against five
Army men and three Marines, alleging their misconduct
had occured while he was the senior American in a POW
camp outside Hanoi known as the "Plantation."
The Pentagon has followed a general policy of allowing
the issue of alleged misbehavior among the 566 returned
military POWs to die quietly.
Guy, of Tucson, Ariz., has said that some POWs
obtained special privileges by telling the North
Vietnamese of the activities of the other prisoners. In
some cases other POWs were tortured as a result of the
alleged collaboration, according to Guy.
Several Charges
Guy filed a number of charges, including aiding the
enemy, failure to obey orders and conspiracy.
The three Marines charged were Sgt. Abel L.
Kavanaugh of Westminister, Colo.; Staff Sgt. Alfonso E.
Riate, of Santa Rosa, Calif.; and Pvt. Frederick L. Elbert,
Jr., of Brentwood, N.Y.
Kavanaugh and Riate are currently on convalescent
leave from the Navy hospital at Camp Pendleton, Calif.
Elbert is under treatment at St. Albans Naval Hospital, St.
Albans. N.Y.
The decision on whether to summon a court-martial
will rest with commanders of the military posts where the
men are current ly assigned.
Marine officials could not be reached immediately.
Late yesterday the Armv identified the five Army men

as: Spec. 4 Michael F. Branch, 26, of Highland Heights,
Ky.; S. Sgt. Robert P. Chenoweth, 25, of Portland, Ore.;
Sgt. James A. Daly Jr. of Brooklyn, N.Y.; S. Sgt. King D.
Rayford, 27, of Chicago, 111.; and S. Sgt. John A. Young,
27, Grayslake, 111.
The Army said all are on convalescent leave.
Free To Travel
Army officials said that since they were on
convalescent leave, they were not obligated to check in
daily and were free to move about without any restraints.
The Army said it has not yet decided whether the
Army secretary or local commanders of posts where the
soldiers are stationed would make th« decision on
convening a court martial.
In filing charges, Guy acted under a provision < '
military' law which permits any soldier to file charges
against any other serviceman who he thinks has broken
the U.S. code of military justice. Guy's charges must be
weighed by the secretaries of the Army and Navy who will
determine if a court-martial will be convened.
Other POW Charges
Pentagon spokesman Jerry W. Friedheim said "a
handful" of other former POWs had sought out Pentagon
officials about whether to bring their own charges.
Friedheim did not answer directly when asked at a
morning briefing if Pentagon lawyers attempted to
dissuade Guy from bringing charges. The spokesman
would say only that Guy sought and received legal advice.
Guy, shot down over Laos March 22, 1968 has said he
was extensively tortured during the five years he spent in
various POW camps.
Most of the prisoners under his command in the
Plantation were Navy or Air Force pilots.
