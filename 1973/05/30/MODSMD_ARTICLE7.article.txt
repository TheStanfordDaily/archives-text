# That Old 'Fair Share'
## The 						Revenue Mafia 
### 
Chris Hocker

There are an awful lot of
Stanford people from the Los
Angeles area, most of whom swear
that they will never go back.
One of the things that they
won't go back to, presumably, is
Mayor Sam. Twelve years under
one chief executive can bring
about a certain numbness in city
politics that more limited regimes
never quite achieve.
For all I know, of course,
Mayor Sam may have been
defeated by Tom Bradley. I don't
know, because I'm writing this on
a Monday afternoon, but you'll
probably know who won as you
read this. Whoever wins, Yorty's
impact on the City of "Los
Angle-us"—as he would
pronounce it, with a hard
"G"—will last at least as long as he
did.

I was in L.A. recently for a
sufficient time to figure out what
the main issues in the campaign
for mayor were. A very clear
point was made by one of the
candidates: Los Angeles isn't
getting enough federal funds for
programs to help the people in the
city. Los Angeles isn't getting "its
share."
This is not a new complaint to
citizens of the Big Cities, and
some politician can usually be
relied upon to play it for all it's
worth. Eventually, Big City voters
begin to feel that they are
somehow getting the bad end of
the stick; that, while other
residents in other cities are rolling
in "free" federal money, they are
condemned to a hard existence of
scrimping and stretching their last
nickel. And, sooner or later, a
politician who has taken
advantage of — or rather, who has
created — this discontent, is
elected.
He then discovers what fun
being a mayor can be. He gets to
fly to Washington a lot, in order
to lobby for funds. He gets to
trade political favors — his bloc of
votes in say, the senatorial
election in return for aid in
securing more money. People start

coming to him for help with
various aspects of city
government, which he gladly
gives ... in return for a number of
useful 1.0.U.'5. With the stakes
raised so dramatically, the new
mayor can transform his job from
a drab ceremonial position to that
of regioial royalty.
Bomb Shell
Thus, the charge that sounds so
innocent - "Our city isn't getting
its fair share!" — turns into a
bombshell when the "remedy" is
applied.
This has so far ignored a
question which is at least as
important as what the mayor does
with the money. Whose money is
it to begin with? When a revenue
check comes to a city from
Washington, where did
Washington get it, from the sky?
No, from the taxpayer, of
course. So, in effect, each tax
dollar goes from the individual to
the federal government to the city
government and, presumably,
back to the taxpayer in a sort of
thanatoptic cycle. Only about 40
percent of the initial dollar has
been eaten away by bureaucracy
and inflation before it gets back
to the person who had it in the
first place — if he ever gets it at
all.
Joe Colombo.. .
The issue of federal revenue
sharing in the L.A. mayor's race,
and in other Big City political
struggles, conjures up a scenario
straight out of a Mario Puzo
might mare:
"Awright," says the chairman,
"it's time to elect a new capo for
our territory. Rico here, he's-a
been capo for twenny years.
Emilio here, he wants to be the
new capo. What you gotta say,
Rico?"
A tall, scarfaced man gets up.
"I been a good capo for twenny
years and there's-a no reason to
change."
. .. Call Your Office
"What about you, Emilio?"
A short, pockmarked man gets
up. "Our territory ain't as rich as
it could be. Rico, here, he's-a not

getting enough help from the
Godfather. The Godfather, he
gotta lot of money. If I'm capo, I
go to the Godfather and I say,
'Hey, Godfather, our territory
iin't gettin' it's fair share.' He'll
understand."
Chances are, he will
understand, because all
"Godfathers," whether or not
they're dignified by a
governmental title, know the
language of politics and money.
And most offers made in that
language are extremely difficult to
refuse.

years and there's-a no reason to

A short, pockmarked man gets
up. "Our territory ain't as rich as
it could be. Rico, here, he's-a not

Godfather. The Godfather, he
gotta lot of money. If I'm capo, I
go to the Godfather and I say,

There are an awful lot of
Stanford people from the Los
Angeles area, most of whom swear
that they will never go back.
One of the things that they
won't go back to, presumably, is
Mayor Sam. Twelve years under
one chief executive can bring
about a certain numbness in city
politics that more limited regimes
never quite achieve.
For all I know, of course,
Mayor Sam may have been
defeated by Tom Bradley. I don't
know, because I'm writing this on
a Monday afternoon, but you'll
probably know who won as you
read this. Whoever wins, Yorty's
impact on the City of "Los
Angle-us"—as he would
pronounce it, with a hard
"G"—will last at least as long as he
did.

I was in L.A. recently for a
sufficient time to figure out what
the main issues in the campaign
for mayor were. A very clear
point was made by one of the
candidates: Los Angeles isn't
getting enough federal funds for
programs to help the people in the
city. Los Angeles isn't getting "its
share."
This is not a new complaint to
citizens of the Big Cities, and
some politician can usually be
relied upon to play it for all it's
worth. Eventually, Big City voters
begin to feel that they are
somehow getting the bad end of
the stick; that, while other
residents in other cities are rolling
in "free" federal money, they are
condemned to a hard existence of
scrimping and stretching their last
nickel. And, sooner or later, a
politician who has taken
advantage of — or rather, who has
created — this discontent, is
elected.
He then discovers what fun
being a mayor can be. He gets to
fly to Washington a lot, in order
to lobby for funds. He gets to
trade political favors — his bloc of
votes in say, the senatorial
election in return for aid in
securing more money. People start

coming to him for help with
various aspects of city
government, which he gladly
gives ... in return for a number of
useful 1.0.U.'5. With the stakes
raised so dramatically, the new
mayor can transform his job from
a drab ceremonial position to that
of regioial royalty.
Bomb Shell
Thus, the charge that sounds so
innocent - "Our city isn't getting
its fair share!" — turns into a
bombshell when the "remedy" is
applied.
This has so far ignored a
question which is at least as
important as what the mayor does
with the money. Whose money is
it to begin with? When a revenue
check comes to a city from
Washington, where did
Washington get it, from the sky?
No, from the taxpayer, of
course. So, in effect, each tax
dollar goes from the individual to
the federal government to the city
government and, presumably,
back to the taxpayer in a sort of
thanatoptic cycle. Only about 40
percent of the initial dollar has
been eaten away by bureaucracy
and inflation before it gets back
to the person who had it in the
first place — if he ever gets it at
all.

The issue of federal revenue
sharing in the L.A. mayor's race,
and in other Big City political
struggles, conjures up a scenario
straight out of a Mario Puzo
might mare:
"Awright," says the chairman,
"it's time to elect a new capo for
our territory. Rico here, he's-a
been capo for twenny years.
Emilio here, he wants to be the

applied.
This has so far ignored a
question which is at least as
important as what the mayor does
with the money. Whose money is
it to begin with? When a revenue
check comes to a city from
Washington, where did
Washington get it, from the sky?
No, from the taxpayer, of
course. So, in effect, each tax
dollar goes from the individual to
the federal government to the city
government and, presumably,
back to the taxpayer in a sort of
thanatoptic cycle. Only about 40
percent of the initial dollar has
been eaten away by bureaucracy
and inflation before it gets back
to the person who had it in the
first place — if he ever gets it at
all.

The issue of federal revenue
sharing in the L.A. mayor's race,
and in other Big City political
struggles, conjures up a scenario
straight out of a Mario Puzo
might mare:
"Awright," says the chairman,
"it's time to elect a new capo for
our territory. Rico here, he's-a
been capo for twenny years.
Emilio here, he wants to be the
new capo. What you gotta say,
Rico?"
A tall, scarfaced man gets up.
"I been a good capo for twenny
years and there's-a no reason to
change."
. .. Call Your Office
"What about you, Emilio?"
A short, pockmarked man gets
up. "Our territory ain't as rich as
it could be. Rico, here, he's-a not

getting enough help from the
Godfather. The Godfather, he
gotta lot of money. If I'm capo, I
go to the Godfather and I say,
'Hey, Godfather, our territory
iin't gettin' it's fair share.' He'll
understand."
Chances are, he will
understand, because all
"Godfathers," whether or not
they're dignified by a
governmental title, know the
language of politics and money.
And most offers made in that
language are extremely difficult to
refuse.
