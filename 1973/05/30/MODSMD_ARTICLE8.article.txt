# Inescapable and Unobjectionable
## On Income Differences 
### 
William R. Havender

Recent articles in Commentary and other publications that have
reviewed Christopher Jencks' new book, Inequality, have debated
what should be done to reduce income disparity. But at least two
essential issues have largely been ignored in these discussions.
The first is the means by which income inequalities arise. These
come about differently in different social systems, and the moral case
for their elimination, rather than being self-evident, depends critically
upon the social context. In an aristocracy, the wealth of the elite is
extracted by force from the common people in a sort of zero sum
game, where the income of some must be lost by others. An
egalitarian policy in this setting would undoubtedly serve the interests
of morality, since the income distribution initially results from
compulsion.
This is not true of a market economy, where one's income is set by
the value placed upon the services one offers to others.
Market-determined income is a return for rendered benefits, whose
magnitude is specified in voluntary negotiation with one's clients.
Differences in income reflect different market valuations of these
services, and great incomes are generated by supplying others with
resources of great value or rarity.
Exchange
But such mutual benefit is on principle a property of every
voluntary exchange. Income disparity arising in this context comes
about solely from the specialization of labor, and from the fact that
certain services are more desired, or are scarcer, than others.
That is why it is not clear what is meant by the concept of a "just"
distribution of income, as somehow distinct from that which results
from the plebiscite of the market; the market's verdict already is very
just, in the sense that one's income, hence, one's claim upon the
limited resources of society, is proportional to the value of one's
services to others.
Similarly off the mark is the assertion that "the people" object to
and demand redress of income inequality, when, in fact, income

differences originate in the first instance through the people's casting
of dollar votes in the marketplace; these differences, therefore, are the
manifestation, over time, of the expressed will of the people in this
regard. It is obvious, then, that those who oppose this do not speak
for the majority.
Fascism
Because of the voluntary nature of market exchanges, it is
exceedingly difficult to justify the intrusion of third parties — such as
sociologists, or politicians — into two party transactions, as for
example when they attack the income profile which thereby results.
Does one have an unconditional right to negotiate the terms under
which one will exchange one's services, or not? To argue that third
parties do have standing to interfere simply diminishes the extent to
which one's work serves one's own purposes, a view more usually
associated with fascism than with liberalism.
It can, to be sure, be argued with considerable justice that the
actual income distribution in America reflects the impact of
involuntary or nonmarket forces such as discrimination, fraud or
government indulgences. And so it does. But these influences should
be vigorously opposed precisely because they do cause a departure
from the income allocation which otherwise would correspond to the
people's market wishes, and so cannot be used to buttress the much
greater departure which the goal of income equality itself represents.
Government
The second curiously omitted yet surpassingly important issue is
this: immanent in any proposal to eliminate income inequality is the
necessity of creating a much greater inequality of political power. In
simple words, the right to determine the disposal of earned income
will be transferred from a large number of moderately or very wealthy
individuals to the small number of archons momentarily regnant in
the offices of government.
While the money may well be passed to the poor, the power will
remain with "them above" — the State. No matter what public
purpose might superficially be served by this transfer, the essence of
the political change will be a vast increase in the centralization of
social control. And the ensuing inequality of political power — that
between rulers and subjects — could not be rendered innocuous by the
democratic process, since transitory majorities are as capable as
monarchs of arbitrary tyranny against politically weak groups.
More than likely, the grand increase in the stakes brought about by
this increment in state authority would greatly intensify and embitter
the political struggle for power, as has already occurred in those areas
where the government has sought to control private economic power
through regulatory agencies. This prospect is much more sinister than
what, by contrast, appears to be the mild and diffuse inequality of
power now accompanying existing income differences.
Baffling
Since this aggrandizement of political inequality manifestly would
be the paramount result of a policy of equalizing income, it is baffling
that Christopher Jencks would offer, as one of the grounds for his
income-flattening proposals, a desire to ensure "that everyone exercise
the same amount of political power." Exactly the opposite is the
likely consequence, should this intellectual frolic ever be adopted.
Moreover, this authority must of necessity be used for more than
mere redistribution. For, if you will have the same level of living
whatever you do, why should you work? "If there is no carrot to
encourage effort, there will have to be a stick. Enforced egalitarianism
also means enforced labor; it also means a slave state. It is a horrible,
not an inspiring, vision." (Milton Friedman)
Income differences, then, are inescapable and unobjectionable in a
society grounded in personal liberty. Here, as always, the attenuation
of our political freedom has been gussied up with an obscuring veil of
lofty but illusive objective. Hence, one must scrutinize this bride,
egalitarianism, with assiduous care before closing the purchase.
