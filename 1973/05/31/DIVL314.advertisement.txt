The Economics of Unionization understanding of the election and
J of the possible issues involved in
the outcome.
Samuel Gompers, a prominent leader of the American Federation of
Labor in the early years of this century, summed up the philosophy of the
American trade union movement in one word: "More."
Unquestionably, an important contribution of the labor movement in
the United States has been to gain more for the American worker.
The impact of unionization upon each eligible voter's finances is
certainly one of the important issues in the forthcoming NLRB election;
and before casting his vote on June 6, each voter should consider these
questions:
1 - What are the possible costs of unionization ? 2 - What are the possible gains?
