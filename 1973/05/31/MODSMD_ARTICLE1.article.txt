# Ex-Stanford Radical Arrested On Trinidad
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Former Stanford radical James
Edward Johnson, missing for nearly
two and a half years, has been arrested
on the island of Trinidad on federal
charges of unlawful flight to avoid
prosecution.
Johnson had been sought since
March, 1971 by Santa Cruz County
prosecutors on a charge of unlawful
possession of explosives at a "bomb
factory" he allegedly operated at a
remote cabin in the Santa Cruz
Mountains.
Johnson was arrested last weekend
in Trinidad and was arraigned Tuesday
in San Juan, P.R. on the federal
charges. A hearing has been set for
June 7 at which a U.S. magistrate is
expected to dismiss the unlawful flight
charge, paving the way for Johnson's
extradition to California.
Details Unavailable
Details of Johnson's capture —
including how he was transported
from Trinidad to Puerto Rico — were
not immediately available. San
Francisco FBI spokesman Tom
Dougan said yesterday that his office
was attempting to contact San Juan
for further information.
The Associated Press reported last
night that Johnson had been removed
from Trinidad by local authorities.
The AP report said Johnson had been
positively identified by his
fingerprints.
Johnson was being held in San Juan
yesterday in lieu of $25,000 bail.
1971 Slaying
In testimony before the Senate
Internal Security Subcommittee in
February and March, 1971,
revolutionary-turned-FBI informer
Thomas Edward Mosher placed
Johnson at the site of the Jan. 6, 1971
slaying of Black Panther Anon "Fred"
Bennett near Johnson's remote Santa
Cruz County cabin. Mosher said
Johnson aided in disposal of Bennett's
body.
However, Ray Belgard, chief
investigator for the Santa Cruz County
District Attorney's office, said
yesterday that "unless he [Johnson]

says something," there is not enough
evidence to charge him in the case.
James E. Carr, whom Mosher said
shot Bennett, was killed in an
execution-style slaying in San Jose on
April 6, 1972. Lamar Lloyd Mims and
Richard Rodriquez were subsequently
convicted of murder, and prosecutors
charged at the time that the two were
hired by an unnamed third party.
Belgard refused to reveal specifics
of the complaint against Johnson, but
confirmed that it concerned possession
of explosives at the cabin "on or
around March 10, 1971."
Bomb Factory
Mosher charged in his testimony
that the cabin was used as a factory to
produce explosives for several
bombings throughout the Bay Area.
He accused Johnson of participating in
an Oct. 8, 1970 blast at the Marin
County Courthouse in San Rafael, and
another attempted bombing at the
Palo Alto branch of the Bank of
America.
He also claimed that "it was
revealed" to him that Johnson set an
April, 1970 fire at Stanford's
Behavioral Science Institute.
Johnson has not been charged with
any of these crimes.
Johnson, from Jamaica, N.Y., was a
senior in chemical engineering here
before he disappeared.
Long-time area activist Lenny
Siegel, Johnson's former roommate
and now director of the Pacific Studies
Center, said yesterday that Johnson
jumped bail on three previous felony
charges when he went underground.
Siegel said Johnson had been
accused of assault on a police officer
in Santa Clara County, and of
possession of dangerous devices and
possession of illegal weapons in San
Mateo County.
Belgard said yesterday that it was
his "understanding" that Johnson
would face other charges after
disposition of the Santa Cruz case.
The charge of unlawful possession
of explosives carries a maximum
penalty of five years in prison and a
$5000 fine.
