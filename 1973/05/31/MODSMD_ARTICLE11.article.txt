# Unions State-Controlled
## Labor In Corporate America 
###

On April 24, the New York Times printed an article entitled
"Forced Arbitration to Avert Some Strikes?" That the Times would
run a journalistic analysis on this topic indicates its importance and
serves as a good starting point for an assessment of the role of labor
unions in the American corporate state.
The Times article notes that many politicians and commentators
speak of work stoppages in terms of the current "complexity" of
American society and the importance of considering the "social cost"
of strikes and their effect on the "public interest."
Behind the rhetoric of public interest lies the special interest of
some government officials, professional labor mediators, large
corporations, and unions in permanently organizing labor relations in
a formal way on the model of the corporate state. This ideal of a
stable and co-operative alliance of big government, big business, and
big labor has in the 20th century been the goal of sophisticated
decision-makers in America.
A corporative system has been the beacon light, as historian Ronald
Radosh has shown, for business leaders like Bernard Baruch and

Gerald P. Swope, government officials like Herbert C. Hoover, and
labor statesmen like Samuel Gompers and Sidney Hillman.
Regulation
As radical critic Sam Weiner puts it, "A State-regulated economy
needs a State-regulated labor movement. The government will help the
unions so long as the leaders can assure the smooth functioning of a
docile labor force."
A seminal formulation of corporate liberal doctrine (and in many
ways the manifesto of the early liberal movement) was Herbert Croly's
Promise of American Life, originally published in 1909.
This important work, which influenced the thinking of Theodore
Roosevelt, Felix Frankfurter, Walter Lippman, Henry L. Stimson,
Robert Lovett, and Learned Hand, frankly advocated
government-controlled labor unions.
Interest
Croly outlines whai he calls a "constructive national policy" on the
organization of labor. What he describes is a method whereby the
government, through discriminatory policies of recognition and
regulation, will ensure its interest, the public interest, and the interest
of "large employers," while crushing freedom of contract,
independent non-union labor, and radical political dissent.
In Croly we find in short the prescription of modern liberalism for
labor relations: mass organization which under state auspices controls
the labor force.
In 1946, President Harry S. Truman seized control of all U.S. coal
mines and then went on to negotiate an agreement with the mine
workers' union. Subsequently, he planned to run the railroads in the
U.S. with railroad workers drafted into the Army.
Stability
The history in succeding years of mandatory cooling-off periods
ind other tools of compulsion are evidence of the open movement of
the government into formalizing the arrangements of the corporate
state and preventing walk-offs from destabilizing the system.
Early in 1972, the Nixon administration proposed legislation to
govern labor relations on railroads, in trucking,and on the docks
through compulsory arbitration. Although the legislation was later
withdrawn for tactical reasons, it has not been forgotten. With
achievement of the full pattern of industrial organization on the
corporate state model of Mussolini's Italy so near, national
decision-makers do not want accidental breakdowns to impair the
harmony of their system. We can, therefore, in all probability look
forward to a more fully developed scheme of wage controls and
compulsory arbitration in the future.
In the words of Murray N. Rothbard, "The mass of workers is
forced [at present] by government measures into trade unions that
tame and integrate the labor force into the toils of the accelerating
corporate state, there to be subjected to arbitrary wage 'guidelines'
and ultimate compulsory arbitration."
