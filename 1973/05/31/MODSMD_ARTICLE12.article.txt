# Confessions Of A Shorthair
## On Rugged Hirsutism 
### 
Artemus Monk

I wish Mr. Simpson, the junior
high school football coach from
Houston, hadn't written that
article criticizing long-haried
athletes: "Common sense
indicates that long hair on a man
is a disgrace." His article was
quoted in the S.F. Chronicle
about a week ago; in the Daily on
May 23.
If only I hadn't read it, I might
have had a fine weekend, what
with my regular Saturday morning
haircut, three or four bouts of
shaving with little "Buzz-Buzz" (a
pet name for my electric razor),
and maybe a couple of manicures.
But Mr. Simpson spoiled all that
for me.
Now I am no athlete, and
besides, I'm pretty well out of
junior high school — I've got the
papers to prove it. But I'm a loyal,
hat-waving fan (if you asked me
to commit myself, I'd say the Bay
Bombers were my favorites). And
I hate to feel so very different
from the men in jerseys.
Air-Foil
Mr. Simpson observes that a lot
of athletes are wearing their hair
long nowadays. I always took
those flowing locks for wigs of
some sort, used for air-foil, or
shade, or even just for show.
Anyhow, I figured that when
they pulled off those helmets and
trooped into that locker room, it
was a clean, close, comfortable
shave, a dab of Brylcreem on
those military brushes then a
splash of sky-blue after-shave and
out on the town.
But if all those hairs are really
growing out of their heads, then
Mr. Simpson is talking about some
of my heroes, real men's men.
These are the fellows who can
drink beer aftt-r beer without

feeling full, then take a brace of
well-known Hollywood starlets
out to dinner. How can I, with my
close-cropped blond hair, hope to
measure up? (Not that I want to,
really. Just call it a question that
concerns me, or may be rankles
just a bit.)
Pantywaist
Well then, if the lusty life is
denied me, perhaps I might still
find domestic happiness. Not so;
Mr. Simpson tells us how
American women prefer long hair
on "their mousey husbands, their
pantywaist boyfriends and
feminine sons." One evening a
week I could probably pass for a
pantywaist boyfriend, but I worry
about achieving the other two.
My mother brought me up as a
masculine kind of son. She always
told me I had been born with a
Boy Scout knife in my mouth.
She knew me well; by the age of
14, I had carved over a dozen
neckerchief slides with that knife.
Built Fort Apache out of Lincoln
Logs, four times over. Ran the
three-legged race solo, once, using
my left arm for the extra leg.
I was a good Scout, my Mom
said. Feminine? It's too late for
that, Mr. Simpson.
Rodents
Mousey husband: now you're
talking. I've always felt closer to
the mouse than to any other
rodent. Way back in the Cub
Scouts, when we were doing
animal imitations. . . but my hair
today is very short. And to be
truly mousey, I'd need long hair,
wouldn't I, Mr. Simpson? I am
afraid, sir, that you have
summarily shaved off the beard of
my future.
I suppose the long-haired, virile
athletes all go to some dark tavern
when they're low, and tell their

troubles to the saloonkeeper. But
I think I'll just go down now to
some sleazy shop, sit myself down
in that big old chair, and talk to
the barber.

pet name for my electric razor),
and maybe a couple of manicures.
But Mr. Simpson spoiled all that
for me.
Now I am no athlete, and
besides, I'm pretty well out of
junior high school — I've got the
papers to prove it. But I'm a loyal,
hat-waving fan (if you asked me
to commit myself, I'd say the Bay
Bombers were my favorites). And
I hate to feel so very different
from the men in jerseys.
Air-Foil
Mr. Simpson observes that a lot
of athletes are wearing their hair
long nowadays. I always took
those flowing locks for wigs of
some sort, used for air-foil, or
shade, or even just for show.
Anyhow, I figured that when
they pulled off those helmets and
trooped into that locker room, it
was a clean, close, comfortable
shave, a dab of Brylcreem on
those military brushes then a
splash of sky-blue after-shave and
out on the town.
But if all those hairs are really
growing out of their heads, then
Mr. Simpson is talking about some
of my heroes, real men's men.
These are the fellows who can
drink beer aftt-r beer without

feeling full, then take a brace of
well-known Hollywood starlets
out to dinner. How can I, with my
close-cropped blond hair, hope to
measure up? (Not that I want to,
really. Just call it a question that
concerns me, or may be rankles
just a bit.)
Pantywaist
Well then, if the lusty life is
denied me, perhaps I might still
find domestic happiness. Not so;
Mr. Simpson tells us how
American women prefer long hair
on "their mousey husbands, their
pantywaist boyfriends and
feminine sons." One evening a
week I could probably pass for a
pantywaist boyfriend, but I worry
about achieving the other two.
My mother brought me up as a
masculine kind of son. She always
told me I had been born with a
Boy Scout knife in my mouth.
She knew me well; by the age of
14, I had carved over a dozen
neckerchief slides with that knife.
Built Fort Apache out of Lincoln
Logs, four times over. Ran the
three-legged race solo, once, using
my left arm for the extra leg.
I was a good Scout, my Mom
said. Feminine? It's too late for
that, Mr. Simpson.
Rodents
Mousey husband: now you're
talking. I've always felt closer to
the mouse than to any other
rodent. Way back in the Cub
Scouts, when we were doing
animal imitations. . . but my hair
today is very short. And to be
truly mousey, I'd need long hair,
wouldn't I, Mr. Simpson? I am
afraid, sir, that you have
summarily shaved off the beard of
my future.
I suppose the long-haired, virile
athletes all go to some dark tavern
when they're low, and tell their

troubles to the saloonkeeper. But
I think I'll just go down now to
some sleazy shop, sit myself down
in that big old chair, and talk to
the barber.

I wish Mr. Simpson, the junior
high school football coach from
Houston, hadn't written that
article criticizing long-haried
athletes: "Common sense
indicates that long hair on a man
is a disgrace." His article was
quoted in the S.F. Chronicle
about a week ago; in the Daily on
May 23.
If only I hadn't read it, I might
have had a fine weekend, what
with my regular Saturday morning
haircut, three or four bouts of
shaving with little "Buzz-Buzz" (a
pet name for my electric razor),
and maybe a couple of manicures.
