Hair!
Editor:
Regarding Coach Tony
Simpson's article in the May issue
of the Texas High School Coaches
Association magazine, (Daily, May
23), perhaps the following list of
long-maned men will help clear his
narrow thinking on the subject:
Jesus Christ, Christopher
Columbus, Leonardo da Vinci,
Michelangelo, William
Shakespeare, George Washington,
Benjamin Franklin, Thomas
Jefferson, etc., etc., etc.
Coach Simpson would do well
to understand that long hair is
not, nor ever has been,
synonymous with drug abuse,
crime, or sexual perversion, but
only an expression of man's
freedom to express his
individuality.
As for his statement "a woman
who wants a man with long hair is
not a real women in her soul,"
remember the statement was
uttered by a Texan.
Also consider that there are
few long-maned politicians in
Washington — and look what's
happening!

Phantom India
Editor:
On my first day in this
country, my host family inquired
if we had pet elephants in India.
And since then I have noticed this
western notion of the "exotic
India" at various instances.
Unfortunately the
snake-charmers, the nail-beds, the
rope-trick are not what made
India, but the western spectators
are much less interested in the
other aspects of Indian — in the
life of an average Indian.
And this is where I believe the
major controversy over Louis
Malle's "Phantom India" film
series lies. The Indian Government
has banned these films in India,
whereas the western critics have
unequivocally acclaimed them as
among the greatest documentaries
ever made!
When the seven-part film series
was screened at Stanford, I
would have liked to warn the
western audience that although
the films do a good job, both
technically and otherwise, they
certainly do not give an entire
picture of the subcontinent — in
fact, not even a significant
fraction. Louis Malle has focused
on poverty and religious and
cultural rituals which appeal to a
westerner's curiosity — a state of
God supported on a human body
by means of hundreds of sharp
spears, or sharp knives cutting
through the tongue and cheeks of
a devotee, etc. In fact, many of
these shots would come as a total
surprise to most Indians.
The films' photography and
direction are excellent. Louis
Malle has been honest in whatever
he has filmed. He has brought out
the complexities within India with
a great skill. But he has certainly
failed to portray an average Indian
— or is there really an average
Indian?
