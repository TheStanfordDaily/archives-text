The price and availability of gasoline is becoming a matter of more
than minor concern for American consumers. Charges and
countercharges have been flying as the energy crisis has become a
daily page one item and fact and fiction are becoming harder and
harder to separate. But since it seems undeniable that the price of a
of gasoline is moving upward, consumers might be intersted in a
recent Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) study which rated the
miles-per-gallon of every 1973 car sold in the United States.
The study was released in late April, but in case you missed it, here
are the major findings. Datsun's lightest models, at 2000 pounds,
turned in the best performance getting almost 28 miles per gallon
(mpg). Toyota followed closely behind at 26 mpg.
Ford's 5500 pound Lincoln-Mercury station wagon managed only
8.4 mpg, which was only slightly better than a Rolls Royce Silver
Shadow. EPA listed results for 365 vehicles submitted by 36
manufacturers.
EPA points out that actual on-the-road mileage can vary widely
depending on a car's equipment and the way it is driven. But their
figures do show some clear patterns.
Sheer weight is the biggest factor in gasoline gulping and the first
thousand extra pounds are the hungriest. Cars in the 2000 pound
range averaged almost 25 mpg, while those weighing 3000 pounds
averaged only 15.4 mpg. The next thousand pounds cut mileage about
half as slowly.
Between 2500 and 3000 pounds, the Dodge Colt at 22.6 mpg and
the BMW 2002 at 21.9 mpg were the best performers. Close behind
were the Opel at 21.7 mpg, and the Ford Pinto at 21.1. At 2750
pounds, GM's Vega at 19.4 mpg and Ford's Capri and Pinto at 19.0
mpg beat all the competition, except for some special utility vehicles
made by AM General Corp.
In the 3000 pound class, Volvo led at 17.7 mpg, while the
American Motors' Hornet, Gremlin and Javelin averaged about 16.4
mpg. Ford's Maverick was in the 14.4 mpg range. At 3500 pounds,
Vokswagen's Combi led at 16.5 mpg, closely followed by the Chrysler
Valiant at 16.0 and Volvo at 15.7. GM's Nova and the AMC Jeepster,
Matador and Javelin registered less than 13 mpg and Ford's Maverick,
Comet and Pantera averaged only 11.4.
Above 3500 pounds, Chrysler models scored well most frequently,
making the best of admittedly low mileages. At 4000 pounds,
Chrysler averaged 12.7 mpg, while AMC, Ford and GM were close to
the class average of 11 mpg. Mercedes-Benz led the class at 12.9 mpg.
Among the "heavies" from 4500 to 5500 pounds, differences were
relatively small. Checker turned in the best heavyweight mileages for
"standard" type passenger cars. AMC models led the 4500 class.
Chrysler was second in that class and first in the 5000 and 5500
pound categories.
In all three heavyweight categories, Chrysler was followed by GM
and Ford came in last among the "Big Four." In fact Ford was in a
contest for last place with Rolls Royce and some International
Harvester utility vehicles.
Worst of all in each category, however, were the high-powered
specialty cars made for people who don't care how much gas they
have to buy. Ferrari, at 4000 pounds, registered only 6.4 mpg.
The California Department of Consumer Affairs warns California
consumers to be extra-careful in dealing with companies offering
work-at-home employment. Although many of the opportunities
available to consuemrs who wish to earn money at home are
legitimate, California is plagued by swindlers and by fraudulent
practices. Be especially wary when you see the following:
—Advertisements promising large profits for little work.
—Advertisements requiring you to pay money to obtain further
information.
—No salary is paid by the company.
—Failure to give the names of others who have been employed so
that you can learn of their experience.
—Requirements to pay money to buy products which you,
yourself, must resell for a profit.
Here are some specific examples of types of schemes which have
victimsed unwary consumers.
You are sold instructions and materials for making items at home.
The company promises to purchase the finished product if the work is
"acceptable" or "up to our standards." Companies may reject every
single article you make as "not up to our standards" leaving you to
find your own sales market.
You are sold kits for making items such as shoes, bow ties, or
costume jewelry. Beware! You will have to sell the finished items
yourself to obtain a profit. You will not be paid for the work you do.
You are solicited to address envelopes or post cards at home.
BEWARE! You may not get paid for addressing the envelopes or post
cards. Often you must pay for the cards or envelopes used and do not
receive any money unless consumers buy the company's product as a
result of the advertisements sent in the envelopes you addressed.

depending on a car's equipment and the way it is driven. But their
figures do show some clear patterns.
Sheer weight is the biggest factor in gasoline gulping and the first
thousand extra pounds are the hungriest. Cars in the 2000 pound
range averaged almost 25 mpg, while those weighing 3000 pounds
averaged only 15.4 mpg. The next thousand pounds cut mileage about
half as slowly.
Between 2500 and 3000 pounds, the Dodge Colt at 22.6 mpg and
the BMW 2002 at 21.9 mpg were the best performers. Close behind
were the Opel at 21.7 mpg, and the Ford Pinto at 21.1. At 2750
pounds, GM's Vega at 19.4 mpg and Ford's Capri and Pinto at 19.0
mpg beat all the competition, except for some special utility vehicles
made by AM General Corp.
In the 3000 pound class, Volvo led at 17.7 mpg, while the
American Motors' Hornet, Gremlin and Javelin averaged about 16.4
mpg. Ford's Maverick was in the 14.4 mpg range. At 3500 pounds,
Vokswagen's Combi led at 16.5 mpg, closely followed by the Chrysler
Valiant at 16.0 and Volvo at 15.7. GM's Nova and the AMC Jeepster,
Matador and Javelin registered less than 13 mpg and Ford's Maverick,
Comet and Pantera averaged only 11.4.
Above 3500 pounds, Chrysler models scored well most frequently,
making the best of admittedly low mileages. At 4000 pounds,
Chrysler averaged 12.7 mpg, while AMC, Ford and GM were close to
the class average of 11 mpg. Mercedes-Benz led the class at 12.9 mpg.
Among the "heavies" from 4500 to 5500 pounds, differences were
relatively small. Checker turned in the best heavyweight mileages for
"standard" type passenger cars. AMC models led the 4500 class.
Chrysler was second in that class and first in the 5000 and 5500
pound categories.
In all three heavyweight categories, Chrysler was followed by GM
and Ford came in last among the "Big Four." In fact Ford was in a
contest for last place with Rolls Royce and some International
Harvester utility vehicles.
Worst of all in each category, however, were the high-powered
specialty cars made for people who don't care how much gas they
have to buy. Ferrari, at 4000 pounds, registered only 6.4 mpg.
The California Department of Consumer Affairs warns California
consumers to be extra-careful in dealing with companies offering
work-at-home employment. Although many of the opportunities
available to consuemrs who wish to earn money at home are
legitimate, California is plagued by swindlers and by fraudulent
practices. Be especially wary when you see the following:
—Advertisements promising large profits for little work.
—Advertisements requiring you to pay money to obtain further
information.
—No salary is paid by the company.
—Failure to give the names of others who have been employed so
that you can learn of their experience.
—Requirements to pay money to buy products which you,
yourself, must resell for a profit.
Here are some specific examples of types of schemes which have
victimsed unwary consumers.
You are sold instructions and materials for making items at home.
The company promises to purchase the finished product if the work is
"acceptable" or "up to our standards." Companies may reject every
single article you make as "not up to our standards" leaving you to
find your own sales market.
You are sold kits for making items such as shoes, bow ties, or
costume jewelry. Beware! You will have to sell the finished items
yourself to obtain a profit. You will not be paid for the work you do.
You are solicited to address envelopes or post cards at home.
BEWARE! You may not get paid for addressing the envelopes or post
cards. Often you must pay for the cards or envelopes used and do not
receive any money unless consumers buy the company's product as a
result of the advertisements sent in the envelopes you addressed.

The price and availability of gasoline is becoming a matter of more
than minor concern for American consumers. Charges and
countercharges have been flying as the energy crisis has become a
daily page one item and fact and fiction are becoming harder and
harder to separate. But since it seems undeniable that the price of a
of gasoline is moving upward, consumers might be intersted in a
recent Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) study which rated the
miles-per-gallon of every 1973 car sold in the United States.
The study was released in late April, but in case you missed it, here
are the major findings. Datsun's lightest models, at 2000 pounds,
turned in the best performance getting almost 28 miles per gallon
(mpg). Toyota followed closely behind at 26 mpg.
Ford's 5500 pound Lincoln-Mercury station wagon managed only
8.4 mpg, which was only slightly better than a Rolls Royce Silver
Shadow. EPA listed results for 365 vehicles submitted by 36
manufacturers.

American Motors' Hornet, Gremlin and Javelin averaged about 16.4
mpg. Ford's Maverick was in the 14.4 mpg range. At 3500 pounds,
Vokswagen's Combi led at 16.5 mpg, closely followed by the Chrysler
Valiant at 16.0 and Volvo at 15.7. GM's Nova and the AMC Jeepster,
Matador and Javelin registered less than 13 mpg and Ford's Maverick,
Comet and Pantera averaged only 11.4.
Above 3500 pounds, Chrysler models scored well most frequently,
making the best of admittedly low mileages. At 4000 pounds,
Chrysler averaged 12.7 mpg, while AMC, Ford and GM were close to
the class average of 11 mpg. Mercedes-Benz led the class at 12.9 mpg.
Among the "heavies" from 4500 to 5500 pounds, differences were
relatively small. Checker turned in the best heavyweight mileages for
"standard" type passenger cars. AMC models led the 4500 class.
Chrysler was second in that class and first in the 5000 and 5500
pound categories.
In all three heavyweight categories, Chrysler was followed by GM
and Ford came in last among the "Big Four." In fact Ford was in a
contest for last place with Rolls Royce and some International
Harvester utility vehicles.
Worst of all in each category, however, were the high-powered
specialty cars made for people who don't care how much gas they
have to buy. Ferrari, at 4000 pounds, registered only 6.4 mpg.
The California Department of Consumer Affairs warns California
consumers to be extra-careful in dealing with companies offering
work-at-home employment. Although many of the opportunities
available to consuemrs who wish to earn money at home are
legitimate, California is plagued by swindlers and by fraudulent
practices. Be especially wary when you see the following:
—Advertisements promising large profits for little work.
—Advertisements requiring you to pay money to obtain further
information.
—No salary is paid by the company.
—Failure to give the names of others who have been employed so
that you can learn of their experience.
—Requirements to pay money to buy products which you,
yourself, must resell for a profit.
Here are some specific examples of types of schemes which have
victimsed unwary consumers.
You are sold instructions and materials for making items at home.
The company promises to purchase the finished product if the work is
"acceptable" or "up to our standards." Companies may reject every
single article you make as "not up to our standards" leaving you to
find your own sales market.
You are sold kits for making items such as shoes, bow ties, or
costume jewelry. Beware! You will have to sell the finished items
yourself to obtain a profit. You will not be paid for the work you do.
You are solicited to address envelopes or post cards at home.
BEWARE! You may not get paid for addressing the envelopes or post
cards. Often you must pay for the cards or envelopes used and do not
receive any money unless consumers buy the company's product as a
result of the advertisements sent in the envelopes you addressed.

The price and availability of gasoline is becoming a matter of more
than minor concern for American consumers. Charges and
countercharges have been flying as the energy crisis has become a
daily page one item and fact and fiction are becoming harder and
harder to separate. But since it seems undeniable that the price of a
of gasoline is moving upward, consumers might be intersted in a
recent Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) study which rated the
miles-per-gallon of every 1973 car sold in the United States.
The study was released in late April, but in case you missed it, here
are the major findings. Datsun's lightest models, at 2000 pounds,
turned in the best performance getting almost 28 miles per gallon
(mpg). Toyota followed closely behind at 26 mpg.
Ford's 5500 pound Lincoln-Mercury station wagon managed only
8.4 mpg, which was only slightly better than a Rolls Royce Silver
Shadow. EPA listed results for 365 vehicles submitted by 36
manufacturers.
EPA points out that actual on-the-road mileage can vary widely
depending on a car's equipment and the way it is driven. But their
figures do show some clear patterns.
Sheer weight is the biggest factor in gasoline gulping and the first
thousand extra pounds are the hungriest. Cars in the 2000 pound
range averaged almost 25 mpg, while those weighing 3000 pounds
averaged only 15.4 mpg. The next thousand pounds cut mileage about
half as slowly.
Between 2500 and 3000 pounds, the Dodge Colt at 22.6 mpg and
the BMW 2002 at 21.9 mpg were the best performers. Close behind
were the Opel at 21.7 mpg, and the Ford Pinto at 21.1. At 2750
pounds, GM's Vega at 19.4 mpg and Ford's Capri and Pinto at 19.0
mpg beat all the competition, except for some special utility vehicles
made by AM General Corp.
In the 3000 pound class, Volvo led at 17.7 mpg, while the
American Motors' Hornet, Gremlin and Javelin averaged about 16.4
mpg. Ford's Maverick was in the 14.4 mpg range. At 3500 pounds,
Vokswagen's Combi led at 16.5 mpg, closely followed by the Chrysler
Valiant at 16.0 and Volvo at 15.7. GM's Nova and the AMC Jeepster,
