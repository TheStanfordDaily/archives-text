# 'Really Roughing It'
## Astronauts Have Home In Skylab 
### 
SPACE CENTER, Houston
(AP) — Astronauts flying in
America's earlier spaceships say
they were "just camping out,
really roughing it." But in Skylab,
the nation's spacemen have a
home.
The 118-foot-long spacecraft
was designed for living in space
and living fairly comfortably. In
previous spacecraft, the essential
idea was to survive.
Skylab astronauts have private
bedrooms, a shower, a fining
room, an exercise area, a library
of books and music, gourmet-type
food, an occasional day off and
even a dart board.
"Skylab doesn't quite have the
service and accommodations of a

luxury hotel," said one space
engineer, "but the view is much
better."
The station is scheduled to be
launched from Cape Kennedy,
Fla., on Monday. Astronauts
Charles Conrad Jr., Joseph P.
Kerwin and Paul J. Weitz will join
it the next day.
Roomy
Skylab has the roominess of a
three-bedroom, 1,600-square-foot
house.
But in space, Skylab should
seem even larger, according to
Conrad, commander of the first
mission aboard the orbiting
laboratory.
"The volume of a spacecraft
seems to expand once you get

into zero g-gravity," he said. Zero
g, or weightlessness, affects almost
every activity of astronauts living
in Skylab.
Float Or Swim
Instead of walking on the floor
of their spacecraft, the astronauts
expect to float or swim along the
ceilings and walls, flitting from
one place to another with the flex
of a finger.
This may sound like fun, but
zero gravity can be troublesome
and can make even the simplest of
tasks difficult.
For instance, if an astronaut
wants to tum a bolt with a
wrench, he has to be anchored.
Otherwise, instead of the bolt
turning when the spaceman

applies muscle, the astronaut
himself will be twisted.
Slight Motion
A slight motion can cause an
astronaut to drift away from
whatever work he's trying to do.
And tools can't be just placed on
a work bench. They have to be
secured somehow or they will
drift away.
To overcome these problems,
Skylab is lined with foot and hand'
restraints and with patches of a
fabric adhesive called Velcro.
Floors have a triangular grid and
the spacemen can wear shoes with
three-sided cleats. To remain in
one place, the astronaut locks the
cleats into the floor.
Weightlessness affects even
basic bodily functions. On earth,
for example, rest room facilities
depend upon gravity to make
water fall and, hence, to flush.
Such facilities on Skylab operate
with a slight air vacuum which
provides the flushing action.
How To Shower
To shower, an astronaut steps
into a collapsed cylinder and
raises it to form an enclosure.
"Inside you've got two hoses —
the goesoutta hose and the
goesinta hose," said Weitz.
The "goesoutta" hose sprays
water and the "goesinta" hose
vacuums it up.
Clinging Water
"Most of the water will cling to
either your skin or the inside of
the enclosure," said Weitz. "When
you're done, you holler to your
buddy and he turns on the
vacuum cleaner."
Weitz said the astronaut taking
the shower then uses the hose to
vacuum away water from himself
and the shower stall.
It sounds simple, but the trick
is that each astronaut gets only
three quarts of water per shower
and only one shower per week. A

shower on earth uses three quarts
in about 30 seconds. Somehow,
the Skylab spacemen must soap
up and rinse off before the water
runs out.
Sleeping
Sleeping may also take a bit of
getting used to.
In a place where there's no
weightlessness, there's also no up
or down. An astronaut can't
actually lie "down" without
possibly drifting away. As a result,
the spacemen sleep in bag-like
restraints which are attached to
the side walls of their bedrooms.
To a person standing on the floor,
the slumbering spaceman appears
to be sleeping on his feet.
Eating on Skylab should be an
adventure, promoting not only
good nutrition, but also fast
reflexes.
The Skylab menu includes such
things as steak, soup, lobster and
other gourmet-type foods. The
adventure part of the menu comes
in getting the food from plate to
mouth in weightlessness.
