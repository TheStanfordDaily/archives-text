# Carpenters In Fine Concert
## 
### JEFFREY GREENWALD 
The Carpenters' performance
last Saturday was one of the best
of the year at the Circle Star
Theatre in San Carlos. All their
songs came to life on the stage as
the enchanting 23 year old Karen
sang song after song with a seven
piece band accompaniment.
The brother and sister vocal
duo have performed all over the
country while earning 10 gold
records, three Grammy awards,
and a place in the hearts of many
music lovers. They performed all
of their big single hits including
such favorites as "Mr. Gooder,"
which was written in 1967 after
the Carpenters were fired from
Disneyland for not singing "Well
Enough," and "Close to You."

The hilarious comedy team of
Skiles and Henderson opened the
evening's show with uproariously
funny pantomines and sounds on
the microphones that imitated
among other things, foghorns,
sheep, and dogs racing in Tijuana.
The versatile talents of Skiles
and Henderson were a delight.
Each comedian played the piano,
sax, drums, and bass. Later in the
show Pete Henderson
accompanied Karen Carpenters'
singing.
The highlight of the night's
performance was when the super
boss jock from radio station
KEZY came to the microphone
and in the disc jockey's voice he
used in the 60s, announced that
the Carpenters were going to sing

Oldies but Goodies from 1954 to
1964.
The hour long medley of at
least 40 songs included Beach Boy
Hits like "Fun Fun Fun" and
"Surfer Girl," with many others
like "My Little Runnaway,"
"Jonny Angel," "Paradise Up
Above," and "Go Johnny Go."
For almost two hours,
non-stop, the Carpenters sang not
only their well known tunes but
also great songs of the Beatles and
even an oldie by Jerry Lee Lewis,
"Great Balls of Fire."
The brother and sister team,
originally from Connecticut,
introduced their new album which
should hit the record stores this
week. It is titled "Now and Then"
and features their new hits "Sing"

and "Jamboliyah."
The Abbott Elementary School
Choir, all twenty members, rushed
on stage to sing the
accompaniment for the new
million seller "Sing." The
beautifully groomed students sang
to wild applause.
The neatly attired Carpenters
projected a wholesome and highly
spirited image. Richard had a
yellow bow tie to match his
yellow pullover sweater as well as
a cast on his broken wrist, but it
did not affect his playing the
electric piano.
When Karen was sixteen she
became nationally known for her
skills as a female drummer. She
played the drums and sang at the
same time until she began singing
solos of slow tunes like "Why
Does the Sun Keep on Shining."
Every time the Carpenters
started to sing a million seller like
"Rainy Days and Mondays," the
audience applauded wildly,
forcing them to pause a while.
Their harmony and delightful
melodies were exciting to listen
to.
The only disappointment of
the show was that the band often
drowned out Karen's beautiful
voice. The stage was cluttered
with amps and microphones and
the noise of the electric clarinets
and electric sax detracted from
the melodic harmonies of the
Carpenters.
The evening concluded with
their first million copy seller and
the song that they are best known
for, "We've Only Just Begun."
The audience twice gave the
Carpenters a well deserved
standing ovation.
This amazing concert will be
hard to top. Every one of the
Carpenters' songs stays with you
long after you have heard it.
Next week, coming to the
Circle Star will be Sergio Mendes
and Brazil '77. For information or
