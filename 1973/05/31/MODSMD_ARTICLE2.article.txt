# Court Injunction Halts Antioch Strike Activities
## 
### JAMES LOBSENZ 
The Greene County, Ohio,
Municipal Court yesterday granted an
injunction barring further strike
activities at Antioch College in Yellow
Springs. Antioch has been closed since
April 20, due to a strike by about 300
students.
The strikers have demanded that
Antioch guarantee a steady level of
financial support through all
undergraduate years to all students
receiving financial aid.
Antioch is presently one of the
nation's few colleges to grant financial
aid in two-year, rather than one-year,
packages. The college administration
maintains that it would be impossible
to grant aid on a four-year basis
because the school depends on federal
funding for its financial aid program.
Four Antioch students opposing
the strike yesterday obtained the
injunction which outlaws obstructing
entrances to college buildings and
preventing professors from holding
classes.
Conflict Expected
A spokesman for the Antioch
Record, the campus newspaper, said
the injunction, granted by Judge
Daniel Aultman, is expected to be
served either this morning or this
afternoon. Conflict between strikers
and police is expected.
A steering committee of the
student strikers met yesterday
afternoon to discuss resistance to
enforcement of the injunction.
Sheriff Russell Bradley, the officer
to be in charge of possible police
action, was described by the Record
spokesman as "having wanted to get
onto this campus for the last five or
six years."
Position 'Unclear'
The college administration opposed
the injunction and sought to prevent
police from taking up the matter. Now
that the injunction has been obtained,
the Record describes the
administration's position as "unclear."
College administrators attempted to
reoccupy their office buildings May 22
but were repulsed by a crowd of about
230 student demonstrators. The
administrators, led by Ewell Reagin,
interim dean of the college, were
confronted with a hail of eggs and
abuse. The Record described the
conflict as "non-violent."
The following day the college sent
letters of expulsion to 20 students and

seven faculty members who were
supporting the strike.
Promises, Promises
Though college officials promised
another attempt to reoccupy the
campus, they have made no attempt.
They also promised that their letters
of expulsion would be followed by
"many more," but have not yet made
good their threat.
Negotiations between college
administrators and strikers ceased May
11. Strikers requested yesterday,
however, that negotiations via an
outside middleman be resumed. The
college administration refused.
This is not the first time Antioch
has been plagued by student disorders.
Last winter students struck for six
weeks in support of cafeteria workers
who had been laid off.
'Experiment In Anarchy'
One faculty member, quoted by
Time Magazine, called Antioch "one
of the leading colleges in the country"
in the 1950'5. "Now," he said, "it is an
experiment in anarchy."
Under President James P. Dixon,
Antioch has gained a reputation as one

of the country's most avant-garde
institutions of higher education. It has
abolished grades and embarked on a
program called "New Directions,"
designed to recruit larger numbers of
poor students.
Initiated in 1970, the program
offered financial aid to these students
to help defray the cost of Antioch's
$3,050 tuition. About 10 percent of
Antioch's students have been recruited
through the program.
$600,000 Deficit
To compound its problems,
Antioch has been unable to hire a dean
of the college for a year. In addition,
the college, which depends on tuition
for 85 percent of its income, has
operated at a $600,000 deficit over
the last year.
(By comparison, about 25 percent
of Stanford's operating revenue comes
from tuition.)
Antioch has a total enrollment of
about 2300 students, though only
1100 attend school in Yellow Springs.
The rest are scattered across the nation
and around the globe at some 25 study
centers.

from tuition.)
Antioch has a total enrollment of
about 2300 students, though only
1100 attend school in Yellow Springs.
The rest are scattered across the nation
and around the globe at some 25 study
centers.
The Greene County, Ohio,
Municipal Court yesterday granted an
injunction barring further strike
activities at Antioch College in Yellow
Springs. Antioch has been closed since
April 20, due to a strike by about 300
students.
The strikers have demanded that
Antioch guarantee a steady level of
financial support through all
undergraduate years to all students
receiving financial aid.
Antioch is presently one of the
nation's few colleges to grant financial
aid in two-year, rather than one-year,
packages. The college administration
maintains that it would be impossible
to grant aid on a four-year basis
because the school depends on federal
funding for its financial aid program.
Four Antioch students opposing
the strike yesterday obtained the
injunction which outlaws obstructing
entrances to college buildings and
preventing professors from holding
classes.
Conflict Expected
A spokesman for the Antioch
Record, the campus newspaper, said
the injunction, granted by Judge
Daniel Aultman, is expected to be
served either this morning or this
afternoon. Conflict between strikers
and police is expected.
A steering committee of the
student strikers met yesterday
afternoon to discuss resistance to
enforcement of the injunction.
Sheriff Russell Bradley, the officer
to be in charge of possible police
action, was described by the Record
spokesman as "having wanted to get
onto this campus for the last five or
six years."
Position 'Unclear'
The college administration opposed
the injunction and sought to prevent
police from taking up the matter. Now
that the injunction has been obtained,
the Record describes the
administration's position as "unclear."
College administrators attempted to
reoccupy their office buildings May 22
but were repulsed by a crowd of about
230 student demonstrators. The
administrators, led by Ewell Reagin,
interim dean of the college, were
confronted with a hail of eggs and
abuse. The Record described the
conflict as "non-violent."
The following day the college sent
letters of expulsion to 20 students and

seven faculty members who were
supporting the strike.
Promises, Promises
Though college officials promised
another attempt to reoccupy the
campus, they have made no attempt.
They also promised that their letters
of expulsion would be followed by
"many more," but have not yet made
good their threat.
Negotiations between college
administrators and strikers ceased May
11. Strikers requested yesterday,
however, that negotiations via an
outside middleman be resumed. The
college administration refused.
This is not the first time Antioch
has been plagued by student disorders.
Last winter students struck for six
weeks in support of cafeteria workers
who had been laid off.
'Experiment In Anarchy'
One faculty member, quoted by
Time Magazine, called Antioch "one
of the leading colleges in the country"
in the 1950'5. "Now," he said, "it is an
experiment in anarchy."
Under President James P. Dixon,
Antioch has gained a reputation as one

of the country's most avant-garde
institutions of higher education. It has
abolished grades and embarked on a
program called "New Directions,"
designed to recruit larger numbers of
poor students.
Initiated in 1970, the program
offered financial aid to these students
to help defray the cost of Antioch's
$3,050 tuition. About 10 percent of
Antioch's students have been recruited
through the program.
$600,000 Deficit
To compound its problems,
Antioch has been unable to hire a dean
of the college for a year. In addition,
the college, which depends on tuition
for 85 percent of its income, has
operated at a $600,000 deficit over
the last year.
(By comparison, about 25 percent
of Stanford's operating revenue comes
from tuition.)
