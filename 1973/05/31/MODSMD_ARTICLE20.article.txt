# Bluesman Lightnin' Hopkins Makes Rare S.F. Appearance
## 
### DAN FORTE 
There are so many superlative
titles floating around these days
that very few of them really mean
anything. But, I'm sure that if a
poll were taken with only
musicians voting, Lightnin'
Hopkins would be declared "The
Greatest Living Bluesman."
Last week Lightnin' made one
of his all-too-rare Bay Area
appearances at The Boarding
House in San Francisco.
Also on the bill was the Cecil
Barnard Trio, a local jazz group.

The trio consisted of Barnard on
piano, Lenny White on drums,
and Bill Douglas on string bass.
Their thirty minute set was
monotonous, because the group
desperately lacked a dynamic
soloist. It was as though their
tenor sax player was out of town;
even the solo breaks sounded like
background music.
I was very disappointed to see
that the drummer and bassist were
staying on to back up Lightnin'
Hopkins; not because they were
bad musicians, but because
Hopkins is at his best when he is
by himself. In fact, during the set
Lightnin' was continuously
hampered by his sidemen
"dragging along," as he put it.
Another thing that kept
Lightnin' from playing in top
form was his amplifier. This was
the fault of the Boarding House.
Lightnin' complained about the
sound all evening, and not one
technician offered any assistance.
The main elements lacking in
Lightnin's set, aside from the
sound difficulties, were the lack
of variety in his material, and the
lack of vocals.
On songs such as "Mighty
Crazy," Lightnin' seemed content
to jive around with the audience,
rather than do what he is best at,
play the guitar. When Hopkins did

stretch out with a guitar lead he
proved to be as sharp as ever, but
this happened only a couple of
times.
Lightnin' played a lot of songs
made famous by other blues
singers, such as: Little Walter's
"My Babe," Ray Charles' "What'd
I Say," Big Boy Crudup's "Rock
Me Mama," "Sitting On Top Of
The World" (recorded by
everyone from Doc Watson to the
Grateful Dead), and Blind Lemon
Jefferson's "I'm Black And I'm
Evil":
"/ went to church last night,
they called on me to pray.
I fell down on my bended
knee, poor Lightnin' forgot just
what to say."
Lightnin' closed with a nice
fast boogie instrumental, "Move
On Out."
However, the highlight of the
evening came downstairs, eating
dinner while listening to the
Boarding House's fine pianist,
David Paquette.
Paquette plays pure honky
tonk-style ragtime, including such
masterpieces as Jelly Roll
Morton's "Doctor Jazz" and
"Shimmeshewabble," and Fats
Waller's "Honeysuckle Rose."
Someday I hope the Boarding
House will move him upstairs so
he can get the recognition he
deserves.

titles floating around these days
that very few of them really mean
anything. But, I'm sure that if a
poll were taken with only
musicians voting, Lightnin'
Hopkins would be declared "The
Greatest Living Bluesman."
Last week Lightnin' made one
of his all-too-rare Bay Area
appearances at The Boarding
House in San Francisco.
Also on the bill was the Cecil
Barnard Trio, a local jazz group.

The trio consisted of Barnard on
piano, Lenny White on drums,
and Bill Douglas on string bass.
Their thirty minute set was
monotonous, because the group
desperately lacked a dynamic
soloist. It was as though their
tenor sax player was out of town;
even the solo breaks sounded like
background music.
I was very disappointed to see
that the drummer and bassist were
staying on to back up Lightnin'
Hopkins; not because they were
bad musicians, but because
Hopkins is at his best when he is
by himself. In fact, during the set
Lightnin' was continuously
hampered by his sidemen
"dragging along," as he put it.
Another thing that kept
Lightnin' from playing in top
form was his amplifier. This was
the fault of the Boarding House.
Lightnin' complained about the
sound all evening, and not one
technician offered any assistance.
The main elements lacking in
Lightnin's set, aside from the
sound difficulties, were the lack
of variety in his material, and the
lack of vocals.
On songs such as "Mighty
Crazy," Lightnin' seemed content
to jive around with the audience,
rather than do what he is best at,
play the guitar. When Hopkins did

stretch out with a guitar lead he
proved to be as sharp as ever, but
this happened only a couple of
times.
Lightnin' played a lot of songs
made famous by other blues
singers, such as: Little Walter's
"My Babe," Ray Charles' "What'd
I Say," Big Boy Crudup's "Rock
Me Mama," "Sitting On Top Of
The World" (recorded by
everyone from Doc Watson to the
Grateful Dead), and Blind Lemon
Jefferson's "I'm Black And I'm
Evil":
"/ went to church last night,
they called on me to pray.
I fell down on my bended
knee, poor Lightnin' forgot just
what to say."
Lightnin' closed with a nice
fast boogie instrumental, "Move
On Out."
However, the highlight of the
evening came downstairs, eating
dinner while listening to the
Boarding House's fine pianist,
David Paquette.
Paquette plays pure honky
tonk-style ragtime, including such
masterpieces as Jelly Roll
Morton's "Doctor Jazz" and
"Shimmeshewabble," and Fats
Waller's "Honeysuckle Rose."
Someday I hope the Boarding
House will move him upstairs so
he can get the recognition he
deserves.
