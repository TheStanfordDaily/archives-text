THE POLITICS OF LYING:
Government Deception, Secrecy,
and Power — by David Wise
New York, Random House
415 pages, $8.95
"Government deception,
supported by a pervasive system
of official secrecy and an
enormous public relations
machine, has reaped a harvest of

massive public distrust [which]
has diminished our confidence in
ourselves and in our ability as a
people to overcome the problems
that confront us."
As he wrote these words, David
Wise could not have foreseen the
significant decline in government
credibility caused by Watergate.
Despite President Nixon's
repreated statements that he had

no knowledge of the cover-up of
the Watergate scandal, a recent
Time magazine survey found that
only 25 percent of the electorate
believed him. 58 percent said they
did not believe their president.
A Gallup poll conducted early
this month disclosed that 58
percent of the American people
said Watergate scandal
reduced [their] confidence in the

federal government as an
institution." Recent disclosures
have probably reduced their
confidence even further.
What Wise calls "the frequent
gulf between [the President's]
words and reality" has been
widened greatly by Watergate. But
Wise probably would say the
Nixon administration's efforts to
conceal the truth were inevitable.
According to Wise, most federal
officials now believe that they
have what a Pentagon spokesman
once called the "inherent . . .
right ... to lie."
In a series of sometimes
surprising examples, Wise reveals
that the government's
overenthusiastic use of the
classification system has made it
easier to deceive or lie to the
electorate. According to Wise, "a
conservative estimate of the total
number of classified documents in
active government files would be
well over 100,000,000."
After classification as Secret or
Top Secret, these documents
usually remain perpetually
concealed from the people. Wise
and others contend that
opponents of government policies

have only one alternative, theft, if
they wish to learn the truth about
these policies and their
formulation.
According to "The Politics of
Lying," federal officials deceive
the public in order to preserve
their own power. But since
ambition "would not be a seemly
rationale for official deception,"
these so-called public servants rely
upon the invoking of national
security, "the end that justifies all
means."
President Nixon demonstrated
the accuracy of Wise's observation
last week when he admitted
authorizing "wide-ranging efforts"
to conceal certain matters related
to the Watergate scandal. Nixon
said: "I considered it my
responsibility to see that the
Watergate investigation did not
impinge adversely upon the
national security area."
Lest anyone indict the Nixon
administration alone, it should be
remembered that the "right to
lie" was claimed by a ranking
official in John F. Kennedy's
"New Frontier" government.
Wise, who served for three
years as Washington Bureau Chief
for the now-defunct New York

Herald Tribune, brilliantly
analyzes the relationship between
the press and government,
devoting considerable attention to
the Nixon administration.
The author ties government
attempts to suppress or intimidate
the press to its simultaneous
efforts at concealment through
secrecy and deception. He points
out that the Nixon administration
has undertaken a concerted
campaign against the free press.
Nixon's Justice Qepartiven:
became the first to attempt pror
restraint against newspapers whin
it sought to suppress publication
of the Pentagon Papers. Nixon's
vice president has blatantly sought
to. force more favorable coverage
of the administration from what

he calls the "seaboard media."
Wise believes that these efforts
to intimidate or discredit the
press, combined with the
assembling of a huge public
relations machine, are intended to
raise the credibility of the
administration at the expense of
the media.
Watergate aside, Wise
demonstrates that the credibility
gap has become a chasm of
startling proportions. The press
and the public have become more
skeptical of everything the
£0/ernment says, and rightfully
so.
Whether Vietnam and
Watergate and a thousand other
lies will produce efforts to close
the chasm remains to be seen.

THE POLITICS OF LYING:
Government Deception, Secrecy,
and Power — by David Wise
New York, Random House
415 pages, $8.95
"Government deception,
supported by a pervasive system
of official secrecy and an
enormous public relations
machine, has reaped a harvest of

massive public distrust [which]
has diminished our confidence in
ourselves and in our ability as a
people to overcome the problems
that confront us."
As he wrote these words, David
Wise could not have foreseen the
significant decline in government
credibility caused by Watergate.
Despite President Nixon's
repreated statements that he had

no knowledge of the cover-up of
the Watergate scandal, a recent
Time magazine survey found that
only 25 percent of the electorate
believed him. 58 percent said they
did not believe their president.
A Gallup poll conducted early
this month disclosed that 58
percent of the American people
said Watergate scandal
reduced [their] confidence in the

federal government as an
institution." Recent disclosures
have probably reduced their
confidence even further.
What Wise calls "the frequent
gulf between [the President's]
words and reality" has been
widened greatly by Watergate. But
Wise probably would say the
Nixon administration's efforts to
conceal the truth were inevitable.
According to Wise, most federal
officials now believe that they
have what a Pentagon spokesman
once called the "inherent . . .
right ... to lie."
In a series of sometimes
surprising examples, Wise reveals
that the government's
overenthusiastic use of the
classification system has made it
easier to deceive or lie to the
electorate. According to Wise, "a
conservative estimate of the total
number of classified documents in
active government files would be
well over 100,000,000."
After classification as Secret or
Top Secret, these documents
usually remain perpetually
concealed from the people. Wise
and others contend that
opponents of government policies

have only one alternative, theft, if
they wish to learn the truth about
these policies and their
formulation.
According to "The Politics of
Lying," federal officials deceive
the public in order to preserve
their own power. But since
ambition "would not be a seemly
rationale for official deception,"
these so-called public servants rely
upon the invoking of national
security, "the end that justifies all
means."
