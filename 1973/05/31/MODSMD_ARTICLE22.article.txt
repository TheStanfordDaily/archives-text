STATE OF SIEGE
Directed by Constatin Costa-Gavras
Screenplay by Franco Solinas
Constatin Costa-Gavras' new film "State of
Siege" is a carefully researched polemical
documentation of the assassination of a kidnapped
United States A.I.D. official by the Tuparamo
guerillas in Uruguay. Dan A. Mitrione was executed
on August 11, 1970 by the Marxist revolutionaries
when the Uruguayan government refused to
concede to their demands to release 150 political
prisoners.
"State of Siege" attempts to examine the
political events that resulted in the terrorists'
decision to murder the official and to reveal their
motives for having captured him in the first place.
The French director seized this event as a
potentially effective means to expose, if not
denounce, American imperialist practices in Third
World countries.
Yves Montand plays the role of Mitrione, whose
name in the film has been changed to Philip
Santore. Santore's A.I.D. connections serve as a
coverup for his clandestine job of advisor to the
Uruguayan special police in matters dealing with
terrorist groups like the Tuparamos.
Once they have kidnapped Santore, the leftist
guerillas begin a well-informed interrogation session
with him that reveals his past role in training special
police in explosives and torture tactics.
Flashback
In a poignant scene, we witness a flashback of a
torture session in which a victim is given electrical
shocks on the genitals, eyeballs and gums. We are
also meant to see Santore's link with police action
that machine-guns down suspected guerillas and
defenseless trade union workers.
Given an ultimatum from the Tuparamos, the
Uruguayan government, apparently backed by that
of the United States, refuses to consent to releasing
the prisoners in exchange for Santore's life. The
Tuparamos, who do not desire bloodshed but
simply to make a point, are reluctantly forced to

decide in favor of killing Santore.
Their decision is a difficult one,for theywill be
impotent if they do not murder the official and
malicious if they do.
Franco Solinas, screenwriter for "Battle of
Algiers," wrote the gravely serious script which
seeks to avoid a simplification of the situation.
Following the complex script, the film is intricately
edited in a fast-moving series of flashbacks upon
flashbacks that often confused past with present.
Costa-Gavras' photography in "State of Siege"
bears a close resemblance to that of his film "Z,"
released in 1970 and the recipient of the New York
Film Critics Best Picture of the Year award. Many
shots intend to have a newsreel documentary
quality, taken as if by an impartial observer on a
streetcorner or building near the scene of the action.
Filmmaker's Bias
True to the sympathies of the filmmaker, the
Tuparamos are portrayed invariably as intelligent,
dedicated professionals whose goals are to install a
new revolutionary, though vaguely defined, order of
government.
The handsome Jean-Luc Bideau plays one of
Santore's persistent inquisitors and heads the
terrorist group when other leaders are seized by the
police, who have been combing over every home in
the Capital by the truckload.
United States officials and ex-diplomats have
denounced "State of Siege" as "anti-American" and
as rationalizing political terrorism, and it was
banned from its premier showing at the American
Film Institute in Washington D.C.
The film, however, does not condemn America,
it condemns instead American practices of political
manipulation and subversion in the name of
international aid and peace. It does not extoll
terrorism but instead points to its inherent problems
and necessary justifications.
Surely "State of Siege" is a political film with a
message, a message that hopes to reach out and
convince people that more questions should be
asked and, if necessary, more action be taken toward
establishing a better, more just order among men.
