## Daily Sports Rags To Riches 
### Hall Daily 
WINTER-SPRING 1971 — Sometimes even a well-turned phrase can't
save a sports season. Dick Gould was becoming "cautiously
optimistic" about the tennis team's chances against the LA
powerhouses. Howie Dallmar was trying to figure out how to win
when Claude Terry was being double-teamed. And wrestling coach
Dave Reed was praying for pacifist opponents.
The year opened with Stanford's first Rose Bowl victory in two
decades, thus marking an end to the Hal Mikkelson racoon coat days.
Nowadays, the band announcer is no longer a George Murphy-loving
school president but a pornography columnist for the Daily.
Out Of Their League
Back then though, uniformed Stanford sportsmen and women were
drawing fewer fans than their sandlot counterparts. The best arms and
legs on campus were redshirted that year and scrimmaged against
teams like the Santa Clara County Tamms, the LSJU Trustees and the
Administration Lackeys. The ROTC squad sat out the season,
awaiting appeal on their suspension charges.
Meanwhile on the playing fields, UCLA and USC dominated the
Pac-8 conference in water polo, swimming, basketball, baseball, track,
and tennis. Some people on the street still believe that had it not been
for Rick Massimino, Brian Job, Claude Terry, Rod Boone, Duncan
Mac Donald and Roscoe Tanner — who knows, maybe The Revolution
might have succeeded.
Be that as it may, Richard Nixon is still calling the signals from the
White House, and Troy's big horses and UCLA's wooden winners still
face only perfunctory competitive sports schedules — with one
glorious exception. Stanford is the only team in its league with a
chance every year to dethrone the SoCal titleholders in any given
sport.
The Farm clubs have enjoyed significant success in football and
tennis of late, but it would appear to season record watchers that this
enjoyment is short-lived. Not so.
National Power
Old rivalries between Stanford and USC in football and UCLA in
basketball are on the rise both on the campuses and in the press, and
no longer is the rivalry fed by the vindictiveness of the coaches, the
alleged poor sportsmanship of the players or the inflamatory hoots
and hollers of the respective fans. It is because Stanford has become a
national sports power — finally and duly recognized by a stodgy
national sports press — that perennial super-teams like USC and UCLA
readily acknowledge their apprehensions about competing against
Stanford.
However, the most significant aspect of athletics these days on this
campus is that students are enjoying these spectacles as the fiercely
competitive games that they were meant to be. Perspective has never
been an easy commodity to acquire — much less retain — but any
athletic department that survies and succeeds with men as diverse as
Payton Jordan and Dan Millman at the helm does the student-athlete
and the student-spectator a great service.

basketball are on the rise both on the campuses and in the press, and
no longer is the rivalry fed by the vindictiveness of the coaches, the
alleged poor sportsmanship of the players or the inflamatory hoots
and hollers of the respective fans. It is because Stanford has become a
national sports power — finally and duly recognized by a stodgy
national sports press — that perennial super-teams like USC and UCLA
readily acknowledge their apprehensions about competing against
Stanford.
However, the most significant aspect of athletics these days on this
campus is that students are enjoying these spectacles as the fiercely
competitive games that they were meant to be. Perspective has never
been an easy commodity to acquire — much less retain — but any
athletic department that survies and succeeds with men as diverse as
Payton Jordan and Dan Millman at the helm does the student-athlete
and the student-spectator a great service.

WINTER-SPRING 1971 — Sometimes even a well-turned phrase can't
save a sports season. Dick Gould was becoming "cautiously
optimistic" about the tennis team's chances against the LA
powerhouses. Howie Dallmar was trying to figure out how to win
when Claude Terry was being double-teamed. And wrestling coach
Dave Reed was praying for pacifist opponents.
The year opened with Stanford's first Rose Bowl victory in two
decades, thus marking an end to the Hal Mikkelson racoon coat days.
Nowadays, the band announcer is no longer a George Murphy-loving
school president but a pornography columnist for the Daily.
Out Of Their League
Back then though, uniformed Stanford sportsmen and women were
drawing fewer fans than their sandlot counterparts. The best arms and
legs on campus were redshirted that year and scrimmaged against
teams like the Santa Clara County Tamms, the LSJU Trustees and the
Administration Lackeys. The ROTC squad sat out the season,
awaiting appeal on their suspension charges.
Meanwhile on the playing fields, UCLA and USC dominated the
Pac-8 conference in water polo, swimming, basketball, baseball, track,
and tennis. Some people on the street still believe that had it not been
for Rick Massimino, Brian Job, Claude Terry, Rod Boone, Duncan
Mac Donald and Roscoe Tanner — who knows, maybe The Revolution
might have succeeded.
Be that as it may, Richard Nixon is still calling the signals from the
White House, and Troy's big horses and UCLA's wooden winners still
face only perfunctory competitive sports schedules — with one
glorious exception. Stanford is the only team in its league with a
chance every year to dethrone the SoCal titleholders in any given
sport.
The Farm clubs have enjoyed significant success in football and
tennis of late, but it would appear to season record watchers that this
enjoyment is short-lived. Not so.
National Power
