## Fair Share For Females 
### Mike Chasson 
Every year billions of United
States dollars are invested in
athletic programs with the belief
that games are good for people,
developing minds and bodies. In
the last few months the fact that
women are not gaining their fair
share of the investment is
becoming more publicized.
The most recent cases involve a
girl being barred from
participating in a Little League
program in Michigan and a girl
barred from participating in a high
school athletic program in Santa
Cruz. In the first case the league
chapter was faced with losing its
charter if the female played and
the Santa Cruz case resulted in
girls being permitted to
participate in any sport in
California high schools next year.
Sports Illustrated is currently
running a three part series on how
sports are unfair to women. The
first installment dealt with how
much money is put into male
athletic programs compared to
female programs at high schools
and colleges across the country, as
well as the disparity in prize
money in pro sports.
In five major collegiate athletic
conferences — Southeastern, Big
Ten, Big Eight, Southwest, and
Pacific Eight — there are 5,000
males on football scholarships
alone. The article points out that
these scholarships are worth some
$10 million a year. Women are
almost totally excluded from this
money.
Sports Illustrated states that
50,000 men a year earn a college
education through athletics while
less than 50 women gain the same
benefits.
Mountain View Tennis
The article uses a local tennis
tournament as one example of
how money is divided on many
pro athletic circuits that involve
both men and women. In the
recently completed Mountain,
View Tennis Tournament both
men and women pay the same
entry fee of eight dollars with an
equal number of men and women
competing.
When it comes to prize money,
however, the difference is
substantial.
At Mountain View the men's
singles winner receives $1000, the
runner-up $500, the semifinal
losers $150 each, quarterfinal
losers $75 each, and the round of
16 losers $25 each. On the other
hand the women's winner receives
$150, the runner-up $50 and no
other prize money is allocated.
There is also doubles competition
for men, but not for women.
The article also included some
interesting quotes from various
men on what place women should

have in athletics. A football coach
in Wisconsin stated, "I think girls
have a right to participate but to a
lesser degree than boys. If they go
too far with the competitive stuff
they lose their femininity. I guess
if I had my choice I'd like to keep
boy's sports going up in
importance and let the girls stay
about where they are now."
'In The Home'
Russel Knipp, a weightlifter on
the United States Olympic team,
upon learning that Olga Connolly
was to be the flag bearer in
Munich said, "The flag-bearer
ought to be a man, a strong man,
a warrior. A women's place is in
the home."
One area where women really
get the short end of the stick is
publicity. Articles about women's
sports are generally few and far
between in the media with the
story usually discussing the color
of the girl's hair, the shape of her
legs, or the size of her bust.
Usually only the girls considered
the best looking by the press gain
the publicity. One can always read
of Chris Elvert no matter how
badly she does in a tennis
tournament.
At Stanford the situation is no
better for women than in any
other area of the country. Women
have limited facilities compared to
the men, and a fraction of the
financial support. Publicity is
scarce for female events even in
the Daily.
Information on women's
athletic events is hard to gain as
the women don't have a Sports
Information Director to keep the
media informed.
In most cases to gain women's
athletic schedules and results the
sports editor must seek it out,
while every day he receives reams
of material on men's sports.
Women usually only rate
articles in campus publications if
they are involved in something
out of the ordinary like the recent
articles on female coxswains. You
never see feature articles on a
female field hockey player, like
you would a football player, even
though she may be better in her
sport than he is in his.
Deserves Funding
The Athletic Director has
spoken in the past of how the
athletic department would try to
help the women's athletic
department with finances and
facilities. All we hear about,
however, is that women can now
swim in the men's gym pool. The
time has now come for the men's
athletic department to "take in"
the woman's department and give
it the funding it deserves
The athletic department is
already funding numerous sports

that make no more money than
any women's athletic event
would. Since women do exist at
the University and do attend
football games, which is the key
money-making sport, it is only
fair they receive a greater share of
the money.
If the University was serious
about giving women a fair shake
they would form a new
Department of Athletics that
would be in control of all sports
for both males and females. At
the same time they would create a
new Department of Physical
Education which would have
predominantly coed classes, both
female and male instructors, and a
common building with male and
female dressing areas.
Considering how long it took
before women could swim in the
men's pool, it may be awhile
before women get the money and
facilities they deserve at Stanford.
