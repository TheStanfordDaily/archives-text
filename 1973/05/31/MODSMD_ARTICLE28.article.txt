# Whad'ya Hear, Whad'ya Say
## A 						Cardinal Sin 
### Charlie Hoffman 
A few weeks ago, San
Francisco Chronicle sports writer
Darrell Wilson slipped up in an
article and referred to a Stanford
athlete as an Indian. Unless you
read sports articles carefully to
catch these errors or listen to
Stanford's Sports Information
Director Bob Murphy broadcast
football games, you could not tell
that the Indian had ever been the
University's mascot.
This is all for the better
because there is no sense in
extending the controversy further.
The Indian is dead as Stanford's
mascot and should remain that
way. The only mascot change that
would be welcome now would be
a switch to something a little
more colorful and unique than
Cardinal. People are afraid to
initiate a search for a new mascot
for fear of digging up the Indian
issue again.
I did a lot of writing last winter
and spring quarters about the
Indian mascot issue and fought
bitterly for due process.

Unfortunately, many people
(myself included) lost sight of the
key issues after awhile and turned
instead to the ridiculous manner
in which the Indian was desposed.
My initial question of whether the
Indian mascot could in any
manner be an asset to Native
Americans on campus was never
answered and the issue was
smothered by the ensuing months
of political dirty-dealing.
If the Indian mascot truly
offends people on campus, then it
should not be the school's
representative. I do not dispute
this now.
The way in which the whole
affair was handled still troubles
me however. ASSU Co-President
Doug McHenry took a legal
petition with over 600 signatures
calling for a vote on whether to
retain or abolish the Indian
mascot,and put it in his desk and
ignored it. This action directly
violated the laws by which he was
bound.
When the new ASSU
Co-President Scott Burke allowed
the issue to come to a vote last
spring, over 60 percent of the
students voting supported the
Indian as Stanford's mascot.
Although this was the same
margin by which Burke and his
co-presidents were elected, the
mascot vote was termed
"advisory" and non-binding.
In retrospect, it would have
been far more beneficial to discuss
the substantive issues in the
Indian mascot question.
Is it right to have racial and
ethnic groups represent
universities as mascots? Could
Native Americans here use the
Indian mascot to educate people
about the Indians' plight? Or does
an Indian mascot effectively block
avenues of education and make a
mockery of Native Americans?
We all could have profited
from a discussion of these
questions. But all sectors of the
community acted foolishly and
blocked serious discussion. The
Native Americans on campus
refused to grace the discussion
with comment. Student and
University administrators did their
best to bury the issue as quickly
as possible, ignoring a few
principles of due process along the
way.
