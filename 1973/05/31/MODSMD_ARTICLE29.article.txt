# Shuffling The Cards
## Press Book Babblings 
### Dave Robinson 
According to the University of Oregon basketball
press jjuide, sophomore center Burt Frederickson
"knows what he can do and what he can't do and
plays within himself well, especially for a young
player."
Washington's football press book analyzes
defensive end Dave Morgan's future by saying, "All
he needs to be one of the best in the nation is more
mental consistency."
And West Virginia offensive tackle Dan Larcamp
is described by the Mountaineer football press guide
in the following terms: "He has all the tools to be a
top offensive linemen — he's big, fast, intelligent,
and has character."
Those three statements are all examples of the
pinnacle of stereotyped sporting journalism — the
press guides compiled by sports information
directors at college athletic departments. Although
magazines and newspapers (even the Daily) are
certainly not innocent of excessive use of sporting
cliches, the glowing verbiage in press books is
unmatched for its color, exaggeration, and
consequent humor.
Often the adjectives in press guides seem to be
lifted directly from 1920 Knute Rockne halftime
speeches. According to the Stanford basketball
book, forward Dave Frost is "a gutty, come-through
performer" and Steve Shupe's "determination and
extra-effort type of hustle can be contagious to his
teammates."
Since public relations men are paid to build up
athletes — not to criticize — even the lowliest
members of collegiate squads are described in lofty
terms. The typical benchwarmer is never clumsy,
small, slow, or weak. Instead he "could be a
pleasant surprise," "has all the tools,'' is
"dedicated," "inspire ional," "a real competitor,"

or "a fine, hard-working young man."
The West Virginia press book's evaluation of
reserve tight end Dave Jadgmann is classic. "He's a
real 'try guy' ... his desire overcomes any lack of
ability," words which probably brought proud
maternal tears to Mrs. Jadgmann's eyes.
Sometimes press books can provide subtle hints
about a team's personality. Oregon's basketball
team, known throughout the Pac-8 season as the
roughest squad in the league, may have been the
manifestation of freshman Jeff Nelson's boyhood
dreams. "Jeff would like to enter the law
enforcement field following graduation," wrote the
Oregon press guide, exposing one possible reason for
the Ducks' notorious aggressive tendencies.
Of course not all press writing is insightful or
humorous — some of it is genuinely informative.
How else would one find out that Stanford
offensive tackle Reuben Monmouth is "the best
piano player on the squad" or that Ohio State
defensive tackle is not only a "sure tackier" but also
has "seven sisters and his hobby is collecting coins."
The UCLA basketball press book, which features
69 pages of statistics, profiles, and acomplete,
informative, and fascinating history of the Bruin
basketball program, was voted "Best in the Nation"
by the Basketball Brochure Awards Committee of
the U.S. Basketball Writer's Association.
But even the compilers of the UCLA press guide
occasionally got carried away. "Swen Nater," the
book reads in a burst of alliterative imagination, "is
an exceptionally potent, point-producing
pivotman."
And I just can't say enough about that
statement.
