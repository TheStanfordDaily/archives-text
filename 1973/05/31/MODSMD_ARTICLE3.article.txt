# Delts Must Vacate Residence During Two Year Suspension
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
The University yesterday suspended
the Delta Tau Delta fraternity from
campus for two years, but officials
said the fraternity could regain its
residence after one year provided that
it had halted its misconduct.
The Delts will retain all other
privileges of a voluntary organization
on campus.
Residents of nearby houses,
including Synergy and the Theta Xi
fraternity, had complained to the

University frequently since January
about Delt members throwing rocks
and bottles through windows and
firing pellet guns at parked cars.
Associate Dean of Student Affairs
Larry Horton said he met for more
than two hours Tuesday night with
Dean James Lyons, Director of
Fraternities Norman Robinson, and
Special Assistant to the President John
Schwartz, and that they had
"unaninously agreed that our
judgment [about suspension] was a

correct one."
Horton, Lyons and Robinson had
met with representatives of Delta Tau
Delta Tuesday morning to discuss the
situation and again yesterday morning
to inform them of the suspension
decision.
'Dedication'
Delt House Adviser Marty Wilson
said the chances are "very good" that
the suspension will last only one year.
Horton said he was "deeply impressed
with the dedication" of the alumni
officers, including Wilson, and added
that their dedication made a one-year
suspension more probable.
However, Horton cautioned that
shortening the suspension period was
"not an automatic thing."
He said the University plans "to
pump about $75,000 or more into the
place [the Delt house] for renovations
this summer. If at all possible, we will
house other people there" this coming
autumn. He emphasized that "no
current member or pledges of Delta
Tau Delta would live there."
No Anti-Frat Move
Horton emphasized that "there is no
movement against fraternities,"
referring to the suspension of the Delts
and the recently-announced one-year
probation period for the Phi Delta
Theta fraternity.
However, Horton added that
"people don't pay much attention to
what you're saying until something
dramatic happens." Regarding the Delt
suspension, he said "if anything, the
University can be accused of
extraordinary leniency."
Delta Tau Delta house president
Brad Williams said that it will be "very
hard to get this house back on its feet
after two years." He called the
suspension "frustrating, disappointing
and unwarranted in lieu of the changes
we've made."
'Petty Bullshit'
Wilson said Delt officers had told
Horton that "the attitudes
produced these acts would be dea
with at the beginning of next year."
Wilson called the incidents of
misconduct "petty bullshit taken
individually."
He added that "you're always going
to have that type of [rowdy] person
on campus and the way to deal with
them is directly and individually." not
collectively as members of a living
unit.
However, Wilson acknowledged
that it was "the house officers' fault"
for not disciplining individual
improper actions at the time they
occurred.
Officer Responsibility
Horton said the house officers
"determine who lives there and for
that reason they have greater
responsibility for the individual
actions" of the members. In cases such
as these, Horton said it would be
"fatuous" not to punish the fraternity.
The most recent complaint against
the Delts was filed Tuesday, May 22
by Synergy residents who charged that
several Delts had thrown a rock
through a Synergy window, narrowly
missing a woman who had been
studying there.
Asked whether this incident
produced the suspension decision,
Horton said "we were looking at the
entire picture and that was just the
tiniest footnote."
Williams said that although "we've
always fessed up to what we've done,"
all the Delts who had been in town on
the evening of this incident denied any
responsibility for it.
