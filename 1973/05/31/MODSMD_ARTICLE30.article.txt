# Tolly's Follies
## Women Deserve A Break 
### Don Tollefson 
Girls are made of sugar and spice and everything
nice.
To many American parents the thought of their
daughter becoming a serious athlete is only slightly
less distasteful than the thought of their son
becoming a transvestite. Virginia Slims not
withstanding, a lot of American men still like their
women in the kitchen and on the bottom.
Women are expected to watch their man on the
athletic field with awe and wonder, but they are
also often expected to suppress any serious athletic
urge, much like their mothers were expected to
suppress their sexual desires. Nice women don't
compete seriously in sports.
The "Keep 'Em In Their Place" movement is
currently being led by the leaders of that revered
piece of Americana — Little League Baseball. After
a Ypsilanti, Michigan girl had the inexcusable nerve
and disrespect to prove she was a better baseball
player than some of her male counterparts trying
out for a Little League team, the Little League
executives in Williamsport, Pennsylvania stepped in
to protect her femininity.
Proving once again that there will always be
limits to meritocracy, the Little League czars barred
the girl's team from official competition. A similar
case in California is being taken to the courts and
hopefully girls will soon have their day on the Little
League diamond.
Tip of the Iceberg
But as Washington political pundits are fond of
saying these days, this is only the tip of the iceberg.
From the corner sandlot to the most liberal of
college campuses, female athletes are treated all too
often like circus freaks. They are often told that if
they wish to exercise, they should take up
something feminine like ballet instead of pursuits
such as track and basketball which are "coarse" and
"masculine."
The highly talented male high school athlete is
wined and dined by hordes of college recruiters who
can promise at the very least an all-encompassing
scholarship which is frequently supplemented by
goodies ranging from cars to good old devalued
American dollars.
Few high school stars make it to the big business
world of professional sports. But most can at least
count on a free college education somewhere. And
if they are even moderately successful in one of the
more visible college sports, they can probably count
on the kind of contacts necessary for a head start in
their post-college life. Even at a sophisticated school
like Stanford, the alumni hangers-on who thrive on
"being on the inside," are more than happy to put
in an often influential word in exchange for the
"friendship" of a real-to-goodness athlete.
But women who maintain a serious interst in
athletics through high school may find that their
problems get worse as they get older. "Tomboys"
are said to be "going through a stage" which they

will certainly "outgrow." But the serious woman
athlete who passes the age of "being cute," is often
in for a rough road.
Those same members of the sports world
hierarchy who wine and dine talented male athletes
often look on talented female athletes as little more
than subjects for locker room humor, which often
revoles around the theme of homosexuality. "Real
women" are of a passive nature — they shouldn't
play, they should be played with.
Those determined women who can disregard all
the harassment and who make it to the top levels of
their sport, will frequently discover that they are
involved in a pay-to-play rather than pay-for-play
situation. But even in pro tennis and golf, the
rewards are miniscule relative to what the men
make.
One can argue that women's golf and tennis
aren't nearly as popular spectator sports as the
men's golf and tennis and thus can't attract the
lucrative television contracts which bring the big
money.
But it is also very true that this situation is
largely due to something that is deeply ingrained in
American society. Men are men and women are
women and only in bed shall the two ever meet.
Men lead countries, fight wars and make money.
Women cook dinner, keep house, and make babies.
When a man is depressed and sad he should grit his
teeth and "keep a stiff upper lip," while a woman is
supposed to cry.
Unjust Pressure
Things are changing, but they are changing pretty
slowly. For every women who's been allowed to
develop her talents to become a doctor or lawyer,
there are probably 10 women who have been
unjustly pressured into becoming nurses or legal
secretaries.
A couple of weeks ago a 55 year old former
Wimbledon champion named Bobby Riggs beat
Margaret Court, the foremost women player alive, in
a tennis match which was billed as the ultimate
battle of the sexes. Despite all the publicity to the
contrary, all that match proved was that on a given
Sunday one individual, who happened to be a man,
beat another individual, who happened to be a
woman.
Even Riggs had to admit that on another day
Court could probably beat him. But as long as some
white males try to keep women and minorities in
this society under their thumb, this will continue to
be a country filled with injustice. The sports world
has done much more than the rest of society for
ethnic minorities.
But legitimate recognition for women athletes is
long overdue. Hopefully the sports world will
shortly pass out of its dark ages.
