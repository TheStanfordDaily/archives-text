Ehrlichman Blasts CIA Director
WASHINGTON — Former White House adviser
John D. Ehrlichman yesterday blamed the Central
Intelligence Agency's deputy director, Vernon
Walters, for the ClA's role in the Watergate coverup.
Ehrlichman also said he can't recall asking the
CIA to help E. Howard Hunt, challenging testimony
by former CIA deputy Robert Cushman.
Ehrlichman, who quit as chief White House
domestic adviser last April 30, testified behind
closed doors to the intelligence subcommittee of the
Senate Appropriations Committee. He later gave
newsmen a 17-page transcript of his prepared
testimony.
Subcommittee Chairman John McClellan
(D-Ark.), said later there has been seriously
conflicting testimony in his hearings. He scheduled
former White House chief of staff H.R. Haldeman
for an appearance today.
Ehrlichman's statement dealt with two matters.
One was the 1971 burglary by Hunt and others of
Dr. Lewis Fielding, a psychiatrist who treated
Pentagon Paper defendant Daniel Ellsberg. The
other was an attempt to limit the FBl's investigation
of last year's Watergate wiretapping.
Ehrlichman's account of the Watergate matter
generally supports a statement by President Nixon
last week. Nixon said he ordered Ehrlichman and
Haldeman to ensure that the FBl's investigations
into Watergate didn't uncover secret operations by
the CIA or White House agents.
Mail Tampering In Campaign?
WASHINGTON - Rep. Charles H. Wilson, chairman
of a House Post Office committee, asked for an
investigation yesterday into reports that mail of two
Democratic presidential candidates was illegally
opened.
Wilson, in a letter to Postmaster General E.T.
Klassen, said he is trying to confirm information
that the federal Watergate grand jury is probing the
matter.
A congressional aide to Wilson, George B. Gould,
said some of the mail of Maine Sen. Edmund S.
Muskie was apparently set aside in the Washington,
D.C., post office, read, copied and put back in the
original envelopes. This reportedly occurred during
Muskie's 1972 presidential bid in New Hampshire.
The mail of South Dakota Sen. George
McGovern was also apparently tampered with while
he campaigned for the Democratic presidential
nomination in Florida, Gould said, quoting his own
sources.
Wilson, a California Democrat, said he has asked
Klassen's assistance "in determining the validity of
allegations that certain postal employees are under
federal grand jury investigation for illegally opening
first class mail and transferring the contents to
persons outside the Postal Service."
Nixon-Pompidou Meet In Iceland
REYKJAVIK, Iceland - The presidents of the
United States and France flew to Iceland yesterday
for talks intended to give new direction to their
transatlantic partnership.

The French leader, Georges Pompidou, arrived
first at the airport in nearby Keflavik. President
Nixon arrived about 90 minutes later.
Nixon is meeting with Pompidou beginning this
morning as part of his "Year of Europe," an effort
to remove misunderstandings and rededicate
French-American friendship.
The summit in Iceland is the last of a series of
top-level meetings preparing for a presidential visit
to Europe toward the end of the year. Nixon has
already met in Washington with the leaders of West
Germany, Britain and Italy.
While Nixon was expected to emphasize the
broad principles of the Atlantic community and its
goals, Pompidou will be pressing for quick action on
one of its immediate flaws and problems —
monteary instability. The problem was underscored
by another drop in dollar prices and rise in gold
prices in yesterday's European trading.
Dollar Hits New Low
LONDON — The U.S. dollar weakened in money
markets across Europe yesterday, dropping to
record lows in Paris and Frankfurt. The price of
gold hit new highs.
Dealers said trading was slow in advance of the
Ascension Day holiday today. With the low volume,
there were no signs of the panic rush out of dollars
and into gold that has touched off recent monetary
crises.
Some dealers blamed the dollar's new weakness
on continued concern that the Watergate affair will
weaken the Nixon administration's ability to solve
U.S. economic problems. As usual when confidence
in the dollar was lagging, the price of gold soared.
The metal jumped $3 an ounce and more in
European centers to close at record highs of $114 in
London and $113.25 in Zurich, the world's two
largest bullion markets.
Industrialist Linked To Nixon
WASHINGTON — New York industrialist Robert
Abplanalp is a principle stockholder in a new bank
which sought its federal charter during the year
after his undisclosed purchase of much of the land
at President Nixon's San Clemente, Calif., retreat.
The agent for the bank and one of its founders
was William E. Griffin Jr., Abplanalp's attorney.
Griffin purchased two Key Biscane, Fla., lots from
the President, at a substantial profit to Nixon, late
in 1972.
A spokesman said no one at the White House was
involved or aware of the chartering of the Yonkers,
N.Y., bank, opened just over a year ago.
Available records indicate the application was
processed and approved routinely before the charter
was granted to Hudson Valley National Bank,
although one examiner found "no real need" for the
bank.
Griffin said he talked to no one at the White
House about the charter.
Abplanalp has been ill and was unavailable for
comment.
More Problems Beset Skylab
SPACE CENTER, Houston - The Skylab space

station lost another 6 percent ol its electrical supply
yesterday when a battery failed, forcing a further
curtailment of experiments aboard the laboratory.
The battery went off the line, officials said, when
a regulator which linked it to the rest ol the space
station power system failed. It was the second
power shortage problem for Sky lab.
Flight Director Neil B. Hutchinson said the loss
of the battery forced cancellation of a plan to
photograph earth resources today. He also said that
future photo passes would have to be shortened.
Bombs Plague Irish Voting
BELFAST — Two bombs erupted in downtown here
yesterday in terrorist attempts to disrupt Northern
Ireland's experiment with the ballot box.
In the neighboring Irish republic, voting got off
to a slow start in the race between government
candidate Tom O'Higgins and the opposition's
Erskine Childers. The two were vying to succeed
91-year-old Eamon DeValera, retiring after two
terms as president and more than half a century as a
dominant figure in Ireland's political life.
One surprise in the balloting was the slow
turnout of youngsters enfranchised for the first time
in the republic by a law lowering the voting age
from 21 to 18.
This was the first time since the partition of
1922 that both parts of Ireland voted on the same
day.
In the north, the issue was to find 526 members
of 26 district councils. Voting for a new provincial
assembly follows on June 28.
Security authorities blamed the central Belfast
bombings and two earlier explosions on guerrillas of
the Irish Republican Army, which is seeking to
break Northern Ireland's links with Britain and join
it with the republic to make a united Ireland. The
IRA's nationalist Provisional wing has demanded a
boycott of voting on both sides of the border.
Johncock Wins At Indy
INDIANAPOLIS — Gordon Johncock won the
abbreviated, problem-plagued, death and
injury-marred 57th Indianapolis 500-mile auto race
yesterday under a yellow flag, beating Billy
Vukovich by 28 seconds in the rain.
The race was halted in the 134 th lap on the
2 1 /2-mile oval by a red flag as the rain began to pelt
down heavily. It had gone to a yellow flag six laps
earlier.
Swede Savage was critically injured in a flaming
crash in the fourth turn during the 59th lap and a
crewman died just a little over an hour later after
being struck in the pits by a fire truck rushing
toward the accident.
Vukovich was followed in the finishing order by
Roger McCluskey in third place, Mel Kenyon in
fourth and Gary Bettenhausen in fifth.
Today's Weather
Fair today through tomorrow but with low clouds
near the coast locally extending inland night and
mornings. Little temperature change. Low tonight
in the 50s. High today and tomorrow near 60 along
the coast to mid 70s inland.

Ehrlichman Blasts CIA Director
WASHINGTON — Former White House adviser
John D. Ehrlichman yesterday blamed the Central
Intelligence Agency's deputy director, Vernon
Walters, for the ClA's role in the Watergate coverup.
Ehrlichman also said he can't recall asking the
CIA to help E. Howard Hunt, challenging testimony
by former CIA deputy Robert Cushman.
Ehrlichman, who quit as chief White House
domestic adviser last April 30, testified behind
closed doors to the intelligence subcommittee of the
Senate Appropriations Committee. He later gave
newsmen a 17-page transcript of his prepared
testimony.
Subcommittee Chairman John McClellan
(D-Ark.), said later there has been seriously
conflicting testimony in his hearings. He scheduled
former White House chief of staff H.R. Haldeman
for an appearance today.
Ehrlichman's statement dealt with two matters.
One was the 1971 burglary by Hunt and others of
Dr. Lewis Fielding, a psychiatrist who treated
Pentagon Paper defendant Daniel Ellsberg. The
other was an attempt to limit the FBl's investigation
of last year's Watergate wiretapping.
Ehrlichman's account of the Watergate matter
generally supports a statement by President Nixon
last week. Nixon said he ordered Ehrlichman and
Haldeman to ensure that the FBl's investigations
into Watergate didn't uncover secret operations by
the CIA or White House agents.
Mail Tampering In Campaign?
WASHINGTON - Rep. Charles H. Wilson, chairman
of a House Post Office committee, asked for an
investigation yesterday into reports that mail of two
Democratic presidential candidates was illegally
opened.
Wilson, in a letter to Postmaster General E.T.
Klassen, said he is trying to confirm information
that the federal Watergate grand jury is probing the
matter.
A congressional aide to Wilson, George B. Gould,
said some of the mail of Maine Sen. Edmund S.
Muskie was apparently set aside in the Washington,
D.C., post office, read, copied and put back in the
original envelopes. This reportedly occurred during
Muskie's 1972 presidential bid in New Hampshire.
The mail of South Dakota Sen. George
McGovern was also apparently tampered with while
he campaigned for the Democratic presidential
nomination in Florida, Gould said, quoting his own
sources.
Wilson, a California Democrat, said he has asked
Klassen's assistance "in determining the validity of
allegations that certain postal employees are under
federal grand jury investigation for illegally opening
first class mail and transferring the contents to
persons outside the Postal Service."
Nixon-Pompidou Meet In Iceland
REYKJAVIK, Iceland - The presidents of the
United States and France flew to Iceland yesterday
for talks intended to give new direction to their
transatlantic partnership.

The French leader, Georges Pompidou, arrived
first at the airport in nearby Keflavik. President
Nixon arrived about 90 minutes later.
Nixon is meeting with Pompidou beginning this
morning as part of his "Year of Europe," an effort
to remove misunderstandings and rededicate
French-American friendship.
The summit in Iceland is the last of a series of
top-level meetings preparing for a presidential visit
to Europe toward the end of the year. Nixon has
already met in Washington with the leaders of West
Germany, Britain and Italy.
While Nixon was expected to emphasize the
broad principles of the Atlantic community and its
goals, Pompidou will be pressing for quick action on
one of its immediate flaws and problems —
monteary instability. The problem was underscored
by another drop in dollar prices and rise in gold
prices in yesterday's European trading.
Dollar Hits New Low
LONDON — The U.S. dollar weakened in money
markets across Europe yesterday, dropping to
record lows in Paris and Frankfurt. The price of
gold hit new highs.
Dealers said trading was slow in advance of the
Ascension Day holiday today. With the low volume,
there were no signs of the panic rush out of dollars
and into gold that has touched off recent monetary
crises.
Some dealers blamed the dollar's new weakness
on continued concern that the Watergate affair will
weaken the Nixon administration's ability to solve
U.S. economic problems. As usual when confidence
in the dollar was lagging, the price of gold soared.
The metal jumped $3 an ounce and more in
European centers to close at record highs of $114 in
London and $113.25 in Zurich, the world's two
largest bullion markets.
Industrialist Linked To Nixon
WASHINGTON — New York industrialist Robert
Abplanalp is a principle stockholder in a new bank
which sought its federal charter during the year
after his undisclosed purchase of much of the land
at President Nixon's San Clemente, Calif., retreat.
The agent for the bank and one of its founders
was William E. Griffin Jr., Abplanalp's attorney.
Griffin purchased two Key Biscane, Fla., lots from
the President, at a substantial profit to Nixon, late
in 1972.
A spokesman said no one at the White House was
involved or aware of the chartering of the Yonkers,
N.Y., bank, opened just over a year ago.
Available records indicate the application was
processed and approved routinely before the charter
was granted to Hudson Valley National Bank,
although one examiner found "no real need" for the
bank.
Griffin said he talked to no one at the White
House about the charter.
Abplanalp has been ill and was unavailable for
comment.
More Problems Beset Skylab
SPACE CENTER, Houston - The Skylab space

station lost another 6 percent ol its electrical supply
yesterday when a battery failed, forcing a further
curtailment of experiments aboard the laboratory.
The battery went off the line, officials said, when
a regulator which linked it to the rest ol the space
station power system failed. It was the second
power shortage problem for Sky lab.
Flight Director Neil B. Hutchinson said the loss
of the battery forced cancellation of a plan to
photograph earth resources today. He also said that
future photo passes would have to be shortened.
Bombs Plague Irish Voting
BELFAST — Two bombs erupted in downtown here
yesterday in terrorist attempts to disrupt Northern
Ireland's experiment with the ballot box.
In the neighboring Irish republic, voting got off
to a slow start in the race between government
candidate Tom O'Higgins and the opposition's
Erskine Childers. The two were vying to succeed
91-year-old Eamon DeValera, retiring after two
terms as president and more than half a century as a
dominant figure in Ireland's political life.
One surprise in the balloting was the slow
turnout of youngsters enfranchised for the first time
in the republic by a law lowering the voting age
from 21 to 18.
This was the first time since the partition of
1922 that both parts of Ireland voted on the same
day.
In the north, the issue was to find 526 members
of 26 district councils. Voting for a new provincial
assembly follows on June 28.
Security authorities blamed the central Belfast
bombings and two earlier explosions on guerrillas of
the Irish Republican Army, which is seeking to
break Northern Ireland's links with Britain and join
it with the republic to make a united Ireland. The
IRA's nationalist Provisional wing has demanded a
boycott of voting on both sides of the border.
Johncock Wins At Indy
INDIANAPOLIS — Gordon Johncock won the
abbreviated, problem-plagued, death and
injury-marred 57th Indianapolis 500-mile auto race
yesterday under a yellow flag, beating Billy
Vukovich by 28 seconds in the rain.
The race was halted in the 134 th lap on the
2 1 /2-mile oval by a red flag as the rain began to pelt
down heavily. It had gone to a yellow flag six laps
earlier.
Swede Savage was critically injured in a flaming
crash in the fourth turn during the 59th lap and a
crewman died just a little over an hour later after
being struck in the pits by a fire truck rushing

Johncock Wins At Indy
INDIANAPOLIS — Gordon Johncock won the
abbreviated, problem-plagued, death and
injury-marred 57th Indianapolis 500-mile auto race
yesterday under a yellow flag, beating Billy
Vukovich by 28 seconds in the rain.
The race was halted in the 134 th lap on the
2 1 /2-mile oval by a red flag as the rain began to pelt
down heavily. It had gone to a yellow flag six laps
earlier.
Swede Savage was critically injured in a flaming
crash in the fourth turn during the 59th lap and a
crewman died just a little over an hour later after
being struck in the pits by a fire truck rushing
toward the accident.
Vukovich was followed in the finishing order by
Roger McCluskey in third place, Mel Kenyon in
fourth and Gary Bettenhausen in fifth.
Today's Weather
Fair today through tomorrow but with low clouds
near the coast locally extending inland night and
mornings. Little temperature change. Low tonight
in the 50s. High today and tomorrow near 60 along
the coast to mid 70s inland.
Ehrlichman Blasts CIA Director
WASHINGTON — Former White House adviser
John D. Ehrlichman yesterday blamed the Central
Intelligence Agency's deputy director, Vernon
Walters, for the ClA's role in the Watergate coverup.
Ehrlichman also said he can't recall asking the
CIA to help E. Howard Hunt, challenging testimony
by former CIA deputy Robert Cushman.
Ehrlichman, who quit as chief White House
domestic adviser last April 30, testified behind
closed doors to the intelligence subcommittee of the
Senate Appropriations Committee. He later gave
newsmen a 17-page transcript of his prepared
testimony.
Subcommittee Chairman John McClellan
(D-Ark.), said later there has been seriously
conflicting testimony in his hearings. He scheduled
former White House chief of staff H.R. Haldeman
for an appearance today.
Ehrlichman's statement dealt with two matters.
One was the 1971 burglary by Hunt and others of
Dr. Lewis Fielding, a psychiatrist who treated
Pentagon Paper defendant Daniel Ellsberg. The
other was an attempt to limit the FBl's investigation
of last year's Watergate wiretapping.
Ehrlichman's account of the Watergate matter
generally supports a statement by President Nixon
last week. Nixon said he ordered Ehrlichman and
Haldeman to ensure that the FBl's investigations
into Watergate didn't uncover secret operations by
the CIA or White House agents.
Mail Tampering In Campaign?
WASHINGTON - Rep. Charles H. Wilson, chairman
of a House Post Office committee, asked for an
investigation yesterday into reports that mail of two
Democratic presidential candidates was illegally
opened.
Wilson, in a letter to Postmaster General E.T.
Klassen, said he is trying to confirm information
that the federal Watergate grand jury is probing the
matter.
A congressional aide to Wilson, George B. Gould,
said some of the mail of Maine Sen. Edmund S.
Muskie was apparently set aside in the Washington,
D.C., post office, read, copied and put back in the
original envelopes. This reportedly occurred during
Muskie's 1972 presidential bid in New Hampshire.
The mail of South Dakota Sen. George
McGovern was also apparently tampered with while
he campaigned for the Democratic presidential
nomination in Florida, Gould said, quoting his own
sources.
Wilson, a California Democrat, said he has asked
Klassen's assistance "in determining the validity of
allegations that certain postal employees are under
federal grand jury investigation for illegally opening
first class mail and transferring the contents to
persons outside the Postal Service."
Nixon-Pompidou Meet In Iceland
REYKJAVIK, Iceland - The presidents of the
United States and France flew to Iceland yesterday
for talks intended to give new direction to their
transatlantic partnership.

The French leader, Georges Pompidou, arrived
first at the airport in nearby Keflavik. President
Nixon arrived about 90 minutes later.
Nixon is meeting with Pompidou beginning this
morning as part of his "Year of Europe," an effort
to remove misunderstandings and rededicate
French-American friendship.
The summit in Iceland is the last of a series of
top-level meetings preparing for a presidential visit
to Europe toward the end of the year. Nixon has
already met in Washington with the leaders of West
Germany, Britain and Italy.
While Nixon was expected to emphasize the
broad principles of the Atlantic community and its
goals, Pompidou will be pressing for quick action on
one of its immediate flaws and problems —
monteary instability. The problem was underscored
by another drop in dollar prices and rise in gold
prices in yesterday's European trading.
Dollar Hits New Low
LONDON — The U.S. dollar weakened in money
markets across Europe yesterday, dropping to
record lows in Paris and Frankfurt. The price of
gold hit new highs.
Dealers said trading was slow in advance of the
Ascension Day holiday today. With the low volume,
there were no signs of the panic rush out of dollars
and into gold that has touched off recent monetary
crises.
Some dealers blamed the dollar's new weakness
on continued concern that the Watergate affair will
weaken the Nixon administration's ability to solve
U.S. economic problems. As usual when confidence
in the dollar was lagging, the price of gold soared.
The metal jumped $3 an ounce and more in
European centers to close at record highs of $114 in
London and $113.25 in Zurich, the world's two
largest bullion markets.
Industrialist Linked To Nixon
WASHINGTON — New York industrialist Robert
Abplanalp is a principle stockholder in a new bank
which sought its federal charter during the year
after his undisclosed purchase of much of the land
at President Nixon's San Clemente, Calif., retreat.
The agent for the bank and one of its founders
was William E. Griffin Jr., Abplanalp's attorney.
Griffin purchased two Key Biscane, Fla., lots from
the President, at a substantial profit to Nixon, late
in 1972.
A spokesman said no one at the White House was
involved or aware of the chartering of the Yonkers,
N.Y., bank, opened just over a year ago.
Available records indicate the application was
processed and approved routinely before the charter
was granted to Hudson Valley National Bank,
although one examiner found "no real need" for the
bank.
Griffin said he talked to no one at the White
House about the charter.
Abplanalp has been ill and was unavailable for
comment.
More Problems Beset Skylab
SPACE CENTER, Houston - The Skylab space

station lost another 6 percent ol its electrical supply
yesterday when a battery failed, forcing a further
curtailment of experiments aboard the laboratory.
The battery went off the line, officials said, when
a regulator which linked it to the rest ol the space
station power system failed. It was the second
power shortage problem for Sky lab.
Flight Director Neil B. Hutchinson said the loss
of the battery forced cancellation of a plan to
photograph earth resources today. He also said that
future photo passes would have to be shortened.
Bombs Plague Irish Voting
BELFAST — Two bombs erupted in downtown here
yesterday in terrorist attempts to disrupt Northern
Ireland's experiment with the ballot box.
In the neighboring Irish republic, voting got off
to a slow start in the race between government
candidate Tom O'Higgins and the opposition's
Erskine Childers. The two were vying to succeed
91-year-old Eamon DeValera, retiring after two
terms as president and more than half a century as a
dominant figure in Ireland's political life.
One surprise in the balloting was the slow
turnout of youngsters enfranchised for the first time
in the republic by a law lowering the voting age
from 21 to 18.
This was the first time since the partition of
1922 that both parts of Ireland voted on the same
day.
In the north, the issue was to find 526 members
of 26 district councils. Voting for a new provincial
assembly follows on June 28.
Security authorities blamed the central Belfast
bombings and two earlier explosions on guerrillas of
the Irish Republican Army, which is seeking to
break Northern Ireland's links with Britain and join
it with the republic to make a united Ireland. The
IRA's nationalist Provisional wing has demanded a
boycott of voting on both sides of the border.

dominant figure in Ireland's political life.
One surprise in the balloting was the slow
turnout of youngsters enfranchised for the first time
in the republic by a law lowering the voting age
from 21 to 18.
This was the first time since the partition of
1922 that both parts of Ireland voted on the same
day.
In the north, the issue was to find 526 members
of 26 district councils. Voting for a new provincial
assembly follows on June 28.
Security authorities blamed the central Belfast
bombings and two earlier explosions on guerrillas of
the Irish Republican Army, which is seeking to
break Northern Ireland's links with Britain and join
it with the republic to make a united Ireland. The
IRA's nationalist Provisional wing has demanded a
boycott of voting on both sides of the border.
Johncock Wins At Indy
INDIANAPOLIS — Gordon Johncock won the
abbreviated, problem-plagued, death and
injury-marred 57th Indianapolis 500-mile auto race
yesterday under a yellow flag, beating Billy
Vukovich by 28 seconds in the rain.
The race was halted in the 134 th lap on the
2 1 /2-mile oval by a red flag as the rain began to pelt
down heavily. It had gone to a yellow flag six laps
earlier.
Swede Savage was critically injured in a flaming
crash in the fourth turn during the 59th lap and a
crewman died just a little over an hour later after
being struck in the pits by a fire truck rushing
toward the accident.
Vukovich was followed in the finishing order by
Roger McCluskey in third place, Mel Kenyon in
fourth and Gary Bettenhausen in fifth.
Today's Weather
Fair today through tomorrow but with low clouds
near the coast locally extending inland night and
mornings. Little temperature change. Low tonight
in the 50s. High today and tomorrow near 60 along
the coast to mid 70s inland.
Ehrlichman Blasts CIA Director
WASHINGTON — Former White House adviser
John D. Ehrlichman yesterday blamed the Central
Intelligence Agency's deputy director, Vernon
Walters, for the ClA's role in the Watergate coverup.
Ehrlichman also said he can't recall asking the
CIA to help E. Howard Hunt, challenging testimony
by former CIA deputy Robert Cushman.
Ehrlichman, who quit as chief White House
domestic adviser last April 30, testified behind
closed doors to the intelligence subcommittee of the
Senate Appropriations Committee. He later gave
newsmen a 17-page transcript of his prepared
testimony.
Subcommittee Chairman John McClellan
(D-Ark.), said later there has been seriously
conflicting testimony in his hearings. He scheduled
former White House chief of staff H.R. Haldeman
for an appearance today.
Ehrlichman's statement dealt with two matters.
One was the 1971 burglary by Hunt and others of
Dr. Lewis Fielding, a psychiatrist who treated
Pentagon Paper defendant Daniel Ellsberg. The
other was an attempt to limit the FBl's investigation
of last year's Watergate wiretapping.
Ehrlichman's account of the Watergate matter
generally supports a statement by President Nixon
last week. Nixon said he ordered Ehrlichman and
Haldeman to ensure that the FBl's investigations
into Watergate didn't uncover secret operations by
the CIA or White House agents.
Mail Tampering In Campaign?
WASHINGTON - Rep. Charles H. Wilson, chairman
of a House Post Office committee, asked for an
investigation yesterday into reports that mail of two
Democratic presidential candidates was illegally
opened.
Wilson, in a letter to Postmaster General E.T.
Klassen, said he is trying to confirm information
that the federal Watergate grand jury is probing the
matter.
A congressional aide to Wilson, George B. Gould,
said some of the mail of Maine Sen. Edmund S.
Muskie was apparently set aside in the Washington,
D.C., post office, read, copied and put back in the
original envelopes. This reportedly occurred during
Muskie's 1972 presidential bid in New Hampshire.
The mail of South Dakota Sen. George
McGovern was also apparently tampered with while
he campaigned for the Democratic presidential
nomination in Florida, Gould said, quoting his own
sources.
Wilson, a California Democrat, said he has asked
Klassen's assistance "in determining the validity of
allegations that certain postal employees are under
federal grand jury investigation for illegally opening
first class mail and transferring the contents to
persons outside the Postal Service."
Nixon-Pompidou Meet In Iceland
REYKJAVIK, Iceland - The presidents of the
United States and France flew to Iceland yesterday
for talks intended to give new direction to their
transatlantic partnership.

The French leader, Georges Pompidou, arrived
first at the airport in nearby Keflavik. President
Nixon arrived about 90 minutes later.
Nixon is meeting with Pompidou beginning this
morning as part of his "Year of Europe," an effort
to remove misunderstandings and rededicate
French-American friendship.
The summit in Iceland is the last of a series of
top-level meetings preparing for a presidential visit
to Europe toward the end of the year. Nixon has
already met in Washington with the leaders of West
Germany, Britain and Italy.
While Nixon was expected to emphasize the
broad principles of the Atlantic community and its
goals, Pompidou will be pressing for quick action on
one of its immediate flaws and problems —
monteary instability. The problem was underscored
by another drop in dollar prices and rise in gold
prices in yesterday's European trading.
Dollar Hits New Low
LONDON — The U.S. dollar weakened in money
markets across Europe yesterday, dropping to
record lows in Paris and Frankfurt. The price of
gold hit new highs.
Dealers said trading was slow in advance of the
Ascension Day holiday today. With the low volume,
there were no signs of the panic rush out of dollars
and into gold that has touched off recent monetary
crises.
Some dealers blamed the dollar's new weakness
on continued concern that the Watergate affair will
weaken the Nixon administration's ability to solve
U.S. economic problems. As usual when confidence
in the dollar was lagging, the price of gold soared.
The metal jumped $3 an ounce and more in
European centers to close at record highs of $114 in
London and $113.25 in Zurich, the world's two
largest bullion markets.
Industrialist Linked To Nixon
WASHINGTON — New York industrialist Robert
Abplanalp is a principle stockholder in a new bank
which sought its federal charter during the year
after his undisclosed purchase of much of the land
at President Nixon's San Clemente, Calif., retreat.
The agent for the bank and one of its founders
was William E. Griffin Jr., Abplanalp's attorney.
Griffin purchased two Key Biscane, Fla., lots from
the President, at a substantial profit to Nixon, late
in 1972.
A spokesman said no one at the White House was
involved or aware of the chartering of the Yonkers,
N.Y., bank, opened just over a year ago.
Available records indicate the application was
processed and approved routinely before the charter
was granted to Hudson Valley National Bank,
although one examiner found "no real need" for the
bank.
Griffin said he talked to no one at the White
House about the charter.
Abplanalp has been ill and was unavailable for
comment.
More Problems Beset Skylab
SPACE CENTER, Houston - The Skylab space

station lost another 6 percent ol its electrical supply
yesterday when a battery failed, forcing a further
curtailment of experiments aboard the laboratory.
The battery went off the line, officials said, when
a regulator which linked it to the rest ol the space
station power system failed. It was the second
power shortage problem for Sky lab.
Flight Director Neil B. Hutchinson said the loss
of the battery forced cancellation of a plan to
photograph earth resources today. He also said that
future photo passes would have to be shortened.
Bombs Plague Irish Voting
BELFAST — Two bombs erupted in downtown here
yesterday in terrorist attempts to disrupt Northern
Ireland's experiment with the ballot box.
In the neighboring Irish republic, voting got off
to a slow start in the race between government
candidate Tom O'Higgins and the opposition's
Erskine Childers. The two were vying to succeed
91-year-old Eamon DeValera, retiring after two
terms as president and more than half a century as a
dominant figure in Ireland's political life.
