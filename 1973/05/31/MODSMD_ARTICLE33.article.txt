# Franklin Optimistic, Lauds Court Decision
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
H. Bruce Franklin, fired associate
professor of English, yesterday
described the Superior Court decision
which permits him to seek
court-ordered reinstatement as "very,
very correct" and "very far-reaching."
Last week, Santa Clara County
Superior Court Judge Joseph P. Kelly
denied a University motion which
sought to dismiss Franklin's
reinstatement suit without a trial.
University President Richard
Lyman said Tuesday that the
University would probably appeal
Kelly's ruling. He had very sharp
criticism for the opinion and its
possible effects on University internal
disciplinary processes.
James Siena, Lyman's legal adviser,
commented yesterday that "we
haven't made up our minds yet on
what we will do."
First Amendment
In a rambling and wide-ranging
conversation with the Daily, Franklin
predicted that the forthcoming trial of
his lawsuit against the University will
result in his reinstatement and in the
extension of first amendment free
speech guarantees to all University
employees and students in their
dealings with Stanford.
One of the principal tenets of his
suit is that the University's ties —
financial and otherwise — to
governmental agencies make it a
public body and therefore require it to
refrain from persecuting employees for
their speech.
Franklin claims that in firing him in
January, 1972, for fomenting civil
disorders, the University failed to
accord him first amendment
protection, although University
officials claimed that they were doing
so.
Challenge
He said yesterday that he was
"challenging" the University to
"stipulate that the workers and faculty
and students indeed have the
protection of the first amendment and
that that is an understanding of all
their contractual arrangements with
the University."
Franklin was convinced that the
University would not make such a
stipulation and that "their
unwillingness to do that will prove
conclusively that I was deprived of
constitutionally protected speech." He
did not elaborate.

According to Franklin, Kelly's
decision last week represents "a legal
opinion on the merits of the case" and
not merely a procedural
determiniation that Franklin is
entitled to a fulldress trial.
Optimism
Hence the ex-professor exuded
optimism that the final decision in the
case would be in his favor.
The Maoist scholar, who has been
unemployed since his ouster from the
University, said "I'm actively looking
[for a job] but I can't seem to find
any." In his suit, he charges that his
dismissal made him unemployable as a
professor.
He said he had recently exhausted
the term of his state unemployment
compensation, which he won last fall
in a special hearing after an initial
rejection.

University would probably appeal
Kelly's ruling. He had very sharp
criticism for the opinion and its
possible effects on University internal
disciplinary processes.
James Siena, Lyman's legal adviser,
commented yesterday that "we
haven't made up our minds yet on
what we will do."
First Amendment
In a rambling and wide-ranging
conversation with the Daily, Franklin
predicted that the forthcoming trial of
his lawsuit against the University will
result in his reinstatement and in the
extension of first amendment free
speech guarantees to all University
employees and students in their
dealings with Stanford.
One of the principal tenets of his
suit is that the University's ties —
financial and otherwise — to
governmental agencies make it a
public body and therefore require it to
refrain from persecuting employees for
their speech.
Franklin claims that in firing him in
January, 1972, for fomenting civil
disorders, the University failed to
accord him first amendment
protection, although University
officials claimed that they were doing
so.
Challenge
He said yesterday that he was
"challenging" the University to
"stipulate that the workers and faculty
and students indeed have the
protection of the first amendment and
that that is an understanding of all
their contractual arrangements with
the University."
Franklin was convinced that the
University would not make such a
stipulation and that "their
unwillingness to do that will prove
conclusively that I was deprived of
constitutionally protected speech." He
did not elaborate.

According to Franklin, Kelly's
decision last week represents "a legal
opinion on the merits of the case" and
not merely a procedural
determiniation that Franklin is
entitled to a fulldress trial.
Optimism
Hence the ex-professor exuded
optimism that the final decision in the
case would be in his favor.
The Maoist scholar, who has been
unemployed since his ouster from the
University, said "I'm actively looking
[for a job] but I can't seem to find
any." In his suit, he charges that his
dismissal made him unemployable as a
professor.
He said he had recently exhausted
the term of his state unemployment
compensation, which he won last fall
in a special hearing after an initial
rejection.
H. Bruce Franklin, fired associate
professor of English, yesterday
described the Superior Court decision
which permits him to seek
court-ordered reinstatement as "very,
very correct" and "very far-reaching."
Last week, Santa Clara County
Superior Court Judge Joseph P. Kelly
denied a University motion which
sought to dismiss Franklin's
reinstatement suit without a trial.
University President Richard
Lyman said Tuesday that the
University would probably appeal
Kelly's ruling. He had very sharp
criticism for the opinion and its
possible effects on University internal
disciplinary processes.
