# Fails Monday, Succeeds Tuesday
## Psychic Demonstrates Abilities 
### TERRY ANZUR 
"Ladies and gentlemen, today I am
defeated," apologized psychic Uri
Geller to more than 1200 persons in
Memorial Auditorium at a
demonstration of his reported
telepathic and psychokinetic abilities
Monday night.
Geller, a 26 year-old Israeli whose
powers of telepathy and psychokinesis
(the ability to affect objects without
touching them) have been empirically
investigated by the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI), failed to complete
many tasks that would have
demonstrated those abilities during his
performance Monday.
But appearing before nearly 1500
believers and skeptics in Mem Aud
Tuesday evening, he not only
displayed an apparent telepathic
ability to receive signals and bend
metal objects, but also offered to use
his powers to heal sick and injured
members of the audience.
Time magazine recently reported
that Geller was a popular entertainer
in Israel until scientists at Hebrew
University "duplicated his feats and
called him a fraud."
Geller first demonstrated his
powers publicly in March 1970. Dr.

Andrija Puharich, a noted
parapsychologist, brought Geller to
SRI last November for six weeks of
controlled laboratory tests.
SRI Psychic Research
The tests were conducted by
Harold E. Puthoff and Russell Targ of
SRI, and partially underwritten by
former astronaut Edgar Mitchell.
Under controlled laboratory
conditions, Geller correctly
determined which of ten identical
aluminum cans contained an object,
without touching the cans, on each of
12 consecutive trials. Targ set the odds
against this at one in one trillion. In an
uncontrolled experiment, Geller was
blindfolded and reportedly drove a car
through Berkeley by receiving
telepathic information about the
appearance of the road from
frightened passengers.
"You all come here expecting
something very big," he told the
audience Monday night. "When I walk
on stage I never know what is going to
happen."
Like an experienced showman, he
recruited female assistants from the
audience, requesting only women as
volunteers because "they are better
mediums I can work through."
Repeated Failure
He began the demonstration by
asking an assistant at a blackboard to
write and then erase the name of a
color. He asked for the audience to
repeat the color mentally on the count
of three. But Geller could not receive
the color "green" in four trials, and
wouldn't guess.
He failed to identify the names of
capital cities, drawings, and English
names written on the blackboard. He

finally detected Buenos Aires as
"Bonus Irus" and duplicated a drawing
of a tree.
"I'm not excusing myself," Geller
told the audience. He said he was
exhausted after demonstrating his
powers on several radio and television
programs earlier that day.
Television Screen
He explained that he receives
signals by closing his eyes and
visualizing a television screen on which
letters, colors, and pictures appear. "I
know an intelligent power is working
through me," he said.
Although he says telepathy is easier
for him, Geller is well known for his
psycho kinetic feats. At Monday's
performance he repaired a watch that
had not run in 15 years, and moved
the hands on another inoperative
watch. He reportedly can fix any
watch by passing his hand over it
without touching it, provided that no
parts are missing.
With the help of a volunteer who
claimed to have psychic abilities,
Geller used psychic kinesis to bend a
ring donated by Palo Alto psychologist
Freida Porat. Although Geller purports
to bend metal objects with his powers,
he can't restraighten them and, as a
rule, doesn't replace what he breaks.
Despite Geller's repeated apologies
for his failures, not everyone in the
audience was satisfied with his
performance.
Charges Of Fraud
Fred Moore, who sat in the front
row, told the Daily that he saw Geller
"give a very tiny wind" to each of the
watches he received from the audience
to determine which of them could be

PSYCHOKINETIC — Uri Geller, who demonstrated his telepathic and

control over his psychic abilities. Tuesday, at a faculty club luncheon, his fork

untouched spoon split in half.
repaired, and saw him "change the
time" on another watch.
Moore also alleged that the ring
Geller bent was previously split and
that Geller actually bent it in his hand
before giving it to an assistant.
Targ, who has a background in
magic, admitted that what Geller did
could have been done with conjuring
tricks, but added "It's important not
to accuse him of trickery just because
trickery is possible." He also pointed
out that the performance was not a
controlled experiment, and recalled
many occasions in the laboratory
when Geller "couldn't do what he set
out to do."
Tuesday night's program contained
many of the same stunts Geller
attempted on Monday, but he
performed a larger percentage of them
successfully. In a psychokinetic
demonstration he apparently bent a
key by passing his hand lightly over it.
He also tried to apply his powers to
the physical ailments of volunteers
from the audience. Geller performed
no miracle cures, but hinted that his
powers might have a delayed effect.
Although he has never healed
publicly before, he wanted to try it
during the performance because he
could draw on the energy of the
audience. "I don't even know where to
start," he said. "I don't want people to
think I'm a new Jesus."

Moore also alleged that the ring
Geller bent was previously split and
that Geller actually bent it in his hand
before giving it to an assistant.
Targ, who has a background in
magic, admitted that what Geller did
could have been done with conjuring
tricks, but added "It's important not
to accuse him of trickery just because
trickery is possible." He also pointed
out that the performance was not a
controlled experiment, and recalled
many occasions in the laboratory
when Geller "couldn't do what he set
out to do."
Tuesday night's program contained
many of the same stunts Geller
attempted on Monday, but he
performed a larger percentage of them
successfully. In a psychokinetic
demonstration he apparently bent a
key by passing his hand lightly over it.
He also tried to apply his powers to
the physical ailments of volunteers
from the audience. Geller performed
no miracle cures, but hinted that his
powers might have a delayed effect.
Although he has never healed
publicly before, he wanted to try it
during the performance because he
could draw on the energy of the
audience. "I don't even know where to
start," he said. "I don't want people to
think I'm a new Jesus."
"Ladies and gentlemen, today I am
defeated," apologized psychic Uri
Geller to more than 1200 persons in
Memorial Auditorium at a
demonstration of his reported
telepathic and psychokinetic abilities
Monday night.
Geller, a 26 year-old Israeli whose
powers of telepathy and psychokinesis
(the ability to affect objects without
touching them) have been empirically
investigated by the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI), failed to complete
many tasks that would have
demonstrated those abilities during his
performance Monday.
But appearing before nearly 1500
believers and skeptics in Mem Aud
Tuesday evening, he not only
displayed an apparent telepathic
ability to receive signals and bend
metal objects, but also offered to use
his powers to heal sick and injured
members of the audience.
Time magazine recently reported
that Geller was a popular entertainer
in Israel until scientists at Hebrew
University "duplicated his feats and
called him a fraud."
Geller first demonstrated his
powers publicly in March 1970. Dr.

Andrija Puharich, a noted
parapsychologist, brought Geller to
SRI last November for six weeks of
controlled laboratory tests.
SRI Psychic Research
The tests were conducted by
Harold E. Puthoff and Russell Targ of
SRI, and partially underwritten by
former astronaut Edgar Mitchell.
Under controlled laboratory
conditions, Geller correctly
determined which of ten identical
aluminum cans contained an object,
without touching the cans, on each of
12 consecutive trials. Targ set the odds
against this at one in one trillion. In an
uncontrolled experiment, Geller was
blindfolded and reportedly drove a car
through Berkeley by receiving
telepathic information about the
appearance of the road from
frightened passengers.
"You all come here expecting
something very big," he told the
audience Monday night. "When I walk
on stage I never know what is going to
happen."
Like an experienced showman, he
recruited female assistants from the
audience, requesting only women as
volunteers because "they are better
mediums I can work through."
Repeated Failure
He began the demonstration by
asking an assistant at a blackboard to
write and then erase the name of a
color. He asked for the audience to
repeat the color mentally on the count
of three. But Geller could not receive
the color "green" in four trials, and
wouldn't guess.
He failed to identify the names of
capital cities, drawings, and English
names written on the blackboard. He

finally detected Buenos Aires as
"Bonus Irus" and duplicated a drawing
of a tree.
"I'm not excusing myself," Geller
told the audience. He said he was
exhausted after demonstrating his
powers on several radio and television
programs earlier that day.
Television Screen
He explained that he receives
signals by closing his eyes and
visualizing a television screen on which
letters, colors, and pictures appear. "I
know an intelligent power is working
through me," he said.
Although he says telepathy is easier
for him, Geller is well known for his
psycho kinetic feats. At Monday's
performance he repaired a watch that
had not run in 15 years, and moved
the hands on another inoperative
watch. He reportedly can fix any
watch by passing his hand over it
without touching it, provided that no
parts are missing.
With the help of a volunteer who
claimed to have psychic abilities,
Geller used psychic kinesis to bend a
ring donated by Palo Alto psychologist
Freida Porat. Although Geller purports
to bend metal objects with his powers,
he can't restraighten them and, as a
rule, doesn't replace what he breaks.
Despite Geller's repeated apologies
for his failures, not everyone in the
audience was satisfied with his
performance.

Fred Moore, who sat in the front
row, told the Daily that he saw Geller
"give a very tiny wind" to each of the
watches he received from the audience

visualizing a television screen on which
letters, colors, and pictures appear. "I
know an intelligent power is working
through me," he said.
Although he says telepathy is easier
for him, Geller is well known for his
psycho kinetic feats. At Monday's
performance he repaired a watch that
had not run in 15 years, and moved
the hands on another inoperative
watch. He reportedly can fix any
watch by passing his hand over it
without touching it, provided that no
parts are missing.
With the help of a volunteer who
claimed to have psychic abilities,
Geller used psychic kinesis to bend a
ring donated by Palo Alto psychologist
Freida Porat. Although Geller purports
to bend metal objects with his powers,
he can't restraighten them and, as a
rule, doesn't replace what he breaks.
Despite Geller's repeated apologies
for his failures, not everyone in the
audience was satisfied with his
performance.

Fred Moore, who sat in the front
row, told the Daily that he saw Geller
"give a very tiny wind" to each of the

PSYCHOKINETIC — Uri Geller, who demonstrated his telepathic and
psychokinetic abilities at benefit performances for the Bridge, claims he has little
control over his psychic abilities. Tuesday, at a faculty club luncheon, his fork
reportedly bent as he plunged it into a jello salad. Several minutes later, his
untouched spoon split in half.
repaired, and saw him "change the
time" on another watch.
Moore also alleged that the ring
Geller bent was previously split and
that Geller actually bent it in his hand
before giving it to an assistant.
Targ, who has a background in
magic, admitted that what Geller did
could have been done with conjuring
tricks, but added "It's important not
to accuse him of trickery just because
trickery is possible." He also pointed
out that the performance was not a
controlled experiment, and recalled
many occasions in the laboratory
when Geller "couldn't do what he set
out to do."
Tuesday night's program contained
many of the same stunts Geller
attempted on Monday, but he
performed a larger percentage of them
successfully. In a psychokinetic
demonstration he apparently bent a
key by passing his hand lightly over it.
He also tried to apply his powers to
the physical ailments of volunteers
from the audience. Geller performed
no miracle cures, but hinted that his
powers might have a delayed effect.
Although he has never healed
publicly before, he wanted to try it
during the performance because he
could draw on the energy of the
audience. "I don't even know where to
start," he said. "I don't want people to
think I'm a new Jesus."
"Ladies and gentlemen, today I am
defeated," apologized psychic Uri
Geller to more than 1200 persons in
Memorial Auditorium at a
demonstration of his reported
telepathic and psychokinetic abilities
Monday night.
Geller, a 26 year-old Israeli whose
powers of telepathy and psychokinesis
(the ability to affect objects without
touching them) have been empirically
investigated by the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI), failed to complete
many tasks that would have
demonstrated those abilities during his
performance Monday.
But appearing before nearly 1500
believers and skeptics in Mem Aud
Tuesday evening, he not only
displayed an apparent telepathic
ability to receive signals and bend
metal objects, but also offered to use
his powers to heal sick and injured
members of the audience.
Time magazine recently reported
that Geller was a popular entertainer
in Israel until scientists at Hebrew
University "duplicated his feats and
called him a fraud."
Geller first demonstrated his
powers publicly in March 1970. Dr.

Andrija Puharich, a noted
parapsychologist, brought Geller to
SRI last November for six weeks of
controlled laboratory tests.
SRI Psychic Research
The tests were conducted by
Harold E. Puthoff and Russell Targ of
SRI, and partially underwritten by
former astronaut Edgar Mitchell.
Under controlled laboratory
conditions, Geller correctly
determined which of ten identical
aluminum cans contained an object,
without touching the cans, on each of
12 consecutive trials. Targ set the odds
against this at one in one trillion. In an
uncontrolled experiment, Geller was
blindfolded and reportedly drove a car
through Berkeley by receiving
telepathic information about the
appearance of the road from
frightened passengers.
"You all come here expecting
something very big," he told the
audience Monday night. "When I walk
on stage I never know what is going to
happen."
Like an experienced showman, he
recruited female assistants from the
audience, requesting only women as
volunteers because "they are better
mediums I can work through."
Repeated Failure
He began the demonstration by
asking an assistant at a blackboard to
write and then erase the name of a
color. He asked for the audience to
repeat the color mentally on the count
of three. But Geller could not receive
the color "green" in four trials, and
wouldn't guess.
He failed to identify the names of
capital cities, drawings, and English
names written on the blackboard. He

finally detected Buenos Aires as
"Bonus Irus" and duplicated a drawing
of a tree.
"I'm not excusing myself," Geller
told the audience. He said he was
exhausted after demonstrating his
powers on several radio and television
programs earlier that day.
Television Screen
He explained that he receives
signals by closing his eyes and
visualizing a television screen on which
letters, colors, and pictures appear. "I
know an intelligent power is working
through me," he said.
