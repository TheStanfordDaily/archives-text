# Black Pre-Meds Strive For Motivation, Commitment
## 
### JANIS ULEVICH 
"When I got here, / fcad a feeling I wanted to
go into medicine ..."
Freshman Brenda Young's "feeling" of last
fall has in the past half year become a definite
commitment. And she says one of the major
factors in her decision has been a group called
the Stanford Black Pre-Medical Organization.
The organization, whose projects have thus
far been funded by grants from HEW and OEO,
was started in fall of 1970 by three black
Stanford pre-meds, because of an increasing
number of black students here interested in
medicine. Its function was at first basically
informational: beginning pre-med students
could benefit from upperclassmen's knowledge
of requirements, professors and courses.
Motivation
Now, however, the group's primary aim
seems to be motivation. Constantly stressed by
group members is the crucial need for more
minority doctors.
"Where might we find the potential
physician who has experienced and survived
being discriminated against, being poor, or
being segregated separately and unequally, and
who knows what it feels like?" asks a minority
pre-med handbook published last year by two
of the group's founders.

"When you put your life into someone's
hands, ethnic understanding is of tremendous
importance," said Dr. William C. Dement, the
group's adviser and psychiatry professor at the
Stanford Medical School. Dement emphasized
the necessity of "empathic ability to put
yourself in someone else's shoes."
"There's a lot more to being a black doctor
than to being a white doctor," Young asserted.
'Matter Of Understanding'
"It's a matter of understanding," she said in
regard to some special black health problems.
She hypothesized the case of a doctor treating a
baby for pneumonia, then sending that baby
home — to the very conditions which caused its
poor health.
But the Black Pre-Medical Organization at
Stanford goes beyond encouraging and
psychologically reinforcing its 75 members in
the midst of an overwhelmingly white
university. It attempts to provoke interest in
health fields at the high school level as well.
In this quarter's Project Motivate, for
example, group members gave 90-minute
presentations to black students interested in the
sciences at 17 area high schools. These were
followed by two day-long programs for high
school students at Stanford, which involved
demonstrations and interaction with pre-meds

and medical students and faculty.
Exposure
"We wanted to expose them to the kinds of
things that go on in a medical center," said
group member Art James. "I think we turned a
lot of people on who were on the borderline."
Stanford's black pre-meds seem to feel that
early exposure to the possibilities of health
careers is essential.
"Counseling at most of the high schools is
non-existent or bad," said Woody Myers, one of
the three members of the Central Committee,
the organization's governing body.
Little Encouragement
James said that black high school students
receive little encouragement from their teachers
or counselors. The students often have few
black teachers, especially in the sciences, he
said, as models to emulate.
Many teachers, Yoong said, try to gear biack
students primarily toward high school
graduation as an upper limit rather than toward
the pursuit of careers which require college
education. She cited her own experience on
entering high school, when she was
recommended for an honors algebra course. Her
counselor, she said, discouraged her from taking
the course because she already had enough
math to graduate from high school.

Project Motivate, advised by Prof. St. Clair
Drake of the anthropology department, was
generally seen as quite successful.
"If we just go one high school student to
decide to go into the health careers, I think
we've done our job," Young said. "Wc had our
motivation — we felt we needed to transfer our
motivation."
Pre-Med Conference
In addition, the organization, according to
Myers, the largest of its type in the state,
recently held a conference here for black
pre-meds in the Bay Area.
The "one-day forum to discuss problems of
black pre-meds," handled administratively
through Asst. to the President James Simmons,
drew about 300 people, Myers said. The
keynote speaker was Dr. Francis Welsing, of the
psychiatry department at Howard University.
The Stanford Black Pre-Meds are optimistic
about their plans and proud of their successes.
In 1971, two of the graduating members
applied to medical schools and both were
accepted; last year, four out of four were
accepted.
Myers himself will enter Harvard University
Medical School next fall, as will his fiancee,
Debra Jackson, who is also graduating from
Stanford this spring.
