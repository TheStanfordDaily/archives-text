## C-15: Kudos 
### 
The student body, the faculty and the Administration
should quickly approve the new student judicial system
proposed last week by the Committee of 15 (C-15).
The system, called the Stanford Judicial Council (SJC),
includes a guilt-determining panel with a majority of student
members. Both of the most recent judicial systems included
faculty-majority panels.
The proposal for a student majority is a victory for those
students who have sought the appearance of fairness in these
judicial systems. Although the addition of one student
member to the panel should not significantly alter its
orientation, the student defendants and others will perceive
the student-controlled panel as more just.
In recent memory, faculty members on guilt-determining
panels have never alligned themselves against the student
members to approve a conviction or a higher penalty.
We are pleased that the C-15 no longer insists upon
removing the student body's veto power over future
proposed changes in the judicial system. Under the current
charter, these changes must be approved by the students, the
faculty and the administration.
The proposed SJC retains one of the best portions of the
current system: hearing officers who are responsible for
finding the facts in each case brought before them. This is
far more efficient than forcing the judicial panel to sit
through lengthy fact-finding hearings.
We commend the members of the C-15 for the
outstanding degree of cooperation which has distinguished
their work this year. The efforts of C-15 Chairman Jim
Anderson, former ASSU President Scott Burke and Law
Prof. Jack Friedenthal largely prevented the type of
counterproductive divisiveness which plagued the committee
last year.
Overall, the C-\s's proposal merits full consideration and
speedy approval by all three University constituencies.
