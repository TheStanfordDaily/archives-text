# A 						Precedent Set?
## Watergate And The Law 
### 
John H. Dickerson

Television addicts have noted
the recent revival of old shows
wi*h new names, such as "The
,ew Price is Right" and "Young
Jr. Kildare." So it comes as no
surprise that Johnny Carson's old
show "Who Do You Trust" has
been revived and retitled "The
Watergate Hearings."
Unfortunately, at the moment all
the contestants appear to be
losing.
During the 1972 campaign, the
President assured everyone that
neither he nor anyone on his staff
at the White House or on the
Committee to Re-Elect the
President (CRP) had any advance
knowledge of the Watergate affair.
Since that time, admission has
followed admission — and few
seriously contend that the full
story has been told.
What was characterized only a
month ago by a Nixon
representative on the Dick Cavett
Show as "some anti-Castro
Cubans who wanted to read Larry
O'Brien's mail" now involves the
Treasury Department, the FBI,
the CIA, the Securities and
Exchange Commission, and even

the attorn ies of the original
conspirators fighting to save their
professional reputations. What
could possibly be more ironic
than the sight of the great
promoter of law and order
suffering through the forced
resignations of two attorneys
general and the head of the FBI
for engaging in illegal activities?
System
Nevertheless, Howard K. Smith
of ABC News took pride in
pointing out that the American
system has uncovered the scandal
and Ben Scheible argued in a
Daily column that because Mr.
Nixon ignored other people's
political crimes, he couldn't have
committed any himself. If the
logic of Mr. Scheible's article
escapes you, you are not alone.
Actually, both of those
sentiments exhibit a complacency
that should be examined
critically.
It is one thing to pat the press
on the back for uncovering
scandal, and in fairness to Howard
K. Smith it should be pointed out
that he has called for reform of
the system that permitted the

scandal — in the last week. But
where was the "system" when
millions upon millions of voters
were misled into believing the
innocence of Mitchell and the lack
of a connection between the
White House and the Watergate
buggers, the former now seriously
in question, and the latter*
disproved by the President's own
admission? Where was the
"system" when counterfeit
campaign literature was being
mailed to Democrats in Florida?
What is insidious is the
implication that by uncovering
the misdeeds, the "system" has
functioned correctly, when in fact
irrevocable damage may have been
done. George McGovern's rise to
the nomination was incredible,
and was predicted by only
McGovern himself and his
strongest supporters. Without
Republican sabotage, would
McGovern have been the
nominee? If another man won the
nomination, would Richard Nixon
now be President? If the President
achieved power illegally and
therefore illegitimately (whether
or not he was in on the
conspiracy) does he have any
legitimate right to govern the
country?
Fraud
Nobody wants to face these
questions, and, as a result, they
will not be faced. It is
unfortunate, but Watergate
demonstrates once again that if
you don't get caught before the
election, you win, which brings us
to Mr. Scheible's article. That
article argues that Mr. Nixon did
not pursue the investigation of
alleged election fraud in 1960,
because he thought it would not
be in the best interests of the
country.
The obvious nplication is that
President Nixon considers his
conception of protecting the
national interest to be more
important than strict enforcement
of the law. To argue from that
premise to the conclusion that the
President is "not the type" to be
involved in Watergate is illogical;
exactly the opposite is inferred. If
President Nixon found it within
himself to excuse the fraudulent
politicians of Chicago and Texas
in 1960, wouldn't he find it just
as easy or even easier to excuse
himself or his top aides for acting
in what he thought was the
national interest? Clearly Mr.
Scheible's article describes
precisely "the type" who would
be involved in the Watergate
Affair.
Furthermore, the idea that
"everybody does it — Nixon's
men just got caught" cannot be
accepted as an excuse or
mitigating circumstance. To do so
would be to condemn politics to
hopeless lawlessness.
Law
As a registered Republican who
worked for Mr. Nixon in the last

election campaign, I have found
the events of the last few weeks
particularly distressing. Society
cannot be maintained if the views
of one man or a small group of
men are to have more import than
the rule of law. Even if we grant
to the Nixon administration the
purest of motives and the most
brilliant of minds, who is to say
that once the precedent is set it
will not be corrupted?
Men come and men go, but the
law remains — only if the law is
more important than the men can
fundamental rights be guaranteed.
