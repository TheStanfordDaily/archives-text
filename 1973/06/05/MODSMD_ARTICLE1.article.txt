# New 90 Unit Limit Approved
## Senate Ratifies Transfer Unit Cut 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
The Faculty Senate Thursday
approved a measure which cut the
number of units which may be
transferred toward a bachelor's degree
here from 135 to 90.
The resolution from the Committee
on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement (C-AAA) will require
that from now on undergraduates
transferring into the University
complete the equivalent of two years'
academic work here for their
Bachelor's degree. Only students who
enter a co-terminal degree program or
a professional school will be allowed
to transfer the present maximum of
135 units, roughly three years of
academic work.
About one-third of the
approximately 450 undergraduates
who transfer here each year will be
affected by the new ruling, according
to the Registrar's Office. Most of these
students would lose credit for three
months' study elsewhere.
No'D's'
The measure also provides that
credit will be allowed only for work
graded "A", "B", "C", or "Pass." "We
no longer recognize a 'D' grade as a
mark of acceptable work," wrote
C-AAA Chairman Assoc. History Prof.
Philip Dawson in a statement

distributed to Senate members.
"We should point out that the
committee does not offer an elaborate
justification closely reasoned from
profound philosophical premises," the
statement continues.
"It simply seems to the committee
a practical and common-sense solution
to describe as a Stanford bachelor's
degree one which represents, to the
extent of at least 50 percent of the
academic work required, credit earned
at a Stanford campus."
Dawson did not deny the limit was
"arbitrarily chosen," but suggested
any other fraction was "equally
arbitrary. In our view, the question is
principally at what point one wishes to
describe a bachelor's degree as 'a
Stanford' degree," he wrote.
Acting Registrar Robert Houghton,
pleased with the Senate's action,
commented, "I'm glad to see the
committee's recommendation
approved. I don't think that it will
keep that many transfers from
applying or accepting if they're
admitted."
Houghton denied that the
resolution will discourage students
who would transfer here as seniors. "I
think we're probably getting more in
line with other universities in that a
student can't transfer in more work

than the first two years. But there's no
reason that somebody who is going to
transfer still won't do so and make up
the units that he loses above 90."
Credit Limit
Houghton was unable to name any
institutions which have a two-year
transfer credit limit.
According to the Office of
Undergraduate Admissions at
UC-Berkeley, students there may
receive as many as 159V& units of
transfer credit. Students with credit
above that limit may apply for special
consideration with the admissions
office. Berkeley students, like students
here, need 180 quarter-units to
graduate with a bachelor's degree.
Houghton indicated that the
students' transfer work above 90 units
"could still be used to meet University
writing and distribution
requirements." However, the student
would still need to complete the
additional 90 units here for a
bachelor's degree, he said.
ROTC Petition
In other Senate business, Senate
Chairman Mathematics Prof. Halsey
Royden announced the Senate
Steering Committee had postponed
until fall a petition to reinstate ROTC
circulated by Earth Sciences graduate
student Bob Barker. Royden indicated
that the petition, signed by
approximately 150 students, would be
rescheduled by the steering committee
of next year's Senate to allow for
sufficient discussion time in the
Senate.
Faculty representatives also
approved a new charge for the
Committee on Foreign Study
Programs (C-FSP). The new charge
changes the board from an
administrative to an advisory agency.
Overseas Campuses Director Assoc.
History Prof. Mark Mancall will now
have the power to select faculty to

teach at the campuses, a duty which
previously belonged to the committee.
An amendment to require C-FSP
review of faculty members Mancall
selects failed.
The Senate also approved the
establishment of a new undergraduate
degree and academic program in
religious studies. The action coincided
with Provost William Miller's action
establishing a Department of Religious
Studies from the Humanities Special
Programs, effective in September.
Current Humanities Special
Programs Chairman William A. Clebsch
will chair the new Religious Studies
department, and English Prof.
Lawrence Ryan will assume the
humanities chairmanship, Miller
announced Thursday.

135 units, roughly three years of
academic work.
About one-third of the
approximately 450 undergraduates
who transfer here each year will be
affected by the new ruling, according
to the Registrar's Office. Most of these
students would lose credit for three
months' study elsewhere.
No'D's'
The measure also provides that
credit will be allowed only for work
graded "A", "B", "C", or "Pass." "We
no longer recognize a 'D' grade as a
mark of acceptable work," wrote
C-AAA Chairman Assoc. History Prof.
Philip Dawson in a statement

distributed to Senate members.
"We should point out that the
committee does not offer an elaborate
justification closely reasoned from
profound philosophical premises," the
statement continues.
"It simply seems to the committee
a practical and common-sense solution
to describe as a Stanford bachelor's
degree one which represents, to the
extent of at least 50 percent of the
academic work required, credit earned
at a Stanford campus."
Dawson did not deny the limit was
"arbitrarily chosen," but suggested
any other fraction was "equally
arbitrary. In our view, the question is
principally at what point one wishes to
describe a bachelor's degree as 'a
Stanford' degree," he wrote.
Acting Registrar Robert Houghton,
pleased with the Senate's action,
commented, "I'm glad to see the
committee's recommendation
approved. I don't think that it will
keep that many transfers from
applying or accepting if they're
admitted."
Houghton denied that the
resolution will discourage students
who would transfer here as seniors. "I
think we're probably getting more in
line with other universities in that a
student can't transfer in more work

than the first two years. But there's no
reason that somebody who is going to
transfer still won't do so and make up
the units that he loses above 90."
Credit Limit
Houghton was unable to name any
institutions which have a two-year
transfer credit limit.
According to the Office of
Undergraduate Admissions at
UC-Berkeley, students there may
receive as many as 159V& units of
transfer credit. Students with credit
above that limit may apply for special
consideration with the admissions
office. Berkeley students, like students
here, need 180 quarter-units to
graduate with a bachelor's degree.
Houghton indicated that the
students' transfer work above 90 units
"could still be used to meet University
writing and distribution
requirements." However, the student
would still need to complete the
additional 90 units here for a
bachelor's degree, he said.
ROTC Petition
In other Senate business, Senate
Chairman Mathematics Prof. Halsey
Royden announced the Senate
Steering Committee had postponed
until fall a petition to reinstate ROTC
circulated by Earth Sciences graduate
student Bob Barker. Royden indicated
that the petition, signed by
approximately 150 students, would be
rescheduled by the steering committee
of next year's Senate to allow for
sufficient discussion time in the
Senate.
Faculty representatives also
approved a new charge for the
Committee on Foreign Study
Programs (C-FSP). The new charge
changes the board from an
administrative to an advisory agency.
Overseas Campuses Director Assoc.
History Prof. Mark Mancall will now
have the power to select faculty to

teach at the campuses, a duty which
previously belonged to the committee.
An amendment to require C-FSP
review of faculty members Mancall
selects failed.
The Senate also approved the
establishment of a new undergraduate
degree and academic program in
religious studies. The action coincided
with Provost William Miller's action
establishing a Department of Religious
Studies from the Humanities Special
Programs, effective in September.
Current Humanities Special
Programs Chairman William A. Clebsch
will chair the new Religious Studies
department, and English Prof.
Lawrence Ryan will assume the
humanities chairmanship, Miller
announced Thursday.
The Faculty Senate Thursday
approved a measure which cut the
number of units which may be
transferred toward a bachelor's degree
here from 135 to 90.
The resolution from the Committee
on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement (C-AAA) will require
that from now on undergraduates
transferring into the University
complete the equivalent of two years'
academic work here for their
Bachelor's degree. Only students who
enter a co-terminal degree program or
a professional school will be allowed
to transfer the present maximum of
135 units, roughly three years of
academic work.
About one-third of the
