# Reply To Dan Kravetz
## On The Minority Houses 
### 
Jean Jerome

"Minority Housing
'Groupthink,'" the opinion
articles by Dan Kravetz that
appeared in Tuesday's and
Wednesday's Daily, presented a
very misinformed view of the
minority theme houses here at
Stanford. As a white who lives in
a concentration house, I think the
article not only has its facts wrong
but again shows our typical
white-American ethnocentricity.
First just factually: the theme
houses were not the "brainchild"
of the Housing Office, as the
article states, but only exist
because minority student groups,
such as BSU and MEChA, wanted
them, pushed for them, and
helped make them run.
But Tuesday's article also
assumes that groups like BSU and
MEChA "which purported to be
The Voice of students of the
respective ethnic groups," do not
really represent minority students
on campus. If this is so, why
should any minority student draw
into a theme house? No student,
including incoming freshmen, are
forced into a theme house but
must choose it by marking it as
one of their housing choices.
Only 50 Percent
Yet the article feels that "not
enough opportunities for a true
ethnic mix in housing have been
presented,", although not all
minority students even live in
concentration houses — for
example, with 400 Chicano
Stanford undergraduates, less than
50 live in Zapata. Theme houses
can only be 50 percent minority
students — this seems to me a
much better ethnic mix than the
typical Stanford all-white dorm
with one or two overwhelmed
minority students.
But the most important issue is
what the articles show about
white unawareness of other
cultures; perhaps in this Dan
Kravetz can find a clue to why
some Stanford whites get hassled
by some individual minority
students. Theme houses do not
create "myths" of cultural
differences, as the "Groupthink"
article feels. White culture in
America is no "myth;" the
Anglo-American does have a
distinct culture, as the thousands
of Stanford students who have
gone to overseas campuses should
be able to testify. But we whites
refuse to accept that other

cultures exist within this country
Does Dan Kravetz really think
that white society no longer tries
to mold everyone into its own
cultural pattern, that "the days
when conformity was the rule"
are over? Just let him listen to
Stanford whites make fun of
Mexican music and gritos to
mention one of the more blatant
examples of tolerance that I know
(and one of the many hassles that
minority students get in all-white
dorms, which somehow we whites
always forget when we complain
about minority concentration
houses.)
Conformist
It is just this white ignorance
and nonrecognition of different
cultures, such as shown in the
"Groupthink" article, that make
the white culture so oppressively
conformist, and "squabbles" over
music played in the dorm become
just another symbol of white
intolerance of anything different.
If whites are truly concerned by
the "physical violence to cold
stare" treatment received from
some minority students, maybe
whites should start making an
effort to learn about different
cultures, instead of always
expecting minorities to be the
friendly, ones, who
must play white music and come
and sit at the all-white tables at
dinner.
I think it is true that most
Stanford whites are intolerant at
worst and unaware or
disinterested at best of other
cultures, not only of blacks,
chicanos, Asians, and Indians on
campus but — judging from the
much-ignored International
Center — of other cultures all over
the world.
After all, theme houses can
only be 50 percent minority
students; that means they have
room for 50 percent white. If the
author of the article is so
concerned that students be
exposed to others of diverse
backgrounds, why do not more
whites want to lie in such theme
houses? Instead, many whites who
get "stuck" in theme houses take
no interest in the theme (minority
culture) but stick to their old
routine — with their same white
friends and segregated (formally
and informally) white parties. It is
only for them that theme houses

are failures.
Should Be Continued
I think theme houses are not
failures and should be continued
as a valuable cultural experience
for the minority students who
choose to live there and for
Stanford whites (the future rulers
of America). By being for once
submerged in a strange cultural
and racial environment (like
minority students are constantly
submerged in white culture),
perhaps we whites will become
more aware of what our own
culture is and so appreciate a little
better other cultures and
backgrounds and the feelings of
students who come from them.
And stop wondering why our
black (chicano, Asian, Indian)
friends resent being molded into
the image: Dark on the outside,
but underneath just like me (that
is, white).

students. Theme houses do not
create "myths" of cultural
differences, as the "Groupthink"
article feels. White culture in
America is no "myth;" the
Anglo-American does have a
distinct culture, as the thousands
of Stanford students who have
gone to overseas campuses should
be able to testify. But we whites
refuse to accept that other

cultures exist within this country
Does Dan Kravetz really think
that white society no longer tries
to mold everyone into its own
cultural pattern, that "the days
when conformity was the rule"
are over? Just let him listen to
Stanford whites make fun of
Mexican music and gritos to
mention one of the more blatant
examples of tolerance that I know
(and one of the many hassles that
minority students get in all-white
dorms, which somehow we whites
always forget when we complain
about minority concentration
houses.)
Conformist
It is just this white ignorance
and nonrecognition of different
cultures, such as shown in the
"Groupthink" article, that make
the white culture so oppressively
conformist, and "squabbles" over
music played in the dorm become
just another symbol of white
intolerance of anything different.
If whites are truly concerned by
the "physical violence to cold
stare" treatment received from
some minority students, maybe
whites should start making an
effort to learn about different
cultures, instead of always
expecting minorities to be the
friendly, ones, who
must play white music and come
and sit at the all-white tables at
dinner.
I think it is true that most
Stanford whites are intolerant at
worst and unaware or
disinterested at best of other
cultures, not only of blacks,
chicanos, Asians, and Indians on
campus but — judging from the
much-ignored International
Center — of other cultures all over
the world.
After all, theme houses can
only be 50 percent minority
students; that means they have
room for 50 percent white. If the
author of the article is so
concerned that students be
exposed to others of diverse
backgrounds, why do not more
whites want to lie in such theme
houses? Instead, many whites who
get "stuck" in theme houses take
no interest in the theme (minority
culture) but stick to their old
routine — with their same white
friends and segregated (formally
and informally) white parties. It is
only for them that theme houses

are failures.
Should Be Continued
I think theme houses are not
failures and should be continued
as a valuable cultural experience
for the minority students who
choose to live there and for
Stanford whites (the future rulers
of America). By being for once
submerged in a strange cultural
and racial environment (like
minority students are constantly
submerged in white culture),
perhaps we whites will become
more aware of what our own
culture is and so appreciate a little
better other cultures and
backgrounds and the feelings of
students who come from them.
And stop wondering why our
black (chicano, Asian, Indian)
friends resent being molded into
the image: Dark on the outside,
but underneath just like me (that
is, white).

"Minority Housing
'Groupthink,'" the opinion
articles by Dan Kravetz that
appeared in Tuesday's and
Wednesday's Daily, presented a
very misinformed view of the
minority theme houses here at
Stanford. As a white who lives in
a concentration house, I think the
article not only has its facts wrong
but again shows our typical
white-American ethnocentricity.
First just factually: the theme
houses were not the "brainchild"
of the Housing Office, as the
article states, but only exist
because minority student groups,
such as BSU and MEChA, wanted
them, pushed for them, and
helped make them run.
But Tuesday's article also
assumes that groups like BSU and
MEChA "which purported to be
The Voice of students of the
respective ethnic groups," do not
really represent minority students
on campus. If this is so, why
should any minority student draw
into a theme house? No student,
including incoming freshmen, are
forced into a theme house but
must choose it by marking it as
one of their housing choices.
Only 50 Percent
Yet the article feels that "not
enough opportunities for a true
ethnic mix in housing have been
presented,", although not all
minority students even live in
concentration houses — for
example, with 400 Chicano
Stanford undergraduates, less than
50 live in Zapata. Theme houses
can only be 50 percent minority
students — this seems to me a
much better ethnic mix than the
typical Stanford all-white dorm
with one or two overwhelmed
minority students.
But the most important issue is
what the articles show about
white unawareness of other
cultures; perhaps in this Dan
Kravetz can find a clue to why
some Stanford whites get hassled
by some individual minority
students. Theme houses do not
create "myths" of cultural

only be 50 percent minority
students; that means they have
room for 50 percent white. If the
author of the article is so
concerned that students be
exposed to others of diverse
backgrounds, why do not more
whites want to lie in such theme
houses? Instead, many whites who
get "stuck" in theme houses take
no interest in the theme (minority
culture) but stick to their old
routine — with their same white
friends and segregated (formally
and informally) white parties. It is
only for them that theme houses

are failures.
Should Be Continued
I think theme houses are not
failures and should be continued
as a valuable cultural experience
for the minority students who
choose to live there and for
Stanford whites (the future rulers
of America). By being for once
submerged in a strange cultural
and racial environment (like
minority students are constantly
submerged in white culture),
perhaps we whites will become
more aware of what our own
culture is and so appreciate a little
better other cultures and
backgrounds and the feelings of
students who come from them.
And stop wondering why our
black (chicano, Asian, Indian)
friends resent being molded into
the image: Dark on the outside,
but underneath just like me (that
is, white).

"Minority Housing
'Groupthink,'" the opinion
articles by Dan Kravetz that
appeared in Tuesday's and
Wednesday's Daily, presented a
very misinformed view of the
minority theme houses here at
Stanford. As a white who lives in
a concentration house, I think the
article not only has its facts wrong
but again shows our typical
white-American ethnocentricity.
First just factually: the theme
houses were not the "brainchild"
of the Housing Office, as the
article states, but only exist
because minority student groups,
such as BSU and MEChA, wanted
them, pushed for them, and
helped make them run.
But Tuesday's article also
assumes that groups like BSU and
MEChA "which purported to be
The Voice of students of the
respective ethnic groups," do not
really represent minority students
on campus. If this is so, why
should any minority student draw
into a theme house? No student,
including incoming freshmen, are
forced into a theme house but
must choose it by marking it as
one of their housing choices.
Only 50 Percent
Yet the article feels that "not
enough opportunities for a true
ethnic mix in housing have been
presented,", although not all
minority students even live in
concentration houses — for
example, with 400 Chicano
Stanford undergraduates, less than
50 live in Zapata. Theme houses
can only be 50 percent minority
students — this seems to me a
much better ethnic mix than the
typical Stanford all-white dorm
with one or two overwhelmed
minority students.
But the most important issue is
what the articles show about
white unawareness of other
cultures; perhaps in this Dan
Kravetz can find a clue to why
some Stanford whites get hassled
by some individual minority
students. Theme houses do not
create "myths" of cultural
differences, as the "Groupthink"
article feels. White culture in
America is no "myth;" the
Anglo-American does have a
distinct culture, as the thousands
of Stanford students who have
gone to overseas campuses should
be able to testify. But we whites
refuse to accept that other

cultures exist within this country
Does Dan Kravetz really think
that white society no longer tries
to mold everyone into its own
cultural pattern, that "the days
when conformity was the rule"
are over? Just let him listen to
Stanford whites make fun of
Mexican music and gritos to
mention one of the more blatant
examples of tolerance that I know
(and one of the many hassles that
minority students get in all-white
dorms, which somehow we whites
always forget when we complain
about minority concentration
houses.)
Conformist
It is just this white ignorance
and nonrecognition of different
cultures, such as shown in the
"Groupthink" article, that make
the white culture so oppressively
conformist, and "squabbles" over
music played in the dorm become
just another symbol of white
intolerance of anything different.
If whites are truly concerned by
the "physical violence to cold
stare" treatment received from
some minority students, maybe
whites should start making an
effort to learn about different
cultures, instead of always
expecting minorities to be the
friendly, ones, who
must play white music and come
and sit at the all-white tables at
dinner.
I think it is true that most
Stanford whites are intolerant at
worst and unaware or
disinterested at best of other
cultures, not only of blacks,
chicanos, Asians, and Indians on
campus but — judging from the
much-ignored International
Center — of other cultures all over
the world.
After all, theme houses can
only be 50 percent minority
students; that means they have
room for 50 percent white. If the
author of the article is so
concerned that students be
exposed to others of diverse
backgrounds, why do not more

houses? Instead, many whites who
