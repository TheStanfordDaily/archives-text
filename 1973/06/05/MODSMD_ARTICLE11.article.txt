## No On New C-15

The Daily editorial last
Thursday endorsing the judicial
system recently proposed by C-15
either was consciously meant to
deceive Daily readers or
demonstrates a gross
misunderstanding of the character
of that proposed judicial system.
You claim, "The
system . . . includes a
guilt-determining panel with a
majority of student members."
What you fail to add is that: "In
order to get faculty and
administration members of the
C-15 to approve a student
majority, students on the
committee agreed to a provision
stating: 'Upon determining that
the SJC is impaired by the
composition of that body, the
University President, or two-thirds
of those members of the ASSU
Senate present and voting or
two-thirds of those members of
the Academic Senate present and
voting may reduce the number of
student positions on the SJC by
one.' If this right were exercised,
then the composition of the SJC
would be identical to the current
Campus Judicial Panel . . . ." (This
quote is from Kevin Smith's story
on the judicial proposal, Daily,
May 29, emphasis added.)
This, of course, means the
student majority exists only so
long as Dick Lyman remains

satisfied the students aren't acting
"irresponsibly." Whatever you
want to say about this kind of
judicial system, certainly
can't claim it establishes "the
appearance of fairness."
Clever And Slick
In every election held so far,
students have indicated they want
their judicial system to contain a
student majority. The C-15
proposal is a clever and slick plan
appearing to satisfy student
interests while actually accepting
the institutional arrangements the
administration has always desired.
Jim Anderson, Scott Burke, et
al should not be commended for
their work but rather should be
severely castigated for failing to
represent their constituency's
interests. The plan they supported
should be rejected by the ASSU
Senate. If we are to have a judicial
system with a faculty majority, let
it at least be one not approved by
the students. Let it, in other
words, reflect accurately where
power lies in this university.

Seven Students

The Daily editorial last
Thursday endorsing the judicial
system recently proposed by C-15
either was consciously meant to
deceive Daily readers or
demonstrates a gross
misunderstanding of the character
of that proposed judicial system.
You claim, "The
system . . . includes a
guilt-determining panel with a
majority of student members."
What you fail to add is that: "In
order to get faculty and
administration members of the
C-15 to approve a student
majority, students on the
committee agreed to a provision
stating: 'Upon determining that
the SJC is impaired by the
composition of that body, the
University President, or two-thirds
of those members of the ASSU
Senate present and voting or
two-thirds of those members of
the Academic Senate present and
voting may reduce the number of
student positions on the SJC by
one.' If this right were exercised,
then the composition of the SJC
would be identical to the current
Campus Judicial Panel . . . ." (This
quote is from Kevin Smith's story
on the judicial proposal, Daily,
May 29, emphasis added.)
This, of course, means the
student majority exists only so
long as Dick Lyman remains

satisfied the students aren't acting
"irresponsibly." Whatever you
want to say about this kind of
judicial system, certainly
can't claim it establishes "the
appearance of fairness."
Clever And Slick
In every election held so far,
students have indicated they want
their judicial system to contain a
student majority. The C-15
proposal is a clever and slick plan
appearing to satisfy student
interests while actually accepting
the institutional arrangements the
administration has always desired.
Jim Anderson, Scott Burke, et
al should not be commended for
their work but rather should be
severely castigated for failing to
represent their constituency's
interests. The plan they supported
should be rejected by the ASSU
Senate. If we are to have a judicial
system with a faculty majority, let
it at least be one not approved by
the students. Let it, in other
words, reflect accurately where
power lies in this university.
