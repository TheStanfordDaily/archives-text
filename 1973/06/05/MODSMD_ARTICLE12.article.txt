## Priorities 
### 
This has been the year of the victimless crime obsession at
Stanford.
In a year marked by the bombing of Cambodia and the energy
crisis, vocal members of the Stanford community have redirected their
priorities. The burning issuer on campus this spring have been: a
fraternity rush party, the life-jtyles of five freshmen girls, and 147
column inches of advertisement.
No one was directly injured because of the Phi Delt raffle, the
Dollies' philosophy, or the Jews for Jesus ad, but certain groups on
campus have screamed out in pain for the greater part of an academic
quarter. This all seems silly when people are losing livelihoods in
America because of the energy crunch and lives in Cambodia because
of criminal bombing.
Many have claimed that they are victims of the transgressions of
the Phi Delts, the Dollies, and the Jews for Jesus, and these incidents
may very well have offended the sensibilities and ideals of people on
campus. Being offended, however, must rank fairly low on anyone's
list of priorities. But emotionalism and a pinch of paranoia allowed
people to get wrapped up in violent reactions to issues that the
passage of time has already rendered fairly insignificant.
Some people managed to comment on larger issues facing us when
involved in reaction to pressing local matters. All of a sudden the Phi
Delts and Dollies were responsible for the attitudes that created
Cambodia and Watergate. This type of logic is appalling.
The spirit of Stanford has been built on a vibrant exchange of ideas
over the years. Many of the brightest people in the country have
gathered here and seen the need for free speech and honesty in all
levels of our society and government.
This has all been perverted, for now we see sections of the
community trying to eradicate things which offend or displease them.
Some of the dollies believe in motherhood and God, concepts which
some people here find offensive. Judging from the intensity of the
reaction, the "victims" of the dollies' lifestyles would rather that
those purveyors of pom pons disappear or change their views. Then
the community would not have to be subjected to such offensiveness.
To be fair, it must be understood that the "victims" are the vocal
few. Many of the people here who happened to disagree with the
dollies, recognize their right to live their own lives. The problem is
that Stanford has depended on the vocal few to bring important issues
to the community's attention. People on this campus slowly became
aware of the injustices of Viet Nam and the draft through the efforts
of a few who made speeches, distributed pamphlets, and wrote
articles.
People are not confronting the community with the issues that
really matter now and we have been bogged down in fraternities,
dollies, and the Jews for Jesus.
We are all intelligent enough to reject that which either offends us
or counters our positions. Upon seeing a rival organization waste
almost $350 on an inane advertisement, one should chuckle instead of
scream.
There are enough crimes in this world with real victims that should
receive our attention instead of wasting time and energy on victimless
crimes.
Increased tolerance on campus, and a sincere caring about the
really important issues would benefit us all.
