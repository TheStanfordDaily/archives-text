# Too Far From Center
## Why Not McGovern! 
### 
Hall Daily

In May 1848, the Hon.
Andrew Stevenson of Va.
assumed the chair at the
Democratic National Convention
proclaiming that national
conventions to nominate
presidential candidates "springing
immediately from the people have
become the only practicable mode
of uniting and giving effect to the
popular will."
While this practice remains
ostensibly secure, the methods of
selective nomination within a
two-party system are under
constant scrutiny: notably, the
lately-reformed rules of the
Democratic Party.
These rules revolve around the
attempted synthesis of an
ambiguously-defined concept of
full and equal representation
(often alluded to as "quotas"),
and the quadrennially-tested
structure of majority rule
democracy.
The result was the nomination
of George McGovern for
President.
Murray Roth bard contends
(Daily, 4/27/73) that the
Democrats' reform rules are an
unsuccessful replacement for
decision-making in smoke-filled
rooms "when the duly and freely
elected Democratic delegates from
Illinois were denied their seats
because the composition of the
delegation did not satisfy the new
quota standards."
New Deal
"It's the same stacked deck
we've had for a hundred years,"
said one wizened delegate on the
Democratic credentials
committee, "it's just a new set of
dealers."
More important than the fact
that power-brokering continues to
take place, it is the make-up of
this select decision-making group
which seems to be of utmost
importance.
But was McGovern the truly
representative party candidate?
No. Marquis de Condorcet
pointed out the intransitivities
and inconsistencies of the
majority decision-making rule
nearly 200 years ago. Condorcet's
principle would call for three
voters and three candidates. The
first voter — let's say — prefers
McGovern to Humphrey, and
Humphrey to Wallace. The second
selected Humphrey over Wallace,
but Wallace over McGovern. The
third chose Wallace over
McGovern, and McGovern over
Humphrey.
Thus individually, each voter's
preferences are clear; but
collectively, there is no majority
choice. Should such a stalemate
have becalmed the Democratic

convention?
No. McGovern was not as often
a second, third or even fourth
choice preference of the voters of
his party as he was the last choice.
Indeed, two out of three
Wallace supporters chose Richard
Nixon over McGovern, according
to the New York Times. Further
Times' investigation found that
between 22 and 40 percent of
Humphrey's supporters would
rather opt for Nixon than stay
with their party with McGovern as
the nominee.
Collapsed Center
According to Republican Kevin
Phillips, the 1972 primary process
was highly destructive to the
Democrats' best interests in
November. The right and left
wings of the party, through the
candidacies of Wallace and
McGovern respectively,
eventuated the collapse of first
Edmund Muskie then Humphrey
as front-runners and
representatives of the FDR
Coalition-Democratic party
center.
In World magazine (8/1/72),
Democrat Ben Wattenburg
contended that "contrary to the
notion that in the eye of the

angry, disaffected voter Wallace
and McGovern were becoming
interchangeable, the Wallace voter
happens to be angry in a way that
makes him undeliverabie, even by
Wallace, to a left-leaning
Democratic candidate."
Following the convention,
Wattenburg foresaw the mass
flight of Democrats away from
the McGovern campaign. He also
pegged Henry Jackson and
Humphrey as successors to the
Wallaceite right and extrapolated
that defections from their
hypothetical candidacy in the
November election would result in
backing for a "fourth party,
perhaps, or just to the kind of
apathy that, negatively anyway,
equals votes for the Republicans."
The only note of optimism
emanating from the Democrats'
recent experimentation is of some
consolation to ardent political
skeptics; at least the
trial-and-error system is still being
exercised and more hard data
concerning what decision-making
principles won't work continues
to grow.

According to Republican Kevin
Phillips, the 1972 primary process
was highly destructive to the
Democrats' best interests in
November. The right and left
wings of the party, through the
candidacies of Wallace and
McGovern respectively,
eventuated the collapse of first
Edmund Muskie then Humphrey
as front-runners and
representatives of the FDR
Coalition-Democratic party
center.
In World magazine (8/1/72),
Democrat Ben Wattenburg
contended that "contrary to the
notion that in the eye of the

angry, disaffected voter Wallace
and McGovern were becoming
interchangeable, the Wallace voter
happens to be angry in a way that
makes him undeliverabie, even by
Wallace, to a left-leaning
Democratic candidate."
Following the convention,
Wattenburg foresaw the mass
flight of Democrats away from
the McGovern campaign. He also
pegged Henry Jackson and
Humphrey as successors to the
Wallaceite right and extrapolated
that defections from their
hypothetical candidacy in the
November election would result in
backing for a "fourth party,
perhaps, or just to the kind of
apathy that, negatively anyway,
equals votes for the Republicans."
The only note of optimism
emanating from the Democrats'
recent experimentation is of some
consolation to ardent political
skeptics; at least the
trial-and-error system is still being
exercised and more hard data

In May 1848, the Hon.
Andrew Stevenson of Va.
assumed the chair at the
Democratic National Convention
proclaiming that national
conventions to nominate
presidential candidates "springing
immediately from the people have
become the only practicable mode
of uniting and giving effect to the
popular will."
While this practice remains
ostensibly secure, the methods of
selective nomination within a
two-party system are under
constant scrutiny: notably, the
lately-reformed rules of the
Democratic Party.
These rules revolve around the
attempted synthesis of an
ambiguously-defined concept of
full and equal representation
(often alluded to as "quotas"),
and the quadrennially-tested
structure of majority rule
democracy.
The result was the nomination
of George McGovern for
President.
Murray Roth bard contends
(Daily, 4/27/73) that the
Democrats' reform rules are an
unsuccessful replacement for
decision-making in smoke-filled
rooms "when the duly and freely
elected Democratic delegates from
Illinois were denied their seats
because the composition of the
delegation did not satisfy the new
quota standards."

"It's the same stacked deck
we've had for a hundred years,"
said one wizened delegate on the
Democratic credentials
committee, "it's just a new set of
dealers."
More important than the fact
that power-brokering continues to
take place, it is the make-up of
this select decision-making group
which seems to be of utmost
importance.
But was McGovern the truly
representative party candidate?
No. Marquis de Condorcet
pointed out the intransitivities
and inconsistencies of the
majority decision-making rule
nearly 200 years ago. Condorcet's
principle would call for three
voters and three candidates. The
first voter — let's say — prefers
McGovern to Humphrey, and
Humphrey to Wallace. The second
selected Humphrey over Wallace,
but Wallace over McGovern. The
third chose Wallace over
McGovern, and McGovern over
Humphrey.
Thus individually, each voter's
preferences are clear; but
collectively, there is no majority
choice. Should such a stalemate
have becalmed the Democratic

convention?
No. McGovern was not as often
a second, third or even fourth
choice preference of the voters of
his party as he was the last choice.
Indeed, two out of three
Wallace supporters chose Richard
Nixon over McGovern, according
to the New York Times. Further
Times' investigation found that
between 22 and 40 percent of
Humphrey's supporters would
rather opt for Nixon than stay
with their party with McGovern as
