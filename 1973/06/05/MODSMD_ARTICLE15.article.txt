A Stanford Man
on Stanford Sexism
As a male Stanford graduate
student, I am increasingly
embarrassed by and angered at
this University's flagrant
discrimination against women.
Such discrimination originated in
the University's founding charter,
which contained a specific quota
for women students. From 1891
to 1973, Stanford sexism has not
only persisted; it has in many
ways become more pervasive. No
doubt, female members of the
Stanford "community" can offer
numerous cases of such sexism;
for my purposes, three examples
will suffice:
(1) Although there are over
4000 women students alone at
Stanford, Cowell Health Center,
with its otherwise more than
adequate physical and mental
health staff, provides no full-time
gynecologist. Some women have
had to wait several weeks before
being able to see the part-time
gynecologist.
(2) The two departments in
which I study, history and
humanities, will have, between
them, one female faculty member
during the 1973-74 academic year
— this out of over 40 total
faculty. It is quite possible,
though by no means certain, that
the faculties in each department
have not consciously
discriminated against women in

making promotions and new
appointments. Neither have they
been particularly sensitive,
however, to the need for and
advantages of having a higher
proportion of female faculty
within their respective disciplines.
(3) A respected, tenured faculty
member has told a number of his
students, some of them women,
that "There has never been a
first-rate woman intellectual."
Granted that any faculty member
has the right to spout whatever
foolery he wishes — enough
faculty have certainly availed
themselves of that right — it is
nevertheless neither sensitive nor
intelligent of us who think
otherwise to have acquiesced to
statements such as that for so
long.
The "us" of the above sentence
refers almost exclusively to us
men. From the obvious reasons of
self-interest and ego, and from the
way we men too have become
stereotyped and categorized into
"male" roles, the issue of sexism
makes us uncomfortable, indeed,
makes us squirm some. We have
long known, after all, on which
side we fought in the "battle of
the sexes." For years, too many
of us have been conditioned to
relate to women "strategically,"
that is, in terms of conquest, be in
sexual, psychological, or
intellectual. Thus our
unwillingness or inability to
protest in the past institutional

discrimination or intellectual
stereotypes, both of which we
intuitively sensed was degrading.
For by stereotyping women,
we trap outselves in a
counter-stereotype; sexism is thus
demeaning to all of us as humans,
as people with both "masculine"
and "feminine" traits. The time
has long since come for us men to
join our sisters in denouncing and
fighting against sexism whenever
it occurs. For as anti-Semitism
and racism are not strictly Jewish
and black or Chicano or Native
American issues, respectively, so
must sexism not be relegated to a
strictly "female" issue.

Committee Positions
Editor:
As a member of the ASSU
Committee on Nominations I
helped interview and nominate
the current student members of
the Committee of 15.
As part of his or her interview

each applicant was asked if he or
she would vote to propose
amendments to the Legislative
and Judicial Charter of 1968, as
amended, if the amendments did
not contain one or more of the
following provisions:
1. Trial by a jury of one's
peers. Trial by students and
faculty if both students and
faculty can be defendants. Trial
by students alone if only students
can be defendants.
2. The same method of
selection for faculty and student
members of the judicial body.
3. A guarantee to defendants
of all the rights they are granted
by the United States and
California constitutions.
4. A student majority on the
judicial body in all cases where
students are defendants.
Each person nominated by the
ASSU Committee on Nominations
for a position on the Committee
of 15 said he would vote against
any amendments that did not
contain one or more of the above
provisions.
The applicants were asked
about those specific provisions

because it was the expressed will
of the student body that any
amended or new Legislative and
Judicial Charter contain all of
those provisions. The student
body had expressed itself via
referenda and the Senate of the
ASSU.
It was common knowledge
what the student body and hence,
presumably, the Committee on
Nominations considered "correct"
answers to the questions asked
applicants by the committee. Any
applicant could give the "correct"
answers whether or not the
applicant was giving truthful
answers.
I tried to convince the other
members of the committee to
choose nominees based on
evidence other than answers to
those questions. A majority of the
Committee on Nominations
believed that the only way to test
an applicant's truthfulness was to
appoint him to the Committee of
15. We now know which
appointees were telling the truth.

Give 'Em The R.A.
Editor:
Everyone is familiar with the
adage that it is not important
what you know but who you
know. It seems that the above
statement certainly is of value
regarding the selection of
residence staff this year by the
Resident Fellows and the Dean of
Students Office. While it is
patently unfair to make negative
generalizations that apply to all
residences and procedures used at
these residences we believe that it
would aid in the selection of next
years staff if more attention were
paid to the candidates credentials
rather than his connections.
This year every candidate
heard stories about staff members
who were appointed to certain
residences because they "were
friends of the R.A." or knew the
Resident Fellow. While this is not
necessarily bad in itself in a pool
of "3uo qualified candidates"
efforts should be made to
examine a candidates credentials
more thoroughly. Some resident
staffs were extremely fair and
complete in their examination of
candidates. Others, perhaps too
many, were not.
We suggest that the housing
office in the future make a
concerted effort to discourage
croniism (which is ultimately
impossible) where it interferes in
the selection or rejection of

perfectly qualified candidates for
staff positions in the housing
system.

President's Position
Commended
Editor:
The ASSU Council of
Presidents should be commended
for their statement of opposition
to the continuing Indochina war
(reported last week in the Daily).
Several years ago, it was
half-seriously suggested that the
United States should simply
declare victory in Indochina and
withdraw.
In effect, President Nixon
followed this suggestion. But he
continued to prosecute the war
from the air, and to sustain a war
by proxy on the ground, using
Saigon troops maintained by the
U.S.
Stanford, and most other
campuses, can be characterized as
dramatically quiescent this year.
Our new ASSU co-presidents
should be encouraged to establish
opportunities for students to learn
about and work against the
continuing American attacks on
the land and people of Indochina.
