# Rothbard Discusses Libertarianism
## 
### 
Editor's Note: Earlier this year, former Daily staffer Ed
Kohn, now a reporter for the Greenville (Miss.) Delta
Democrat-Times, and Daily columnist Bill Evers
interviewed Professor Murray N. Rothbard, a leading
proponent of libertarianism. Dr. Rothbard teaches
economics at Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute. In addition
to his writings in academic journals, Rothbard has been
published in political magazines like Ramparts and
National Review. He is the author of several books on
economic subjects. Most recently, he co-edited with
historian Ronald Radosh an anthology called A New
History of Leviathan and wrote a political manifesto
called For A New Liberty, just published by Macmillan.
What follows is an edited transcript of that interview.
DAILY: You caM yourself a libertarian. What's the social
philosophy that you believe in? Could you say in a few
words what its important principles and key aspects are?
ROTHBARD: Very briefly, Libertarianism is the view
that each individual should have the liberty to control his
own life and to exercise his full rights of action, except to
the extent that he injures or interferes with the property
rights or full rights of other people. Put broadly, of
course, a lot of people would agree with this, without
fully accepting it in its full consistency. A libertarian
applies this; takes this fundamental axiom and applies it
to the entire sphere of all social relations.
DAILY: More specifically, what rights are entailed?
ROTHBARD: First of all, the libertarian view is that each
person has the absolute right to control and own his own
body, to direct it and so forth, without outside control or
interference. Call that the right to self-ownership.
Secondly, he has the right to what he produces, material
objects, for example, the iron ore he transforms into steel
bars or the clay that he transforms into sculpture.
If he has the right to own himself and what he
produces, then it follows from that that he has the right
to exchange these things, these objects that he produces,
for other objects that other people produce, and to
exchange these rights of ownership. This gives everyone
the full right to the thing that he has purchased. And if he
has a full right to do that, then he has the right to give his
property away to other people who are willing to receive
it, which establishes the full right of inheritance. In other
words, if a person gives something away to his children,
his children have the right to receive it. This transmits the
property right. These property rights are absolute. They

'Libertarianism is the vietc that
each individual should have the
liberty to control his life and to
exercise his full rights of action. 9

are not to be interfered with by any outside agency, by
any other party or group of people.
The other simple rights, the so-called human rights,
which many people are concerned with, really boil down,
if they're not contradictory, to expressions of property
rights, subsets of property rights. For example, there is
the so-called right of free speech which many people will
say that they advocate. Many non-libertarians in the full
sense will say, "Yes, we're in favor of free speech." But
when you look at it, what does the right of free speech
entail? For example, you could say that a person should
have the right to hire a hall and address whoever comes in
there without outside interference. Or he should have the
right to print a pamphlet and make it available for sale.
What you're really saying is that he should have the
property right to hire a hall, if the property owner of the
hall wishes to sell it or rent it to him. He should have the
property right to hire a piinter to print his leaflets. On the
other hand, he does not have the right to free speech in
the sense that he has the right to barge into my apartment
and harangue me for eight hours. When he does that, he's
invading my property rights, and I have the right to kick
him out.
So there really are no other so-called human rights,
except as a subset of the property rights I've been talking
about: the right of self-ownership and the right of
production and sale.
DAILY: How do you analyze, in terms of your
philosophy, the Indochina war and American intervention
there?
ROTHBARD: To apply this thing consistently, the
libertarian would have to say: One of the prime things we
are doing in Indochina is the systematic bombing of an
innocent civilian population, the indigenous Indochinese
peasant population. At the very least you can say this is
invading their right to life, the right to self-ownership. As
a libertarian, I can see no justification whatsoever for this.
You may even call this a policy of systematic mass
murder.
I see certain considerations which prevent people from
saying this, which prevent "Middle America"from
perceiving this. After all the government is doing it. If a
group of vigilantes, a group of private citizens, banded
together and said, "From now on we're going to start
bombing Indochina systematically. We don't like
Indochinese peasants. They're Commie. We don't like
their color." If they started bombing, most Americans
would condemn them, as murders, bandits. If on the other
hand the government of the United States does it, then it
becomes legitimate and sanctified in some way. It's a
reason of state. Or the President knows because he has
special information.
What you have is a situation where most people apply a
certain set of moral principles to private citizens and
private groups, so that if private citizens suddenly start
looting stores, they're called criminals, bandits, mafiosi,
rioters, hooligans, etc. They're generally condemned and
therefore their activities are kept in check by this public
condemnation and vigilance. If on the other hand, the
government loots stores, this is called taxation, or it's
called eminent domain.
We have a situation here where you have a sort of
permanent cop-out. If anybody else or any other
institution or any other organization in society does
something, the Golden Rule, or the law against murder or
the law against theft, generally accepted moral rules apply
to all these people. But if the government does it, it's not
bad. It's not theft, it's taxation. It's conscription, rather
than slavery. It is war, instead of mass murder. What the
libertarian does is simply apply these basic, generally
agreed-upon principles to government. In foreign affairs,
in particular, this analysis yields what are at first startling
results.
DAILY: What about "just wars?"
ROTHBARD: War becomes a criminal activity and unjust
when innocent civilians get murdered, civilians meaning
those who are not voluntary enlisters in the great struggle.
If the government of Ruritania, to take a hypothetical
nation, declares war, the people get sucked into it. First of
all, they have to pay taxes for the war effort. Second of
all, they are usually conscripted; they're drafted into the
war effort. Third of all, as modern weapons come in,
they're bombed and shelled. The scope of modern
weaponry doesn't permit governments to pinpoint them,
even if they wanted to, against the soldiers and thus spare
the civilians. Of course, with modern military theory, you
have to smash the civilian population anyway. Any war
nowadays involves massacre or slaughter of innocent
civilians. So I don't think any war has been just for a long,
long time, certainly no twentieth-century war.
There are degrees of injustice. For example, the least

unjust war I can think of recently is the Bangladesh
situation. The population of Bangladesh was almost
unanimously in favor of getting the hell out of Pakistan.
Pakistan had previously aggressed against the Bengalis.
They're completely different, ethnically, culturally, and
every other way. The government of Bangladesh was
[before its secession from Pakistan] run by Punjabis or
West Pakistanis. They were extracting money from the
Bengalis or East Pakistanis through taxation and handing
it over to the West Pakistanis. So it was a clear-cut case of
the Bengalis wanting to git cut of this thing, forming their
own independent government. Then the war began.
The only people in favor of Pakistan in Bangladesh
itself were the hired mercenary army and administrative
apparatus. So what you had was a "people's war" against
the administrative apparatus. I consider that perfectly
legitimate. The masses rose up and started shooting or
popping off at the government officials who were imposed
on them in any case from West Pakistan. The West
Pakistanis, on the other hand, in order to stop this had to
try to slaughter as much of the civilian population as they
could. The only way to suppress a popular uprising is to
shoot all leaders, shoot all intellectuals. There you
certainly have a just revolution against West Pakistan.
Secondly, when the Indian government came in, here's
the war situation as opposed to revolution. The Indian
government comes in on the side of the Bengalis. Jt's
unjust technically. The Indian people are taxed in order, to
pay for this. The Indians are conscripted into it. They
were forced to fight. Everything else about it was just in
the sense that the Indians were fighting for their Bengali
iomrades across the border.
OAILY: To get into your own academic field, could you
comment on Nixon's wage-price controls?
ROTHBARD: It's well known that the President put on
wage-price controls on the black day of August 15,1971,
itf'ter having for more than two years denounced
wage-price controls as ineffective, dictatorial, and
unworkable. The scary thing about that is that it is typical
of Nixon's policies generally.
He did it on Sunday night on television without any
warning whatsoever. In other words, Sunday night he gets
on TV. He says, "Because of the mounting crisis, I hereby
push every button. Even as of this moment, price and
wage controls are now on. As of this moment, we are
marching into Cambodia .. .." Or something like that.
The response of the American public is the most
frightening thing about it. A great cheer goes up at the
decisiveness and strength of our great President, that he is
able to marshal resources so quickly and forcefully.
Especially with wage-price controls, even more than
Cambodia.
There was hardly a single organized group or
prominent person who did not cheer this to the rafters.
"Yes, we needed it all the time, Mr. President. It's
magnificent."
This is true even among businessmen who had
previously said they were in favor of the free market and
against price-wage controls, among some labor union
leaders who had said they were against it, even among
economists, 99 percent of whom had always been against
price-wage controls. It's the one area of the free market
that economists had been pretty strong on. They all either
kept quiet or else went along and said, "Yes, it's a good
thing. Of course we're against controls in general. But in
this particular circumstance, it might be a good thing for
the American masses."
What we see is a situation where the American publie
and the American opinion leaders and business groups are
now willing to go along ex post with anything the
American President announces whatsoever. That's the
really scary thing.
I'm almost convinced, this is only half-joke, that if
Nixon got on the air tomorrow night and said, "Because
of special conditions, I hereby declare the atom-bombing
of Portugal. The American planes are at this moment
flying over Portugal to bomb it."
I think the American public would say, "Great. It's
about time we taught those Portuguese a lesson." We are
getting to the point where there's nothing the President
cannot announce by pure whim and get away with it.
As far as the economics of it goes, we had a situation
where inflation had proceeded and accelerated for many
years. It kept getting worse. Inflation would be going up
two to three percent a year, say in the sixties. In the late
sixties, it would be four-five percent, six-seven percent. It
would be almost an exponential increase in the rate of
inflation.
Most economists by this time and President Nixon
particularly (having had advisers in this camp) knew darn
well what the cause of this was. The major cause of it was
the fact that the money supply was going up at an
accelerated rate. The money supply is completely and
totally under the control of the federal government. There
is nothing in any other area of the economy that is so
totally controlled by the federal government as the money
supply. In effect, the Federal Reserve System, which is of
course part of the federal government, can determine the
money supply to the last nickel.
What they do is they keep increasing it. The method by
which they increase it is technical, arcane and not
understood by anybody except economists. What the
government is doing is, in effect, printing more money.
That's not precisely what they do, but it's the
equivalent of legalized counterfeiting, the government
standing in the basement of the Federal Reserve System
and printing more dollar bills and then lending them out
or spending them. The result of this is an increased money
supply, and prices keep going up.

'If private citizens suddenly
start looting stores, they're
called criminals .... If on the
other hand, the government
loots stores, this is called taxa
tion, or it's called eminent
domain

President Nixon knew this, and continued to do it
anyway for various reasons. Inflation is always amenable
to the government for a very good reason. If I had control
of the money supply for some reason, and the government
came to me and said, "Look, Rothbard, we're handing to
you the entire control over the printing press. You're to
determine the money supply, you can print as much as
you want and spend as much as you want." Even I would
be tempted to start using it a little bit. Obviously it's
easier to print money than to go out and earn it or even
tax people, which annoys them.
Printing money is a quiet, pleasant process. You print
the money, go out and spend it, and nobody really knows
what's going on. So anybody who has the right of
legalized counterfeiting will use it and tend to use it more
and more to get revenue. This is what the government
does.
The government allocates to itself the right of
monopoly counterfeiting and they use it. So the result of
that is increased prices. The public doesn't like increased

prices, and the question is what do you do about it. And
the temptation for the government is not to stop the
printing presses, stop inflating the money supply. The
temptation is to keep on counterfeiting, which is what the
government did, and what Nixon did, and blame
everybody else for it. Blame the public for inflation.
Blame businessmen for being greedy enough to raise
prices. Blame labor unions for being greedy enough to ask
for more money. Blame consumers for being too piggy
and eiting too much.
Ard then the government says, "What we're going to
do is this: You people out there are causing inflationary
problems, and you're asking for too much money, you're
asking for higher wage rates. But we're going to be nice to
you. We don't want to force you not to inflate, but we
will impose voluntary guidelines. We're going to ask you
please not to raise prices more than three percent a year."
Meantime, the government is pumping money in at the
rate of 10 percent, eight percent a year. Prices then go up
more than three percent a year.
After a year or two of this, which is essentially what
the Johnson administration did for several years, the
government says: "OK, from now on, no more Mr. Nice
Guy. We gave you a chance. We asked you please not to
keep on raising prices." It's as if the people decide
voluntarily what sort of prices they're going to charge,
which is not economically the way it works. Prices are
determined by supply and demand. As demand goes up,
prices will inevitably go up, and the demand has to go up,
because the government has been printing more money all
this time.
So now coercion comes in, and you force people not to
raise prices. Then, black markets develop; shortages
develop. And there are various areas where you can't
control the price. It's almost impossible. Quality declines,
for example.
You have to have an army of 10 million expert
Gestapo inspectors to try to find out whether some guy is
putting in as much chocolate as he was three weeks ago.
How many almonds per quart is he putting in the
caramel almond crunch ice cream? The quality begins to
deteriorate pretty rapidly.
At first, businessmen loved the controls. When the
controls came in on August 15, big business, the Chamber
of Commerce, NAM [the National Association of
Manufacturers], thought it was a great thing. Why did
they thing it was a great thing? They said, "Well, of
course, we're in favor of the free market in general, but
this is a great thing because unions are beginning to get
too rambunctious. They're beginning to ask for too much
money." What they really meant was that union wage
rates which had lagged behind, which usually happens in
the early stages of inflation, behind both non-union wages
and prices, were beginning to catch up.
Of course, those businessmen felt, "Let's stop them
from catching up." This is one of the basic reasons, I
think, why the thing was imposed.
Eventually, if you really try to enforce these controls,
which happily Nixon didn't, you get a form of slavery.
For example, during the American occupation of
Germany after World War 11, we had very severe wage
control. There had been enormous inflation in Germany
during the war, as there was in other countries. For
various reasons, we tried to roll back German prices and
wages to the 1939 level, which meant one-third or
one-fourth. As a result, there was an enormous labor
shortage.

'I don't think any war has been
just for a long, long time,
certainly no twentieth-century
war. 9

The American army of occupation then allocated
German workers to jobs. In other words, if a German
worker was looking for a job, he was forced by American
law to go to the office of the army of occupation, and
they said, "You're going to work in Hamburg in a steel
factory." If the guy said, "No, no. I'd rather work in a
coal mine in Duesseldorf." They'd say, "Nuts to you,
you're working in Hamburg." You essentially had
industrial slavery.
DAILY: What do you think about a movement like
Campaign GM, and movements in general for so-called
corporate responsibility?
ROTHBARD: Let rne put it this way. I think, as Milton
Friedman says, that the only responsibility of a
corporation or a business firm is to make profits. The
more profits you make, the more this is a sign of, one,
being efficient and, two, servicing the consumer in the
manner in which he prefers the most. Any time you
accept "corporate responsibility" at the expense of
profits, this means that you're reducing your benefits to
the rest of society rather than increasing them.
I would make only one qualification to that. A
corporation has the responsibility not to commit torts
against people, in other words, not to damage them, say,
by spraying DDT in their food. That would be part of the
general responsibility of all of us not to injure our
neighbor, not to poison his well. Outside of that, I think
the only responsibility is to make a profit.
DAILY: How about when the search for profit leads to
international cartels or multi-national corporations that
people in other countries find objectionable because
profits flow back to this country. Something like the big
oil companies.
ROTHBARD: Big oil companies are a boon to the
economy of such countries. They are probably the single
thing which helps some of these countries, an example
being the citizens of Kuwait who before oil came into the
picture were penniless nomads starving on the desert and
now have an income per capita much higher than
anywhere else in the world. The point being that the
profits being extracted and sent back to the United States
are much smaller than the investments being made and the
jobs being created.
I am not worried about multi-national enterprises
except to the extent that international cartels are
promoted and encouraged by governments. Government
cartels keep up the price of sugar to almost double or
triple the free market price and the same with the price of
coffee. They create shortages and the like. It is almost
always intergovernmental cartels which are doing this.
DAILY: What do you think about the research of
Professor Gabriel Kolko concerning industry asking for
regulations in order to set up cartels or preserve market
shares?
ROTHBARD: I think it is vitally important research
particularly the book by Kolko called The Triumph of
Conservatism, where Kolko points out how regulations got
started. The period from 1900-1914 was when all the
government agencies and regulatory systems first came in.
The usual high school and college textbook myths say
that these regulatory systems came into being because big
business was being increasingly monopolistic.
The public and the masses and the unions reacted
against this monopolism. They fought against big business
and imposed regulations on big business. That is the usual
story. However, Kolko points out that what happened was
the exact reverse of this. The reverse being that many big
businesses attempted to establish cartels but always failed
because of market competition. Because of the failure to
establish a cartel or monopoly on the free market, the big

businessmen themselves turned to government to regulate
and cartelize industry in the name of fair competition. It
was one of the biggest con games in history.
The ICC for instance, the Interstate Commerce
Commission was put in supposedly to regulate railroads.
They told the public that they were going to lower freight
rates and check monopoly. In fact, they act to raise
freight rates and impose a monopoly. The New Deal,
welfare state, and our regulatory and subsidizing policies
are always put in in the name of helping the poor and the
masses. Actually, they are put in to monopolize and to
subsidize favored groups.
DAILY: What is the libertarian position on marijuana?
ROTHBARD: On marijuana, I am in favor of legalization.
But not because I think it is a good thing or think it is not
harmful. It may very well be harmful. I am not a medical
expert. Even if it is harmful, it should be legalized. People
have a right to their own harm; people have a right to do
anything they want with themselves. If they want to
injure themselves, they should be allowed to do so. If you
say that marijuana is harmful and should therefore be
outlawed you are also taking the position logically that
not eating a certain amount of vitamins per day is
harmful.
I know a gentleman, a distinguished young libertarian,
who lives on nothing but Cokes and hamburgers. His
vitamin intake is virtually zero. He is obviously injurying
himself badly, and his friends often tell him this. The
point is that the logic of outlawing marijuana, or heroin
for that matter, is also the logic of forcing this guy to eat
the right vitamins or preventing him from drinking Coke.
In other words, the logic of a totalitarian: Everybody
stuck in a cage being fed the right amount of vitamins
intravenously.
DAILY: What about abortion?
ROTHBARD: I regard abortion as the mother's right to
eject an unwanted parasite. Obviously a fetus is parasitic.
The fetus lives within the mother. I believe people have
the right to control their own bodies, including what is
within them. Women have the right to reject unwanted
things, fetuses or whatever, within their bodies.
DAILY: I am interested in your ideas on retribution or
what David Harris calls "get back." What kind of code
would you define here? For instance, if Bill were to pull a
gun out of his coat right now and shoot me, what would
my family be entitled to do to Bill?
ROTHBARD: They may be entitled to shoot him. I am
strictly a Mosaic-type person ... an eye for an eye.
There needs to be some kind of proportionality. In
other words, there seems to be an obvious overkill if Bill
steals one of your pen knives or a marble, and you should
shoot him. It seems unjust.

The New Deal, welfare state,
and our regulatory and subsidi
zing policies are always put in
in the name of helping the poor
and the masses. Actually, they
are put in to monopolize and
to subsidize favored groups. 9

I think, for example, if he steals $1000 from you, you
should be able to get it back from him. It is a simple
restitution; you should get $1000 back.
There are three theories of punishment in general. The
first is that you should rehabilitate the criminal. This is
the simple humanitarian argument, which I think is
absolutely vicious. What you do seems very humanitarian,
the purpose of the prison should be rehabilitation. In
practice, the important question is, who decides whether a
criminal is rehabilitated?
A guy could steal an apple and be in jail for the rest of
his life because the varden or the psychiatrist has decided
he isn't rehabilitated yet. All objective punishment goes
by the board, and punishment is in the hands of a Big
Brother totalitarian state apparatus. In the name of
humanitarianism. The second is the deterrence theory,
which is the conservative argument. The deterrence
argument is that we should punish a person so that he or
she won't commit similar crimes. Obviously, he isn't going
to commit a crime if he is in jail. Outside of that
deterrence becomes a very shaky argument for
punishment.
Most people don't like to commit murder; most people
have an inner conscience against committing murders, and
very few people do it. On the other hand, a lot of people
would steal bubble gum or paper clips; or canned peaches.
A lot of people don't have an inner restriction against
that. Therefore, in o. der to deter, you have to have a very
small punishment against murder, say, a $1000 fine, and
death by execution or torture for stealing paper clips, in
order to eliminate the crime of paper clip stealing.
Deterrence would really imply that you would punish
much more severely for light crimes and less severely for
major crimes.
One way to deter mugging is public tortures of
muggers. Every day on Times Square, you could just pick
any guy and pretend that he is a mugger arc! torture him.
It still would effectively deter future muggers, if they
didn't know he was innocent. A deterrence person would
have no argument against this. Thus we get back to the
third — and correct — approach, the retribution theory.
