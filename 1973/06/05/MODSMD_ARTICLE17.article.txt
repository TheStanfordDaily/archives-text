# #Year In Review
## Sept. 1972 To June 1973 
### 
Although this academic year was less eventful than were past years, certain
news stories were particularly noteworthy.
Overseas Campuses Director Robert Walker (top right) announced his
resignation January 2, one day before a special presidential commission
recommended extensive renovation of all aspects of each overseas program.
Later that month, the Faculty Senate voted to close the Vienna campus
effective this July. In April, Assoc. History Prof. Mark Mancall was named to
succeed Walker.
Electrical Engineering Prof. William Shockley (seen at podium above) debated
his controversial theories on the relationship between intelligence and race
before a capacity audience at Memorial Auditorium January 23. Among the
other debaters was Asst. Psychology and Communication Prof. Cedric X (seated
at far right in photo). »
On November 2, several hundred demonstrators, including six faculty
members (I. to r. in photo at right, Charles Stein, Pierre Noyes, Harold Kahn,
Raymond Giraud, Hubert Marshall, and Avram Goldstein) sought to prevent
Honeywell Corp. recruiters from entering the Placement Center. Stanford Public
Safety officers cleared a path for the recruiters, who conducted their interviews
without serious incident.
In January University authorities informed Children's Hospital employee
Julia Harvey (bottom right) that she would be laid off for a lack of funds to
support her job. After Harvey filed a grievance petition over her lay-off, a
transfer of funds was arranged to permit her to remain in her job. She returned
to work on May 21.
On April 14, a set fire consumed the splintered ruins of the Band Shak
(below). LSJUMB members and friends had spent hours that afternoon
demolishing the 75-year-old building. Band officials claimed no knowledge of
the fire's origin.
