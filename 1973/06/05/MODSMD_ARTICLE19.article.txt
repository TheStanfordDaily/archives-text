# D.A.'s Office Attempts Psychiatric File. Probe
## 
### 
In an apparently
unprecedented action, two
investigators from the Santa Clara
County District Attorney's Office,
using a search warrant to gain
entry, attempted to search the
medical record files of the
Stanford University psychiatric
clinic Friday seeking evidence
that might assist them in the
prosecution of an alleged sex
offense case.
The warrant, signed by Judge
Paul R. Teihl in San Jose
Municipal Court, was for the
records and documents relating to
the victim in the case, a
19-year-old youth who was
examined after the alleged attack
last February.
Cassius L. Kirk, University
legal counsel, said there was no
question about the validity of the
request for records, since the
patient had signed a document
waiving the confidentiality of his
medical record.
But Kirk said he was surprised
that a search warrant was issued
when a court order after a hearing
involving both parties would have
done the job.

Two investigators from the
district attorney s office, Anthony
Cvetan and Duane Sands, showed
up at the psychiatric building
about 10 a.m. Friday with the
search warrant.
Peter Carpenter, assistant
vice-president for medical affairs,
met them and surrendered the file
on the youth while telling the
investigators that they could not
go through the psychiatric files
because of the confidentiality of
the names of other patients.
The investigators complied and
did not conduct a full search.
The psychiatrist who examined
the patient and saw him several
times since is Dr. Marguerite
Lederberg, a psychiatric resident
at the School of Medicine. She
was not present when the
investigators appeared at the
clinic.
The warrant authorized an
immediate search of offices, file
rooms, storage areas, closets, and
a library in the clinic, as well as
Lederberg's car and residence at
1431 Pitman Avenue, Palo Alto.
She is the wife of Nobelist Dr.
Joshua Lederberg.
