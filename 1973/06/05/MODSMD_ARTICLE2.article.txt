# Watergate Hearings Will Continue
## Ervin Committee Rejects Cox Bid 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Special
prosecutor Archibald Cox yesterday
asked the Senate Watergate committee
to suspend its televised hearings. But a
majority of the panel said no.
Four of the committee's seven
senators immediately rejected the bid
by Cox, who warned that continuing
the hearings, scheduled to resume at 7
a.m. PDT today, will impede
investigations of the scandal and
increase the risk that guilty parties will
go free.
A three months delay, Cox said,
"seems reasonable but I would be
grateful for any significant period."
Sen. Sam J. Ervin (D-N.C.), said his
committee cannot afford a delay
because it is vital "for the people to
learn the truth."
Presumptuous Request
He was joined by Sen. Herman E.
Talmadge (D-Ga.), who called Cox
presumptuous in making the request.
Sens. Joseph M. Montoya (D-N.M.),
and Lowell P. Weicker Jr. (R-Conn.),
also supported the rejection. Sen.
Howard H. Baker Jr. (R-Tenn.), and
Edward J. Gurney (R-Fla), said they
would announce a position on Cox's
request Tuesday morning.
Sen. Daniel K. Inouye (D-Hawaii),
said he is inclined to support Ervin.
Truth Revealed
"I do not accept the suggestion of
the prosecution that the Senate
investigation will impede the search
for truth," said Ervin, a former North
Carolina supreme court justice. "On
the contrary, the preparation for the
investigation on the part of the
committee has greatly accelerated the
revelation of the truth."
He said a postponement would "for
all practical intentions and purposes
put the committee out of business"
and added: "We cannot afford to
delay while awaiting further
action by the Department of Justice."
Attorney General Elliot Richardson

said he could understand Ervin's
argument that the public must know
all the facts about the Watergate case
even if no one is sent to jail. But the
attorney general said that view could
contribute to further cynicism toward
government.
"The disclosure of wrongdoing
should be followed up by the
prosecution, the indicting and the
conviction of the wrongdoers," said
Richardson.
"Unless the people see this
happening, they will indict all of
Washington. What is on trial here is
confidence in the integrity of the
government."
In another development, The New
York Times reported Tuesday that the
Watergate special prosecution team has
decided to investigate the conduct of
Henry E. Petersen, the assistant
Attorney General who supervised the
Watergate Inquiry for nearly a year.
The Times quoted sources close to
Cox as saying the question is whether
Petersen was involved in the cover-up.
The Times quoted Petersen as
vigorously denying any involvement in
a coverup and saying he "did not
compromise this investigation with
anybody at all."
Nixon Logs
Meanwhile, the White House said it
will not furnish investigators with logs
of conversations that President Nixon
had about the Watergate scandal this
year with ousted counsel John W.
Dean 111.
"The President's logs are not
subject to subpoena," said deputy
press secretary Gerald L. Warren.
Supplying the materials, he said,
would be "constitutionally
inappropriate."
Dean, fired as White House lawyer
April 30, was quoted in published
reports as saying he discussed aspects
of the Watergate coverup with the
President or in Nixon's presence 30-40
times between January and Anril.

The Washington Post, quoting
unnamed sources, said Dean plans to
allege the President was deeply
involved in the coverup.
The White House at first called the
reports "part of a careful coordinated
strategy ... to prosecute a case against
the President in the press using
innuendo, distortion of fact and
outright falsehood."
Yesterday, Warren acknowledged
the President had conferred with Dean
and said the topics included Nixon's
own Watergate investigation,
administration policy on citing
executive privilege and hearings on the
unsuccessful nomination of L. Patrick
Gray to be director of the FBI.
