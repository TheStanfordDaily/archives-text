# CJP Cites Students
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
President Richard Lyman last week approved a
recommended two year probation period for two
students who had stolen about $1000 in
merchandise from the University Stores
Department.
Stanford Public Safety Department officers
captured Lee Christian Spieller and Eric Braun Test,
both juniors in biology from Saratoga, Calif., on
February 12 as they emerged from the Stores
Department with about $400 in illegally
requisitioned goods.
The University Administration charged both with
violation of the Fundamental Standard. Spieller and
Test were also charged by Santa Clara County
authorities with grand theft and conspiracy, both
felonies.
According to Assistant Presidential Counsel
Gerald Halligan, one defendant admitted to the
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP) that he had indeed
obtained requisition forms from the office of
Fraternities Manager Alan Cummings and used them
to obtain merchandise in the name of certain
fraternities. Halligan said the other defendant did
not contest the facts.
After a May hearing, the CJP split 4-2 on the
appropriate penalty for Spieller and Test. The
majority argued that indefinite suspension for up to
two years would be appropriate for this sort of
offense, but added that the criminal sanctions likely
to be imposed upon the two by Santa Clara County
should mitigate in their behalf.
(Spieller pleaded guilty to one count of grand
theft and had three other charges against him
dropped. A Superior Court judge fined him $250
and placed him on summary probation for one year.

After originally pleading not guilty to all three
charges against him, Test agreed to plead guilty to
one reduced charge if the two felony charges against
him were dropped. The county's Adult Probation
Office recommendation on his sentence is due
Friday.)
According to the majority opinion of the CJP,
sanctions in addition to those imposed by the courts
would be justified only if: 1) the offense is
considered more serious within the University than
it is outside it; or 2) if the defendant remains a
danger to others despite the court-imposed
sanctions.
Food Research Institute Prof. Roger Gray,
freshman Charlotte Germane, freshman Henry Heng
Leung and graduate student Roscoe Giles voted
with the majority. Giles took the place of junior
Timothy Brophy, who had disqualified himself
because of his acquaintance with one of the
defendants.
The minority opinion stated that the CJP should
be principally concerned with the welfare of the
University and with safeguarding its interests. The
opinion added that these considerations should
discourage the CJP from weighing criminal sanctions
in its deliberations about University penalties.
The minority (Aerophysics Prof. Daniel
Bershader and Asst. Surgery Prof. William Fair)
favored two quarters of actual suspension for
Spieller and one quarter for Test. They said this
penalty would have an additional deterent effect.
In his response to the CJP majority opinion,
Lyman said it would be "unacceptable" to assume
that the University's interests would always be
served by the application of criminal sanctions to
defendants.
