I have heard of a "hang-around" fee for students who will be in
this area during the summer quarter but not enrolled in classes. This
fee would enable students to use Cowell Health Center, the gym and
other services available to fully enrolled students. Does such a fee
exist, and how does one arrange it? B.F.S.
Information on the summer services permit for students who will
not be registered summer quarter will be available after June 8 in the

More information on the suggested schedule of midterms ....
The School of Humanities and Sciences did begin putting out a
schedule of suggested midterm dates when Philip Rhinelander was
Dean of the School, according to former Dean Robert Sears.
Sears said that the practice just sort of died out, and no one seems
to know the exact date that H&S stopped distributing the schedule.
Albert Hastorf, the present Dean, says that he thinks the idea of a
midterm schedule is a very good one. He said that he would talk to
Dean of Undergraduate Studies James Gibbs about the possibility of
reinstating a schedule for midterms in the departments of the School
of Humanities and Sciences.

A friend of mine was not allowed to take a half-load (units) for
half-tuition even though his doctor recommended it. He had been ill
and was told to only take a half-load. The Registrar's office told him
he could take a half-load (7 or 8 units) only if he paid full tuition.
What is the University's policy on this? If the above is true, the
University seems to be out only for money and seems to be
persecuting someone who has the mishap to become ill. F.R.M.
Undergraduates must pay full tuition whether they take a full unit
load or not, according to Acting Registrar Robert Houghton. The only
exception to this is the undergraduate who has completed 12 full
quarters of university work and needs eight or fewer units to graduate.
This student may take up to eight units for half-tuition, $530.
There are some student officers who are allowed to take eight units
for half-tuition. However, if they take nine or more units they must
pay full tuition.
The ASSU Council of Presidents, the Student Financial Manager,
the President of the ASSU Senate, the editor of the Stanford Daily
and the editor of the Stanford Quad are all permitted to take eight
units for half-tuition.
Graduate students have the option of paying full tuition for a full
load or taking up to eight units for half-tuition, except in the School
of Engineering, Physics, Math, Computer Science and Statistics. These
departments do not offer trfe half-load, half-tuition option to their
graduate students.
All Resident Associates and Teaching Assistants are allowed to take
from three to ten units for less than full tuition. The cost is $230 for
three units and $60 for every unit after that, up to ten units.
Spouses of full-time Stanford faculty members and administrators
are allowed the same option as RAs and TAs.

Is there a flying club at Stanford? If so, how do I contact them? If
not, what do you suggest as the cheapest way for a Stanford student
to take flying lessons and get a pilot's license? S.D.
There is a flying club at Stanford. Call William Cuendt at 321-7152
or 968-1571 for information.
Tips from an Avid Aviator, John Axtell: the Stanford flying club
flies out of San Carlos, which is about ten miles from here. There are
good flying clubs that fly right out of Palo Alto. There are also some
really excellent groups that fly out of Hayward. Check the classified
ads in the Palo Alto Times and the San Francisco Chronicle under
"Aircraft" or "Aviation" — if you keep looking you are sure to find
ads for the different clubs.

The School of Humanities and Sciences did begin putting out a
schedule of suggested midterm dates when Philip Rhinelander was
Dean of the School, according to former Dean Robert Sears.
Sears said that the practice just sort of died out, and no one seems
to know the exact date that H&S stopped distributing the schedule.
Albert Hastorf, the present Dean, says that he thinks the idea of a
midterm schedule is a very good one. He said that he would talk to
Dean of Undergraduate Studies James Gibbs about the possibility of
reinstating a schedule for midterms in the departments of the School
of Humanities and Sciences.

A friend of mine was not allowed to take a half-load (units) for
half-tuition even though his doctor recommended it. He had been ill
and was told to only take a half-load. The Registrar's office told him
he could take a half-load (7 or 8 units) only if he paid full tuition.
What is the University's policy on this? If the above is true, the
University seems to be out only for money and seems to be
persecuting someone who has the mishap to become ill. F.R.M.
Undergraduates must pay full tuition whether they take a full unit
load or not, according to Acting Registrar Robert Houghton. The only
exception to this is the undergraduate who has completed 12 full
quarters of university work and needs eight or fewer units to graduate.
This student may take up to eight units for half-tuition, $530.
There are some student officers who are allowed to take eight units
for half-tuition. However, if they take nine or more units they must
pay full tuition.
The ASSU Council of Presidents, the Student Financial Manager,
the President of the ASSU Senate, the editor of the Stanford Daily
and the editor of the Stanford Quad are all permitted to take eight
units for half-tuition.
Graduate students have the option of paying full tuition for a full
load or taking up to eight units for half-tuition, except in the School
of Engineering, Physics, Math, Computer Science and Statistics. These
departments do not offer trfe half-load, half-tuition option to their
graduate students.
All Resident Associates and Teaching Assistants are allowed to take
from three to ten units for less than full tuition. The cost is $230 for
three units and $60 for every unit after that, up to ten units.
Spouses of full-time Stanford faculty members and administrators
are allowed the same option as RAs and TAs.

Is there a flying club at Stanford? If so, how do I contact them? If
not, what do you suggest as the cheapest way for a Stanford student
to take flying lessons and get a pilot's license? S.D.
There is a flying club at Stanford. Call William Cuendt at 321-7152
or 968-1571 for information.
Tips from an Avid Aviator, John Axtell: the Stanford flying club
flies out of San Carlos, which is about ten miles from here. There are
good flying clubs that fly right out of Palo Alto. There are also some
really excellent groups that fly out of Hayward. Check the classified
ads in the Palo Alto Times and the San Francisco Chronicle under
"Aircraft" or "Aviation" — if you keep looking you are sure to find
ads for the different clubs.

What is the total number of red tiles currently in place on the tops
of campus buildings? K.L.
Bug needs help on this one. The first person to call in with the
correct answer will receive a free abacus and will have their name
appear in a Bug Me column next fall.

I have heard of a "hang-around" fee for students who will be in
this area during the summer quarter but not enrolled in classes. This
fee would enable students to use Cowell Health Center, the gym and
other services available to fully enrolled students. Does such a fee
exist, and how does one arrange it? B.F.S.
Information on the summer services permit for students who will
not be registered summer quarter will be available after June 8 in the
Housing Office, Old Union, extension 3047.
