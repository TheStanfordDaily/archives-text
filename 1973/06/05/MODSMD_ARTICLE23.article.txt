# 54 Years Of Stanford-ROTC Ties End Next Week
## 
### 
More than a half century's
association between Stanford and
the Reserve Officers Training
Corps will come to a close June
16, when 14 undergraduates
receive their armed forces
commissions.
More than 2,000 Army, Navy,
Air Force and Marine officers
have been commissioned at the
University, including several
Rhodes scholars and Danforth
fellows, and hundreds who
completed advanced graduate
work.
The ROTC commissioning will
be held at Moffett Field Naval Air
Station, where they have been
scheduled since the ceremonies
became a focal point for anti-war
protests in the late 19605.
Provost William F. Miller will
speak on behalf of the University,
with Major General James J.
Gibbons, deputy commander of
the Sixth Army (Presidio) and
Rear Admiral C.J. Van Arsdale
Jr., commandant of the 12th
Naval District welcoming seven
Navy ensigns, two Marine and five
Army lieutenants.
Ten Navy ROTC
undergraduates, who already have
completed all their Navy
requirements, will remain at
Stanford but will be administered
through the UC-Berkeley Navy
ROTC unit. This group already
was enrolled in Navy ROTC as
freshmen when it was ordered
phased out.
The Army has commissioned
1,063 men at Stanford since
coming to campus in 1919, when
post World War I cadets trained
with horse-drawn artillery.
Navy and Marine ROTC have
been on campus since 1946,
commissioning 1,019 officers in

that time.
As the Vietnam war escalated,
ROTC enrollment at Stanford
dropped sharply. Where 586 were
enrolled in 1963-64, 346 were
enrolled in the fall of 1968 and
only 250 the following year. Low
enrollments were cited by the Air
Force in its decision to withdraw
from the University two years
ago.
In February 1969 the Faculty
Senate voted 25-8 to end
academic credit for ROTC courses
taken by students entering in
Autumn 1970 or thereafter. This
position was later upheld in a
403-356 vote of the Academic
Council later that year.
The spring of 1970 saw
considerable activism by the
so-called "Off-ROTC Movement."
Police arrested 24 students who
had occupied the Old Union for
12 hours on April 23. Six days

later, police arrested 10 students
after a sit-in of equal duration.
Extensive trashing of campus
buildings occurred on both
evenings after the Old Union was
cleared. Window-breaking reached
an unprecedented level on the
night of April 30, after American
troops invaded Cambodia.
During a week-long student
strike which effectively shut down
the University for the first time in
its history, the Faculty Senate
voted on May 7, 1970 to
terminate all academic credit for
ROTC effective August 31 of that
year.
Efforts to work out a
compromise program faltered and
on June 4, 1970, a few days after
the Cambodian invasion, the
Senate voted 26-8 with three
abstentions, to bar future
enrollment of new students.
At the same time, the Senate

expressed its support for
off-campus officer training
programs (such as those offered
Marine platoon leaders), where
students can receive military
training concurrently with regular
academic instruction.
(At a Faculty Senate meeting
Thursday, May 31, it Wtjs reported
that 150 studmts had signed a
petition asking «he University to
reopen negotiations witn the
Department of Defense along
these lines.
Stanford was one of the 17
colleges and universities to sever
ties with ROTC. Others included
Harvard, Yale, Cornell, Penn, and

Pomona. Princeton recently voted
to reinstate Army ROTC.
"Stanford was the only
institution west of Philadelphia
and the only one of the Pacific
Eight Conference to do so," with
Navy ROTC, according to Major
Henry Stackpole, USMC,
commander of the Navy-Marine
Corps unit at Stanford. "But the
Navy may possibly reduce others
anyway, due to budgetary
considerations."
"The quarrel at Stanford," he
recalls, "was mainly over the
academic status of the ROTC
programs and military instructors.
The Army was more flexible

about it than we were," agreeing
at one point to submit courses for
faculty approval for academic
credit.
"100 students per year will be
hurt financially by the phase-out.
You have to remember that these
young men had to be admitted to
Stanford before they could get
into ROTC — so that we're losing
talented students who otherwise
couldn't have gone here without
ROTC scholarship support."
Asensio feels the same way. "I
hate to see such a combination of
opportunities for Stanford
students disappear," he said. "The
ROTC students were eligible for

four, three, two or one year
post-graduate scholarships with
active duty commitments often
delayed to permit immediate
graduate study."
"We wanted purely military
courses .taught by the military,"
he said, "but we encouraged
students to select appropriate
Stanford courses for certain
ROTC requirements.
When the military units are
officially dissolved June 30,
Stackpole will report to Okinawa
to work with a Marine infantry
unit. Asendo has been assigned to
the staff and faculty of the School
of The Americas in Panama.
