# Hall To Remain Here In Ombudsman's Job
## 
### 
Harvey Hall will continue
another year as University
ombudsman, President Richard
Lyman announced last week.
Hall, for 22 years the
University's registrar, was
appointed last year to serve as
ombudsman during his last official
tour of duty prior to retirement.
"I'm very pleased that Dr. Hall
is willing to postpone his
retirement to serve another year
in the important post of
University ombudsman," said
Lyman.
"He has been consistently
constructive and judicious, and
we're fortunate to be able to

count on him during the coming
year."
At commencement exercises
last June, Hall received a special
Dinkelspiel Award for
"open-mindedness, fair judgment
and willingness to consider the
individual case" as registrar.
The ombudsman's office will
be closed from Monday, June 18,
through summer quarter. It will
reopen Fall Quarter registration
day, September 24.
Problems normally handled by
the ombudsman can be referred to
the Dean of Student Affairs
Office during the vacation period.
