Astronauts To Repair Skylab
SPACE CENTER, Houston - Two Skylab I
astronauts will crawl outside their spacecraft and
attempt repair of a broken solar power panel to
boost the electricity available to their power-starved
space station, officials said yesterday.
The space walking salvage job probably will come
Thursday morning, said William C. Schneider,
director of the Skylab program.
Schneider said the repair job must work if Skylab
is to complete all of its experiments. He warned,
however, "We've got a good chance, but it's not
100 percent... We have a lot of things that have to
happen, so don't expect instant success."
Skylab I astronauts Charles Conrad Jr., Dr.
Joseph P. Kerwin and Paul J. Weitz were to receive
instructions on how to attempt the salvage job and
then practice it tomorrow inside the spaceship. If
preparations are completed on schedule, said
Schneider, the repair attempt probably will come on
Thursday.
Yesterday on their 11th day of a scheduled
28-day mission, the astronauts performed earth
resources studies and medical experiments from
Skylab orbiting 270 miles over the earth.
Data gathered over the United States will be used
to map major geological features and to study cloud
structures. Data gathered over the Atlantic will be
used for ecological studies and to possibly locate
submerged deposits of sand and gravel.
Nixon Resignation Demanded
STATELINE, NEV. - Gov. Patrick J. Lucey of
Wisconsin called on President Nixon to resign
because of Watergate. But his Democratic colleagues
at the National Governors' Conference adjourned a
closed door caucus without tabling any action to
press Watergate as a tool in their growing struggle
with the President over state-federal issues.
While Lucey's call for Nixon's resignation was
generally overlooked by Democrats and vigorously
rejected by Republicans, there was broad support
for his contention that Watergate has crippled the
President's ability to lead the country.
"The government is in a paralysis which may go
on for months," Gov. John J. Gilligan of Ohio said
in a corridor news conference after his own
Watergate proposal had died at the caucus.
Gilligan and other governors said Watergate has
made it impossible to get action or answers from
Washington on the budgetary pr >blems facing the
states over Nixon's impoundment of funds and his
proposed budget cuts.
"The question is, does the President expect the
American people to believe that he had no
knowledge of what his top executive assistants were
doing," Gilligan said. "Does he expect the American
people to believe that he had no knowledge of what
his handpicked campaign directors were doing?
"Either the President knew and was responsible
for the activities of his campaign, or he did not.
That is the question he should answer," Gilliglan
said.
Gilligan said his proposal had "substantial

support but not enough to get anything out on the
floor" of the full conference. He said he withdrew it
without a vote.
Many governors expressed a desire to turn away
from Watergate to more immediate state problems.
Renewed Vietnam Fighting
SAIGON — Communist-led troops attacked a
government position in the Mekong Delta, touching
off one of the fiercest battles in South Vietnam
since the cease-fire was proclaimed more than four
months ago, the Saigon command reported today.
In a series of running fire fights in rice paddies
about 40 miles southwest of Saigon, more than 100
North Vietnamese and Viet Cong troops were killed,
a government communique said.
It gave government casualties in the two-day
battle as 25 killed and more than 50 wounded.
In South Vietnamese politics, former President
Duong Van "Big" Minh proposed yesterday doing
away with all laws oppressive to non-Communist
opponents of the Saigon government. He also called
for the immediate release of all political prisoners.
The government, in reaction to Minh's political
statement, said he was bieng used by persons around
him. He is a middle-roader who was one of the
leaders of the coup that ended in the killing of
President Ngo Dinh Diem in 1963.
Minh said the people of South Vietnam are
setting their hopes on secret talks between Henry A.
Kissinger and Hanoi's Le Due Tho in Paris this
week.
But, he said, a realistic peace depends on the
good will of the opposing parties in South Vietnam
— the Viet Cong and the Saigon government of
President Nguyen Van Thieu.
Ex-POW Commits Suicide
HARRISON, N.Y. — Four months ago Air Force
Capt. Edward Alan Brudno came home to his wife
and family after years in a North Vietnamese prison
camp, exclaiming joyously over "the excitement of
being reborn."
But yesterday, his 33rd birthday, he lay dead,
leaving behind a two-line note in French that,
broadly translated, means: "There is no sense in
living any longer; my life is no longer worth living."
Striving for an explanation for the abrupt
about-face in Brudno's outlook toward life, a
neighbor said:
"He looked like a regular guy. I saw him about
the house and he looked okay."
But apparently there had been warning signs.
Like other POWs, he had been under psychiatric
treatment since his return.
And police quoted his mother-in-law, Bernice
Gitenstein, as saying Brudno had been depressed
and "contemplating suicide for some time."
Brudno was staying with Henry Gitenstein and
his wife in their home here, and it was in his
bedroom that his body was found Sunday. He went
to bed about 10 p.m. Saturday.
A tan plastic garbage bag was drawn over his
head, the string anchored in his hand.

Ellsberg Burglary Hearing Opens
LOS ANGELES — Daniel Ellsberg met with Los
Angeles County Dist. Atty. Joseph Busch yesterday,
and three Watergate conspirators were brought to
Los Angeles. All were prepared to testify at a grand
jury probe into the burglary of the office of
Ellsberg's psychiatrist.
Secret hearings open here today and are
scheduled to continue at least through Friday.
Busch's spokesman said he is still negotiating
with several former White House officials, seeking to
have them testify voluntarily about the planning of
the Watergate-style break-in.
"They are still on our list, and we hope they will
testify," the spokesman said of witnesses including
former presidential adviser John D. Ehrlichman,
former presidential counsel Charles W. Colson and
former White House aides Egil Krogh and David
Young.
Watergate principals E. Howard Hunt, Bernard
Barker and Eugenio Martinez were flown here from
the Federal Correctional Institution at Danbury,
Conn., on Sunday night. They have been granted
immunity from prosecution for their roles in the
break-in at the Beverly Hills office of Dr. Lewis
Fielding.
The break-in Sept. 3,1971, was revealed in April
during the Pentagon Papers trial of Ellsberg and
Anthony Russo.
U.S. District Court Judge Matt Byrne conducted
his own brief investigation into the matter and cited
the break-in as one of a series of incidents of
governmental misconduct which led him to dismiss
all charges on May 11.
Court To Hear 'Cursing' Suit
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court today agreed
to hear arguments on the legality of ordinances
prohibiting the use of abusive language against
policemen.
The issue reaches the court in a suit arising from
the 1970 conviction of a black woman in New
Orleans for reviling police and resisting arrest.
Mrs. Mallie Lewis appealed the conviction and
$10 fine on grounds the ordinance was vaguely
worded and violated her First and 14th Amendment
rights.
She was convicted April 17, 1970 in city court
for allegedly interfering with and cursing officers
who arrested her son.
She maintains that she only attempted to follow
the police car that was taking her son to jail.
The conviction was later upheld by the Louisiana
Supreme Court, but in 1972 the Supreme Court
ordered the state courts to rehear the case. Again
the conviction was upheld.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow, but with low clouds along
the coast extending inland late night and morning
increasing somewhat tonight. Lows tonight in the
50s. Highs both days near 60 along the coast and
into the 70s inland. Light variable winds becoming
mostly westerly 10 to 20 mph afternoons.

the police car that was taking her son to jail.
The conviction was later upheld by the Louisiana
Supreme Court, but in 1972 the Supreme Court
ordered the state courts to rehear the case. Again
the conviction was upheld.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow, but with low clouds along
the coast extending inland late night and morning
increasing somewhat tonight. Lows tonight in the
50s. Highs both days near 60 along the coast and

mostly westerly 10 to 20 mph afternoons.
Astronauts To Repair Skylab
SPACE CENTER, Houston - Two Skylab I
astronauts will crawl outside their spacecraft and
attempt repair of a broken solar power panel to
boost the electricity available to their power-starved
space station, officials said yesterday.
The space walking salvage job probably will come
Thursday morning, said William C. Schneider,
director of the Skylab program.
Schneider said the repair job must work if Skylab
is to complete all of its experiments. He warned,
however, "We've got a good chance, but it's not
100 percent... We have a lot of things that have to
happen, so don't expect instant success."
Skylab I astronauts Charles Conrad Jr., Dr.
Joseph P. Kerwin and Paul J. Weitz were to receive
instructions on how to attempt the salvage job and
then practice it tomorrow inside the spaceship. If
preparations are completed on schedule, said
Schneider, the repair attempt probably will come on
Thursday.
Yesterday on their 11th day of a scheduled
28-day mission, the astronauts performed earth
resources studies and medical experiments from
Skylab orbiting 270 miles over the earth.
Data gathered over the United States will be used
to map major geological features and to study cloud
structures. Data gathered over the Atlantic will be
used for ecological studies and to possibly locate
submerged deposits of sand and gravel.
Nixon Resignation Demanded
STATELINE, NEV. - Gov. Patrick J. Lucey of
Wisconsin called on President Nixon to resign
because of Watergate. But his Democratic colleagues
at the National Governors' Conference adjourned a
closed door caucus without tabling any action to
press Watergate as a tool in their growing struggle
with the President over state-federal issues.
While Lucey's call for Nixon's resignation was
generally overlooked by Democrats and vigorously
rejected by Republicans, there was broad support
for his contention that Watergate has crippled the
President's ability to lead the country.
"The government is in a paralysis which may go
on for months," Gov. John J. Gilligan of Ohio said
in a corridor news conference after his own
Watergate proposal had died at the caucus.
Gilligan and other governors said Watergate has
made it impossible to get action or answers from
Washington on the budgetary pr >blems facing the
states over Nixon's impoundment of funds and his
proposed budget cuts.
"The question is, does the President expect the
American people to believe that he had no
knowledge of what his top executive assistants were
doing," Gilligan said. "Does he expect the American
people to believe that he had no knowledge of what
his handpicked campaign directors were doing?
"Either the President knew and was responsible
for the activities of his campaign, or he did not.
That is the question he should answer," Gilliglan
said.
Gilligan said his proposal had "substantial

support but not enough to get anything out on the
floor" of the full conference. He said he withdrew it
without a vote.
Many governors expressed a desire to turn away
from Watergate to more immediate state problems.
Renewed Vietnam Fighting
SAIGON — Communist-led troops attacked a
government position in the Mekong Delta, touching
off one of the fiercest battles in South Vietnam
since the cease-fire was proclaimed more than four
months ago, the Saigon command reported today.
In a series of running fire fights in rice paddies
about 40 miles southwest of Saigon, more than 100
North Vietnamese and Viet Cong troops were killed,
a government communique said.
It gave government casualties in the two-day
battle as 25 killed and more than 50 wounded.
In South Vietnamese politics, former President
Duong Van "Big" Minh proposed yesterday doing
away with all laws oppressive to non-Communist
opponents of the Saigon government. He also called
for the immediate release of all political prisoners.
The government, in reaction to Minh's political
statement, said he was bieng used by persons around
him. He is a middle-roader who was one of the
leaders of the coup that ended in the killing of
President Ngo Dinh Diem in 1963.
Minh said the people of South Vietnam are
setting their hopes on secret talks between Henry A.
Kissinger and Hanoi's Le Due Tho in Paris this
week.
But, he said, a realistic peace depends on the
good will of the opposing parties in South Vietnam
— the Viet Cong and the Saigon government of
President Nguyen Van Thieu.
Ex-POW Commits Suicide
HARRISON, N.Y. — Four months ago Air Force
Capt. Edward Alan Brudno came home to his wife
and family after years in a North Vietnamese prison
camp, exclaiming joyously over "the excitement of
being reborn."
But yesterday, his 33rd birthday, he lay dead,
leaving behind a two-line note in French that,
broadly translated, means: "There is no sense in
living any longer; my life is no longer worth living."
Striving for an explanation for the abrupt
about-face in Brudno's outlook toward life, a
neighbor said:
"He looked like a regular guy. I saw him about
the house and he looked okay."
But apparently there had been warning signs.
Like other POWs, he had been under psychiatric
treatment since his return.
And police quoted his mother-in-law, Bernice
Gitenstein, as saying Brudno had been depressed
and "contemplating suicide for some time."
Brudno was staying with Henry Gitenstein and
his wife in their home here, and it was in his
bedroom that his body was found Sunday. He went
to bed about 10 p.m. Saturday.
A tan plastic garbage bag was drawn over his
head, the string anchored in his hand.

Ellsberg Burglary Hearing Opens
LOS ANGELES — Daniel Ellsberg met with Los
Angeles County Dist. Atty. Joseph Busch yesterday,
and three Watergate conspirators were brought to
Los Angeles. All were prepared to testify at a grand
jury probe into the burglary of the office of
Ellsberg's psychiatrist.
Secret hearings open here today and are
scheduled to continue at least through Friday.
Busch's spokesman said he is still negotiating
with several former White House officials, seeking to
have them testify voluntarily about the planning of
the Watergate-style break-in.
"They are still on our list, and we hope they will
testify," the spokesman said of witnesses including
former presidential adviser John D. Ehrlichman,
former presidential counsel Charles W. Colson and
former White House aides Egil Krogh and David
Young.
Watergate principals E. Howard Hunt, Bernard
Barker and Eugenio Martinez were flown here from
the Federal Correctional Institution at Danbury,
Conn., on Sunday night. They have been granted
immunity from prosecution for their roles in the
break-in at the Beverly Hills office of Dr. Lewis
Fielding.
The break-in Sept. 3,1971, was revealed in April
during the Pentagon Papers trial of Ellsberg and
Anthony Russo.
U.S. District Court Judge Matt Byrne conducted
his own brief investigation into the matter and cited
the break-in as one of a series of incidents of
governmental misconduct which led him to dismiss
all charges on May 11.
Court To Hear 'Cursing' Suit
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court today agreed
to hear arguments on the legality of ordinances
prohibiting the use of abusive language against
policemen.
The issue reaches the court in a suit arising from
the 1970 conviction of a black woman in New
Orleans for reviling police and resisting arrest.
Mrs. Mallie Lewis appealed the conviction and
$10 fine on grounds the ordinance was vaguely
worded and violated her First and 14th Amendment
rights.
She was convicted April 17, 1970 in city court
for allegedly interfering with and cursing officers
who arrested her son.
She maintains that she only attempted to follow
the police car that was taking her son to jail.
The conviction was later upheld by the Louisiana
Supreme Court, but in 1972 the Supreme Court
ordered the state courts to rehear the case. Again

to hear arguments on the legality of ordinances
prohibiting the use of abusive language against
policemen.
The issue reaches the court in a suit arising from
the 1970 conviction of a black woman in New
Orleans for reviling police and resisting arrest.
Mrs. Mallie Lewis appealed the conviction and
$10 fine on grounds the ordinance was vaguely
worded and violated her First and 14th Amendment
rights.
She was convicted April 17, 1970 in city court
for allegedly interfering with and cursing officers
who arrested her son.
She maintains that she only attempted to follow
the police car that was taking her son to jail.
The conviction was later upheld by the Louisiana
Supreme Court, but in 1972 the Supreme Court
ordered the state courts to rehear the case. Again
the conviction was upheld.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow, but with low clouds along
the coast extending inland late night and morning
increasing somewhat tonight. Lows tonight in the
50s. Highs both days near 60 along the coast and
into the 70s inland. Light variable winds becoming
mostly westerly 10 to 20 mph afternoons.
Astronauts To Repair Skylab
SPACE CENTER, Houston - Two Skylab I
astronauts will crawl outside their spacecraft and
attempt repair of a broken solar power panel to
boost the electricity available to their power-starved
space station, officials said yesterday.
The space walking salvage job probably will come
Thursday morning, said William C. Schneider,
director of the Skylab program.
Schneider said the repair job must work if Skylab
is to complete all of its experiments. He warned,
however, "We've got a good chance, but it's not
100 percent... We have a lot of things that have to
happen, so don't expect instant success."
Skylab I astronauts Charles Conrad Jr., Dr.
Joseph P. Kerwin and Paul J. Weitz were to receive
instructions on how to attempt the salvage job and
then practice it tomorrow inside the spaceship. If
preparations are completed on schedule, said
Schneider, the repair attempt probably will come on
Thursday.
Yesterday on their 11th day of a scheduled
28-day mission, the astronauts performed earth
resources studies and medical experiments from
Skylab orbiting 270 miles over the earth.
Data gathered over the United States will be used
to map major geological features and to study cloud
structures. Data gathered over the Atlantic will be
used for ecological studies and to possibly locate
submerged deposits of sand and gravel.
Nixon Resignation Demanded
STATELINE, NEV. - Gov. Patrick J. Lucey of
Wisconsin called on President Nixon to resign
because of Watergate. But his Democratic colleagues
at the National Governors' Conference adjourned a
closed door caucus without tabling any action to
press Watergate as a tool in their growing struggle
with the President over state-federal issues.
While Lucey's call for Nixon's resignation was
generally overlooked by Democrats and vigorously
rejected by Republicans, there was broad support
for his contention that Watergate has crippled the
President's ability to lead the country.
"The government is in a paralysis which may go
on for months," Gov. John J. Gilligan of Ohio said
in a corridor news conference after his own
Watergate proposal had died at the caucus.
Gilligan and other governors said Watergate has
made it impossible to get action or answers from
Washington on the budgetary pr >blems facing the
states over Nixon's impoundment of funds and his
proposed budget cuts.
"The question is, does the President expect the
American people to believe that he had no
knowledge of what his top executive assistants were
doing," Gilligan said. "Does he expect the American
people to believe that he had no knowledge of what
his handpicked campaign directors were doing?
"Either the President knew and was responsible
for the activities of his campaign, or he did not.
That is the question he should answer," Gilliglan
said.
Gilligan said his proposal had "substantial

support but not enough to get anything out on the
floor" of the full conference. He said he withdrew it
without a vote.
Many governors expressed a desire to turn away
from Watergate to more immediate state problems.
Renewed Vietnam Fighting
SAIGON — Communist-led troops attacked a
government position in the Mekong Delta, touching
off one of the fiercest battles in South Vietnam
since the cease-fire was proclaimed more than four
months ago, the Saigon command reported today.
In a series of running fire fights in rice paddies
about 40 miles southwest of Saigon, more than 100
North Vietnamese and Viet Cong troops were killed,
a government communique said.
It gave government casualties in the two-day
battle as 25 killed and more than 50 wounded.
In South Vietnamese politics, former President
Duong Van "Big" Minh proposed yesterday doing
away with all laws oppressive to non-Communist
opponents of the Saigon government. He also called
for the immediate release of all political prisoners.
The government, in reaction to Minh's political
statement, said he was bieng used by persons around
him. He is a middle-roader who was one of the
leaders of the coup that ended in the killing of
President Ngo Dinh Diem in 1963.
Minh said the people of South Vietnam are
setting their hopes on secret talks between Henry A.
Kissinger and Hanoi's Le Due Tho in Paris this
week.
But, he said, a realistic peace depends on the
good will of the opposing parties in South Vietnam
— the Viet Cong and the Saigon government of
President Nguyen Van Thieu.
Ex-POW Commits Suicide
HARRISON, N.Y. — Four months ago Air Force
Capt. Edward Alan Brudno came home to his wife
and family after years in a North Vietnamese prison
camp, exclaiming joyously over "the excitement of
being reborn."
But yesterday, his 33rd birthday, he lay dead,
leaving behind a two-line note in French that,
broadly translated, means: "There is no sense in
living any longer; my life is no longer worth living."
Striving for an explanation for the abrupt
about-face in Brudno's outlook toward life, a
neighbor said:
"He looked like a regular guy. I saw him about
the house and he looked okay."
But apparently there had been warning signs.
Like other POWs, he had been under psychiatric
treatment since his return.
And police quoted his mother-in-law, Bernice
Gitenstein, as saying Brudno had been depressed
and "contemplating suicide for some time."
Brudno was staying with Henry Gitenstein and
his wife in their home here, and it was in his
bedroom that his body was found Sunday. He went
to bed about 10 p.m. Saturday.
A tan plastic garbage bag was drawn over his
head, the string anchored in his hand.

Ellsberg Burglary Hearing Opens
LOS ANGELES — Daniel Ellsberg met with Los
Angeles County Dist. Atty. Joseph Busch yesterday,
and three Watergate conspirators were brought to
Los Angeles. All were prepared to testify at a grand
jury probe into the burglary of the office of
Ellsberg's psychiatrist.
Secret hearings open here today and are
scheduled to continue at least through Friday.
Busch's spokesman said he is still negotiating
with several former White House officials, seeking to
have them testify voluntarily about the planning of
the Watergate-style break-in.
"They are still on our list, and we hope they will
testify," the spokesman said of witnesses including
former presidential adviser John D. Ehrlichman,
former presidential counsel Charles W. Colson and
former White House aides Egil Krogh and David
Young.
Watergate principals E. Howard Hunt, Bernard
Barker and Eugenio Martinez were flown here from
the Federal Correctional Institution at Danbury,
Conn., on Sunday night. They have been granted
immunity from prosecution for their roles in the
break-in at the Beverly Hills office of Dr. Lewis
Fielding.
The break-in Sept. 3,1971, was revealed in April
during the Pentagon Papers trial of Ellsberg and
Anthony Russo.
U.S. District Court Judge Matt Byrne conducted
his own brief investigation into the matter and cited
the break-in as one of a series of incidents of
governmental misconduct which led him to dismiss
all charges on May 11.

Conn., on Sunday night. They have been granted
immunity from prosecution for their roles in the
break-in at the Beverly Hills office of Dr. Lewis
Fielding.
The break-in Sept. 3,1971, was revealed in April
during the Pentagon Papers trial of Ellsberg and
Anthony Russo.
U.S. District Court Judge Matt Byrne conducted
his own brief investigation into the matter and cited
the break-in as one of a series of incidents of
governmental misconduct which led him to dismiss
all charges on May 11.
Court To Hear 'Cursing' Suit
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court today agreed
to hear arguments on the legality of ordinances
prohibiting the use of abusive language against
policemen.
The issue reaches the court in a suit arising from
the 1970 conviction of a black woman in New
Orleans for reviling police and resisting arrest.
Mrs. Mallie Lewis appealed the conviction and
$10 fine on grounds the ordinance was vaguely
worded and violated her First and 14th Amendment
rights.
She was convicted April 17, 1970 in city court
for allegedly interfering with and cursing officers
who arrested her son.
She maintains that she only attempted to follow
the police car that was taking her son to jail.
The conviction was later upheld by the Louisiana
Supreme Court, but in 1972 the Supreme Court
ordered the state courts to rehear the case. Again
the conviction was upheld.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow, but with low clouds along
the coast extending inland late night and morning
increasing somewhat tonight. Lows tonight in the
50s. Highs both days near 60 along the coast and
into the 70s inland. Light variable winds becoming
mostly westerly 10 to 20 mph afternoons.
Astronauts To Repair Skylab
SPACE CENTER, Houston - Two Skylab I
astronauts will crawl outside their spacecraft and
attempt repair of a broken solar power panel to
boost the electricity available to their power-starved
space station, officials said yesterday.
The space walking salvage job probably will come
Thursday morning, said William C. Schneider,
director of the Skylab program.
Schneider said the repair job must work if Skylab
is to complete all of its experiments. He warned,
however, "We've got a good chance, but it's not
100 percent... We have a lot of things that have to
happen, so don't expect instant success."
Skylab I astronauts Charles Conrad Jr., Dr.
Joseph P. Kerwin and Paul J. Weitz were to receive
instructions on how to attempt the salvage job and
then practice it tomorrow inside the spaceship. If
preparations are completed on schedule, said
Schneider, the repair attempt probably will come on
Thursday.
Yesterday on their 11th day of a scheduled
28-day mission, the astronauts performed earth
resources studies and medical experiments from
Skylab orbiting 270 miles over the earth.
Data gathered over the United States will be used
to map major geological features and to study cloud
structures. Data gathered over the Atlantic will be
used for ecological studies and to possibly locate
submerged deposits of sand and gravel.
Nixon Resignation Demanded
STATELINE, NEV. - Gov. Patrick J. Lucey of
Wisconsin called on President Nixon to resign
because of Watergate. But his Democratic colleagues
at the National Governors' Conference adjourned a
closed door caucus without tabling any action to
press Watergate as a tool in their growing struggle
with the President over state-federal issues.
While Lucey's call for Nixon's resignation was
generally overlooked by Democrats and vigorously
rejected by Republicans, there was broad support
for his contention that Watergate has crippled the
President's ability to lead the country.
"The government is in a paralysis which may go
on for months," Gov. John J. Gilligan of Ohio said
in a corridor news conference after his own
Watergate proposal had died at the caucus.
Gilligan and other governors said Watergate has
made it impossible to get action or answers from
Washington on the budgetary pr >blems facing the
states over Nixon's impoundment of funds and his
proposed budget cuts.
"The question is, does the President expect the
American people to believe that he had no
knowledge of what his top executive assistants were
doing," Gilligan said. "Does he expect the American
people to believe that he had no knowledge of what
his handpicked campaign directors were doing?
"Either the President knew and was responsible
for the activities of his campaign, or he did not.
That is the question he should answer," Gilliglan
said.
Gilligan said his proposal had "substantial

support but not enough to get anything out on the
floor" of the full conference. He said he withdrew it
without a vote.
Many governors expressed a desire to turn away
from Watergate to more immediate state problems.
Renewed Vietnam Fighting
SAIGON — Communist-led troops attacked a
government position in the Mekong Delta, touching
off one of the fiercest battles in South Vietnam
since the cease-fire was proclaimed more than four
months ago, the Saigon command reported today.
In a series of running fire fights in rice paddies
about 40 miles southwest of Saigon, more than 100
North Vietnamese and Viet Cong troops were killed,
a government communique said.
It gave government casualties in the two-day
battle as 25 killed and more than 50 wounded.
In South Vietnamese politics, former President
Duong Van "Big" Minh proposed yesterday doing
away with all laws oppressive to non-Communist
opponents of the Saigon government. He also called
for the immediate release of all political prisoners.
The government, in reaction to Minh's political
statement, said he was bieng used by persons around
him. He is a middle-roader who was one of the
leaders of the coup that ended in the killing of
President Ngo Dinh Diem in 1963.
Minh said the people of South Vietnam are
setting their hopes on secret talks between Henry A.
Kissinger and Hanoi's Le Due Tho in Paris this
week.
But, he said, a realistic peace depends on the
good will of the opposing parties in South Vietnam
— the Viet Cong and the Saigon government of
President Nguyen Van Thieu.
Ex-POW Commits Suicide
HARRISON, N.Y. — Four months ago Air Force
Capt. Edward Alan Brudno came home to his wife
and family after years in a North Vietnamese prison
camp, exclaiming joyously over "the excitement of
being reborn."
But yesterday, his 33rd birthday, he lay dead,
leaving behind a two-line note in French that,
broadly translated, means: "There is no sense in
living any longer; my life is no longer worth living."
Striving for an explanation for the abrupt
about-face in Brudno's outlook toward life, a
neighbor said:
"He looked like a regular guy. I saw him about
the house and he looked okay."
But apparently there had been warning signs.
Like other POWs, he had been under psychiatric
treatment since his return.
And police quoted his mother-in-law, Bernice
Gitenstein, as saying Brudno had been depressed
and "contemplating suicide for some time."
Brudno was staying with Henry Gitenstein and
his wife in their home here, and it was in his
bedroom that his body was found Sunday. He went
to bed about 10 p.m. Saturday.
A tan plastic garbage bag was drawn over his
head, the string anchored in his hand.

Ellsberg Burglary Hearing Opens
LOS ANGELES — Daniel Ellsberg met with Los
Angeles County Dist. Atty. Joseph Busch yesterday,
and three Watergate conspirators were brought to
Los Angeles. All were prepared to testify at a grand
jury probe into the burglary of the office of
Ellsberg's psychiatrist.
Secret hearings open here today and are
scheduled to continue at least through Friday.
Busch's spokesman said he is still negotiating
with several former White House officials, seeking to
have them testify voluntarily about the planning of
the Watergate-style break-in.
"They are still on our list, and we hope they will
testify," the spokesman said of witnesses including
former presidential adviser John D. Ehrlichman,
former presidential counsel Charles W. Colson and
former White House aides Egil Krogh and David
Young.
Watergate principals E. Howard Hunt, Bernard
Barker and Eugenio Martinez were flown here from
the Federal Correctional Institution at Danbury,
Conn., on Sunday night. They have been granted
immunity from prosecution for their roles in the
break-in at the Beverly Hills office of Dr. Lewis
Fielding.
