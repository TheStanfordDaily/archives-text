# Federal Authorities Questioning Johnson

### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Federal authorities are questioning
ex-Stanford radical James E. Johnson
in San Juan, P.R., about several 1969
and 1970 Bay Area bombings, a Santa
Cruz County official said yesterday.
Ray Belgard, chief investigator for
the District Attorney's office, said
there was a chance Johnson would
face federal charges from the
incidents.
Johnson, sought on a charge of
illegal possession of explosives in
connection with a "bomb factory" he
supposedly operated in the Santa Cruz
Mountains, disappeared two and a half
years ago. Last week, Trinidad
authorities turned him over to FBI
agents in Puerto Rico.
In early 1971, FBI informer
Thomas Edward Mosher told a U.S.
Senate subcommittee that Johnson
took part in several Bay Area
bombings. Johnson was never charged
with these crimes.
FBI Questioning
Mike Field, assistant U.S. attorney
for Northern California, said he was
"sure" the FBI was questioning
Johnson about other possible offenses
besides the Santa Cruz allegations.
He said the U.S. atto ney would
review the FBl's repct before
deciding whether to seek a grand jury
indictment on any federal charges.
Johnson was arrested on a federal
fugitive warrant issued at Santa Cruz

County's request. However, a U.S.
magistrate will probably dismiss the
unlawful flight charge at a hearing
Thursday, paving the way for
Johnson's extradition.
Claim Deferred
If fedral prosecutors decide to
charge him with any other offenses,
however, Palgard said Santa Cruz
would probably defer its claim on him
until after the federal proceedings.
In his testimony, Mosher linked
Johnson to a bombing at the Marin
County Courthouse in San Rafael,
and the attempted bombing of a Palo
Alto building housing both a Bank of
America branch and an FBI office.
He also said Johnson helped dispose
of the body of former Black Panther
Party captain Amon "Fred" Bennett,
murdered near Santa Cruz Jan. 6,
1971.
Dean to Defend?
Meanwhile, assistant Law School
dean Thelton Henderson termed
"speculative" reports that he would
help defend Johnson.
Henderson said yesterday he was
Johnson's last attorney of record, but
"I haven't talked to him, and I'm not
even certain I could take his case"
because of the pressures of his job.
Henderson said he was leaving the
campus this week on a business trip,
and will be unable to consider the
matter until he returns.
