# Professor Slated To Orbit Earth During 56-Day Skylab II Mission
## 
### PETER ALESHIRE 
Stanford professors are both
astronauts and researchers in the
trouble-plagued Skylab program,
which recently launched America's
first manned orbiting scientific
laboratory.
Prof. Owen Garriott is slated to be
a member of the three-man Skylab II
crew schedueld to blast off August 8.
If the planned schedule holds, Garriott
and his fellow astronauts, Alan Bean
and Jack Lousma, will be aloft for 56
days.
The Skylab II astronauts will be
able to work in comparative comfort
in the 13,000 cubic foot workshop. The
space-station is about the size of a
small, two-bedroom house, with full
living and working facilities.
The 56 day mission will set a new
record for time in space. The Skylab I
crew plans on spending 28 days. In
1971 the Russian crew of Soyuz II
lived 23 days in space but was killed

on re-entry by a hatch leak in the
capsule.
Garriott is an electrical engineering
professor, specializing in
electromagnetic theory and
ionospheric physics. He holds a
Master's and Ph.D. degrees in electrical
engineering from Stanford. Garriott is
on leave from Stanford while training
for the August mission.
The 42 year-old Garriott joined the
NASA space program in 1965. The
scientist-astronaut learned to fly jet
airplanes then continued intensive
training at the Manned Space Center in
Houston.
The other Stanford professors are
working on Skylab experiments. Over
50 experiments are still planned for
Skylab. Five of the original
experiments have been cancelled.
These depended on the use of a port
which is now covered by the sunshade
improvided by the astronauts.
Dr. Leonard Hayflick, Professor of

Medical Microbiology at the School of
Medicine, is working on an experiment
on the effects of weightlessness on
human cells. The experiment was
originally scheduled to run during the
present Skylab mission, but was
postponed until August due to the
emergency repair operations. The
experimental equipment was left off
to make room for the parasol
sun-shade.
The cell experiment is to evaluate
the long-term effects of weightlessness
on a colony of living human cells. The
cell colony which is to be used has
been extensively studied for the past
11 years according to Medical Center
News Bureau spokesmen. Cellular
activity will be monitored and
compared with a control culture back
on earth.
The spokesman said researchers will
be studying the effects on genetics and

reproduction of zero gravity
conditions. The activity of the cells
will be constantly recorded by a
variety of instruments.
Researchers are also hoping for new
insights into the aging process,
according to the spokesman. In a
normal cell-culture cells divide up to
50 times before they die. In an adult
human, however, cells only divide 20
times before dying. .Aspokesman said
the researchers will be watching the
effects of weightlessness on cell
division.
Colin Pittendrigh, biology
professor, is working on an experiment
on "biological clocks" in mice and
fruit flies, according to the University
news service. The experiment will go
up on the next mission. Pittendrigh
has not made any statements to the
press and was not available for
comment.

FAR OUT PROF—Electrical Engineering Prof. Owen Garriott is scheduled to lift
off in August as part of the Skylab II crew. Two other professors here are
conducting research experiments during the Skylab space-laboratory program.
