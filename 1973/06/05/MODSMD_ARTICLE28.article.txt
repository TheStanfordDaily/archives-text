# ASSU Presidents Blast Judicial Plan
## 
### ROBERT BACON 
The ASSU Council of Presidents
this week issued a scathing
condemnation of the proposed new
student judicial system, and
announced that the proposal would be
the subject of a student referendum in
October.
The Committee of 15 (C-15), a
student-faculty-administration group,
last month offered the proposal, which
calls for a judicial panel with a student
majority.
Approval by the University
President, the Faculty Senate, and

either the ASSU Senate or a student
referendum is required to put the
system into effect.
The Council of Presidents asserted
that "the students lost on
every . . . major issue" and urged that
students not "vote to legitimize a
judicial system as demeaning as the
current C-15 report."
Reasonable Compromise
C-15 chairman Jim Anderson, a
student, responded that his
committee's plan was "a reasonable
compromise that would work if ever
put into action. ...

"I think it's the best we could get
for the last several years. If the
students turn this down, there's just
no chance as I see it of getting
anything next year," Anderson
indicated.
Petitions have been submitted by
students, including Council of
Presidents members, containing about
700 student signatures, calling for the
referendum on the C-15 proposal next
October 9 and 10.
Referendum
ASSU President Kevin O'Grady said
yesterday that the referendum would
override any action that the ASSU
Senate might take on the C-15
proposal in the meantime.
The Council of Presidents found
particularly galling the fact that the
student or faculty senate, by
two-thirds vote, or the University
President could reduce the number of
student posts on the ajudicatory
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC) by

one, eliminating the student majority.
This, they said, makes the student
majority "meaningless."
Necessary
Anderson responded that this
cancellation provision was necessary to
obtain a student majority on the SJC.
A student referendum in the spring
of 1972 instructed student members
of the C-15 to insist on a student
majority on any judicial panel the
C-15 might propose.
O'Grady insisted that if the present
proposal is defeated by the students in
October, the students could obtain a
system more to his liking during
1973-74, contrary to Anderson's
impression.
The Council of Presidents
statement said "the students' only
bargaining card in C-15 deliberations is
the fact that the administration is in
the embarassing situation of operating
a student judicial system that has never
been approved by students."
