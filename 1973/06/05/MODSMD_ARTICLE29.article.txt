# Testimony Continues In Chino Prosecution
## 
### TERRY ANZUR News Analysis 
The prosecution in the trial of
Andrea Holman Burt and Benton
Douglas Burt continues to call
witnesses in an attempt to convict the
Burts on charges of murder, assault
and lynching (freeing a prisoner).
The Burts are charged in San
Bernardino County Superior Court in
connection with an Oct. 6
ambush-escape which freed convict
Ronald Wayne Beaty from the
California Institution for Men at Chino
and left a prison guard dead.
In a separate trial, former
Venceremos central committee
member Jean Hobson and accused
"trigger-man" Robert Seabock will
face identical charges. Deputy District
Attorney Joseph Canty is attempting
to prove the existence of a conspiracy
to free Beaty and conceal him while he
was a fugitive.
The prosecutor is introducing
evidence concerning Hobson and
Seabock during the Burts' trial,
seeking to show that the Burts
conspired with Hobson, Seabock, and
others in the escape plan.
Two-Fold Strength
The possible strengths of the
prosecution's case are two: the
testimony of Beaty, who turned state's
evidence in a plea bargain and received
a life sentence for murder after he was
recaptured last December 11; and
Canty's producing of much evidence
that apparently corroborates Beaty's
story.
Yet these two potential strengths
have proved to be the areas most
vulnerable to attack by the Burts'
attorneys, Charles Garry and Tom
Nolan.
The defense has assailed Beaty's
credibility. On May 9, Garry's
cross-examination elicited Beaty's
admission that he "didn't tell the
complete truth" when he testified
before a grand jury in San Francisco
investigating the Oct. 6. incident.
The defense has consistently
criticized the prosecution for its
handling of evidence in the Burts' case,
and has challenged the admissibility of
much of that evidence.
Defense Challenges Evidence
Defense challenges to the handling
of evidence by the prosecution include
the following:
— a motion to suppress evidence
seized in excess of search warrant
provisions when police searched the
Burts' Hayward apartment last
October. The suppression was granted
and later withdrawn tc prevent an
appeal that would slow the trial,
— a move for dismissal, on the
grounds that the prosecution had
allegedly mishandled and denied the
existence of a report of California
Highway Patrolman Keith Hittson.
Although the judge criticized the
prosecution's action, he denied the
dismissal motion and permitted
Hittson to testify,
challenging the state's
suppression of telephone company
records the defense claims are
exculpatory,
— pointing to the failure of a
witness to recognize Andrea Burt, and
— questioning the legality of the
methods by which various evidence
was produced. On May 24, the
prosecutor rpported that three police
investigators had removed three

cartons of documents from the Burts'
Hayward apartment without a search
warrant.
Dismissal Not Forseen
Andrea Burt's father, Medicine
Prof. Halsted Holman, said Sunday
that defense attorneys had told him
there was little chance that what the
defense claims are questionable
investigation procedures would force
dismissal of the case.
Holman estimated that the defense
will cost more than $100,000.
Comparatively little has been received
through Chino Defense Committee
fund, he said, adding that he provided
most of the defense funds. He spends
one or two days each week at the trial,
but insists it hasn't interfered with his
teaching. "Others have been able to fill
in for me," he said.
Pre-Trial Motion Delay
Pre-trial motions continue to delay
the start of Hobson and Seabock's
trial, and a trial date has not yet been
set. The motions on file include a
move to quash the San Bernardino
County grand jury that indicted
Hobson, Seabock, and the Burts.
Three other persons face criminal
charges in Arizona in connection with
Beaty's escape. A federal grand jury in
San Francisco is still looking into the
case, and more indictments there are
possible. Meanwhile, two persons
remain jailed for their refusal to testify
before that panel.
Federal prosecutor N. Warner Lee
stated that expected pre-trial motions
in the Arizona case of Dr. Harry
Bishara and his wife Lorraine and
Stanford law student Mick Goldstein,
should not delay the start of their
trial. It is scheduled to begin July 31
in Tuscon, Ariz.
The three defendants have pleaded
not guilty to four felony charges
including concealing an escaped
prisoner, concealing a person from
arrest, concealing a felony, and being
accessories after the fact.
The charges also stem from Beaty's
escape, as all three Arizona defendants
are accused of harboring Beaty while
he was at large.
Grand Jury Probe
On May 4, the term of the San
Francisco grand jury investigating the
escape was extended for four months.
Hence Milton and Laura Taulbee, who
have refused to testify before that
panel about the time they spent in a
mountain cabin where Beaty hid after
the escape, will remain jailed.
For their refusal to testify, the
Taulbees may be jailed for the entire
term of the San Francisco grand jury,
up to 18 months. However, their
attorney states that a motion for their
release will be heard next week.
Jane Franklin, wife of fired English
Prof. H. Bruce Franklin said yesterday
that she believes the grand jury is
continuing to seek indictments in
connection with the escape. Bruce
Franklin was arrested during an
investigation last December, on
charges of harboring Beaty, but was
later released. The grand jury is
believed to be considering indictments
against Franklin and others in the case.
"I really don't know how they can
indict Bruce," Bhe noted, referring to
Beaty's recent testimony in the Burt
trial that he lied to the grand jury
when he said Bruce Franklin aided him
after his escape. But she said she
wouldn't be surprised if an indictment
against her husband was forthcoming.
