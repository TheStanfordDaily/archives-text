# Worker Vote To Decide Union Issue Tomorrow
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Some 1600 University technical,
maintenance, aid servico employees
will vote on union representation
tomorrow.
They will vole "yes" cr "no" for
United Stanford Employees (USE),
Local 680, Service Employees
International Union (SEIU), AFL-CIO.
If USE receives a majority of votes
cast, it will be certified by the
National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) as the official representative
of the workers, the first time in
history University employees have had
such a representative. If that happens,
the union, rather than the individual
employee, will bargain with the
University over such issues as pay,
benefits, and job security.
The election tomorrow will include
all maintenance, laboratory support,
custodial and food service employees,
as well as audio-visual operators,
non-exempt computer operations

personnel and book preservers
employed by the University in
Northern California.
Excluded Employees
Excluded from the unit are
Hospital employees, office and clerical
workers, programmers and
"professional" employees.
All 1600 employees will be
required to join USE if it wins the
election.
Last year, essentially the same
group of voters refused union
representation. However, the situation
was somewhat different then, as three
unions, USE, the Teamsters, and the
now-dormant Stanford Employees
Association, sought to represent the
employees.
The Teamsters and the "no union"
choice received the most votes in the
first election, with "no union"
winning in the runoff.
USE is quick to point out that in
last year's first election, 63 percent of
the workers wanted some union.
In that election, USE received 21
percent of the vote.
613 Signatures
Since then, USE has gotten 613
workers — 38 percent of the total unit
of 1600 — to sign petitions calling for
another election this year. The
signatures of only 30 percent of the
unit members are necessary to call an
election.
USE claims it affiliated with SEIU
last April because it offers more
autonomy than do other AFL-CIO
unions. USE is its own local and says it
has nearly complete autonomy from
the SEIU national leadership.
The AFL-CIO is a loose
organization of various unions, and has
practically no power over either SEIU
or USE.
Affiliation Agreement
USE, by affiliating with SEIU, has
received $3,000 with which to run its
campaign, and, according to the
affiliation agreement, SEIU will give
USE aid in negotiating a contract with
the University should USE win the
representation election. SEIU will also

contribute funds for on-campus
organizing of workers not in the
present unit.
, In return, USE members will nay
the SEIU dues of $1.30 per monti;, as
the usual minimum of $5 per member
per month was waived in USE's case.
All this is contingent upon USE's
winning the election. If it does not do
so it will continue to be a local of the
SEIU, but with no power to force
anyone to become a member or to
bargain with the University, although
it could attempt to gather enough
signatures to force another election in
a year's time.
Mixed Blessing?
Yesterday, Venceremos, a Peninsula
Maoist organization, endorsed USE in
1000 leaflets distributed across
campus. The endorsement may bring
charges that USE is a radical
organization.
However, Linda Crouse,
spokeswoman for Venceremos, denied
this charge, saying "If it [the leaflet]
is a correct analysis, people will accept
it no matter who writes it."
Roland Finston, secretary of USE,
agreed. "I think employees see there is
a clear distinction between
Venceremos, which is primarily an
off-campus political organization, and
USE, which is a broad diversified
union with all political views
represented."
This year, USE has had no official
opposition since the withdrawal in
May of the Stanford Joint Council, a
rival labor group.
The Joint Council, made up of
locals of the American Federation of
State, County and Municipal
Employees and the International
Brotherhood of Operating Engineers,
left the race because it felt that, with
two unions on the ballot, it couldn't
win, according to its spokesman, Don
Mowery.
The University is officially neutral
in the race. However, it has paid for a
series of informational advertisements
in the Daily, which have been labelled
"anti-union" by USE.

If USE receives a majority of votes
cast, it will be certified by the
National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) as the official representative
of the workers, the first time in
history University employees have had
such a representative. If that happens,
the union, rather than the individual
employee, will bargain with the
University over such issues as pay,
benefits, and job security.
The election tomorrow will include
all maintenance, laboratory support,
custodial and food service employees,
as well as audio-visual operators,
non-exempt computer operations

personnel and book preservers
employed by the University in
Northern California.
Excluded Employees
Excluded from the unit are
Hospital employees, office and clerical
workers, programmers and
"professional" employees.
All 1600 employees will be
required to join USE if it wins the
election.
Last year, essentially the same
group of voters refused union
representation. However, the situation
was somewhat different then, as three
unions, USE, the Teamsters, and the
now-dormant Stanford Employees
Association, sought to represent the
employees.
The Teamsters and the "no union"
choice received the most votes in the
first election, with "no union"
winning in the runoff.
USE is quick to point out that in
last year's first election, 63 percent of
the workers wanted some union.
In that election, USE received 21
percent of the vote.
613 Signatures
Since then, USE has gotten 613
workers — 38 percent of the total unit
of 1600 — to sign petitions calling for
another election this year. The
signatures of only 30 percent of the
unit members are necessary to call an
election.
USE claims it affiliated with SEIU
last April because it offers more
autonomy than do other AFL-CIO
unions. USE is its own local and says it
has nearly complete autonomy from
the SEIU national leadership.
The AFL-CIO is a loose
organization of various unions, and has
practically no power over either SEIU
or USE.
Affiliation Agreement
USE, by affiliating with SEIU, has
received $3,000 with which to run its
campaign, and, according to the
affiliation agreement, SEIU will give
USE aid in negotiating a contract with
the University should USE win the
representation election. SEIU will also

contribute funds for on-campus
organizing of workers not in the
present unit.
, In return, USE members will nay
the SEIU dues of $1.30 per monti;, as
the usual minimum of $5 per member
per month was waived in USE's case.
All this is contingent upon USE's
winning the election. If it does not do
so it will continue to be a local of the
SEIU, but with no power to force
anyone to become a member or to
bargain with the University, although
it could attempt to gather enough
signatures to force another election in
a year's time.
Mixed Blessing?
Yesterday, Venceremos, a Peninsula
Maoist organization, endorsed USE in
1000 leaflets distributed across
campus. The endorsement may bring
charges that USE is a radical
organization.
However, Linda Crouse,
spokeswoman for Venceremos, denied
this charge, saying "If it [the leaflet]
is a correct analysis, people will accept
it no matter who writes it."
Roland Finston, secretary of USE,
agreed. "I think employees see there is
a clear distinction between
Venceremos, which is primarily an
off-campus political organization, and
USE, which is a broad diversified
union with all political views
represented."
This year, USE has had no official
opposition since the withdrawal in
May of the Stanford Joint Council, a
rival labor group.
The Joint Council, made up of
locals of the American Federation of
State, County and Municipal
Employees and the International
Brotherhood of Operating Engineers,
left the race because it felt that, with
two unions on the ballot, it couldn't
win, according to its spokesman, Don
Mowery.
The University is officially neutral
in the race. However, it has paid for a
series of informational advertisements
in the Daily, which have been labelled
"anti-union" by USE.
Some 1600 University technical,
maintenance, aid servico employees
will vote on union representation
tomorrow.
They will vole "yes" cr "no" for
United Stanford Employees (USE),
Local 680, Service Employees
