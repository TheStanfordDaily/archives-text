# Discrimination Problems Aren't Over Yet
## Lyman Deplores Waning Interest In Minorities 
### LARRY FLEECE 
"Over the long run, America will
not have solved its problems of
discrimination until people of color
have invaded in large numbers the
professions and the upper echelons of
business and government," President
Richard Lyman said last Saturday.
In a speech delivered to the annual
campus conference of the Alumni
Association, Lyman discussed diversity
in the University student body, and
the importance of a sustained interest
and concern for minority enrollment.
"Currently, Stanford undergraduate
admissions policy puts some emphasis
upon diversity of talents and
outlooks," Lyman said. "Since the
later 19605, there has been a conscious
effort to achieve greater ethnic and
socio-economic diversity as well."
Lyman noted that enrollment of
black, Chicano, and American Indian
students has risen from 120 in the fall
of 1967 to 1,060 last fall, including
420 graduate students. Enrollment of
Asian Americans has doubled to more
than 400.
"If there is one thing that we have
learned over the last five years, it is
that minority students can make it,
need not be condescended to or made
the recipients — and victims — of a lot
of special academic pampering," he
said.
Balance Two Interests
Lyman explained that the
University seeks to balance the interest
of "cultural diversity with the interest
of sustaining a high standard of
academic achievement," in order to
"do what we purport to do for all
students, minority and majority alike:

offer a first-class education for future
leaders in the professions and cultural
life of the country."
Lyman acknowledged the difficult
question and conflicting interests
which minority students must face
upon graduation. "Must they return to
the ghetto or the barrio (or go there
for the first time, since by no means
all have come from there)? Is a career
in themainstream of American middle
class society in itself wrong for them?
In some sense a betrayal?"
But he said, "The country has never
been run from its most impoverished
areas, and it's safe to predict that it
never will be.
Opportunity Threatened
Lyman warned that the basic
commitment to equal opportunity in
higher education is threatened in
several ways:
"First, the national enthusiasm for
struggling towards racial justice has

dimmed. Achieving racial justice is a
long haul.
"Second, just at the moment, we
are terribly distracted by other
problems," such as corruption.
"Third, there is also a danger from
too much pessimism. Significant things
have been accomplished. If there is
still a long, long way to go, we have
made some headway. It is a clear
disservice to the cause of racial justice
to deny the facts of progress so far."
Persistent Themes
He said that many minority
students at Stanford are "quite
content; most value greatly the
opportunity they have here. But there
are persistent themes also of
alienation,, resentment, and doubt.
"Resentment at such things as
finding themselves sometimes treated
more as resource persons, as
sociological phenomena, than as fellow
students.

And, Lyman pointed out, "any
honest assessment of the situation, not
only at Stanford but across the
country, would have to include
uneasiness at the continuing tendency
toward self-segregation of minority
students.
Self-Segregation Tragic
"While it is easy to understand a
prrmrf desire not simply to become
engulfed in the culture of the white
majority, beyond a point
self-segregation is tragic, precisely
because it allows facile assumptions on
everyone's part to go unchallenged."
Lyman said that four years ago, he
raised the question, "How do we
protect all concerned — white, black,
brown, yellow alike — from the clear
and present danger of racial
parochialism?"
He concluded, "I don't think we've
found a clear and satisfactory answer
yet."
