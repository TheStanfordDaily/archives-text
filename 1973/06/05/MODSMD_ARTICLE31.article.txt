# Alioto Attacks Nixon Campaign, Hints He'll Run For Governor
## 
### CHESS ERWIN 
San Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto
said Thursday that the most important
issue facing the U.S. today is the
"restoration of the integrity" of
elected public officials.
Speaking before about 120 people
in a forum sponsored by the Graduate
School of Business, Alioto moved
quickly from one question to another.

Scheduled to speak for an hour and a
half, he curtailed his remarks after 20
minutes due to another pressing
commitment.
Alioto was warmly received by the
audience.
"One question I'm always asked at
these things," stated Alioto, "is
whether or not I'm running for
governor. I spoke before a Rotary
luncheon in Beverly Hills several weeks
ago and the question came up again. I
told them, 'what the hell do you think
I'm doing here?' " This was another of
Alioto's unsubtle hints about his 1974
gubernatorial hopes.
Commenting on corruption in
government, Alioto stated that he
knew of the activities of John
Mitchell, John Ehrlichman, and Egil
Krogh three years ago. "I knew about
the secret funds they had for political
sabotage some time ago," commented
Alioto. "I knew about that bum
[ Krogh 1 before he became a
celebrity," he added.
"If you give people incentives for
corruption, then they'll act that way.
The people need to be vigilant and
avoid persons who can't resist
temptations because the standards of
conduct won't change," explained
Alioto.
Restore Integrity
"By electing people with a sense for
individual privacy and true freedom,
integrity can be restored," said Alioto.
"Did Nixon ever run a clean
campaign?" he asked.
Alioto cited a loan to President
Nixon's brother Donald by
industrialist Howard Hughes in 1956
as a case in point. He continued by
saying that "judgments on honesty
aren't that hard to make."
Alioto hit hard at the problem of
the environment versus growth in

California. "Freedom of movement
has intensified the problems of the
cities. Nixon said that the problem of
the cities is over, but I don't know
what cities he is talking about,"
remarked Alioto.
'Magnetic' Cities
"Cities are desirable and often have
a magnetic quality about them. San
Francisco is experiencing movement
within the city and is changing a great
deal. However, our population will be
fairly stable because of zoning laws.
The city is currently getting a large
inflow of Caucasians as well as a large
number of single swingers," noted
Alioto.
To solve the problem of the
environment, Alioto said that
compromises will be needed. Alaskan
oil is a good example of this, he stated.
"We don't need an auto monopoly in
the U.S. when five or six Arabs hold a
world oil monopoly themselves,"
explained Alioto.
"The election of Tom Bradley as
mayor of Los Angeles was a historic
event," noted Alioto. "Tom is a
talented person who understands the
problems of the cities. He proved
clearly that whites will elect a black
mayor," continued Alioto. "I will
work closely with him, particularly
during the upcoming conference of
mayors in June."

he will enter the 1974 race for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination.
