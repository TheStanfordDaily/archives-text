changes must be approved by three constituencies-the
students, faculty, and President of the University.
According to C/ 15 Chairman James Anderson, there

1. The composition of the Stanford Judicial Council
would be enlarged by one student to include four
students, three faculty, and one chairman

Judicial Panel would be incorporated into the new
charter. (See 11-C for details.)
The changes alos include a provision that if any of the
constituencies determines that the operation of the
judicial council is impaired by the composition of that
body, the number of students may be reduced by one

obligated to apply University regulations governing stu

hearing regarding his case, the SJC shall decide upon an
appropriate sanction for such nonappearance, and upon
request of the complainant, and with at least seven days
notice to the defendant, may hold a proceeding con
ducted by a Hearing Officer for the purpose of pre
serving testimony relevant to the charges. Notice shall be
, considered effective on deposit in the U.S. mail
addressed to the defendant at his last mailing address
known to the SJC Chairman. If at any subsequent

•available, the preserved testimony of that witness shall
be given the same weight as would such testimony
adduced from the witness in person at the hearing.

case, he shall be subject to full examination and cross
examination.
3. If a defendant or any other witness begins to

to be decided in the near future. The SJC may grant
such a postponement, in its discretion, but in no event
shall the postponement extend beyond the quarter
following the quarter during which charges before the
SJC were preferred. In determining penalties for a
defendant who has already been convicted in a state or
federal court, the SJC shall consider the equities of the
situation, including the necessity to protect the Univer

persons necessary to an appropriate and convenient
disposition of the case. Upon specific request of any
defendant, the Hearing Officer or the SJC Chairman
shall caution all persons then present at a confidential
hearing not to reveal to any person outside the hearing
room facts which would tend to identify any defendant
in the case.
9. To have his advisor or representative, if any,
present throughout all hearings in his case.

hearings.

1. The SJC Chairman has authority to control the
conduct of persons in the Council chambers, i.e. to
maintain order.
2. If, during hearings of the SJC, and after suitable
warning, a person intentionally disrupts the proceedings,
or makes threats of physical harm or otherwise intimi
dates any person present at the proceedings, or refuses
to comply with an order of the SJC Chairman issued
under 11.G.1., the SJC shall immediately, upon motion
of the Chairman or any other member of the SJC,

Following is the text of promised revisions in Articles
II and HI of the Stanfo'd Legislative and Judicial
Charter of 1968, as recomm 'tided by a 14-1 vote of the
Committee of Fifteen. To become effective these
changes must be approved by three constituencies-the
students, faculty, and President of the University.
According to C/ 15 Chairman James Anderson, there
are three main features in the proposed revisions:
1. The composition of the Stanford Judicial Council
would be enlarged by one student to include four
students, three faculty, and one chairman
from the Law School. (See ILB for details.)
2. The C/ 15 itself would be reduced in size to eight
persons and its name changed to the Committee on
Charter Amendments. (See (111-B for details.)
3. The hearing officer system of the present Campus
Judicial Panel would be incorporated into the new
charter. (See 11-C for details.)
The changes alos include a provision that if any of the
constituencies determines that the operation of the
judicial council is impaired by the composition of that
body, the number of students may be reduced by one
(See 11-B-6 for details.) This can be done by two thirds
vote of either the Student Senate or the Faculty Senate,

Following is the text of promised revisions in Articles
II and HI of the Stanfo'd Legislative and Judicial
Charter of 1968, as recomm 'tided by a 14-1 vote of the
Committee of Fifteen. To become effective these
changes must be approved by three constituencies-the
students, faculty, and President of the University.
According to C/ 15 Chairman James Anderson, there
are three main features in the proposed revisions:
1. The composition of the Stanford Judicial Council
would be enlarged by one student to include four
students, three faculty, and one chairman
from the Law School. (See ILB for details.)
2. The C/ 15 itself would be reduced in size to eight
persons and its name changed to the Committee on
Charter Amendments. (See (111-B for details.)
3. The hearing officer system of the present Campus
Judicial Panel would be incorporated into the new
charter. (See 11-C for details.)
The changes alos include a provision that if any of the
constituencies determines that the operation of the
judicial council is impaired by the composition of that
body, the number of students may be reduced by one
(See 11-B-6 for details.) This can be done by two thirds
vote of either the Student Senate or the Faculty Senate,
or by the University President. (See (11-B-6 for details).

Following is the text of promised revisions in Articles
II and HI of the Stanfo'd Legislative and Judicial
Charter of 1968, as recomm 'tided by a 14-1 vote of the
Committee of Fifteen. To become effective these
changes must be approved by three constituencies-the
students, faculty, and President of the University.
According to C/ 15 Chairman James Anderson, there
are three main features in the proposed revisions:
1. The composition of the Stanford Judicial Council
would be enlarged by one student to include four
students, three faculty, and one chairman
from the Law School. (See ILB for details.)
2. The C/ 15 itself would be reduced in size to eight
persons and its name changed to the Committee on
Charter Amendments. (See (111-B for details.)
3. The hearing officer system of the present Campus
Judicial Panel would be incorporated into the new
charter. (See 11-C for details.)
The changes alos include a provision that if any of the
constituencies determines that the operation of the
judicial council is impaired by the composition of that
body, the number of students may be reduced by one
(See 11-B-6 for details.) This can be done by two thirds
vote of either the Student Senate or the Faculty Senate,
or by the University President. (See (11-B-6 for details).
11. STANFORD JUDICIAL COUNCIL (SJC)
A. Jurisdiction
1. The SJC shall have jurisdiction over all student
disciplinary cases. Its decisions shall not be appealable
except in the sense that all its decisions must be
recommendations to the University President, provided

For purposes of this section a student is any person
eligible to matriculate at Stanford without applying for
readmission.

judicial system in effect at the time of the alleged
disciplinary action.
B. Composition
1. Composition of the SJC shall be:
a. A Chairman, from the Law School faculty or
someone with equivalent qualifications, appointed by

appropriate sanction for such nonappearance, and upon
request of the complainant, and with at least seven days
notice to the defendant, may hold a proceeding con
ducted by a Hearing Officer for the purpose of pre
serving testimony relevant to the charges. Notice shall be
, considered effective on deposit in the U.S. mail
addressed to the defendant at his last mailing address

to be decided in the near future. The SJC may grant
such a postponement, in its discretion, but in no event
shall the postponement extend beyond the quarter
following the quarter during which charges before the

hearing regarding his case, the SJC shall decide upon an
appropriate sanction for such nonappearance, and upon
request of the complainant, and with at least seven days
notice to the defendant, may hold a proceeding con
ducted by a Hearing Officer for the purpose of pre
serving testimony relevant to the charges. Notice shall be

case, he shall be subject to full examination and cross
examination.

to be decided in the near future. The SJC may grant
such a postponement, in its discretion, but in no event
shall the postponement extend beyond the quarter
following the quarter during which charges before the

hearing not to reveal to any person outside the hearing
room facts which would tend to identify any defendant
in the case.

conduct of persons in the Council chambers, i.e. to
maintain order.

warning, a person intentionally disrupts the proceedings,
or makes threats of physical harm or otherwise intimi

Following is the text of promised revisions in Articles
II and HI of the Stanfo'd Legislative and Judicial
Charter of 1968, as recomm 'tided by a 14-1 vote of the
Committee of Fifteen. To become effective these
changes must be approved by three constituencies-the
students, faculty, and President of the University.
According to C/ 15 Chairman James Anderson, there
are three main features in the proposed revisions:
1. The composition of the Stanford Judicial Council
would be enlarged by one student to include four
students, three faculty, and one chairman
from the Law School. (See ILB for details.)
2. The C/ 15 itself would be reduced in size to eight
persons and its name changed to the Committee on
Charter Amendments. (See (111-B for details.)
3. The hearing officer system of the present Campus
Judicial Panel would be incorporated into the new
charter. (See 11-C for details.)
The changes alos include a provision that if any of the
constituencies determines that the operation of the
judicial council is impaired by the composition of that
body, the number of students may be reduced by one
(See 11-B-6 for details.) This can be done by two thirds
vote of either the Student Senate or the Faculty Senate,

Following is the text of promised revisions in Articles
II and HI of the Stanfo'd Legislative and Judicial
Charter of 1968, as recomm 'tided by a 14-1 vote of the
Committee of Fifteen. To become effective these
changes must be approved by three constituencies-the
students, faculty, and President of the University.
According to C/ 15 Chairman James Anderson, there
are three main features in the proposed revisions:
1. The composition of the Stanford Judicial Council
would be enlarged by one student to include four
students, three faculty, and one chairman
from the Law School. (See ILB for details.)
2. The C/ 15 itself would be reduced in size to eight
persons and its name changed to the Committee on
Charter Amendments. (See (111-B for details.)
3. The hearing officer system of the present Campus
Judicial Panel would be incorporated into the new
charter. (See 11-C for details.)
The changes alos include a provision that if any of the
constituencies determines that the operation of the
judicial council is impaired by the composition of that
body, the number of students may be reduced by one
(See 11-B-6 for details.) This can be done by two thirds
vote of either the Student Senate or the Faculty Senate,
or by the University President. (See (11-B-6 for details).

Following is the text of promised revisions in Articles
II and HI of the Stanfo'd Legislative and Judicial
Charter of 1968, as recomm 'tided by a 14-1 vote of the
Committee of Fifteen. To become effective these
changes must be approved by three constituencies-the
students, faculty, and President of the University.
According to C/ 15 Chairman James Anderson, there
are three main features in the proposed revisions:
1. The composition of the Stanford Judicial Council
would be enlarged by one student to include four
students, three faculty, and one chairman
from the Law School. (See ILB for details.)
2. The C/ 15 itself would be reduced in size to eight
persons and its name changed to the Committee on
Charter Amendments. (See (111-B for details.)
3. The hearing officer system of the present Campus
Judicial Panel would be incorporated into the new
charter. (See 11-C for details.)
The changes alos include a provision that if any of the
constituencies determines that the operation of the
judicial council is impaired by the composition of that
body, the number of students may be reduced by one
(See 11-B-6 for details.) This can be done by two thirds
vote of either the Student Senate or the Faculty Senate,
or by the University President. (See (11-B-6 for details).
11. STANFORD JUDICIAL COUNCIL (SJC)
A. Jurisdiction
1. The SJC shall have jurisdiction over all student
disciplinary cases. Its decisions shall not be appealable
except in the sense that all its decisions must be

without his consent and without adjudication under the
judicial system in effect at the time of the alleged
disciplinary action.
B. Composition
1. Composition of the SJC shall be:
a. A Chairman, from the Law School faculty or
someone with equivalent qualifications, appointed by

Officer shall ask such questions as may be necessary to
satisfy the Hearing Officer that each witness has been
appropriately questioned on matters concerning credibil
ity and all substantially relevant issues of fact.

appropriate sanction for such nonappearance, and upon
request of the complainant, and with at least seven days
notice to the defendant, may hold a proceeding con
ducted by a Hearing Officer for the purpose of pre
serving testimony relevant to the charges. Notice shall be
, considered effective on deposit in the U.S. mail
addressed to the defendant at his last mailing address

case, he shall be subject to full examination and cross
examination.

to be decided in the near future. The SJC may grant
such a postponement, in its discretion, but in no event
shall the postponement extend beyond the quarter
following the quarter during which charges before the

defendant who has already been convicted in a state or
federal court, the SJC shall consider the equities of the
situation, including the necessity to protect the Univer

such a postponement, in its discretion, but in no event
shall the postponement extend beyond the quarter
following the quarter during which charges before the

Following is the text of promised revisions in Articles
II and HI of the Stanfo'd Legislative and Judicial
Charter of 1968, as recomm 'tided by a 14-1 vote of the
Committee of Fifteen. To become effective these
changes must be approved by three constituencies-the
students, faculty, and President of the University.
According to C/ 15 Chairman James Anderson, there
are three main features in the proposed revisions:
1. The composition of the Stanford Judicial Council
would be enlarged by one student to include four
students, three faculty, and one chairman
from the Law School. (See ILB for details.)
2. The C/ 15 itself would be reduced in size to eight
persons and its name changed to the Committee on
Charter Amendments. (See (111-B for details.)
3. The hearing officer system of the present Campus
Judicial Panel would be incorporated into the new
charter. (See 11-C for details.)
The changes alos include a provision that if any of the
constituencies determines that the operation of the
judicial council is impaired by the composition of that
body, the number of students may be reduced by one
(See 11-B-6 for details.) This can be done by two thirds
vote of either the Student Senate or the Faculty Senate,
or by the University President. (See (11-B-6 for details).

Following is the text of promised revisions in Articles
II and HI of the Stanfo'd Legislative and Judicial
Charter of 1968, as recomm 'tided by a 14-1 vote of the
Committee of Fifteen. To become effective these
changes must be approved by three constituencies-the
students, faculty, and President of the University.
According to C/ 15 Chairman James Anderson, there
are three main features in the proposed revisions:
1. The composition of the Stanford Judicial Council
would be enlarged by one student to include four
students, three faculty, and one chairman
from the Law School. (See ILB for details.)
2. The C/ 15 itself would be reduced in size to eight
persons and its name changed to the Committee on
Charter Amendments. (See (111-B for details.)
3. The hearing officer system of the present Campus
Judicial Panel would be incorporated into the new
charter. (See 11-C for details.)
The changes alos include a provision that if any of the
constituencies determines that the operation of the
judicial council is impaired by the composition of that
body, the number of students may be reduced by one
(See 11-B-6 for details.) This can be done by two thirds
vote of either the Student Senate or the Faculty Senate,
or by the University President. (See (11-B-6 for details).
