Monro surprised the academic world in 1967
when he resigned as dean of Harvard College to
take the freshman studies post at Miles, its first
white administrator. Miles was described at that
time as "small, nearly all black, unaccredited and
broke."
Miles was founded in 1905 and named for a
bishop of the Christian Methodist Episcopal
Church. Its principal purpose was to supply
teachers for the black schools in Jefferson
County, which surrounds Birmingham.

It has about 700 students, a slight majority of
them women. Most of its students commute and
most have part-time jobs.
Leadership
Through the dynamic leadership of its
president, Dr. Lucious H. Pitts, and with support
from Monro, Miles has compiled a proud record,
according to a recent profile of Monro in The
New Yorker magazine.
It was the first in the Deep South to lead the
desegregation drive, the first to establish Head
Start and VISTA programs, the first to start both
a literacy program and a job training program for
adults and the first to launch administrative
training for newly elected black college officials.
Miles was accredited by the Southern
Association of Colleges in 1969.

In 1968, Monro was named Faculty Man of
the Year. He turned over the $5000 prize to
Miles College's library.
A native of Andover, Mass., Monro was
educated at Phillips Academy and Harvard. He
was a reporter for the Boston Transcript and a
writer for the Harvard News Service.
After the war he was on his way to a job on
PM, New York liberal daily, when he was
persuaded to return to Harvard as veterans'
service officer. He stayed for 20 years. In 1958
he was appointed dean of Harvard College.
The Reverend Mr. Bennett is also a graduate
of Phillips Academy. He was educated at
Williams College, holds two degrees from Oxford
University and won his divinity degrees from
Union Theological Seminary with highest honors.
