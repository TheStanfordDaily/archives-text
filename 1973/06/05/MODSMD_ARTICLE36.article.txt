# Silly And Good: UCB Plays
## 
### JEFFERY SEGAL 
Big financial backing and
professional people often make a
superior show. But neither is any
kind of guarantee of quality. The
decisive factor in creating good
theater, as in all art, is talent,
which tends to surface against the
most impossible odds. The
difference that true creative
ability makes is evidenced in two
UC-Berkeley productions, "A
Dream Play" and "No Show
Tonight."
It is unfortunate to have to

the end. The play is fantastic,
symbolic, poetic, prayerful, and
mystic.
At its best, Berkeley's
production barely rises to the
level of silly. Most of the inane
amateurism of this production is
the responsibility of its director,
Douglas Johnson. He has totally
ignored Strindberg's explicit
desire for fluid, sweeping,
grandiose staging that would seem
to transcend all natural laws, an
opportunity that is a designer's

Indra's Daughter, namely Camille
Howard, who was by no means
ready to play a role that difficult.
The entire first scene was
rendered absolutely
incomprehensible by a Chinese
mask that somebody forgot to put
a mouth hole in. When she took it
off, her forced, unnatural,
inconsistent stage diction was not
much of an improvement.
Further, she reduced Indra's
Daughter to an insipid, saccarine
sweetness that should have been
curbed, but was probably
encouraged, by her director.
It's hard to blame the rest of
the acting for being so mediocre,
cast adrift on the stage without
any consistent directorial concept
to save it. The one major
performance with a maturity and
interpretation equal to the
demands of the play was Timothy
Soulis as the Lawyer.
Also worthy of mention in
contrast to those around them
were Brian McMahon as Indra,
and Alexander Kinney as the
Poet, who managed to be
convincing in spite of the absurd
seventeenth century frills and
prissiness imposed on him by the
shallow symbolic associations of
the costume designer.
If only the audience could
wake up from the show as if it
were only a bad dream. But no.
Audiences will continue to sleep
through this production of "A
Dream Play" for another week.
Creative Production
It's hard to believe that just
two weeks earlier a minimally
budgeted, student conceived,
directed, written, and produced
play entitled "No Show Tonight"
was shoved into the corner of the
campus called the Annahead
Something-or-other
conveited-into-a-theater.
This production proved that
the Berkeley students have a
depth, freedom, and taste to their
creativity not to be kept down.
To be sure the production had its
weak points. But the fact that it
was an entertaining, intelligent,
bravura effort on the students'
parts is indisputable.
"No Show Tonight" is a very
free adaptation of Herman Hesse's
novel, Steppenwolf." It is both a
socio-political, satirical portrait of
unscrupulous, industrialized
Germany of the 19205, and a
chronicle of the quest of modern
man to try to resolve a bourgeois
cultural heritage of convention
with the lack of sense that it
makes in a society morally,
technologically, and religiously
severed from its past.
Harry Haller, the main
character, feels split internally
between the part of him which
was culturally inbred, the serious,
rational, traditional view of the
world, and that part of his
personality which he labels the
Steppenwolf. This part is an
uncontrollable, irrational urge
that longs to slash out in pain at
institutions which no longer hold
an answer for man.
Bleak Picture
This modern world, with its
difficult and contradictory nature,
mirrored in Harry's soul and
projected into the characters
around him, is a bleak picture.
But the message of the book is
that man can transcend the much
of existence by acknowledging the
absurdity of his life and learning
to laugh at it. Laughter is the cry
of the immortals.
"No Show Tonight" is the
brainchild of its adapter and
director, Gregory Boyd. Whereas
the form of the novel stayed
within an apparently realistic
framework and the events which
occured seemed eerie and
mysterious, Gregory has chosen in
his adaptation a broader, highly
theatrical, satirical approach
which was very successful due to
his creative choices and the
tremendous simultaneous total
abandon and strict technical
discipline of his entire cast.
The style of the adaptation is
very much like Bertolt Brecht's
Epic Theater. Realistic acting that
establishes the characters is
contrasted with the techniques of
song, dance, direct audience-actor
contact, and presentational
dialogue to keep the audience
from losing themselves in the play
and to remind them that they are
in the theater to think as well as
feel.
Ever present, permeating all
the action, is the cafe where
Harry, while contemplating
suicide, meets Hermine, a
seductive courtesan representative
of the sensual side of Haller's
psyche. She is going to try to
teach Harry how to live, that is, to
laugh.
She is aided by the singer
Pablo, who is going to take Harry
into the Magic Theater of his
mind by giving him a
hallucinatory drug, and will show
him the tragicomic absurdity of
all parts of his personality, and try
to teach him not to take himself
so seriously.
The spirits of Goethe and
Mozart are enlarged from their
roles in the novel and are present
throughout the play, irreverently
indulging in the Bohemian

atmosphere of the cafe and
serving as models for the
melodramatically sombre Harry to
look to.
Outstanding Music
The original music and lyrics,
which provided musical numbers
in the "Cabaret' Mike cafe that
parallel the thought and action
happening with Harry as well as a
general background, were written
by musical director Lary Graber
and were simply outstanding.
The script was generally very
good but needed some tightening
up, especially in the beginning. Its
only serious drawback is that it
goes against Hesse's intention to
show that there is hope for Harry
in the end.
Unfortunately, space
limitations prevent adequate
praise being given to the entire
cast here, but surely they have
already received it from the
appreciative audience. Highest
laurels go to Abigail Booraem as
Hermine who was strictly superb,
the exceptionally versatile
Andrew Schneider as the Nephew
and others, and Joe McClinton as
Harry Haller himself.
Sadly, the brief run of "No
Show Tonight" is now over. But
at least when people who saw it
go to see "A Dream Play" they
will be able to say, "Berkeley can
do better than this!"
