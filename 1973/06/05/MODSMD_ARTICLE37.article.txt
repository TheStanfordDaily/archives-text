further embarrass the people who
worked on the production of
August Strindberg's "A Dream
Play" by putting their names in
print, but there are such
important lessons to be learned
from the failure of this show that
it must not be allowed to die
away quietly.
"A Dream Play" is an
archtypical Expressionist work.
There is no objective reality.
Reality is seen through and
created by a subjective
consciousness, the consciousness
of the artist or, sometimes, the
protagonist. All characters are
projections of the psyche of that
subjective consciousness, and at
the same time are typified to
represent the world and an
attitude towards it, thus keeping
expressionism from being psychic
self-indulgence.
Recurring Theme
Strindberg summed up the
structure of his play in an
unpublished preface as a
"symphony ... fuged here and
there with the main theme
constantly returning." The
preface actually published adds,
"In this dream play... the
Author has sought to reproduce
the disconnected but apparently
logical form of a dream. Anything
can happen; everything is possible
and probable. Time and space do
not exist; on a slight groundwork
of reality, imagination spins." The
only law is the will of the
dreamer.
The recurring theme of the
play is "Mankind is to be pitied."
Life is an illusion, a mirage
created in the sinful union of the
"divine primal power" and the
Earthmother Maya. Man's soul,
pure at birth, is corrupted by the
filth of life. We are made to suffer
so that we may long to get away.
Yet meanwhile we live a life that
is painful, illogical, and
contradictory.
The complaints of suffering
man are heard in the heavens
above by the daughter of the great
god Indra, and she is sent to Earth
to experience life and see if
Mankind's complaints are
justified. "A Dream Play" depicts
the Daughter's education and
pilgrimage through life, and
Mankind's salvation through her
death and entry into eternal life at

dream and could only be done at
a school with a budget like
Berkeley's.
Oriental Motif
Instead he used an Oriental
motif, valid only for the god
figures Indra and his Daughter,
and half-heartedly extended it to
the rest of the play. The basic set,
designed by Henry May, was a
well built, if not very attractive,
Japanese paddy house that looked
like it belonged in a production of
"Teahouse of the August Moon."
Set changes were indicated by
a few strategically placed props,
and were even less effective than
the design concept on the whole.
The costumes by Warren Travis
were a cultural hodgepodge that,
to someone with a very pedantic
artistic sensibility, might have
denoted the "cL am" quality of
the play.
However they were completely
out of place, for even a casual
reading of the play reveals that,
aside from the gods, Strindberg's
dream involves only figures and
customs (therefore, presumably,
dress) of his native Sweden. Lights
by Thomas White were adequate
for what they illumed.
Most foolish of all, having
boxed himself into this far too
concrete reality, were director
Johnson's attempts to ignore it.
The actors talked to the audience,
facing front. At other
times,certain characters would use
stiff, robot like movements. This
simple minded approach to
another worldly stylization fell
flat.
Appropriate Music
The only artist on the technical
side who managed to rise above
this nightmare is composer and
musical director John
Aschenbrenner. His music was
clean, very pleasant, and highly
appropriate, not to mention the
way it sustained some of the
slowest moments in the show.
A prudent and humanitarian
policy to use as a guide for casting
student actors in anything to be
seen by anyone but their parents
was expressed by a high school
acting coach who once said," I
will never put you on the stage to
embarrass yourself." Obviously,
this was of no concern to
Johnson, because he cast an
actress in the all important role of
