# Peckinpah Directs Another Gory Film
## 
### ROBERT SHERWOOD 
PA T GARRETT AND BILL Y THE KID
Directed by Sam Peckinpah
Screenplay by Rudolf Wurlitzer
Sam Peckinpah's "Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid" is yet another
oppressive and bloody western that makes the usual statements about
fading frontiers, comradeship and machismo. James Coburn stars as
Pat Garrett, a desperado turned lawman who vows to kill his one-time
best friend, Billy the Kid.
Kris Kristofferson plays Billy, whose past is not made known in the
film although it apparently marks him for an early grave. He breaks
out of jail on the day before he is to hang in Lincoln, Nebraska, and is
in no time at all back on prowl in the territory of New Mexico.
Eventually he is hunted down and killed, to no one's surprise in either
the film or the audience.
Bob Dylan makes a cameo appearance in the film which amounts
to about ten lines of dialogue and five minutes of screen itme. His
presence is deliberately enigmatic, and his role so minor that one
seriously wonders why he decided to be in the film at all. He also sings
the theme song which, although clearly Dylanesque, is at best
mediocre.
Bloody Revels
The simplest thing to say about the film is that everyone, except
Garrett and Dylan, will be shot dead in a matter of time. Like its
predecessor, "The Wild Bunch," this film revels in bloody scenes of
bodies being shot through by revolver rounds and shotgun shells.
As if to set the tone of the film, the opening scene is of Billy's gang
shooting the heads off buried chickens, whose heads we see exploding
in slow-motion closeups.
Novelist Rudolf Wurlitzer, who also did the script to "Two-Lane
Blacktop," wrote the pretentious screenplay to this movie, whose
dialogue is an explicit parody of any of the poorest westerns. The
scope of the film is pretty much defined by exchanges such as when
Coburn warns his friend that "It feels like times have changed."
"Times," says Billy, "not me."
Confused Editing
The editing of the film was done by no less than six men, and the
result is classic film confusion. Billy jumps from Nebraska to New
Mexico in a single shot of him on the road. Things are so out-of-order
that there appears to be no relationship between how a man aims his
gun and who he hits.
As revealed in "Straw Dogs," ex-marine Sam Peckinpah strongly
believes that one can become a true man through initiation into
violence. He seems to be saying that the psychopathic murderers who
slaughter each other for no apparent reason in "Pat Garrett and Billy
the Kid" are America's true heroes. His vision is no higher than that of
the "Get Whitey" films like "Shaft" and "Superfly."
Why Bob Dylan had any part in this distressing melodrama is a
good question. His only good line is when he is asked who he is and he
replies, "That's a good question." At one point in the film he throws a
knife through a man's neck and raises his thumb in a gesture of
triumph. I never thought that the times were a-changing to this.
