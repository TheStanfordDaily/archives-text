KEEP THE DREAM AUVE
RCA Records
On January 15, 1973, a crowd
of nearly 13,000 people attended
a benefit concert in Atlanta to
commemorate the 44th birthday
anniversary of Martin Luther
King. The music, like the event
itself, was quite memorable.
RCA's two-record album,
"Keep the Dream Alive,"
captures the highlights of this
concert, featuring performances
by Jose Feliciano, The Friends of
Distinction, The Jimmy Castor
Bunch, The Main Ingredient,
Wilson Pickett, and even Flip
Wilson.
Since most of the songs on the
album are not new, you know
whether you like them, and you
know whether J. you like the
groups. This review does what the
front and back of the album fail
to — tell you who sings what.
Linda Hopkins the least known
of the performers, performs well a
la Aretha Franklin in two soul
numbers: "Precious Lord" and
"It's My Belief."
But the highlight of side one is
the polished medley of hits which
the Friends of Distinction
perform. It covers their hit songs
from "Love or Let Me Be
Lonely," "Going in Circles,"
"Time Waits for No One," and
ends with "Grazing in the Grass,"
based on Hugh Masakala's
instrumental work.
Bunch Dominates
The Jimmy Castor Bunch
dominates most of side two. Most
of you will remember the Bunch
by a big AM hit months ago
(though you're probably still
trying hard to forget it— called
"Troglodyte").
Fans who liked "Troglodyte"
will love "Hey Leroy," which is
about as indescribable as the first.
But the Bunch shows musical
talent in its instrumental version
of "The First Time Ever I Saw
Your Face," led by a gifted
saxophonist. The group also
proves it can sing when the slow

things down . for "Betcha by
Golly, Wow."
The main ingredient of side
three is The Main Ingredient. It
might be hard for anyone to think
that Bread's song "Make it With
You" could be slowed down
without losing its original appeal,
but the Ingredient manages to do
so quite gracefully.
Their fine harmonies are
highlighted in this song. After
speeding things up for "Work to
Do," they slow it all down again
for a medley of their hits:
"You've Been My Inspiration,"
"Spinning Around (I Must be
Falling in Love)," "I'm so Proud,"
and "Everybody Plays the Fool."
The only non-black performer
in the concert is Jose Feliciano,
who starts out side four. His first
song, Bill Withers' "Ain't No

Sunshine," shows how he can
make old songs work in new ways
as he did for "California
Dreaming" and "Light My Fire."
His gifted talent as a guitarist
shows through on an instrumental
version of "We've Only Just
Begun," though one might
wonder if the song would have
been even better if he had sung,
also. His final song is a passable
version of Santana's "Oye Como
Va."
Finishing off the album is one
of the kings of soul music, Wilson
Pickett. He's been around a long,
long time, getting his first big hit
in 1963 and later on cashed in on
"Mustang Sally" and "In the
Midnight Hour."
He proves that he is still a
powerful performer as he romps
through two songs, "Don't Knock

My Love — Part 1 and 2" and
"Don't Let the Green Grass Fool
You."
The quality of the recordings
are quite good, but in many ways
it's more than just a recording. It
marks an effort by the record
industry which in Mrs. King's
words, has not only advanced the
cause of human justice and
brotherhood . . . but has provided
a glowing example of social
responsibility for other business
concerns."
So you might like the record
not only for what it sounds like,
but also for what it stands for.
And it does sound good. It has a
real good beat, and you can dance
to it, except for the comedy
routine, and I'd give it an 85. And
if I didn't already have it, I think
I'd buy it.
