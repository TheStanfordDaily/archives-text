# SCIRE Director's Dismissal Upheld By Provost Miller
## 
### JAMES LOBSENZ 
Provost William F. Miller Thursday
denied SCIRE (Student Center for
Innovation and Research in
Education) Director W. Ron Jones'
grievance and found that Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James Gibbs
was acting appropriately in denying
Jones a new contract.
Jones now intends to obtain
outside arbitration of his grievance.
The SCIRE director was notified
this spring that he would not be

offered another one year contract, due
to his alleged inability to meet certain
administrative requirements. He then
submitted a request to the Department
of Personnel and Employee Relations
for a grievance hearing.
Emil Sarpa, the director of the
Department of Personnel and
Employee Relations, has forwarded a
request for an outside arbitration in
the Jones dispute to the President's
office.
Jones maintained that as SCIRE

director he was responsible only to the
SCIRE Policy Board and that his
contract renewal was a matter for
negotiation between himself and the
board.
Unanimous Support
Policy Board members unanimously
gave their support to Jones. After
Gibbs notified Jones that he would
not be rehired, the board voted to
sever all ties with the University.
The faculty-student Policy Board
has discussed the option of setting up
an independent SCIRE program,
unaffiliated with the University.
Jones, in response to Miller's
action, has urged the Policy Board to
reaffiliate with the University, and to
endeavor to work with Dean Gibbs
and his staff to the best of their
ability.
In a letter to the Policy Board
Jones stated that "regardless of what
happens in terms of my role as SCIRE
director, it's important that SCIRE
continue at Stanford. It is not easy to
face the prospect of working with the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies, but I
think this is the only course, if the
educational philosophy of SCIRE is to
survive."
'Sneaky Hunch'
Jones stated another reason he
wants the SCIRE Policy Board not to
resign is that he has a "sneaky hunch
that an outside hearing officer will be
somewhat appalled by the failure of
the Dean's office to provide me or the
Board with a formal list of deficiencies
and a time period in which
improvement could be recorded."
"I would hate to be reinstated as
the director of SCIRE only to find a
policy board in absentia," Jones
remarked.

Miller, in denying Jones' grievance
hearing, quoted Jones' letter of
appointment, stating that Jones had
misinterpreted the letter.
'Willingness to Serve'
The letter from Gibbs to Jones
reads in part: "Although your
appointment is for one year, I note
your willingness to serve for two years,
if at the end of this year, you and the
Policy Board mutually agree that this
would be desirable."
Miller asserted that Jones has
misconstrued this sentence to be a
commitment for a definite two-year
appointment provided the Policy
Board and Jones agreed. The sentence
was intended to be "an
acknowledgement of the fact that you
[ Jones] had indicated your willingness
to serve for two years," Miller ruled.
The Provost held that since

"availability" is an important factor in
the consideration of filling
administrative positions, it was "quite
reasonable and appropriate" for Gibbs
to make this acknowledgement.
Miller dismissed the "other issues"
Jones raised in the petition as
"inapposite" since Jones as SCIRE
director will end at the end of this
month.
'Conflict of Authority'
Jones commented that he was most
upset by Miller's refusal to take up the
issue of a "conflict of authority"
between SCIRE and the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies.
The provost, by "ignoring the
history, purpose and educational
characteristics of SCIRE," has "given
silent credence to the premise that
control of education rests not with
faculty and students, but with
appointed administrative officers,"
Jones claimed.

unaffiliated with the University.
Jones, in response to Miller's
action, has urged the Policy Board to
reaffiliate with the University, and to
endeavor to work with Dean Gibbs
and his staff to the best of their
ability.
In a letter to the Policy Board
Jones stated that "regardless of what
happens in terms of my role as SCIRE
director, it's important that SCIRE
continue at Stanford. It is not easy to
face the prospect of working with the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies, but I
think this is the only course, if the
educational philosophy of SCIRE is to
survive."
'Sneaky Hunch'
Jones stated another reason he
wants the SCIRE Policy Board not to
resign is that he has a "sneaky hunch
that an outside hearing officer will be
somewhat appalled by the failure of
the Dean's office to provide me or the
Board with a formal list of deficiencies
and a time period in which
improvement could be recorded."
"I would hate to be reinstated as
the director of SCIRE only to find a
policy board in absentia," Jones
remarked.

Miller, in denying Jones' grievance
hearing, quoted Jones' letter of
appointment, stating that Jones had
misinterpreted the letter.
'Willingness to Serve'
The letter from Gibbs to Jones
reads in part: "Although your
appointment is for one year, I note
your willingness to serve for two years,
if at the end of this year, you and the
Policy Board mutually agree that this
would be desirable."
Miller asserted that Jones has
misconstrued this sentence to be a
commitment for a definite two-year
appointment provided the Policy
Board and Jones agreed. The sentence
was intended to be "an
acknowledgement of the fact that you
[ Jones] had indicated your willingness
to serve for two years," Miller ruled.
The Provost held that since

"availability" is an important factor in
the consideration of filling
administrative positions, it was "quite
reasonable and appropriate" for Gibbs
to make this acknowledgement.
Miller dismissed the "other issues"
Jones raised in the petition as
"inapposite" since Jones as SCIRE
director will end at the end of this
month.
'Conflict of Authority'
Jones commented that he was most
upset by Miller's refusal to take up the
issue of a "conflict of authority"
between SCIRE and the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies.
The provost, by "ignoring the
history, purpose and educational
characteristics of SCIRE," has "given
silent credence to the premise that
control of education rests not with
faculty and students, but with
appointed administrative officers,"
Jones claimed.
Provost William F. Miller Thursday
denied SCIRE (Student Center for
Innovation and Research in
Education) Director W. Ron Jones'
grievance and found that Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James Gibbs
was acting appropriately in denying
Jones a new contract.
Jones now intends to obtain
outside arbitration of his grievance.
The SCIRE director was notified
this spring that he would not be

offered another one year contract, due
to his alleged inability to meet certain
administrative requirements. He then
submitted a request to the Department
of Personnel and Employee Relations
for a grievance hearing.
Emil Sarpa, the director of the
Department of Personnel and
Employee Relations, has forwarded a
request for an outside arbitration in
the Jones dispute to the President's
office.
Jones maintained that as SCIRE

director he was responsible only to the
SCIRE Policy Board and that his
contract renewal was a matter for
negotiation between himself and the
board.
Unanimous Support
Policy Board members unanimously
gave their support to Jones. After
Gibbs notified Jones that he would
not be rehired, the board voted to
sever all ties with the University.
The faculty-student Policy Board
has discussed the option of setting up
an independent SCIRE program,
unaffiliated with the University.
Jones, in response to Miller's
action, has urged the Policy Board to
reaffiliate with the University, and to
endeavor to work with Dean Gibbs
and his staff to the best of their
