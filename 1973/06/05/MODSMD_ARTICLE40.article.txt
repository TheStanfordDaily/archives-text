# Joffrey Concludes Series Of Eight Modern Ballets
## 
### RUST EDDIE 
Since its first Bay Area
appearances at the Stanford
Summer Festivals from 1967
through 1969, City Center Joffrey
Ballet has chartered a stellar
course.
Shifting from Memorial
Auditorium to the San Francisco
Opera House with two summers in
Berkeley's Zellerbach Auditorium
sandwiched in between testify as
much to Joffrey's ability as
Stanford's foresight.
The Joffrey Ballet, which last
weekend concluded its week-long
San Francisco engagement, is
remarkable in fusing genius from
the art, dance, literary, music, yes,
even fashion worlds together in a
tour-de-force.
Picasso, Arpino, Massine,
Tharp, Cocteau, Satie, Strauss, the
Beach Boys, Joe Eula and Scott
Barrie contribute to this

lopsi dedly 20th century
production.
As one critic put it, "Six of the
eight ballets offered are new
works and neither of the other
two is 'Swan Lake.' "
'Chain Dance'
The opening work on opening
night at the Opera House was
Arpino's "Kettentanz."
Translated, "Kattentanz" means
"chain dance" and true to form,
the piece, performed to music by
Johann Strauss, Sr., begins and
ends identically with a gypsy
gallop.
Eula's admirably restrained
costumes for this delicious,
cotton-candy confection of
Viennese court bal's underscore a
timeless appeal — classic yet fresh
enough to draw an enthusiastic
response when they were
premiered two summers ago by
the Joffrey at Zellerbach
Auditorium in Berkeley and again
last week at the Opera House.
"Parade"
The evening's second work,
"Parade," was the French name
given to the efforts of fairground
performers to lure the audience
into their booths.
In its West Coast premiere,
"Parade" posthumously
acknowledges Picasso's first stage
designs and the first appearance of
cubism on stage.
"Parade," the first and greatest
Dada ballet, was created in 1917
for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes.
Picasso (sets and costumes),
Cocteau (scenario) — the "enfant
terrible" of the Paris literary
world, Satie (music) — a member
of the "French Six," and Massine,
the sole living collaborator among
the four, who supervised the
Joffrey production.
Seldom Performed
The Joffrey production is only
the second ever outside
Diaghilev's Ballets Russes —
Massine staged it for Maurice
Bejart in 1962.
When asked why it had so few
performances, Draghilev is said to
have replied, "It is one of the best
bottles in my cellar and I don't
want to shake it up too often."
Guillaume Apollinaire writing
the program notes for the Paris
premiere hailed the ballet as
"achieving for the first time that
combination of painting and
dance, sculpture and mime, which
is the unmistakable sign of the

advent of a more complete form
of art." Apollinaire even coined a
new critical term for this creative
approach — sur-realisme.
Circus Story
Cocteau's story is simple.
Outside a fairground tent, a
Chinese conjurer, two acrobats, a
little American girl, two managers
and a dancing horse alternately
induce the public to enter.
All efforts fail to lure them
inside, Except for Massine's
choreography for his role as the
Chinese Conjurer, nothing rivals
Picasso's sets and costumes.
Picasso's towering successes are
his costumes for the New York
Manager and the French Manager
in Evening Dress.
Cubist Sculpture
These cardboard, 10 feet tall,
Cubist sculptures worn by dancers
serve as parodies of
commercialism on both
continents.
The managers and the Horse's
costumes were reconstructed,
incidentally, by Kermit Love, who
created Big Bird for "Sesame
Street."
Massine, who supervised the
Joffrey production which
duplicates his "Parade" 56 years
latter, declared unequivocally that
the new one is better than the
original.
Modern Finale
"Deuce Coupe," the final
ballet on the program was danced
to songs by the Beach Boys.
Serving as a reminder of another
era, the '60s, Twyla Tharp
choreographed the work fittingly
costumed by Scott Barrie.
As Miss Tharp says, "Growing
up isn't all that terrific, and
'Deuce Coupe' is about growing
up, about being a teenager — in
any era."
By juxtaposing a dancer in tutu
demonstrating the vocabulary of
classical ballet in dictionary order
to a mob whose dancing seems
undirected suggests the polar
irreconcilabilities of
Establishment and Counter
Culture youth options.
Seven kids from Mission High
School — students of Ruth Asawa
— attacked three rollers of white
doth stretched from floor to
ceiling with spray paint.
Through graffiti we learn that
these options are raised in the
streets. Where they are decided
wasn't clear from Tharp's ballet.

Johann Strauss, Sr., begins and
ends identically with a gypsy
gallop.
Eula's admirably restrained
costumes for this delicious,
cotton-candy confection of
Viennese court bal's underscore a
timeless appeal — classic yet fresh
enough to draw an enthusiastic
response when they were
premiered two summers ago by
the Joffrey at Zellerbach
Auditorium in Berkeley and again
last week at the Opera House.
"Parade"
The evening's second work,
"Parade," was the French name
given to the efforts of fairground
performers to lure the audience
into their booths.
In its West Coast premiere,
"Parade" posthumously
acknowledges Picasso's first stage
designs and the first appearance of
cubism on stage.
"Parade," the first and greatest
Dada ballet, was created in 1917
for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes.
Picasso (sets and costumes),
Cocteau (scenario) — the "enfant
terrible" of the Paris literary
world, Satie (music) — a member
of the "French Six," and Massine,
the sole living collaborator among
the four, who supervised the
Joffrey production.
Seldom Performed
The Joffrey production is only
the second ever outside
Diaghilev's Ballets Russes —
Massine staged it for Maurice
Bejart in 1962.
When asked why it had so few
performances, Draghilev is said to
have replied, "It is one of the best
bottles in my cellar and I don't
want to shake it up too often."
Guillaume Apollinaire writing
the program notes for the Paris
premiere hailed the ballet as
"achieving for the first time that
combination of painting and
dance, sculpture and mime, which
is the unmistakable sign of the

advent of a more complete form
of art." Apollinaire even coined a
new critical term for this creative
approach — sur-realisme.
Circus Story
Cocteau's story is simple.
Outside a fairground tent, a
Chinese conjurer, two acrobats, a
little American girl, two managers
and a dancing horse alternately
induce the public to enter.
All efforts fail to lure them
inside, Except for Massine's
choreography for his role as the
Chinese Conjurer, nothing rivals
Picasso's sets and costumes.
Picasso's towering successes are
his costumes for the New York
Manager and the French Manager
in Evening Dress.
Cubist Sculpture
These cardboard, 10 feet tall,
Cubist sculptures worn by dancers
serve as parodies of
commercialism on both
continents.
The managers and the Horse's
costumes were reconstructed,
incidentally, by Kermit Love, who
created Big Bird for "Sesame
Street."
Massine, who supervised the
Joffrey production which
duplicates his "Parade" 56 years
latter, declared unequivocally that
the new one is better than the
original.
Modern Finale
"Deuce Coupe," the final
ballet on the program was danced
to songs by the Beach Boys.
Serving as a reminder of another
era, the '60s, Twyla Tharp
choreographed the work fittingly
costumed by Scott Barrie.
As Miss Tharp says, "Growing
up isn't all that terrific, and
'Deuce Coupe' is about growing
up, about being a teenager — in
any era."
By juxtaposing a dancer in tutu
demonstrating the vocabulary of
classical ballet in dictionary order
to a mob whose dancing seems
undirected suggests the polar
irreconcilabilities of
Establishment and Counter
Culture youth options.
Seven kids from Mission High
School — students of Ruth Asawa
— attacked three rollers of white
doth stretched from floor to
ceiling with spray paint.
Through graffiti we learn that
these options are raised in the
streets. Where they are decided
wasn't clear from Tharp's ballet.
Since its first Bay Area
appearances at the Stanford
Summer Festivals from 1967
through 1969, City Center Joffrey
Ballet has chartered a stellar
course.
Shifting from Memorial
Auditorium to the San Francisco
Opera House with two summers in
Berkeley's Zellerbach Auditorium
sandwiched in between testify as
much to Joffrey's ability as
Stanford's foresight.
The Joffrey Ballet, which last
weekend concluded its week-long
San Francisco engagement, is
remarkable in fusing genius from
the art, dance, literary, music, yes,
even fashion worlds together in a
tour-de-force.
Picasso, Arpino, Massine,
Tharp, Cocteau, Satie, Strauss, the
Beach Boys, Joe Eula and Scott
Barrie contribute to this

lopsi dedly 20th century
production.
As one critic put it, "Six of the
eight ballets offered are new
works and neither of the other
two is 'Swan Lake.' "
'Chain Dance'
The opening work on opening
night at the Opera House was
Arpino's "Kettentanz."
Translated, "Kattentanz" means
"chain dance" and true to form,
the piece, performed to music by
Johann Strauss, Sr., begins and
ends identically with a gypsy
gallop.

Massine staged it for Maurice
Bejart in 1962.
When asked why it had so few
performances, Draghilev is said to
have replied, "It is one of the best
bottles in my cellar and I don't
want to shake it up too often."
Guillaume Apollinaire writing
the program notes for the Paris
premiere hailed the ballet as
"achieving for the first time that
combination of painting and
dance, sculpture and mime, which
is the unmistakable sign of the

advent of a more complete form
of art." Apollinaire even coined a
new critical term for this creative
approach — sur-realisme.
Circus Story
Cocteau's story is simple.
Outside a fairground tent, a
Chinese conjurer, two acrobats, a
little American girl, two managers
and a dancing horse alternately
induce the public to enter.
All efforts fail to lure them
inside, Except for Massine's
choreography for his role as the
Chinese Conjurer, nothing rivals
Picasso's sets and costumes.
Picasso's towering successes are
his costumes for the New York
Manager and the French Manager
in Evening Dress.
Cubist Sculpture
These cardboard, 10 feet tall,
Cubist sculptures worn by dancers
serve as parodies of
commercialism on both
continents.
The managers and the Horse's
costumes were reconstructed,
incidentally, by Kermit Love, who
created Big Bird for "Sesame
Street."
Massine, who supervised the
Joffrey production which
duplicates his "Parade" 56 years
latter, declared unequivocally that
the new one is better than the
original.
Modern Finale
"Deuce Coupe," the final
ballet on the program was danced
to songs by the Beach Boys.
Serving as a reminder of another
era, the '60s, Twyla Tharp
choreographed the work fittingly
costumed by Scott Barrie.
As Miss Tharp says, "Growing
up isn't all that terrific, and
'Deuce Coupe' is about growing
up, about being a teenager — in
any era."
By juxtaposing a dancer in tutu
demonstrating the vocabulary of
classical ballet in dictionary order
to a mob whose dancing seems
undirected suggests the polar
irreconcilabilities of
Establishment and Counter
Culture youth options.
Seven kids from Mission High
School — students of Ruth Asawa
— attacked three rollers of white
doth stretched from floor to
ceiling with spray paint.
Through graffiti we learn that
these options are raised in the
streets. Where they are decided
wasn't clear from Tharp's ballet.
Since its first Bay Area
appearances at the Stanford
Summer Festivals from 1967
through 1969, City Center Joffrey
Ballet has chartered a stellar
course.
Shifting from Memorial
Auditorium to the San Francisco
Opera House with two summers in
Berkeley's Zellerbach Auditorium
sandwiched in between testify as
much to Joffrey's ability as
Stanford's foresight.
The Joffrey Ballet, which last
weekend concluded its week-long
San Francisco engagement, is
remarkable in fusing genius from
the art, dance, literary, music, yes,
even fashion worlds together in a
tour-de-force.
Picasso, Arpino, Massine,
Tharp, Cocteau, Satie, Strauss, the
Beach Boys, Joe Eula and Scott
Barrie contribute to this

lopsi dedly 20th century
production.
As one critic put it, "Six of the
eight ballets offered are new
works and neither of the other
two is 'Swan Lake.' "
'Chain Dance'
The opening work on opening
night at the Opera House was
Arpino's "Kettentanz."
Translated, "Kattentanz" means
"chain dance" and true to form,
the piece, performed to music by
Johann Strauss, Sr., begins and
ends identically with a gypsy
gallop.
Eula's admirably restrained
costumes for this delicious,
cotton-candy confection of
Viennese court bal's underscore a
timeless appeal — classic yet fresh
enough to draw an enthusiastic
response when they were
premiered two summers ago by
the Joffrey at Zellerbach
Auditorium in Berkeley and again
last week at the Opera House.
"Parade"
The evening's second work,
"Parade," was the French name
given to the efforts of fairground
performers to lure the audience
into their booths.
In its West Coast premiere,
"Parade" posthumously
acknowledges Picasso's first stage
designs and the first appearance of
cubism on stage.
"Parade," the first and greatest
Dada ballet, was created in 1917
for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes.
Picasso (sets and costumes),
Cocteau (scenario) — the "enfant
terrible" of the Paris literary
world, Satie (music) — a member
of the "French Six," and Massine,
the sole living collaborator among
the four, who supervised the
Joffrey production.
Seldom Performed
The Joffrey production is only
the second ever outside
Diaghilev's Ballets Russes —
Massine staged it for Maurice
Bejart in 1962.
When asked why it had so few
performances, Draghilev is said to
have replied, "It is one of the best
