I first discovered Kurt Vonnegut in high school. At the time, he
was already becoming quite well-known on college campuses,
although his fame had not yet spread to Santa Rosa, Calif. For a long
time, I would expound at great length to my friends about this
neurotic but brilliant writer none of them had ever heard of.
Vonnegut is no longer unknown — anywhere. He has been featured
in national magazines. His last play was produced on national
television. He is a poster/cult hero figure. And his latest novel,
Breakfast of Champions, is the number-one best-seller in the Bay
Area. Which is too bad, because I think success has spoiled Kurt
Vonnegut.
Breakfast of Champions has two major characters, Dwayne Hoover,
a Pontiac dealer with "bad chemicals" inside him that are driving him
insane, and Kilgore Trout, the unknown science fiction writer who has
popped up in a number of Vonnegut works.
When Dwayne and Trout meet, we are told early in the book,
Dwayne's bad chemicals will drive him beserk. The rest of the book is
spent waiting for the two to meet.
Sure, there's a lot more here — but little of any substance. The few
glimpses of the old Vonnegut we knew and loved occur here in the
synopses of several Kilgore Trout books; for example, one book is
written in the form of a letter from the Creator of the Universe to the
reader, informing him that he is the only creature in the world who
has free will.
Also missing from Breakfast of Champions is that sense of outrage
lurking beneath the surface of Vonnegut's last and most popular novel
to date, Slaughterhouse-5. Here, that outrage is replaced by a sense of
weariness.
Vonnegut uses the occasion of his fiftieth birthday to literally free
the characters such as Trout and Eliot Rosewater who have seen him
through most of his works.
Perhaps this presages a new direction for the author; perhaps only a
retrenchment. In any event, Breakfast of Champions is an unsatisfying
end to this cycle of Vonnegut's work.
