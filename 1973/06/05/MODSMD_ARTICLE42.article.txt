# 'Last Ten Days' Recreates Incredible Hitler Phenomenon
## 
### JON R. KENNEDY 
"Hitler, The Last Ten Days"
brings to the screen the historical
recounting of the death of the
Third Reich dictator as it was first
pieced together by British
historian H.R. Trevor-Roper and
later confirmed by eyewitnesses
who had been with Hitler in his
death chamber and by the
Russians who captured the bunker
on taking Berlin at the Close of
World War 11.
It is hardly controversial now,
but up until a decade ago many
still refused to accept Hitler's
death and continued to argue that
he had been seen — many times —
in Argentina where he'd escaped
to plot his return.
Today Juan Peron has made
good on his long-anticipated
comeback, but since the Russian
release of evidence proving
Hitler's death there is no longer
any serious speculation that he
might have survived. This film
depicts how he died in an
underground concrete bunker in
the heart of the bombed-out city
of Berlin of suicide by cyanide
poisoning.
It is a film of historical
significance although it contrasts
with such other movies on the era
as "Cabaret" and"The Damned."
They show a Germany which

went from decadence to utter
depravity.
Moralistic Maniac
"Hitler, The Last Ten Days"
shows the Fuhrer to be a
moralistic maniac who justified
the slaughter of millions of his
countrymen to keep himself alive
for two years after he knew
Germany would not win the war,
but who considered Franklin
Roosevelt a madman for smoking
cigarettes. His most fanatical
followers found it incredible to
learn that he had a mistress,
thinking him "above sex," so
puritanical was the inner circle
around Hitler.
The film's main point is that
Hitler was a product of the
super-humanist philosophy of
Nietzsche which dominated the
first third of this century,
especially in Germany where
philosophy is serious business.
"Law and order" was the theme
Hitler used to rally the united
support of the German people in
the early days of his National
Socialist movement.
He promised peace within the
strife-ridden post-war republic and
as his leadership lifted the spirits
of the national and his programs
promised prosperity, he was able
to win an incredible majority of
popular support.

Hitler, brilliantly characterized
by Alec Guinness in the British
production is shown advising his
military strategists that the triumph
of the will can save Berlin if only
one regiment of the army is able
to meet the Russians. He tells how
his movement grew from less than
200 to totalitarian proportions
and how he mapped the conquests
of Europe despite never having
attended a military academy.
Lavish Self-Praise
At times his self-praise is so
lavish and ludicrous that it
becomes unbelievable. He speaks
of sacrificing himself and his first
love, art, for the sake of Germany,
and observes in the light of the
country's defeat that "the
German people didn't deserve me,
they are too weak-willed to win —
maybe the British would have
done better by me; they have
more determination."
He boasts of his genius and
before taking the cyanide capsule
insists that his photographic
portraits be carefully preserved:
"I wouldn't want to have what
happened to Jesus Christ,
everyone forgetting what I really
looked like." But he
acknowledged that those who
looked to him as their Messiah
were wrong; he had not come to
save them from their sins.

In all, the film depicts a
madman obsessed with power,
hatred for those who threatened
his hold over the German masses,
and paranoid about the loyalty of
everyone he trusted, even those
with him in the bunker at the end.
He advises a mother who is
present with her six children that
giving them each a cyanide
capsule will prove wiser than
letting them grow up in a world
without him, and he deploys the
14-to-18-year-old Hitler Youth to
man the bridges into Berlin
against the Russian and allied

onslaught.
But we also see him joking
with the companions he enjoys,
celebrating his birthday, getting
married just before his impending
suicide apparently because he
didn't want his people thinking
that he condoned the breakdown
of the family, a point also stressed
early in the dialogue.
The film received some
controversial criticism in Europe
because of this "good side" of
Hitler, although without it it
wouldn't be possible to see how
anyone could have followed him

in the first place much less to the
holocaust which destroyed much
of Europe as the result of his
"struggle."
It is too early to write a
comprehensive history of the era,
to analyze what factors produced
its events and counter-events. Just
how important were the early
faith in science and technology,
the belief that man was evolving
into superman and that a Hitler
could have been a prototype of a
new race, the transformation of
Christian theology into a rehash
of secular philosophies, and the

later apathy of existentialism with
its nihilistic despair"?
It will take many years to sift
through the data to evaluate it
with conclusiveness, and maybe
then we'll be too busy with
tomorrow's apocalypse to weigh
the results anyway.
In any case, we will need many
books — five have just been
released — plays, films, and
television specials and series to
remind us md our successors of
who Hitler was and what he
wrought in the world. It's already
hard to believe.

It is too early to write a

its events and counter-events. Just
how important were the early
faith in science and technology,
the belief that man was evolving
into superman and that a Hitler
could have been a prototype of a
new race, the transformation of
Christian theology into a rehash
of secular philosophies, and the

later apathy of existentialism with
its nihilistic despair"?
It will take many years to sift

with conclusiveness, and maybe

In any case, we will need many

hard to believe.
"Hitler, The Last Ten Days"
brings to the screen the historical
recounting of the death of the
Third Reich dictator as it was first
pieced together by British
historian H.R. Trevor-Roper and
later confirmed by eyewitnesses
who had been with Hitler in his
death chamber and by the
Russians who captured the bunker
on taking Berlin at the Close of
World War 11.
It is hardly controversial now,
but up until a decade ago many
still refused to accept Hitler's
death and continued to argue that
he had been seen — many times —
in Argentina where he'd escaped
to plot his return.
Today Juan Peron has made
good on his long-anticipated
comeback, but since the Russian
release of evidence proving
Hitler's death there is no longer
any serious speculation that he
might have survived. This film
depicts how he died in an
underground concrete bunker in
the heart of the bombed-out city
of Berlin of suicide by cyanide
poisoning.
It is a film of historical
significance although it contrasts
with such other movies on the era
as "Cabaret" and"The Damned."
They show a Germany which

went from decadence to utter
depravity.
Moralistic Maniac
"Hitler, The Last Ten Days"
shows the Fuhrer to be a
moralistic maniac who justified
the slaughter of millions of his
countrymen to keep himself alive
for two years after he knew
Germany would not win the war,
but who considered Franklin
Roosevelt a madman for smoking
cigarettes. His most fanatical
followers found it incredible to
learn that he had a mistress,
thinking him "above sex," so
puritanical was the inner circle
around Hitler.
The film's main point is that
Hitler was a product of the
super-humanist philosophy of
Nietzsche which dominated the
first third of this century,
especially in Germany where
philosophy is serious business.
"Law and order" was the theme
Hitler used to rally the united
support of the German people in
the early days of his National
Socialist movement.
He promised peace within the
strife-ridden post-war republic and
as his leadership lifted the spirits
of the national and his programs
promised prosperity, he was able
to win an incredible majority of
popular support.

Hitler, brilliantly characterized
by Alec Guinness in the British
production is shown advising his
military strategists that the triumph
of the will can save Berlin if only
one regiment of the army is able
to meet the Russians. He tells how
his movement grew from less than
200 to totalitarian proportions
and how he mapped the conquests
of Europe despite never having
attended a military academy.
Lavish Self-Praise
At times his self-praise is so
lavish and ludicrous that it
becomes unbelievable. He speaks
of sacrificing himself and his first
love, art, for the sake of Germany,
and observes in the light of the
country's defeat that "the
German people didn't deserve me,
they are too weak-willed to win —
maybe the British would have
done better by me; they have
more determination."
He boasts of his genius and
before taking the cyanide capsule
insists that his photographic
portraits be carefully preserved:
"I wouldn't want to have what
happened to Jesus Christ,
everyone forgetting what I really
looked like." But he
acknowledged that those who
looked to him as their Messiah
were wrong; he had not come to
save them from their sins.

In all, the film depicts a
madman obsessed with power,
hatred for those who threatened
his hold over the German masses,
and paranoid about the loyalty of
everyone he trusted, even those
with him in the bunker at the end.
He advises a mother who is
present with her six children that
giving them each a cyanide
capsule will prove wiser than
letting them grow up in a world
without him, and he deploys the
14-to-18-year-old Hitler Youth to
man the bridges into Berlin
against the Russian and allied

onslaught.
But we also see him joking
with the companions he enjoys,
celebrating his birthday, getting
married just before his impending
suicide apparently because he
didn't want his people thinking
that he condoned the breakdown
of the family, a point also stressed
early in the dialogue.
The film received some
controversial criticism in Europe
because of this "good side" of
Hitler, although without it it
wouldn't be possible to see how
anyone could have followed him

in the first place much less to the
holocaust which destroyed much
of Europe as the result of his
"struggle."

everyone he trusted, even those
with him in the bunker at the end.
He advises a mother who is
present with her six children that
giving them each a cyanide
capsule will prove wiser than
letting them grow up in a world
without him, and he deploys the
14-to-18-year-old Hitler Youth to
man the bridges into Berlin
against the Russian and allied

onslaught.
But we also see him joking
with the companions he enjoys,
celebrating his birthday, getting
married just before his impending
suicide apparently because he
didn't want his people thinking
that he condoned the breakdown
of the family, a point also stressed
early in the dialogue.
The film received some
controversial criticism in Europe
because of this "good side" of
Hitler, although without it it
wouldn't be possible to see how
anyone could have followed him

in the first place much less to the
holocaust which destroyed much
of Europe as the result of his
"struggle."
It is too early to write a
comprehensive history of the era,
to analyze what factors produced
its events and counter-events. Just
how important were the early
faith in science and technology,
the belief that man was evolving
into superman and that a Hitler
could have been a prototype of a
new race, the transformation of
Christian theology into a rehash
of secular philosophies, and the

later apathy of existentialism with
its nihilistic despair"?
It will take many years to sift
through the data to evaluate it
with conclusiveness, and maybe
then we'll be too busy with
tomorrow's apocalypse to weigh
the results anyway.
In any case, we will need many
books — five have just been
released — plays, films, and
television specials and series to
remind us md our successors of
who Hitler was and what he
wrought in the world. It's already
hard to believe.
"Hitler, The Last Ten Days"
brings to the screen the historical
recounting of the death of the
Third Reich dictator as it was first
pieced together by British
historian H.R. Trevor-Roper and
later confirmed by eyewitnesses
who had been with Hitler in his
death chamber and by the
Russians who captured the bunker
on taking Berlin at the Close of
World War 11.
It is hardly controversial now,
but up until a decade ago many
still refused to accept Hitler's
death and continued to argue that
he had been seen — many times —
in Argentina where he'd escaped
to plot his return.
Today Juan Peron has made
good on his long-anticipated
comeback, but since the Russian
release of evidence proving
Hitler's death there is no longer
any serious speculation that he
might have survived. This film
depicts how he died in an
underground concrete bunker in
the heart of the bombed-out city
of Berlin of suicide by cyanide
poisoning.
It is a film of historical
significance although it contrasts
with such other movies on the era
as "Cabaret" and"The Damned."
They show a Germany which

went from decadence to utter
depravity.
Moralistic Maniac
"Hitler, The Last Ten Days"
shows the Fuhrer to be a
moralistic maniac who justified
the slaughter of millions of his
countrymen to keep himself alive
for two years after he knew
Germany would not win the war,
but who considered Franklin
Roosevelt a madman for smoking
cigarettes. His most fanatical
followers found it incredible to
learn that he had a mistress,
thinking him "above sex," so
puritanical was the inner circle
around Hitler.
The film's main point is that
Hitler was a product of the
super-humanist philosophy of
Nietzsche which dominated the
first third of this century,
especially in Germany where
philosophy is serious business.
"Law and order" was the theme
Hitler used to rally the united
support of the German people in
the early days of his National
Socialist movement.
He promised peace within the
strife-ridden post-war republic and
as his leadership lifted the spirits
of the national and his programs
promised prosperity, he was able
to win an incredible majority of
popular support.

Hitler, brilliantly characterized
by Alec Guinness in the British
production is shown advising his
military strategists that the triumph
of the will can save Berlin if only
one regiment of the army is able
to meet the Russians. He tells how
his movement grew from less than
200 to totalitarian proportions
and how he mapped the conquests
of Europe despite never having
attended a military academy.
Lavish Self-Praise
At times his self-praise is so
lavish and ludicrous that it
becomes unbelievable. He speaks
of sacrificing himself and his first
love, art, for the sake of Germany,
and observes in the light of the
country's defeat that "the
German people didn't deserve me,
they are too weak-willed to win —
maybe the British would have
done better by me; they have
more determination."
He boasts of his genius and
before taking the cyanide capsule
insists that his photographic
portraits be carefully preserved:
"I wouldn't want to have what
happened to Jesus Christ,
everyone forgetting what I really
looked like." But he
acknowledged that those who
looked to him as their Messiah
were wrong; he had not come to
save them from their sins.

In all, the film depicts a
madman obsessed with power,
hatred for those who threatened
his hold over the German masses,
and paranoid about the loyalty of
everyone he trusted, even those
with him in the bunker at the end.
He advises a mother who is
present with her six children that
giving them each a cyanide
