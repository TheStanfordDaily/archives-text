# Savoyards Perform In Successful Rendition Of 'Pirates Of Penzanceâ€™
## 
### DAN KRAVETZ 
Gilbert and Sullivan are alive and well at
Stanford University, as anyone who has gone
by Dinkelspiel Auditorium during the past
three evenings can testify.
Some of the biggest crowds in recent
musical history at Stanford have welcomed
this weekend's production of "The Pirates of
Penzance," one of the more popular efforts of
the great Victorian comic-opera team of W.S.
Gilbert and Arthur Sullivan. The show was a
rousing success here, as it has been all over the
globe in the 93 years since its premiere.
This was the first production of a new
campus performing group, the Stanford
Savoyards, who emerged from a series of
informal meetings last February to become a
fully operative student-run organization under
joint sponsorship of ASSU and SCIRE.
Despite some initial opposition from power
circles in the Music Department, the

Savoyards should soon become one of
Stanford's most cherished institutions.
Much of the success of this weekend's
production is due to the superb stagecraft of
director Armand Gilinsky, a sophomore from
Scarborough, N.Y. Some brilliant modern
comic touches, mixed with the enchanting
spirit of satire and irreverence in Gilbert's and
Sullivan's work, neatly bridged the gap
between London and Palo Alto.
Melinda Atkins, a veteran of several
Stanford Opera Theater productions, and
Marshall Watson were charmingly naive as the
young lovers who think more of their morals
than of each other. Atkins contributed what
must be one of the longest and dullest
operatic cadenzas in the repertoire with a
style that would have capitvated Sir William
and Sir Arthur themselves.
Brian Jones, as the leader of the band of
pirates which turns out to be the House of

Lords playing hooky, dominated his scenes
with swagger and style. His reflection on
piracy, "Contrasted with respectability, it is
comparatively honest," nearly brought the
house down.
As the "model of a modern
Major-General," Thomas Saterlee delivered his
demanding patter numbers with skill,
although there must be some other ways to
perform this character than as an aged,
twittering fop. Lloyd Loom and Ella Asbury
gave rugged interpretations of the police
sergeant and Pirate Maid-of-all-work, with just
the right measure of British wit.
The chorus, trained by Joseph Haletky,
sang beautifully and with no lack of spirit.
Conductor Daniel Robinson and his
ill-prepared orchestra seemed woefully
inadequate for the high-quality efforts of the
singers and actors on the stage.

rousing success here, as it has been all over the
globe in the 93 years since its premiere.
This was the first production of a new
campus performing group, the Stanford
Savoyards, who emerged from a series of
informal meetings last February to become a
fully operative student-run organization under
joint sponsorship of ASSU and SCIRE.
Despite some initial opposition from power
circles in the Music Department, the

Savoyards should soon become one of
Stanford's most cherished institutions.
Much of the success of this weekend's
production is due to the superb stagecraft of
director Armand Gilinsky, a sophomore from
Scarborough, N.Y. Some brilliant modern
comic touches, mixed with the enchanting
spirit of satire and irreverence in Gilbert's and
Sullivan's work, neatly bridged the gap
between London and Palo Alto.
Melinda Atkins, a veteran of several
Stanford Opera Theater productions, and
Marshall Watson were charmingly naive as the
young lovers who think more of their morals
than of each other. Atkins contributed what
must be one of the longest and dullest
operatic cadenzas in the repertoire with a
style that would have capitvated Sir William
and Sir Arthur themselves.
Brian Jones, as the leader of the band of
pirates which turns out to be the House of

Lords playing hooky, dominated his scenes
with swagger and style. His reflection on
piracy, "Contrasted with respectability, it is
comparatively honest," nearly brought the
house down.
As the "model of a modern
Major-General," Thomas Saterlee delivered his
demanding patter numbers with skill,
although there must be some other ways to
perform this character than as an aged,
twittering fop. Lloyd Loom and Ella Asbury
gave rugged interpretations of the police
sergeant and Pirate Maid-of-all-work, with just
the right measure of British wit.
The chorus, trained by Joseph Haletky,
sang beautifully and with no lack of spirit.
Conductor Daniel Robinson and his
ill-prepared orchestra seemed woefully
inadequate for the high-quality efforts of the
singers and actors on the stage.
