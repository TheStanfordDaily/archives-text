# Cardinals Hope To Change Golf Trend
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Stanford will be one of 34
teams trying to end Texas' two
year domination of the NCAA
golf tournament when the 1973
event begins on June 18 at
Stillwater, Okla.
Texas, paced by Ben
Crenshaw's two consecutive
individual championships, has
won the last two NCAA tourneys.
A similar finish seems likely again
this year, but at least 10 other
teams (including Stanford) are
capable of ousting the Longhorns
if the putts are dropping and not
too many golf balls stray into the
heavily wooded rough bordering
Stillwater Country Club's narrow
fairways.
Coach Bud Finger's Cardinals,
who finished second behind USC
in the Pacific Eight tournamnet
two weeks ago, will be
represented by Dave Baskins,
Conrad Nilmeier, Aly Trompas,
Denny Colvin, and John Beers.
Baskins fired a final round 64 at
the Pac-8 tourney, Nilmeier
carded a 65 and Trompas and
Beers each shot 70 as the Cards
picked up 25 shots on third round
leader Oregon State and nearly
caught the Trojans.
Added Confidence
Tht final round performance

has given Stanford some
much-needed confidence going
into the NCAA's. "I think we
might surprise some people," said
Trompas. "We have some steady
players — what we need is
someone to really be on top."
Baskins, perhaps the steadiest
of all the Cardinal golfers (so far
this year he's finished in the top
10 in five major tournaments),
agrees that Stanford could
conceivably finish in the top five
in the nation.
"We've just got to realize that
the guys from Texas, Houston,
and Florida are our peers, not our
idols," Baskins said. "We
definitely have the ability to beat
a lot of the top teams."
Stanford is one of six West
Coast teams chosen by the NCAA
selection committee to compete
in the nationals. USC, the fourth
ranked team in the nation
according to Golf World
magazine, is the most impressive
team on a list of West Coast
entrants which also includes
Stanford, Long Beach State,
Fresno State, San Jose State, and
Oregon State.
Potential Challengers
Nationally, the teams given the
best shot at upsetting the
Longhorns are Florida, Houston,
USC, Wake Forest, and host
Oklahoma State. Florida's Gary
Koch, USC's Craig Stadler,
Houston's Bill Rogers, Georgia
Southern's Jimmy Ellis, and
Danny Edwards of Oklahoma
State are among Crenshaw's
potential conquerors in the
individual competition.
The tournament is played over
72 holes, with the field trimmed
to the low 15 teams and ties at
the halfway mark. Stanford coach
Bud Finger will be looking for his
third national championship.
Finger played on the 1939 and
1941 NCAA champs and coached
the Cards to the 1953 title.
Stanford's current competitive
averages are: Beers (73.3), Baskins
(74.1), Colvin (74.3), Trompas
(74.6), and Nilmeier (75.2).

GUNNING FOR THE TlTLE—Senior Rick Fisher is one of five
Cardinal netters who will travel to Princeton, New Jersey June 18-23
in quest of Stanford's first official national championship in tennis.
USC, UCLA, and Stanford are expected to battle for the team title in
the conclusive "round five" of the year long struggle for national
tennis supremacy between the three schools.
Stanford will be one of 34
teams trying to end Texas' two
year domination of the NCAA
golf tournament when the 1973
event begins on June 18 at
Stillwater, Okla.
Texas, paced by Ben
Crenshaw's two consecutive
individual championships, has
won the last two NCAA tourneys.
A similar finish seems likely again
this year, but at least 10 other
teams (including Stanford) are
capable of ousting the Longhorns
if the putts are dropping and not
too many golf balls stray into the
heavily wooded rough bordering
Stillwater Country Club's narrow
fairways.
Coach Bud Finger's Cardinals,
who finished second behind USC
in the Pacific Eight tournamnet
two weeks ago, will be
represented by Dave Baskins,
Conrad Nilmeier, Aly Trompas,
Denny Colvin, and John Beers.
Baskins fired a final round 64 at
the Pac-8 tourney, Nilmeier
carded a 65 and Trompas and
Beers each shot 70 as the Cards
picked up 25 shots on third round
leader Oregon State and nearly
caught the Trojans.
Added Confidence
Tht final round performance

has given Stanford some
much-needed confidence going
into the NCAA's. "I think we
might surprise some people," said
Trompas. "We have some steady
players — what we need is
someone to really be on top."
Baskins, perhaps the steadiest
of all the Cardinal golfers (so far
this year he's finished in the top
10 in five major tournaments),
agrees that Stanford could
conceivably finish in the top five
in the nation.
"We've just got to realize that
the guys from Texas, Houston,
and Florida are our peers, not our
idols," Baskins said. "We
definitely have the ability to beat
a lot of the top teams."
Stanford is one of six West
Coast teams chosen by the NCAA
selection committee to compete
in the nationals. USC, the fourth
ranked team in the nation
according to Golf World
magazine, is the most impressive
team on a list of West Coast
entrants which also includes
Stanford, Long Beach State,
Fresno State, San Jose State, and
Oregon State.
Potential Challengers
Nationally, the teams given the
best shot at upsetting the
Longhorns are Florida, Houston,
USC, Wake Forest, and host
Oklahoma State. Florida's Gary
Koch, USC's Craig Stadler,
Houston's Bill Rogers, Georgia
Southern's Jimmy Ellis, and
Danny Edwards of Oklahoma
State are among Crenshaw's
potential conquerors in the
individual competition.
The tournament is played over
72 holes, with the field trimmed
to the low 15 teams and ties at
the halfway mark. Stanford coach
Bud Finger will be looking for his
third national championship.
Finger played on the 1939 and
1941 NCAA champs and coached
the Cards to the 1953 title.
Stanford's current competitive
averages are: Beers (73.3), Baskins
(74.1), Colvin (74.3), Trompas
(74.6), and Nilmeier (75.2).
