# Four Cardinals Entered
## Spikers Set For Nationals 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
The Stanford track season ends
this weekend with the 1973
NCAAA Championships at Baton
Rouge, La. Ken Curl, Terry
Albritton, Brian Mittelstaedt, and
Ken Kring will represent the Cards
in what Coach Payton Jordan calls
"the toughest meet in this
country except for the Olympic
trials."
"We're hoping to pick up a few
places," he said, "but in this meet
you can't be sure of anything.
We're taking guys who have met
the qualifying standards, have

been relatively consistent, and
have performed well under
pressure. We feel they all have a
chance of placing."
Curl will be representing
Stanford in the sprints. He has run
a 21.0 220 this year and a 9.4
wind-aided 100. Miler
Mittelstaedt's last two races have
been at 4:00.1 and 4:00.2, so he
seems destined to become the
Cards' second sub-four minute
man.
Shotputter Albritton, who has
raised the school record twice this
year, is one of the country's
leading, young weight throwers at
61-QV2. Kring took second in the
Pac-8 decathlon, and set a
Stanford pentathlon record earlier
in the season.
The team held its annual
awards banquet Sunday night. It
was attended by team members,
their families, and supporters of
the team, including many
northern California track officials.
