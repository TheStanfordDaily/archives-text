# NCAA Tourney Concludes Eventful Tennis Season
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Barring an airplane crash or
other act of God, Stanford's
tennis team will finish no worse at
the NCAA Tennis Championships
June 18-23 than it did at the
Pacific Eight championships last
month — third.
The question is whether the
Cards can beat out UCLA and
USC to finish first at the national
tournament, held this year in
Princeton, New Jersey, and thus
win the team's first official NCAA
championship.
Each team in the NCAA is
allowed to enter four singles
players and two doubles teams,
thus creating a huge, 256-player
field for the tournament which is
conducted on an individual basis.
The format is similar to the Ojai
Intercollegiates, which Stanford
won earlier this season.
Coach Dick Gould has chosen
freshman Pat DuPre, sophomore
Jim Delaney, junior Sandy Mayer,
and senior Rick Fisher to
represent his team in singles.
Doubles teams will be
Mayer-Delaney and Fisher-Gery
Groslimond. Groslimond is also a
senior.
Gould expects all four of

Stanford's USC, and UCLA's
singles players to be seeded into
the top 20.
The NCAA tournament
committee will take into account
the ratings of coaches, as well as
results from this year, in making
the crucial seedings.
West Coast Order
Gould sent in the following
order of West Coast players to the
tournament committee: Singles: 1.
Mayer, 2. Raul Ramirez, USC, 3.
Jeff Austin, UCLA, 4. Delaney, 5.
Bob Kreiss, UCLA, 6. John
Andrews, USC, 7. Fisher, 8. Steve
Krulevitz, UCLA, 9. Brian
Teacher, UCLA, 10. DuPre, 11.
Mike Machette, USC, 12. Sashi
Menon, USC.
Doubles: 1. Ramirez-Machetee,
USC, 2. Mayer-Delaney, 3.
Kreiss-Austin, UCLA, 4.
Fisher-Groslimond, 5.
Menon-Andrews, USC, 6.
Seegers-Krulevitz, UCLA.
In studying these pairings, one
can see that Gould feels that
UCLA and Stanford are stronger
than USC in singles and USC and
Stanford are stronger than UCLA
in doubles.
Teams Close
That may be why Gould says,
with but a half inch between his
thumb and forefinger, "I think
we're the best team — by that
much."
While only the three West
Coast teams have a chance at the
NCAA title, several other schools
have players who could upset a

"Big Three" player and knock
that school from contention.
Some of these players are
Victor Amaya and Fred DeJesus,
both Michigan freshmen, George
Hardi and Tim Vann of Southern
Methodist, Fred McNair of North
Carolina, Vitas Gerulaitis of
Columbia, who may play, and
Rand Evett of Arizona, who beat
Delaney earlier this year.
No Repeat Win
Last year's title-winner, Trinity
(Texas), lost its entire team, and
has no chance of doing nearly as
well this year. Stanford finished
second last season, with
Mayer-Roscoe Tanner winning the
doubles title.
Last year's Trinity victory
broke an 11-year NCAA win
streak by USC and UCLA. During
this time, Stanford never seriously
challenged for the crown.
A clipping hanging in Gould's
office from when he was hired
five years ago shows that even
then, his goal was to win the
NCAA tennis championship.
Everything the team has done
this year has been directed toward
that single goal. Winning the
National Indoor Tournament in
Madison in February, and winning
the Ojai crown in April won't
mean anything to Stanford's
coach, team, or fans, if the Cards
don't win the NCAAs.
The entire season, and maybe
the entire career of seniors Fisher
and Groslimond will be on the
line at Princeton.

don't win the NCAAs.
The entire season, and maybe
the entire career of seniors Fisher
and Groslimond will be on the
line at Princeton.
Barring an airplane crash or
other act of God, Stanford's
tennis team will finish no worse at
the NCAA Tennis Championships
June 18-23 than it did at the
Pacific Eight championships last
month — third.
The question is whether the
Cards can beat out UCLA and
USC to finish first at the national
tournament, held this year in
Princeton, New Jersey, and thus
win the team's first official NCAA
championship.
Each team in the NCAA is
allowed to enter four singles
players and two doubles teams,
thus creating a huge, 256-player
field for the tournament which is
conducted on an individual basis.
The format is similar to the Ojai
Intercollegiates, which Stanford
won earlier this season.
Coach Dick Gould has chosen
freshman Pat DuPre, sophomore
Jim Delaney, junior Sandy Mayer,
and senior Rick Fisher to
represent his team in singles.
Doubles teams will be
Mayer-Delaney and Fisher-Gery
Groslimond. Groslimond is also a
senior.
Gould expects all four of

Stanford's USC, and UCLA's
singles players to be seeded into
the top 20.
The NCAA tournament
committee will take into account
the ratings of coaches, as well as
results from this year, in making
the crucial seedings.
West Coast Order
Gould sent in the following
order of West Coast players to the
tournament committee: Singles: 1.
Mayer, 2. Raul Ramirez, USC, 3.
Jeff Austin, UCLA, 4. Delaney, 5.
Bob Kreiss, UCLA, 6. John
Andrews, USC, 7. Fisher, 8. Steve
Krulevitz, UCLA, 9. Brian
Teacher, UCLA, 10. DuPre, 11.
Mike Machette, USC, 12. Sashi
Menon, USC.
Doubles: 1. Ramirez-Machetee,
USC, 2. Mayer-Delaney, 3.
Kreiss-Austin, UCLA, 4.
Fisher-Groslimond, 5.
Menon-Andrews, USC, 6.
Seegers-Krulevitz, UCLA.
In studying these pairings, one
can see that Gould feels that
UCLA and Stanford are stronger
than USC in singles and USC and
Stanford are stronger than UCLA
in doubles.
Teams Close
That may be why Gould says,
with but a half inch between his
thumb and forefinger, "I think
we're the best team — by that
much."
While only the three West
Coast teams have a chance at the
NCAA title, several other schools
have players who could upset a

"Big Three" player and knock
that school from contention.
Some of these players are
Victor Amaya and Fred DeJesus,
both Michigan freshmen, George
Hardi and Tim Vann of Southern
Methodist, Fred McNair of North
Carolina, Vitas Gerulaitis of
Columbia, who may play, and
Rand Evett of Arizona, who beat
Delaney earlier this year.
No Repeat Win
Last year's title-winner, Trinity
(Texas), lost its entire team, and
has no chance of doing nearly as
well this year. Stanford finished
second last season, with
Mayer-Roscoe Tanner winning the
doubles title.
Last year's Trinity victory
broke an 11-year NCAA win
streak by USC and UCLA. During
this time, Stanford never seriously
challenged for the crown.
A clipping hanging in Gould's
office from when he was hired
five years ago shows that even
then, his goal was to win the
NCAA tennis championship.
Everything the team has done
this year has been directed toward
that single goal. Winning the
National Indoor Tournament in
Madison in February, and winning
the Ojai crown in April won't
mean anything to Stanford's
coach, team, or fans, if the Cards
don't win the NCAAs.
The entire season, and maybe
the entire career of seniors Fisher
and Groslimond will be on the
line at Princeton.
