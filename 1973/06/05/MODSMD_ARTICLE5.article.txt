# Beame, Badillo In N.Y. Mayoral Runoff
## 
### DAN KRAVETZ 
New York City Controller Abraham D. Beame
placed first in a four-way Democratic primary for
mayor yesterday, but failed to gather the 40 percent
of the vote needed to win the nomination.
The 67-year-old Beame will face Rep. Herman
Badillo in a runoff June 26. The winner will
probably have three opponents in the November
general election: Republican State Sen. John
Marchi; Conservative nominee Mario Biaggi, a Bronx
congressman; and Liberal primary winner Albert
Blumenthal, a state assemblyman.
Biaggi and Blumenthal placed third and fourth,
respectively, in yesterday's Democratic contest.
With 94 percent of the election districts
reporting, Beame had 250,760 votes or 34 percent;
Badillo 209,933 or 29 percent; Biaggi 151,451 or 21
percent, and Blumenthal 116,788 or 16 percent.
Biaggi was considered the front-runner until
April 18, when the New York Times reported that
Biaggi, while a witness before a grand jury
investigating immigration bills in Congress, had
taken the Fifth Amendment to 30 questions about
his personal finances.
16 Questions
After Biaggi fought unsuccessfully in court to
preserve the secrecy of his testimony, the record
revealed that he had declined to answer 16

questions involving his daughter and a number of
business associates.
The questions did not mention personal finances,
and Biaggi had apparently cited constitutional
privilege against further testimony after he was
prevented from reading a statement protesting the
line of questioning and the subpoenaing of his
daughter before the grand jury.
After the minutes of the grand jury had been
published, Conservative Party leaders and newsmen
charged that Biaggi had previously denied that he
had ever refused to answer any question before any
grand jury.
In subsequent weeks, the Bronx District
Attorney's office began a new investigation of a
1959 gun battle in which Biaggi, then a police
lieutenant, killed a robbery suspect and won his
department's Medal of Honor for his actions. Grand
jury hearings on the matter were put off until after
yesterday's election.
Financial Expertise
Beame, who lost the 1965 mayoral election to
John V. Lindsay, has the endorsement of nearly all
regular Democratic clubs in the city and of most
labor unions. He campaigned on a platform
emphasizing his financial expertise and his many
years of experience in New York City politics.
Badillo, a native of Puerto Rico, is considered to

be the most liberal of this year's mayoral
candidates. He placed third in the 1969 Democratic
primary behind Controller Mario Procaccino and
former Mayor Robert Wagner.
Wagner's name surfaced briefly again this March
as a possible Republican-Liberal candidate for
mayor with the support of Gov. Nelson Rockefeller.
When Wagner refused to run for the office he held
from 1953 to 1965, Rockefeller formally endorsed
Marchi, although political experts have placed the
governor closer to Beame, who would be expected
to maintain a low profile for the city in
Rockefeller's expected re-election campaign next
year.
'Stop Biaggi'
Liberal Party chief Alex Rose, who admitted that
his support of Wagner had been a "stop-Biaggi"
measure, later endorsed Blumenthal.
Conservative leaders are expected to attempt to
strip Biaggi of their party's nomination in the near
future, on the basis of his "lack of candor" when
confronted with anonymous reports of his gTand
jury testimony.
The nomination would presumably go to Marchi,
although present state election laws prohibit any
change. In the event of a future Consp-vative switch,
Biaggi may run on an independent ticket in
November.

candidates. He placed third in the 1969 Democratic
primary behind Controller Mario Procaccino and
former Mayor Robert Wagner.
Wagner's name surfaced briefly again this March
as a possible Republican-Liberal candidate for
mayor with the support of Gov. Nelson Rockefeller.
When Wagner refused to run for the office he held
from 1953 to 1965, Rockefeller formally endorsed
Marchi, although political experts have placed the
governor closer to Beame, who would be expected
to maintain a low profile for the city in
Rockefeller's expected re-election campaign next
year.
'Stop Biaggi'
Liberal Party chief Alex Rose, who admitted that
his support of Wagner had been a "stop-Biaggi"
measure, later endorsed Blumenthal.
Conservative leaders are expected to attempt to
strip Biaggi of their party's nomination in the near
future, on the basis of his "lack of candor" when
confronted with anonymous reports of his gTand
jury testimony.
The nomination would presumably go to Marchi,
although present state election laws prohibit any
change. In the event of a future Consp-vative switch,
Biaggi may run on an independent ticket in
November.
New York City Controller Abraham D. Beame
placed first in a four-way Democratic primary for
mayor yesterday, but failed to gather the 40 percent
of the vote needed to win the nomination.
The 67-year-old Beame will face Rep. Herman
Badillo in a runoff June 26. The winner will
probably have three opponents in the November
general election: Republican State Sen. John
Marchi; Conservative nominee Mario Biaggi, a Bronx
congressman; and Liberal primary winner Albert
Blumenthal, a state assemblyman.
Biaggi and Blumenthal placed third and fourth,
respectively, in yesterday's Democratic contest.
With 94 percent of the election districts
reporting, Beame had 250,760 votes or 34 percent;
Badillo 209,933 or 29 percent; Biaggi 151,451 or 21
percent, and Blumenthal 116,788 or 16 percent.
Biaggi was considered the front-runner until
April 18, when the New York Times reported that
Biaggi, while a witness before a grand jury
investigating immigration bills in Congress, had
taken the Fifth Amendment to 30 questions about
his personal finances.
16 Questions
After Biaggi fought unsuccessfully in court to
preserve the secrecy of his testimony, the record
revealed that he had declined to answer 16

questions involving his daughter and a number of
business associates.
The questions did not mention personal finances,
and Biaggi had apparently cited constitutional
privilege against further testimony after he was
prevented from reading a statement protesting the
line of questioning and the subpoenaing of his
daughter before the grand jury.
After the minutes of the grand jury had been
published, Conservative Party leaders and newsmen
charged that Biaggi had previously denied that he
had ever refused to answer any question before any
grand jury.
In subsequent weeks, the Bronx District
Attorney's office began a new investigation of a
1959 gun battle in which Biaggi, then a police
lieutenant, killed a robbery suspect and won his
department's Medal of Honor for his actions. Grand
jury hearings on the matter were put off until after
yesterday's election.
Financial Expertise
Beame, who lost the 1965 mayoral election to
John V. Lindsay, has the endorsement of nearly all
regular Democratic clubs in the city and of most
labor unions. He campaigned on a platform
emphasizing his financial expertise and his many
years of experience in New York City politics.
Badillo, a native of Puerto Rico, is considered to

be the most liberal of this year's mayoral
candidates. He placed third in the 1969 Democratic
primary behind Controller Mario Procaccino and
former Mayor Robert Wagner.
