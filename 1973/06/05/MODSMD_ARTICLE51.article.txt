# Basketball Revival Highlights 1972-73 Sports Year
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
It is ironic that after nine months of
competition in more than 15 sports, the most
memorable moment in 1972-73 Stanford
athletics was a loss. But that defeat, a thrilling
51-45 setback against national champion UCLA
at Pauley Pavilion, culminated the successful
reversal of Cardinal basketball fortunes and
certainly marked the highlight of Stanford's
sports year.
Coach Howie Dallmar's cagers, who had
assured Stanford's first winning season since
1966 the night before with a 50-47 victory over
USC, came into the UCLA game with dreams of
an upset but without any realistic hopes of
snapping the Bruins' awesome three-year winning
streak at 69. After the first half, however, 12,489
fans sat in stunned silence as the teams departed
for the dressing rooms with Stanford ahead,
25-18.
But when the second half began, the UCLA
crowd, apparently inspired by a halftime
presentation to coach John Wooden
commemorating his silver anniversary at UCLA,
suddenly came alive. Amid deafening roars from
the Bruin rooting section, UCLA scored two
baskets in the first 30 seconds to cut the Cardinal
lead to three.
About four minutes later, referee Charles
Reed allowed an obvious dunk by UCLA's Larry
Farmer (a call which is still causing recurring
nightmares for assistant coach Bub Bowling), and
l hen with 14:57 remaining, Keith Wilkes canned
two free throws to put the Bruins ahead for the
first time since the early moments of the game.
UCLA gradually pulled away and despite some
periodic Stanford surges, eventually recorded a
51-45 victory, the Bruins' 70th straight in a
seemingly endless streak.
UCLA went on to win a unprecedented sixth
straight national title, cruising through the
NCAA tournament without any serious scares.
The Bruins' final record was 30-0, and none of
those victories was as hard-earned as the March 3
win over Stanford.
Satisfying Victories
Of course 1972-73 Stanford athletic success
was not always measured by near misses.
Stanford teams recorded countless satisfying
victories during the past year, beginning on Sept.
16, when the Cardinals celebrated Jack
Christiansen's debut as head football coach with
a 44-0 victory over San Jose State at Stanford
Stadium.
The following week things weren't quite as
easy for the Cards in Durham, North Carolina. It
took two stingy goal line stands in the final
minutes (one from the four yard line and one
from the eight) to preserve a 10-6 victory over
the Duke Blue Devils in a regionally televised
contest.
The Cards ran their unbeaten streak to three
the next Saturday with a 41-35 victory over
previously undefeated West Virginia setting up an
October 7 showdown between the 15th ranked
Cards and the number one ranked USC Trojans,
a game that elicited varied commentary from
coaches and sportswriters throughout the
preceding week.
McKay Cautious
John McKay, whose undefeated Trojans were
rated 19 point favorites, continually tried to
minimize USC's advantage. "They'll (Stanford)
be a big test for us because they're the first team
we've met this year with an acceptable running
attack to go with an acceptable passing offense."
Meanwhile Jack Christiansen was ebullient in
his praise for the Trojans. "USC has a great
team," he said of a Trojan squad that had
outscored four previous opponents 189-42. "It's
very tough to see any weaknesses."
Not everyone was talking about strengths,
weaknesses, and statistics, though. San Francisco
Chronicle columnist Glenn Dickey admitted that
USC probably had the stronger football team,
but attacked the Trojan athletic department,
which he charged "has never been able to keep
football in perspective."
"I enjoy Stanford football because the
Cardinals (nee Indians) have done admirably with
the program, making it successful and yet
keeping it in perspective," Dickey wrote."That is
not easy, as even a cursory look around the
country will show.
"This Saturday at Palo Alto the Cards host
USC, a team which has never been able to keep
football in perspective; at USC, the tail has
wagged the dog so long, it thinks it is the dog.
Though Stanford has some good players, the
Trojans appear to be too strong for the Cards —
or anybody else.
"Yet, it has appeared that way for the last
two years, and Stanford has won so I'll be there
Saturday, rooting for the forces of good to
prevail."
USC 30, Stanford 21
84,000 fans assembled in Stanford Stadium
on Saturday to watch a 30-21 USC victory which
provoked even more controversy than the
pre-game discussions.
"They're the worst winners I've ever come up
against," cried McKay after his Trojans had tried
a pass play with two seconds left and a
nine-point lead. "I'd like to beat them by 2000
points."
But McKay wasn't through. "Why is it when
we play these hotshots there are no penalties
called both ways. They've shown no class against
us."
Christiansen declined to comment on McKay's
verbal tirade. "I learned a long time ago that it's
no use getting in a contest with a skunk," Chris
said.
The game itself was sloppy but exciting.
Stanford scored first when James Ferguson
recovered a Trojan fumble in the end zone. After
two Rod Garcia field goals and two USC
touchdowns the score was tied 13-13 with 1:24
left in the first half.
But when the Cards got set to punt, center
Bill Reid's snap sailed over Dave Ottmar's head
and USC defensive end James Sims recovered on
Stanford's five yard line. Two plays later
Anthony Davis scored to give the Trojans a 20-13
halftime advantage.
Toughest For Trojans
USC controlled the second half and eventually
recorded its nine point victory. It was easily the
toughest game of the year for the undefeated
national champions, but it was a victory which all
but eliminated the Cards from Rose Bowl
contention.
Christiansen, however, refused to give up. "I
don't think we're out of it [Rose Bowl race) by
any means," he said. "We still have a great
chance."

The Cards' dim Rose Bowl hopes stayed alive
the following week when Stanford scored an
impressive 24-0 victory over an undefeated
Washington team, but a week later Dan Fouts
and the Oregon Ducks ended any thoughts of
New Year's Day in Pasadena with a 15-13 upset
in Eugene.
Stanford then defeated Oregon State (as Rod
Garcia became the most prolific field goal kicker
in Stanford history with his 22nd career field
goal), lost to UCLA 28-23 at the Los Angeles
Coliseum, and lost to Washington State 27-13 in
Pullman as Mike Boryla spent most of the
afternoon on his back.
Stanford's grid record stood at a dismal 5-4
as the Cards prepared for the Big Game in
Berkeley. The game had no real significance as
far as the Pac-8 race was concerned. The
traditional Big Game bonfire was cancelled and
the Band's activities in San Francisco were
curtailed by a police ordinance, but emotions
were still high on both sides for the 75th renewal
of the Big Game rivalry.
"The significance of the game goes without
saying," said Cal coach Mike White, who was
struggling though his first year as the Bears' head
coach after assisting John Ralston at Stanford.
"I have a lot of friends at Stanford, most of
them players, and I respect them. I know they'd
like to beat the hell out of me because that's the
way it is in athletics."
Mud Bowl
The "Big Game Mud Bowl" was played on a
field Christiansen called "the worst I've ever
seen," but 68,000 fans were treated to one of the
most thrilling football games in recent memory.
With four seconds left on the clock, Cal had the
ball on the Stanford seven yard line. It was
fourth down, Cal trailed 21-18, and everyone at
California Memorial Stadium expected a field
goal attempt.
But freshman quarterback Vince Ferragamo
broke out of the huddle and strode confidently
to the line of scrimmage for one final play. He
dropped back, rolled to his right, and with no
time on the clock threw a perfect strike to Steve
Sweeney in the left corner of the end zone.
"I never thought of going for a tie," said an
elated White. "This game means too much."
The Cards were idle the following week, but

during that period Rod Garcia, Jim Merlo, and
Randy Poltl were named to the first team
All-Pacific Eight squad and Merlo, Poltl and
Younger Klippert were selected to the AP's
All-Coast first team.
Eric Cross was only an honorable mention
all-league selection, but on Dec. 2 in Honolulu the
5-10 senior made the selection committee think
twice about its first team receivers. Cross caught
14 passes and took over the Pac-8 lead with 53 as
the Cards ripped the Hawaii Rainbows 39-7. He
also tied the Stanford record with his ninth
touchdown reception of the season and broke
the Pac-8 record for single game catches.
Stanford's final point of the season was scored
by Steve Murray, who kicked the extra point
after Stanford's last score. Murray, who normally
held for Rod Garcia, booted the ball squarely
through the uprights as the two reversed roles for
the final play.
The team's final record was a disappointing
6-5 (2-5 in the league), but while the varsity was
struggling against Pac-8 opponents, the Card
junior varsity recorded Stanford's first
undefeated JV season since 1965. First year
coahc Hudson Houck directed his team to a 4-0
record, including two shutous.
The Cards outscored their opponents 143-22
and while the offense rolled up over 900 yards
on the ground, the defense held four opponents
to a meager 51 net yards rushing.
The cross country ttam also completed a
successful season, winning the Pac-8 Southern
Division title before finishing fourth in the Pac-8
meet. Brian Mittelstaedt and Tony Sandoval
placed 1-2 in the Southern Division event at the
Stanford golf course.
Women Win
The women's swimming team added another
highlight to Stanford's fall quarter collection,
winning the 12-team Northern California
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference meet in
Sacramento.
After the final Pac-8 football statistics (which
showed Mike Boryla leading the league in total
offense and passing and Eric Cross on top of the
receiving charts) were released, Stanford fans
turned their attention to a basketball team which
promised to be the youngest, tallest, and possibly
best Stanford team in nearly a decade.
The Cards opened their season against a USF
team which boasted top 20 preseason national
rankings and a front line averaging 6-9. Stanford
coach Howie Dallmar countered with a youthful
lineup featuring three sophomores and two
juniors. Dallmar admitted that "USF will be a
tough assignment for a young team to face in its
first game."
A nervous Stanford team took the floor on
Dec. 1 at USF's Memorial Gymnasium. The Dons
jumped out to an early lead and despite
creditable performances by Mike Mann (16
points, 12 rebounds) and Rich Kelley (12 points,
14 rebounds, eight blocked shots), countless
turnovers doomed the Cards and USF eventually
recorded an 83-68 victory.
Three days later, however, Stanford scored its
first victory of the season, defeating Arizona
75-68 before a small but appreciative Maples
Pavilion crowd. After a two week break for
finals, the Cards played seven games during
Christmas vacation, including a 77-72 loss to
eventual NIT champ Virginia Tech in the finals
of the Old Dominion Classic at Norfolk, Va.
Winning Record
When Dallmar and his squad returned home
just before New Year's Day, the Pacific Eight
Council had already granted Mike Boryla an
extra year of football eligibility and Stanford's
basketball record stood at 5-4, marking the first
time in six years that the Cards would enter
Pac-8 play with a winning record.
But when the league season began on Jan. 6 in
Pullman, Wash., the Cards continued to play an
unpredictable brand of basketball. Stanford shot
26.4 percent from the floor in a 61-49 loss to
lowly Washington State in the conference
opener, and then completely reversed gears two
nights later in Seattle, romping past Washington's
highly-rated Huskies, 76-55. TTie Cards jumped
out to a 24-2 lead in that game, and Kelley
finished the contest with 24 points and 17
rebounds.
The following week Stanford lost by a
respectable 15 points to UCLA on Friday but
played its worst basketball of the year in an
83-67 Saturday night loss against USC. Stanford
then won two in a row, including an 80-68 win at
UC Santa Barbara where freshman Tim
Patterson was 10-10 from the floor and scored
22 points.
Merlo Drafted
Meanwhile Jim Merlo was selected in the
fourth round of the NFL draft by New Orleans
and Mike Askea and Roger Cowan were also
picked. That weekend, Stanford upset UCLA in
swimming 60-53; the basketball team won its

third in a row against California; and Coach Dick
Gould's tennis squad opened its quest for the
NCAA title by winning the first annual National
Indoor tournament in Madison, Wise.
The Cards defeated North Carolina and Trinity
in the opening rounds of the team dual match
event to reach the semifinals, where Stanford
stopped USC, 6-3. In the finals the next day,
UCLA fell to the Cards by an identical 6-3 score
and the netmen were on their way to an eventful
1973 campaign.
A week later the basketball team's three game
win streak was snapped when the Cards suffered
from a turnover epidemic in the Pacific
Northwest. Oregon and Oregon State took
advantage of 53 Cardinal miscues over the
weekend as both the Ducks and the Beavers
recorded six-point victories.
Things improved slightly when the teams met
again the next week at Maples Pavilion, but the
Cards squandered a 10-point second half lead
against Oregon to spoil a weekend which began
impressively the night before with an 81-70
victory over the 18th ranked Beavers.
World Record
That same weekend four Cardinal runners
blazed around the track at Idaho State's
minidome in 1:27.4, setting a new world indoor
record for the 880 yard relay. Ken Curl, John
Kessel, Matt Hogsett, and John Anderson
comprised the record-setting team.
In the next week the cagers swept two games
from Washington and Washington State; the
tennis team cruised to an easy victory in the
Northern California Intercollegiates; and Chris
Horpel finished second in the Pac-8 wrestling
meet.
And while the basketball team was completing
its memorable weekend in Los Angeles a week
later, Payton Jordan's track squad opened its
outdoor season, splashing to a 128-31 victory
over Fresno State in rain-soaked Stanford
Stadium. In Santa Monica, Stanford finished a
disappointing fourth in the Pac-8 swimming
meet, but Cardinal swimmers turned in some
outstanding individual performances.
John Hencken set a conference record of 57.7
in the 100 yard breaststroke, touching out
teammate Brian Job, who set the old mark in last
year's meet. In the 200, however, Job edged
Olympic gold medal winner Hencken in 2:05.4.
As championship competition continued for
winter sports teams, the list of highlights
mounted. Steve Hug won the all-around title at
the Pac-8 gymnastics meet as a depleted Cardinal
squad finished third behind California and
Washington. Howard Bessen won the rings, Ted
Marcy took the side horse, and Shawn Skerrett
placed second in the vault to join Hug on the list
of NCAA qualifiers.
Hug Ties NCAA's
Hug later tied for the all-around title at the
NCAA meet in Eugene, Ore., the second straight
year the two-time Olympian had gained at least a
share of the all-around title. The swimmers were
also successful in NCAA competition, placing
sixth in the Knoxville, Tenn. meet as Hencken
won the 100 breast, Job finished second in the
200, and Dean Anderson swam to an impressive
third place finish in the 100 free. At the NCAA
wrestling meet, an injured Horpel still managed a
fifth place finish in the 142 pound weight
division.
Back at Stanford, 6652 fans watched the
Cards conclude their most successful basketball
season since 1966 with a 70-66 victory over Cal
at Maples. Seniors Bob Buell and Pat Rusco got
the Cards going, but it was Kelley who came
through in the clutch, scoring Stanford's final 14
points in a performance that clearly established
him as one of the finest players in the nation.
Stanford finished the season with a 14-11
record (7-7 in the league) and Kelley earned first
team All-Pac-8 recognition along with Bill Walton
and Keith Wilkes of UCLA, Washington's Louie
Nelson, and Oregon freshman Ron Lee.
Statistically, the talented seven footer averaged
17.3 points, 13.7 rebounds, shot 51.8 percent
from the floor, and 70.5 from the foul line.
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar was certainly
pleased with Kelley's season, and also expressed
satisfaction over the team's winning record. "We
were young and made mistakes, but it was an
exciting team to watch," Dallmar said, adding
that "we anticipate being much stronger next
year."
Spring Sports
After the last basketball game, spring sports
teams began to occupy the spotlight. Bud
Finger's golfers won their first major tournament
of the season at the Pacific Coast Invitational in
Santa Barbara, triumphing over a strong field
which included national powers USC, Long
Beach State, and Arizona State. A few days later,
however, athletic director Joseph Ruetz offered
to forfeit the championship when it was learned
that Bruce Robertson had lost his amateur status
because of a rules violation involving the sale of
golf equipment.
The USGA ruled that Robertson was no
longer an amateur, and the Stanford sophomore
was forced to withdraw from the Masters
tournament. Robertson had earned a berth in the
prestigious event by finishing sixth in the U.S.
Amateur in September and was about to leave
for Augusta, Ga. when he learned of the USGA
decision.
Stanford played without Robertson at the
University of Pacific Invitational, and the golfers
were one of four spring teams that floundered
over the weekend. The baseball team, which had
compiled a 17-8 record in non-league
competition and boasted a 12th place national
ranking, lost two out of three games to UCLA in
its conference opener; the tennis team was
shocked twice in Los Angeles, losing 6-3 to USC
and 5-4 to UCLA; the track team lost 101-50 to
defending NCAA champion UCLA; and the
golfers finished third at UOP even though George
Pettinger (Robertson's replacement) fired rounds
of 74-71 for a third place individual finish.
Things looked up at the Farm in the next few
weeks, though. Ray Young's baseball team
played well at Sunken Diamond in a three game
series against the defending national champion
USC Trojans. USC won 2-1 and 3-0, but Bob
DiPietro sandwiched a brilliant three-hit shutout
in between the two losses, blanking the Trojans,
1-0 in the first game of Saturday's doubleheader
while striking out 13.
Tennis Revenge
The next week 2500 fans jammed the varsity
tennis courts to watch the Cards avenge their
earlier losses to USC and UCLA. This time
Stanford prevailed 7-2 over the Bruins and 5-4
over the Trojans as the Cards won 10 of 12
singles matches.

On April 28, as the netmen began their
defense of the Ojai Intercollegiate tennis title,
204 players representing 34 teams swarmed over
the Stanford golf course for the sixth annual U.S.
Collegiate Invitational. The field was obviously
"quantity not quality" as only San Jose State
could mount any serious threat to the Cards.
Stanford eventually won the 54-hole event by
two strokes over the Spartans and Cardinal
sophomore Conrad Nilmeier defeated San Jose's
Phil Barry in a sudden death playoff to win the
individual title.
About the same time Nilmeier won the
sudden death playoff, freshman John Whitlinger
and Pat DuPre clinched the Ojai tennis title with
a 7-6, 3-6, 7-6 semifinal doubles victory over the
USC team of Sashi Menon-John Andrews. The
Cards finished with 16 points compared to 14 for
second place USC. UCLA was third as the "Big
Three" continued its five round struggle for
national tennis supremacy.
The following week the netmen beat Cal 8-1
to conclude a 15-2 dual match season; the
women's tennis team triumphed in the Northern
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference
tournament (Andrea Barnes won the singles title
and Whitney Grant-Terry Albert won the doubles
crown); and A 1 Arthur shutout USC 3-0 as the
Cards dropped two of three to the Trojans at
Bovard Field in Los Angeles.
Individuals Shine
Except for the baseball teams's doubleheader
sweep against UCLA (with Arthur and Dave
Frost hurling the victories), individual
accomplishments dominated the next few weeks
of sports highlights. Sandy Mayer won his second
straight Cal State tennis title, defeating South
African pro Ray Moore in the finals. Brian Job
received the A 1 Masters Award presented to the
Stanford athlete "attaining the highest degree of
leadership, athletic achievement, and
scholarship." The Biff Hoffman award for the
outstanding Stanford athlete went to gymnast
Steve Hug.
Individual achievements were also noteworthy
in the 89th Big Meet. Cal defeated the Cards
84-70 at Stanford Stadium, but freshman Terry
Albritton became the third 18 year-old in history
to put the shot 61-6V2 as he set a new meet and

school record in that event. Brian Mittlestaedt
doubled in the mile and two mile; Dave Bagshaw
won the 120 high hurdle; Ken Curl won the 100;
Jim Howard took the discus; John Anderson
won the 440; and Tom Anderson won the long
jump in other Stanford individual wins.
Tlie underdog Whites beat the Reds 14-8 as
the football squad concluded four weeks of spring
drills on May 14 with the annual Red-White
game. The play was generally sloppy, but coach
Jack Christiansen was pleased with his team's
spring progress and expressed "cautious
optimism" in anticipation of next fall's opener
against Penn State on Sept. 15.
Sweep Over Cal
A lot of fans walked over to Sunken Diamond
after the Red-White game and watched the
baseball Cards sweep a doubleheader from Cal to
end its season in second place in the Pac-8
Southern Division with a 9-9 league record. The
team finished with a 34-20 overall mark as
sophomore Bob Hampton led the hitters with a
.393 average, and Bob DiPietro (5-2, 1.30), A 1
Arthur 7-2, 1.55), and Dave Frost (6-0, 2.11)
paced the mound corps.
Hampton, DiPietro, and freshman catcher
Dave Baker were named to the Pac-8 Southern
Division all-league squad.
Pac-8 competition in tennis, track, and golf
brought disappointing results in the next few
weeks. UCLA stunned Stanford and USC to win
the tennis crown at USC's new David Marks
tennis center; the track team finished last at
Eugene, Ore.; and the golfers made a final round
charge (sparked by a 64 by Dave Baskins and a
65 by Conrad Nilmeier) but still finished second
to USC at Clarkston Golf Course in Clarkston,
Wash.
But the 1972-73 Stanford sports season is far
from complete. NCAA competition remains in
tennis, track, and golf, and two Stanford athletes
(Rich Kelley and Brian Job) and Stanford swim
coach Jim Gaughran will be touring China this
summer on goodwill tours sponsored by the
State Department.
Of course the biggest remaining event is the
NCAA tennis championships at Princeton, New
Jersey, a tournament that Dick Gould and his
Cardinal team hopes will become the undisputed
highlight of Stanford's 1972-73 sports season.

BATTLE OF THE GIANTS-UCLA's seemingly
superhuman Bill Walton appears to have
established clear superiority over Stanford
9ophomore Rich Kelley in this picture, but
Kelley proved throughout the 1972-73 basketball
season that he was among the best mortal big
men in the nation. Kelley played Walton to a
virtual statistical standoff when the Cards nearly
upset the Bruins at Pauley Pavilion. In that
contest Kelley scored 15 points and grabbed 15
rebounds while Walton turned in a 23 point, 10
rebound performance.

McCLOUD FOR THE DEFENSE Senior defensive halfback Charles McCloud dives for a possible
interception during Stanford's 10-6 victory over Duke last fall. McCloud and his fellow defensive
backs led the Pacific Eight in pass defense, but coach Jack Christiansen's Cardinals still struggled
through a disappointing 6-5 season.

NCAA CHAMPION—Two-time Olympian Steve
Hug tied for the NCAA Ail-Around title at
Eugene, Ore. in April after winning a full share of
the crown last year. Hug will be back for his
senior season next year and will be competing for
an unprecedented third NCAA All-Around title.
It is ironic that after nine months of
competition in more than 15 sports, the most
memorable moment in 1972-73 Stanford
athletics was a loss. But that defeat, a thrilling
51-45 setback against national champion UCLA
at Pauley Pavilion, culminated the successful
reversal of Cardinal basketball fortunes and
certainly marked the highlight of Stanford's
sports year.
Coach Howie Dallmar's cagers, who had
assured Stanford's first winning season since
1966 the night before with a 50-47 victory over
USC, came into the UCLA game with dreams of
an upset but without any realistic hopes of
snapping the Bruins' awesome three-year winning
streak at 69. After the first half, however, 12,489
fans sat in stunned silence as the teams departed
for the dressing rooms with Stanford ahead,
25-18.
But when the second half began, the UCLA
crowd, apparently inspired by a halftime
presentation to coach John Wooden
commemorating his silver anniversary at UCLA,
suddenly came alive. Amid deafening roars from
the Bruin rooting section, UCLA scored two
baskets in the first 30 seconds to cut the Cardinal
lead to three.
About four minutes later, referee Charles
Reed allowed an obvious dunk by UCLA's Larry
Farmer (a call which is still causing recurring
nightmares for assistant coach Bub Bowling), and
l hen with 14:57 remaining, Keith Wilkes canned
two free throws to put the Bruins ahead for the
first time since the early moments of the game.
UCLA gradually pulled away and despite some
periodic Stanford surges, eventually recorded a
51-45 victory, the Bruins' 70th straight in a
seemingly endless streak.
UCLA went on to win a unprecedented sixth
straight national title, cruising through the
NCAA tournament without any serious scares.
The Bruins' final record was 30-0, and none of
those victories was as hard-earned as the March 3
win over Stanford.
Satisfying Victories
Of course 1972-73 Stanford athletic success
was not always measured by near misses.
Stanford teams recorded countless satisfying
victories during the past year, beginning on Sept.
16, when the Cardinals celebrated Jack
Christiansen's debut as head football coach with
a 44-0 victory over San Jose State at Stanford
Stadium.
The following week things weren't quite as

took two stingy goal line stands in the final
minutes (one from the four yard line and one
from the eight) to preserve a 10-6 victory over

The Cards ran their unbeaten streak to three

previously undefeated West Virginia setting up an
October 7 showdown between the 15th ranked

"Yet, it has appeared that way for the last

USC 30, Stanford 21
84,000 fans assembled in Stanford Stadium
on Saturday to watch a 30-21 USC victory which
provoked even more controversy than the
pre-game discussions.
"They're the worst winners I've ever come up
against," cried McKay after his Trojans had tried
a pass play with two seconds left and a
nine-point lead. "I'd like to beat them by 2000
points."
But McKay wasn't through. "Why is it when
we play these hotshots there are no penalties
called both ways. They've shown no class against
us."
Christiansen declined to comment on McKay's
verbal tirade. "I learned a long time ago that it's
no use getting in a contest with a skunk," Chris
said.
The game itself was sloppy but exciting.
Stanford scored first when James Ferguson
recovered a Trojan fumble in the end zone. After
two Rod Garcia field goals and two USC
touchdowns the score was tied 13-13 with 1:24
left in the first half.
But when the Cards got set to punt, center
Bill Reid's snap sailed over Dave Ottmar's head
and USC defensive end James Sims recovered on
Stanford's five yard line. Two plays later
Anthony Davis scored to give the Trojans a 20-13
halftime advantage.
Toughest For Trojans
USC controlled the second half and eventually
recorded its nine point victory. It was easily the
toughest game of the year for the undefeated
national champions, but it was a victory which all
but eliminated the Cards from Rose Bowl
contention.
Christiansen, however, refused to give up. "I
don't think we're out of it [Rose Bowl race) by
any means," he said. "We still have a great
chance."

The Cards' dim Rose Bowl hopes stayed alive
the following week when Stanford scored an
impressive 24-0 victory over an undefeated
Washington team, but a week later Dan Fouts
and the Oregon Ducks ended any thoughts of
New Year's Day in Pasadena with a 15-13 upset
in Eugene.
Stanford then defeated Oregon State (as Rod
Garcia became the most prolific field goal kicker
in Stanford history with his 22nd career field
goal), lost to UCLA 28-23 at the Los Angeles
Coliseum, and lost to Washington State 27-13 in
Pullman as Mike Boryla spent most of the
afternoon on his back.
Stanford's grid record stood at a dismal 5-4
as the Cards prepared for the Big Game in
Berkeley. The game had no real significance as
far as the Pac-8 race was concerned. The
traditional Big Game bonfire was cancelled and
the Band's activities in San Francisco were
curtailed by a police ordinance, but emotions
were still high on both sides for the 75th renewal
of the Big Game rivalry.
"The significance of the game goes without
saying," said Cal coach Mike White, who was
struggling though his first year as the Bears' head
coach after assisting John Ralston at Stanford.
"I have a lot of friends at Stanford, most of
them players, and I respect them. I know they'd
like to beat the hell out of me because that's the
way it is in athletics."
Mud Bowl
The "Big Game Mud Bowl" was played on a
field Christiansen called "the worst I've ever
seen," but 68,000 fans were treated to one of the
most thrilling football games in recent memory.
With four seconds left on the clock, Cal had the
ball on the Stanford seven yard line. It was
fourth down, Cal trailed 21-18, and everyone at
California Memorial Stadium expected a field
goal attempt.
But freshman quarterback Vince Ferragamo
broke out of the huddle and strode confidently
to the line of scrimmage for one final play. He
dropped back, rolled to his right, and with no
time on the clock threw a perfect strike to Steve
Sweeney in the left corner of the end zone.
"I never thought of going for a tie," said an
elated White. "This game means too much."
The Cards were idle the following week, but

during that period Rod Garcia, Jim Merlo, and
Randy Poltl were named to the first team
All-Pacific Eight squad and Merlo, Poltl and
Younger Klippert were selected to the AP's
All-Coast first team.
Eric Cross was only an honorable mention
all-league selection, but on Dec. 2 in Honolulu the
5-10 senior made the selection committee think
twice about its first team receivers. Cross caught
14 passes and took over the Pac-8 lead with 53 as
the Cards ripped the Hawaii Rainbows 39-7. He
also tied the Stanford record with his ninth
touchdown reception of the season and broke
the Pac-8 record for single game catches.
Stanford's final point of the season was scored
by Steve Murray, who kicked the extra point
after Stanford's last score. Murray, who normally
held for Rod Garcia, booted the ball squarely
through the uprights as the two reversed roles for
the final play.
The team's final record was a disappointing
6-5 (2-5 in the league), but while the varsity was
struggling against Pac-8 opponents, the Card
junior varsity recorded Stanford's first
undefeated JV season since 1965. First year
coahc Hudson Houck directed his team to a 4-0
record, including two shutous.
The Cards outscored their opponents 143-22
and while the offense rolled up over 900 yards
on the ground, the defense held four opponents
to a meager 51 net yards rushing.
The cross country ttam also completed a
successful season, winning the Pac-8 Southern
Division title before finishing fourth in the Pac-8
meet. Brian Mittelstaedt and Tony Sandoval
placed 1-2 in the Southern Division event at the
Stanford golf course.
Women Win
The women's swimming team added another
highlight to Stanford's fall quarter collection,
winning the 12-team Northern California
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference meet in
Sacramento.
After the final Pac-8 football statistics (which
showed Mike Boryla leading the league in total
offense and passing and Eric Cross on top of the
receiving charts) were released, Stanford fans
turned their attention to a basketball team which
promised to be the youngest, tallest, and possibly
best Stanford team in nearly a decade.
The Cards opened their season against a USF
team which boasted top 20 preseason national
rankings and a front line averaging 6-9. Stanford
coach Howie Dallmar countered with a youthful
lineup featuring three sophomores and two
juniors. Dallmar admitted that "USF will be a
tough assignment for a young team to face in its
first game."
A nervous Stanford team took the floor on
Dec. 1 at USF's Memorial Gymnasium. The Dons
jumped out to an early lead and despite
creditable performances by Mike Mann (16
points, 12 rebounds) and Rich Kelley (12 points,
14 rebounds, eight blocked shots), countless
turnovers doomed the Cards and USF eventually
recorded an 83-68 victory.
Three days later, however, Stanford scored its
first victory of the season, defeating Arizona
75-68 before a small but appreciative Maples
Pavilion crowd. After a two week break for
finals, the Cards played seven games during
Christmas vacation, including a 77-72 loss to
eventual NIT champ Virginia Tech in the finals
of the Old Dominion Classic at Norfolk, Va.
Winning Record
When Dallmar and his squad returned home
just before New Year's Day, the Pacific Eight
Council had already granted Mike Boryla an
extra year of football eligibility and Stanford's
basketball record stood at 5-4, marking the first
time in six years that the Cards would enter
Pac-8 play with a winning record.
But when the league season began on Jan. 6 in
Pullman, Wash., the Cards continued to play an
unpredictable brand of basketball. Stanford shot
26.4 percent from the floor in a 61-49 loss to
lowly Washington State in the conference
opener, and then completely reversed gears two
nights later in Seattle, romping past Washington's
highly-rated Huskies, 76-55. TTie Cards jumped
out to a 24-2 lead in that game, and Kelley
finished the contest with 24 points and 17
rebounds.
The following week Stanford lost by a
respectable 15 points to UCLA on Friday but
played its worst basketball of the year in an
83-67 Saturday night loss against USC. Stanford
then won two in a row, including an 80-68 win at
UC Santa Barbara where freshman Tim
Patterson was 10-10 from the floor and scored
22 points.
Merlo Drafted
Meanwhile Jim Merlo was selected in the
fourth round of the NFL draft by New Orleans
and Mike Askea and Roger Cowan were also
picked. That weekend, Stanford upset UCLA in
swimming 60-53; the basketball team won its

third in a row against California; and Coach Dick
Gould's tennis squad opened its quest for the
NCAA title by winning the first annual National
Indoor tournament in Madison, Wise.
The Cards defeated North Carolina and Trinity
in the opening rounds of the team dual match
event to reach the semifinals, where Stanford
stopped USC, 6-3. In the finals the next day,
UCLA fell to the Cards by an identical 6-3 score
and the netmen were on their way to an eventful
1973 campaign.
A week later the basketball team's three game
win streak was snapped when the Cards suffered
from a turnover epidemic in the Pacific
Northwest. Oregon and Oregon State took
advantage of 53 Cardinal miscues over the
weekend as both the Ducks and the Beavers
recorded six-point victories.
Things improved slightly when the teams met
again the next week at Maples Pavilion, but the
Cards squandered a 10-point second half lead
against Oregon to spoil a weekend which began
impressively the night before with an 81-70
victory over the 18th ranked Beavers.
World Record
That same weekend four Cardinal runners
blazed around the track at Idaho State's
minidome in 1:27.4, setting a new world indoor
record for the 880 yard relay. Ken Curl, John
Kessel, Matt Hogsett, and John Anderson
comprised the record-setting team.
In the next week the cagers swept two games
from Washington and Washington State; the
tennis team cruised to an easy victory in the
Northern California Intercollegiates; and Chris
Horpel finished second in the Pac-8 wrestling
meet.
And while the basketball team was completing
its memorable weekend in Los Angeles a week
later, Payton Jordan's track squad opened its
outdoor season, splashing to a 128-31 victory
over Fresno State in rain-soaked Stanford
Stadium. In Santa Monica, Stanford finished a
disappointing fourth in the Pac-8 swimming
meet, but Cardinal swimmers turned in some
outstanding individual performances.
John Hencken set a conference record of 57.7
in the 100 yard breaststroke, touching out
teammate Brian Job, who set the old mark in last
year's meet. In the 200, however, Job edged
Olympic gold medal winner Hencken in 2:05.4.
As championship competition continued for
winter sports teams, the list of highlights
mounted. Steve Hug won the all-around title at
the Pac-8 gymnastics meet as a depleted Cardinal
squad finished third behind California and
Washington. Howard Bessen won the rings, Ted
Marcy took the side horse, and Shawn Skerrett
placed second in the vault to join Hug on the list
of NCAA qualifiers.
Hug Ties NCAA's
Hug later tied for the all-around title at the
NCAA meet in Eugene, Ore., the second straight
year the two-time Olympian had gained at least a
share of the all-around title. The swimmers were
also successful in NCAA competition, placing
sixth in the Knoxville, Tenn. meet as Hencken
won the 100 breast, Job finished second in the
200, and Dean Anderson swam to an impressive
third place finish in the 100 free. At the NCAA
wrestling meet, an injured Horpel still managed a
fifth place finish in the 142 pound weight
division.
Back at Stanford, 6652 fans watched the
Cards conclude their most successful basketball
season since 1966 with a 70-66 victory over Cal
at Maples. Seniors Bob Buell and Pat Rusco got
the Cards going, but it was Kelley who came
through in the clutch, scoring Stanford's final 14
points in a performance that clearly established
him as one of the finest players in the nation.
Stanford finished the season with a 14-11
record (7-7 in the league) and Kelley earned first
team All-Pac-8 recognition along with Bill Walton
and Keith Wilkes of UCLA, Washington's Louie
Nelson, and Oregon freshman Ron Lee.
Statistically, the talented seven footer averaged
17.3 points, 13.7 rebounds, shot 51.8 percent
from the floor, and 70.5 from the foul line.
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar was certainly
pleased with Kelley's season, and also expressed
satisfaction over the team's winning record. "We
were young and made mistakes, but it was an
exciting team to watch," Dallmar said, adding
that "we anticipate being much stronger next
year."
Spring Sports
After the last basketball game, spring sports
teams began to occupy the spotlight. Bud
Finger's golfers won their first major tournament
of the season at the Pacific Coast Invitational in
Santa Barbara, triumphing over a strong field
which included national powers USC, Long
Beach State, and Arizona State. A few days later,
however, athletic director Joseph Ruetz offered
to forfeit the championship when it was learned
that Bruce Robertson had lost his amateur status
because of a rules violation involving the sale of
golf equipment.
The USGA ruled that Robertson was no
longer an amateur, and the Stanford sophomore
was forced to withdraw from the Masters
tournament. Robertson had earned a berth in the
prestigious event by finishing sixth in the U.S.
Amateur in September and was about to leave
for Augusta, Ga. when he learned of the USGA
decision.
Stanford played without Robertson at the
University of Pacific Invitational, and the golfers
were one of four spring teams that floundered
over the weekend. The baseball team, which had
compiled a 17-8 record in non-league
competition and boasted a 12th place national
ranking, lost two out of three games to UCLA in
its conference opener; the tennis team was
shocked twice in Los Angeles, losing 6-3 to USC
and 5-4 to UCLA; the track team lost 101-50 to
defending NCAA champion UCLA; and the
golfers finished third at UOP even though George
Pettinger (Robertson's replacement) fired rounds
of 74-71 for a third place individual finish.
Things looked up at the Farm in the next few
weeks, though. Ray Young's baseball team
played well at Sunken Diamond in a three game
series against the defending national champion
USC Trojans. USC won 2-1 and 3-0, but Bob
DiPietro sandwiched a brilliant three-hit shutout
in between the two losses, blanking the Trojans,
1-0 in the first game of Saturday's doubleheader
while striking out 13.
Tennis Revenge
The next week 2500 fans jammed the varsity
tennis courts to watch the Cards avenge their
earlier losses to USC and UCLA. This time
Stanford prevailed 7-2 over the Bruins and 5-4
over the Trojans as the Cards won 10 of 12
singles matches.

On April 28, as the netmen began their
defense of the Ojai Intercollegiate tennis title,
204 players representing 34 teams swarmed over
the Stanford golf course for the sixth annual U.S.
Collegiate Invitational. The field was obviously
"quantity not quality" as only San Jose State
could mount any serious threat to the Cards.
Stanford eventually won the 54-hole event by
two strokes over the Spartans and Cardinal
sophomore Conrad Nilmeier defeated San Jose's
Phil Barry in a sudden death playoff to win the
individual title.
About the same time Nilmeier won the
sudden death playoff, freshman John Whitlinger
and Pat DuPre clinched the Ojai tennis title with
a 7-6, 3-6, 7-6 semifinal doubles victory over the
USC team of Sashi Menon-John Andrews. The
Cards finished with 16 points compared to 14 for
second place USC. UCLA was third as the "Big
Three" continued its five round struggle for
national tennis supremacy.
The following week the netmen beat Cal 8-1
to conclude a 15-2 dual match season; the
women's tennis team triumphed in the Northern
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference
tournament (Andrea Barnes won the singles title
and Whitney Grant-Terry Albert won the doubles
crown); and A 1 Arthur shutout USC 3-0 as the
Cards dropped two of three to the Trojans at
Bovard Field in Los Angeles.
Individuals Shine
Except for the baseball teams's doubleheader
sweep against UCLA (with Arthur and Dave
Frost hurling the victories), individual
accomplishments dominated the next few weeks
of sports highlights. Sandy Mayer won his second
straight Cal State tennis title, defeating South
African pro Ray Moore in the finals. Brian Job
received the A 1 Masters Award presented to the
Stanford athlete "attaining the highest degree of
leadership, athletic achievement, and
scholarship." The Biff Hoffman award for the
outstanding Stanford athlete went to gymnast
Steve Hug.
Individual achievements were also noteworthy
in the 89th Big Meet. Cal defeated the Cards
84-70 at Stanford Stadium, but freshman Terry
Albritton became the third 18 year-old in history
to put the shot 61-6V2 as he set a new meet and

school record in that event. Brian Mittlestaedt
doubled in the mile and two mile; Dave Bagshaw
won the 120 high hurdle; Ken Curl won the 100;
Jim Howard took the discus; John Anderson
won the 440; and Tom Anderson won the long
jump in other Stanford individual wins.
Tlie underdog Whites beat the Reds 14-8 as
the football squad concluded four weeks of spring
drills on May 14 with the annual Red-White
game. The play was generally sloppy, but coach
Jack Christiansen was pleased with his team's
spring progress and expressed "cautious
optimism" in anticipation of next fall's opener
against Penn State on Sept. 15.
Sweep Over Cal
A lot of fans walked over to Sunken Diamond
after the Red-White game and watched the
baseball Cards sweep a doubleheader from Cal to
end its season in second place in the Pac-8
Southern Division with a 9-9 league record. The
team finished with a 34-20 overall mark as
sophomore Bob Hampton led the hitters with a
.393 average, and Bob DiPietro (5-2, 1.30), A 1
Arthur 7-2, 1.55), and Dave Frost (6-0, 2.11)
paced the mound corps.
Hampton, DiPietro, and freshman catcher
Dave Baker were named to the Pac-8 Southern
Division all-league squad.
Pac-8 competition in tennis, track, and golf
brought disappointing results in the next few
weeks. UCLA stunned Stanford and USC to win
the tennis crown at USC's new David Marks
tennis center; the track team finished last at
Eugene, Ore.; and the golfers made a final round
charge (sparked by a 64 by Dave Baskins and a
65 by Conrad Nilmeier) but still finished second
to USC at Clarkston Golf Course in Clarkston,
Wash.
But the 1972-73 Stanford sports season is far
from complete. NCAA competition remains in
tennis, track, and golf, and two Stanford athletes
(Rich Kelley and Brian Job) and Stanford swim
coach Jim Gaughran will be touring China this
summer on goodwill tours sponsored by the
State Department.
Of course the biggest remaining event is the
NCAA tennis championships at Princeton, New
Jersey, a tournament that Dick Gould and his
Cardinal team hopes will become the undisputed
highlight of Stanford's 1972-73 sports season.

BATTLE OF THE GIANTS-UCLA's seemingly
superhuman Bill Walton appears to have
established clear superiority over Stanford
9ophomore Rich Kelley in this picture, but
Kelley proved throughout the 1972-73 basketball
season that he was among the best mortal big
men in the nation. Kelley played Walton to a
virtual statistical standoff when the Cards nearly
upset the Bruins at Pauley Pavilion. In that
contest Kelley scored 15 points and grabbed 15
rebounds while Walton turned in a 23 point, 10
rebound performance.

McCLOUD FOR THE DEFENSE Senior defensive halfback Charles McCloud dives for a possible
interception during Stanford's 10-6 victory over Duke last fall. McCloud and his fellow defensive
backs led the Pacific Eight in pass defense, but coach Jack Christiansen's Cardinals still struggled
through a disappointing 6-5 season.

NCAA CHAMPION—Two-time Olympian Steve
Hug tied for the NCAA Ail-Around title at
Eugene, Ore. in April after winning a full share of
the crown last year. Hug will be back for his
senior season next year and will be competing for
an unprecedented third NCAA All-Around title.
It is ironic that after nine months of
competition in more than 15 sports, the most
memorable moment in 1972-73 Stanford
athletics was a loss. But that defeat, a thrilling
51-45 setback against national champion UCLA
at Pauley Pavilion, culminated the successful
reversal of Cardinal basketball fortunes and
certainly marked the highlight of Stanford's
sports year.
Coach Howie Dallmar's cagers, who had
assured Stanford's first winning season since
1966 the night before with a 50-47 victory over
USC, came into the UCLA game with dreams of
an upset but without any realistic hopes of
snapping the Bruins' awesome three-year winning
streak at 69. After the first half, however, 12,489
fans sat in stunned silence as the teams departed
for the dressing rooms with Stanford ahead,
25-18.
But when the second half began, the UCLA
crowd, apparently inspired by a halftime
presentation to coach John Wooden
commemorating his silver anniversary at UCLA,
suddenly came alive. Amid deafening roars from
the Bruin rooting section, UCLA scored two
baskets in the first 30 seconds to cut the Cardinal
lead to three.
About four minutes later, referee Charles
Reed allowed an obvious dunk by UCLA's Larry
Farmer (a call which is still causing recurring
nightmares for assistant coach Bub Bowling), and
l hen with 14:57 remaining, Keith Wilkes canned
two free throws to put the Bruins ahead for the
first time since the early moments of the game.
UCLA gradually pulled away and despite some
periodic Stanford surges, eventually recorded a
51-45 victory, the Bruins' 70th straight in a
seemingly endless streak.
UCLA went on to win a unprecedented sixth
straight national title, cruising through the
NCAA tournament without any serious scares.
The Bruins' final record was 30-0, and none of
those victories was as hard-earned as the March 3
win over Stanford.
Satisfying Victories
Of course 1972-73 Stanford athletic success
was not always measured by near misses.
Stanford teams recorded countless satisfying
victories during the past year, beginning on Sept.
16, when the Cardinals celebrated Jack
Christiansen's debut as head football coach with
a 44-0 victory over San Jose State at Stanford
Stadium.
The following week things weren't quite as
easy for the Cards in Durham, North Carolina. It
took two stingy goal line stands in the final
minutes (one from the four yard line and one
from the eight) to preserve a 10-6 victory over
the Duke Blue Devils in a regionally televised
contest.
The Cards ran their unbeaten streak to three
the next Saturday with a 41-35 victory over
previously undefeated West Virginia setting up an
October 7 showdown between the 15th ranked
Cards and the number one ranked USC Trojans,
a game that elicited varied commentary from
coaches and sportswriters throughout the
preceding week.
McKay Cautious
John McKay, whose undefeated Trojans were
rated 19 point favorites, continually tried to
minimize USC's advantage. "They'll (Stanford)
be a big test for us because they're the first team
we've met this year with an acceptable running
attack to go with an acceptable passing offense."
Meanwhile Jack Christiansen was ebullient in
his praise for the Trojans. "USC has a great
team," he said of a Trojan squad that had
outscored four previous opponents 189-42. "It's
very tough to see any weaknesses."
Not everyone was talking about strengths,
weaknesses, and statistics, though. San Francisco
Chronicle columnist Glenn Dickey admitted that
USC probably had the stronger football team,
but attacked the Trojan athletic department,
which he charged "has never been able to keep
football in perspective."
"I enjoy Stanford football because the
Cardinals (nee Indians) have done admirably with
the program, making it successful and yet
keeping it in perspective," Dickey wrote."That is
not easy, as even a cursory look around the
country will show.
"This Saturday at Palo Alto the Cards host
USC, a team which has never been able to keep
football in perspective; at USC, the tail has
wagged the dog so long, it thinks it is the dog.
Though Stanford has some good players, the
Trojans appear to be too strong for the Cards —
or anybody else.
"Yet, it has appeared that way for the last
two years, and Stanford has won so I'll be there
Saturday, rooting for the forces of good to
prevail."
USC 30, Stanford 21
84,000 fans assembled in Stanford Stadium
on Saturday to watch a 30-21 USC victory which
provoked even more controversy than the
pre-game discussions.
"They're the worst winners I've ever come up
against," cried McKay after his Trojans had tried
a pass play with two seconds left and a
nine-point lead. "I'd like to beat them by 2000
points."
But McKay wasn't through. "Why is it when
we play these hotshots there are no penalties
called both ways. They've shown no class against
us."
Christiansen declined to comment on McKay's
verbal tirade. "I learned a long time ago that it's
no use getting in a contest with a skunk," Chris
said.
The game itself was sloppy but exciting.
Stanford scored first when James Ferguson
recovered a Trojan fumble in the end zone. After
two Rod Garcia field goals and two USC
touchdowns the score was tied 13-13 with 1:24
left in the first half.
But when the Cards got set to punt, center
Bill Reid's snap sailed over Dave Ottmar's head
and USC defensive end James Sims recovered on
Stanford's five yard line. Two plays later
Anthony Davis scored to give the Trojans a 20-13
halftime advantage.
Toughest For Trojans
USC controlled the second half and eventually
recorded its nine point victory. It was easily the
toughest game of the year for the undefeated
national champions, but it was a victory which all
but eliminated the Cards from Rose Bowl
contention.
Christiansen, however, refused to give up. "I
don't think we're out of it [Rose Bowl race) by
any means," he said. "We still have a great
chance."

The Cards' dim Rose Bowl hopes stayed alive
the following week when Stanford scored an
impressive 24-0 victory over an undefeated
Washington team, but a week later Dan Fouts
and the Oregon Ducks ended any thoughts of
New Year's Day in Pasadena with a 15-13 upset
in Eugene.
Stanford then defeated Oregon State (as Rod
Garcia became the most prolific field goal kicker
in Stanford history with his 22nd career field
goal), lost to UCLA 28-23 at the Los Angeles
Coliseum, and lost to Washington State 27-13 in
Pullman as Mike Boryla spent most of the
afternoon on his back.
Stanford's grid record stood at a dismal 5-4
as the Cards prepared for the Big Game in
Berkeley. The game had no real significance as
far as the Pac-8 race was concerned. The
traditional Big Game bonfire was cancelled and
the Band's activities in San Francisco were
curtailed by a police ordinance, but emotions
were still high on both sides for the 75th renewal
of the Big Game rivalry.
"The significance of the game goes without
saying," said Cal coach Mike White, who was
struggling though his first year as the Bears' head
coach after assisting John Ralston at Stanford.
"I have a lot of friends at Stanford, most of
them players, and I respect them. I know they'd
like to beat the hell out of me because that's the
way it is in athletics."
Mud Bowl
The "Big Game Mud Bowl" was played on a
field Christiansen called "the worst I've ever
seen," but 68,000 fans were treated to one of the
most thrilling football games in recent memory.
With four seconds left on the clock, Cal had the
ball on the Stanford seven yard line. It was
fourth down, Cal trailed 21-18, and everyone at
California Memorial Stadium expected a field
goal attempt.
But freshman quarterback Vince Ferragamo
broke out of the huddle and strode confidently
to the line of scrimmage for one final play. He
dropped back, rolled to his right, and with no
time on the clock threw a perfect strike to Steve
Sweeney in the left corner of the end zone.
"I never thought of going for a tie," said an
elated White. "This game means too much."
The Cards were idle the following week, but

during that period Rod Garcia, Jim Merlo, and
Randy Poltl were named to the first team
All-Pacific Eight squad and Merlo, Poltl and
Younger Klippert were selected to the AP's
All-Coast first team.
Eric Cross was only an honorable mention
all-league selection, but on Dec. 2 in Honolulu the
5-10 senior made the selection committee think
twice about its first team receivers. Cross caught
14 passes and took over the Pac-8 lead with 53 as
the Cards ripped the Hawaii Rainbows 39-7. He
also tied the Stanford record with his ninth
touchdown reception of the season and broke
the Pac-8 record for single game catches.
Stanford's final point of the season was scored
by Steve Murray, who kicked the extra point
after Stanford's last score. Murray, who normally
held for Rod Garcia, booted the ball squarely
through the uprights as the two reversed roles for
the final play.
The team's final record was a disappointing
6-5 (2-5 in the league), but while the varsity was
struggling against Pac-8 opponents, the Card
junior varsity recorded Stanford's first
undefeated JV season since 1965. First year
coahc Hudson Houck directed his team to a 4-0
record, including two shutous.
The Cards outscored their opponents 143-22
and while the offense rolled up over 900 yards
on the ground, the defense held four opponents
to a meager 51 net yards rushing.
The cross country ttam also completed a
successful season, winning the Pac-8 Southern
Division title before finishing fourth in the Pac-8
meet. Brian Mittelstaedt and Tony Sandoval
placed 1-2 in the Southern Division event at the
Stanford golf course.
Women Win
The women's swimming team added another
highlight to Stanford's fall quarter collection,
winning the 12-team Northern California
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference meet in
Sacramento.
After the final Pac-8 football statistics (which
showed Mike Boryla leading the league in total
offense and passing and Eric Cross on top of the
receiving charts) were released, Stanford fans
turned their attention to a basketball team which
promised to be the youngest, tallest, and possibly
best Stanford team in nearly a decade.
The Cards opened their season against a USF
team which boasted top 20 preseason national
rankings and a front line averaging 6-9. Stanford
coach Howie Dallmar countered with a youthful
lineup featuring three sophomores and two
juniors. Dallmar admitted that "USF will be a
tough assignment for a young team to face in its
first game."
A nervous Stanford team took the floor on
Dec. 1 at USF's Memorial Gymnasium. The Dons
jumped out to an early lead and despite
creditable performances by Mike Mann (16
points, 12 rebounds) and Rich Kelley (12 points,
14 rebounds, eight blocked shots), countless
turnovers doomed the Cards and USF eventually
recorded an 83-68 victory.
Three days later, however, Stanford scored its
first victory of the season, defeating Arizona
75-68 before a small but appreciative Maples
Pavilion crowd. After a two week break for
finals, the Cards played seven games during
Christmas vacation, including a 77-72 loss to
eventual NIT champ Virginia Tech in the finals
of the Old Dominion Classic at Norfolk, Va.
Winning Record
When Dallmar and his squad returned home
just before New Year's Day, the Pacific Eight
Council had already granted Mike Boryla an
extra year of football eligibility and Stanford's
basketball record stood at 5-4, marking the first
time in six years that the Cards would enter
Pac-8 play with a winning record.
But when the league season began on Jan. 6 in
Pullman, Wash., the Cards continued to play an
unpredictable brand of basketball. Stanford shot
26.4 percent from the floor in a 61-49 loss to
lowly Washington State in the conference
opener, and then completely reversed gears two
nights later in Seattle, romping past Washington's
highly-rated Huskies, 76-55. TTie Cards jumped
out to a 24-2 lead in that game, and Kelley
finished the contest with 24 points and 17
rebounds.
The following week Stanford lost by a
respectable 15 points to UCLA on Friday but
played its worst basketball of the year in an
83-67 Saturday night loss against USC. Stanford
then won two in a row, including an 80-68 win at
UC Santa Barbara where freshman Tim
Patterson was 10-10 from the floor and scored
22 points.
Merlo Drafted
Meanwhile Jim Merlo was selected in the
fourth round of the NFL draft by New Orleans
and Mike Askea and Roger Cowan were also
picked. That weekend, Stanford upset UCLA in
swimming 60-53; the basketball team won its

third in a row against California; and Coach Dick
Gould's tennis squad opened its quest for the
NCAA title by winning the first annual National
Indoor tournament in Madison, Wise.
The Cards defeated North Carolina and Trinity
in the opening rounds of the team dual match
event to reach the semifinals, where Stanford
stopped USC, 6-3. In the finals the next day,
UCLA fell to the Cards by an identical 6-3 score
and the netmen were on their way to an eventful
1973 campaign.
A week later the basketball team's three game
win streak was snapped when the Cards suffered
from a turnover epidemic in the Pacific
Northwest. Oregon and Oregon State took
advantage of 53 Cardinal miscues over the
weekend as both the Ducks and the Beavers
recorded six-point victories.
Things improved slightly when the teams met
again the next week at Maples Pavilion, but the
Cards squandered a 10-point second half lead
against Oregon to spoil a weekend which began
impressively the night before with an 81-70
victory over the 18th ranked Beavers.
World Record
That same weekend four Cardinal runners
blazed around the track at Idaho State's
minidome in 1:27.4, setting a new world indoor
record for the 880 yard relay. Ken Curl, John
Kessel, Matt Hogsett, and John Anderson
comprised the record-setting team.
In the next week the cagers swept two games
from Washington and Washington State; the
tennis team cruised to an easy victory in the
Northern California Intercollegiates; and Chris
Horpel finished second in the Pac-8 wrestling
meet.
And while the basketball team was completing
its memorable weekend in Los Angeles a week
later, Payton Jordan's track squad opened its
outdoor season, splashing to a 128-31 victory
over Fresno State in rain-soaked Stanford
Stadium. In Santa Monica, Stanford finished a
disappointing fourth in the Pac-8 swimming
meet, but Cardinal swimmers turned in some
outstanding individual performances.
John Hencken set a conference record of 57.7
in the 100 yard breaststroke, touching out
teammate Brian Job, who set the old mark in last
year's meet. In the 200, however, Job edged
Olympic gold medal winner Hencken in 2:05.4.
As championship competition continued for
winter sports teams, the list of highlights
mounted. Steve Hug won the all-around title at
the Pac-8 gymnastics meet as a depleted Cardinal
squad finished third behind California and
Washington. Howard Bessen won the rings, Ted
Marcy took the side horse, and Shawn Skerrett
placed second in the vault to join Hug on the list
of NCAA qualifiers.
Hug Ties NCAA's
Hug later tied for the all-around title at the
NCAA meet in Eugene, Ore., the second straight
year the two-time Olympian had gained at least a
share of the all-around title. The swimmers were
also successful in NCAA competition, placing
sixth in the Knoxville, Tenn. meet as Hencken
won the 100 breast, Job finished second in the
200, and Dean Anderson swam to an impressive
third place finish in the 100 free. At the NCAA
wrestling meet, an injured Horpel still managed a
fifth place finish in the 142 pound weight
division.
Back at Stanford, 6652 fans watched the
Cards conclude their most successful basketball
season since 1966 with a 70-66 victory over Cal
at Maples. Seniors Bob Buell and Pat Rusco got
the Cards going, but it was Kelley who came
through in the clutch, scoring Stanford's final 14
points in a performance that clearly established
him as one of the finest players in the nation.
Stanford finished the season with a 14-11
record (7-7 in the league) and Kelley earned first
team All-Pac-8 recognition along with Bill Walton
and Keith Wilkes of UCLA, Washington's Louie
Nelson, and Oregon freshman Ron Lee.
Statistically, the talented seven footer averaged
17.3 points, 13.7 rebounds, shot 51.8 percent
from the floor, and 70.5 from the foul line.
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar was certainly
pleased with Kelley's season, and also expressed
satisfaction over the team's winning record. "We
were young and made mistakes, but it was an
exciting team to watch," Dallmar said, adding
that "we anticipate being much stronger next
year."
Spring Sports
After the last basketball game, spring sports
teams began to occupy the spotlight. Bud
Finger's golfers won their first major tournament
of the season at the Pacific Coast Invitational in
Santa Barbara, triumphing over a strong field
which included national powers USC, Long
Beach State, and Arizona State. A few days later,
however, athletic director Joseph Ruetz offered
to forfeit the championship when it was learned
that Bruce Robertson had lost his amateur status
because of a rules violation involving the sale of
golf equipment.
The USGA ruled that Robertson was no
longer an amateur, and the Stanford sophomore
was forced to withdraw from the Masters
tournament. Robertson had earned a berth in the
prestigious event by finishing sixth in the U.S.
Amateur in September and was about to leave
for Augusta, Ga. when he learned of the USGA
decision.
Stanford played without Robertson at the
University of Pacific Invitational, and the golfers
were one of four spring teams that floundered
over the weekend. The baseball team, which had
compiled a 17-8 record in non-league
competition and boasted a 12th place national
ranking, lost two out of three games to UCLA in
its conference opener; the tennis team was
shocked twice in Los Angeles, losing 6-3 to USC
and 5-4 to UCLA; the track team lost 101-50 to
defending NCAA champion UCLA; and the
golfers finished third at UOP even though George
Pettinger (Robertson's replacement) fired rounds
of 74-71 for a third place individual finish.
Things looked up at the Farm in the next few
weeks, though. Ray Young's baseball team
played well at Sunken Diamond in a three game
series against the defending national champion
USC Trojans. USC won 2-1 and 3-0, but Bob
DiPietro sandwiched a brilliant three-hit shutout
in between the two losses, blanking the Trojans,
1-0 in the first game of Saturday's doubleheader
while striking out 13.
Tennis Revenge
The next week 2500 fans jammed the varsity
tennis courts to watch the Cards avenge their
earlier losses to USC and UCLA. This time
Stanford prevailed 7-2 over the Bruins and 5-4
over the Trojans as the Cards won 10 of 12
singles matches.

On April 28, as the netmen began their
defense of the Ojai Intercollegiate tennis title,
204 players representing 34 teams swarmed over
the Stanford golf course for the sixth annual U.S.
Collegiate Invitational. The field was obviously
"quantity not quality" as only San Jose State
could mount any serious threat to the Cards.
Stanford eventually won the 54-hole event by
two strokes over the Spartans and Cardinal
sophomore Conrad Nilmeier defeated San Jose's
Phil Barry in a sudden death playoff to win the
individual title.
About the same time Nilmeier won the
sudden death playoff, freshman John Whitlinger
and Pat DuPre clinched the Ojai tennis title with
a 7-6, 3-6, 7-6 semifinal doubles victory over the
USC team of Sashi Menon-John Andrews. The
Cards finished with 16 points compared to 14 for
second place USC. UCLA was third as the "Big
Three" continued its five round struggle for
national tennis supremacy.
The following week the netmen beat Cal 8-1
to conclude a 15-2 dual match season; the
women's tennis team triumphed in the Northern
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference
tournament (Andrea Barnes won the singles title
and Whitney Grant-Terry Albert won the doubles
crown); and A 1 Arthur shutout USC 3-0 as the
Cards dropped two of three to the Trojans at
Bovard Field in Los Angeles.
Individuals Shine
Except for the baseball teams's doubleheader
sweep against UCLA (with Arthur and Dave
Frost hurling the victories), individual
accomplishments dominated the next few weeks
of sports highlights. Sandy Mayer won his second
straight Cal State tennis title, defeating South
African pro Ray Moore in the finals. Brian Job
received the A 1 Masters Award presented to the
Stanford athlete "attaining the highest degree of
leadership, athletic achievement, and
scholarship." The Biff Hoffman award for the
outstanding Stanford athlete went to gymnast
Steve Hug.
Individual achievements were also noteworthy
in the 89th Big Meet. Cal defeated the Cards
84-70 at Stanford Stadium, but freshman Terry
Albritton became the third 18 year-old in history
to put the shot 61-6V2 as he set a new meet and

school record in that event. Brian Mittlestaedt
doubled in the mile and two mile; Dave Bagshaw
won the 120 high hurdle; Ken Curl won the 100;
Jim Howard took the discus; John Anderson
won the 440; and Tom Anderson won the long
jump in other Stanford individual wins.
Tlie underdog Whites beat the Reds 14-8 as
the football squad concluded four weeks of spring
drills on May 14 with the annual Red-White
game. The play was generally sloppy, but coach
Jack Christiansen was pleased with his team's
spring progress and expressed "cautious
optimism" in anticipation of next fall's opener
against Penn State on Sept. 15.
Sweep Over Cal
A lot of fans walked over to Sunken Diamond
after the Red-White game and watched the
baseball Cards sweep a doubleheader from Cal to
end its season in second place in the Pac-8
Southern Division with a 9-9 league record. The
team finished with a 34-20 overall mark as
sophomore Bob Hampton led the hitters with a
.393 average, and Bob DiPietro (5-2, 1.30), A 1
Arthur 7-2, 1.55), and Dave Frost (6-0, 2.11)
paced the mound corps.
Hampton, DiPietro, and freshman catcher
Dave Baker were named to the Pac-8 Southern
Division all-league squad.
Pac-8 competition in tennis, track, and golf
brought disappointing results in the next few
weeks. UCLA stunned Stanford and USC to win
the tennis crown at USC's new David Marks
tennis center; the track team finished last at
Eugene, Ore.; and the golfers made a final round
charge (sparked by a 64 by Dave Baskins and a
65 by Conrad Nilmeier) but still finished second
to USC at Clarkston Golf Course in Clarkston,
Wash.
But the 1972-73 Stanford sports season is far
from complete. NCAA competition remains in
tennis, track, and golf, and two Stanford athletes
(Rich Kelley and Brian Job) and Stanford swim
coach Jim Gaughran will be touring China this
summer on goodwill tours sponsored by the
State Department.
Of course the biggest remaining event is the
NCAA tennis championships at Princeton, New
Jersey, a tournament that Dick Gould and his
Cardinal team hopes will become the undisputed
highlight of Stanford's 1972-73 sports season.

BATTLE OF THE GIANTS-UCLA's seemingly
superhuman Bill Walton appears to have
established clear superiority over Stanford
9ophomore Rich Kelley in this picture, but
Kelley proved throughout the 1972-73 basketball
season that he was among the best mortal big
men in the nation. Kelley played Walton to a
virtual statistical standoff when the Cards nearly
upset the Bruins at Pauley Pavilion. In that
contest Kelley scored 15 points and grabbed 15
rebounds while Walton turned in a 23 point, 10
rebound performance.

McCLOUD FOR THE DEFENSE Senior defensive halfback Charles McCloud dives for a possible
interception during Stanford's 10-6 victory over Duke last fall. McCloud and his fellow defensive
backs led the Pacific Eight in pass defense, but coach Jack Christiansen's Cardinals still struggled
through a disappointing 6-5 season.

NCAA CHAMPION—Two-time Olympian Steve
Hug tied for the NCAA Ail-Around title at
Eugene, Ore. in April after winning a full share of
the crown last year. Hug will be back for his
senior season next year and will be competing for
an unprecedented third NCAA All-Around title.
It is ironic that after nine months of
competition in more than 15 sports, the most
memorable moment in 1972-73 Stanford
athletics was a loss. But that defeat, a thrilling
51-45 setback against national champion UCLA
at Pauley Pavilion, culminated the successful
reversal of Cardinal basketball fortunes and
certainly marked the highlight of Stanford's
sports year.
Coach Howie Dallmar's cagers, who had
assured Stanford's first winning season since
1966 the night before with a 50-47 victory over
USC, came into the UCLA game with dreams of
an upset but without any realistic hopes of
snapping the Bruins' awesome three-year winning
streak at 69. After the first half, however, 12,489
fans sat in stunned silence as the teams departed
for the dressing rooms with Stanford ahead,
25-18.
But when the second half began, the UCLA
crowd, apparently inspired by a halftime
presentation to coach John Wooden
commemorating his silver anniversary at UCLA,
suddenly came alive. Amid deafening roars from
the Bruin rooting section, UCLA scored two
baskets in the first 30 seconds to cut the Cardinal
lead to three.
About four minutes later, referee Charles
Reed allowed an obvious dunk by UCLA's Larry
Farmer (a call which is still causing recurring
nightmares for assistant coach Bub Bowling), and
l hen with 14:57 remaining, Keith Wilkes canned
two free throws to put the Bruins ahead for the
first time since the early moments of the game.
UCLA gradually pulled away and despite some
periodic Stanford surges, eventually recorded a
51-45 victory, the Bruins' 70th straight in a
seemingly endless streak.
UCLA went on to win a unprecedented sixth
straight national title, cruising through the
NCAA tournament without any serious scares.
The Bruins' final record was 30-0, and none of
those victories was as hard-earned as the March 3
win over Stanford.
Satisfying Victories
Of course 1972-73 Stanford athletic success
was not always measured by near misses.
Stanford teams recorded countless satisfying
victories during the past year, beginning on Sept.
16, when the Cardinals celebrated Jack
Christiansen's debut as head football coach with
a 44-0 victory over San Jose State at Stanford
Stadium.
The following week things weren't quite as
easy for the Cards in Durham, North Carolina. It
took two stingy goal line stands in the final
minutes (one from the four yard line and one
from the eight) to preserve a 10-6 victory over
the Duke Blue Devils in a regionally televised
contest.
The Cards ran their unbeaten streak to three
the next Saturday with a 41-35 victory over
previously undefeated West Virginia setting up an
October 7 showdown between the 15th ranked
Cards and the number one ranked USC Trojans,
a game that elicited varied commentary from
coaches and sportswriters throughout the
preceding week.
McKay Cautious
John McKay, whose undefeated Trojans were
rated 19 point favorites, continually tried to
minimize USC's advantage. "They'll (Stanford)
be a big test for us because they're the first team
we've met this year with an acceptable running
attack to go with an acceptable passing offense."
Meanwhile Jack Christiansen was ebullient in
his praise for the Trojans. "USC has a great
team," he said of a Trojan squad that had
outscored four previous opponents 189-42. "It's
very tough to see any weaknesses."
Not everyone was talking about strengths,
weaknesses, and statistics, though. San Francisco
Chronicle columnist Glenn Dickey admitted that
USC probably had the stronger football team,
but attacked the Trojan athletic department,
which he charged "has never been able to keep
football in perspective."
"I enjoy Stanford football because the
Cardinals (nee Indians) have done admirably with
the program, making it successful and yet
keeping it in perspective," Dickey wrote."That is
not easy, as even a cursory look around the
country will show.
"This Saturday at Palo Alto the Cards host
USC, a team which has never been able to keep
football in perspective; at USC, the tail has
wagged the dog so long, it thinks it is the dog.
Though Stanford has some good players, the
Trojans appear to be too strong for the Cards —
or anybody else.
"Yet, it has appeared that way for the last
two years, and Stanford has won so I'll be there
Saturday, rooting for the forces of good to
prevail."
USC 30, Stanford 21
84,000 fans assembled in Stanford Stadium
on Saturday to watch a 30-21 USC victory which
provoked even more controversy than the
pre-game discussions.
"They're the worst winners I've ever come up
against," cried McKay after his Trojans had tried
a pass play with two seconds left and a
nine-point lead. "I'd like to beat them by 2000
points."
But McKay wasn't through. "Why is it when
we play these hotshots there are no penalties
called both ways. They've shown no class against
us."
Christiansen declined to comment on McKay's
verbal tirade. "I learned a long time ago that it's
no use getting in a contest with a skunk," Chris
said.
The game itself was sloppy but exciting.
Stanford scored first when James Ferguson
recovered a Trojan fumble in the end zone. After
two Rod Garcia field goals and two USC
touchdowns the score was tied 13-13 with 1:24
left in the first half.
But when the Cards got set to punt, center
Bill Reid's snap sailed over Dave Ottmar's head
and USC defensive end James Sims recovered on
Stanford's five yard line. Two plays later
Anthony Davis scored to give the Trojans a 20-13
halftime advantage.
Toughest For Trojans
USC controlled the second half and eventually
recorded its nine point victory. It was easily the
toughest game of the year for the undefeated
national champions, but it was a victory which all
but eliminated the Cards from Rose Bowl
contention.
Christiansen, however, refused to give up. "I
don't think we're out of it [Rose Bowl race) by
any means," he said. "We still have a great
chance."

The Cards' dim Rose Bowl hopes stayed alive
the following week when Stanford scored an
impressive 24-0 victory over an undefeated
Washington team, but a week later Dan Fouts
and the Oregon Ducks ended any thoughts of
New Year's Day in Pasadena with a 15-13 upset
in Eugene.
Stanford then defeated Oregon State (as Rod
Garcia became the most prolific field goal kicker
in Stanford history with his 22nd career field
goal), lost to UCLA 28-23 at the Los Angeles
Coliseum, and lost to Washington State 27-13 in
Pullman as Mike Boryla spent most of the
afternoon on his back.
Stanford's grid record stood at a dismal 5-4
as the Cards prepared for the Big Game in
Berkeley. The game had no real significance as
far as the Pac-8 race was concerned. The
traditional Big Game bonfire was cancelled and
the Band's activities in San Francisco were
curtailed by a police ordinance, but emotions
were still high on both sides for the 75th renewal
of the Big Game rivalry.
"The significance of the game goes without
saying," said Cal coach Mike White, who was
struggling though his first year as the Bears' head
coach after assisting John Ralston at Stanford.
"I have a lot of friends at Stanford, most of
them players, and I respect them. I know they'd
like to beat the hell out of me because that's the
way it is in athletics."
Mud Bowl
The "Big Game Mud Bowl" was played on a
field Christiansen called "the worst I've ever
seen," but 68,000 fans were treated to one of the
most thrilling football games in recent memory.
With four seconds left on the clock, Cal had the
ball on the Stanford seven yard line. It was
fourth down, Cal trailed 21-18, and everyone at
California Memorial Stadium expected a field
goal attempt.
But freshman quarterback Vince Ferragamo
broke out of the huddle and strode confidently
to the line of scrimmage for one final play. He
dropped back, rolled to his right, and with no
time on the clock threw a perfect strike to Steve
Sweeney in the left corner of the end zone.
"I never thought of going for a tie," said an
elated White. "This game means too much."
The Cards were idle the following week, but

during that period Rod Garcia, Jim Merlo, and
Randy Poltl were named to the first team
All-Pacific Eight squad and Merlo, Poltl and
Younger Klippert were selected to the AP's
All-Coast first team.
Eric Cross was only an honorable mention
all-league selection, but on Dec. 2 in Honolulu the
5-10 senior made the selection committee think
twice about its first team receivers. Cross caught
14 passes and took over the Pac-8 lead with 53 as
the Cards ripped the Hawaii Rainbows 39-7. He
also tied the Stanford record with his ninth
touchdown reception of the season and broke
the Pac-8 record for single game catches.
Stanford's final point of the season was scored
by Steve Murray, who kicked the extra point
after Stanford's last score. Murray, who normally
held for Rod Garcia, booted the ball squarely
through the uprights as the two reversed roles for
the final play.
The team's final record was a disappointing
6-5 (2-5 in the league), but while the varsity was
struggling against Pac-8 opponents, the Card
junior varsity recorded Stanford's first
undefeated JV season since 1965. First year
coahc Hudson Houck directed his team to a 4-0
record, including two shutous.
The Cards outscored their opponents 143-22
and while the offense rolled up over 900 yards
on the ground, the defense held four opponents
to a meager 51 net yards rushing.
The cross country ttam also completed a
successful season, winning the Pac-8 Southern
Division title before finishing fourth in the Pac-8
meet. Brian Mittelstaedt and Tony Sandoval
placed 1-2 in the Southern Division event at the
Stanford golf course.
Women Win
The women's swimming team added another
highlight to Stanford's fall quarter collection,
winning the 12-team Northern California
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference meet in
Sacramento.
After the final Pac-8 football statistics (which
showed Mike Boryla leading the league in total
offense and passing and Eric Cross on top of the
receiving charts) were released, Stanford fans
turned their attention to a basketball team which
promised to be the youngest, tallest, and possibly
best Stanford team in nearly a decade.
The Cards opened their season against a USF
team which boasted top 20 preseason national
rankings and a front line averaging 6-9. Stanford
coach Howie Dallmar countered with a youthful
lineup featuring three sophomores and two
juniors. Dallmar admitted that "USF will be a
tough assignment for a young team to face in its
first game."
A nervous Stanford team took the floor on
Dec. 1 at USF's Memorial Gymnasium. The Dons
jumped out to an early lead and despite
creditable performances by Mike Mann (16
points, 12 rebounds) and Rich Kelley (12 points,
14 rebounds, eight blocked shots), countless
turnovers doomed the Cards and USF eventually
recorded an 83-68 victory.
Three days later, however, Stanford scored its
first victory of the season, defeating Arizona
75-68 before a small but appreciative Maples
Pavilion crowd. After a two week break for
finals, the Cards played seven games during
Christmas vacation, including a 77-72 loss to
eventual NIT champ Virginia Tech in the finals
of the Old Dominion Classic at Norfolk, Va.
Winning Record
When Dallmar and his squad returned home
just before New Year's Day, the Pacific Eight
Council had already granted Mike Boryla an
extra year of football eligibility and Stanford's
basketball record stood at 5-4, marking the first
time in six years that the Cards would enter
Pac-8 play with a winning record.
But when the league season began on Jan. 6 in
Pullman, Wash., the Cards continued to play an
unpredictable brand of basketball. Stanford shot
26.4 percent from the floor in a 61-49 loss to
lowly Washington State in the conference
opener, and then completely reversed gears two
nights later in Seattle, romping past Washington's
highly-rated Huskies, 76-55. TTie Cards jumped
out to a 24-2 lead in that game, and Kelley
finished the contest with 24 points and 17
rebounds.
The following week Stanford lost by a
respectable 15 points to UCLA on Friday but
played its worst basketball of the year in an
83-67 Saturday night loss against USC. Stanford
then won two in a row, including an 80-68 win at
UC Santa Barbara where freshman Tim
Patterson was 10-10 from the floor and scored
22 points.
Merlo Drafted
Meanwhile Jim Merlo was selected in the
fourth round of the NFL draft by New Orleans
and Mike Askea and Roger Cowan were also
picked. That weekend, Stanford upset UCLA in
swimming 60-53; the basketball team won its

third in a row against California; and Coach Dick
Gould's tennis squad opened its quest for the
NCAA title by winning the first annual National
Indoor tournament in Madison, Wise.
The Cards defeated North Carolina and Trinity
in the opening rounds of the team dual match
event to reach the semifinals, where Stanford
stopped USC, 6-3. In the finals the next day,
UCLA fell to the Cards by an identical 6-3 score
and the netmen were on their way to an eventful
1973 campaign.
A week later the basketball team's three game
win streak was snapped when the Cards suffered
from a turnover epidemic in the Pacific
Northwest. Oregon and Oregon State took
advantage of 53 Cardinal miscues over the
weekend as both the Ducks and the Beavers
recorded six-point victories.
Things improved slightly when the teams met
again the next week at Maples Pavilion, but the
Cards squandered a 10-point second half lead
against Oregon to spoil a weekend which began
impressively the night before with an 81-70
victory over the 18th ranked Beavers.
World Record
That same weekend four Cardinal runners
blazed around the track at Idaho State's
minidome in 1:27.4, setting a new world indoor
record for the 880 yard relay. Ken Curl, John
Kessel, Matt Hogsett, and John Anderson
comprised the record-setting team.
In the next week the cagers swept two games
from Washington and Washington State; the
tennis team cruised to an easy victory in the
Northern California Intercollegiates; and Chris
Horpel finished second in the Pac-8 wrestling
meet.
And while the basketball team was completing
its memorable weekend in Los Angeles a week
later, Payton Jordan's track squad opened its
outdoor season, splashing to a 128-31 victory
over Fresno State in rain-soaked Stanford
Stadium. In Santa Monica, Stanford finished a
disappointing fourth in the Pac-8 swimming
meet, but Cardinal swimmers turned in some
outstanding individual performances.
John Hencken set a conference record of 57.7
in the 100 yard breaststroke, touching out
teammate Brian Job, who set the old mark in last
year's meet. In the 200, however, Job edged
Olympic gold medal winner Hencken in 2:05.4.
As championship competition continued for
winter sports teams, the list of highlights
mounted. Steve Hug won the all-around title at
the Pac-8 gymnastics meet as a depleted Cardinal
squad finished third behind California and
Washington. Howard Bessen won the rings, Ted
Marcy took the side horse, and Shawn Skerrett
placed second in the vault to join Hug on the list
of NCAA qualifiers.
Hug Ties NCAA's
Hug later tied for the all-around title at the
NCAA meet in Eugene, Ore., the second straight
year the two-time Olympian had gained at least a
share of the all-around title. The swimmers were
also successful in NCAA competition, placing
sixth in the Knoxville, Tenn. meet as Hencken
won the 100 breast, Job finished second in the
200, and Dean Anderson swam to an impressive
third place finish in the 100 free. At the NCAA
wrestling meet, an injured Horpel still managed a
fifth place finish in the 142 pound weight
division.
Back at Stanford, 6652 fans watched the
Cards conclude their most successful basketball
season since 1966 with a 70-66 victory over Cal
at Maples. Seniors Bob Buell and Pat Rusco got
the Cards going, but it was Kelley who came
through in the clutch, scoring Stanford's final 14
points in a performance that clearly established
him as one of the finest players in the nation.
Stanford finished the season with a 14-11
record (7-7 in the league) and Kelley earned first
team All-Pac-8 recognition along with Bill Walton
and Keith Wilkes of UCLA, Washington's Louie
Nelson, and Oregon freshman Ron Lee.
Statistically, the talented seven footer averaged
17.3 points, 13.7 rebounds, shot 51.8 percent
from the floor, and 70.5 from the foul line.
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar was certainly
pleased with Kelley's season, and also expressed
satisfaction over the team's winning record. "We
were young and made mistakes, but it was an
exciting team to watch," Dallmar said, adding
that "we anticipate being much stronger next
year."
Spring Sports
After the last basketball game, spring sports
teams began to occupy the spotlight. Bud
Finger's golfers won their first major tournament
of the season at the Pacific Coast Invitational in
Santa Barbara, triumphing over a strong field
which included national powers USC, Long
Beach State, and Arizona State. A few days later,
however, athletic director Joseph Ruetz offered
to forfeit the championship when it was learned
that Bruce Robertson had lost his amateur status
because of a rules violation involving the sale of
golf equipment.
The USGA ruled that Robertson was no
longer an amateur, and the Stanford sophomore
was forced to withdraw from the Masters
tournament. Robertson had earned a berth in the
prestigious event by finishing sixth in the U.S.
Amateur in September and was about to leave
for Augusta, Ga. when he learned of the USGA
decision.
Stanford played without Robertson at the
University of Pacific Invitational, and the golfers
were one of four spring teams that floundered
over the weekend. The baseball team, which had
compiled a 17-8 record in non-league
competition and boasted a 12th place national
ranking, lost two out of three games to UCLA in
its conference opener; the tennis team was
shocked twice in Los Angeles, losing 6-3 to USC
and 5-4 to UCLA; the track team lost 101-50 to
defending NCAA champion UCLA; and the
golfers finished third at UOP even though George
Pettinger (Robertson's replacement) fired rounds
of 74-71 for a third place individual finish.
Things looked up at the Farm in the next few
weeks, though. Ray Young's baseball team
played well at Sunken Diamond in a three game
series against the defending national champion
USC Trojans. USC won 2-1 and 3-0, but Bob
DiPietro sandwiched a brilliant three-hit shutout
in between the two losses, blanking the Trojans,
1-0 in the first game of Saturday's doubleheader
while striking out 13.
Tennis Revenge
The next week 2500 fans jammed the varsity
tennis courts to watch the Cards avenge their
earlier losses to USC and UCLA. This time
Stanford prevailed 7-2 over the Bruins and 5-4
over the Trojans as the Cards won 10 of 12
singles matches.

On April 28, as the netmen began their
defense of the Ojai Intercollegiate tennis title,
204 players representing 34 teams swarmed over
the Stanford golf course for the sixth annual U.S.
Collegiate Invitational. The field was obviously
"quantity not quality" as only San Jose State
could mount any serious threat to the Cards.
Stanford eventually won the 54-hole event by
two strokes over the Spartans and Cardinal
sophomore Conrad Nilmeier defeated San Jose's
Phil Barry in a sudden death playoff to win the
individual title.
About the same time Nilmeier won the
sudden death playoff, freshman John Whitlinger
and Pat DuPre clinched the Ojai tennis title with
a 7-6, 3-6, 7-6 semifinal doubles victory over the
USC team of Sashi Menon-John Andrews. The
Cards finished with 16 points compared to 14 for
second place USC. UCLA was third as the "Big
Three" continued its five round struggle for
national tennis supremacy.
The following week the netmen beat Cal 8-1
to conclude a 15-2 dual match season; the
women's tennis team triumphed in the Northern
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference
tournament (Andrea Barnes won the singles title
and Whitney Grant-Terry Albert won the doubles
crown); and A 1 Arthur shutout USC 3-0 as the
Cards dropped two of three to the Trojans at
Bovard Field in Los Angeles.
Individuals Shine
Except for the baseball teams's doubleheader
sweep against UCLA (with Arthur and Dave
Frost hurling the victories), individual
accomplishments dominated the next few weeks
of sports highlights. Sandy Mayer won his second
straight Cal State tennis title, defeating South
African pro Ray Moore in the finals. Brian Job
received the A 1 Masters Award presented to the
Stanford athlete "attaining the highest degree of
leadership, athletic achievement, and
scholarship." The Biff Hoffman award for the
outstanding Stanford athlete went to gymnast
Steve Hug.
Individual achievements were also noteworthy
in the 89th Big Meet. Cal defeated the Cards
84-70 at Stanford Stadium, but freshman Terry
Albritton became the third 18 year-old in history
to put the shot 61-6V2 as he set a new meet and

school record in that event. Brian Mittlestaedt
doubled in the mile and two mile; Dave Bagshaw
won the 120 high hurdle; Ken Curl won the 100;
Jim Howard took the discus; John Anderson
won the 440; and Tom Anderson won the long
jump in other Stanford individual wins.
Tlie underdog Whites beat the Reds 14-8 as
the football squad concluded four weeks of spring
drills on May 14 with the annual Red-White
game. The play was generally sloppy, but coach
Jack Christiansen was pleased with his team's
spring progress and expressed "cautious
optimism" in anticipation of next fall's opener
against Penn State on Sept. 15.
Sweep Over Cal
A lot of fans walked over to Sunken Diamond
after the Red-White game and watched the
baseball Cards sweep a doubleheader from Cal to
end its season in second place in the Pac-8
Southern Division with a 9-9 league record. The
team finished with a 34-20 overall mark as
sophomore Bob Hampton led the hitters with a
.393 average, and Bob DiPietro (5-2, 1.30), A 1
Arthur 7-2, 1.55), and Dave Frost (6-0, 2.11)
paced the mound corps.
Hampton, DiPietro, and freshman catcher
Dave Baker were named to the Pac-8 Southern
Division all-league squad.
Pac-8 competition in tennis, track, and golf
brought disappointing results in the next few
weeks. UCLA stunned Stanford and USC to win
the tennis crown at USC's new David Marks
tennis center; the track team finished last at
Eugene, Ore.; and the golfers made a final round
charge (sparked by a 64 by Dave Baskins and a
65 by Conrad Nilmeier) but still finished second
to USC at Clarkston Golf Course in Clarkston,
Wash.
But the 1972-73 Stanford sports season is far
from complete. NCAA competition remains in
tennis, track, and golf, and two Stanford athletes
(Rich Kelley and Brian Job) and Stanford swim
coach Jim Gaughran will be touring China this
summer on goodwill tours sponsored by the
State Department.
Of course the biggest remaining event is the
NCAA tennis championships at Princeton, New
Jersey, a tournament that Dick Gould and his
Cardinal team hopes will become the undisputed
highlight of Stanford's 1972-73 sports season.

BATTLE OF THE GIANTS-UCLA's seemingly
superhuman Bill Walton appears to have
established clear superiority over Stanford
9ophomore Rich Kelley in this picture, but
Kelley proved throughout the 1972-73 basketball
season that he was among the best mortal big
men in the nation. Kelley played Walton to a
virtual statistical standoff when the Cards nearly
upset the Bruins at Pauley Pavilion. In that
contest Kelley scored 15 points and grabbed 15
rebounds while Walton turned in a 23 point, 10
rebound performance.

McCLOUD FOR THE DEFENSE Senior defensive halfback Charles McCloud dives for a possible
interception during Stanford's 10-6 victory over Duke last fall. McCloud and his fellow defensive
backs led the Pacific Eight in pass defense, but coach Jack Christiansen's Cardinals still struggled
through a disappointing 6-5 season.

NCAA CHAMPION—Two-time Olympian Steve
Hug tied for the NCAA Ail-Around title at
Eugene, Ore. in April after winning a full share of
the crown last year. Hug will be back for his
senior season next year and will be competing for
an unprecedented third NCAA All-Around title.
It is ironic that after nine months of
competition in more than 15 sports, the most
memorable moment in 1972-73 Stanford
athletics was a loss. But that defeat, a thrilling
51-45 setback against national champion UCLA
at Pauley Pavilion, culminated the successful
reversal of Cardinal basketball fortunes and
certainly marked the highlight of Stanford's
sports year.
Coach Howie Dallmar's cagers, who had
assured Stanford's first winning season since
1966 the night before with a 50-47 victory over
USC, came into the UCLA game with dreams of
an upset but without any realistic hopes of
snapping the Bruins' awesome three-year winning
streak at 69. After the first half, however, 12,489
fans sat in stunned silence as the teams departed
for the dressing rooms with Stanford ahead,
25-18.
But when the second half began, the UCLA
crowd, apparently inspired by a halftime
presentation to coach John Wooden
commemorating his silver anniversary at UCLA,
suddenly came alive. Amid deafening roars from
the Bruin rooting section, UCLA scored two
baskets in the first 30 seconds to cut the Cardinal
lead to three.
About four minutes later, referee Charles
Reed allowed an obvious dunk by UCLA's Larry
Farmer (a call which is still causing recurring
nightmares for assistant coach Bub Bowling), and
l hen with 14:57 remaining, Keith Wilkes canned
two free throws to put the Bruins ahead for the
first time since the early moments of the game.
UCLA gradually pulled away and despite some
periodic Stanford surges, eventually recorded a
51-45 victory, the Bruins' 70th straight in a
seemingly endless streak.
UCLA went on to win a unprecedented sixth
straight national title, cruising through the
NCAA tournament without any serious scares.
The Bruins' final record was 30-0, and none of
those victories was as hard-earned as the March 3
win over Stanford.
Satisfying Victories
Of course 1972-73 Stanford athletic success
was not always measured by near misses.
Stanford teams recorded countless satisfying
victories during the past year, beginning on Sept.
16, when the Cardinals celebrated Jack
Christiansen's debut as head football coach with
a 44-0 victory over San Jose State at Stanford
Stadium.
The following week things weren't quite as
easy for the Cards in Durham, North Carolina. It
took two stingy goal line stands in the final
minutes (one from the four yard line and one
from the eight) to preserve a 10-6 victory over
the Duke Blue Devils in a regionally televised
contest.
The Cards ran their unbeaten streak to three
the next Saturday with a 41-35 victory over
previously undefeated West Virginia setting up an
October 7 showdown between the 15th ranked
Cards and the number one ranked USC Trojans,
a game that elicited varied commentary from
coaches and sportswriters throughout the
preceding week.
McKay Cautious
John McKay, whose undefeated Trojans were
rated 19 point favorites, continually tried to
minimize USC's advantage. "They'll (Stanford)
be a big test for us because they're the first team
we've met this year with an acceptable running
attack to go with an acceptable passing offense."
Meanwhile Jack Christiansen was ebullient in
his praise for the Trojans. "USC has a great
team," he said of a Trojan squad that had
outscored four previous opponents 189-42. "It's
very tough to see any weaknesses."
Not everyone was talking about strengths,
weaknesses, and statistics, though. San Francisco
Chronicle columnist Glenn Dickey admitted that
USC probably had the stronger football team,
but attacked the Trojan athletic department,
which he charged "has never been able to keep
football in perspective."
"I enjoy Stanford football because the
Cardinals (nee Indians) have done admirably with
the program, making it successful and yet
keeping it in perspective," Dickey wrote."That is
not easy, as even a cursory look around the
country will show.
"This Saturday at Palo Alto the Cards host
USC, a team which has never been able to keep
football in perspective; at USC, the tail has
wagged the dog so long, it thinks it is the dog.
Though Stanford has some good players, the
Trojans appear to be too strong for the Cards —
or anybody else.
"Yet, it has appeared that way for the last
two years, and Stanford has won so I'll be there
Saturday, rooting for the forces of good to
prevail."
USC 30, Stanford 21
84,000 fans assembled in Stanford Stadium
on Saturday to watch a 30-21 USC victory which
provoked even more controversy than the
pre-game discussions.
"They're the worst winners I've ever come up
against," cried McKay after his Trojans had tried
a pass play with two seconds left and a
nine-point lead. "I'd like to beat them by 2000
points."
But McKay wasn't through. "Why is it when
we play these hotshots there are no penalties
called both ways. They've shown no class against
us."
Christiansen declined to comment on McKay's
verbal tirade. "I learned a long time ago that it's
no use getting in a contest with a skunk," Chris
said.
The game itself was sloppy but exciting.
Stanford scored first when James Ferguson
recovered a Trojan fumble in the end zone. After
two Rod Garcia field goals and two USC
touchdowns the score was tied 13-13 with 1:24
left in the first half.
But when the Cards got set to punt, center
Bill Reid's snap sailed over Dave Ottmar's head
and USC defensive end James Sims recovered on
Stanford's five yard line. Two plays later
Anthony Davis scored to give the Trojans a 20-13
halftime advantage.
Toughest For Trojans
USC controlled the second half and eventually
recorded its nine point victory. It was easily the
toughest game of the year for the undefeated
national champions, but it was a victory which all
but eliminated the Cards from Rose Bowl
contention.
Christiansen, however, refused to give up. "I
don't think we're out of it [Rose Bowl race) by
any means," he said. "We still have a great
chance."

The Cards' dim Rose Bowl hopes stayed alive
the following week when Stanford scored an
impressive 24-0 victory over an undefeated
Washington team, but a week later Dan Fouts
and the Oregon Ducks ended any thoughts of
New Year's Day in Pasadena with a 15-13 upset
in Eugene.
Stanford then defeated Oregon State (as Rod
Garcia became the most prolific field goal kicker
in Stanford history with his 22nd career field
goal), lost to UCLA 28-23 at the Los Angeles
Coliseum, and lost to Washington State 27-13 in
Pullman as Mike Boryla spent most of the
afternoon on his back.
Stanford's grid record stood at a dismal 5-4
as the Cards prepared for the Big Game in
Berkeley. The game had no real significance as
far as the Pac-8 race was concerned. The
traditional Big Game bonfire was cancelled and
the Band's activities in San Francisco were
curtailed by a police ordinance, but emotions
were still high on both sides for the 75th renewal
of the Big Game rivalry.
"The significance of the game goes without
saying," said Cal coach Mike White, who was
struggling though his first year as the Bears' head
coach after assisting John Ralston at Stanford.
"I have a lot of friends at Stanford, most of
them players, and I respect them. I know they'd
like to beat the hell out of me because that's the
way it is in athletics."
Mud Bowl
The "Big Game Mud Bowl" was played on a
field Christiansen called "the worst I've ever
seen," but 68,000 fans were treated to one of the
most thrilling football games in recent memory.
With four seconds left on the clock, Cal had the
ball on the Stanford seven yard line. It was
fourth down, Cal trailed 21-18, and everyone at
California Memorial Stadium expected a field
goal attempt.
But freshman quarterback Vince Ferragamo
broke out of the huddle and strode confidently
to the line of scrimmage for one final play. He
dropped back, rolled to his right, and with no
time on the clock threw a perfect strike to Steve
Sweeney in the left corner of the end zone.
"I never thought of going for a tie," said an
elated White. "This game means too much."
The Cards were idle the following week, but

during that period Rod Garcia, Jim Merlo, and
Randy Poltl were named to the first team
All-Pacific Eight squad and Merlo, Poltl and
Younger Klippert were selected to the AP's
All-Coast first team.
Eric Cross was only an honorable mention
all-league selection, but on Dec. 2 in Honolulu the
5-10 senior made the selection committee think
twice about its first team receivers. Cross caught
14 passes and took over the Pac-8 lead with 53 as
the Cards ripped the Hawaii Rainbows 39-7. He
also tied the Stanford record with his ninth
touchdown reception of the season and broke
the Pac-8 record for single game catches.
Stanford's final point of the season was scored
by Steve Murray, who kicked the extra point
after Stanford's last score. Murray, who normally
held for Rod Garcia, booted the ball squarely
through the uprights as the two reversed roles for
the final play.
The team's final record was a disappointing
6-5 (2-5 in the league), but while the varsity was
struggling against Pac-8 opponents, the Card
junior varsity recorded Stanford's first
undefeated JV season since 1965. First year
coahc Hudson Houck directed his team to a 4-0
record, including two shutous.
The Cards outscored their opponents 143-22
and while the offense rolled up over 900 yards
on the ground, the defense held four opponents
to a meager 51 net yards rushing.
The cross country ttam also completed a
successful season, winning the Pac-8 Southern
Division title before finishing fourth in the Pac-8
meet. Brian Mittelstaedt and Tony Sandoval
placed 1-2 in the Southern Division event at the
Stanford golf course.
Women Win
The women's swimming team added another
highlight to Stanford's fall quarter collection,
winning the 12-team Northern California
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference meet in
Sacramento.
After the final Pac-8 football statistics (which
showed Mike Boryla leading the league in total
offense and passing and Eric Cross on top of the
receiving charts) were released, Stanford fans
turned their attention to a basketball team which
promised to be the youngest, tallest, and possibly
best Stanford team in nearly a decade.
The Cards opened their season against a USF
team which boasted top 20 preseason national
rankings and a front line averaging 6-9. Stanford
coach Howie Dallmar countered with a youthful
lineup featuring three sophomores and two
juniors. Dallmar admitted that "USF will be a
tough assignment for a young team to face in its
first game."
A nervous Stanford team took the floor on
Dec. 1 at USF's Memorial Gymnasium. The Dons
jumped out to an early lead and despite
creditable performances by Mike Mann (16
points, 12 rebounds) and Rich Kelley (12 points,
14 rebounds, eight blocked shots), countless
turnovers doomed the Cards and USF eventually
recorded an 83-68 victory.
Three days later, however, Stanford scored its
first victory of the season, defeating Arizona
75-68 before a small but appreciative Maples
Pavilion crowd. After a two week break for
finals, the Cards played seven games during
Christmas vacation, including a 77-72 loss to
eventual NIT champ Virginia Tech in the finals
of the Old Dominion Classic at Norfolk, Va.
Winning Record
When Dallmar and his squad returned home
just before New Year's Day, the Pacific Eight
Council had already granted Mike Boryla an
extra year of football eligibility and Stanford's
basketball record stood at 5-4, marking the first
time in six years that the Cards would enter
Pac-8 play with a winning record.
But when the league season began on Jan. 6 in
Pullman, Wash., the Cards continued to play an
unpredictable brand of basketball. Stanford shot
26.4 percent from the floor in a 61-49 loss to
lowly Washington State in the conference
opener, and then completely reversed gears two
nights later in Seattle, romping past Washington's
highly-rated Huskies, 76-55. TTie Cards jumped
out to a 24-2 lead in that game, and Kelley
finished the contest with 24 points and 17
rebounds.
The following week Stanford lost by a
respectable 15 points to UCLA on Friday but
played its worst basketball of the year in an
83-67 Saturday night loss against USC. Stanford
then won two in a row, including an 80-68 win at
UC Santa Barbara where freshman Tim
Patterson was 10-10 from the floor and scored
22 points.
Merlo Drafted
Meanwhile Jim Merlo was selected in the
fourth round of the NFL draft by New Orleans
and Mike Askea and Roger Cowan were also
picked. That weekend, Stanford upset UCLA in
swimming 60-53; the basketball team won its

third in a row against California; and Coach Dick
Gould's tennis squad opened its quest for the
NCAA title by winning the first annual National
Indoor tournament in Madison, Wise.
The Cards defeated North Carolina and Trinity
in the opening rounds of the team dual match
event to reach the semifinals, where Stanford
stopped USC, 6-3. In the finals the next day,
UCLA fell to the Cards by an identical 6-3 score
and the netmen were on their way to an eventful
1973 campaign.
A week later the basketball team's three game
win streak was snapped when the Cards suffered
from a turnover epidemic in the Pacific
Northwest. Oregon and Oregon State took
advantage of 53 Cardinal miscues over the
weekend as both the Ducks and the Beavers
recorded six-point victories.
Things improved slightly when the teams met
again the next week at Maples Pavilion, but the
Cards squandered a 10-point second half lead
against Oregon to spoil a weekend which began
impressively the night before with an 81-70
victory over the 18th ranked Beavers.
World Record
That same weekend four Cardinal runners
blazed around the track at Idaho State's
minidome in 1:27.4, setting a new world indoor
record for the 880 yard relay. Ken Curl, John
Kessel, Matt Hogsett, and John Anderson
comprised the record-setting team.
In the next week the cagers swept two games
from Washington and Washington State; the
tennis team cruised to an easy victory in the
Northern California Intercollegiates; and Chris
Horpel finished second in the Pac-8 wrestling
meet.
And while the basketball team was completing
its memorable weekend in Los Angeles a week
later, Payton Jordan's track squad opened its
outdoor season, splashing to a 128-31 victory
over Fresno State in rain-soaked Stanford
Stadium. In Santa Monica, Stanford finished a
disappointing fourth in the Pac-8 swimming
meet, but Cardinal swimmers turned in some
outstanding individual performances.
John Hencken set a conference record of 57.7
in the 100 yard breaststroke, touching out
teammate Brian Job, who set the old mark in last
year's meet. In the 200, however, Job edged
Olympic gold medal winner Hencken in 2:05.4.
As championship competition continued for
winter sports teams, the list of highlights
mounted. Steve Hug won the all-around title at
the Pac-8 gymnastics meet as a depleted Cardinal
squad finished third behind California and
Washington. Howard Bessen won the rings, Ted
Marcy took the side horse, and Shawn Skerrett
placed second in the vault to join Hug on the list
of NCAA qualifiers.
Hug Ties NCAA's
Hug later tied for the all-around title at the
NCAA meet in Eugene, Ore., the second straight
year the two-time Olympian had gained at least a
share of the all-around title. The swimmers were
also successful in NCAA competition, placing
sixth in the Knoxville, Tenn. meet as Hencken
won the 100 breast, Job finished second in the
200, and Dean Anderson swam to an impressive
third place finish in the 100 free. At the NCAA
wrestling meet, an injured Horpel still managed a
fifth place finish in the 142 pound weight
division.
Back at Stanford, 6652 fans watched the
Cards conclude their most successful basketball
season since 1966 with a 70-66 victory over Cal
at Maples. Seniors Bob Buell and Pat Rusco got
the Cards going, but it was Kelley who came
through in the clutch, scoring Stanford's final 14
points in a performance that clearly established
him as one of the finest players in the nation.
Stanford finished the season with a 14-11
record (7-7 in the league) and Kelley earned first
team All-Pac-8 recognition along with Bill Walton
and Keith Wilkes of UCLA, Washington's Louie
Nelson, and Oregon freshman Ron Lee.
Statistically, the talented seven footer averaged
17.3 points, 13.7 rebounds, shot 51.8 percent
from the floor, and 70.5 from the foul line.
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar was certainly
pleased with Kelley's season, and also expressed
satisfaction over the team's winning record. "We
were young and made mistakes, but it was an
exciting team to watch," Dallmar said, adding
that "we anticipate being much stronger next
year."
Spring Sports
After the last basketball game, spring sports
teams began to occupy the spotlight. Bud
Finger's golfers won their first major tournament
of the season at the Pacific Coast Invitational in
Santa Barbara, triumphing over a strong field
which included national powers USC, Long
Beach State, and Arizona State. A few days later,
however, athletic director Joseph Ruetz offered
to forfeit the championship when it was learned
that Bruce Robertson had lost his amateur status
because of a rules violation involving the sale of
golf equipment.
The USGA ruled that Robertson was no
longer an amateur, and the Stanford sophomore
was forced to withdraw from the Masters
tournament. Robertson had earned a berth in the
prestigious event by finishing sixth in the U.S.
Amateur in September and was about to leave
for Augusta, Ga. when he learned of the USGA
decision.
Stanford played without Robertson at the
University of Pacific Invitational, and the golfers
were one of four spring teams that floundered
over the weekend. The baseball team, which had
compiled a 17-8 record in non-league
competition and boasted a 12th place national
ranking, lost two out of three games to UCLA in
its conference opener; the tennis team was
shocked twice in Los Angeles, losing 6-3 to USC
and 5-4 to UCLA; the track team lost 101-50 to
defending NCAA champion UCLA; and the
golfers finished third at UOP even though George
Pettinger (Robertson's replacement) fired rounds
of 74-71 for a third place individual finish.
Things looked up at the Farm in the next few
weeks, though. Ray Young's baseball team
played well at Sunken Diamond in a three game
series against the defending national champion
USC Trojans. USC won 2-1 and 3-0, but Bob
DiPietro sandwiched a brilliant three-hit shutout
in between the two losses, blanking the Trojans,
1-0 in the first game of Saturday's doubleheader
while striking out 13.
Tennis Revenge
The next week 2500 fans jammed the varsity
tennis courts to watch the Cards avenge their
earlier losses to USC and UCLA. This time
Stanford prevailed 7-2 over the Bruins and 5-4
over the Trojans as the Cards won 10 of 12
singles matches.

On April 28, as the netmen began their
defense of the Ojai Intercollegiate tennis title,
204 players representing 34 teams swarmed over
the Stanford golf course for the sixth annual U.S.
Collegiate Invitational. The field was obviously
"quantity not quality" as only San Jose State
could mount any serious threat to the Cards.
Stanford eventually won the 54-hole event by
two strokes over the Spartans and Cardinal
sophomore Conrad Nilmeier defeated San Jose's
Phil Barry in a sudden death playoff to win the
individual title.
About the same time Nilmeier won the
sudden death playoff, freshman John Whitlinger
and Pat DuPre clinched the Ojai tennis title with
a 7-6, 3-6, 7-6 semifinal doubles victory over the
USC team of Sashi Menon-John Andrews. The
Cards finished with 16 points compared to 14 for
second place USC. UCLA was third as the "Big
Three" continued its five round struggle for
national tennis supremacy.
The following week the netmen beat Cal 8-1
to conclude a 15-2 dual match season; the
women's tennis team triumphed in the Northern
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference
tournament (Andrea Barnes won the singles title
and Whitney Grant-Terry Albert won the doubles
crown); and A 1 Arthur shutout USC 3-0 as the
Cards dropped two of three to the Trojans at
Bovard Field in Los Angeles.
Individuals Shine
Except for the baseball teams's doubleheader
sweep against UCLA (with Arthur and Dave
Frost hurling the victories), individual
accomplishments dominated the next few weeks
of sports highlights. Sandy Mayer won his second
straight Cal State tennis title, defeating South
African pro Ray Moore in the finals. Brian Job
received the A 1 Masters Award presented to the
Stanford athlete "attaining the highest degree of
leadership, athletic achievement, and
scholarship." The Biff Hoffman award for the
outstanding Stanford athlete went to gymnast
Steve Hug.
Individual achievements were also noteworthy
in the 89th Big Meet. Cal defeated the Cards
84-70 at Stanford Stadium, but freshman Terry
Albritton became the third 18 year-old in history
to put the shot 61-6V2 as he set a new meet and

school record in that event. Brian Mittlestaedt
doubled in the mile and two mile; Dave Bagshaw
won the 120 high hurdle; Ken Curl won the 100;
Jim Howard took the discus; John Anderson
won the 440; and Tom Anderson won the long
jump in other Stanford individual wins.
Tlie underdog Whites beat the Reds 14-8 as
the football squad concluded four weeks of spring
drills on May 14 with the annual Red-White
game. The play was generally sloppy, but coach
Jack Christiansen was pleased with his team's
spring progress and expressed "cautious
optimism" in anticipation of next fall's opener
against Penn State on Sept. 15.
Sweep Over Cal
A lot of fans walked over to Sunken Diamond
after the Red-White game and watched the
baseball Cards sweep a doubleheader from Cal to
end its season in second place in the Pac-8
Southern Division with a 9-9 league record. The
team finished with a 34-20 overall mark as
sophomore Bob Hampton led the hitters with a
.393 average, and Bob DiPietro (5-2, 1.30), A 1
Arthur 7-2, 1.55), and Dave Frost (6-0, 2.11)
paced the mound corps.
Hampton, DiPietro, and freshman catcher
Dave Baker were named to the Pac-8 Southern
Division all-league squad.
Pac-8 competition in tennis, track, and golf
brought disappointing results in the next few
weeks. UCLA stunned Stanford and USC to win
the tennis crown at USC's new David Marks
tennis center; the track team finished last at
Eugene, Ore.; and the golfers made a final round
charge (sparked by a 64 by Dave Baskins and a
65 by Conrad Nilmeier) but still finished second
to USC at Clarkston Golf Course in Clarkston,
Wash.
But the 1972-73 Stanford sports season is far
from complete. NCAA competition remains in
tennis, track, and golf, and two Stanford athletes
(Rich Kelley and Brian Job) and Stanford swim
coach Jim Gaughran will be touring China this
summer on goodwill tours sponsored by the
State Department.
Of course the biggest remaining event is the
NCAA tennis championships at Princeton, New
Jersey, a tournament that Dick Gould and his
Cardinal team hopes will become the undisputed
highlight of Stanford's 1972-73 sports season.

rebound performance.

NCAA CHAMPION—Two-time Olympian Steve
Hug tied for the NCAA Ail-Around title at
Eugene, Ore. in April after winning a full share of
the crown last year. Hug will be back for his
senior season next year and will be competing for
an unprecedented third NCAA All-Around title.
It is ironic that after nine months of
competition in more than 15 sports, the most
memorable moment in 1972-73 Stanford
athletics was a loss. But that defeat, a thrilling
51-45 setback against national champion UCLA
at Pauley Pavilion, culminated the successful
reversal of Cardinal basketball fortunes and
certainly marked the highlight of Stanford's
sports year.
Coach Howie Dallmar's cagers, who had
assured Stanford's first winning season since
1966 the night before with a 50-47 victory over
USC, came into the UCLA game with dreams of
an upset but without any realistic hopes of
snapping the Bruins' awesome three-year winning
streak at 69. After the first half, however, 12,489
fans sat in stunned silence as the teams departed
for the dressing rooms with Stanford ahead,
25-18.
But when the second half began, the UCLA
crowd, apparently inspired by a halftime
presentation to coach John Wooden
commemorating his silver anniversary at UCLA,
suddenly came alive. Amid deafening roars from
the Bruin rooting section, UCLA scored two
baskets in the first 30 seconds to cut the Cardinal
lead to three.
About four minutes later, referee Charles
Reed allowed an obvious dunk by UCLA's Larry
Farmer (a call which is still causing recurring
nightmares for assistant coach Bub Bowling), and
l hen with 14:57 remaining, Keith Wilkes canned
two free throws to put the Bruins ahead for the
first time since the early moments of the game.
UCLA gradually pulled away and despite some
periodic Stanford surges, eventually recorded a
51-45 victory, the Bruins' 70th straight in a
seemingly endless streak.
UCLA went on to win a unprecedented sixth
straight national title, cruising through the
NCAA tournament without any serious scares.
The Bruins' final record was 30-0, and none of
those victories was as hard-earned as the March 3
win over Stanford.
Satisfying Victories
Of course 1972-73 Stanford athletic success
was not always measured by near misses.
Stanford teams recorded countless satisfying
victories during the past year, beginning on Sept.
16, when the Cardinals celebrated Jack
Christiansen's debut as head football coach with
a 44-0 victory over San Jose State at Stanford
Stadium.
The following week things weren't quite as
easy for the Cards in Durham, North Carolina. It
took two stingy goal line stands in the final
minutes (one from the four yard line and one
from the eight) to preserve a 10-6 victory over
the Duke Blue Devils in a regionally televised
contest.
The Cards ran their unbeaten streak to three
the next Saturday with a 41-35 victory over
previously undefeated West Virginia setting up an
October 7 showdown between the 15th ranked
Cards and the number one ranked USC Trojans,
a game that elicited varied commentary from
coaches and sportswriters throughout the
preceding week.
McKay Cautious
John McKay, whose undefeated Trojans were
rated 19 point favorites, continually tried to
minimize USC's advantage. "They'll (Stanford)
be a big test for us because they're the first team
we've met this year with an acceptable running
attack to go with an acceptable passing offense."
Meanwhile Jack Christiansen was ebullient in
his praise for the Trojans. "USC has a great
team," he said of a Trojan squad that had
outscored four previous opponents 189-42. "It's
very tough to see any weaknesses."
Not everyone was talking about strengths,
weaknesses, and statistics, though. San Francisco
Chronicle columnist Glenn Dickey admitted that
USC probably had the stronger football team,
but attacked the Trojan athletic department,
which he charged "has never been able to keep
football in perspective."
"I enjoy Stanford football because the
Cardinals (nee Indians) have done admirably with
the program, making it successful and yet
keeping it in perspective," Dickey wrote."That is
not easy, as even a cursory look around the
country will show.
"This Saturday at Palo Alto the Cards host
USC, a team which has never been able to keep
football in perspective; at USC, the tail has
wagged the dog so long, it thinks it is the dog.
Though Stanford has some good players, the
Trojans appear to be too strong for the Cards —
or anybody else.
"Yet, it has appeared that way for the last
two years, and Stanford has won so I'll be there
Saturday, rooting for the forces of good to
prevail."
USC 30, Stanford 21
84,000 fans assembled in Stanford Stadium
on Saturday to watch a 30-21 USC victory which
provoked even more controversy than the
pre-game discussions.
"They're the worst winners I've ever come up
against," cried McKay after his Trojans had tried
a pass play with two seconds left and a
nine-point lead. "I'd like to beat them by 2000
points."
But McKay wasn't through. "Why is it when
we play these hotshots there are no penalties
called both ways. They've shown no class against
us."
Christiansen declined to comment on McKay's
verbal tirade. "I learned a long time ago that it's
no use getting in a contest with a skunk," Chris
said.
The game itself was sloppy but exciting.
Stanford scored first when James Ferguson
recovered a Trojan fumble in the end zone. After
two Rod Garcia field goals and two USC
touchdowns the score was tied 13-13 with 1:24
left in the first half.
But when the Cards got set to punt, center
Bill Reid's snap sailed over Dave Ottmar's head
and USC defensive end James Sims recovered on
Stanford's five yard line. Two plays later
Anthony Davis scored to give the Trojans a 20-13
halftime advantage.
Toughest For Trojans
USC controlled the second half and eventually
recorded its nine point victory. It was easily the
toughest game of the year for the undefeated
national champions, but it was a victory which all
but eliminated the Cards from Rose Bowl
contention.
Christiansen, however, refused to give up. "I
don't think we're out of it [Rose Bowl race) by
any means," he said. "We still have a great
chance."

The Cards' dim Rose Bowl hopes stayed alive
the following week when Stanford scored an
impressive 24-0 victory over an undefeated
Washington team, but a week later Dan Fouts
and the Oregon Ducks ended any thoughts of
New Year's Day in Pasadena with a 15-13 upset
in Eugene.
Stanford then defeated Oregon State (as Rod
Garcia became the most prolific field goal kicker
in Stanford history with his 22nd career field
goal), lost to UCLA 28-23 at the Los Angeles
Coliseum, and lost to Washington State 27-13 in
Pullman as Mike Boryla spent most of the
afternoon on his back.
Stanford's grid record stood at a dismal 5-4
as the Cards prepared for the Big Game in
Berkeley. The game had no real significance as
far as the Pac-8 race was concerned. The
traditional Big Game bonfire was cancelled and
the Band's activities in San Francisco were
curtailed by a police ordinance, but emotions
were still high on both sides for the 75th renewal
of the Big Game rivalry.
"The significance of the game goes without
saying," said Cal coach Mike White, who was
struggling though his first year as the Bears' head
coach after assisting John Ralston at Stanford.
"I have a lot of friends at Stanford, most of
them players, and I respect them. I know they'd
like to beat the hell out of me because that's the
way it is in athletics."
Mud Bowl
The "Big Game Mud Bowl" was played on a
field Christiansen called "the worst I've ever
seen," but 68,000 fans were treated to one of the
most thrilling football games in recent memory.
With four seconds left on the clock, Cal had the
ball on the Stanford seven yard line. It was
fourth down, Cal trailed 21-18, and everyone at
California Memorial Stadium expected a field
goal attempt.
But freshman quarterback Vince Ferragamo
broke out of the huddle and strode confidently
to the line of scrimmage for one final play. He
dropped back, rolled to his right, and with no
time on the clock threw a perfect strike to Steve
Sweeney in the left corner of the end zone.
"I never thought of going for a tie," said an
elated White. "This game means too much."
The Cards were idle the following week, but

during that period Rod Garcia, Jim Merlo, and
Randy Poltl were named to the first team
All-Pacific Eight squad and Merlo, Poltl and
Younger Klippert were selected to the AP's
All-Coast first team.
Eric Cross was only an honorable mention
all-league selection, but on Dec. 2 in Honolulu the
5-10 senior made the selection committee think
twice about its first team receivers. Cross caught
14 passes and took over the Pac-8 lead with 53 as
the Cards ripped the Hawaii Rainbows 39-7. He
also tied the Stanford record with his ninth
touchdown reception of the season and broke
the Pac-8 record for single game catches.
Stanford's final point of the season was scored
by Steve Murray, who kicked the extra point
after Stanford's last score. Murray, who normally
held for Rod Garcia, booted the ball squarely
through the uprights as the two reversed roles for
the final play.
The team's final record was a disappointing
6-5 (2-5 in the league), but while the varsity was
struggling against Pac-8 opponents, the Card
junior varsity recorded Stanford's first
undefeated JV season since 1965. First year
coahc Hudson Houck directed his team to a 4-0
record, including two shutous.
The Cards outscored their opponents 143-22
and while the offense rolled up over 900 yards
on the ground, the defense held four opponents
to a meager 51 net yards rushing.
The cross country ttam also completed a
successful season, winning the Pac-8 Southern
Division title before finishing fourth in the Pac-8
meet. Brian Mittelstaedt and Tony Sandoval
placed 1-2 in the Southern Division event at the
Stanford golf course.
Women Win
The women's swimming team added another
highlight to Stanford's fall quarter collection,
winning the 12-team Northern California
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference meet in
Sacramento.
After the final Pac-8 football statistics (which
showed Mike Boryla leading the league in total
offense and passing and Eric Cross on top of the
receiving charts) were released, Stanford fans
turned their attention to a basketball team which
promised to be the youngest, tallest, and possibly
best Stanford team in nearly a decade.
The Cards opened their season against a USF
team which boasted top 20 preseason national
rankings and a front line averaging 6-9. Stanford
coach Howie Dallmar countered with a youthful
lineup featuring three sophomores and two
juniors. Dallmar admitted that "USF will be a
tough assignment for a young team to face in its
first game."
A nervous Stanford team took the floor on
Dec. 1 at USF's Memorial Gymnasium. The Dons
jumped out to an early lead and despite
creditable performances by Mike Mann (16
points, 12 rebounds) and Rich Kelley (12 points,
14 rebounds, eight blocked shots), countless
turnovers doomed the Cards and USF eventually
recorded an 83-68 victory.
Three days later, however, Stanford scored its
first victory of the season, defeating Arizona
75-68 before a small but appreciative Maples
Pavilion crowd. After a two week break for
finals, the Cards played seven games during
Christmas vacation, including a 77-72 loss to
eventual NIT champ Virginia Tech in the finals
of the Old Dominion Classic at Norfolk, Va.
Winning Record
When Dallmar and his squad returned home
just before New Year's Day, the Pacific Eight
Council had already granted Mike Boryla an
extra year of football eligibility and Stanford's
basketball record stood at 5-4, marking the first
time in six years that the Cards would enter
Pac-8 play with a winning record.
But when the league season began on Jan. 6 in
Pullman, Wash., the Cards continued to play an
unpredictable brand of basketball. Stanford shot
26.4 percent from the floor in a 61-49 loss to
lowly Washington State in the conference
opener, and then completely reversed gears two
nights later in Seattle, romping past Washington's
highly-rated Huskies, 76-55. TTie Cards jumped
out to a 24-2 lead in that game, and Kelley
finished the contest with 24 points and 17
rebounds.
The following week Stanford lost by a
respectable 15 points to UCLA on Friday but
played its worst basketball of the year in an
83-67 Saturday night loss against USC. Stanford
then won two in a row, including an 80-68 win at
UC Santa Barbara where freshman Tim
Patterson was 10-10 from the floor and scored
22 points.
Merlo Drafted
Meanwhile Jim Merlo was selected in the
fourth round of the NFL draft by New Orleans
and Mike Askea and Roger Cowan were also
picked. That weekend, Stanford upset UCLA in
swimming 60-53; the basketball team won its

third in a row against California; and Coach Dick
Gould's tennis squad opened its quest for the
NCAA title by winning the first annual National
Indoor tournament in Madison, Wise.
The Cards defeated North Carolina and Trinity
in the opening rounds of the team dual match
event to reach the semifinals, where Stanford
stopped USC, 6-3. In the finals the next day,
UCLA fell to the Cards by an identical 6-3 score
and the netmen were on their way to an eventful
1973 campaign.
A week later the basketball team's three game
win streak was snapped when the Cards suffered
from a turnover epidemic in the Pacific
Northwest. Oregon and Oregon State took
advantage of 53 Cardinal miscues over the
weekend as both the Ducks and the Beavers
recorded six-point victories.
Things improved slightly when the teams met
again the next week at Maples Pavilion, but the
Cards squandered a 10-point second half lead
against Oregon to spoil a weekend which began
impressively the night before with an 81-70
victory over the 18th ranked Beavers.
World Record
That same weekend four Cardinal runners
blazed around the track at Idaho State's
minidome in 1:27.4, setting a new world indoor
record for the 880 yard relay. Ken Curl, John
Kessel, Matt Hogsett, and John Anderson
comprised the record-setting team.
In the next week the cagers swept two games
from Washington and Washington State; the
tennis team cruised to an easy victory in the
Northern California Intercollegiates; and Chris
Horpel finished second in the Pac-8 wrestling
meet.
And while the basketball team was completing
its memorable weekend in Los Angeles a week
later, Payton Jordan's track squad opened its
outdoor season, splashing to a 128-31 victory
over Fresno State in rain-soaked Stanford
Stadium. In Santa Monica, Stanford finished a
disappointing fourth in the Pac-8 swimming
meet, but Cardinal swimmers turned in some
outstanding individual performances.
John Hencken set a conference record of 57.7
in the 100 yard breaststroke, touching out
teammate Brian Job, who set the old mark in last
year's meet. In the 200, however, Job edged
Olympic gold medal winner Hencken in 2:05.4.
As championship competition continued for
winter sports teams, the list of highlights
mounted. Steve Hug won the all-around title at
the Pac-8 gymnastics meet as a depleted Cardinal
squad finished third behind California and
Washington. Howard Bessen won the rings, Ted
Marcy took the side horse, and Shawn Skerrett
placed second in the vault to join Hug on the list
of NCAA qualifiers.
Hug Ties NCAA's
Hug later tied for the all-around title at the
NCAA meet in Eugene, Ore., the second straight
year the two-time Olympian had gained at least a
share of the all-around title. The swimmers were
also successful in NCAA competition, placing
sixth in the Knoxville, Tenn. meet as Hencken
won the 100 breast, Job finished second in the
200, and Dean Anderson swam to an impressive
third place finish in the 100 free. At the NCAA
wrestling meet, an injured Horpel still managed a
fifth place finish in the 142 pound weight
division.
Back at Stanford, 6652 fans watched the
Cards conclude their most successful basketball
season since 1966 with a 70-66 victory over Cal
at Maples. Seniors Bob Buell and Pat Rusco got
the Cards going, but it was Kelley who came
through in the clutch, scoring Stanford's final 14
points in a performance that clearly established
him as one of the finest players in the nation.
Stanford finished the season with a 14-11
record (7-7 in the league) and Kelley earned first
team All-Pac-8 recognition along with Bill Walton
and Keith Wilkes of UCLA, Washington's Louie
Nelson, and Oregon freshman Ron Lee.
Statistically, the talented seven footer averaged
17.3 points, 13.7 rebounds, shot 51.8 percent
from the floor, and 70.5 from the foul line.
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar was certainly
pleased with Kelley's season, and also expressed
satisfaction over the team's winning record. "We
were young and made mistakes, but it was an
exciting team to watch," Dallmar said, adding
that "we anticipate being much stronger next
year."
Spring Sports
After the last basketball game, spring sports
teams began to occupy the spotlight. Bud
Finger's golfers won their first major tournament
of the season at the Pacific Coast Invitational in
Santa Barbara, triumphing over a strong field
which included national powers USC, Long
Beach State, and Arizona State. A few days later,
however, athletic director Joseph Ruetz offered
to forfeit the championship when it was learned
that Bruce Robertson had lost his amateur status
because of a rules violation involving the sale of
golf equipment.
The USGA ruled that Robertson was no
longer an amateur, and the Stanford sophomore
was forced to withdraw from the Masters
tournament. Robertson had earned a berth in the
prestigious event by finishing sixth in the U.S.
Amateur in September and was about to leave
for Augusta, Ga. when he learned of the USGA
decision.
Stanford played without Robertson at the
University of Pacific Invitational, and the golfers
were one of four spring teams that floundered
over the weekend. The baseball team, which had
compiled a 17-8 record in non-league
competition and boasted a 12th place national
ranking, lost two out of three games to UCLA in
its conference opener; the tennis team was
shocked twice in Los Angeles, losing 6-3 to USC
and 5-4 to UCLA; the track team lost 101-50 to
defending NCAA champion UCLA; and the
golfers finished third at UOP even though George
Pettinger (Robertson's replacement) fired rounds
of 74-71 for a third place individual finish.
Things looked up at the Farm in the next few
weeks, though. Ray Young's baseball team
played well at Sunken Diamond in a three game
series against the defending national champion
USC Trojans. USC won 2-1 and 3-0, but Bob
DiPietro sandwiched a brilliant three-hit shutout
in between the two losses, blanking the Trojans,
1-0 in the first game of Saturday's doubleheader
while striking out 13.
Tennis Revenge
The next week 2500 fans jammed the varsity
tennis courts to watch the Cards avenge their
earlier losses to USC and UCLA. This time
Stanford prevailed 7-2 over the Bruins and 5-4
over the Trojans as the Cards won 10 of 12
singles matches.

On April 28, as the netmen began their
defense of the Ojai Intercollegiate tennis title,
204 players representing 34 teams swarmed over
the Stanford golf course for the sixth annual U.S.
Collegiate Invitational. The field was obviously
"quantity not quality" as only San Jose State
could mount any serious threat to the Cards.
Stanford eventually won the 54-hole event by
two strokes over the Spartans and Cardinal
sophomore Conrad Nilmeier defeated San Jose's
Phil Barry in a sudden death playoff to win the
individual title.
About the same time Nilmeier won the
sudden death playoff, freshman John Whitlinger
and Pat DuPre clinched the Ojai tennis title with
a 7-6, 3-6, 7-6 semifinal doubles victory over the
USC team of Sashi Menon-John Andrews. The
Cards finished with 16 points compared to 14 for
second place USC. UCLA was third as the "Big
Three" continued its five round struggle for
national tennis supremacy.
The following week the netmen beat Cal 8-1
to conclude a 15-2 dual match season; the
women's tennis team triumphed in the Northern
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference
tournament (Andrea Barnes won the singles title
and Whitney Grant-Terry Albert won the doubles
crown); and A 1 Arthur shutout USC 3-0 as the
Cards dropped two of three to the Trojans at
Bovard Field in Los Angeles.
Individuals Shine
Except for the baseball teams's doubleheader
sweep against UCLA (with Arthur and Dave
Frost hurling the victories), individual
accomplishments dominated the next few weeks
of sports highlights. Sandy Mayer won his second
straight Cal State tennis title, defeating South
African pro Ray Moore in the finals. Brian Job
received the A 1 Masters Award presented to the
Stanford athlete "attaining the highest degree of
leadership, athletic achievement, and
scholarship." The Biff Hoffman award for the
outstanding Stanford athlete went to gymnast
Steve Hug.
Individual achievements were also noteworthy
in the 89th Big Meet. Cal defeated the Cards
84-70 at Stanford Stadium, but freshman Terry
Albritton became the third 18 year-old in history
to put the shot 61-6V2 as he set a new meet and

school record in that event. Brian Mittlestaedt
doubled in the mile and two mile; Dave Bagshaw
won the 120 high hurdle; Ken Curl won the 100;
Jim Howard took the discus; John Anderson
won the 440; and Tom Anderson won the long
jump in other Stanford individual wins.
Tlie underdog Whites beat the Reds 14-8 as
the football squad concluded four weeks of spring
drills on May 14 with the annual Red-White
game. The play was generally sloppy, but coach
Jack Christiansen was pleased with his team's
spring progress and expressed "cautious
optimism" in anticipation of next fall's opener
against Penn State on Sept. 15.
Sweep Over Cal
A lot of fans walked over to Sunken Diamond
after the Red-White game and watched the
baseball Cards sweep a doubleheader from Cal to
end its season in second place in the Pac-8
Southern Division with a 9-9 league record. The
team finished with a 34-20 overall mark as
sophomore Bob Hampton led the hitters with a
.393 average, and Bob DiPietro (5-2, 1.30), A 1
Arthur 7-2, 1.55), and Dave Frost (6-0, 2.11)
paced the mound corps.
Hampton, DiPietro, and freshman catcher
Dave Baker were named to the Pac-8 Southern
Division all-league squad.
Pac-8 competition in tennis, track, and golf
brought disappointing results in the next few
weeks. UCLA stunned Stanford and USC to win
the tennis crown at USC's new David Marks
tennis center; the track team finished last at
Eugene, Ore.; and the golfers made a final round
charge (sparked by a 64 by Dave Baskins and a
65 by Conrad Nilmeier) but still finished second
to USC at Clarkston Golf Course in Clarkston,
Wash.
But the 1972-73 Stanford sports season is far
from complete. NCAA competition remains in
tennis, track, and golf, and two Stanford athletes
(Rich Kelley and Brian Job) and Stanford swim
coach Jim Gaughran will be touring China this
summer on goodwill tours sponsored by the
State Department.
Of course the biggest remaining event is the
NCAA tennis championships at Princeton, New
Jersey, a tournament that Dick Gould and his
Cardinal team hopes will become the undisputed
highlight of Stanford's 1972-73 sports season.

BATTLE OF THE GIANTS-UCLA's seemingly
superhuman Bill Walton appears to have
established clear superiority over Stanford
9ophomore Rich Kelley in this picture, but
Kelley proved throughout the 1972-73 basketball
season that he was among the best mortal big
men in the nation. Kelley played Walton to a
virtual statistical standoff when the Cards nearly
upset the Bruins at Pauley Pavilion. In that
contest Kelley scored 15 points and grabbed 15
rebounds while Walton turned in a 23 point, 10
rebound performance.

NCAA CHAMPION—Two-time Olympian Steve

Eugene, Ore. in April after winning a full share of
the crown last year. Hug will be back for his
senior season next year and will be competing for
an unprecedented third NCAA All-Around title.
It is ironic that after nine months of
competition in more than 15 sports, the most
memorable moment in 1972-73 Stanford
athletics was a loss. But that defeat, a thrilling
51-45 setback against national champion UCLA
at Pauley Pavilion, culminated the successful

UCLA went on to win a unprecedented sixth

The Bruins' final record was 30-0, and none of
those victories was as hard-earned as the March 3
win over Stanford.
Satisfying Victories
Of course 1972-73 Stanford athletic success
was not always measured by near misses.
Stanford teams recorded countless satisfying

USC 30, Stanford 21
84,000 fans assembled in Stanford Stadium
on Saturday to watch a 30-21 USC victory which
provoked even more controversy than the
pre-game discussions.
"They're the worst winners I've ever come up
against," cried McKay after his Trojans had tried
a pass play with two seconds left and a
nine-point lead. "I'd like to beat them by 2000
points."
But McKay wasn't through. "Why is it when
we play these hotshots there are no penalties
called both ways. They've shown no class against
us."
Christiansen declined to comment on McKay's
verbal tirade. "I learned a long time ago that it's
no use getting in a contest with a skunk," Chris
said.
The game itself was sloppy but exciting.
Stanford scored first when James Ferguson
recovered a Trojan fumble in the end zone. After
two Rod Garcia field goals and two USC
touchdowns the score was tied 13-13 with 1:24
left in the first half.
But when the Cards got set to punt, center
Bill Reid's snap sailed over Dave Ottmar's head
and USC defensive end James Sims recovered on
Stanford's five yard line. Two plays later
Anthony Davis scored to give the Trojans a 20-13
halftime advantage.
Toughest For Trojans
USC controlled the second half and eventually
recorded its nine point victory. It was easily the
toughest game of the year for the undefeated
national champions, but it was a victory which all
but eliminated the Cards from Rose Bowl
contention.
Christiansen, however, refused to give up. "I
don't think we're out of it [Rose Bowl race) by
any means," he said. "We still have a great
chance."

The Cards' dim Rose Bowl hopes stayed alive
the following week when Stanford scored an
impressive 24-0 victory over an undefeated
Washington team, but a week later Dan Fouts
and the Oregon Ducks ended any thoughts of
New Year's Day in Pasadena with a 15-13 upset
in Eugene.
Stanford then defeated Oregon State (as Rod
Garcia became the most prolific field goal kicker
in Stanford history with his 22nd career field
goal), lost to UCLA 28-23 at the Los Angeles
Coliseum, and lost to Washington State 27-13 in
Pullman as Mike Boryla spent most of the
afternoon on his back.
Stanford's grid record stood at a dismal 5-4
as the Cards prepared for the Big Game in
Berkeley. The game had no real significance as
far as the Pac-8 race was concerned. The
traditional Big Game bonfire was cancelled and
the Band's activities in San Francisco were
curtailed by a police ordinance, but emotions
were still high on both sides for the 75th renewal
of the Big Game rivalry.
"The significance of the game goes without
saying," said Cal coach Mike White, who was
struggling though his first year as the Bears' head
coach after assisting John Ralston at Stanford.
"I have a lot of friends at Stanford, most of
them players, and I respect them. I know they'd
like to beat the hell out of me because that's the
way it is in athletics."
Mud Bowl
The "Big Game Mud Bowl" was played on a
field Christiansen called "the worst I've ever
seen," but 68,000 fans were treated to one of the
most thrilling football games in recent memory.
With four seconds left on the clock, Cal had the
ball on the Stanford seven yard line. It was
fourth down, Cal trailed 21-18, and everyone at
California Memorial Stadium expected a field
goal attempt.
But freshman quarterback Vince Ferragamo
broke out of the huddle and strode confidently
to the line of scrimmage for one final play. He
dropped back, rolled to his right, and with no
time on the clock threw a perfect strike to Steve
Sweeney in the left corner of the end zone.
"I never thought of going for a tie," said an
elated White. "This game means too much."
The Cards were idle the following week, but

during that period Rod Garcia, Jim Merlo, and
Randy Poltl were named to the first team
All-Pacific Eight squad and Merlo, Poltl and
Younger Klippert were selected to the AP's
All-Coast first team.
Eric Cross was only an honorable mention
all-league selection, but on Dec. 2 in Honolulu the
5-10 senior made the selection committee think
twice about its first team receivers. Cross caught
14 passes and took over the Pac-8 lead with 53 as
the Cards ripped the Hawaii Rainbows 39-7. He
also tied the Stanford record with his ninth
touchdown reception of the season and broke
the Pac-8 record for single game catches.
Stanford's final point of the season was scored
by Steve Murray, who kicked the extra point
after Stanford's last score. Murray, who normally
held for Rod Garcia, booted the ball squarely
through the uprights as the two reversed roles for
the final play.
The team's final record was a disappointing
6-5 (2-5 in the league), but while the varsity was
struggling against Pac-8 opponents, the Card
junior varsity recorded Stanford's first
undefeated JV season since 1965. First year
coahc Hudson Houck directed his team to a 4-0
record, including two shutous.
The Cards outscored their opponents 143-22
and while the offense rolled up over 900 yards
on the ground, the defense held four opponents
to a meager 51 net yards rushing.
The cross country ttam also completed a
successful season, winning the Pac-8 Southern
Division title before finishing fourth in the Pac-8
meet. Brian Mittelstaedt and Tony Sandoval
placed 1-2 in the Southern Division event at the
Stanford golf course.
Women Win
The women's swimming team added another
highlight to Stanford's fall quarter collection,
winning the 12-team Northern California
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference meet in
Sacramento.
After the final Pac-8 football statistics (which
showed Mike Boryla leading the league in total
offense and passing and Eric Cross on top of the
receiving charts) were released, Stanford fans
turned their attention to a basketball team which
promised to be the youngest, tallest, and possibly
best Stanford team in nearly a decade.
The Cards opened their season against a USF
team which boasted top 20 preseason national
rankings and a front line averaging 6-9. Stanford
coach Howie Dallmar countered with a youthful
lineup featuring three sophomores and two
juniors. Dallmar admitted that "USF will be a
tough assignment for a young team to face in its
first game."
A nervous Stanford team took the floor on
Dec. 1 at USF's Memorial Gymnasium. The Dons
jumped out to an early lead and despite
creditable performances by Mike Mann (16
points, 12 rebounds) and Rich Kelley (12 points,
14 rebounds, eight blocked shots), countless
turnovers doomed the Cards and USF eventually
recorded an 83-68 victory.
Three days later, however, Stanford scored its
first victory of the season, defeating Arizona
75-68 before a small but appreciative Maples
Pavilion crowd. After a two week break for
finals, the Cards played seven games during
Christmas vacation, including a 77-72 loss to
eventual NIT champ Virginia Tech in the finals
of the Old Dominion Classic at Norfolk, Va.
Winning Record
When Dallmar and his squad returned home
just before New Year's Day, the Pacific Eight
Council had already granted Mike Boryla an
extra year of football eligibility and Stanford's
basketball record stood at 5-4, marking the first
time in six years that the Cards would enter
Pac-8 play with a winning record.
But when the league season began on Jan. 6 in
Pullman, Wash., the Cards continued to play an
unpredictable brand of basketball. Stanford shot
26.4 percent from the floor in a 61-49 loss to
lowly Washington State in the conference
opener, and then completely reversed gears two
nights later in Seattle, romping past Washington's
highly-rated Huskies, 76-55. TTie Cards jumped
out to a 24-2 lead in that game, and Kelley
finished the contest with 24 points and 17
rebounds.
The following week Stanford lost by a
respectable 15 points to UCLA on Friday but
played its worst basketball of the year in an
83-67 Saturday night loss against USC. Stanford
then won two in a row, including an 80-68 win at
UC Santa Barbara where freshman Tim
Patterson was 10-10 from the floor and scored
22 points.
Merlo Drafted
Meanwhile Jim Merlo was selected in the
fourth round of the NFL draft by New Orleans
and Mike Askea and Roger Cowan were also
picked. That weekend, Stanford upset UCLA in
swimming 60-53; the basketball team won its

third in a row against California; and Coach Dick
Gould's tennis squad opened its quest for the
NCAA title by winning the first annual National
Indoor tournament in Madison, Wise.
The Cards defeated North Carolina and Trinity
in the opening rounds of the team dual match
event to reach the semifinals, where Stanford
stopped USC, 6-3. In the finals the next day,
UCLA fell to the Cards by an identical 6-3 score
and the netmen were on their way to an eventful
1973 campaign.
A week later the basketball team's three game
win streak was snapped when the Cards suffered
from a turnover epidemic in the Pacific
Northwest. Oregon and Oregon State took
advantage of 53 Cardinal miscues over the
weekend as both the Ducks and the Beavers
recorded six-point victories.
Things improved slightly when the teams met
again the next week at Maples Pavilion, but the
Cards squandered a 10-point second half lead
against Oregon to spoil a weekend which began
impressively the night before with an 81-70
victory over the 18th ranked Beavers.
World Record
That same weekend four Cardinal runners
blazed around the track at Idaho State's
minidome in 1:27.4, setting a new world indoor
record for the 880 yard relay. Ken Curl, John
Kessel, Matt Hogsett, and John Anderson
comprised the record-setting team.
In the next week the cagers swept two games
from Washington and Washington State; the
tennis team cruised to an easy victory in the
Northern California Intercollegiates; and Chris
Horpel finished second in the Pac-8 wrestling
meet.
And while the basketball team was completing
its memorable weekend in Los Angeles a week
later, Payton Jordan's track squad opened its
outdoor season, splashing to a 128-31 victory
over Fresno State in rain-soaked Stanford
Stadium. In Santa Monica, Stanford finished a
disappointing fourth in the Pac-8 swimming
meet, but Cardinal swimmers turned in some
outstanding individual performances.
John Hencken set a conference record of 57.7
in the 100 yard breaststroke, touching out
teammate Brian Job, who set the old mark in last
year's meet. In the 200, however, Job edged
Olympic gold medal winner Hencken in 2:05.4.
As championship competition continued for
winter sports teams, the list of highlights
mounted. Steve Hug won the all-around title at
the Pac-8 gymnastics meet as a depleted Cardinal
squad finished third behind California and
Washington. Howard Bessen won the rings, Ted
Marcy took the side horse, and Shawn Skerrett
placed second in the vault to join Hug on the list
of NCAA qualifiers.
Hug Ties NCAA's
Hug later tied for the all-around title at the
NCAA meet in Eugene, Ore., the second straight
year the two-time Olympian had gained at least a
share of the all-around title. The swimmers were
also successful in NCAA competition, placing
sixth in the Knoxville, Tenn. meet as Hencken
won the 100 breast, Job finished second in the
200, and Dean Anderson swam to an impressive
third place finish in the 100 free. At the NCAA
wrestling meet, an injured Horpel still managed a
fifth place finish in the 142 pound weight
division.
Back at Stanford, 6652 fans watched the
Cards conclude their most successful basketball
season since 1966 with a 70-66 victory over Cal
at Maples. Seniors Bob Buell and Pat Rusco got
the Cards going, but it was Kelley who came
through in the clutch, scoring Stanford's final 14
points in a performance that clearly established
him as one of the finest players in the nation.
Stanford finished the season with a 14-11
record (7-7 in the league) and Kelley earned first
team All-Pac-8 recognition along with Bill Walton
and Keith Wilkes of UCLA, Washington's Louie
Nelson, and Oregon freshman Ron Lee.
Statistically, the talented seven footer averaged
17.3 points, 13.7 rebounds, shot 51.8 percent
from the floor, and 70.5 from the foul line.
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar was certainly
pleased with Kelley's season, and also expressed
satisfaction over the team's winning record. "We
were young and made mistakes, but it was an
exciting team to watch," Dallmar said, adding
that "we anticipate being much stronger next
year."
Spring Sports
After the last basketball game, spring sports
teams began to occupy the spotlight. Bud
Finger's golfers won their first major tournament
of the season at the Pacific Coast Invitational in
Santa Barbara, triumphing over a strong field
which included national powers USC, Long
Beach State, and Arizona State. A few days later,
however, athletic director Joseph Ruetz offered
to forfeit the championship when it was learned
that Bruce Robertson had lost his amateur status
because of a rules violation involving the sale of
golf equipment.
The USGA ruled that Robertson was no
longer an amateur, and the Stanford sophomore
was forced to withdraw from the Masters
tournament. Robertson had earned a berth in the
prestigious event by finishing sixth in the U.S.
Amateur in September and was about to leave
for Augusta, Ga. when he learned of the USGA
decision.
Stanford played without Robertson at the
University of Pacific Invitational, and the golfers
were one of four spring teams that floundered
over the weekend. The baseball team, which had
compiled a 17-8 record in non-league
competition and boasted a 12th place national
ranking, lost two out of three games to UCLA in
its conference opener; the tennis team was
shocked twice in Los Angeles, losing 6-3 to USC
and 5-4 to UCLA; the track team lost 101-50 to
defending NCAA champion UCLA; and the
golfers finished third at UOP even though George
Pettinger (Robertson's replacement) fired rounds
of 74-71 for a third place individual finish.
Things looked up at the Farm in the next few
weeks, though. Ray Young's baseball team
played well at Sunken Diamond in a three game
series against the defending national champion
USC Trojans. USC won 2-1 and 3-0, but Bob
DiPietro sandwiched a brilliant three-hit shutout
in between the two losses, blanking the Trojans,
1-0 in the first game of Saturday's doubleheader
while striking out 13.
Tennis Revenge
The next week 2500 fans jammed the varsity
tennis courts to watch the Cards avenge their
earlier losses to USC and UCLA. This time
Stanford prevailed 7-2 over the Bruins and 5-4
over the Trojans as the Cards won 10 of 12
singles matches.

On April 28, as the netmen began their
defense of the Ojai Intercollegiate tennis title,
204 players representing 34 teams swarmed over
the Stanford golf course for the sixth annual U.S.
Collegiate Invitational. The field was obviously
"quantity not quality" as only San Jose State
could mount any serious threat to the Cards.
Stanford eventually won the 54-hole event by
two strokes over the Spartans and Cardinal
sophomore Conrad Nilmeier defeated San Jose's
Phil Barry in a sudden death playoff to win the
individual title.
About the same time Nilmeier won the
sudden death playoff, freshman John Whitlinger
and Pat DuPre clinched the Ojai tennis title with
a 7-6, 3-6, 7-6 semifinal doubles victory over the
USC team of Sashi Menon-John Andrews. The
Cards finished with 16 points compared to 14 for
second place USC. UCLA was third as the "Big
Three" continued its five round struggle for
national tennis supremacy.
The following week the netmen beat Cal 8-1
to conclude a 15-2 dual match season; the
women's tennis team triumphed in the Northern
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference
tournament (Andrea Barnes won the singles title
and Whitney Grant-Terry Albert won the doubles
crown); and A 1 Arthur shutout USC 3-0 as the
Cards dropped two of three to the Trojans at
Bovard Field in Los Angeles.
Individuals Shine
Except for the baseball teams's doubleheader
sweep against UCLA (with Arthur and Dave
Frost hurling the victories), individual
accomplishments dominated the next few weeks
of sports highlights. Sandy Mayer won his second
straight Cal State tennis title, defeating South
African pro Ray Moore in the finals. Brian Job
received the A 1 Masters Award presented to the
Stanford athlete "attaining the highest degree of
leadership, athletic achievement, and
scholarship." The Biff Hoffman award for the
outstanding Stanford athlete went to gymnast
Steve Hug.
Individual achievements were also noteworthy
in the 89th Big Meet. Cal defeated the Cards
84-70 at Stanford Stadium, but freshman Terry
Albritton became the third 18 year-old in history
to put the shot 61-6V2 as he set a new meet and

school record in that event. Brian Mittlestaedt
doubled in the mile and two mile; Dave Bagshaw
won the 120 high hurdle; Ken Curl won the 100;
Jim Howard took the discus; John Anderson
won the 440; and Tom Anderson won the long
jump in other Stanford individual wins.
Tlie underdog Whites beat the Reds 14-8 as
the football squad concluded four weeks of spring
drills on May 14 with the annual Red-White
game. The play was generally sloppy, but coach
Jack Christiansen was pleased with his team's
spring progress and expressed "cautious
optimism" in anticipation of next fall's opener
against Penn State on Sept. 15.
Sweep Over Cal
A lot of fans walked over to Sunken Diamond
after the Red-White game and watched the
baseball Cards sweep a doubleheader from Cal to
end its season in second place in the Pac-8
Southern Division with a 9-9 league record. The
team finished with a 34-20 overall mark as
sophomore Bob Hampton led the hitters with a
.393 average, and Bob DiPietro (5-2, 1.30), A 1
Arthur 7-2, 1.55), and Dave Frost (6-0, 2.11)
paced the mound corps.
Hampton, DiPietro, and freshman catcher
Dave Baker were named to the Pac-8 Southern
Division all-league squad.
Pac-8 competition in tennis, track, and golf
brought disappointing results in the next few
weeks. UCLA stunned Stanford and USC to win
the tennis crown at USC's new David Marks
tennis center; the track team finished last at
Eugene, Ore.; and the golfers made a final round
charge (sparked by a 64 by Dave Baskins and a
65 by Conrad Nilmeier) but still finished second
to USC at Clarkston Golf Course in Clarkston,
Wash.
But the 1972-73 Stanford sports season is far
from complete. NCAA competition remains in
tennis, track, and golf, and two Stanford athletes
(Rich Kelley and Brian Job) and Stanford swim
coach Jim Gaughran will be touring China this
summer on goodwill tours sponsored by the
State Department.
Of course the biggest remaining event is the
NCAA tennis championships at Princeton, New
Jersey, a tournament that Dick Gould and his
Cardinal team hopes will become the undisputed
highlight of Stanford's 1972-73 sports season.

BATTLE OF THE GIANTS-UCLA's seemingly
superhuman Bill Walton appears to have
established clear superiority over Stanford
9ophomore Rich Kelley in this picture, but
Kelley proved throughout the 1972-73 basketball
season that he was among the best mortal big
men in the nation. Kelley played Walton to a
virtual statistical standoff when the Cards nearly
upset the Bruins at Pauley Pavilion. In that
contest Kelley scored 15 points and grabbed 15
rebounds while Walton turned in a 23 point, 10
rebound performance.

McCLOUD FOR THE DEFENSE Senior defensive halfback Charles McCloud dives for a possible
interception during Stanford's 10-6 victory over Duke last fall. McCloud and his fellow defensive
backs led the Pacific Eight in pass defense, but coach Jack Christiansen's Cardinals still struggled
through a disappointing 6-5 season.

NCAA CHAMPION—Two-time Olympian Steve
Hug tied for the NCAA Ail-Around title at
Eugene, Ore. in April after winning a full share of
the crown last year. Hug will be back for his
senior season next year and will be competing for
an unprecedented third NCAA All-Around title.
It is ironic that after nine months of
competition in more than 15 sports, the most
memorable moment in 1972-73 Stanford
athletics was a loss. But that defeat, a thrilling
51-45 setback against national champion UCLA
at Pauley Pavilion, culminated the successful
reversal of Cardinal basketball fortunes and
certainly marked the highlight of Stanford's
sports year.
Coach Howie Dallmar's cagers, who had
assured Stanford's first winning season since
1966 the night before with a 50-47 victory over
USC, came into the UCLA game with dreams of
an upset but without any realistic hopes of
snapping the Bruins' awesome three-year winning
streak at 69. After the first half, however, 12,489
fans sat in stunned silence as the teams departed
for the dressing rooms with Stanford ahead,
25-18.
But when the second half began, the UCLA
crowd, apparently inspired by a halftime
presentation to coach John Wooden
commemorating his silver anniversary at UCLA,
suddenly came alive. Amid deafening roars from
the Bruin rooting section, UCLA scored two
baskets in the first 30 seconds to cut the Cardinal
lead to three.
About four minutes later, referee Charles
Reed allowed an obvious dunk by UCLA's Larry
Farmer (a call which is still causing recurring
nightmares for assistant coach Bub Bowling), and
l hen with 14:57 remaining, Keith Wilkes canned
two free throws to put the Bruins ahead for the
first time since the early moments of the game.
UCLA gradually pulled away and despite some
periodic Stanford surges, eventually recorded a
51-45 victory, the Bruins' 70th straight in a
seemingly endless streak.
UCLA went on to win a unprecedented sixth
straight national title, cruising through the
NCAA tournament without any serious scares.
The Bruins' final record was 30-0, and none of
those victories was as hard-earned as the March 3
win over Stanford.
Satisfying Victories
Of course 1972-73 Stanford athletic success
was not always measured by near misses.
Stanford teams recorded countless satisfying
victories during the past year, beginning on Sept.
16, when the Cardinals celebrated Jack
Christiansen's debut as head football coach with
a 44-0 victory over San Jose State at Stanford
Stadium.
The following week things weren't quite as
easy for the Cards in Durham, North Carolina. It
took two stingy goal line stands in the final
minutes (one from the four yard line and one
from the eight) to preserve a 10-6 victory over
the Duke Blue Devils in a regionally televised
contest.
The Cards ran their unbeaten streak to three
the next Saturday with a 41-35 victory over
previously undefeated West Virginia setting up an
October 7 showdown between the 15th ranked
Cards and the number one ranked USC Trojans,
a game that elicited varied commentary from
coaches and sportswriters throughout the
preceding week.
McKay Cautious
John McKay, whose undefeated Trojans were
rated 19 point favorites, continually tried to
minimize USC's advantage. "They'll (Stanford)
be a big test for us because they're the first team
we've met this year with an acceptable running
attack to go with an acceptable passing offense."
Meanwhile Jack Christiansen was ebullient in
his praise for the Trojans. "USC has a great
team," he said of a Trojan squad that had
outscored four previous opponents 189-42. "It's
very tough to see any weaknesses."
Not everyone was talking about strengths,
weaknesses, and statistics, though. San Francisco
Chronicle columnist Glenn Dickey admitted that
USC probably had the stronger football team,
but attacked the Trojan athletic department,
which he charged "has never been able to keep
football in perspective."
"I enjoy Stanford football because the
Cardinals (nee Indians) have done admirably with
the program, making it successful and yet
keeping it in perspective," Dickey wrote."That is
not easy, as even a cursory look around the
country will show.
"This Saturday at Palo Alto the Cards host
USC, a team which has never been able to keep
football in perspective; at USC, the tail has
wagged the dog so long, it thinks it is the dog.
Though Stanford has some good players, the
Trojans appear to be too strong for the Cards —
or anybody else.
"Yet, it has appeared that way for the last
two years, and Stanford has won so I'll be there
Saturday, rooting for the forces of good to
prevail."
USC 30, Stanford 21
84,000 fans assembled in Stanford Stadium
on Saturday to watch a 30-21 USC victory which
provoked even more controversy than the
pre-game discussions.
"They're the worst winners I've ever come up
against," cried McKay after his Trojans had tried
a pass play with two seconds left and a
nine-point lead. "I'd like to beat them by 2000
points."
But McKay wasn't through. "Why is it when
we play these hotshots there are no penalties
called both ways. They've shown no class against
us."
Christiansen declined to comment on McKay's
verbal tirade. "I learned a long time ago that it's
no use getting in a contest with a skunk," Chris
said.
The game itself was sloppy but exciting.
Stanford scored first when James Ferguson
recovered a Trojan fumble in the end zone. After
two Rod Garcia field goals and two USC
touchdowns the score was tied 13-13 with 1:24
left in the first half.
But when the Cards got set to punt, center
Bill Reid's snap sailed over Dave Ottmar's head
and USC defensive end James Sims recovered on
Stanford's five yard line. Two plays later
Anthony Davis scored to give the Trojans a 20-13
halftime advantage.
Toughest For Trojans
USC controlled the second half and eventually
recorded its nine point victory. It was easily the
toughest game of the year for the undefeated
national champions, but it was a victory which all
but eliminated the Cards from Rose Bowl
contention.
Christiansen, however, refused to give up. "I
don't think we're out of it [Rose Bowl race) by
any means," he said. "We still have a great
chance."

The Cards' dim Rose Bowl hopes stayed alive
the following week when Stanford scored an
impressive 24-0 victory over an undefeated
Washington team, but a week later Dan Fouts
and the Oregon Ducks ended any thoughts of
New Year's Day in Pasadena with a 15-13 upset
in Eugene.
Stanford then defeated Oregon State (as Rod
Garcia became the most prolific field goal kicker
in Stanford history with his 22nd career field
goal), lost to UCLA 28-23 at the Los Angeles
Coliseum, and lost to Washington State 27-13 in
Pullman as Mike Boryla spent most of the
afternoon on his back.
Stanford's grid record stood at a dismal 5-4
as the Cards prepared for the Big Game in
Berkeley. The game had no real significance as
far as the Pac-8 race was concerned. The
traditional Big Game bonfire was cancelled and
the Band's activities in San Francisco were
curtailed by a police ordinance, but emotions
were still high on both sides for the 75th renewal
of the Big Game rivalry.
"The significance of the game goes without
saying," said Cal coach Mike White, who was
struggling though his first year as the Bears' head
coach after assisting John Ralston at Stanford.
"I have a lot of friends at Stanford, most of
them players, and I respect them. I know they'd
like to beat the hell out of me because that's the
way it is in athletics."
Mud Bowl
The "Big Game Mud Bowl" was played on a
field Christiansen called "the worst I've ever
seen," but 68,000 fans were treated to one of the
most thrilling football games in recent memory.
With four seconds left on the clock, Cal had the
ball on the Stanford seven yard line. It was
fourth down, Cal trailed 21-18, and everyone at
California Memorial Stadium expected a field
goal attempt.
But freshman quarterback Vince Ferragamo
broke out of the huddle and strode confidently
to the line of scrimmage for one final play. He
dropped back, rolled to his right, and with no
time on the clock threw a perfect strike to Steve
Sweeney in the left corner of the end zone.
"I never thought of going for a tie," said an
elated White. "This game means too much."
The Cards were idle the following week, but

during that period Rod Garcia, Jim Merlo, and
Randy Poltl were named to the first team
All-Pacific Eight squad and Merlo, Poltl and
Younger Klippert were selected to the AP's
All-Coast first team.
Eric Cross was only an honorable mention
all-league selection, but on Dec. 2 in Honolulu the
5-10 senior made the selection committee think
twice about its first team receivers. Cross caught
14 passes and took over the Pac-8 lead with 53 as
the Cards ripped the Hawaii Rainbows 39-7. He
also tied the Stanford record with his ninth
touchdown reception of the season and broke
the Pac-8 record for single game catches.
Stanford's final point of the season was scored
by Steve Murray, who kicked the extra point
after Stanford's last score. Murray, who normally
held for Rod Garcia, booted the ball squarely
through the uprights as the two reversed roles for
the final play.
The team's final record was a disappointing
6-5 (2-5 in the league), but while the varsity was
struggling against Pac-8 opponents, the Card
junior varsity recorded Stanford's first
undefeated JV season since 1965. First year
coahc Hudson Houck directed his team to a 4-0
record, including two shutous.
The Cards outscored their opponents 143-22
and while the offense rolled up over 900 yards
on the ground, the defense held four opponents
to a meager 51 net yards rushing.
The cross country ttam also completed a
successful season, winning the Pac-8 Southern
Division title before finishing fourth in the Pac-8
meet. Brian Mittelstaedt and Tony Sandoval
placed 1-2 in the Southern Division event at the
Stanford golf course.
Women Win
The women's swimming team added another
highlight to Stanford's fall quarter collection,
winning the 12-team Northern California
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference meet in
Sacramento.
After the final Pac-8 football statistics (which
showed Mike Boryla leading the league in total
offense and passing and Eric Cross on top of the
receiving charts) were released, Stanford fans
turned their attention to a basketball team which
promised to be the youngest, tallest, and possibly
best Stanford team in nearly a decade.
The Cards opened their season against a USF
team which boasted top 20 preseason national
rankings and a front line averaging 6-9. Stanford
coach Howie Dallmar countered with a youthful
lineup featuring three sophomores and two
juniors. Dallmar admitted that "USF will be a
tough assignment for a young team to face in its
first game."
A nervous Stanford team took the floor on
Dec. 1 at USF's Memorial Gymnasium. The Dons
jumped out to an early lead and despite
creditable performances by Mike Mann (16
points, 12 rebounds) and Rich Kelley (12 points,
14 rebounds, eight blocked shots), countless
turnovers doomed the Cards and USF eventually
recorded an 83-68 victory.
Three days later, however, Stanford scored its
first victory of the season, defeating Arizona
75-68 before a small but appreciative Maples
Pavilion crowd. After a two week break for
finals, the Cards played seven games during
Christmas vacation, including a 77-72 loss to
eventual NIT champ Virginia Tech in the finals
of the Old Dominion Classic at Norfolk, Va.
Winning Record
When Dallmar and his squad returned home
just before New Year's Day, the Pacific Eight
Council had already granted Mike Boryla an
extra year of football eligibility and Stanford's
basketball record stood at 5-4, marking the first
time in six years that the Cards would enter
Pac-8 play with a winning record.
But when the league season began on Jan. 6 in
Pullman, Wash., the Cards continued to play an
unpredictable brand of basketball. Stanford shot
26.4 percent from the floor in a 61-49 loss to
lowly Washington State in the conference
opener, and then completely reversed gears two
nights later in Seattle, romping past Washington's
highly-rated Huskies, 76-55. TTie Cards jumped
out to a 24-2 lead in that game, and Kelley
finished the contest with 24 points and 17
rebounds.
The following week Stanford lost by a
respectable 15 points to UCLA on Friday but
played its worst basketball of the year in an
83-67 Saturday night loss against USC. Stanford
then won two in a row, including an 80-68 win at
UC Santa Barbara where freshman Tim
Patterson was 10-10 from the floor and scored
22 points.
Merlo Drafted
Meanwhile Jim Merlo was selected in the
fourth round of the NFL draft by New Orleans
and Mike Askea and Roger Cowan were also
picked. That weekend, Stanford upset UCLA in
swimming 60-53; the basketball team won its

third in a row against California; and Coach Dick
Gould's tennis squad opened its quest for the
NCAA title by winning the first annual National
Indoor tournament in Madison, Wise.
The Cards defeated North Carolina and Trinity
in the opening rounds of the team dual match
event to reach the semifinals, where Stanford
stopped USC, 6-3. In the finals the next day,
UCLA fell to the Cards by an identical 6-3 score
and the netmen were on their way to an eventful
1973 campaign.
A week later the basketball team's three game
win streak was snapped when the Cards suffered
from a turnover epidemic in the Pacific
Northwest. Oregon and Oregon State took
advantage of 53 Cardinal miscues over the
weekend as both the Ducks and the Beavers
recorded six-point victories.
Things improved slightly when the teams met
again the next week at Maples Pavilion, but the
Cards squandered a 10-point second half lead
against Oregon to spoil a weekend which began
impressively the night before with an 81-70
victory over the 18th ranked Beavers.
World Record
That same weekend four Cardinal runners
blazed around the track at Idaho State's
minidome in 1:27.4, setting a new world indoor
record for the 880 yard relay. Ken Curl, John
Kessel, Matt Hogsett, and John Anderson
comprised the record-setting team.
In the next week the cagers swept two games
from Washington and Washington State; the
tennis team cruised to an easy victory in the
Northern California Intercollegiates; and Chris
Horpel finished second in the Pac-8 wrestling
meet.
And while the basketball team was completing
its memorable weekend in Los Angeles a week
later, Payton Jordan's track squad opened its
outdoor season, splashing to a 128-31 victory
over Fresno State in rain-soaked Stanford
Stadium. In Santa Monica, Stanford finished a
disappointing fourth in the Pac-8 swimming
meet, but Cardinal swimmers turned in some
outstanding individual performances.
John Hencken set a conference record of 57.7
in the 100 yard breaststroke, touching out
teammate Brian Job, who set the old mark in last
year's meet. In the 200, however, Job edged
Olympic gold medal winner Hencken in 2:05.4.
As championship competition continued for
winter sports teams, the list of highlights
mounted. Steve Hug won the all-around title at
the Pac-8 gymnastics meet as a depleted Cardinal
squad finished third behind California and
Washington. Howard Bessen won the rings, Ted
Marcy took the side horse, and Shawn Skerrett
placed second in the vault to join Hug on the list
of NCAA qualifiers.
Hug Ties NCAA's
Hug later tied for the all-around title at the
NCAA meet in Eugene, Ore., the second straight
year the two-time Olympian had gained at least a
share of the all-around title. The swimmers were
also successful in NCAA competition, placing
sixth in the Knoxville, Tenn. meet as Hencken
won the 100 breast, Job finished second in the
200, and Dean Anderson swam to an impressive
third place finish in the 100 free. At the NCAA
wrestling meet, an injured Horpel still managed a
fifth place finish in the 142 pound weight
division.
Back at Stanford, 6652 fans watched the
Cards conclude their most successful basketball
season since 1966 with a 70-66 victory over Cal
at Maples. Seniors Bob Buell and Pat Rusco got
the Cards going, but it was Kelley who came
through in the clutch, scoring Stanford's final 14
points in a performance that clearly established
him as one of the finest players in the nation.
Stanford finished the season with a 14-11
record (7-7 in the league) and Kelley earned first
team All-Pac-8 recognition along with Bill Walton
and Keith Wilkes of UCLA, Washington's Louie
Nelson, and Oregon freshman Ron Lee.
Statistically, the talented seven footer averaged
17.3 points, 13.7 rebounds, shot 51.8 percent
from the floor, and 70.5 from the foul line.
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar was certainly
pleased with Kelley's season, and also expressed
satisfaction over the team's winning record. "We
were young and made mistakes, but it was an
exciting team to watch," Dallmar said, adding
that "we anticipate being much stronger next
year."
Spring Sports
After the last basketball game, spring sports
teams began to occupy the spotlight. Bud
Finger's golfers won their first major tournament
of the season at the Pacific Coast Invitational in
Santa Barbara, triumphing over a strong field
which included national powers USC, Long
Beach State, and Arizona State. A few days later,
however, athletic director Joseph Ruetz offered
to forfeit the championship when it was learned
that Bruce Robertson had lost his amateur status
because of a rules violation involving the sale of
golf equipment.
The USGA ruled that Robertson was no
longer an amateur, and the Stanford sophomore
was forced to withdraw from the Masters
tournament. Robertson had earned a berth in the
prestigious event by finishing sixth in the U.S.
Amateur in September and was about to leave
for Augusta, Ga. when he learned of the USGA
decision.
Stanford played without Robertson at the
University of Pacific Invitational, and the golfers
were one of four spring teams that floundered
over the weekend. The baseball team, which had
compiled a 17-8 record in non-league
competition and boasted a 12th place national
ranking, lost two out of three games to UCLA in
its conference opener; the tennis team was
shocked twice in Los Angeles, losing 6-3 to USC
and 5-4 to UCLA; the track team lost 101-50 to
defending NCAA champion UCLA; and the
golfers finished third at UOP even though George
Pettinger (Robertson's replacement) fired rounds
of 74-71 for a third place individual finish.
Things looked up at the Farm in the next few
weeks, though. Ray Young's baseball team
played well at Sunken Diamond in a three game
series against the defending national champion
USC Trojans. USC won 2-1 and 3-0, but Bob
DiPietro sandwiched a brilliant three-hit shutout
in between the two losses, blanking the Trojans,
1-0 in the first game of Saturday's doubleheader
while striking out 13.
Tennis Revenge
The next week 2500 fans jammed the varsity
tennis courts to watch the Cards avenge their
earlier losses to USC and UCLA. This time
Stanford prevailed 7-2 over the Bruins and 5-4
over the Trojans as the Cards won 10 of 12
singles matches.

On April 28, as the netmen began their
defense of the Ojai Intercollegiate tennis title,
204 players representing 34 teams swarmed over
the Stanford golf course for the sixth annual U.S.
Collegiate Invitational. The field was obviously
"quantity not quality" as only San Jose State
could mount any serious threat to the Cards.
Stanford eventually won the 54-hole event by
two strokes over the Spartans and Cardinal
sophomore Conrad Nilmeier defeated San Jose's
Phil Barry in a sudden death playoff to win the
individual title.
About the same time Nilmeier won the
sudden death playoff, freshman John Whitlinger
and Pat DuPre clinched the Ojai tennis title with
a 7-6, 3-6, 7-6 semifinal doubles victory over the
USC team of Sashi Menon-John Andrews. The
Cards finished with 16 points compared to 14 for
second place USC. UCLA was third as the "Big
Three" continued its five round struggle for
national tennis supremacy.
The following week the netmen beat Cal 8-1
to conclude a 15-2 dual match season; the
women's tennis team triumphed in the Northern
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference
tournament (Andrea Barnes won the singles title
and Whitney Grant-Terry Albert won the doubles
crown); and A 1 Arthur shutout USC 3-0 as the
Cards dropped two of three to the Trojans at
Bovard Field in Los Angeles.
Individuals Shine
Except for the baseball teams's doubleheader
sweep against UCLA (with Arthur and Dave
Frost hurling the victories), individual
accomplishments dominated the next few weeks
of sports highlights. Sandy Mayer won his second
straight Cal State tennis title, defeating South
African pro Ray Moore in the finals. Brian Job
received the A 1 Masters Award presented to the
Stanford athlete "attaining the highest degree of
leadership, athletic achievement, and
scholarship." The Biff Hoffman award for the
outstanding Stanford athlete went to gymnast
Steve Hug.
Individual achievements were also noteworthy
in the 89th Big Meet. Cal defeated the Cards
84-70 at Stanford Stadium, but freshman Terry
Albritton became the third 18 year-old in history
to put the shot 61-6V2 as he set a new meet and

school record in that event. Brian Mittlestaedt
doubled in the mile and two mile; Dave Bagshaw
won the 120 high hurdle; Ken Curl won the 100;
Jim Howard took the discus; John Anderson
won the 440; and Tom Anderson won the long
jump in other Stanford individual wins.
Tlie underdog Whites beat the Reds 14-8 as
the football squad concluded four weeks of spring
drills on May 14 with the annual Red-White
game. The play was generally sloppy, but coach
Jack Christiansen was pleased with his team's
spring progress and expressed "cautious
optimism" in anticipation of next fall's opener
against Penn State on Sept. 15.
Sweep Over Cal
A lot of fans walked over to Sunken Diamond
after the Red-White game and watched the
baseball Cards sweep a doubleheader from Cal to
end its season in second place in the Pac-8
Southern Division with a 9-9 league record. The
team finished with a 34-20 overall mark as
sophomore Bob Hampton led the hitters with a
.393 average, and Bob DiPietro (5-2, 1.30), A 1
Arthur 7-2, 1.55), and Dave Frost (6-0, 2.11)
paced the mound corps.
Hampton, DiPietro, and freshman catcher
Dave Baker were named to the Pac-8 Southern
Division all-league squad.
Pac-8 competition in tennis, track, and golf
brought disappointing results in the next few
weeks. UCLA stunned Stanford and USC to win
the tennis crown at USC's new David Marks
tennis center; the track team finished last at
Eugene, Ore.; and the golfers made a final round
charge (sparked by a 64 by Dave Baskins and a
65 by Conrad Nilmeier) but still finished second
to USC at Clarkston Golf Course in Clarkston,
Wash.
But the 1972-73 Stanford sports season is far
from complete. NCAA competition remains in
tennis, track, and golf, and two Stanford athletes
(Rich Kelley and Brian Job) and Stanford swim
coach Jim Gaughran will be touring China this
summer on goodwill tours sponsored by the
State Department.
Of course the biggest remaining event is the
NCAA tennis championships at Princeton, New
Jersey, a tournament that Dick Gould and his
Cardinal team hopes will become the undisputed
highlight of Stanford's 1972-73 sports season.

BATTLE OF THE GIANTS-UCLA's seemingly
superhuman Bill Walton appears to have
established clear superiority over Stanford
9ophomore Rich Kelley in this picture, but
Kelley proved throughout the 1972-73 basketball
season that he was among the best mortal big
men in the nation. Kelley played Walton to a
virtual statistical standoff when the Cards nearly
upset the Bruins at Pauley Pavilion. In that
contest Kelley scored 15 points and grabbed 15
rebounds while Walton turned in a 23 point, 10
rebound performance.

McCLOUD FOR THE DEFENSE Senior defensive halfback Charles McCloud dives for a possible
interception during Stanford's 10-6 victory over Duke last fall. McCloud and his fellow defensive
backs led the Pacific Eight in pass defense, but coach Jack Christiansen's Cardinals still struggled
through a disappointing 6-5 season.

NCAA CHAMPION—Two-time Olympian Steve
Hug tied for the NCAA Ail-Around title at
Eugene, Ore. in April after winning a full share of
the crown last year. Hug will be back for his
senior season next year and will be competing for
an unprecedented third NCAA All-Around title.
It is ironic that after nine months of
competition in more than 15 sports, the most
memorable moment in 1972-73 Stanford
athletics was a loss. But that defeat, a thrilling
51-45 setback against national champion UCLA
at Pauley Pavilion, culminated the successful
reversal of Cardinal basketball fortunes and
certainly marked the highlight of Stanford's
sports year.
Coach Howie Dallmar's cagers, who had
assured Stanford's first winning season since
1966 the night before with a 50-47 victory over
USC, came into the UCLA game with dreams of
an upset but without any realistic hopes of
snapping the Bruins' awesome three-year winning
streak at 69. After the first half, however, 12,489
fans sat in stunned silence as the teams departed
for the dressing rooms with Stanford ahead,
25-18.
But when the second half began, the UCLA
crowd, apparently inspired by a halftime
presentation to coach John Wooden
commemorating his silver anniversary at UCLA,
suddenly came alive. Amid deafening roars from
the Bruin rooting section, UCLA scored two
baskets in the first 30 seconds to cut the Cardinal
lead to three.
About four minutes later, referee Charles
Reed allowed an obvious dunk by UCLA's Larry
Farmer (a call which is still causing recurring
nightmares for assistant coach Bub Bowling), and
l hen with 14:57 remaining, Keith Wilkes canned
two free throws to put the Bruins ahead for the
first time since the early moments of the game.
UCLA gradually pulled away and despite some
periodic Stanford surges, eventually recorded a
51-45 victory, the Bruins' 70th straight in a
seemingly endless streak.
UCLA went on to win a unprecedented sixth
straight national title, cruising through the
NCAA tournament without any serious scares.
The Bruins' final record was 30-0, and none of
those victories was as hard-earned as the March 3
win over Stanford.
Satisfying Victories
Of course 1972-73 Stanford athletic success
was not always measured by near misses.
Stanford teams recorded countless satisfying
victories during the past year, beginning on Sept.
16, when the Cardinals celebrated Jack
Christiansen's debut as head football coach with
a 44-0 victory over San Jose State at Stanford
Stadium.
The following week things weren't quite as
easy for the Cards in Durham, North Carolina. It
took two stingy goal line stands in the final
minutes (one from the four yard line and one
from the eight) to preserve a 10-6 victory over
the Duke Blue Devils in a regionally televised
contest.
The Cards ran their unbeaten streak to three
the next Saturday with a 41-35 victory over
previously undefeated West Virginia setting up an
October 7 showdown between the 15th ranked
Cards and the number one ranked USC Trojans,
a game that elicited varied commentary from
coaches and sportswriters throughout the
preceding week.
McKay Cautious
John McKay, whose undefeated Trojans were
rated 19 point favorites, continually tried to
minimize USC's advantage. "They'll (Stanford)
be a big test for us because they're the first team
we've met this year with an acceptable running
attack to go with an acceptable passing offense."
Meanwhile Jack Christiansen was ebullient in
his praise for the Trojans. "USC has a great
team," he said of a Trojan squad that had
outscored four previous opponents 189-42. "It's
very tough to see any weaknesses."
Not everyone was talking about strengths,
weaknesses, and statistics, though. San Francisco
Chronicle columnist Glenn Dickey admitted that
USC probably had the stronger football team,
but attacked the Trojan athletic department,
which he charged "has never been able to keep
football in perspective."
"I enjoy Stanford football because the
Cardinals (nee Indians) have done admirably with
the program, making it successful and yet
keeping it in perspective," Dickey wrote."That is
not easy, as even a cursory look around the
country will show.
"This Saturday at Palo Alto the Cards host
USC, a team which has never been able to keep
football in perspective; at USC, the tail has
wagged the dog so long, it thinks it is the dog.
Though Stanford has some good players, the
Trojans appear to be too strong for the Cards —
or anybody else.
"Yet, it has appeared that way for the last
two years, and Stanford has won so I'll be there
Saturday, rooting for the forces of good to
prevail."
USC 30, Stanford 21
84,000 fans assembled in Stanford Stadium
on Saturday to watch a 30-21 USC victory which
provoked even more controversy than the
pre-game discussions.
"They're the worst winners I've ever come up
against," cried McKay after his Trojans had tried
a pass play with two seconds left and a
nine-point lead. "I'd like to beat them by 2000
points."
But McKay wasn't through. "Why is it when
we play these hotshots there are no penalties
called both ways. They've shown no class against
us."
Christiansen declined to comment on McKay's
verbal tirade. "I learned a long time ago that it's
no use getting in a contest with a skunk," Chris
said.
The game itself was sloppy but exciting.
Stanford scored first when James Ferguson
recovered a Trojan fumble in the end zone. After
two Rod Garcia field goals and two USC
touchdowns the score was tied 13-13 with 1:24
left in the first half.
But when the Cards got set to punt, center
Bill Reid's snap sailed over Dave Ottmar's head
and USC defensive end James Sims recovered on
Stanford's five yard line. Two plays later
Anthony Davis scored to give the Trojans a 20-13
halftime advantage.
Toughest For Trojans
USC controlled the second half and eventually
recorded its nine point victory. It was easily the
toughest game of the year for the undefeated
national champions, but it was a victory which all
but eliminated the Cards from Rose Bowl
contention.
Christiansen, however, refused to give up. "I
don't think we're out of it [Rose Bowl race) by
any means," he said. "We still have a great
chance."

The Cards' dim Rose Bowl hopes stayed alive
the following week when Stanford scored an
impressive 24-0 victory over an undefeated
Washington team, but a week later Dan Fouts
and the Oregon Ducks ended any thoughts of
New Year's Day in Pasadena with a 15-13 upset
in Eugene.
Stanford then defeated Oregon State (as Rod
Garcia became the most prolific field goal kicker
in Stanford history with his 22nd career field
goal), lost to UCLA 28-23 at the Los Angeles
Coliseum, and lost to Washington State 27-13 in
Pullman as Mike Boryla spent most of the
afternoon on his back.
Stanford's grid record stood at a dismal 5-4
as the Cards prepared for the Big Game in
Berkeley. The game had no real significance as
far as the Pac-8 race was concerned. The
traditional Big Game bonfire was cancelled and
the Band's activities in San Francisco were
curtailed by a police ordinance, but emotions
were still high on both sides for the 75th renewal
of the Big Game rivalry.
"The significance of the game goes without
saying," said Cal coach Mike White, who was
struggling though his first year as the Bears' head
coach after assisting John Ralston at Stanford.
"I have a lot of friends at Stanford, most of
them players, and I respect them. I know they'd
like to beat the hell out of me because that's the
way it is in athletics."
Mud Bowl
The "Big Game Mud Bowl" was played on a
field Christiansen called "the worst I've ever
seen," but 68,000 fans were treated to one of the
most thrilling football games in recent memory.
With four seconds left on the clock, Cal had the
ball on the Stanford seven yard line. It was
fourth down, Cal trailed 21-18, and everyone at
California Memorial Stadium expected a field
goal attempt.
But freshman quarterback Vince Ferragamo
broke out of the huddle and strode confidently
to the line of scrimmage for one final play. He
dropped back, rolled to his right, and with no
time on the clock threw a perfect strike to Steve
Sweeney in the left corner of the end zone.
"I never thought of going for a tie," said an
elated White. "This game means too much."
The Cards were idle the following week, but

during that period Rod Garcia, Jim Merlo, and
Randy Poltl were named to the first team
All-Pacific Eight squad and Merlo, Poltl and
Younger Klippert were selected to the AP's
All-Coast first team.
Eric Cross was only an honorable mention
all-league selection, but on Dec. 2 in Honolulu the
5-10 senior made the selection committee think
twice about its first team receivers. Cross caught
14 passes and took over the Pac-8 lead with 53 as
the Cards ripped the Hawaii Rainbows 39-7. He
also tied the Stanford record with his ninth
touchdown reception of the season and broke
the Pac-8 record for single game catches.
Stanford's final point of the season was scored
by Steve Murray, who kicked the extra point
after Stanford's last score. Murray, who normally
held for Rod Garcia, booted the ball squarely
through the uprights as the two reversed roles for
the final play.
The team's final record was a disappointing
6-5 (2-5 in the league), but while the varsity was
struggling against Pac-8 opponents, the Card
junior varsity recorded Stanford's first
undefeated JV season since 1965. First year
coahc Hudson Houck directed his team to a 4-0
record, including two shutous.
The Cards outscored their opponents 143-22
and while the offense rolled up over 900 yards
on the ground, the defense held four opponents
to a meager 51 net yards rushing.
The cross country ttam also completed a
successful season, winning the Pac-8 Southern
Division title before finishing fourth in the Pac-8
meet. Brian Mittelstaedt and Tony Sandoval
placed 1-2 in the Southern Division event at the
Stanford golf course.
Women Win
The women's swimming team added another
highlight to Stanford's fall quarter collection,
winning the 12-team Northern California
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference meet in
Sacramento.
After the final Pac-8 football statistics (which
showed Mike Boryla leading the league in total
offense and passing and Eric Cross on top of the
receiving charts) were released, Stanford fans
turned their attention to a basketball team which
promised to be the youngest, tallest, and possibly
best Stanford team in nearly a decade.
The Cards opened their season against a USF
team which boasted top 20 preseason national
rankings and a front line averaging 6-9. Stanford
coach Howie Dallmar countered with a youthful
lineup featuring three sophomores and two
juniors. Dallmar admitted that "USF will be a
tough assignment for a young team to face in its
first game."
A nervous Stanford team took the floor on
Dec. 1 at USF's Memorial Gymnasium. The Dons
jumped out to an early lead and despite
creditable performances by Mike Mann (16
points, 12 rebounds) and Rich Kelley (12 points,
14 rebounds, eight blocked shots), countless
turnovers doomed the Cards and USF eventually
recorded an 83-68 victory.
Three days later, however, Stanford scored its
first victory of the season, defeating Arizona
75-68 before a small but appreciative Maples
Pavilion crowd. After a two week break for
finals, the Cards played seven games during
Christmas vacation, including a 77-72 loss to
eventual NIT champ Virginia Tech in the finals
of the Old Dominion Classic at Norfolk, Va.
Winning Record
When Dallmar and his squad returned home
just before New Year's Day, the Pacific Eight
Council had already granted Mike Boryla an
extra year of football eligibility and Stanford's
basketball record stood at 5-4, marking the first
time in six years that the Cards would enter
Pac-8 play with a winning record.
But when the league season began on Jan. 6 in
Pullman, Wash., the Cards continued to play an
unpredictable brand of basketball. Stanford shot
26.4 percent from the floor in a 61-49 loss to
lowly Washington State in the conference
opener, and then completely reversed gears two
nights later in Seattle, romping past Washington's
highly-rated Huskies, 76-55. TTie Cards jumped
out to a 24-2 lead in that game, and Kelley
finished the contest with 24 points and 17
rebounds.
The following week Stanford lost by a
respectable 15 points to UCLA on Friday but
played its worst basketball of the year in an
83-67 Saturday night loss against USC. Stanford
then won two in a row, including an 80-68 win at
UC Santa Barbara where freshman Tim
Patterson was 10-10 from the floor and scored
22 points.
Merlo Drafted
Meanwhile Jim Merlo was selected in the
fourth round of the NFL draft by New Orleans
and Mike Askea and Roger Cowan were also
picked. That weekend, Stanford upset UCLA in
swimming 60-53; the basketball team won its

third in a row against California; and Coach Dick
Gould's tennis squad opened its quest for the
NCAA title by winning the first annual National
Indoor tournament in Madison, Wise.
The Cards defeated North Carolina and Trinity
in the opening rounds of the team dual match
event to reach the semifinals, where Stanford
stopped USC, 6-3. In the finals the next day,
UCLA fell to the Cards by an identical 6-3 score
and the netmen were on their way to an eventful
1973 campaign.
A week later the basketball team's three game
win streak was snapped when the Cards suffered
from a turnover epidemic in the Pacific
Northwest. Oregon and Oregon State took
advantage of 53 Cardinal miscues over the
weekend as both the Ducks and the Beavers
recorded six-point victories.
Things improved slightly when the teams met
again the next week at Maples Pavilion, but the
Cards squandered a 10-point second half lead
against Oregon to spoil a weekend which began
impressively the night before with an 81-70
victory over the 18th ranked Beavers.
World Record
That same weekend four Cardinal runners
blazed around the track at Idaho State's
minidome in 1:27.4, setting a new world indoor
record for the 880 yard relay. Ken Curl, John
Kessel, Matt Hogsett, and John Anderson
comprised the record-setting team.
In the next week the cagers swept two games
from Washington and Washington State; the
tennis team cruised to an easy victory in the
Northern California Intercollegiates; and Chris
Horpel finished second in the Pac-8 wrestling
meet.
And while the basketball team was completing
its memorable weekend in Los Angeles a week
later, Payton Jordan's track squad opened its
outdoor season, splashing to a 128-31 victory
over Fresno State in rain-soaked Stanford
Stadium. In Santa Monica, Stanford finished a
disappointing fourth in the Pac-8 swimming
meet, but Cardinal swimmers turned in some
outstanding individual performances.
John Hencken set a conference record of 57.7
in the 100 yard breaststroke, touching out
teammate Brian Job, who set the old mark in last
year's meet. In the 200, however, Job edged
Olympic gold medal winner Hencken in 2:05.4.
As championship competition continued for
winter sports teams, the list of highlights
mounted. Steve Hug won the all-around title at
the Pac-8 gymnastics meet as a depleted Cardinal
squad finished third behind California and
Washington. Howard Bessen won the rings, Ted
Marcy took the side horse, and Shawn Skerrett
placed second in the vault to join Hug on the list
of NCAA qualifiers.
Hug Ties NCAA's
Hug later tied for the all-around title at the
NCAA meet in Eugene, Ore., the second straight
year the two-time Olympian had gained at least a
share of the all-around title. The swimmers were
also successful in NCAA competition, placing
sixth in the Knoxville, Tenn. meet as Hencken
won the 100 breast, Job finished second in the
200, and Dean Anderson swam to an impressive
third place finish in the 100 free. At the NCAA
wrestling meet, an injured Horpel still managed a
fifth place finish in the 142 pound weight
division.
Back at Stanford, 6652 fans watched the
Cards conclude their most successful basketball
season since 1966 with a 70-66 victory over Cal
at Maples. Seniors Bob Buell and Pat Rusco got
the Cards going, but it was Kelley who came
through in the clutch, scoring Stanford's final 14
points in a performance that clearly established
him as one of the finest players in the nation.
Stanford finished the season with a 14-11
record (7-7 in the league) and Kelley earned first
team All-Pac-8 recognition along with Bill Walton
and Keith Wilkes of UCLA, Washington's Louie
Nelson, and Oregon freshman Ron Lee.
Statistically, the talented seven footer averaged
17.3 points, 13.7 rebounds, shot 51.8 percent
from the floor, and 70.5 from the foul line.
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar was certainly
pleased with Kelley's season, and also expressed
satisfaction over the team's winning record. "We
were young and made mistakes, but it was an
exciting team to watch," Dallmar said, adding
that "we anticipate being much stronger next
year."
Spring Sports
After the last basketball game, spring sports
teams began to occupy the spotlight. Bud
Finger's golfers won their first major tournament
of the season at the Pacific Coast Invitational in
Santa Barbara, triumphing over a strong field
which included national powers USC, Long
Beach State, and Arizona State. A few days later,
however, athletic director Joseph Ruetz offered
to forfeit the championship when it was learned
that Bruce Robertson had lost his amateur status
because of a rules violation involving the sale of
golf equipment.
The USGA ruled that Robertson was no
longer an amateur, and the Stanford sophomore
was forced to withdraw from the Masters
tournament. Robertson had earned a berth in the
prestigious event by finishing sixth in the U.S.
Amateur in September and was about to leave
for Augusta, Ga. when he learned of the USGA
decision.
Stanford played without Robertson at the
University of Pacific Invitational, and the golfers
were one of four spring teams that floundered
over the weekend. The baseball team, which had
compiled a 17-8 record in non-league
competition and boasted a 12th place national
ranking, lost two out of three games to UCLA in
its conference opener; the tennis team was
shocked twice in Los Angeles, losing 6-3 to USC
and 5-4 to UCLA; the track team lost 101-50 to
defending NCAA champion UCLA; and the
golfers finished third at UOP even though George
Pettinger (Robertson's replacement) fired rounds
of 74-71 for a third place individual finish.
Things looked up at the Farm in the next few
weeks, though. Ray Young's baseball team
played well at Sunken Diamond in a three game
series against the defending national champion
USC Trojans. USC won 2-1 and 3-0, but Bob
DiPietro sandwiched a brilliant three-hit shutout
in between the two losses, blanking the Trojans,
1-0 in the first game of Saturday's doubleheader
while striking out 13.
Tennis Revenge
The next week 2500 fans jammed the varsity
tennis courts to watch the Cards avenge their
earlier losses to USC and UCLA. This time
Stanford prevailed 7-2 over the Bruins and 5-4
over the Trojans as the Cards won 10 of 12
singles matches.

On April 28, as the netmen began their
defense of the Ojai Intercollegiate tennis title,
204 players representing 34 teams swarmed over
the Stanford golf course for the sixth annual U.S.
Collegiate Invitational. The field was obviously
"quantity not quality" as only San Jose State
could mount any serious threat to the Cards.
Stanford eventually won the 54-hole event by
two strokes over the Spartans and Cardinal
sophomore Conrad Nilmeier defeated San Jose's
Phil Barry in a sudden death playoff to win the
individual title.
About the same time Nilmeier won the
sudden death playoff, freshman John Whitlinger
and Pat DuPre clinched the Ojai tennis title with
a 7-6, 3-6, 7-6 semifinal doubles victory over the
USC team of Sashi Menon-John Andrews. The
Cards finished with 16 points compared to 14 for
second place USC. UCLA was third as the "Big
Three" continued its five round struggle for
national tennis supremacy.
The following week the netmen beat Cal 8-1
to conclude a 15-2 dual match season; the
women's tennis team triumphed in the Northern
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference
tournament (Andrea Barnes won the singles title
and Whitney Grant-Terry Albert won the doubles
crown); and A 1 Arthur shutout USC 3-0 as the
Cards dropped two of three to the Trojans at
Bovard Field in Los Angeles.
Individuals Shine
Except for the baseball teams's doubleheader
sweep against UCLA (with Arthur and Dave
Frost hurling the victories), individual
accomplishments dominated the next few weeks
of sports highlights. Sandy Mayer won his second
straight Cal State tennis title, defeating South
African pro Ray Moore in the finals. Brian Job
received the A 1 Masters Award presented to the
Stanford athlete "attaining the highest degree of
leadership, athletic achievement, and
scholarship." The Biff Hoffman award for the
outstanding Stanford athlete went to gymnast
Steve Hug.
Individual achievements were also noteworthy
in the 89th Big Meet. Cal defeated the Cards
84-70 at Stanford Stadium, but freshman Terry
Albritton became the third 18 year-old in history
to put the shot 61-6V2 as he set a new meet and

school record in that event. Brian Mittlestaedt
doubled in the mile and two mile; Dave Bagshaw
won the 120 high hurdle; Ken Curl won the 100;
Jim Howard took the discus; John Anderson
won the 440; and Tom Anderson won the long
jump in other Stanford individual wins.
Tlie underdog Whites beat the Reds 14-8 as
the football squad concluded four weeks of spring
drills on May 14 with the annual Red-White
game. The play was generally sloppy, but coach
Jack Christiansen was pleased with his team's
spring progress and expressed "cautious
optimism" in anticipation of next fall's opener
against Penn State on Sept. 15.
Sweep Over Cal
A lot of fans walked over to Sunken Diamond
after the Red-White game and watched the
baseball Cards sweep a doubleheader from Cal to
end its season in second place in the Pac-8
Southern Division with a 9-9 league record. The
team finished with a 34-20 overall mark as
sophomore Bob Hampton led the hitters with a
.393 average, and Bob DiPietro (5-2, 1.30), A 1
Arthur 7-2, 1.55), and Dave Frost (6-0, 2.11)
paced the mound corps.
Hampton, DiPietro, and freshman catcher
Dave Baker were named to the Pac-8 Southern
Division all-league squad.
Pac-8 competition in tennis, track, and golf
brought disappointing results in the next few
weeks. UCLA stunned Stanford and USC to win
the tennis crown at USC's new David Marks
tennis center; the track team finished last at
Eugene, Ore.; and the golfers made a final round
charge (sparked by a 64 by Dave Baskins and a
65 by Conrad Nilmeier) but still finished second
to USC at Clarkston Golf Course in Clarkston,
Wash.
But the 1972-73 Stanford sports season is far
from complete. NCAA competition remains in
tennis, track, and golf, and two Stanford athletes
(Rich Kelley and Brian Job) and Stanford swim
coach Jim Gaughran will be touring China this
summer on goodwill tours sponsored by the
State Department.
Of course the biggest remaining event is the
NCAA tennis championships at Princeton, New
Jersey, a tournament that Dick Gould and his
Cardinal team hopes will become the undisputed
highlight of Stanford's 1972-73 sports season.

BATTLE OF THE GIANTS-UCLA's seemingly
superhuman Bill Walton appears to have
established clear superiority over Stanford
9ophomore Rich Kelley in this picture, but
Kelley proved throughout the 1972-73 basketball
season that he was among the best mortal big
men in the nation. Kelley played Walton to a
virtual statistical standoff when the Cards nearly
upset the Bruins at Pauley Pavilion. In that
contest Kelley scored 15 points and grabbed 15
rebounds while Walton turned in a 23 point, 10
rebound performance.

McCLOUD FOR THE DEFENSE Senior defensive halfback Charles McCloud dives for a possible
interception during Stanford's 10-6 victory over Duke last fall. McCloud and his fellow defensive
backs led the Pacific Eight in pass defense, but coach Jack Christiansen's Cardinals still struggled
through a disappointing 6-5 season.

NCAA CHAMPION—Two-time Olympian Steve
Hug tied for the NCAA Ail-Around title at
Eugene, Ore. in April after winning a full share of
the crown last year. Hug will be back for his
senior season next year and will be competing for
an unprecedented third NCAA All-Around title.
It is ironic that after nine months of
competition in more than 15 sports, the most
memorable moment in 1972-73 Stanford
athletics was a loss. But that defeat, a thrilling
51-45 setback against national champion UCLA
at Pauley Pavilion, culminated the successful
reversal of Cardinal basketball fortunes and
certainly marked the highlight of Stanford's
sports year.
Coach Howie Dallmar's cagers, who had
assured Stanford's first winning season since
1966 the night before with a 50-47 victory over
USC, came into the UCLA game with dreams of
an upset but without any realistic hopes of
snapping the Bruins' awesome three-year winning
streak at 69. After the first half, however, 12,489
fans sat in stunned silence as the teams departed
for the dressing rooms with Stanford ahead,
25-18.
But when the second half began, the UCLA
crowd, apparently inspired by a halftime
presentation to coach John Wooden
commemorating his silver anniversary at UCLA,
suddenly came alive. Amid deafening roars from
the Bruin rooting section, UCLA scored two
baskets in the first 30 seconds to cut the Cardinal
lead to three.
About four minutes later, referee Charles
Reed allowed an obvious dunk by UCLA's Larry
Farmer (a call which is still causing recurring
nightmares for assistant coach Bub Bowling), and
l hen with 14:57 remaining, Keith Wilkes canned
two free throws to put the Bruins ahead for the
first time since the early moments of the game.
UCLA gradually pulled away and despite some
periodic Stanford surges, eventually recorded a
51-45 victory, the Bruins' 70th straight in a
seemingly endless streak.
UCLA went on to win a unprecedented sixth
straight national title, cruising through the
NCAA tournament without any serious scares.
The Bruins' final record was 30-0, and none of
those victories was as hard-earned as the March 3
win over Stanford.
Satisfying Victories
Of course 1972-73 Stanford athletic success
was not always measured by near misses.
Stanford teams recorded countless satisfying
victories during the past year, beginning on Sept.
16, when the Cardinals celebrated Jack
Christiansen's debut as head football coach with
a 44-0 victory over San Jose State at Stanford
Stadium.
The following week things weren't quite as
easy for the Cards in Durham, North Carolina. It
took two stingy goal line stands in the final
minutes (one from the four yard line and one
from the eight) to preserve a 10-6 victory over
the Duke Blue Devils in a regionally televised
contest.
The Cards ran their unbeaten streak to three
the next Saturday with a 41-35 victory over
previously undefeated West Virginia setting up an
October 7 showdown between the 15th ranked
Cards and the number one ranked USC Trojans,
a game that elicited varied commentary from
coaches and sportswriters throughout the
preceding week.
McKay Cautious
John McKay, whose undefeated Trojans were
rated 19 point favorites, continually tried to
minimize USC's advantage. "They'll (Stanford)
be a big test for us because they're the first team
we've met this year with an acceptable running
attack to go with an acceptable passing offense."
Meanwhile Jack Christiansen was ebullient in
his praise for the Trojans. "USC has a great
team," he said of a Trojan squad that had
outscored four previous opponents 189-42. "It's
very tough to see any weaknesses."
Not everyone was talking about strengths,
weaknesses, and statistics, though. San Francisco
Chronicle columnist Glenn Dickey admitted that
USC probably had the stronger football team,
but attacked the Trojan athletic department,
which he charged "has never been able to keep
football in perspective."
"I enjoy Stanford football because the
Cardinals (nee Indians) have done admirably with
the program, making it successful and yet
keeping it in perspective," Dickey wrote."That is
not easy, as even a cursory look around the
country will show.
"This Saturday at Palo Alto the Cards host
USC, a team which has never been able to keep
football in perspective; at USC, the tail has
wagged the dog so long, it thinks it is the dog.
Though Stanford has some good players, the
Trojans appear to be too strong for the Cards —
or anybody else.
"Yet, it has appeared that way for the last
two years, and Stanford has won so I'll be there
Saturday, rooting for the forces of good to
prevail."
USC 30, Stanford 21
84,000 fans assembled in Stanford Stadium
on Saturday to watch a 30-21 USC victory which
provoked even more controversy than the
pre-game discussions.
"They're the worst winners I've ever come up
against," cried McKay after his Trojans had tried
a pass play with two seconds left and a
nine-point lead. "I'd like to beat them by 2000
points."
But McKay wasn't through. "Why is it when
we play these hotshots there are no penalties
called both ways. They've shown no class against
us."
Christiansen declined to comment on McKay's
verbal tirade. "I learned a long time ago that it's
no use getting in a contest with a skunk," Chris
said.
The game itself was sloppy but exciting.
Stanford scored first when James Ferguson
recovered a Trojan fumble in the end zone. After
two Rod Garcia field goals and two USC
touchdowns the score was tied 13-13 with 1:24
left in the first half.
But when the Cards got set to punt, center
Bill Reid's snap sailed over Dave Ottmar's head
and USC defensive end James Sims recovered on
Stanford's five yard line. Two plays later
Anthony Davis scored to give the Trojans a 20-13
halftime advantage.
Toughest For Trojans
USC controlled the second half and eventually
recorded its nine point victory. It was easily the
toughest game of the year for the undefeated
national champions, but it was a victory which all
but eliminated the Cards from Rose Bowl
contention.
Christiansen, however, refused to give up. "I
don't think we're out of it [Rose Bowl race) by
any means," he said. "We still have a great
chance."

The Cards' dim Rose Bowl hopes stayed alive
the following week when Stanford scored an
impressive 24-0 victory over an undefeated
Washington team, but a week later Dan Fouts
and the Oregon Ducks ended any thoughts of
New Year's Day in Pasadena with a 15-13 upset
in Eugene.
Stanford then defeated Oregon State (as Rod
Garcia became the most prolific field goal kicker
in Stanford history with his 22nd career field
goal), lost to UCLA 28-23 at the Los Angeles
Coliseum, and lost to Washington State 27-13 in
Pullman as Mike Boryla spent most of the
afternoon on his back.
Stanford's grid record stood at a dismal 5-4
as the Cards prepared for the Big Game in
Berkeley. The game had no real significance as
far as the Pac-8 race was concerned. The
traditional Big Game bonfire was cancelled and
the Band's activities in San Francisco were
curtailed by a police ordinance, but emotions
were still high on both sides for the 75th renewal
of the Big Game rivalry.
"The significance of the game goes without
saying," said Cal coach Mike White, who was
struggling though his first year as the Bears' head
coach after assisting John Ralston at Stanford.
"I have a lot of friends at Stanford, most of
them players, and I respect them. I know they'd
like to beat the hell out of me because that's the
way it is in athletics."
Mud Bowl
The "Big Game Mud Bowl" was played on a
field Christiansen called "the worst I've ever
seen," but 68,000 fans were treated to one of the
most thrilling football games in recent memory.
With four seconds left on the clock, Cal had the
ball on the Stanford seven yard line. It was
fourth down, Cal trailed 21-18, and everyone at
California Memorial Stadium expected a field
goal attempt.
But freshman quarterback Vince Ferragamo
broke out of the huddle and strode confidently
to the line of scrimmage for one final play. He
dropped back, rolled to his right, and with no
time on the clock threw a perfect strike to Steve
Sweeney in the left corner of the end zone.
"I never thought of going for a tie," said an
elated White. "This game means too much."
The Cards were idle the following week, but

during that period Rod Garcia, Jim Merlo, and
Randy Poltl were named to the first team
All-Pacific Eight squad and Merlo, Poltl and
Younger Klippert were selected to the AP's
All-Coast first team.
Eric Cross was only an honorable mention
all-league selection, but on Dec. 2 in Honolulu the
5-10 senior made the selection committee think
twice about its first team receivers. Cross caught
14 passes and took over the Pac-8 lead with 53 as
the Cards ripped the Hawaii Rainbows 39-7. He
also tied the Stanford record with his ninth
touchdown reception of the season and broke
the Pac-8 record for single game catches.
Stanford's final point of the season was scored
by Steve Murray, who kicked the extra point
after Stanford's last score. Murray, who normally
held for Rod Garcia, booted the ball squarely
through the uprights as the two reversed roles for
the final play.
The team's final record was a disappointing
6-5 (2-5 in the league), but while the varsity was
struggling against Pac-8 opponents, the Card
junior varsity recorded Stanford's first
undefeated JV season since 1965. First year
coahc Hudson Houck directed his team to a 4-0
record, including two shutous.
The Cards outscored their opponents 143-22
and while the offense rolled up over 900 yards
on the ground, the defense held four opponents
to a meager 51 net yards rushing.
The cross country ttam also completed a
successful season, winning the Pac-8 Southern
Division title before finishing fourth in the Pac-8
meet. Brian Mittelstaedt and Tony Sandoval
placed 1-2 in the Southern Division event at the
Stanford golf course.
Women Win
The women's swimming team added another
highlight to Stanford's fall quarter collection,
winning the 12-team Northern California
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference meet in
Sacramento.
After the final Pac-8 football statistics (which
showed Mike Boryla leading the league in total
offense and passing and Eric Cross on top of the
receiving charts) were released, Stanford fans
turned their attention to a basketball team which
promised to be the youngest, tallest, and possibly
best Stanford team in nearly a decade.
The Cards opened their season against a USF
team which boasted top 20 preseason national
rankings and a front line averaging 6-9. Stanford
coach Howie Dallmar countered with a youthful
lineup featuring three sophomores and two
juniors. Dallmar admitted that "USF will be a
tough assignment for a young team to face in its
first game."
A nervous Stanford team took the floor on
Dec. 1 at USF's Memorial Gymnasium. The Dons
jumped out to an early lead and despite
creditable performances by Mike Mann (16
points, 12 rebounds) and Rich Kelley (12 points,
14 rebounds, eight blocked shots), countless
turnovers doomed the Cards and USF eventually
recorded an 83-68 victory.
Three days later, however, Stanford scored its
first victory of the season, defeating Arizona
75-68 before a small but appreciative Maples
Pavilion crowd. After a two week break for
finals, the Cards played seven games during
Christmas vacation, including a 77-72 loss to
eventual NIT champ Virginia Tech in the finals
of the Old Dominion Classic at Norfolk, Va.
Winning Record
When Dallmar and his squad returned home
just before New Year's Day, the Pacific Eight
Council had already granted Mike Boryla an
extra year of football eligibility and Stanford's
basketball record stood at 5-4, marking the first
time in six years that the Cards would enter
Pac-8 play with a winning record.
But when the league season began on Jan. 6 in
Pullman, Wash., the Cards continued to play an
unpredictable brand of basketball. Stanford shot
26.4 percent from the floor in a 61-49 loss to
lowly Washington State in the conference
opener, and then completely reversed gears two
nights later in Seattle, romping past Washington's
highly-rated Huskies, 76-55. TTie Cards jumped
out to a 24-2 lead in that game, and Kelley
finished the contest with 24 points and 17
rebounds.
The following week Stanford lost by a
respectable 15 points to UCLA on Friday but
played its worst basketball of the year in an
83-67 Saturday night loss against USC. Stanford
then won two in a row, including an 80-68 win at
UC Santa Barbara where freshman Tim
Patterson was 10-10 from the floor and scored
22 points.
Merlo Drafted
Meanwhile Jim Merlo was selected in the
fourth round of the NFL draft by New Orleans
and Mike Askea and Roger Cowan were also
picked. That weekend, Stanford upset UCLA in
swimming 60-53; the basketball team won its

third in a row against California; and Coach Dick
Gould's tennis squad opened its quest for the
NCAA title by winning the first annual National
Indoor tournament in Madison, Wise.
The Cards defeated North Carolina and Trinity
in the opening rounds of the team dual match
event to reach the semifinals, where Stanford
stopped USC, 6-3. In the finals the next day,
UCLA fell to the Cards by an identical 6-3 score
and the netmen were on their way to an eventful
1973 campaign.
A week later the basketball team's three game
win streak was snapped when the Cards suffered
from a turnover epidemic in the Pacific
Northwest. Oregon and Oregon State took
advantage of 53 Cardinal miscues over the
weekend as both the Ducks and the Beavers
recorded six-point victories.
Things improved slightly when the teams met
again the next week at Maples Pavilion, but the
Cards squandered a 10-point second half lead
against Oregon to spoil a weekend which began
impressively the night before with an 81-70
victory over the 18th ranked Beavers.
World Record
That same weekend four Cardinal runners
blazed around the track at Idaho State's
minidome in 1:27.4, setting a new world indoor
record for the 880 yard relay. Ken Curl, John
Kessel, Matt Hogsett, and John Anderson
comprised the record-setting team.
In the next week the cagers swept two games
from Washington and Washington State; the
tennis team cruised to an easy victory in the
Northern California Intercollegiates; and Chris
Horpel finished second in the Pac-8 wrestling
meet.
And while the basketball team was completing
its memorable weekend in Los Angeles a week
later, Payton Jordan's track squad opened its
outdoor season, splashing to a 128-31 victory
over Fresno State in rain-soaked Stanford
Stadium. In Santa Monica, Stanford finished a
disappointing fourth in the Pac-8 swimming
meet, but Cardinal swimmers turned in some
outstanding individual performances.
John Hencken set a conference record of 57.7
in the 100 yard breaststroke, touching out
teammate Brian Job, who set the old mark in last
year's meet. In the 200, however, Job edged
Olympic gold medal winner Hencken in 2:05.4.
As championship competition continued for
winter sports teams, the list of highlights
mounted. Steve Hug won the all-around title at
the Pac-8 gymnastics meet as a depleted Cardinal
squad finished third behind California and
Washington. Howard Bessen won the rings, Ted
Marcy took the side horse, and Shawn Skerrett
placed second in the vault to join Hug on the list
of NCAA qualifiers.
Hug Ties NCAA's
Hug later tied for the all-around title at the
NCAA meet in Eugene, Ore., the second straight
year the two-time Olympian had gained at least a
share of the all-around title. The swimmers were
also successful in NCAA competition, placing
sixth in the Knoxville, Tenn. meet as Hencken
won the 100 breast, Job finished second in the
200, and Dean Anderson swam to an impressive
third place finish in the 100 free. At the NCAA
wrestling meet, an injured Horpel still managed a
fifth place finish in the 142 pound weight
division.
Back at Stanford, 6652 fans watched the
Cards conclude their most successful basketball
season since 1966 with a 70-66 victory over Cal
at Maples. Seniors Bob Buell and Pat Rusco got
the Cards going, but it was Kelley who came
through in the clutch, scoring Stanford's final 14
points in a performance that clearly established
him as one of the finest players in the nation.
Stanford finished the season with a 14-11
record (7-7 in the league) and Kelley earned first
team All-Pac-8 recognition along with Bill Walton
and Keith Wilkes of UCLA, Washington's Louie
Nelson, and Oregon freshman Ron Lee.
Statistically, the talented seven footer averaged
17.3 points, 13.7 rebounds, shot 51.8 percent
from the floor, and 70.5 from the foul line.
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar was certainly
pleased with Kelley's season, and also expressed
satisfaction over the team's winning record. "We
were young and made mistakes, but it was an
exciting team to watch," Dallmar said, adding
that "we anticipate being much stronger next
year."
Spring Sports
After the last basketball game, spring sports
teams began to occupy the spotlight. Bud
Finger's golfers won their first major tournament
of the season at the Pacific Coast Invitational in
Santa Barbara, triumphing over a strong field
which included national powers USC, Long
Beach State, and Arizona State. A few days later,
however, athletic director Joseph Ruetz offered
to forfeit the championship when it was learned
that Bruce Robertson had lost his amateur status
because of a rules violation involving the sale of
golf equipment.
The USGA ruled that Robertson was no
longer an amateur, and the Stanford sophomore
was forced to withdraw from the Masters
tournament. Robertson had earned a berth in the
prestigious event by finishing sixth in the U.S.
Amateur in September and was about to leave
for Augusta, Ga. when he learned of the USGA
decision.
Stanford played without Robertson at the
University of Pacific Invitational, and the golfers
were one of four spring teams that floundered
over the weekend. The baseball team, which had
compiled a 17-8 record in non-league
competition and boasted a 12th place national
ranking, lost two out of three games to UCLA in
its conference opener; the tennis team was
shocked twice in Los Angeles, losing 6-3 to USC
and 5-4 to UCLA; the track team lost 101-50 to
defending NCAA champion UCLA; and the
golfers finished third at UOP even though George
Pettinger (Robertson's replacement) fired rounds
of 74-71 for a third place individual finish.
Things looked up at the Farm in the next few
weeks, though. Ray Young's baseball team
played well at Sunken Diamond in a three game
series against the defending national champion
USC Trojans. USC won 2-1 and 3-0, but Bob
DiPietro sandwiched a brilliant three-hit shutout
in between the two losses, blanking the Trojans,
1-0 in the first game of Saturday's doubleheader
while striking out 13.
Tennis Revenge
The next week 2500 fans jammed the varsity
tennis courts to watch the Cards avenge their
earlier losses to USC and UCLA. This time
Stanford prevailed 7-2 over the Bruins and 5-4
over the Trojans as the Cards won 10 of 12
singles matches.

On April 28, as the netmen began their
defense of the Ojai Intercollegiate tennis title,
204 players representing 34 teams swarmed over
the Stanford golf course for the sixth annual U.S.
Collegiate Invitational. The field was obviously
"quantity not quality" as only San Jose State
could mount any serious threat to the Cards.
Stanford eventually won the 54-hole event by
two strokes over the Spartans and Cardinal
sophomore Conrad Nilmeier defeated San Jose's
Phil Barry in a sudden death playoff to win the
individual title.
About the same time Nilmeier won the
sudden death playoff, freshman John Whitlinger
and Pat DuPre clinched the Ojai tennis title with
a 7-6, 3-6, 7-6 semifinal doubles victory over the
USC team of Sashi Menon-John Andrews. The
Cards finished with 16 points compared to 14 for
second place USC. UCLA was third as the "Big
Three" continued its five round struggle for
national tennis supremacy.
The following week the netmen beat Cal 8-1
to conclude a 15-2 dual match season; the
women's tennis team triumphed in the Northern
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference
tournament (Andrea Barnes won the singles title
and Whitney Grant-Terry Albert won the doubles
crown); and A 1 Arthur shutout USC 3-0 as the
Cards dropped two of three to the Trojans at
Bovard Field in Los Angeles.
Individuals Shine
Except for the baseball teams's doubleheader
sweep against UCLA (with Arthur and Dave
Frost hurling the victories), individual
accomplishments dominated the next few weeks
of sports highlights. Sandy Mayer won his second
straight Cal State tennis title, defeating South
African pro Ray Moore in the finals. Brian Job
received the A 1 Masters Award presented to the
Stanford athlete "attaining the highest degree of
leadership, athletic achievement, and
scholarship." The Biff Hoffman award for the
outstanding Stanford athlete went to gymnast
Steve Hug.
Individual achievements were also noteworthy
in the 89th Big Meet. Cal defeated the Cards
84-70 at Stanford Stadium, but freshman Terry
Albritton became the third 18 year-old in history
to put the shot 61-6V2 as he set a new meet and

school record in that event. Brian Mittlestaedt
doubled in the mile and two mile; Dave Bagshaw
won the 120 high hurdle; Ken Curl won the 100;
Jim Howard took the discus; John Anderson
won the 440; and Tom Anderson won the long
jump in other Stanford individual wins.
Tlie underdog Whites beat the Reds 14-8 as
the football squad concluded four weeks of spring
drills on May 14 with the annual Red-White
game. The play was generally sloppy, but coach
Jack Christiansen was pleased with his team's
spring progress and expressed "cautious
optimism" in anticipation of next fall's opener
against Penn State on Sept. 15.
Sweep Over Cal
A lot of fans walked over to Sunken Diamond
after the Red-White game and watched the
baseball Cards sweep a doubleheader from Cal to
end its season in second place in the Pac-8
Southern Division with a 9-9 league record. The
team finished with a 34-20 overall mark as
sophomore Bob Hampton led the hitters with a
.393 average, and Bob DiPietro (5-2, 1.30), A 1
Arthur 7-2, 1.55), and Dave Frost (6-0, 2.11)
paced the mound corps.
Hampton, DiPietro, and freshman catcher
Dave Baker were named to the Pac-8 Southern
Division all-league squad.
Pac-8 competition in tennis, track, and golf
brought disappointing results in the next few
weeks. UCLA stunned Stanford and USC to win
the tennis crown at USC's new David Marks
tennis center; the track team finished last at
Eugene, Ore.; and the golfers made a final round
charge (sparked by a 64 by Dave Baskins and a
65 by Conrad Nilmeier) but still finished second
to USC at Clarkston Golf Course in Clarkston,
Wash.
But the 1972-73 Stanford sports season is far
from complete. NCAA competition remains in
tennis, track, and golf, and two Stanford athletes
(Rich Kelley and Brian Job) and Stanford swim
coach Jim Gaughran will be touring China this
summer on goodwill tours sponsored by the
State Department.
Of course the biggest remaining event is the
NCAA tennis championships at Princeton, New
Jersey, a tournament that Dick Gould and his
Cardinal team hopes will become the undisputed
highlight of Stanford's 1972-73 sports season.

BATTLE OF THE GIANTS-UCLA's seemingly
superhuman Bill Walton appears to have
established clear superiority over Stanford
9ophomore Rich Kelley in this picture, but
Kelley proved throughout the 1972-73 basketball
season that he was among the best mortal big
men in the nation. Kelley played Walton to a
virtual statistical standoff when the Cards nearly
upset the Bruins at Pauley Pavilion. In that
contest Kelley scored 15 points and grabbed 15
rebounds while Walton turned in a 23 point, 10
rebound performance.

NCAA CHAMPION—Two-time Olympian Steve
Hug tied for the NCAA Ail-Around title at
Eugene, Ore. in April after winning a full share of
the crown last year. Hug will be back for his
senior season next year and will be competing for
an unprecedented third NCAA All-Around title.
It is ironic that after nine months of
competition in more than 15 sports, the most
memorable moment in 1972-73 Stanford
athletics was a loss. But that defeat, a thrilling
51-45 setback against national champion UCLA
at Pauley Pavilion, culminated the successful
reversal of Cardinal basketball fortunes and
certainly marked the highlight of Stanford's
sports year.
Coach Howie Dallmar's cagers, who had
assured Stanford's first winning season since
1966 the night before with a 50-47 victory over
USC, came into the UCLA game with dreams of
an upset but without any realistic hopes of
snapping the Bruins' awesome three-year winning
streak at 69. After the first half, however, 12,489
fans sat in stunned silence as the teams departed
for the dressing rooms with Stanford ahead,
25-18.
But when the second half began, the UCLA
crowd, apparently inspired by a halftime
presentation to coach John Wooden
commemorating his silver anniversary at UCLA,
suddenly came alive. Amid deafening roars from
the Bruin rooting section, UCLA scored two
baskets in the first 30 seconds to cut the Cardinal
lead to three.
About four minutes later, referee Charles
Reed allowed an obvious dunk by UCLA's Larry
Farmer (a call which is still causing recurring
nightmares for assistant coach Bub Bowling), and
l hen with 14:57 remaining, Keith Wilkes canned
two free throws to put the Bruins ahead for the
first time since the early moments of the game.
UCLA gradually pulled away and despite some
periodic Stanford surges, eventually recorded a
51-45 victory, the Bruins' 70th straight in a
seemingly endless streak.
UCLA went on to win a unprecedented sixth
straight national title, cruising through the
NCAA tournament without any serious scares.
The Bruins' final record was 30-0, and none of
those victories was as hard-earned as the March 3
win over Stanford.
Satisfying Victories
Of course 1972-73 Stanford athletic success
was not always measured by near misses.
Stanford teams recorded countless satisfying
victories during the past year, beginning on Sept.
16, when the Cardinals celebrated Jack
Christiansen's debut as head football coach with
a 44-0 victory over San Jose State at Stanford
Stadium.
The following week things weren't quite as
easy for the Cards in Durham, North Carolina. It
took two stingy goal line stands in the final
minutes (one from the four yard line and one
from the eight) to preserve a 10-6 victory over
the Duke Blue Devils in a regionally televised
contest.
The Cards ran their unbeaten streak to three
the next Saturday with a 41-35 victory over
previously undefeated West Virginia setting up an
October 7 showdown between the 15th ranked
Cards and the number one ranked USC Trojans,
a game that elicited varied commentary from
coaches and sportswriters throughout the
preceding week.
McKay Cautious
John McKay, whose undefeated Trojans were
rated 19 point favorites, continually tried to
minimize USC's advantage. "They'll (Stanford)
be a big test for us because they're the first team
we've met this year with an acceptable running
attack to go with an acceptable passing offense."
Meanwhile Jack Christiansen was ebullient in
his praise for the Trojans. "USC has a great
team," he said of a Trojan squad that had
outscored four previous opponents 189-42. "It's
very tough to see any weaknesses."
Not everyone was talking about strengths,
weaknesses, and statistics, though. San Francisco
Chronicle columnist Glenn Dickey admitted that
USC probably had the stronger football team,
but attacked the Trojan athletic department,
which he charged "has never been able to keep
football in perspective."
"I enjoy Stanford football because the
Cardinals (nee Indians) have done admirably with
the program, making it successful and yet
keeping it in perspective," Dickey wrote."That is
not easy, as even a cursory look around the
country will show.
"This Saturday at Palo Alto the Cards host
USC, a team which has never been able to keep
football in perspective; at USC, the tail has
wagged the dog so long, it thinks it is the dog.
Though Stanford has some good players, the
Trojans appear to be too strong for the Cards —
or anybody else.
"Yet, it has appeared that way for the last
two years, and Stanford has won so I'll be there
Saturday, rooting for the forces of good to
prevail."
USC 30, Stanford 21
84,000 fans assembled in Stanford Stadium
on Saturday to watch a 30-21 USC victory which
provoked even more controversy than the
pre-game discussions.
"They're the worst winners I've ever come up
against," cried McKay after his Trojans had tried
a pass play with two seconds left and a
nine-point lead. "I'd like to beat them by 2000
points."
But McKay wasn't through. "Why is it when
we play these hotshots there are no penalties
called both ways. They've shown no class against
us."
Christiansen declined to comment on McKay's
verbal tirade. "I learned a long time ago that it's
no use getting in a contest with a skunk," Chris
said.
The game itself was sloppy but exciting.
Stanford scored first when James Ferguson
recovered a Trojan fumble in the end zone. After
two Rod Garcia field goals and two USC
touchdowns the score was tied 13-13 with 1:24
left in the first half.
But when the Cards got set to punt, center
Bill Reid's snap sailed over Dave Ottmar's head
and USC defensive end James Sims recovered on
Stanford's five yard line. Two plays later
Anthony Davis scored to give the Trojans a 20-13
halftime advantage.
Toughest For Trojans
USC controlled the second half and eventually
recorded its nine point victory. It was easily the
toughest game of the year for the undefeated
national champions, but it was a victory which all
but eliminated the Cards from Rose Bowl
contention.
Christiansen, however, refused to give up. "I
don't think we're out of it [Rose Bowl race) by
any means," he said. "We still have a great
chance."

The Cards' dim Rose Bowl hopes stayed alive
the following week when Stanford scored an
impressive 24-0 victory over an undefeated
Washington team, but a week later Dan Fouts
and the Oregon Ducks ended any thoughts of
New Year's Day in Pasadena with a 15-13 upset
in Eugene.
Stanford then defeated Oregon State (as Rod
Garcia became the most prolific field goal kicker
in Stanford history with his 22nd career field
goal), lost to UCLA 28-23 at the Los Angeles
Coliseum, and lost to Washington State 27-13 in
Pullman as Mike Boryla spent most of the
afternoon on his back.
Stanford's grid record stood at a dismal 5-4
as the Cards prepared for the Big Game in
Berkeley. The game had no real significance as
far as the Pac-8 race was concerned. The
traditional Big Game bonfire was cancelled and
the Band's activities in San Francisco were
curtailed by a police ordinance, but emotions
were still high on both sides for the 75th renewal
of the Big Game rivalry.
"The significance of the game goes without
saying," said Cal coach Mike White, who was
struggling though his first year as the Bears' head
coach after assisting John Ralston at Stanford.
"I have a lot of friends at Stanford, most of
them players, and I respect them. I know they'd
like to beat the hell out of me because that's the
way it is in athletics."
Mud Bowl
The "Big Game Mud Bowl" was played on a
field Christiansen called "the worst I've ever
seen," but 68,000 fans were treated to one of the
most thrilling football games in recent memory.
With four seconds left on the clock, Cal had the
ball on the Stanford seven yard line. It was
fourth down, Cal trailed 21-18, and everyone at
California Memorial Stadium expected a field
goal attempt.
But freshman quarterback Vince Ferragamo
broke out of the huddle and strode confidently
to the line of scrimmage for one final play. He
dropped back, rolled to his right, and with no
time on the clock threw a perfect strike to Steve
Sweeney in the left corner of the end zone.
"I never thought of going for a tie," said an
elated White. "This game means too much."
The Cards were idle the following week, but

during that period Rod Garcia, Jim Merlo, and
Randy Poltl were named to the first team
All-Pacific Eight squad and Merlo, Poltl and
Younger Klippert were selected to the AP's
All-Coast first team.
Eric Cross was only an honorable mention
all-league selection, but on Dec. 2 in Honolulu the
5-10 senior made the selection committee think
twice about its first team receivers. Cross caught
14 passes and took over the Pac-8 lead with 53 as
the Cards ripped the Hawaii Rainbows 39-7. He
also tied the Stanford record with his ninth
touchdown reception of the season and broke
the Pac-8 record for single game catches.
Stanford's final point of the season was scored
by Steve Murray, who kicked the extra point
after Stanford's last score. Murray, who normally
held for Rod Garcia, booted the ball squarely
through the uprights as the two reversed roles for
the final play.
The team's final record was a disappointing
6-5 (2-5 in the league), but while the varsity was
struggling against Pac-8 opponents, the Card
junior varsity recorded Stanford's first
undefeated JV season since 1965. First year
coahc Hudson Houck directed his team to a 4-0
record, including two shutous.
The Cards outscored their opponents 143-22
and while the offense rolled up over 900 yards
on the ground, the defense held four opponents
to a meager 51 net yards rushing.
The cross country ttam also completed a
successful season, winning the Pac-8 Southern
Division title before finishing fourth in the Pac-8
meet. Brian Mittelstaedt and Tony Sandoval
placed 1-2 in the Southern Division event at the
Stanford golf course.
Women Win
The women's swimming team added another
highlight to Stanford's fall quarter collection,
winning the 12-team Northern California
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference meet in
Sacramento.
After the final Pac-8 football statistics (which
showed Mike Boryla leading the league in total
offense and passing and Eric Cross on top of the
receiving charts) were released, Stanford fans
turned their attention to a basketball team which
promised to be the youngest, tallest, and possibly
best Stanford team in nearly a decade.
The Cards opened their season against a USF
team which boasted top 20 preseason national
rankings and a front line averaging 6-9. Stanford
coach Howie Dallmar countered with a youthful
lineup featuring three sophomores and two
juniors. Dallmar admitted that "USF will be a
tough assignment for a young team to face in its
first game."
A nervous Stanford team took the floor on
Dec. 1 at USF's Memorial Gymnasium. The Dons
jumped out to an early lead and despite
creditable performances by Mike Mann (16
points, 12 rebounds) and Rich Kelley (12 points,
14 rebounds, eight blocked shots), countless
turnovers doomed the Cards and USF eventually
recorded an 83-68 victory.
Three days later, however, Stanford scored its
first victory of the season, defeating Arizona
75-68 before a small but appreciative Maples
Pavilion crowd. After a two week break for
finals, the Cards played seven games during
Christmas vacation, including a 77-72 loss to
eventual NIT champ Virginia Tech in the finals
of the Old Dominion Classic at Norfolk, Va.
Winning Record
When Dallmar and his squad returned home
just before New Year's Day, the Pacific Eight
Council had already granted Mike Boryla an
extra year of football eligibility and Stanford's
basketball record stood at 5-4, marking the first
time in six years that the Cards would enter
Pac-8 play with a winning record.
But when the league season began on Jan. 6 in
Pullman, Wash., the Cards continued to play an
unpredictable brand of basketball. Stanford shot
26.4 percent from the floor in a 61-49 loss to
lowly Washington State in the conference
opener, and then completely reversed gears two
nights later in Seattle, romping past Washington's
highly-rated Huskies, 76-55. TTie Cards jumped
out to a 24-2 lead in that game, and Kelley
finished the contest with 24 points and 17
rebounds.
The following week Stanford lost by a
respectable 15 points to UCLA on Friday but
played its worst basketball of the year in an
83-67 Saturday night loss against USC. Stanford
then won two in a row, including an 80-68 win at
UC Santa Barbara where freshman Tim
Patterson was 10-10 from the floor and scored
22 points.
Merlo Drafted
Meanwhile Jim Merlo was selected in the
fourth round of the NFL draft by New Orleans
and Mike Askea and Roger Cowan were also
picked. That weekend, Stanford upset UCLA in
swimming 60-53; the basketball team won its

third in a row against California; and Coach Dick
Gould's tennis squad opened its quest for the
NCAA title by winning the first annual National
Indoor tournament in Madison, Wise.
The Cards defeated North Carolina and Trinity
in the opening rounds of the team dual match
event to reach the semifinals, where Stanford
stopped USC, 6-3. In the finals the next day,
UCLA fell to the Cards by an identical 6-3 score
and the netmen were on their way to an eventful
1973 campaign.
A week later the basketball team's three game
win streak was snapped when the Cards suffered
from a turnover epidemic in the Pacific
Northwest. Oregon and Oregon State took
advantage of 53 Cardinal miscues over the
weekend as both the Ducks and the Beavers
recorded six-point victories.
Things improved slightly when the teams met
again the next week at Maples Pavilion, but the
Cards squandered a 10-point second half lead
against Oregon to spoil a weekend which began
impressively the night before with an 81-70
victory over the 18th ranked Beavers.
World Record
That same weekend four Cardinal runners
blazed around the track at Idaho State's
minidome in 1:27.4, setting a new world indoor
record for the 880 yard relay. Ken Curl, John
Kessel, Matt Hogsett, and John Anderson
comprised the record-setting team.
In the next week the cagers swept two games
from Washington and Washington State; the
tennis team cruised to an easy victory in the
Northern California Intercollegiates; and Chris
Horpel finished second in the Pac-8 wrestling
meet.
And while the basketball team was completing
its memorable weekend in Los Angeles a week
later, Payton Jordan's track squad opened its
outdoor season, splashing to a 128-31 victory
over Fresno State in rain-soaked Stanford
Stadium. In Santa Monica, Stanford finished a
disappointing fourth in the Pac-8 swimming
meet, but Cardinal swimmers turned in some
outstanding individual performances.
John Hencken set a conference record of 57.7
in the 100 yard breaststroke, touching out
teammate Brian Job, who set the old mark in last
year's meet. In the 200, however, Job edged
Olympic gold medal winner Hencken in 2:05.4.
As championship competition continued for
winter sports teams, the list of highlights
mounted. Steve Hug won the all-around title at
the Pac-8 gymnastics meet as a depleted Cardinal
squad finished third behind California and
Washington. Howard Bessen won the rings, Ted
Marcy took the side horse, and Shawn Skerrett
placed second in the vault to join Hug on the list
of NCAA qualifiers.
Hug Ties NCAA's
Hug later tied for the all-around title at the
NCAA meet in Eugene, Ore., the second straight
year the two-time Olympian had gained at least a
share of the all-around title. The swimmers were
also successful in NCAA competition, placing
sixth in the Knoxville, Tenn. meet as Hencken
won the 100 breast, Job finished second in the
200, and Dean Anderson swam to an impressive
third place finish in the 100 free. At the NCAA
wrestling meet, an injured Horpel still managed a
fifth place finish in the 142 pound weight
division.
Back at Stanford, 6652 fans watched the
Cards conclude their most successful basketball
season since 1966 with a 70-66 victory over Cal
at Maples. Seniors Bob Buell and Pat Rusco got
the Cards going, but it was Kelley who came
through in the clutch, scoring Stanford's final 14
points in a performance that clearly established
him as one of the finest players in the nation.
Stanford finished the season with a 14-11
record (7-7 in the league) and Kelley earned first
team All-Pac-8 recognition along with Bill Walton
and Keith Wilkes of UCLA, Washington's Louie
Nelson, and Oregon freshman Ron Lee.
Statistically, the talented seven footer averaged
17.3 points, 13.7 rebounds, shot 51.8 percent
from the floor, and 70.5 from the foul line.
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar was certainly
pleased with Kelley's season, and also expressed
satisfaction over the team's winning record. "We
were young and made mistakes, but it was an
exciting team to watch," Dallmar said, adding
that "we anticipate being much stronger next
year."
Spring Sports
After the last basketball game, spring sports
teams began to occupy the spotlight. Bud
Finger's golfers won their first major tournament
of the season at the Pacific Coast Invitational in
Santa Barbara, triumphing over a strong field
which included national powers USC, Long
Beach State, and Arizona State. A few days later,
however, athletic director Joseph Ruetz offered
to forfeit the championship when it was learned
that Bruce Robertson had lost his amateur status
because of a rules violation involving the sale of
golf equipment.
The USGA ruled that Robertson was no
longer an amateur, and the Stanford sophomore
was forced to withdraw from the Masters
tournament. Robertson had earned a berth in the
prestigious event by finishing sixth in the U.S.
Amateur in September and was about to leave
for Augusta, Ga. when he learned of the USGA
decision.
Stanford played without Robertson at the
University of Pacific Invitational, and the golfers
were one of four spring teams that floundered
over the weekend. The baseball team, which had
compiled a 17-8 record in non-league
competition and boasted a 12th place national
ranking, lost two out of three games to UCLA in
its conference opener; the tennis team was
shocked twice in Los Angeles, losing 6-3 to USC
and 5-4 to UCLA; the track team lost 101-50 to
defending NCAA champion UCLA; and the
golfers finished third at UOP even though George
Pettinger (Robertson's replacement) fired rounds
of 74-71 for a third place individual finish.
Things looked up at the Farm in the next few
weeks, though. Ray Young's baseball team
played well at Sunken Diamond in a three game
series against the defending national champion
USC Trojans. USC won 2-1 and 3-0, but Bob
DiPietro sandwiched a brilliant three-hit shutout
in between the two losses, blanking the Trojans,
1-0 in the first game of Saturday's doubleheader
while striking out 13.
Tennis Revenge
The next week 2500 fans jammed the varsity
tennis courts to watch the Cards avenge their
earlier losses to USC and UCLA. This time
Stanford prevailed 7-2 over the Bruins and 5-4
over the Trojans as the Cards won 10 of 12
singles matches.

On April 28, as the netmen began their
defense of the Ojai Intercollegiate tennis title,
204 players representing 34 teams swarmed over
the Stanford golf course for the sixth annual U.S.
Collegiate Invitational. The field was obviously
"quantity not quality" as only San Jose State
could mount any serious threat to the Cards.
Stanford eventually won the 54-hole event by
two strokes over the Spartans and Cardinal
sophomore Conrad Nilmeier defeated San Jose's
Phil Barry in a sudden death playoff to win the
individual title.
About the same time Nilmeier won the
sudden death playoff, freshman John Whitlinger
and Pat DuPre clinched the Ojai tennis title with
a 7-6, 3-6, 7-6 semifinal doubles victory over the
USC team of Sashi Menon-John Andrews. The
Cards finished with 16 points compared to 14 for
second place USC. UCLA was third as the "Big
Three" continued its five round struggle for
national tennis supremacy.
The following week the netmen beat Cal 8-1
to conclude a 15-2 dual match season; the
women's tennis team triumphed in the Northern
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference
tournament (Andrea Barnes won the singles title
and Whitney Grant-Terry Albert won the doubles
crown); and A 1 Arthur shutout USC 3-0 as the
Cards dropped two of three to the Trojans at
Bovard Field in Los Angeles.
Individuals Shine
Except for the baseball teams's doubleheader
sweep against UCLA (with Arthur and Dave
Frost hurling the victories), individual
accomplishments dominated the next few weeks
of sports highlights. Sandy Mayer won his second
straight Cal State tennis title, defeating South
African pro Ray Moore in the finals. Brian Job
received the A 1 Masters Award presented to the
Stanford athlete "attaining the highest degree of
leadership, athletic achievement, and
scholarship." The Biff Hoffman award for the
outstanding Stanford athlete went to gymnast
Steve Hug.
Individual achievements were also noteworthy
in the 89th Big Meet. Cal defeated the Cards
84-70 at Stanford Stadium, but freshman Terry
Albritton became the third 18 year-old in history
to put the shot 61-6V2 as he set a new meet and

school record in that event. Brian Mittlestaedt
doubled in the mile and two mile; Dave Bagshaw
won the 120 high hurdle; Ken Curl won the 100;
Jim Howard took the discus; John Anderson
won the 440; and Tom Anderson won the long
jump in other Stanford individual wins.
Tlie underdog Whites beat the Reds 14-8 as
the football squad concluded four weeks of spring
drills on May 14 with the annual Red-White
game. The play was generally sloppy, but coach
Jack Christiansen was pleased with his team's
spring progress and expressed "cautious
optimism" in anticipation of next fall's opener
against Penn State on Sept. 15.
Sweep Over Cal
A lot of fans walked over to Sunken Diamond
after the Red-White game and watched the
baseball Cards sweep a doubleheader from Cal to
end its season in second place in the Pac-8
Southern Division with a 9-9 league record. The
team finished with a 34-20 overall mark as
sophomore Bob Hampton led the hitters with a
.393 average, and Bob DiPietro (5-2, 1.30), A 1
Arthur 7-2, 1.55), and Dave Frost (6-0, 2.11)
paced the mound corps.
Hampton, DiPietro, and freshman catcher
Dave Baker were named to the Pac-8 Southern
Division all-league squad.
Pac-8 competition in tennis, track, and golf
brought disappointing results in the next few
weeks. UCLA stunned Stanford and USC to win
the tennis crown at USC's new David Marks
tennis center; the track team finished last at
Eugene, Ore.; and the golfers made a final round
charge (sparked by a 64 by Dave Baskins and a
65 by Conrad Nilmeier) but still finished second
to USC at Clarkston Golf Course in Clarkston,
Wash.
But the 1972-73 Stanford sports season is far
from complete. NCAA competition remains in
tennis, track, and golf, and two Stanford athletes
(Rich Kelley and Brian Job) and Stanford swim
coach Jim Gaughran will be touring China this
summer on goodwill tours sponsored by the
State Department.
Of course the biggest remaining event is the
NCAA tennis championships at Princeton, New
Jersey, a tournament that Dick Gould and his
Cardinal team hopes will become the undisputed
highlight of Stanford's 1972-73 sports season.

USC 30, Stanford 21
84,000 fans assembled in Stanford Stadium
on Saturday to watch a 30-21 USC victory which
provoked even more controversy than the
pre-game discussions.
"They're the worst winners I've ever come up
against," cried McKay after his Trojans had tried
a pass play with two seconds left and a
nine-point lead. "I'd like to beat them by 2000
points."
But McKay wasn't through. "Why is it when
we play these hotshots there are no penalties
called both ways. They've shown no class against
us."
Christiansen declined to comment on McKay's
verbal tirade. "I learned a long time ago that it's
no use getting in a contest with a skunk," Chris
said.
The game itself was sloppy but exciting.
Stanford scored first when James Ferguson
recovered a Trojan fumble in the end zone. After
two Rod Garcia field goals and two USC
touchdowns the score was tied 13-13 with 1:24
left in the first half.
But when the Cards got set to punt, center
Bill Reid's snap sailed over Dave Ottmar's head
and USC defensive end James Sims recovered on
Stanford's five yard line. Two plays later
Anthony Davis scored to give the Trojans a 20-13
halftime advantage.
Toughest For Trojans
USC controlled the second half and eventually
recorded its nine point victory. It was easily the
toughest game of the year for the undefeated
national champions, but it was a victory which all
but eliminated the Cards from Rose Bowl
contention.
Christiansen, however, refused to give up. "I
don't think we're out of it [Rose Bowl race) by
any means," he said. "We still have a great
chance."

The Cards' dim Rose Bowl hopes stayed alive
the following week when Stanford scored an
impressive 24-0 victory over an undefeated
Washington team, but a week later Dan Fouts
and the Oregon Ducks ended any thoughts of
New Year's Day in Pasadena with a 15-13 upset
in Eugene.
Stanford then defeated Oregon State (as Rod
Garcia became the most prolific field goal kicker
in Stanford history with his 22nd career field
goal), lost to UCLA 28-23 at the Los Angeles
Coliseum, and lost to Washington State 27-13 in
Pullman as Mike Boryla spent most of the
afternoon on his back.
Stanford's grid record stood at a dismal 5-4
as the Cards prepared for the Big Game in
Berkeley. The game had no real significance as
far as the Pac-8 race was concerned. The
traditional Big Game bonfire was cancelled and
the Band's activities in San Francisco were
curtailed by a police ordinance, but emotions
were still high on both sides for the 75th renewal
of the Big Game rivalry.
"The significance of the game goes without
saying," said Cal coach Mike White, who was
struggling though his first year as the Bears' head
coach after assisting John Ralston at Stanford.
"I have a lot of friends at Stanford, most of
them players, and I respect them. I know they'd
like to beat the hell out of me because that's the
way it is in athletics."
Mud Bowl
The "Big Game Mud Bowl" was played on a
field Christiansen called "the worst I've ever
seen," but 68,000 fans were treated to one of the
most thrilling football games in recent memory.
With four seconds left on the clock, Cal had the
ball on the Stanford seven yard line. It was
fourth down, Cal trailed 21-18, and everyone at
California Memorial Stadium expected a field
goal attempt.
But freshman quarterback Vince Ferragamo
broke out of the huddle and strode confidently
to the line of scrimmage for one final play. He
dropped back, rolled to his right, and with no
time on the clock threw a perfect strike to Steve
Sweeney in the left corner of the end zone.
"I never thought of going for a tie," said an
elated White. "This game means too much."
The Cards were idle the following week, but

during that period Rod Garcia, Jim Merlo, and
Randy Poltl were named to the first team
All-Pacific Eight squad and Merlo, Poltl and
Younger Klippert were selected to the AP's
All-Coast first team.
Eric Cross was only an honorable mention
all-league selection, but on Dec. 2 in Honolulu the
5-10 senior made the selection committee think
twice about its first team receivers. Cross caught
14 passes and took over the Pac-8 lead with 53 as
the Cards ripped the Hawaii Rainbows 39-7. He
also tied the Stanford record with his ninth
touchdown reception of the season and broke
the Pac-8 record for single game catches.
Stanford's final point of the season was scored
by Steve Murray, who kicked the extra point
after Stanford's last score. Murray, who normally
held for Rod Garcia, booted the ball squarely
through the uprights as the two reversed roles for
the final play.
The team's final record was a disappointing
6-5 (2-5 in the league), but while the varsity was
struggling against Pac-8 opponents, the Card
junior varsity recorded Stanford's first
undefeated JV season since 1965. First year
coahc Hudson Houck directed his team to a 4-0
record, including two shutous.
The Cards outscored their opponents 143-22
and while the offense rolled up over 900 yards
on the ground, the defense held four opponents
to a meager 51 net yards rushing.
The cross country ttam also completed a
successful season, winning the Pac-8 Southern
Division title before finishing fourth in the Pac-8
meet. Brian Mittelstaedt and Tony Sandoval
placed 1-2 in the Southern Division event at the
Stanford golf course.
Women Win
The women's swimming team added another
highlight to Stanford's fall quarter collection,
winning the 12-team Northern California
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference meet in
Sacramento.
After the final Pac-8 football statistics (which
showed Mike Boryla leading the league in total
offense and passing and Eric Cross on top of the
receiving charts) were released, Stanford fans
turned their attention to a basketball team which
promised to be the youngest, tallest, and possibly
best Stanford team in nearly a decade.
The Cards opened their season against a USF
team which boasted top 20 preseason national
rankings and a front line averaging 6-9. Stanford
coach Howie Dallmar countered with a youthful
lineup featuring three sophomores and two
juniors. Dallmar admitted that "USF will be a
tough assignment for a young team to face in its
first game."
A nervous Stanford team took the floor on
Dec. 1 at USF's Memorial Gymnasium. The Dons
jumped out to an early lead and despite
creditable performances by Mike Mann (16
points, 12 rebounds) and Rich Kelley (12 points,
14 rebounds, eight blocked shots), countless
turnovers doomed the Cards and USF eventually
recorded an 83-68 victory.
Three days later, however, Stanford scored its
first victory of the season, defeating Arizona
75-68 before a small but appreciative Maples
Pavilion crowd. After a two week break for
finals, the Cards played seven games during
Christmas vacation, including a 77-72 loss to
eventual NIT champ Virginia Tech in the finals
of the Old Dominion Classic at Norfolk, Va.
Winning Record
When Dallmar and his squad returned home
just before New Year's Day, the Pacific Eight
Council had already granted Mike Boryla an
extra year of football eligibility and Stanford's
basketball record stood at 5-4, marking the first
time in six years that the Cards would enter
Pac-8 play with a winning record.
But when the league season began on Jan. 6 in
Pullman, Wash., the Cards continued to play an
unpredictable brand of basketball. Stanford shot
26.4 percent from the floor in a 61-49 loss to
lowly Washington State in the conference
opener, and then completely reversed gears two
nights later in Seattle, romping past Washington's
highly-rated Huskies, 76-55. TTie Cards jumped
out to a 24-2 lead in that game, and Kelley
finished the contest with 24 points and 17
rebounds.
The following week Stanford lost by a
respectable 15 points to UCLA on Friday but
played its worst basketball of the year in an
83-67 Saturday night loss against USC. Stanford
then won two in a row, including an 80-68 win at
UC Santa Barbara where freshman Tim
Patterson was 10-10 from the floor and scored
22 points.
Merlo Drafted
Meanwhile Jim Merlo was selected in the
fourth round of the NFL draft by New Orleans
and Mike Askea and Roger Cowan were also
picked. That weekend, Stanford upset UCLA in
swimming 60-53; the basketball team won its

third in a row against California; and Coach Dick
Gould's tennis squad opened its quest for the
NCAA title by winning the first annual National
Indoor tournament in Madison, Wise.
The Cards defeated North Carolina and Trinity
in the opening rounds of the team dual match
event to reach the semifinals, where Stanford
stopped USC, 6-3. In the finals the next day,
UCLA fell to the Cards by an identical 6-3 score
and the netmen were on their way to an eventful
1973 campaign.
A week later the basketball team's three game
win streak was snapped when the Cards suffered
from a turnover epidemic in the Pacific
Northwest. Oregon and Oregon State took
advantage of 53 Cardinal miscues over the
weekend as both the Ducks and the Beavers
recorded six-point victories.
Things improved slightly when the teams met
again the next week at Maples Pavilion, but the
Cards squandered a 10-point second half lead
against Oregon to spoil a weekend which began
impressively the night before with an 81-70
victory over the 18th ranked Beavers.
World Record
That same weekend four Cardinal runners
blazed around the track at Idaho State's
minidome in 1:27.4, setting a new world indoor
record for the 880 yard relay. Ken Curl, John
Kessel, Matt Hogsett, and John Anderson
comprised the record-setting team.
In the next week the cagers swept two games
from Washington and Washington State; the
tennis team cruised to an easy victory in the
Northern California Intercollegiates; and Chris
Horpel finished second in the Pac-8 wrestling
meet.
And while the basketball team was completing
its memorable weekend in Los Angeles a week
later, Payton Jordan's track squad opened its
outdoor season, splashing to a 128-31 victory
over Fresno State in rain-soaked Stanford
Stadium. In Santa Monica, Stanford finished a
disappointing fourth in the Pac-8 swimming
meet, but Cardinal swimmers turned in some
outstanding individual performances.
John Hencken set a conference record of 57.7
in the 100 yard breaststroke, touching out
teammate Brian Job, who set the old mark in last
year's meet. In the 200, however, Job edged
Olympic gold medal winner Hencken in 2:05.4.
As championship competition continued for
winter sports teams, the list of highlights
mounted. Steve Hug won the all-around title at
the Pac-8 gymnastics meet as a depleted Cardinal
squad finished third behind California and
Washington. Howard Bessen won the rings, Ted
Marcy took the side horse, and Shawn Skerrett
placed second in the vault to join Hug on the list
of NCAA qualifiers.
Hug Ties NCAA's
Hug later tied for the all-around title at the
NCAA meet in Eugene, Ore., the second straight
year the two-time Olympian had gained at least a
share of the all-around title. The swimmers were
also successful in NCAA competition, placing
sixth in the Knoxville, Tenn. meet as Hencken
won the 100 breast, Job finished second in the
200, and Dean Anderson swam to an impressive
third place finish in the 100 free. At the NCAA
wrestling meet, an injured Horpel still managed a
fifth place finish in the 142 pound weight
division.
Back at Stanford, 6652 fans watched the
Cards conclude their most successful basketball
season since 1966 with a 70-66 victory over Cal
at Maples. Seniors Bob Buell and Pat Rusco got
the Cards going, but it was Kelley who came
through in the clutch, scoring Stanford's final 14
points in a performance that clearly established
him as one of the finest players in the nation.
Stanford finished the season with a 14-11
record (7-7 in the league) and Kelley earned first
team All-Pac-8 recognition along with Bill Walton
and Keith Wilkes of UCLA, Washington's Louie
Nelson, and Oregon freshman Ron Lee.
Statistically, the talented seven footer averaged
17.3 points, 13.7 rebounds, shot 51.8 percent
from the floor, and 70.5 from the foul line.
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar was certainly
pleased with Kelley's season, and also expressed
satisfaction over the team's winning record. "We
were young and made mistakes, but it was an
exciting team to watch," Dallmar said, adding
that "we anticipate being much stronger next
year."
Spring Sports
After the last basketball game, spring sports
teams began to occupy the spotlight. Bud
Finger's golfers won their first major tournament
of the season at the Pacific Coast Invitational in
Santa Barbara, triumphing over a strong field
which included national powers USC, Long
Beach State, and Arizona State. A few days later,
however, athletic director Joseph Ruetz offered
to forfeit the championship when it was learned
that Bruce Robertson had lost his amateur status
because of a rules violation involving the sale of
golf equipment.
The USGA ruled that Robertson was no
longer an amateur, and the Stanford sophomore
was forced to withdraw from the Masters
tournament. Robertson had earned a berth in the
prestigious event by finishing sixth in the U.S.
Amateur in September and was about to leave
for Augusta, Ga. when he learned of the USGA
decision.
Stanford played without Robertson at the
University of Pacific Invitational, and the golfers
were one of four spring teams that floundered
over the weekend. The baseball team, which had
compiled a 17-8 record in non-league
competition and boasted a 12th place national
ranking, lost two out of three games to UCLA in
its conference opener; the tennis team was
shocked twice in Los Angeles, losing 6-3 to USC
and 5-4 to UCLA; the track team lost 101-50 to
defending NCAA champion UCLA; and the
golfers finished third at UOP even though George
Pettinger (Robertson's replacement) fired rounds
of 74-71 for a third place individual finish.
Things looked up at the Farm in the next few
weeks, though. Ray Young's baseball team
played well at Sunken Diamond in a three game
series against the defending national champion
USC Trojans. USC won 2-1 and 3-0, but Bob
DiPietro sandwiched a brilliant three-hit shutout
in between the two losses, blanking the Trojans,
1-0 in the first game of Saturday's doubleheader
while striking out 13.
Tennis Revenge
The next week 2500 fans jammed the varsity
tennis courts to watch the Cards avenge their
earlier losses to USC and UCLA. This time
Stanford prevailed 7-2 over the Bruins and 5-4
over the Trojans as the Cards won 10 of 12
singles matches.

On April 28, as the netmen began their
defense of the Ojai Intercollegiate tennis title,
204 players representing 34 teams swarmed over
the Stanford golf course for the sixth annual U.S.
Collegiate Invitational. The field was obviously
"quantity not quality" as only San Jose State
could mount any serious threat to the Cards.
Stanford eventually won the 54-hole event by
two strokes over the Spartans and Cardinal
sophomore Conrad Nilmeier defeated San Jose's
Phil Barry in a sudden death playoff to win the
individual title.
About the same time Nilmeier won the
sudden death playoff, freshman John Whitlinger
and Pat DuPre clinched the Ojai tennis title with
a 7-6, 3-6, 7-6 semifinal doubles victory over the
USC team of Sashi Menon-John Andrews. The
Cards finished with 16 points compared to 14 for
second place USC. UCLA was third as the "Big
Three" continued its five round struggle for
national tennis supremacy.
The following week the netmen beat Cal 8-1
to conclude a 15-2 dual match season; the
women's tennis team triumphed in the Northern
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference
tournament (Andrea Barnes won the singles title
and Whitney Grant-Terry Albert won the doubles
crown); and A 1 Arthur shutout USC 3-0 as the
Cards dropped two of three to the Trojans at
Bovard Field in Los Angeles.
Individuals Shine
Except for the baseball teams's doubleheader
sweep against UCLA (with Arthur and Dave
Frost hurling the victories), individual
accomplishments dominated the next few weeks
of sports highlights. Sandy Mayer won his second
straight Cal State tennis title, defeating South
African pro Ray Moore in the finals. Brian Job
received the A 1 Masters Award presented to the
Stanford athlete "attaining the highest degree of
leadership, athletic achievement, and
scholarship." The Biff Hoffman award for the
outstanding Stanford athlete went to gymnast
Steve Hug.
Individual achievements were also noteworthy
in the 89th Big Meet. Cal defeated the Cards
84-70 at Stanford Stadium, but freshman Terry
Albritton became the third 18 year-old in history
to put the shot 61-6V2 as he set a new meet and

school record in that event. Brian Mittlestaedt
doubled in the mile and two mile; Dave Bagshaw
won the 120 high hurdle; Ken Curl won the 100;
Jim Howard took the discus; John Anderson
won the 440; and Tom Anderson won the long
jump in other Stanford individual wins.
Tlie underdog Whites beat the Reds 14-8 as
the football squad concluded four weeks of spring
drills on May 14 with the annual Red-White
game. The play was generally sloppy, but coach
Jack Christiansen was pleased with his team's
spring progress and expressed "cautious
optimism" in anticipation of next fall's opener
against Penn State on Sept. 15.
Sweep Over Cal
A lot of fans walked over to Sunken Diamond
after the Red-White game and watched the
baseball Cards sweep a doubleheader from Cal to
end its season in second place in the Pac-8
Southern Division with a 9-9 league record. The
team finished with a 34-20 overall mark as
sophomore Bob Hampton led the hitters with a
.393 average, and Bob DiPietro (5-2, 1.30), A 1
Arthur 7-2, 1.55), and Dave Frost (6-0, 2.11)
paced the mound corps.
Hampton, DiPietro, and freshman catcher
Dave Baker were named to the Pac-8 Southern
Division all-league squad.
Pac-8 competition in tennis, track, and golf
brought disappointing results in the next few
weeks. UCLA stunned Stanford and USC to win
the tennis crown at USC's new David Marks
tennis center; the track team finished last at
Eugene, Ore.; and the golfers made a final round
charge (sparked by a 64 by Dave Baskins and a
65 by Conrad Nilmeier) but still finished second
to USC at Clarkston Golf Course in Clarkston,
Wash.
But the 1972-73 Stanford sports season is far
from complete. NCAA competition remains in
tennis, track, and golf, and two Stanford athletes
(Rich Kelley and Brian Job) and Stanford swim
coach Jim Gaughran will be touring China this
summer on goodwill tours sponsored by the
State Department.
Of course the biggest remaining event is the
NCAA tennis championships at Princeton, New
Jersey, a tournament that Dick Gould and his
Cardinal team hopes will become the undisputed
highlight of Stanford's 1972-73 sports season.

BATTLE OF THE GIANTS-UCLA's seemingly
superhuman Bill Walton appears to have
established clear superiority over Stanford
9ophomore Rich Kelley in this picture, but
Kelley proved throughout the 1972-73 basketball
season that he was among the best mortal big
men in the nation. Kelley played Walton to a
virtual statistical standoff when the Cards nearly
upset the Bruins at Pauley Pavilion. In that
contest Kelley scored 15 points and grabbed 15
rebounds while Walton turned in a 23 point, 10
rebound performance.

McCLOUD FOR THE DEFENSE Senior defensive halfback Charles McCloud dives for a possible
interception during Stanford's 10-6 victory over Duke last fall. McCloud and his fellow defensive
backs led the Pacific Eight in pass defense, but coach Jack Christiansen's Cardinals still struggled
through a disappointing 6-5 season.

NCAA CHAMPION—Two-time Olympian Steve
Hug tied for the NCAA Ail-Around title at
Eugene, Ore. in April after winning a full share of
the crown last year. Hug will be back for his
senior season next year and will be competing for
an unprecedented third NCAA All-Around title.
It is ironic that after nine months of
competition in more than 15 sports, the most
memorable moment in 1972-73 Stanford
athletics was a loss. But that defeat, a thrilling
51-45 setback against national champion UCLA
at Pauley Pavilion, culminated the successful
reversal of Cardinal basketball fortunes and
certainly marked the highlight of Stanford's
sports year.
Coach Howie Dallmar's cagers, who had
assured Stanford's first winning season since
1966 the night before with a 50-47 victory over
USC, came into the UCLA game with dreams of
an upset but without any realistic hopes of
snapping the Bruins' awesome three-year winning
streak at 69. After the first half, however, 12,489
fans sat in stunned silence as the teams departed
for the dressing rooms with Stanford ahead,
25-18.
But when the second half began, the UCLA
crowd, apparently inspired by a halftime
presentation to coach John Wooden
commemorating his silver anniversary at UCLA,
suddenly came alive. Amid deafening roars from
the Bruin rooting section, UCLA scored two
baskets in the first 30 seconds to cut the Cardinal
lead to three.
About four minutes later, referee Charles
Reed allowed an obvious dunk by UCLA's Larry
Farmer (a call which is still causing recurring
nightmares for assistant coach Bub Bowling), and
l hen with 14:57 remaining, Keith Wilkes canned
two free throws to put the Bruins ahead for the
first time since the early moments of the game.
UCLA gradually pulled away and despite some
periodic Stanford surges, eventually recorded a
51-45 victory, the Bruins' 70th straight in a
seemingly endless streak.
UCLA went on to win a unprecedented sixth
straight national title, cruising through the
NCAA tournament without any serious scares.
The Bruins' final record was 30-0, and none of
those victories was as hard-earned as the March 3
win over Stanford.
Satisfying Victories
Of course 1972-73 Stanford athletic success
was not always measured by near misses.
Stanford teams recorded countless satisfying
victories during the past year, beginning on Sept.
16, when the Cardinals celebrated Jack
Christiansen's debut as head football coach with
a 44-0 victory over San Jose State at Stanford
Stadium.
The following week things weren't quite as
easy for the Cards in Durham, North Carolina. It
took two stingy goal line stands in the final
minutes (one from the four yard line and one
from the eight) to preserve a 10-6 victory over
the Duke Blue Devils in a regionally televised
contest.
The Cards ran their unbeaten streak to three
the next Saturday with a 41-35 victory over
previously undefeated West Virginia setting up an
October 7 showdown between the 15th ranked
Cards and the number one ranked USC Trojans,
a game that elicited varied commentary from
coaches and sportswriters throughout the
preceding week.
McKay Cautious
John McKay, whose undefeated Trojans were
rated 19 point favorites, continually tried to
minimize USC's advantage. "They'll (Stanford)
be a big test for us because they're the first team
we've met this year with an acceptable running
attack to go with an acceptable passing offense."
Meanwhile Jack Christiansen was ebullient in
his praise for the Trojans. "USC has a great
team," he said of a Trojan squad that had
outscored four previous opponents 189-42. "It's
very tough to see any weaknesses."
Not everyone was talking about strengths,
weaknesses, and statistics, though. San Francisco
Chronicle columnist Glenn Dickey admitted that
USC probably had the stronger football team,
but attacked the Trojan athletic department,
which he charged "has never been able to keep
football in perspective."
"I enjoy Stanford football because the
Cardinals (nee Indians) have done admirably with
the program, making it successful and yet
keeping it in perspective," Dickey wrote."That is
not easy, as even a cursory look around the
country will show.
"This Saturday at Palo Alto the Cards host
USC, a team which has never been able to keep
football in perspective; at USC, the tail has
wagged the dog so long, it thinks it is the dog.
Though Stanford has some good players, the
Trojans appear to be too strong for the Cards —
or anybody else.
"Yet, it has appeared that way for the last
two years, and Stanford has won so I'll be there
Saturday, rooting for the forces of good to
prevail."
USC 30, Stanford 21
84,000 fans assembled in Stanford Stadium
on Saturday to watch a 30-21 USC victory which
provoked even more controversy than the
pre-game discussions.
"They're the worst winners I've ever come up
against," cried McKay after his Trojans had tried
a pass play with two seconds left and a
nine-point lead. "I'd like to beat them by 2000
points."
But McKay wasn't through. "Why is it when
we play these hotshots there are no penalties
called both ways. They've shown no class against
us."
Christiansen declined to comment on McKay's
verbal tirade. "I learned a long time ago that it's
no use getting in a contest with a skunk," Chris
said.
The game itself was sloppy but exciting.
Stanford scored first when James Ferguson
recovered a Trojan fumble in the end zone. After
two Rod Garcia field goals and two USC
touchdowns the score was tied 13-13 with 1:24
left in the first half.
But when the Cards got set to punt, center
Bill Reid's snap sailed over Dave Ottmar's head
and USC defensive end James Sims recovered on
Stanford's five yard line. Two plays later
Anthony Davis scored to give the Trojans a 20-13
halftime advantage.
Toughest For Trojans
USC controlled the second half and eventually
recorded its nine point victory. It was easily the
toughest game of the year for the undefeated
national champions, but it was a victory which all
but eliminated the Cards from Rose Bowl
contention.
Christiansen, however, refused to give up. "I
don't think we're out of it [Rose Bowl race) by
any means," he said. "We still have a great
chance."

The Cards' dim Rose Bowl hopes stayed alive
the following week when Stanford scored an
impressive 24-0 victory over an undefeated
Washington team, but a week later Dan Fouts
and the Oregon Ducks ended any thoughts of
New Year's Day in Pasadena with a 15-13 upset
in Eugene.
Stanford then defeated Oregon State (as Rod
Garcia became the most prolific field goal kicker
in Stanford history with his 22nd career field
goal), lost to UCLA 28-23 at the Los Angeles
Coliseum, and lost to Washington State 27-13 in
Pullman as Mike Boryla spent most of the
afternoon on his back.
Stanford's grid record stood at a dismal 5-4
as the Cards prepared for the Big Game in
Berkeley. The game had no real significance as
far as the Pac-8 race was concerned. The
traditional Big Game bonfire was cancelled and
the Band's activities in San Francisco were
curtailed by a police ordinance, but emotions
were still high on both sides for the 75th renewal
of the Big Game rivalry.
"The significance of the game goes without
saying," said Cal coach Mike White, who was
struggling though his first year as the Bears' head
coach after assisting John Ralston at Stanford.
"I have a lot of friends at Stanford, most of
them players, and I respect them. I know they'd
like to beat the hell out of me because that's the
way it is in athletics."
Mud Bowl
The "Big Game Mud Bowl" was played on a
field Christiansen called "the worst I've ever
seen," but 68,000 fans were treated to one of the
most thrilling football games in recent memory.
With four seconds left on the clock, Cal had the
ball on the Stanford seven yard line. It was
fourth down, Cal trailed 21-18, and everyone at
California Memorial Stadium expected a field
goal attempt.
But freshman quarterback Vince Ferragamo
broke out of the huddle and strode confidently
to the line of scrimmage for one final play. He
dropped back, rolled to his right, and with no
time on the clock threw a perfect strike to Steve
Sweeney in the left corner of the end zone.
"I never thought of going for a tie," said an
elated White. "This game means too much."
The Cards were idle the following week, but

during that period Rod Garcia, Jim Merlo, and
Randy Poltl were named to the first team
All-Pacific Eight squad and Merlo, Poltl and
Younger Klippert were selected to the AP's
All-Coast first team.
Eric Cross was only an honorable mention
all-league selection, but on Dec. 2 in Honolulu the
5-10 senior made the selection committee think
twice about its first team receivers. Cross caught
14 passes and took over the Pac-8 lead with 53 as
the Cards ripped the Hawaii Rainbows 39-7. He
also tied the Stanford record with his ninth
touchdown reception of the season and broke
the Pac-8 record for single game catches.
Stanford's final point of the season was scored
by Steve Murray, who kicked the extra point
after Stanford's last score. Murray, who normally
held for Rod Garcia, booted the ball squarely
through the uprights as the two reversed roles for
the final play.
The team's final record was a disappointing
6-5 (2-5 in the league), but while the varsity was
struggling against Pac-8 opponents, the Card
junior varsity recorded Stanford's first
undefeated JV season since 1965. First year
coahc Hudson Houck directed his team to a 4-0
record, including two shutous.
The Cards outscored their opponents 143-22
and while the offense rolled up over 900 yards
on the ground, the defense held four opponents
to a meager 51 net yards rushing.
The cross country ttam also completed a
successful season, winning the Pac-8 Southern
Division title before finishing fourth in the Pac-8
meet. Brian Mittelstaedt and Tony Sandoval
placed 1-2 in the Southern Division event at the
Stanford golf course.
Women Win
The women's swimming team added another
highlight to Stanford's fall quarter collection,
winning the 12-team Northern California
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference meet in
Sacramento.
After the final Pac-8 football statistics (which
showed Mike Boryla leading the league in total
offense and passing and Eric Cross on top of the
receiving charts) were released, Stanford fans
turned their attention to a basketball team which
promised to be the youngest, tallest, and possibly
best Stanford team in nearly a decade.
The Cards opened their season against a USF
team which boasted top 20 preseason national
rankings and a front line averaging 6-9. Stanford
coach Howie Dallmar countered with a youthful
lineup featuring three sophomores and two
juniors. Dallmar admitted that "USF will be a
tough assignment for a young team to face in its
first game."
A nervous Stanford team took the floor on
Dec. 1 at USF's Memorial Gymnasium. The Dons
jumped out to an early lead and despite
creditable performances by Mike Mann (16
points, 12 rebounds) and Rich Kelley (12 points,
14 rebounds, eight blocked shots), countless
turnovers doomed the Cards and USF eventually
recorded an 83-68 victory.
Three days later, however, Stanford scored its
first victory of the season, defeating Arizona
75-68 before a small but appreciative Maples
Pavilion crowd. After a two week break for
finals, the Cards played seven games during
Christmas vacation, including a 77-72 loss to
eventual NIT champ Virginia Tech in the finals
of the Old Dominion Classic at Norfolk, Va.
Winning Record
When Dallmar and his squad returned home
just before New Year's Day, the Pacific Eight
Council had already granted Mike Boryla an
extra year of football eligibility and Stanford's
basketball record stood at 5-4, marking the first
time in six years that the Cards would enter
Pac-8 play with a winning record.
But when the league season began on Jan. 6 in
Pullman, Wash., the Cards continued to play an
unpredictable brand of basketball. Stanford shot
26.4 percent from the floor in a 61-49 loss to
lowly Washington State in the conference
opener, and then completely reversed gears two
nights later in Seattle, romping past Washington's
highly-rated Huskies, 76-55. TTie Cards jumped
out to a 24-2 lead in that game, and Kelley
finished the contest with 24 points and 17
rebounds.
The following week Stanford lost by a
respectable 15 points to UCLA on Friday but
played its worst basketball of the year in an
83-67 Saturday night loss against USC. Stanford
then won two in a row, including an 80-68 win at
UC Santa Barbara where freshman Tim
Patterson was 10-10 from the floor and scored
22 points.
Merlo Drafted
Meanwhile Jim Merlo was selected in the
fourth round of the NFL draft by New Orleans
and Mike Askea and Roger Cowan were also
picked. That weekend, Stanford upset UCLA in
swimming 60-53; the basketball team won its

third in a row against California; and Coach Dick
Gould's tennis squad opened its quest for the
NCAA title by winning the first annual National
Indoor tournament in Madison, Wise.
The Cards defeated North Carolina and Trinity
in the opening rounds of the team dual match
event to reach the semifinals, where Stanford
stopped USC, 6-3. In the finals the next day,
UCLA fell to the Cards by an identical 6-3 score
and the netmen were on their way to an eventful
1973 campaign.
A week later the basketball team's three game
win streak was snapped when the Cards suffered
from a turnover epidemic in the Pacific
Northwest. Oregon and Oregon State took
advantage of 53 Cardinal miscues over the
weekend as both the Ducks and the Beavers
recorded six-point victories.
Things improved slightly when the teams met
again the next week at Maples Pavilion, but the
Cards squandered a 10-point second half lead
against Oregon to spoil a weekend which began
impressively the night before with an 81-70
victory over the 18th ranked Beavers.
World Record
That same weekend four Cardinal runners
blazed around the track at Idaho State's
minidome in 1:27.4, setting a new world indoor
record for the 880 yard relay. Ken Curl, John
Kessel, Matt Hogsett, and John Anderson
comprised the record-setting team.
In the next week the cagers swept two games
from Washington and Washington State; the
tennis team cruised to an easy victory in the
Northern California Intercollegiates; and Chris
Horpel finished second in the Pac-8 wrestling
meet.
And while the basketball team was completing
its memorable weekend in Los Angeles a week
later, Payton Jordan's track squad opened its
outdoor season, splashing to a 128-31 victory
over Fresno State in rain-soaked Stanford
Stadium. In Santa Monica, Stanford finished a
disappointing fourth in the Pac-8 swimming
meet, but Cardinal swimmers turned in some
outstanding individual performances.
John Hencken set a conference record of 57.7
in the 100 yard breaststroke, touching out
teammate Brian Job, who set the old mark in last
year's meet. In the 200, however, Job edged
Olympic gold medal winner Hencken in 2:05.4.
As championship competition continued for
winter sports teams, the list of highlights
mounted. Steve Hug won the all-around title at
the Pac-8 gymnastics meet as a depleted Cardinal
squad finished third behind California and
Washington. Howard Bessen won the rings, Ted
Marcy took the side horse, and Shawn Skerrett
placed second in the vault to join Hug on the list
of NCAA qualifiers.
Hug Ties NCAA's
Hug later tied for the all-around title at the
NCAA meet in Eugene, Ore., the second straight
year the two-time Olympian had gained at least a
share of the all-around title. The swimmers were
also successful in NCAA competition, placing
sixth in the Knoxville, Tenn. meet as Hencken
won the 100 breast, Job finished second in the
200, and Dean Anderson swam to an impressive
third place finish in the 100 free. At the NCAA
wrestling meet, an injured Horpel still managed a
fifth place finish in the 142 pound weight
division.
Back at Stanford, 6652 fans watched the
Cards conclude their most successful basketball
season since 1966 with a 70-66 victory over Cal
at Maples. Seniors Bob Buell and Pat Rusco got
the Cards going, but it was Kelley who came
through in the clutch, scoring Stanford's final 14
points in a performance that clearly established
him as one of the finest players in the nation.
Stanford finished the season with a 14-11
record (7-7 in the league) and Kelley earned first
team All-Pac-8 recognition along with Bill Walton
and Keith Wilkes of UCLA, Washington's Louie
Nelson, and Oregon freshman Ron Lee.
Statistically, the talented seven footer averaged
17.3 points, 13.7 rebounds, shot 51.8 percent
from the floor, and 70.5 from the foul line.
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar was certainly
pleased with Kelley's season, and also expressed
satisfaction over the team's winning record. "We
were young and made mistakes, but it was an
exciting team to watch," Dallmar said, adding
that "we anticipate being much stronger next
year."
Spring Sports
After the last basketball game, spring sports
teams began to occupy the spotlight. Bud
Finger's golfers won their first major tournament
of the season at the Pacific Coast Invitational in
Santa Barbara, triumphing over a strong field
which included national powers USC, Long
Beach State, and Arizona State. A few days later,
however, athletic director Joseph Ruetz offered
to forfeit the championship when it was learned
that Bruce Robertson had lost his amateur status
because of a rules violation involving the sale of
golf equipment.
The USGA ruled that Robertson was no
longer an amateur, and the Stanford sophomore
was forced to withdraw from the Masters
tournament. Robertson had earned a berth in the
prestigious event by finishing sixth in the U.S.
Amateur in September and was about to leave
for Augusta, Ga. when he learned of the USGA
decision.
Stanford played without Robertson at the
University of Pacific Invitational, and the golfers
were one of four spring teams that floundered
over the weekend. The baseball team, which had
compiled a 17-8 record in non-league
competition and boasted a 12th place national
ranking, lost two out of three games to UCLA in
its conference opener; the tennis team was
shocked twice in Los Angeles, losing 6-3 to USC
and 5-4 to UCLA; the track team lost 101-50 to
defending NCAA champion UCLA; and the
golfers finished third at UOP even though George
Pettinger (Robertson's replacement) fired rounds
of 74-71 for a third place individual finish.
Things looked up at the Farm in the next few
weeks, though. Ray Young's baseball team
played well at Sunken Diamond in a three game
series against the defending national champion
USC Trojans. USC won 2-1 and 3-0, but Bob
DiPietro sandwiched a brilliant three-hit shutout
in between the two losses, blanking the Trojans,
1-0 in the first game of Saturday's doubleheader
while striking out 13.
Tennis Revenge
The next week 2500 fans jammed the varsity
tennis courts to watch the Cards avenge their
earlier losses to USC and UCLA. This time
Stanford prevailed 7-2 over the Bruins and 5-4
over the Trojans as the Cards won 10 of 12
singles matches.

On April 28, as the netmen began their
defense of the Ojai Intercollegiate tennis title,
204 players representing 34 teams swarmed over
the Stanford golf course for the sixth annual U.S.
Collegiate Invitational. The field was obviously
"quantity not quality" as only San Jose State
could mount any serious threat to the Cards.
Stanford eventually won the 54-hole event by
two strokes over the Spartans and Cardinal
sophomore Conrad Nilmeier defeated San Jose's
Phil Barry in a sudden death playoff to win the
individual title.
About the same time Nilmeier won the
sudden death playoff, freshman John Whitlinger
and Pat DuPre clinched the Ojai tennis title with
a 7-6, 3-6, 7-6 semifinal doubles victory over the
USC team of Sashi Menon-John Andrews. The
Cards finished with 16 points compared to 14 for
second place USC. UCLA was third as the "Big
Three" continued its five round struggle for
national tennis supremacy.
The following week the netmen beat Cal 8-1
to conclude a 15-2 dual match season; the
women's tennis team triumphed in the Northern
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference
tournament (Andrea Barnes won the singles title
and Whitney Grant-Terry Albert won the doubles
crown); and A 1 Arthur shutout USC 3-0 as the
Cards dropped two of three to the Trojans at
Bovard Field in Los Angeles.
Individuals Shine
Except for the baseball teams's doubleheader
sweep against UCLA (with Arthur and Dave
Frost hurling the victories), individual
accomplishments dominated the next few weeks
of sports highlights. Sandy Mayer won his second
straight Cal State tennis title, defeating South
African pro Ray Moore in the finals. Brian Job
received the A 1 Masters Award presented to the
Stanford athlete "attaining the highest degree of
leadership, athletic achievement, and
scholarship." The Biff Hoffman award for the
outstanding Stanford athlete went to gymnast
Steve Hug.
Individual achievements were also noteworthy
in the 89th Big Meet. Cal defeated the Cards
84-70 at Stanford Stadium, but freshman Terry
Albritton became the third 18 year-old in history
to put the shot 61-6V2 as he set a new meet and

school record in that event. Brian Mittlestaedt
doubled in the mile and two mile; Dave Bagshaw
won the 120 high hurdle; Ken Curl won the 100;
Jim Howard took the discus; John Anderson
won the 440; and Tom Anderson won the long
jump in other Stanford individual wins.
Tlie underdog Whites beat the Reds 14-8 as
the football squad concluded four weeks of spring
drills on May 14 with the annual Red-White
game. The play was generally sloppy, but coach
Jack Christiansen was pleased with his team's
spring progress and expressed "cautious
optimism" in anticipation of next fall's opener
against Penn State on Sept. 15.
Sweep Over Cal
A lot of fans walked over to Sunken Diamond
after the Red-White game and watched the
baseball Cards sweep a doubleheader from Cal to
end its season in second place in the Pac-8
Southern Division with a 9-9 league record. The
team finished with a 34-20 overall mark as
sophomore Bob Hampton led the hitters with a
.393 average, and Bob DiPietro (5-2, 1.30), A 1
Arthur 7-2, 1.55), and Dave Frost (6-0, 2.11)
paced the mound corps.
Hampton, DiPietro, and freshman catcher
Dave Baker were named to the Pac-8 Southern
Division all-league squad.
Pac-8 competition in tennis, track, and golf
brought disappointing results in the next few
weeks. UCLA stunned Stanford and USC to win
the tennis crown at USC's new David Marks
tennis center; the track team finished last at
Eugene, Ore.; and the golfers made a final round
charge (sparked by a 64 by Dave Baskins and a
65 by Conrad Nilmeier) but still finished second
to USC at Clarkston Golf Course in Clarkston,
Wash.
But the 1972-73 Stanford sports season is far
from complete. NCAA competition remains in
tennis, track, and golf, and two Stanford athletes
(Rich Kelley and Brian Job) and Stanford swim
coach Jim Gaughran will be touring China this
summer on goodwill tours sponsored by the
State Department.
Of course the biggest remaining event is the
NCAA tennis championships at Princeton, New
Jersey, a tournament that Dick Gould and his
Cardinal team hopes will become the undisputed
highlight of Stanford's 1972-73 sports season.

BATTLE OF THE GIANTS-UCLA's seemingly
superhuman Bill Walton appears to have
established clear superiority over Stanford
9ophomore Rich Kelley in this picture, but
Kelley proved throughout the 1972-73 basketball
season that he was among the best mortal big
men in the nation. Kelley played Walton to a
virtual statistical standoff when the Cards nearly
upset the Bruins at Pauley Pavilion. In that
contest Kelley scored 15 points and grabbed 15
rebounds while Walton turned in a 23 point, 10
rebound performance.

McCLOUD FOR THE DEFENSE Senior defensive halfback Charles McCloud dives for a possible
interception during Stanford's 10-6 victory over Duke last fall. McCloud and his fellow defensive
backs led the Pacific Eight in pass defense, but coach Jack Christiansen's Cardinals still struggled
through a disappointing 6-5 season.

NCAA CHAMPION—Two-time Olympian Steve
Hug tied for the NCAA Ail-Around title at
Eugene, Ore. in April after winning a full share of
the crown last year. Hug will be back for his
senior season next year and will be competing for
an unprecedented third NCAA All-Around title.
It is ironic that after nine months of
competition in more than 15 sports, the most
memorable moment in 1972-73 Stanford
athletics was a loss. But that defeat, a thrilling
51-45 setback against national champion UCLA
at Pauley Pavilion, culminated the successful
reversal of Cardinal basketball fortunes and
certainly marked the highlight of Stanford's
sports year.
Coach Howie Dallmar's cagers, who had
assured Stanford's first winning season since
1966 the night before with a 50-47 victory over
USC, came into the UCLA game with dreams of
an upset but without any realistic hopes of
snapping the Bruins' awesome three-year winning
streak at 69. After the first half, however, 12,489
fans sat in stunned silence as the teams departed
for the dressing rooms with Stanford ahead,
25-18.
But when the second half began, the UCLA
crowd, apparently inspired by a halftime
presentation to coach John Wooden
commemorating his silver anniversary at UCLA,
suddenly came alive. Amid deafening roars from
the Bruin rooting section, UCLA scored two
baskets in the first 30 seconds to cut the Cardinal
lead to three.
About four minutes later, referee Charles
Reed allowed an obvious dunk by UCLA's Larry
Farmer (a call which is still causing recurring
nightmares for assistant coach Bub Bowling), and
l hen with 14:57 remaining, Keith Wilkes canned
two free throws to put the Bruins ahead for the
first time since the early moments of the game.
UCLA gradually pulled away and despite some
periodic Stanford surges, eventually recorded a
51-45 victory, the Bruins' 70th straight in a
seemingly endless streak.
UCLA went on to win a unprecedented sixth
straight national title, cruising through the
NCAA tournament without any serious scares.
The Bruins' final record was 30-0, and none of
those victories was as hard-earned as the March 3
win over Stanford.
Satisfying Victories
Of course 1972-73 Stanford athletic success
was not always measured by near misses.
Stanford teams recorded countless satisfying
victories during the past year, beginning on Sept.
16, when the Cardinals celebrated Jack
Christiansen's debut as head football coach with
a 44-0 victory over San Jose State at Stanford
Stadium.
The following week things weren't quite as
easy for the Cards in Durham, North Carolina. It
took two stingy goal line stands in the final
minutes (one from the four yard line and one
from the eight) to preserve a 10-6 victory over
the Duke Blue Devils in a regionally televised
contest.
The Cards ran their unbeaten streak to three
the next Saturday with a 41-35 victory over
previously undefeated West Virginia setting up an
October 7 showdown between the 15th ranked
Cards and the number one ranked USC Trojans,
a game that elicited varied commentary from
coaches and sportswriters throughout the
preceding week.
McKay Cautious
John McKay, whose undefeated Trojans were
rated 19 point favorites, continually tried to
minimize USC's advantage. "They'll (Stanford)
be a big test for us because they're the first team
we've met this year with an acceptable running
attack to go with an acceptable passing offense."
Meanwhile Jack Christiansen was ebullient in
his praise for the Trojans. "USC has a great
team," he said of a Trojan squad that had
outscored four previous opponents 189-42. "It's
very tough to see any weaknesses."
Not everyone was talking about strengths,
weaknesses, and statistics, though. San Francisco
Chronicle columnist Glenn Dickey admitted that
USC probably had the stronger football team,
but attacked the Trojan athletic department,
which he charged "has never been able to keep
football in perspective."
"I enjoy Stanford football because the
Cardinals (nee Indians) have done admirably with
the program, making it successful and yet
keeping it in perspective," Dickey wrote."That is
not easy, as even a cursory look around the
country will show.
"This Saturday at Palo Alto the Cards host
USC, a team which has never been able to keep
football in perspective; at USC, the tail has
wagged the dog so long, it thinks it is the dog.
Though Stanford has some good players, the
Trojans appear to be too strong for the Cards —
or anybody else.
"Yet, it has appeared that way for the last
two years, and Stanford has won so I'll be there
Saturday, rooting for the forces of good to
prevail."
USC 30, Stanford 21
84,000 fans assembled in Stanford Stadium
on Saturday to watch a 30-21 USC victory which
provoked even more controversy than the
pre-game discussions.
"They're the worst winners I've ever come up
against," cried McKay after his Trojans had tried
a pass play with two seconds left and a
nine-point lead. "I'd like to beat them by 2000
points."
But McKay wasn't through. "Why is it when
we play these hotshots there are no penalties
called both ways. They've shown no class against
us."
Christiansen declined to comment on McKay's
verbal tirade. "I learned a long time ago that it's
no use getting in a contest with a skunk," Chris
said.
The game itself was sloppy but exciting.
Stanford scored first when James Ferguson
recovered a Trojan fumble in the end zone. After
two Rod Garcia field goals and two USC
touchdowns the score was tied 13-13 with 1:24
left in the first half.
But when the Cards got set to punt, center
Bill Reid's snap sailed over Dave Ottmar's head
and USC defensive end James Sims recovered on
Stanford's five yard line. Two plays later
Anthony Davis scored to give the Trojans a 20-13
halftime advantage.
Toughest For Trojans
USC controlled the second half and eventually
recorded its nine point victory. It was easily the
toughest game of the year for the undefeated
national champions, but it was a victory which all
but eliminated the Cards from Rose Bowl
contention.
Christiansen, however, refused to give up. "I
don't think we're out of it [Rose Bowl race) by
any means," he said. "We still have a great
chance."

The Cards' dim Rose Bowl hopes stayed alive
the following week when Stanford scored an
impressive 24-0 victory over an undefeated
Washington team, but a week later Dan Fouts
and the Oregon Ducks ended any thoughts of
New Year's Day in Pasadena with a 15-13 upset
in Eugene.
Stanford then defeated Oregon State (as Rod
Garcia became the most prolific field goal kicker
in Stanford history with his 22nd career field
goal), lost to UCLA 28-23 at the Los Angeles
Coliseum, and lost to Washington State 27-13 in
Pullman as Mike Boryla spent most of the
afternoon on his back.
Stanford's grid record stood at a dismal 5-4
as the Cards prepared for the Big Game in
Berkeley. The game had no real significance as
far as the Pac-8 race was concerned. The
traditional Big Game bonfire was cancelled and
the Band's activities in San Francisco were
curtailed by a police ordinance, but emotions
were still high on both sides for the 75th renewal
of the Big Game rivalry.
"The significance of the game goes without
saying," said Cal coach Mike White, who was
struggling though his first year as the Bears' head
coach after assisting John Ralston at Stanford.
"I have a lot of friends at Stanford, most of
them players, and I respect them. I know they'd
like to beat the hell out of me because that's the
way it is in athletics."
Mud Bowl
The "Big Game Mud Bowl" was played on a
field Christiansen called "the worst I've ever
seen," but 68,000 fans were treated to one of the
most thrilling football games in recent memory.
With four seconds left on the clock, Cal had the
ball on the Stanford seven yard line. It was
fourth down, Cal trailed 21-18, and everyone at
California Memorial Stadium expected a field
goal attempt.
But freshman quarterback Vince Ferragamo
broke out of the huddle and strode confidently
to the line of scrimmage for one final play. He
dropped back, rolled to his right, and with no
time on the clock threw a perfect strike to Steve
Sweeney in the left corner of the end zone.
"I never thought of going for a tie," said an
elated White. "This game means too much."
The Cards were idle the following week, but

during that period Rod Garcia, Jim Merlo, and
Randy Poltl were named to the first team
All-Pacific Eight squad and Merlo, Poltl and
Younger Klippert were selected to the AP's
All-Coast first team.
Eric Cross was only an honorable mention
all-league selection, but on Dec. 2 in Honolulu the
5-10 senior made the selection committee think
twice about its first team receivers. Cross caught
14 passes and took over the Pac-8 lead with 53 as
the Cards ripped the Hawaii Rainbows 39-7. He
also tied the Stanford record with his ninth
touchdown reception of the season and broke
the Pac-8 record for single game catches.
Stanford's final point of the season was scored
by Steve Murray, who kicked the extra point
after Stanford's last score. Murray, who normally
held for Rod Garcia, booted the ball squarely
through the uprights as the two reversed roles for
the final play.
The team's final record was a disappointing
6-5 (2-5 in the league), but while the varsity was
struggling against Pac-8 opponents, the Card
junior varsity recorded Stanford's first
undefeated JV season since 1965. First year
coahc Hudson Houck directed his team to a 4-0
record, including two shutous.
The Cards outscored their opponents 143-22
and while the offense rolled up over 900 yards
on the ground, the defense held four opponents
to a meager 51 net yards rushing.
The cross country ttam also completed a
successful season, winning the Pac-8 Southern
Division title before finishing fourth in the Pac-8
meet. Brian Mittelstaedt and Tony Sandoval
placed 1-2 in the Southern Division event at the
Stanford golf course.
Women Win
The women's swimming team added another
highlight to Stanford's fall quarter collection,
winning the 12-team Northern California
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference meet in
Sacramento.
After the final Pac-8 football statistics (which
showed Mike Boryla leading the league in total
offense and passing and Eric Cross on top of the
receiving charts) were released, Stanford fans
turned their attention to a basketball team which
promised to be the youngest, tallest, and possibly
best Stanford team in nearly a decade.
The Cards opened their season against a USF
team which boasted top 20 preseason national
rankings and a front line averaging 6-9. Stanford
coach Howie Dallmar countered with a youthful
lineup featuring three sophomores and two
juniors. Dallmar admitted that "USF will be a
tough assignment for a young team to face in its
first game."
A nervous Stanford team took the floor on
Dec. 1 at USF's Memorial Gymnasium. The Dons
jumped out to an early lead and despite
creditable performances by Mike Mann (16
points, 12 rebounds) and Rich Kelley (12 points,
14 rebounds, eight blocked shots), countless
turnovers doomed the Cards and USF eventually
recorded an 83-68 victory.
Three days later, however, Stanford scored its
first victory of the season, defeating Arizona
75-68 before a small but appreciative Maples
Pavilion crowd. After a two week break for
finals, the Cards played seven games during
Christmas vacation, including a 77-72 loss to
eventual NIT champ Virginia Tech in the finals
of the Old Dominion Classic at Norfolk, Va.
Winning Record
When Dallmar and his squad returned home
just before New Year's Day, the Pacific Eight
Council had already granted Mike Boryla an
extra year of football eligibility and Stanford's
basketball record stood at 5-4, marking the first
time in six years that the Cards would enter
Pac-8 play with a winning record.
But when the league season began on Jan. 6 in
Pullman, Wash., the Cards continued to play an
unpredictable brand of basketball. Stanford shot
26.4 percent from the floor in a 61-49 loss to
lowly Washington State in the conference
opener, and then completely reversed gears two
nights later in Seattle, romping past Washington's
highly-rated Huskies, 76-55. TTie Cards jumped
out to a 24-2 lead in that game, and Kelley
finished the contest with 24 points and 17
rebounds.
The following week Stanford lost by a
respectable 15 points to UCLA on Friday but
played its worst basketball of the year in an
83-67 Saturday night loss against USC. Stanford
then won two in a row, including an 80-68 win at
UC Santa Barbara where freshman Tim
Patterson was 10-10 from the floor and scored
22 points.
Merlo Drafted
Meanwhile Jim Merlo was selected in the
fourth round of the NFL draft by New Orleans
and Mike Askea and Roger Cowan were also
picked. That weekend, Stanford upset UCLA in
swimming 60-53; the basketball team won its

third in a row against California; and Coach Dick
Gould's tennis squad opened its quest for the
NCAA title by winning the first annual National
Indoor tournament in Madison, Wise.
The Cards defeated North Carolina and Trinity
in the opening rounds of the team dual match
event to reach the semifinals, where Stanford
stopped USC, 6-3. In the finals the next day,
UCLA fell to the Cards by an identical 6-3 score
and the netmen were on their way to an eventful
1973 campaign.
A week later the basketball team's three game
win streak was snapped when the Cards suffered
from a turnover epidemic in the Pacific
Northwest. Oregon and Oregon State took
advantage of 53 Cardinal miscues over the
weekend as both the Ducks and the Beavers
recorded six-point victories.
Things improved slightly when the teams met
again the next week at Maples Pavilion, but the
Cards squandered a 10-point second half lead
against Oregon to spoil a weekend which began
impressively the night before with an 81-70
victory over the 18th ranked Beavers.
World Record
That same weekend four Cardinal runners
blazed around the track at Idaho State's
minidome in 1:27.4, setting a new world indoor
record for the 880 yard relay. Ken Curl, John
Kessel, Matt Hogsett, and John Anderson
comprised the record-setting team.
In the next week the cagers swept two games
from Washington and Washington State; the
tennis team cruised to an easy victory in the
Northern California Intercollegiates; and Chris
Horpel finished second in the Pac-8 wrestling
meet.
And while the basketball team was completing
its memorable weekend in Los Angeles a week
later, Payton Jordan's track squad opened its
outdoor season, splashing to a 128-31 victory
over Fresno State in rain-soaked Stanford
Stadium. In Santa Monica, Stanford finished a
disappointing fourth in the Pac-8 swimming
meet, but Cardinal swimmers turned in some
outstanding individual performances.
John Hencken set a conference record of 57.7
in the 100 yard breaststroke, touching out
teammate Brian Job, who set the old mark in last
year's meet. In the 200, however, Job edged
Olympic gold medal winner Hencken in 2:05.4.
As championship competition continued for
winter sports teams, the list of highlights
mounted. Steve Hug won the all-around title at
the Pac-8 gymnastics meet as a depleted Cardinal
squad finished third behind California and
Washington. Howard Bessen won the rings, Ted
Marcy took the side horse, and Shawn Skerrett
placed second in the vault to join Hug on the list
of NCAA qualifiers.
Hug Ties NCAA's
Hug later tied for the all-around title at the
NCAA meet in Eugene, Ore., the second straight
year the two-time Olympian had gained at least a
share of the all-around title. The swimmers were
also successful in NCAA competition, placing
sixth in the Knoxville, Tenn. meet as Hencken
won the 100 breast, Job finished second in the
200, and Dean Anderson swam to an impressive
third place finish in the 100 free. At the NCAA
wrestling meet, an injured Horpel still managed a
fifth place finish in the 142 pound weight
division.
Back at Stanford, 6652 fans watched the
Cards conclude their most successful basketball
season since 1966 with a 70-66 victory over Cal
at Maples. Seniors Bob Buell and Pat Rusco got
the Cards going, but it was Kelley who came
through in the clutch, scoring Stanford's final 14
points in a performance that clearly established
him as one of the finest players in the nation.
Stanford finished the season with a 14-11
record (7-7 in the league) and Kelley earned first
team All-Pac-8 recognition along with Bill Walton
and Keith Wilkes of UCLA, Washington's Louie
Nelson, and Oregon freshman Ron Lee.
Statistically, the talented seven footer averaged
17.3 points, 13.7 rebounds, shot 51.8 percent
from the floor, and 70.5 from the foul line.
Stanford coach Howie Dallmar was certainly
pleased with Kelley's season, and also expressed
satisfaction over the team's winning record. "We
were young and made mistakes, but it was an
exciting team to watch," Dallmar said, adding
that "we anticipate being much stronger next
year."
Spring Sports
After the last basketball game, spring sports
teams began to occupy the spotlight. Bud
Finger's golfers won their first major tournament
of the season at the Pacific Coast Invitational in
Santa Barbara, triumphing over a strong field
which included national powers USC, Long
Beach State, and Arizona State. A few days later,
however, athletic director Joseph Ruetz offered
to forfeit the championship when it was learned
that Bruce Robertson had lost his amateur status
because of a rules violation involving the sale of
golf equipment.
The USGA ruled that Robertson was no
longer an amateur, and the Stanford sophomore
was forced to withdraw from the Masters
tournament. Robertson had earned a berth in the
prestigious event by finishing sixth in the U.S.
Amateur in September and was about to leave
for Augusta, Ga. when he learned of the USGA
decision.
Stanford played without Robertson at the
University of Pacific Invitational, and the golfers
were one of four spring teams that floundered
over the weekend. The baseball team, which had
compiled a 17-8 record in non-league
competition and boasted a 12th place national
ranking, lost two out of three games to UCLA in
its conference opener; the tennis team was
shocked twice in Los Angeles, losing 6-3 to USC
and 5-4 to UCLA; the track team lost 101-50 to
defending NCAA champion UCLA; and the
golfers finished third at UOP even though George
Pettinger (Robertson's replacement) fired rounds
of 74-71 for a third place individual finish.
Things looked up at the Farm in the next few
weeks, though. Ray Young's baseball team
played well at Sunken Diamond in a three game
series against the defending national champion
USC Trojans. USC won 2-1 and 3-0, but Bob
DiPietro sandwiched a brilliant three-hit shutout
in between the two losses, blanking the Trojans,
1-0 in the first game of Saturday's doubleheader
while striking out 13.
Tennis Revenge
The next week 2500 fans jammed the varsity
tennis courts to watch the Cards avenge their
earlier losses to USC and UCLA. This time
Stanford prevailed 7-2 over the Bruins and 5-4
over the Trojans as the Cards won 10 of 12
singles matches.

On April 28, as the netmen began their
defense of the Ojai Intercollegiate tennis title,
204 players representing 34 teams swarmed over
the Stanford golf course for the sixth annual U.S.
Collegiate Invitational. The field was obviously
"quantity not quality" as only San Jose State
could mount any serious threat to the Cards.
Stanford eventually won the 54-hole event by
two strokes over the Spartans and Cardinal
sophomore Conrad Nilmeier defeated San Jose's
Phil Barry in a sudden death playoff to win the
individual title.
About the same time Nilmeier won the
sudden death playoff, freshman John Whitlinger
and Pat DuPre clinched the Ojai tennis title with
a 7-6, 3-6, 7-6 semifinal doubles victory over the
USC team of Sashi Menon-John Andrews. The
Cards finished with 16 points compared to 14 for
second place USC. UCLA was third as the "Big
Three" continued its five round struggle for
national tennis supremacy.
The following week the netmen beat Cal 8-1
to conclude a 15-2 dual match season; the
women's tennis team triumphed in the Northern
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference
tournament (Andrea Barnes won the singles title
and Whitney Grant-Terry Albert won the doubles
crown); and A 1 Arthur shutout USC 3-0 as the
Cards dropped two of three to the Trojans at
Bovard Field in Los Angeles.
Individuals Shine
Except for the baseball teams's doubleheader
sweep against UCLA (with Arthur and Dave
Frost hurling the victories), individual
accomplishments dominated the next few weeks
of sports highlights. Sandy Mayer won his second
straight Cal State tennis title, defeating South
African pro Ray Moore in the finals. Brian Job
received the A 1 Masters Award presented to the
Stanford athlete "attaining the highest degree of
leadership, athletic achievement, and
scholarship." The Biff Hoffman award for the
outstanding Stanford athlete went to gymnast
Steve Hug.
Individual achievements were also noteworthy
in the 89th Big Meet. Cal defeated the Cards
84-70 at Stanford Stadium, but freshman Terry
Albritton became the third 18 year-old in history
to put the shot 61-6V2 as he set a new meet and

school record in that event. Brian Mittlestaedt
doubled in the mile and two mile; Dave Bagshaw
won the 120 high hurdle; Ken Curl won the 100;
Jim Howard took the discus; John Anderson
won the 440; and Tom Anderson won the long
jump in other Stanford individual wins.
Tlie underdog Whites beat the Reds 14-8 as
the football squad concluded four weeks of spring
drills on May 14 with the annual Red-White
game. The play was generally sloppy, but coach
Jack Christiansen was pleased with his team's
spring progress and expressed "cautious
optimism" in anticipation of next fall's opener
against Penn State on Sept. 15.
Sweep Over Cal
A lot of fans walked over to Sunken Diamond
after the Red-White game and watched the
baseball Cards sweep a doubleheader from Cal to
end its season in second place in the Pac-8
Southern Division with a 9-9 league record. The
team finished with a 34-20 overall mark as
sophomore Bob Hampton led the hitters with a
.393 average, and Bob DiPietro (5-2, 1.30), A 1
Arthur 7-2, 1.55), and Dave Frost (6-0, 2.11)
paced the mound corps.
Hampton, DiPietro, and freshman catcher
Dave Baker were named to the Pac-8 Southern
Division all-league squad.
Pac-8 competition in tennis, track, and golf
brought disappointing results in the next few
weeks. UCLA stunned Stanford and USC to win
the tennis crown at USC's new David Marks
tennis center; the track team finished last at
Eugene, Ore.; and the golfers made a final round
charge (sparked by a 64 by Dave Baskins and a
65 by Conrad Nilmeier) but still finished second
to USC at Clarkston Golf Course in Clarkston,
Wash.
But the 1972-73 Stanford sports season is far
from complete. NCAA competition remains in
tennis, track, and golf, and two Stanford athletes
(Rich Kelley and Brian Job) and Stanford swim
coach Jim Gaughran will be touring China this
summer on goodwill tours sponsored by the
State Department.
Of course the biggest remaining event is the
NCAA tennis championships at Princeton, New
Jersey, a tournament that Dick Gould and his
Cardinal team hopes will become the undisputed
highlight of Stanford's 1972-73 sports season.

BATTLE OF THE GIANTS-UCLA's seemingly
superhuman Bill Walton appears to have
established clear superiority over Stanford
9ophomore Rich Kelley in this picture, but
Kelley proved throughout the 1972-73 basketball
season that he was among the best mortal big
men in the nation. Kelley played Walton to a
virtual statistical standoff when the Cards nearly
upset the Bruins at Pauley Pavilion. In that
contest Kelley scored 15 points and grabbed 15
rebounds while Walton turned in a 23 point, 10
rebound performance.

McCLOUD FOR THE DEFENSE Senior defensive halfback Charles McCloud dives for a possible
interception during Stanford's 10-6 victory over Duke last fall. McCloud and his fellow defensive
backs led the Pacific Eight in pass defense, but coach Jack Christiansen's Cardinals still struggled
through a disappointing 6-5 season.

NCAA CHAMPION—Two-time Olympian Steve
Hug tied for the NCAA Ail-Around title at
Eugene, Ore. in April after winning a full share of
the crown last year. Hug will be back for his
senior season next year and will be competing for
an unprecedented third NCAA All-Around title.
