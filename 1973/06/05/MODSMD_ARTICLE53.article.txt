# Campuses Cooler, But Undercover Cops Remain
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
(Author's note: The following article was originally
prepared for a course in April. It has been slightly updated
to include information on last week's arrest of
ex-Stanford radical James E. Johnson.)
In the days before Mario Savio and People's Park and
Cambodia, about the only time police ever came onto a
college campus was when a fraternity's initiation stunt got
out of hand. The first time at many campuses when
outside police were called in to quell demonstrations,
there were outraged cries from faculty and students, and
apologetic statements from administrators. But today,
police presence — particularly undercover intelligence and
surveillance — has become so pervasive that it may pose a
real danger to the notion of "academic freedom" — and
perhaps to the rights of students and faculty as well.
Despite the current "cooling of the campuses," it
appears that many law enforcement agencies have either
maintained or intensified their information-gathering
operations. Not surprisingly, the campuses where they
remain the most active are those with possibly the last
vestiges of the radical student movement of the late
1960'5, such as Stanford and San Francisco State
University.
Shadowy
The most shadowy — and reputedly the most active —
law organizations operating on these campuses and at the
University of California in Berkeley are the FBI and the
state Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation
(CII). But these organizations as a matter of policy will
neither confirm nor deny any reports about their activities
on the campuses.
Former Stanford English Prof. H. Bruce Franklin, a
member of the Maoist Venceremos organization's central
committee, says that the two organizations usually do not
utilize undercover agents as such. Instead, he says, they
"depend on vast numbers of informers; the agents are
generally used to investigate the stuff the informers give
them." These informants are sometimes paid, he says;
others, "frequently including administrators and
professors," are not on such a formal basis.
Franklin refused to cite examples for his allegations
because, he said, "we want to keep certain information
about what we know to ourselves. We don't want them
flaw enforcement agencies] to know how much we
know." But he states flatly that "there are a number of
undercover operatives, informants and agents" on the
Stanford campus, and claimed that a still-unsolved April,
1970 arson fire at the Stanford Center for Advanced
Research in the Behavioral Sciences was set by an FBI
informant to "establish his credibility" with campus
radicals. He would not name the alleged informant.

Security Subcommittee, radical-turned-informer Thomas
Edward Mosher said it "was revealed" to him that
ex-campus radical James Edward Johnson set the blaze.

Johnson, sought by Santa Cruz County authorities on an
unrelated charge, disappeared shortly after Mosher's
testimony; he was arrested last week, and is being held in
San Juan, P.R., pending extradition. He has not been
charged with the Stanford fire.)
FBI Won't Answer
According to Thomas Druken, assistant to the special
agent in charge of the FBl's San Francisco fie'd office, the
bureau refuses to answer all questions aboui its campus
activities, and its refusal "is not to infei that such
operations are or are not being conducted." Virtually the
only official confirmation that the FBI has ever been
investigating Venceremos comes from a House Internal
Security Committee (HISC) report issued last summer
which includes lengthy testimony from a husband-wife
team of informants that infiltrated Venceremos and
another Bay Area radical group, the Revolutionary Union.
The report observes that the FBI "has, as usual, been
doing a highly commendable job in covering the activities
of revolutionary groups and forwarding its evidence to the
Department of Justice."
In at least one instance, though, the Stanford public
received an insight into how that "commendable job" is
executed. After turning down an informal invitation to
join the Revolutionary Union three years ago, a Stanford
Daily reporter named Phil Revzin volunteered his
"services" as an informant to the FBl's Palo Alto office.
Although not previously involved in radical activities,
Revzin found that the FBI had a file of extensive and
detailed information about him — his home address in
Chicago, his roommates' names, even clippings of his
newspaper articles. He was given a code name — "Ron
Goldstein" — and told to keep the bureau informed on
whatever he saw in the RU. Revzin continued the charade
for several days and then quit and recounted his
experiences in a Daily article.

Analysis And Commentary

CII Activities
Like the FBI, the CII is rumored to be extensively
engaged in intelligence-gathering on and around college
communities, and like the FBI, CII officials refuse to
either confirm or deny those rumors. A division of the
California Department of Justice under the control of
state Atty. Gen. Evelle J. Younger, the organization
reportedly uses its links with newspaper reporters to leak
information on radical activities. It was allegedly the
source of a controversial San Francisco Examiner article
in March, 1969, that reported that 1973 had been set as
the "target date" for a revolutionary takeover of the
United States.
Because local law enforcement agencies lack the
resources of the FBI and CII — and also possibly because
they are more open to public scrutiny — they are

generally less sophisticated in their intelligence operations.
Local agencies more frequently resort to actual
undercover agents rather than informants, and those
informants they do utilize are on a less-formal basis.
One of the most extensive local undercover operations
is the San Francisco Police Department's Intelligence
Unit. Lt. Paul Lawler of the Unit recently told the San
Francisco Examiner that "there are more than 50 San
Francisco police officers attending classes at San
Francisco State University," although he hastened to add
that "they're not all undercover officers." Other sources
place the number of actual intelligence officers at about
30, although David Campbell, special city editor of the
San Francisco State Phoenix student newspaper, says that
"no one really thinks that those other 20 aren't going to
report anything they find out."
Infiltration
The Phoenix itself recently got a look at the
Intelligence Unit's operations. In testimony at a trial in
nearby Marin County last February, a 25-year-old
Intelligence Unit officer named Alexander Jason revealed
that he infiltrated a campus Venceremos-sponsored study
group while posing as a student. Several days later, the
Phoenix revealed that at the same time Jason was
infiltrating the Venceremos group, he had been working as
a reporter for the Phoenix and for "Prism," a student
magazine. Campbell, the reporter who broke the story,
said that while Jason was on the s f aff he was "never a
significant part of our operation." But, he said, no one
knows how much Jason used his role as a reporter to
uncover facts for the police. In a vaguely-worded letter to
San Francisco State Journalism Prof. Bernard Liebes,
police officials denied that Jason was specifically assigned
to join the paper while attending classes from September,
1971, to October, 1972. But the officials observed that
Jason was free to exercise his "duty as a citizen" to report
whatever he learned that would be of use to the police —
which would seem to make their previous denials of
intention moot if not meaningless.
Besides the "simple" matter of an undercover agent on
campus, the incident raises the question of the First
Amendment rights of the Phoenix; after all, what good is
confidentiality of sources when the source might be giving
his information to a police officer? If Jason did in fact use
his reporter's role to cover his intelligence-gathering, he
was setting an ominous precedent. But Campbell says that
since the San Francisco Police Department denies that
Jason was specifically assigned to infiltrate the Phoenix,
the paper has no legal grounds for a suit against the
department.
'Wouldn't Hesitate'
Undersheriff Tom Rosa of Santa Clara County, which
has legal jurisdiction over the Stanford campus, says that
his department "wouldn't hesitate" to send undercover
agents onto the campus "if we thought we needed them
to get information we wanted." Although he says that
there are currently no undercover agents on the campus,
"we did have some undercover people there during the

time when there was the most trouble." For the moment,
though, Rosa says that "we've found we can get just as
much fix m reading the Daily as other organizations get
from more 'cloak-and-dagger' operations." Unlike the San
Francisco Police Department, Rosa says he would never
ask deputie. or reservists normally attending classes at
Stanford to serve as intelligence officers as well. "They're
only there to get an education," he declares.
Stanford's Department of Public Safety lacks official
police status, and Marvin Herrington, the department's
director, says that it maintains neither undercover agents
nor informants. "We read the Daily for most of our
information," he says. "We respond to events, be they
crimes or disruptions or whatever." He concedes that
people "occasionally" stop by or phone the department
with information, but says that no one is paid for such
intelligence and that there are no persons who regularly
provide this information. Confirms Capt. Frank
Benaderet: "There is no formal or structured
informational system ... no one is on even a semblance of
a paid basis."
Student Informer
Such has not always been the case with the
department, though. In 1970, the year before Herrington
became director, a Stanford officer tried to persuade a
female student to infiltrate a campus radical group. The
girl served as an informant for about three weeks, then
went to the Daily and to KZSU News with her story. She
alleged that the Stanford officer had offered to find her a
summer job and to treat her and her boy friend to a night
on the town in exchange for her services. When the story
broke, the then-security director denied the existence of
such a "steak fund" to pay informants, and claimed that
the officer had been operating without department
sanction. Significantly, though, the information gained by
the officer "on his own" had been made available to Santa
Clara County Sheriff's deputies and to Palo Alto city
police, the director admitted.
Herrington concedes that although his department no
longer maintains such informants, it still keeps extensive
files of photographs taken at campus demonstrations even
when no illegal activity occurs. These photos, he says, are
open to public inspection, and those not used in criminal
prosecutions are eventually destroyed within about a year.
Undercover Ban
How long will law enforcement surveillance on the
campuses continue? It seems unlikely that organizations
like the FBI or the San Francisco Police Department will
phase out their operations in the near future. A bill
authored two years ago by California Assemblyman John
J. Miller (D.-Berkeley) which would have barred
undercover police officers from college campuses died in a
legislative committee, but Miller says he'll reintroduce the
measure this year in light of the San Francisco State
incident. Although the bill would 'eave FBI and similar
operations untouched, it represerLs the best — and at the
moment, the only — prospect for limiting undercover
police operations on the state's college campuses.

measure this year in light of the San Francisco State
incident. Although the bill would 'eave FBI and similar
operations untouched, it represerLs the best — and at the
moment, the only — prospect for limiting undercover
police operations on the state's college campuses.
(Author's note: The following article was originally
prepared for a course in April. It has been slightly updated
to include information on last week's arrest of
ex-Stanford radical James E. Johnson.)
In the days before Mario Savio and People's Park and
Cambodia, about the only time police ever came onto a
college campus was when a fraternity's initiation stunt got
out of hand. The first time at many campuses when
outside police were called in to quell demonstrations,
there were outraged cries from faculty and students, and
apologetic statements from administrators. But today,
police presence — particularly undercover intelligence and
surveillance — has become so pervasive that it may pose a
real danger to the notion of "academic freedom" — and
perhaps to the rights of students and faculty as well.
Despite the current "cooling of the campuses," it
appears that many law enforcement agencies have either
maintained or intensified their information-gathering
operations. Not surprisingly, the campuses where they
remain the most active are those with possibly the last
vestiges of the radical student movement of the late
1960'5, such as Stanford and San Francisco State
University.
Shadowy
The most shadowy — and reputedly the most active —
law organizations operating on these campuses and at the
University of California in Berkeley are the FBI and the
state Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation
(CII). But these organizations as a matter of policy will
neither confirm nor deny any reports about their activities
on the campuses.
Former Stanford English Prof. H. Bruce Franklin, a
member of the Maoist Venceremos organization's central
committee, says that the two organizations usually do not
utilize undercover agents as such. Instead, he says, they
"depend on vast numbers of informers; the agents are
generally used to investigate the stuff the informers give
them." These informants are sometimes paid, he says;
others, "frequently including administrators and
professors," are not on such a formal basis.
Franklin refused to cite examples for his allegations
because, he said, "we want to keep certain information
about what we know to ourselves. We don't want them
flaw enforcement agencies] to know how much we
know." But he states flatly that "there are a number of
undercover operatives, informants and agents" on the
Stanford campus, and claimed that a still-unsolved April,
1970 arson fire at the Stanford Center for Advanced
Research in the Behavioral Sciences was set by an FBI
informant to "establish his credibility" with campus
radicals. He would not name the alleged informant.

Security Subcommittee, radical-turned-informer Thomas
Edward Mosher said it "was revealed" to him that
ex-campus radical James Edward Johnson set the blaze.

Johnson, sought by Santa Cruz County authorities on an
unrelated charge, disappeared shortly after Mosher's
testimony; he was arrested last week, and is being held in
San Juan, P.R., pending extradition. He has not been
charged with the Stanford fire.)
FBI Won't Answer
According to Thomas Druken, assistant to the special
agent in charge of the FBl's San Francisco fie'd office, the
bureau refuses to answer all questions aboui its campus
activities, and its refusal "is not to infei that such
operations are or are not being conducted." Virtually the
only official confirmation that the FBI has ever been
investigating Venceremos comes from a House Internal
Security Committee (HISC) report issued last summer
which includes lengthy testimony from a husband-wife
team of informants that infiltrated Venceremos and
another Bay Area radical group, the Revolutionary Union.
The report observes that the FBI "has, as usual, been
doing a highly commendable job in covering the activities
of revolutionary groups and forwarding its evidence to the
Department of Justice."
In at least one instance, though, the Stanford public
received an insight into how that "commendable job" is
executed. After turning down an informal invitation to
join the Revolutionary Union three years ago, a Stanford
Daily reporter named Phil Revzin volunteered his
"services" as an informant to the FBl's Palo Alto office.
Although not previously involved in radical activities,
Revzin found that the FBI had a file of extensive and
detailed information about him — his home address in
Chicago, his roommates' names, even clippings of his
newspaper articles. He was given a code name — "Ron
Goldstein" — and told to keep the bureau informed on
whatever he saw in the RU. Revzin continued the charade
for several days and then quit and recounted his
experiences in a Daily article.

Analysis And Commentary

CII Activities
Like the FBI, the CII is rumored to be extensively
engaged in intelligence-gathering on and around college
communities, and like the FBI, CII officials refuse to
either confirm or deny those rumors. A division of the
California Department of Justice under the control of
state Atty. Gen. Evelle J. Younger, the organization
reportedly uses its links with newspaper reporters to leak
information on radical activities. It was allegedly the
source of a controversial San Francisco Examiner article
in March, 1969, that reported that 1973 had been set as
the "target date" for a revolutionary takeover of the
United States.
Because local law enforcement agencies lack the
resources of the FBI and CII — and also possibly because
they are more open to public scrutiny — they are

generally less sophisticated in their intelligence operations.
Local agencies more frequently resort to actual
undercover agents rather than informants, and those
informants they do utilize are on a less-formal basis.
One of the most extensive local undercover operations
is the San Francisco Police Department's Intelligence
Unit. Lt. Paul Lawler of the Unit recently told the San
Francisco Examiner that "there are more than 50 San
Francisco police officers attending classes at San
Francisco State University," although he hastened to add
that "they're not all undercover officers." Other sources
place the number of actual intelligence officers at about
30, although David Campbell, special city editor of the
San Francisco State Phoenix student newspaper, says that
"no one really thinks that those other 20 aren't going to
report anything they find out."
Infiltration
The Phoenix itself recently got a look at the
Intelligence Unit's operations. In testimony at a trial in
nearby Marin County last February, a 25-year-old
Intelligence Unit officer named Alexander Jason revealed
that he infiltrated a campus Venceremos-sponsored study
group while posing as a student. Several days later, the
Phoenix revealed that at the same time Jason was
infiltrating the Venceremos group, he had been working as
a reporter for the Phoenix and for "Prism," a student
magazine. Campbell, the reporter who broke the story,
said that while Jason was on the s f aff he was "never a
significant part of our operation." But, he said, no one
knows how much Jason used his role as a reporter to
uncover facts for the police. In a vaguely-worded letter to
San Francisco State Journalism Prof. Bernard Liebes,
police officials denied that Jason was specifically assigned
to join the paper while attending classes from September,
1971, to October, 1972. But the officials observed that
Jason was free to exercise his "duty as a citizen" to report
whatever he learned that would be of use to the police —
which would seem to make their previous denials of
intention moot if not meaningless.
Besides the "simple" matter of an undercover agent on
campus, the incident raises the question of the First
Amendment rights of the Phoenix; after all, what good is
confidentiality of sources when the source might be giving
his information to a police officer? If Jason did in fact use
his reporter's role to cover his intelligence-gathering, he
was setting an ominous precedent. But Campbell says that
since the San Francisco Police Department denies that
Jason was specifically assigned to infiltrate the Phoenix,
the paper has no legal grounds for a suit against the
department.
'Wouldn't Hesitate'
Undersheriff Tom Rosa of Santa Clara County, which
has legal jurisdiction over the Stanford campus, says that
his department "wouldn't hesitate" to send undercover
agents onto the campus "if we thought we needed them
to get information we wanted." Although he says that
there are currently no undercover agents on the campus,
"we did have some undercover people there during the

time when there was the most trouble." For the moment,
though, Rosa says that "we've found we can get just as
much fix m reading the Daily as other organizations get
from more 'cloak-and-dagger' operations." Unlike the San
Francisco Police Department, Rosa says he would never
ask deputie. or reservists normally attending classes at
Stanford to serve as intelligence officers as well. "They're
only there to get an education," he declares.
Stanford's Department of Public Safety lacks official
police status, and Marvin Herrington, the department's
director, says that it maintains neither undercover agents
nor informants. "We read the Daily for most of our
information," he says. "We respond to events, be they
crimes or disruptions or whatever." He concedes that
people "occasionally" stop by or phone the department
with information, but says that no one is paid for such
intelligence and that there are no persons who regularly
provide this information. Confirms Capt. Frank
Benaderet: "There is no formal or structured
informational system ... no one is on even a semblance of
a paid basis."
Student Informer
Such has not always been the case with the
department, though. In 1970, the year before Herrington
became director, a Stanford officer tried to persuade a
female student to infiltrate a campus radical group. The
girl served as an informant for about three weeks, then
went to the Daily and to KZSU News with her story. She
alleged that the Stanford officer had offered to find her a
summer job and to treat her and her boy friend to a night
on the town in exchange for her services. When the story
broke, the then-security director denied the existence of
such a "steak fund" to pay informants, and claimed that
the officer had been operating without department
sanction. Significantly, though, the information gained by
the officer "on his own" had been made available to Santa
Clara County Sheriff's deputies and to Palo Alto city
police, the director admitted.
Herrington concedes that although his department no
longer maintains such informants, it still keeps extensive
files of photographs taken at campus demonstrations even
when no illegal activity occurs. These photos, he says, are
open to public inspection, and those not used in criminal
prosecutions are eventually destroyed within about a year.
Undercover Ban
How long will law enforcement surveillance on the
campuses continue? It seems unlikely that organizations
like the FBI or the San Francisco Police Department will
phase out their operations in the near future. A bill
authored two years ago by California Assemblyman John
J. Miller (D.-Berkeley) which would have barred
undercover police officers from college campuses died in a
legislative committee, but Miller says he'll reintroduce the
measure this year in light of the San Francisco State
incident. Although the bill would 'eave FBI and similar
operations untouched, it represerLs the best — and at the

phase out their operations in the near future. A bill
authored two years ago by California Assemblyman John
J. Miller (D.-Berkeley) which would have barred
undercover police officers from college campuses died in a
legislative committee, but Miller says he'll reintroduce the
measure this year in light of the San Francisco State
incident. Although the bill would 'eave FBI and similar
operations untouched, it represerLs the best — and at the
moment, the only — prospect for limiting undercover
police operations on the state's college campuses.
(Author's note: The following article was originally
prepared for a course in April. It has been slightly updated
to include information on last week's arrest of
ex-Stanford radical James E. Johnson.)
In the days before Mario Savio and People's Park and
Cambodia, about the only time police ever came onto a
college campus was when a fraternity's initiation stunt got
out of hand. The first time at many campuses when
outside police were called in to quell demonstrations,
there were outraged cries from faculty and students, and
apologetic statements from administrators. But today,
police presence — particularly undercover intelligence and
surveillance — has become so pervasive that it may pose a
real danger to the notion of "academic freedom" — and
perhaps to the rights of students and faculty as well.
Despite the current "cooling of the campuses," it
appears that many law enforcement agencies have either
maintained or intensified their information-gathering
operations. Not surprisingly, the campuses where they
remain the most active are those with possibly the last
vestiges of the radical student movement of the late
1960'5, such as Stanford and San Francisco State
University.
Shadowy
The most shadowy — and reputedly the most active —
law organizations operating on these campuses and at the
University of California in Berkeley are the FBI and the
state Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation
(CII). But these organizations as a matter of policy will
neither confirm nor deny any reports about their activities
on the campuses.
Former Stanford English Prof. H. Bruce Franklin, a
member of the Maoist Venceremos organization's central
committee, says that the two organizations usually do not
utilize undercover agents as such. Instead, he says, they
"depend on vast numbers of informers; the agents are
generally used to investigate the stuff the informers give
them." These informants are sometimes paid, he says;
others, "frequently including administrators and
professors," are not on such a formal basis.
Franklin refused to cite examples for his allegations
because, he said, "we want to keep certain information
about what we know to ourselves. We don't want them
flaw enforcement agencies] to know how much we
know." But he states flatly that "there are a number of
undercover operatives, informants and agents" on the
Stanford campus, and claimed that a still-unsolved April,
1970 arson fire at the Stanford Center for Advanced
Research in the Behavioral Sciences was set by an FBI
informant to "establish his credibility" with campus
radicals. He would not name the alleged informant.

Security Subcommittee, radical-turned-informer Thomas
Edward Mosher said it "was revealed" to him that
ex-campus radical James Edward Johnson set the blaze.

Johnson, sought by Santa Cruz County authorities on an
unrelated charge, disappeared shortly after Mosher's
testimony; he was arrested last week, and is being held in
San Juan, P.R., pending extradition. He has not been
charged with the Stanford fire.)
FBI Won't Answer
According to Thomas Druken, assistant to the special
agent in charge of the FBl's San Francisco fie'd office, the
bureau refuses to answer all questions aboui its campus
activities, and its refusal "is not to infei that such
operations are or are not being conducted." Virtually the
only official confirmation that the FBI has ever been
investigating Venceremos comes from a House Internal
Security Committee (HISC) report issued last summer
which includes lengthy testimony from a husband-wife
team of informants that infiltrated Venceremos and
another Bay Area radical group, the Revolutionary Union.
The report observes that the FBI "has, as usual, been
doing a highly commendable job in covering the activities
of revolutionary groups and forwarding its evidence to the
Department of Justice."
In at least one instance, though, the Stanford public
received an insight into how that "commendable job" is
executed. After turning down an informal invitation to
join the Revolutionary Union three years ago, a Stanford
Daily reporter named Phil Revzin volunteered his
"services" as an informant to the FBl's Palo Alto office.
Although not previously involved in radical activities,
Revzin found that the FBI had a file of extensive and
detailed information about him — his home address in
Chicago, his roommates' names, even clippings of his
newspaper articles. He was given a code name — "Ron
Goldstein" — and told to keep the bureau informed on
whatever he saw in the RU. Revzin continued the charade
for several days and then quit and recounted his
experiences in a Daily article.

Analysis And Commentary

CII Activities
Like the FBI, the CII is rumored to be extensively
engaged in intelligence-gathering on and around college
communities, and like the FBI, CII officials refuse to
either confirm or deny those rumors. A division of the
California Department of Justice under the control of
state Atty. Gen. Evelle J. Younger, the organization
reportedly uses its links with newspaper reporters to leak
information on radical activities. It was allegedly the
source of a controversial San Francisco Examiner article
in March, 1969, that reported that 1973 had been set as
the "target date" for a revolutionary takeover of the
United States.
Because local law enforcement agencies lack the
resources of the FBI and CII — and also possibly because
they are more open to public scrutiny — they are

generally less sophisticated in their intelligence operations.
Local agencies more frequently resort to actual
undercover agents rather than informants, and those
informants they do utilize are on a less-formal basis.
One of the most extensive local undercover operations
is the San Francisco Police Department's Intelligence
Unit. Lt. Paul Lawler of the Unit recently told the San
Francisco Examiner that "there are more than 50 San
Francisco police officers attending classes at San
Francisco State University," although he hastened to add
that "they're not all undercover officers." Other sources
place the number of actual intelligence officers at about
30, although David Campbell, special city editor of the
San Francisco State Phoenix student newspaper, says that
"no one really thinks that those other 20 aren't going to
report anything they find out."
Infiltration
The Phoenix itself recently got a look at the
Intelligence Unit's operations. In testimony at a trial in
nearby Marin County last February, a 25-year-old
Intelligence Unit officer named Alexander Jason revealed
that he infiltrated a campus Venceremos-sponsored study
group while posing as a student. Several days later, the
Phoenix revealed that at the same time Jason was
infiltrating the Venceremos group, he had been working as
a reporter for the Phoenix and for "Prism," a student
magazine. Campbell, the reporter who broke the story,
said that while Jason was on the s f aff he was "never a
significant part of our operation." But, he said, no one
knows how much Jason used his role as a reporter to
uncover facts for the police. In a vaguely-worded letter to
San Francisco State Journalism Prof. Bernard Liebes,
police officials denied that Jason was specifically assigned
to join the paper while attending classes from September,
1971, to October, 1972. But the officials observed that
Jason was free to exercise his "duty as a citizen" to report
whatever he learned that would be of use to the police —
which would seem to make their previous denials of
intention moot if not meaningless.
Besides the "simple" matter of an undercover agent on
campus, the incident raises the question of the First
Amendment rights of the Phoenix; after all, what good is
confidentiality of sources when the source might be giving
his information to a police officer? If Jason did in fact use
his reporter's role to cover his intelligence-gathering, he
was setting an ominous precedent. But Campbell says that
since the San Francisco Police Department denies that
Jason was specifically assigned to infiltrate the Phoenix,
the paper has no legal grounds for a suit against the
department.
'Wouldn't Hesitate'
Undersheriff Tom Rosa of Santa Clara County, which
has legal jurisdiction over the Stanford campus, says that
his department "wouldn't hesitate" to send undercover
agents onto the campus "if we thought we needed them
to get information we wanted." Although he says that
there are currently no undercover agents on the campus,
"we did have some undercover people there during the

time when there was the most trouble." For the moment,
though, Rosa says that "we've found we can get just as
much fix m reading the Daily as other organizations get
from more 'cloak-and-dagger' operations." Unlike the San
Francisco Police Department, Rosa says he would never
ask deputie. or reservists normally attending classes at
Stanford to serve as intelligence officers as well. "They're
only there to get an education," he declares.
Stanford's Department of Public Safety lacks official
police status, and Marvin Herrington, the department's
director, says that it maintains neither undercover agents
nor informants. "We read the Daily for most of our
information," he says. "We respond to events, be they
crimes or disruptions or whatever." He concedes that
people "occasionally" stop by or phone the department
with information, but says that no one is paid for such
intelligence and that there are no persons who regularly
provide this information. Confirms Capt. Frank
Benaderet: "There is no formal or structured
informational system ... no one is on even a semblance of
a paid basis."
Student Informer
Such has not always been the case with the
department, though. In 1970, the year before Herrington
became director, a Stanford officer tried to persuade a
female student to infiltrate a campus radical group. The
girl served as an informant for about three weeks, then
went to the Daily and to KZSU News with her story. She
alleged that the Stanford officer had offered to find her a
summer job and to treat her and her boy friend to a night
on the town in exchange for her services. When the story
broke, the then-security director denied the existence of
such a "steak fund" to pay informants, and claimed that
the officer had been operating without department
sanction. Significantly, though, the information gained by
the officer "on his own" had been made available to Santa
Clara County Sheriff's deputies and to Palo Alto city
police, the director admitted.
Herrington concedes that although his department no
longer maintains such informants, it still keeps extensive
files of photographs taken at campus demonstrations even
when no illegal activity occurs. These photos, he says, are
open to public inspection, and those not used in criminal
prosecutions are eventually destroyed within about a year.
Undercover Ban
How long will law enforcement surveillance on the
campuses continue? It seems unlikely that organizations
like the FBI or the San Francisco Police Department will
phase out their operations in the near future. A bill
authored two years ago by California Assemblyman John
J. Miller (D.-Berkeley) which would have barred
undercover police officers from college campuses died in a

open to public inspection, and those not used in criminal
prosecutions are eventually destroyed within about a year.
Undercover Ban
How long will law enforcement surveillance on the
campuses continue? It seems unlikely that organizations
like the FBI or the San Francisco Police Department will
phase out their operations in the near future. A bill
authored two years ago by California Assemblyman John
J. Miller (D.-Berkeley) which would have barred
undercover police officers from college campuses died in a
legislative committee, but Miller says he'll reintroduce the
measure this year in light of the San Francisco State
incident. Although the bill would 'eave FBI and similar
operations untouched, it represerLs the best — and at the
moment, the only — prospect for limiting undercover
police operations on the state's college campuses.
(Author's note: The following article was originally
prepared for a course in April. It has been slightly updated
to include information on last week's arrest of
ex-Stanford radical James E. Johnson.)
In the days before Mario Savio and People's Park and
Cambodia, about the only time police ever came onto a
college campus was when a fraternity's initiation stunt got
out of hand. The first time at many campuses when
outside police were called in to quell demonstrations,
there were outraged cries from faculty and students, and
apologetic statements from administrators. But today,
police presence — particularly undercover intelligence and
surveillance — has become so pervasive that it may pose a
real danger to the notion of "academic freedom" — and
perhaps to the rights of students and faculty as well.
Despite the current "cooling of the campuses," it
appears that many law enforcement agencies have either
maintained or intensified their information-gathering
operations. Not surprisingly, the campuses where they
remain the most active are those with possibly the last
vestiges of the radical student movement of the late
1960'5, such as Stanford and San Francisco State
University.
Shadowy
The most shadowy — and reputedly the most active —
law organizations operating on these campuses and at the
University of California in Berkeley are the FBI and the
state Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation
(CII). But these organizations as a matter of policy will
neither confirm nor deny any reports about their activities
on the campuses.
Former Stanford English Prof. H. Bruce Franklin, a
member of the Maoist Venceremos organization's central
committee, says that the two organizations usually do not
utilize undercover agents as such. Instead, he says, they
"depend on vast numbers of informers; the agents are
generally used to investigate the stuff the informers give
them." These informants are sometimes paid, he says;
others, "frequently including administrators and
professors," are not on such a formal basis.
Franklin refused to cite examples for his allegations
because, he said, "we want to keep certain information
about what we know to ourselves. We don't want them
flaw enforcement agencies] to know how much we
know." But he states flatly that "there are a number of
undercover operatives, informants and agents" on the
Stanford campus, and claimed that a still-unsolved April,
1970 arson fire at the Stanford Center for Advanced
Research in the Behavioral Sciences was set by an FBI
informant to "establish his credibility" with campus
radicals. He would not name the alleged informant.

Security Subcommittee, radical-turned-informer Thomas
Edward Mosher said it "was revealed" to him that
ex-campus radical James Edward Johnson set the blaze.

Johnson, sought by Santa Cruz County authorities on an
unrelated charge, disappeared shortly after Mosher's
testimony; he was arrested last week, and is being held in
San Juan, P.R., pending extradition. He has not been
charged with the Stanford fire.)
FBI Won't Answer
According to Thomas Druken, assistant to the special
agent in charge of the FBl's San Francisco fie'd office, the
bureau refuses to answer all questions aboui its campus
activities, and its refusal "is not to infei that such
operations are or are not being conducted." Virtually the
only official confirmation that the FBI has ever been
investigating Venceremos comes from a House Internal
Security Committee (HISC) report issued last summer
which includes lengthy testimony from a husband-wife
team of informants that infiltrated Venceremos and
another Bay Area radical group, the Revolutionary Union.
The report observes that the FBI "has, as usual, been
doing a highly commendable job in covering the activities
of revolutionary groups and forwarding its evidence to the
Department of Justice."
In at least one instance, though, the Stanford public
received an insight into how that "commendable job" is
executed. After turning down an informal invitation to
join the Revolutionary Union three years ago, a Stanford
Daily reporter named Phil Revzin volunteered his
"services" as an informant to the FBl's Palo Alto office.
Although not previously involved in radical activities,
Revzin found that the FBI had a file of extensive and
detailed information about him — his home address in
Chicago, his roommates' names, even clippings of his
newspaper articles. He was given a code name — "Ron
Goldstein" — and told to keep the bureau informed on
whatever he saw in the RU. Revzin continued the charade
for several days and then quit and recounted his
experiences in a Daily article.

Analysis And Commentary

CII Activities
Like the FBI, the CII is rumored to be extensively
engaged in intelligence-gathering on and around college
communities, and like the FBI, CII officials refuse to
either confirm or deny those rumors. A division of the
California Department of Justice under the control of
state Atty. Gen. Evelle J. Younger, the organization
reportedly uses its links with newspaper reporters to leak
information on radical activities. It was allegedly the
source of a controversial San Francisco Examiner article
in March, 1969, that reported that 1973 had been set as
the "target date" for a revolutionary takeover of the
United States.
Because local law enforcement agencies lack the
resources of the FBI and CII — and also possibly because
they are more open to public scrutiny — they are

generally less sophisticated in their intelligence operations.
Local agencies more frequently resort to actual
undercover agents rather than informants, and those
informants they do utilize are on a less-formal basis.
One of the most extensive local undercover operations
is the San Francisco Police Department's Intelligence
Unit. Lt. Paul Lawler of the Unit recently told the San
Francisco Examiner that "there are more than 50 San
Francisco police officers attending classes at San
Francisco State University," although he hastened to add
that "they're not all undercover officers." Other sources
place the number of actual intelligence officers at about
30, although David Campbell, special city editor of the
San Francisco State Phoenix student newspaper, says that
"no one really thinks that those other 20 aren't going to
report anything they find out."
Infiltration
The Phoenix itself recently got a look at the
Intelligence Unit's operations. In testimony at a trial in
nearby Marin County last February, a 25-year-old
Intelligence Unit officer named Alexander Jason revealed
that he infiltrated a campus Venceremos-sponsored study
group while posing as a student. Several days later, the
Phoenix revealed that at the same time Jason was
infiltrating the Venceremos group, he had been working as
a reporter for the Phoenix and for "Prism," a student
magazine. Campbell, the reporter who broke the story,
said that while Jason was on the s f aff he was "never a
significant part of our operation." But, he said, no one
knows how much Jason used his role as a reporter to
uncover facts for the police. In a vaguely-worded letter to
San Francisco State Journalism Prof. Bernard Liebes,
police officials denied that Jason was specifically assigned
to join the paper while attending classes from September,
1971, to October, 1972. But the officials observed that
Jason was free to exercise his "duty as a citizen" to report
whatever he learned that would be of use to the police —
which would seem to make their previous denials of
intention moot if not meaningless.
Besides the "simple" matter of an undercover agent on
campus, the incident raises the question of the First
Amendment rights of the Phoenix; after all, what good is
confidentiality of sources when the source might be giving
his information to a police officer? If Jason did in fact use
his reporter's role to cover his intelligence-gathering, he
was setting an ominous precedent. But Campbell says that
since the San Francisco Police Department denies that
Jason was specifically assigned to infiltrate the Phoenix,
the paper has no legal grounds for a suit against the
department.
'Wouldn't Hesitate'
Undersheriff Tom Rosa of Santa Clara County, which
has legal jurisdiction over the Stanford campus, says that
his department "wouldn't hesitate" to send undercover
agents onto the campus "if we thought we needed them
to get information we wanted." Although he says that
there are currently no undercover agents on the campus,
"we did have some undercover people there during the

time when there was the most trouble." For the moment,
though, Rosa says that "we've found we can get just as
much fix m reading the Daily as other organizations get
from more 'cloak-and-dagger' operations." Unlike the San
Francisco Police Department, Rosa says he would never
ask deputie. or reservists normally attending classes at
Stanford to serve as intelligence officers as well. "They're
only there to get an education," he declares.
Stanford's Department of Public Safety lacks official
police status, and Marvin Herrington, the department's
director, says that it maintains neither undercover agents
nor informants. "We read the Daily for most of our
information," he says. "We respond to events, be they
crimes or disruptions or whatever." He concedes that
people "occasionally" stop by or phone the department
with information, but says that no one is paid for such
intelligence and that there are no persons who regularly
provide this information. Confirms Capt. Frank
Benaderet: "There is no formal or structured
informational system ... no one is on even a semblance of
a paid basis."
Student Informer
Such has not always been the case with the
department, though. In 1970, the year before Herrington
became director, a Stanford officer tried to persuade a
female student to infiltrate a campus radical group. The
girl served as an informant for about three weeks, then
went to the Daily and to KZSU News with her story. She
alleged that the Stanford officer had offered to find her a
summer job and to treat her and her boy friend to a night
on the town in exchange for her services. When the story
broke, the then-security director denied the existence of
such a "steak fund" to pay informants, and claimed that
the officer had been operating without department
sanction. Significantly, though, the information gained by
the officer "on his own" had been made available to Santa
Clara County Sheriff's deputies and to Palo Alto city
police, the director admitted.
Herrington concedes that although his department no
longer maintains such informants, it still keeps extensive
files of photographs taken at campus demonstrations even
when no illegal activity occurs. These photos, he says, are
open to public inspection, and those not used in criminal
prosecutions are eventually destroyed within about a year.

Clara County Sheriff's deputies and to Palo Alto city
police, the director admitted.
Herrington concedes that although his department no
longer maintains such informants, it still keeps extensive
files of photographs taken at campus demonstrations even
when no illegal activity occurs. These photos, he says, are
open to public inspection, and those not used in criminal
prosecutions are eventually destroyed within about a year.
Undercover Ban
How long will law enforcement surveillance on the
campuses continue? It seems unlikely that organizations
like the FBI or the San Francisco Police Department will
phase out their operations in the near future. A bill
authored two years ago by California Assemblyman John
J. Miller (D.-Berkeley) which would have barred
undercover police officers from college campuses died in a
legislative committee, but Miller says he'll reintroduce the
measure this year in light of the San Francisco State
incident. Although the bill would 'eave FBI and similar
operations untouched, it represerLs the best — and at the
moment, the only — prospect for limiting undercover
police operations on the state's college campuses.
(Author's note: The following article was originally
prepared for a course in April. It has been slightly updated
to include information on last week's arrest of
ex-Stanford radical James E. Johnson.)
In the days before Mario Savio and People's Park and
Cambodia, about the only time police ever came onto a
college campus was when a fraternity's initiation stunt got
out of hand. The first time at many campuses when
outside police were called in to quell demonstrations,
there were outraged cries from faculty and students, and
apologetic statements from administrators. But today,
police presence — particularly undercover intelligence and
surveillance — has become so pervasive that it may pose a
real danger to the notion of "academic freedom" — and
perhaps to the rights of students and faculty as well.
Despite the current "cooling of the campuses," it
appears that many law enforcement agencies have either
maintained or intensified their information-gathering
operations. Not surprisingly, the campuses where they
remain the most active are those with possibly the last
vestiges of the radical student movement of the late
1960'5, such as Stanford and San Francisco State
University.
Shadowy
The most shadowy — and reputedly the most active —
law organizations operating on these campuses and at the
University of California in Berkeley are the FBI and the
state Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation
(CII). But these organizations as a matter of policy will
neither confirm nor deny any reports about their activities
on the campuses.
Former Stanford English Prof. H. Bruce Franklin, a
member of the Maoist Venceremos organization's central
committee, says that the two organizations usually do not
utilize undercover agents as such. Instead, he says, they
"depend on vast numbers of informers; the agents are
generally used to investigate the stuff the informers give
them." These informants are sometimes paid, he says;
others, "frequently including administrators and
professors," are not on such a formal basis.
Franklin refused to cite examples for his allegations
because, he said, "we want to keep certain information
about what we know to ourselves. We don't want them
flaw enforcement agencies] to know how much we
know." But he states flatly that "there are a number of
undercover operatives, informants and agents" on the
Stanford campus, and claimed that a still-unsolved April,
1970 arson fire at the Stanford Center for Advanced
Research in the Behavioral Sciences was set by an FBI
informant to "establish his credibility" with campus
radicals. He would not name the alleged informant.
(In testimony in early 1971 before the Senate Internal
Security Subcommittee, radical-turned-informer Thomas
Edward Mosher said it "was revealed" to him that
ex-campus radical James Edward Johnson set the blaze.

Johnson, sought by Santa Cruz County authorities on an
unrelated charge, disappeared shortly after Mosher's
testimony; he was arrested last week, and is being held in
San Juan, P.R., pending extradition. He has not been
charged with the Stanford fire.)
FBI Won't Answer
According to Thomas Druken, assistant to the special
agent in charge of the FBl's San Francisco fie'd office, the
bureau refuses to answer all questions aboui its campus
activities, and its refusal "is not to infei that such
operations are or are not being conducted." Virtually the
only official confirmation that the FBI has ever been
investigating Venceremos comes from a House Internal
Security Committee (HISC) report issued last summer
which includes lengthy testimony from a husband-wife
team of informants that infiltrated Venceremos and
another Bay Area radical group, the Revolutionary Union.
The report observes that the FBI "has, as usual, been
doing a highly commendable job in covering the activities
of revolutionary groups and forwarding its evidence to the
Department of Justice."
In at least one instance, though, the Stanford public
received an insight into how that "commendable job" is
executed. After turning down an informal invitation to
join the Revolutionary Union three years ago, a Stanford
Daily reporter named Phil Revzin volunteered his
"services" as an informant to the FBl's Palo Alto office.
Although not previously involved in radical activities,
Revzin found that the FBI had a file of extensive and
detailed information about him — his home address in
Chicago, his roommates' names, even clippings of his
newspaper articles. He was given a code name — "Ron
Goldstein" — and told to keep the bureau informed on
whatever he saw in the RU. Revzin continued the charade
for several days and then quit and recounted his
experiences in a Daily article.

Analysis And Commentary

CII Activities
Like the FBI, the CII is rumored to be extensively
engaged in intelligence-gathering on and around college
communities, and like the FBI, CII officials refuse to
either confirm or deny those rumors. A division of the
California Department of Justice under the control of
state Atty. Gen. Evelle J. Younger, the organization
reportedly uses its links with newspaper reporters to leak
information on radical activities. It was allegedly the
source of a controversial San Francisco Examiner article
in March, 1969, that reported that 1973 had been set as
the "target date" for a revolutionary takeover of the
United States.
Because local law enforcement agencies lack the
resources of the FBI and CII — and also possibly because
they are more open to public scrutiny — they are

generally less sophisticated in their intelligence operations.
Local agencies more frequently resort to actual
undercover agents rather than informants, and those
informants they do utilize are on a less-formal basis.
One of the most extensive local undercover operations
is the San Francisco Police Department's Intelligence
Unit. Lt. Paul Lawler of the Unit recently told the San
Francisco Examiner that "there are more than 50 San
Francisco police officers attending classes at San
Francisco State University," although he hastened to add
that "they're not all undercover officers." Other sources
place the number of actual intelligence officers at about
30, although David Campbell, special city editor of the
San Francisco State Phoenix student newspaper, says that
"no one really thinks that those other 20 aren't going to
report anything they find out."
Infiltration
The Phoenix itself recently got a look at the
Intelligence Unit's operations. In testimony at a trial in
nearby Marin County last February, a 25-year-old
Intelligence Unit officer named Alexander Jason revealed
that he infiltrated a campus Venceremos-sponsored study
group while posing as a student. Several days later, the
Phoenix revealed that at the same time Jason was
infiltrating the Venceremos group, he had been working as
a reporter for the Phoenix and for "Prism," a student
magazine. Campbell, the reporter who broke the story,
said that while Jason was on the s f aff he was "never a
significant part of our operation." But, he said, no one
knows how much Jason used his role as a reporter to
uncover facts for the police. In a vaguely-worded letter to
San Francisco State Journalism Prof. Bernard Liebes,
police officials denied that Jason was specifically assigned
to join the paper while attending classes from September,
1971, to October, 1972. But the officials observed that
Jason was free to exercise his "duty as a citizen" to report
whatever he learned that would be of use to the police —
which would seem to make their previous denials of
intention moot if not meaningless.
Besides the "simple" matter of an undercover agent on
campus, the incident raises the question of the First
Amendment rights of the Phoenix; after all, what good is
confidentiality of sources when the source might be giving
his information to a police officer? If Jason did in fact use
his reporter's role to cover his intelligence-gathering, he
was setting an ominous precedent. But Campbell says that
since the San Francisco Police Department denies that
Jason was specifically assigned to infiltrate the Phoenix,
the paper has no legal grounds for a suit against the
department.
'Wouldn't Hesitate'
Undersheriff Tom Rosa of Santa Clara County, which
has legal jurisdiction over the Stanford campus, says that
his department "wouldn't hesitate" to send undercover
agents onto the campus "if we thought we needed them
to get information we wanted." Although he says that
there are currently no undercover agents on the campus,
"we did have some undercover people there during the

time when there was the most trouble." For the moment,
though, Rosa says that "we've found we can get just as
much fix m reading the Daily as other organizations get
from more 'cloak-and-dagger' operations." Unlike the San
Francisco Police Department, Rosa says he would never
ask deputie. or reservists normally attending classes at
Stanford to serve as intelligence officers as well. "They're
only there to get an education," he declares.
Stanford's Department of Public Safety lacks official
police status, and Marvin Herrington, the department's
director, says that it maintains neither undercover agents
nor informants. "We read the Daily for most of our
information," he says. "We respond to events, be they
crimes or disruptions or whatever." He concedes that
people "occasionally" stop by or phone the department
with information, but says that no one is paid for such
intelligence and that there are no persons who regularly
provide this information. Confirms Capt. Frank
Benaderet: "There is no formal or structured
informational system ... no one is on even a semblance of
a paid basis."
Student Informer
Such has not always been the case with the
department, though. In 1970, the year before Herrington
became director, a Stanford officer tried to persuade a
female student to infiltrate a campus radical group. The
girl served as an informant for about three weeks, then
went to the Daily and to KZSU News with her story. She
alleged that the Stanford officer had offered to find her a
summer job and to treat her and her boy friend to a night
on the town in exchange for her services. When the story
broke, the then-security director denied the existence of
such a "steak fund" to pay informants, and claimed that
the officer had been operating without department
sanction. Significantly, though, the information gained by
the officer "on his own" had been made available to Santa
Clara County Sheriff's deputies and to Palo Alto city
police, the director admitted.
Herrington concedes that although his department no
longer maintains such informants, it still keeps extensive
files of photographs taken at campus demonstrations even
when no illegal activity occurs. These photos, he says, are
open to public inspection, and those not used in criminal
prosecutions are eventually destroyed within about a year.
