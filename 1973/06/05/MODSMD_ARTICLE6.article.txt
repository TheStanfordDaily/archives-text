## Yes On USE 
### 
On Wednesday, some 1600 University employees will
vote on whether to allow United Stanford Employees (USE)
to represent them in collective bargaining with the
University. The Daily urges that they vote yes.
In recent years, it has become apparent that Stanford
workers, who hold a variety of technical, maintenance, and
service jobs, need some organization which can protect their
interests. This is not to imply that the University is an ogre;
it is not. But when economic pressures prompt the
University to lay off long-term employees, it is only an
association of those employees which can counter this force.
A union would give employees some bargaining power
with which to change the University's layoff policies. It
would also help employees achieve better wages and working
conditions. Therefore, we feel, as we did last year before a
similar election, that the employees would be better off if
they were unionized.
The question last year, and this year, is whether a
particular union would truly help the employees. We believe
that USE, since its tie-in with the Service Employees
International Union (SEIU) of the AFL-CIO, is a
democratically-run union which represents the workers' best
interests.
The University, in an advertising campaign, has pointed
out, quite correctly, a number of actions a union could take
which would jeopardize the freedom of the individual
employee.
For example, a union could, conceivably, negotiate large
wage increases for some employees and small increases for
others. It could, by majority vote, call a strike crippling the
University, and force its members to obey picket lines.
These dangers are inherently present in unions. But we do
not feel they are likely in USE under its present set-up.
The SEIU is, in our opinion, a good, honest union. Its
national leadership has a record of not interfering in locals
unless those locals are corrupt.
One argument which has been used against USE is that its
leadership is too radical for the Stanford community. In the
past, USE has been active in political affairs, and, indeed,
was formed because of a split in the Stanford Employees
Association over Vietnam War protests.
However, we do not feel this past history to be a factor.
If the members of USE don't like politically-active
leadership, they have the opportunity under USE's
democratic constitution to swiftly vote it out of office.
Last year, we urged Stanford employees to vote against
the Teamsters, a union which offered none of the safeguards
that USE does against irresponsible, corrupt leadership. At
that time we concluded "they [the workers] can surely do
better than the Teamsters next year."
We feel that the workers, by petitioning for USE
representation, have done better. Although we, as students,
are not directly involved, we are convinced that the Stanford
community as a whole would benefit if the employees voted
"Yes" on USE, this Wednesday.

democratic constitution to swiftly vote it out of office.
Last year, we urged Stanford employees to vote against
the Teamsters, a union which offered none of the safeguards
that USE does against irresponsible, corrupt leadership. At
that time we concluded "they [the workers] can surely do
better than the Teamsters next year."
We feel that the workers, by petitioning for USE
representation, have done better. Although we, as students,
are not directly involved, we are convinced that the Stanford
community as a whole would benefit if the employees voted
"Yes" on USE, this Wednesday.
On Wednesday, some 1600 University employees will
vote on whether to allow United Stanford Employees (USE)
to represent them in collective bargaining with the
University. The Daily urges that they vote yes.
In recent years, it has become apparent that Stanford
workers, who hold a variety of technical, maintenance, and
service jobs, need some organization which can protect their
interests. This is not to imply that the University is an ogre;
it is not. But when economic pressures prompt the
University to lay off long-term employees, it is only an
association of those employees which can counter this force.
A union would give employees some bargaining power
with which to change the University's layoff policies. It
would also help employees achieve better wages and working
conditions. Therefore, we feel, as we did last year before a
similar election, that the employees would be better off if
they were unionized.
The question last year, and this year, is whether a
particular union would truly help the employees. We believe
that USE, since its tie-in with the Service Employees
International Union (SEIU) of the AFL-CIO, is a
democratically-run union which represents the workers' best
interests.
The University, in an advertising campaign, has pointed
out, quite correctly, a number of actions a union could take
which would jeopardize the freedom of the individual
employee.
For example, a union could, conceivably, negotiate large
wage increases for some employees and small increases for
others. It could, by majority vote, call a strike crippling the
University, and force its members to obey picket lines.
These dangers are inherently present in unions. But we do
not feel they are likely in USE under its present set-up.
The SEIU is, in our opinion, a good, honest union. Its
national leadership has a record of not interfering in locals
unless those locals are corrupt.
One argument which has been used against USE is that its
leadership is too radical for the Stanford community. In the
past, USE has been active in political affairs, and, indeed,
was formed because of a split in the Stanford Employees
Association over Vietnam War protests.
However, we do not feel this past history to be a factor.
If the members of USE don't like politically-active
leadership, they have the opportunity under USE's
democratic constitution to swiftly vote it out of office.
