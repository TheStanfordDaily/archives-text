# At Stanford Campus
## Capsule Found!

Daniel Brenner

STANFORD, CALIF. Earth (United Press Interplanetary) — June
5, 6152. A time capsule was found today at Harvard University's
Stanford, California campus. The capsule dates from the 20th
century, several decades before all private institutions were absorbed
by the Massachusetts university.
Bebe Debozo, museum curator, said the capsule contained copies
of the transcript from a "vote of confidence" hearing regarding a
tenured English professor who had been fired. The curator couldn't
figure out what finally happened but noted that the case went on for
years, costing the University thousands of dollars.
Also found was a fraternity bid from Phi Kappa Zappa, the house
involved in dismissing frats from campus. The ousting of Zappa
occurred after the members decided to throw pledges through the
windows of Durand House, and denied the act saying that the pledges
were just "jumpy." The bids themselves became a novelty when it was
found they had been printed on the back side of the president's
Rolodex cards.
"Incredible," was Debozo's exclamation when he uncovered the
final FCC power increase permit for radio station KZSU. The notice,
dated 1981, culminated years of bickering over funds allocated for the
power increase earlier that century. KZSU, Debozo explained, was a
radio station that used to broadcast programs before the advent of
sonar hearing devices.
Another relic from the 20th century was a mug, presumably lifted
from Stanford's Coffee House. Debozo suggested the mug was placed
in the capsule because rip-offs had caused the University to close
down the student union housing the Coffee House.
Also included was a "Recycle Now" bumper sticker. "Recycle"
was the term for voluntary collection of aluminum which became
mandatory years later.
Finally, several copies of a publication called Stanford Daily were
found. Curator Debozo believes this was the school paper but couldn't
be sure because it was, in his words, "too professional."
