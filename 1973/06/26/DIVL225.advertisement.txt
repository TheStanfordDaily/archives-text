REPORT ON STUDENT
DISCIPLINARY ACTION
Space paid for by News and Publications Service.
S, the house manager of a fraternity, stole Stanford
University requisition forms and forged University
authorization signatures on some of these forms. S billed
the charges to fraternities other than his own and, on
several occasions, presented the forms to University
Stores and thereby obtained supplies which he then
resold to his own fraternity. T, a member of the same
fraternity, joined with Sin-some of these activities.
At the time of the CJP hearing, S had pleaded guilty
in criminal court to one count of grand theft and was
awaiting sentencing. T had pleaded not guilty to three
felony counts and was awaiting trial. Sand T had made
full restitution to the University before the CJP con
sidered this case.
Rule 21 in the rules of procedure which constitute
the charge to the CJP provides in part that:
"If in a State or Federal Court, civil or criminal
penalties have already been assessed against a
student in a case arising out of an incident which is
the subject of the case before the Campus Judicial
Panel, the panel shall recommend such additional
sanctions, if any, which it believes necessary to
protect the persons, property, and functions of the
University."
A majority of CJP interpreted that rule as requiring
that when no criminal penalties have been assessed as of
the time of the CJP hearing, the CJP must decide what
sanctions additional to likely criminal penalties are
"necessary to protect the persons, property, and func
tions of the University."
The majority then concluded that as a general matter
if an offense against the University is also a serious crime
and criminal charges are brought, then unless the student
poses a potential danger to others, the disposition of the
matter by the criminal court, no matter what, serves the
University's interests, and the actual imposition of Uni
versity sanctions is not warranted.
Accordingly, the majority recommended that defend
ants Sand T be suspended for a period of two years, but
that the suspension itself be suspended and that the
defendants be placed on probation for the two-year
period.
Two members of the panel filed a minority report
disagreeing with the interpretation of Rule 21, with the
general conclusion that University offenses which are
also serious crimes do not warrant University sanctions,
and with the specific sanction recommended in this case.
President Lyman did not accept the majority inter
pretation of Rule 21 for the reason that the rule was
intended to require the CJP to consider penalties pre
viously assessed by external authorities but was not
intended to permit the CJP to abdicate its responsibility
to recommend a penalty by allowing a conclusion that
what the courts might do will be adequate to protect the
University's interests.
The President further decided that it was not accept
able to conclude as to any class of cases that any
disposition of criminal charges arising out of those cases,
no matter what, necessarily serves the interests of the
University.
With regard to the sanction in this particular case,
however. President Lyman concluded that while he
would have accepted a more severe penalty, he did not
regard the recommended two-year probation as so incon
sequential as to warrant his rejecting it.
In accepting this recommendation he took explicit
notice of the full restitution made by Sand T and added
a further condition of probation to the sanction against
S.
