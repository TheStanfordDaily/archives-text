# Dean Says Nixon Involved In Cover-Up
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
Fired White House counsel John W.
Dean IE testified before the Senate
Watergate Committee yesterday that
President Nixon was personally
involved in the Watergate cover-up.
Dean quoted the President as saying
he had personally discussed with
ex-Presidential counselor Charles W.
Colson a clemency offer to E. Howard
Hunt, a convicted Watergate
conspirator. The former White House
lawyer also stated "the President was
well aware of what had been going on
regarding the success of keeping the
White House out of the Watergate
scandal."
Dean said he told Nixon as early as
last Sept. 15, less than three months
after the break-in, that the wiretapping
cover-up might eventually unravel and
lead into the White House.
Recalling the conversation with
Nixon in September, Dean stated,
"The President told me I had done a
good job and he appreciated how
difficult a task it had been.
The ousted counsel said he believed
that the President did not realize "or
appreciate at any time the implications
of his involvement. He hoped that
"the President is forgiven" when all
the facts are known.

White House Press Secretary
Ronald Zeigler said President Nixon
"is fully aware of what is taking place"
at the Senate hearings, but refused to
comment.
In reading the 245-page prepared
statement, Dean, flanked by his wife
Maureen and his two attorneys,
described the day-by-day cover-up
events in excruciating detail.
Haldeman-Ehriichman
Dean calmly stated that Nixon told
him personally Feb. 27 that he
considered H.R. Haldeman and John
D. Ehrlichman, two of his top aides,
"principals" in the case. The President
ordered him to report directly to him
on the wiretapping affair, Dean said.
The ex-White House aide said he
warned Nixon of the "cancer growing
on the Presidency" with each new
twist in the cover-up attempt.
He went on to relate to Nixon that
perjury had been committed, that
former U.S. Atty. Gen. John Mitchell
and Haldeman had received the
Watergate wiretap information, and
that Herbert W. Kalmbach, Nixon's
personal attorney, had been used to
raise money for payoffs to three
Watergate defendants.
No Problem
Nixon replied that it would be no

problem to raise up to $1 million in
payoffs.
Dean also told the President that
"more perjury and more money would
be needed if the wiretap cover-up were
to continue.
He testified that he briefed former
U.S. Atty. Gen. Richard Kleindienst
and Asst. Atty. Gen. Henry E.
Petersen about G. Gordon Liddy's
masterminding of the Watergate
break-in.
Dean said the President lied when
he claimed on April 17 that he had

ordered an intense new investigation
into the scandal.
"In short, the President
commenced no investigation at all.
Rather, the President, Haldeman and
Ehrlichman commenced to protect
themselves against the unravelling of
the cover-up," he stated.
Prejudice
Dean accused Nixon of attempting
to prejudice talks the aide had with
the government for immunity in
exchange for testimony.
The 34 year-old counsel directly

implicated Haldeman and Ehrlichman
as cover-up directors, Mitchell and
Nixon campaign aides Robert C.
Mardian and Frederick C. La Rue as
involved from the start.
He also said that Haldeman and
other top White House officials were
behind a vast political spy ring to
gather embarassing intelligence on
Democratic senators and party leaders.
Among those who were targets
were Democratic National Committee
Chairman Lawrence F. O'Brien, Sens.
Edward Kennedy (D—Mass.), Edmund

Muskie (D—Maine), and George
McGovern (D— S.D.), as well as liberal
Republican Rep. Paul N. McCloskey
(R—Menlo Park).
'Keep Track'
Dean also testified that Nixon
ordered him to "keep track" of
reporters who covered the daily
Watergate happenings last year and
earlier this year.
Dean confirmed that
nationally-syndicated columnist
Joseph Kraft's telephone had been
tapped during cover-up attempts.


TRIPLE CHAMP — Alex "Sandy" Mayer led Stanford to its first NCAA tennis
title in history last week, winning the singles title and sharing the doubles crown
with teammate Jim Delaney. Mayer, who is now competing in Wimbledon, plans
to return to Stanford next season rather than turn professional.
