# Reality Must Match Rhetoric
## New Labor Relations Era Begins 
### 
1 Jack Truher

When University workers chose
United Stanford Employees in the
June 6 representation election,
they signaled a new era in
employee relations at Stanford. In
the coming months, workers will
be very much preoccupied with
the bread and butter issues
affecting the new bargaining unit.
The preparation of union
contract demands and subsequent
negotiations is new to many and
will challenge everybody involved.
After years of struggle to find an
appropriate form of organization,
we are entering a period of
conciliation and compromise
among workers who have even
had different visions of what
unionism is, or can become.
The government tells us that
the national economy is running a
9.2 percent annual inflationary
rate now, and our own
preliminary surveys show that a
cost-of-living salary clause tops

the priority list of contract
demands among U.S.E. people.
Following in order are: wage
rates, health and dental plans,
seniority protection, a layoff
policy, merit raises, retirement,
affirmative action, and others.
Working people are being
economically squeezed by the
failures in the national economy
which our leaders so sadly
bemoan. We hope that Stanford
administrators will assume a
decidedly more progressive
posture than they took prior to
the representation election.
During the weeks of
campaigning, University literature
was so blatantly anti-labor that
the Stanford A.S.S.U. Council of
Presidents and the Law School
Civil Rights Organization were
prompted to write: "As students
interested in the welfare of
Stanford workers, we were
outraged by the University's

financing of what was in fact
anti-union election propaganda."
It is important to know what
we are up against. The University
could be an exemplary institution,
first by guaranteeing the rights of
all members of the University
community. But for most
non-faculty staff, the University
has been a feudal institution with
any share of power bouncing
always out of grasp in a game
exclusively between the Trustees,
the administration, and a tightly
organized faculty lobby. To us,
working at Stanford has been a
spectator sport.
How can we reconcile the
University's anti-union stand with
President Lyman's
commencement comments that
"we should concentrate on
institutional reforms." Surely our
President knows that if we are to
avoid what he calls "the use of
hired thugs and safecrackers ...
and other kinds of corruption,"
then responsible and democratic
forms of participation must be
available. U.S.E. and the Service
Employees International Union
are progressive and untainted by
corruption, and all the university
should applaud this fact.
Many managers at Stanford, as
with others in business and in our
schools, routinely apply unfair
economic discrimination and
subtle forms of intimidation as
motivators for workers.
Some of us thought that the

; commencement speaker, John
Usher Monro, was speaking to
; Stanford workers (not students)
r when he said, "it is going to
, depend on you, on the values that
guide your thinking, on your own
. vision ... [of] what Stanford
\ should be and should do, and how
( much of yourself you put into the
( coming struggle." Monro called
America an "elective form of
monarchy," but a monarchy can
' not be without the collusion of
the institutions which support it.
1 Monro said to "fight for the
republic, at some risk and sacrifice
! of affluence and career, if need
1 be." But the republic is just the
5 sum of its people in their daily
: work. At Stanford, U.S.E. is
1 where the action is. We intend
r that the reality of the University
' will match its rhetoric.

When University workers chose
United Stanford Employees in the
June 6 representation election,
they signaled a new era in
employee relations at Stanford. In
the coming months, workers will
be very much preoccupied with
the bread and butter issues
affecting the new bargaining unit.
The preparation of union
contract demands and subsequent
negotiations is new to many and
will challenge everybody involved.
After years of struggle to find an
appropriate form of organization,
we are entering a period of
conciliation and compromise
among workers who have even
had different visions of what
unionism is, or can become.
The government tells us that
the national economy is running a
9.2 percent annual inflationary
rate now, and our own
preliminary surveys show that a
cost-of-living salary clause tops

the priority list of contract
demands among U.S.E. people.
Following in order are: wage
rates, health and dental plans,
seniority protection, a layoff
policy, merit raises, retirement,
affirmative action, and others.
Working people are being
economically squeezed by the
failures in the national economy
which our leaders so sadly
bemoan. We hope that Stanford
administrators will assume a
decidedly more progressive
posture than they took prior to
the representation election.
During the weeks of
campaigning, University literature
was so blatantly anti-labor that
the Stanford A.S.S.U. Council of
Presidents and the Law School
Civil Rights Organization were
prompted to write: "As students
interested in the welfare of
Stanford workers, we were
outraged by the University's

financing of what was in fact
anti-union election propaganda."
It is important to know what
we are up against. The University
could be an exemplary institution,
first by guaranteeing the rights of
all members of the University
