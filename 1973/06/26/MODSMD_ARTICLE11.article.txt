Daniel Schorr has grasped an
aspect of Jeb Magruder's June 14,
1973 testimony that he—and
I—find revealing. In response to a
question by Senator Baker,
Magruder explained the
frustration he and others working
in the White House experienced
with the anti-war movement.
Oblivious to the legal and ethical
distinctions between himself and
persons protesting policies by
actions for which they openly
accepted legal responsibility,
Magruder explained that he and
others convinced that Mr. Nixon
was assiduously pursuing the
proper policy and that those who

activities they believed to advance
Mr. Nixon's interests.
Unfortunately, the paranoia
implicit in this Administration's
attitude—expressed elsewhere in
Clay Whitehead's efforts to censor
news programs on public and
private television and in an
orchestrated campaign by Spiro
Agnew, Ron Ziegler and others to
discredit the news media—did not
originate with it. Nevertheless, we
are now compelled to contend
with a betrayal of our system of
government, a betrayal which had
its seeds in Lyndon Johnson's
equation of loyalty and agreement
with patriotism.
In 1965 through 1968, it
appeared that Johnson's efforts
to force a point of view upon
fhore who disagreed with his war
policies was destroying any faith
college age citizens might have in
our governmental system.
Perhaps it is time we learned to
be less threatened by ideas and
policies radically different from
those to which we are committed.
It is also time that we stop
treating the Presidential oath of
office as a halo and recall that the
founders of this country created a
government of laws and not of
men. They did not provide for a
process of impeachment because
they thought we would not need
it, but because they thought we
