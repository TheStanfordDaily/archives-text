Student Killed In Bike Accident
> • —
Robert Markey Steele, 18, a freshman from
Fredonia, N.Y., died June 6 from injuries he
suffered in a head-on bicycle collision shortly
after midnight June 5.
California Highway Patrol officers said
Steele's bike and another ridden by Christopher
E. Urbina, a freshmen from Pueblo, Colo.,
collided on Escondido Road between Wilbur and
Stern Halls. Officers said Steele was riding at a
high rate of speed, and was apparently on the
wrong side of the road.
Neither bike had lights.

junior golf championship, and was considered an
outstanding candidate for the Stanford golf
team.
CHP officers said Steele was thrown off his
bike in the crash, sustaining major head injuries.

Medical Center, where he underwent extensive
surgery. He died at 10:30 p.m., Wednesday, June
6.
Urbina was taken to Cowell Student Health
Center, where he was treated for a fractured

Senate Sets Judicial Referendum
After much political jockeying, the ASSU
Senate June 6 scheduled a student referendum
for the third week of fall quarter to approve the
new campus judicial system proposed by the
Committee of Fifteen (C-15).
The Senate unofficially recommended that
students endorse the system which provides for a
student majority which can be revoked by the
University President, Faculty Senate, of
defendant.
The referendum came as part of a series of
compromises between Senate members who
wanted the student legislature to give official
approval to the new plan and the ASSU Council

of Presidents, who oppose it.
ASSU President Kevin O'Grady and former
Vice President Brent Appel had attempted to
prevent the Senate from reaching a quorum, but
failed.
O'Grady later led a walkout of senators to
prevent official Senate approval of the judicial
system. With Senate approval, the system could
have been approved at the June 14 Faculty
Senate meeting and become operative before
students return in the fall.
O'Grady and the senators who left the
meeting returned finally, and Senate Chairman
Rocky Barber proposed the compromise
unofficial recommendation. '

Four Kids Face Heart Surgery
Special to the Daily
SANTA ROSA, Calif. Four children of a Santa
Rosa teamster will enter the Stanford Medical
Center today to prepare for open heart surgery
Thursday.
The four, ranging in age from four to 18, are
the children of Mr. and Mrs. David Costello. All
suffer from a hereditary condition known as an
atrial septal defect, according to hospital
spokesman Gary Cavalli.
The defect is a hole in the muscle wall of one
of the upper chambers of the heart. Cavalli said
the condition is not fatal, but can be
incapacitating if not surgically corrected.
The children are David Jr., 18; Richard, 15;
Kevin, 13; and Karen, four.
The operation was arranged by the Kaiser
Foundation. Stanford Drs. Norman Shumway
and Edward Stinson will each perform the
corrective surgery on two of the patients.
Shockley Suggests Theory Test
Oakland could be used to evaluate the theory
that black people are genetically inferior to
whites in terms of intelligence, Nobel Laureate
Electrical Engineering Prof. William Shockley
said June 14.
In remarks before the Lake Merritt Breakfast
Club in Oakland, Shockley suggested that the
city "might afford an opportunity to control for
environmental differences and to evaluate or
reject my preliminary finding that for low IQ
American Negro populations, each one percent
of Caucasian ancestry raises average IQ by about
one point."
Shockley also reiterated his view that "the
major cause of the American Negro's intellectual
and social deficits is heredity."
As a "thinking exercise," Shockley again
proposed a "voluntary sterilization bonus plan"
for all those with below normal IQs.
The government might pay those who choose
to be sterlized $1000 per IQ point below 100, he
suggested. The bonus would only be offered to

those who do not pay taxes, regardless of sex,
race or welfare status.
Io help find these low-IQ people, Shockley
envisioned a "bounty hunter" system with the
"hunter" receiving a part of the bonus for
locating eligible people.
"1 do not advocate the implementation of
such a policy," Shockley stated, "but I do
advocated objective inquiry."
The professor charged that the study of the
relative importance of racial and genetic factors
"is now being deplorably neglected in the
intellectual community."
Black students here condemned Shockley's
views as racist earlier this year after he proposed
similar University studies.
Secretary Pratt, 56,' Succumbs
Peter E. Pratt, 56, associate general secretary
of the University, died June 19 at his campus
home following extensive treatment for throat
cancer.
Pratt served as director of development and
the alumni fund for the Stanford Medical School.
Among other projects, he helped raise $450,000
for the Bissinger Radiation Therapy Center,
where he later underwent extensive treatment.
In recent years he headed East Coast
fund-raising activities for the University.
He was secretary of the Harvard Alumni
Association from 1949 to 1956 and served as an
officer of the New England Merchants Bank in
Boston before coming here in 1965.
Survivors include his wife, Constance Ballou
Pratt; two daughters, Mrs. Eugenie Pratt Cook of
Boston, and Mrs. Lili Pratt Duncheon of
Stanford, a son, Peter Egan Pratt Jr., a
sophomore at Evergreen State University; and a
brother, William Hall Brace Pratt of Santa
Monica.
A memorial service is planned at 1 p.m.
Friday, June 29, at Stanford Memorial Church,
followed by a military service at Alta Mesa
Cemetery, Palo Alto. The family prefers
contributions to either the Friends of Radiology
or the Department of Speech Therapy, both at
the Stanford Medical Center.

Electrical Engineering Prof. William Shockley
said June 14.
In remarks before the Lake Merritt Breakfast
Club in Oakland, Shockley suggested that the
city "might afford an opportunity to control for
environmental differences and to evaluate or
reject my preliminary finding that for low IQ
American Negro populations, each one percent
of Caucasian ancestry raises average IQ by about
one point."
Shockley also reiterated his view that "the
major cause of the American Negro's intellectual
and social deficits is heredity."
As a "thinking exercise," Shockley again
proposed a "voluntary sterilization bonus plan"
for all those with below normal IQs.
The government might pay those who choose
to be sterlized $1000 per IQ point below 100, he
suggested. The bonus would only be offered to

those who do not pay taxes, regardless of sex,
race or welfare status.
Io help find these low-IQ people, Shockley
envisioned a "bounty hunter" system with the
"hunter" receiving a part of the bonus for
locating eligible people.
"1 do not advocate the implementation of
such a policy," Shockley stated, "but I do
advocated objective inquiry."
The professor charged that the study of the
relative importance of racial and genetic factors
"is now being deplorably neglected in the
intellectual community."
Black students here condemned Shockley's
views as racist earlier this year after he proposed
similar University studies.

Senate Sets Judicial Referendum
After much political jockeying, the ASSU
Senate June 6 scheduled a student referendum
for the third week of fall quarter to approve the
new campus judicial system proposed by the
Committee of Fifteen (C-15).

Senate Sets Judicial Referendum
After much political jockeying, the ASSU
Senate June 6 scheduled a student referendum
for the third week of fall quarter to approve the
new campus judicial system proposed by the
Committee of Fifteen (C-15).
The Senate unofficially recommended that
students endorse the system which provides for a
student majority which can be revoked by the
University President, Faculty Senate, of
defendant.
The referendum came as part of a series of
compromises between Senate members who
wanted the student legislature to give official
approval to the new plan and the ASSU Council

of Presidents, who oppose it.
ASSU President Kevin O'Grady and former
Vice President Brent Appel had attempted to
prevent the Senate from reaching a quorum, but
failed.
O'Grady later led a walkout of senators to
prevent official Senate approval of the judicial
system. With Senate approval, the system could
have been approved at the June 14 Faculty
Senate meeting and become operative before
students return in the fall.
O'Grady and the senators who left the

Rocky Barber proposed the compromise
unofficial recommendation. '

Four Kids Face Heart Surgery
Special to the Daily
SANTA ROSA, Calif. Four children of a Santa
Rosa teamster will enter the Stanford Medical
Center today to prepare for open heart surgery
Thursday.
The four, ranging in age from four to 18, are
the children of Mr. and Mrs. David Costello. All
suffer from a hereditary condition known as an
atrial septal defect, according to hospital
spokesman Gary Cavalli.
The defect is a hole in the muscle wall of one
of the upper chambers of the heart. Cavalli said
the condition is not fatal, but can be
incapacitating if not surgically corrected.
The children are David Jr., 18; Richard, 15;
Kevin, 13; and Karen, four.
The operation was arranged by the Kaiser
Foundation. Stanford Drs. Norman Shumway
and Edward Stinson will each perform the
corrective surgery on two of the patients.
Shockley Suggests Theory Test
Oakland could be used to evaluate the theory
that black people are genetically inferior to
whites in terms of intelligence, Nobel Laureate
Electrical Engineering Prof. William Shockley
said June 14.
In remarks before the Lake Merritt Breakfast
Club in Oakland, Shockley suggested that the
city "might afford an opportunity to control for
environmental differences and to evaluate or
reject my preliminary finding that for low IQ
American Negro populations, each one percent
of Caucasian ancestry raises average IQ by about
one point."
Shockley also reiterated his view that "the
major cause of the American Negro's intellectual
and social deficits is heredity."
As a "thinking exercise," Shockley again
proposed a "voluntary sterilization bonus plan"
for all those with below normal IQs.
The government might pay those who choose
to be sterlized $1000 per IQ point below 100, he
suggested. The bonus would only be offered to

those who do not pay taxes, regardless of sex,
race or welfare status.
Io help find these low-IQ people, Shockley
envisioned a "bounty hunter" system with the
"hunter" receiving a part of the bonus for
locating eligible people.
"1 do not advocate the implementation of
such a policy," Shockley stated, "but I do
advocated objective inquiry."
The professor charged that the study of the
relative importance of racial and genetic factors
"is now being deplorably neglected in the
intellectual community."
Black students here condemned Shockley's
views as racist earlier this year after he proposed
similar University studies.
Secretary Pratt, 56,' Succumbs
Peter E. Pratt, 56, associate general secretary
of the University, died June 19 at his campus
home following extensive treatment for throat
cancer.
Pratt served as director of development and
the alumni fund for the Stanford Medical School.
Among other projects, he helped raise $450,000
for the Bissinger Radiation Therapy Center,
where he later underwent extensive treatment.
In recent years he headed East Coast
fund-raising activities for the University.
He was secretary of the Harvard Alumni
Association from 1949 to 1956 and served as an
officer of the New England Merchants Bank in
Boston before coming here in 1965.
Survivors include his wife, Constance Ballou
Pratt; two daughters, Mrs. Eugenie Pratt Cook of
Boston, and Mrs. Lili Pratt Duncheon of
Stanford, a son, Peter Egan Pratt Jr., a
sophomore at Evergreen State University; and a
brother, William Hall Brace Pratt of Santa
Monica.
A memorial service is planned at 1 p.m.

Club in Oakland, Shockley suggested that the
city "might afford an opportunity to control for
environmental differences and to evaluate or
reject my preliminary finding that for low IQ
American Negro populations, each one percent
of Caucasian ancestry raises average IQ by about
one point."
Shockley also reiterated his view that "the
major cause of the American Negro's intellectual
and social deficits is heredity."
As a "thinking exercise," Shockley again
proposed a "voluntary sterilization bonus plan"
for all those with below normal IQs.
The government might pay those who choose
to be sterlized $1000 per IQ point below 100, he
suggested. The bonus would only be offered to

those who do not pay taxes, regardless of sex,
race or welfare status.
Io help find these low-IQ people, Shockley
envisioned a "bounty hunter" system with the
"hunter" receiving a part of the bonus for
locating eligible people.
"1 do not advocate the implementation of
such a policy," Shockley stated, "but I do
advocated objective inquiry."
The professor charged that the study of the
relative importance of racial and genetic factors
"is now being deplorably neglected in the
intellectual community."
Black students here condemned Shockley's
views as racist earlier this year after he proposed
similar University studies.

Senate Sets Judicial Referendum
After much political jockeying, the ASSU
Senate June 6 scheduled a student referendum
for the third week of fall quarter to approve the
new campus judicial system proposed by the
Committee of Fifteen (C-15).
The Senate unofficially recommended that
students endorse the system which provides for a
student majority which can be revoked by the
University President, Faculty Senate, of
defendant.
The referendum came as part of a series of
compromises between Senate members who
wanted the student legislature to give official
approval to the new plan and the ASSU Council

of Presidents, who oppose it.
ASSU President Kevin O'Grady and former
Vice President Brent Appel had attempted to
prevent the Senate from reaching a quorum, but
failed.
O'Grady later led a walkout of senators to
prevent official Senate approval of the judicial
system. With Senate approval, the system could
