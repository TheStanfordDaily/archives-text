# Wyeth's Art Reveals His Temperment
## 
### BILL EVERS 
A retrospective exhibition of
many of the major works of
Andrew Wyeth opened June 16 at
the De Young Museum in San
Francisco and will run through
September 3.
Wyeth's realistic work has
made him one of the most
admired artists in the U.S. Clear
evidence of his popularity is the
sales of prints of Wyeth paintings
like Christina's World, depicting a
woman lying in a field looking
across it to an old New England
house on the horizon.
The exhibit at the De Young
includes Christina's World and
almost every other important
Wyeth work. The several rooms
used for the exhibit house nearly
one-hundred Wyeth pieces, hung
against a background of brown
and gray, colors pervasive in
Wyeth's work.
Wyeth's art is done with three
techniques: egg-tempera,
watercolor, and dry brush. Of
these, the disciplined and
meticulous efforts in tempera are
superior. Wyeth is at his best in
this technique — abstracting and
selecting details from reality to
convey his associations, moods,
and emotions.
In his watercolors and in many
of his works with a dry brush, the
control that successfully evokes
the proper play of emotion in his
tempera is absent. The watercolor
Cider Apples, for example, comes
very close to being
non-representational art.
Wyeth's greatest paintings have

their effect on us both in
reworking and reordering the
world so that we see it in better
focus and in calling forth
emotions connected, for example,
with decay of fragile human
finery (Wind from the Sea), warm
love and admiration (Maga's
Daughter), disorientation (Winter
1946), and patriotism (The
Patriot).
Yet despite the magnificent
achievement of his great paintings
and his heroic effort in upholding
the realist tradition in a time
when meaninglessness and
absurdity have been in fashion,
there is something bothersome
about many of Wyeth's paintings.
The disturbing element can be
traced to Wyeth's frequent
depiction of zany and bizarre
characters, most clearly seen in
Garret Room.
If one takes three of the better
American realist painters of our
time — Wyeth, Edward Hopper,
and John Koch — one can find
expressed in their work three
different attitudes toward life.
Realists' Attitudes Differ
For Hopper, life is depressing
and desolate. For Koch, there is
joy and pleasure in living. In
Wyeth's work, there is a
tremendous ambiguity toward life
plus a wealth of private, highly
subjective overtones to the scenes
depicted. These Wyeth paintings
are often so subjective in meaning
that we are lost without hearing
what inspired them.
Much of Wyeth's
preoccupation with lonely winter

and autumn scenes or bizarre
persons seemed to come from
psychological attitudes which he
inherited from his father N.C.
Wyeth, the well-known illustrator.
N.C. Wyeth was
philosophically strongly disposed
toward intuitive inspiration and
psychologically wedded to a
deliberate associationalism. N.C.
Wyeth taught Andrew to think of
himself as a blank upon which
Nature painted. "[Pa] often said a
person is like a sponge; you soak
everything up and wring it out
now and then — so don't run
away from experiences."
N.C. Wyeth also ingrained in
Andrew the habit of associative
perception. Thus, Andrew Wyeth
sees heads as pumpkins, buckets
as helmets, wooden chests as
coffins. Everything is seen
metaphorically. Andrew is,
according to accounts written
about his background, still very
affected by the fantasy world of
his father's illustrations for
children's books.

Andrew's father was directly
influenced by the
transcendentalist romanticism of
Henry David Thoreau, a thinker
whom both father and son have
admired. Transcendentalism
reconfirmed the Wyeths' reliance
on intuitive inspiration, their
openness to nature, and their
conscious avoidance of any
serious speculation as to the
nature of the good life.
Here in Andrew's
anti-intellectual disposition and
his intuitive inclinations can be
found the basis of the bizarrerie
and the melancholy in his
paintings. In opening himself up
fully to his emotions without
having rationally defensible moral
guideposts, Andrew Wyeth
produces art that is moody and
ambiguous in its attitude toward
life.
On the whole, Wyeth deserves
favorable consideration. His
technical skill gives his work in
tempera, and some of that with a
dry brush, a controlled excellence.

His choice of subject matter in his
best paintings gives his work a
much more universal appeal and
meaning than is to be found in
either the so-called abstract art of
a Jackson Pollock (what is he
abstracting, anyway?) or the
crackpot realism of Roy
Lichtenstein's pop art.
Useful Catalogs
On sale, at the De Young
exhibit is a catalog containing
four useful essays on Wyeth's art.
The De Young also has the
remaining copies of the catalog
for Wyeth's show at the Whitney
in New York a few years ago and
a catalog for an exhibit on the
Brandywine heritage which
displayed three generations of
Wyeths — N.C., Andrew, and
James.
Admission to the De Young
exhibit is one dollar for adults,
fifty cents for students. On
Mondays the exhibition will be
open only to student groups and
elderly people.

are often so subjective in meaning
that we are lost without hearing
what inspired them.
Much of Wyeth's
preoccupation with lonely winter

and autumn scenes or bizarre
persons seemed to come from
psychological attitudes which he
inherited from his father N.C.
Wyeth, the well-known illustrator.
N.C. Wyeth was
philosophically strongly disposed
toward intuitive inspiration and
psychologically wedded to a
deliberate associationalism. N.C.
Wyeth taught Andrew to think of
himself as a blank upon which
Nature painted. "[Pa] often said a
person is like a sponge; you soak
everything up and wring it out
now and then — so don't run
away from experiences."
N.C. Wyeth also ingrained in
Andrew the habit of associative
perception. Thus, Andrew Wyeth
sees heads as pumpkins, buckets
as helmets, wooden chests as
coffins. Everything is seen
metaphorically. Andrew is,
according to accounts written
about his background, still very
affected by the fantasy world of
his father's illustrations for
children's books.

Andrew's father was directly
influenced by the
transcendentalist romanticism of
Henry David Thoreau, a thinker
whom both father and son have
admired. Transcendentalism
reconfirmed the Wyeths' reliance
on intuitive inspiration, their
openness to nature, and their
conscious avoidance of any
serious speculation as to the
nature of the good life.
Here in Andrew's
anti-intellectual disposition and
his intuitive inclinations can be
found the basis of the bizarrerie
and the melancholy in his
paintings. In opening himself up
fully to his emotions without
having rationally defensible moral
guideposts, Andrew Wyeth
produces art that is moody and
ambiguous in its attitude toward
life.
On the whole, Wyeth deserves
favorable consideration. His
technical skill gives his work in
tempera, and some of that with a
dry brush, a controlled excellence.

His choice of subject matter in his
best paintings gives his work a
much more universal appeal and
meaning than is to be found in
either the so-called abstract art of
a Jackson Pollock (what is he
abstracting, anyway?) or the
crackpot realism of Roy
Lichtenstein's pop art.
Useful Catalogs
On sale, at the De Young
exhibit is a catalog containing
four useful essays on Wyeth's art.
The De Young also has the
remaining copies of the catalog
for Wyeth's show at the Whitney
in New York a few years ago and
a catalog for an exhibit on the
Brandywine heritage which
displayed three generations of
Wyeths — N.C., Andrew, and
James.
Admission to the De Young
exhibit is one dollar for adults,
fifty cents for students. On
Mondays the exhibition will be
open only to student groups and
elderly people.

THE FONTEYN MYSTIQUE — Dame Margot Fonteyn, performing
with partner Heinz Bosl as a guest artist of the New London Ballet,
danced two exerpts from Swan Lake and The Sleeping Beauty in a
series of Bay Area performances last week. Bosl's fine performance
did not receive the recognition it deserved from the audience, who
seemed to be saving up most of the applause for Fonteyn.
A retrospective exhibition of
many of the major works of
Andrew Wyeth opened June 16 at
the De Young Museum in San
Francisco and will run through
September 3.
Wyeth's realistic work has
made him one of the most
admired artists in the U.S. Clear
evidence of his popularity is the
sales of prints of Wyeth paintings
like Christina's World, depicting a
woman lying in a field looking
across it to an old New England
house on the horizon.
The exhibit at the De Young
includes Christina's World and
almost every other important
Wyeth work. The several rooms
used for the exhibit house nearly
one-hundred Wyeth pieces, hung
against a background of brown
and gray, colors pervasive in
Wyeth's work.
Wyeth's art is done with three
techniques: egg-tempera,
watercolor, and dry brush. Of
these, the disciplined and
meticulous efforts in tempera are
superior. Wyeth is at his best in
this technique — abstracting and
selecting details from reality to
convey his associations, moods,
and emotions.
In his watercolors and in many
of his works with a dry brush, the
control that successfully evokes
the proper play of emotion in his
tempera is absent. The watercolor
Cider Apples, for example, comes
very close to being
non-representational art.
Wyeth's greatest paintings have

their effect on us both in
reworking and reordering the
world so that we see it in better
focus and in calling forth
emotions connected, for example,
with decay of fragile human
finery (Wind from the Sea), warm
love and admiration (Maga's
Daughter), disorientation (Winter
1946), and patriotism (The
Patriot).
Yet despite the magnificent
achievement of his great paintings
and his heroic effort in upholding
the realist tradition in a time
when meaninglessness and
absurdity have been in fashion,
there is something bothersome
about many of Wyeth's paintings.
The disturbing element can be
traced to Wyeth's frequent
depiction of zany and bizarre
characters, most clearly seen in
Garret Room.
If one takes three of the better
American realist painters of our
time — Wyeth, Edward Hopper,
and John Koch — one can find
expressed in their work three
different attitudes toward life.
Realists' Attitudes Differ
For Hopper, life is depressing
and desolate. For Koch, there is
joy and pleasure in living. In
Wyeth's work, there is a
tremendous ambiguity toward life
plus a wealth of private, highly
subjective overtones to the scenes
depicted. These Wyeth paintings
are often so subjective in meaning
that we are lost without hearing
what inspired them.

THE FONTEYN MYSTIQUE — Dame Margot Fonteyn, performing
with partner Heinz Bosl as a guest artist of the New London Ballet,
danced two exerpts from Swan Lake and The Sleeping Beauty in a
series of Bay Area performances last week. Bosl's fine performance
did not receive the recognition it deserved from the audience, who
seemed to be saving up most of the applause for Fonteyn.
A retrospective exhibition of
many of the major works of
Andrew Wyeth opened June 16 at
the De Young Museum in San
Francisco and will run through
September 3.
Wyeth's realistic work has
made him one of the most
admired artists in the U.S. Clear
evidence of his popularity is the
sales of prints of Wyeth paintings
like Christina's World, depicting a
woman lying in a field looking
across it to an old New England
house on the horizon.
The exhibit at the De Young
includes Christina's World and
almost every other important
Wyeth work. The several rooms
used for the exhibit house nearly
one-hundred Wyeth pieces, hung
against a background of brown
and gray, colors pervasive in
Wyeth's work.
Wyeth's art is done with three
techniques: egg-tempera,
watercolor, and dry brush. Of
these, the disciplined and
meticulous efforts in tempera are
superior. Wyeth is at his best in
this technique — abstracting and
selecting details from reality to
convey his associations, moods,
and emotions.
In his watercolors and in many
of his works with a dry brush, the
control that successfully evokes
the proper play of emotion in his
tempera is absent. The watercolor
Cider Apples, for example, comes
very close to being
non-representational art.
Wyeth's greatest paintings have

their effect on us both in
reworking and reordering the
world so that we see it in better
focus and in calling forth
emotions connected, for example,
with decay of fragile human
finery (Wind from the Sea), warm
love and admiration (Maga's
Daughter), disorientation (Winter
1946), and patriotism (The
Patriot).
Yet despite the magnificent
achievement of his great paintings
and his heroic effort in upholding
the realist tradition in a time
when meaninglessness and
absurdity have been in fashion,
there is something bothersome
about many of Wyeth's paintings.
The disturbing element can be
traced to Wyeth's frequent
depiction of zany and bizarre
characters, most clearly seen in
Garret Room.
If one takes three of the better
American realist painters of our
time — Wyeth, Edward Hopper,
and John Koch — one can find
expressed in their work three
different attitudes toward life.
Realists' Attitudes Differ
For Hopper, life is depressing
and desolate. For Koch, there is
joy and pleasure in living. In
Wyeth's work, there is a
tremendous ambiguity toward life
plus a wealth of private, highly
subjective overtones to the scenes
depicted. These Wyeth paintings
are often so subjective in meaning
that we are lost without hearing
what inspired them.
Much of Wyeth's
preoccupation with lonely winter

and autumn scenes or bizarre
persons seemed to come from
psychological attitudes which he
inherited from his father N.C.
Wyeth, the well-known illustrator.
N.C. Wyeth was
philosophically strongly disposed
toward intuitive inspiration and
psychologically wedded to a
deliberate associationalism. N.C.
Wyeth taught Andrew to think of
himself as a blank upon which
Nature painted. "[Pa] often said a
person is like a sponge; you soak
everything up and wring it out
now and then — so don't run
away from experiences."
N.C. Wyeth also ingrained in
Andrew the habit of associative
perception. Thus, Andrew Wyeth
sees heads as pumpkins, buckets
as helmets, wooden chests as
coffins. Everything is seen
metaphorically. Andrew is,
according to accounts written
about his background, still very
affected by the fantasy world of
his father's illustrations for
children's books.

Andrew's father was directly
influenced by the
transcendentalist romanticism of
Henry David Thoreau, a thinker
whom both father and son have
admired. Transcendentalism
reconfirmed the Wyeths' reliance
on intuitive inspiration, their
openness to nature, and their
conscious avoidance of any
serious speculation as to the
nature of the good life.
Here in Andrew's
anti-intellectual disposition and
his intuitive inclinations can be
found the basis of the bizarrerie
and the melancholy in his
paintings. In opening himself up
fully to his emotions without
having rationally defensible moral
guideposts, Andrew Wyeth
produces art that is moody and
ambiguous in its attitude toward
life.
On the whole, Wyeth deserves
favorable consideration. His
technical skill gives his work in
tempera, and some of that with a
dry brush, a controlled excellence.

His choice of subject matter in his
best paintings gives his work a
much more universal appeal and
meaning than is to be found in
either the so-called abstract art of
a Jackson Pollock (what is he
abstracting, anyway?) or the
crackpot realism of Roy
Lichtenstein's pop art.
Useful Catalogs
On sale, at the De Young
exhibit is a catalog containing
four useful essays on Wyeth's art.
The De Young also has the
remaining copies of the catalog
for Wyeth's show at the Whitney
in New York a few years ago and
a catalog for an exhibit on the
Brandywine heritage which
displayed three generations of
Wyeths — N.C., Andrew, and
James.
Admission to the De Young
exhibit is one dollar for adults,
fifty cents for students. On
Mondays the exhibition will be
open only to student groups and
elderly people.
