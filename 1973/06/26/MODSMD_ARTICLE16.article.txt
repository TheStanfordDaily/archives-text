# Fonteyn's Artistry Compensates For Technical Flaws
## Mediocre Repetoire Plagues New London Ballet 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Galima Samsova and Andre
Prokovsky reportedly started the
New London Ballet in 1971
because they wanted to explore
dance forms that were more
interesting and creative than
traditional ballet roles. If the
company's performance last
Thursday evening at Flint Center
exemplifies what they have found
interesting and creative, the New
London Ballet still has much
exploring to do.
The program was highlighted
by guest soloist Margot Fonteyn,
who displayed both the
remarkable artistic sensitivity that
once made her the world's prima
ballerina, and the waning
technical ability of a fifty year old
dancer continuing to perform long
past her prime.
The New London Ballet
consists of Samsova, Prokovsky,
and nine other soloists,
performing without a corps de
ballet. As six company members
opened the program with
Bagatelles Opus 126 set by
Prokovsky himself to the music of

Beethoven, it became apparent
that the group also performs
without a choreographer.
Prokovsky's choreography
bored the audience almost as
much as it bored the six
uninspired, unmatched dancers
who performed the 20-minute
piece. Luckily such dullness did
not pervade the entire program.
Overabundant Bravado
Company members Vesna
Butorac and Peter Mallek
compensated for occasional
unsteadiness with sheer bravado as
they handled the Don Quixote pas
de deux with an abundance of
vitality. The pair performed well
together from the airy one-handed
lifts at the outset to the zesty
coda at the finish. Mallek's
athletic leaps were well balanced
by Butorac's coquettish abandon,
but a lack of sureness in their
dancing marked each of them as a
potentially exciting performer in
need of further seasoning.
The first part of the program
concluded with the Act II pas de
deux from Swan Lake, a piece
requiring more dramatic talent

than technical virtuosity. Because
she has danced she has danced the
role of the Swan Queen for years,
Fonteyn's interpretation of the
role is understandably exquisite.
Fonteyn displays a mature
dramatic ability no young and
inexperienced ballerina can
match, but as she and Bosl
returned later in the program to
dance the pas de deux from
Aurora's wedding in Act 111 of
The Sleeping Beauty it became
apparent that she has continued
to perform dangerously far
beyond her technical prime.
Bosl defied gravity with an
unbelievable sequence of grands
jetes, while Fonteyn covered a
less-than-perfect adantino
variation with sheer dramatic
effects. The sight of a woman in
her fifties smiling her way through
the role of a young fairy-tale
princess was enough to make the
audience that half-filled Flint
Center wish they had remained at
home with those who prefer to
remember the Fonteyn of more
than a decade ago.
Yet the Fonteyn mystique
continues to attract ballet
audiences, and although her
technique suffers by comparison
with that of younger ballerinas,
the breathtaking control and
artistic maturity that marks her

dancing remain untouched by age.
Neither of the remaining two
offerings by the New London
Ballet successfully managed to
blend both the technical and
dramatic elements of the dance.
Othello, a balletic interpretation
of the Shakespearian tragedy
choreographed to the music of
Liszt by Peter Darrell especially
for the company, more closely
resembled a melodrama than a
ballet.
Tense Drama
Although the facial expressions
and expressive movements of the
dancers in Othello were
tremendously overdone, the work
seemed to ensnare the audience in
its tense dramatic spell. The
twisted contortions of Jorge
Salavisa as lago effectively
contrasted with the fragile but
substantial grace of Samsova's
Desdemona.
The Russian-born ballerina's
body became terrifyingly limp as
she was dramatically strangled by
her real-life husband Prokovsky as
Othello
While Darrell's Othello
afforded the performers too little
opportunity to display their
technical skills, Samsova's
recreation of the Laurencia pas de
six (after the Russian
choreographer Chabukiani),

brought to mind the image of a
six ring circus.
Butorac and Mallek returned to
the stage along with Prokovsky
and Samsova, and Salavisa and
Kathyryn Wade. The three
couples performed a slightly
unsynchronized triple pas de
deux, and then each dancer
received an opportunity to do his
or her own thing in a solo
variation.
It was Samsova who swept top
honors in both the ladies jumping
and turning competitions as she
literally flew across the stage with
a series of breathtaking leaps, and
made umpteen counts of zesty
fouettes appear effortless.
In the men's solo division of the
technical gymnastics meet Salavisa
proved that he is capable of much
more than the melodramatic
contortions of Darrell's Othello.
Mallek performed a well-extended
variation, while Prokovsky thrilled
the audience with an amazing set
of entrechats six.
In Othello and Laurencia, the
members of the New London
Ballet demonstrated that they
lack neither dramatic nor
technical talent. But the skilled
troupe desperately needs a better
repetoire that will display those
talents with balanced
choreography.
