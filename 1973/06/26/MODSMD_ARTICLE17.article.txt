## Roy Buchanan: Intense Blues Guitar 
### 
Jay Harlow

1 had two chances last week to
hear guitarist Roy Buchanan. In
both performances, last Monday
at the Bay Area Jazz Festival and
the previous Friday at Winterland,
he played the blues with an
emotional intensity that I had
never before experienced.
Playing an old, 50s-vintage
Fender Telecaster, with no pedals
or other fancy manipulation
devices, Buchanan just stands
there. There is none of the usual
rock-star body English involved in
his playing, just a direct
connection between him and the
strings.
He wastes no energy trying to
appear "heavy" but puts it all into
the music. The only "electric"
effects he uses are the tone and
volume knobs on the guitar,
achieving the closest sounds to
crying and moaning that 1 have
heard from any instrument. (On
the way out of the theater, 1
heard someone say that the only
reason the wah-wah pedal was
invented was because Jeff Beck
got tired of twisting the knobs on
his guitar. Buchanan's tone,
however, was much more subtle
and sensitive than can be made
with a wah-wah.)
At Winterland, Buchanan
played between the James Cotton
Blues Band and the headlining
Elwin Bishop Band, Cotton's band
opened the show without him,
doing a few instrumental numbers
with guitar, tenor sax, and
rhythm, then they were joined by
Cotton on harmonica and vocals.
Their music was an excellent
example of old Chicago-style
urban blues, with Cotton blowing
great harp licks and the audience
thoroughly enjoying it.
Showcase In Blues
Buchanan's set was a mixture
of slow blues, with his soaring
guitar solos, and some rock & roll
standards, including "Johnny B.
Goode" and "Whole Lot 0'
Shakin' Goin' On." Although his
solo work on these was interesting
and original, I felt that it was
nowhere near the showpiece of his
talent that the blues provided.
Elvin Bishop appeared with his
new band, which is noticeably
without vocalists Jo Baker and
Ross Hayashida and harpman
Ricky Kellogg. He has added
another guitarist and retained

organist Steve Miller, and is now
doing a lot more slide guitar.
Essentially, Bishop's style is the
same, playing mostly good-time
boogie music, to the delight of the
Winterland regulars. He played
some of his old songs, including
"Rock My Soul" and the
inevitable finale, "Boogie 'Til the
Rooster Crows."
On one or two numbers, the
band was joined by Gideon
Daniels, leader of the rock-gospel

group Gideon and Power, who
sang and danced and generally
added still more bouncing energy
to the show.
As a finale, the band jammed
for nearly an hour with James
Cotton. The jam session produced
quite a few memorable moments.
Buchanan's Monday
appearance was in a program
called "Guitar Explosion," part of
the Bay Area Jazz Festival. The
program at the Berkeley
Community Theater featured no
less than eight guitar acts: Mary
Osborne, Jim Hall, T-Bone
Walker, Robben Ford, Shuggie
Otis, Joe Pass & Herb Ellis, Kenny
Burrell, and Buchanan.
Mary Osborne's leadoff set was
mostly jazz standards, including

' "St. Louis Blues" and Duke
Ellington's "Take the 'A' Train."
? Jim Hall began with a long,
> wandering solo introduction and
> played a short set which was one
I of the best of the evening. His
music is gentle and understated,
> with a subtle swing to it, allowing
> room for both chord exploration
and single-note runs.
Guitar Trio Plus Harp
i T-Bone Walker, Robben Ford,
I and Shuggie Otis each came on

alone, then all three of them got
together for a few numbers.
Walker had with him a young harp
player who added considerably,
providing effective opposition to
the raspy sound of the guitar.
They played an assortment of
blues, with Walker's solo runs
alternating with crashing chords
on the choruses. Notable in this

set was his own song, "Stormy
Monday," which has become a
blues classic.
Robben Ford, a young white
blues guitarist, was next. I frankly
don't know what he was doing on
the same program with the other
guitarists. His style is frantic, like
the babblings of a speed freak,
filling every possible space with
16th and 32nd notes. The notes
are good, but there are just too
many of them, and not enough
variation in tempo, volume, or
phrasing. With some more
experience, he might be a great
guitarist.
Shuggie Otis, another young
musician, also played blues, but
with more variety. Occasionally,
his music had interesting melodic
or rhythmic passages, but in
general it seemed an uninspired
performance.
Coming Together
When the three came together,
Walker dominated the jam, which
was on one of his tunes. Ford
managed to lay back enough to
allow the others some solo space,
and Otis stood toward the back,
looking positively bored.
After an intermission, Kenny
Burrell came on. His appearance
pleased some of the older
members of the audience who
were getting tired of "these kids
playing blues." Like Hall, Burrell
played with a good deal of
subtlety and variety. He played
one Latin-style number on a
classical guitar, the only
non-electric guitar heard all night.
Staying with the classic, he began
a solo version of "Greensleeves,"
was joined by the rhythm section,
and finished up on electric.
Burrell was followed by Joe
Pass and Herb Ellis, also jazz
veterans. These two have played
togehter long enough to know
what to expect from one another,
and their show is quite polished.

Sometimes one will play chords
opposite the other's solo, and at
other times they will join in
parallel runs or free counterpoint
melodies, always knowing what
the other is doing.
Intense Performance
Buchanan had the final set.
Some of the older jazz fans left
when they saw another "kid"
(he's in his 30s) setting up, but
those who stayed heard blues
guitar that far outclassed that of
Walker, Otis, and Ford.
In a smaller house like the
Community Theater, Buchanan's
music was even more intense, and
together with his tasteful lyrics,
was so emotionally powerful that
much of the audience stayed in
their seats for a while after the
house lights came up, still
absorbing Buchanan's music.

15-16 with a new band, but his energetic music remains essentially
unchanged. The Elvin Bishop Band will perform along with
Stoneground at Marine World July 14.
