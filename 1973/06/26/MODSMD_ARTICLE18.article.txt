# Undergrads Display Photographs, Artistic Med Student Shows Batiks
## 
### 
Two undergraduates who
viewed the people of Europe
through the lens of a camera
during the summer of 1972 will
display their photographic
impressions in "La Gente" a
photo exhibit on display in the
Design Co-Op on the second floor
of Tresidder through Friday, June
29.

The photographers, senior
Richard Braunlin of Dayton,
Ohio, and junior David Madison
of Palo Alto, both received their
advanced training from Leo Holub
of the University art department.
While both men have created
photographic impressions of the
same types of subjects, each

brings a personal touch to his
work. Braunlin's photographs
emphasize action, while Madison
demonstrates a flair for contrast
and detail.

Dr. Ann G. Osborn, a resident
fellow in diagnostic radiology at
the Medical School, is also a
self-taught artist. The Hern
Gallery, at 542 Ramona Street in
Palo Alto, will display her batiks
beginning this Friday.
When she first started to
experiment with batik, following
the instructions in a "how-to"
book, she considered her artwork
as a diversion from her schedule at
the med center. The owners of the
Hern Gallery accidentally noticed
her talent when she came to the
gallery to have a batik framed as a
gift.
