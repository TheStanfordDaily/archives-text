# 'Daily' Attorneys Ask Ban On Office Search
## 
### 
Attorneys for the Daily have
resumed their efforts to obtain a
preliminary injunction barring law
enforcement officials from searching
its offices.
U.S. District Court Judge Robert F.
Peckham will hear arguments on the
motion tomorrow in San Jose.
The Daily originally sought the
injunction as part of a civil suit filed
after four Palo Alto policemen armed
with a search warrant examined the
contents of Daily desks and photo files
on April 12, 1971.
The police were looking for photos
or negatives of an April 9 melee at a
Stanford Hospital sit-in that resulted
in at least 37 injuries and 23 arrests.
They left empty-handed after 45
minutes.
Illegal Search
On Oct. 5, 1972, Peckham ruled
the search "illegal and
unconstitutional," declaring that such
searches of a newspaper office are
"impermissible in all but a very few
situations."
At that time, Peckham declined to
grant an injunction against further
searches, noting that the defendants in
the suit — including Palo Alto Police
Chief James Zurcher, Santa Clara
County Dist. Atty. Louis Bergna, and
Deputy Dist. Atty. Craig Brown — are
all "respected members of the
community" and "there is no reason
to believe that, after the declaratory
judgment concerning the April 12
incident, defendants will conduct such
a search against the plaintiffs in the
future.
"The court anticipates that this
decision will be honored and than an
injunction is unnecessary."
Psychiatric Files
However, Daily attorneys Jerome
B. Falk Jr., Law Prof. Anthony G.
Amsterdam, Robert Mnookin and
Franklin Garfield, renewed their
request for an injunction last week
after a recent incident involving
psychiatric files at the Stanford
Medical Center.
On June 1, investigators for the
District Attorney's office bearing a
search warrant arrived at the Med
Center looking for the file of Robert
Ctorfino, victim of an alleged sexual

assault by former Ravenswood (East
Palo Alto) School District official
David E. Reeves.
The warrant authorized
investigators to search the files of Med
Center staff psychiatrist Dr.
Marguerite Lederberg. Carlino
consented to the release of his file last
May 3, but Lederberg was reportedly
attempting to obtain a court hearing
on the validity of his consent when the
search was conducted.
A hospital administrator
surrendered the file to the
investigators when they presented the
warrant.
Under Subpoena
Lederberg was already under
subpoena to produce the files when
the search was conducted, according
to the paper's attorneys. She was to
appear in court with Carlino's file on
June 6; the search took place on June
1.
The Daily's motion for injunction
argues that because a search warrant
was used against the Med Center, "the
court's confidence [in the Oct. 5
decision] that an injunction is
unnecessary to prevent further
searches of the Stanford Daily is no
longer warranted.
"Plaintiffs should not have to wait
until the defendants search the offices
of the Daily again before they are
entitled to injunctive relief."
'Third Parties'
In his Oct. 5 decision, Peckham
significantly extended the rights of all
"third parties" in searches — persons
who are searched, but who are not
suspected of committing a crime.
He said that law enforcement
officials must first explore the "less
drastic" alternative of a subpoena
before seeking a search warrant against
third parties.
At the time of the original ruling,
Police Chief Zurcher indicated his
office would abide by the decision as
long as it stood.
Peckham is also currently
considering a motion by Daily
attorneys to force the defendants to
pay some $27,000 in legal fees.
Plaintiffs in the suit are the Daily
and seven current and former staff
members.
