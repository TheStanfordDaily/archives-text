House Votes To Cut All Bombing Funds
WASHINGTON—The House of Representatives yesterday approved a measure to
cut off all funds for continued U.S. bombing in Cambodia, thus joining the
Senate in a serious congressional demand that President Nixon end American
involvement in Indochina.
The measure, attached to a supplemental appropriations bill by the Senate,
now goes back to the Senate for routine ratification. Next, the bill will reauire
Nixon's signature. 4
Nixon says he will decide whether or not to approve the measure after he
discusses it will Republican congressional leaders, but according to
administration spokesmen, Nixon will veto the bill.
The veto decision presents a serious challenge to the President. If he vetoes
the measure, he will cut off funds for several federal agencies whose operating
expenses come from the bill. If he signs it, all future bombing in Cambodia will
be prohibited until Congress decides otherwise.
Sen. Thomas Eagleton (D—Mo.), author of the amendment charged that if
Nixon continues the bombing despite yesterday's congressional action he could
plunge the nation into "a constitutional impasse that could destroy the very
fabric of our system of government."
High Court Bans Parochial School Payments
WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court yesterday handed down decisions
prohibiting states from reimbursing parents for the expense of sending their
children to parochial schools, returning a school desegregation plan for Tulsa,
Okla., to a lower court for further consideration, and upholding the 1939 Hatch
Act which prohibits political activity by federal employees.
The court struck down a Nixon Administration-backed proposal to allow
states to help Catholic and other church schools by giving parents tax credits or
other tuition reimbursements, declaring the plan a violation of the First
Amendment's separation of church and state.
In a 6-3 decision, the court held that the language of a federal law forbidding
political activity by federal employees did not, in fact, discriminate against any
particular points of view. The 1939 Hatch Act had been challenged by the
American Civil Liberties Union.
Viet Negotiations, Cambodia Bombing Continues
SAlGON—Representatives from Saigon and Hanoi continued to battle at the
conference table, while in Cambodia, government troops aided by American
warplanes regained control of the vital Highway 5 near Phnom Penh yesterday.
Vietcong sources say that representatives from North and South Vietnam first
agreed, and then disagreed, on a new timetable for exchanging prisoners of war.
The talks bogged down first on release sites, and then on release dates. The
conflict will go to the joint military commission for resolution.
Meanwhile near the Cambodian capital, the country's rice highway to the
western provinces was opened for the first time in 10 days. American warplanes
supported government troops by flying support raids against rebel positions near
the capital.
Ranking POW's Face Misconduct Charges

House Votes To Cut All Bombing Funds
WASHINGTON—The House of Representatives yesterday approved a measure to
cut off all funds for continued U.S. bombing in Cambodia, thus joining the
Senate in a serious congressional demand that President Nixon end American
involvement in Indochina.
The measure, attached to a supplemental appropriations bill by the Senate,
now goes back to the Senate for routine ratification. Next, the bill will reauire
Nixon's signature. 4
Nixon says he will decide whether or not to approve the measure after he
discusses it will Republican congressional leaders, but according to
administration spokesmen, Nixon will veto the bill.
The veto decision presents a serious challenge to the President. If he vetoes
the measure, he will cut off funds for several federal agencies whose operating
expenses come from the bill. If he signs it, all future bombing in Cambodia will
be prohibited until Congress decides otherwise.
Sen. Thomas Eagleton (D—Mo.), author of the amendment charged that if
Nixon continues the bombing despite yesterday's congressional action he could
plunge the nation into "a constitutional impasse that could destroy the very
fabric of our system of government."
High Court Bans Parochial School Payments
WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court yesterday handed down decisions
prohibiting states from reimbursing parents for the expense of sending their
children to parochial schools, returning a school desegregation plan for Tulsa,
Okla., to a lower court for further consideration, and upholding the 1939 Hatch
Act which prohibits political activity by federal employees.
The court struck down a Nixon Administration-backed proposal to allow
states to help Catholic and other church schools by giving parents tax credits or
other tuition reimbursements, declaring the plan a violation of the First
Amendment's separation of church and state.
In a 6-3 decision, the court held that the language of a federal law forbidding
political activity by federal employees did not, in fact, discriminate against any
particular points of view. The 1939 Hatch Act had been challenged by the
American Civil Liberties Union.
