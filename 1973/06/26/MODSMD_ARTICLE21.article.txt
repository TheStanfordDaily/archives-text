# Teaching Merit Report Delayed
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
The Faculty Senate, in its last
meeting of the year June 14, referred
to next year's Senate a report from a
Committee on Academic Appraisal
and Achievement (C-AAA)
subcommittee on the evaluation of
teaching.
Prepared by the C-AAA
subcommittee on Evaluation of
Teaching, headed by Electrical
Engineering Prof. Gordon Kino, the
report recommends that every
University tenure appointment and
promotion should involve evaluation
of teaching ability.

The subcommittee's statement
followed a questionnaire survey and
29 interviews with department
chairmen.
Teaching Deemphasized
"Too often in the past, teaching has
been deemphasized in favor of
research," the report states.
"At present there is more emphasis
on teaching, as far as promotion and
tenure are concerned. But the
emphasis ... seems to come from
financial pressure rather than because
of a deep commitment to high quality
teaching at Stanford."

Junior faculty members should
have an opportunity at least once a
year to discuss their teaching
performance with their department
chairman or a designated senior
faculty* representative, C-AAA advises.
Other recommendations include
"systematic, on-going" evaluation of
teaching assistants with supervision by
a faculty member as well as student
evaluation of courses "at least once
every two or three times it is given."
New Major
The Fifth Senate's final actions also
included approval of a new
interdepartmental major in human
language.
Sponsored by the Committee on
Linguistics, the new major cuts across
the humanities, social and physical
sciences, and emphasizes the role of
language in man's thinking and social
behavior.
It will provide an alternative route
to advanced studies in anthropology,
communication, computer science,
education, languages, linguistics,
philosophy, and psychology.
Other Moves
In other Senate business, faculty
representatives
— authorized a reduction in the
number of voting members on the
Committee on Foreign Studies
Programs (C-FSP);
— referred the Committee of
Fifteen proposals for the revision of
the campus judicial charter to the
Sixth Senate's steering committee;
— approved the lists for the
conferring of baccalaureate and
advanced degrees awarded June 17;
— and by acclamation, adopted a
resolution honoring outgoing Senate
Chairman Mathematics Prof. Halsey L.
Royden.
