# Arbitrator Picked In Jones Case
## 
### ROBERT SIEGEL 
Eva Robbins of New York City has
bei'ii chosen to arbitrate the dispute
between W. Ron Jones, director of the
Stanford Center for Innovation and
Research in Education (SCIRE), and
James L. Gibbs, Dean of
Undergraduate Studies. Hearings are
scheduled to begin July 2.
Presently, the nature of what
Robbins will decide is unclear. Her
deliberations could center on Jones'
fitness as SCIRE's director, or on the
wider question of whether the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies or the SCIRE
Policy Board has jurisdiction over the
SCIRE director.
According to Assistant Dean of
Undergraduate Studies Michael
Closson, "The purview of the
arbitration will be decided in the
beginning (of the hearing] by the
arbiter."
Whatever the arbiter's decision,
Jones has urged the Police Board to
remain affiliated with the University
and to try to work as well as possible
with Gibbs. In April, the board had
voted to cut all ties with the
University.
Jones, however, said in a letter to
the board "it is important that SCIRE
continue at Stanford. It is not easy to
face the prospect of working with the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies, but I
think this is the only course, if the
educational philosophy of SCIRE is to
survive."
In its last meeting on June 7, the
SCIRE Policy Board discussed
techniques for maintaining Jones in an
advisory status next year if his
dismissal isn't reversed. Jones plans to
remain in the area next year.
At one point in the meeting, a
board member suggested that Jones
become a "ghost director" for SCIRE.
Board members Prof. Arthur
Schawlow and student David Flyster
each proceeded to present Jones with
one-dollar retainer fees for his on-call
advice in the coming year.
The Jones-Gibbs conflict began on
April 24 when the dean announced
that Jones' one year contract as
SCIRE director would not be renewed
beyond the June 30 expiration date.
Gibbs said Jones was being fired
because he had neglected the
administrative responsibilities
associated with his job.
Provost William Miller reviewed an
appeal by Jones and subsequently
judged that Gibbs was acting
appropriately in denying Jones a new
contract.
