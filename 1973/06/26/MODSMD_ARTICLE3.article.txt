# USE Wins NLRB Labor Election, Begins Bargaining With University
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
United Stanford Employees (USE)
has won the right to represent 1550
University employees, and is now
taking the first steps toward
negotiating a contract for those
workers.
USE won the June 6 election 660
votes to 494 favoring a "no union"
choice. The results have since been
accepted as official by the National
Labor Relations Board (NLRB).
Seventy-one percent of the 1547
eligible employees voted, a turnout

somewhat lighter than last year's,
when University workers voted against
representation by the Teamsters
Union.
USE recently affiliated with the
Service Employees International
Union (SEIU) of the AFL-CIO,
becoming SEIU local 680.
Some USE members consider this
affiliation the reason the group won
this year's election. USE garnered only
23 percent of the vote last year in a
preliminary election.
In a separate election June 6, six

meatcutters voted unanimously to be
represented by Butchers Union local
516.
The employees now represented by
USE include all regular maintenance,
custodial, laboratory support, and
food service employees, as well as
audio-visual operators, book preservers
and some computer operations
personnel.
The unit excludes the remaining
4400 University workers, including
office clerical, hospital and patient
care employees. USE has stated that it
will eventually attempt to organize
many of these workers.
USE "is certified as exclusive
bargaining representative for the group
of employees, and the employer is
required to bargain in good faith with
the union," according to a memo
distributed by Robert Augsberger, vice
president for business and finance.
Contract
Augsberger's memo breaks this
requirement into two parts. First, the
University must meet with USE to
discuss future changes in hours, wages,
and working conditions. This means
the two groups must negotiate a
contract.
Second, the University cannot
make substantial changes in the wages,
hours, or working conditions of any
member of the unit without first
consulting USE.
USE and University officials have
already begun meetings-designed to lay
the groundwork for eventual contract
negotiations.
According to USE President Glenda
Jones, issues now being discussed
include general bargaining procedure,
office space for USE, setting up a new
employee grievance procedure, and
whether all employees must join the
union.
Recruitment
While meetings with the University
take place, USE will try to recruit new
members and also decide on what
contract demands it will make to the
University. USE plans to make these
demands by September.
Questions pertaining to these two

issues sparked lively debate at a USE
membership meeting Thursday night.
One hundred members attended the
meeting, held in Bishop Auditorium.
Jim Berk, USE membership chair
man, reported at the meeting that only
400 persons in the 1550-master unit
are currently USE members. Following
his report, a resolution calling for
SEIU to send "more than one"
organizer to the campus passed after
much argument.
During this discussion, one USE
member asked, "If we're members of
AFL-CIO, why can't we get their
help?", a statement which was greeted
with boisterous applause.
The USE leadership tried to
reassure the members that USE will
indeed receive outside help-
A second stormy debate took place
on the question of whether USE
members who are not part of the
officially-recognized unit should be
allowed to vote on issues such as the
composition of the committee USE
has set up to formulate contract
demands. About 150 USE members,
including Berk, hold jobs not officially
represented by the union.
After some argument, it was
decided by a 22-15 vote that all USE
members will be allowed to vote on
procedural issues.

required to bargain in good faith with
the union," according to a memo
distributed by Robert Augsberger, vice
president for business and finance.
Contract
Augsberger's memo breaks this
requirement into two parts. First, the
University must meet with USE to
discuss future changes in hours, wages,
and working conditions. This means
the two groups must negotiate a
contract.
Second, the University cannot
make substantial changes in the wages,
hours, or working conditions of any
member of the unit without first
consulting USE.
USE and University officials have
already begun meetings-designed to lay
the groundwork for eventual contract
negotiations.
According to USE President Glenda
Jones, issues now being discussed
include general bargaining procedure,
office space for USE, setting up a new
employee grievance procedure, and
whether all employees must join the
union.
Recruitment
While meetings with the University
take place, USE will try to recruit new
members and also decide on what
contract demands it will make to the
University. USE plans to make these
demands by September.
Questions pertaining to these two

issues sparked lively debate at a USE
membership meeting Thursday night.
One hundred members attended the
meeting, held in Bishop Auditorium.
Jim Berk, USE membership chair
man, reported at the meeting that only
400 persons in the 1550-master unit
are currently USE members. Following
his report, a resolution calling for
SEIU to send "more than one"
organizer to the campus passed after
much argument.
During this discussion, one USE
member asked, "If we're members of
AFL-CIO, why can't we get their
help?", a statement which was greeted
with boisterous applause.
The USE leadership tried to
reassure the members that USE will
indeed receive outside help-
A second stormy debate took place
on the question of whether USE
members who are not part of the
officially-recognized unit should be
allowed to vote on issues such as the
composition of the committee USE
has set up to formulate contract
demands. About 150 USE members,
including Berk, hold jobs not officially
represented by the union.
After some argument, it was
decided by a 22-15 vote that all USE
members will be allowed to vote on
procedural issues.
United Stanford Employees (USE)
has won the right to represent 1550
University employees, and is now
taking the first steps toward
negotiating a contract for those
workers.
USE won the June 6 election 660
votes to 494 favoring a "no union"
choice. The results have since been
accepted as official by the National
Labor Relations Board (NLRB).
Seventy-one percent of the 1547
eligible employees voted, a turnout

somewhat lighter than last year's,
when University workers voted against
representation by the Teamsters
Union.
USE recently affiliated with the
Service Employees International
Union (SEIU) of the AFL-CIO,
becoming SEIU local 680.
Some USE members consider this
affiliation the reason the group won
this year's election. USE garnered only
23 percent of the vote last year in a
preliminary election.
In a separate election June 6, six

meatcutters voted unanimously to be
represented by Butchers Union local
516.
The employees now represented by
USE include all regular maintenance,
custodial, laboratory support, and
food service employees, as well as
audio-visual operators, book preservers
and some computer operations
personnel.
The unit excludes the remaining
4400 University workers, including
office clerical, hospital and patient
care employees. USE has stated that it
will eventually attempt to organize
many of these workers.
USE "is certified as exclusive
bargaining representative for the group
of employees, and the employer is
required to bargain in good faith with
the union," according to a memo
distributed by Robert Augsberger, vice
president for business and finance.
