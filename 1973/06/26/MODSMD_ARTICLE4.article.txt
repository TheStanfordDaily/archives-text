# Stanford Wins First NCAA Tennis Crown
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Stanford won its first NCAA tennis
championship in history Saturday,
climaxing Coach Dick Gould's
seven-year drive for national
supremacy.
The Cardinals' four singles players
and two doubles teams garnered 33
wins during the six-day tournament at
Princeton, N.J. Pacific Eight rivals
Southern California and UCLA
finished second and third with 28 and
24 wins, respectively.
Alex "Sandy" Mayer, a junior from
Wayne, N.J., won the NCAA singles
title, and also teamed with Sbphomore
Jim Delaney to capture the doubles
crown. Thus, Stanford took home all
three first-place trophies.
Ramirez
Mayer won the singles title by
beating archrival Raul Ramirez of
USC, 6-3, 6-1, 6-4, in the finals. Mayer
had been seeded first in the
tournament, with Ramirez second.
Previously, Ramirez singlehandedly
kept USC in contention, beating
Delaney in the quarterfinals and
Stanford senior Rick Fisher in the
semifinals.
Fisher surprised the experts who
seeded him fourteenth in the tourney
by reaching the semifinals. Fisher,
Mayer, and Delaney were all named to

the 1973 All-American squad.
Unseeded
The fourth singles entry for the
Cards, freshman Pat DuPre, was not
seeded and lost to UCLA's Bob Kreiss
in the fourth round. Kreiss went on to
reach the semifinals before losing to
Mayer 4-6, 7-6, 6-3, in what was
probably the best-played match of the
tournament.
In doubles, Mayer-Delaney won the
title despite having played together for
only two months. They bested North
Carolina's Fred McNair-Richard
McKee 6-3, 6-3, 5-7, 6-3 in the finals.
McNair-McKee knocked out USC's
first-seeded team of Ramirez-Mike
Machette in the semifinals. The
Southern Cal duo had eliminated
Stanford's other doubles team,
Fisher-Gery Groslimond, in the
quarterfinals.
'Deserved Title'
An elated Gould said he was
surprised by his team's first-place
finish, as the initial pairings "pretty
much relegated us to third place. But
our kids really deserved the title; we
played really well under pressure."

as the NCAA champ. Last year the
Cards were second in the NCAA, with
Mayer teamed with Roscoe Tanner to
win the doubles title.

as the NCAA champ. Last year the
Cards were second in the NCAA, with
Mayer teamed with Roscoe Tanner to
win the doubles title.
Stanford won its first NCAA tennis
championship in history Saturday,
climaxing Coach Dick Gould's
seven-year drive for national
supremacy.
The Cardinals' four singles players
and two doubles teams garnered 33
wins during the six-day tournament at
Princeton, N.J. Pacific Eight rivals
Southern California and UCLA
finished second and third with 28 and
24 wins, respectively.
Alex "Sandy" Mayer, a junior from
Wayne, N.J., won the NCAA singles
title, and also teamed with Sbphomore
Jim Delaney to capture the doubles
crown. Thus, Stanford took home all
three first-place trophies.
Ramirez
Mayer won the singles title by
beating archrival Raul Ramirez of
USC, 6-3, 6-1, 6-4, in the finals. Mayer
had been seeded first in the
tournament, with Ramirez second.
Previously, Ramirez singlehandedly
kept USC in contention, beating
Delaney in the quarterfinals and
Stanford senior Rick Fisher in the
semifinals.
Fisher surprised the experts who
seeded him fourteenth in the tourney
by reaching the semifinals. Fisher,
Mayer, and Delaney were all named to

the 1973 All-American squad.
Unseeded
The fourth singles entry for the
Cards, freshman Pat DuPre, was not
seeded and lost to UCLA's Bob Kreiss
in the fourth round. Kreiss went on to
reach the semifinals before losing to
Mayer 4-6, 7-6, 6-3, in what was
probably the best-played match of the
tournament.
In doubles, Mayer-Delaney won the
title despite having played together for
only two months. They bested North
Carolina's Fred McNair-Richard
McKee 6-3, 6-3, 5-7, 6-3 in the finals.
McNair-McKee knocked out USC's
first-seeded team of Ramirez-Mike
Machette in the semifinals. The
Southern Cal duo had eliminated
Stanford's other doubles team,
Fisher-Gery Groslimond, in the
quarterfinals.
'Deserved Title'
An elated Gould said he was
surprised by his team's first-place
finish, as the initial pairings "pretty
much relegated us to third place. But
our kids really deserved the title; we
played really well under pressure."
Stanford dethrones iVinity (Texas)
as the NCAA champ. Last year the
Cards were second in the NCAA, with
Mayer teamed with Roscoe Tanner to
win the doubles title.
