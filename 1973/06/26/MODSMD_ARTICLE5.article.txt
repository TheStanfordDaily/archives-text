# USE Challenges TDS Move
## 
### 
United Stanford Employees (USE)
has announced it has filed charges with
the National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) against Toute de Suite, Inc.
(TDS), which took over management
of Tresidder food services Thursday.
USE's charges stem from the refusal
of TDS to accept the union as the
official representative of Tresidder's
41 food service employees.
The 41 workers in question worked
for the University until Thursday, but
are now officially employees of TDS.
Bargaining Agent
USE claims that since the 41 were
among those University employees
who voted for union representation on
June 6, "as successor employer TDS is
required to recognize USE as
bargaining agent for these workers."
TDS officials declined to comment
on the matter. According to USE, TDS
stated that USE "was not the
recognized bargaining agent for
Tresidder workers, and that TDS
would recognize USE only through an
NLRB election, in addition to the one
just completed on June 6."
TDS President Skip Mclntyre
emphasized yesterday that "we are an
employee-oriented corporation," and
that no food services worker had been
laid off, nor are any lay-offs planned.
"We're going to take very good care of
our career employees," Mclntyre said.
Student Labor
In the future, Mclntyre added,
students will be hired to fill Tresidder
openings whenever possible. The
company plans to work closely with
the financial aids office in hiring
students.
Since taking over the
financially-troubled Tresidder
operation, TDS has made no major

changes, and plans none until
feasibility studies are completed. No
price increases are being contemplated.
However, Mclntyre stressed that his
company, immediately upon taking
over the cafeteria, made a "thrust in
the area of equipment maintenance.
There were some things badly in need
of repair, which we have 99 percent
taken care of. Some things could have
been considered safety hazards."
In addition to the Tresidder
cafeteria, TDS also supplies the Coffee
House with certain foodstuffs which

are cheaper to buy in bulk quantities.
The Coffee House is now closed for
remodeling, and plans to officially
reopen next Monday, although an
"unofficial" opening Thursday or
Friday seems likely.
According to John Loom is, who is
coordinating student labor at the
Coffee House, the remodeling process
is proceeding well, but slightly behind
schedule because student labor is being
used wherever possible, and"it takes a
little while for students to learn how
to do things."

CLOSED FOR REMODELING—Debris lines the walls of the Stanford Community Coffee House. The familiar
University hang-out has been closed since June 1 as workmen remodel and enlarge it. Although it is officially scheduled
to reopen next Monday, an unofficial "sneak preview" Thursday or Friday has been hinted.
