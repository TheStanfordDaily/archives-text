# University Moves In Franklin Suit
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
University lawyers have asked Santa
I Clara County Superior Court Judge
Joseph P. Kelly to reconsider his May
24 ruling that fired English Assoc.
Prof. H. Bruce Franklin is entitled to a
full trial in his suit to win
reinstatement.
Kelly will hear arguments July 12
on the motion to reconsider.
The motion is seen as the first step
in a University effort to have the
ruling reviewed by a higher court.
Attorney David Heilbron noted that
"it is well to seek reconsideration
here" at the Superior Court level
before filing an appeal.
The University had originally
moved for a decision in the case based
on the proceedings of the faculty
Advisory Board, the seven-member
body that voted to dismiss Franklin in
January, 1972 for his part in allegedly
instigating campus disruptions 11
months earlier.
'Plenary Trial'
Kelly denied that motion and
directed that Franklin receive "a
plenary trial of the facts," without
deciding on the validity of the
Advisory Board hearing process.
Heilbron's motion declared that
Kelly's decision "is contrary to those
applicable authorities, is in error, and
is beyond the jurisdiction of the
Court."
Hsilbron claimed that Kelly lacked
adequate information on which to
base his decision, and that "it would
be a great imposition on the Court and
the parties and an enormous waste of
time and money" if the matter were to
go to trial despite the Advisory Board
record.
Faculty Discipline
"The Court's decision strikes a hard
blow at faculty self discipline in
private colleges," Heilbron also
contends. The University promulgated
a new faculty discipline plan last year,
partly as an outgrowth of the Franklin
proceedings.
Franklin said yesterday that the
University is "scared stiff" of going

into a full trial in the case. He said the
University is afraid a trial will show
that the University is in fact a
"government agency," entitling
University employees to the same
constitutional protections of public
employees.
He said his case would bring out
supposed FBI and CIA connections
with Stanford to support the argument
that the University is an instrument of
the government.
'Worse Than Nonsense'
"The First Amendment is what the
issue rally is," Franklin declared.
"Their interpretation [of the law] is
worse than nonsense ... it makes the
First Amendment meaningless."
On Jan. 5, 1972, the Advisory
Board recommended Franklin's
dismissal by a 5-2 vote. His
reinstatement suit was filed last Aug.
15.
Franklin is a member of the central
committee of Venceremos, the
Peninsula-based Maoist organization.
