## Just The Beginning 
### 
A new era has begun in labor relations at Stanford, as, for the first
time, a sizable number of University employees are now represented
by a union. The Daily welcomes the June 6 victory of United
Stanford Employees, but recognizes that this is only one step toward
the ultimate goal of assuring fairness to all members of the University
community.
USE's victory means that the group, which is affiliated with the
Service Employees International Union of the AFL-CIO, now has the
power to negotiate a contract for some 1550 workers with the
University for such things as higher wages, better job security, and
increased fringe benefits. But USE must use this power wisely.
The union must act responsibly. For example, it must not
constantly hold the threat of a strike over the University's head. Such
a threat might net the employees a few more dollars, but would
destroy the special labor-management relationship at Stanford, a
relationship that is much more personal, and friendly, than in the
world of big business and big labor.
The University also has a responsibility to bargain in good faith
with USE. It cannot continue to represent only its own financial
interest—an interest that seeks to give its workers as little as possible.
University officials must recognize that Stanford is more than just a
business operation; it is an institution of enlightenment which must
take an enlightened attitude toward the needs of all members of the
community—including its employees.
