In an Oct. 19, 1972 editorial on bicycle safety, the Daily noted
that "enforcement [of laws against reckless bicyclists] has been
noticeably lacking, and the threat of serious injury and death is
terrifyingly real." At that time, we asked campus law officers to begin
enforcing the laws so long ignored, and asked the University to launch
a study of the bike problem on campus.
Shortly after midnight on June 5, two bikes collided on Escondido
Road between Wilbur and Stern Halls. Neither bike had lights, and
one cyclist, Robert M. Steele, was apparently riding down the wrong
side of the road at a high rate of speed. Steel was thrown from his
bike and sustained massive head injuries. He died two days later.
Perhaps Steele's death was preventable; perhaps it wasn't. But
unless campus riders begin exercising a degree of caution and common
sense, and unless the officers start enforcing the law, it is only a
matter of time until the next accident. Will it take another fatality to
get any action?
