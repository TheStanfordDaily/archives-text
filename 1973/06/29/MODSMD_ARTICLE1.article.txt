# Dean Ends Four-Day Testimony As White House Counterattacks
## 
### DOYLE McMANUS Special to the Daily 
WASHINGTON - Former Presidential
counsel John W. Dean 111 closed out
his fourth day of testimony before the
Senate Watergate Committee
yesterday by reaffirming that he is
"sure" President Nixon knew about
the effort to cover up the June 17,
1972 break-in from the very
beginning.
Dean repeated his account of a
Sept. 15, 1972 conversation with the
President about the cover-up, and told
of reporting from June 17 on to
former Presidential aides H.R.
Haldeman and John Ehrlichman on
the progress of the cover-up.
"Mr. Haldeman took notes during
these meetings and met daily with the
President," Dean said. "It was my
assumption without questioning that
this was going to the President."
In response to close questioning by
Sen. Joseph Montoya (D-N.M.), Dean
said he believed the President was
directly involved in the cover-up from
the day of the burglary.
"I'm sure of this," he said. "There
were press releases put out within a
short time after the incident ....
There must have been discussions in
Florida — they [President Nixon,
Haldeman and Ehrlichman] were in
Florida — about how to handle it."
Dean admitted, however, that his
knowledge of the June "discussions"
was only by inference.
Also yesterday, Sen. Lowell
Weicker (R-Conn.), a member of the
Senate committee, accused former
Presidential assistant Charles Colson of
spreading false information about
campaign funding in Weicker's 1970
campaign.
Weicker read the committee the
transcript of a telephone conversation
between then-U.S. Atty. Gen. John
Mitchell and Colson, in which Mitchell
accused Weicker of "political
sabotage" and suggested that some
action against him be considered.
On Wednesday, Dean's account of
his September meeting with Nixon
drew heavy fire from Sen. Edward J.

Gurney (R-Fla.). When questioned,
Dean conceded he had told Nixon
virtually nothing specific about the
cover-up.
"Well now, how can you say the
President knew all about these things
from the simple observation by him
that 'Bob tells me you are doing a
good job,"?" Gurney demanded.
Dean accused Gumey of "quibbling
over words," but Gurney concluded
that "there isn't a single shred of
evidence that came out of this
meeting" that Nixon knew of the
cover-up at that time.
No Surprises
Yesterday's testimony held no real
surprises, and little new information
was revealed.
It has, however, been a difficult
four days for John Dean and for the
Senate Watergate investigators. The
week began with Dean's 245-page
opening statement — which he read in
full in a mind-numbing six-hour
session Monday.
Tuesday saw Dean defend his
credibility, and the release of White
House classified papers that support
President Nixon's May 22 claim that a
domestic security plan authorizing
burglaries and illegal wiretaps was
never formally implemented.
And on Wednesday, the White
House counterattacked with a series
of questions delivered to Sen. Daniel

Inouye (D-Hawaii) and a 12-page
memo that named Dean and former
Atty. Gen. Mitchell as those
responsible for the Watergate burglary
and cover-up.
"There is no reason to doubt," the
White House memo said, "that John
Dean was the principal actor in the
Watergate cover-up, and that while
other motivations may have played a
part, he had great interest in covering
up for himself."
The memo claimed that President
Nixon "had barely known Dean," and
criticized Dean's "increasingly shrill
efforts ... to save himself by striking
out recklessly at others."
Wednesday's hearings also saw the
release by Dean of White House lists of
hundreds of political opponents,
including a special list for a formal
"enemies project" involving secret
reprisals against some 20 persons. The
covering memorandum, dated Aug. 16,
1971 and authored by Dean, is
entitled "Dealing with Our Political
Enemies," and states:
'Screw' Enemies
''This memorandum
addresses .. . how we can use the
available federal machinery to screw
our political enemies."
The project, as described in the
memo, entailed gathering information
from White House staff members "as
to who they feel we should be giving a

hard time," and then planning and
implementing harassment through
influence over "grant availability,
federal contracts, litigation,
prosecution, etc."
Included in the lists submitted by
Dean was one roster of about 200
prominent names, including senators,
congressmen, reporters, newspaper
columnists, labor leaders, businessmen,
celebrities, and "academics."
Dean also submitted a high-priority
"enemy list" of about 20 persons,
including Morton Halperin, a former
aide to Henry Kissinger; Daniel Schorr
of CBS News; Rep. Ronald V. Dellums
(D-Berkeley); Leonard Woodcock,
president of the United Auto Workers;
and actor Paul Newman.
Hearings continue with Dean still
on the stand at 10 a.m. EDT today (7
a.m. PDT), and will be carried live by
KZSU, 90.1 FM. The committee will
recess the week of July 4, and will
reconvene Monday, July 9, when
former Atty. Gen. Mitchell is
scheduled to appear.

Nixon "had barely known Dean," and
criticized Dean's "increasingly shrill
efforts ... to save himself by striking
out recklessly at others."
Wednesday's hearings also saw the
release by Dean of White House lists of
hundreds of political opponents,
including a special list for a formal
"enemies project" involving secret
reprisals against some 20 persons. The
covering memorandum, dated Aug. 16,
1971 and authored by Dean, is
entitled "Dealing with Our Political
Enemies," and states:
'Screw' Enemies
''This memorandum
addresses .. . how we can use the
available federal machinery to screw
our political enemies."
The project, as described in the
memo, entailed gathering information
from White House staff members "as
to who they feel we should be giving a

hard time," and then planning and
implementing harassment through
influence over "grant availability,
federal contracts, litigation,
prosecution, etc."
Included in the lists submitted by
Dean was one roster of about 200
prominent names, including senators,
congressmen, reporters, newspaper
columnists, labor leaders, businessmen,
celebrities, and "academics."
Dean also submitted a high-priority
"enemy list" of about 20 persons,
including Morton Halperin, a former
aide to Henry Kissinger; Daniel Schorr
of CBS News; Rep. Ronald V. Dellums
(D-Berkeley); Leonard Woodcock,
president of the United Auto Workers;
and actor Paul Newman.
Hearings continue with Dean still
on the stand at 10 a.m. EDT today (7
a.m. PDT), and will be carried live by
KZSU, 90.1 FM. The committee will
recess the week of July 4, and will
reconvene Monday, July 9, when
former Atty. Gen. Mitchell is
scheduled to appear.

WASHINGTON - Former Presidential
counsel John W. Dean 111 closed out
his fourth day of testimony before the
Senate Watergate Committee
yesterday by reaffirming that he is
"sure" President Nixon knew about
the effort to cover up the June 17,
1972 break-in from the very
beginning.
Dean repeated his account of a
Sept. 15, 1972 conversation with the
President about the cover-up, and told
of reporting from June 17 on to
former Presidential aides H.R.
Haldeman and John Ehrlichman on
the progress of the cover-up.
"Mr. Haldeman took notes during
these meetings and met daily with the
President," Dean said. "It was my
assumption without questioning that
this was going to the President."
In response to close questioning by
Sen. Joseph Montoya (D-N.M.), Dean
said he believed the President was
directly involved in the cover-up from
the day of the burglary.
"I'm sure of this," he said. "There
were press releases put out within a
short time after the incident ....
There must have been discussions in
Florida — they [President Nixon,
Haldeman and Ehrlichman] were in
Florida — about how to handle it."
Dean admitted, however, that his
knowledge of the June "discussions"
was only by inference.
Also yesterday, Sen. Lowell
Weicker (R-Conn.), a member of the
Senate committee, accused former
Presidential assistant Charles Colson of
spreading false information about
campaign funding in Weicker's 1970
campaign.
Weicker read the committee the
transcript of a telephone conversation
between then-U.S. Atty. Gen. John
Mitchell and Colson, in which Mitchell
accused Weicker of "political
sabotage" and suggested that some
action against him be considered.
On Wednesday, Dean's account of
his September meeting with Nixon
drew heavy fire from Sen. Edward J.

Gurney (R-Fla.). When questioned,
Dean conceded he had told Nixon
virtually nothing specific about the
cover-up.
"Well now, how can you say the
President knew all about these things
from the simple observation by him
that 'Bob tells me you are doing a
good job,"?" Gurney demanded.
Dean accused Gumey of "quibbling
over words," but Gurney concluded
that "there isn't a single shred of
evidence that came out of this
meeting" that Nixon knew of the
cover-up at that time.
No Surprises
Yesterday's testimony held no real
surprises, and little new information
was revealed.
It has, however, been a difficult
four days for John Dean and for the
Senate Watergate investigators. The
week began with Dean's 245-page
opening statement — which he read in
full in a mind-numbing six-hour
session Monday.
Tuesday saw Dean defend his
credibility, and the release of White
House classified papers that support
President Nixon's May 22 claim that a
domestic security plan authorizing
burglaries and illegal wiretaps was
never formally implemented.
And on Wednesday, the White
House counterattacked with a series
of questions delivered to Sen. Daniel

Inouye (D-Hawaii) and a 12-page
memo that named Dean and former
Atty. Gen. Mitchell as those
responsible for the Watergate burglary
and cover-up.
"There is no reason to doubt," the
White House memo said, "that John
Dean was the principal actor in the
Watergate cover-up, and that while
other motivations may have played a
part, he had great interest in covering
up for himself."
The memo claimed that President
Nixon "had barely known Dean," and

Mitchell and Colson, in which Mitchell
accused Weicker of "political
sabotage" and suggested that some
action against him be considered.
On Wednesday, Dean's account of
his September meeting with Nixon
drew heavy fire from Sen. Edward J.

Gurney (R-Fla.). When questioned,
Dean conceded he had told Nixon
virtually nothing specific about the
cover-up.
"Well now, how can you say the
President knew all about these things
from the simple observation by him
that 'Bob tells me you are doing a
good job,"?" Gurney demanded.
Dean accused Gumey of "quibbling
over words," but Gurney concluded
that "there isn't a single shred of
evidence that came out of this
meeting" that Nixon knew of the
cover-up at that time.
No Surprises
Yesterday's testimony held no real
surprises, and little new information
was revealed.
It has, however, been a difficult
four days for John Dean and for the
Senate Watergate investigators. The
week began with Dean's 245-page
opening statement — which he read in
full in a mind-numbing six-hour
session Monday.
Tuesday saw Dean defend his
credibility, and the release of White
House classified papers that support
President Nixon's May 22 claim that a
domestic security plan authorizing
burglaries and illegal wiretaps was
never formally implemented.
And on Wednesday, the White
House counterattacked with a series
of questions delivered to Sen. Daniel

Inouye (D-Hawaii) and a 12-page
memo that named Dean and former
Atty. Gen. Mitchell as those
responsible for the Watergate burglary
and cover-up.
"There is no reason to doubt," the
White House memo said, "that John
Dean was the principal actor in the
Watergate cover-up, and that while
other motivations may have played a
part, he had great interest in covering
up for himself."
The memo claimed that President
Nixon "had barely known Dean," and
criticized Dean's "increasingly shrill
efforts ... to save himself by striking
out recklessly at others."
Wednesday's hearings also saw the
release by Dean of White House lists of
hundreds of political opponents,
including a special list for a formal
"enemies project" involving secret
reprisals against some 20 persons. The
covering memorandum, dated Aug. 16,
1971 and authored by Dean, is
entitled "Dealing with Our Political
Enemies," and states:
'Screw' Enemies
''This memorandum
addresses .. . how we can use the
available federal machinery to screw
our political enemies."
The project, as described in the
memo, entailed gathering information
from White House staff members "as
to who they feel we should be giving a

hard time," and then planning and
implementing harassment through
influence over "grant availability,
federal contracts, litigation,
prosecution, etc."
Included in the lists submitted by
Dean was one roster of about 200
prominent names, including senators,
congressmen, reporters, newspaper
columnists, labor leaders, businessmen,
celebrities, and "academics."
Dean also submitted a high-priority
"enemy list" of about 20 persons,
including Morton Halperin, a former
aide to Henry Kissinger; Daniel Schorr
of CBS News; Rep. Ronald V. Dellums
(D-Berkeley); Leonard Woodcock,
president of the United Auto Workers;
and actor Paul Newman.
Hearings continue with Dean still
on the stand at 10 a.m. EDT today (7
a.m. PDT), and will be carried live by
KZSU, 90.1 FM. The committee will
recess the week of July 4, and will
reconvene Monday, July 9, when
former Atty. Gen. Mitchell is
scheduled to appear.

WASHINGTON - Former Presidential
counsel John W. Dean 111 closed out
his fourth day of testimony before the
Senate Watergate Committee
yesterday by reaffirming that he is
"sure" President Nixon knew about
the effort to cover up the June 17,
1972 break-in from the very
beginning.
Dean repeated his account of a
Sept. 15, 1972 conversation with the
President about the cover-up, and told
of reporting from June 17 on to
former Presidential aides H.R.
Haldeman and John Ehrlichman on
the progress of the cover-up.
"Mr. Haldeman took notes during
these meetings and met daily with the
President," Dean said. "It was my
assumption without questioning that
this was going to the President."
In response to close questioning by
Sen. Joseph Montoya (D-N.M.), Dean
said he believed the President was
directly involved in the cover-up from
the day of the burglary.
"I'm sure of this," he said. "There
were press releases put out within a
short time after the incident ....
There must have been discussions in
Florida — they [President Nixon,
Haldeman and Ehrlichman] were in
Florida — about how to handle it."
Dean admitted, however, that his
knowledge of the June "discussions"
was only by inference.
Also yesterday, Sen. Lowell
Weicker (R-Conn.), a member of the
Senate committee, accused former
Presidential assistant Charles Colson of
spreading false information about
campaign funding in Weicker's 1970
campaign.
Weicker read the committee the
transcript of a telephone conversation
between then-U.S. Atty. Gen. John
Mitchell and Colson, in which Mitchell
accused Weicker of "political
sabotage" and suggested that some
action against him be considered.
