# Cold War Origins
## Maddox Attacks Revisionism

Left and the Origins of the Cold
War (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton
University Press, 1973), 169
pages, $7.95.
Beginning earlier, but achieving
increased recognition in the
mid-19605, new "revisionist"
interpretations of the origins of
the Cold War have upset what had
been the accepted account.
The essence of historical
revisionism, whether on the First
World War or Vietnam, and the
source of its political impact is to
be found in its close and critical
examination of official accounts
and official propaganda. Because
all history situates us at the end of
a chain of events, it provides us
with a concrete, empirical basis on
which to act in accord with our
values. Thus new historical
evidence and explanations which
are in important disagreement
with the official statements of
decision-makers have direct
political consequences.
After the Second World War,
the Rockefeller Foundation and
the Council on Foreign Relations
instituted a program of subsidized
scholarship in order to head off
the development of revisionism in
the writing of the war's history.
Knowing their record of
interest in such matters, it is no
surprise that similar influential
groups are applauding and
promoting this new
anti-revisionist book by Robert
James Maddox.
In appraising Maddox's book as
a piece of scholarship, two
difficulties became immediately
apparent. First, the book is not a
full scale anti-revisionist account
of the period like John Lewis
Gaddis' new and unsatisfactory
United States and the Origins of
the Cold War. Second, Maddox is
not providing a critique of the
causal theories of revisionists, as
Robert W. Tucker does in his
often excellent Radical Left and
American Foriegn Policy.
Footnotes
Instead, what Maddox provides
is an examination of a few of the
footnotes found on a few pages
and covering the short time
between the Yalta and Potsdam
conferences in 1945 in seven

books by revisionist historians
(William Appleman Williams, D.F.
Fleming, Gar Alperovitz, David
Horowitz, Gabriel Kolko, Diane
Shaver Clemens, and Lloyd C.
Gardner).
The conclusion which Maddox
draws after checking these
footnotes is "that these books
without exception are based upon
pervasive misusages of the source
materials."
To determine whether Maddox
is right we can turn to published
government documents and then
compare Maddox's description of
them with the revisionists'. We
can also read Alperovitz's reply to
Maddox in the March 1973
Journal of American History, the
replies of the seven revisionists
published in the June 17 New
York Times Book Review, and the
lengthy mimeographed replies
obtainable on request from
Kolko, Horowitz, and Gardner.
Not Pro-Moscow
The first type of error that
Maddox makes is implying that
Horowitz and Kolko are
pro-Moscow. On the contrary,
Horowitz has long been
influenced by Issac Deutscher's
Trotskyist views, and Kolko
considers the Soviet Union like
Britain and the U.S. to be an
imperial power "less concerned
with democratic politics than
friendly nations."
In fact, the remarkable thing
about Kolko's chapter on Yalta is
not what Maddox thinks he finds
in it. It is rather, as Robert D.
Schulzinger has noted, that
Kolko's description of the great
powers' cynical disregard at Yalta
for the rights of the peoples of
small nations is similar to the
contemporary complaints of
Robert Taft, John Bricker, and
Westbrook Pegler about Yalta's
secret diplomacy.
A second sort of error that
Maddox makes is in dropping the
over-all political context of
American diplomacy. For
example, in his treatment of
Horowitz and Kolko on the Polish
question, Maddox fails to weigh
correctly the extent to which
American decision-makers saw
Poland in terms of U.S.-Soviet
relations.
Finally, Maddox simply makes
factual errors. He misconstrues
the question of admitting
Argentina to the United Nations
in criticizing Horowitz. He
distorts, in attacking Williams,
Alperovitz, Kolko, and Garder,
the attitude of American
policy-makers toward the
conditions for foreign aid to
Russia after World War 11. He
misrepresents the de facto
situation on Poland's western

border in attacking Kolko.
But these are not new errors on
Maddox's part. They can be found
in an exchange of letters in the
May 18, 1972 New York Review
of Books, in which Ronald Steel
corrected Maddox's mistakes.
Most important of all in
assessing Maddox's work is the
question of whether he zeroes in
on footnotes that materially
damage the thesis of any book he
is criticizing.
The first problem is that
Maddox often misunderstands or
distorts the thesis of a book when
he is attacking it. He certainly
does not accurately convey the
central contention of William
Appleman Williams about the
Open Door ideology.
Maddox describes Horowitz as
finding a radical dichotomy
between the foreign policies of
Roosevelt and Truman, whereas
Horowitz's considered such
changes only stylistic. Horowitz's
real point was that the postwar
power distribution left most
important decisions in U.S. hands.
Key Point Not Faced
The second problem is that
Maddox does not confront the
revisionists by picking footnotes
essential to their theses. In the
case of Alperovitz, for example,
Maddox does not face
Alperovitz's key argument that
the possession of the atomic
bomb by the U.S. was the major
reason for a policy shift toward
Russian in the middle months of
1945.
Useful critiques of Alperovitz's
view can really only be found in
the work of other revisionists like
Kolko and Anton Theoharis.
Despite the obvious weakness
of Maddox's work, it has been
promoted by historians like the
late Herbert Feis (one-time State
Department economic
policy-maker), George Kennan
(another State Department
official and original formulator of
the containment doctrine), Arthur
Schlesinger, Jr. (adviser to
President Kennedy), and Eugene
V. Rostow (Under Secretary of
State under Kennedy).
I think, however, that the only
objective evaluation that one can
make of Maddox's book is that it
is a poor job. Under close
scrutiny, the book falls apart.
Reconsidering the origins of the
Cold War after having had the
dubious benefit of Maddox's
contribution, one can only
conclude that the revisionists have
made an important and probably
lasting contribution to our
understanding of what really
happened.

assessing Maddox's work is the
question of whether he zeroes in
on footnotes that materially
damage the thesis of any book he
is criticizing.
The first problem is that
Maddox often misunderstands or
distorts the thesis of a book when
he is attacking it. He certainly
does not accurately convey the
central contention of William
Appleman Williams about the
Open Door ideology.
Maddox describes Horowitz as
finding a radical dichotomy
between the foreign policies of
Roosevelt and Truman, whereas
Horowitz's considered such
changes only stylistic. Horowitz's
real point was that the postwar
power distribution left most
important decisions in U.S. hands.
Key Point Not Faced
The second problem is that
Maddox does not confront the
revisionists by picking footnotes
essential to their theses. In the
case of Alperovitz, for example,
Maddox does not face
Alperovitz's key argument that
the possession of the atomic
bomb by the U.S. was the major
reason for a policy shift toward
Russian in the middle months of
1945.
Useful critiques of Alperovitz's
view can really only be found in
the work of other revisionists like
Kolko and Anton Theoharis.
Despite the obvious weakness
of Maddox's work, it has been
promoted by historians like the
late Herbert Feis (one-time State
Department economic
policy-maker), George Kennan
(another State Department
official and original formulator of
the containment doctrine), Arthur
Schlesinger, Jr. (adviser to
President Kennedy), and Eugene
V. Rostow (Under Secretary of
State under Kennedy).
I think, however, that the only
objective evaluation that one can
make of Maddox's book is that it
is a poor job. Under close
scrutiny, the book falls apart.
Reconsidering the origins of the
Cold War after having had the
dubious benefit of Maddox's
contribution, one can only
conclude that the revisionists have
made an important and probably
lasting contribution to our
understanding of what really
happened.

Robert James Maddox, The New
Left and the Origins of the Cold
War (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton
University Press, 1973), 169
pages, $7.95.
Beginning earlier, but achieving
increased recognition in the
mid-19605, new "revisionist"
interpretations of the origins of
the Cold War have upset what had
been the accepted account.
The essence of historical
revisionism, whether on the First
World War or Vietnam, and the
source of its political impact is to
be found in its close and critical
examination of official accounts
and official propaganda. Because
all history situates us at the end of
a chain of events, it provides us
with a concrete, empirical basis on
which to act in accord with our
values. Thus new historical
evidence and explanations which
are in important disagreement
with the official statements of
decision-makers have direct
political consequences.
After the Second World War,
the Rockefeller Foundation and
the Council on Foreign Relations
instituted a program of subsidized
scholarship in order to head off
the development of revisionism in
the writing of the war's history.
Knowing their record of
interest in such matters, it is no
surprise that similar influential
groups are applauding and
promoting this new
anti-revisionist book by Robert
James Maddox.
In appraising Maddox's book as
a piece of scholarship, two
difficulties became immediately
apparent. First, the book is not a
full scale anti-revisionist account
of the period like John Lewis
Gaddis' new and unsatisfactory
United States and the Origins of
the Cold War. Second, Maddox is
not providing a critique of the
causal theories of revisionists, as
Robert W. Tucker does in his
often excellent Radical Left and
American Foriegn Policy.
Footnotes
Instead, what Maddox provides
is an examination of a few of the
footnotes found on a few pages
and covering the short time
between the Yalta and Potsdam
conferences in 1945 in seven

books by revisionist historians
(William Appleman Williams, D.F.
Fleming, Gar Alperovitz, David
Horowitz, Gabriel Kolko, Diane
Shaver Clemens, and Lloyd C.
Gardner).
The conclusion which Maddox
draws after checking these
footnotes is "that these books
without exception are based upon
pervasive misusages of the source
materials."
To determine whether Maddox
is right we can turn to published
government documents and then
compare Maddox's description of
them with the revisionists'. We
can also read Alperovitz's reply to
Maddox in the March 1973
Journal of American History, the
replies of the seven revisionists
published in the June 17 New
York Times Book Review, and the
lengthy mimeographed replies
obtainable on request from
Kolko, Horowitz, and Gardner.
Not Pro-Moscow
The first type of error that
Maddox makes is implying that
Horowitz and Kolko are
pro-Moscow. On the contrary,
Horowitz has long been
influenced by Issac Deutscher's
Trotskyist views, and Kolko
considers the Soviet Union like
Britain and the U.S. to be an
imperial power "less concerned
with democratic politics than
friendly nations."
In fact, the remarkable thing
about Kolko's chapter on Yalta is
not what Maddox thinks he finds
in it. It is rather, as Robert D.
Schulzinger has noted, that
Kolko's description of the great
powers' cynical disregard at Yalta
for the rights of the peoples of
small nations is similar to the
contemporary complaints of
Robert Taft, John Bricker, and
Westbrook Pegler about Yalta's
secret diplomacy.
A second sort of error that
Maddox makes is in dropping the
over-all political context of
American diplomacy. For
example, in his treatment of
Horowitz and Kolko on the Polish
question, Maddox fails to weigh
correctly the extent to which
American decision-makers saw
Poland in terms of U.S.-Soviet
relations.
Finally, Maddox simply makes
factual errors. He misconstrues
the question of admitting
Argentina to the United Nations
in criticizing Horowitz. He
distorts, in attacking Williams,
Alperovitz, Kolko, and Garder,
the attitude of American
policy-makers toward the
conditions for foreign aid to
Russia after World War 11. He
misrepresents the de facto
situation on Poland's western

border in attacking Kolko.
But these are not new errors on
Maddox's part. They can be found
in an exchange of letters in the
May 18, 1972 New York Review
of Books, in which Ronald Steel
corrected Maddox's mistakes.

Journal of American History, the
replies of the seven revisionists
published in the June 17 New
York Times Book Review, and the
lengthy mimeographed replies
obtainable on request from
Kolko, Horowitz, and Gardner.
Not Pro-Moscow
The first type of error that
Maddox makes is implying that
Horowitz and Kolko are
pro-Moscow. On the contrary,
Horowitz has long been
influenced by Issac Deutscher's
Trotskyist views, and Kolko
considers the Soviet Union like
Britain and the U.S. to be an
imperial power "less concerned
with democratic politics than
friendly nations."
In fact, the remarkable thing
about Kolko's chapter on Yalta is
not what Maddox thinks he finds
in it. It is rather, as Robert D.
Schulzinger has noted, that
Kolko's description of the great
powers' cynical disregard at Yalta
for the rights of the peoples of
small nations is similar to the
contemporary complaints of
Robert Taft, John Bricker, and
Westbrook Pegler about Yalta's
secret diplomacy.
A second sort of error that
Maddox makes is in dropping the
over-all political context of
American diplomacy. For
example, in his treatment of
Horowitz and Kolko on the Polish
question, Maddox fails to weigh
correctly the extent to which
American decision-makers saw
Poland in terms of U.S.-Soviet
relations.
Finally, Maddox simply makes
factual errors. He misconstrues
the question of admitting
Argentina to the United Nations
in criticizing Horowitz. He
distorts, in attacking Williams,
Alperovitz, Kolko, and Garder,
the attitude of American
policy-makers toward the
conditions for foreign aid to
Russia after World War 11. He
misrepresents the de facto
situation on Poland's western

border in attacking Kolko.
But these are not new errors on
Maddox's part. They can be found
in an exchange of letters in the
May 18, 1972 New York Review
of Books, in which Ronald Steel
corrected Maddox's mistakes.
Most important of all in
assessing Maddox's work is the
question of whether he zeroes in
on footnotes that materially
damage the thesis of any book he
is criticizing.
The first problem is that
Maddox often misunderstands or
distorts the thesis of a book when
he is attacking it. He certainly
does not accurately convey the
central contention of William
Appleman Williams about the
Open Door ideology.
Maddox describes Horowitz as
finding a radical dichotomy
between the foreign policies of
Roosevelt and Truman, whereas
Horowitz's considered such
changes only stylistic. Horowitz's
real point was that the postwar
power distribution left most
important decisions in U.S. hands.
Key Point Not Faced
The second problem is that
Maddox does not confront the
revisionists by picking footnotes
essential to their theses. In the
case of Alperovitz, for example,
Maddox does not face
Alperovitz's key argument that
the possession of the atomic
bomb by the U.S. was the major
reason for a policy shift toward
Russian in the middle months of
1945.
Useful critiques of Alperovitz's
view can really only be found in
the work of other revisionists like
Kolko and Anton Theoharis.
Despite the obvious weakness
of Maddox's work, it has been
promoted by historians like the
late Herbert Feis (one-time State
Department economic
policy-maker), George Kennan
(another State Department
official and original formulator of
the containment doctrine), Arthur
Schlesinger, Jr. (adviser to
President Kennedy), and Eugene
V. Rostow (Under Secretary of
State under Kennedy).
I think, however, that the only
objective evaluation that one can
make of Maddox's book is that it
is a poor job. Under close
scrutiny, the book falls apart.
Reconsidering the origins of the
Cold War after having had the
dubious benefit of Maddox's
contribution, one can only
conclude that the revisionists have
made an important and probably
lasting contribution to our
understanding of what really
happened.

Robert James Maddox, The New
Left and the Origins of the Cold
War (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton
University Press, 1973), 169
pages, $7.95.
Beginning earlier, but achieving
increased recognition in the
mid-19605, new "revisionist"
interpretations of the origins of
the Cold War have upset what had
been the accepted account.
The essence of historical
revisionism, whether on the First
World War or Vietnam, and the
source of its political impact is to
be found in its close and critical
examination of official accounts
and official propaganda. Because
all history situates us at the end of
a chain of events, it provides us
with a concrete, empirical basis on
which to act in accord with our
values. Thus new historical
evidence and explanations which
are in important disagreement
with the official statements of
decision-makers have direct
political consequences.
After the Second World War,
the Rockefeller Foundation and
the Council on Foreign Relations
instituted a program of subsidized
scholarship in order to head off
the development of revisionism in
the writing of the war's history.
Knowing their record of
interest in such matters, it is no
surprise that similar influential
groups are applauding and
promoting this new
anti-revisionist book by Robert
James Maddox.
In appraising Maddox's book as
a piece of scholarship, two
difficulties became immediately
apparent. First, the book is not a
full scale anti-revisionist account
of the period like John Lewis
Gaddis' new and unsatisfactory
United States and the Origins of
the Cold War. Second, Maddox is
not providing a critique of the
causal theories of revisionists, as
Robert W. Tucker does in his
often excellent Radical Left and
American Foriegn Policy.
Footnotes
Instead, what Maddox provides
is an examination of a few of the
footnotes found on a few pages
and covering the short time
between the Yalta and Potsdam
conferences in 1945 in seven

books by revisionist historians
(William Appleman Williams, D.F.
Fleming, Gar Alperovitz, David
Horowitz, Gabriel Kolko, Diane
Shaver Clemens, and Lloyd C.
Gardner).
The conclusion which Maddox
draws after checking these
footnotes is "that these books
without exception are based upon
pervasive misusages of the source
materials."
To determine whether Maddox
is right we can turn to published
government documents and then
compare Maddox's description of
them with the revisionists'. We
can also read Alperovitz's reply to
Maddox in the March 1973
Journal of American History, the
replies of the seven revisionists
