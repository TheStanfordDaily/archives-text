# Treated Like Little Children?
## Foreign Students Find No Jobs 
### SRI KRISHN CHOPRA Analysis 
"Foreign students, like little
children, are meant to be seen,
not heard," stated an American
Ph.D. student in the Physics
Department.
When he found he was being
given dirty looks by a foreign
student standing close by, he
added: "These are not my views.
But this seems to be the attitude
of most Americans."
Said one Hewlett-Packard
representative to a foreign student
interviewee: "We run a business,
not a charity house. You don't
even have a permanent visa. How
can we risk a summer position
with you? Why you'll go back to
your country after completing
your degree—and steal our
technology in the process."
Few Job Interviews
Foreign students hardly ever
get the opportunity of even
appearing for job interviews,
though. Almost all American
employers stipulate the minimum
requirement of a permanent visa
for prospective employees. Since
foreign students come to this
country on student visas, they
become automatically ineligible.
Paradoxically, a foreigner
cannot qualify for a permanent
visa till he can convince the
American authorities that he has a
definite job offer. But no job is
offered to a foreigner till he has a
permanent visa.
Some 11.5 percent of
Stanford's total enrollment (about
11,500) is comprised of foreign
students. Most of these (nearly 90
percent) are graduate students in
Engineering, Sciences or Business.

Almost all of them have an above
average—usually excellent
academic standing.
Student Visa
The student visa permits a
foreign student to stay for 18
months in the United States after
completing his University degree.
The purpose of this stay is to
enable him to get practical
on-the-job experience which
complements his University
education.
But hardly any foreign student
manages to get a suitable job (or
any job) which would justify the
purpose of the 18-month
extension permitted him by the
U.S. Government.
"Last year," W.L. Whitsett,
Engineering/Science director of
the Placement Center recalled,
"only one foreign student from
engineering could manage to get a
job on a student visa."
Why do foreign students want
to get jobs here, anyway?
Financial Support
The main reason would be the
same like for everyone else: to
keep the wolf from the door.
Foreign students require summer
jobs to support themselves during
the summer months when
University or other aid is not
available. Some of them need jobs
to keep themselves in school.
Another prime motivation,
besides the purely economic,
which makes foreign students,
especially applied sciences,
engineering and business students,
want jobs here is gaining valuable
insight into the working of the
American industry, the world's
most advanced technology.
A French student who

completed his Master's in
Industrial Engineering this spring
said: "I really wanted to get some
experience in the working of the
American industry before going
back to France. But I couldn't
even apply anywhere without a
permanent visa. So I'm going back
with an M.S. in Industrial
Engineering but with zero
industrial experience."
Practical Applications
"But we can't force the
Industry to employ foreign
students," said Placement Center
Employment Director Pam Evans.
"We don't have any hold over
them.
"All we can do is to provide
them with student resumes if they
ask us. Besides, we don't have the
staff to make special job
placement efforts for foreign
students. That should be the
I-Center's concern."
However, the I-Center's
director, A. Lee Ziegler, felt that
the Placement Center is simply
throwing the ball in his court.
"How can the I-Center bother
about things like job placement
for foreign students? he asked.
No Staff, Either
"We don't have the staff or the
resources to involve ourselves in
such work. Placement for anyone
has to be the concern of the
Placement Center—not ours."
Actually, the I—Center does
concern itself with job
placement—though indirectly and
only for American students going
abroad.
A special section in the
I-Center provides guidance and
help in arranging jobs for
American students planning to
spend their vacation in a foreign
country. This section coordinates
with the U.S. branch of a
resourceful international
organization called the
International Association for the
Exchange of Students for
Prominent Industrialists
The lAESTE/U.S. has a
governing body comprising of
prominent industrialists from the
well-known corporations in the
United States. It coordinates with
similar bodies in 41 other
countries to provide "on the job
training abroad for students of
engineering, architecture,
agriculture and the sciences:

enhancing carer development by
the addition of international
experience."
Would the lAESTE/U.S. help
interested foreign students in U.S.
universities enhance their career
development by the addition of
American experience?
The reply of lAESTE/U.S.
Executive Director, Robert
Sprinkle, carried the familiar
strain: "We do not have the staff
or the resources to do that."
Besides, he added, the
Department of State does not
permit them to assume
sponsorship of students already in
the United States.
Americans First
The concern of the
Department of State—as also of
most Americans—is the
employment of unemployed
Americans in preference to any
foreigners.
However, Prof. Gayton
Germane of the Business School
remarked that job experience 'is
the best aid America, in its
capacity as the world's leader in
technology, can give to
underdeveloped countries. By
teaching and then training their
young citizens in our industry we
help them help themselves. This is
much more valuable than aid in
dollars."
Not all professors, however,
agree. Another Stanford
instructor said, "Why should I go
out of my way to help a foreign
student get a job? When I was in
Europe last year, they didn't
allow my son to work. He had to
sit idle for the whole year. At
least we give foreign students
permission to work. Isn't that
more than enough?"
But in the face of all the visa
restrictions, a work permit is not
more than enough. The solution
to the foreign students' job
problems lies in an organized
effort by their professors in
conjunction with the Placement
Center, the I-Center and the
Alumni Association.
"The University would then be
doing its bit," says an Indian
student, "to ensure that foreign
students who come to this great
center of learning, thousands of
miles away from their homes with
glorious dreams of the future, are
not just taken for granted like
little children."
