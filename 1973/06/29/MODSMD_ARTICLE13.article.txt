# The 						Stanford Daily Entertainment Spectrum
## 
### 
Ideally, ' 'Entertainment
Spectrum" would be a complete
listing of every entertainment
event happening on campus and in
the Bay Area. Actually, due to
space limitations, it is incomplete
at best. But we hope to include
something for everyone. The
column will appear on Fridays,
summarizing upcoming events for
the following week.
We solicit listings for this
column. Please address all
contributions to Terry Amur,
entertainment editor, The
Stanford Daily, Storke Student
Publications Building, Stanford,
California 94305; or call the
Daily, ext. 4632.
