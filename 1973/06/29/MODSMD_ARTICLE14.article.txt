# A 						San Francisco Valentine
## Film Poets Praise 'The City' 
### JON R. KENNEDY 
Anyone who loves San
Francisco or wants to become
better acquainted with it will find
"Above San Francisco," now
playing at the Cannery Cinema in
the City, an appropriate valentine
to America's most beloved
metropolis.
Filmed from numerous vantage
points aboard planes, helicopters,
balloons, and occasionally even on
solid ground, the film by Greg
MacGillivray and James Freeman,
with narration by Orson Welles,
gives perspectives on the City and
environs available only through
the magic of cinematography.
Part of this magic is created
because many sequences are sepia
tone film archives from the 1906
earthquake and fire, and from the
1915 Pan-Pacific Exposition in
which the City showed off its
rising from the ashes.
It includes other memorable
events and sites, some of which
have long since disappeared,some
of which remain substantially
unchanged, and some of which are
now much different.
The construction of the
Golden Gate Bridge, for example,
is recaptured from start, to
completion, to present, with a
dramatic aerial swing past a

bridge-top workman which rivals
the breathtaking thrills of early
Cinerama travelogues.
The ocean and bay, the
redwood hillsides of Marin, the
morning fogs and evening sunsets
are all captured, along with the

splendor of the opera and the
decadence of North Beach.
The film runs hourly, 12 times
daily, and at $1.50 admission
there is hardly a better buy
available for an evening or
weekend family or dating tour.

DOPE HUMORISTS—the comedy duo of Cheech and Chong brings
the contemporary humor that marks the pair's two successful comedy
albums to the Circle Star Theater in San Carlos this weekend. "We
found something that people could relate to," explains Tommy
Chong. "For old time vaudeville comics, the common denominator is
booze. For today's audience, it's weed, reds, ripple, and rock and
roll."
