# Disjointed Plot Devices Mar Predictable James Bond Film
## 
### ELLEN KENESHEA 
"Live and Let Die," the latest
James Bond thriller from
producers Albert P. Broccoli and
Harry Saltzman, doesn't live up to
the best of its predecessors. Paul
and Linda McCartney have
composed a tuneful title song but,
like most of what's good about
"Live and Let Die," it hasn't
much to do with what's going on
in the rest of the movie.
The film pivots on a wobbling
plot device padded out in too
many ways for too many minutes,
and there are just more gimmicks
than plot to fit them to. "Live
and Let Die" has its moments—a
pair of hands deals out Tarot
cards and a woman's voice
prophesies "a man comes,
bringing violence" over a shot of a
jet speeding Bond to New York; a
man watches a funeral that turns
out to be his own.
I But finally the plot gets lost as
Bond sweeps from jiving Harlem
hoods to Voodoo cultists, tossing
off one-line puns that never quite
make it, not because they're any
worse than they have been in
previous Bond films, but because
they're so predictable and forced.
It's all there—odd devices that
do marvelous things, ordinary
mechanical gewgaws reworked for
extraordinary purposes, trap
doors leading into caverns
stenciled with the very latest in
electronic refinements, and an
assortment of beautiful dangerous
femmes—yet nothing coheres.
A Bored Bond
Part of the problem is director
Guy Hamilton's pacing, part is
Tom Mankiewicz's banal and
unclear screenplay, part is Roger
Moore's much too blase Bond.
Sean Connery had a way of
looking as though he were poised
on the edge of a knife blade at
every moment. Up until that
closing scene when he disappeared
from view wrapped in the arms of

some gorgeous girl, he acted as
though he led a dangerous life and
knew it. Even standing still,
Connery's Bond was ready to
dodge, sidestep or swirl to avoid
taking the step that might be his
last.
But Roger Moore's Bond goes
down so smoothly it's hard to be
sure he's there. Moore is so suave
and cool that he doesn't seem to
notice that he's doing anything
special even when he's standing on
a three-foot square island
surrounded by hungry crocodiles
inching up on him.
Nonchalant Violence
He looks right enough for the
role, and he captures the relaxed
almost nonchalant Bondian way
of dealing with violence, but
there's no tenseness or spark to
him at all.
Hamilton has done better work
on "Goldfinger" and "Diamonds
are Forever," his two previous
Bond films. In "Live and Let
Die," his pacing always seems to
be a beat too slow, and his
direction of actors only randomly
successful.
Geoffrey Holder plays a
übiquitous smiling Voodoo doctor
chillingly well, but of Bond's two
bedmates, only Jane Seymour as
the telepathic Solitaire maintains
any interest. Gloria Hendry's
acting is singularly inept.
Plot Lacks Focus
Yaphet Kotto makes a
competent but unfrightening
criminal mastermind for Bond to

thwart. Hamilton doesn't set up
Kotto's character well, so one
never really knows exactly who he
is, what he wants, or why that
should matter so much. Thus
Bond's own activities lose focus.
Finally "Live and Let Die"
levels out into a series of broadly
comic scenes tinged with sporadic
violence and wit all of which,
though interesting, don't come to
a head.
In fact, from the McCartneys'
theme song on,"Live and Let Die"
seems to be a compendium of
sidetracks that never quite make a
movie.
