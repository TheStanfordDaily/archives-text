# ASSU Plans One Concert
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
There are undoubtedly many
students on campus who hope fc
an end to the one-cr>ncert-per
auartev policy of the ASSIJ
Special Events Office. As a latin
rock concert planned for August 3
is the only event on the Special
Events summer schedule, it
appears that the policy will
continue during summer quarter.
Special Events presented John
Mayall and Mark-Almond in
concert last April 6. Because an
on-campus performance by Dan
Hicks and His Hot Licks
scheduled for June 7 was
cancelled, no major rock concert
has taken place at Stanford since
April.
Doug Baldwin, one of two new

ASSU special Events managers
who replace former manager Ron
Shannon, attributes the lag in
concert bookings to the
switchover in managers that took
place during May. Concerts must
be booked two months or more in
advance, he says, and if no one is
at the phones during May, the
summer months are cancelled out.
Another part of the problem,
Baldwin explains, is that big-name
artists prefer to deal with
large-scale promoters.
"Luckily we have been
industrious in booking people for
the fall and the winter," he says.
Meanwhile, Stanford rock fans
will have to continue to travel to
San Francisco, Oakland, or
Berkeley.
