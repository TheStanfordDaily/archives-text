Indochina Showdown Ahead?
WASHINGTON—The Senate Appropriations Committee
has set the stage for a possibly dramatic confrontation
between the legislative and executive branches over the
bombing in Indochina.
The committee voted 9-8 yesterday to attach an
amendment to an appropriations bill that would require a
total U.S. military withdrawal from the embattled area.
The appropriations bill is needed to keep the federal
governmental machinery operating in the fiscal year that
begins Sunday.
Earlier this week, the President vetoed a supplemental
appropriations bill that carried an amendment sponsored
by Sen. Thomas Eagleton (D~Mo.) cutting off all funds
for the war effort.
That veto was sustained by the House Wednesday. A
two-thirds vote in both the House and Senate is needed to
override a Presidential veto.
Television Newsman In Contempt
NEW YORK—Buffalo television newsman Stewart Dan of
WGR-TV was sentenced to 30 days in jail yesterday for
refusing to answer a grand jury's questions about the
September, 1971 Attica prison riot.
State Supreme Court Judge Carman Ball allowed the
reported until 10 a.m. Monday to appeal the sentence.
25 Teamsters Arrested
KERN COUNTY—Kern County Sheriff's deputies
yesterday arrested 25 Teamster Union members who
allegedly attacked members of the United Farm Workers
Union (UFW). Deputies claim the Teamsters infiltrated a
UFW picket line at a ranch 11 miles south of Lamont.
Charges against the Teamsters ranged from malicious
mischief to assault with a deadly weapon.
Fist fights broke out between UIAV picketsand lettuce
harvesters near Guadalupe yesterday also. Santa Barbara
County Sheriff's Deputies reported no serious injuries
there.
In the Coachella Valley, Gov. Ronald Reagan's chief
agricultural adviser characterized the area an "explosive
situation" as the UFW and Teamsters vie for
representation of the workers in the grape fields.
State Agriculture Director Brunei Christensen warned
yesterday that the National Guard will be summoned if
violence and damage in the valley increases.
New Defense Chief OK'd
WASHINGTON—The Senate has confirmed President
Nixon's nomination of James Schlesinger as Secretary of
Defense by a 96-0 vote.
The former head of the C.I.A. will be the third Defense
Secretary since 1969. He succeeds Elliot Richardson.
Legislature Approves Record Budget
SACRAMENTO —The State Senate and Assembly
yesterday both approved a record $9.46 billion state
budget.
It is the nation's largest state budget and $160 million
more than Gov. Reagan requested.
The budget includes the largest increase in spending for
education in history, salary hikes for state employees,
$89 million for acquiring part land, and $40 for
construction of a new legislative office building and

reconstruction for the more than 100-year-old capitol
building.
An additional $1.3 was allocated for construction of a
new Governor's mansion.
The budget will yield a $956 million surplus at the end
of fiscal 1973-74, according to legislative analyst A. Alan
Post.
The Senate passed the budget by a margin of 34 to six;
the Assemby 69 to three.
Senate Alters Demo Primary
SACRAMENTO—Legislation ending California's
controversial democratic winner-take-all presidential
primary easily passed the Senate today, 33-0.
The bill by state Sen. Alfred Alquist (D—San Jose)
would split the delegates among the candidates on the
basis of the proportion of the vote they receive in the
primary.
Candidates with less than 10 percent of the vote would
be excluded from delegate representation.
The measure also implements the primary system in
which all recognized candidates for the presidential
nomination are placed on the ballot, as provided for by a
state proposition that passed last year.
Reagan Repeats 'Won't Run 9
SACRAMENTO—Gov. Ronald Reagan repeated today
that he won't run for a third term in 1974. There has been
speculation that the governor has been under pressure
from wealthy political allies to run again.
But Reagan says that neither the threat of a bitter
party battle over the nomination nor the prospect of
surrendering his office to a democrat would change his
mind.
Reagan noted that he campaigned on a promise that he
was going to try to get California to limit its governors to
two terms. "I failed in that," he said, "But I still feel as
strongly as I did before."
BART Gets More Federal Money
WASHlNGTON—Transportation Department officials
yesterday announced a $21.7 million grant to the Bay
Area Rapid Transit (BART) District.
According to a spokesman here, money will be used to
aid BART in the acquisition and installation of a series of
safety, reliability and operating improvements. Frank
Herringer of the Urban Mass Transit Administration stated
the award is the ninth grant the government has made to
BART and brings the total of federal moneys to $225
million.
Kemper Pleads Not Guilty
SANTA CRUZ- Edmund Kemper, 24, pleaded not guilty
in a Santa Cruz court to charges of killing six college
coeds, his mother and her friend. Public Defender James
Jackson has asked judge Harry Brauer to reserve his
client's right to plead innocent by reason of insanity at a
later date, and Oct. 15 has been set as trial date.
Brauer turned down a motion to dismiss two of the
murder counts against the 6-foot-9, 280-pounder on
grounds of insufficient evidence. They involved the deaths
of Aiko Koo of Berkeley and Anita Luchessa of Fresno.
