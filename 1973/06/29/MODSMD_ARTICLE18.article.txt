# City Accused of Meddling
## Drug Abuse Board Fights Council 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
The battle for control of Palo
Alto's drug abuse control program
continues as the Palo Alto Community
Drug Abuse Board (PACDAB) passed a
measure condemning the city council's
"meddling" in the center's
management.
The Palo Alto City Council and
PACDAB, which was originally
appointed by the council, have been at
odds since the council amended the
city's $220,000 contract with the
board Monday increasing city
domination and lessening PACDAB's
authority over the program.
PACDAB controls two drug abuse
centers, a community drug abuse
prevention center, and the residential
treatment center closed down last
month.
PACDAB member Phill Bliss stated
Monday night, "there's no way in
hell" the 21-member board would
accept the council's new contract.
Amendments Passed
Council members passed three main
amendments to the PACDAB
contract:
— staff members of the prevention
and residential treatment centers may
be appointed to the self-perpetuating
board,
— the board must compile a list of
performance objectives to present to
the council,
— the board must comply with an
upcoming conflict-of-interest code.

Negotiation Period
Although board chairman Carla
Vespe earlier this week predicted a
feud between PACDAB and the
council, board member Pharmacology
Prof. Avram Goldstein described last
night's meeting as a calm one.
Rather than an all-out war,
Goldstein said PACDAB would enter a
"negotiation period" with the council.
He stated the board would accept the
city's $220,000, but would bargain to
regain the powers the council
removed.
He added that he hoped the city
would restore control of the program
to PACDAB so that the board could
provide "a service that the citizens of
Palo Alto want and need."
'Not A Fight'
Vespe described PACDAB's
position with the council not as a fight
but added that "we have had some
lively discussions."
She said the board would "wait
until we receive official
communication" of the council's
amendments to the drug abuse
program contract until it begins
official challenge of the council action.
"The council is tampering with the
philosophy of the program," Vespe
said. She accused the board of
attempting to modify the program
into "a traditional program with a
traditional structure," ruining the
"integrity of the program."
Vespe blamed the council's

"meddling" on the "pressure of the
more conservative members of the
community who need the security of
knowing that the city council has
control over the program."
New Staff Appointed
In its business, the board
overwhelmingly voted to reject the
"meddling amendments of the city
council." PACDAB members also
named residential treatment staff
personnel to replace four retiring
board members, in direct violation of
the council amendment.
One of the four named was
Jacqueline Deßose, wife of a graduate
student here.
Last week Palo Alto's drug abuse
center on University Ave. reopened,
after a scandal last month involving
the use' of heroin by staff members
forced its closing.
Community Involvement
The "Residential Treatment
Center" was re-named "Unity House"
to involve "the entire community,"
staff members Bill Baumgartner and
Maria Banataosaid.
The staff members presented a
four-page report they prepared to
distribute in the community outlining
some goals, program phases and daily
schedules planned for the staff and
residents.
"Our unified purpose as a
community is to educate people that
drug abuse is a symptom of our
problems," they said.

center on University Ave. reopened,
after a scandal last month involving
the use' of heroin by staff members
forced its closing.
Community Involvement
The "Residential Treatment
Center" was re-named "Unity House"
to involve "the entire community,"
staff members Bill Baumgartner and
Maria Banataosaid.
The staff members presented a
four-page report they prepared to
distribute in the community outlining
some goals, program phases and daily
schedules planned for the staff and
residents.
"Our unified purpose as a
community is to educate people that
drug abuse is a symptom of our
problems," they said.
The battle for control of Palo
Alto's drug abuse control program
continues as the Palo Alto Community
Drug Abuse Board (PACDAB) passed a
measure condemning the city council's
"meddling" in the center's
management.
The Palo Alto City Council and
PACDAB, which was originally
appointed by the council, have been at
odds since the council amended the
city's $220,000 contract with the
board Monday increasing city
domination and lessening PACDAB's
authority over the program.
PACDAB controls two drug abuse
centers, a community drug abuse
prevention center, and the residential
treatment center closed down last
month.
PACDAB member Phill Bliss stated
Monday night, "there's no way in
hell" the 21-member board would
accept the council's new contract.
Amendments Passed
Council members passed three main
amendments to the PACDAB
contract:
— staff members of the prevention
and residential treatment centers may
be appointed to the self-perpetuating
board,
— the board must compile a list of
performance objectives to present to
the council,
— the board must comply with an
upcoming conflict-of-interest code.

Negotiation Period
Although board chairman Carla
Vespe earlier this week predicted a
feud between PACDAB and the
council, board member Pharmacology
Prof. Avram Goldstein described last
night's meeting as a calm one.
Rather than an all-out war,
Goldstein said PACDAB would enter a
"negotiation period" with the council.
He stated the board would accept the
city's $220,000, but would bargain to
regain the powers the council
removed.
He added that he hoped the city
would restore control of the program
to PACDAB so that the board could
provide "a service that the citizens of
Palo Alto want and need."
'Not A Fight'
Vespe described PACDAB's
position with the council not as a fight
but added that "we have had some
lively discussions."
She said the board would "wait
until we receive official
communication" of the council's
amendments to the drug abuse
program contract until it begins
official challenge of the council action.
"The council is tampering with the
philosophy of the program," Vespe
said. She accused the board of
attempting to modify the program
into "a traditional program with a
traditional structure," ruining the
"integrity of the program."
Vespe blamed the council's

"meddling" on the "pressure of the
more conservative members of the
community who need the security of
knowing that the city council has
control over the program."
New Staff Appointed
In its business, the board
overwhelmingly voted to reject the
"meddling amendments of the city
council." PACDAB members also
named residential treatment staff
personnel to replace four retiring
board members, in direct violation of
the council amendment.
One of the four named was
Jacqueline Deßose, wife of a graduate
student here.
