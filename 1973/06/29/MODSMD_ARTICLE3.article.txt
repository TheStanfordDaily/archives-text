## Andrea Burt Last Witness In Chino Trial 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Andrea Holman Burt, the 19
year-old daughter of Medicine Prof.
Halsted Holman who faces charges of
murder, assault, and freeing a prisoner
in San Bernardino Superior Court will
appear next week as the final defense
witness as the two-month trial nears an
end.
Her husband, Benton Douglas Burt,
faces identical charges in the same

trial. He took the witness stand
yesterday.
The Burts are accused of helping
convict Ronald Wayne Beaty escape
from the California Institution for
Men at Chino last October 6. The
ambush escape led to Beaty's freedom,
but left one prison guard dead and
another guard wounded.
Beaty was recaptured two months
after the escape. He then turned state's

evidence in a plea bargain, received a
life sentence for murder, provided the
state's most damaging evidence against
the Burts, and implicated others in a
plot to free him from prison.
Under cross-examination by chief
defense attorney Charles Garry on
May 9, Beaty admitted that he lied to
the Grand Jury that indicted the Burts
when he testified about the aftermath
of the escape and the involvement of
fired English professor H. Bruce
Franklin in the plan.
D.A. Charges Conspiracy
Deputy district attorney Joseph D.
Canty has tried to involve the Burts in
a conspiracy to free Beaty by
introducing evidence against two other
persons who face identical charges in a
separate trial and connecting the Burts
to the plan.
The two people also facing charges
in connection with the escape are Jean
Hobson, who was arrested with Beaty,
and Robert Seabock, the man Beaty
claims fired the shots that killed and

wounded the guards.
Hobson is a former member of
Venceremos, a revolutionary
organization to which Andrea Burt
also belongs.
Burts in Hayward
Earlier this week, two witnesses
testified that the Burts were at their
Hayward apartment at the time of the
Chino escape, this corroborating the
Burts' alibi.
The defense has attempted to
discredit Beaty's testimony and to
present its own case to refute state
testimony that corroborates Beaty's
explanations.
Last Monday, Eleanor Kaplan, an
assistant professor of psychology at
California State University, Hayward,
said she spent 15 minutes with the
Burts in their apartment shortly after
noon on October 6. The
ambush-escape took place in Chino
around 1 p.m.
