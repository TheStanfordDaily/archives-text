# Alibi Supported By Testimony
## Andrea Burt Last Witness In Chino Trial 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Andrea Holman Burt, the 19
year-old daughter of Medicine Prof.
Halsted Holman who faces charges of
murder, assault, and freeing a prisoner
in San Bernardino Superior Court will
appear next week as the final defense
witness as the two-month trial nears an
end.
Her husband, Benton Douglas Burt,
faces identical charges in the same

trial. He took the witness stand
yesterday.
The Burts are accused of helping
convict Ronald Wayne Beaty escape
from the California Institution for
Men at Chino last October 6. The
ambush escape led to Beaty's freedom,
but left one prison guard dead and
another guard wounded.
Beaty was recaptured two months
after the escape. He then turned state's

evidence in a plea bargain, received a
life sentence for murder, provided the
state's most damaging evidence against
the Burts, and implicated others in a
plot to free him from prison.
Under cross-examination by chief
defense attorney Charles Garry on
May 9, Beaty admitted that he lied to
the Grand Jury that indicted the Burts
when he testified about the aftermath
of the escape and the involvement of
fired English professor H. Bruce
Franklin in the plan.
D.A. Charges Conspiracy
Deputy district attorney Joseph D.
Canty has tried to involve the Burts in
a conspiracy to free Beaty by
introducing evidence against two other
persons who face identical charges in a
separate trial and connecting the Burts
to the plan.
The two people also facing charges
in connection with the escape are Jean
Hobson, who was arrested with Beaty,
and Robert Seabock, the man Beaty
claims fired the shots that killed and

wounded the guards.
Hobson is a former member of
Venceremos, a revolutionary
organization to which Andrea Burt
also belongs.
Burts in Hayward
Earlier this week, two witnesses
testified that the Burts were at their
Hayward apartment at the time of the
Chino escape, this corroborating the
Burts' alibi.
The defense has attempted to
discredit Beaty's testimony and to
present its own case to refute state
testimony that corroborates Beaty's
explanations.
Last Monday, Eleanor Kaplan, an
assistant professor of psychology at
California State University, Hayward,
said she spent 15 minutes with the
Burts in their apartment shortly after
noon on October 6. The
ambush-escape took place in Chino
around 1 p.m.
Under cross-examination, Canty
tried to show the jury that Kaplan
might have reason to lie for the Burts.
She is a member of Venceremos, with
a reported history of participation in
revolutionary activities. According to
Garry, Kaplan "held up beautifully"
under Canty's questioning.
More Support
On Wednesday, Cheryl Hockin
Satcher, who testified that she was
with the Burts in Hayward during
much of the day of the escape,
provided further support for the Burts'
alibi. Canty attempted to undermine
her credibility by presenting
inconsistencies between her court
testimony and statements she made
while she was in temporary custody
shortly after the escape.
Another defense witness, Joe
Morgan, denied Beaty's charges that he
was the leader of the "Mexican Mafia"
or any pther prison group, and said he
had refused to participate in Beaty's
escape plans.
Morgan said Beaty told him he was
"playing the radical" so he could

infiltrate Venceremos and use it as a
bargaining agent if the escape plans fell
through.
Yesterday, 30-year-old Douglas
Burt told the jury of his experiences in
prisons where he has spent 15 years of
his life. He told of frequent beatings of
prisoners by guards, and said he had
organized a union of prisoners
opposed to indeterminate sentencing.
He also said he was "definitely not"
involved in the escape or in a plan to
free Beaty.
In another courtroom development
yesterday, Garry and assistant defense
attorney Tom Nolan explained that
the Burts surrendered to authorities
when they learned there was a warrant
issued for their arrest shortly after the
escape, because they knew they were
innocent.
Doug Burt's testimony will
continue on Monday. His wife will
take the stand after he is
cross-examined.
Last week, Judge Thomas
Haldorsen dismissed 65 year-old Marie
Glassner from the five-man,

seven-woman, all-white jury because
she had made remarks to other jurors
in the courtroom that clearly revealed
her inability to weigh the evidence
fairly. Glassner was replaced by an
alternate juror.
Although Canty announced that he
would call over 100 witnesses in the
trial, the state called about 30
witnesses and rested its case two weeks
ago, after much testimony was
condensed in stipulation.
According to Garry, the
prosecution rested early because "they
didn't really have anything. After
Beaty they were just chewing the fat."
Andrea Burt will be the fortieth
witness for the defense.
Garry also indicated that the
defense had filed a motion requesting
the judge to investigate why Andrea
Burt's parents and others involved in
the defense were under surveillance by
intelligence units of the San
Bernardino County Sherriff's
Department and the Los Angeles
Police Department. Haldorsen ordered
a halt to the surveillance.

from the California Institution for
Men at Chino last October 6. The
ambush escape led to Beaty's freedom,
but left one prison guard dead and
another guard wounded.
Beaty was recaptured two months
after the escape. He then turned state's

evidence in a plea bargain, received a
life sentence for murder, provided the
state's most damaging evidence against
the Burts, and implicated others in a
plot to free him from prison.
Under cross-examination by chief
defense attorney Charles Garry on
May 9, Beaty admitted that he lied to
the Grand Jury that indicted the Burts
when he testified about the aftermath
of the escape and the involvement of
fired English professor H. Bruce
Franklin in the plan.
D.A. Charges Conspiracy
Deputy district attorney Joseph D.
Canty has tried to involve the Burts in
a conspiracy to free Beaty by
introducing evidence against two other
persons who face identical charges in a
separate trial and connecting the Burts
to the plan.
The two people also facing charges
in connection with the escape are Jean
Hobson, who was arrested with Beaty,
and Robert Seabock, the man Beaty
claims fired the shots that killed and

wounded the guards.
Hobson is a former member of
Venceremos, a revolutionary
organization to which Andrea Burt
also belongs.
Burts in Hayward
Earlier this week, two witnesses
testified that the Burts were at their
Hayward apartment at the time of the
Chino escape, this corroborating the
Burts' alibi.
The defense has attempted to
discredit Beaty's testimony and to
present its own case to refute state
testimony that corroborates Beaty's
explanations.
Last Monday, Eleanor Kaplan, an
assistant professor of psychology at
California State University, Hayward,
said she spent 15 minutes with the
Burts in their apartment shortly after
noon on October 6. The
ambush-escape took place in Chino
around 1 p.m.
Under cross-examination, Canty
tried to show the jury that Kaplan
might have reason to lie for the Burts.
She is a member of Venceremos, with
a reported history of participation in
revolutionary activities. According to
Garry, Kaplan "held up beautifully"
under Canty's questioning.
More Support
On Wednesday, Cheryl Hockin
Satcher, who testified that she was
with the Burts in Hayward during
much of the day of the escape,
provided further support for the Burts'
alibi. Canty attempted to undermine
her credibility by presenting
inconsistencies between her court
testimony and statements she made
while she was in temporary custody
shortly after the escape.
Another defense witness, Joe
Morgan, denied Beaty's charges that he
was the leader of the "Mexican Mafia"
or any pther prison group, and said he
had refused to participate in Beaty's
escape plans.
Morgan said Beaty told him he was
"playing the radical" so he could

infiltrate Venceremos and use it as a
bargaining agent if the escape plans fell
through.
Yesterday, 30-year-old Douglas
Burt told the jury of his experiences in
prisons where he has spent 15 years of
his life. He told of frequent beatings of
prisoners by guards, and said he had
organized a union of prisoners
opposed to indeterminate sentencing.
He also said he was "definitely not"
involved in the escape or in a plan to
free Beaty.
In another courtroom development
yesterday, Garry and assistant defense
attorney Tom Nolan explained that
the Burts surrendered to authorities
when they learned there was a warrant
issued for their arrest shortly after the
escape, because they knew they were
innocent.
Doug Burt's testimony will
continue on Monday. His wife will
take the stand after he is
cross-examined.
Last week, Judge Thomas
Haldorsen dismissed 65 year-old Marie
Glassner from the five-man,

seven-woman, all-white jury because
she had made remarks to other jurors
in the courtroom that clearly revealed
her inability to weigh the evidence
fairly. Glassner was replaced by an
alternate juror.
Although Canty announced that he
would call over 100 witnesses in the
trial, the state called about 30
witnesses and rested its case two weeks
ago, after much testimony was
condensed in stipulation.
According to Garry, the
prosecution rested early because "they
didn't really have anything. After
Beaty they were just chewing the fat."
Andrea Burt will be the fortieth
witness for the defense.
Garry also indicated that the
defense had filed a motion requesting
the judge to investigate why Andrea
Burt's parents and others involved in
the defense were under surveillance by
intelligence units of the San
Bernardino County Sherriff's
Department and the Los Angeles
Police Department. Haldorsen ordered
a halt to the surveillance.
Andrea Holman Burt, the 19
year-old daughter of Medicine Prof.
Halsted Holman who faces charges of
murder, assault, and freeing a prisoner
in San Bernardino Superior Court will
appear next week as the final defense
witness as the two-month trial nears an
end.
Her husband, Benton Douglas Burt,
faces identical charges in the same

trial. He took the witness stand

May 9, Beaty admitted that he lied to
the Grand Jury that indicted the Burts
when he testified about the aftermath
of the escape and the involvement of
fired English professor H. Bruce
Franklin in the plan.
D.A. Charges Conspiracy
Deputy district attorney Joseph D.
Canty has tried to involve the Burts in
a conspiracy to free Beaty by
introducing evidence against two other
persons who face identical charges in a
separate trial and connecting the Burts
to the plan.
The two people also facing charges
in connection with the escape are Jean
Hobson, who was arrested with Beaty,
and Robert Seabock, the man Beaty
claims fired the shots that killed and

wounded the guards.
Hobson is a former member of
Venceremos, a revolutionary
organization to which Andrea Burt
also belongs.
Burts in Hayward
Earlier this week, two witnesses
testified that the Burts were at their
Hayward apartment at the time of the
Chino escape, this corroborating the
Burts' alibi.
The defense has attempted to
discredit Beaty's testimony and to
present its own case to refute state
testimony that corroborates Beaty's
explanations.
Last Monday, Eleanor Kaplan, an
assistant professor of psychology at
California State University, Hayward,
said she spent 15 minutes with the
Burts in their apartment shortly after
noon on October 6. The
ambush-escape took place in Chino
around 1 p.m.
Under cross-examination, Canty
tried to show the jury that Kaplan
might have reason to lie for the Burts.
She is a member of Venceremos, with
a reported history of participation in
revolutionary activities. According to
Garry, Kaplan "held up beautifully"
under Canty's questioning.
More Support
On Wednesday, Cheryl Hockin
Satcher, who testified that she was
with the Burts in Hayward during
much of the day of the escape,
provided further support for the Burts'
alibi. Canty attempted to undermine
her credibility by presenting
inconsistencies between her court
testimony and statements she made
while she was in temporary custody
shortly after the escape.
Another defense witness, Joe
Morgan, denied Beaty's charges that he
was the leader of the "Mexican Mafia"
or any pther prison group, and said he
had refused to participate in Beaty's
escape plans.
Morgan said Beaty told him he was
"playing the radical" so he could

infiltrate Venceremos and use it as a
bargaining agent if the escape plans fell
through.
Yesterday, 30-year-old Douglas
Burt told the jury of his experiences in
prisons where he has spent 15 years of
his life. He told of frequent beatings of
prisoners by guards, and said he had
organized a union of prisoners
opposed to indeterminate sentencing.
He also said he was "definitely not"
involved in the escape or in a plan to
free Beaty.
In another courtroom development
yesterday, Garry and assistant defense
attorney Tom Nolan explained that
the Burts surrendered to authorities
when they learned there was a warrant
issued for their arrest shortly after the
escape, because they knew they were
innocent.
Doug Burt's testimony will
continue on Monday. His wife will
take the stand after he is
cross-examined.
Last week, Judge Thomas
Haldorsen dismissed 65 year-old Marie
Glassner from the five-man,

seven-woman, all-white jury because
she had made remarks to other jurors
in the courtroom that clearly revealed
her inability to weigh the evidence
fairly. Glassner was replaced by an
alternate juror.
Although Canty announced that he
would call over 100 witnesses in the
trial, the state called about 30
witnesses and rested its case two weeks
ago, after much testimony was
condensed in stipulation.
According to Garry, the
prosecution rested early because "they
didn't really have anything. After
Beaty they were just chewing the fat."
Andrea Burt will be the fortieth
witness for the defense.
Garry also indicated that the
defense had filed a motion requesting
the judge to investigate why Andrea
Burt's parents and others involved in
the defense were under surveillance by
intelligence units of the San
Bernardino County Sherriff's
Department and the Los Angeles
Police Department. Haldorsen ordered
a halt to the surveillance.
Andrea Holman Burt, the 19
year-old daughter of Medicine Prof.
Halsted Holman who faces charges of
murder, assault, and freeing a prisoner
in San Bernardino Superior Court will
appear next week as the final defense
witness as the two-month trial nears an
end.
Her husband, Benton Douglas Burt,
faces identical charges in the same

trial. He took the witness stand
yesterday.
The Burts are accused of helping
convict Ronald Wayne Beaty escape
from the California Institution for
Men at Chino last October 6. The
ambush escape led to Beaty's freedom,
but left one prison guard dead and
another guard wounded.
Beaty was recaptured two months
after the escape. He then turned state's

evidence in a plea bargain, received a
life sentence for murder, provided the
state's most damaging evidence against
the Burts, and implicated others in a
plot to free him from prison.
Under cross-examination by chief
defense attorney Charles Garry on
May 9, Beaty admitted that he lied to
the Grand Jury that indicted the Burts
when he testified about the aftermath
of the escape and the involvement of
fired English professor H. Bruce
