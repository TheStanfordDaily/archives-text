# Four Kids Recovering From Heart Surgery
## 
### 
Four children of a Santa Rosa
teamster are all in satisfactory
condition after open heart surgery at
Stanford Hospital, a spokesman
reported yesterday.
The surgery on David, Richard,
Kevin and Karen Costello, children of
Mr. and Mrs. David Costello, went
"very well," according to Dr. Edward
Stinson, who headed one of two teams
that performed the operations.
The surgery repaired atrial septal
defects — holes in the muscle wall of
the upper chambers of the heart — on
each of the children. Each operation
took about two hours.
A team headed by Dr. Norman
Shumway performed the surgery on
Kevin, 13, and Karen, 4. According to
hospital' spokesman Gary Cavalli, the
holes were small enough to be simply
sewn up.
Stinson's team performed the
operations on Richard, 15, and David,
18. Since the holes were larger, the
team took material from the
membrane sac surrounding the heart
to patch the defects.
All four were immediately taken to
the intensive care unit, where they will
remain for two to three days, Cavalli
said. After that, they'll remain in the
hospital for another three to four days
before being discharged.
After their release, the family plans
to take a vacation to Blue Lake, near
IJkiah. The children will be under
doctor's orders to take it easy for
about a month before resuming
normal activity.
The family stayed in San Jose for
several days before checking into the
hospital Tuesday. A Med Center

statement quoted Mrs. Costello as
being "very relieved" that the surgery
was successful.
Mrs. Costello said earlier that the
wide publicity the operation received
spurred blood donations the children
needed for the operation.

INJUNCTION SOUGHT—On April 12, 1971, four Palo Alto policemen armed with a search warrant entered the Daily
and examined desks, wastebaskets and photo files in an unsuccessful attempt to locate photos of an April 9 riot. Dailv
attorneys are now seeking an injunction against further such searches, after a federal! court judge ruled the search
unconstitutional.
