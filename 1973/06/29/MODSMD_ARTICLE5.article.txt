# Rabid Bats Plague Area
## 
### BOB SIEGEL 
The University community has
been warned against an invasion of
rabid bats.
In a memorandum issued this past
Monday, Hal Wilson, Safety and
Health Specialist said three suspicious
bats found on campus during the week
of June 18 were tested for rabies and
that one caught near the main library
proved rabid. This was the second
rabid bat discovered on campus this
year.
According to Dr. Bemice
Giansiracusa, an official of the Santa
Clara County Health Department, the
incidence of rabies among bats as
dramatically increased this year. She
reported "we've had 22 positively
identified cases since April [whereas]
we usually have only five to six in a
whole year."

No one seems able to account for
the current rabies epidemic among
bats.
Giansiracusa explained rabid bats
are traditionally found in the Bay Area
in early spring and late fall. This year,
by contrast, the disease has been
reported consistently since April. She
suggested the bats may have carried
the virus in their migration from
various locations in Mexico and
Southern California.
Abnormal Behavior
In his memorandum, Wilson
admonished all university residents to
be cautious around bats, particularly
those exhibiting abnormal behavior
such as bumping into walls, flying
during daylight hours, or crawling on
the ground.
Anyone who observes a diseased
bat should make no attempt to touch,
capture or confine it, but rather
should report his finding to the Santa
Clara County Health Department if
the creature can be caught, since
department officials are anxious to
test any suspicious bats.
Dr. James B. McClenahan, Director
of Cowell Student Health Center
reports "we haven't seen anybody this
year" who has been bitten by a bat,
but warned Escondido Village
residents over a month ago of the
danger after its prevalence became
known.
Treatment Advised
He advised anyone injured by a bat
immediately wash the area around the
wound then go to a doctor. Given the

current epidemic situation among bats,
the director stated that treatment for
rabies would likely be instituted in all
bite cases, even when the presence of
rabies in the animal remains
unconfirmed.
McClenehan added that the
incidence of rabies among dogs and
rats has not increased and that
treatment of bite cases from these
animals does not assume the presence
of the disease.
Unfortunately, rabid bats are
usually more dangerous than other
similarly afflicted animals because
they have a capacity to carry the
disease for a longer period before it
kills them.
Older Buildings
Bats are usually found residing in
caves, barns, and old buildings. Wilson
observes that many of the older
buildings here have open eaves,
covered walkways, and large open
attics.
These structures give excellent
protection from light and provide
good foundations for nest-building.
Health Specialist John Holmes
reports "a substantial bat population,"
on campus and adds "you can hear
them around the Quad."
In a related incident, a 24 year-old
Morgan Hill mother of two recently
stepped on a bat in her shower. Upon
examination, authorities found the bat
to be rabid. Although the women was
not bitten, health officials stated she
would probably undergo anti-rabies
treatment as a precaution.
