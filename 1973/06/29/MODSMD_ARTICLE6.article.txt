# Judge Hears Motion To Ban 'Daily' Search

Special to the Daily
SAN JOSE — U.S. District Court
Judge Robert F. Peckham heard
arguments Wednesday in his
courtroom here On the Stanford
Daily's motion for a preliminary
injunction barring law enforcement
agencies from searching the
newspaper's offices.
The Daily's motion came in the
wake of a June 1 search of the
Stanford Psychiatry Clinic's files by
investigators for the District
Attorney's office of Santa Clara
County.
Daily offices were searched in
April, 1971 and Peckham ruled in
October, 1972 that such searches of
third parties — those not suspected of
a crime — could not be made with a
search warrant. Peckham decreed that
subpoenas must be used when seeking
evidence from third parties in most
cases.
Although Peckham ruled in the
Daily's favor in October, he refused to
grant an injunction preventing future
searches, claiming that there was no
further danger of this.
Daily attorneys Anthony G.
Amsterdam, Franklin R. Garfield, and
Jerome B. Falk Jr. argued that the
Psychiatry Clinic search violated
Peckham's October ruling and
presented a threat to the Daily.
In arguments for the plaintiffs,
Amsterdam accused the D.A. of
flagrantly violating Peckham's ruling.
The Stanford Law School professor
also used the Psychiatry Clinic search
to refute defense claims earlier in the
case that the Daily search was an
unusual and isolated incident which

should not be used to create a
precedent.
Amsterdam claimed that the most
recent use of a search warrant to
obtain evidence from third parties
emphasized the need for protection of
the Daily.
Santa Clara County Counsel Lee
Stephenson asserted that the D.A.'s
office fully intended to honor
Peckham's ruling and avoid searches of
the Daily. He pointed out that any
injustices brought about by a search
warrant in the Psychiatry Clinic search
were caused by faults inherent in all
search warrants.
Stephenson concluded that the
proceedings surrounding the Daily's
motion were not the proper forum to
consider such inequities.
Peckham frequently interrupted
Stephenson, either seeking
clarification or criticizing him for
misinterpreting points of law. Daily
attorney Garfield commented on
leaving the courtroom that "things
went as well as possible" for the
plaintiffs. Peckham's ruling, however,
is not expected until later in the
summer.
Peckham also has two other
motions to rule on before the case can
be appealed by the defendants. On
April 2, Daily attorneys argued before
Peckham that the defendants should
pay the plaintiffs legal expenses. Soon
after, the defendants moved for
summary judgement of dismissal, an
unusual action since they last the
October decision. Rulings on these
motions are also expected by the end
of the summer.
