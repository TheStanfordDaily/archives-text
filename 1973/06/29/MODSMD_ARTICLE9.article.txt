USE Clarification
Editor:
I would like to correct certain
errors and clarify some issues in
the "USE Wins NLRB Labor
Election" article that appeared in

the June 26 Daily.
The USE Executive Committee
has established a Contract
Demands Committee which will
do the preparation work leading
to the contract demands. This
Committee's work will take
several weeks.
In the meantime, three interim
Negotiation Committees are
meeting with management's team
to negotiate 1) the transfer of
Tresidder food service workers to
TDS, 2) a reversal of the SLAC
layoffs, and 3) interim
arrangements until the contract is
negotiated, such as office space
and use of ID mail.
The question of whether all
employees in the unit must join
the union is one that will be
decided along with the other
contract demands after extensive
discussion, arguments pro and
con, and a vote by the bargaining
unit members. Then it must be
negotiated.
Glenda Jones
USE President
