# Grievance Hearings Open In Gibbs-Jones Dispute
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
Independent arbitration hearings in
the dispute between W. Ron Jones,
fired director of the Student Center
for Research and Innovation in
Education (SCIRE), and Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James L. Gibbs
began quietly yesterday.
Arbiter Eva Robbins of New York
City decided early in the proceedings,
that she would hear the evidence and
presentations of both sides before
making any final decisions.
Robbins will submit a decision in
writing in approximately two to four
weeks after the hearings have
concluded.
The arbiter divided Jones' grievance
into two sections this morning. She
will first consider whether Jones'
appointment as SCIRE director was
for one academic year (1972-73) or
for two academic years.
If Robbins decides the University's
commitment to Jones extended only
to his June 30 dismissal date, then
Gibbs' decision not to rehire Jones will
stand regardless of the testimony
presented.
Right To Fire
If Robbins decides the University
originally hired Jones until June 1974,
she will consider the opposing views in
ruling whether Gibbs has the right to
fire Jones.
Jones, representing himself, began
by outlining his case against the
University, Gibbs, and Asst. Dean of
Undergraduate Studies B. Michael
Closson, Gibbs' representative to
SCIRE. University attorney Jerry
Halligan represented the University
and the deans.
Jones presented four arguments
supporting his reinstatement as SCIRE
director:
—the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies implied in writing to him and
the SCIRE Policy Board that Jones'
employment would be for a two-year
period. The SCIRE Policy Board
would be responsible for determining
his duties;
—there was reasonable cause for
Jones to believe throughout his tenure
that he was accountable not to the

Dean of Undergraduate Studies, but to
the SCIRE Policy Board;
—the working relationship between
Jones and the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies deteriorated not so much as a
consequence of Jones' behavior, but
because of Closson's negligence and
immaturity;
—the dismissal procedure by the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies did
not provide an adequate complaint or
period of time to respond to this
complaint.
'Judgmental'
In dismissing Jones April 27, Gibbs
claimed that Jones had not been
"sufficiently judgmental" in accepting
student course proposals and had
ignored certain "administrative
requirements" such as proposal
deadlines and teacher appointment
procedures.
Through the testimony of Policy
Board members Physics Prof. Arthur
Schawlow and John Junkerman, a
student, Jones claimed to refute these
charges.
Schawlow testified that although he
"often had reservations" about Jones'
"lack of concern" for official
University deadlines, the ex-SCIRE
director's "postive, 'let's do it
attitude'" was invaluable for the
program.
Deadlines
Jones later presented a chart of all
SCIRE project deadlines during his
term as director, stating that only one
course and two projects failed to meet
deadlines Gibbs established.
Schawlow also testified that while
Closson gave Jones and the Policy
Board "guidelines" to remedy the
failures of SCIRE, that the dean never
gave Jones "the specific points" in
each instance why he and Gibbs had
been displeased.
Junkerman testified that "the
board's consensus" made it clear that
Jones was not to screen proposals
before the Policy Board reviewed
them. However, under Halligan's
cross-examination Junkerman
admitted that the "consensus" only
became explicit policy in late
February, well after the difficulties

between Jones and Gibbs began.
Commenting on the SCIRE Policy
Board's autonomy in dealing with
Jones, Provost William F. Miller stated
that "no faculty committee can take
final action on accreditation of courses
and short-term appointments" of
personnel.
Robbins refused to let Miller, the
last witness of the day, review his May
31 decision upholding Gibbs' decision
to fire Jones.
The grievance hearings cap a
three-month dispute between Jones
and the Office of the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies.
After Gibbs' decision to dismiss
Jones, the SCIRE Policy Board voted
to sever its ties with the Dean's office
April 27.
