# 'Jesus Christ Superstar'
## Film Reinterprets The New Testament 
### ELLEN KENESHEA 
"Jesus Christ Superstar" is a
star-crossed return to the roots, a
reinterpretation of the New
Testament through sophisticated
doubt. It works, and it doesn't
work. The musical has merit, but
is too clever to be convincing;
director Norman Jewison's film
has much strength, but is not
resourceful enough to be
compelling.
"Superstar" tacitly accepts
Christ as the son of God, but
questions what sort of man he
was. Authors Tim Rice and
Andrew Lloyd Webber depict
Christ as a self-serving young man,
not quite strong enough to
succeed in his Father's work, nor
wise enough to understand why
he doesn't. Their Christ is rather
more petulant than profound.
Ted Neeley is well cast as the
cranky, soft-faced Christ whose
watchful gaze reveals depths of
indecision. He wears power
wrongly, the disciple Judas
Iscariot believes, and must be
stopped. Judas betrays Christ, but
doubts about his own
understanding of Christ lead him
to suicide.
Judas is a sincere and sincerely
troubled man according to
"Superstar." The unanswered
query, both for him and for the

audience, is whether or not he is
also misguided.
Carl Anderson's is a galvanized
Judas. His mental battles rage
through his whole body, and even
as he stands silently observing
Christ about his business and
weighing the truth he finds there,
Anderson looks as though he's
ready to lash out screaming.
Driving Melodrama
There are times, in fact, when
Anderson becomes too strong a
presence for the rest of the film,
but this may be Jewison's fault, as
the director inclines to the
melodramatic throughout the
film. The technique works, for the
material itself is none too subtle,
and is written to be punched
home.
Jewison has blended the reality
of the play with the mystery of
the tale. He has transferred
"Superstar" to the Israeli desert,
and there in the story's original
surroundings, the cast re-enacts
the play.
Jewison chose his backdrop
well, for the vast desert and its
mountains of rock seem to watch
the proceedings with memories
that thrust back centuries to the
events themselves.
Rock Sets The Pace
The film cross cuts effectively
between scenes which seem

almost real and those that are
abstract, so that the rock music
score never sounds out of place or
slights the subject. By contrasts,
"Godspell" the other current
musical pop version of the New
Testament is both banal and
trivial.
Andrew Lloyd Webber's music
for "Superstar" is also by far the
better of the two. Some of it is
merely useful in pushing the story
along, but much has the driving
force and lyricism that paces the
best musicals.
Rob Iscove's choreography
slacks when compared to the
stunning virtuosity of a Bob Fosse
("Cabaret," "Sweet Charity"),

Douglas Slocombe's photography
tends to prettify things to dullness
or rely on worn out and
distracting effects, but the energy
of the cast counters some of these
problems.
Fine Cast
The cast is, in general, one of
the best things about the film.
Barry Dennen makes a fine
Pontius Pilate and Joshua Mostel
an amusing and menacing Herod.
Yvonne Elliman's Mary Magdalene
is sweet without being sticky.
"Superstar" isn't great or
exceptionally memorable, but it is
a very successful movie adaptation
of a musical that doesn't quite
succeed in fulfilling its ambitions.

arrested him in the film "Jesus Christ Superstar." The Norman
Jewison film is an adaptation of the rock musical that portrays the
Christ figure as a young man beset by introspective doubt.
