For a sample of authentic old New Orleans jazz, played by the
musicians who helped make it famous, be sure not to miss Billie and
DeDe Pierce and their Preservation Hall Jazz Band, appearing tonight
through Saturday in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
This will be the group's seventh annual summer appearance at
Stanford. Led by DeDe Pierce on cornet and his wife Billie on piano,
the band consists of veterans of decades of New Orleans Jazz.
Trombonist "Big Jim" Robinson played with Bunk Johnson and
George Lewis. Willie Humphrey played clarinet with King Oliver's
Creole Jazz Band. Drummer "Cie" Frazier, who has played with
Bessie Smith and on Mississippi riverboats, is a relative youngster in
the band at age 68. Allan Jaffe, the founder of Preservation Hall in
New Orleans, sometimes helps out on tuba.
Despite their ages, these musicians have maintained the youthful,
joyful spirit of original New Orleans jazz, which has to be the happiest
music in the world.
PHJB has always been well received at Stanford, a major reason for
their annual return. According to Jaffe, "We have given more
performances at Stanford than any one other place outside of
Preservation Hall. We hope we will be able to come back forever."
The Office of Public Events will celebrate PHJB's fiftieth
performance with a reception for the band on stage immediately
following the show.
The band will be playing tonight through Saturday at 8 p.m. in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, with added late performances at 10 p.m. on
Friday and Saturday. In addition, there will be a special outdoor
concert on Saturday, July 14.
