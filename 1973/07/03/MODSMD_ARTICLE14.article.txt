Cambodia Bombing Increases
WASHINGTON — Pentagon spokesman William Beecher yesterday announced a
sharp increase in U.S. bombing in Cambodia, but denied that the increase
violates a Presidential agreement with Congress not to extend bombing action
without provocation before Aug. 15.
Beecher said the number of tactical strikes has escalated to a level of 200 per
day, a 30 percent increase from last year's figures.
In Cambodia, government troops have found the bodies of 800 rebels
believed killed in heavy air and artillery strikes last month during guerrilla
campaigns to cut major highways near the capital.
Light U.S. bombing action was reported near Phnom Penh yesterday.
Gas Rationing Predicted
WASHINGTON — Twr Ohio oil company officials have estimated that gasoline
rationing will come within the next year if the demand for gasoline does not
decrease.
One official said that ration books have already been printed.
A national survey of gasoline distributors indicates that enough gasoline will
be available to handle the Fourth of July weekend traffic.
Allende Request Refused
SANTIAGO — The Chilean Chamber of Deputies has refused President Salvador
Allende's request for a 90-day declaration of nationwide martial law. The
opposition party-dominated chamber voted 81-52 against granting martial law
powers to the Allende regime.
Allende requested the declaration last week in the aftermath of an aborted
military revolt outside the presidential palace during which 22 persons were
killed.
Israeli Diplomat Slain
BEIRUT — No Palestinian guerrilla group has claimed responsibility for the
murder of Israeli diplomat Yosef Alon outside his Washington home last night
and FBI agents are investigating a street crime theory supported by the fact that
Alon's wife was not harmed.
Alon's body was flown to Tel Aviv last night for burial and Israeli Defense
Minister Moshe Dayan vowed to "wipe out terrorist groups everywhere" in
reprisal for the murder.
In other Middle East news, Libyan leader Colonel Moammar Khadafy is
urging a total merger with Egypt, despite his country's ill feelings. Khadafy has
been in Cairo for the past two weeks discussing the possibility of a merger,
although Cairo's political leaders have said that such a move is best performed in
stages.
Although many Egyptian officials are uncertain about the impact of the
"Cultural Revolution" Khadafy has instigated in Libya, Khadafy and Egyptian
Premier Anwar Sadat agreed 18 months ago to a referendum vote in September
on plans for a full union.
Sales Tax Up
SACRAMENTO — The state one-cent sales tax boost took effect Sunday
morning. Gov. Ronald Reagan failed to veto a bill that would have delayed it six
months and provide a one-time 30 percent income tax rebate.
State Controller Houston Flournoy termed the tax boost "ludicrously
unjust" in light of the State's $829 billion surplus budget. The tax increase was
enacted last year to aid the state's new property tax relief school aid program.
The sales tax boost was passed when lawmakers and the governor failed to reach
an agreement on how the increase was to be handled.
Fair Through Wednesday
San Francisco Bay Area weather will be fair through Wednesday except for
patches of low clouds Tuesday night and morning, warmer Tuesday. Lows both
nights in the 50's, highs Tuesday and Wednesday in the 60's near the coast, in
the 70's and 80's inland. And in beautiful downtown Santa Rosa, the high will
be 92.
