# Santa Cruz County Waives Extradition
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Santa Cruz County officials have
apparently waived first rights to
extradite James E. Johnson, the
ex-Stanford radical who has been
linked with a number of area
bombings.
Johnson was wanted on a charge of
possession of illegal explosives in
connection with a "bomb factory" he
allegedly operated at a cabin in the
Santa Cruz mountains.
After he disappeared in March,
1971, Santa Cruz authorities swore
out a federal fugitive warrant seeking
his arrest and return.
However, according to Ray Belgard,
chief investigator for the Santa Cruz
District Attorney's office, the county
will defer its claim on Johnson at least
until after the disposition of a charge
of assault on a peace officer in Santa
Clara County. Johnson was out on bail
on the Santa Clara charge when he
disappeared.
Sources indicate at least two law
enforcement agencies want to question
Johnson about several area bombings,
including an Oct. 8, 1970 blast at the
Marin County Courthouse in San
Rafael and the attempted bombing of
a Palo Alto building housing both a
Bank of America branch and the Palo
Alto FBI field office.
In March, 1971, radical-turied
informer Thomas Edward Mosher told
the Internal Security Subcommittee of
the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee
that Johnson was involved in both
episodes.
Authorities may also be hoping
Johnson can shed some light on the

Jan. 6, 1971 murder of Amon "Fred"
Bennett, a Black Panther Party
captain, near the Santa Cruz cabin.
Mosher said Bennett was killed by
Jimmy Carr, an ex-convict and
onetime cellmate of "Soledad
Brother" George Jackson. According
to Mosher, Johnson helped Carr
dispose of Bennett's body by hacking
and burning it.
Carr himself was the victim of an
execution-style slaying in San Jose on
April 6, 1972. Two men were
subsequently convicted of his murder,
and prosecutors claimed at the time
that the two were hired by an
unnamed third party.
A San Francisco television news
story that said Johnson would be
charged with Bennett's murder was
"false," Belgard said.
"There's no way we could charge
him with it [Bennett's murder],"
Belgard said yesterday. "We've closed
our books on it, since the man we
think killed him is dead (Carr]."
Belgard said Santa Cruz may still
prosecute Johnson on the explosives
charge after the Santa Clara charge is
resolved. Johnson also faces two
outstanding warrants in San Mateo
County.
Johnson, from Jamaica, N.Y., was a
senior in chemical engineering here.
Johnson is apparently fighting
attempts to extradite him from Puerto
Rico to California. Belgard said he
thought Santa Clara officials were in
the process of obtaining a governor's
warrant for his return, but local
authorities would not confirm this
yesterday.
