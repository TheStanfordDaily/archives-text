# Upset At Wimbledon
## Mayer Overcomes Nastase 
### 
Alex "Sandy" Mayer, Stanford's top tennis player,
scored one of the greatest Wimbledon upsets in years
when he beat Romania's Ilie Nastase 6-4, 8-6, 6-8, 6-4
Saturday.
Mayer thus has reached the quarterfinals of the
prestigious Wimbledon tourney, which is the national
championship of Great Britain. He faces Jurgen
Fassbender of West Germany today.
Nastase, ranked second in the world behind America's
Stan Smith, was the odds-on favorite to win the
Wimbledon tournament after nearly all other touring
professionals, including former Stanford star Roscoe
Tanner, withdrew in protest of the suspension of Nikki
Pilic of Yugoslavia.
Unnerved
The Romanian star, ordered to play by his national
association, was, according to observers at the scene,
unnerved by Mayer's hard-hit forehand returns of service.
The Stanford star broke Nastase's service in the first
game of the match, played on a grass court before as
many of the 28,000 spectators as could crowd around the
court. Thereafter, each player won his service in the set,
assuring Mayer's victory.
In the second set, both players won their first six
services, with Mayer finally breaking in the thirteenth

gime to win 8-6.
After Nastase rallied to win the third set, Mayer won
the fourth set and the match by breaking Nastase in the
third game, hitting quick forehand and backhand winners.
Into The Net
Thereafter, Mayer was never in trouble, finally winning
when Nastase hit a ball into the net.
Nastase, known for his temper, twice questioned line
calls against him by rifling a ball at the line judge, who
was also from Romania.
Mayer recently won the NCAA singles championship,
and has planned to return to Stanford for his senior
season next year. He is from Wayne, N.J. and is 21 years
old.
Previous Loss
Fassbender beat Mayer 6-1, 6-1 when the two players
met earlier this year.
The Mayer-Fassbender winner must face the winner of
the match between Jimmy Connors of Belleville, 111., and
Alex Metrevelli of Russia.
Other quarterfinalists are Jan Kodes of Czechoslovakia,
second seed and now the favorite, who plays India's Vijar
Amritraj, and England's Roger Taylor, who plays
Sweden's 17 year-old Bjorn Borg, the player with the
largest female following.
