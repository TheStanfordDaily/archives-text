# Birth Defects Center Opens July 11
## 
### KATHERINE RAMBO 
A new reconstructive surgery
facility for the diagnosis and treatment
of facial birth defects in children will
open at Children's Hospital at
Stanford July 11.
The new service, a combined effort
of Children's Hospital and the
Stanford Medical Center, will be
directed by Assoc. Surgery Prof.
Emest K?.plan, in the Medical Center's
Division of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgery.
The program, the Pediatric
Reconstructive Surgery Service,
represents an effort by the two
institutions to provide new patient
services to the community and
Northern California.
According to Kaplan, the service
will "provide a comprehensive
evaluation of cranio-facial deformities,
deft lip and cleft palate and speech
disorders related to palate
dysfunction."
Extensive Program
Stanford's Surgical Rehabilitation
program is one of the largest and most
extensive in the United States. In

addition to its local programs, it
supports several substantial programs
in Central America.
Hospital staff members make six to
eight trips a year to Nicaragua,
Mexico, Honduras and other countries
to conduct personnel training and
examine patients. Kaplan himself will
spend the month of December in
Guatemala working with cleft lip and
cleft palate children.
Approximately 1500 children have
been treated at the Med Center in the
past ten years for facial birth defects,
Kaplan said.
Under the traditional system of
treatment, a patient would often meet
with several doctors in different
locations, with each physician
compiling separate and highly
individual files. This made it extremely
difficult to keep comprehensive
records of a patient's care and
treatment—an almost impossible task
if the patient had more than one
congenital disorder.
Bonus
"The additional bonus of
centralizing this information "is the
increase in medical knowledge to be
gained by having accurate and
complete records that can be rapidly
processed by the compuer," Kaplan
said.
The rapid development of surgical
techniques in recent years has made it
possible for the rehabilitation and
reconstructive surgery process to
become a multi-disciplinary team
effort involving pediatricians, speech
pathologists, dentists, neurologists and
plastic surgeons.
The patient will be treated in these
areas while being evaluated by full
time staff psychiatrists and social
workers for possible social and
emotional adjustment problems; an
option open to all patients at
Children's Hospital.
In addition, special cameras will
make a continuous film recording of
the patient under a fluoroscopic
examination.
This technique, called
Cinefluoroscoping voice study, is one of
the most important in diagnosing cleft
palate speech and prescribing
treatment. It allows the doctor to
visualize the movement of the soft

palate while the patient is speaking or
swallowing.
To improve team efficiency, all
clinical data on a patient will be
computerized and thus made easily
accessible to doctors and parents.
The new surgical program grew out
of a 1968 agreement between
Children's Hospital, a seperate entity
located on Stanford land, and the
School of Medicine, to develop joint

programs reducing unnecessary and
costly duplication of facilities and
staff, to attain comprehensive medical
care for children and to provide the
best possible opportunities for
pediatric teaching and research.
The new program will be
coordinated with the activities of the
already existing Birth Defects Center
in the Medical Center's Department of
Pediatrics.

make a continuous film recording of
the patient under a fluoroscopic
examination.
This technique, called
Cinefluoroscoping voice study, is one of
the most important in diagnosing cleft
palate speech and prescribing
treatment. It allows the doctor to
visualize the movement of the soft

palate while the patient is speaking or
swallowing.
To improve team efficiency, all
clinical data on a patient will be
computerized and thus made easily
accessible to doctors and parents.
The new surgical program grew out
of a 1968 agreement between
Children's Hospital, a seperate entity
located on Stanford land, and the
School of Medicine, to develop joint

programs reducing unnecessary and
costly duplication of facilities and
staff, to attain comprehensive medical
care for children and to provide the
best possible opportunities for
pediatric teaching and research.
The new program will be
coordinated with the activities of the
already existing Birth Defects Center
in the Medical Center's Department of
Pediatrics.
A new reconstructive surgery
facility for the diagnosis and treatment
of facial birth defects in children will
open at Children's Hospital at
Stanford July 11.
The new service, a combined effort
of Children's Hospital and the
Stanford Medical Center, will be
directed by Assoc. Surgery Prof.
Emest K?.plan, in the Medical Center's
Division of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgery.
The program, the Pediatric
Reconstructive Surgery Service,
represents an effort by the two
institutions to provide new patient
services to the community and
Northern California.
According to Kaplan, the service
will "provide a comprehensive
evaluation of cranio-facial deformities,
deft lip and cleft palate and speech
disorders related to palate
dysfunction."
Extensive Program
Stanford's Surgical Rehabilitation
program is one of the largest and most
extensive in the United States. In

addition to its local programs, it
supports several substantial programs
in Central America.
Hospital staff members make six to
eight trips a year to Nicaragua,
Mexico, Honduras and other countries
to conduct personnel training and
examine patients. Kaplan himself will
spend the month of December in
Guatemala working with cleft lip and
cleft palate children.
Approximately 1500 children have
been treated at the Med Center in the
past ten years for facial birth defects,
Kaplan said.
Under the traditional system of
treatment, a patient would often meet
with several doctors in different
locations, with each physician
compiling separate and highly
individual files. This made it extremely
difficult to keep comprehensive
records of a patient's care and
treatment—an almost impossible task
if the patient had more than one
congenital disorder.
Bonus
"The additional bonus of
centralizing this information "is the
increase in medical knowledge to be
gained by having accurate and
complete records that can be rapidly
processed by the compuer," Kaplan
said.
The rapid development of surgical
techniques in recent years has made it
possible for the rehabilitation and
reconstructive surgery process to
become a multi-disciplinary team
effort involving pediatricians, speech
pathologists, dentists, neurologists and
plastic surgeons.
The patient will be treated in these
areas while being evaluated by full
time staff psychiatrists and social
workers for possible social and
emotional adjustment problems; an
option open to all patients at
Children's Hospital.
In addition, special cameras will
make a continuous film recording of
the patient under a fluoroscopic
examination.
