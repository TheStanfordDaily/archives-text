# Both Work And Play On Summer Campus

Summer at Stanford.
Soft drinks and suntan lotion
replace tranquilizers, study aids, and
desperately-markedcalendars as staples,
while Tfesidd&r and White Plaza rather
than the Main Library and UGLY are
the main hangouts of students.
Although the "academic year" is
defined as any three quarters of the
sequence of four, the lifestyle of the
summer here definitely deviates from
the traditional scholastic stretch of
September to June.
The student population decreases
to about one-third of the regular
enrollment. One student remarked
that the smaller enrollment, combined
with the diversity of people, allows for
a markedly different experience than
that of the "normal" year.
According to Sally Mahoney,
director of Summer Session,
enrollment approximates 3700 during
the summer. This number has
remained fairly stable for several years.
Around 900 are Stanford
undergrads, 2000 Stanford grads, and
the remainder are visitors. These are
divided more or less evenly between
graduate and undergraduate students.
Workshops
In addition, about 4500 people
attending conferences and workshops
spend anywhere from a few days to
several weeks on campus. Most of
these sessions are designed by the
professional schools as continuing
education programs.
One of the more conspicuous is the

Stanford Executive Program,
sponsored by the Graduate School of
Business, which continues through
mid-August. The range of topics is vast
— from Library Automation to an
International Shock Tube Symposium
to a soccer coaching camp.
Summer also means intensified
research efforts for science professors
and students. According to Mahoney,
"twice as much research went on in
the summer quarter of last year than
in any other single quarter of that
year." Without a heavy teaching load,
"research can be the significant work"
of summer.
For most students, their
satisfaction with the summer program
depends on their motives in coming.
These motives vary: there are
full-time students who seek lesser
loads for fall and winter, high school
juniors who want a taste of living away
from home, and those sampling
Stanford for possible full-time
enrollment. Many, too, are simply
looking for "a good time."
California Dream
The relaxed atmosphere and the
hope of increased social contact are
"what it's about," according to many
students. Easterners are largely viewed
as seekers of "the California dream."
Some students are a little
disappointed. One Yale student
expressed a common lament: "I've
met maybe one or two Californians
since I've been here."
