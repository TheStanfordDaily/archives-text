# Tresidder Coffee House Rebuilt For More Atmosphere, Efficiency
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
For a coffee house to succeed in
attracting patrons, it has to have a
distinctive and attractive atmosphere.
The new Stanford Community
Coffee House, which opens this week
after extensive remodeling, has a lot of
atmosphere.
Walking into the building at the
sneak preview Sunday night, one
immediately noticed the dark
carpeting and acoustic tile which,
combined with the lights hung from
the ceiling, create a shadowy effect.
On both sides of the room, there
are raised areas with carpeted steps
that proved an inviting place to sit at
the preview.
On one of the raised areas, a band
plays, surrounded by new green plants.
Because of the acoustic tile, it's
actually possible to hear the band
above the muted crowd noise.
Contemplation
On the other raised area, there are
three raised boxes from which you can
look down upon the entire scene.
Since lamps hang low over the boxes,
it's easy to contemplate future chess

players and the inevitable kibitzers
crowded about the area, nervously
sipping espresso.
Nearby in dark privacy sit several
booths to be enjoyed by couples
savoring fresh fruit macedonias. The
old coffee house tables have been
sandblasted and revarnished, and they
will be spread throughout the room,
with more space between them.
The new Coffee House is only
slightly larger than the old one, which
was completely gutted prior to the
remodeling. Because of improved
utilization of space, however, it will be
able to accommodate far more patrons
than did the old one, according to
architect-chief designer Nick Corff.
Increased Size
The increased size comes from
space formerly belonging to the
Tresidder games area. A door will lead
from the Coffee House into this area,
so that bowlers and billiards players
will have access to refreshments.
On the south side of the Coffee
House, going from one side of
Tresidder to the other, is a passageway
which will soon serve as an art gallery

also.
This new, more open design, plus
an all-new ventilation system, will
keep the room from becoming a
smoky oven on crowded Saturday
nights.
Service Area
Perhaps the biggest improvements
in the new Coffee House is the service
area. Customers will be able to
approach the solid oak bar top from
any of the three sides. The floor
bordering the bar is of Spanish tile
which will not be damaged by spilled
beverages.
Because the refrigerator is located
in the middle of the service area and
opens from any side, nearly all
refreshments may be ordered from any
side. The inside bar top is also a
cutting board for freshly-made
sandwiches.
Six delicatessen rases will stock
sandwiches during the peak lunch
periods, with four which turn into
space to accommodate barstools
during the rest of the day, according
to Corff.
1 The new service area makes it
possible to serve more people taster
than before, with the same number of
employees. It also meets all health
codes, in contrast to the old Coffee
House.
Staples
Ken Brubaker, manager of the
Coffee House, does not plan to expand
the menu at the present time. The
staples of the Coffee House will
continue to be beverages, sandwiches,
pastries, fruit and soup.
Entertainment is planned for two
or three'nights a week, according to
Brubaker. He looks forward to at least
a 10-15 percent increase in sales as a
direct result of the remodeling, with
capacity for further sales growth.
Remodeing began on June 1 and
was supervised by the architectural
firm of Corff & Koehler. Bonnie
Koehler was largely responsible for the
trim and color coordinating.
Warm Hues
The colors in the room are dark,
warrti hues which are expected to add
to the cozy atmosphere the designers
tried, with some success, to create.
The remodeling cost $30,000, more
than originally anticipated but,
according to Corff, only about half
what it would have cost to bring in an

outside contractor to do the work.
About 20 people in all worked on
the Coffee House, according to
Brubaker, "not counting extraneous
plumbers, electricians, etc." These
people were mostly present and
former Stanford students, including
many regular Coffee House employees.
The extensive carpentry work was
done by- Tamo Kitaura and Akira
Nakemo, local carpenters who worked
at a considerable discount, according
to Corff.
Rebuilding
Corff and TMU food services
manager John Shaw were particularly
impressed by the spirit of everyone
who worked far into the night to
rebuild the Coffee House in just over a
month.
A few details, such as installing
panelling and trim, and staining some
of the many open wooden beams, have
yet to be completed. Brubaker
anticipates the Coffee House will open
either late today or Thursday, as it will
be closed on Wednesday,
Independence Day.
According to Brubaker, "we're
looking forward not only to a more
efficient operation but also to a more
pleasant atmosphere and maybe a little
fun."

The increased size comes from
space formerly belonging to the
Tresidder games area. A door will lead
from the Coffee House into this area,
so that bowlers and billiards players
will have access to refreshments.
On the south side of the Coffee
House, going from one side of
Tresidder to the other, is a passageway
which will soon serve as an art gallery

also.
This new, more open design, plus
an all-new ventilation system, will
keep the room from becoming a
smoky oven on crowded Saturday
nights.
Service Area
Perhaps the biggest improvements
in the new Coffee House is the service
area. Customers will be able to
approach the solid oak bar top from
any of the three sides. The floor
bordering the bar is of Spanish tile
which will not be damaged by spilled
beverages.
Because the refrigerator is located
in the middle of the service area and
opens from any side, nearly all
refreshments may be ordered from any
side. The inside bar top is also a
cutting board for freshly-made
sandwiches.
Six delicatessen rases will stock
sandwiches during the peak lunch
periods, with four which turn into
space to accommodate barstools
during the rest of the day, according
to Corff.
1 The new service area makes it
possible to serve more people taster
than before, with the same number of
employees. It also meets all health
codes, in contrast to the old Coffee
House.
Staples
Ken Brubaker, manager of the
Coffee House, does not plan to expand
the menu at the present time. The
staples of the Coffee House will
continue to be beverages, sandwiches,
pastries, fruit and soup.
Entertainment is planned for two
or three'nights a week, according to
Brubaker. He looks forward to at least
a 10-15 percent increase in sales as a
direct result of the remodeling, with
capacity for further sales growth.
Remodeing began on June 1 and
was supervised by the architectural
firm of Corff & Koehler. Bonnie
Koehler was largely responsible for the
trim and color coordinating.
Warm Hues
The colors in the room are dark,
warrti hues which are expected to add
to the cozy atmosphere the designers
tried, with some success, to create.
The remodeling cost $30,000, more
than originally anticipated but,
according to Corff, only about half
what it would have cost to bring in an

outside contractor to do the work.
About 20 people in all worked on
the Coffee House, according to
Brubaker, "not counting extraneous
plumbers, electricians, etc." These
people were mostly present and
former Stanford students, including
many regular Coffee House employees.
The extensive carpentry work was
done by- Tamo Kitaura and Akira
Nakemo, local carpenters who worked
at a considerable discount, according
to Corff.
Rebuilding
Corff and TMU food services
manager John Shaw were particularly
impressed by the spirit of everyone
who worked far into the night to
rebuild the Coffee House in just over a
month.
A few details, such as installing
panelling and trim, and staining some
of the many open wooden beams, have
yet to be completed. Brubaker
anticipates the Coffee House will open
either late today or Thursday, as it will
be closed on Wednesday,
Independence Day.
According to Brubaker, "we're
looking forward not only to a more
efficient operation but also to a more
pleasant atmosphere and maybe a little
fun."
For a coffee house to succeed in
attracting patrons, it has to have a
distinctive and attractive atmosphere.
The new Stanford Community
Coffee House, which opens this week
after extensive remodeling, has a lot of
atmosphere.
Walking into the building at the
sneak preview Sunday night, one
immediately noticed the dark
carpeting and acoustic tile which,
combined with the lights hung from
the ceiling, create a shadowy effect.
On both sides of the room, there
are raised areas with carpeted steps
that proved an inviting place to sit at
the preview.
On one of the raised areas, a band
plays, surrounded by new green plants.
Because of the acoustic tile, it's
actually possible to hear the band
above the muted crowd noise.
Contemplation
On the other raised area, there are
three raised boxes from which you can
look down upon the entire scene.
Since lamps hang low over the boxes,
it's easy to contemplate future chess

players and the inevitable kibitzers
crowded about the area, nervously
sipping espresso.
Nearby in dark privacy sit several
booths to be enjoyed by couples
savoring fresh fruit macedonias. The
old coffee house tables have been
sandblasted and revarnished, and they
will be spread throughout the room,
with more space between them.
The new Coffee House is only
slightly larger than the old one, which
was completely gutted prior to the
remodeling. Because of improved
utilization of space, however, it will be
able to accommodate far more patrons
than did the old one, according to
architect-chief designer Nick Corff.

Entertainment is planned for two
or three'nights a week, according to
Brubaker. He looks forward to at least
a 10-15 percent increase in sales as a
direct result of the remodeling, with
capacity for further sales growth.
Remodeing began on June 1 and
was supervised by the architectural
firm of Corff & Koehler. Bonnie
Koehler was largely responsible for the
trim and color coordinating.
Warm Hues
The colors in the room are dark,
warrti hues which are expected to add
to the cozy atmosphere the designers
tried, with some success, to create.
The remodeling cost $30,000, more
than originally anticipated but,
according to Corff, only about half
what it would have cost to bring in an

outside contractor to do the work.
About 20 people in all worked on
the Coffee House, according to
Brubaker, "not counting extraneous
plumbers, electricians, etc." These
people were mostly present and
former Stanford students, including
many regular Coffee House employees.
The extensive carpentry work was
done by- Tamo Kitaura and Akira
Nakemo, local carpenters who worked
at a considerable discount, according
to Corff.
Rebuilding
Corff and TMU food services
manager John Shaw were particularly
impressed by the spirit of everyone
who worked far into the night to
rebuild the Coffee House in just over a
month.
A few details, such as installing
panelling and trim, and staining some
of the many open wooden beams, have
yet to be completed. Brubaker
anticipates the Coffee House will open
either late today or Thursday, as it will
be closed on Wednesday,
Independence Day.
According to Brubaker, "we're
looking forward not only to a more
efficient operation but also to a more
pleasant atmosphere and maybe a little
fun."
For a coffee house to succeed in
attracting patrons, it has to have a
distinctive and attractive atmosphere.
The new Stanford Community
Coffee House, which opens this week
after extensive remodeling, has a lot of
atmosphere.
Walking into the building at the
sneak preview Sunday night, one
immediately noticed the dark
carpeting and acoustic tile which,
combined with the lights hung from
the ceiling, create a shadowy effect.
On both sides of the room, there
are raised areas with carpeted steps
that proved an inviting place to sit at
the preview.
On one of the raised areas, a band
plays, surrounded by new green plants.
Because of the acoustic tile, it's
actually possible to hear the band
above the muted crowd noise.
Contemplation
On the other raised area, there are
three raised boxes from which you can
look down upon the entire scene.
Since lamps hang low over the boxes,
it's easy to contemplate future chess

players and the inevitable kibitzers
crowded about the area, nervously
sipping espresso.
Nearby in dark privacy sit several
booths to be enjoyed by couples
savoring fresh fruit macedonias. The
old coffee house tables have been
sandblasted and revarnished, and they
will be spread throughout the room,
with more space between them.
The new Coffee House is only
slightly larger than the old one, which
was completely gutted prior to the
remodeling. Because of improved
utilization of space, however, it will be
able to accommodate far more patrons
than did the old one, according to
architect-chief designer Nick Corff.
Increased Size
The increased size comes from
space formerly belonging to the
Tresidder games area. A door will lead
from the Coffee House into this area,
so that bowlers and billiards players
will have access to refreshments.
On the south side of the Coffee
House, going from one side of
Tresidder to the other, is a passageway
which will soon serve as an art gallery

also.
This new, more open design, plus
an all-new ventilation system, will
keep the room from becoming a
smoky oven on crowded Saturday
nights.
Service Area
Perhaps the biggest improvements
in the new Coffee House is the service
area. Customers will be able to
approach the solid oak bar top from
any of the three sides. The floor
bordering the bar is of Spanish tile
which will not be damaged by spilled
beverages.
Because the refrigerator is located
in the middle of the service area and
opens from any side, nearly all
refreshments may be ordered from any
side. The inside bar top is also a
cutting board for freshly-made
sandwiches.
Six delicatessen rases will stock
sandwiches during the peak lunch
periods, with four which turn into
space to accommodate barstools
during the rest of the day, according
to Corff.
1 The new service area makes it
possible to serve more people taster
than before, with the same number of
employees. It also meets all health
codes, in contrast to the old Coffee
House.
Staples
Ken Brubaker, manager of the
Coffee House, does not plan to expand
the menu at the present time. The
staples of the Coffee House will
continue to be beverages, sandwiches,
pastries, fruit and soup.
Entertainment is planned for two
or three'nights a week, according to
Brubaker. He looks forward to at least
a 10-15 percent increase in sales as a
direct result of the remodeling, with
