# Tresidder Coffee House Rebuilt For More Atmosphere, Efficiency
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
For a coffee house to succeed in
attracting patrons, it has to have a
distinctive and attractive atmosphere.
The new Stanford Community
Coffee House, which opens this week
after extensive remodeling, has a lot of
atmosphere.
Walking into the building at the
sneak preview Sunday night, one
immediately noticed the dark
carpeting and acoustic tile which,
combined with the lights hung from
the ceiling, create a shadowy effect.
On both sides of the room, there
are raised areas with carpeted steps
that proved an inviting place to sit at
the preview.
On one of the raised areas, a band
plays, surrounded by new green plants.
Because of the acoustic tile, it's
actually possible to hear the band
above the muted crowd noise.
Contemplation
On the other raised area, there are
three raised boxes from which you can
look down upon the entire scene.
Since lamps hang low over the boxes,
it's easy to contemplate future chess

players and the inevitable kibitzers
crowded about the area, nervously
sipping espresso.
Nearby in dark privacy sit several
booths to be enjoyed by couples
savoring fresh fruit macedonias. The
old coffee house tables have been
sandblasted and revarnished, and they
will be spread throughout the room,
with more space between them.
The new Coffee House is only
slightly larger than the old one, which
was completely gutted prior to the
remodeling. Because of improved
utilization of space, however, it will be
able to accommodate far more patrons
than did the old one, according to
architect-chief designer Nick Corff.
Increased Size
The increased size comes from
space formerly belonging to the
Tresidder games area. A door will lead
from the Coffee House into this area,
so that bowlers and billiards players
will have access to refreshments.
On the south side of the Coffee
House, going from one side of
Tresidder to the other, is a passageway
which will soon serve as an art gallery

also.
This new, more open design, plus
an all-new ventilation system, will
keep the room from becoming a
smoky oven on crowded Saturday
nights.
Service Area
Perhaps the biggest improvements
in the new Coffee House is the service
area. Customers will be able to
approach the solid oak bar top from
any of the three sides. The floor
bordering the bar is of Spanish tile
which will not be damaged by spilled
beverages.
Because the refrigerator is located
in the middle of the service area and
opens from any side, nearly all
refreshments may be ordered from any
side. The inside bar top is also a
cutting board for freshly-made
sandwiches.
Six delicatessen rases will stock
sandwiches during the peak lunch
periods, with four which turn into
space to accommodate barstools
during the rest of the day, according
to Corff.
