Editor's Note: Carlo Prescott is an
ex-convict who has received a
grant from the Abellard
Foundation and has taught here
since 1971 under the auspices of
Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo.

this summer in conjunction with
Assoc. Psychology Prof. Daryl
Bern.
That I've lived in forced
celibacy half my years and all of
my adult life excepting seven and
a half years (assuming, in spite of
my social stigmas, I too was an
adult at eighteen), would then be
the basis for a society usually
curious, if nothing else, about
animal sexuality, to provide me a
platform. Society did not extend
me a platform.
Doctor Zimbardo has! And

aspects of all too little known a
subject as the Mind of the
Imprisoned are here in a course.
It's not vain of me to declare
that as a former prisoner in San
Quentin, Folsom, Chino and
Vaccaville Medical Facility, if I
possess a mind, the mind did not
cease to record the legal murder
expressed in electro convulsive
shock treatment administered to
the prisoner by state paid
psychiatrists; the fear inherent in
being a Black Man guarded by
people all trained in using
weapons, and generally embracing
a creed, an ideology just now
being attacked by Chicanos,
Blacks, Asians, even Jews and an
ever growing legion of former
Europeans—called White people
by some.

My mind, my movie, contains
vivid memories of the hate, gang
rapes, guard-inspired race riots
and murders, food strikes in a
prison, suicides, arrogant
chaplains concerned with soul and
indifferent to my ass, trafficing of
drugs by so-called free people,
guards, 'our keepers.' And the
hoax of being judged for parole
by a clique of ex-narcotic
officials, FBI agents and former
prison wardens. An experience
that should interest some. And as
to those unsympathetic to the
plight of robbers, burglars
murderers and dope fiends, there
is this....
What if a hood had an
intellect... not to compare to
your own, assuredly, but a bit of
intelligence.
As I observe the people in a
four year situation, at minimum,
struggling to get through to cop a
better job, please Mom and Dad
so the bread won't stop, getting
information to protect yourselves

from the world, and so many
other trips I won't editorialize,
the similarity of students and
prisoners in jail is striking. To be
able to predict where to find a
man or woman for years within a
prescribed area is limiting that
individual's freedom if you insist
it be there.
The crumbling of a
bureaucracy, the taint of
corruption in government, men
risking all for power and no
thought of consequences—limited
in their freedom in that the social
order that produced them taught
no alternative to the life style of
their peer group.
The song "The World is a
Ghetto" might be followed
naturally by the World is a Prison
with its ruled class, ruling class
and the guys with the 3.57
magnums and we know who they
work for.
Come then, can we not reason?
Thos of you who are looking for a
hustle in empire you wish to rule
that dies some every day from
Harlem to Wall Street, forgive me,
but split! To the rest who will
come, Welcome!

me a platform.
Doctor Zimbardo has! And

aspects of all too little known a
subject as the Mind of the
Imprisoned are here in a course.
It's not vain of me to declare
that as a former prisoner in San
Quentin, Folsom, Chino and
Vaccaville Medical Facility, if I
possess a mind, the mind did not
cease to record the legal murder
expressed in electro convulsive
shock treatment administered to
the prisoner by state paid
psychiatrists; the fear inherent in
being a Black Man guarded by
people all trained in using
weapons, and generally embracing
a creed, an ideology just now
being attacked by Chicanos,
Blacks, Asians, even Jews and an
ever growing legion of former
Europeans—called White people
by some.

My mind, my movie, contains
vivid memories of the hate, gang
rapes, guard-inspired race riots
and murders, food strikes in a
prison, suicides, arrogant
chaplains concerned with soul and
indifferent to my ass, trafficing of
drugs by so-called free people,
guards, 'our keepers.' And the
hoax of being judged for parole
by a clique of ex-narcotic
officials, FBI agents and former
prison wardens. An experience
that should interest some. And as
to those unsympathetic to the
plight of robbers, burglars
murderers and dope fiends, there
is this....
What if a hood had an
intellect... not to compare to
your own, assuredly, but a bit of
intelligence.
As I observe the people in a
four year situation, at minimum,
struggling to get through to cop a
better job, please Mom and Dad
so the bread won't stop, getting
information to protect yourselves

from the world, and so many
other trips I won't editorialize,
the similarity of students and
prisoners in jail is striking. To be
able to predict where to find a
man or woman for years within a
prescribed area is limiting that
individual's freedom if you insist
it be there.
The crumbling of a
bureaucracy, the taint of
corruption in government, men
risking all for power and no
thought of consequences—limited
in their freedom in that the social
order that produced them taught
no alternative to the life style of
their peer group.
The song "The World is a
Ghetto" might be followed
naturally by the World is a Prison
with its ruled class, ruling class
and the guys with the 3.57
magnums and we know who they
work for.
Come then, can we not reason?
Thos of you who are looking for a
hustle in empire you wish to rule
that dies some every day from
Harlem to Wall Street, forgive me,
but split! To the rest who will
come, Welcome!

That I've lived in forced

a half years (assuming, in spite of
my social stigmas, I too was an

the basis for a society usually
curious, if nothing else, about
animal sexuality, to provide me a
platform. Society did not extend
me a platform.
