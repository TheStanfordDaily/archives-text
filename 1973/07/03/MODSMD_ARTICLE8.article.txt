# Protecting Power With Power
## Nixon's Paranoid Climate 
### 
Mark Weaver

Day by day the Watergate
atrocities parade across the TV
screens and newspapers of the
land. And we sit in amazement
wondering what it is all about.
Watergate can best be
understood as a leadership
crisis—somehow Richard Nixon
lost his claim to the loyalty of the
men around him.
It is the essence of Watergate
that Nixon's brand of leadership
fostered the growth of a climate
of reactionary paranoia toward
anything which threatened the
administration's self-deemed
supreme power. This led to tactics
of intimidation and secrecy.
The response to the
publication of the Pentagon
Papers becomes the burglary of
Ellsberg's psychiatrist. The
reaction to a newsman's critical
analysis of the administration is
the FBl's harassment and
investigation of Daniel Schorr.
And we watch in dismay as Mr.
Magruder reveals the inordinate
concern over peace
demonstrations which for him,
legitimated the use of illegal and
repugnant means of surveillance
and control.
Nixon Laid Foundation
By surrounding himself with
men obsessed with protecting
their power with raw power,
Nixon laid the foundation for his
last leadership crisis.
A psyche evolved in the
administration which sanctioned
these actions and the entire
operation carried itself forward as
a result of the members' perceived
acquiescence toward one
another's actions. The corruption
became so extensive and
uncontrollable that it was
destined to be discovered. It so
happened that the Watergate
burglars were the "unlucky" ones.
But the seeds of destruction
had long before been planted. As
long as Nixon, or any other leader
is able to guide his subordinates'
self-interests in harmony with his
own, his leadership is exerted. But
when the separate self-interests
diverge, as they did with McCord,
Magruder, and Dean (when they
began to feel personal injury), the
ability to lead wanes.
Leaders Need Arrogance
Students of leadership
recognize the need of the leader

to present himself with
consistency and an almost
arrogant self-confidence if he
expects to be accorded the
monopoly on Tightness which is
known as authority, and lead
others.
McGovern failed because he
did not know how to play the
game in accordance with these
rules. He alienated the public
which responds only to the way
the game is played and lost many
of his youthful followers who
somehow expected him to buck
the game.
Watergate is the aberration, but
it is indicative of the principles on.
which politics in general is based.
For a leader to maintain a
supra-human image, so that
people follow him, the principle
dictates that he cannot admit of
many of the human errors to
which we are all subject.
Therefore, he must at times lie
and evade and compromise if his
end, however just, is to be
achieved. Dean's testimony hit
home the administration's
manipulative use of symbols such
as "national security" and
"executive privilege" to protect
itself in a jam.
Must Change Game
But perhaps the use of symbols
is the way the political game is
played. If that is the case it is time
we change not only the rules, as
will be the result of Watergate,
but change the nature of the game
itself, its means, values, and goals.
Nixon's mistake was that he
did not anticipate Machiavelli's
dictum: avoid those vices which
will bring you ruin and pursue

those vices which shall bring you
gain-
Unfortunately the political
game is still tailored too closely to
Machiavelli's. Rut imbedded as it
is in human nature I cannot
accept it. I for one will spend
many hours looking for a new
game to play.

began to feel personal injury), the

Leaders Need Arrogance
Students of leadership
recognize the need of the leader

to present himself with
consistency and an almost
arrogant self-confidence if he
expects to be accorded the
monopoly on Tightness which is
known as authority, and lead
others.
McGovern failed because he
did not know how to play the
game in accordance with these
rules. He alienated the public
which responds only to the way
the game is played and lost many
of his youthful followers who
somehow expected him to buck
the game.
Watergate is the aberration, but
it is indicative of the principles on.
which politics in general is based.
For a leader to maintain a
supra-human image, so that
people follow him, the principle
dictates that he cannot admit of
many of the human errors to
which we are all subject.
Therefore, he must at times lie
and evade and compromise if his
end, however just, is to be
achieved. Dean's testimony hit
home the administration's
manipulative use of symbols such
as "national security" and
"executive privilege" to protect
itself in a jam.
Must Change Game
But perhaps the use of symbols
is the way the political game is
played. If that is the case it is time
we change not only the rules, as
will be the result of Watergate,
but change the nature of the game
itself, its means, values, and goals.
Nixon's mistake was that he
did not anticipate Machiavelli's
dictum: avoid those vices which
will bring you ruin and pursue

those vices which shall bring you
gain-
Unfortunately the political
game is still tailored too closely to
Machiavelli's. Rut imbedded as it
is in human nature I cannot
accept it. I for one will spend
many hours looking for a new
game to play.

Day by day the Watergate
atrocities parade across the TV
screens and newspapers of the
land. And we sit in amazement
wondering what it is all about.
Watergate can best be
understood as a leadership
crisis—somehow Richard Nixon
lost his claim to the loyalty of the
men around him.
It is the essence of Watergate
that Nixon's brand of leadership
fostered the growth of a climate
of reactionary paranoia toward
anything which threatened the
administration's self-deemed
supreme power. This led to tactics
of intimidation and secrecy.
The response to the
publication of the Pentagon
Papers becomes the burglary of
Ellsberg's psychiatrist. The
reaction to a newsman's critical
analysis of the administration is
the FBl's harassment and
investigation of Daniel Schorr.
And we watch in dismay as Mr.
Magruder reveals the inordinate
concern over peace
demonstrations which for him,
legitimated the use of illegal and
repugnant means of surveillance
and control.
Nixon Laid Foundation
By surrounding himself with
men obsessed with protecting
their power with raw power,
Nixon laid the foundation for his
last leadership crisis.
A psyche evolved in the
administration which sanctioned
these actions and the entire
operation carried itself forward as
a result of the members' perceived
acquiescence toward one
another's actions. The corruption
became so extensive and
uncontrollable that it was
destined to be discovered. It so
happened that the Watergate
burglars were the "unlucky" ones.
But the seeds of destruction
had long before been planted. As
long as Nixon, or any other leader
is able to guide his subordinates'
self-interests in harmony with his
own, his leadership is exerted. But
when the separate self-interests
diverge, as they did with McCord,
Magruder, and Dean (when they
began to feel personal injury), the
ability to lead wanes.
