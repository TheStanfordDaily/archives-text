Editor:
I was glad to see your editorial
on the tragic death resulting from
a bicycle accident last quarter,
even though it was on page 2 and
the second article in the column.
How much more impact on the
public the article on bicycle
dangers would have had if it had
been on page one and addressed
directly to the public.
It could have said, for example,
"Bicycle accidents can be deadly.
One man riding without lights at
night on the wrong side of the
street was killed in a bicycle
collision last quarter."
This is a matter of public
information and understanding.
What better role is there for a
newspaper. Why insist on
institutional supervision,
especially when institutional
supervision is so onerous if people
are not aware of the reason for it?
