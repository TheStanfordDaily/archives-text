REPORT ON STUDENT
DISCIPLINARY ACTION
A student admitted to charges that lie violated the
Honor Code by submitting a paper in which he plagia
rized extensively from a published work.
Charged two days before he was to have graduated,
the student requested that the Dean of Student Affairs
hear the case. The dean indicated he would have recom
mended suspension for two quarters, but in light of
mitigating factors which the dean regarded as penalty
already experienced by the student, the recommended
penalty was reduced to one quarter only. The student's
degree will be withheld until the end of the summer
quarter.
