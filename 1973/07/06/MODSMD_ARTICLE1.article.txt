# Escondido Residents Delighted With Center
## 
### ELLEN SWANBERG 
After more than nine months of
construction, the Escondido Village
Community Center officially opened
yesterday, to favorable response from
residents.
The building, located on Escondido
Road across from Bing Nursery school,
will be used principally as a recreation
and meeting place for Escondido
Village residents, mostly married
students. It contains 3500 square feet
of large and small meeting rooms, a
kitchen, and an office.
Activities planned for the center
vary, according to program
coordinators Evelin Mandel and Cheryl
Faught.
Classes for both adults and children
include dance, cooking, painting,
music, TA and Gestalt couples
workshops, and "exhilarating
exercises." Future activities will
include seminars, lectures, and
hopefully the expansion of the center
as a general resource center for the
University, the coordinators say.
Most of the classes offered this
summer will be free — English classes
for foreign students, for example.
Foreign students comprise 35 percent
of Escondido's population.
Any fees charged will be for special
teacher services.
Nursery School
In addition, Escondido residents
Jeannie Whitehouse and Avis Slater are
organizing a two-session nursery
school to start in the fall. Escondido
has a child population of about 1150,
the median age of which is four. In a
survey last spring, about 250 parents
indicated that they would use child

care facilities at the center.
The center has been sponsored
through the Dean of Student Affairs'
office. According to Faught, it has also
received "very, very helpful"
assistance from the International
Center and the YWCA, "mostly in the
areas of manpower, ideas, and
organization."
The three plan to work
cooperatively in the future. Fought
added, "We are ready to work with
any campus organization" as well.
Funds for the $120,000 Center
came from village rental fees, the
