# Ombudsman Recommends Changes For Student Grievance Procedures
## 
### 
Ombudsman Harvey Hall
suggested in his annual report that
academic grievance procedures for
students be revised, publicized
and streamlined.
Hall noted that the procedures,
instituted last year by Provost
William Miller, "are not working
too well" and that they are "time
consuming and discouraging" for
students who want to question
their grades.
At present students must first
consult with their professors, then
with the academic department
chairman, academic dean, and
finally with the dean of graduate
or undergraduate studies if they
feel they have been graded
unfairly.
"I am becoming increasingly
uneasy about a system which
seems to vest final and absolute
authority [over grading] in one
individual who may be party to a
dispute," the former registrar said.

"With something like 2,000
people—including faculty,
teaching assistants, etc.—involved
in the grading process, to assume
that no bias or prejudice will ever
creep in" is not realistic.
Hall considered recommending
a review board, or academic
subcommittee, be established to
hear this kind of grievance, "but
in the end it seemed to me that
this proposed solution—seeming
to suggest that any student who
wanted a C-plus changed to a
B-minus could petition a
committee—would probably
create more problems than it
would solve."
In suggesting added publicity
for the procedures, Hall
recommended wider use of the
University Information Bulletin to
spread the information to
students.
Besides publishing the appeals
process with this informtion, Hall
said professors and TA's should

"be prepared to afford some kind
of impartial review for students
who feel aggrieved and are willing
to document this in writing."
One academic dean said he
would appoint an impartial
hearing officer to make a
recommendation if such a
grievance came to him, Hall
stated.
On another topic the
ombudsman said there appears to
be "very widespread
misunderstanding" of the
academic honor code, and urged
that its basic provisions be more
widely discussed and
disseminated.
