# Hay Fever Worst In Years; Wet Spring Possible Cause
## 
### JODY KATZ 
This year's hay fever season has
been one of the worst in many
years for Californians, according to
Asst. Clinical Medicine Prof.
William J. Sayer.
Regular hay fever sufferers
were hit with more severe

symptoms than usual, and more
people discovered that they were
vulnerable to the disease, Sayer
says. The University allergist made
these conclusions after consulting
with physicians throughout the
state.
But, experts can only speculate
as to the cause for the violent
season. Hay fever has not been
thoroughly researched.
Wet Spring
Sayer believes that the late,
wet spring was largely responsible.
The rains kept plants from
pollinating through the end of
February and early March, so that
when the rains finally broke the
pollen swarmed the air, the
allergist says.
Hay fever is believed to be
caused chiefly by grass pollen in
the western states, and by
ragweed or tree pollen in other
states.
The San Francisco Department
of Public Health defines hay fever
as " hard to avoid or prevent, and
difficult to cure." Antihistamines
are sometimes prescribed for mild
cases. Weekly shots are
administered for others.
More Potent Drug
Sayer has just finished a
preliminary study of the effects of
a more potent antihistamine
recently developed in Europe.
This new drug apparently helps
relieve the symtoms with fewer
side effects, the allergist
concluded.
A surprisingly large proportion
uf hay fever sufferers also came

down with asthma this year.
While hay fever causes the
discomfort of weepy eyes, a
runny nose, wheezing and
sneezing, asthma is more severe
and can lead to death.
Hereditary
Hay fever appears to be passed
on through generations by the
genes.
Sayer notes that 20 percent of
the population was born with a
predisposition to the disease, and
an additional 10 percent with a
"tendency" towards it.
He recommends for those who
suffer from the allergy planning
their vacations to coincide with
the hay fever season, and go above
5000 feet (where the pollen count
is relatively low) or to the shore
where winds come over the ocean,
and not from plants.
