# Prof , GM Construct Versatile Camper Vehicles

### SCOTT FIELDS 
General Motors has been sponsoring a "Mobile
Environment Laboratory" here this year under the
direction of Prof. William Bowman and a chief
General Motors designer, Leland Knight.
The purpose of the lab is to explore new areas in
the design of recreational vehicles. So far two
models have been constructed, including the
"carvan" and the "modular-van." Both may be
used on the road and at home.
Three to five persons may use the carvan as a
recreational vehicle. The van fits into a neat package
which is placed on the top and rear of the car for
traveling. At night, the van is detached and
unpacked, revealing a compact home with a
kitchenette, a combined dinette and bedroom, and a
bathroom with a shower.
'Plugged-In'
The van may be taken off the car at home and
"plugged-in" to the garage to be used as an extra
room. The car is then ready for normal driving
conditions. "The vehicle shouldn't have to sit in the
owner's driveway 11 out of 12 months a year,"
Bowman observes.
The "modular-van" may be used as a commercial
vehicle in addition to recreational. The collapsible
sections offer 6'4" headroom inside the vehicle at
the campsite.
At home the owners may replace the recreation
module with a passenger module or a cargo
compartment for commercial use. The
interchangeable section is in the mid-area of the car,
and the modules are slipped into the space between
the driver and the rear wheels. The modular-van has

front-wheel drive.
"This is an area in which there has basically been
no previous research," Bowman says. He also
stresses that the importance of the project is the
innovative and novel functions performed by the
vehicles.
"It is a new kind of product with a view toward
economy," he continued.
Bowman believes that the vehicle will be
relatively reasonably priced for the consumer. Their
estimated cost ranges between $7000 and $10,000.
He feels this is a low figure for a conventional car
plus an extra room. The vans would cost
approximately half as much per square foot as the
recreational vehicles on the road today.
During spring quarter, five graduate students
were involved with the design of the vehicles along
with Bowman and Knight. Each student was
responsible for a different part of the module.
Details
Although the project will continue during the
summer, no students are involved. Knight will be
resolving several engineering details for both models.
GM executives will be here visiting when the
project is completed, probably sometime later this
summer. After this visit, the developers will know
whether the project will continue, and how much
impact their work will have on the recreation
vehicle market.
"We would like it to have a lot of impact,"
Bowman says."The recreation vehicle market is
rising enormously and predictions are that it will
become a major area of interest and consumer
purpose."

The purpose of the lab is to explore new areas in
the design of recreational vehicles. So far two
models have been constructed, including the
"carvan" and the "modular-van." Both may be
used on the road and at home.
Three to five persons may use the carvan as a
recreational vehicle. The van fits into a neat package
which is placed on the top and rear of the car for
traveling. At night, the van is detached and
unpacked, revealing a compact home with a
kitchenette, a combined dinette and bedroom, and a
bathroom with a shower.
'Plugged-In'
The van may be taken off the car at home and
"plugged-in" to the garage to be used as an extra
room. The car is then ready for normal driving
conditions. "The vehicle shouldn't have to sit in the
owner's driveway 11 out of 12 months a year,"
Bowman observes.
The "modular-van" may be used as a commercial
vehicle in addition to recreational. The collapsible
sections offer 6'4" headroom inside the vehicle at
the campsite.
At home the owners may replace the recreation
module with a passenger module or a cargo
compartment for commercial use. The
interchangeable section is in the mid-area of the car,
and the modules are slipped into the space between
the driver and the rear wheels. The modular-van has

front-wheel drive.
"This is an area in which there has basically been
no previous research," Bowman says. He also
stresses that the importance of the project is the
innovative and novel functions performed by the
vehicles.
"It is a new kind of product with a view toward
economy," he continued.
Bowman believes that the vehicle will be
relatively reasonably priced for the consumer. Their
estimated cost ranges between $7000 and $10,000.
He feels this is a low figure for a conventional car
plus an extra room. The vans would cost
approximately half as much per square foot as the
recreational vehicles on the road today.
During spring quarter, five graduate students
were involved with the design of the vehicles along
with Bowman and Knight. Each student was
responsible for a different part of the module.
Details
Although the project will continue during the
summer, no students are involved. Knight will be
resolving several engineering details for both models.
GM executives will be here visiting when the
project is completed, probably sometime later this
summer. After this visit, the developers will know
whether the project will continue, and how much
impact their work will have on the recreation
vehicle market.
"We would like it to have a lot of impact,"
Bowman says."The recreation vehicle market is
rising enormously and predictions are that it will
become a major area of interest and consumer
purpose."
