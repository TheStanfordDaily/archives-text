# ANNUAL REPORT OF THE UNIVERSITY OMBUDSMAN
## 
### 
I. INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS
Although this is called an annual report, it really
should be regarded as the third and concluding part of a
overall report, the first two sections of which were
issued as quarterly reports following the fall quarter and
following the winter quarter. There were sections
included earlier which gave the background of the office
and something of the philosophy of the incumbent
Ombudsman concerning his conduct of the office. These
will not be repeated here. Similarly, in each of the two
earlier reports there were included a number of
"vignettes" designed to show the University community
some examples of the kinds of matters that were
brought to the Ombudsman's Office and suggest how
they came out—some successfully from the
complainant's point of view, and some not; mostly
meritorious from the Ombudsman's point of view, but
not all. Now that the academic year is over there does
not seem to be much point to including more of these
sample situations here.
The Ombudsman's purposes are well stated by
Howard Ray Rowland in his book, The Campus
ombudsman.
"The Campus Ombudsman's immediate objective
is to help individual students resolve problems
created by the Institution. His long-range goal is to
detect patterns of complaints and to influence
changes needed to prevent their recurrence. Even
if he is only partially successful in pursuing these
ends, he diminishes student dissatisfaction toward
the institution. 1
I agree with this and hope the office will be
continued here indefinitely. Parenthetically, I agree with
Rowland and others who observe that an ombudsman
can only be successful in a school which has a sound
administrative structure to begin with and administrators
in the structure who want to make the system work to
the benefit of all members of the community.
The key word to the style in which the office has
been conducted this year is informality. I hope we have
made it easy for people to come to this office and
express their complaints and make their requests for
information. The kind of ombudsman's office described
in the following paragraph does not seem worth having:
"The President did establish what he called
'minimum ground rules' which curtailed the
ombudsman's effectiveness. Students were
required to exhaust all channels for redress and
grievances before appealing to the ombudsman.
Furthermore, the president expressed the hope
that the ombudsman would never need to be used.
The ombudsman, himself, added another
limitation by devising a complicated form
requiring a detailed description of each grievance
and chronological account of previous appeals.
Two years after his appointment this ombudsman
reported that he had 'very little business.' "
Stanford's Ombudsman requires only that the
complainant identify himself. Of course he takes notes
on what the complainant has to say, but written reports
are not required. Thereafter, the Ombudsman
customarily explores the matter by going to the offices
of the people involved.

11. THE YEAR IN REVIEW-STATISTICAL
SUMMARY
The kinds and frequency of matters brought to the
Ombudsman continued at about the same level from
quarter to quarter although there was a small increase in
the number of matters each quarter. Members of all
ethnic groups in the community and both sexes sought
the assistance of the Ombudsman, but the matters they
brought were the same kinds of cases that other people
brought; that is, there were very few matters where
sexual or racial discrimination was a central issue.
Similarly, political matters have not been brought to
the Ombudsman. This experience is echoed in the
reports of ombudsmen elsewhere. As a passjng observa
tion, the Ombudsman considers that he has been most
successful in what are essentially bureaucratic matters
and probably least successful in dealing with personnel
matters and others where the problem centrally involves
interpersonal relations.
The accompanying statistical summary shows the
number of cases quarter by quarter, kind of individual
seeking assistance, and subject category of the com
plaint.
111. A REVIEW OF ThS CHARGE TO THE OMBUDS
MAN AND SUGGESTIONS FOR REVISION
In summary, this section of the report recommends
that the charge to the ombudsman be revised to reflect
the change in actual operation, which is now independ
ent of the Committee of Fifteen.
The full text of these proposed changes, which
include appointment and renewal, administrative ar
rangement, and method of operation, is available on
request from my office.
IV. GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE
ROLE OF THE OMBUDSMAN
Rowland's book on The University Ombudsman lists
18 points as a kind of "yardstick" for this office.
Stanford's practices generally concur with his recom
mendations.
If the workload of the office increases, it probably
should be made full time. Rowland suggests that the
initial appointment should be for a two-year term, a
change which I believe would be an improvement here.
Rowland believes that decisions about continuing the
office should be based on a systematic sampling of
students. That practice also might well be adopted by
Stanford, including a sample of those who have con
sulted the office and those who have not done so, among
faculty, staff, and administration, as well as students.
A more detailed comparison of the Rowland stand
ards and Stanford's practices is available on request from
my office.
V. SOME ISSUES WHICH NEED ATTENTION
Most of these are not new, but I mention them here
because I think they are matters which should get some
attention next year.
1. Academic grievances (faculty-student). On March
2, 1972, Provost William Miller addressed a memo
randum to Lincoln Moses, dean of graduate studies, and
James Gibbs, dean of undergraduate studies, assigning
them responsibility in the matter of faculty-student
academic grievances and outlining a chain of appeals
through which students could and should proceed.
I have reviewed this matter with Provost Miller and
Deans Moses and Gibbs, and I must conclude that the
procedure is not working too well. In the matter of
disputed grades, for example, in some grievances which
have been brought to me I have tried different ap
proaches. In one case I talked to the student, talked to
the instructor, T.A., and others involved and then tried
to come up with some recommendation. In other cases I
have simply described to the students what the grievance
procedure is and advised them to use it. The four-step
procedure (Professor to Department Chairman to Aca
demic Dean to Dean of Graduate or Undergraduate
Study) is time consuming and discouraging, and not
many students pursue it to its end.
In any event I am becoming increasingly uneasy
about a system which seems to vest final and absolute
authority in these matters in one individual who may be
party to a dispute. ("The instructor is the ultimate
arbiter of grades in the course." Information Bulletin,
1973 p. 30.) With something like 2,000 people (including
faculty, teaching assistants, etc.) involved in the grading
process, to assume that no bias or prejudice will ever
creep in is just not a good assumption in any group of
2,000 human beings.
I considered recommending that a board of review,
perhaps a Sub-committee of the Committee on Aca
demic Appraisal and Achievement be established for this

purpose, but in the end it seemed to me that this
proposed solution (seeming to suggest that any student
who wanted a C+ changed to a B- could petition a
committee) would probably create more problems than
it would solve.
1 hope that Provost Miller's grievance procedure will
serve students who feel that they are victims of bias or
prejudice. I recommend that this procedure be published
in the Information Bulletin. One dean suggested that if
such a grievance were brought to him, he would appoint
an impartial hearing officer to make a recommendation
to him. Others should be prepared to afford some kind
of impartial review for students who feel aggrieved and
are willing to document this in writing.
2. Bicycle control In my quarterly report following
last winter quarter, 1 wrote a gentle editorial suggesting a
little more self-discipline on the part of bicycle riders.
Not very much seems to have happened.
We now have the unique and unhappy distinction of
being almost the only place in the world where a fatal
bicycle-to-bicycle accident occurred. It is now clear that
we do need regulation, at least to the extent of enforcing
existing laws such as stopping for stop signs and having
visible lights at night.
There are not many places that have the concentra
tion of bicycles that we have, and this is proper for the
distances here are such that bicycles are a natural and
logical means of locomotion. To think that we can
continue our present chaotic practice of having bicycles
go anywhere anytime intermingling with pedestrian and
auto traffic is nonsense. 1 know that Director of Police
Services Herrington, who conducted an excellent
enforcement campaign at Davis before he came here, is
aware of the problem and is prepared to do something
about it. I hope he receives the support that he will
need.
3. The Honor Code. 1 think the Honor Code is one of
our finest traditions at Stanford and I hate to see it
eroded. There seems to be evidence of very widespread
misunderstanding about it now.
There is some objection to the fact that students
sometimes have to sign a commitment on blue books,
other times they do not. The practice should be consist
ent. Is it all right for instructors to use proctors in their
examinations if they want to? Or is that contrary to the
Honor Code? Is it all right for students to wander in and
out of examinations as they wish, or is it consistent with
the Honor Code to require them to stay where the
examination is being administered?
How arc students now informed of the Honor Code?
How are faculty informed about the Honor Code? These
and other questions need to be answered, and the
answers widely disseminated.
4. Uniform Library fines and fees. I believe I have
said something about this in an earlier report but I do
not know what if any progress has been made. I think
there should be a uniform code of fines and fees for the
several University Libraries. I think each Library should
have its own appeals mechanism within the system to
provide for students who feel they are being treated
unjustly.
5. Biocides. I am not sure that this is an immediate
issue. As I understand it, the Committee on Health and
Safety chaired by Dr. James McClenahan is appointing a
three-man advisory group to assit the University Safety
Officer in maintaining appropriate standards in the use
of biocides on the Campus. It is a matter which warrants
continued attention. In a period when humans are
becoming aware of the vast injuries they have done to
their environment, people in a presumably enlightened
community like this University are going to be particu
larly indignant about the use of destructive materials.
6. Concerning Holds on transcripts and Holds on
registration. Although I have not had individual com
plaints about unjust Holds, I am very sensitive to this
whole problem because of my previous responsibility
here. I want to record the fact that I still do not think it
is appropriate to withhold transcripts for prior obliga
tions to the University if the student is willing to pay the
dollar fee which we advertise as the cost of a transcript.
I do not think Holds should be placed on registration
for a minor matter such as a Library fine with an
additional bill for not paying the fine on time. A paper
on this and related subjects which I prepared for a
meeting of California Ombudsmen last January is avail
able on request.
VI A RETROSPECTIVE LOOK AT '72 73
First of all, I think we must ask the questions: Where
First of all, I think we must ask the questions: Where
did we go wrong? What did wc miss? What things did we
not do that we should have done? Did we overdo some
things?
I. I think there were some situations in which we did

not act soom enough perhaps were not involved soon
enough. An example ot this is the matter during the
winter quarter when telephones were summarily re
moved from certain fraternities and independent houses.
While it is true that there was administrative justifica
tion tor this going back to agreements made when
telephones on the University switchboard were installed
in these houses and including the crowding of the
switchboard so that operational departments of the
University needed the extensions which were being used
by some ot the houses, the timing of the operation and
the manner in which it was carried out left much to be
desired. Earlier involvement by the Ombudsman or
taster action by the Ombudsman might have helped
avoid some ot the hostility and ill feeling which devel
oped.
2. I still ponder this problem: When a complainant
brings a matter to him where can the Ombudsman most
usefully start his investigation? With a vice president?
With someone at the front desk'.' Or somewhere in the
middle? I have made mistakes by starting too high in the
establishment, with someone too removed from the
situation. Such a person is likely to ask for a written
report from his staff; what lie gets may well be a
self-serving and defensive statement of the situation. On
the other hand, the people with the very hardest jobs,
those on the front line with students, are likely to
consider any approach from the Ombudsman as a kind
of attack.
The best place seems to be one cut above the level
where the precipitating incident occurs someone with
responsibility in the matter, with authority to change
things if he or she thinks a change is in order, and a
firsthand knowledge of the way things are and ought to
be. Still, the idea of "going over my head" is something
that I guess no one likes in any organization so that
there seems to be no perfect way in which to proceed.
3. Should there be more self-initiated matters? I
believe it is desirable for the Ombudsman to look for
matters in the University community which seem to
need some kind of remedy and to call these to the
attention of the appropriate University officer. However,
I can merely echo the experience of my predecessors: as
long as the job is part-time the Ombudsman is not likely
to have much time for this.
As a related matter the Ombudsman should try to
dctect patterns ot complaint in order to- make recom
mendations leading to modification of the sources of
difficulty. There has been some of this as in the matter
of clusters of complaints about parking, about dogs
running loose on the campus, about bicycles-but not
enough. Another is the appropriate manner of appeal for
students who have academic grievances against their
instructors, particularly in the matter of grading. I am
trying to pursue this matter.
4. Do we have enough materials in the Ombudsman's
Office to supply needed information? I believe we have
made a diligent effort to build up materials on such
subjects as regulations concerning Escondido Village,
housing, dormitories, the rules of the draw, various
grievance procedures, minutes of ASSU, etc. But there
probably is still some material that eludes us and until
we arc on everybody's mailing list in the University we
probably will be missing something that we should know
about. I think on the whole it is less expensive for us to
decide what we don't need and throw that in the
wastebasket than to continue going around requesting
things that we hear about through the Daily or some
other way.
5. Did we follow enough on the matters that were
brought to us? I guess I don't believe that we did. We did
not always know just how things came out. We were to
some extent inhibited here by the feeling that people
whose problems were solved didn't want to be bothered
anymore. However, I think we shall be a little more
vigilant in following through to find out just exactly
what happened in all situations in which we get involved.
I hope that the administrators and others with whom we
deal will not just take care of matters but will phone us
or drop us a line and let us know how they took care of
the problem.
Finally, on a personal note, I want to comment that I
thought I entered into this job with one important
asset that I did know quite well most of the University
and many of the people who work here. During this year
I hope I have learned something about the most expedi
tious and helpful way to move around in this complex
setting on behalf of those who come here. I hope that a
call from the Ombudsman will not provoke a wholly
defensive reaction, a kind of "Oh, no, not again!"
response but that there will be a continuing feeling that
we can work together to make a good University serve
its constituencies better.
