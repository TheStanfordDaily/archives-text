# The 						Happiest Music In The World'
## PHJB Jazz Delights Young And Old 
### JAY HARLOW 
The Preservation Hall Jazz
Band (PHJB), the greatest living
example of original New Orleans
jazz, opened its seventh annual
summer visit to Stanford Tuesday
night before a full house in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The audience, which included
old friends and fans of the PHJB
as well as kids who have never
heard this type of jazz, was
obviously delighted.
Led by trumpeter DeDe Pierce
and his wife Billie on piano and
vocals, the band plays with a spirit
and enthusiasm that belies the age
of its members, some of whom are
in their 80s.
Billie and DeDe began the first
set alone, playing a nice blues. On
this and later blues pieces,
including "St. James Infirmary"
and"St. Louis Blues," Billie's

singing and her own lyrics were on
a par with the classics of Bessie
Smith.
Old And New Styles
Some of the numbers were of
more recent styles—such as "Hello
Dolly" and one early swing-style
boogie woogie—but most of the
band's music is authentic early
New Orleans jazz. One or two
songs were originals sung by DeDe
in Gombo, a Creole French dialect
of Louisiana.
Trombonist Jim Robinson is
the band's cheerleader, and he
frequently starts the audience
clapping along with the music.
Unfortunately, this sometimes
happens during someone else's
solo. But his playful spirit and
excellent playing add enough to
the band to make up for it.
Willie Humphrey is simply the
best living jazz clarinetist I have

heard. Whether it is mournful
blues or light, up-tempo music, his
playing is always exactly right.
Memorable Solo
Especially impressive was his
solo in "St. Louis Blues." In
addition, he sang and danced on
"Eliza Jane," an old standard
call-and-answer song.
Drummer "Cie" Frazier backs
up the band quite well, and his
solos are short and tasteful. Allan
Jaffe, founder of Preservation
Hall, fills in the bottom on tuba.
On song after song, the band
starts with one of the soloists
stating the theme, followed by the
other solos, then coming back
together for a stand-up finish,
often playing several choruses.
With the rhythm and bass in the
background, the clarinet, trumpet,
and trombone contrast and blend
perfectly.
New Orleans Roots
One of the traditional closing
numbers, "Just a Closer Walk
With Thee," goes back to the
roots of jazz, the black marching
bands in New Orleans funerals. In
the funeral procession and at the
cemetery, the band plays dirges,
but once outside the cemetery,
the mood changes to one of
joyous celebration as the deceased
is sent on his way to heaven.
"Closer Walk With Thee"
begins slowly, with Humphrey

playing his most beautiful solo.
Then it breaks, and the parade is
on.
After this song, the band
begins to leave the stage, and is
met with a standing ovation.
Everybody knows they won't get
away without "When the Saints
Go Marchin' In." Sure enough, it
begins, with Humphrey marching
out into the audience. He leads
the spontaneous parade up and
down the aisles, in and out of the
hall, and back up onto the stage.
'Honorary Citizens'
Following the performance,
their 50th at Stanford, the band
was presented with gifts and a
certificate honoring the occasion,
naming the members of the band
"honorary citizens of the
Stanford community."
The Preservation Hall Jazz
Band will have five more
performances at Stanford, at 8
and 10 p.m. tonight and
tomorrow, and a special outdoor
picnic performance next Saturday
at 6 p.m. in Frost Amphitheater.
In addition, they will appear at
Berkeley and Stern Grove in Sar/
Francisco before leaving the Bay
Area. So everyone should have a
chance to hear the happiest music
in the world played by the
greatest living New Orleans jazz
band.

CHEERLEADER—The strong, gusty trombone playing of spirited Preservation Hall Jazz Band trombonist
"Big Jim" Robinson (far left) belies the fact that he's really 81 years old. The PHJB "youngsters" gave
their fiftieth Stanford performance last Tuesday night.
