# Comedy, Swamp Music Describe Everyday Life

### DAN FORTE 
SAN FRANCISCO - One good
way to judge a comedian is by
whether or not he is still funny
the second or third time through.
Have you ever bought a comedy
album and felt like throwing it
away after the second hearing, no
matter how funny it was the first
time?
I saw Robert Klein twice last
week at the Boarding House in
San Francisco (June 28 and 30). I
also own his new LP, "Child of
the Fifties." And even though I
have played it several times, I still
find it fresh and funny.
Robert Klein is of the "new
breed" of comedian who, rather
than telling snappy one-liners,
talks casually about everyday
things that everyone can easily
identify with. Bill Cosby was one
of the first big successes with this
style of comedy. Throughout
Klein's performances you could
hear people in the audience
saying, "Yeah, that's true."
This was Klein's first
appearance in San Francisco in six
years, and the Boarding House
was packed every night.
Graffiti And Contraceptives
Klein talked about a wide
variety of subjects, including
graffiti, athletes, drugs, foreigners,
and buying contraceptives.
His pet peeve is commercials,
and he poked fun at a wide
variety of products from Raid to
Geritol. Much of his material was

about what it was like to be a
teenager in the fifties. (He was
born in 1942.)
To close his show, Klein, with
the aid of a pianist, sang his own
composition from his new album,
"The Fabulous Fifties." Klein
simulated a fifties vocal group,
singing all the parts himself,
complete with choreography and
a harmonica solo.
Talented Guitarist
Sharing the bill with Klein was
folk singer-guitarist Steve
Goodman, from Chicago.
Short, baby-faced, and chubby,
Goodman hardly looked like your
everyday night club performer.
But he proved to be quite a
talented guitarist, especially on his
opening number, a flat-picking
version of Gershwin's "Oh, Lady
Be Good."
Goodman had a good rapport
with the audience, and did some
nice blues parodies, like
"I-Never-Heard-You-Sing-No
Blues" and "Chicken Cordon
Blue."
Goodman's Tunes
Other songs performed by
Goodman included "You've Got
Your Troubles," "Eight-Ball
Blues," "Yellow Coat," a funny
protest song about embezzler Paul
Powell, and finally the song which
is now paying Goodman's rent,
"City of New Orleans," which
became a big hit when it was
recorded by Arlo Guthrie.
Goodman closed with the
ultimate country song, written by
him and John Prine. Goodman
explained that any self-respecting
country song has to have five
elements: mother, prisons, trucks,
farms, and trains. So, he threw
them all into the last verse:

"Well, ever since my mama
went to prison,
There's nothin''round
this farm
that's been the same.
And, you know when they
let her
out of there last Tuesday,
She drove her goddamn
truck into a train. "

Not much has been heard on
AM radio by Tony Joe White
since the days of "Polk Salad
Annie" and "Roosevelt and Ira
Lee," as was evidenced by the
undersized crowd at the Boarding
House, Saturday, June 8.
But Tony Joe has consistently
turned out good LPs over the
years, despite a few problems with
over-producing.
He appeared at the Boarding
House alone, playing guitar and
harmonica without any back-up
musicians, so his performance was
quite different from his
recordings, and 1,000 times
better.
Tony Joe did acoustic solo
versions of many of his electric
ensemble records. He has a large
and varied repertoire to work
with, most of which are his own
compositions.
His best songs were his
humorous numbers, like "300
Pounds Of Hongry," "Lustful Earl
and The Married Woman," and
"Saturday Night in Oakgrove,
Louisiana," a song about cruising
the Dairy Queen in a pick-up
truck, which I'm sure everyone
can easily identify with.
White has the ability to capture
the everyday life of the younger
generation in his songs, much like
Chuck Berry.

Tony Joe has definitely found
a style all his own; he calls it
"swamp music." Whether he plays
electric rock 'n' roll or acoustic
folk songs, his songs are always
marked by pureness and
simplicity.
New Releases, Old Hits
The audience called out
requests all night long and Tony
Joe tried to fulfill as many as
possible, and also performed new
things which haven't been released
yet, like "California on My Mnd,"
"Lazy," and "Backwoods
Preacher Man."
He closed his first electric
guitar set with "Even Trolls Love
Rock 'n' Roll" and "Polk Salad
Annie." Every sor\g he sang
sounded much better than its wax
counterpart.
After a few acoustic numbers
in the second set, White was
joined by two members of
Creedence Clearwater, Doug
Clifford on drums, and Stu Cook
on bass. This gave Tony Joe a
chance to do some hard-hitting
rock like "Back In The Country"
and "As A Crow Flies," and
Jimmy Reed's blues "Caress Me
Baby."
My favorite song of the evening
was "Rainy Night In Georgia,"
written by Tony Joe and recorded
by Brook Benton. During this
beautiful, acoustic version the
crowd was dead silent.
Because the second act
cancelledout, the Boarding House's
resident pianist, David Paquette,

was moved upstairs for the
week-long engagement.
I hope somebody "important"
discovers this fine artist soon, so
an album of his piano playing will
be released before the public
completely forgets what real
boogie woogie is all about.
