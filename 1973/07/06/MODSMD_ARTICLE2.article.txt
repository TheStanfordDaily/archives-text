### MARK SIMONIAN 
Grievance hearings in the dispute between fired
Student Center for Innovation in Research and
Education (SCIRE) Director W. Ron Jones and *
Dean of Undergraduate Studies James L. Gibbs
ended Tuesday with important testimony from
Jones, Gibbs and Asst. Dean B. Michael Closson.
Jones, representing himself, outlined SCIRE's
relationship with Gibbs and Closson as "a chain of
command," with the deans concerned with "doing
your duty" and "not very worried about
innovation."
In his own testimony, the ex-SCIRE director
criticized Gibbs as "a dean who didn't include me in
his staff' and characterized Closson as a "chief"
who only served "the bureaucracy" and who often
stormed out of SCIRE Policy Board meetings
without discussing SCIRE's problems.
Jones and arbiter Eva Robbins clashed early in
the session, as Robbins warned Jones to "stay
relevant" to his case rather than explain each
intricate detail of the relationship between SCIRE
and the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies (ODUS).
No Lecture
Robbins interrupted Jones several times during
his testimony stating once, "I don't want a lecture
on University structure, Mr. Jones."
University attorney Jerry Halligan, representing
Gibbs and Closson, declined to cross-examine Jones
and began the University's case in the afternoon
session. Halligan called Gibbs as his first witness.
Jones had "great difficulty functioning within
the administrative roles" of his job, Gibbs testified.
He cited "a lack of development of proposals
submitted to the Policy Board" as part of the
ex-director's "lack of adequate performance."
Jones Approves Job
Gibbs pointed out that Jones' job was clearly
delineated by the new SCIRE charge, adopted by
the Faculty Senate in January, and approved by
Jones in November.

"Ron was clear, almost from the beginning, of
his responsibilities under the new charge," Gibbs
claimed.
Gibbs directly blamed Jones for creating friction
between the Policy Boarfl and ODUS.
"Ron had a tendency to polarize the issues,"
Gibbs stated. He said Jones viewed SCIRE as
"flexible, open to student ideas" while he saw
ODUS as "bureaucratic, interested only in
procedure."
"That good guy, bad guy image" was
"detrimental to our working relationship,"
according to Gibbs.
Daily Meetings
Gibbs assessed his role in SCIRE as
"judgmental." The Dean of Undergraduate Studies
is responsible for upholding "explicit standards" for
accreditation according to Gibbs.
He claimed he had been in close contact with
SCIRE through Closson, and that Closson had
"day-to-day" meetings with the Policy Board.
Under Jones' cross-examination Gibbs stated he
had relied almost entirely on Closson to inform him
about SCIRE's activities and to convey his official
policy statements to the SCIRE Board.
Short Meeting
The dean said his one meeting with the Board
came in April, lasted less than an hour, and came
after Closson's recommendation that Gibbs fire
Jones.
Gibbs said, however, that he had met several
times with Policy Board members individually and
that he had solicited written statements from board
members for their opinions on Closson's
recommendation.
Through the extensive cross-examination, Gibbs
maintained he had not finalized his decision to fire
Jones until after he had mei with the Policy Board.
However, Jones pointed out that Gibbs made his
decision only one week after Closson submitted his

recommendation and less than one day after he met
with the Board.
Deadline Missed
Closson testified that 14 of 40 SCIRE courses
last fall did not have the required sponsor's
statement and that Jones submitted four courses
between four and 11 days after Gibbs' deadline for
fall quarter.
The assistant dean said Jones was "very talented,
but in the wrong job. He didn't take his duties of
academic administration seriously. Rather than
comply with regulations, he would evade them."
During cross-examination, Closson admitted that
although he had read a detailed report on SCIRE's
activities and future plans, he did not remember the
specifics of the report. He also conceded he had not
discussed its contents with either Gibbs or Jones.
After the University completed its case, Robbins
refused to hear closing statements from either side,
indicating she had already heard enough to make
her decision.
She will first decide whether Jones' appointment
was for one or two academic years. Only if she finds
that the University hired Jones for two years will
she consider whether Gibbs had the right to fire
Jones.
Quick Decision
The arbiter said she would make her decision "as
quickly as I can" but certainly within the required
30 days.
After the hearing, Gibbs and Jones shook hands
and politely discussed the future of SCIRE. Both
stressed that SCIRE should remain within the
University.
Under advice from Halligan, Gibbs refused to
comment on the hearings.
Jones said the two-day proceedings "went well.
I'm very pleased, to be honest," he said later.
When Robbins asked Jones where she could send
her decision, Jones replied with his address at the
SCIRE office.
"I'll be around," he said.
