# Marine World Concert Audience Warms Up To Jesse Colin Young
## 
### JOHN ROBERTSON 
MARINE WORLDâ€”Last Saturday night, if you recall,
was a bit on the chilly side, and a good night to
cuddle up to your favorite stereo system with a
crackling fire nearby.
Nevertheless, a near-capacity crowd braved the
weather and took in Jesse Colin Young and Joy of
Cooking at Marine World's first concert of the
summer.
With cries like "What happened to the summer?"
and "Anybody got an extra scarf?" being shouted
towards the stage, Jesse Colin Young appeared and
tried warming the audience with a repertoire of his
hits. Young's act reached a climax during a
20-minute version of "Ride the Wind."
All the members of his group used nothing but
drums, sticks and bongs to make noise, and Young
had the audience looking around for African natives
to attack Marine World's Jungle Theater Under the
Stars.
After a loud and long standing ovation, Young
finished with a song about whiskey and vicariously
warmed the crowd's innards.
Following an intermission which included an
appropriate announcement that Cold Blood would

be appearing later in the month, Joy of Cooking
tried cooking without one of its tastier ingredients,
writer and vocalist Toni Brown, but failed to find
the recipe.
Joy of Cooking started things off with "Don't
the Moon Look Fat and Lonesome?" and sure
enough, it did.
Terry Garthwaite tried to cover for Brown's
absence, but their contrasting styles made that an
impossibility.
Garthwaite, with her screeching and throaty
voice, could have passed for either a female Edgar
Winter or a slim Janis Joplin.
Sadly, for those Joy of Cooking fans of the past,
today's "Cooking" has little to offer. It's at a time
like this when a group has an obligation to change
its name, and why "Cooking" doesn't do this is
probably a matter of finances.
What "Cooking" lacked without Brown's
presence they made up in playing time, and the
concert lasted well into the night.
All in all, just about everyone enjoyed
themselves. As I was leaving, however, I did notice
some disgruntled looks coming from the nearby
seals that had been kept awake and away from their
much-needed beauty sleep.
