# Port Costa Delivers Operatic Comedy Spiced With Exceptional Acting Talent

### DOUG SMITH 
BERKELEY—The Port Costa
Players' production of "Don
Pasquale," performed in Hertz
Hall on the Cal Berkeley campus
last Saturday evening, is one of
the funniest comedies I have ever
seen on stage.
Donizetti's comic opera is
inherently thoroughly
entertaining, but the Port Costa
cast made it a rare evening of
laughs with their superb acting.
The music itself was right behind
the dramatic presentation in
excellence.
"Don Pasquale" is a parody of
Italian romantic opera, a genre in
which Donizetti produced over 70

works. Thus he is essentially
laughing at his own conventions
when a singer repeats a short
phrase ad infinitum, soars
endlessly up and down scales, or
runs out of breath on an extended
cadence. The characters also
frequently insert ironic asides or
tell each other to stop saying such
ridiculous things.
The drama is in the old opera
buffa tradtion: Rich, aging Don
Pasquale decides to marry in order
to disinherit his nephew Emesto,
who wants to marry the pretty
but poor Norina. Doctor
Malatesta plays a trick on the Don
by "marrying" Norina, disguised
as Malatesta's sister,to the Don.

As soon as they are "married,"
Norina turns into a spendthrift
shrew and makes Don Pasquale
regret he had committed himself
to the institution. At this point
Norina's real identity is revealed
and she marries Emesto with the
Don's blessing.
Delightful Acting
John Duykers, founder of the
Players and stage director of this
production, has coaxed
professional caliber acting out of'
these young singers. Thomasa
Eckert as Norina was a standout.
Her eyes and facial expressions
were a continuous delight as she
played her coquettish role.
Richard Wagner as Malatesta
the practical joker and Tom
Acord as lovelorn Ernesto were
perfectly convincing. Stanford's
Marc Clemens at first acted a bit
too handsome and virile to
portray a 65-year-old with a cane,
but he settled into his part as the
opera progressed.
Duykers created a drama to
frame the opera by having the two
servants wind up the other
characters like mechanical dolls
during the overture. This was an
ingenious stroke to make the
overture, played on the piano, as
interesting as the rest of the

opera. At the end of the evening
the "dolls" took mechanical
bows.
Piano Accompaniment
Of course I would rather have
heard an orchestra as the
accompaniment, but John
Aschenbrenner was fine on the
piano and deserves a great deal of
credit for his musical direction.
Thomasa Eckert has a lovely,
bright soprano voice and she
handled her elaborate part with
considerable agility. Her only
weaknesses were in the fastest
coloratura passages and at the
very top of her range.
Marc Clemens sang his buffo
baritone role with perfect comic
finesse. Wagner's Malatesta was
very strong, and Tom Acord
bleated appropriately with his
light tenor voice.
Effective Jokes
Diction was excellent in all
parts, so that the audience got
virtually all of the jokes.
All in all, the evening was a
great success, and the Port Costa
Players are certainly an opera
company to watch in the future.
But I wonder if I can ever take
Lucia di Lammermoor seriously
again.

GET THE POlNT?—Three of the four Pointer Sisters, who started singing gospel music under the tutelage
of their father, performed last weekend at the Circle Star Theater with Cheech and Chong. Ruth, the
missing sister, was undergoing surgery in a San Francisco hospital.
