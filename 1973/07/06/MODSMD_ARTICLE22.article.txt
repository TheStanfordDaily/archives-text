# Cheech And Chong Attract Teenyboppers

### DAN FORTE 
SAN CARLOS-While watching
Cheech and Chong, I wondered
what guys like Lenny Bruce
possibly could have done to get
busted for that Cheech and
Chong didn't do or say. In all
likelihood, Cheech and Chong go
farther into obscene and risque
material than any other
contemporary comedians,
certainly any that would be
playing at the Circle Star Theater.
A large percentage of Cheech
and Chong's audience at the Circle
Star, last Friday night, June 19,
were 13-15 year-olds. I wonder
how many of that age group
would have been there if Cheech
and Chong's comedy albums were
a clearer indication of their live
act.
Not that their earthy material

would keep fourteen year olds
away; no doubt even more would
come to see them if they knew
what to expect. But, I wonder if
their parents would be dropping
them off at the front door if they
knew more about Cheech and
Chong.
Their set of "hard rock
comedy" consisted mainly of
three subjects: dope, sex, and
masturbation. One bit consisted
of an interview with the
masturbation champion of the
world, a hunchback named Harry
Palms.
Cheech and Chong are the type
of act that will make you laugh
for an hour, and then walk away
shaking your head and saying,
"Those guys are gross."
Their funniest sketch was
"Unamerican Bandstand," with

host Layed Back, country singer
Red Neck (who sang "The First
Time I Seen Her"), disc-jockey
"Right On" Washington (of
ASOL, San Francisco), blues
singer Blind Melon Chitlin, a
commercial for "Tie-Dye
Tampax," and a dance contest
winner performing the "Cabacho
Stomp."
For their encore, Cheech and
Chong did their bit about two
dogs, which I didn't think was all
that funnv.
Preceeding Cheech and Chong
were three-fourths of The Pointer
Sisters, of Oakland.
Most of the Pointers' songs
were either soul or jazz-scat
singing, largely influenced by
Lambert, Hendricks, and Ross.
The Pointer Sisters appear
wearing fortyish hair styles and

slightly-past-the-knees dresses.
Each held a handkerchief in one
hand.
All in all, I thought their act
was too stagey; the type of thing
that might be appropriate in a
Broadway show, but not in a
concert or a night club.
They sang several songs from
their new LP on Blue Thumb, like

"Yes We Can Can," "Jada," and
"The Way I Feel, You Know."
They also sang two more or
less "straight" songs, not
overdone or dragged-out like the
rest. These were Howlin' Wolf's
"Wang Dang Doodle" and an old
gospel tune, "Grinning In Your
Face," and proved to be the best
numbers of the set.

their new LP on Blue Thumb, like

"Yes We Can Can," "Jada," and
"The Way I Feel, You Know."
They also sang two more or
less "straight" songs, not
overdone or dragged-out like the
rest. These were Howlin' Wolf's
"Wang Dang Doodle" and an old
gospel tune, "Grinning In Your
Face," and proved to be the best
numbers of the set.
SAN CARLOS-While watching
Cheech and Chong, I wondered
what guys like Lenny Bruce
possibly could have done to get
busted for that Cheech and
Chong didn't do or say. In all
likelihood, Cheech and Chong go
farther into obscene and risque
material than any other
contemporary comedians,
certainly any that would be
playing at the Circle Star Theater.
A large percentage of Cheech
and Chong's audience at the Circle
Star, last Friday night, June 19,
were 13-15 year-olds. I wonder
how many of that age group
would have been there if Cheech
and Chong's comedy albums were
a clearer indication of their live
act.
Not that their earthy material

would keep fourteen year olds
away; no doubt even more would
come to see them if they knew
what to expect. But, I wonder if
their parents would be dropping
them off at the front door if they
knew more about Cheech and
Chong.
Their set of "hard rock
comedy" consisted mainly of
three subjects: dope, sex, and
masturbation. One bit consisted
of an interview with the
masturbation champion of the
world, a hunchback named Harry
Palms.
Cheech and Chong are the type
of act that will make you laugh
for an hour, and then walk away
shaking your head and saying,
"Those guys are gross."
Their funniest sketch was
"Unamerican Bandstand," with

host Layed Back, country singer
Red Neck (who sang "The First
Time I Seen Her"), disc-jockey
"Right On" Washington (of
ASOL, San Francisco), blues
singer Blind Melon Chitlin, a
commercial for "Tie-Dye
Tampax," and a dance contest
winner performing the "Cabacho
Stomp."
For their encore, Cheech and
Chong did their bit about two
dogs, which I didn't think was all
that funnv.
Preceeding Cheech and Chong
were three-fourths of The Pointer
Sisters, of Oakland.
Most of the Pointers' songs
were either soul or jazz-scat
singing, largely influenced by
Lambert, Hendricks, and Ross.
The Pointer Sisters appear
wearing fortyish hair styles and

slightly-past-the-knees dresses.
Each held a handkerchief in one
hand.
All in all, I thought their act
was too stagey; the type of thing
that might be appropriate in a
Broadway show, but not in a
concert or a night club.
They sang several songs from

"Yes We Can Can," "Jada," and
