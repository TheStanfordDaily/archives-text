# Expert Demonstrates Techniques Here
## Aikido Harmonizes Spirit, Body 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
The Stanford Aikido Club
hosted black belt artist Koichi
Tohei Monday morning in the
Encina Gym. A crowd of almost
100 watched Tohei, one of only
two holders of the lOth-Dan
rating in the world, give a special
class in the techniques of aikido.
Tohei, presently chief
instructor at the World Aikido
Headquarters, or Hombu Dojo, in
Tokyo, came here as part of an
American tour which includes
many stops on the West Coast and
in Hawaii.
According to David Brown, a
member of the Med School staff
and the president of the Stanford
club, Tohei came on this tour "to
help us appreciate the ways of
becoming aware of 'ki' and its
use." "Ki," the second syllable of
aikido, is a Japanese word which
has come to mean "spirit of the
Universe."
Aikido, like yoga, believes in
both a spirit and a body and has
as its purpose the harmonizing, or
bringing together of these two
entities. However, unlike yoga, it
is also a very effective form of
self-defense, somewhat related to
other martial arts such as judo and
karate, but in essence quite
different.

The other two parts of the
compound "aikido" are "ai,"
meaning "to meet or harmonize"
and "do," which means "the
way." Roughly translated then,
aikido means "the way of
harmonizing with the spirit of the
universe."
All living things are part of the
"spirit of the universe" in aikido,
including one's attacker. Thus the
ideal of aikido is not to think of
defeating one's enemy, but rather
to be in harmony with him, both

to the class was in his own words,
"to show how the mind can
control the body and to practice
this control."
Explaining that he was
directing his "ki" forward, he sat
on his heels and asked a student
to push him back. The man
pushed hard but Tohei remained
still. A second student tried and
then the two tried together, but
they were still unable to budge
him.
Anyone who came to the class

to be like a guru or high priest,
but he is instead a warm, friendly
individual who enjoys talking with
others rather than down at them
and seems at peace both with
himself and all around him.
After his visit here, Tohei went
to Seattle. He plans to stop over
in Hawaii later this week before
returning to Japan.
Growing Club
The Stanford club which
hosted Tohei has been in
existence less than a year, but is
already one of the largest clubs on
campus. It was formed largely
through the efforts of Dan
Millman, who coached gymnastics
at Stanford before transferring to
Oberlin last year.
Before the end of the past
school year the number of club
members had reached around 60.
This summer, about 40 are
participating. Durand, who
teaches the class, is a 3rd-Dan or
3rd-degree black belt who has
been practicing the art for 14
years.
The coed classes this summer
are Monday through Friday from
10 a.m. to 12 in the Men's Gym.
Any member of the Stanford
community is invited to attend.
The art of aikido and the
philosophy behind it are not the
sort of thing one learns overnight.
Even Tohei admits that he still has
a ways to go. Nevertheless, aikido
even in its most elementary form
can be beneficial to everybody.
The great advantage aikido
claims is the way in which it can
be applied not only to
self-defense, but also to meeting
and overcoming a great majority
of the problems of everyday life.
The student may learn how to
relax, how to create a smooth and
effective flow of energy, and how
to meet the pressures and problems
of life with a positive approach.

member of the Med School staff
and the president of the Stanford
club, Tohei came on this tour "to
help us appreciate the ways of
becoming aware of 'ki' and its
use." "Ki," the second syllable of
aikido, is a Japanese word which
has come to mean "spirit of the
Universe."
Aikido, like yoga, believes in
both a spirit and a body and has
as its purpose the harmonizing, or
bringing together of these two
entities. However, unlike yoga, it
is also a very effective form of
self-defense, somewhat related to
other martial arts such as judo and
karate, but in essence quite
different.

The other two parts of the
compound "aikido" are "ai,"
meaning "to meet or harmonize"
and "do," which means "the
way." Roughly translated then,
aikido means "the way of
harmonizing with the spirit of the
universe."
All living things are part of the
"spirit of the universe" in aikido,
including one's attacker. Thus the
ideal of aikido is not to think of
defeating one's enemy, but rather
to be in harmony with him, both

to the class was in his own words,
"to show how the mind can
control the body and to practice
this control."
Explaining that he was
directing his "ki" forward, he sat
on his heels and asked a student
to push him back. The man
pushed hard but Tohei remained
still. A second student tried and
then the two tried together, but
they were still unable to budge
him.
Anyone who came to the class

to be like a guru or high priest,
but he is instead a warm, friendly
individual who enjoys talking with
others rather than down at them
and seems at peace both with
himself and all around him.
After his visit here, Tohei went
to Seattle. He plans to stop over
in Hawaii later this week before
returning to Japan.
Growing Club
The Stanford club which
hosted Tohei has been in
existence less than a year, but is
already one of the largest clubs on
campus. It was formed largely
through the efforts of Dan
Millman, who coached gymnastics
at Stanford before transferring to
Oberlin last year.
Before the end of the past
school year the number of club
members had reached around 60.
This summer, about 40 are
participating. Durand, who
teaches the class, is a 3rd-Dan or
3rd-degree black belt who has
been practicing the art for 14
years.
The coed classes this summer
are Monday through Friday from
10 a.m. to 12 in the Men's Gym.
Any member of the Stanford
community is invited to attend.
The art of aikido and the
philosophy behind it are not the
sort of thing one learns overnight.
Even Tohei admits that he still has
a ways to go. Nevertheless, aikido
even in its most elementary form
can be beneficial to everybody.
The great advantage aikido
claims is the way in which it can
be applied not only to
self-defense, but also to meeting
and overcoming a great majority
of the problems of everyday life.
The student may learn how to
relax, how to create a smooth and
effective flow of energy, and how
to meet the pressures and problems
of life with a positive approach.

hosted black belt artist Koichi
Tohei Monday morning in the
Encina Gym. A crowd of almost
100 watched Tohei, one of only
two holders of the lOth-Dan
rating in the world, give a special
class in the techniques of aikido.
Tohei, presently chief
instructor at the World Aikido
Headquarters, or Hombu Dojo, in
Tokyo, came here as part of an
