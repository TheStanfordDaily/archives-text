This is why aikido is sometimes
called the "art of non-resistance."
Its purpose is to protect the self
without inflicting any permanent
physical damage on the attacker.
Tohei's Class
Tohei, or Tohei Sensei as his
students call him (from the
Japanese word for teacher) began
his class Monday with some basic
warm up exercises, similar to those
used by gymnasts and other
athletes, to stretch the muscles
and relax the body.
He followed with some
breathing exercies. About 70
aikido students from the Bay
Area, one-third of whom were
women, took part in the class
with 30 or so others observing.
The most limber of the group
was Tohei himself, a short, stocky
man of 53, who looks to be in his
late 30s. His first demonstration

expecting to see an exhibition of
self-defense only would have been
disappointed. Tohei did a few
judo-like throws at the end of the
class, and did them with a finesse
that showed he had earned the
position he holds, but most of the
hour and a half was spent
practicing "directing the ki."
In another demonstration he
directed his "ki" downward and
asked Frank Durand, the Stanford
instructor, to lift him off the mat.
Even when Tohei stood on one
foot Durand, who stands several
inches taller, was unable to lift
him.
According to Brown,
"Everybody was really high when
Tohei had finished. The whole
gym seemed lit up with good
feeling." Tohei stayed around a
few minutes to talk to the
students and autograph copies of
his book on aikido.
