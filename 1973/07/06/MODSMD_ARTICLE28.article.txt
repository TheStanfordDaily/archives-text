# Mayer's Wimbledon Odyssey-Ends In Defeat By Russian
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Alex "Sandy" Mayer's
Wimbledon odyssey, which swept
him past two seeded players and
into the semifinals, ended
yesterday when the unseeded
Stanford senior lost to
fourth-seeded Alex Metreveli of
the Soviet Union, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3,
6-4.
Metreveli's win sets up an
"all-Iron Curtain" final in the
men's singles division of the
$131,000 Wimbledon Lawn
Tennis Championships tomorrow.
The fourth-seeded Russian star
will play second-seeded Jan Kodes
of Czechoslovakia for the
championship of Great Britain.
Mayer's loss followed brilliant
wins over top-seeded Ilie Nastase
of Romania Saturday and
eighth-seeded Jurgen Fassbender
of West Germany Tuesday.
Mayer rallied from a two-set
deficit to beat Fassbender 3-6,
4-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-4. Earlier this year,
Fassbender had beaten Mayer, a

21 year-old from Wayne, N.J.,
6-1, 6-1.
Forehand Return
In this match, as in the win
over Nastase, Mayer's winning
weapon was his flashy forehand
return of service. Mayer, after
evening the match at two sets-all,
broke Fassbender's serve twice in
the final set with brilliant returns,
overcoming one break of his own
service.

Thus, Mayer became the sole
American to reach the semi-finals.
The other U.S. player to reach the
quarterfinals, Jimmy Connors of
Belleville, 111., lost to Metreveli in
four sets Tuesday.
Most of the world's touring
professionals, including Stan
Smith of the U.S., the world's top
player, boycotted Wimbledon in
protest of the suspension of
Yugoslavia's Nikki Pilic.

However, the field at this, the
world's most prestigious
tournament, was still strong,
headed by Nastase, the world's
second-ranked player, who was
ordered to play by his national
federation.
Mayer came to Wimbledon
virtually unknown internationally,
despite being the 11th ranked
man in the U.S. last year and the
recent winner of the NCAA
singles championship in Princeton,
N.J.
Mayer flew directly to
Winbledon from Princeton, and
immediately began playing on the
fast, skid-prone grass courts. In
contrast, the Princeton courts,
according to Stanford tennis
coach Dick Gould, are extremely
slow.
Crowd Favorite
Mayer became a favorite of the
Wimbledon crowd, which is
generally partial to underdogs.
However, Mayer was not overly
awed by Wimbledon, although he
never boasted he would win the
tourney.
After playing on the
center-court Tuesday, Mayer
lambasted the patchy, dry
condition of the court, and also
seemed irked that he had trouble
getting his parents tickets to the
match.
"I'm not surprised he did so
well," Gould said yesterday.
"Sandy's a world-class player and
he can beat anybody. We're going
to hear quite a bit about him in
the next two-three years."
Gould added that Mayer, along
with Stanford teammates Rick
Fisher and Chico Hagey, plan to
spend the next few weeks playing
in European tournaments. They
then plan to return to the U.S. to
play on the grass court circuit
here, which is climaxed by the
U.S. Open at Forest Hills, N.Y.
After that, Mayer plans to
return to Stanford for his senior
season, although by doing this and
remaining an amateur, he is
forfeiting cash prizes which may
total over ten thousand dollars.
