U.S. Offers Europe Security Plan
HELSINKI, Finland — U.S. Secretary of State William
Rogers outlined a five-point program of U.S. goals to
insure peace at yesterday's session of the 35-nation
European Security Conference.
Rogers declared that U.S. and European security are
indivisible. He asked the conference to approve guarantees
against the use of force in resolving international disputes,
intervention in other nations' internal affairs, and for
greater freedom of travel between east and west.
Police in Helsinki reported the arrest of five men —
four of them American — for distributing anti-Soviet
literature. The men were reportedly protesting Soviet
control over Latvia and Estonia.
'Nixon Didn't Consider Quitting'
SAN CLEMENTE, Calif. — President Nixon never gave
"serious consideration" to resigning because of the
Watergate scandal, a White House spokesman said
yesterday.
Deputy Press Secretary Gerald Warren issued the
statement from the Western White House.
Julie Nixon Eisenhower, the President's younger
daughter, told reporters from the Associated Press and
United Press International earlier in the week that Nixon
brought up the subject during a family weekend at the
Camp David retreat in May.
Warren said that while such family discussions were
held, resignation was never a serious alternative in the
President's mind.
The family discussion took place just after the
resignations of Nixon aides H.R. Haldeman and John
Ehrlichman, both implicated in the scandal.
Eisenhower said the family talked Nixon out of
resigning, telling him that to do so would be an admission
of wrongdoing.
Shockley Asks NAACP Co-operation
STANFORD — Nobel Prize-winning Electrical Engineering
Prof. William Shockley has asked Roy Wilkins, executive
director of the NAACP, to co-operate in research designed
to determine if blacks are genetically inferior to whites.
Shockley asked that 100-200 leading black American
intellectuals submit to blood tests that could be analyzed
scientifically.
Shockley says he thinks such tests would bear out his
hypothesis that a black person's IQ increases about one
point for each percentage of Caucasian ancestry.
HEW Halts Sterilization Funds
WASHINGTON — Health, Education and Welfare
Secretary Caspar Weinberger has ordered an immediate
halt to all federal moneys used for sterilization operations.
Weinberger made the decision after reports that two
girls in Alabama, aged 12 and 14, were sterilized without
proper consent of their parents.
Weinberger directed his department to develop new
guidelines before he will release the funds.
Earlier this week, U.S. Atty. Gen. Elliot Richardson
ordered an investigation into the birth control clinic that
supposedly directed the sterilization.

Krogh Claims Fifth Amendment
LOS ANGELES — Egil (Bud) Krogh, head of the White
House "plumbers unit" designed to plug news leaks, took
the Fifth Amendment before the grand jury here
investigating the break-in of Daniel Ellsberg's
psychiatrist's office.
Krogh, former aide to deposed Presidential adviser
John Ehrlichman, remained in the grand jury room only
five minutes.
Krogh has previously admitted directing the break-in.
Hijacked Airliner Lands In Cuba
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina — An Argentine airliner
hijacked Wednesday with 26 persons aboard has landed
safely in Cuba.
The government-owned Boeing 737 carried some
$700,000 in cash to provide sugar crop loans. No mention
was made of the cash; the hijackers apparently did not
know it was there.
Argentine President Hector Campora has asked for the
return of the hijackers. Cuban authorities indicated the
plane and money would be returned today.
Judge Won't Cite Stans
WASHINGTON — U.S. District Court Judge Joseph
Waddy yesterday declined to cite former Commerce
Secretary Maurice Stans for contempt of court.
Attorneys for Common Cause, the national citizen's
lobby, had requested that Waddy cite Stans when the
latter refused to turn over financial records from President
Nixon's re-election campaign.
Stans was chairman of the Finance Committee to
Re-elect the President.
The judge took under advisement a committee offer to
open its books if Common Cause agrees to drop its
criminal suit.
U.S. Protests Uganda Message
WASHINGTON — The State Department has protested a
Fourth of July greeting sent to President Nixon by
Uganda President Idi Amin.
The holiday message wished Nixon "a speedy
recovery" from the Watergate scandal, and asked the
United States not to meddle in other nation's affairs.
Viet Cong Change Saigon Attack
SAIGON — The Viet Cong charged yesterday that
government troops have mounted an offensive in the
Central Highlands of South Vietnam.
Viet Cong spokesmen said they would launch a
counteroffensive if the fighting does not end at once.
Heavy fighting was reported west of the Central
Highlands city of Kontum, although the Saigon Command
said military activities were at their lowest point since the
cease-fire accord was signed five months ago.
