# Red Cross Center Looks For Blood Donations

### BOB SIEGEL 
The Red Cross-Stanford University Blood
Center currently needs blood of all types to
replenish generally low supplies.
According to the center's administrative
director, Harold Horoho, July and August are
traditional months of shortage. He explained
regular donors are often away and people
answering Red Cross appeals for blood are
generally harder to find.
He asks anyone who "is in generally good
health" to donate a pint of blood and suggests
potential donors call for an appointment to
insure prompt attention.
Continually Growing
The blood center has served a continually
growing number of patients since its opening
eight months ago.
Horoho reports that the 3500 donors
processed thus far "is a higher number than we
had anticipated but not as many as we ultimately
want."

He points out these 3500 have supplied
blood to 7500 to 8500 patients exclusively at
Stanford Hospital and Children's Hospital.
Commenting on the response from the
University, the administrator says,"The
campus has been very good to
us ... particularly good in the beginning, now
it has levelled off," he adds though that
donations from other sectors of the community
have increased somewhat.
Component Therapy
Upon arrival, a potential donor is first asked
about his medical history, then given a brief
examination which checks for illness. After
blood is drawn, it is first tested for hepatitis
and other diseases.
One of the most important new procedural
capabilities incorporated into the center is
component therapy. Under this system, whole
blood from a donor is broken down into four
components — red cells, platelets,
cryro-precipitates, and plasma.

Each component is then stored separately
and a patient needing a transfusion is given only
those components he needs. A hemophiliac, for
example, who previously required frequent and
expensive transfusions of whole blood now
receives relatively small doses of
cryro-precipitates, the vital clotting factor
missing in his blood.
No Harm
A further refinement of component therapy
— known as pheresis — is also available at the
center. This procedure allows single
components to be separated from whole blood
while returning the remaining parts to the
donor. As a result, larger quantities of a desired
rare component can be extracted from a single
individual without harm.
Haroho says usage of pheresis at the center
has increased rapidly in recent months, mostly
because the University medical center attracts
the largest hemophiliac and leukemia
populations on the West Coast.

Within the last two months, the blood center
has begun using a process which can freeze
blood for up to a year. Horoho reports, "We're
trying to store rare blood types, especially
those with particular antibodies."
The institution employs a full-time
administrative and technical staff of 15 that is
complemented by 30 to 45 volunteers serving
as nurses, clerical staff, and laboratory
assistants.
Extensive Research Done
In addition to its service as an agency for
blood collection and distribution, the center is
also the locus of an extensive research effort
being carried on in such areas as
immunotherapy, coagulation, and tissue typing.
The Palo. Alto center, located at 3380
Hillview Ave., is officially considered a branch
of the Central California Regional Blood Center
in San Jose and carries on an exchange program
with the larger facility.
