# P.A.-Stanford Liaison Committee To Have 'Exploratory ’ Meeting
## 
### 
The liaison committee between the
city of Palo Alto and the University
came one step closer to actuality at
the Palo Alto City Council meeting
Monday night.
Palo Alto Mayor Kirke W.
Comstock selected newly-elected
councilman Law Prof. Byron Sher to
work with him on the preliminary
details.
Comstock and Sher will meet
Wednesday with University
representatives President Richard W.

Lyman, Vice President for Business
and Finance Robert Augsburger, and
Trustees President Robert Minge
Brown.
When asked to comment on the
meeting, Comstock referred to it as "a
very, very exploratory" meeting. The
five men will discuss broad areas of
mutual interest for the city and the
University such as land use planning,
the Mayor indicated.
Perhaps the largest single obstacle
to effective relations between the two
bodies might not be
considered—secrecy.
The University consistently
maintained in the past that any joint
city-University meetings be held
behind closed doors.
Brown stated that he is still in favor
of private meetings "to discuss how to
proceed" in public meetings on the
major issues.

However, Palo Alto representatives
are required by state law to conduct
business in public. Council committees
are bound by the Brown Act on
governmental secrecy.
The initial meeting will be held in
private, though. Comstock commented
that since the only issues would be
what to discuss at future meetings, the
legal requirement could be
circumvented.
In addition to the obstacle of
secrecy, Sher has faced opposition
from within the city council.
Councilman John Berwald
suggested Monday that Sher could find
it "embarassing" as council
representative in dealings with his
employer, the University.
Sher dismissed Berwald's claim,
commenting that the scheduled
meeting is "nothing more than an
invitation to lunch."
