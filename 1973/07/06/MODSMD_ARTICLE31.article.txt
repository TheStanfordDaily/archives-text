iA water main at the Biology building erupted last night, sending a 12-foot
high spout of water shooting into the air for 45 minutes and flooding a
loading dock.
] There were no immediate reports of substantial damage. Water reached the
jbumper of a University van parked in the dock, and for a time threatened to
jspread into the building itself.
] The gusher was first reported by a student in the building at 9:10 p.m.,
jand had reportedly been going for about 10 minutes already. An employee
jfrom Plant Services finally arrived to shut off the valve at 9:45 p.m.
j By that time, water in the dock was about two feet deep.
j The break occured at a fire hydrant located at the head of the loadingl
Jdock's driveway. University public safety officers discounted the possibility
jthat either a car struck the hydrant or that the hydrant was loosened on
j purpose.
