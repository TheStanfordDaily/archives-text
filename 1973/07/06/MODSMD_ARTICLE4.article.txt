# Four Kids Discharged After Heart Surgery
## 
### 
The four Costello children left the
University Medical Center Wednesday,
less than a week after two teams of
surgeons performed open-heart surgery
on them.
David, 18; Richard, 15; Kevin, 13;
and Karen, 4, received national
attention last month when it was
revealed they would all undergo the
same delicate operation to repair holes
in the muscle walls of their hearts.
On June 28, teams headed by Drs.
Norman Shumway and Edward
Stinson performed the surgery, which
went without a hitch. Doctors
estimated the operation could add as
much as 20 years to each child's life.
After the operation, all four were
placed in the intensive care unit for
two days. A hospital spokesman had
estimated at the time that they would
probably remain in the hospital for
several more days.

The spokesman said the family
would be vacationing for the next
several weeks in Blue Lake, near
Ukiah.
The children remain under orders
to take it easy for about a month, but
then will be able to undertake full
physical activity for the first time in
their lives.
Their condition is technically
known as an atrial septal defect, a
congenital disorder inherited in this
case through their father David W.
Costello, a Santa Rosa teamster.
The defect affected the flow of
oxygen-rich blood to various body
tissues. The University spokesman
called the condition "incapacitating,
but it's not something you die from."
The $20,000 cost of the surgery
was paid for through insurance and
Costello's Teamsters Union benefits,
and was arranged by the
Oakland-based Kaiser Foundation.


REMAP PLANSâ€”The state legislature's proposed reapportionment plan is
almost identical with the existing 17th district boundaries (left) with a long


extension that snakes through Santa Clara County. Atherton businessman J
Gordon Knapp has proposed a more compact plan for the 17th.
