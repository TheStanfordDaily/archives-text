# Atherton Businessman Proposes Redisricting Plan
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
J. Gordon Knapp thinks neither state legislators nor
the courts should reapportion Congressional and state
senate and assembly districts.
So the wealthy Atherton businessman and likely 1974
candidate for Congress has drawn up his own plan for
re arranging the boundaries of the state's 43 Congressional
districts, and has submitted the plan to the Masters
Commission appointed by the State Supreme Court after
the legislature and Gov. Ronald Reagan were unable to
reach a compromise plan.
The legislature's plan, vetoed last week by Reagan, will
also be considered by the Commission before it makes its
recommendation to the Supreme Court by Aug. 31.
Stanford and Palo Alto would remain in the same
district — the 17th — under either plan. But depending on
which, if either, is accepted by the Court, the character of
the surrounding district could change substantially.
Knapp, 51, hired a staff of attorneys — at a cost to
himself of at least $15,000 — to come up with the plan.
He says he undertook the project as "my duty as a
public-minded private citizen."

"We worked our asses off night and day for five
months" to come up with the proposal, Knapp told the
Daily yesterday.
Non-Partisan Plan
The plan, he said, was devised with absolutely no
thought given to the political make-up of the new
districts, and Knapp says even now he hasn't looked at
voter party registration figures since finalizing the plan.
"I think that would destroy the non-partisan image
we've been trying so hard for," he said.
Knapp's plan would substantially alter the geographical
make-up of the 17th district, now represented by Rep.
Paul N. McCloskey Jr. (R-Menlo Park).
Currently, the district encompasses the portion of San
Mateo County from Hillsborough south, as well as a long
"arm" stretching into Santa Clara County.
This "arm" contains most of the district's population
and includes Stanford, Palo Alto, parts of Mountain View,
Sunnyvale, Santa Clara, and into East San Jose.
More Compact District
The district runs more than 37 miles from Hillsborough
on the north to San Jose on the south.

The result of the layout is that while McCloskey
represents areas as far south as East San Jose, the town of
Los Altos, which is only five miles from Palo Alto, is in
the neighboring 10th district of Rep. Charles Gubser
(R-Gilroy).
Knapp's plan calls for a more geographically compact
17th district. It would slice off the northernmost portion
of McCloskey's San Mateo constituency, and would
amputate the long arm stretching through Santa Clara
County.
Instead, the 17th would gain the entire cities of Los
Altos, Mountain View and Sunnyvale, and would stretch
straight through Saratoga and Los Gatos.
McCloskey has not yet commented publicly on the
Knapp plan.
Possible Effects
At this point it is impossible to predict what political
impact Knapp's plan would have if adopted. However,
some effects appear likely:
— the Knapp plan would further separate McCloskey
from the constituency that first elected him in 1967. At
that time, McCloskey's district — then the 11th — was

completely contained within San Mateo County.
Reapportionment before the 1972 election put most of
his constituents in Santa Clara County, and the Knapp
plan would continue that trend;
— it could increase Democratic strength in the district.
The 17th is already heavily Democratic, and Santa Clara
County is considered more strongly Democratic than the
southern portion of San Mateo;
— and it could conceivably result in giving McCloskey a
more difficult time if he runs for re-election in 1974. In
1972, McCloskey won 71 percent of the vote in his San
Mateo portion of the district; by comparison, he took
only 57 percent in the Santa Clara portion.
Knapp May Run
Knapp himself could figure in McCloskey's '74 race.
Last year, Knapp — chairman of the board of the Calso
Water Corp. of Menlo Park — launched a last-minute
write-in campaign against McCloskey and his Democratic
challenger, Palo Alto attorney James Stewart.
Knapp, more conservative than the maverick
McCloskey, has indicated he may oppose the incumbent
coordinators say.
Parents and children confirmed the
need for the center and their delight
with it at yesterday's opening. One
mother who just arrived here from the
East commented on the lack of such
an organization, especially for
children, on other campuses.
'Ideal'
"This is a real child facility. It's
ideal ... I think I'll go volunteer."
Children's comments, when their
attention could be diverted from the
blocks, toys, and domestic rats, were
unanimously favorable.
"It's beautiful, it's big, and it's fun
and you get to do a lot," said one little
girl. "And the teachers are really
nice."
Students are invited to stop by and
offer their services as teachers or
babysitters, for money or meals. "We
want to involve the whole
community," declared Faught.

make-up of the 17th district, now represented by Rep.
Paul N. McCloskey Jr. (R-Menlo Park).
Currently, the district encompasses the portion of San
Mateo County from Hillsborough south, as well as a long
"arm" stretching into Santa Clara County.
This "arm" contains most of the district's population
and includes Stanford, Palo Alto, parts of Mountain View,
Sunnyvale, Santa Clara, and into East San Jose.
More Compact District
The district runs more than 37 miles from Hillsborough
on the north to San Jose on the south.

The result of the layout is that while McCloskey
represents areas as far south as East San Jose, the town of
Los Altos, which is only five miles from Palo Alto, is in
the neighboring 10th district of Rep. Charles Gubser
(R-Gilroy).
Knapp's plan calls for a more geographically compact
17th district. It would slice off the northernmost portion
of McCloskey's San Mateo constituency, and would
amputate the long arm stretching through Santa Clara
County.
Instead, the 17th would gain the entire cities of Los
Altos, Mountain View and Sunnyvale, and would stretch
straight through Saratoga and Los Gatos.
McCloskey has not yet commented publicly on the
Knapp plan.
Possible Effects
At this point it is impossible to predict what political
impact Knapp's plan would have if adopted. However,
some effects appear likely:
— the Knapp plan would further separate McCloskey
from the constituency that first elected him in 1967. At
that time, McCloskey's district — then the 11th — was

completely contained within San Mateo County.
Reapportionment before the 1972 election put most of
his constituents in Santa Clara County, and the Knapp
plan would continue that trend;
— it could increase Democratic strength in the district.
The 17th is already heavily Democratic, and Santa Clara
County is considered more strongly Democratic than the
southern portion of San Mateo;
— and it could conceivably result in giving McCloskey a
more difficult time if he runs for re-election in 1974. In
1972, McCloskey won 71 percent of the vote in his San
Mateo portion of the district; by comparison, he took
only 57 percent in the Santa Clara portion.
Knapp May Run
Knapp himself could figure in McCloskey's '74 race.
Last year, Knapp — chairman of the board of the Calso
Water Corp. of Menlo Park — launched a last-minute
write-in campaign against McCloskey and his Democratic
challenger, Palo Alto attorney James Stewart.
Knapp, more conservative than the maverick
McCloskey, has indicated he may oppose the incumbent
coordinators say.
Parents and children confirmed the
need for the center and their delight
with it at yesterday's opening. One
mother who just arrived here from the
East commented on the lack of such
an organization, especially for
children, on other campuses.
'Ideal'
"This is a real child facility. It's
ideal ... I think I'll go volunteer."
Children's comments, when their
attention could be diverted from the
blocks, toys, and domestic rats, were
unanimously favorable.
"It's beautiful, it's big, and it's fun
and you get to do a lot," said one little
girl. "And the teachers are really
nice."
Students are invited to stop by and
offer their services as teachers or
babysitters, for money or meals. "We
want to involve the whole
community," declared Faught.
J. Gordon Knapp thinks neither state legislators nor
the courts should reapportion Congressional and state
senate and assembly districts.
So the wealthy Atherton businessman and likely 1974
candidate for Congress has drawn up his own plan for
re arranging the boundaries of the state's 43 Congressional
districts, and has submitted the plan to the Masters
Commission appointed by the State Supreme Court after
the legislature and Gov. Ronald Reagan were unable to
reach a compromise plan.
The legislature's plan, vetoed last week by Reagan, will
also be considered by the Commission before it makes its
recommendation to the Supreme Court by Aug. 31.
Stanford and Palo Alto would remain in the same
district — the 17th — under either plan. But depending on
which, if either, is accepted by the Court, the character of
the surrounding district could change substantially.
Knapp, 51, hired a staff of attorneys — at a cost to
himself of at least $15,000 — to come up with the plan.
He says he undertook the project as "my duty as a
public-minded private citizen."

"We worked our asses off night and day for five
months" to come up with the proposal, Knapp told the
Daily yesterday.
Non-Partisan Plan
The plan, he said, was devised with absolutely no
thought given to the political make-up of the new
districts, and Knapp says even now he hasn't looked at
voter party registration figures since finalizing the plan.
"I think that would destroy the non-partisan image
we've been trying so hard for," he said.

completely contained within San Mateo County.
Reapportionment before the 1972 election put most of
his constituents in Santa Clara County, and the Knapp
plan would continue that trend;
— it could increase Democratic strength in the district.
The 17th is already heavily Democratic, and Santa Clara
County is considered more strongly Democratic than the
southern portion of San Mateo;
— and it could conceivably result in giving McCloskey a
more difficult time if he runs for re-election in 1974. In
1972, McCloskey won 71 percent of the vote in his San
Mateo portion of the district; by comparison, he took
only 57 percent in the Santa Clara portion.
Knapp May Run
Knapp himself could figure in McCloskey's '74 race.
Last year, Knapp — chairman of the board of the Calso
Water Corp. of Menlo Park — launched a last-minute
write-in campaign against McCloskey and his Democratic
challenger, Palo Alto attorney James Stewart.
Knapp, more conservative than the maverick
McCloskey, has indicated he may oppose the incumbent
coordinators say.
Parents and children confirmed the
need for the center and their delight
with it at yesterday's opening. One
mother who just arrived here from the
East commented on the lack of such
an organization, especially for
children, on other campuses.
'Ideal'
"This is a real child facility. It's
ideal ... I think I'll go volunteer."
Children's comments, when their
attention could be diverted from the
blocks, toys, and domestic rats, were
unanimously favorable.
"It's beautiful, it's big, and it's fun
and you get to do a lot," said one little
girl. "And the teachers are really
nice."
Students are invited to stop by and
offer their services as teachers or
babysitters, for money or meals. "We
want to involve the whole
community," declared Faught.
J. Gordon Knapp thinks neither state legislators nor
the courts should reapportion Congressional and state
senate and assembly districts.
So the wealthy Atherton businessman and likely 1974
candidate for Congress has drawn up his own plan for
re arranging the boundaries of the state's 43 Congressional
districts, and has submitted the plan to the Masters
Commission appointed by the State Supreme Court after
the legislature and Gov. Ronald Reagan were unable to
reach a compromise plan.
The legislature's plan, vetoed last week by Reagan, will
also be considered by the Commission before it makes its
recommendation to the Supreme Court by Aug. 31.
Stanford and Palo Alto would remain in the same
district — the 17th — under either plan. But depending on
which, if either, is accepted by the Court, the character of
the surrounding district could change substantially.
Knapp, 51, hired a staff of attorneys — at a cost to
himself of at least $15,000 — to come up with the plan.
He says he undertook the project as "my duty as a
public-minded private citizen."

"We worked our asses off night and day for five
months" to come up with the proposal, Knapp told the
Daily yesterday.
Non-Partisan Plan
The plan, he said, was devised with absolutely no
thought given to the political make-up of the new
districts, and Knapp says even now he hasn't looked at
voter party registration figures since finalizing the plan.
"I think that would destroy the non-partisan image
we've been trying so hard for," he said.
Knapp's plan would substantially alter the geographical
make-up of the 17th district, now represented by Rep.
Paul N. McCloskey Jr. (R-Menlo Park).
Currently, the district encompasses the portion of San
Mateo County from Hillsborough south, as well as a long
"arm" stretching into Santa Clara County.
This "arm" contains most of the district's population
and includes Stanford, Palo Alto, parts of Mountain View,
Sunnyvale, Santa Clara, and into East San Jose.
More Compact District
The district runs more than 37 miles from Hillsborough
on the north to San Jose on the south.

The result of the layout is that while McCloskey
represents areas as far south as East San Jose, the town of
Los Altos, which is only five miles from Palo Alto, is in
the neighboring 10th district of Rep. Charles Gubser
(R-Gilroy).
Knapp's plan calls for a more geographically compact
17th district. It would slice off the northernmost portion
of McCloskey's San Mateo constituency, and would
amputate the long arm stretching through Santa Clara
County.
Instead, the 17th would gain the entire cities of Los
Altos, Mountain View and Sunnyvale, and would stretch
straight through Saratoga and Los Gatos.
McCloskey has not yet commented publicly on the
Knapp plan.
Possible Effects
At this point it is impossible to predict what political
impact Knapp's plan would have if adopted. However,
some effects appear likely:
— the Knapp plan would further separate McCloskey
from the constituency that first elected him in 1967. At
that time, McCloskey's district — then the 11th — was

completely contained within San Mateo County.
Reapportionment before the 1972 election put most of
his constituents in Santa Clara County, and the Knapp
plan would continue that trend;
— it could increase Democratic strength in the district.
The 17th is already heavily Democratic, and Santa Clara
County is considered more strongly Democratic than the
southern portion of San Mateo;
— and it could conceivably result in giving McCloskey a
more difficult time if he runs for re-election in 1974. In
1972, McCloskey won 71 percent of the vote in his San
Mateo portion of the district; by comparison, he took
only 57 percent in the Santa Clara portion.
