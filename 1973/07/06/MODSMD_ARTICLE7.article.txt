# Huston's Ideology Of Internal Security
## Liberty Or Order: 1970 Domestic Spying Plan 
### 
William F. Buckley's National
Review once said of Tom Charles
Huston that "he radiates a primal
personal integrity and conceals
remarkable intellectual and
political agility behind a facade of
Hoosier folksiness. He is one of
the young luminaries of American
conservatism."
Huston is the young lawyer
and conservative political activist
who, in the summer of 1970, as a
White House aide drafted an
expanded domestic intelligence
plan for President Nixon. The
plan involved spying, wiretapping,
burglaries, and the interception
and opening of mail.
How did it happen that
Huston, a former national
chairman of the Young Americans
for Freedom student group, came
to design a program for the
systematic violation of civil
liberties?
> The answer to this puzzle lies
ijn large part in the ideological
concepts of "freedom" and of

"order" that are held by men like
Huston who are in the leadership
of the organized conservative
movement in America.
A profile of Huston in the May
24 New York Times quoted him
as explaining that "repression is
an inevitable result of disorder.
Forced to choose between order
and freedom, people will take
order."
Huston's Error
The error in Huston's reasoning
is twofold. First, there is a
philosophical error in not
recognizing the difference
between a societal "order" that is
simply securing to citizens their
rights to life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness and a societal
"order" that secures a
governmental system, any
governmental system in power.
Thus, the American Revolution
in the eighteenth century is
correctly seen both as a threat to
the order of the British Empire
and as a defense of the natural

order of human liberty. There is
always a dichotomy between
governmental order per se and
liberty. But there is perfect
compatibility between total
liberty and a natural order
securing to all this same liberty.
Secondly, Huston made the
practical error of defending not
the natural order of full freedom
for all, but governmental order.
He has subsequently attempted to
justify this by contending that at
the time the voters were likely to
endorse more extensive
abrogation of civil liberties, if the
Nixon plan was not successful.
But here we see the same
opportunistic position that
Huston found so distasteful in the
Nixon administration's other
domestic programs. Borrowing the
sort of domestic security program
that one might anticipate from a
George Wallace in order to avert
his gaining electoral strength, is
hardly acting in accord with any
"philosophical view of what
government ought to be doing."
Embracing Only Rhetoric
If Huston had recognized that
a free society was the proper
environment for human activity,
he would have held that a net
subtraction of freedom is never

justified. If Huston had fully
belonged to the individualist
political tradition, instead of
merely partially embracing its
rhetoric, liberty would have been
his highest political goal, to which
all others were subordinated.
However, Huston and the other
adherents of the William Buckley
circle of conservatives attempt to
fuse a devotion to the prevailing
traditional order with a devotion
to liberty. In times of crisis, they
most often come down on the
side of the ruling order rather
than liberty.
Huston himself is an admirer of
the political thought of John C.
Calhoun, whose portrait was on
his office wall in his White House
years. Calhoun's influence no
doubt added to Huston's capacity
to rationalize setting up the 1970
espionage program.
Calhoun was both a brilliant,
original political theorist and an
active politican in the period
preceding the American Civil War.
But Calhoun rejected the
Jeffersonian doctrine that all
human beings possessed natural
and inalienable rights.
Men Not Born Free
Calhoun argued in his
Disquisition on Government that

Bill Evers

"it is a great and dangerous error
to suppose that all people are
equally entitled to liberty.
"It is a reward to be earned,
not a blessing to be gratuitously
lavished of all alike—a reward
reserved for the intelligent, the
patriotic, the virtuous and
deserving, and not a boon to be
bestowed on a people too
ignorant, degraded, and vicious to
be capable either of appreciating
or of enjoying it."
Huston was inclined to believe
with Calhoun that when liberty
and governmental order came into
conflict, liberty must yield to
governmental power. Huston was
therefore willing to devise a
massive plan to control dissenters.
But Huston's and Calhoun's
ant i-libertarian approach is an
attack upon the social conditions
that are right for man. Only when
it is generally recognized that, in
Proudhon's words, "liberty is not
the daughter but the mother of
order," and when men are ready
to defend such a natural order of
liberty, will we have a free
society, a society in which virtue
can prosper.

George Wallace in order to avert
his gaining electoral strength, is
hardly acting in accord with any
"philosophical view of what
government ought to be doing."
Embracing Only Rhetoric
If Huston had recognized that
a free society was the proper
environment for human activity,
he would have held that a net
subtraction of freedom is never

justified. If Huston had fully
belonged to the individualist
political tradition, instead of
merely partially embracing its
rhetoric, liberty would have been
his highest political goal, to which
all others were subordinated.
However, Huston and the other
adherents of the William Buckley
circle of conservatives attempt to
fuse a devotion to the prevailing
traditional order with a devotion
to liberty. In times of crisis, they
most often come down on the
side of the ruling order rather
than liberty.
Huston himself is an admirer of
the political thought of John C.
Calhoun, whose portrait was on
his office wall in his White House
years. Calhoun's influence no
doubt added to Huston's capacity
to rationalize setting up the 1970
espionage program.
Calhoun was both a brilliant,
original political theorist and an
active politican in the period
preceding the American Civil War.
But Calhoun rejected the
Jeffersonian doctrine that all
human beings possessed natural
and inalienable rights.
Men Not Born Free
Calhoun argued in his
Disquisition on Government that

Bill Evers

"it is a great and dangerous error
to suppose that all people are
equally entitled to liberty.
"It is a reward to be earned,
not a blessing to be gratuitously
lavished of all alike—a reward
reserved for the intelligent, the
patriotic, the virtuous and
deserving, and not a boon to be
bestowed on a people too
ignorant, degraded, and vicious to
be capable either of appreciating
or of enjoying it."
Huston was inclined to believe
with Calhoun that when liberty
and governmental order came into
conflict, liberty must yield to
governmental power. Huston was
therefore willing to devise a
massive plan to control dissenters.
But Huston's and Calhoun's
ant i-libertarian approach is an
attack upon the social conditions
that are right for man. Only when
it is generally recognized that, in
Proudhon's words, "liberty is not
the daughter but the mother of
order," and when men are ready
to defend such a natural order of
liberty, will we have a free
society, a society in which virtue
can prosper.
(Bill Evers is a regular Daily
columnist.)
William F. Buckley's National
Review once said of Tom Charles
Huston that "he radiates a primal
personal integrity and conceals
remarkable intellectual and
political agility behind a facade of
Hoosier folksiness. He is one of
the young luminaries of American
conservatism."
Huston is the young lawyer
and conservative political activist
who, in the summer of 1970, as a
White House aide drafted an
expanded domestic intelligence
plan for President Nixon. The
plan involved spying, wiretapping,
burglaries, and the interception
and opening of mail.
How did it happen that
Huston, a former national
chairman of the Young Americans
for Freedom student group, came
to design a program for the
systematic violation of civil
liberties?
> The answer to this puzzle lies
ijn large part in the ideological
concepts of "freedom" and of

"order" that are held by men like
Huston who are in the leadership
of the organized conservative
movement in America.
A profile of Huston in the May
24 New York Times quoted him
as explaining that "repression is
an inevitable result of disorder.
Forced to choose between order
and freedom, people will take
order."
Huston's Error
The error in Huston's reasoning
is twofold. First, there is a
philosophical error in not
recognizing the difference
between a societal "order" that is
simply securing to citizens their
rights to life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness and a societal
"order" that secures a
governmental system, any
governmental system in power.
Thus, the American Revolution
in the eighteenth century is
correctly seen both as a threat to
the order of the British Empire
and as a defense of the natural

order of human liberty. There is
always a dichotomy between
governmental order per se and
liberty. But there is perfect
compatibility between total
liberty and a natural order
securing to all this same liberty.
Secondly, Huston made the
practical error of defending not
the natural order of full freedom
for all, but governmental order.
He has subsequently attempted to
justify this by contending that at
the time the voters were likely to
endorse more extensive
abrogation of civil liberties, if the
Nixon plan was not successful.
But here we see the same
opportunistic position that
Huston found so distasteful in the
Nixon administration's other
domestic programs. Borrowing the
sort of domestic security program
that one might anticipate from a
George Wallace in order to avert
his gaining electoral strength, is
hardly acting in accord with any
"philosophical view of what
government ought to be doing."

William F. Buckley's National
Review once said of Tom Charles
Huston that "he radiates a primal
personal integrity and conceals
remarkable intellectual and
political agility behind a facade of
Hoosier folksiness. He is one of
the young luminaries of American
conservatism."
Huston is the young lawyer
and conservative political activist
who, in the summer of 1970, as a
White House aide drafted an
expanded domestic intelligence
plan for President Nixon. The
plan involved spying, wiretapping,
burglaries, and the interception
and opening of mail.
How did it happen that
Huston, a former national
chairman of the Young Americans
for Freedom student group, came
to design a program for the
systematic violation of civil
liberties?
> The answer to this puzzle lies
ijn large part in the ideological
concepts of "freedom" and of

"order" that are held by men like
Huston who are in the leadership
of the organized conservative
movement in America.
A profile of Huston in the May
24 New York Times quoted him
as explaining that "repression is
an inevitable result of disorder.
Forced to choose between order
and freedom, people will take
order."
Huston's Error
The error in Huston's reasoning
is twofold. First, there is a
philosophical error in not
recognizing the difference
between a societal "order" that is
simply securing to citizens their
rights to life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness and a societal
"order" that secures a
governmental system, any
governmental system in power.
Thus, the American Revolution
in the eighteenth century is
correctly seen both as a threat to
the order of the British Empire
and as a defense of the natural

order of human liberty. There is
always a dichotomy between
governmental order per se and
liberty. But there is perfect
compatibility between total
liberty and a natural order
securing to all this same liberty.
Secondly, Huston made the
practical error of defending not
the natural order of full freedom
for all, but governmental order.
He has subsequently attempted to
justify this by contending that at
the time the voters were likely to
endorse more extensive
abrogation of civil liberties, if the
Nixon plan was not successful.
But here we see the same
opportunistic position that
Huston found so distasteful in the
Nixon administration's other
domestic programs. Borrowing the
sort of domestic security program
that one might anticipate from a
George Wallace in order to avert
his gaining electoral strength, is
hardly acting in accord with any
"philosophical view of what
government ought to be doing."
Embracing Only Rhetoric
If Huston had recognized that
a free society was the proper
environment for human activity,
he would have held that a net
subtraction of freedom is never

justified. If Huston had fully
belonged to the individualist
political tradition, instead of
merely partially embracing its
rhetoric, liberty would have been
his highest political goal, to which
all others were subordinated.
However, Huston and the other
adherents of the William Buckley
circle of conservatives attempt to
fuse a devotion to the prevailing
traditional order with a devotion
to liberty. In times of crisis, they
most often come down on the
side of the ruling order rather
than liberty.
Huston himself is an admirer of
the political thought of John C.
Calhoun, whose portrait was on
his office wall in his White House
years. Calhoun's influence no
doubt added to Huston's capacity
to rationalize setting up the 1970
espionage program.
Calhoun was both a brilliant,
original political theorist and an
active politican in the period
preceding the American Civil War.
But Calhoun rejected the
Jeffersonian doctrine that all
human beings possessed natural
and inalienable rights.
Men Not Born Free
Calhoun argued in his
Disquisition on Government that

Bill Evers

"it is a great and dangerous error
to suppose that all people are
equally entitled to liberty.
"It is a reward to be earned,
not a blessing to be gratuitously
lavished of all alike—a reward
reserved for the intelligent, the
patriotic, the virtuous and
deserving, and not a boon to be
bestowed on a people too
ignorant, degraded, and vicious to
be capable either of appreciating
or of enjoying it."
Huston was inclined to believe
with Calhoun that when liberty
and governmental order came into
conflict, liberty must yield to
governmental power. Huston was
therefore willing to devise a
massive plan to control dissenters.
But Huston's and Calhoun's
ant i-libertarian approach is an
attack upon the social conditions
that are right for man. Only when
it is generally recognized that, in
Proudhon's words, "liberty is not
the daughter but the mother of
order," and when men are ready
to defend such a natural order of
liberty, will we have a free
society, a society in which virtue
can prosper.
