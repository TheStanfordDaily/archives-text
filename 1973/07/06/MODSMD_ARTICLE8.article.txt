# Imagined Threat Caused Watergate
## Nixon's Insecure Aides 
### 
Last week former White House
counsel John Dean linked
President Nixon to the coverup of
Watergate. Questioning in the last
two days of his testimony
scrupulously tested and analyzed
the few shreds of evidence
presented which directly
implicates Nixon in the
conspiracy.
Dean's ability to maintain a
remarkably consistent story
through five days of examination
lends an air of credibility to his
testimony which the White House
will eventually have to confront.
Already numerous senators
have begun politely suggesting
that Nixon appear before the
committee, and in coming weeks
pressure for at least some kind of
direct response from the President

will grow as more questions
remain unanswered.
The impact of Dean's
testimony, however, was far
broader than the allegations of
criminal behavior against the chief
executive.
Haunted Men
At least as disturbing was the
new light shed on the secretive
inner workings of the White
House. Dean's 245-page statement
revealed the most influential
counselors and aides in the
executive branch to be a group of
pathetic, haunted men who
obviously believed various forms
of harassment and undercover
operations were needed against
political enemies in order to keep
the Nixon ship afloat.
The irony is, of course, there
has been no threat to the Nixon
administration which could justify
the use of such tactics — if the use
of such tactics can ever be
justified. The explanation of
"national security" reminds one
of the witchhunts of the 1950s
with shades of 1984 technology.
At Watergate time last year,
George McGovern had the
Democratic nomination virtually
sewed up, having won four
primaries (including California's)
the week before.
John Mitchell, then head of the
Committee to Re-elect the
President could hardly keep from
gloating when asked about
McGovern's success and felt
obliged to circulate an in-house
memo stating the campaign will
still require a "maximum effort."
The latest Gallup poll showed
Nixon leading 43 percent to 30
percent.
Enemies Project
The "enemies project" as
described by Dean identified
hundreds of people and
institutions as possible targets for
harassment because of their public
anti-administration opinions.
Included on the list were
numerous executives, politicians,
"academics," and such menacing
threats as Steve McQueen and Joe
Namath.
Dean submitted various
documents outlining procedures
for using IRS investigations to spy
on political opponents. Back in

Bob Siegel

1970 and 1971, a master plan for
bugging, tapping, and burglarizing
was devised and at least
temporarily implemented against
persons suspected of endangering
national security.
After reading the document,
Senator Sam Ervin said it revealed
a "Gestapo mentality." The illegal
search of Daniel Ellsberg's
psychiatrist's office was probably
at least an offshoot of this policy.
In-House Bugging
Even within the White Houe,
mistrust and suspicion flourished.
Last month it was revealed that
several members of the National
Security Counsel and advisers to
Henry Kissinger had their phones
wiretapped while other operatives
attempted to find the source of
news leaks.
Dean said he often gave Press
Secretary Ronald Ziegler
incomplete information because
he was under "very specific
instructions" from presidential
aide John Ehrlichman "not to
brief Ziegler." Assistant H.R.
Haldeman served as a
scrutinizing roadblock against
other aides desiring to see the
President.
An incisive illustration of the
prevailing presidential mentality
was the incident in 1971 when
Nixon voiced strong displeasure at
the sight of a lone demonstrator
standing with a sign in Lafayette
Park across from the White House.
Dean reported that one key aide
went looking for "thugs" to
remove the protestor.
Many Republicans have rightly
pointed out that politically
motivated harassment began way
before January, 1969. What
di st inguishes Nixon's
administration, however, is its
apparent insecurity and the
consequent number of clanestine
operations that have been planned
and used as weapons against its
detractors.
The Watergate scandal has
thereby performed a highly
beneficial service to the Amerian
political system by unconvering
the extent of power abuse
possible within the present
framework of the Executive
Branch.

of harassment and undercover
operations were needed against
political enemies in order to keep
the Nixon ship afloat.
The irony is, of course, there
has been no threat to the Nixon
administration which could justify
the use of such tactics — if the use
of such tactics can ever be
justified. The explanation of
"national security" reminds one
of the witchhunts of the 1950s
with shades of 1984 technology.
At Watergate time last year,
George McGovern had the
Democratic nomination virtually
sewed up, having won four
primaries (including California's)
the week before.
John Mitchell, then head of the
Committee to Re-elect the
President could hardly keep from
gloating when asked about
McGovern's success and felt
obliged to circulate an in-house
memo stating the campaign will
still require a "maximum effort."
The latest Gallup poll showed
Nixon leading 43 percent to 30
percent.
Enemies Project
The "enemies project" as
described by Dean identified
hundreds of people and
institutions as possible targets for
harassment because of their public
anti-administration opinions.
Included on the list were
numerous executives, politicians,
"academics," and such menacing
threats as Steve McQueen and Joe
Namath.
Dean submitted various
documents outlining procedures
for using IRS investigations to spy
on political opponents. Back in

Bob Siegel

1970 and 1971, a master plan for
bugging, tapping, and burglarizing
was devised and at least
temporarily implemented against
persons suspected of endangering
national security.
After reading the document,
Senator Sam Ervin said it revealed
a "Gestapo mentality." The illegal
search of Daniel Ellsberg's
psychiatrist's office was probably
at least an offshoot of this policy.
In-House Bugging
Even within the White Houe,
mistrust and suspicion flourished.
Last month it was revealed that
several members of the National
Security Counsel and advisers to
Henry Kissinger had their phones
wiretapped while other operatives
attempted to find the source of
news leaks.
Dean said he often gave Press
Secretary Ronald Ziegler
incomplete information because
he was under "very specific
instructions" from presidential
aide John Ehrlichman "not to
brief Ziegler." Assistant H.R.
Haldeman served as a
scrutinizing roadblock against
other aides desiring to see the
President.
An incisive illustration of the
prevailing presidential mentality
was the incident in 1971 when
Nixon voiced strong displeasure at
the sight of a lone demonstrator
standing with a sign in Lafayette
Park across from the White House.
Dean reported that one key aide
went looking for "thugs" to
remove the protestor.
Many Republicans have rightly
pointed out that politically
motivated harassment began way
before January, 1969. What
di st inguishes Nixon's
administration, however, is its
apparent insecurity and the
consequent number of clanestine
operations that have been planned
and used as weapons against its
detractors.
The Watergate scandal has
thereby performed a highly
beneficial service to the Amerian
political system by unconvering
the extent of power abuse
possible within the present
framework of the Executive
Branch.

Last week former White House
counsel John Dean linked
President Nixon to the coverup of
Watergate. Questioning in the last
two days of his testimony
scrupulously tested and analyzed
the few shreds of evidence
presented which directly
implicates Nixon in the
conspiracy.
Dean's ability to maintain a
remarkably consistent story
through five days of examination
lends an air of credibility to his
testimony which the White House
will eventually have to confront.
Already numerous senators
have begun politely suggesting
that Nixon appear before the
committee, and in coming weeks
pressure for at least some kind of
direct response from the President

will grow as more questions
remain unanswered.
The impact of Dean's
testimony, however, was far
broader than the allegations of
criminal behavior against the chief
executive.
Haunted Men
At least as disturbing was the
new light shed on the secretive
inner workings of the White
House. Dean's 245-page statement
revealed the most influential
counselors and aides in the
executive branch to be a group of
pathetic, haunted men who
obviously believed various forms
of harassment and undercover
operations were needed against
political enemies in order to keep
the Nixon ship afloat.
