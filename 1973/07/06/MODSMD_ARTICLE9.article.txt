# Opinions Page Policy

### 
J The Daily opinions page, which you're reading now, is |
j currently subsisting on a bare diet of columns by Daily people
J and friends.
Now we could probably keep doing this all summer, but we'd
j like it a lot more if YOU'd tell us what you think.
So call 321-2300, ext. 4632, or bring your submission into our
| offices, Panama & Lomita, on campus, and ask for the Opinions i
I editor.
We'd appreciate it if you'd save us a lot of hassle by typing |
J your articles on a double-spaced, 62-space line, signing your j
submission, and leaving your phone number.
