# Alberta Siegel: The Professor As Public Servant
## 
### SCOTT FIELDS 
"I'm an activist, and I like to try
and influence government policy."
Psychology Prof. Alberta Siegel, a
nationally-recognized expert on
television's effect on child
development, has compiled a
voluminous record of public service in
the past few years. On the average she
has been in Washington D.C. once
every three weeks.
"I think that these experiences
enrich my teaching, because it means
that I'm in touch with a lot of what is
going on. It intrudes on my teaching in
the sense that I'm out of town so
much," she said.
Siegel has been a member of several
government committees, such as the
Growth and Development Research

and Training Committee of the
National Institute of Child Health and
Human Development. Although she
enjoys holding these positions, she
says they entail very hard work and a
good portion of her time. "It's what
my friend calls 'severe pleasure,' " she
remarked.
Exhausting Schedule
"Getting to Washington takes a
whole day. I get on a plane at nine in
the morning, and by the time I check
in it's time for dinner. Then the
committee meets for a couple of days,
and at the end of the meeting I rush
out to the airport and get on a 5:45
TWA plane, and the stewardess says:
'Well Mrs. Siegel, it's nice to see you
again.' "
Siegel was one of the first

psychologists to do research on the
effects of television on young children,
and she served as a member of the
Surgeon General's Scientific Advisory
Committee on Television and Social
Behavior from 1969 until 1971.
"We felt there was too much
violence on American television, and it
isn't helpful to children," Siegel
explained. "Television could be
helpful to children if different
materials were presented, but this
constant emphasis on repetitive
violence gives them a distorted picture
of the world."
Proposed Violence Reduction
As a result of her work on the
Surgeon General's committee, Siegel
testified before the Subcommittee on
Communications of the U.S. Senate

Committee on Commerce in March,
1972.
She recommended several measures
designed to lower the level of
television violence:
— establishment of an independent
monitoring agency to provide regular
reports on the level of violence in
television entertainment;
— public boycott of firms using
glorified aggression on commercials,
increased support for public television;
— the appointment of a child
advocate to the staff of the FCC;
— and the offering of travel
fellowships to the writers and
producers of children's television
programs.
Other countries have succeeded in

producing television programs which
are not saturated with violence,
according to Siegel. She believes that
American television producers could
learn from studying television in these
countries.
She also maintains that television
has a negative effect on the career
choices of young adults.
In a recent address to the Stanford
Phi Beta Kappa, she said: "The
Council of Education survey found
that the health professions are the goal
of 10.6 percent of this year's
freshmen, compared with 5.3 percent
in 1966. Is it fanciful to suggest that
this rise is due partly to the time
today's freshman has spent in the
company of Marcus Welby M.D. ?"
Siegel believes that one reason many

students become disenchanted with
their career choice is that the "tube"
has given them a false picture of their
career choice.
"Watching a hospital show in the
comfort of one's own easy chair, the
TV viewer does not experience the
smell of the emergency room, the chill
in the long corridors between wards,
the pallid taste of cafeteria food," she
emphasized.
The psychology professor does feel
that much of television benefits the
public. "The news coverage is a great
technological advance, and it has a real
potential for unifying the country,"
she commented.
Born in Pasadena, Siegel received
her Ph.D. here in 1955. She has taught

young people.
at Pennsylvania State University in
addition to Stanford, and has worked
at the Center for Advanced Study in
the Behavioral Sciences in Palo Alto.
She has also served as the editor of
Child Development the main journal
of child psychology. In 1971 she was
the Associate Dean of Undergraduate
Studies here. She is the current
president of the Faculty Club, and is
on the Medical School Admissions
Committee.
Siegel presently serves on the
National Institute of Child Health and
Human Development, and the
Advisory Committee for the
Educational Testing Service. She was
recently chosen to represent the

psychological field on the National
Science Foundation Advisory
Committee on the Ethical and Human
Value Implications of Science and
Technology.
In addition she has been a member
of the Advisory Council of the
National Laboratory on Early
Childhood Education and the Mental
Health Research Career Award
Committee of the National Institute of
Mental Health.
With membership on all of these
committees, it is easy to understand
why Siegel has spent so much time in
Washington D.C. "You do know the
flight schedules," she said. "It gets to
where your travel agent recognizes
your voice."
