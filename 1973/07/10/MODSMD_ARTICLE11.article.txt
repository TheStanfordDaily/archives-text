# How The University Utilizes The Power Of Secrecy
## 
### ROBERT FUSS Analysis Commentary 
The plan to establish a liaison
committee between the city of
Palo Alto and the University has
run into a thorny problem:
Stanford's insistence on secrecy.
The University killed a similar
proposal six years ago by refusing
to abide by the Brown Act, the
California law that bans
governmental secrecy in almost all
cases.
Stanford, of course, is a private
organization not subject to the
Brown Act. But the city is subject
to the act, and the University's
demand for secrecy may y.et
scuttle the liaison proposal.
The proposal is far from the
only example of Stanford secrecy.
All too frequently, the University
chooses to operate in a shroud of
secrecy — which University
officials prefer to call privacy —
that extends from the Board of
Trustees down to student-faculty
committees.
Trustees President Robert
Minge Brown declares his belief in
"the need to have a private

discussion of how to approach an
issue before we have a public
discussion of the issue."
Private Meetings
The Board of Trustees meets
privately once a month, dividing
meeting sites between northern
and southern California. Its
agenda, bound in white and
marked "Confidential," is not
distributed to the press, and
the public must rely on University
press releases for all information.
News of board actions comes
through Frederic O. Glover,
University secretary and the
liaison with the board. He never
records votes, or the contents of
Trustee discussions or committee
reports.
Glover says he fears that "you
wouldn't get the frank expression
of opinion" if discussions were
reported publicly. "You ought to
be able to speak without someone
being able to say later, 'You said
that.'"
'Private' vs. 'Secret'
University President Richard
W. Lyman draws a distinction
between "private" and "secret"

discussions. "All sorts of bodies
hold meetings that are private, but
not necessarily secret. The degree
to which the board's activities
could be fairly described as secret
is quite limited. Private they
certainly are."
Some student and faculty
leaders attend Trustee committee
meetings, but the full Board meets
only behind closed doors. Even in
the committees, it is understood
by all participants that statements
may not be attributed to any
individuals, and that all reports
and recommendations to the full
board are to be kept confidential.
Under the Brown Act,
executive (secret) meetings are
allowed only when personnel or
contract matters are under
discussion. Glover says the
Stanford Board could conceivably
function under a similar system,
but that to do so "would be very
difficult and greatly complicate
the procedures."
'Greater Disclosure'
Secrecy is not a new
development here, and actually,
says University News Service
Director Robert W. Beyers, "the
trend has been towards greater
disclosure."
"In 1961, everybody — but
everybody — operated behind
closed doors," he says, noting that
it was not until 1968 that
then-University President Kenneth
Pitzer even began the policy of
disclosing board actions.
Beyers also points out that
since 1968, both the Academic
Council and Faculty Senate have

opened their meetings to
reporters.
Therp was a recent exception,
though,'when Provost William F.
Miller presented the proposed
University budget to the Faculty
Senate and to some students.
Reporters were allowed to remain
at the Senate meeting; however,
they were warned that the budget
was confidential and could not be
released. Later, that restriction
was slightly loosened.
Lyman explained the embargo
on information by saying he
didn't want to present the Board
of Trustees with a "fait accompli"
in the form of a proposed budget
that had already been discussed
before it reached the Trustees for
action.
It was only after the Board
approved the budget that it was
fully released.
Closed-Mouthed
The Trustees are far from the
only agency that conducts itself in
secrecy; the Committee of Fifteen
(C-15) — charged with devising a
judicial system to handle student
disciplinary cases — is similarly
closed-mouthed.
The C-15 is composed of six
students, six faculty members,
and three administrators. Jim
Anderson, 1972-73 C-15 chairman
and a student, defends secrecy in
its operation.
"The belief is that you get
more open and frank discussion if
it is closed. If it's open, factions
get locked into a side and it's
more difficult to reach
compromises."

The operating rules o f the C-15
provide that "ordinary meetings
will be closed, and discussion will
be considered confidential." The
rules also direct that minutes must
be restricted to reporting action
taken, and that votes should be
recorded by numerical total only.
Student committee members
are allowed to discuss the issues
with other students, but never to
say who on the committee favors
what, or what options are being
considered by the committee.
"It is not wise to tell people
our tentative proposals. We told
members not to mention
personalities at all," Anderson
recounts.
Secrecy is a major component
in the entire committee system of
the Faculty Senate.
Confidential
Chapter six of the Senate's
rules prescribe that "any matter
of deliberation which is deemed
by a committee to be
confidential, or any information
received by a committee in
confidence, shall be held as such
by its members."
Section four provides that
"records of committees' actions
and deliberations should be open
for inspection by members of the
University, within appropriate
standards of confidentiality."
Finally, they provide that each
committee can decide whether its
minutes are confidential, as can
the academic secretary.
H. Donald Winbigler,
Stanford's academic secretary,
says that all the minutes are open

and none are confidential. He
admits, though, that committees
don't put anything in the minutes
that they don't want revealed and
votes are usually recorded by
totals only.
Lower Level
Secrecy even extends to
lower-level University officials.
Hiree months ago, the Phi Delta
Theta fraternity held a rush party
featuring nude dancers; one
dancer was raffled off to a visiting
17-year-old high school student.
After the incident was first
reported, there was a concerted
effort to stop, or at least slow,
further information.
Bob Major, president of the
fraternity, asked several reporters
not to publicize any further
information about the party. An
unidentified Phi Delt alumnus in
the University administration had
suggested that he not speak to
reporters.
Director of Fraternities
Norman Robinson told him that
the matter was "between the Phi
Delts and the University."
Robinson also proved less than
communicative with reporters at
times.

The range of University secrecy
is immense. Questions as diverse
as the fate of a Stanford overseas
campus and the number of
Stanford students with SAT's over
700 are kept confidential.
Secrecy is not so obvious a
problem when so few people
clamor for the number of
Stanford students with SAT's over
700. It's a different matter in a
controversial issue — for example,
the closing of the overseas campus
in Vienna. Students circulating
petitions to keep the campus
open, and many others interested
in its future, heard only rumors of
the deliberations of the
Committee on Foreign Studies.
When quizzed by reporters, the
committee members sounded a
familiar tune: committee rules
prevented them from
commenting.
Legally, Stanford is a private
university and can act as privately
as it wants. Like the city of Palo
Alto, it deals with matters of
legitimate public concern and
interest; unlike Palo Alto, it is not
required ,to — and usually won't —
open its operations to public
scrutiny.

All too frequently, the University
chooses to operate in a shroud of
secrecy — which University
officials prefer to call privacy —
that extends from the Board of
Trustees down to student-faculty
committees.
Trustees President Robert
Minge Brown declares his belief in
"the need to have a private

discussion of how to approach an
issue before we have a public
discussion of the issue."
Private Meetings
The Board of Trustees meets
privately once a month, dividing
meeting sites between northern
and southern California. Its
agenda, bound in white and
marked "Confidential," is not
distributed to the press, and
the public must rely on University
press releases for all information.
News of board actions comes
through Frederic O. Glover,
University secretary and the
liaison with the board. He never
records votes, or the contents of
Trustee discussions or committee
reports.
Glover says he fears that "you
wouldn't get the frank expression
of opinion" if discussions were
reported publicly. "You ought to
be able to speak without someone
being able to say later, 'You said
that.'"
'Private' vs. 'Secret'
University President Richard
W. Lyman draws a distinction
between "private" and "secret"

discussions. "All sorts of bodies
hold meetings that are private, but
not necessarily secret. The degree
to which the board's activities
could be fairly described as secret
is quite limited. Private they
certainly are."
Some student and faculty
leaders attend Trustee committee
meetings, but the full Board meets
only behind closed doors. Even in
the committees, it is understood
by all participants that statements
may not be attributed to any
individuals, and that all reports
and recommendations to the full
board are to be kept confidential.
Under the Brown Act,
executive (secret) meetings are
allowed only when personnel or
contract matters are under
discussion. Glover says the
Stanford Board could conceivably
function under a similar system,
but that to do so "would be very
difficult and greatly complicate
the procedures."
'Greater Disclosure'
Secrecy is not a new
development here, and actually,
says University News Service
Director Robert W. Beyers, "the
trend has been towards greater
disclosure."
"In 1961, everybody — but
everybody — operated behind
closed doors," he says, noting that
it was not until 1968 that
then-University President Kenneth
Pitzer even began the policy of
disclosing board actions.
Beyers also points out that
since 1968, both the Academic
Council and Faculty Senate have

opened their meetings to
reporters.
Therp was a recent exception,
though,'when Provost William F.
Miller presented the proposed
University budget to the Faculty
Senate and to some students.
Reporters were allowed to remain
at the Senate meeting; however,
they were warned that the budget
was confidential and could not be
released. Later, that restriction
was slightly loosened.
Lyman explained the embargo
on information by saying he
didn't want to present the Board
of Trustees with a "fait accompli"
in the form of a proposed budget
that had already been discussed
before it reached the Trustees for
action.
It was only after the Board
approved the budget that it was
fully released.
Closed-Mouthed
The Trustees are far from the
only agency that conducts itself in
secrecy; the Committee of Fifteen
(C-15) — charged with devising a
judicial system to handle student
disciplinary cases — is similarly
closed-mouthed.
The C-15 is composed of six
students, six faculty members,
and three administrators. Jim
Anderson, 1972-73 C-15 chairman
and a student, defends secrecy in
its operation.
"The belief is that you get
more open and frank discussion if
it is closed. If it's open, factions
get locked into a side and it's
more difficult to reach
compromises."

The operating rules o f the C-15
provide that "ordinary meetings
will be closed, and discussion will
be considered confidential." The
rules also direct that minutes must
be restricted to reporting action
taken, and that votes should be
recorded by numerical total only.
Student committee members
are allowed to discuss the issues
with other students, but never to
say who on the committee favors
what, or what options are being
considered by the committee.
"It is not wise to tell people
our tentative proposals. We told
members not to mention
personalities at all," Anderson
recounts.
Secrecy is a major component
in the entire committee system of
the Faculty Senate.
Confidential
Chapter six of the Senate's
rules prescribe that "any matter
of deliberation which is deemed
by a committee to be
confidential, or any information
received by a committee in
confidence, shall be held as such
by its members."
Section four provides that
"records of committees' actions
and deliberations should be open
for inspection by members of the
University, within appropriate
standards of confidentiality."
Finally, they provide that each
committee can decide whether its
minutes are confidential, as can
the academic secretary.
H. Donald Winbigler,
Stanford's academic secretary,
says that all the minutes are open

and none are confidential. He
admits, though, that committees
don't put anything in the minutes
that they don't want revealed and
votes are usually recorded by
totals only.
Lower Level
Secrecy even extends to
lower-level University officials.
Hiree months ago, the Phi Delta
Theta fraternity held a rush party
featuring nude dancers; one
dancer was raffled off to a visiting
17-year-old high school student.
After the incident was first
reported, there was a concerted
effort to stop, or at least slow,
further information.
Bob Major, president of the
fraternity, asked several reporters
not to publicize any further
information about the party. An
unidentified Phi Delt alumnus in
the University administration had
suggested that he not speak to
reporters.
Director of Fraternities
Norman Robinson told him that
the matter was "between the Phi
Delts and the University."
Robinson also proved less than
communicative with reporters at
times.

The range of University secrecy
is immense. Questions as diverse
as the fate of a Stanford overseas
campus and the number of
Stanford students with SAT's over
700 are kept confidential.
Secrecy is not so obvious a
problem when so few people
clamor for the number of
Stanford students with SAT's over
700. It's a different matter in a
controversial issue — for example,
the closing of the overseas campus
in Vienna. Students circulating
petitions to keep the campus
open, and many others interested
in its future, heard only rumors of
the deliberations of the
Committee on Foreign Studies.
When quizzed by reporters, the
committee members sounded a
familiar tune: committee rules
prevented them from
commenting.
Legally, Stanford is a private
university and can act as privately
as it wants. Like the city of Palo
Alto, it deals with matters of
legitimate public concern and
interest; unlike Palo Alto, it is not
required ,to — and usually won't —
open its operations to public
scrutiny.
The plan to establish a liaison
committee between the city of
Palo Alto and the University has
run into a thorny problem:
Stanford's insistence on secrecy.
The University killed a similar
proposal six years ago by refusing
to abide by the Brown Act, the
California law that bans
governmental secrecy in almost all
cases.
Stanford, of course, is a private
organization not subject to the
Brown Act. But the city is subject
to the act, and the University's
demand for secrecy may y.et
scuttle the liaison proposal.

News of board actions comes
through Frederic O. Glover,
University secretary and the
liaison with the board. He never
records votes, or the contents of
Trustee discussions or committee
reports.
Glover says he fears that "you
wouldn't get the frank expression
of opinion" if discussions were
reported publicly. "You ought to
be able to speak without someone
being able to say later, 'You said
that.'"
'Private' vs. 'Secret'
University President Richard
W. Lyman draws a distinction
between "private" and "secret"

discussions. "All sorts of bodies
hold meetings that are private, but
not necessarily secret. The degree
to which the board's activities
could be fairly described as secret
is quite limited. Private they
certainly are."
Some student and faculty
leaders attend Trustee committee
meetings, but the full Board meets
only behind closed doors. Even in
the committees, it is understood
by all participants that statements
may not be attributed to any
individuals, and that all reports
and recommendations to the full
board are to be kept confidential.
Under the Brown Act,
executive (secret) meetings are
allowed only when personnel or
contract matters are under
discussion. Glover says the
Stanford Board could conceivably
function under a similar system,
but that to do so "would be very
difficult and greatly complicate
the procedures."
'Greater Disclosure'
Secrecy is not a new
development here, and actually,
says University News Service
Director Robert W. Beyers, "the
trend has been towards greater
disclosure."
"In 1961, everybody — but
everybody — operated behind
closed doors," he says, noting that
it was not until 1968 that
then-University President Kenneth
Pitzer even began the policy of
disclosing board actions.
Beyers also points out that
since 1968, both the Academic
Council and Faculty Senate have

opened their meetings to
reporters.
Therp was a recent exception,
though,'when Provost William F.
Miller presented the proposed
University budget to the Faculty
Senate and to some students.
Reporters were allowed to remain
at the Senate meeting; however,
they were warned that the budget
was confidential and could not be
released. Later, that restriction
was slightly loosened.
Lyman explained the embargo
on information by saying he
didn't want to present the Board
of Trustees with a "fait accompli"
in the form of a proposed budget
that had already been discussed
before it reached the Trustees for
action.
It was only after the Board
approved the budget that it was
fully released.
Closed-Mouthed
The Trustees are far from the
only agency that conducts itself in
secrecy; the Committee of Fifteen
(C-15) — charged with devising a
judicial system to handle student
disciplinary cases — is similarly
closed-mouthed.
The C-15 is composed of six
students, six faculty members,
and three administrators. Jim
Anderson, 1972-73 C-15 chairman
and a student, defends secrecy in
its operation.
"The belief is that you get
more open and frank discussion if
it is closed. If it's open, factions
get locked into a side and it's
more difficult to reach
compromises."

The operating rules o f the C-15
provide that "ordinary meetings
will be closed, and discussion will
be considered confidential." The
rules also direct that minutes must
be restricted to reporting action
taken, and that votes should be
recorded by numerical total only.
Student committee members
are allowed to discuss the issues
with other students, but never to
say who on the committee favors
what, or what options are being
considered by the committee.
"It is not wise to tell people
our tentative proposals. We told
members not to mention
personalities at all," Anderson
recounts.
Secrecy is a major component
in the entire committee system of
the Faculty Senate.
Confidential
Chapter six of the Senate's
rules prescribe that "any matter
of deliberation which is deemed
by a committee to be
confidential, or any information
received by a committee in
confidence, shall be held as such
by its members."
Section four provides that
"records of committees' actions
and deliberations should be open
for inspection by members of the
University, within appropriate
standards of confidentiality."
Finally, they provide that each
committee can decide whether its
minutes are confidential, as can
the academic secretary.
H. Donald Winbigler,
Stanford's academic secretary,
says that all the minutes are open

and none are confidential. He
admits, though, that committees
don't put anything in the minutes
that they don't want revealed and
votes are usually recorded by
totals only.
Lower Level
Secrecy even extends to
lower-level University officials.
Hiree months ago, the Phi Delta
Theta fraternity held a rush party
featuring nude dancers; one
dancer was raffled off to a visiting
17-year-old high school student.
After the incident was first
reported, there was a concerted
effort to stop, or at least slow,
further information.
Bob Major, president of the
fraternity, asked several reporters
not to publicize any further
information about the party. An
unidentified Phi Delt alumnus in
the University administration had
suggested that he not speak to
reporters.
Director of Fraternities
Norman Robinson told him that
the matter was "between the Phi
Delts and the University."
Robinson also proved less than
communicative with reporters at
times.

The range of University secrecy
is immense. Questions as diverse
as the fate of a Stanford overseas
campus and the number of
Stanford students with SAT's over
700 are kept confidential.
Secrecy is not so obvious a
problem when so few people
clamor for the number of
Stanford students with SAT's over
700. It's a different matter in a
controversial issue — for example,
the closing of the overseas campus
in Vienna. Students circulating
petitions to keep the campus
open, and many others interested
in its future, heard only rumors of
the deliberations of the
Committee on Foreign Studies.
When quizzed by reporters, the
committee members sounded a
familiar tune: committee rules
prevented them from
commenting.
Legally, Stanford is a private
university and can act as privately
as it wants. Like the city of Palo
Alto, it deals with matters of
legitimate public concern and
interest; unlike Palo Alto, it is not
required ,to — and usually won't —
open its operations to public
scrutiny.
The plan to establish a liaison
committee between the city of
Palo Alto and the University has
run into a thorny problem:
Stanford's insistence on secrecy.
The University killed a similar
proposal six years ago by refusing
to abide by the Brown Act, the
California law that bans
governmental secrecy in almost all
cases.
Stanford, of course, is a private
organization not subject to the
Brown Act. But the city is subject
to the act, and the University's
demand for secrecy may y.et
scuttle the liaison proposal.
The proposal is far from the
only example of Stanford secrecy.
All too frequently, the University
chooses to operate in a shroud of
secrecy — which University
officials prefer to call privacy —
that extends from the Board of
Trustees down to student-faculty
committees.
Trustees President Robert
Minge Brown declares his belief in
"the need to have a private

discussion of how to approach an
issue before we have a public
discussion of the issue."
Private Meetings
The Board of Trustees meets
privately once a month, dividing
meeting sites between northern
and southern California. Its
agenda, bound in white and
marked "Confidential," is not
distributed to the press, and
the public must rely on University
press releases for all information.

to which the board's activities
could be fairly described as secret
is quite limited. Private they
certainly are."
Some student and faculty
leaders attend Trustee committee
meetings, but the full Board meets
only behind closed doors. Even in
the committees, it is understood
by all participants that statements
may not be attributed to any
individuals, and that all reports
and recommendations to the full
board are to be kept confidential.
Under the Brown Act,
executive (secret) meetings are
allowed only when personnel or
contract matters are under
discussion. Glover says the
Stanford Board could conceivably
function under a similar system,
but that to do so "would be very
difficult and greatly complicate
the procedures."
'Greater Disclosure'
Secrecy is not a new
development here, and actually,
says University News Service
Director Robert W. Beyers, "the
trend has been towards greater
disclosure."
"In 1961, everybody — but
everybody — operated behind
closed doors," he says, noting that
it was not until 1968 that
then-University President Kenneth
Pitzer even began the policy of
disclosing board actions.
Beyers also points out that
since 1968, both the Academic
Council and Faculty Senate have

opened their meetings to
reporters.
Therp was a recent exception,
though,'when Provost William F.
Miller presented the proposed
University budget to the Faculty
Senate and to some students.
Reporters were allowed to remain
at the Senate meeting; however,
they were warned that the budget
was confidential and could not be
released. Later, that restriction
was slightly loosened.
Lyman explained the embargo
on information by saying he
didn't want to present the Board
of Trustees with a "fait accompli"
in the form of a proposed budget
that had already been discussed
before it reached the Trustees for
action.
It was only after the Board
approved the budget that it was
fully released.
Closed-Mouthed
The Trustees are far from the
only agency that conducts itself in
secrecy; the Committee of Fifteen
(C-15) — charged with devising a
judicial system to handle student
disciplinary cases — is similarly
closed-mouthed.
The C-15 is composed of six
students, six faculty members,
and three administrators. Jim
Anderson, 1972-73 C-15 chairman
and a student, defends secrecy in
its operation.
"The belief is that you get
more open and frank discussion if
it is closed. If it's open, factions
get locked into a side and it's
more difficult to reach
compromises."

The operating rules o f the C-15
provide that "ordinary meetings
will be closed, and discussion will
be considered confidential." The
rules also direct that minutes must
be restricted to reporting action
taken, and that votes should be
recorded by numerical total only.
Student committee members
are allowed to discuss the issues
with other students, but never to
say who on the committee favors
what, or what options are being
considered by the committee.
"It is not wise to tell people
our tentative proposals. We told
members not to mention
personalities at all," Anderson
recounts.
Secrecy is a major component
in the entire committee system of
the Faculty Senate.
Confidential
Chapter six of the Senate's
rules prescribe that "any matter
of deliberation which is deemed
by a committee to be
confidential, or any information
received by a committee in
confidence, shall be held as such
by its members."
Section four provides that
"records of committees' actions
and deliberations should be open
for inspection by members of the
University, within appropriate
standards of confidentiality."
Finally, they provide that each
committee can decide whether its
minutes are confidential, as can
the academic secretary.
H. Donald Winbigler,
Stanford's academic secretary,
says that all the minutes are open

and none are confidential. He
admits, though, that committees
don't put anything in the minutes
that they don't want revealed and
votes are usually recorded by
totals only.
Lower Level
Secrecy even extends to
lower-level University officials.
Hiree months ago, the Phi Delta
Theta fraternity held a rush party
featuring nude dancers; one
dancer was raffled off to a visiting
17-year-old high school student.
After the incident was first
reported, there was a concerted
effort to stop, or at least slow,
further information.
Bob Major, president of the
fraternity, asked several reporters
not to publicize any further
information about the party. An
unidentified Phi Delt alumnus in
the University administration had
suggested that he not speak to
reporters.
Director of Fraternities
Norman Robinson told him that
the matter was "between the Phi
Delts and the University."
Robinson also proved less than
communicative with reporters at
times.

The range of University secrecy
is immense. Questions as diverse
as the fate of a Stanford overseas
campus and the number of
Stanford students with SAT's over
700 are kept confidential.
Secrecy is not so obvious a
problem when so few people
clamor for the number of
Stanford students with SAT's over
700. It's a different matter in a
controversial issue — for example,
the closing of the overseas campus
in Vienna. Students circulating
petitions to keep the campus
open, and many others interested
in its future, heard only rumors of
the deliberations of the
Committee on Foreign Studies.
When quizzed by reporters, the
committee members sounded a
familiar tune: committee rules
prevented them from
commenting.
Legally, Stanford is a private
university and can act as privately
as it wants. Like the city of Palo
Alto, it deals with matters of
legitimate public concern and
interest; unlike Palo Alto, it is not
required ,to — and usually won't —
open its operations to public
scrutiny.
The plan to establish a liaison
committee between the city of
Palo Alto and the University has
run into a thorny problem:
Stanford's insistence on secrecy.
The University killed a similar
proposal six years ago by refusing
to abide by the Brown Act, the
California law that bans
governmental secrecy in almost all
cases.
Stanford, of course, is a private
organization not subject to the
Brown Act. But the city is subject
to the act, and the University's
demand for secrecy may y.et
scuttle the liaison proposal.
The proposal is far from the
only example of Stanford secrecy.
All too frequently, the University
chooses to operate in a shroud of
secrecy — which University
officials prefer to call privacy —
that extends from the Board of
Trustees down to student-faculty
committees.
Trustees President Robert
Minge Brown declares his belief in
"the need to have a private

discussion of how to approach an
issue before we have a public
discussion of the issue."
Private Meetings
The Board of Trustees meets
privately once a month, dividing
meeting sites between northern
and southern California. Its
agenda, bound in white and
marked "Confidential," is not
distributed to the press, and
the public must rely on University
press releases for all information.
News of board actions comes
through Frederic O. Glover,
University secretary and the
liaison with the board. He never
records votes, or the contents of
Trustee discussions or committee
reports.
Glover says he fears that "you
wouldn't get the frank expression
of opinion" if discussions were
reported publicly. "You ought to
be able to speak without someone
being able to say later, 'You said
that.'"
'Private' vs. 'Secret'
University President Richard
W. Lyman draws a distinction
between "private" and "secret"

discussions. "All sorts of bodies
hold meetings that are private, but
not necessarily secret. The degree
to which the board's activities
could be fairly described as secret
is quite limited. Private they
certainly are."
Some student and faculty
leaders attend Trustee committee
meetings, but the full Board meets
