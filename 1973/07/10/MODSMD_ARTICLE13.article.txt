# Prof Stands Behind Quake Prediction
## 
### 
Hollister still waits for the
earthquake Geophysics Prof.
Robert Kovach predicted.
Still, Kovach stands by his
theory that a "good size"
earthquake should occur soon in
the Hollister area.
"But our ability to pinpoint
the time is not as accurate as we
would like," he concedes.
On June 20, the geophysicist
forecasted a quake measuring 5.8
on the Richter scale would occur
near the central California
community within two weeks.
Kovach's prediction followed one
by the U.S. Geological Survey
(USGS) for a 4.5 magnitude
earthquake "within several
rro.nths" in the same vicinity.
A "emor of magnitude 2.5
shook tne area July 5; however
that quake was small compared to
the one expected.
Kovach cites three independent
lines of evidence supporting this
prediction.
The first, based on the theory
of Asst. Geophysics Prof. Amos
Nur and Prof. C.H. Scholz of
Columbia, shows that an extensive
drop and prolonged recovery
period for water levels in a

600-foot well drilled near
Hollister signals a quake.
The second stems from the
presence of a very quiet segment
between two more active zones of
the San Andreas fault. USGS used
this indication in its prediction.
The third is historical. In 1961,
when there were two quakes of
more than Richter 5.0 magnitude
near Hollister, both were preceded
by a period of accelerated fault
creep.
Kovach visits the drilling site
several times each week. Two
recording drums in the lobby of
the Earth Sciences Building here
provide telemetered data from
USGS monitoring stations on
Anzar Rd., between Hollister and
Gilroy, and San Juan Bautista.
The USGS forecast in April
was the first official earthquake
prediction. The number of
forecasts is expected to increase as
scientific recording and theories
for explaining these events
improve. As long-range objectives
Kovach and other experts hope to
develop means of controlling
earthquakes, possibly by inducing
a series of small ones where a large
one appears imminent.
