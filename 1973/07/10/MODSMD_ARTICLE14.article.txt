# Stage Biography Of Lenny Bruce Closes
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
SAN FRANCISCO—The biting
humor and social comment of the
late Lenny Bruce carried the stage
production of Lenny as far as
possible, but the show was forced
to close Sunday after a two week
run at Bimbo's 365
Theatre-Restaurant in San
Francisco.
Mediocre acting and staging
doomed this San Francisco
version of the Broadway Tony
Award-winning hit. Robert Fields
was adequate in the role of Lenny
and managed to breathe some life
into Bruce's material. The
supporting actors gave
undistinguished performances,

however, and detracted from
Field's characterization.
The concept of presenting
Lenny Bruce's material live is an
exciting one. The tragedy of
Lenny Bruce is a lesson that
should not be forgotten in these
times of increasing censorship.
The play traces the development
of his humor and personal
problems from 1951 until his
death in 1966 and it is incredible
to think that even much of his
early humor is ahead of our time.
Fields best moment is when he
does one of Bruce's bits aimed at
the Catholic Church. He takes the
position of God looking down on
his flock.

"What the hell are the Gideons
doing shoving my bibles in motel
drawers?
"What are fifty Puerto Ricans
doing living in that room for when
that stained glass window there
costs 10 G's a square foot?
A quick change transforms
Fields into a Catholic priest
replete with gaudy vestments and
precious jewels. Upon seeing
Christ and Moses enter his church
to check things out, he panics and
gets on the phone to the Pope.
Dago Cars
"Hey Johnny, get the hell
down here and help us. What do
we pay you protection for? Oh,
and by the way, can you get Billy

Graham a good deal on one of
those dago sports cars?"
Nothing was sacred to Lenny
Bruce and Fields recreates some
of his best sketches. He took a jab
at the House Committee on
Un-American Activities —
mocking the committee's
operations, Fields questions a
potential subversive.
"All right Big Daddy Warbucks,
what are you three doing — you,
the kid, and the dog? Why can't
you see her pupils? Is it true that
'Arf means 'nexf?" There are
few things more sacred than one
of America's most popular comic
strips, and Lenny could not resist
hinting at the possibility of

unnatural sexual acts among the
trio.
Famous Bits
Famous Lenny Bruce bits like
the Lone Ranger and the Prison
Break are in the play, but Lenny's
life off-stage occupies 50 percent
of the production. This is where
the acting breaks down as the cast
struggles to portray the inner
workings of Lenny and the
societal forces he was up against.
The script is good, but the play
bogs down when Field's makes an
overemotional pitch for Lenny.
Excellent points are made, but in
a fashion that renders them
ineffective. "It's information that
keeps the country strong" Lenny
pleads, "You need the deviate to
speak up and tell us what is wrong
with us. The more you crack
down on him, the more you need
him."
It is too bad that Lenny did
not make it in San Francisco.
Theatre attendance is poor in the
City this summer and Lenny was
one of the first victims. The
production just was not
professional enough, but even this
could not dilute the brilliance of
Bruce's humor. The play was
worth seeing just for the already
immortal lines of Lenny Bruce.
In one ironic sense, the play
was much like Lenny's life. He
didn't fail. It was the scene
around him that went bad.

The script is good, but the play
bogs down when Field's makes an
overemotional pitch for Lenny.
Excellent points are made, but in
a fashion that renders them
ineffective. "It's information that
keeps the country strong" Lenny
pleads, "You need the deviate to
speak up and tell us what is wrong
with us. The more you crack
down on him, the more you need
him."
It is too bad that Lenny did
not make it in San Francisco.
Theatre attendance is poor in the
City this summer and Lenny was
one of the first victims. The
production just was not
professional enough, but even this
could not dilute the brilliance of
Bruce's humor. The play was
worth seeing just for the already
immortal lines of Lenny Bruce.
In one ironic sense, the play
was much like Lenny's life. He
didn't fail. It was the scene
around him that went bad.

LENNY'S LlFE—Although Lenny, a play-with-music based on the life
and words of the late comedian Lenny Bruce, was a hit on Broadway,
waning summer attendance at all San Francisco theaters have forced
its early demise here. Pictured above are Dort Clark and Robert Fields
in a scene from the play that draws on fantasy and fact to dramatize
the events of the controversial comedian's life.
SAN FRANCISCO—The biting
humor and social comment of the
late Lenny Bruce carried the stage
production of Lenny as far as
possible, but the show was forced
to close Sunday after a two week
run at Bimbo's 365
Theatre-Restaurant in San
Francisco.
Mediocre acting and staging
doomed this San Francisco
version of the Broadway Tony
Award-winning hit. Robert Fields
was adequate in the role of Lenny
and managed to breathe some life
into Bruce's material. The
supporting actors gave
undistinguished performances,

however, and detracted from
Field's characterization.
The concept of presenting
Lenny Bruce's material live is an
exciting one. The tragedy of
Lenny Bruce is a lesson that
should not be forgotten in these
times of increasing censorship.
The play traces the development
of his humor and personal
problems from 1951 until his
death in 1966 and it is incredible
to think that even much of his
early humor is ahead of our time.
Fields best moment is when he
does one of Bruce's bits aimed at
the Catholic Church. He takes the
position of God looking down on
his flock.

"What the hell are the Gideons
doing shoving my bibles in motel
drawers?
"What are fifty Puerto Ricans
doing living in that room for when
that stained glass window there
costs 10 G's a square foot?
A quick change transforms
Fields into a Catholic priest
replete with gaudy vestments and
precious jewels. Upon seeing
Christ and Moses enter his church
to check things out, he panics and
gets on the phone to the Pope.
Dago Cars
"Hey Johnny, get the hell
down here and help us. What do
we pay you protection for? Oh,
and by the way, can you get Billy

Graham a good deal on one of
those dago sports cars?"
Nothing was sacred to Lenny
Bruce and Fields recreates some
of his best sketches. He took a jab
at the House Committee on
Un-American Activities —
mocking the committee's
operations, Fields questions a
potential subversive.
"All right Big Daddy Warbucks,
what are you three doing — you,
the kid, and the dog? Why can't
you see her pupils? Is it true that
'Arf means 'nexf?" There are
few things more sacred than one
of America's most popular comic
strips, and Lenny could not resist
hinting at the possibility of

unnatural sexual acts among the
trio.
Famous Bits
Famous Lenny Bruce bits like
the Lone Ranger and the Prison
Break are in the play, but Lenny's
life off-stage occupies 50 percent
of the production. This is where
the acting breaks down as the cast
struggles to portray the inner
workings of Lenny and the
societal forces he was up against.
The script is good, but the play
bogs down when Field's makes an
overemotional pitch for Lenny.
