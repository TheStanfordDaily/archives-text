# 'The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing'
## Burt Reynolds' Body Saves Tired Plot 
### DICK FITZGERALD 
The Man Who Loved Cat
Dancing is a cinematic daydream
that contains all the elements of
the classic Western.
It's all there — the train
robbery, the chase with the posse,
a love affair, and a woman (Sarah
Miles) who renounces her husband
(George Hamilton) for the outlaw
(Burt Reynolds).
Of course, there are plenty of
fights, overturned tables, and
Indians. A white-haired chief
sagely utters such wise epigrams as
"White man always leave out best
part of story."

Plenty of swearing, spiced with
such lines as "We'd all sleep better
if we humped her," rounds out
the dialogue. And for sex, there
are side-angle shots of Sarah Miles
and full-angle shots of Burt
Reynolds.
Predictable And Adequate
The Man Who Loved Cat
Dancing is a usual collection of
situations and plots moviegoers
have seen many times, yet the
film is never outrageously bad.
Sarah Miles' acting is good,
considering the role she must
play, and Burt Reynolds also
holds up admirably under a
similar handicap although he
smirks too much in his role of the
sexual object.
For a true film connoisseur,
there is little of interest in the
film; although the director, writer,
cameramen, and actors perform
adequately, they do nothing that
is exciting or insightful.
But for the sociologist, the film
has something to offer. It is less a
portrait of the American West or
an example of good film-making
than a commentary on modern
film-makers and their intended
mass audiences.
The producers must have

thought the movie would appeal
to someone. In general two cliches
run throughout the film — the
"good bad man" and "woman as
private property." The producer
or director must believe the
audience would accept and even
want both.
But why are these two cliches
employed in an age when
audiences are purported to be
more sexually sophisticated and
less willing to accept cliches?
Identity Crisis
Were the producers right in
assuming that the average
film-goer really identifies with the
Burt Reynolds character?
Reynolds' outlaw is both
independent and asocial (he
robbed a train) yet underneath he
is a decent American. (He is angry
when his partner kills a man
during the same robbery, and
before some mysterious event, he
was a hard working army officer
up from the ranks.)
Further, he is a man who has
no trouble with women, that is,
he doesn't look like a fool in sex
scenes. And perhaps most
important he portrays a white
man who knows the high country
and speaks Shoshone.
More enigmatic is the cliche
that woman are private sexual
property. I can't believe a modern
woman would accept a film that
presents this role as if it weren't at
all unusual.
The Plot Thickens
We learn that Burt Reynolds
killed a man who slept with his
first wife, a squaw named Cat
Dancing. At the end of the film
we further discover that he even
killed Cat Dancing in the same fit
of jealousy.
Sarah Miles' husband believes it
is his right to publicly slap Sarah
in the face because she implicitly
shows she would rather sleep with
the outlaw.
The Perils of Sarah
Nearly one half the film is then
occupied with men trying to rape
the heroine. She is constantly
forced on her back. No woman
since The Perils of Pauline has had
to fend off as many unwanted
affections — white men and
Indians, old and young, singly,

and in groups.
The interest of the film lies not
in seeing it, but in learning
whether or not it will be
successful. One wonders if
film-goers can accept the Burt
Reynolds character and cliche
that women are sex objects to be
owned or raped.
The Man Who Loved Cat
Dancing is the daydream of a male
chauvinist pig who lacks
imagination. But for those who
still dream of going to Alaska
where a man can be free to
homestead and hunt while his
wife bakes homemade bread, it is
an entertaining film.
And even if the plot drags on,
there is always the sight of Burt
Reynolds' beautiful bod, straight
out of Cosmopolitan.

independent and asocial (he
robbed a train) yet underneath he
is a decent American. (He is angry
when his partner kills a man
during the same robbery, and
before some mysterious event, he
was a hard working army officer
up from the ranks.)
Further, he is a man who has
no trouble with women, that is,
he doesn't look like a fool in sex
scenes. And perhaps most
important he portrays a white
man who knows the high country
and speaks Shoshone.
More enigmatic is the cliche
that woman are private sexual
property. I can't believe a modern
woman would accept a film that
presents this role as if it weren't at
all unusual.
The Plot Thickens
We learn that Burt Reynolds
killed a man who slept with his
first wife, a squaw named Cat
Dancing. At the end of the film
we further discover that he even
killed Cat Dancing in the same fit
of jealousy.
Sarah Miles' husband believes it
is his right to publicly slap Sarah
in the face because she implicitly
shows she would rather sleep with
the outlaw.
The Perils of Sarah
Nearly one half the film is then
occupied with men trying to rape
the heroine. She is constantly
forced on her back. No woman
since The Perils of Pauline has had
to fend off as many unwanted
affections — white men and
Indians, old and young, singly,

and in groups.
The interest of the film lies not
in seeing it, but in learning
whether or not it will be
successful. One wonders if
film-goers can accept the Burt
Reynolds character and cliche
that women are sex objects to be
owned or raped.
The Man Who Loved Cat
Dancing is the daydream of a male
chauvinist pig who lacks
imagination. But for those who
still dream of going to Alaska
where a man can be free to
homestead and hunt while his
wife bakes homemade bread, it is
an entertaining film.
And even if the plot drags on,
there is always the sight of Burt
Reynolds' beautiful bod, straight
out of Cosmopolitan.
The Man Who Loved Cat
Dancing is a cinematic daydream
that contains all the elements of
the classic Western.
It's all there — the train
robbery, the chase with the posse,
a love affair, and a woman (Sarah
Miles) who renounces her husband
(George Hamilton) for the outlaw
(Burt Reynolds).
Of course, there are plenty of
fights, overturned tables, and
Indians. A white-haired chief
sagely utters such wise epigrams as
"White man always leave out best
part of story."

Plenty of swearing, spiced with
such lines as "We'd all sleep better
if we humped her," rounds out
the dialogue. And for sex, there
are side-angle shots of Sarah Miles
and full-angle shots of Burt
Reynolds.
Predictable And Adequate
The Man Who Loved Cat
Dancing is a usual collection of
situations and plots moviegoers
have seen many times, yet the
film is never outrageously bad.
Sarah Miles' acting is good,
considering the role she must
play, and Burt Reynolds also
holds up admirably under a
similar handicap although he
smirks too much in his role of the
sexual object.
For a true film connoisseur,
there is little of interest in the
film; although the director, writer,
cameramen, and actors perform
adequately, they do nothing that
is exciting or insightful.
But for the sociologist, the film
has something to offer. It is less a
portrait of the American West or
an example of good film-making
than a commentary on modern
film-makers and their intended
mass audiences.
The producers must have

thought the movie would appeal
to someone. In general two cliches
run throughout the film — the
"good bad man" and "woman as
private property." The producer
or director must believe the
audience would accept and even
want both.
But why are these two cliches
employed in an age when
audiences are purported to be
more sexually sophisticated and
less willing to accept cliches?
Identity Crisis
Were the producers right in
assuming that the average
film-goer really identifies with the
Burt Reynolds character?
Reynolds' outlaw is both
independent and asocial (he
robbed a train) yet underneath he
is a decent American. (He is angry
when his partner kills a man
during the same robbery, and
before some mysterious event, he
was a hard working army officer
up from the ranks.)
