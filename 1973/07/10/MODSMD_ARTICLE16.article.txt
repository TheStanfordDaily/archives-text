## Sensitive Handling Of Fatal Illness Highlights Moralistic Film Romance 
### JON R. KENNEDY 
Love and Pain and the Whole Damn Thing
is the story of an older woman with a fatal
disease falling in love with a young man.
Maggie Smith is the older woman, Miss Fisher,
in a role reminiscent of the one she created in
The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, and Timothy
Bottoms is the youth, Walter Elbertson.
Critics have duly noted that this is the first
opportunity Bottoms has had to prove himself
an actor. Bottoms manifests the considerable
ability demanded by the role. His character is
the somewhat thick-skulled son of a
Pulitzer-Prize-winning author-professor, a boy
who feels intimidated by intellectual interests
and conversation.
Director Alan J. Pakala (The Sterile
Cuckoo) demonstrates this cleverly by
switching from a scene in the father's library
where the talk is theoretical philosophical
jargon to another where the son is making his
way through Spain with a college Spanish
dass. His classmates' attempts to
communicate in Spanish leave him as
bewildered as his father's circle of intellectual
friends.
Sketchy Background
Walter's background is left undeveloped
except for the sketchy information about his
father, leaving us to think him a total product
of his culture. Total, but not typical, at least
not stereo-typical, though there may be far
more Walters making their way through the
junior college liberal arts factories than the
movies and literature represent.
A victim of hay fever which prevents him
keeping up with the other members of his
bicycle tour group in Spain, Walter abandons
his bike for a bus tour, finding a seat next to
Miss Fisher. Walter is messy; besides his
hay-fever sniffles he carries melting Almond
Joy bars which get on Miss Fisher's clothes.
She is at first repulsed, but after another
member of the group nearer her own age — a

fresh Latin-lover type - tries to put the make
on her, finds the unassuming Walter a more
desirable companion.
Advances, Rejections
After they become friends, Walter makes
advances on her as though it is the expected
thing at this stage in a male-female
relationship. She rejects him and drops out of
the bus tour, staying behind in her hotel room
to get drunk and take medicine, perhaps an
overdose.
Walter, suspecting that he made her
unhappy and spoiled her tour with his
bungling attempts at making out, returns to
her hotel to apologize decently and, after her
recovery succeeds in seducing her at last, using
a bit more finesse. But now it is more than
just the thing to do, it is motivated by real
affection.
After they have been together intimately,
he rents a car and camper-trailer and
persuades Miss Fisher to continue their tour
without a busload of onlookers.
Sensitive Handling
The way Miss Fisher's illness is handled is
one of the film's major assets — it is
introduced almost by innuendo until the
relationship is far advanced. One suspects that
Miss Fisher, a spinster who apparently runs a
boarding home for the elderly and infirm back
in England, is having the one and only affair
of her lifetime and, for that matter, so is
Walter.
It isn't until Walter insists on marrying her
and her protestations of generation gap fail
that she makes her fatal illness, which is never
identified but apparently could go on another
seven years or so, the crucial issue. Then
Walter, saddened but wiser, does what is
socially expected. He returns to Aspen to pick
up life where he'd left off.
Not until he realizes that he had no life
before — just uncomfortable moments around
home and constant bouts with asthma — does

he recognize his tragic mistake.
Marriage Proposal
The play's dramatic highlight is the
moment he insists that marriage is right for
them; there is no reason why they couldn't be
happy, after all they've been through on their
camper tour, he protests. "We've known love
and pain and the whole damn thing, so why
shouldn't we be married?"
The film's strengths are in its theatrical art;
Pakala knows just how to make a point
without overstating it, how to make an
awkward situation funny without
embarrassing himself by letting it get out of
hand.
The story is reminiscent of several others:
Harold and Maude, and Love Story.
Mechanical Responses
Probably subconscious is the statement
films like Love and Pain make about the crisis
of modern culture. Walter's mechanistic
responses to his circumstances — he has to
make love to the woman because their
relationship has developed to a certain point;
he has to go back to Colorado because one
doesn't marry someone who is dying —
suggest what that statement is.
It's the philosophy of "why not?" that
motivates such pop art as Love and Pain, and
the failure even to squarely face the questions
is to opt for the answer that there is no reason
at all.
It's almost ugly to speak moral issues into
such a pretty, fetchingly executed romance.
But it's the same "morality" that says
democracy is a myth, privacy is a myth,
security in one's own home and one's own
circle of relations is a myth, and if we can
advance ourselves, or our cause, by
transgressing any of those mythical principles,
we'll find adventure in the process and the
success of our enterprise as the reward.
Unfortunately, such popular art is the stuff
Watergates are made of.
