# In The Color And The Noise
## Supergroup Returns? 
### 
Jay Harlow

Not too long ago, there were rumors that the original Buffalo
Springfield would get together again. Recently the original Byrds did
reunite for an album that turned out to be somewhat of a
disappointment. Now we hear of the possible resurrection of Crosby,
Stills, Nash, and Young.
The July 5 issue of Rolling Stone reported that the four were
"closer than ever" to recording another album. Quoting "a source
close to the group," the story told of a gathering on Maui and an
eventual round of "serious rehearsals."
The story closed with the item that they had "booked time in a
San Francisco area studio for an album."
Checking Out Rumors
I decided to check the rumor out, and called Rolling Stone for
more details: nothing. Atlantic Records: nothing.
Next I tried the San Franciscp studio where they recorded in the
past. They knew nothing about it, but suggested that they might be
planning to record at one of their backyard studios, either Graham
Nash's place in the Haight or Neil Young's ranch in Woodside.
So much for investigative reporting. Until more reliable
information becomes available, I'll take the Rolling Stone report with
an optimistic grain of salt.
New Manassas Album
Speaking of Stephen Stills, his new album with Manassas, Down
the Road, reassured me that his voice is not totally shot.
After seeing their TV performance on In Concert, I was afraid that
too many nights of being too drunk and singing too hard had finally
done him in.
On In Concert, Stills actually rewrote the tunes to several of his
songs in order to fit a more limited range, which that night was well
under an octave. However, his voice was back to normal to record this
album.
Unique Style, Social Comment
On the Road contains more of the unique Manassas blend of all
sorts of hyphenated rock, including folk-, country-, and Latin-. Stills'
lyrics have maintained the hard style of social comment, in "Isn't It
About Time" and other songs, reminiscent of his earlier pieces such as
"Word Game."
Chris Hillman's mandolin and Al Perkins' pedal steel and banjo
maintain a solid country feeling on "Do You Remember the
Americans" and other tunes. Joe Lala and some backup people
provide Latin rhythms on "Pensamiento," "Guaguanco de Vero," and
elsewhere.
I am still amazed that this band can play country with Latin
percussion, and Latin with pedal steel, and get away with it as well as
they do.
Stills' Remembrances
The second side of the album seems mainly concerned with the
way things used to be, and the changes Stills has been through. For
example, here is one line from each of the songs on side two:
I remember years ago. . . .
When I was a young man. . . .
When I was a young man long ago. . . .
Sometimes I think of the person I was. . . .
Lookin' back it seems so ridiculously insane. . . .
"Guaguanco de Vero," which includes the line "I was reborn on
the Champs d'Elysee," obviously refers to his recent marriage to
French singer Veronique what's-her-name.
Down the Road is a good album; perhaps not as good as their first,
but still a good showing from a strong band.

I decided to check the rumor out, and called Rolling Stone for
more details: nothing. Atlantic Records: nothing.
Next I tried the San Franciscp studio where they recorded in the
past. They knew nothing about it, but suggested that they might be
planning to record at one of their backyard studios, either Graham
Nash's place in the Haight or Neil Young's ranch in Woodside.
So much for investigative reporting. Until more reliable
information becomes available, I'll take the Rolling Stone report with
an optimistic grain of salt.
New Manassas Album
Speaking of Stephen Stills, his new album with Manassas, Down
the Road, reassured me that his voice is not totally shot.
After seeing their TV performance on In Concert, I was afraid that
too many nights of being too drunk and singing too hard had finally
done him in.
On In Concert, Stills actually rewrote the tunes to several of his
songs in order to fit a more limited range, which that night was well
under an octave. However, his voice was back to normal to record this
album.
Unique Style, Social Comment
On the Road contains more of the unique Manassas blend of all
sorts of hyphenated rock, including folk-, country-, and Latin-. Stills'
lyrics have maintained the hard style of social comment, in "Isn't It
About Time" and other songs, reminiscent of his earlier pieces such as
"Word Game."
Chris Hillman's mandolin and Al Perkins' pedal steel and banjo
maintain a solid country feeling on "Do You Remember the
Americans" and other tunes. Joe Lala and some backup people
provide Latin rhythms on "Pensamiento," "Guaguanco de Vero," and
elsewhere.
I am still amazed that this band can play country with Latin
percussion, and Latin with pedal steel, and get away with it as well as
they do.
Stills' Remembrances
The second side of the album seems mainly concerned with the
way things used to be, and the changes Stills has been through. For
example, here is one line from each of the songs on side two:
I remember years ago. . . .
When I was a young man. . . .
When I was a young man long ago. . . .
Sometimes I think of the person I was. . . .
Lookin' back it seems so ridiculously insane. . . .
"Guaguanco de Vero," which includes the line "I was reborn on
the Champs d'Elysee," obviously refers to his recent marriage to
French singer Veronique what's-her-name.
Down the Road is a good album; perhaps not as good as their first,
but still a good showing from a strong band.

Not too long ago, there were rumors that the original Buffalo
Springfield would get together again. Recently the original Byrds did
reunite for an album that turned out to be somewhat of a
disappointment. Now we hear of the possible resurrection of Crosby,
Stills, Nash, and Young.
The July 5 issue of Rolling Stone reported that the four were
"closer than ever" to recording another album. Quoting "a source
close to the group," the story told of a gathering on Maui and an
eventual round of "serious rehearsals."
The story closed with the item that they had "booked time in a
San Francisco area studio for an album."
