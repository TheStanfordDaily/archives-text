# Brilliant Acting Maintains Interest In 'The Rehearsal'
## 
### BOB SIEGEL 
The Rehearsal by Jean Anouilh
currently being presented by the
drama department at the Nitery is
an enjoyable play threaded with a
veneer of comedy overlying an
intense drama.
The highlight of the
production is the strong acting
performances contributed by the
entire company, and particularly
by Barbara Herring (Lucile), Ross
Graham (Count), and Doug
Broyles (Hero). Director Michael
Gillespie demonstrated a unique
sensitivity in communicating
subtle mood changes through his
actors.
The company held the
audience's attention closely
through the entire play, even
when the action on stage dragged
a bit.
The plot revolves around a
group of contemporary French
aristocrats rehearsing for a play by

Marivaux. By the first
intermission, the characters have
clearly revealed themselves to be
playing the same roles both within
and outside of their rehearsals.
Aura of Unreality
The 18th century Watteau
costuming worn by the company
casts the desired air of unreality
over the play in a manner
reminiscent of Pirandello's Henry
IV.
The leading male is a wealthy
40 year-old count — referred to as
"Tiger" — who goes through a
process of self-discovery during
the coarse of the play.
At first Tiger reflects the same
brash, spoiled traits he
presumably had in boyhood. He
had always lived a life of
amusement and luxury, but now
becomes aware of the shallowness
of his existence and begins
searching for something more. At*
one point he says,"It doesn't
amuse me anymore to amuse
myself."
Romantic Catalyst
The catalyst and focus of
Tiger's renaissance is a simple, 20
year-old working girl named
Lucile who is serving as a
nursemaid for 12 orphans at the
chateau.
Lucile's honesty in
inter-personal relationships
provides a startling contrast to the
contrived behavior of the other
actors. She also searches for the
ingredients of a fulfilling life,
notably love.
Tiger expresses his love for
Lucile in the early stages of the
play. But she does not reciprocate
until later for she has been scared
by the hostility shown toward her
by several other actors and by her
own uncertainty.
Suspicious Relationship
Meanwhile, Tiger's wife,
Countess Elion, grows increasingly
bitter (as her worst suspicions
regarding her husband's feeling's

for Lucile are confirmed. Actress
Doris Settle does a masterful job
of portraying the vitriolic,
scheming countess as her feeling
of desperation grows.
The countess, however,
apparently had not been on
intimate terms with her husband
for years, since he openly
maintained selfish and
lackadaisical Hortensia (played by
Jan Lipman) as his mistress.
Lucile represents a threat to
both the Countess and Hortensia,
but only Elion makes serious
efforts to intervene in the budding
relationship. Much of the last half
of the play is devoted to the
enactment of Elion's plans for
belittling Lucile in the eyes of her
husband.
Cynical Agent
Hero, a cynical shell of the
man he had been 20 years before,
puts on an admirable performance
in a bedroom scene as he becomes
Elion's agent for corrupting
Lucile.
The production's major fault is
that several scenes in the middle
and toward the end were drawn
out through unnecessary
development of characters and
relationships already understood
by the audience. Some well-placed
cutting would have amplified the
play's impact without adversely
affecting its content.
The cast was selected from a
pool of 130-140 experienced
actors and actresses who
auditioned for the six hired
positions. It rehearsed for about
two weeks prior to last Thursday
night's opening performr.nce.
The same company will also
perform in Behan's The
Hostage on July 25-29 and
Goldoni's Servant of Two
Masters on August 2-4, and
8-11. The "Rehearsal will be
presented this Wednesday through
Saturday night beginning at 8
p.m.

Gillespie demonstrated a unique
sensitivity in communicating
subtle mood changes through his
actors.
The company held the
audience's attention closely
through the entire play, even
when the action on stage dragged
a bit.
The plot revolves around a
group of contemporary French
aristocrats rehearsing for a play by

Marivaux. By the first
intermission, the characters have
clearly revealed themselves to be
playing the same roles both within
and outside of their rehearsals.
Aura of Unreality
The 18th century Watteau
costuming worn by the company
casts the desired air of unreality
over the play in a manner
reminiscent of Pirandello's Henry
IV.
The leading male is a wealthy
40 year-old count — referred to as
"Tiger" — who goes through a
process of self-discovery during
the coarse of the play.
At first Tiger reflects the same
brash, spoiled traits he
presumably had in boyhood. He
had always lived a life of
amusement and luxury, but now
becomes aware of the shallowness
of his existence and begins
searching for something more. At*
one point he says,"It doesn't
amuse me anymore to amuse
myself."
Romantic Catalyst
The catalyst and focus of
Tiger's renaissance is a simple, 20
year-old working girl named
Lucile who is serving as a
nursemaid for 12 orphans at the
chateau.
Lucile's honesty in
inter-personal relationships
provides a startling contrast to the
contrived behavior of the other
actors. She also searches for the
ingredients of a fulfilling life,
notably love.
Tiger expresses his love for
Lucile in the early stages of the
play. But she does not reciprocate
until later for she has been scared
by the hostility shown toward her
by several other actors and by her
own uncertainty.
Suspicious Relationship
Meanwhile, Tiger's wife,
Countess Elion, grows increasingly
bitter (as her worst suspicions
regarding her husband's feeling's

for Lucile are confirmed. Actress
Doris Settle does a masterful job
of portraying the vitriolic,
scheming countess as her feeling
of desperation grows.
The countess, however,
apparently had not been on
intimate terms with her husband
for years, since he openly
maintained selfish and
lackadaisical Hortensia (played by
Jan Lipman) as his mistress.
Lucile represents a threat to
both the Countess and Hortensia,
but only Elion makes serious
efforts to intervene in the budding
relationship. Much of the last half
of the play is devoted to the
enactment of Elion's plans for
belittling Lucile in the eyes of her
husband.
Cynical Agent
Hero, a cynical shell of the
man he had been 20 years before,
puts on an admirable performance
in a bedroom scene as he becomes
Elion's agent for corrupting
Lucile.
The production's major fault is
that several scenes in the middle
and toward the end were drawn
out through unnecessary
development of characters and
relationships already understood
by the audience. Some well-placed
cutting would have amplified the
play's impact without adversely
affecting its content.
The cast was selected from a
pool of 130-140 experienced
actors and actresses who
auditioned for the six hired
positions. It rehearsed for about
two weeks prior to last Thursday
night's opening performr.nce.
The same company will also
perform in Behan's The
Hostage on July 25-29 and
Goldoni's Servant of Two
Masters on August 2-4, and
8-11. The "Rehearsal will be
presented this Wednesday through
Saturday night beginning at 8
p.m.

REUNION IN SlGHT?—Stephen Stills (pictured above) who recently
recorded a new album with Manassas, may be contemplating the
reinstatement of his former successful partnership with Graham Nash,
Neil Young, and David Crosby. Although "Rolling Stone" hints that
the talented quartet is considering a reunion, no details of the merger
are available.
The Rehearsal by Jean Anouilh
