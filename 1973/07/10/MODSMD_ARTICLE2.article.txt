# Escondido Director Gallagher May Be Ousted From Position
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Escondido Village Director Frank E.
Gallagher Jr. may be leaving the job he
has held since 1960, the Daily has
learned. Reports indicate he may be
forced out.
Edward Scoles, director of Housing
Management and Gallagher's superior,
denied yesterday that Gallagher has
resigned, been fired, or been asked for
his resignation.
However, when asked if such action
was forthcoming, Scoles responded, "I
don't care to comment any further on
that matter."
Scoles said only "We have been
looking at Escondido operations and
finances for some time."
Gallagher commented only that he
stood by Scoles' responses. He too
declined comment on whether he was
leaving.
'Can't Relate'
The Daily's original source told a
reporter that Gallagher "was being
fired" for "not relating to the kids."
Some residents have confirmed that
many considered Gallagher
intransigent and uncooperative.
However, the source — who
identified himself as a former
Escondido resident — defended
Gallagher as "an outstanding man"
who made Escondido "one of the
best-run departments in the
University."
One current resident said yesterday
that both Gallagher's personal manner
and his "financial inexperience"
contributed to Escondido problems.
The resident said Gallagher, a
former Palo Alto city councilman and
Marine Corps colonel, "has a habit of
simply announcing things rather than

talking to anybody about it."
Community Center
As an example, he cited an incident
involving the recently-opened
Escondido Community Center.
Without any consultation, the resident
alleged, Gallagher declared he would
be responsible for granting permission
to use the facility.
The resident said Gallagher was
circumvented when residents asked the
"far more reasonable people" in the
Dean of Student Affairs office to
assume control of the facility.
"In itself, that one incident isn't so
much," said the resident. "But it's so
typical of the way he [Gallagher] does
things."
Rising Rents
The resident also blamed Gallagher's
financial management for the
steadily-rising rents in the apartment
complex. The Board of Trustees is
currently examining a six-point plan
submitted by the Escondido Village
Council that would substantially alter
Gallagher's proposed budget.
University Vice President for
Business and Finance Robert
Augsburger said he "really can't
comment" on the report that
Gallagher is leaving, noting that any
move to dismiss him "is Ed Scoles'
decision."
Augsburger said that there is
currently "a general review" of
Escondido operations underway,
which is exploring "all kinds of
management alternatives." He
conceded that Escondido is "an area
where we have run into some
problems" in insuring that it is not
only just a place to live, but "a good
place to live."

Besides Augsburger's review, Susan
Swaringen, a counselor/coordinator
fo« the Dean of Student Affairs office,
is also conducting a review of student
services in Escondido. Her report is
expected shortly.
Suzi Tilson, president of the
Escondido Village Council, refused to
comment on any aspect of the story
yesterday.
"I wish I could be more helpful, but
I have absolutely no comment," she
said.
