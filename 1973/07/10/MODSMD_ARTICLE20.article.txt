# Fine Acting Enlivens 'Oliver!'
## Ron Moody Recreates Fagin 
### DAN FORTE 
SAN FRANCISCOâ€”Generally
speaking, I don't care for
musicals, on stage or screen. One
exception is Oliver!
Tuesday, July 3, Oliver! began
a seven-week run at the Curran
Theater. This production,
produced by Glenn Jordan and
directed by Jack Donohue, stars
Ron Moody as Fagin.
When Lionel Bart took Charles
Dickens' Oliver Twist and made it
into a musical in 1960, one of the
major changes he made, besides
the addition of singing and
dancing, was in the role of Fagin.
While Dickens' Fagin was a mean,
sarcastic thief, Bart's Fagin was
light and humorous.
It was Ron Moody who
originally created the musical
Fagin, and although he left the
production after only one year,
his portrayal is still considered the
definitive Fagin.
Rougish Fagin
When Oliver! became a movie

in 1968, Moody recreated his role
once again. He received an
Academy Award nomination,
among numerous other awards.
The current production marks
Moody's first American stage
appearance.
After Moody left the original
London production, Oliver!
continued to become London's
longest-running musical, with a
total of 2,618 performances.
The opening night performance
at the Curran Theater gave ample
evidence of why Oliver! has
enjoyed such universal popularity.
Former Monkee
Also recreating his role from
the London production was David
Jones, formerly of The Monkees,
as the Artful Dodger, Jones and,
of course, Moody were .the hits of
the show. Their duet on
"Reviewing The Situation" was a
study in professionalism.
The songs in Oliver! fit the
context of the story well, and also
made for some fine individual
performances, especially
"Consider Yourself" (sung by the
Artful Dodger), "You've Got to
Pick A Pocket or Two" (sung by
Fagin), "I'd Do Anything" and
"Who Will Buy?"
Other actors deserving mention
are Dale Malone as Mr. Bumble,

Helena Carroll as Widow Comey,
Jon Cypher as Bill Sikes, and
Karen Morrow, an admirable
singer, as Nancy.
Talented Canine
Even Bullseye, Bill Sikes' dog,
not only ran on and off stage on
cue, but even made the correct
turns and snapped at Fagin once
right on cue!
The only performances which
weren't up to the quality of the
rest were Hedley Mattingly as Mr.
Brownlow, and, most noticeably,
Colin Duffy in the role of Oliver
Twist. Both suffered from
extreme cases of over-acting.
The settings at the Curran
Theater were very elaborate and
beautiful, as were the costumes,
especially the Artful Dodger's and
Fagin's.
Enthusiastic Ovation
Not enough can be said on
behalf of Ron Moody. After
receiving a huge ovation during
the final curtain call, Moody
climbed into the audience, and
passed his hat through the front
row.
The Curran Theater itself is
quite ornate and beautiful. Oliver!
will be there through August 21; I
would .recommend it for anyone
and everyone.
