Peace Corpsmen Arrive In Zaire
KINSHASA, ZAIRE — The 111 American Peace
Corps volunteers detained at Uganda since Saturday
have safely arrived here at the group's original
destination.
The volunteers were detained for two days after
Idi Amin, Uganda's president, ordered the pilot of
their plane to return to Uganda after a refueling
stop there.
Amin explained that he thought the group might
be mercenary troops headed for the civil war in
nearby Rwanda.
However, Amin released the group after the
president of Zaire [formerly the Congo] sent Amin
a telegram explaining he had invited the Americans
to his country for training.
One of the volunteers, Nancy Spoor of Hamden,
Conn., told newsmen that the volunteers are tired
but were treated well by the Ugandans.
In Washington, the State Department said it
asked the Ugandan government for a full
explanation of its actions.

announced his resignation as the head of the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC).

was resigning because of a lack of financial support,

the civil rights organization he has headed since the
1967 assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King.

walked to King's grave, in tears, to pray.
Mitchell Attorneys File Charges
NEW YORK — Lawyers representing former Atty.
Gen. John Mitchell filed motions yesterday trying
to have conspiracy and perjury indictments against
him dropped.
Mitchell, along with three other persons, was

indicted in May for conspiracy in a scheme to
influence a government investigation of Nixon
campaign contributor Robert Vesco. Trial date is set
for September.
The motion made here while Mitchell was
testifying before the Senate Watergate Committee,
charges the government with misconduct in the
case.
It says Mitchell was asked improper questions
relating to the Watergate affair during the grand jury
session which produced the indictments, and thus
prejudiced the indictments.
Gas Rationing Rumors Denied
WASHINGTON — The Nixon administration
yesterday denied it is considering rationing gasoline.
Asked about rumors of imminent rationing,
Deputy Treasury Secretary William Simon replied,
"Absolutely not." He added his opinion that the
administration's voluntary allocation program is
working.
However, Sen. Henry Jackson (D-Wash.)
disagrees, and wants Congress to investigate
breaking up the largest oil companies to end the
shortage.
Jackson says a Federal Trade Commission report
he has received charges "a lessening of competition"
between these companies, and argues that this is the
real cause of the shortage. He has asked the FTC to
further investigate the matter.
The report, according to Jackson, makes a
"strong case" for separating oil production, refining,
and transportation.
In a related matter, the state of Florida today
filed suit against 15 major oil companies, charging
they conspired to bring about a "gasoline shortage."
The suit charges that the oil companies did so in
order to force independent companies out of
business while keeping their own prices high.

who met last night to protest Uruguay's new
rule-by-decree government.
The uprising comes in the wake of Pres. Juan

Bordaberry closed parliament last month after it
refused to impeach a senator the military wanted
arrested for maintaining contact with
anti-government guerrillas.

have safely arrived here at the group's original

be mercenary troops headed for the civil war in
nearby Rwanda.

a telegram explaining he had invited the Americans
to his country for training.

Mitchell Attorneys File Charges
NEW YORK — Lawyers representing former Atty.
Gen. John Mitchell filed motions yesterday trying
to have conspiracy and perjury indictments against
him dropped.
Mitchell, along with three other persons, was

indicted in May for conspiracy in a scheme to
influence a government investigation of Nixon
campaign contributor Robert Vesco. Trial date is set
for September.
The motion made here while Mitchell was
testifying before the Senate Watergate Committee,
charges the government with misconduct in the
case.
It says Mitchell was asked improper questions
relating to the Watergate affair during the grand jury
session which produced the indictments, and thus
prejudiced the indictments.
Gas Rationing Rumors Denied
WASHINGTON — The Nixon administration
yesterday denied it is considering rationing gasoline.
Asked about rumors of imminent rationing,
Deputy Treasury Secretary William Simon replied,
"Absolutely not." He added his opinion that the
administration's voluntary allocation program is
working.
However, Sen. Henry Jackson (D-Wash.)
disagrees, and wants Congress to investigate
breaking up the largest oil companies to end the
shortage.
Jackson says a Federal Trade Commission report
he has received charges "a lessening of competition"
between these companies, and argues that this is the
real cause of the shortage. He has asked the FTC to
further investigate the matter.
The report, according to Jackson, makes a
"strong case" for separating oil production, refining,
and transportation.
In a related matter, the state of Florida today
filed suit against 15 major oil companies, charging
they conspired to bring about a "gasoline shortage."
The suit charges that the oil companies did so in
order to force independent companies out of
business while keeping their own prices high.

Corps volunteers detained at Uganda since Saturday
have safely arrived here at the group's original
destination.
The volunteers were detained for two days after
Idi Amin, Uganda's president, ordered the pilot of
their plane to return to Uganda after a refueling
stop there.

be mercenary troops headed for the civil war in
nearby Rwanda.
However, Amin released the group after the
president of Zaire [formerly the Congo] sent Amin
a telegram explaining he had invited the Americans
to his country for training.
One of the volunteers, Nancy Spoor of Hamden,

Mitchell Attorneys File Charges
NEW YORK — Lawyers representing former Atty.
Gen. John Mitchell filed motions yesterday trying
to have conspiracy and perjury indictments against
him dropped.
Mitchell, along with three other persons, was

indicted in May for conspiracy in a scheme to
influence a government investigation of Nixon
campaign contributor Robert Vesco. Trial date is set
for September.
The motion made here while Mitchell was
testifying before the Senate Watergate Committee,
charges the government with misconduct in the
case.
It says Mitchell was asked improper questions
relating to the Watergate affair during the grand jury
session which produced the indictments, and thus
prejudiced the indictments.
Gas Rationing Rumors Denied
WASHINGTON — The Nixon administration
yesterday denied it is considering rationing gasoline.
Asked about rumors of imminent rationing,
Deputy Treasury Secretary William Simon replied,
"Absolutely not." He added his opinion that the
administration's voluntary allocation program is
working.
However, Sen. Henry Jackson (D-Wash.)
disagrees, and wants Congress to investigate
breaking up the largest oil companies to end the
shortage.
Jackson says a Federal Trade Commission report
he has received charges "a lessening of competition"
between these companies, and argues that this is the
real cause of the shortage. He has asked the FTC to
further investigate the matter.
The report, according to Jackson, makes a
"strong case" for separating oil production, refining,
and transportation.
In a related matter, the state of Florida today
filed suit against 15 major oil companies, charging
they conspired to bring about a "gasoline shortage."
The suit charges that the oil companies did so in
order to force independent companies out of
business while keeping their own prices high.
