# Legal Office Approved
## 
### 
The ASSU Senate voted last night to
approve an interim proposal which would
establish a Legal Counseling Office (LCO) on
campus in the fall.
The proposal sets up an office for the sole
use of students here, to advise them on legal
matters. The LCO would maintain an attorney
who would be charged with advising students
and representing those who actually need legal
representation and cannot afford private
counsel.
The office would further be charged with
educating the Stanford community on legal
matters through seminars, pamphlets, and
possibly a newspaper column.
The LCO would be funded by a refundable
one-dollar fee assessment which was approved
by the student body last spring. However, the
office services would not be provided to those
that request a refund.
