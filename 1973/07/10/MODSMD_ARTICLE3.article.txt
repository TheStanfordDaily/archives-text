# New Ombudsman For Summer Quarter
## Ombudsman Battles Bureaucracy 
### DEBBIE SEAMAN 
According to the dictionary, an
ombudsman is an official appointed to
investigate citizens' complaints against
local or national government agencies
that may be infringing on the rights of
individuals.
Here on campus, the Ombudsman is
the person to whom students, faculty
and staff can take their problems. He,
in turn, brings these problems to the
attention of higher-level University
administrators who ordinarily might
be difficult to reach.
Jack Black, director of research in
the Dean of Student Affairs office, has
replaced Harvey Hall as University
Ombudsman for the summer. He feels
that all bureaucracies, however large or
small, can be intractable at times and
that one of the main functions of the
Ombudsman's office is to try to make
the bureaucracy a little less
bureaucratic.
Black has not previously had any
direct dealing; with the ombudsman's

office except, he says, recommending
many years ago that the University
establish such an office. "Of course
I've watched it with some interest, but
from the outside."
A 'Quiet Advocate'
Black sees himself in this job as a
"quiet advocate of the small man, the
little man's problem or point of view."
"Most of the complaints involve a
perceived inequity in the application
of some rule or regulation. Sometimes
it's because the rule is wrong, or
sometimes it's because the person
administering it is being a little
arbitrary, and sometimes it's because
the rule just doesn't adapt itself to the
unique situation."
He feels that, as well as responding
to complaints brought to him, the
Ombudsman should try to anticipate
areas in which the administration
might modify itself in order to be
more effective. He should, Black
believes, take the initiative to
encourage changing rules rather than

just stretching them in individual
cases.
However, Black also feels that he
cannot be "out on a soap box" all the
time and above all must keep the
confidence of both students and
administrators.
Black's Ultimate Weapon
He says that his ultimate weapon is
exposure of incompetence but that
this is a weapon to be used sparingly.
"If you're always engaged in heated
confrontations with administrators,
you're not going to get a terribly
receptive response the next time you
get into one."
The summer session, in Black's
opinion, is a pleasant interlude of the
year, with less frantic rushing around
by the students and less pressure from
the faculty. He says that this relaxed
atmosphere makes his job much easier.
Black has been a psychologist here
since 1950. He established a
psychological counseling and testing
