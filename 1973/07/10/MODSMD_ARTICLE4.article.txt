# Mitchell Testimony Begins Today; 'Won't Implicate The President'
## 
### KEVIN SMITH Special to the Daily 
WASHINGTON — According to
sources close to the Senate Watergate
Committee, former U.S. Atty. Gen.
John Mitchell will continue to deny
any wrongdoing connected with the
Watergate break-in as he begins
testimony before that committee
today.
Mitchell met with the committee
staff yesterday to give them a preview
of his testimony. He will reportedly

state that President Nixon had no
involvement in either the break-in or
the cover-up.
In contrast to the 245-page opening
statement read by former White House
counsel John W. Dean 111 when he
testified two weeks ago, Mitchell is not
expected to have any preliminary
statement and will submit to questions
from the committee immediately.
Magruder Blamed
According to reports, Mitchell plans
to finger Jeb Stuart Magruder, former
deputy director for the Committee to
Re-elect the President, as the
mastermind behind the Watergate
break-in.
Magruder has been the only witness
so far to claim that Mitchell had prior
knowledge of Watergate.
In testimony given in early June,
Magruder said a massive espionage plan
was originally proposed in early 1972
by convicted Watergate conspirator G.
Gordon Liddy.
Mitchell Accused
Although Magruder testified that
Liddy's plan met with initial rejection,
he said a scaled-down version of the
plan was finally approved by Mitchell,
Magruder, and Frederick C. Laßue,
another former Nixon campaign
official, who last week pleaded guilty
to one count of obstruction of justice
in return for a light sentence.

No one seems to know yet whether
Mitchell's loquacious wife Martha will
appear with him at the hearings room.
If Mrs. Mitchell accompanies him
today, she may well draw a larger
flock of reporters than her husband.
She has repeatedly called for
Nixon's resignation over the last
month, saying he knew completely
about the Watergate cover-up.
Sen. Lowell P. Weicker (R-Conn.), a
member of the Senate committee, said
in a speech today that the next witness
to appear before the committee would
probably be Herbert W. Kalmbach,
Nixon's former personal lawyer at the
White House.
Weicker felt the committee could
then call lower-ranking witnesses such
as former White House counsel Charles
W. Colson and former White House
aide Gordon Strachan before getting
to former Presidential advisers H.R.
Haldeman and John D. Ehrlichman,
who were heavily implicated by Dean's
testimony.
Another list of White House
"enemies" was revealed yesterday by
columnist Jack Anderson, consisting
of a dozen Republican senators who
were to be harassed in various ways as
punishment for occasional deviation
from White House wishes.
The list, allegedly compiled by
Haldeman, included Weicker, Sen.

Mark O. Hatfield (R-Ore.), Sen.
Clifford P. Case (R-N.J.), Sen. Richard
S. Schweiker (R-Penn.) and Sen.
William B. Saxbe (R-Ohio) among
others.
'House Of 111-Repute'
Saxbe, when asked about
Nixon's involvement in Watergate,
replied, "It's like a man who plays a
piano in a house of ill-repute for 20
years and claims he doesn't know
what's going on upstairs."
There's been growing pressure on
Capitol Hill for Nixon to issue some
kind of statement to the public on the
charges made against him by Dean.
After Nixon told the Senate
committee he would not under any
circumstances appear before the
committee or supply them with
requested documents, Committee
Chairman Sam J. Ervin (D-N.C.)
replied that Nixon would simply have
to "face the consequences" of not
telling his side of the story.
Weicker, in a speech, attributed
Nixon's drop in the polls to the feeling
"that he is not performing now — at
this moment in time — as the President
of the United States should."
Weicker added that in his view,
Dean's testimony has a great deal of
credibility. "I think his testimony held
up very well under cross-exami na
tion," he said.
