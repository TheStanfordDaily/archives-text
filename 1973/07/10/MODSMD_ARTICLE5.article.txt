# Campus Shell Cuts Operations
## Energy Crisis Ends Self-Service Gas 
### GLENN ZORN 
The Campus Shell station hasn't escaped the
effects of the current gasoline shortage, according to
manager Gary Andrews.
The energy crisis has forced a cut in the station's
operating hours, Andrews claims, and to increase
profits he has abolished self-service at the station.
Previously, Campus Shell operated from 7 a.m. to
midnight, seven days a week. Now it is open from 7
a.m. to 7 p.m., only six days a week.
Originally, Andrews instituted self-service to
attract more customers, offering the customer two
cents off the price of each gallon for pumping his
own gas. The two cents goes to the attendant under
the full-service plan.
Customers Still Coming
Campus Shell customers don't appear to miss the
self-service enough to stay away from it. They are
still coming into the station in large numbers, says
Andrews. However, some patrons say they miss the
extra savings of self-service.
Andrews says it is highly unlikely that oil
companies are in collusion to raise gasoline prices or

to put the Alaskan pipeline through because the
legal penalties and the financial loss are prohibitive.
Oil companies are losing a large portion of their
profit based on rents during the gas shortage,
Andrews says. Each station manager pays his rent
based on the amount of gasoline he purchases.
Andrews comments that his rent is down one-third
since the shortage began.
Discussion Declined
Andrews says that the oil companies refuse to
discuss gas independent stations because
they are afraid of being accused of collusion and
price fixing.
Since the gas shortage began, oil companies have
been telling station managers how to sell less gas.
They have suggested rationing gas and closing early
as possible methods to decrease sales.
Andrews attributes the gasoline shortage to smog
devices on the newer cars which require more
gasoline; more cars on the road; the shortage of
natural gas — which became acute last winter,
forcing oil refineries to produce more fuel oil
instead of producing gasoline; the United State's

lack of enough large refineries to produce the
needed gasoline, and increased travel during the
summer.
Government Regulations
At present, Shell Oil Company allocates gas based
on 1972 purchases of the corresponding month.
However, it is difficult, Andrews says, to predict the
gas situation in the coming months, depending on
government regulations and Shell's gas supply.
One governmental regulation affecting Campus
Shell is President Nixon's price freeze. Under this
program stations cannot raise their prices until after
Aug. 15.
The price of regular gasoline is now 40.9 cents
per gallon, not including the recent 4/10 of a cent
State sales tax increase.
If the shortage gets bad enough, Andrews sees
only two alternatives: to sell his gasoline until he
reaches his maximum, then close, or to ration the
gas to each customer.
Andrews favors closing early, because he will
avoid confrontations with each customer explaining
the rationing.

DON'T HELP YOURSELF — The Campus Shell station has been forced to make a few changes in response to the current
energy crisis. Self-service at the station has become a thing of the past, according to manager Gary Andrews. The two
cents saved by customers in the past now pay an attendant's salary. The station's regular gas is currently priced at 40.9

cents per gallon.
The Campus Shell station hasn't escaped the
effects of the current gasoline shortage, according to
manager Gary Andrews.
The energy crisis has forced a cut in the station's
operating hours, Andrews claims, and to increase
profits he has abolished self-service at the station.
Previously, Campus Shell operated from 7 a.m. to
midnight, seven days a week. Now it is open from 7
a.m. to 7 p.m., only six days a week.
Originally, Andrews instituted self-service to
attract more customers, offering the customer two
cents off the price of each gallon for pumping his
own gas. The two cents goes to the attendant under
the full-service plan.
Customers Still Coming
Campus Shell customers don't appear to miss the
self-service enough to stay away from it. They are
still coming into the station in large numbers, says
Andrews. However, some patrons say they miss the
extra savings of self-service.
Andrews says it is highly unlikely that oil
companies are in collusion to raise gasoline prices or

to put the Alaskan pipeline through because the
legal penalties and the financial loss are prohibitive.
Oil companies are losing a large portion of their
profit based on rents during the gas shortage,
Andrews says. Each station manager pays his rent
based on the amount of gasoline he purchases.
Andrews comments that his rent is down one-third
since the shortage began.
Discussion Declined
Andrews says that the oil companies refuse to
discuss gas independent stations because
they are afraid of being accused of collusion and
price fixing.
Since the gas shortage began, oil companies have
been telling station managers how to sell less gas.
They have suggested rationing gas and closing early
as possible methods to decrease sales.
Andrews attributes the gasoline shortage to smog
devices on the newer cars which require more
gasoline; more cars on the road; the shortage of
natural gas — which became acute last winter,
forcing oil refineries to produce more fuel oil
instead of producing gasoline; the United State's

lack of enough large refineries to produce the
needed gasoline, and increased travel during the
summer.
Government Regulations
At present, Shell Oil Company allocates gas based
on 1972 purchases of the corresponding month.
However, it is difficult, Andrews says, to predict the
gas situation in the coming months, depending on
government regulations and Shell's gas supply.
One governmental regulation affecting Campus
Shell is President Nixon's price freeze. Under this
program stations cannot raise their prices until after
Aug. 15.
The price of regular gasoline is now 40.9 cents
per gallon, not including the recent 4/10 of a cent
State sales tax increase.
If the shortage gets bad enough, Andrews sees
only two alternatives: to sell his gasoline until he
reaches his maximum, then close, or to ration the
gas to each customer.
Andrews favors closing early, because he will
avoid confrontations with each customer explaining
the rationing.

DON'T HELP YOURSELF — The Campus Shell station has been forced to make a few changes in response to the current
energy crisis. Self-service at the station has become a thing of the past, according to manager Gary Andrews. The two
cents saved by customers in the past now pay an attendant's salary. The station's regular gas is currently priced at 40.9
cents per gallon.
