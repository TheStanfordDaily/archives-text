## Nixon Must Testify 
### 
Former White House counsel John Dean recently told Senate
investigators and millions of Americans who viewed his sworn
testimony via national television that the President knew about the
Watergate incident and subsequent coverup.
This week, the Ervin committee continues to probe the morass of
political intrigue collectively known as "Watergate" by questioning
former attorney general and former Nixon re-election committee
chairman John Mitchell.
We commend the Ervin committee for its unrelenting efforts to
ascertain the degree of Nixon's involvement in the Watergate affair
through questioning administrators and former administrators close to
the chief executive. But we believe that the testimony of the President
himself should be a part of the probe.
Nixon should journey to Capitol Hill as soon as possible to testify
voluntarily under oath before the Ervin committee. And his sworn
statements should be a matter of public fecord through television
coverage or accessible transcripts of presidential testimony. In this
public forum, Nixon should undergo incisive cross-examination.
If, in fact, Nixon did not figure in the Watergate conspiracy, his
testimony could do nothing but clear him of further accusations. But
he has adamantly refused to testify during the current stage of the
investigations, and has evasively indicated that he will speak only in
what he deems an "appropriate forum."
Nixon's refusal to testify lias damaged his credibility both
nationally and internationally. When polls reveal that 71 percent of all
Americans wouldn't buy a used car from the president and that 18
percent of the people favor his impeachment, the government has
reached a sorry state.
Our demand for sworn presidential testimony regarding his
involvement in Watergate does not stem from a desire to put the
president on trial. He must testify because the Watergate mess must be
swept out from under the American political rug.
Perhaps it is unfair to dangle the Damocles sword of impeachment
over Richard Nixon's head. Yet if the President persists in his refusal
to speak out candidly on Watergate, impeachment proceedings may
become the only method of extracting that vital testimony.
