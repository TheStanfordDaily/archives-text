# Cause Of West African Poverty
## Marketing Boardsâ€”The Real Imperialists

First of Two Parts
Imperialism is one of the most widely
discussed topics of this century. In its
modern form, the term owes its currency
to Lenin. Today it is one of the most
popular words used by Western academics
and intellectuals.
The term is emotive and refers to the
iniquity of the economically advanced
countries of the West, who allegedly owe
their prosperity to the exploitation of
underdeveloped countries.
The idea that the West is responsible for
the poverty of the "third world" is now
widespread both in academic circles and
the literature on economic development.
It is a premise of international
organizations such as the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development
(UNCTAD). Recently Gunnar Myrdal, the
most well known writer on economic
development, has written a one million
word political pamphlet elaborating on this
theme.
After decades of this propaganda, today
it is taken for granted by many that any
Western company that has investments in
an underdeveloped country is an
imperialist. Even free trade between
Western and "third world" countries is said
to be a form of imperialism.
Real Imperialists
The voluminous writings about
imperialism are a mask behind which hide
the real imperialists. To unmask the real
imperialists does not require one million

words. I propose to do it here.
In some nations of West Africa there are
state export monopolies, or marketing
boards as they are officially described, that
extend their control over practically all
agricultural products.
These boards were set up ostensibly to
stabilize the prices received by private
farmers. African farmers, if they wish to
sell their crops, must sell to the state
marketing boards at prices set by the
boards. The boards in turn sell the crops on
the world market.
The original idea was that during the
years of high world market prices, the
boards would hold back part of the
proceeds from the producers in order to
provide a reserve for years when world
market prices were low. In this way
incomes were to be stabilized.
Assurances Not Followed
When these state monopolies were
introduced, categorical formal official
assurances were given that the marketing
boards would serve as trustees and agents
for the private producers and that no
money would be withheld overall from the
farmers.
In the words of the supporters of the
marketing monopolies: "There will be no
question of the boards making a profit at
the expense of West African producers. On
the average of a period of years, the
average price paid to the producers will be
equal to the average net price realized on
world markets, and the boards' buying and

selling transactions will, therefore,
approximately balance."
By 1972 between one-third and one-half
of the commercial values of their crops
were withheld by the state marketing
monopolies from the producers in Nigeria
and Gold Coast-Ghana. The total sum
withheld exceeded two billion dollars!
The political changes and upheavals in
Nigeria and Ghana in the 1960s stopped
the publication of consistent statistical
information on the operations of the
marketing boards, but the evidence
indicates that the state marketing
monopolies continue to be the instrument
of exploitation of those whom they were
ostensibly set up to help.
What was supposed to be state help to
private producers has resulted in prolonged
large-scale confiscation of their incomes.
Government Gets Money
What has become of this huge sum
stolen from the poorest elements of the
populations by their own governments?
Some of it was lost in currency
devaluations, but much of it was
transferred to cover current operating
expenses of the governments.
In effect a productive sector of the
population, whose money incomes are
minuscule, has been kept poor by being
taxed at rates equivalent to those levied on
American annual incomes of $50,000 to
$140,000!
The consumption and investment of
West African farmers have been throttled

in order that civil servants and government
officials can enjoy relatively high incomes.
This makes it clear why West African
governments are such vociferous consumers
of the anti-Western imperialist diatribes
that originate in the West.
Anti-Western Westerners
The charge of imperialism was once a
main weapon of Marxist-Leninists. But the
use of this charge has been usurped by the
West's own anti-Western intellectuals. It
fits the purposes of advocates of world
government and income redistribution
between countries, and serves as a mask for
the exploitation of Western taxpayers who
are told they must assuage through foreign
aid the alleged imperialist guilt.
As Professor Peter Bauer of the London
School of Economics has written in his
monumental book Dissent on
Development: "There are many people in
the West who for various reasons have
come so to dislike major institutions of
Western society, especially the market
economy and its corollaries such as private
property, that they regard the radical
weakening of these institutions as a major
objective of policy.
Many of these people, influential in the
universities, the mass media and the
international organizations, consider the
underdeveloped countries as allies, or
rather as instruments, in the promotion of
their aims."
