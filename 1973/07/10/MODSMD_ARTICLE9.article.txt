Foreign Students' Jobs
Editor:
We feel it is necessary to
qualify any misunderstandings
about the roles of the Career
Planning and Placement Center
and the International Center that
may have arisen from Mr.
Chopra's article on the
employment situation for foreign
students. The article was
apparently compiled through
casual conversations sometime
ago, and not through formal
interviews. Those statements
directly attributed to us would
seem to be the result of inaccurate
understanding on the part of Mr.
Chopra.
Both centers are aware of and
sensitive to the problems and
frustrations that foreign students
have in finding work. The

Iâ€”Center provides counseling
about visa information, and
placement efforts are the concern
of the CPPC.
Efforts are continually being
made to identify jobs that don't
have visa restrictions, but it is
difficult with the current "tight"
U.S. job market. Companies in the
technical fields sometimes are
under U.S. Government contract
restrictions, and companies are
often hesitant about hiring
someone who will not be with
them long enough to make the
investment for training
worthwhile.
This is especially true for
summer work, which is difficult
to find for American as well as
foreign students. Nevertheless, if a
student needs part-time or
summer work for financial reasons
while studying, jobs are available;
but the student should be flexible
and be open to options outside
any one specific field.
Undeniably, a job opportunity
constitutes a valuable experience
for the student before he returns
to his home country, but he was
not initially admitted to the
United States for this purpose.
Since student-visa holders are
by law not permitted to work
unless special permission has been
granted, either by the university
in the case of a campus job or by
the Immigration Service in the
case of part-time employment or
practical training following
completion of studies, no one
interested in study in the United
States should plan his financial
support for such studies on
projected earnings once in the
United States, unless such
earnings are in connection with an
assistantship granted by his
department as part of university
financial aid.

Editor:
In 1973 we celebrate the
twenty-fifth anniversary of the
U.N. Declaration of Human
Rights. Article 5 of that
Declaration states that "No one
shall be subjected to torture or to
cruel, inhuman or degrading
treatment or punishment."
Sadly there is little to
celebrate. Article 5 has been
ignored by dozens of nations. In
some of these countries, torture
has become established state
policy, usually with the aims of

facilitating interrogation and the
intimidation of political
dissidents. Now more than ever, as
the 'contagion' spreads, we need
to pressure nations to respect
their Declaration of Human
Rights, and specifically to honor
the torture clause.
Amnesty International with
30,000 members throughout the
world, has as its principal
objective the international respect
of human rights. Our task is to
pester Governments continuously,
and work for the release of human
beings imprisoned only because
they have practiced their
fundamental rights.
During the anniversary year,
we are conducting a campaign to
abolish torture. As a first step, we
are collecting one million or more
signatures in the thirty-two
countries where Amnesty
International is active, for a
petition to be submitted to the
U.N. General Assembly calling for
the immediate out-lawing of
torture. The U.N. has the means
of converting the Declaration into
a legally binding Convention
which would require its
signatories to abide by its articles.
Amnesty International aims for a
Convention on torture.
Your signature would help of
course. Please write to us:
Amnesty International, Room
205, ASSU, Tresidder Union,
Stanford University, Stanford. Or
phone 327-0129. We would be
delighted to arrange your signing
of the petition, and provide you
with more information about our
work.

I should like to correct an
impression left by the report of
the W. Ron Jones grievance
hearing that appeared in The
Stanford Daily on Tuesday, July
3.
In response to a question
concerning the independence of
SCIRE I testified that no faculty
body (department of program)
offering a curriculum is
independent of the jurisdiction of
Academic Council committees. I
went on to explain that the
faculty has the responsibility for
the approval of courses of study
and the accreditation of
instruction.
The Senate of the Academic
Council establishes the policy in
these areas on the basis of
recommendations from its various
committees. In particular it was
quite clear in the Senate
resolution establishing the three
special agencies, SCIRE, SWOPSI,
and Urban Studies, that they are
subject to the jurisdiction of the
Senate through its two
committees, the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies and the
Committee on Academic
Appraisal and Achievement.
I essentially stated the policy
set forth by the Senate in its
resolution which established
SCIRE, SWOPSI, and Urban
Studies as decanal agencies.
I went on to say that based on
policy established by the faculty,
persons offering formal
instruction at the University are
subject to the usual appointment
procedures.
