# CUS Report Defends SWOPSI's Rejection Of Shockley's Course
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
An investigative subcommittee of
the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS) has defended the
rejection of a course on genetics and
intelligence proposed by Electrical
Engineering Prof. William B. Shockley.
The subcommittee, established at
the request of President Richard W.
Lyman, found that the policy board of
the Stanford Workshops on Political
and Social Issues (SWOPSI) based its
turndown of the class on "reasoned

and serious" grounds.
Shockley, a Nobel Prize-winner in
physics who has theorized that blacks
are genetically inferior to whites on
the basis of intelligence, first proposed
the course over a year and a half ago.
He received notice of the turndown in
July, 1972.
In the letter of rejection, signed by
SWOPSI Director Dan A. Lewis, the
board cited several questions which
were raised during discussions on the
proposal, including:
— whether the class would
contribute more to the problem in
question than to its solution;
— how competent Shockley was to
lead the class;
— whether the course was too
difficult for undergraduates;
— and whether the course might be
subject to classroom disruptions.
Investigation Requested
Last August, Lyman said he found
some of the reasons cited "deeply
troubling," and asked CUS to
investigate.
Specifically, he asked if Shockley's
proposal was judged by the same
criteria applied to all other SWOPSI
classes, whether the criteria were
applied consistently, and whether the
criteria were "consistent with the
requirements of academic freedom."
The CUS subcommittee concluded
that SWOPSI's most serious error was
not in turning down the course, but in
the letter sent to Shockley explaining
the refusal.
The letter was "damagingly
misleading" in that it did not offer
Shockley the reasons for the rejection,
but rather "some commentary on
matters discussed by the Board," the
subcommittee report said.
Many of the matters discussed, the

report implied, were not the actual
grounds for rejecting the proposal.
The subcommittee report noted
that "every member of the Policy
Board entertained some doubts" as to
Shockley's competence to lead the
workshop.
"Yet in the case of four members
of the board, civil liberties
considerations prevailed and they
voted in favor of the proposal."
(The proposal actually received
more yes than no votes, passing 4-3
with two abstentions. However, under
SWOPSI rules, a course needs a
two-thirds majority for approval.)
Decision Consistent
The subcommittee, chaired by
Political Science Prof. Hubert
Marshall, further found that the
SWOPSI decision was consistent with
academic freedom and "as an
approximation" applied its criteria

consistently.
In Summit, N.J., where he is
working on a book at Bell Telephone
Laboratories, Shockley told the Daily
that "I certainly do not consider it a
dead issue."
But, he said, "I'm not sure what
routes are open to me ... I am not
certain what to do about this."
Shockley said he might resubmit his
SWOPSI proposal with an added
provision to allow up to one-fourth of
the class time for an authority on
genetics to refute his views.
He would be "quite willing to
consider" such a plan, he said.
Shockley repeated his previous
charges that the failure to fully
explore his theories on heredity and
genetics is "the most serious and
obvious dereliction in the history of
scien"° "

REJECTED — Electrical Engineering Prof. William B. Shockley's proposed
SWOPSI course on the heredity of intelligence was turned down by the SWOPSI
Policy Board a year ago. This week, a subcommittee of the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies upheld that rejection.
