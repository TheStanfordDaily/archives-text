# Nixon In Danger Of Impeachment
## White House Blunders Damage President 
### 
-Kevin Smith

WASHINGTON—Richard Nixon is
in a lot of trouble.
This feeling has appeared
strongly in this city in the last
week or so, and not solely due to
former White House Counsel John
Dean's testimony.
In the eyes of this reporter, the
wind really began to shift against
Nixon on the fourth day of
Dean's testimony, when Sen.
Lowell P. Weicker (R—Conn.)
charged that the White House
launched a campaign to discredit
him.
No one can deny that Dean's
allegations that Nixon had
discussed the cover-up with him
find had agreed to executive
clemency and payoffs for the
convicted Watergate burglars were
damaging to the President.
But odds were still good that
Nixon could parry Dean's charges
and produce a stand-off between
him and Dean that the President
would inevitably win.
Balance Tipped
Weicker's statement, while not
in itself decisive, seemed to tip the
balance against Nixon for the first
time.
The plot against Weicker
demonstrated, in an incredibly
dramatic fashion, the way Nixon
and those defending him in the
Watergate case, have, at least until
now, botched the job of
protecting the President.
While attempting to protect
the President, the White House, in
its incredible stupidity, has only
managed to damage the President,
perhaps irreparably.
White House Blunders
Blunders by the White House
include:
—alienating Weicker, which has
cost Nixon valuable support on
the committee. While never one to
back Nixon blindly, Weicker
would have supported the
President unless incontravertable
evidence implicated him.
Now Weicker can be
considered greatly antagonistic
toward the White House, and
Nixon simply cannot afford to
foster that kind of Republican
antagonism to his cause.
—allowing Charles Colson,

officially or unofficially, to be
Nixon's most vocal public
defender. In Colson, the
President's supporters have in
their spokesman one of the least
trusted people in Washington
today.
—the memo released to the
Senate Committee by White
House Special Counsel J. Fred
Buzhardt, which contained
incredible inaccuracies and tied
the President to the line of
praising Haldeman and
Ehrlichman, which he is
increasingly hesitant to do.
The fact that the memo was
immediately disavowed by the
White House only served to show
that Nixon still does not have his
house in order and still does not
keep tabs on what his top aides
are doing.
—the fact that Nixon, by
refusing to appear before the
Watergate Committee or Grand
Jury, is inviting impeachment.
Congress is determined to get to
the bottom (or the top) of the
Watergate case, and if the
President does not give the
information that Congress seeks
voluntarily, Congress might very
well force him to give a defense
by the only means possible:
impeachment.
Indictment May Occur
It must be remembered that
impeachment itself is nothing
more than an indictment of sorts,
and does not mean that the
President would be removed from
office. The House, which does the
impeaching, is far less hesitant
than it was a little while ago to
resort to impeachment if
necessary to get the information it
wants.
A column in the Boston Globe
a week ago claimed that the
House had gone beyond the stage
of talking about impeachment and
had begun to dig into the actual
procedure of impeachment. In
addition, numerous Congressional
offices have assigned
impeachment research projects to
their staffs.
At the same time, Nixon is
rapidly becoming a political
liability to the Republican party.

As Republicans look ahead to the
1974 and 1976 elections, more
and more might feel the need to
divorce themselves from Nixon's
cause in the name of
self-preservation.
If this happens, it will likely
signal Nixon's downfall, for he
needs the Republicans in Congress
at this point far more than they
need him.
Gumey Only Backer
Only one of three Republicans
on the Senate Watergate
Committee, Sen. Edward J.
Gurney (R— Fla.), still finds
himself in Nixon's corner.
Weicker has moved from a
slightly pro-Nixon stance to a
rather hostile one, and Sen.
Howard H. Baker, Jr. (R—Tena),
who began running for the 1976
Presidential nomination the
moment the hearings began, saw
the light immediately and cast
himself as a strong independent
only searching for the truth.
Should impeachment
proceedings ever come before
Congress, it will be fascinating to
see how different Congressmen
and Senators would vote. A major
factor in such proceedings would
be the role or expected role of
Vice President Spiro T. Agnew,
who has handled the whole
Watergate crisis extremely well.
With the prospect of Agnew's
ascension to the Presidency, an
incredibly bizarre scenario could

develop.
Political Aspects
Republican presidential
contenders, such as Baker and
Sen. Charles Percy (R—111.), might
want to see Nixon remain in
office so that Agnew would not
get the jump on them in 1976.
Liberal Republicans might also
support Nixon because they
would be unhappy with Agnew as
President.
Coupled with these two groups
would be the party-line
Democrats who feel that deposing
Nixon would give Agnew and the
Republicans a tremendous
advantage in 1976.
Conservative Republicans, on
the other hand, might come to
vote to get rid of Nixon, if they
consider him a liability, for
precisely the same reason: to give
Agnew a head start for 1976. This
sort of vote would be especially
likely if those such as Gurney
abandon ship.
A Few Moralists
Finally, along with these
conservatives, would appear the
moralists and ideologues of both
parties, such as California's Paul
N. McCloskey Jr. and Ronald
Dellums, who would simply feel
Nixon should be impeached
regardless of the benefit and harm
to either party.
All this, of course, still remains
an academic exercise. The only
incriminating evidence against

Nixon so far has been given by
Dean—a man whose credibility,
though strengthened by his
five-day appearance, is far from
perfect.
Mitchell has come out of
hiding and given support to the
President. But Haldeman and
Ehrlichman follow shortly, and as
syndicated columnists Roland
Evans and Robert Novak
reported, Nixon has them forced
into a corner.
Either he must continue to call
Haldeman and Ehrlichman "loyal
public servants" and sink with
them if they crack, or he must
cast them adrift and face their
probable wrath.
The mood in Washington has
turned against Nixon. He is
walking a very thin line, and the
rumblings on Capitol Hill indicate
that, for Nixon, the worst is yet
to come.
