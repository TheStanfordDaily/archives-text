# Administration's Drug War Floundering
## 
### JIM WASCHER Special to the Daily 
CHICAGO—The recent resignations of four top
administrators in the federal government's newly
consolidated drug war have left the effort floundering.
Each of the four expressed differing reasons for their
departure, but deep-seated jealousy and a touch of
scandal were evident from their statements or from
previous disclosures.
The four are Myles J. Ambrose, special assistant
attorney general for Drug Abuse Law Enforcement;
John E. Ingersoll, director of the Justice Department's
Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs; Dr. Jerome
H. Jaffe, director of the White House's Special Action
Office on Drug Abuse Prevention; and William C.
Sullivan, director of the Justice Department's National
Narcotics Intelligence Center.
Effective July 1, President Nixon consolidated each
of these agencies, except Jaffe's, with the drug
enforcement efforts of the Treasury Department's
Bureau of Customs, forming the Drug Enforcement
Administration within the Justice Department.
Unification
In announcing the formation of the Administration
on March 28, Nixon said Ambrose would supervise the
unification process. Observers believed that Ambrose
would be named as permanent chief of the
Administration.
The Chicago Sun-Times described him as a
"tough-talking advocate of stiff mandatory sentences for
drug traffickers and increasingly Mr. Nixon's favorite
anti-drug spokesman."
However, Ambrose resigned from the government on
June 29. His Justice Department office had supervised
the illegal raids by narcotics agents on two homes in

Jollinsville, 111. in April.
Smuggling
Ambrose has also been embarrassed by a December,
1971 visit as Customs Commissioner to the home of
Texas rancher Richmond Harper, who was later indicted
on charges of smuggling guns into Mexico.
Ingersoll also announced his resignation on June 29,
citing inter-agency rivalry, confusion, and intervention
by key White House aides.
He said he was resigning because then—White House
assistants H.R. Haldeman and John D. Ehrlichman "were
out to get me." Ingersoll revealed that then-Atty. Gen.
Richard G. Kleindienst had told him in February that
"unnamed White House officials did not intend to retain
me after the drug control program was reorganized."
Interested
Ingersoll, who had headed the Bureau of Narcotics
and Dangerous Drugs since its inception in 1968, said he
would have been interested in heading the new Drug
Enforcement Agency.
The former Charlotte, N.C. police chief complained
of frequent phone calls from former White House aide
Egil Krogh Jr. and others: "More than policy setting, it
got into implementation of policy, and how you should
go about doing your job." Haldeman, Ehrlichman and
Krogh have all resigned as a result of the Watergate
scandal.
Ambrose's Drug Abuse Law Enforcement Office
agents were described by Ingersoll as unprofessional in
their conduct. Asked if they bypassed legal safeguards,
he said, "You can look at the record and see that."
Jaffe had joined the federal government as a special
consultant to the President on narcotics and dangerous
drugs in 1971, and was named to head the White House's
Special Action Office in the spring of 1972.

On March 28 of this year, the Los Angeles Times
revealed that Jaffe had said a Nixon antidrug bill could
"subject the administration to criticism for attempting a
dangerous and irresponsible experiment."
The Nixon bill calls for mandatory minimum
sentences of five years for anyone convicted of selling
heroin and of from 10 years to life imprisonment for
major drug traffickers.
Quoting a March 9 memo to Ehrlichman, the Times
said Jaffe believed that "while such a bill's appearance of
toughness may generate an emotionally based favorable
reaction, that reaction is not likely to persist in the face
of analyses which show the bill to be counterproductive
even in strictly law enforcement terms."
Jaffe resigned on June 4, probably under White
House pressure.
FBI Wiretaps
Sullivan resigned from the Justice Department's
National Narcotics Intelligence Center shortly after it
was revealed that he had had custody of the records of
17 FBI wiretaps of newsmen and government officials
while he served as assistant to the director of the FBI.
Among these records was the transcript of a taped
conversation by Pentagon Papers defendant Daniel
Ellsberg on the phone of former national security aide
Morton Halperin. The disclosure of this record was
partially responsible for District Court Judge William
Mathew Byrne Jr. declaring a mistrial in Ellsberg's trial
for espionage and theft of government property.
Hampered by inter-agency rivalry, embarrassed by
scandals, and leaderless for the time being at least, the
Federal government's war against what President Nixon
has called "America's Public Enemy No. 1" is crippled,
perhaps irreparably.
