# McCloskey Blasts Remap Proposal
## 
### 
Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr.
(R—Menlo Park) has labeled the
proposed reapportionment of his
district "a classic gerrymander."
In a statement to the Masters
Commission charged with
reapportioning California's
legislative and congressional
districts, McCloskey strongly
criticized the plan approved by
both the State Senate and
Assembly.
McCloskey based his
opposition to the plan on two
points:
that it splits up too many
municipalities into more than one
district;
—and that it was drawn up
using the seniority system to

determine which congressmen
were given preferential treatment.
McCloskey cited the confusion
created by splitting cities up
among several districts, and asked
that "whenever possible ...
district boundaries should follow
existing geographical, county and
muncipal boundaries."
He called the proposed 17th
district boundaries through Santa
Clara County "bizarre and
irrational."
J. Gordon Knapp, an Atherton
businessman who ran against
McCloskey as a write-in candidate
last year, has submitted his own
reapportionment plan to the
Masters Commission, which calls
for a more compact and regular
17th district.
However, McCloskey's
statement makes no mention of
the Knapp plan.
The Masters Commission was
appointed by the State Supreme
Court after the legislature and
Gov. Reagan were unable to reach
agreement on reapportionment.
Of the state's 43 congressmen
only McCloskey and Rep. Barry
M. Goldwater Jr. (R—Los
Angeles) have not backed the
legislature's plan.
