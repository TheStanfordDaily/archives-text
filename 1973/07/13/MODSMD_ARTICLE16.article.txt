# Commander Cody Invades Palo Alto
## 
### BRADLEY DICKINSON 
Those who thought
fireworks shows were the
highlight of Palo Alto's Fourth of
July celebration certainly weren't
down by the tracks at 11 p.m.
That night, Homer's Warehouse
(which might have been more
aptly named Homer's
Sweathouse), featured the daddy
of country swing bands,
Commander Cody and his Lost
Planet Airmen.
In the two years since "Hot
Rod Lincoln" sped the group out
of the Redwood City Theater and
into the national spotlight, they
have managed to keep their style
unchanged. One suspects this is
due to the consistancy of their
personnel.
The basic appeal of much
country music is its honest
portrayal of everyday parts of
life: drinking, truck driving,
unfaithful or unrequited love.
Fifties-Style Country Music
Instead of the ultra-nasal
renditions of such songs that are
pitched to the hard-core country
music market, Cody and the
Airmen rely on expert
musicianship and fifties-style
arrangements to create the
product which has become their
bread and butter.
At Homer's, conditions were
perfect for a memorable evening:
Independence Day, a fine
warm-up band (Asleep at the
Wheel) with a real down-home
female vocal lead, 300 people
crammed into the Warehouse, a
few Hell's Angels, and plenty of
firecrackers.
Cody's sets began with some
real country music expertly done
by the Airmen and including a
piano boogie from their
Commander. Then Cody, smoking

a stub of a cigar, strode to the
mike to do his classic talking blues
bits, such as "Smoke That
Cigarette."
Lively Revival
Next, the Lost Planet Airmen
took over for a 50s revival,
featuring songs by such
country-rooted stars as Elvis and
Jerry Lee Lewis.
It is impossible to describe the
enthusiastic reaction Commander
Cody and the Lost Planet Airmen
received from the crowd. But the
cheering after the show was at
least twice as loud as the band had
been.
Fourth of July at Homer's
Warehouse was one of those rare,
great nights in Palo Alto for
everyone who was there to enjoy
it.
