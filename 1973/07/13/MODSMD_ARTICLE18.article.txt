# John Wayne: A Vanishing Breed
## 
### ELLEN KENESHEA 
It's a man's world in John
Wayne's newest film, Cahill,
United States Marshall, but that's
nothing new. In this case, nothing
new is also not very interesting.
Cahill is a tough and honest
U.S. Marshall, battle-scarred but
undefeated, a man who needs to
go up against at least five men at a
time before he thinks the odds are
equal.
Even then they aren't, since
Cahill is really John Wayne in very
little disguise, a spry 66 year-old,
mean as ever and almost as good
as ever.
Widower Cahill has two sons
young enough to be grandsons,
Danny (Gary Grimes) and Billy
Joe (Clay O'Brien). The boys
decide to help rob a bank because

their father spends too much time
chasing outlaws and not enough
time with them.
Maybe they figure the only
way to get his attention is to have
him tracking them down too. It's
hard to tell since their motivations
throughout tend to be either
arbitrary, funny or plain stupid.
Bloody Initiation Rite
Eventually the boys become
men through the usual fare—they
learn how to kill. Cahill is less
bloodthirsty than last year's The
Cowboys in which Wayne played
mentor to a whole gang of
youngsters who managed their
rights of passage into manhood
with a marvelous flair for sadism
and brutality.
The trouble is that Wayne
seems to be training his film

youngsters to follow in a path
that doesn't exist anymore.
Film-makers once depicted the
interplay between camaraderie
and mayhem, the spirit of
solidarity between people that
danger fosters.
In that ethos, killing made men
and friendship. Women, barred
from the violence, were also
traditionally barred from the
comradship. But today even the
men don't seem to share in it
anymore.
Vanishing Clan
Danny and Billy Joe grow up,
but there isn't any male group to
grow into. There are only a few
old timers left who, like Lightfoot
(Neville Brand), have shared in the
fears and exploits that knit men
together, and they're being killed
off fast, either literally or through
self-parody.
CahilVs Lightfoot dies both
ways. Brand is likeable as
Lightfoot, and spars well with
Wayne, but they play their scenes
together fully aware of the
nostalgia they invoke.
And by the end of Cahill one
senses that the two boys never
will be as close to their father as
Lightfoot was—not because they
don't have the guts, but because
they don't care enough.
Script, Acting Problems
Both the screenplay and the

actors force that conclusion.
Harry Julian Fink and Rita M.
Fink write self-conscious dialogue
that refers to too many things and
with too much hindsight to sound
believable.
"I ain't got a bigoted bone in
my body, and I'll kill you just as
fast as I would any white man,"
Cahill tells a black outlaw in one
such anachronism.
Still, though Wayne usually
plows through even the worst
lines well enough (he hasn't been
"the Duke" all these years for
nothing) Grimes, O'Brien and
villain George Kennedy have some
problems.
Easy, But Unexciting
Kennedy rolls his eyes and
gnashes his teeth as much as bad
guy Ernest Borgnine does in his
current film, The Emperor of the
North, and it's a toss up as to
whether Kennedy or Grimes
overacts more in Cahill. As Billy
Joe, O'Brien is only slightly more
palatable.
Director Andrew V. McLaglen
has done a routine job of putting
things together, as though he were
only half paying attention
himself.
Cahill doesn't demand any
more than that of an audience,
which makes it an easy if not
especially exciting film to sit
through.

ROUGH AND TOUGH—John Wayne hardly notices the dagger in his shoulder as he portrays a
pistol-packing U.S. Marshall in his latest film. When queried about his acting ability, "the Duke" replied,
'I almost always play John Wayne." He is the all-time box-office champion and an Oscar winner.

And by the end of Cahill one
senses that the two boys never
will be as close to their father as
Lightfoot was—not because they
don't have the guts, but because
they don't care enough.
Script, Acting Problems
Both the screenplay and the

actors force that conclusion.
Harry Julian Fink and Rita M.
Fink write self-conscious dialogue
that refers to too many things and
with too much hindsight to sound
believable.
"I ain't got a bigoted bone in
my body, and I'll kill you just as
fast as I would any white man,"
Cahill tells a black outlaw in one
such anachronism.
Still, though Wayne usually
plows through even the worst
lines well enough (he hasn't been
"the Duke" all these years for
nothing) Grimes, O'Brien and
villain George Kennedy have some
problems.
Easy, But Unexciting
Kennedy rolls his eyes and
gnashes his teeth as much as bad
guy Ernest Borgnine does in his
current film, The Emperor of the
North, and it's a toss up as to
whether Kennedy or Grimes
overacts more in Cahill. As Billy
Joe, O'Brien is only slightly more
palatable.
Director Andrew V. McLaglen
has done a routine job of putting
things together, as though he were
only half paying attention
himself.
Cahill doesn't demand any
more than that of an audience,
which makes it an easy if not
especially exciting film to sit
through.

ROUGH AND TOUGH—John Wayne hardly notices the dagger in his shoulder as he portrays a
pistol-packing U.S. Marshall in his latest film. When queried about his acting ability, "the Duke" replied,
'I almost always play John Wayne." He is the all-time box-office champion and an Oscar winner.
It's a man's world in John
Wayne's newest film, Cahill,
United States Marshall, but that's
nothing new. In this case, nothing
new is also not very interesting.
Cahill is a tough and honest
U.S. Marshall, battle-scarred but
undefeated, a man who needs to
go up against at least five men at a
time before he thinks the odds are
equal.
Even then they aren't, since
Cahill is really John Wayne in very
little disguise, a spry 66 year-old,
mean as ever and almost as good
as ever.
Widower Cahill has two sons
young enough to be grandsons,
Danny (Gary Grimes) and Billy
Joe (Clay O'Brien). The boys
decide to help rob a bank because

their father spends too much time
chasing outlaws and not enough
time with them.
Maybe they figure the only
way to get his attention is to have
him tracking them down too. It's
hard to tell since their motivations
throughout tend to be either
arbitrary, funny or plain stupid.
Bloody Initiation Rite
Eventually the boys become
men through the usual fare—they
learn how to kill. Cahill is less
bloodthirsty than last year's The
Cowboys in which Wayne played
mentor to a whole gang of
youngsters who managed their
rights of passage into manhood
with a marvelous flair for sadism
and brutality.
The trouble is that Wayne
seems to be training his film

youngsters to follow in a path
that doesn't exist anymore.
Film-makers once depicted the
interplay between camaraderie
and mayhem, the spirit of
solidarity between people that
danger fosters.
In that ethos, killing made men
and friendship. Women, barred
from the violence, were also
traditionally barred from the
comradship. But today even the
men don't seem to share in it
anymore.
Vanishing Clan
Danny and Billy Joe grow up,
but there isn't any male group to
grow into. There are only a few
old timers left who, like Lightfoot
(Neville Brand), have shared in the
fears and exploits that knit men
together, and they're being killed
off fast, either literally or through
self-parody.
CahilVs Lightfoot dies both
ways. Brand is likeable as
Lightfoot, and spars well with
Wayne, but they play their scenes
together fully aware of the
nostalgia they invoke.
And by the end of Cahill one
senses that the two boys never
