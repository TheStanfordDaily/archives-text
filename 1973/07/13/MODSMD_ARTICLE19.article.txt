J. Paul Getty 111 Kidnapped
ROME — The 16-year-old grandson of billionaire J. Paul
Getty has been kidnapped, the boy's mother confirmed
yesterday.
Mrs. Gail Getty said she could not discuss ransom
demands, but she pleaded for the child's life.
Police refused to release details of the kidnapping
officially, but an Italian News agency stated that the boy
has been missing for two weeks. Unofficial police sources
said Mrs. Getty received an anonymous telephone ransom
call, and was given time to raise the money.
Nixon Blasts Senate Committee
WASHINGTON — President Nixon and Secretary of State
William Rogers jointly criticized the Senate Foreign
relations committee yesterday for refusing to promote
Laotian ambassador G. McMurtrie Godley.
Godley was recommended for the post of Assistant
Secretary of State for East Asian Affairs. The committee
rejected his nomination because the ambassador was
technically in charge of American bombing in Laos when
the Pentagon claimed there was no U.S. military activity
in that country.
Nixon and Rogers stated that an ambassador in foreign
service should not be punished for following orders which
he did not help formulate.
Food Prices To Skyrocket
NEW YORK — The President of the National Association
of Food Chains said yesterday that prices for meat and
fresh produce could be expected to skyrocket temporarily
15 percent or more after the Phase Three freeze ends.
The supermarket official warned the public to expect a
minimum four percent rise in retail food prices after the
freeze is lifted.
An official of General Foods Corp. explained that the
sharp jumps in food prices will be necessary this fall to
compensate for higher raw farm product costs.
John Dunlop, Cost of Living Council Director, voiced
administration concern over the price rises and stated the
council would investigate ways of offsetting the price
jumps.
Seven Ex-POW s Accused Again
MIAMI — Two former Vietnam POWs charged that seven
other POWs were actually guilty of collaboration with
their captors, even though court martial charges against
the seven were dropped recently.
Staff Sgt. Harry Ettmueller said he saw two of the
seven building defensive works for the North Vietnamese.
The Pentagon dropped charges against the men for lack of
evidence.
Cox Details $2.8 Million Budget
WASHINGTON — Archibald Cox, special Watergate
Prosecutor, conferred with the Senate Appropriations

Committee yesterday to detail his budget request of $2.8
million.
One million dollars will be needed for office staff and
the remainder will go to pay a 90-person staff, including
about 50 professional investigators, Cox told the panel.
Goldwater Criticizes Kennedy
WASHINGTON — Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.) said
yesterday that Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) should
"quit moralizing" about Watergate until the facts of the
Chappaquidick tragedy are known.
Speaking before a young Republicans convention,
Goldwater accused Kennedy of opening his 1976
presidential campaign by acting as "both judge and jury in
the Watergate affair."
N.Y. Congressman Indicated
WASHINGTON — Congressman Bertram Podell (D-N.Y.)
was charged with bribery yesterday, and lashed back,
calling himself a victim of Watergate.
Podell allegedly took more than $41,000 to influence
federal agencies to grant a Florida-to-Bahamas mail route
to Florida airline.
The representative called his indictment "political
assassination by the White House meant to atone for the
cesspool of crime and corruption uncovered in the
Watergate hearings."
Podell said he is ready to stand trial today if he has to
and claims he will be vindicated.

Timber Panel Commissioned
SACRAMENTO — State Assembly Speaker Robert
Moretti commissioned a special assembly committee to
look into the effects of rapid timber-cutting on the state's
northern coast economy.
Moretti voiced concern that trees are apparently being
cut faster than they can be grown. This heavy harvesting
could not only jeopardize the long-term stability of the
coast region's economy, but could also leave areas of
Humbolt, Del Norte, and Mendocino counties blighted,
the speaker said.

council would investigate ways of offsetting the price
jumps.
