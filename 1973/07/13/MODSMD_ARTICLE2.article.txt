# Nixon Enters Md. Hospital

### 
WASHINGTON â€” President Nixon
entered Bethesda Naval Hospital in
Maryland yesterday to undergo
treatment for viral pneumonia.
Doctors indicated that there are
"no complications" and that Nixon
should be released within a week if all
goes well.
Nixon's temperature reached the
102 degree mark last night. Maj. Gen.
Walter Tkach, chief White House
physician, was summoned to the
President's bedside early yesterday
after the President complained of
"discomfort in the right chest."
Nixon was taken to the hospital last
night, where x-rays confirmed Tkach's
diagnosis of pneumonia.
This is the first time the President
has been seriously ill since he took
office.
Despite his illness, Nixon met
yesterday with the West German
foreign minister, and conferred with
Sen. Sam Ervin (D-N.C.), chairman of
the Senate Watergate Committee.
