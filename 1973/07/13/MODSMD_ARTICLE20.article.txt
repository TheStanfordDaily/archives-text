# Hayman Appointed School Superintendent
## 
### 
Warren Hayman, resident fellow in Roble Hall last year, was appointed
superintendent of the Ravenswood City School District Wednesday.
Hayman will manager the district which encompasses East Palo Alto
and eastern Menlo Park. He will have a two-year contract with an annual
salary of $30,000.
Both parents and teachers in the district lended vocal support for
Hayman, who had served as acting superintendent of the Ravenswood
district since John Minor's Oct. 1 resignation.
Earlier this year, Hayman and school board members were embroiled in
a heated controversy over the appointment of San Diego State University
urban education director John Cleveland to the superintendent's position.
The board finally selected Hayman after three board members
supporting Cleveland declined to run for re-election in April. The three
new trustees supported Hayman.
