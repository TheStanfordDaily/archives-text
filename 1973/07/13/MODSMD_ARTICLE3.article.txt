# PA-Stanford Liaison Committee Proposed
## 
### BOB FUSS 
Stanford and Palo Alto officials
agreed Wednesday to recommend
establishing a liaison committee to
discuss mutual problems, such as
housing and land use policies.
The proposed committee would be
made up of top level staff members
from both the University and the city,
led by University Vice President for
Business and Finance Robert
Augsburger and Palo Alto City
Manager George Sipel.
The rest of the committee is yet to
be named, but will not include any
members of the Stanford Board of
Trustees or the Palo Alto City Council.
Sipel says the exact topics of
discussion are not yet finalized, but
will be broader than the original city
council resolution which called for the
University and city to "explore
cooperative methods to determine the
location of future housing."
A joint statement by President
Richard Lyman and Palo Alto Mayor
Kirke Comstock cites as possible
topics land use, cable television, and
joint services such as fire, sewage and
recreation.
Monthly Meetings
The committee would meet
privately at least once a month,
followed by public reports to the city
council and private reports to
University officials on the actions of
the committee.
In addition to Lyman, Comstock,
Augsburger and Sipel, Law Prof.
Byron Sher, a City Councilman, and
Board of Trustees President Robert
Minge Brown were at Wednesday's
luncheon meeting.
At that meeting, Sher suggested
that study sessions could be held
between the city council, planning
commission and other city groups with
university officials in addition to the
regular meetings.
These meetings would, according to
Sipel, be open to the public. Another
proposal came from Lyman to hold
special briefing sessions for city
council members on the University's
future plans.
Both Sides Pleased
Officials on both sides were pleased
with the outcome of the meeting and
optimistic about the new liaison
committee which still must be
approved by the city council.
Lyman said the meeting was "very
positive and constructive," and
Comstock said he is "quite satisfied"
with what he termed a first step
forward in better relations between
the city and the University.
Plans for a liaison committee have
come and gone over the past several
years, blocked mostly by Stanford's

insistence on secrecy. Previously, the
Brown Act, California's anti-secrecy
law, forced the city to turn down
proposals for committees which
wouldn't be open to press and public.
However, according to Palo Alto
City Attorney Peter Stone, since no
council members will be on the
committee, "the Brown Act clearly
does not apply." When asked if the
situation would be different if council
members were on the committee,
Stone responded, "We would have to
look at that very carefully."
Evolutionary Process
Comstock acknowledged that the
agreement Wednesday was that there
would be no public meetings and said
that he thought "we came about as far
as I would expect to. It will be an
evolutionary thing with our
relationship with Stanford."
Augsburger said that if councilmen
were on the committee, and the
committee legally had to meet in
public, "it would be quite clear that
some things wouldn't be discussed."
The problem of secrecy "wasn't
discussed per se" at Wednesday's
meeting, said Augsburger, but he said
he suspected it was "an implicit
reason" why only staff members were
present.
