# Chino Murder Trial Goes To Jury
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Closing arguments in the trial of
Andrea Holman Burt and Benton
Douglas Burt will conclude today in
San Bernardino Superior Court. Jury
deliberations are expected to begin
this afternoon.
The Burts face charges of murder,
assault, and freeing a prisoner
(lynching). The state has contended
that .they were part of a conspiracy
that designed and executed a plan to
free convict Ronald Wayne Beaty from
the California Institution for Men at
Chino last Oct. 6. A prison guard was
killed and another wounded in the
escape.
Although the Burts are on trial for
murder, no one claims they actually
fired the fatal gunshot. Judge Thomas
Haldorsen will instruct the six-man,
six-woman jury that they may convict
the couple of murder only by finding
that the guard's death was a
"reasonably foreseeable consequence"
of their alleged participation in the
escape conspiracy.
Closing Arguments
In his closing argument Wednesday,
Deputy Dist. Atty. Joseph D. Canty
summarized 2 I A months of testimony

in a two-hour statement. He reviewed
the evidence in a succinct, low-key
manner, but asked the jury not to
forget "the awful, stark drama of the
crime."
Canty referred in particular to the
testimony of Beaty, who turned state's
evidence in a plea bargain when he was
recaptured two months after his
escape. Beaty is serving a life sentence
for the murder of the guard, but his
testimony has provided the state's
most damaging evidence against the
Burts and others.
Canty emphasized how much of
Beaty's statement was subsequently
corroborated by police investigation.
But he referred mainly to Beaty's
description of places where he hid
while he was a fugitive and to his
statements implicating former
Venceremos member Jean Hobson and
so-called "hit man" Robert Seabock
who face escape-related murder,
lynching, and assault charges in a
separate trial.
Credibility Attacked
The prosecutor attacked the
credibility of the defendants' denials
of involvement in the crime. He read
excerpts from the diary kept by

Andrea Burt when she visited Cuba
with a Venceremos brigade in 1971.
Earlier this week, Andrea Burt took
the stand, and in testimony that
paralleled her husband's, denied any
involvement in Beaty's escape plan.
The Burts claim they were in Hay ward
at the time of the ambush-escape.
Under cross-examination, Canty
questioned her about her political
beliefs, focusing on her membership in
Venceremos, a Maoist, communist
revolutionary organization. The
19-year-old daughter of Medicine Prof.
Halsted Holman explained that she
had advocated revolutionary activities,
but did not consider Beaty's escape
revolutionary. The revolutionary
approach would alter society so that
people would not become criminals in
the first place, she said.
Minutes Read
Canty again referred to Venceremos
in his closing arguments by reading
from the minutes of a Venceremos
meeting in which Beaty's escape was
described as "a rare example of the
politics we stand for." The
organization, however, has repeatedly
denied involvement in the alleged
conspiracy.

Defense attorney Charles Garry
began his closing arguments yesterday
afternoon and will deliver the
remainder of his statement this
morning.
Haldorsen is expected to instruct
the jury sometime this afternoon,
following Garry's final arguments.
Andrea Burt's father recently told
the Daily that he believed the evidence
at hand against the Burts does not
permit a conviction. But he added,
"prosecution action which began in
armed raids, false arrests,
unconstitutional treatment of Doug
and Andrea after they surrendered,
suppression of evidence, failure to
follow up exonerating evidence, the
burglary, the bribery, and the
surveillance — everything that the
prosecution could do which was illegal
or undemocratic — they've done
becamse they're interested in getting a
conviction and because of the politics
associated with the case."
'Political' Case
"The prosecution's case is almost
totally political," he added. Holman
said the case was aimed at repressing
revolutionary causes, such as the
prison movement. Although he
described the state's case against the
Burts as "lousy evidence" he refused
to be optimistic in his hopes for an
acquittal.
"There are a number of grounds for
appeal," Holman said, referring to the
possibility of a conviction. "But unless
we can unearth a substantial new fact,
we have no way of asking for a new
trial on the basis of the verdict itself."
Nick Goldstein, a Stanford law
student facing escape-relating federal
charges in Arizona, told the Daily that
his case has been temporarily taken off
the trial calendar. He said federal
officials seemed to be "losing
enthusiasm for Red-baiting," but
declined to commented on his case
until after the Burts' verdict is
announced.

revolutionary. The revolutionary
approach would alter society so that
people would not become criminals in
the first place, she said.
Minutes Read
Canty again referred to Venceremos
in his closing arguments by reading
from the minutes of a Venceremos
meeting in which Beaty's escape was
described as "a rare example of the
politics we stand for." The
organization, however, has repeatedly
denied involvement in the alleged
conspiracy.

Defense attorney Charles Garry
began his closing arguments yesterday
afternoon and will deliver the
remainder of his statement this
morning.
Haldorsen is expected to instruct
the jury sometime this afternoon,
following Garry's final arguments.
Andrea Burt's father recently told
the Daily that he believed the evidence
at hand against the Burts does not
permit a conviction. But he added,
"prosecution action which began in
armed raids, false arrests,
unconstitutional treatment of Doug
and Andrea after they surrendered,
suppression of evidence, failure to
follow up exonerating evidence, the
burglary, the bribery, and the
surveillance — everything that the
prosecution could do which was illegal
or undemocratic — they've done
becamse they're interested in getting a
conviction and because of the politics
associated with the case."
'Political' Case
"The prosecution's case is almost
totally political," he added. Holman
said the case was aimed at repressing
revolutionary causes, such as the
prison movement. Although he
described the state's case against the
Burts as "lousy evidence" he refused
to be optimistic in his hopes for an
acquittal.
"There are a number of grounds for
appeal," Holman said, referring to the
possibility of a conviction. "But unless
we can unearth a substantial new fact,
we have no way of asking for a new
trial on the basis of the verdict itself."
Nick Goldstein, a Stanford law
student facing escape-relating federal
charges in Arizona, told the Daily that
his case has been temporarily taken off
the trial calendar. He said federal
officials seemed to be "losing
enthusiasm for Red-baiting," but
declined to commented on his case
until after the Burts' verdict is
announced.
Closing arguments in the trial of
Andrea Holman Burt and Benton
Douglas Burt will conclude today in
San Bernardino Superior Court. Jury
deliberations are expected to begin
this afternoon.
The Burts face charges of murder,
assault, and freeing a prisoner
(lynching). The state has contended
that .they were part of a conspiracy
that designed and executed a plan to
free convict Ronald Wayne Beaty from
the California Institution for Men at
Chino last Oct. 6. A prison guard was
killed and another wounded in the
escape.
Although the Burts are on trial for
murder, no one claims they actually
fired the fatal gunshot. Judge Thomas
Haldorsen will instruct the six-man,
six-woman jury that they may convict
the couple of murder only by finding
that the guard's death was a
"reasonably foreseeable consequence"
of their alleged participation in the
escape conspiracy.
Closing Arguments
In his closing argument Wednesday,
Deputy Dist. Atty. Joseph D. Canty
summarized 2 I A months of testimony

in a two-hour statement. He reviewed
the evidence in a succinct, low-key
manner, but asked the jury not to
forget "the awful, stark drama of the
crime."
Canty referred in particular to the
testimony of Beaty, who turned state's
evidence in a plea bargain when he was
recaptured two months after his
escape. Beaty is serving a life sentence
for the murder of the guard, but his
testimony has provided the state's
most damaging evidence against the
Burts and others.
Canty emphasized how much of
Beaty's statement was subsequently
corroborated by police investigation.
But he referred mainly to Beaty's
description of places where he hid
while he was a fugitive and to his
statements implicating former
Venceremos member Jean Hobson and
so-called "hit man" Robert Seabock
who face escape-related murder,
lynching, and assault charges in a
separate trial.
Credibility Attacked
The prosecutor attacked the
credibility of the defendants' denials
of involvement in the crime. He read
excerpts from the diary kept by

Andrea Burt when she visited Cuba
with a Venceremos brigade in 1971.
Earlier this week, Andrea Burt took
the stand, and in testimony that
paralleled her husband's, denied any
involvement in Beaty's escape plan.
The Burts claim they were in Hay ward
at the time of the ambush-escape.
Under cross-examination, Canty
questioned her about her political
beliefs, focusing on her membership in
Venceremos, a Maoist, communist
revolutionary organization. The
19-year-old daughter of Medicine Prof.
Halsted Holman explained that she
had advocated revolutionary activities,
but did not consider Beaty's escape
revolutionary. The revolutionary
approach would alter society so that
people would not become criminals in
the first place, she said.

fired the fatal gunshot. Judge Thomas
Haldorsen will instruct the six-man,
six-woman jury that they may convict
the couple of murder only by finding
that the guard's death was a
"reasonably foreseeable consequence"
of their alleged participation in the
escape conspiracy.
Closing Arguments
In his closing argument Wednesday,
Deputy Dist. Atty. Joseph D. Canty
summarized 2 I A months of testimony

in a two-hour statement. He reviewed
the evidence in a succinct, low-key
manner, but asked the jury not to
forget "the awful, stark drama of the
crime."
Canty referred in particular to the
testimony of Beaty, who turned state's
evidence in a plea bargain when he was
recaptured two months after his
escape. Beaty is serving a life sentence
for the murder of the guard, but his
testimony has provided the state's
most damaging evidence against the
Burts and others.
Canty emphasized how much of
Beaty's statement was subsequently
corroborated by police investigation.
But he referred mainly to Beaty's
description of places where he hid
while he was a fugitive and to his
statements implicating former
Venceremos member Jean Hobson and
so-called "hit man" Robert Seabock
who face escape-related murder,
lynching, and assault charges in a
separate trial.
Credibility Attacked
The prosecutor attacked the
credibility of the defendants' denials
of involvement in the crime. He read
excerpts from the diary kept by

Andrea Burt when she visited Cuba
with a Venceremos brigade in 1971.
Earlier this week, Andrea Burt took
the stand, and in testimony that
paralleled her husband's, denied any
involvement in Beaty's escape plan.
The Burts claim they were in Hay ward
at the time of the ambush-escape.
Under cross-examination, Canty
questioned her about her political
beliefs, focusing on her membership in
Venceremos, a Maoist, communist
revolutionary organization. The
19-year-old daughter of Medicine Prof.
Halsted Holman explained that she
had advocated revolutionary activities,
but did not consider Beaty's escape
revolutionary. The revolutionary
approach would alter society so that
people would not become criminals in
the first place, she said.
Minutes Read
Canty again referred to Venceremos
in his closing arguments by reading
from the minutes of a Venceremos
meeting in which Beaty's escape was
described as "a rare example of the
politics we stand for." The
organization, however, has repeatedly
denied involvement in the alleged
conspiracy.

Defense attorney Charles Garry
began his closing arguments yesterday
afternoon and will deliver the
remainder of his statement this
morning.
Haldorsen is expected to instruct
the jury sometime this afternoon,
following Garry's final arguments.
Andrea Burt's father recently told
the Daily that he believed the evidence
at hand against the Burts does not
permit a conviction. But he added,
"prosecution action which began in
armed raids, false arrests,
unconstitutional treatment of Doug
and Andrea after they surrendered,
suppression of evidence, failure to
follow up exonerating evidence, the
burglary, the bribery, and the
surveillance — everything that the
prosecution could do which was illegal
or undemocratic — they've done
becamse they're interested in getting a
conviction and because of the politics
associated with the case."
'Political' Case
"The prosecution's case is almost
totally political," he added. Holman
said the case was aimed at repressing
revolutionary causes, such as the
prison movement. Although he
described the state's case against the
Burts as "lousy evidence" he refused
to be optimistic in his hopes for an
acquittal.
"There are a number of grounds for
appeal," Holman said, referring to the
possibility of a conviction. "But unless
we can unearth a substantial new fact,
we have no way of asking for a new
trial on the basis of the verdict itself."
Nick Goldstein, a Stanford law
student facing escape-relating federal
charges in Arizona, told the Daily that
his case has been temporarily taken off
the trial calendar. He said federal
officials seemed to be "losing
enthusiasm for Red-baiting," but
declined to commented on his case
until after the Burts' verdict is
announced.
