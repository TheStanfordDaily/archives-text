# Mitchell Concludes Testimony
## Nixon-Ervin Meeting Arranged 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
Special to the Daily
WASHINGTON - Sen. Sam Ervin
(D-N.C.), chairman of the Senate
Watergate Committee, announced
yesterday he will meet with President
Nixon to try to "avoid any possibility
of a confrontation between the
Committee, as a representative of the
legislative branch of government, and
the White House."
Ervin's surprise announcement
came in the middle of yesterday's
Watergate hearings — the third day of
testimony from former Atty. Gen.
John Mitchell.
The meeting will be held, Ervin
said, "after certain pressing matters are
handled" by the President.
Nixon had refused last week to

meet with Committee representatives
or to open White House files. By
yesterday, the Committee agreed
unanimously to demand access to
records of those implicated in the
Watergate scandal.
Nixon Yielded
While the President yielded on the
matter of cooperating with Ervin,
however, a White House statement
yesterday reiterated Nixon's
determination not to open the files.
The meeting was arranged in a
telephone call Ervin made to Nixon
early yesterday while the President
was resting in Bethesda Naval Hospital.
Ervin said that he had asked that Sen.
Howard Baker (R-Tenn.) be included
in the meeting, but that the President
refused.

Sen. Daniel Inouye (D-Haw.) and
Committee counsel Samuel Dash
continued to cross-examine Mitchell
yesterday, concentrating on what Dash
called "discrepancies" in the former
attorney general's testimony.
Dash pressed Mitchell on his
account of the hiring of convicted
Watergate conspirator G. Gordon
Liddy - the fact that Mitchell
downplayed his role — and his
assertion that he knew nothing of the
widespread, and apparently illegal,
electronic surveillance carried out by
Administration agents throughout
1972.
"Do you realize," Dash asked,
"that in order to believe your
testimony we would have to believe
[that of] Mr. Magruder, Mr. Sloan, Mr.
McCord, Mr. Reasoner, Mr. Star.s, and
in some respects, Mr. Dean?"
Mitchell responded that he
disagreed "violently" with Dash's
interpretation of the prior testimony.
Yesterday was the third day of
testimony of the Nixon confidant
who, during his tenure as attorney
general, had been a symbol of the
Administration's commitment to law
and order.
Throughout, Mitchell has been a
reluctant and occasionally testy
witness. This week has seen little of
the cordiality that prevailed with
former White House counsel John W.
Dean 111. But Dean had received a
promise of limited immunity — and
was not under federal indictment, as is
Mitchell.
Evasiveness
As a result, Mitchell has often
appeared evasive, sometimes provoking
the ire of members of the Committee.
On Wednesday, when Baker asked
Mitchell the same question twice and
failed to get a satisfactory answer both
times, the Tennessee Republican noted
angrily that it would do little good to
ask again.
"That's right," muttered Mitchell.
"Three strikes and you're out."
Unlike previous witnesses, Mitchell
came with no prepared opening
statement and frequently relied on
what he termed his "best

recollection."
On Tuesday, Mitchell coolly
admitted that he knew about the
Watergate cover-up during the 1972
campaign but said he did not tell
President Nixon about it "so he could
go on through the campaign without
being involved."
Priorities
"You placed the expediency of the
next election above your
responsibilities as an intimate to advise
the President of the peril that
surrounded him?" asked Sen. Herman
Talmadge (D-Ga.).
"In my mind, the re-election of
Richard Nixon, compared with what
was available on the other side, was so
important that I put it in exactly that
context," Mitchell replied.
Mitchell directly contradicted the
testimony of previous witnesses,
principally Jeb Stuart Magruder and
Dean, who testified that he personally
approved the bugging at the
Democratic National Headquarters and

participated actively in the ensuing
cover-up.
Magruder's account of giving
Mitchell a copy of the "Gemstone"
papers, he said, was "a palpable,
damnable lie." The Watergate bugging,
Mitchell said, was carried out as "a
misunderstanding or contravention of
my orders."
The Committee spent Wednesday
questioning Mitchell closely on
apparent contradictions between his

current testimony and a sworn
statement he made last year. Sen.
Lowell Weicker (R-Conn.) pressed
Mitchell on whether he failed to meet
his legal responsibilities in not telling
Nixon what he knew. Mitchell
conceded he had not.
At one point, Mitchell testified that
after June 20, 1972, the President
never asked him what to do about the
Watergate affair, despite revelations
that were appearing almost daily in the
press.
