# Paper Says U.S. To Back Sihanouk

Special to the Daily
CHICAGO â€” President Nixon is ready
to dump the entire U.S.-backed regime
in Cambodia, the Chicago Sun Times
reported yesterday.
Citing ' 4 highly-placed
Administration sources," the Sun
Times said Nixon is willing to turn
back the clock to 1970 by accepting
the return to power of Prince
Norodom Sihanouk with no strings
attached.
Nixon decided to withdraw support
from the current regime of Marshal
Lon Nol because he had no other
choice after Congress set an Aug. 15
deadline for the end of U.S. bombing,
the sources said.
The sources indicated that the
Soviet Union has given tentative
support to the decision to reinstate
Sihanouk, now living in exile in Peking
after he was deposed in 1970.
Sihanouk has claimed that the U.S.
Central Intelligence Agency engineered
the coup which ousted him.
Henry A. Kissinger, Nixon's
national security adviser, is expected
to seek China's approval for the
Sihanouk reinstatement this summer,
possibly within the next four weeks.
Kissinger has expressed a desire to
meet with Sihanouk himself in Peking,
but the Prince so far has refused.
However, that refusal was based on
prior U.S. demands that he agree to
enter a coalition with the current
regime.
The sources indicated that
Sihanouk may agree now that those
conditions have been dropped.
Previously, the Administration had
been trying to get the Prince to agree
to share power with Lt. Gen. Sisowath
Sirik Matak, reportedly the only
current official highly regarded by the
U.S.
But the sources said the U.S. is now
prepared to dump both Matak and
Lon Nol.
Insurgents currently hold large
chunks of Cambodia and are only a
few miles from the capital of Phnom
Penh. Lon Nol's forces are not
expected to stand after the end of U.S.
bombing support.
