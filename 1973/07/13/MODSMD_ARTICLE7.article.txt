# Native Governments At Fault
## Africa's Farmers Exploited 
### 
Craig Roberts

Second of Two Parts
Western taxpayers who are
assuaging "guilt" for the poverty
of underdeveloped countries are
fattening the pocketbooks of
others, but the others are not the
exploited farmers of West Africa.
Indeed, the government-to
government grants that
characterize "foreign aid" allow
the recipient governments to
consolidate and extend their
exploitation of their own
citizenry. The situation is made
even worse by the fact that many
of the African government leaders
are products of Western
universities and have little
sympathy for the culture of those
they govern.
It is clear that the state
marketing monopolies are
supported not by the producers
whose incomes they confiscate,
but by officials of governments
and international organizations
and their academic handmaids.
As the boards came to
accumulate huge reserves by
exploiting the farmers, price
stabilization gradually receded as
the argument for their existence.
Now it is said that the boards
are necessary to raise taxes to
finance economic development
and to control inflation. In other
words, the agricultural producers
are going to be imperialized to the
end.
Strange Logic
The marketing boards have
even been supported by some on
the grounds that they prevented
the rise of a kulak class in West

Africa, that is, the exploitation of
the native producers by their own
governments has been supported
by some Western intellectuals on
the grounds that it was necessary
to prevent the emergence of a
prosperous peasantry!
No one has explained why the
economic development of West
Africa should require the
exploitation of private farmers,
but it is apparent that the
exploitative policy of the state
monopolies has made private
savings and investment by farmers
difficult or impossible. The policy
lias obstructed the development
of an African middle class and
African private enterprises.
The policy has retarded the
growth of income of farmers and
thereby reduced their demand for
manufactured articles. Even more
importantly, the policy has
retarded the expansion of the
production of cash crops and the
development of a market system.
In addition to these economic
consequences, the concentration
of power and money in the hands
of government has increased the
intensity of the political conflicts
in Ghana and Nigeria.
The Real Imperialists
The practice of many Western
intellectuals of considering the
peoples of the underdeveloped
world as victims of external
factors, especially of colonialism,
masks the real imperialists—the
state marketing monopolies and
the governments that sanction
them.
Nevertheless, this practice has

strong emotional appeal to liberals
and enjoys the support of
powerful vested interests. The
supposed helplessness of people in
face of outside forces serves as a
basis for the advocacy of
far-reaching policies of social
engineering.
Those who claim to have
diagnosed the condition of the
alleged victims claim the right and
ability to remold the victims and
their society.
Gunnar Myrdal, for example,
in Asian Drama makes a plea for
an all-powerful government
dedicated to remaking people and
society, and he alleges that the
more prosperous persons, groups
and countries are responsible for
the poverty of the rest.
'State' Is 'Private'
This results in demagogy
against the productive and in the
confusion of government with the
governed. As a result, the state
sector is termed the public sector
and is contrasted with the private
sector.
This is Orwellian. State
enterprise is private in the sense
that it normally enjoys statutory
monopoly, so entry is blocked
and the public cannot participate.
Private enterprise is open to all
and is thereby public.
What has been overlooked is
that government has its own
interests—interests which are
independent of any "public
interest" or, for that matter, of
any political party. The problem
of government entering the
economic sector is that it gives
government—which is simply one
other private interest—too much
power over other private interests.
Ability To Exploit
Since native governments
produce less antagonism in their
subjects than do colonial
governments simply because they
are not foreign, native
governments can take more from
those they govern than can
foreign imperialists.
It is not conceivable that any
colonialist or foreign imperialist
could levy taxation on the
American population at rates
equivalent to those of their
present personal and corporate
income taxes. And no foreign
colonialist today could withhold
between one-third and one-half
the commercial values of the
crops of native African producers.
If we take this into account, it
is conceivable that the citizens of
every country would be better off

economically if governed by a
foreign imperialist.
Erroneous Assumption
Indigenous imperialism has
been obscured by an assumption
uderlying the economic theory of
public goods which asserts that
governments act not in their own
interests but in the interests of
others—the "public interest."
Economists who use the
"public interest" assumption to
analyze the state sector
simultaneously assume that other
organized groups and individuals
act in their self-interest.
The real imperialists go scot
free while Western experts on
economic development fatten
their pocketbooks and West
African native farmers are
exploited. Economic development
is retarded, and the lack of
progress is taken as evidence for
more foreign aid which further
entrenches the power of the
indigenous imperialists.
The rationale for the marketing
boards is clear. They result from
the cult of state power which
serves the material interests of a
new class of planners, academics,
state functionaries, and
international civil servants—a class
Which appropriates the wealth of
others under the guise of the
"public interest." These salaried
do-gooders are the new
imperialists.
