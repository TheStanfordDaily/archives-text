TV Violence
Editor:
We were dismayed to read in
the July 10 Daily that Prof.
Alberta Siegel is advocating the
censorship of television programs
that show violent activities.
Adding "child advocates" and
child development psychologists
to those who already are
regulating and banning TV
programs is increasing the amount

of censorship in American society.
The violence that naturally is
portrayed on television programs
about policemen, detectives,
cowboys, and outlaws is quite
appropriate. The conflict between
a policeman and the robber of a
grocery store is a conflict that is
resolved through such violence.
Television fiction in which the
"good guys" fight the "bad guys"
is both engrossing entertainment
for children (as well as adults) and
drama with a moral basis. The
alternative of just endlessly
watching Miss Goody Two-Shoes
without villains and the violent
suppression of those villains is
simply boring.

Immunize Pets
Editor:
We have been warned to avoid
fallen bats. In view of the recent
outbreak of Marin County of rabies
in horses, our caution should
probably be extended to other
mammalian species. Floundering
rabid bats would be attractive
prey to any cat, thus making it
advisable to avoid uninoculated

cats. For the sake of animal and
man, pet owners of the Stanford
community would be well advised
to have their pets immunized
during this epidemic.

Editor's Note: Two sentences
from the letter of Pam Evans and

A. Lee Zeigler, which appeared
July 10, were deleted prior to
publication. As they contain
information crucial to their
argument, they are printed here.
Despite labor market realities,
many students are fortunate
enough to secure employment as
practical training following their
degree programs. Practical
training, for a maximum of 18
months following a degree
program by the student-visa
holder, is a privilege rather than
an entitlement, and permission is
granted to accept such a position
after it has been established that
the job enhances the students
academic program and does not
displace a U.S. resident.
