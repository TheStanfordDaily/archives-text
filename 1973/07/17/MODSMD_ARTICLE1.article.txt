# Surprise Witness Claims Nixon Had Own Conversations Taped
## 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
Special to the Daily
WASHINGTON—Former White House
aide Alexander P. Butterfield told the
Senate Watergate Committee
yesterday that President Nixon's
offices have been bugged — by Nixon
himself — since 1970.
Butterfield, who until four months
ago was an assistant to former
Presidential aide H.R. Haldeman, said
he supervised the installation of
recording devices on telephones in the
Presidential offices of the White House
and Executive Office buildings, in the
White House's Lincoln bedroom, and
in the Aspen Lodge at Camp David, in
the spring and summer of 1970.
In addition, voice-activated devices
were installed in the Oval Office and in
the President's smaller office in the
Executive Office Building.
To his knowledge, Butterfield said,
"every conversation that took place
within reach of the voice-activated
devices was recorded."
No one was warned by the

President that conversations were
taped, and no legally required "beep"
tone interrupted telephone calls. The
installation was done "on the
authority of the President," he said.
Purpose
Chief counsel Sam Dash asked
Butterfield the purpose of the
expensive recording systems.
"There is no doubt in my mind,"
Butterfield responded, "that they were
installed to record things for posterity
— for the Nixon library. The President
was quite conscious of that sort of
thing...."
The reveiation set off immediate
speculation that the key to many
Watergate mysteries lies in the tapes. It
also apparently strengthened the
committee's resolve to demand access
to White House files — which are now
known to include what must be a vast
library of recorded conversations with
Congressional leaders, diplomats, and
White House aides, including John W.
Dean 111.
The committee will meet tomorrow

to draft a letter requesting that the
tapes be made available, but it was
thought unlikely here that any other
action would be taken until after Sen.
Sam Ervin's (D —N.C.)
still-unscheduled meeting with
President Nixon.
Embarrassment
Whether the tapes ever see the light
of day, and whether they confirm
Dean's testimony, yesterday's
revelation has already become a deep
embarrassment to the Nixon
Administration.
Congressional reaction was swift
and harsh. Sen. Edward Brooke
(R—Mass.) called it "an invasion of the
right of privacy ... unethical,
immoral, and I think it sort of reeks of
totalitarianism."
It is unclear whether a single
violation is involved. Failure to
provide a beep tone when recording
telephone conversations violates
Federal communications regulations,
but it is a tariff — not a criminal —
violation.

The President can be fined or his
telephone service can be cut off; Dash
conceded with a smile yesterday that
either sanction was "unlikely."
Unscheduled Appearance
Butterfield, now Federal Aviation
administrator, made his unscheduled
appearance before the committee late
yesterday morning.
His heretofore-unknown role in the
Watergate scandal was uncovered by
accident by a member of the
committee's minority staff who
happened to ask him about Dean's
suspicion that key Presidential
conversations might be on tape.
The White House reacted
immediately to the surprise testimony.
A statement from Presidential counsel
J. Fred Buzhardt confirmed the
existence and use of the recording
devices, and explained that the late
President Lyndon Johnson had used
"a similar system" during his term in
office.
That charge was disputed by both
former Johnson aide Joseph Califano,
who called it "an outright lie," and the
Secret Service, which said no previous
administration had attached recording
devices to its telephones.
Kalmbach
The testimony of yesterday's main
scheduled witness, Herbert Kalmbach,
was almost lost in the uproar.
Kalmbach, once Nixon's personal
attorney, acted as the conduit for the
Committee to Re-elect the President
"defense fund" payments to the
original seven Watergate defendants.
Kalmbach, who was recruited for
the job by Dean, said he felt his role
was "sort of distasteful," and told of
going to Presidential adviser John
Ehrlichman with his misgivings.
His testimony placed blame for the
payments, which totaled more than
$75,000, squarely at Ehrlichman's
feet. "Herb," he described Ehrlichman
as telling him, "John Dean does have
the authority, it is proper, and you are
to go forward."

Sam Ervin's (D —N.C.)
still-unscheduled meeting with
President Nixon.
Embarrassment
Whether the tapes ever see the light
of day, and whether they confirm
Dean's testimony, yesterday's
revelation has already become a deep
embarrassment to the Nixon
Administration.
Congressional reaction was swift
and harsh. Sen. Edward Brooke
(R—Mass.) called it "an invasion of the
right of privacy ... unethical,
immoral, and I think it sort of reeks of
totalitarianism."
It is unclear whether a single
violation is involved. Failure to
provide a beep tone when recording
telephone conversations violates
Federal communications regulations,
but it is a tariff — not a criminal —
violation.

The President can be fined or his
telephone service can be cut off; Dash
conceded with a smile yesterday that
either sanction was "unlikely."
Unscheduled Appearance
Butterfield, now Federal Aviation
administrator, made his unscheduled
appearance before the committee late
yesterday morning.
His heretofore-unknown role in the
Watergate scandal was uncovered by
accident by a member of the
committee's minority staff who
happened to ask him about Dean's
suspicion that key Presidential
conversations might be on tape.
The White House reacted
immediately to the surprise testimony.
A statement from Presidential counsel
J. Fred Buzhardt confirmed the
existence and use of the recording
devices, and explained that the late
President Lyndon Johnson had used
"a similar system" during his term in
office.
That charge was disputed by both
former Johnson aide Joseph Califano,
who called it "an outright lie," and the
Secret Service, which said no previous
administration had attached recording
devices to its telephones.
Kalmbach
The testimony of yesterday's main
scheduled witness, Herbert Kalmbach,
was almost lost in the uproar.
Kalmbach, once Nixon's personal
attorney, acted as the conduit for the
Committee to Re-elect the President
"defense fund" payments to the
original seven Watergate defendants.
Kalmbach, who was recruited for
the job by Dean, said he felt his role
was "sort of distasteful," and told of
going to Presidential adviser John
Ehrlichman with his misgivings.
His testimony placed blame for the
payments, which totaled more than
$75,000, squarely at Ehrlichman's
feet. "Herb," he described Ehrlichman
as telling him, "John Dean does have
the authority, it is proper, and you are
to go forward."
Special to the Daily
WASHINGTON—Former White House
aide Alexander P. Butterfield told the
Senate Watergate Committee
yesterday that President Nixon's
offices have been bugged — by Nixon
himself — since 1970.
Butterfield, who until four months
ago was an assistant to former
Presidential aide H.R. Haldeman, said
he supervised the installation of
recording devices on telephones in the
Presidential offices of the White House
and Executive Office buildings, in the
White House's Lincoln bedroom, and
in the Aspen Lodge at Camp David, in
the spring and summer of 1970.
In addition, voice-activated devices
were installed in the Oval Office and in
the President's smaller office in the
Executive Office Building.
To his knowledge, Butterfield said,
"every conversation that took place
within reach of the voice-activated
devices was recorded."
No one was warned by the

President that conversations were
taped, and no legally required "beep"
tone interrupted telephone calls. The
installation was done "on the
authority of the President," he said.
Purpose
Chief counsel Sam Dash asked
Butterfield the purpose of the
expensive recording systems.
"There is no doubt in my mind,"
Butterfield responded, "that they were
installed to record things for posterity
— for the Nixon library. The President
was quite conscious of that sort of
thing...."
The reveiation set off immediate
speculation that the key to many
Watergate mysteries lies in the tapes. It
also apparently strengthened the
committee's resolve to demand access
to White House files — which are now
known to include what must be a vast
library of recorded conversations with
