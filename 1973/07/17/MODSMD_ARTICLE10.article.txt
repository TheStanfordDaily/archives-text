# Medieval Drama Lacks Clarity
## 
### GEORGE POWELL 
A full moon was rising over the
roof of the Stern Community
center. It was Friday the 13th,
seemingly a perfect evening for
presenting the medieval musical
drama Cry, Wolf!
The play, the first of four to be
presented by The Workshop as
part of the Firecircle Festival this
summer, did not quite live up to
the early evening's atmosphere.
Depending on how you
verbalize it, Cry Wolf! can have
several interpretations. The play
operated on just about as many
levels as the phrase can be
emphasized, and did not succeed
on all of them equally well.
Essentially a medieval play
within a play within a play, Cry
Wolf! concerns a small town in
13th Century Italy, which on All
Fools Night, presents a play about
three miracles worked by a wolf.
These miracles help make the

town famous, and at the same
time provide a body of accepted
beliefs for the townspeople.
Answers Without Focus
But are the beliefs accepted
completely? Who really is the
wolf? Is the evil robber really evil?
All these questions are answered
by the large and energetic cast in
the second act. Unfortunately, the
second time around the pace is
neither as spirited, nor is the focus
as clear as in the first act.
The play was originally a
one-act drama, performed at
Stanford in 1965. But according
to Director Alan Mokler, who
directed and co-authored the
expanded version of Cry, Wolf!,
"The play simply cried to be
expanded. It was funny and
powerful, and audiences wanted
more than a one-act."
This might have been the case
in 1965, but in the eight
intervening years, the play seemed

to gain little in clarity or force
from the addition.
Fun-Loving Crew
The large cast acquitted
themselves with distinction in the
first act, which was basically the
comedic part of the production.
Headed by David DelValle as
Spalazoni, the leader of the
fun-loving set, the entire cast
seemed to really enjoy the
comedy, singing, dancing, and
drinking that enlivened the first
act.
Jon Berger, as an addled St.
Francis, also came across well,
even though he had trouble
keeping his halo on. (It was finally
abandoned half-way through the
Play.)
Spalazoni and Francis delivered
most of the comedic lines with
perfect timing and voice, as well
as a natural feel for whai the
audience would find humorous.
They danced, sang, and pranced
through most of the first act with
effortless enthusiasm.
Seriousness Marks Second Act
After a strenuous intermission,
with the cast dancing on stage
through most of the ten minutes
the serious part of the play began.
Perhaps the All Fools aspects were
too strong on Friday the 13th for
seriousness to overcome. More
realistically, the heavier topics of
justice, revenge, and superstition
dealt with in the second act are
more difficult for actors to
project.
The knowledgeable and
conniving Grazi, as portrayed by
Bill Ontiveros, has a major role in

the second act's actual and
metaphysical proceedings. He is
suitably stern and stentorian, but
not very moving, in his role as the
inquistor getting to the bottom of
the Wolf's alleged miracles.
The Wolf, more a presence
than a role, is played with a
Clint-Eastwoodish flair for the
strong and silent by Kelly
DuPont. The major female role
belongs to Betty James as the
Starling, a sort of 13th century
strumpet who has suffered and
forborne much.
Many others in the cast and on
the production staff should be
commended for their parts in this
difficult production setting.
Costumes and orchestra all added
a bit of atmosphere to the overall
effect.
With a little more polish in
delivery, which would make such
lines as "Godcomes like a wolf to
bite our hearts," more palatable
and less affected, Cry Wolf! could
succeed in both acts.
The Workshop's first Firecircle
Festival presentation of the
summer will continue at 8:45
p.m. for three more days, July
19-21. Also scheduled for
presentation this summer are
three other productions.
Odd Bodkins, a musical version
of Dan O'Neill's comic strip book,
will open July 27. An Italian
Straw Hat, a French farce, will
open August 10, and
Shakespeare's As You Like It will
close the season during the
weekends of August 25 and
September 1.
