# Leon Russell Meets Freddie King
## Blues And Rock Don't Mix 
### 
Freddie King — "Woman Across
The River" (Shelter 8919)
Jimmy Rogers — "Gold Tailed
Bird" (Shelter 8921)
"Woman Across The River" is
blues-guitarist Freddie King's
third album on Shelter Records.
None of the three are any match
for his early sides on King, or his
two Cotillion LPs.
The decline in quality can be
attributed, not to Mr. King, but to
Leon Russell who produced all
three albums. Russell also plays
piano on the LPs, along with such
rock stars as Carl Radle (bass),
Jim Keltner (drums), Don Preston
(guitar), and Chuck Biackwell
(drums).
It's good to see Freddie coming
out with LPs regularly, and finally
making some money, but if
Russell really wanted to do him
justice, he'd put him in a studio
with four or five competent blues
men and just let him play the
blues.
The three slow blues numbers
included in "Woman Across The

River" could have done without
the added strings. "Trouble In
Mind" also suffers from
unnecessary background vocals, as
does Jimmy Reed's up-tempo
"You Don't Have To Go."
The only cut with any of the
drive and feeling of King's early
recordings is Muddy Waters' "I'm
Ready," written by Willie Dixon.
Dixon also wrote "Hootchie
Cootchie Man," although this LP
gives credit to C. Long, whoever
that is.
As always, King's distinctive,
screeching guitar is beautifully
simple, yet forceful.
A much better blues LP on
Shelter is Jimmy Rogers' "Gold
Tailed Bird."
Rogers was rhythm guitarist
and vocalist with Muddy Waters'
powerful band during the fifties,
and to the best of my knowledge
this is his first recording since
coming out of retirement. (Chess
Records has reissued an entire LP,
"Chicago Bound," made up of
Rogers' fifties sides with Muddy,

on their Vintage Series.)
Unlike Freddie King's Shelter
LPs, Rogers is backed by veteran
blues musicians from Chicago;
Fred Below (drums), Dave Meyer
(bass), Louis Meyer (harp and
guitar), and Bob Reed (piano).
Rogers sings and plays rhythm
guitar, and Freddie King plays
lead on some cuts. (Rogers and
King co-produced the album
themselves, along with J.J. Cale.)
The difference between the
Rogers-King LP and the
King-Russell attempts is
immediately noticeable. No
strings are to be found here, just
solid, unadulterated Chicago
blues. The entire record is marked
by its consistency; every cut is as
good as the one before it.
Ten of the twelve songs on
"Gold-Tailed Bird" are Rogers
compositions, including a
recreation of his classic "That's
All Right." A fine blues album.

"Woman Across The River" is
blues-guitarist Freddie King's
third album on Shelter Records.
None of the three are any match
for his early sides on King, or his
two Cotillion LPs.
The decline in quality can be
attributed, not to Mr. King, but to
Leon Russell who produced all
three albums. Russell also plays
piano on the LPs, along with such
rock stars as Carl Radle (bass),
Jim Keltner (drums), Don Preston
(guitar), and Chuck Biackwell
(drums).
It's good to see Freddie coming
out with LPs regularly, and finally
making some money, but if
Russell really wanted to do him
justice, he'd put him in a studio
with four or five competent blues
men and just let him play the
blues.
The three slow blues numbers
included in "Woman Across The

River" could have done without
the added strings. "Trouble In
Mind" also suffers from
unnecessary background vocals, as
does Jimmy Reed's up-tempo
"You Don't Have To Go."
The only cut with any of the
drive and feeling of King's early
recordings is Muddy Waters' "I'm
Ready," written by Willie Dixon.
Dixon also wrote "Hootchie
Cootchie Man," although this LP
gives credit to C. Long, whoever
that is.
As always, King's distinctive,
screeching guitar is beautifully
simple, yet forceful.
A much better blues LP on
Shelter is Jimmy Rogers' "Gold
Tailed Bird."
Rogers was rhythm guitarist
and vocalist with Muddy Waters'
powerful band during the fifties,
and to the best of my knowledge
this is his first recording since
coming out of retirement. (Chess
Records has reissued an entire LP,
"Chicago Bound," made up of
Rogers' fifties sides with Muddy,

on their Vintage Series.)
Unlike Freddie King's Shelter
LPs, Rogers is backed by veteran
blues musicians from Chicago;
Fred Below (drums), Dave Meyer
(bass), Louis Meyer (harp and
guitar), and Bob Reed (piano).
Rogers sings and plays rhythm
guitar, and Freddie King plays
lead on some cuts. (Rogers and
King co-produced the album
themselves, along with J.J. Cale.)
The difference between the
Rogers-King LP and the
King-Russell attempts is
immediately noticeable. No
strings are to be found here, just
solid, unadulterated Chicago
blues. The entire record is marked
by its consistency; every cut is as
good as the one before it.
Ten of the twelve songs on
"Gold-Tailed Bird" are Rogers
compositions, including a
recreation of his classic "That's
All Right." A fine blues album.
