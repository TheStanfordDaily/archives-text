UJS. Admits Secret Bombing
WASHINGTON — The Defense Department yesterday
admitted it conducted secret bombing missions over
Cambodia prior to 1970, and falsified the reports of this
bombing because the U.S. was officially respecting
Cambodia's neutrality in the Vietnam War.
Air Force Maj. Hal Knight told a Senate committee
that he falsified reports of B-52 raids in Cambodia to
make it look as if they took place in Vietnam. After each
raid, Knight said, he was instructed to burn all paperwork.
Pentagon officials said that Gen. Creighton Abrams,
then U.S. commander in Vietnam, requested the raids.
Abrams is now Army Chief of Staff.
Mitchell Asks Dismissal Of Charges
NEW YORK — Former Atty. Gen. John Mitchell
yesterday requested that his indictments for perjury and
conspiracy in the Vesco case be dismissed. Mitchell
claimed that the Senate's Watergate hearings are making it
impossible for him to receive a fair trial.
In the motion, filed with Federal Judge Lee Gagliarsi
here, Mitchell said all potential jurors have been exposed
to prejudicial Watergate publicity.
Mitchell, who appeared before the Watergate
committee last week, is expected to ask that his trial, now
set for Sept. 11 in Manhattan, be moved to another
federal district and delayed.
Nixon Continues Improvement
WASHINGTON — President Nixon continued to show
improvement in his bout with viral pneumonia yesterday,
prompting doctors to predict he could be released from
Bethesda Naval Hospital by Thursday or Friday.
However, the doctors treating Nixon are expected to
ask the President to reduce his workload for some time
after his release to avoid relapse.
One of the doctors said that X-rays showed Nixon's
lungs had nearly totally cleared, and that his temperature
has been near normal for 36 hours.
Phase Four Announcement Due
WASHINGTON — The White House has announced that
the Administration's Phase Four economic plan will be

revealed later this week.
Treasury Secretary George Shultz said yesterday he
would make the announcement since President Nixon
cannot do so due to his illness. Shultz indicated that a few
details have yet to be settled upon.
Police End Prison Riot
POWHATEN, Va. — State police yesterday quelled a
12-hour prison rebellion at a Virginia prison farm near
here.
Police used tear gas and dogs to clear two cellblocks
held by inmates and then persuaded the rest of the 400
prisoners involved to surrender a third block.
The disturbance apparently began Sunday night after
two inmates were put in isolation cells for fighting with a
guard Saturday.
Rabies Epidemic Spreading
SAN JOSE — A Santa Clara County health official
yesterday reported that the county is experiencing the
worst rabies epidemic in history.
Dr. Mary Clark said that the disease has never been as
widespread among wild animals as it is this year. She
added that there have been 26 rabid bats and five rabid
skunks confirmed in the county this year.
Mullin Trial Continues In Secret
SANTA CRUZ — Secret jury sessions continued yesterday
at the trial of Herbert Mullin, accused of 10 murders.
Judge Charles Franich is proceeding even though State
Atty. Gen. Evelle Younger has appealed to the California
Supreme Court to rule on whether the closed-door
sessions are legal.
Younger favors open proceedings, but Franich ordered
jury selection to take place in private, away from news
reporters. Franich did so so that frank responses from
prospective jurors could be obtained.
Fair Through Today
Continued fair weather expected at least through
Wednesday except for low cloudiness in the nights and
mornings. Highs will be in the 70s to low 80s, with lows in
the 50s.

Mitchell Asks Dismissal Of Charges
NEW YORK — Former Atty. Gen. John Mitchell
yesterday requested that his indictments for perjury and
conspiracy in the Vesco case be dismissed. Mitchell
claimed that the Senate's Watergate hearings are making it
impossible for him to receive a fair trial.
In the motion, filed with Federal Judge Lee Gagliarsi
here, Mitchell said all potential jurors have been exposed
to prejudicial Watergate publicity.
Mitchell, who appeared before the Watergate
committee last week, is expected to ask that his trial, now
set for Sept. 11 in Manhattan, be moved to another
federal district and delayed.
Nixon Continues Improvement
WASHINGTON — President Nixon continued to show
improvement in his bout with viral pneumonia yesterday,
prompting doctors to predict he could be released from
Bethesda Naval Hospital by Thursday or Friday.
However, the doctors treating Nixon are expected to
ask the President to reduce his workload for some time
after his release to avoid relapse.
One of the doctors said that X-rays showed Nixon's
lungs had nearly totally cleared, and that his temperature
has been near normal for 36 hours.
Phase Four Announcement Due
WASHINGTON — The White House has announced that
the Administration's Phase Four economic plan will be

revealed later this week.
Treasury Secretary George Shultz said yesterday he
would make the announcement since President Nixon
cannot do so due to his illness. Shultz indicated that a few
details have yet to be settled upon.
Police End Prison Riot
POWHATEN, Va. — State police yesterday quelled a
12-hour prison rebellion at a Virginia prison farm near
here.
Police used tear gas and dogs to clear two cellblocks
held by inmates and then persuaded the rest of the 400
prisoners involved to surrender a third block.
The disturbance apparently began Sunday night after
two inmates were put in isolation cells for fighting with a
guard Saturday.
Rabies Epidemic Spreading
SAN JOSE — A Santa Clara County health official
yesterday reported that the county is experiencing the
worst rabies epidemic in history.
Dr. Mary Clark said that the disease has never been as
widespread among wild animals as it is this year. She
added that there have been 26 rabid bats and five rabid
skunks confirmed in the county this year.
Mullin Trial Continues In Secret
SANTA CRUZ — Secret jury sessions continued yesterday
at the trial of Herbert Mullin, accused of 10 murders.
Judge Charles Franich is proceeding even though State
Atty. Gen. Evelle Younger has appealed to the California
Supreme Court to rule on whether the closed-door
sessions are legal.
Younger favors open proceedings, but Franich ordered
jury selection to take place in private, away from news
reporters. Franich did so so that frank responses from
prospective jurors could be obtained.
Fair Through Today
Continued fair weather expected at least through
Wednesday except for low cloudiness in the nights and
mornings. Highs will be in the 70s to low 80s, with lows in
the 50s.
UJS. Admits Secret Bombing
WASHINGTON — The Defense Department yesterday
admitted it conducted secret bombing missions over
Cambodia prior to 1970, and falsified the reports of this
bombing because the U.S. was officially respecting
Cambodia's neutrality in the Vietnam War.
Air Force Maj. Hal Knight told a Senate committee
that he falsified reports of B-52 raids in Cambodia to
make it look as if they took place in Vietnam. After each
raid, Knight said, he was instructed to burn all paperwork.
Pentagon officials said that Gen. Creighton Abrams,
then U.S. commander in Vietnam, requested the raids.
Abrams is now Army Chief of Staff.
