In Friday's Daily,
University Vice President
Robert Augsburger was
quoted saying that the
problem of secrecy may have
been "an implicit reason"
why no city councilmen we**;
present at a meeting
discussing the proposed

Augsburger was actually

councilmen on the committee
itself, not at the exploratory
meeting.
