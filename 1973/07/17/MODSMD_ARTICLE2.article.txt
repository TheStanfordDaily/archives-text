# Employees Here Among Founders
## Sam Ervin Fan Club Grows 
### DEBBIE SEAMAN 
"It started out to be half-fun and
half-serious, but it's getting to be more
and more serious," said Dave Oke, one
of the nine "founding fathers" of the
National Sam Ervin Fan Club.
Oke, an employee in the General
Secretary's Office (GSO) here, said
that the club was an idea of his friend
Rob Caughlan, 30, of San Mateo.
Caughlan is now the official
spokesman for the fan club.
Prompted by a form letter response
to a letter he had written to Sen. Sam
J. Ervin Jr. (D—N.C.), Caughlan
enlisted the help of eight friends from
the Bay Area to start the club. Among
the eight were Oke and Betsy Adler,
who also works in the GSO.
The club hails Ervin, 76 year-old
chairman of the Senate Watergate
Committee, as "a man who embodies
the spirit of our founding fathers, who
qualifies as a genuine folk hero, who
makes you want to pledge allegiance
to the flag and really mean it."

Membership cards are free, and
members can purchase "Uncle Sam"
buttons, T-shirts, and posters.
'Genuine Concern'
The club is multi-partisan, the only
bond among its members being "a
genuine concern for the future of
America."
Caughlan, dressed in red, white, and
blue, announced the formation of the
club at a press conference July 3.
"It just mushroomed from there,"
said Oke. "It's like we keyed in on
something that was there. It was a
feeling, and we were in the right place
at the right time, and it got going."
In less than two weeks the club's
membership has reached 4000 and is
still growing.
Prominent members include Sens.
Hubert Humphrey (D—Minn.), Jacob
Javits (R—N.Y.), Edward Kennedy
(D—Mass.), Lowell P. Weicker Jr.
(R—Conn.), and Howard Baker Jr.
(R—Tenn.), plus all the guards in the
Senate building, according to Oke.

Oke and Caughlan went to
Washington last week to "get some
more PR, to meet the Senator, and to
see what people think."
Oke described the trip as "an
amazing time." The two attended the
Watergate hearings, met and spoke
with Ervin and his staff, and received
vast press coverage for the club.
"What we accomplished was finding
out that most of the people on Capitol
Hill except the White House and White
House-oriented staff are really in tune
with what we are doing."
Precious Possession
One of the high points of the trip,
said Oke, was receiving a copy of the
U.S. Constitution on which Ervin had
inscribed "The United States
Constitution is America's most
precious possession" and signed his
name.
"He carries a copy around with him
all the time," says Oke with
admiration.
However, Oke said the founders of
the fan club do not necessarily agree
with every stand that Ervin has taken
in nearly two decades as a senator.
"What he [Ervin] represents in
terms of Watergate is going against a
group of politicians who are being
sleazy, back-room, morally corrupt
doing-our-jobbers running the
government and ripping people off."
"I think that's what stand we
represent to the people who are
responding to the fan club so heavily,"
Oke said.
To keep from being "rip-off
agents" themselves, the club's
organizers have decided that any
profits will go to social improvement
organizations such as Common Cause
and the American Civil Liberties
Union. Ervin has reportedly endorsed
both organizations.
Oke said that Ervin "doesn't really
understand what all the attention's
about right now because he's been
doing the same thing he always has,
which is basically representing
integrity in government — more than
any other man I've known in my study
of politics."
The titular head of the Ervin fan
club, Garth D. Bockams, is a fictitious
character. Oke remarked that when
the press asked who Bockams was,
members said, "Well, he was our
president but we impeached him and
are getting along fine without him."

"a genuine folk hero."
"It started out to be half-fun and
half-serious, but it's getting to be more
and more serious," said Dave Oke, one
of the nine "founding fathers" of the
National Sam Ervin Fan Club.
Oke, an employee in the General
Secretary's Office (GSO) here, said
that the club was an idea of his friend
Rob Caughlan, 30, of San Mateo.
Caughlan is now the official
spokesman for the fan club.
Prompted by a form letter response
to a letter he had written to Sen. Sam
J. Ervin Jr. (D—N.C.), Caughlan
enlisted the help of eight friends from
the Bay Area to start the club. Among
the eight were Oke and Betsy Adler,
who also works in the GSO.
The club hails Ervin, 76 year-old
chairman of the Senate Watergate
Committee, as "a man who embodies
the spirit of our founding fathers, who
qualifies as a genuine folk hero, who
makes you want to pledge allegiance
to the flag and really mean it."

Membership cards are free, and
members can purchase "Uncle Sam"
buttons, T-shirts, and posters.
'Genuine Concern'
The club is multi-partisan, the only
bond among its members being "a
genuine concern for the future of
America."
Caughlan, dressed in red, white, and
blue, announced the formation of the
club at a press conference July 3.
"It just mushroomed from there,"
said Oke. "It's like we keyed in on
something that was there. It was a
feeling, and we were in the right place
at the right time, and it got going."
In less than two weeks the club's
membership has reached 4000 and is
still growing.
Prominent members include Sens.
Hubert Humphrey (D—Minn.), Jacob
Javits (R—N.Y.), Edward Kennedy
(D—Mass.), Lowell P. Weicker Jr.
(R—Conn.), and Howard Baker Jr.
(R—Tenn.), plus all the guards in the
Senate building, according to Oke.

Oke and Caughlan went to
Washington last week to "get some
more PR, to meet the Senator, and to
see what people think."
Oke described the trip as "an
amazing time." The two attended the
Watergate hearings, met and spoke
with Ervin and his staff, and received
vast press coverage for the club.
"What we accomplished was finding
out that most of the people on Capitol
Hill except the White House and White
House-oriented staff are really in tune
with what we are doing."
Precious Possession
One of the high points of the trip,
said Oke, was receiving a copy of the
U.S. Constitution on which Ervin had
inscribed "The United States
Constitution is America's most
precious possession" and signed his
name.
"He carries a copy around with him
all the time," says Oke with
admiration.
However, Oke said the founders of
the fan club do not necessarily agree
with every stand that Ervin has taken
in nearly two decades as a senator.
"What he [Ervin] represents in
terms of Watergate is going against a
group of politicians who are being
sleazy, back-room, morally corrupt
doing-our-jobbers running the
government and ripping people off."
"I think that's what stand we
represent to the people who are
responding to the fan club so heavily,"
Oke said.
To keep from being "rip-off
agents" themselves, the club's
organizers have decided that any
profits will go to social improvement
organizations such as Common Cause
and the American Civil Liberties
Union. Ervin has reportedly endorsed
both organizations.
Oke said that Ervin "doesn't really
understand what all the attention's
about right now because he's been
doing the same thing he always has,
which is basically representing
integrity in government — more than
any other man I've known in my study
of politics."
The titular head of the Ervin fan
club, Garth D. Bockams, is a fictitious
character. Oke remarked that when
the press asked who Bockams was,
members said, "Well, he was our
president but we impeached him and
are getting along fine without him."
