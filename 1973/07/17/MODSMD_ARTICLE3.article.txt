# PA Planner Outlines New Traffic Designs

### KATHERINE RAMBO 
Chief Palo Alto Traffic Engineer
Ted Noguchi last week detailed plans
to alter traffic flow around Escondido
Village and College Terrace to alleviate
serious traffic congestion problems in
the College Terrace residential area.
Around 50 people, including
College Terrace residents, members of
student and faculty housing areas, and
representatives of the University
Planning Office and the California
Avenue Merchants Association
attended the meeting, held at the
College Terrace branch of the public
library.
College Terrace itself is a small
residential community which is largely
surrounded by University land, but
within Palo Alto city limits. The area
is composed of many single-family
homes, small apartments, a few larger
apartment complexes, and a variety of
small businesses near El Camino Real.
The University is responsible for
the adjoining Escondido Village land.
However, most of the traffic comes into
the area via Stanford Avenue, which
parallels the terrace and is under Santa
Clara County's jurisdiction.
Strained Relations
Relations between College Terrace
residents and the University have
become more strained in recent years
by the development of two adjacent
university residential areas, Pine Hill

and Frenchman's Hill.
Nearby College Terrace residents
actively opposed these developments.
More recently, there have been
vehement protests against plans to
further develop adjacent university
land as moderate- and low-income
housing.
Some residents see this
development as a further contribution
to an already badly congested traffic
situation.
Three-way discussions involving
College Terrace residents, the city
council and the University have been
in progress for some time. These
discussions intensified in recent
months after the council authorized a
detailed study of the nature and
distribution of College Terrace traffic.
'Indeed A Problem'
In his opening remarks, Noguchi
observed that while plans for the
low-cost housing have been
indefinitely postponed, the study
results showed that "there was indeed
a problem."
Charts made available for
inspection showed traffic for the area
as high as 25,000 cars per day.
Traffic is especially heavy on
Stanford Avenue, California Avenue
and Hanover Street in the cross-traffic
direction.
