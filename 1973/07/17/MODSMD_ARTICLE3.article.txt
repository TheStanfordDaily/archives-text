# PA Planner Outlines New Traffic Designs
## 
### KATHERINE RAMBO 
Chief Palo Alto Traffic Engineer
Ted Noguchi last week detailed plans
to alter traffic flow around Escondido
Village and College Terrace to alleviate
serious traffic congestion problems in
the College Terrace residential area.
Around 50 people, including
College Terrace residents, members of
student and faculty housing areas, and
representatives of the University
Planning Office and the California
Avenue Merchants Association
attended the meeting, held at the
College Terrace branch of the public
library.
College Terrace itself is a small
residential community which is largely
surrounded by University land, but
within Palo Alto city limits. The area
is composed of many single-family
homes, small apartments, a few larger
apartment complexes, and a variety of
small businesses near El Camino Real.
The University is responsible for
the adjoining Escondido Village land.
However, most of the traffic comes into
the area via Stanford Avenue, which
parallels the terrace and is under Santa
Clara County's jurisdiction.
Strained Relations
Relations between College Terrace
residents and the University have
become more strained in recent years
by the development of two adjacent
university residential areas, Pine Hill

and Frenchman's Hill.
Nearby College Terrace residents
actively opposed these developments.
More recently, there have been
vehement protests against plans to
further develop adjacent university
land as moderate- and low-income
housing.
Some residents see this
development as a further contribution
to an already badly congested traffic
situation.
Three-way discussions involving
College Terrace residents, the city
council and the University have been
in progress for some time. These
discussions intensified in recent
months after the council authorized a
detailed study of the nature and
distribution of College Terrace traffic.
'Indeed A Problem'
In his opening remarks, Noguchi
observed that while plans for the
low-cost housing have been
indefinitely postponed, the study
results showed that "there was indeed
a problem."
Charts made available for
inspection showed traffic for the area
as high as 25,000 cars per day.
Traffic is especially heavy on
Stanford Avenue, California Avenue
and Hanover Street in the cross-traffic
direction.
City planners developed nine
alternative proposals to alleviate traffic
problems. Two of these survived staff
examination.
Barriers
Each plan calls for building physical
barriers, amounting to full street
closures in some cases, to force a
re-routing of traffic through College
Terrace.
Major changes would be made along
Stanford Avenue at the Bowdoin and
Yale intersection, and one entrance to
Escondido Village would be closed.
Hopefully, this would prove so
inconvenient to non-residents that
they would take alternate routes,
possibly Page Mill Road for east-west

travel and El Camino Real for
north-south travel.
One plan — number six — calls for
the city to erect the barricades.
Noguchi expressed hope that the
University would also cooperate by
sealing off a portion of Escondido — a
primary access route to the University
from Stanford Avenue.
The major advantage of the plan is
that the cost will be minimal. The
barricades could be erected in the
form of low asphalt walls which could
easily be removed if the plan proved
unsuccessful.
Not Perfect
Noguchi expressed a preference for

plan six, although he acknowledged
that "it was not the perfect solution"
and that no such remedy exists. But
concluded his staff, both plans were
worthy of further consideration by the
residents and the city council.
According to Noguchi, the City
Planning Group will present plan six to
the city council during the first week
of August, recommending that it be
implemented on a three- to six-month
trial basis.
Noguchi will resubmit plan five if
plan six is unsuccessful in relieving
traffic congestion during the trial
period.
Oscar Nelson, master planner in the
University's Planning Office, explained
that he could offer no formal
University response since the plans had
just recently been made available to
the University. However, he added
that closing Escondido Road was
agreeable with long-range University
plans.

student and faculty housing areas, and
representatives of the University
Planning Office and the California
Avenue Merchants Association
attended the meeting, held at the
College Terrace branch of the public
library.
College Terrace itself is a small
residential community which is largely
surrounded by University land, but
within Palo Alto city limits. The area
is composed of many single-family
homes, small apartments, a few larger
apartment complexes, and a variety of
small businesses near El Camino Real.
The University is responsible for
the adjoining Escondido Village land.
However, most of the traffic comes into
the area via Stanford Avenue, which
parallels the terrace and is under Santa
Clara County's jurisdiction.
Strained Relations
Relations between College Terrace
residents and the University have
become more strained in recent years
by the development of two adjacent
university residential areas, Pine Hill

and Frenchman's Hill.
Nearby College Terrace residents
actively opposed these developments.
More recently, there have been
vehement protests against plans to
further develop adjacent university
land as moderate- and low-income
housing.
Some residents see this
development as a further contribution
to an already badly congested traffic
situation.
Three-way discussions involving
College Terrace residents, the city
council and the University have been
in progress for some time. These
discussions intensified in recent
months after the council authorized a
detailed study of the nature and
distribution of College Terrace traffic.
'Indeed A Problem'
In his opening remarks, Noguchi
observed that while plans for the
low-cost housing have been
indefinitely postponed, the study
results showed that "there was indeed
a problem."
Charts made available for
inspection showed traffic for the area
as high as 25,000 cars per day.
Traffic is especially heavy on
Stanford Avenue, California Avenue
and Hanover Street in the cross-traffic
direction.
City planners developed nine
alternative proposals to alleviate traffic
problems. Two of these survived staff
examination.
Barriers
Each plan calls for building physical
barriers, amounting to full street
closures in some cases, to force a
re-routing of traffic through College
Terrace.
Major changes would be made along
Stanford Avenue at the Bowdoin and
Yale intersection, and one entrance to
Escondido Village would be closed.
Hopefully, this would prove so
inconvenient to non-residents that
they would take alternate routes,
possibly Page Mill Road for east-west

travel and El Camino Real for
north-south travel.
One plan — number six — calls for
the city to erect the barricades.
Noguchi expressed hope that the
University would also cooperate by
sealing off a portion of Escondido — a
primary access route to the University
from Stanford Avenue.
The major advantage of the plan is
that the cost will be minimal. The
barricades could be erected in the
form of low asphalt walls which could
easily be removed if the plan proved
unsuccessful.
Not Perfect
Noguchi expressed a preference for

plan six, although he acknowledged
that "it was not the perfect solution"
and that no such remedy exists. But
concluded his staff, both plans were
worthy of further consideration by the
residents and the city council.
According to Noguchi, the City
Planning Group will present plan six to
the city council during the first week
of August, recommending that it be
implemented on a three- to six-month
trial basis.
Noguchi will resubmit plan five if
plan six is unsuccessful in relieving
traffic congestion during the trial
period.
Oscar Nelson, master planner in the
University's Planning Office, explained
that he could offer no formal
University response since the plans had
just recently been made available to
the University. However, he added
that closing Escondido Road was
agreeable with long-range University
plans.
Chief Palo Alto Traffic Engineer
Ted Noguchi last week detailed plans
to alter traffic flow around Escondido
Village and College Terrace to alleviate
serious traffic congestion problems in
the College Terrace residential area.
Around 50 people, including
College Terrace residents, members of
student and faculty housing areas, and
representatives of the University
Planning Office and the California
Avenue Merchants Association
attended the meeting, held at the

library.
