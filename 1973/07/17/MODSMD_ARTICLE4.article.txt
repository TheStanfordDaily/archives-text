# Prof Says Situation Critical For Energy
## 
### GLENN ZORN 
"The next few years will be critical
ones for the energy crisis," predicts
Earth Sciences Emeritus Prof. Charles
Park.
Park, a nationally-known expert on
natural energy, has researched the
"energy crisis" for 25 years and
claims, "I have been preaching the
coming shortage all along."
He does not blame the U.S. oil
companies for the shortage. He admits
that "oil companies are in business to
make money," but there is "no

connection between the oil companies'
wanting to raise prices and a
conspiracy to cut off gas."
Park sees three definite causes for
the nation's energy problems: the
absence of national guidelines on
energy, the shortage of large refineries
to produce the needed oil products
and U.S. reliance on foreign oil.
Policy Lacking
The government lacks both "a
definite policy" on energy, and
enough programs supporting energy
research, Park believes.
He cites as an example of
government confusion two
publications with conflicting reports
about the "energy crisis."
One, from the Federal Trade
Commission blames the oil companies
for the shortage; the second, from the
Federal Power Commission, claims the
shortage is real, not the fault of the oil
companies.
However, Park points to the new
cabinet-level energy commission
headed by Colorado Gov. John Love
as a national step toward coping with
the problem.
Blames Environmentalists
Park blames environmental groups
for shortages of fuel and the lack of
refineries. He claims that pressures
from ecologists discourage oil refinery
construction, often because the
refineries pollute the surrounding air
and water.
"The new types of clean-air devices
on automobiles intensify the [energy]
problem," Park adds, because cars
require more gasoline for the same
power.
The professor faults
environmentalists because they make
it appear "there is a crash emergency,
which there is not."
Standard of Living
"I want a clean environment like
everybody else," he says. But man is
"not divorced from that environment,
and we owe it to our fellow man to
give him the highest standard of living
possible."
As for foreign oil, Park contends
that the lack of refinery capacity and
the higher import prices will force the
price of gasoline to triple.

REAL SHORTAGEâ€”Earth Sciences Emeritus Prof. Charles Park, who has
watched the energy situation for 25 years, states that the "energy crisis" is real,
that oil companies are not in collusion to raise gas prices. Park advocates the
immediate construction of an Alaskan pipeline to mitigate the energy problem.
At present, most of our fuel oil
comes from Venezuela, according to
Park. This supply will "only be
adequate for another 10 years," then
we will have to go to Arabia or the
Middle East."
Park sees excessive foreign control
of American business and decline of
the American standard of living as
results of "buying more oil than we
can pay for."
Alaska Pipeline
He advocates the immediate
construction of an Alaskan pipeline as
a partial solution to the oil shortage.
The pipeline "has been looked at,
inside and out," he says, and senators
are now only debating where to put it.
Park mentions the use of other
forms of energy such as coal, natural
gas and uranium as future solutions to
the "energy crisis." The problem with
these forms of energy is the "time lag

before they are developed or
produced," according to Park.
Coal has been objectionable as an
energy source because it contains
sulfur, which pollutes the air.
Development of great quantities of
low-sulfur coal proceeds at a slow
pace.
Natural Gas
Natural gas is "our cleanest form of
energy." In the past it wasn't
profitable to look for it because of its
low price, but since the energy
shortage began, the United States has
been seeking new reserves, he says.
According to Park, uranium is the
"hope for the future, but it is also
involved in public fear because of
leakage and waste disposal."
Breeder-reactors, which use an
isotope of uranium to produce energy,
are still in the developmental stages,
but they, too, might be used for power
in the future.
