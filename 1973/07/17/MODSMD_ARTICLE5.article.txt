# Antiwar Forces Seeking To Ensure Bombing Cutoff

WASHINGTON—With at least a month still to
go in the bombing of Cambodia, antiwar
forces in Congress are already casting about
for a strategy to make sure the Aug. 15 cutoff
date is an effective one.
They are coming up pretty much at a loss.
For one thing, few House and Senate doves
had foreseen the Administration's immediate
escalation of the bombing last week. The
Pentagon's denials of any real step-up are
almost universally scoffed at on Capitol Hill,
and antiwar legislators are bitter.
President Nixon's intention to seek
authorization for the war after Aug. 15 is
expected, Congressional sources said. But
Defense Secretary James R. Schlesinger's
announcement last week that a request for
extended bombing authority will depend
largely on how close a ceasefire looks — and

that "one is not inclined toward undue
optimism" on that count — was seen as
surprisingly blunt.
Discomfort
But another reason for the liberals'
discomfort is the nature of the June 29
compromise itself.
Fresh from their victory in attaching a
bombing prohibition to the continuing
appropriations bill, antiwar leaders in
Congress were first rebuffed by the House's
expected failure to override the ensuing
Presidential veto. Then came Nixon's offer of
a compromise. The liberals eyed it, and split
right down the middle.
Such critics of the Indochina war as Sens.
George McGovern (D—S.D.) and Frank
Church (D—ldaho) and Congressman Paul
McCloskey (R—Menlo Park) found themselves
allied with Sens. John Tower (R—Tex.) and
James Eastland (D—Miss.), and opposed by
Sens. Thomas Eagleton (D—Mo.), Edward

Kennedy (D—Mass.), and majority leader Mike
Mansfield (D—Mont.).
The non-compromisers argued that
acceptance of the White House's proffered
Aug. 15 cutoff would effectively legitimize
the bombing to that date. Mansfield called the
vote "capitulation and abdication;" Kennedy
denounced it as an "infamy."
Continue Eombing
The compromisers said a definite date was
better than none — and that if the Nixon
proposal was rejected, the President would
continue the bombing regardless of
Congressional action. That was, in effect, a
more-than-tacit admission that the Congress
has virtually no control over matters of war
and peace.
"No resolution," said Sen. J. William
Fulbright (D—Ark.), "would be effective if
the President is determined to resume the
bombing. ... As long as the military forces
will follow his orders, he can do these things."

Protested Sen. Birch Bayh (D—lnd.): "This
is not a compromise — it is one more
abdication by Congress of its constitutional
responsibilities. It gives the President exactly
what he has asked for as regards the date for
the cutoff, and in doing so it puts Congress'
seal of approval on any military action he may
choose to take until Aug. 15."
Bayh said the measure will "be seen as a
blank check to Mr. Nixon for pursuit of his
war policies ... another Gulf of Tonkin."
McGovern Strategy
McGovern proposed that the Senate both
approve the Aug. 15 compromise and attach
amendment requiring an immediate bombing
halt to all subsequent legislation. Despite
McGovern's contention that his proposal
represented "the best of both worlds," the
strategy attracted little attention.
So Congress is left with an Aug. 15 cutoff
date that President Nixon apparently regards
as flexible — and the recognition that there is

little Congress can do.
A constitutional crisis has been avoided,
but Congress has been forced in the process to
confront its own impotence. It has not been a
pleasant experience.
Worst of all, it looks as if the whole
question will resurrect itself, not too
miraculously, in about a month. Congress
hopes, as usual, to take a summer recess in
August.
At the same time, it seems unlikely that
President Nixon, if he asks for continued
bombing authority, will ask it much before he
needs it — by which time the House and
Senate could conceivably have dissolved.
That sticky point, like all the others, is
being deferred in hope that it will go away.
For all the House and Senate doves can do
now is to hope a Cambodia agreement is
somehow forged before Aug. 15 confronts
them.
