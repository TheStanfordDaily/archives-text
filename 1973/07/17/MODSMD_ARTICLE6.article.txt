# PR Tool For Russia
## Wheat Deal's Cost

'John Rarick

Some of the U.S. wheat we so
generously "sold" to the Russians,
subsidized at great expense by the
American consumer-taxpayer,
may now be used as a public
relations tool to build goodwill
for the Soviets in Bangladesh.
Officials of the Dacca
government are reported to have
requested that the Russians
reroute to its country some
200,000 tons of the U.S. wheat
leaving the port of Houston. The
Soviets would in turn be paid
back from stocks of wheat the
Bengalis will receive later this year
free under the U.S. Food for
Peace program — P.L. 480.
The reason given for
Bangladesh seeking wheat from
the Soviets, rather than directly
from the U.S., is that the sale of
wheat to the Russians last year so
depleted U.S. stocks that we are

presently unable to meet such a
handout request.
The American taxpayer is
being exploited by being forced to
pay higher food prices at home as
a result of international grain
manipulation, while the Soviet
Union used our money and food
to polish its PR image with the
underdeveloped countries.
The American taxpayer can
undoubtedly expect to learn of
more wheat surfacing in
international markets from
"exports" by the Soviets in the
future. In May, reports from
.Europe told of the Soviet Union
reselling butter purchased from
the Common Market to Chile.
Since the butter was "bought"
under heavily subsidized
arrangements, as was our wheat,
the Russians realized a nice profit
on the resale.
