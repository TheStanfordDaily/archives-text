TV's Effect
Editor:
A letter to the editor by
Messrs. Evers and Kershner in the
July 13 Daily criticized Prof.
Alberta Siegel for proposing
measures to reduce the level of
violence on television (Daily, July
10). Evers and Kershner found
violence to be "engrossing
entertainment."
Their view of an alternative to
violent programming was
extremely limited; they resented
the idea "of just endlessly
watching Miss Goody
Two-Shoes," assuming that is the
only alternative to violent
programming.
Although I do not agree with
Evers and Kershner regarding the
entertainment value of violence, I
join them in criticizing Prof.
Siegel's basic reasoning for
suggesting that television
programming be controlled.
Prof. Siegel claims that the
reason 10.6 percent of this year's
freshman class chose the health
professions as their goal,
compared with 5.3 percent in
1966 "is partly due to the time
the freshman class spent in the
company of Marcus Welby M.D."
I think this reasoning is very
tenuous. For example, crime and
crime detection have many more
hours devoted to their
glorification than the health
profession, yet there has not been
a corresponding rise in the
proportion of people choosing

murder or police work as their
career goal.
Yet, according to Prof. Siegel's
reasoning, the influence of
television watching would be
expected to have this effect.
Neither have an increasing
proportion of people chosen
poverty or movie-stardom as their

goal, although television gives an
image of these life-styles which is
at least as distorted as the
television image of the health
profession.
Indeed, the absence of a rise in
the proportion of people choosing
these goals may be taken as
evidence of the lack of effect that
television viewing has on its
audience. However, this is not an
argument against improving the
quality of television programming.
Prof. Siegel's theory is enticing,
but it does not explain why

increasing numbers of young
people are choosing the health
profession as their career goal.

Real Shock ley Issue
Editor:
In view of what has been
written and NOT written about
Shockley, I submit these
comments. In their rejection of
Shockley's course, neither
SWOPSI nor the subcommittee
which investigated SWOPSI's
rejection seemed to deal with the
real issue, namely that Shockley is

trying to use this campus to
perpetuate the most blatant forms
of racism.
Now, consider this: suppose
someone with Shockley's stature
starts doing research on the
genetic neurological abnormalities
of Jews.
Screams of "anti-semitism"
and "neo nazism" would probably
ring all over this land. The issue
would no longer be one of
Academic Freedom. . . . Why is it
different with Shockley?
