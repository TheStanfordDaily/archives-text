# Trustee Gave Money To Kalmbach
## 
### 
University trustee Thomas V. Jones
gave $75,000 that was used as support
money for the seven Watergate
defendants, Herbert W. Kalmbach told
the Senate Watergate Committee this
week.
In a statement issued from his
Beverly Hills office, Jones — president
and chairman of the board of the
Northrop Corp. — said he gave only
$50,000 and denied he knew what the
money would be used for.
In his testimony, Kalmbach said he
told Jones that the money would be
used for a "special assignment" for
"one in authority at the White
House."
Kalmbach said he received the
money and transferred it to Watergate
figure Anthony Ulasewicz in Newport
Beach, Calif, in July, 1972.
Jones was unavailable for comment
yesterday, but a company spokesman
read the prepared statement.
Jones said the contribution was "a
personal one, made with my own
funds ... as I told the GAO [General
Accounting Office] last May, I gave
$50,000." The money was given to
Kalmbach, then the President's
personal attorney, in cash.
"I had every reason to believe that
the money would be used for the
Nixon campaign," Jones said, adding
that he believed the donation was
"proper and legal."
"If I had not believed that, I would
not have given it,"he stated.
The spokesman said he was not
authorized to answer any questions
about the statement, including
whether Jones had demanded that the
contribution be returned.
Jones became president of
Northrop, a defense contract firm, in
1960, and chairman three years later.
He has been a Stanford trustee since
1968, and has also served as a trustee
for the California Institute of
Technology.
