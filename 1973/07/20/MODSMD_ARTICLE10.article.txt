# Andrea Burt Harassed
## Women's Jails Oppressive 
### 
On June 25, Andrea Holman
Burt celebrated her 19th birthday
in court, facing charges, along
with her husband Doug, stemming
from Ron Beaty's escape from
Chino Prison.
She and Doug have been in
maximum-security cells of the San
Bernardino County Jail since
October — denied bail even
though they gave themselves up
after a warrant for their arrest had
been issued.
Two other "Chino
Defendants" facing similar
charges, Jean Hobson and Bob
Seabock, have been in the same
jail since December. Their trial is
set for Sept. 17.
Also in jail for refusing to
testify before the Grand Jury
about the Chino Case are Milt and
Laura Taulbee. Not only have the
Taulbee's not been accused of a
crime, but they will remain
behind bars for the duration of
the Grand Jury.
Half Legally Innocent
This is not an unusual
situation. Due to sky-high bails
and no-bail rulings, over half the
inmates in California jails are
legally innocent. In 1969, at any
one time, 12,929 people were in
jail waiting trial or arraignment.
After an average wait of two
months, less than 28 percent are
convicted — and most of those
plead guilty. Only 5 percent ever
go to prison. (S.F. Chronicle,
12/6/71)
Although state law holds that
defendants are subject to only as
much control as necessary to
make sure they show up in court,
in California the 'waiting period'
is more often a punishment.
This is partly due to jail
conditions. A 1970 Census Bureau
survey showed that the nation's
jails are hopelessly overcrowded
and overaged — 50 percent have
no medical facilities and 85
percent have no recreational or
educational facilities whatsoever.
(S.F. Chronicle, 1/8/71)
Punishment Atmosphere
Besides the abhorrent physical
conditions, the 'punishment
atmosphere' comes from the lack
of civil liberties and the
day-to-day harassment of all
inmates. In San Bernardino,
harassment is a fact of life.
For instance, Doug Burt took
copious notes throughout the
trial. On the day he was to testify,
his notes disappeared from his
cell. In the past, any inmate
caught talking to any of the Chino
defendants was disciplined.
When a court order said the
defendants were to receive
newspapers with two hours to
read each one, four days worth
were brought to Bob Seabock's
cell at midnight; they were to be
picked up at 8 a.m.
While the harassment may be
more blatant for these people, it is
by no means limited to
defendants in political trials.
Prisoners throughout the
California jails are denied basic
civil rights. And, as in all parts of
society, conditions are even worse
for women than for men.
Little Exercise
Although San Bernardino
County jail does have an exercise
yard, it is not used because of a
"lack of personnel." So Andrea's

sole exercise consists of the
cartwheels she does to and from
the shower. Other than that, and
the time she is in court, she is
locked in a 6' x 9' cell 24 hours a
day.
At Elmwood, in Milpitas,
women who are v/aiting trial get
two 45-minute exercise periods a
week. Their three-women cells
have just enough room for a bunk
bed and a mattress on the floor.
For reading, Andrea is allowed
only the Reader's Digest, Time
and some books from a poorly
stocked library. A court order was
necessary to get newspapers. She
was even denied books necessary
for a high school extension course
offered through the jail.
Conditions are comparable
throughout the jails.
Guidelines Subverted
In March the State Board of
Corrections issued regulations for
"Jails and other Local Detention
Facilities." These are guidelines
for cell size, visiting rights,
training of personnel, inmate
education, etc.
San Bernardino County Jail
refuses to comply because it
would cost $1,000,000 to bring
the jail up to standard. The jail is
an electronic, concrete,
windowless box, completed two
years ago at a cost to the
taxpayers of $7,000,000.
Yet its cells are too small, its
inmate education program is
"substandard" and its visiting
periods are one-half the legal
minimum. And here, too, San
Bernardino is not an isolated
situation. Jails get around court
orders by ignoring them and when
that fails, filing counter-suits or
subverting them.
Prison Movement
As conditions in prison grow
worse, the movement to fight
these conditions strengthens.
Women inmates are no longer
standing for the blatant denial of
their human rights.
In March, 1972, women at
Elmwood went on a hunger strike
and work stoppage. Their
demands included treatment equal
to that of the men at Elmwood
regarding visitation, medical care
(especially methadone treatment)
and work furlough programs.
They also demanded
gynecological care, a right that
was finally granted by the state
legislature but yet to be
implemented.
Similar strikes and work
stoppages have plagued San Bruno
County Jail during the past year.
Until the women at San Bruno
rioted, children were not even
allowed into the jail because it

was considered "too dangerous"
for them.
Another common occurrence is
the ransacking of in mates cells for
the alleged reason of looking for
drugs or other contraband. When
the matrons at San Bernardino
locked the women into the dining
room and holding cells and began
to tear apart their cells, they
offered no reason.
When they had finished the
matron ordered the inmates to
clean up the mess. No one moved.
Instead women demanded to see
the Captain. Only when they
rioted, were the matrons
reprimanded and the women not
forced to clean up the mess.
Small victories, yes. But these
women are fighting back. Those
of us on the outside must struggle
with them to end the exploitation
of prison and jail inmates.
Political Prosecutions
All of the Chino defendants
were/are actively involved in the
prison movement. Their work and
the work of countless others
outside poses a real threat to the
prison system. This is why the
movement is being attacked; this
is why the Chino defendants have
been singled out for attack.
Our fighting for the freedom of
the Chino defendants is a
substantial blow to the oppressive
prison system. We are proving that
attacks against individuals will not
destroy the movement. Instead we
are strengthened and educated
and will fight even harder.
