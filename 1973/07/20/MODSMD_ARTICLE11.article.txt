Don't Call, Write
Editor:
I would like to ask people not
to call either me or Betsy Adler at
our office extensions about the
National Sam Ervin Fan Club.
Because of the number of calls
[since the Daily article, July 17]
our ability to perform our jobs
has been impaired.
If you are interested in joining
the fan club, or inquiring further
about items available through it
send ? note to The National Sam
Ervin Fan Club, P.O. Box 2346,
Stanford, CA 94305.
Also, we are not an official or
unofficial University organization,
but a group of private citizens
who have a Stanford P.O. Box.
Thank you for your interest.
W. David Oke, Jr.
