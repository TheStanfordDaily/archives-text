# Control Of PA Child Care Program Disputed
## 
### STEVE WEINER 
University students, faculty and staff have had a
child care program for the last several years. Palo
Alto is just starting one — on a very ambitious scale.
The overall Palo Alto program will consist of five
separate programs, each dealing with one age group
or type of care. However, a political fight over
control of the program may be brewing.
Last year, the city chose 17 private citizens to
study the need for child care in Palo Alto and to
recommend a program. In April of this year, the
group, known as the Palo Alto Child Care Task
Force, presented its report.
Five Centers
The report called for the establishment of
infant-toddler centers for children younger than 2 I A
years; a pre-school center (ages 2Vi-s)\ part-time and
emergency day care centers, probably in churches;
expansion of the number of licensed day care homes
(centers in private homes), particularly for
school-age children to use before and after school;
and a sick-child care program.
The task force urged that "as a guideline, up to
20 percent of the families should pay full cost."
Thus, most of the parents using the facilities will
receive financial assistance.
Some programs will be operating this fall.
According to task force coordinator Virginia Debs, a
limited enrollment of 150 children will be divided
among several programs: 50 in part-time and
infant-toddler centers, 50 in full-day care homes,
and 50 in before- and after-school care.
Sick-child care staff training will also begin in the
fall. Debs said, "The only real hangup is the
pre-school center," which will be housed in a wing
of the College Terrace branch of the Palo Alto
public library. The library wing needs renovation.
Average Cost
Debs said that "The average cost to parents will
be between $50-100 per month," and added that
the incomes of the parents of the first children in
the program will be about $700-$ BOO per month.
The program operates on a first-come, first-serve
basis, but Debs cautioned that at the present time
"there really isn't any way to get on the waiting

list."
The program wUI receive $150,000-200,000 in
funds from Palo Alto, and $5500 from a health
manpower agency for the sick child program. An
additional $50,000-60,000 is expected from Santa
Clara County revenue-sharing funds.
Program Control
However, the issue of who will control Palo Alto
child care has not yet been settled.
Members of the task force are meeting now with
members of the city staff to work out an
institutional structure acceptable to both child care
activists and the city council.
When the city council approved the child care
program last month, it directed the city staff to
"work out a program structure between a totally
independent program and a totally city-run
program," said staff member Carleen Bedwell, the
city's chief representative in the meetings with task
force members.
The task force proposed the whole program be
run by a non-profit corporation directed by a
15-member board of directors. Eight board
members would be parents.
Parental Role
The task force also called for parental control of
the individual programs. For the program to receive
federal funds, there must be at least some such
control.
The program control issue is controversial
because some members of the council fear a
repetition of the city's experience with the Drug
Abuse Center program, which is funded by the city
yet has a large measure of operational
independence.
There have been charges of radical influence and
mismanagement in the drug program.
Activists Unhappy
However, child care activists are unhappy about
any change in the direction of greater city control
over the program.
Task force member Carol Peterson, who ran
unsuccessfully for the city council this year on the
radical PACC slate, believes that the issue of
"autonomy and decentralized control" is even more
potent than that of child care.
She says that many of the people she talked with
in her campaign were "concerned with not having
any power."
Some members of Child Care Now, an
organization active in running the private Sojourner
Truth day care center, have put out a leaflet in favor
of parental control of the programs.
Professionals, Bureaucrats
The leaflet criticizes the makeup of the task
force: "Only two out of the 17-member task force
were working parents with child care needs. The
city wants an advisory board of professionals and

bureaucrats to determine how the centers will be set
up and run."
It goes on to state that "the city is threatened by
the prospect of people controlling their own
programs... we must demand that working class
parents make up the majority of the initial advisory
boards of the centers. ...
"Parents — and only parents — have the right to
determine the kind of care their children need," it
says, and urges people to "come fight for what is
ours!" at the council meeting on the 24th.
The city staff and task force are to submit a joint
proposal on management of the program to the
Policies and Procedures Committee of the city
council by July 24.
Non-Profit Corporation
According to Bedwell, one possible arrangement
is that the non-profit corporation might subcontract
the programs, but the city would have the power to
approve the subcontracts and "write in details"
about such matters as hiring policies.
Another uncertain feature of the program is the
provision that it will be open to both parents who
live in Palo Alto and parents who work there. The
inclusion of workers depends on the participation
and financial support of at least two local industries.
But, according to Debs, "we haven't been able to
ask for specific committments" from industry yet,

because the program is not yet fully organized.
However, Philco-Ford, Syntex, Varian and
Lockheed have indicated some willingness to
consider providing support at a later date, she
indicated.
Political Issue
The "live or work" principle is a political issue.
Former city council candidate Jeffrey Youdleman,
member of local Maoist group Venceremos, said
that the program should be open to Palo Alto
workers "even if industry doesn't contribute
proportionately."
Although the University is a large employer in
the area, the city has not asked it to support Palo
Alto child care.
Debs says, "We would hope that Stanford as an
institution would provide child care for Stanford
students first."
University Vice President for Business and
Finance Robert Augsburger said that "it's highly
unlikely that the University would fund the Palo
Alto program.
The Stanford Children's Center, however, is
financially independent of the University (it is
supported by parents' fees), and could work out a
cooperative arrangement with the Palo Alto
programs if both parties agree to it, according to
Augsburger.
