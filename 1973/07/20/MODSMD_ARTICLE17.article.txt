## Watergate Hearings Bore Spectators 
### DOYLE McMANUS Analysis 
WASHINGTON â€” If you thought the
Watergate hearings could be boring on
television, try going in person.
That way, not only are you separated from
the comparative comforts of kitchen and
commode; not only are you restrained by
small pressures from leaning back and opening
a beer; not only are you somehow hesitant to
curse, ejaculate, and laugh uproariously as you
would in the privacy of your own home ...
None of these are as cruel as the crowning
piece of silliness: those who go in person can
only see the back of the witness' head.
Sometimes not even that.
Why anyone goes at all under such
circumstances is difficult to explain. But since
the Watergate hearings have infected this
already unbalanced town with an added bit of
lunacy (in a few cases, it can only be called
blood-lust), there have been no difficulties in
filling the Senate caucus room with eager

spectators.
Indeed, it has become the capital's premier
summer sport. Everyone who is anyone shows
up at one time or another. John Lennon and
Yoko Ono made it on June 27. On June 26,
Norman Mailer even stepped on my foot.
"Do you think the President did it?" a man
next to me asked Mailer, in a bit of a non
sequitur.
Mailer only smiled confusedly, confirming
my suspicion that as he would end up
writing mainly about himself anyway, he
didn't have to worry about what was actually
going on.
But in the interest of better informing the
readers of this paper, I attended the hearings
for a couple of hours of testimony. And
despite the fact that I have press credentials,
and hence the right to sit at the press table
and removed from the great unwashed, I
ventured one day into the public galleries.
Taking the pulse of the common people,

measuring the impact of these heinous
goings-on, and so forth.
I can report only that the people of
America have nearly infinite patience.
After all, the front of John Dean's head is
not the most interesting physiognomy ever to
roll. The back of his head was, if one can
imagine such a thing, even more
expressionless.
Mrs. Dean's was a little better. Best of all
was Robert McCandless, Dean's attorney,
whose head seemed to conceal a thousand
little wheels and cogs.
Once one tires of looking at the back of
the witnesses' heads, of course, one can
always look at the Senators' faces. Sam
Ervin's eyebrows flutter like hairy butterflies,
and Howard Baker is rumored to sit on a
telephone book.
But mainly it's hot, and at least twice as
boring as on television.
So you aren't missing a thing.
