# In The Color And The Noise
## Bluegrass Thrives 'Under The Stars' 
### 
OAKLAND—Country music has
become a major success in urban
areas throughout the country in
recent years. Last Sunday night,
over 1000 people gathered in
Oakland's Woodminister
Amphitheater to hear the first of
several "Bluegrass Under the
Stars" concerts.
Bluegrass is a particular style of
country music, and of all styles
has changed the least over the
years. It has roots in the folk
songs and fiddle tunes of the
British Isles, but also uses
instruments from southern
Europe (the mandolin) and Africa
(the banjo).
In relative isolation in the
Appalachians, bluegrass developed
its own characteristics and became
the uniquely American music
form that it is today.
The standard bluegrass band
consists almost invariably of
fiddle, banjo, mandolin, guitar,
and bass, and not an electric

guitar or pedal steel guitar in
sight.
Cold, Quick Fingers
Sunday's show began with the
Bear Creek Boys, a band from the
Santa Cruz area. Mandolinist Joe
Kinbro sang a version of Linda
Ronstadt's hit "The Only Mama
That'll Walk the Line," and
guitarist Jeff Hawkins led on
"Beaumont Rag," getting in some
good fast picking despite cold
fingers.
The band departed from
.traditional bluegrass somewhat
with Chuck Berry's "Maybelline,"
but it was hardly rock and roll
either. Next they sang a very
pretty Merle Haggard tune, "Silver
Wings."
They finished with "Orange
Blossom Special," a bluegrass
fiddler's virtuoso piece, which
Stanley Meidinger played
creditably. As an encore, the Bear
Creek Boys played "She's No
Angel," a song recorded recently
by the New Riders of the Purple
Sage.
Next was High Country, one of
the best known Bay Area
bluegrass bands. Guitarist Chris
Boutwell did a fine rendition of

"Sittin' On Top of the World."
Banjo picker Larry Cohea was
particularly impressive on
"Cripple Creek" and the closing
number, "Foggy Mountain
Breakdown."
Fiddler Ed Neff and
mandolinist Butch Waller led on
an unusual tune, "Little Rabbit,"
starting as a duet and then joined
by the rest of the band. The
encore, "Uncle Pen," again
featured Neff's fiddling.
The last act was the Phantoms
of the Opry, a band which
recently won some awards at Bill
Monroe's Bean blossom Festival,
one of the leading bluegrass
gatherings in the dountry.
Crowd-Pleasing Phantoms
Most of the vocals were done
by guitarist Pat Enright, whose
singing was the best of the
evening. Joined by the rest of the
band, he sang "The Touch of
God's Hand," which was far and
away the best gospel number
performed.
This band also departed from
tradition long enough to play
"Rutabaga Boogie," written and
sung by fiddler Paul Shelasky.
This little ditty described all of his
imaginative uses for "the only
vegetable I like."
Gene Tortora, an occasional
member of the band, was sitting
in Sunday night. His dobro
playing was a major crowd
pleaser.
The producer of this show,
George Martin, is planning
"Bluegrass Under the Stars No. 2"
for the first weekend in
September, featuring Vern and
Ray, another fine bluegrass act.
Meanwhile, there are several
places in the Bay Area that host

Jay Harlow

bluegrass regularly.
The Straw Hat Pizza in Palo
Alto features Gold Rush, a local
band, every Friday night. Gold
Rush also appears at the Straw
Hat in Santa Cruz on Saturday
nights.
The Bear Creek Boys are now
in their third year of weekends at
the Straw Hat in Capitola, near
Santa Cruz. The Iron Works
restaurant in Palo Alto frequently
features the Homestead Act.
Paul's Saloon, on Scott St. in
San Francisco, is the most
frequent haunt of the Phantoms
Of The Opry and High Country.
The Freight and Salvage in
Berkeley also has frequent
bluegrass nights. And every
Saturday afternoon, radio station
KSAY hosts bluegrass concerts at
the Orphanage on Montgomery
St.


JAZZ UNDER THE SUN—Stanford jazz fans were able to enjoy both the sunshine and authentic New
Orleans jazz when Preservation Hall Jazz Band performed in Frost Amphitheater last Saturday. At right a
young onlooker gets a closer look at PHJB trombonist "Big Jim" Robinson, while DeDe Pierce (left) who
returns to Stanford with the PHJB annually, delivers a vocal once more with feeling.
