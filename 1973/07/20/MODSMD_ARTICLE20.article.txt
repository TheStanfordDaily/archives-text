# 'O Lucky Man!' Rivals 'A Clockwork Orange'
## 
### JON R. KENNEDY 
O Lucky Man! is the most
important movie to come along in
several years — an artistic
achievement on a level with A
Clockwork Orange. The
comparison is inevitable. Not only
do the films have the same star
(Malcolm McDowell), both were
made in England with epic themes
dealing with alienation and the lot
of man.
Most important of all,
however, is the fact that if
Clockwork was about what
theologians call Predestination
(God's use of human nature as a
directing force in the lives of
individuals), O Lucky Man! is
about Election (the choosing of
an individual for an important
part in the cosmic play of life).
The new film developed almost
by accident — by luck — from a
desire on the part of McDowell to
do a picture about his experiences
as a coffee salesman and from
some of the epic story ideas
contributed by director Lindsay
Anderson and writer David
Sherwin.
Scenes Of Modern Life
Anderson wanted to film
vignettes depicting each of several
aspects of modern life: business
(coffee), militarism (a British
nuclear research center), science
(a medical transplant center where
human heads are grafted to the
bodies of barnyard animals),
organized religion (a mixture of
Christian and pagan traditions),
corporate-liberal imperialism
(with an appropriate similarity to
the kind of intrigue coming out of
the Nixon Administration), "art"
(a bread-and-butter rock group) as
perhaps the only way of making it
without faking it, dropping out (a
classic hobo camp), and the
movies (O Lucky Man!).
Anderson, now established as
England's outstanding film-maker,
sees his film somewhat
simplistically as an abstraction of
modern reality through these
existential confrontations with it.
Unanswered Queries
There are some questions you
shouldn't ask him: "What is this
film trying to say?" "Why does
your Pilgrim, Mick Travis
(McDowell), end up smiling
despite his insistence that there is
nothing left to smile at?"
And you shouldn't ask, as Mick
does, what there is to smile about,
anyway.
But although he doesn't want
to be asked, Anderson says he
doesn't mind bein fe void. He has a
healthy respect for critics, he says,
whose job he sees as being able to
discover and communicate what
films are all about. As director, he
doesn't pretend to know all that
his own film says, and wants the
critics to help him find out.
Complex Epic
McDowell says this film can be
appreciated on many different
levels (Wamer Bros., who put up
the money to produce it and are
now distributing it, calls it an epic
comedy, whatever that means).
Unlike Clockwork, O Lucky
Man! won't overwhelm audiences
with its powerful devices. It does
contain enough humor to qualify
as comedy, though that is hardly
its greatest value. It is epic
because Mick Travis is not about
to be defeated by all the slings
and arrows slung against him; he's

a hero, not an anti-hero.
And therein likes the film's
great lesson. Anderson believes
that you have no choice in life but
to make the best of your lot.
Some of the 'hands dealt will be
lucky ones, like the day Mick
Travis got his assignment with the
coffee company; some less so, like
the day he was mistaken for a
Communist agent while merely
trying to sell the army some
coffee. The viewer might make
much of the absurdity of Mick
Travis' situations. But they are
meant to be more comic than
absurd, showing that if you hang
in there, luck will out.
Certainly there is more of value
in this epic, as every other
reviewer has duly pointed out.
Even the uncritical viewer might
take the film's point to be that
the only ones who find both
success in adjusting to their world
and material security are rock
musicians and movie makers;
those in every pursuit but these in
the picture are either completely
frustrated or tuned into monsters
— literally or figuratively.
"Well, that could be,"
Anderson allows. "But I hadn't
thought of it that way."

(God's use of human nature as a
directing force in the lives of
individuals), O Lucky Man! is
about Election (the choosing of
an individual for an important
part in the cosmic play of life).
The new film developed almost
by accident — by luck — from a
desire on the part of McDowell to
do a picture about his experiences
as a coffee salesman and from
some of the epic story ideas
contributed by director Lindsay
Anderson and writer David
Sherwin.
Scenes Of Modern Life
Anderson wanted to film
vignettes depicting each of several
aspects of modern life: business
(coffee), militarism (a British
nuclear research center), science
(a medical transplant center where
human heads are grafted to the
bodies of barnyard animals),
organized religion (a mixture of
Christian and pagan traditions),
corporate-liberal imperialism
(with an appropriate similarity to
the kind of intrigue coming out of
the Nixon Administration), "art"
(a bread-and-butter rock group) as
perhaps the only way of making it
without faking it, dropping out (a
classic hobo camp), and the
movies (O Lucky Man!).
Anderson, now established as
England's outstanding film-maker,
sees his film somewhat
simplistically as an abstraction of
modern reality through these
existential confrontations with it.
Unanswered Queries
There are some questions you
shouldn't ask him: "What is this
film trying to say?" "Why does
your Pilgrim, Mick Travis
(McDowell), end up smiling
despite his insistence that there is
nothing left to smile at?"
And you shouldn't ask, as Mick
does, what there is to smile about,
anyway.
But although he doesn't want
to be asked, Anderson says he
doesn't mind bein fe void. He has a
healthy respect for critics, he says,
whose job he sees as being able to
discover and communicate what
films are all about. As director, he
doesn't pretend to know all that
his own film says, and wants the
critics to help him find out.
Complex Epic
McDowell says this film can be
appreciated on many different
levels (Wamer Bros., who put up
the money to produce it and are
now distributing it, calls it an epic
comedy, whatever that means).
Unlike Clockwork, O Lucky
Man! won't overwhelm audiences
with its powerful devices. It does
contain enough humor to qualify
as comedy, though that is hardly
its greatest value. It is epic
because Mick Travis is not about
to be defeated by all the slings
and arrows slung against him; he's

a hero, not an anti-hero.
And therein likes the film's
great lesson. Anderson believes
that you have no choice in life but
to make the best of your lot.
Some of the 'hands dealt will be
lucky ones, like the day Mick
Travis got his assignment with the
coffee company; some less so, like
the day he was mistaken for a
Communist agent while merely
trying to sell the army some
coffee. The viewer might make
much of the absurdity of Mick
Travis' situations. But they are
meant to be more comic than
absurd, showing that if you hang
in there, luck will out.
Certainly there is more of value
in this epic, as every other
reviewer has duly pointed out.
Even the uncritical viewer might
take the film's point to be that
the only ones who find both
success in adjusting to their world
and material security are rock
musicians and movie makers;
those in every pursuit but these in
the picture are either completely
frustrated or tuned into monsters
— literally or figuratively.
"Well, that could be,"
Anderson allows. "But I hadn't
thought of it that way."

star Malcolm McDowell for the next scene. McDowell portrays a wide range of characters in the film, from
an eager coffee salesman, to an arrogant industrialist, to a condemned peasant, to a high-Dowered

O Lucky Man! is the most
important movie to come along in
several years — an artistic
achievement on a level with A
Clockwork Orange. The
comparison is inevitable. Not only
do the films have the same star

made in England with epic themes
dealing with alienation and the lot
of man.
