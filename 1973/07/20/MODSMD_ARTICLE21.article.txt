## Talented Lamplighters Add Sparkle To Gilbert And Sullivan's 'Ruddygore' 
### BRUCE LAMOTT 
SAN FRANCISCO—A witch's
curse on a baronial lineage
provided appropriate fare for a
Friday-the-thirteenth performance
of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic
opera Ruddygore by the San
FYancisco Lamplighters at the
Presentation Theatre.
The comic operas of Gilbert
and Sullivan have enjoyed
unflagging popularity since their
creation a century ago. The
unexplainable neglect of a score as
fine as this one is made all the
more so by the Lamplighters' high
calibre performance.
As the story goes, an ancestral
Baronet of Ruddygore (the
Victorians promptly bowlderized
the title, of course) was cursed by
a witch he was burning, who
sentenced him to commit a
crime-a-day or face death at the
hands of his ancestors.
The opera opens with the
rightful baronet having gone
underground in the guise of Robin
Oakapple, a young farmer, leaving
his younger brother to carry on
the family misanthropy. After his
true identity is disclosed, the
blithe baronet's inability to live
up to his ancestors' criminal
expectations leads to his torment
by a reincarnated family portrait
gallery.
Whimsical Spoof
In the course of the whimsical
plot, Gilbert spoofs the
conventional operatic "mad
scene" and assaults the proprieties
of Victorian etiquette. He further
convolutes the plot with romantic
switchbacks, as Robin's foster
brother, Richard Dauntless, plays
an all-too-amorous intermediary
in winning the hand of the fair
Rose Maybud.
It is pointless to attempt to

single out the party responsible
for such a splendid performance.
Much of the credit, to be sure,
goes to Arthur Sullivan, whose
score sparkles with colorful
vitality. It contains some of his
best work, which conductor
Randolph Hunt showed to its best
advantage; the transparent
orchestrations are revealing, and
in this production, they revealed a
small but attentive ensemble.
Imaginative Caricatures
Gilbert supplied the book with
vivid caricatures of the Victorian,
bound by duty and virtue,
through dialogue of relentless wit.
While providing imaginative
stage "business," Director Orva
Hoskinson avoided the excesses
which tempt less capable G & S
directors to supplement a text
already saturated with humor.
The ghost scene, in which the
ancestors step out of their portrait
frames to torment the milquetoast
baronet, was an effective credit to
both writer and director.
Ultimate responsibility for irte
show, however, rests with the
thoroughgoing talent of the
Lamplighter troupe. Their fine
musicianship and stageworthiness
resulted in a tight production of
irresistible momentum.
The chorus of Professional
Bridesmaids, excellent singers all,
flooded the stage with delightful
personality. As the chorus of
Bucks and Blades, the men
performed with agility, though
they needed a more mature
sound in the spectral choruses of
Act Two.
Vocal And Dramatic Talent
Ellen Kerrigan charmed the
audience with her splendid voice
and fluttery characterization of
Rose Maybud.
Marcia Hunt's hilarious "mad

scene" was the high point of the
show, the work of a virtuoso
actress. Her fine contralto made
the listener regret that the
composer had not allotted more
music to her role of Mad
Margaret.
Robin, played by Norman
Roberts, artfully minced his way
through the anguish of bash love
and reluctant villainy; his pleasant
baritone negotiated the numerous
patter-songs with clarity and
precision.
Occasional Flaws
Robert Wood played the
dashing swashbuckler Dauntless
with brash assertion, though his
rendering of Gilbert's nautical
dialect vacillated between Dublin,
Dover, and Dallas.
Mary McMahon Brown well
suited the role of Dame Hannah,
but Daniel Beaulieu's elderly
affectation of Old Adam
Goodheart was not convincing. As
Sir Roderic, Walter Mattes'
stentorian "When the Night Wind
Howls" lacked the vocal polish
and eloquent diction of the other
principals.
Brilliant costuming, colorfully
quaint sets, and the combined
energies of this volunteer
company produced an ebullient

production rivalling that of the
D'Oyly Carte troupe, preservers of
the classical G&S tradition. There
was a secure rapport between the
pit and the stage, an enviable
polish worthy of any company
devoted to musical theatre.
Gilbert and Sullivan buffs will
be happy to know that this
production continues on Friday
and Saturday nights through
August 4, Turk St. near Masonic.

provided appropriate fare for a
Friday-the-thirteenth performance
of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic
opera Ruddygore by the San
FYancisco Lamplighters at the
Presentation Theatre.
The comic operas of Gilbert
and Sullivan have enjoyed
unflagging popularity since their
creation a century ago. The
unexplainable neglect of a score as
fine as this one is made all the
more so by the Lamplighters' high
calibre performance.
As the story goes, an ancestral
Baronet of Ruddygore (the
Victorians promptly bowlderized
the title, of course) was cursed by
a witch he was burning, who
sentenced him to commit a
crime-a-day or face death at the
hands of his ancestors.
The opera opens with the
rightful baronet having gone
underground in the guise of Robin
Oakapple, a young farmer, leaving
his younger brother to carry on
the family misanthropy. After his
true identity is disclosed, the
blithe baronet's inability to live
up to his ancestors' criminal
expectations leads to his torment
by a reincarnated family portrait
gallery.
Whimsical Spoof
In the course of the whimsical
plot, Gilbert spoofs the
conventional operatic "mad
scene" and assaults the proprieties
of Victorian etiquette. He further
convolutes the plot with romantic
switchbacks, as Robin's foster
brother, Richard Dauntless, plays
an all-too-amorous intermediary
in winning the hand of the fair
Rose Maybud.
It is pointless to attempt to

single out the party responsible
for such a splendid performance.
Much of the credit, to be sure,
goes to Arthur Sullivan, whose
score sparkles with colorful
vitality. It contains some of his
best work, which conductor
Randolph Hunt showed to its best
advantage; the transparent
orchestrations are revealing, and
in this production, they revealed a
small but attentive ensemble.
Imaginative Caricatures
Gilbert supplied the book with
vivid caricatures of the Victorian,
bound by duty and virtue,
through dialogue of relentless wit.
While providing imaginative
stage "business," Director Orva
Hoskinson avoided the excesses
which tempt less capable G & S
directors to supplement a text
already saturated with humor.
The ghost scene, in which the
ancestors step out of their portrait
frames to torment the milquetoast
baronet, was an effective credit to
both writer and director.
Ultimate responsibility for irte
show, however, rests with the
thoroughgoing talent of the
Lamplighter troupe. Their fine
musicianship and stageworthiness
resulted in a tight production of
irresistible momentum.
The chorus of Professional
Bridesmaids, excellent singers all,
flooded the stage with delightful
personality. As the chorus of
Bucks and Blades, the men
performed with agility, though
they needed a more mature
sound in the spectral choruses of
Act Two.
Vocal And Dramatic Talent
Ellen Kerrigan charmed the
audience with her splendid voice
and fluttery characterization of
Rose Maybud.
Marcia Hunt's hilarious "mad

scene" was the high point of the
show, the work of a virtuoso
actress. Her fine contralto made
the listener regret that the
composer had not allotted more
music to her role of Mad
Margaret.
Robin, played by Norman
Roberts, artfully minced his way
through the anguish of bash love
and reluctant villainy; his pleasant
baritone negotiated the numerous
patter-songs with clarity and
precision.
Occasional Flaws
Robert Wood played the
dashing swashbuckler Dauntless
with brash assertion, though his
rendering of Gilbert's nautical
dialect vacillated between Dublin,
Dover, and Dallas.
Mary McMahon Brown well
suited the role of Dame Hannah,
but Daniel Beaulieu's elderly
affectation of Old Adam
Goodheart was not convincing. As
Sir Roderic, Walter Mattes'
stentorian "When the Night Wind
Howls" lacked the vocal polish
and eloquent diction of the other
principals.
Brilliant costuming, colorfully
quaint sets, and the combined
energies of this volunteer
company produced an ebullient

production rivalling that of the
D'Oyly Carte troupe, preservers of
the classical G&S tradition. There
was a secure rapport between the
pit and the stage, an enviable
polish worthy of any company
devoted to musical theatre.
Gilbert and Sullivan buffs will
be happy to know that this
production continues on Friday
and Saturday nights through
August 4, Turk St. near Masonic.
