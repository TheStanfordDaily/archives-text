Prices Climb Under Phaee 4
WASHINGTON — Wholesale prices began to skyrocket
yesterday as the result of President Nixon's
newly-announced Phase 4 program, and observers say the
housewife will begin to feel the pocketbook pinch within
days.
Herbert Stein, chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisers, admits nobody will be happy with the new
guidelines. The consumer, he says, will be upset with
rising prices, while the producer won't like the freeze on
profits.
The new program, announced earlier this week by
Treasury Secretary George Shultz, lifted price controls on
most foodstuffs except beef. The program will also freeze
gas prices.
AFL-CIO President George Meany blasted the new
program yesterday, declaring that "The cost of living is
continuing up and up ... and profits are out of sight."
Pentagon Admits Bombing Coverup
WASHINGTON — The Pentagon admitted yesterday that
it was responsible for covering up the secret Air Force
bombing strikes into Cambodia.
The report contradicted a statement issued earlier in
the day admitting that the Pentagon had ordered the
missions, but blaming field commanders for the cover-up.
Pentagon spokesman Jerry Friedheim retracted the
earlier statement.
Friedheim said the Strategic Air Command originally
came up with the idea of keeping two sets of log books.
One set said the strikes took place in South Vietnam;
the other revealed that some 3500 852 strikes were
launched over Cambodia in 1969-70, while the U.S. was
officially recognizing Cambodia's neutrality.
Friedheim said the Senate Armed Services Committee
will be told where the falsification order came from, but
refused to divulge the source to newsmen.
France Postpones Nuclear Test
AUCKLAND, New Zealand — France has apparently
postponed its scheduled nuclear test in the South Pacific,
reports here indicate.
No official reason was given for the postponement, and
there was no word on whether the test would be
rescheduled.
Meanwhile, there were reports that the French navy
had detained an American yacht just outside the danger
zone on an undisclosed charge.
Several countries had protested the planned nuclear
test.
Dean Takes Fifth 67 Times
WASHINGTON — John W. Dean 111, the White House's
ousted counsel, took the Fifth Amendment 67 times
before a House subcommittee yesterday.
The subcommittee was exploring whether the CIA was
illegally involved in domestic intelligence operations.
Earlier, former Presidential aides David Young and Egil
Krogh also refused to testify.
397 UFW Pickets Arrested
FRESNO — Some 397 pickets for the United Farm
Workers Union surrendered peacefully to police today
after massing in violation of court orders.
Meanwhile, student body presidents from 11 California
State Colleges and Universities announced plans to

caravan by auto to Delano to show their support for the
UFW. They plan to meet with UFW President Cesar
Chavez there.
Reagan's Tax Plan Supported
SACRAMENTO — The California Taxpayers Association
has announced its support for Gov. Ronald Reagan's
proposed tax limitation initiative.
CTA President Mack Easton calls the proposal the first
major attempt to link the growth of state expenditures to
personal income.
Cannery Workers Strike
SAN FRANCISCO — Over 65,000 cannery workers
walked off the job yesterday, although negotiators in
Washington continued their talks.
The workers, members of the Teamsters Union, left
work at 10 a.m. when their strike deadline passed without
word from the negotiators.
State officials said the walkout could threaten upwards
of $200 million in crops.
Battle Continues Near Phnom Penh
PHNOM PENH — Heavy fighting continues to surround
the embattled capital of Cambodia. U.S. air strikes
continue just 10 miles from the city, but government
troops still find it difficult to hold ground.
Fighting also continues within 30 miles of Saigon, as
each side reported 86 casualties after exchanging artillery
and small arms fire.
Hostages Held At Athens Airport
ATHENS — A short, slight man in a pink suit, armed with
a sub-machine gun, took 15 hostages after an abortive
attempt to take over the El A 1 Airlines ticket office here.
The 15 hostages — including two Americans — were
released unharmed after the ambassadors of Iraq and
Libya agreed to escort the man to the airport, where a
Kuwait airliner flew him to that Persian Gulf country. He
is reportedly now in government custody there.
NASA Finds Skylab I Problem
HOUSTON — A special NASA board report said yesterday
that an engineering mistake caused the problems that
nearly scrapped the first Skylab mission.
The report said the mistake caused parts of Skylab's
solar energy equipment to be deployed too early and be
torn off during launch from Cape Kennedy.
The second Skylab mission is scheduled to lift off July
28.
Senate Passes Minimum Wage Hike
WASHINGTON — The Senate today rejected amendments
favored by the White House to a new minimum wage bill.
The bill, which may face a veto from the President,
passed the Senate by a 64-33 margin, two votes short of
the two-thirds needed to override such a veto.
The bill would boost the minimum wage from
$1.60/ hour to $2.20/ hour by next year.
Among the provisions rejected yesterday were some
that would have allowed the payment of a lower wage to
young and elderly people.
Fair Through Saturday
Continued overcast night and morning through Saturday,
but sunny afternoons. Highs today in the 70s and low 80s,
lows in the mid-50s.

yesterday as the result of President Nixon's
newly-announced Phase 4 program, and observers say the
housewife will begin to feel the pocketbook pinch within
days.
Herbert Stein, chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisers, admits nobody will be happy with the new
guidelines. The consumer, he says, will be upset with
rising prices, while the producer won't like the freeze on
profits.
The new program, announced earlier this week by
Treasury Secretary George Shultz, lifted price controls on
most foodstuffs except beef. The program will also freeze
gas prices.
AFL-CIO President George Meany blasted the new
program yesterday, declaring that "The cost of living is
continuing up and up ... and profits are out of sight."
Pentagon Admits Bombing Coverup
WASHINGTON — The Pentagon admitted yesterday that
it was responsible for covering up the secret Air Force
bombing strikes into Cambodia.
The report contradicted a statement issued earlier in
the day admitting that the Pentagon had ordered the
missions, but blaming field commanders for the cover-up.
Pentagon spokesman Jerry Friedheim retracted the
earlier statement.
Friedheim said the Strategic Air Command originally
came up with the idea of keeping two sets of log books.
One set said the strikes took place in South Vietnam;
the other revealed that some 3500 852 strikes were
launched over Cambodia in 1969-70, while the U.S. was
officially recognizing Cambodia's neutrality.
Friedheim said the Senate Armed Services Committee
will be told where the falsification order came from, but
refused to divulge the source to newsmen.
France Postpones Nuclear Test
AUCKLAND, New Zealand — France has apparently

Meanwhile, there were reports that the French navy
had detained an American yacht just outside the danger
zone on an undisclosed charge.
Several countries had protested the planned nuclear
test.

Kuwait airliner flew him to that Persian Gulf country. He
is reportedly now in government custody there.
NASA Finds Skylab I Problem
HOUSTON — A special NASA board report said yesterday
that an engineering mistake caused the problems that

Senate Passes Minimum Wage Hike
WASHINGTON — The Senate today rejected amendments
favored by the White House to a new minimum wage bill.

the two-thirds needed to override such a veto.
The bill would boost the minimum wage from
$1.60/ hour to $2.20/ hour by next year.
Among the provisions rejected yesterday were some
that would have allowed the payment of a lower wage to
young and elderly people.

newly-announced Phase 4 program, and observers say the
housewife will begin to feel the pocketbook pinch within
days.
Herbert Stein, chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisers, admits nobody will be happy with the new
guidelines. The consumer, he says, will be upset with
rising prices, while the producer won't like the freeze on
profits.
The new program, announced earlier this week by
Treasury Secretary George Shultz, lifted price controls on
most foodstuffs except beef. The program will also freeze
gas prices.
AFL-CIO President George Meany blasted the new
program yesterday, declaring that "The cost of living is
continuing up and up ... and profits are out of sight."
Pentagon Admits Bombing Coverup
WASHINGTON — The Pentagon admitted yesterday that
it was responsible for covering up the secret Air Force
bombing strikes into Cambodia.
The report contradicted a statement issued earlier in
the day admitting that the Pentagon had ordered the
missions, but blaming field commanders for the cover-up.
Pentagon spokesman Jerry Friedheim retracted the
earlier statement.
Friedheim said the Strategic Air Command originally
came up with the idea of keeping two sets of log books.
One set said the strikes took place in South Vietnam;
the other revealed that some 3500 852 strikes were
launched over Cambodia in 1969-70, while the U.S. was
officially recognizing Cambodia's neutrality.
Friedheim said the Senate Armed Services Committee
will be told where the falsification order came from, but
refused to divulge the source to newsmen.
France Postpones Nuclear Test
AUCKLAND, New Zealand — France has apparently

Meanwhile, there were reports that the French navy
had detained an American yacht just outside the danger
zone on an undisclosed charge.
Several countries had protested the planned nuclear
test.

of $200 million in crops.
Battle Continues Near Phnom Penh
PHNOM PENH — Heavy fighting continues to surround
the embattled capital of Cambodia. U.S. air strikes

each side reported 86 casualties after exchanging artillery
and small arms fire.
Hostages Held At Athens Airport

a sub-machine gun, took 15 hostages after an abortive
attempt to take over the El A 1 Airlines ticket office here.

released unharmed after the ambassadors of Iraq and
Libya agreed to escort the man to the airport, where a
Kuwait airliner flew him to that Persian Gulf country. He
is reportedly now in government custody there.
NASA Finds Skylab I Problem
HOUSTON — A special NASA board report said yesterday
that an engineering mistake caused the problems that
nearly scrapped the first Skylab mission.

solar energy equipment to be deployed too early and be
torn off during launch from Cape Kennedy.
The second Skylab mission is scheduled to lift off July
28.
Senate Passes Minimum Wage Hike
WASHINGTON — The Senate today rejected amendments
favored by the White House to a new minimum wage bill.
The bill, which may face a veto from the President,
passed the Senate by a 64-33 margin, two votes short of
the two-thirds needed to override such a veto.
The bill would boost the minimum wage from
$1.60/ hour to $2.20/ hour by next year.
Among the provisions rejected yesterday were some
that would have allowed the payment of a lower wage to
young and elderly people.
Fair Through Saturday
Continued overcast night and morning through Saturday,
but sunny afternoons. Highs today in the 70s and low 80s,
lows in the mid-50s.
