# Skylab II Countdown Continues; Garriott Among Astronauts
## 
### 
The countdown for the July 28 launch of the Skylab II
crew, which is scheduled to spend a record 56 days in
space, continued smoothly yesterday.
The crew is scheduled to lift off in their Apollo
command module, which will take them up to Skylab, the
orbiting space station launched earlier this year, in eight
days.
Among the three astronauts is Owen Garriott, an
electrical engineering professor here.
The countdown began Sunday at 8 p.m. This morning,
a practice launch was scheduled to be held. Following
this, the countdown clock was turned back to T-48 hours
and will be restarted on Thursday.
Previously, on July 1, Garriott and his two partners,
mission commander Alan Bean and command module
pilot Jack Lusman, met with the crew of Skylab I to
discuss pre-launch training.
Earlier this year, the Skylab I astronauts, Charles
"Pete" Conrad, Joseph Kerwin, and Paul Weitz, spent a
record 28 days in space — a record which Skylab II is
scheduled to double.
Short-Cuts Discussed
During their meeting, the six astronauts discussed
pre-launch training, as well as short-cuts the first crew
used in living and working during their mission.
All three Skylab II astronauts passed their next-to-last
medical examinations last week, and are now continuing
their training at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.
Fifty experiments have been planned for Skylab 11.
Five other experiments, however, have been cancelled
since they required the use of a port which has been

covered by a sunshade.
The astronauts will work in the relative comfort of
Skylab's 13,000 cubic foot workshop, which is about the
size of a small, two-bedroom house. The orbiting station
has complete living and working facilities.
Garriott's Expertise
Garriott, 42, specializes in electromagnetic theory and
ionisphere physics. He joined the NASA program in 1965,
and has since undergone intensive training in the use of jet
planes.
NASA hopes that his expertise will add to knowledge
about the sun and the effects of prolonged periods of
weightlessness upon man.
Garriott received his Master's and Ph.D. degrees from
Stanford, and has maintained contact with the University
during his eight years as an astronaut, although recently
his visits have been somewhat limited.
According to Bean, the greatest challenge the
astronauts will face will be keeping mental self-discipline
during the marathon mission.
Experiments
While Garriott is in space, two other Stanford
professors will be working on Skylab experiments.
Dr. Leonard Hayflick, professor of medical
microbiology, is working on an experiment on the effects
of weightlessness on human cells, a colony of which will
be on board.
Biology Prof. Colin Pittendrigh is conducting an
experiment on "biological clocks" in mice and fruit flies
in space.

covered by a sunshade.
The astronauts will work in the relative comfort of
Skylab's 13,000 cubic foot workshop, which is about the
size of a small, two-bedroom house. The orbiting station
has complete living and working facilities.
Garriott's Expertise
Garriott, 42, specializes in electromagnetic theory and
ionisphere physics. He joined the NASA program in 1965,
and has since undergone intensive training in the use of jet
planes.
NASA hopes that his expertise will add to knowledge
about the sun and the effects of prolonged periods of
weightlessness upon man.
Garriott received his Master's and Ph.D. degrees from
Stanford, and has maintained contact with the University
during his eight years as an astronaut, although recently
his visits have been somewhat limited.
According to Bean, the greatest challenge the
astronauts will face will be keeping mental self-discipline
during the marathon mission.
Experiments
While Garriott is in space, two other Stanford
professors will be working on Skylab experiments.
Dr. Leonard Hayflick, professor of medical
microbiology, is working on an experiment on the effects
of weightlessness on human cells, a colony of which will
be on board.
Biology Prof. Colin Pittendrigh is conducting an
experiment on "biological clocks" in mice and fruit flies
in space.
The countdown for the July 28 launch of the Skylab II
crew, which is scheduled to spend a record 56 days in
space, continued smoothly yesterday.
The crew is scheduled to lift off in their Apollo
command module, which will take them up to Skylab, the
orbiting space station launched earlier this year, in eight
days.
Among the three astronauts is Owen Garriott, an
electrical engineering professor here.
The countdown began Sunday at 8 p.m. This morning,
a practice launch was scheduled to be held. Following
this, the countdown clock was turned back to T-48 hours
and will be restarted on Thursday.
Previously, on July 1, Garriott and his two partners,
mission commander Alan Bean and command module
pilot Jack Lusman, met with the crew of Skylab I to
discuss pre-launch training.
Earlier this year, the Skylab I astronauts, Charles
"Pete" Conrad, Joseph Kerwin, and Paul Weitz, spent a
record 28 days in space — a record which Skylab II is
scheduled to double.
Short-Cuts Discussed
During their meeting, the six astronauts discussed
pre-launch training, as well as short-cuts the first crew
used in living and working during their mission.
All three Skylab II astronauts passed their next-to-last
medical examinations last week, and are now continuing
their training at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.
Fifty experiments have been planned for Skylab 11.
Five other experiments, however, have been cancelled
since they required the use of a port which has been

covered by a sunshade.
The astronauts will work in the relative comfort of
Skylab's 13,000 cubic foot workshop, which is about the
size of a small, two-bedroom house. The orbiting station
has complete living and working facilities.
