# Lane A Closed For Four Weeks
## 
### 
Lane A between Campus Drive and the Bookstore-Post Office will be
closed for four weeks beginning Mon., July 23, the Facilities Planning
Office has announced.
The contractor building the new Law School will be tearing up the
street for a steam line and other utilities during this time.
The lane will be rebuilt as an entirely new road and will include curbs
and gutters. It is expected to be back in service August 17.
Police Services will install barricades and signs pointing out available
parking space. Post office and delivery trucks will be the only vehicles
permitted to pass during the closed period, J. Hugh Turner, assistant
construction manager, Facilities Planning, said.
