# Nobel Prize Winner Decries Nuclear Tests

"J "VVI M A 1U UUU
Chemistry Prof. Linus Pauling,
winner of the 1962 Nobel Peace Prize
for his work promoting the nuclear
test-ban treaty, has condemned France
for its planned nuclear test series in
the South Pacific.
Pauling, a longtime opponent of
nuclear tests, claims there is no
difference between this experiment
and those the 1963 treaty prohibited.
"These tests are just as bad as tests
set off by the U.S., Great Britain, and
Russia 15 years ago," he commented.
France has not publicly set a date
for the experiments, but all signs
indicate the series will begin in the
very near future. The first blast will be
at Mururoa, 720 miles southeast of
Papeete, Tahiti.
Pauling believes that these tests will
have adverse effects on the world's
environment. Harmful radioactivity
will be released into the atmosphere,
contributing to the possibilities of
cancer and the birth of defective
children, he said.
However, there is a partial solution
to the problem, according to the
72-year old professor. "For a few

million dollars more, France could
carry out its tests underground.
"This only represents about
one-tenth of a percent of the total
cost,"and would greatly reduce the
danger from radioactive fallout, he
explained.
Even if the tests were conducted
underground, Pauling would remain
opposed. "I think it's nonsense and a
waste of money for the French
government," the chemist said.
Pauling is not alone in his
opposition to the nuclear tests. New
Zealand, Japan, and various other
countries in the area of the test sites
have condemned the experiments.
Roman Catholic bishops in France
have also urged the French
government to abandon its plans, but
these protests have been ignored.
Besides the 1962 Peace Pri z®
Pauling won the Nobel prize for
chemistry in 1954, making him the
only person in history to receive a
Nobel Prize in two separate categories.
He is also the author of Vitamin C
and the Common Cold, a book which
suggests that large amounts of Vitamin
C can prevent diseases.
