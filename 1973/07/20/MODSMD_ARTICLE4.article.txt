# Jury Finds Burts Guilty Of 2nd-Degree Murder
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
A San Bernardino County Superior
Court jury Wednesday afternoon
convicted Andrea Holman Burt and
Benton Douglas Burt of second-degree
murder, assault with a deadly weapon,
and rescuing a prisoner.
The charges against the Burts stem
from an Oct. 6 ambush-escape which
freed convict Ronald Wayne Beaty and
left prison guard Jesus Sanchez dead.
Second-degree murder carries a
penalty of five years to life, but the
jury's finding that the Burts were
armed at the scene increases the
minimum time they must serve before
parole from a 20-month term to a
40-month term.
(Andrea Holman Burt is the
daughter of Med Center Prof. Halsted
Holman.)
Didn't Shoot
Although prosecutor Joseph D.
Canty did not contend that the Burts
shot the guards, they could legally be
convicted of murder as conspirators in
the plan.
The jury began deliberating on
Friday. Judge Thomas Haldorsen
instructed the panel that they could
hand down a first-degree murder
conviction only by finding that the
person who actually fired the shots
killed the guard deliberately and with
malice aforethought and that the
guard's death was a "reasonably
foreseeable consequence" of the
conspiracy to free Beaty.
The jury's verdict of second-degree
murder means that the prosecution
was unable to prove that the Burts
planned to kill the guard.
Beaty, who was recaptured with
former Venceremos member Jean
Hobson two months after the escape,
later turned state's evidence. He
received a life sentence for murder in
exchange for testimony implicating
the Burts and others in the escape
plot.
Venceremos-Backed?
Beaty claimed his escape was
backed by Venceremos, the
Peninsula-based revolutionary
organization. Venceremos has
repeatedly denied involvement in the
escape.
Beaty accused Robert Seabock of
Palo Alto of firing three shots
point-blank at the two unarmed guards
who ambushers had handcuffed in the
back seat of a state car.
Beaty testified that Seabock later
told him he killed the guards so that
there would be "no witnesses" to the
escape.
Seabock and Hobson face the same
charges in a trial tentatively scheduled
for Sept. 17 in San Bernardino.
Married
The Burts, who have remained
jailed since they surrendered to
authorities last Oct. 13, were married
in the courtroom last February by
their attorney, Charles Garry, a
minister of the Universal Life church.
The 61-day trial was the longest
criminal trial in San Bernardino
County history.
A bill is pending in the state
legislature to reimburse the county for
the reported $500,000 spent on trial
proceedings.
Under a similar provision, Santa
Clara County was reimbursed for
expenses totalling $600,000 for the

Angela Davis trial.
When the verdict was handed down
at 2:30 p.m. Wednesday, 19 year-old
Andrea Burt listened impassively and
then buried her head on her husband's
arms.
Her mother heard the verdict
without visible emotion, but put her
arms around Andrea's younger sister,
who was crying.
Prof. Holman was not present for
the verdict.
After the verdict was read, Garry
told the judge he would take further
action on what he termed "witholding
of information and misrepresentations
to the court" by Canty.
Haldorsen replied that Garry's
motion for a new trial will be
discussed when the defendants appear
for sentencing Aug. 8.
'Railroaded'
Garry later told reporters that his
clients "got railroaded due to the
atmosphere of this county .. . This
case is a classic example of what
happens when you try a case in the
midst of hysteria and political
involvement.
"We are going to appeal and motion
[sic] for a new trial in the meantime,"
he continued. "We believe that
eventually the case will be reversed."
Garry's appeal is based on his
contention that conspiracy-related
evidence pertaining to events that
occurred after the Burts were in
custody was inadmissable against the
Burts, and his attack on the "police
state atmosphere" created by the
county in the trial.
Security Precautions
Garry claims the jurors were
intimidated by security precautions in
a courtroom remodeled especially for
the trial at a cost of $40,000.
During the trial, Garry alleged that
the prosecution had acted illegally to
obtain some evidence against the
Burts.
But San Bernardino Sheriff Sgt.
Rod Maniord commented, "The jury
wasn't fooled by all those
revolutionary attacks on the way we
conducted the investigation."

Assistant defense attorney Tom
Nolan related that the Burts reacted to
the verdict with "disappointment in
the jury system and in the justice
system of San Bernardino County."
"In any other county we would
have been acquitted without
question," Nolan said.
Phil Guthrie, assistant director of
the state department of corrections,
said Andrea Burt would almost
certainly serve her sentence in the
California Institution for Women at
Frontera. He refused to speculate on
any security problems that might arise
within the prison.
Prison sources, however, say that
due to the nature of the crime, Andrea
Burt could be classified as a maximum
security risk. If she is assigned to
maximum security lockup in Frontera,
she will serve her time in the same
cellblock where the four women
convicted in the "Manson family"
killings are being held.
