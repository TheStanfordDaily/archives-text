# SWOPSI Head's Future Confused

Stanford Workshops on Political
and Social Issues (SWOPSI) Director
Dan Lewis has been rehired for
another academic year, but there has
been confusion as to how much longer
he will stay with the program.
The Daily has learned that in a June
26 letter, Dean of Undergraduate
Studies James L. Gibbs indicated that
he understood that "in all likelihood"
the 1973-74 year would be Lewis'
"last year as SWOPSI director."
Lewis said yesterday he had not
asked to leave SWOPSI — although he
had talked about it informally — and
that he was "surprised" at the dean's
letter.

The letter noted Asst.
Undergraduate Dean B. Michael
Closson's "overall satisfaction" with
Lewis' work (Closson serves as Gibbs'
representative to SWOPSI).
Lewis stated that last year had been
"a good year as far as administrative
relationships" with the Office of the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
(ODUS). There had been "no hassles
with the dean [Gibbs] over anything,"
he commented.
When asked if he felt he was being
dismissed, Lewis responded, "Well, I
would put this in the broad hint
category, rather than an actual request
to leave."
In a telephone interview yesterday,

Gibbs explained that the letter's main
intent was to notify Lewis of his
rehiring. The reference to Lewis'
leaving, Gibbs said, came only
incidentally from a conversation
between Lewis and Closson.
Gibbs stated that according to
Closson, Lewis had said he had
reached "the point of diminshing
returns" as SWOPSI director, and
wanted "to begin to look around for
different types of experiences."
The letter served as ODUS' way of
letting Lewis know his desire to leave
SWOPSI had been received, Gibbs said.
Definite Letter
Gibbs stated that if he had intended
to dismiss Lewis, he would have sent
him a definite letter of dismissal.
Gibbs said there are "no plans one
way or the other" on Lewis' future
with SWOPSI beyond next June.
The dean also said he talked to
Lewis yesterday and had invited him
to discuss any misunderstandings the
letter may have caused.
'Job Possibilities'
Closson said yesterday that "Dan
has expressed an interest in exploring
new job possibilities."
"I don't feel there are two sides to
the story," he said. The statement in
the letter "should be taken at face
value."
Closson added that the statement in
the letter in no way precluded the
possibility that Lewis would continue
as SWOPSI director next year.
Lewis said later that "Closson and I
talked about if I was going to stay, but
I never told them [Gibbs and Closson]
that I was leaving."
Never Made Statement
"I never made it a declarative
statement," he said.
Lewis said his conversation with
Closson was a "personal" one, where
he discussed "what was the best thing
for me, Dan Lewis."
Closson was unavailable for further
comment last night.
Go-Between
Lewis also said that he and Gibbs
"don't usually communicate." He had
relied on Closson to be a go-between
for himself and ODUS, the SWOPSI
director said.
He added that he was "not clear"
about what he would do next year.
"I'm going to do what's best for
me. It all depends on how the board
feels about it and how the dean feels
about it,"he said.
