# Telephone Hoax Fools Ervin
## 'Mitchell OK'd Bugging Budget' 
### 
WASHINGTON - Former U.S. Asst.
Atty. Gen. Robert O. Mardian testified
yesterday that he was told that former
Atty. Gen. John Mitchell approved the
budget for campaign "dirty tricks."
Appearing at the Senate Watergate
hearings, Mardian said he was with
Mitchell and deputy Nixon campaign
director Jeb Stuart Magruder only
hours after the June 17,1972 break-in
was discovered at the Democratic
National Headquarters.
Mardian said Magruder told him
then that Mitchell had approved the
budget for dirty tricks.
"Did Mitchell confirm that?" asked
committee counsel James Hamilton.
"I think the subject was discussed
and he didn't deny it," Mardian
answered.
Yesterday's hearings featured a
bizarre telephone hoax that briefly

had committee members believing
they had avoided a potentially
explosive confrontation with the
White House.
Sen. Sam J. Ervin Jr. (D-N.C.), the
committee chairman, announced that
Treasury Secretary George Shultz had
called him to say that President Nixon
was releasing tapes of his White House
conversations to the committee.
Ervin commended the President on
his "very wise decision."
But within a few minutes, an
embarrassed but amused Ervin had to
retract his announcement.
"It appears a hoax has been
perpetrated up on this committee, at
least upon the chairman of the
committee," Ervin said.
Erroneous Assumption
He said he simply assumed it was
Shultz on the other end of the

confidential Senate line. It wasn't.
Committee aides checked the
surprise "Shultz" statement with
Presidential counsel Leonard Garment,
who denied it. Later, the real Shultz
spoke with Ervin, assuring him that
the call was a hoax. The FBI will
investigate the call.
The Wnite House is still mulling the
committee's request for access to the
tapes, press secretary Ronald Ziegler
said yesterday. President Nixon will
frame a reply to the request this
weekend.
Tapes A Bombshell
The revelation Monday that the
tapes of Nixon's conversations existed
dropped a bombshell into the hearings.
Federal Aviation Administration
head Alexander P. Butterfield, a
former aide to ousted domestic
counselor John Ehrlichman, revealed
he had supervised installation of the
recording devices three years ago.
Mardian's testimony yesterday
challenged Mitchell's denials that he
had approved any bugging activities.
Mardian said he was in Inelewood
