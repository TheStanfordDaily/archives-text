# Telephone Hoax Fools Ervin
## 'Mitchell OK'd Bugging Budget' 
### 
WASHINGTON - Former U.S. Asst.
Atty. Gen. Robert O. Mardian testified
yesterday that he was told that former
Atty. Gen. John Mitchell approved the
budget for campaign "dirty tricks."
Appearing at the Senate Watergate
hearings, Mardian said he was with
Mitchell and deputy Nixon campaign
director Jeb Stuart Magruder only
hours after the June 17,1972 break-in
was discovered at the Democratic
National Headquarters.
Mardian said Magruder told him
then that Mitchell had approved the
budget for dirty tricks.
"Did Mitchell confirm that?" asked
committee counsel James Hamilton.
"I think the subject was discussed
and he didn't deny it," Mardian
answered.
Yesterday's hearings featured a
bizarre telephone hoax that briefly

had committee members believing
they had avoided a potentially
explosive confrontation with the
White House.
Sen. Sam J. Ervin Jr. (D-N.C.), the
committee chairman, announced that
Treasury Secretary George Shultz had
called him to say that President Nixon
was releasing tapes of his White House
conversations to the committee.
Ervin commended the President on
his "very wise decision."
But within a few minutes, an
embarrassed but amused Ervin had to
retract his announcement.
"It appears a hoax has been
perpetrated up on this committee, at
least upon the chairman of the
committee," Ervin said.
Erroneous Assumption
He said he simply assumed it was
Shultz on the other end of the

confidential Senate line. It wasn't.
Committee aides checked the
surprise "Shultz" statement with
Presidential counsel Leonard Garment,
who denied it. Later, the real Shultz
spoke with Ervin, assuring him that
the call was a hoax. The FBI will
investigate the call.
The Wnite House is still mulling the
committee's request for access to the
tapes, press secretary Ronald Ziegler
said yesterday. President Nixon will
frame a reply to the request this
weekend.
Tapes A Bombshell
The revelation Monday that the
tapes of Nixon's conversations existed
dropped a bombshell into the hearings.
Federal Aviation Administration
head Alexander P. Butterfield, a
former aide to ousted domestic
counselor John Ehrlichman, revealed
he had supervised installation of the
recording devices three years ago.
Mardian's testimony yesterday
challenged Mitchell's denials that he
had approved any bugging activities.
Mardian said he was in Inelewood
Calif, with Mitchell and Magruder
when they heard of the arrests at the
Watergate apart ment-hotel-off ice
complex.
It was here, Mardian said, that the
discussions about Mitchell's role took
place.
'Some Kind Of Nut'
Mardian said Magruder told him
that G. Gordon Liddy, one of those
arrested that morning, was "some kind
of nut, he should have suspected that
something like this would happen."
Before Mardian took the stand,
former Nixon campaign aide Frederick
C. Laßue, who has pleaded guilty to
charges stemming from the Watergate,
ended his two days on the stand.
Laßue told the senators how he
helped arrange payments of White
House and campaign cash to Watergate
defendants and their lawyers.
Both Aware
He said that during one March,
1973 meeting with Mitchell and
then-Presidential Counsel John W.
Dean 111, it was evident that both were

aware of the Watergate cover-up.
Laßue testified earlier that at a
March 30, 1972 meeting, Mitchell had
deferred action on Liddy's bugging
proposals.
"Mr. Mitchell certainly was not
enthusiastic about it [the bugging
plan], and was certainly trying to
terminate any discussion of it," Laßue
recounted.

Mitchell previously testified that he
had heard Liddy's bugging plans, but
had flatly refused them on several
occasions.
Laßue pleaded guilty several weeks
ago to one count of conspiring to
obstruct justice. He has not yet been
sentenced, but there are reports that
he has agreed to co-operate with
government prosecutors.

Laßue testified earlier that at a
March 30, 1972 meeting, Mitchell had
deferred action on Liddy's bugging
proposals.
"Mr. Mitchell certainly was not

plan], and was certainly trying to
terminate any discussion of it," Laßue
recounted.

Mitchell previously testified that he
had heard Liddy's bugging plans, but
had flatly refused them on several
occasions.
Laßue pleaded guilty several weeks
ago to one count of conspiring to
obstruct justice. He has not yet been

WASHINGTON - Former U.S. Asst.
Atty. Gen. Robert O. Mardian testified
yesterday that he was told that former
Atty. Gen. John Mitchell approved the
budget for campaign "dirty tricks."
Appearing at the Senate Watergate
hearings, Mardian said he was with
Mitchell and deputy Nixon campaign
director Jeb Stuart Magruder only
hours after the June 17,1972 break-in
was discovered at the Democratic
National Headquarters.
Mardian said Magruder told him
then that Mitchell had approved the
budget for dirty tricks.
"Did Mitchell confirm that?" asked
committee counsel James Hamilton.
"I think the subject was discussed
and he didn't deny it," Mardian
answered.
Yesterday's hearings featured a
bizarre telephone hoax that briefly

had committee members believing
they had avoided a potentially
explosive confrontation with the
White House.
Sen. Sam J. Ervin Jr. (D-N.C.), the
committee chairman, announced that
Treasury Secretary George Shultz had
called him to say that President Nixon
was releasing tapes of his White House
conversations to the committee.
Ervin commended the President on
his "very wise decision."
But within a few minutes, an
embarrassed but amused Ervin had to
retract his announcement.
"It appears a hoax has been
perpetrated up on this committee, at
least upon the chairman of the
committee," Ervin said.
Erroneous Assumption
He said he simply assumed it was
Shultz on the other end of the

confidential Senate line. It wasn't.
Committee aides checked the
surprise "Shultz" statement with
Presidential counsel Leonard Garment,
who denied it. Later, the real Shultz
spoke with Ervin, assuring him that
the call was a hoax. The FBI will
investigate the call.
The Wnite House is still mulling the
committee's request for access to the
tapes, press secretary Ronald Ziegler
said yesterday. President Nixon will
frame a reply to the request this
weekend.
Tapes A Bombshell
The revelation Monday that the
tapes of Nixon's conversations existed
dropped a bombshell into the hearings.
Federal Aviation Administration
head Alexander P. Butterfield, a
former aide to ousted domestic
counselor John Ehrlichman, revealed
he had supervised installation of the
recording devices three years ago.
Mardian's testimony yesterday
challenged Mitchell's denials that he
had approved any bugging activities.
Mardian said he was in Inelewood
Calif, with Mitchell and Magruder
when they heard of the arrests at the
Watergate apart ment-hotel-off ice
complex.
It was here, Mardian said, that the
discussions about Mitchell's role took
place.
'Some Kind Of Nut'
Mardian said Magruder told him
that G. Gordon Liddy, one of those
arrested that morning, was "some kind
of nut, he should have suspected that
something like this would happen."
Before Mardian took the stand,
former Nixon campaign aide Frederick
C. Laßue, who has pleaded guilty to
charges stemming from the Watergate,
ended his two days on the stand.
Laßue told the senators how he
helped arrange payments of White
House and campaign cash to Watergate
defendants and their lawyers.
Both Aware
He said that during one March,
1973 meeting with Mitchell and
then-Presidential Counsel John W.
Dean 111, it was evident that both were

aware of the Watergate cover-up.
Laßue testified earlier that at a
March 30, 1972 meeting, Mitchell had
deferred action on Liddy's bugging
