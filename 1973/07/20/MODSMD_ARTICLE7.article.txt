# Ex-Stanford Radical In Court
## 
### 
James Edward (Jimmy) Johnson
Jr., 29, the radical former Stanford
student who disappeared for two and a
half years, will appear in Palo
Alto-Mountain View Municipal Court
today on a probation violation charge.
Johnson was taken into custody by
FBI agents in Puerto Rico last May,
and was extradited to Santa Clara
County last Sunday.
Besides the probation violation
charge, Johnson faces charges of
assault and battery on a Santa Clara
County peace officer, possession of
dangerous devices in San Mateo
County, and possession of illegal
explosives at a "bomb factory"
authorities claim he operated in the
Santa Cruz Mountains.
A pretrial hearing has been set for
Aug. 7 in San Jose on the Santa Clara
County charge, which stems from an
incident during a demonstration at the
Old Union here.
The trial itself has been scheduled
for Aug. 20. No judge has yet been
named to hear the case.
Thomas Edward Mosher, a former
campus radical, implicated Johnson in
several arson fires and attempted
bombings in 1971 testimony before
the U.S. Senate Internal Security
Subcommittee.
Mosher contended that Johnson
had participated in a 1970 bombing at
the Marin County Courthouse, a 1970
fire at the Behavioral Sciences Center
on the hills above Stanford, and an
attempted bombing of the building
housing the Palo Alto FBI office.
Today's hearing concerns a 1969
charge of malicious mischief. Johnson
was sentenced to 16 months probation
on the charge, but his probation was
revoked shortly before he disappeared
in early 1971.
Judge Sidney Feinberg will hear the
case at 10 a.m. at the North County
Courthouse in Palo Alto.
Johnson is currently being held in
San Jose in lieu of $5000 bail.
