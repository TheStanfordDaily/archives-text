# Imperialism On Both Ends
## U.S. Foreign Aid Selfishly Motivated

■•■•■•••■•■•■•■•■•■•■•■•■•■•■• a*

Craig Roberts' two articles (July 10 and
13) criticizing West African marketing boards
for corruption and unfair taxation were
interesting, but his conclusion concerning the
supposed hypocritical collusion of "the West's
own anti-Western intellectuals," of whom he
singles out Gunnar Myrdal, does not follow
therefrom.
That corrupt foreign governments use the
charge of U.S. imperialism as a mask for their
own criminal activities is no reason to copy
them and mask our responsibility by blaming
everything on them.
The evidence for our imperialism, or
unenlightened self(ish)-interest, stands on its
own feet, untouched by Mr. Roberts, and is
"voluminous," as he says. What he says about
government having its own interests apart
from the "public interest" applies equally well
to the U.S. as to foreign governments.
Moreover, if Mr. Roberts is right about
African government leaders, the "products of
Western universities," being unsympathetic to
their own culture, what kind of sympathy will
Westerners trained in Western universities have
for the Third World?
Motive For Aid
Thus the West may be outdone in
imperialism by its proteges, but this is usually
ignored as long as we get ours. On the other
hand, Mr. Roberts is quite correct in
criticizing "guilt" as a motive for foreign aid,
but this should not mean a return to either
isolationism or selfishly-motivated foreign aid.
If foreign aid is to be of positive, lasting

value it must be motivated by simple
humanitarianism and the ideal of equality for
all on which our country was founded.
I also think Mr. Roberts has misread
Gunnar Myrdal. In The Challenge of World
Poverty, the sequel and policy summary of
Asian Drama, Mr. Myrdal expounds his idea of
the "hard" and "soft" state not in terms of
totalitarianism, as Roberts implies, but of
corruption as a major cause of the continued
poverty of the masses.
Myrdal criticizes therein corruption not
only in developing nations, including African
ones, but also in the U.S. government and
among U.S. business firms.
Insincerity Fostered
The latter corruption is tied to that in
developing countries both directly and
indirectly, i.e., through fostering the attitude
of insincerity.
Indeed, Mr. Myrdal concludes that all
countries, both developed and
underdeveloped, should share the same
interest in "stamping out corruption in high
places, and in ending the type of oligarchic
power monopoly, which is the germinating
bed of corruption."
This corruption in turn leads to the lack of
social or moral discipline which Myrdal
attacks in the "soft" state.
But instead of therefore abolishing foreign
aid and distrusting those "do-gooder"
"anti-Western .. . advocates of world
government" (who borrowed the term
imperialism from Lenin!), we should rather

Tim Knaak

use our foreign aid to promote reforms which
will benefit the masses, rather than
concentrating so much on anti-Communism
that we support repressive governments, as in
South Vietnam and Greece.
Attaching Strings
Besides such political motivations, Mr.
Myrdal also criticises the practice of tying aid
to concessions for U.S. exports. The very idea
of aiding underdeveloped nations is a
commendable innovation, but it is only
propaganda for economic and political
imperialism if polluted by short-sighted
self-interest at the expense of simple
compassion and idealism.
I should add that Myrdal does not use the
term imperialism, but does point to the
reluctance of the West to live up to its ideals
and its resistance to organizations like
UNCTAD, which Mr. Roberts also finds so
objectionable.
Mr. Myrdal notes the existence, however,
in some quarters at least, of "enlightened"
businessmen and government leaders. Since
the species does exist, we should do all we can
to increase that group and further their work.
Such will provide a more stable peaceful
world than any amount of military
expenditure for the "balance of power"
(terror) or than temporary economic
supremacy.

bed of corruption."
This corruption in turn leads to the lack of
social or moral discipline which Myrdal
attacks in the "soft" state.
But instead of therefore abolishing foreign
aid and distrusting those "do-gooder"
"anti-Western .. . advocates of world
government" (who borrowed the term
imperialism from Lenin!), we should rather

Tim Knaak

use our foreign aid to promote reforms which
will benefit the masses, rather than
concentrating so much on anti-Communism
that we support repressive governments, as in
South Vietnam and Greece.
Attaching Strings
Besides such political motivations, Mr.
Myrdal also criticises the practice of tying aid
to concessions for U.S. exports. The very idea
of aiding underdeveloped nations is a
commendable innovation, but it is only
propaganda for economic and political
imperialism if polluted by short-sighted
self-interest at the expense of simple
compassion and idealism.
I should add that Myrdal does not use the
term imperialism, but does point to the
reluctance of the West to live up to its ideals
and its resistance to organizations like
UNCTAD, which Mr. Roberts also finds so
objectionable.
Mr. Myrdal notes the existence, however,
in some quarters at least, of "enlightened"
businessmen and government leaders. Since
the species does exist, we should do all we can
to increase that group and further their work.
Such will provide a more stable peaceful
world than any amount of military
expenditure for the "balance of power"
(terror) or than temporary economic
supremacy.

Craig Roberts' two articles (July 10 and
13) criticizing West African marketing boards
for corruption and unfair taxation were
interesting, but his conclusion concerning the
supposed hypocritical collusion of "the West's
own anti-Western intellectuals," of whom he
singles out Gunnar Myrdal, does not follow
therefrom.
That corrupt foreign governments use the
charge of U.S. imperialism as a mask for their
own criminal activities is no reason to copy
them and mask our responsibility by blaming
everything on them.
The evidence for our imperialism, or
unenlightened self(ish)-interest, stands on its
own feet, untouched by Mr. Roberts, and is
"voluminous," as he says. What he says about
government having its own interests apart
from the "public interest" applies equally well
to the U.S. as to foreign governments.
Moreover, if Mr. Roberts is right about
African government leaders, the "products of
Western universities," being unsympathetic to
their own culture, what kind of sympathy will
Westerners trained in Western universities have
for the Third World?
Motive For Aid
Thus the West may be outdone in
imperialism by its proteges, but this is usually
ignored as long as we get ours. On the other
hand, Mr. Roberts is quite correct in
criticizing "guilt" as a motive for foreign aid,
but this should not mean a return to either
isolationism or selfishly-motivated foreign aid.
If foreign aid is to be of positive, lasting

value it must be motivated by simple
humanitarianism and the ideal of equality for
all on which our country was founded.
I also think Mr. Roberts has misread
Gunnar Myrdal. In The Challenge of World
Poverty, the sequel and policy summary of
Asian Drama, Mr. Myrdal expounds his idea of
the "hard" and "soft" state not in terms of
totalitarianism, as Roberts implies, but of
corruption as a major cause of the continued
poverty of the masses.
Myrdal criticizes therein corruption not
only in developing nations, including African
ones, but also in the U.S. government and
among U.S. business firms.
Insincerity Fostered
The latter corruption is tied to that in
developing countries both directly and
indirectly, i.e., through fostering the attitude
of insincerity.
Indeed, Mr. Myrdal concludes that all
countries, both developed and
underdeveloped, should share the same
interest in "stamping out corruption in high
places, and in ending the type of oligarchic
power monopoly, which is the germinating
bed of corruption."
This corruption in turn leads to the lack of
social or moral discipline which Myrdal
attacks in the "soft" state.
But instead of therefore abolishing foreign
aid and distrusting those "do-gooder"
"anti-Western .. . advocates of world
government" (who borrowed the term
imperialism from Lenin!), we should rather
