# University's Archives Preserve Mixture Of Trivia And Treasure
## 
### GLENN ZORN 
An invaluable information source
and a treasury of trivia.
Such is the University Archives,
which house the only complete
collection of documents written at or
about the University.
The rapidly-growing Archives
occupies two rooms on the third floor
of the Main Library and a large
portion of the basement.
Old guides, campus publications,
and telephone directories — even a
complete collection of the thousands
of doctoral theses written here — all
can be found in locked bound volumes
in the low-ceilinged basement, which
requires two keys to enter.
Historian's Tool
The myriad resources of the
Archives are, of course, an invaluable
reference tool for anyone studying
local history, searching for specific
studies done in the past, or seeking
specific information about the
University.
For example, many of the studies
done by various University
departments are housed in the
basement, and are frequently
requested by students and faculty
members.
Also, the Archives are frequently
used by students enrolled in SWOPSI
and SCIRE courses, many of which
deal with the University's past and
present role in society.
Browsers Welcome
But while scholars peruse important
factual material, casual visitors are
invited to browse through the many
interesting collections.
A tour of the Archives begins with
the Reading Room. This room is
furnished with Victorian pieces
donated by Timothy Hopkins, one of
the first Stanford trustees.
The furniture includes chairs, which
are beautifully carved with faces of
strange monsters, as well as a huge
mirror also decorated with elaborate
carvings.

A roll top desk that once belonged
to David Starr Jordan, the University's
first president, is kept in the Reading
Room. Many of Jordan's works are
preserved on microfilm.
An old slide projector donated by
the brother of Leland Stanford is also
contained in this room. The projector
still works, and still contains the
original light bulb, according to
curator Susan Rosenberg.
Among the articles contained in the
room is a torn banner recalling
Stanford's first intercollegiate football
game: a 14-10 win over archrival
University of California.
University's Memory
If the University has a memory, it is
headquartered in the Work Room,
next door to the Reading Room.
All the Dailys and Quads (the
now-defunct school yearbook) are
kept there, as well as various maps and
photographs.
Some of the photographs date back

to the founding of the University, and
thus have monetary as well as
sentimental value.
While there were no official
University Archives until 1966, a
Stanford Collection has been kept and
expanded since the 1891 founding of
the University.
Controversy rocked the
usually-quiet Archives in December,
1971, when confidential
administration documents were
apparently stolen from sealed archive
files.
The documents revealed the stormy
University history of renowned
Marxist economist Paul Baran, who
taught here from 1948 until his death
in 1964. Letters and memos in the
files revealed alumni complaints and
threats in reaction to Baran's socialist
views.
In the past year, Rosenberg says,
the Archives have been used by far
more scholars than ever before.
