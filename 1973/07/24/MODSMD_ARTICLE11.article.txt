# Film Traces Rocky Relationship
## 
### ELLEN KENESHEA 
Paul Mazursky wrote,
produced, directed and acts in his
latest film, Blume in Love but it is
George Segal, as Blume, who
holds it all together.
The film is a felicitous
combination of its
writer/producer/director and his
leading actor, and a pleasant
lesson in modern romance and
sentimental love.
Like the hero in Mazursky's
last film, Alex in Wonderland
Blume gets tangled up between
starry-eyed visions of what he
wishes for and what he has. But
Alex forced a cuteness that made
it awkward and cold while Blume
in Love whatever its
shortcomings, is a warm-hearted
film.
Blume is also aggressively
old-fashioned and romantic in its
attitudes, for in spite of the fact
that Blume's ex-wife Nina (Susan
Anspach) chooses to abandon
marriage for autonomy, in the end
she returns to the fold via
motherhood.
And although Blume makes
harried attempts at "swinging,"
what he wants is a nice wife and a
nice family to come home to.
Living Together?
"The trouble is," Blume
philosophizes, "that people who
live together are always waiting to
stop living together and get
married so they can really start
living together."
Blume's marriage didn't fulfill
all expectations; it's just that he
realizes after Nina has gone that
she's the only woman he'll ever
love, so he has to get her back.
The film begins after Blume
has made his play for
reconciliation and awaits Nina's

decision. His story unfolds in
flashback from their first meeting
to their last, perhaps a year after
their break-up, and traces the
course of a relationship in a
poignant, insightful, and often
very funny way.
Emotional Encounters
Blume is a divorce lawyer in
Beverly Hills. Nina a social
worker. Each of them sees all
kinds and ends of relationships
and director Mazursky gets to
play off their own wants and
dilemma against society's shifting
values and patterns.
Mazursky carries this off with a
light handed feel for emotions
under stress and for brief
encounters between strangers.
Shelley Winters appears for one
such cameo, a distraught wealthy
housewife with a roving husband
who can't seem to get on an
airplane without taking off with
one of the stewardesses. As
Blume's legal partner, however,
Mazursky himself is not so
amusing and his scenes verge on
the extraneous.
Creditable Performances
As Nina, Anspach does well
scene for scene. But her character
lacks real coherence, a fault as
much due to flaws in the
screenplay as well as in her own
performance.
Kris Kristofferson is
exceptionally fine as her lover,
and performs much better than
one would expect judging from
his recent performance in Pat
Garrett and Billy the Kid.
But the film belongs to Segal,
and rightfully so. His Blume is an
absurdly funny and yet wholly
serious man, cockey and
distraught, unsure and cynical,
and finally lovable because he is

so utterly hopeful in the midst of
disaster. Segal captures every
nuance and mood of his character
and does much more than justice
to Mazursky's excellent script.
Sensitive Direction
Blume in Love is some minutes
too long and rambles a bit here
and there, but except for this
Mazursky has fashioned his film
with a keen eye for both the zany
and the touching, and has kept

both characters and episodes
under control. He has also used
music — from Wagner to
Kristofferson's own songs — well
and comically throughout.
It's possible to disagree with
some of the attitudes and
implications of Blume in Love,
but it's difficult not to become
involved with its engaging people
or to smile at its appropriate
ending.

JUNGLE THEATER CONCERT Taj Mahal entertained a Marine World audience last Saturday night in
an outdoor concert. He performed as a special guest along with Donny Hathaway. Taj recently gained
notoriety for his music for the sound track of the film "Sounder." This weekend's Marine World concert
features Cold Blood and El Roacho. If reviewer's reports describing the temperature in the Jungle Theater
on a Saturday night are accurate, all the cold blood at Marine World won't be on stage.

Mazursky carries this off with a
light handed feel for emotions
under stress and for brief
encounters between strangers.
Shelley Winters appears for one
such cameo, a distraught wealthy
housewife with a roving husband
who can't seem to get on an
airplane without taking off with
one of the stewardesses. As
Blume's legal partner, however,
Mazursky himself is not so
amusing and his scenes verge on
the extraneous.
Creditable Performances
As Nina, Anspach does well
scene for scene. But her character
lacks real coherence, a fault as
much due to flaws in the
screenplay as well as in her own
performance.
Kris Kristofferson is
exceptionally fine as her lover,
and performs much better than
one would expect judging from
his recent performance in Pat
Garrett and Billy the Kid.
But the film belongs to Segal,
and rightfully so. His Blume is an
absurdly funny and yet wholly
serious man, cockey and
distraught, unsure and cynical,
and finally lovable because he is

so utterly hopeful in the midst of
disaster. Segal captures every
nuance and mood of his character
and does much more than justice
to Mazursky's excellent script.
Sensitive Direction
Blume in Love is some minutes
too long and rambles a bit here
and there, but except for this
Mazursky has fashioned his film
with a keen eye for both the zany
and the touching, and has kept

both characters and episodes
under control. He has also used
music — from Wagner to
Kristofferson's own songs — well
and comically throughout.
It's possible to disagree with
some of the attitudes and
implications of Blume in Love,
but it's difficult not to become
involved with its engaging people
or to smile at its appropriate
ending.

JUNGLE THEATER CONCERT Taj Mahal entertained a Marine World audience last Saturday night in
an outdoor concert. He performed as a special guest along with Donny Hathaway. Taj recently gained
notoriety for his music for the sound track of the film "Sounder." This weekend's Marine World concert
features Cold Blood and El Roacho. If reviewer's reports describing the temperature in the Jungle Theater
on a Saturday night are accurate, all the cold blood at Marine World won't be on stage.
Paul Mazursky wrote,
produced, directed and acts in his
latest film, Blume in Love but it is
George Segal, as Blume, who
holds it all together.
The film is a felicitous
combination of its
writer/producer/director and his
leading actor, and a pleasant
lesson in modern romance and
sentimental love.
Like the hero in Mazursky's
last film, Alex in Wonderland
Blume gets tangled up between
starry-eyed visions of what he
wishes for and what he has. But
Alex forced a cuteness that made
it awkward and cold while Blume
in Love whatever its
shortcomings, is a warm-hearted
film.
Blume is also aggressively
old-fashioned and romantic in its
attitudes, for in spite of the fact
that Blume's ex-wife Nina (Susan
Anspach) chooses to abandon
marriage for autonomy, in the end
she returns to the fold via
motherhood.
And although Blume makes
harried attempts at "swinging,"
what he wants is a nice wife and a
nice family to come home to.
Living Together?
"The trouble is," Blume
philosophizes, "that people who
live together are always waiting to
stop living together and get
married so they can really start
living together."
Blume's marriage didn't fulfill
all expectations; it's just that he
realizes after Nina has gone that
she's the only woman he'll ever
love, so he has to get her back.
The film begins after Blume
has made his play for
reconciliation and awaits Nina's

decision. His story unfolds in
flashback from their first meeting
to their last, perhaps a year after
their break-up, and traces the
course of a relationship in a
poignant, insightful, and often
very funny way.
Emotional Encounters
Blume is a divorce lawyer in
Beverly Hills. Nina a social
worker. Each of them sees all
kinds and ends of relationships
and director Mazursky gets to
play off their own wants and
dilemma against society's shifting
values and patterns.
Mazursky carries this off with a
light handed feel for emotions
under stress and for brief
encounters between strangers.
Shelley Winters appears for one
