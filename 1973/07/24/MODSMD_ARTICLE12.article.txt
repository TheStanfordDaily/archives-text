# Asleep At The Wheel Delights Local Fans
## 
### BRADLEY DICKINSON 
Judging from the truck-to-car
ratio in the parking lot and the
scant attendance, only hard-core
Asleep at the Wheel fans turned
out to catch the group at Homer's
Warehouse last Wednesday.
Asleep, which takes second
billing to the likes of Commander
Cody or Jerry Garcia, delighted a
group of country-western fanatics
with tunes from their recent
album and their repertoire of old
standards.
The evening's warm-up band
was Knee Deep, a group of
rockers from Berkeley who had a
hard time getting it together for
an audience likely tobe apathetic
toward any group lacking a fiddle
or pedal steel guitar. Their second
set was mercifully short, and not
too bad.
Asleep is a technically
accomplished group with a lot of
personality in lead Ray Benson
and drummer Leroy Preston.
"Lucky 0" Gosfield is
outstanding on the pedal steel and

Floyd Domino is an
underdeveloped asset on piano.
Much of the group's appeal
comes from Chris O'Connell, a
fine female singer and rhythm
guitarist. Chris had a tough time
warming up to the small audience,
a disappointment to those who
have seen her on more inspiring
occasions. But she radiated the
aura of a satin-bloused country
girl, and her vocals brought down
the house.
And although Preston never
got around to his tell-it-all version
of "Hillbilly Nut," it was a
satisfying evening at Homer's.
Local fans can look forward to
a return appearance of Asleep at
the Wheel when they appear on
Tuesday at Homer's with Old and
In the Way, a bluegrass band built
around Jerry Garcia's banjo and
featuring some very fine mandolin
pickin' and fiddlin', as well as the
three-part vocal harmony that is
Garcia's trademark.
KZSU will broadcast the
concert live from the Warehouse.
