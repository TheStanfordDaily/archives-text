Steeleye Span: "Parcel of
Rogues" (Chrysalis CHR 1046)
Steeleye Span (not to be
confused with Steely Dan), who
appeared with Jethro Tull last
night at the Oakland Coliseum, is
a British quintet that delivers
authentic English folksongs in
electric soft-rock arrangements.
If you haven't heard Steeleye
Span, listen to their latest album
before jumping to the conclusion
that this unique folk-rock
combination is a bizarre union of
the Karen Carpenter school of
good, clean rock and the Irish
Roverish renditions of old-time
folk music.
And if you fear that the purity
of the authentic, original ballads
might be compromised by the
slick vitality of contemporary
rock, "Parcel of Rogues" will
prove that you're about half
wrong.
The group is at its best when
performing the rowdy, irresistible
tunes that make you want to
hurry down to the village pub for

a tankard of ale and the company
of a winsome wench. Although
Steeleye Span performs
noticeably without a drummer,
some fine bass guitar keeps the
momentum going.
The voices of female lead
singer Maddy Prior and fiddle- and
mandolin-player Peter Knight
complement each other
effectively throughout the album.
Prior's clear, bright,
unmistakable-British soprano is
especially enjoyable as she solos in
"One Misty Moisty Morning."
Knight's hearty, more
down-to-earth sound comes across
well in ribald, story-telling ballads.
Steeleye Span began originally
in 1969 as an offshoot of
Freeport Convention. The present
four-man one woman
combination has been together
since 1971.
If nothing else, the lyrics are,
well — er — imaginative. After a
deluge of bubble-gum romances
and mascara rock, it is refreshing
to hear Knight vow to Alison
Gross — "the ugliest witch in the
north country" — that "he won't
kiss her ugly mouth for all the
gifts you could give me." Included
in the "Parcel of Rogues" are such
colorful characters as "The Wee
Wee Man," "The Weaver and the
Factory Maid," and a pack of
women who "run like hares on
the mountain."
Guitarist Bob Johnson
comments, "The thing about
folk-songs is their timelessness.
Put them in a modern setting and
they become of modern
consequence, of modern
relevance."
Steeleye Span should take care
to avoid such hints at "heaviness"
however. "Rogues in a Nation"
sounds like a funeral dirge, and
when the group sacrifices its lusty,
vitality for "relevance" the result
is not relevance but boredom.
Nevertheless, some fine, rowdy
cuts make "Parcel of Rogues" and
Steeleye Span worth listening to,
and perhaps deserving of more
attention than they currently are
receiving. Which way to the village
pub?

Put them in a modern setting and
they become of modern
consequence, of modern
relevance."
Steeleye Span should take care
to avoid such hints at "heaviness"
however. "Rogues in a Nation"
sounds like a funeral dirge, and
when the group sacrifices its lusty,
vitality for "relevance" the result
is not relevance but boredom.
Nevertheless, some fine, rowdy
cuts make "Parcel of Rogues" and
Steeleye Span worth listening to,

attention than they currently are
receiving. Which way to the village

Steeleye Span: "Parcel of
Rogues" (Chrysalis CHR 1046)
Steeleye Span (not to be
confused with Steely Dan), who
appeared with Jethro Tull last
night at the Oakland Coliseum, is
a British quintet that delivers
authentic English folksongs in
electric soft-rock arrangements.
If you haven't heard Steeleye
Span, listen to their latest album
before jumping to the conclusion
that this unique folk-rock
combination is a bizarre union of
the Karen Carpenter school of
good, clean rock and the Irish
Roverish renditions of old-time
folk music.
And if you fear that the purity
of the authentic, original ballads
might be compromised by the
slick vitality of contemporary
rock, "Parcel of Rogues" will
prove that you're about half
wrong.
The group is at its best when
performing the rowdy, irresistible
tunes that make you want to
hurry down to the village pub for

a tankard of ale and the company
of a winsome wench. Although
Steeleye Span performs
noticeably without a drummer,
some fine bass guitar keeps the
momentum going.
The voices of female lead
singer Maddy Prior and fiddle- and
mandolin-player Peter Knight
complement each other
effectively throughout the album.
Prior's clear, bright,
unmistakable-British soprano is
especially enjoyable as she solos in
"One Misty Moisty Morning."
Knight's hearty, more
down-to-earth sound comes across
well in ribald, story-telling ballads.
Steeleye Span began originally
in 1969 as an offshoot of
Freeport Convention. The present
four-man one woman
combination has been together
since 1971.
If nothing else, the lyrics are,
well — er — imaginative. After a
deluge of bubble-gum romances
and mascara rock, it is refreshing
to hear Knight vow to Alison
Gross — "the ugliest witch in the
north country" — that "he won't
kiss her ugly mouth for all the
gifts you could give me." Included
in the "Parcel of Rogues" are such
colorful characters as "The Wee
Wee Man," "The Weaver and the
Factory Maid," and a pack of
women who "run like hares on
the mountain."
Guitarist Bob Johnson
comments, "The thing about
folk-songs is their timelessness.
Put them in a modern setting and
they become of modern
consequence, of modern
relevance."
