Eddie Riekenbacker Dies
ZURICH — World War I Ace Capt. Eddie Rickenbacker
died yesterday of a heart ailment at the age of 82.
Rickenbacker, winner of the Congressional Medal of
Honor for shooting down 26 German aircraft in combat
against the Red Baron's "Flying Circus," served in Europe
as an auto driver for Gen. John Pershing before pushing
his way into the air corps. He led the famed "Hat in the
Ring" American fighter squadron.
Swiss hospital spokesmen did not release details of the
official cause of Rickenbacker's death, but sources say he
died of a heart attack.
The aviation pioneer, who * lived the adventure of
aviation from the cloth-covered planes of World War I to
the jetliners he supervised as board chairman of Eastern
Airlines, was a native of Columbus, Ohio.
Hijacked Jet In Damascus
DAMASCUS — Hijackers who commandeered a Japan
Airlines jumbo jet 747 over Western Europe Friday
continued the marathon hijacking yesterday by ordering
that the plane be refueled for departure from the Persian
Gulf shiekdom of Dubai.
The jet landed in Damascus yesterday with 148
hostages still on board, after being denied permission to
land in Baghdad and Cairo. It later left Damascus and was
reported to have headed towards Turkey.
Airport officials say at least 15 women and one child
are among the mostly-Japanese passengers. Hijackers have
ignored pleas asking them to release the women and
children.
The refueling was ordered after the hijackers received
what was believed to be a coded message from West
Germany relayed through the Dubai government.
The communique, signed by "13,569 inhabitants of
West Germany," asked the hijackers to free the passengers
or kill them, but urged the guerillas to give up the
hostages, pointing out that there were other non-violent
means of achieving their political aims.
40 Dead In St. Louis Plane Crash
ST. LOUIS — Forty persons died yesterday in the crash of
an Ozark Airlines turbo-prop jet near St. Louis.
The plane had flown a two-stop route from Nashville,
Tenn. to Marion, 111. and was headed for an instrument
landing in St. Louis when the crash occurred. Forty-five
persons, including three crew members, were aboard the
aircraft.
The plane narrowly missed the campus of the
University of Missouri, as pieces of the wreckage struck a
house across the street.
One witness said he saw lightning strike the plane just
before it crashed. If the report is valid, it would mean
only the second time that a plane crash has been
definitely caused by lightning.
Meanwhile, only one person is known to have survived
the crash of a Pan American Airways jet which crashed
Sunday night shortly after takeoff from Tahiti.
The Boeing 707 cartwheeled into the sea with 69
passengers and 10 crew members aboard, moments after
the pilot reported a smashed windshield and attempted an
emergency landing.
The aircraft was on route from Auckland, New
Zealand, to San Francisco.
The single survivor has been tentatively identified as a
"Mr. Campbell" from Canada. A stewardess also found
alive died on the way to the hospital. Officials say there is
little hope that any other survivors will be found.

Food Prices Continue To Rise
SACRAMENTO — Higher prices for eggs, poultry and
pork marked the first day in the first full week of Phase
Four regulations yesterday.
Egg prices skyrocketed up 12 cents a dozen in certain
areas. Phase Four regulations ended price freezes on foods
except for beef.
Grocers across the nation report shortages of some
products and expect more price increases to follow
yesterday's expected hikes. Some of the shortages were
caused by consumers who went on buying sprees last
weekend in anticipation of the price increases, grocers say.
State food and agricultural director C.B. Christensen
said yesterday that California's bumper harvest this year
won't help the consumer. California farmers have
operated at a loss during the freeze and will have to
increase prices to "catch up," he explained. Unofficial
estimates predict a 15 percent price increase for
foodstuffs, Christensen revealed.
Cannery Strike Settled
SAN FRANCISCO — A four-day walkout by 65,000
cannery workers ended yesterday with an agreement on a
new three-year contract between the packers and the
Teamsters Union.
The strike threatened to drive up prices for processed
fruits and vegetables. However, the settlement, calling for
a s'/ 2 percent wage hike and the gradual end of the six-day
work week, may actually force similar increases in
processed food prices, canning officials say.
In another Bay Area labor dispute, Bay Area Rapid
Transit (BART) negotiators met in a strategy session
yesterday, but no new negotiations have been scheduled
in the three-week-old strike.
Whitehead Resignation Reported
NEW YORK — Clay T. Whitehead, director of the White
House Office of Telecommunications Policy will resign
from his post shortly, New York Magazine reported
yesterday.
According to the report, administration sources have
disclosed that Whitehead's resignation will end White
House attempts to "frighten the [television] networks
and independent stations into being friendlier with the
Nixon administration.
The report also said that the White House was
undecided whether to name a successor to Whitehead or
to abolish the telecommunications office.
Whitehead gained notoriety last year when he
suggested that local stations refuse to run "biased"
network news.

muscle.
Cloudy, Then Fair
Bay Area Weather Forecast calls for early morning low
clouds, clearing later in the day for fair weather through
Thursday. Daytime high temperatures will range from the
low to mid 80's, mid 60's near the coast. Low

the crash of a Pan American Airways jet which crashed
Sunday night shortly after takeoff from Tahiti.
The Boeing 707 cartwheeled into the sea with 69
passengers and 10 crew members aboard, moments after
the pilot reported a smashed windshield and attempted an
emergency landing.
The aircraft was on route from Auckland, New
Zealand, to San Francisco.
The single survivor has been tentatively identified as a
"Mr. Campbell" from Canada. A stewardess also found
alive died on the way to the hospital. Officials say there is
little hope that any other survivors will be found.

Food Prices Continue To Rise
SACRAMENTO — Higher prices for eggs, poultry and
pork marked the first day in the first full week of Phase
Four regulations yesterday.
Egg prices skyrocketed up 12 cents a dozen in certain
areas. Phase Four regulations ended price freezes on foods
except for beef.
Grocers across the nation report shortages of some
products and expect more price increases to follow
yesterday's expected hikes. Some of the shortages were
caused by consumers who went on buying sprees last
weekend in anticipation of the price increases, grocers say.
State food and agricultural director C.B. Christensen
said yesterday that California's bumper harvest this year
won't help the consumer. California farmers have
operated at a loss during the freeze and will have to
increase prices to "catch up," he explained. Unofficial
estimates predict a 15 percent price increase for
foodstuffs, Christensen revealed.
Cannery Strike Settled
SAN FRANCISCO — A four-day walkout by 65,000
cannery workers ended yesterday with an agreement on a
new three-year contract between the packers and the
Teamsters Union.
The strike threatened to drive up prices for processed
fruits and vegetables. However, the settlement, calling for
a s'/ 2 percent wage hike and the gradual end of the six-day
work week, may actually force similar increases in
processed food prices, canning officials say.
In another Bay Area labor dispute, Bay Area Rapid
Transit (BART) negotiators met in a strategy session
yesterday, but no new negotiations have been scheduled
in the three-week-old strike.
Whitehead Resignation Reported
NEW YORK — Clay T. Whitehead, director of the White
House Office of Telecommunications Policy will resign
from his post shortly, New York Magazine reported
yesterday.
According to the report, administration sources have
disclosed that Whitehead's resignation will end White
House attempts to "frighten the [television] networks
and independent stations into being friendlier with the
Nixon administration.
The report also said that the White House was
undecided whether to name a successor to Whitehead or
to abolish the telecommunications office.
Whitehead gained notoriety last year when he
suggested that local stations refuse to run "biased"
network news.

Eddie Riekenbacker Dies
ZURICH — World War I Ace Capt. Eddie Rickenbacker
died yesterday of a heart ailment at the age of 82.
Rickenbacker, winner of the Congressional Medal of
Honor for shooting down 26 German aircraft in combat
against the Red Baron's "Flying Circus," served in Europe
as an auto driver for Gen. John Pershing before pushing
his way into the air corps. He led the famed "Hat in the
Ring" American fighter squadron.
Swiss hospital spokesmen did not release details of the
official cause of Rickenbacker's death, but sources say he
died of a heart attack.
The aviation pioneer, who * lived the adventure of
aviation from the cloth-covered planes of World War I to
the jetliners he supervised as board chairman of Eastern
Airlines, was a native of Columbus, Ohio.
Hijacked Jet In Damascus
DAMASCUS — Hijackers who commandeered a Japan
Airlines jumbo jet 747 over Western Europe Friday
continued the marathon hijacking yesterday by ordering
that the plane be refueled for departure from the Persian
Gulf shiekdom of Dubai.
The jet landed in Damascus yesterday with 148
hostages still on board, after being denied permission to
land in Baghdad and Cairo. It later left Damascus and was
reported to have headed towards Turkey.
Airport officials say at least 15 women and one child
are among the mostly-Japanese passengers. Hijackers have
ignored pleas asking them to release the women and
children.
The refueling was ordered after the hijackers received
what was believed to be a coded message from West
Germany relayed through the Dubai government.
The communique, signed by "13,569 inhabitants of
West Germany," asked the hijackers to free the passengers
or kill them, but urged the guerillas to give up the
hostages, pointing out that there were other non-violent
means of achieving their political aims.
40 Dead In St. Louis Plane Crash
ST. LOUIS — Forty persons died yesterday in the crash of
an Ozark Airlines turbo-prop jet near St. Louis.
The plane had flown a two-stop route from Nashville,
Tenn. to Marion, 111. and was headed for an instrument
landing in St. Louis when the crash occurred. Forty-five
persons, including three crew members, were aboard the
aircraft.
The plane narrowly missed the campus of the
University of Missouri, as pieces of the wreckage struck a
house across the street.
One witness said he saw lightning strike the plane just
before it crashed. If the report is valid, it would mean
only the second time that a plane crash has been

Hunter, Wise Vie For All-Stars
KANSAS CITY — Jim Hunter of Oakland and Rick Wise
of St. Louis will be the starting pitchers for today's 46th
All-Star Game. Chris Speier of San Francisco will start at
shortstop for the National League, but will play only
three innings at most. He is suffering from a torn shoulder
muscle.
Cloudy, Then Fair
Bay Area Weather Forecast calls for early morning low
clouds, clearing later in the day for fair weather through
Thursday. Daytime high temperatures will range from the
low to mid 80's, mid 60's near the coast. Low
temperatures may reach the 50's. Light afternoon winds
10-20 mph.
Eddie Riekenbacker Dies
ZURICH — World War I Ace Capt. Eddie Rickenbacker
died yesterday of a heart ailment at the age of 82.
Rickenbacker, winner of the Congressional Medal of
Honor for shooting down 26 German aircraft in combat
against the Red Baron's "Flying Circus," served in Europe
as an auto driver for Gen. John Pershing before pushing
his way into the air corps. He led the famed "Hat in the
Ring" American fighter squadron.
Swiss hospital spokesmen did not release details of the
official cause of Rickenbacker's death, but sources say he
died of a heart attack.
The aviation pioneer, who * lived the adventure of
aviation from the cloth-covered planes of World War I to
the jetliners he supervised as board chairman of Eastern
Airlines, was a native of Columbus, Ohio.
Hijacked Jet In Damascus
DAMASCUS — Hijackers who commandeered a Japan
Airlines jumbo jet 747 over Western Europe Friday
continued the marathon hijacking yesterday by ordering
that the plane be refueled for departure from the Persian
Gulf shiekdom of Dubai.
The jet landed in Damascus yesterday with 148
hostages still on board, after being denied permission to
land in Baghdad and Cairo. It later left Damascus and was
reported to have headed towards Turkey.
Airport officials say at least 15 women and one child
are among the mostly-Japanese passengers. Hijackers have
ignored pleas asking them to release the women and
children.
The refueling was ordered after the hijackers received
what was believed to be a coded message from West
Germany relayed through the Dubai government.
The communique, signed by "13,569 inhabitants of
West Germany," asked the hijackers to free the passengers
or kill them, but urged the guerillas to give up the
hostages, pointing out that there were other non-violent
means of achieving their political aims.
40 Dead In St. Louis Plane Crash
ST. LOUIS — Forty persons died yesterday in the crash of
an Ozark Airlines turbo-prop jet near St. Louis.
The plane had flown a two-stop route from Nashville,
Tenn. to Marion, 111. and was headed for an instrument
landing in St. Louis when the crash occurred. Forty-five
persons, including three crew members, were aboard the
aircraft.
The plane narrowly missed the campus of the
University of Missouri, as pieces of the wreckage struck a
house across the street.
One witness said he saw lightning strike the plane just
before it crashed. If the report is valid, it would mean
only the second time that a plane crash has been
definitely caused by lightning.
Meanwhile, only one person is known to have survived
the crash of a Pan American Airways jet which crashed
Sunday night shortly after takeoff from Tahiti.
The Boeing 707 cartwheeled into the sea with 69
passengers and 10 crew members aboard, moments after
the pilot reported a smashed windshield and attempted an
emergency landing.
The aircraft was on route from Auckland, New
Zealand, to San Francisco.
The single survivor has been tentatively identified as a
"Mr. Campbell" from Canada. A stewardess also found
alive died on the way to the hospital. Officials say there is
little hope that any other survivors will be found.

Food Prices Continue To Rise
SACRAMENTO — Higher prices for eggs, poultry and
pork marked the first day in the first full week of Phase
Four regulations yesterday.
Egg prices skyrocketed up 12 cents a dozen in certain
areas. Phase Four regulations ended price freezes on foods
except for beef.
Grocers across the nation report shortages of some
products and expect more price increases to follow
yesterday's expected hikes. Some of the shortages were
caused by consumers who went on buying sprees last
weekend in anticipation of the price increases, grocers say.
State food and agricultural director C.B. Christensen
said yesterday that California's bumper harvest this year
won't help the consumer. California farmers have
operated at a loss during the freeze and will have to
increase prices to "catch up," he explained. Unofficial
estimates predict a 15 percent price increase for
foodstuffs, Christensen revealed.
Cannery Strike Settled
SAN FRANCISCO — A four-day walkout by 65,000
cannery workers ended yesterday with an agreement on a
new three-year contract between the packers and the
Teamsters Union.
The strike threatened to drive up prices for processed
fruits and vegetables. However, the settlement, calling for
a s'/ 2 percent wage hike and the gradual end of the six-day
work week, may actually force similar increases in
processed food prices, canning officials say.
In another Bay Area labor dispute, Bay Area Rapid
Transit (BART) negotiators met in a strategy session
yesterday, but no new negotiations have been scheduled
in the three-week-old strike.
Whitehead Resignation Reported
NEW YORK — Clay T. Whitehead, director of the White
House Office of Telecommunications Policy will resign
from his post shortly, New York Magazine reported
yesterday.
According to the report, administration sources have
disclosed that Whitehead's resignation will end White
House attempts to "frighten the [television] networks
and independent stations into being friendlier with the
Nixon administration.
The report also said that the White House was
undecided whether to name a successor to Whitehead or
to abolish the telecommunications office.
