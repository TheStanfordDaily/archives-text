# NASA Extends Skylab II Mission
## 
### 
National Aeronautics and Space
Agency (NASA) officials announced
Friday they would lengthen the record
56-day Skylab II mission by three
more days.
Program director William C.
Schneider said the extra days were
added for "operation reasons," and
that Johnson Space Center personnel
will keep close watch on the
astronauts' health, especially during
the last half of the mission.
Meanwhile the countdown for the
July 28 launch of Skylab astronauts
Alan L. Bean, Jack R. Lousma, and
Stanford Electrical Engineering Prof.
OwenGarriott rolled along smoothly.
The scheduled practice launch
Friday was completed flawlessly, and
flight crews immediately went to work
draining the 150,000 gallons of
supercold liquid oxygen and liquid
hydrogen from the Saturn IB launch
rocket.
The fuel, pumped into the 224-foot
tall rocket last Thursday for the dress

rehearsal, will be transferred into the
vehicle again this Thursday when the
actual countdown begins.
The astronauts yesterday continued
to work in a mockup of the converted
Apollo moon capsule that will
transport them into orbit.
They will run through a practice
countdown drill of their own
tomorrow using a Skylab simulator in
Houston.
Bean, Lousma, and Garriott will be
the first crew not to have a practice
launch using the actual rocket on Cape
Kennedy since pre-Apollo days.
"The schedule of the flight crew is
such that their time could be used
more efficiently by having them
remain in Houston," launch director
Walter Kapryan said.
Splashdown for Skylab II originally
had been planned for 1200 miles
southwest of San Diego in the Pacific
Ocean. But the new 59-day schedule
will bring the touchdown site to 340
miles southwest of San Diego at 3:26
p.m. PDT Tuesday, Sept. 25.
