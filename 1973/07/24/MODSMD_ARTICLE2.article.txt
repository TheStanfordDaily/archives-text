Special to the Daily
WASHINGTON — President Nixon
yesterday adamantly refused to turn
over copies of White House tapes and
documents to the Senate Watergate
Committee or to special Watergate
prosecutor Archibald Cox.
Nixon also canceled a scheduled
meeting with committee chairman
Sen. Sam J. Ervin Jr. (D-N.C.), stating
it would serve "no useful purpose."
In a letter to Ervin, Nixon said he
himself had listened to the tapes and
they were "entirely consistent with
what I know to be the truth and what
I have stated to be the truth."
But the President said that "persons
with different perspectives and
motivations would inevitably interpret
them in different ways."
The committee unanimously agreed
to issue a subpoena for the tapes and
documents. Cox, describing the
President's decision as "without legal
foundation," said he would also issue a
subpoena.
'Different Interpretation'
Ervin commented, "I have a very
different interpretation of the
Constitution than the President."
He further remarked, "I deeply
regret that this situation has arisen
because I think that the Watergate
tragedy is the greatest tragedy that this
country has ever suffered ... I see no
redeeming features in Watergate.
"A President not only has
constitutional powers . .. but beyond
that, the President of the United
States has an obligation to furnish the
country with strong moral leadership,"
he said.
Baker Disappointed
Committee vice chairman Howard
H. Baker Jr. (R-Tenn.) also expressed
disappointment in Nixon's decision.
"I've tried as far as I know how to
try to avoid this confrontation," Baker
said. "There was no other practical
course of action."
No one seems to know how this
battle between Nixon and the
committee will turn out.
A more interesting court test might
shape up between Nixon and Cox,

since Cox is technically a member of
the executive branch of the
government.
This might make it difficult for
Nixon to claim executive privilege as a
reason for not releasing the tapes and
documents to Cox.
Meanwhile the Watergate
committee finished hearing testimony
from Gordon Strachan, once assistant
to former White House chief of staff
H.R. Haldeman.
Ehrlichman Testifies
Former domestic affairs adviser
John D. Ehrlichman appears before
the committee today.
Strachan testified that Haldeman
had told him, shortly before the June
17 break-in at Democratic National
Headquarters, to "make sure our files
are clean."
Strachan said he then shredded the
entire file dealing with political
intelligence.
In the 15-page statement he read
Friday, Strachan said that former
deputy campaign director Jeb Stuart
Magruder had told him shortly after a
meeting on March 30, 1972, that "a
sophisticated political intelligence
gathering system has been approved
with a budget of [$300,000]."
Strachan claimed he passed this
information on to Haldeman.
According to Magruder, it was at
this meeting that former U.S. Atty.
Gen. John N. Mitchell approved a plan
by convicted Watergate conspirator G.
Gordon Liddy which included the
Watergate break-in. Mitchell has
denied giving him approval.
'Talking Paper'
Strachan claimed that Haldeman
had scheduled a meeting for April 4,
1972 for which Strachan prepared a
"talking paper" telling Haldeman what

was to be discussed.
Strachan said the topic of "political
intelligence" was on the agenda for the
meeting.
Describing Haldeman's alleged
knowledge of political intelligence
operations, Strachan testified that
Haldeman told him to ask Liddy
during the spring of 1972 "to transfer
his [Liddy*s] capabilities" from Sen.
Edmund S. Muskie (D-Me.) to Sen.
George McGovern (D-S.D.) with
"particular emphasis on the
connection" between McGovern and
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.).
Strachan said he conveyed the
message and Liddy "seemed to
understand" what Haldeman meant.
'Talked To Bob'
The day after the break-in,
Strachan said he talked to Magruder
who allegedly told Strachan, "Don't
worry about it. I talked to Bob
[Haldeman] this morning."
Because of the feud between Liddy
and Magruder, Strachan said, Liddy
asked to report directly to Haldeman
