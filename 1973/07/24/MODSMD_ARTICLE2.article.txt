# Nixon Won't Yield Tapes, Cancels Ervin Meeting
## 
### KEVIN SMITH 
Special to the Daily
WASHINGTON — President Nixon
yesterday adamantly refused to turn
over copies of White House tapes and
documents to the Senate Watergate
Committee or to special Watergate
prosecutor Archibald Cox.
Nixon also canceled a scheduled
meeting with committee chairman
Sen. Sam J. Ervin Jr. (D-N.C.), stating
it would serve "no useful purpose."
In a letter to Ervin, Nixon said he
himself had listened to the tapes and
they were "entirely consistent with
what I know to be the truth and what
I have stated to be the truth."
But the President said that "persons
with different perspectives and
motivations would inevitably interpret
them in different ways."
The committee unanimously agreed
to issue a subpoena for the tapes and
documents. Cox, describing the
President's decision as "without legal
foundation," said he would also issue a
subpoena.
'Different Interpretation'
Ervin commented, "I have a very
different interpretation of the
Constitution than the President."
He further remarked, "I deeply
regret that this situation has arisen
because I think that the Watergate
tragedy is the greatest tragedy that this
country has ever suffered ... I see no
redeeming features in Watergate.
"A President not only has
constitutional powers . .. but beyond
that, the President of the United
States has an obligation to furnish the
country with strong moral leadership,"
he said.
Baker Disappointed
Committee vice chairman Howard
H. Baker Jr. (R-Tenn.) also expressed
disappointment in Nixon's decision.
"I've tried as far as I know how to
try to avoid this confrontation," Baker
said. "There was no other practical
course of action."
No one seems to know how this
battle between Nixon and the
committee will turn out.
A more interesting court test might
shape up between Nixon and Cox,

since Cox is technically a member of
the executive branch of the
government.
This might make it difficult for
Nixon to claim executive privilege as a
reason for not releasing the tapes and
documents to Cox.
Meanwhile the Watergate
committee finished hearing testimony
from Gordon Strachan, once assistant
to former White House chief of staff
H.R. Haldeman.
Ehrlichman Testifies
Former domestic affairs adviser
John D. Ehrlichman appears before
the committee today.
Strachan testified that Haldeman
had told him, shortly before the June
17 break-in at Democratic National
Headquarters, to "make sure our files
are clean."
Strachan said he then shredded the
entire file dealing with political
intelligence.
In the 15-page statement he read
Friday, Strachan said that former
deputy campaign director Jeb Stuart
Magruder had told him shortly after a
meeting on March 30, 1972, that "a
sophisticated political intelligence
gathering system has been approved
with a budget of [$300,000]."
Strachan claimed he passed this
information on to Haldeman.
According to Magruder, it was at
this meeting that former U.S. Atty.
Gen. John N. Mitchell approved a plan
by convicted Watergate conspirator G.
Gordon Liddy which included the
Watergate break-in. Mitchell has
denied giving him approval.
'Talking Paper'
Strachan claimed that Haldeman
had scheduled a meeting for April 4,
1972 for which Strachan prepared a
"talking paper" telling Haldeman what

was to be discussed.
Strachan said the topic of "political
intelligence" was on the agenda for the
meeting.
Describing Haldeman's alleged
knowledge of political intelligence
operations, Strachan testified that
Haldeman told him to ask Liddy
during the spring of 1972 "to transfer
his [Liddy*s] capabilities" from Sen.
Edmund S. Muskie (D-Me.) to Sen.
George McGovern (D-S.D.) with
"particular emphasis on the
connection" between McGovern and
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.).
Strachan said he conveyed the
message and Liddy "seemed to
understand" what Haldeman meant.
'Talked To Bob'
The day after the break-in,
Strachan said he talked to Magruder
who allegedly told Strachan, "Don't
worry about it. I talked to Bob
[Haldeman] this morning."
Because of the feud between Liddy
and Magruder, Strachan said, Liddy
asked to report directly to Haldeman
instead of to Magruder prior to the
June 17 break-in.
This request was supposedly turned
down, but it indicates that Liddy had
no qualms about talking to Haldeman
regarding his activities prior to the
actual break-in.
In direct response to a question
from Sen. Joseph Montoya (D-N.M.),
Strachan replied that "he [Haldemanl
was certainly aware of Mr. [Charles]
Colson's dirty tricks .. . and that he
was aware of intelligence gathering
since it was discussed at several
meetings."
Cash Returned
Strachan also testified that he
returned $350,000 in cash from the
campaign fund to former Committee
to Re-elect the President official Fred
C. Laßue. Strachan said he acted on
Haldeman's instructions and that he
later learned that the money was being
paid to the seven original Watergate
defendants.
Under questioning from Sen.
Lowell P. Weicker Jr. (R-Conn.),
Strachan admitted the existence of a
list of over 100 Democratic
congressmen and senators who had
favored Nixon's Vietnam War policy
or who were friends of organized
labor.
Strachan said the White House did
not want to give these congressmen
and senators serious opposition in
their campaigns last year.
Strachan also seemed to support
the testimony of fired Presidential

counsel John W. Dean 111 - the only
witness so far to implicate the
President in the scandal.
Dean testified that Nixon had been
aware of the cover-UD since
September, 1972.
Under questioning Strachan said
Dean had a "remarkable" ability to
recall intricate details and said he

believes Dean is honest.
"If he [Dean] said he told the
President about the cover-up, would
you think he told the truth?"
Montoya asked Strachan.
Strachan replied, "Based on my
experience with John Dean — my
opinion would be that John Dean
would be telling the truth."

Special to the Daily
WASHINGTON — President Nixon
yesterday adamantly refused to turn
over copies of White House tapes and
documents to the Senate Watergate
Committee or to special Watergate
prosecutor Archibald Cox.
Nixon also canceled a scheduled
meeting with committee chairman
Sen. Sam J. Ervin Jr. (D-N.C.), stating
it would serve "no useful purpose."
In a letter to Ervin, Nixon said he
himself had listened to the tapes and
they were "entirely consistent with
what I know to be the truth and what
I have stated to be the truth."
But the President said that "persons
with different perspectives and
motivations would inevitably interpret
them in different ways."
The committee unanimously agreed
to issue a subpoena for the tapes and
documents. Cox, describing the
President's decision as "without legal
foundation," said he would also issue a
subpoena.
'Different Interpretation'
Ervin commented, "I have a very
different interpretation of the
Constitution than the President."
He further remarked, "I deeply
regret that this situation has arisen
because I think that the Watergate
tragedy is the greatest tragedy that this
country has ever suffered ... I see no
redeeming features in Watergate.
"A President not only has
constitutional powers . .. but beyond
that, the President of the United
States has an obligation to furnish the
country with strong moral leadership,"
he said.
Baker Disappointed
Committee vice chairman Howard
H. Baker Jr. (R-Tenn.) also expressed
disappointment in Nixon's decision.
"I've tried as far as I know how to
try to avoid this confrontation," Baker
said. "There was no other practical
course of action."
No one seems to know how this
battle between Nixon and the
committee will turn out.
A more interesting court test might
shape up between Nixon and Cox,

since Cox is technically a member of
the executive branch of the
government.
This might make it difficult for
Nixon to claim executive privilege as a
reason for not releasing the tapes and
documents to Cox.
Meanwhile the Watergate
committee finished hearing testimony
from Gordon Strachan, once assistant
to former White House chief of staff
H.R. Haldeman.
Ehrlichman Testifies
Former domestic affairs adviser
John D. Ehrlichman appears before
the committee today.
Strachan testified that Haldeman
had told him, shortly before the June
17 break-in at Democratic National
Headquarters, to "make sure our files
are clean."
Strachan said he then shredded the
entire file dealing with political
intelligence.
In the 15-page statement he read
Friday, Strachan said that former
deputy campaign director Jeb Stuart
Magruder had told him shortly after a
meeting on March 30, 1972, that "a
sophisticated political intelligence
gathering system has been approved
with a budget of [$300,000]."
Strachan claimed he passed this
information on to Haldeman.
According to Magruder, it was at
this meeting that former U.S. Atty.
Gen. John N. Mitchell approved a plan
by convicted Watergate conspirator G.
Gordon Liddy which included the
Watergate break-in. Mitchell has
denied giving him approval.
'Talking Paper'
Strachan claimed that Haldeman
had scheduled a meeting for April 4,
1972 for which Strachan prepared a
"talking paper" telling Haldeman what

was to be discussed.
Strachan said the topic of "political
intelligence" was on the agenda for the
meeting.
Describing Haldeman's alleged
knowledge of political intelligence
operations, Strachan testified that
Haldeman told him to ask Liddy
during the spring of 1972 "to transfer
his [Liddy*s] capabilities" from Sen.
Edmund S. Muskie (D-Me.) to Sen.
George McGovern (D-S.D.) with
"particular emphasis on the
connection" between McGovern and
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.).
Strachan said he conveyed the
message and Liddy "seemed to
understand" what Haldeman meant.
'Talked To Bob'
The day after the break-in,
Strachan said he talked to Magruder
who allegedly told Strachan, "Don't
worry about it. I talked to Bob
[Haldeman] this morning."
Because of the feud between Liddy
and Magruder, Strachan said, Liddy
asked to report directly to Haldeman
instead of to Magruder prior to the
June 17 break-in.
This request was supposedly turned
down, but it indicates that Liddy had
no qualms about talking to Haldeman
regarding his activities prior to the
actual break-in.
In direct response to a question
from Sen. Joseph Montoya (D-N.M.),
Strachan replied that "he [Haldemanl
was certainly aware of Mr. [Charles]
Colson's dirty tricks .. . and that he
was aware of intelligence gathering
since it was discussed at several
meetings."
Cash Returned
Strachan also testified that he
returned $350,000 in cash from the
campaign fund to former Committee
to Re-elect the President official Fred
C. Laßue. Strachan said he acted on
Haldeman's instructions and that he
later learned that the money was being
paid to the seven original Watergate
defendants.
Under questioning from Sen.
Lowell P. Weicker Jr. (R-Conn.),
Strachan admitted the existence of a
list of over 100 Democratic
congressmen and senators who had
favored Nixon's Vietnam War policy
or who were friends of organized
labor.
Strachan said the White House did
not want to give these congressmen
and senators serious opposition in
their campaigns last year.
Strachan also seemed to support
the testimony of fired Presidential

counsel John W. Dean 111 - the only
witness so far to implicate the
President in the scandal.
Dean testified that Nixon had been
aware of the cover-UD since
September, 1972.
Under questioning Strachan said
Dean had a "remarkable" ability to
recall intricate details and said he

believes Dean is honest.
"If he [Dean] said he told the
President about the cover-up, would
you think he told the truth?"
Montoya asked Strachan.
Strachan replied, "Based on my
experience with John Dean — my
opinion would be that John Dean
would be telling the truth."

yesterday adamantly refused to turn
over copies of White House tapes and
documents to the Senate Watergate
Committee or to special Watergate
prosecutor Archibald Cox.
Nixon also canceled a scheduled
meeting with committee chairman
Sen. Sam J. Ervin Jr. (D-N.C.), stating
it would serve "no useful purpose."
In a letter to Ervin, Nixon said he
himself had listened to the tapes and
they were "entirely consistent with
what I know to be the truth and what
I have stated to be the truth."
But the President said that "persons
with different perspectives and
motivations would inevitably interpret
them in different ways."
The committee unanimously agreed
to issue a subpoena for the tapes and
documents. Cox, describing the
President's decision as "without legal
foundation," said he would also issue a
subpoena.
'Different Interpretation'
Ervin commented, "I have a very
different interpretation of the
Constitution than the President."
He further remarked, "I deeply
regret that this situation has arisen
because I think that the Watergate
tragedy is the greatest tragedy that this
country has ever suffered ... I see no
redeeming features in Watergate.
"A President not only has
constitutional powers . .. but beyond
that, the President of the United
States has an obligation to furnish the
country with strong moral leadership,"
he said.
Baker Disappointed
Committee vice chairman Howard
H. Baker Jr. (R-Tenn.) also expressed
disappointment in Nixon's decision.
"I've tried as far as I know how to
try to avoid this confrontation," Baker
said. "There was no other practical
course of action."
No one seems to know how this
battle between Nixon and the
committee will turn out.
A more interesting court test might
shape up between Nixon and Cox,

since Cox is technically a member of
the executive branch of the
government.
This might make it difficult for
Nixon to claim executive privilege as a
reason for not releasing the tapes and
documents to Cox.
Meanwhile the Watergate
committee finished hearing testimony
from Gordon Strachan, once assistant
to former White House chief of staff
H.R. Haldeman.
Ehrlichman Testifies
Former domestic affairs adviser
John D. Ehrlichman appears before
the committee today.
Strachan testified that Haldeman
had told him, shortly before the June
17 break-in at Democratic National
Headquarters, to "make sure our files
are clean."
Strachan said he then shredded the
entire file dealing with political
intelligence.
In the 15-page statement he read
Friday, Strachan said that former
deputy campaign director Jeb Stuart
Magruder had told him shortly after a
meeting on March 30, 1972, that "a
sophisticated political intelligence
gathering system has been approved
with a budget of [$300,000]."
Strachan claimed he passed this
information on to Haldeman.
According to Magruder, it was at
this meeting that former U.S. Atty.
Gen. John N. Mitchell approved a plan
by convicted Watergate conspirator G.
Gordon Liddy which included the
Watergate break-in. Mitchell has
denied giving him approval.
'Talking Paper'
Strachan claimed that Haldeman
had scheduled a meeting for April 4,
1972 for which Strachan prepared a
"talking paper" telling Haldeman what

was to be discussed.
Strachan said the topic of "political
intelligence" was on the agenda for the
meeting.
Describing Haldeman's alleged
knowledge of political intelligence
operations, Strachan testified that
Haldeman told him to ask Liddy
during the spring of 1972 "to transfer
his [Liddy*s] capabilities" from Sen.
Edmund S. Muskie (D-Me.) to Sen.
George McGovern (D-S.D.) with
"particular emphasis on the
connection" between McGovern and
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.).
Strachan said he conveyed the
message and Liddy "seemed to
understand" what Haldeman meant.
'Talked To Bob'
The day after the break-in,
Strachan said he talked to Magruder
who allegedly told Strachan, "Don't
worry about it. I talked to Bob
[Haldeman] this morning."
Because of the feud between Liddy
and Magruder, Strachan said, Liddy
asked to report directly to Haldeman
instead of to Magruder prior to the
June 17 break-in.
This request was supposedly turned
down, but it indicates that Liddy had
no qualms about talking to Haldeman
regarding his activities prior to the
actual break-in.
In direct response to a question
from Sen. Joseph Montoya (D-N.M.),
Strachan replied that "he [Haldemanl
was certainly aware of Mr. [Charles]
Colson's dirty tricks .. . and that he
was aware of intelligence gathering
since it was discussed at several
meetings."
Cash Returned
Strachan also testified that he
returned $350,000 in cash from the
campaign fund to former Committee
to Re-elect the President official Fred
C. Laßue. Strachan said he acted on
Haldeman's instructions and that he
later learned that the money was being
paid to the seven original Watergate
defendants.
Under questioning from Sen.
Lowell P. Weicker Jr. (R-Conn.),
Strachan admitted the existence of a
list of over 100 Democratic
congressmen and senators who had
favored Nixon's Vietnam War policy
or who were friends of organized
labor.
Strachan said the White House did
not want to give these congressmen
and senators serious opposition in
their campaigns last year.
Strachan also seemed to support
the testimony of fired Presidential

counsel John W. Dean 111 - the only
witness so far to implicate the
President in the scandal.
Dean testified that Nixon had been
aware of the cover-UD since
September, 1972.
Under questioning Strachan said
Dean had a "remarkable" ability to
recall intricate details and said he

believes Dean is honest.
"If he [Dean] said he told the
President about the cover-up, would
you think he told the truth?"
Montoya asked Strachan.
Strachan replied, "Based on my
experience with John Dean — my
opinion would be that John Dean
would be telling the truth."
