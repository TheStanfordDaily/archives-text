# Mobile Auto Repair Service Begins
## 
### BOB SIEGEL Consumer Affairs Writer 
A local garage recently initiated a
new car tune-up and minor repair
service featuring a fleet of mobile units
that do their work at the customer's
place of employment.
Bart Moitie, the owner-manager of
The Head Mechanic in Palo Alto,
explained the mobile vans visit the
parking lots of industries or other
institutions (such as Stanford) on a
publicized schedule.
Each van is staffed by two
state-licensed journeyman mechanics
and is equipped with tune-up parts
suitable for cars beginning with the
1955 model year. Anyone wishing to
take advantage of the service simply
drives his car to the mobile unit during
the appointed hours.

Moitie, who has operated his
foreign car repair shop for the past
four years, bought the first van and
began soliciting business about four
months ago.
"We've been having a response way
beyond our expectations," he says. In
the next seven to eight weeks, he will
be putting three additional vans into
operation. Each van can tune up to 10
vehicles per day.
He said, however, "We can't do any
significant repairs on the road because
of the nature of automobiles ... the
only thing we can really do effectively
is tune cars."
Prices for services and parts
provided by the mobile mechanics are
the same as those available in the
garage. The 10 percent discount that

has been offered to Stanford students
by the garage will be extended to all
van operations.
According to Moitie, "the mobile
unit has never been used before in the
automotive business," though it is
extensively employed by such
corporate entities as the telephone
company and plumbing industry.
At present, Moitie's vans service an
area spanning from Palo Alto to
Sunnyvale.
The manager-owner believes the
mobile vans fill a consumer need in the
community.
He emphasizes that his service
facilitates the practice of preventative
maintenance by car owners,
particularly in regard to good gas
mileage and efficient smog-control
equipment.

Moitie cited one example where he
achieved a 95 percent reduction in
pollutant emission from a 1968 car by
performing a standard tune-up.
In addition, the garage's advertising
brochure claims the service will enable
an individual to avoid losing time from
the job and may even have beneficial
effects on his job performance by
sparing him the anxiety of a
malfunctioning car.
Moitie mentioned that the obvious
convenience factor plus the growing
consciousness of the gasoline shortage
and of air quality seem to be factors
that will generate an increasing
demand for mobile operations. He
hopes eventually to expand his
operations to a wider area if the concept
continues its present pattern of
success.

A local garage recently initiated a
new car tune-up and minor repair
service featuring a fleet of mobile units
that do their work at the customer's
place of employment.
Bart Moitie, the owner-manager of
The Head Mechanic in Palo Alto,
explained the mobile vans visit the
parking lots of industries or other
institutions (such as Stanford) on a
publicized schedule.
Each van is staffed by two
state-licensed journeyman mechanics
and is equipped with tune-up parts
suitable for cars beginning with the
1955 model year. Anyone wishing to
take advantage of the service simply
drives his car to the mobile unit during
the appointed hours.

Moitie, who has operated his
foreign car repair shop for the past
four years, bought the first van and
began soliciting business about four
months ago.
"We've been having a response way
beyond our expectations," he says. In
the next seven to eight weeks, he will
be putting three additional vans into
operation. Each van can tune up to 10
vehicles per day.
He said, however, "We can't do any
significant repairs on the road because
of the nature of automobiles ... the
only thing we can really do effectively
is tune cars."
Prices for services and parts
provided by the mobile mechanics are
the same as those available in the
garage. The 10 percent discount that

has been offered to Stanford students
by the garage will be extended to all
van operations.
According to Moitie, "the mobile
unit has never been used before in the
automotive business," though it is
extensively employed by such
corporate entities as the telephone
company and plumbing industry.
At present, Moitie's vans service an
area spanning from Palo Alto to
Sunnyvale.
The manager-owner believes the
mobile vans fill a consumer need in the
community.
He emphasizes that his service
facilitates the practice of preventative
maintenance by car owners,
particularly in regard to good gas
mileage and efficient smog-control
equipment.

Moitie cited one example where he
achieved a 95 percent reduction in
pollutant emission from a 1968 car by
performing a standard tune-up.
In addition, the garage's advertising
brochure claims the service will enable
an individual to avoid losing time from
the job and may even have beneficial
effects on his job performance by
sparing him the anxiety of a
malfunctioning car.
Moitie mentioned that the obvious
convenience factor plus the growing
consciousness of the gasoline shortage
and of air quality seem to be factors
that will generate an increasing
demand for mobile operations. He
hopes eventually to expand his
operations to a wider area if the concept
continues its present pattern of
success.
