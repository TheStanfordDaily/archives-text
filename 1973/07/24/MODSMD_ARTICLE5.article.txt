# Weicker A Tough Questioner
## 
### KEVIN SMITH 
Special to the Daily
WASHINGTON - A voice of
conscience .... A grandstander ....
A naive politician .... A publicity
seeker .... An ambitious Presidential
candidate ....
Which description fits the real
Lowell P. Weicker Jr. — the tall
Republican from Connecticut who has
been making headlines recently as a
member of the Senate Watergate
Committee?
He has been called all of those
things, plus many more, since his
emergence as a national figure several
months ago.
Labeled a maverick by some,
Weicker has still supported President
Nixon and Republican Party programs
far more than some might think.
Supported Nixon
Until the beginning of this year,
Weicker consistently supported
Nixon's Vietnam War policy, including
the bombing raids. However, Weicker
had announced that after 1972, he
would no longer support that war
policy, and has voted for U.S.
withdrawal from Indochina since the
current Congress convened in January.
Weicker refuses to condone
amnesty for draft evaders, and
claimed, during his 1970 Senate
campaign, that draft evaders should
come home to a "nice cold jail cell."
Knows A Good Thing
However, many Nixon loyalists
picture him as a man with Presidential
ambitions who looks at the national
television coverage the Watergate
hearings are receiving and knows a
good thing when he sees it.
Weicker vehemently denies this,
claiming he was born in Paris and is
thus ineligible to become President.
This has been disputed by numerous
constitutional lawyers.
The senator first earned the ire of
the White House when he conducted
his own investigation into Watergate
during the spring*and demanded the
resignation of former White House
chief of staff H.R. Haldeman a full
month before Haldeman actually
resigned.
During the first month of the
Watergate Committee hearings Weicker
seemed to be overshadowed by the
personalities of Committee Chairman
Sam J. Ervin Jr. (D-N.C.) and Vice
Chairman Howafd H. Baker Jr.
(R-Tenn.). «
But the last week in May, on the
fourth day of testimony by former
White House Counsel John W. Dean
111, Weicker provided one of the more
dramatic moments in the Watergate
hearings to date.
He charged that attempts had been

made by the White House to smear
and discredit him with stories that he
had misused 1970 campaign funds and
that he was about to switch to the
Democratic Party.
Disgust
Weicker displayed disgust at the
White House "enemies" list and at
other White House actions. He
declared:
"Republicans do not cover up.
Republicans do not go ahead and
threaten. Republicans do not go ahead
and commit illegal acts. And God
knows Republicans don't view their
fellow Americans as enemies to be
harassed. But rather, I can assure you,
that this Republican and those that I
serve with, look upon every American
as human beings [sic] to be loved and
won."
When former White House special
counsel Charles W. Colson came to
Weicker's office the next day to try to
explain his activities, Weicker threw
him out of the office, shouting:
"You make me sick .... You deal
in crap .... You can just get your ass
out of my office because you make me
sick!"
Last week, it was Weicker who
provided the toughest grilling when
John Mitchell took the stand. Weicker
asked Mitchell, with obvious venom in
his voice, why he didn't take any
action when, as Attorney General of
the United States, he listened to a
proposal by G. Gordon Liddy which
included numerous illegal acts.
'Pinwheel'
The Senator questioned Mitchell,
"Didn't it occur to you to call up the
President and say that you had some
sort of 'pinwheel' — [i.e. Liddy] — in
your office and that the President
should be warned about this man?"
When Mitchell's answer wasn't
satisfactory, Weicker demanded, "Is
there anything in this country, aside
from the President of the United
States, that puts you in awe, Mr.
Mitchell?"
At the end of Weicker's
questioning, either Mitchell or his
lawyer (there is some dispute about
this) remarked, "It's a great trial
you're conducting here — isn't it?"
