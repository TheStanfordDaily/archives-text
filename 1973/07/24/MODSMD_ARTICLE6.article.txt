# Ernie Has Cookies For Canines, Love For All
## 
### SRI KRISHN CHOPRA 
"If you like Hitler, you'll love Nixon,"
announces the button pinned on Ernie's right
shoulder.
But Ernest C. Lewis, 59, is no Nixon-hater.
Actually, it seems impossible for him to hate
anyone. "Ernie lives in a world of love," says a
co-worker. "I've never known a guy who enjoys his
work more."
Ernie's work as waiter in the Tresidder cafeteria
brings him in contact with people all the time. 'The
people who come to Tresidder love him because
Ernie loves people," says another waiter.
Then why the anti-Nixon button?
"Oh, that," Ernie laughs. "A Democrat friend
gave that to me. Couldn't make a friend unhappy.
So I wear it.
"But here, see this." He points to the button on
the left shoulder which urges a vote for the
Republican Party. "That's from a Republican
friend. Keeps everyone happy," he winks.
'Nixon Is A Good Man'
"Oh say," he suddenly asks. "Have you heard the
latest about Watergate? You know they can't do
nothin' to Nixon. 'Cause Nixon is a good man, he
is."
"I've been a Nixon man for years," continues
Ernie. "I've known him since the time he started his
political career. Have also been on the area's
Republicanelectioncommittee, you know."
"And I tell you, there is nothin' wrong with our
President. He is a good man, he is."
Ernie paused to see if his services were required
by any Tresidder customers.

It was lunch time. Ernie was on duty, dressed in
his green apron. His job is to collect and remove the
dishes. But the relaxed mood of the summer quarter
fills Tresidder with a warm laziness. Nobody seems
to be in a hurry to finish his lunch. Satisfied there is
no call to duty, Ernie'resumes:
"They've got the wrong idea about Nixon. Look
man, everyone makes mistakes. Nixon's mistake was
he chose the -wrong friends who kept him in the
dark.
"Haven't you made mistakes?" he asked. "I have.
I chose the wrong wife. We're divorced now."
Children
Ernie took off his dark glasses to wipe the lenses.
There was sadness in his eyes. "Yeah, I miss my
children very much. A boy of nine and a girl of 16.
"Visit them every weekend in San Jose. We have
lots of fun together that day — my kids and I. My
son likes to play ball with me. He's goin' to be a
great ball star one day.
"Sometimes my girlfriend joins us. She cooks
dinner for us. She's a sweet gal, she is. More my
type. She's a nurse, you know. Kind and lovin'."
Ernie was almost blushing. "She's divorced too.
We're planning to get married after her kids
graduate out of high school."
Other Friends
A canine friend of Ernie wanted a word with
him. The friend wagged his tail vigorously. Ernie
asked him if he's had his lunch, or if he wanted
some more cookies.
The friend barked to say no thanks, he just came
to say Hi. Patting him an au revoir, Ernie continued
with his conversation:

"Look man, I'm getting old now," he said,
pointing to his graying hair. "I've had a very
vigorous life.
"Worked as a journeyman in the Navy shipyards
for nearly 30 years, you know. Had to retire before
my time 'cause of an injured back. Now I wanna
marry a sweet gal and settle down in peace."
Rugged Life
How does he like it here after the rugged life of
shipyards?
"Oh I've always wanted to come here. Used to
work in this very place part-time since 1966 in the
evenings from 6 to 10. So when I retired two years
back I had to come back here."
He then pulled out a newspaper clipping from his
pocket. It was a write-up on his nephew, who
recently graduated from Yale. He's now been
accepted on a fellowship by Harvard Medical
School.
Ernie's name was also there in the write up:
Uncle Ernest C. Lewis of Palo Alto.
Paternal Pride
"I want my son to become a doctor too, when he
grows up - from Stanford Medical School. That's
why I came to work here," he said quietly, his face
lighting up with paternal pride.
Lunchers started moving out, and new people
began coming in. Ernie had work to do. "You take
care," he waved.
And in a distance, Kansas-born Ernie's midwest
accent could be heard greeting the new arrivals:
"Oh, there are pies and steaks and chocolates and a
lotta goodies for lunch today. YouH love 'em."

dishes. But the relaxed mood of the summer quarter
fills Tresidder with a warm laziness. Nobody seems
to be in a hurry to finish his lunch. Satisfied there is
no call to duty, Ernie'resumes:
"They've got the wrong idea about Nixon. Look
man, everyone makes mistakes. Nixon's mistake was
he chose the -wrong friends who kept him in the
dark.
"Haven't you made mistakes?" he asked. "I have.
I chose the wrong wife. We're divorced now."
Children
Ernie took off his dark glasses to wipe the lenses.
There was sadness in his eyes. "Yeah, I miss my
children very much. A boy of nine and a girl of 16.
"Visit them every weekend in San Jose. We have
lots of fun together that day — my kids and I. My
son likes to play ball with me. He's goin' to be a
great ball star one day.
"Sometimes my girlfriend joins us. She cooks
dinner for us. She's a sweet gal, she is. More my
type. She's a nurse, you know. Kind and lovin'."
Ernie was almost blushing. "She's divorced too.
We're planning to get married after her kids
graduate out of high school."
Other Friends
A canine friend of Ernie wanted a word with
him. The friend wagged his tail vigorously. Ernie
asked him if he's had his lunch, or if he wanted
some more cookies.
The friend barked to say no thanks, he just came
to say Hi. Patting him an au revoir, Ernie continued
with his conversation:

"Look man, I'm getting old now," he said,
pointing to his graying hair. "I've had a very
vigorous life.
"Worked as a journeyman in the Navy shipyards
for nearly 30 years, you know. Had to retire before
my time 'cause of an injured back. Now I wanna
marry a sweet gal and settle down in peace."
Rugged Life
How does he like it here after the rugged life of
shipyards?
"Oh I've always wanted to come here. Used to
work in this very place part-time since 1966 in the
evenings from 6 to 10. So when I retired two years
back I had to come back here."
He then pulled out a newspaper clipping from his
pocket. It was a write-up on his nephew, who
recently graduated from Yale. He's now been
accepted on a fellowship by Harvard Medical
School.
Ernie's name was also there in the write up:
Uncle Ernest C. Lewis of Palo Alto.
Paternal Pride
"I want my son to become a doctor too, when he
grows up - from Stanford Medical School. That's
why I came to work here," he said quietly, his face
lighting up with paternal pride.
Lunchers started moving out, and new people
began coming in. Ernie had work to do. "You take
care," he waved.
And in a distance, Kansas-born Ernie's midwest
accent could be heard greeting the new arrivals:
"Oh, there are pies and steaks and chocolates and a
lotta goodies for lunch today. YouH love 'em."

ERNIE — Tresidder waiter Ernest C. Lewis (left), a familiar face in the cafeteria
lunch scene, converses with two lunchers while clearing a table. Says one of
Emie's co-workers, "I've never known a guy who enjoys his work more."
"If you like Hitler, you'll love Nixon,"
announces the button pinned on Ernie's right
shoulder.
But Ernest C. Lewis, 59, is no Nixon-hater.
Actually, it seems impossible for him to hate
anyone. "Ernie lives in a world of love," says a
co-worker. "I've never known a guy who enjoys his
work more."
Ernie's work as waiter in the Tresidder cafeteria
brings him in contact with people all the time. 'The
people who come to Tresidder love him because
Ernie loves people," says another waiter.
Then why the anti-Nixon button?
"Oh, that," Ernie laughs. "A Democrat friend
gave that to me. Couldn't make a friend unhappy.
So I wear it.
"But here, see this." He points to the button on
the left shoulder which urges a vote for the
Republican Party. "That's from a Republican
friend. Keeps everyone happy," he winks.
'Nixon Is A Good Man'
"Oh say," he suddenly asks. "Have you heard the
latest about Watergate? You know they can't do
nothin' to Nixon. 'Cause Nixon is a good man, he
is."
"I've been a Nixon man for years," continues
Ernie. "I've known him since the time he started his
political career. Have also been on the area's
Republicanelectioncommittee, you know."
"And I tell you, there is nothin' wrong with our
President. He is a good man, he is."
Ernie paused to see if his services were required
by any Tresidder customers.

vigorous life.
"Worked as a journeyman in the Navy shipyards
for nearly 30 years, you know. Had to retire before
my time 'cause of an injured back. Now I wanna
marry a sweet gal and settle down in peace."
Rugged Life
How does he like it here after the rugged life of
shipyards?
"Oh I've always wanted to come here. Used to
work in this very place part-time since 1966 in the
evenings from 6 to 10. So when I retired two years
back I had to come back here."
He then pulled out a newspaper clipping from his
pocket. It was a write-up on his nephew, who
recently graduated from Yale. He's now been
accepted on a fellowship by Harvard Medical
School.
Ernie's name was also there in the write up:
Uncle Ernest C. Lewis of Palo Alto.
Paternal Pride
"I want my son to become a doctor too, when he
grows up - from Stanford Medical School. That's
why I came to work here," he said quietly, his face
lighting up with paternal pride.
Lunchers started moving out, and new people
began coming in. Ernie had work to do. "You take
care," he waved.
And in a distance, Kansas-born Ernie's midwest
accent could be heard greeting the new arrivals:
"Oh, there are pies and steaks and chocolates and a
lotta goodies for lunch today. YouH love 'em."

ERNIE — Tresidder waiter Ernest C. Lewis (left), a familiar face in the cafeteria
lunch scene, converses with two lunchers while clearing a table. Says one of
Emie's co-workers, "I've never known a guy who enjoys his work more."
"If you like Hitler, you'll love Nixon,"
announces the button pinned on Ernie's right
shoulder.
But Ernest C. Lewis, 59, is no Nixon-hater.
Actually, it seems impossible for him to hate
anyone. "Ernie lives in a world of love," says a
co-worker. "I've never known a guy who enjoys his
work more."
Ernie's work as waiter in the Tresidder cafeteria
brings him in contact with people all the time. 'The
people who come to Tresidder love him because
Ernie loves people," says another waiter.
Then why the anti-Nixon button?
"Oh, that," Ernie laughs. "A Democrat friend
gave that to me. Couldn't make a friend unhappy.
So I wear it.
"But here, see this." He points to the button on
the left shoulder which urges a vote for the
Republican Party. "That's from a Republican
friend. Keeps everyone happy," he winks.
'Nixon Is A Good Man'
"Oh say," he suddenly asks. "Have you heard the
latest about Watergate? You know they can't do
nothin' to Nixon. 'Cause Nixon is a good man, he
is."
"I've been a Nixon man for years," continues
Ernie. "I've known him since the time he started his
political career. Have also been on the area's
Republicanelectioncommittee, you know."
"And I tell you, there is nothin' wrong with our
President. He is a good man, he is."
Ernie paused to see if his services were required
by any Tresidder customers.

It was lunch time. Ernie was on duty, dressed in
his green apron. His job is to collect and remove the
dishes. But the relaxed mood of the summer quarter
fills Tresidder with a warm laziness. Nobody seems
to be in a hurry to finish his lunch. Satisfied there is
no call to duty, Ernie'resumes:
"They've got the wrong idea about Nixon. Look
man, everyone makes mistakes. Nixon's mistake was
he chose the -wrong friends who kept him in the
dark.
"Haven't you made mistakes?" he asked. "I have.
I chose the wrong wife. We're divorced now."
Children
Ernie took off his dark glasses to wipe the lenses.
There was sadness in his eyes. "Yeah, I miss my
children very much. A boy of nine and a girl of 16.
"Visit them every weekend in San Jose. We have
lots of fun together that day — my kids and I. My
son likes to play ball with me. He's goin' to be a
great ball star one day.
"Sometimes my girlfriend joins us. She cooks
dinner for us. She's a sweet gal, she is. More my
type. She's a nurse, you know. Kind and lovin'."
Ernie was almost blushing. "She's divorced too.
We're planning to get married after her kids
graduate out of high school."
Other Friends
A canine friend of Ernie wanted a word with
him. The friend wagged his tail vigorously. Ernie
asked him if he's had his lunch, or if he wanted
some more cookies.
The friend barked to say no thanks, he just came
to say Hi. Patting him an au revoir, Ernie continued
with his conversation:

"Look man, I'm getting old now," he said,
pointing to his graying hair. "I've had a very
vigorous life.
"Worked as a journeyman in the Navy shipyards
for nearly 30 years, you know. Had to retire before
