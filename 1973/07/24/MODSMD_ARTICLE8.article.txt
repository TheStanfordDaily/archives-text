# Politics Of Destroying Minds
## Psychosurgery And Civil Liberties 
### 
Bill Evers

On July 10, a three-judge panel
attached to a circuit court sitting
in Detroit ruled that
ineffectiveness as a device for
therapy and rehabilitation
temporarily rules out the use of
psychosurgery on the inmates of
state institutions. Psychosurgery is
an operation in which portions of
the brain are destroyed in an
effort to alter behavior and
attitudes.
The judges who halted
psychosurgery in Michigan based
their decision on utilitarian
grounds and left the door open
for further legal psychosurgery
once, in the words of the New
York Times, "the procedure has
developed to a level where its
benefits clearly outweigh its
risks."
The judges did not directly
oppose psychosurgery as an
""— i

invasion of the right to privacy or
as torture ("cruel and unusual
punishment"). These had.
however, been presented to the
court as the correct grounds on
which to outlaw psychosurgery in
a brief submitted by Francis A.
Allen, former dean of the
Michigan Law School, and Robert
A. Burt, a colleague of his on the
law faculty.
The court's ruling on
cost-benefit grounds instead of
libertarian grounds stems from the
general ideological tendency to
view punishment and
incarceration in terms of therapy
and rehabilitation rather than in
terms of the criminal's just
deserts. "Therapy," though a very
humanitarian-sounding word, has
easily become the rationale for
everything from indeterminate
sentences to lobotomies.
No Real Consent
The court decision did
recognize that the inmates of
mental institutions are not free
agents. Such inmates are confined
against their will and cannot give
real consent (to a psychosurgery
operation) in an atmosphere

established and maintained by
coercion.
The real hero in the battle
against psychosurgery is Dr. Peter
Breggin, a psychiatrist from
Washington, D.C. Since early
1972, Breggin has mobilized
public protest against the
operation and has directed
pressure upon political
decision-makers.
"The basic goal and the basic
consequence of psychosurgery,"
writes Breggin, "are always one
and the same — to blunt, tame,
quiet, sedate, or otherwise
submerge or partially destroy the
individual's unique emotional
responsiveness."
Psycho surgery-proponent
William B. Scoville of Hartford
Hospital and Yale University, the
President of the International
Society for Psychosurgery, has
given in his writings virtually the
same description of the intention
and the result of the operation.
Key Question
Since we have a generally
agreed upon account of what
psychosurgery does, the legal
question should be: Does it

violate the rights of the
individual?
Dr. Jose M.R. Delgado,
professor of psychiatry at Yale,
argues that a person does not have
"the right to develop his own
mind," and that therefore
psychosurgery should be done.
Breggin responds to such
arguments by asking: "Do we
wish to invade the provinces of
'self,' treating the person by
reducing his capacity to be a
person? . ..
"When a man's respiratory
potential is reduced or when his
excretory functions are limited by
surgery, the man himself — the
person whom we know and who
knows himself — remains the
same.
"When the capacity of the
brain is reduced by a
psychosurgeon, so too is the
capacity of the mind. The man is
changed, reduced, made into
something less than he was."
Attack On Rights
Breggin recognizes that
Delgado's opposition to individual
liberty is an "outright attack"
upon the "principles of personal

autonomy, independence, and
freedom, man's 'inalienable rights'
as enunciated in the Declaration
of Independence."
Psychosurgery is not only an
assault in general upon human
liberty. At the present time,
psychosurgery has certain specific
targets. Leading proponents and
practitioners of psychosurgery
have recommended it as a possible
way to cure rebellious blacks.
In practice, psychosurgery has
frequently been used against
social deviates like homosexuals,
over-active children, and neurotic
women.
Physically destroying minds
and personalities is nota "therapy"
that should be permitted in a free
society. The effectiveness or
ineffectiveness of the procedure in
tampering with the brain should
not be the question. Instead,
psychosurgery should be
abolished because it aggresses
against the integrity of the person
and violates a person's right to
own and control his own body.

ineffectiveness as a device for
therapy and rehabilitation
temporarily rules out the use of
psychosurgery on the inmates of
state institutions. Psychosurgery is
an operation in which portions of
the brain are destroyed in an
effort to alter behavior and
attitudes.
The judges who halted
psychosurgery in Michigan based
their decision on utilitarian
grounds and left the door open
for further legal psychosurgery
once, in the words of the New
York Times, "the procedure has
developed to a level where its
benefits clearly outweigh its
risks."
The judges did not directly
oppose psychosurgery as an
""— i

invasion of the right to privacy or
as torture ("cruel and unusual
punishment"). These had.
however, been presented to the
court as the correct grounds on
which to outlaw psychosurgery in
a brief submitted by Francis A.
Allen, former dean of the
Michigan Law School, and Robert
A. Burt, a colleague of his on the
law faculty.
The court's ruling on
cost-benefit grounds instead of
libertarian grounds stems from the
general ideological tendency to
view punishment and
incarceration in terms of therapy
and rehabilitation rather than in
terms of the criminal's just
deserts. "Therapy," though a very
humanitarian-sounding word, has
easily become the rationale for
everything from indeterminate
sentences to lobotomies.
No Real Consent
The court decision did
recognize that the inmates of
mental institutions are not free
agents. Such inmates are confined
against their will and cannot give
real consent (to a psychosurgery
operation) in an atmosphere

established and maintained by
coercion.
The real hero in the battle
against psychosurgery is Dr. Peter
Breggin, a psychiatrist from
Washington, D.C. Since early
1972, Breggin has mobilized
public protest against the
operation and has directed
pressure upon political
decision-makers.
"The basic goal and the basic
consequence of psychosurgery,"
writes Breggin, "are always one
and the same — to blunt, tame,
quiet, sedate, or otherwise
submerge or partially destroy the
individual's unique emotional
responsiveness."
Psycho surgery-proponent
William B. Scoville of Hartford
Hospital and Yale University, the
President of the International
Society for Psychosurgery, has
given in his writings virtually the
same description of the intention
and the result of the operation.
Key Question
Since we have a generally
agreed upon account of what
psychosurgery does, the legal
question should be: Does it

violate the rights of the
individual?
Dr. Jose M.R. Delgado,
professor of psychiatry at Yale,
argues that a person does not have
"the right to develop his own
mind," and that therefore
psychosurgery should be done.
Breggin responds to such
arguments by asking: "Do we
wish to invade the provinces of
'self,' treating the person by
reducing his capacity to be a
person? . ..
"When a man's respiratory
potential is reduced or when his
excretory functions are limited by
surgery, the man himself — the
person whom we know and who
knows himself — remains the
same.
"When the capacity of the
brain is reduced by a
psychosurgeon, so too is the
capacity of the mind. The man is
changed, reduced, made into
something less than he was."
Attack On Rights
Breggin recognizes that
Delgado's opposition to individual
liberty is an "outright attack"
upon the "principles of personal

autonomy, independence, and
freedom, man's 'inalienable rights'
as enunciated in the Declaration
of Independence."
Psychosurgery is not only an
assault in general upon human
liberty. At the present time,
psychosurgery has certain specific
targets. Leading proponents and
practitioners of psychosurgery
have recommended it as a possible
way to cure rebellious blacks.
In practice, psychosurgery has
frequently been used against
social deviates like homosexuals,
over-active children, and neurotic
women.
Physically destroying minds
and personalities is nota "therapy"
that should be permitted in a free
society. The effectiveness or
ineffectiveness of the procedure in
tampering with the brain should
not be the question. Instead,
psychosurgery should be
abolished because it aggresses
against the integrity of the person
and violates a person's right to
own and control his own body.
