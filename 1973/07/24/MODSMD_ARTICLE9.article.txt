# Roberts' View Reactionary
## Who Are The Imperialists? 
### 
Jacques Delpechin

In the Daily issues of July 10
and 13, we learned from Craig
Roberts, an economist working at
Hoover, that the real imperialists
are not the . multinational
capitalist corporations, but rather
the local African governments
which use the Marketing Boards as
their tool for exploiting the
African farmers.
This gentleman starts by saying
that imperialism is "emotive and
refers to the inequity of the
economically advanced countries
of the West, who allegedly owe
their prosperity to the
exploitation of underdeveloped
countries."
This is the shortest

non-definition, ever, of what
imperialism is, but it allows the
author to proceed right away to
the main point of his essay: the
true imperialists are the African
governments which continue to
use the Marketing Boards in order
to confiscate the revenues of the
African farmers.
Expanded Definition
Roberts further reduces his
definition of imperialism by
linking it only to the marketing
boards.
What about the low
exploitative wages paid by the
mutlinational mining companies
in Africa? What about the low
wages paid by multinational
manufacturing industries in
Africa?
What about the rates of profits
that multinational capital makes
on the African market? What
about the huge tax exemptions
that multinational capital manages
to extort from African
governments?
What about the incredibly high
returns on investment (in the 25
percent range in South Africa)
that multinational capital sucks
from African workers?
Marketing Boards
As for the Marketing Boards,
Roberts' perspective is that of a
recationary masquerading as a
spokesman for the exploited
African farmers.
The Marketing Boards are part
and parcel of the 20th Century
capitalistic mode of production
and they are a necessary
institution if multinational capital
is to keep a fairly constant flow of
primary material despite World
Market prices fluctuations.
The Marketing Boards may be
physically located in Africa, but
that is immaterial in view of their
position in the process of a mode
of production that pits the
producers against the buyers.
When the African produces a
good, he does not deal
economically with the Marketing
Boards, but with the
industrialized nations through
multinational capital.
It is multinational capital that
decides what is going to be paid to
the producers and not the
Marketing Boards. These are only

meant to hide the real causes of
the inequities. The Marketing
Boards are only a miserable
incentive to keep the African
producer tied to the system.
Miserable
A miserable incentive for a
miserable pittance.
Although the Marketing Boards
are a useful tool, they are not
an essential one. Whether the
African cultivator goes through
his country's Marketing Board to
sell his product or not does not
change his position with regard to
the mode of production within
which he is forced to operate: he
is still exploited.
As to Roberts' suggestion that
African governments are
responsible for perpetuating this
state of affairs, one could accept
it except for the fact that past
examples have shown that every
time a Third World government
has tried to dictate its own terms
to multinational capital, it has
been met with obstructionist
tactics which range from cuts in
"aid" to outright overthrows of
dissenting regimes (remember
Lumumba, Bay of Pigs, Vietnam).
Roberts' argument is full of
sophisms, for, if we were to
follow his logic, we could argue
that since African chiefs and
Creoles played a significant role in
rounding up slaves in Africa in
order to supply the European
slavers, then we would say that
the true slavers were the Africans.
Similarly, one could almost
predict that his next article will be
to show us that the real promoters
of Apartheid in South Africa are
the Africans themselves .
Since Roberts is convinced that
imperialism is a concept
concocted by wayward
intellectuals, let him meditate the
following blurb, by a presumably
acceptable intellectual: "Our
influence is used wherever it can
be and persistently, through our
embassies, in our aid discussion
and in direct aid negotiations, to
underline the importance of U.S.
private investment." (Sec. of State
Dean Rusk, House Committee on
Foreign Affairs, Expropriation of
American Property, p. 24).
