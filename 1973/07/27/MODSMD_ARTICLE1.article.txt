# Lyman Hits CUS Study's 'Unanswered Questions'

### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
President Richard W. Lyman said
this week that a recently-released
report on SWOPSI's rejection of
controversial Electrical Engineering
Prof. William Shockley's course
proposal has not "answered all the
questions I raised adequately."
But Lyman said that further
discussion of the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies (CUS) report
would eventually "reach the point of
diminishing returns," and said he does
not intend to continue the
investigation.
Lyman asked CUS to investigate
the rejection last August, calling some
aspects of the SWOPSI Policy Board's
decision "deeply troubling."
Appearing on KZSU's "Campus
Conference" Tuesday, Lyman said he
was "somewhat disappointed" with
the committee's findings in the area of
academic freedom.
He said he is currently drafting a
letter of response to the report, which
he will send to CUS Chairman Edwin
Good.
Shockley, who has theorized that
blacks are genetically less intelligent
than whites, originally proposed his
course on the heritability of
intelligence over a year and a half ago.
Last July, SWOPSI Director Dan
Lewis told Shockley in a letter that his
proposal had been rejected. Tuesday,
Lyman said some of the reasons given
in the letter were "dubious."
A CUS subcommittee headed by
Political Science Prof. Hubert Marshall
released its report on the rejection
earlier this month.
Although Lyman said he was

"satisfied" that the subcommittee
conducted a thorough investigation, he
criticized some aspects of the report.
He accused the subcommittee of
setting up "a false issue ... of whether
a faculty member has a god-given
right" to teach outside his discipline,
and then tearing down its own issue.

No one, he said, had ever suggested
that faculty members have such a
right.
He also questioned whether
SWOPSI had applied its criteria
consistently in considering courses.

REPORT IS IN — President Richard W. Lyman, right, appearing on KZSU's "Campus Conference" this week, said he was
"somewhat disappointed" in some aspects of the recent Committee on Undergraduate Studies report on SWOPSI's
rejection of a course proposed by Prof. William Shockley. However, Lyman indicated he would not press for a further
review of the matter.
