# Chino Verdict
## Why Burts Were Convicted 
### 
► Linda Grouse

Question: Do you see anyone
present in the court who was
present at the escape?
Answer: "No Sir."
"J have never seen these two
people [lookingstraight at Andrea
and Doug] before in my life."
These were the words of two
eyewitnesses to the
ambush-escape of Ronald Beaty
from Chino. Yet Andrea Holman
Burt and Doug Burt were judged
as having beyond a reasonable
doubt committed murder in the
second degree.
There is no question. The
Chino verdict is outrageous. Even
if you look mostly at the
prosecution witnesses, the verdict
is outrageous.
The first quote is from the
surviving prison guard who knew
Doug as an inmate, and who
didn't see either of the defendants
at the escape. The second quote is
from a man who was initially a
prosecution witness; but the
prosecution never called him and
he ended up a defense witness.
The only other witness to the
escape said Doug looked familiar
from the side view, but things had
happened so fast she couldn't be
sure. In her first report she said a
tree partly blocked her view from
100 feet, and that the three
people running from the ambush
were all dark, and probably
Mexican. Andrea and Doug are
both very light-skinned with
blondish-brown hair.
Boltcutters Sold?
After the escape, a store clerk
named Hemphill volunteered to
help the police. He said Andrea
was present when he sold some
boltcutters which might have been
used to cut Beaty's chains. He
described Andrea as having
straight black hair and was unable
to pick her out from photos the
police showed him. However,
after her picture appeared in the
press, he identified her.
But it turns out that between
June 1970 and February 1972 the
store only bought two such
boltcutters and the store's own
invoices show it is highly unlikely
that any boltcutters were sold
around the time Hemphill said he
saw Andrea.
Two gas station attendants,
who serviced the Olds and the
Falcon the state said were escape
cars, did not recognize the
defendants. In fact they described
the people inside the car as quite
different.
A criminologist who evaluated
the state's criminology report said

that it was impossible to associate
the hair in the escape cars with
Andrea and Doug.
O.K. then. The verdict is
outrageous.
But how did it happen? Let's
take a look at the main characters
in the scenario:
Beaty
Beaty admitted committing
perjury here and there in his
testimony. Joe Morgan, a former
Chino inmate who did time with
Beaty said Beaty had told him
that he was "playing the part" of
a revolutionary so he could
"infiltrate those creeps" and use
them as a bargaining tool if
anything went wrong with his
escape.
Morgan said that Beaty told
him that he would not turn in the
actual people who helped him so
he could use them again if he had
to.
Some more facts about Beaty:
After his first prison escape
attempt, Beaty tried to get
support from the Black Panthers,
claiming he had a letter from
George Jackson. It turned out he
didn't have a letter from George
Jackson.
In his first escape attempt he
commandeered a car, and then
claimed that the occupants he had
held as hostage were his
accomplices. They weren't.
Now, in this trial, Beaty
testified that he pleaded guilty to
first-degree murder and was
testifying against the defendants
in exchange for the dropping of
previous escape attempts against
him, for his safety being insured,
and "things of that nature."
This way, instead of getting a
life imprisonment sentance, Beaty
can be out of prison in seven
years.
The Burts
Who are the Burts? Two
revolutionaries who believe these
things:
—that black, brown, and all
other third-world people have a
right to self-determination.
— that workers, the
unemployed and the poor should
control the political system, so
that they, rather than a "ruling
class" of the wealthy can share in
the immense wealth that they
produce.
—that women have a right to
full equality.
—that because the ruling class
will attack by any means
necessary those who threaten its
privileges, if we are to achieve
these ends we have to be willing

to defend ourselves by any means
necessary.
—that it will take black, brown,
and white people together, and
disciplined "multinational"
revolutionary groups to help the
people bring about a socialist
revolution.
Movements On Trial
Both Andrea and Doug have
been active in the prison and
revolutionary movements. These
two movements, more than any
others, challenge the system
directly and it is these movements
which were really on trial.
The system will use any means
necessary to maintain itself.
Watergate, Attica, Vietnam, and
ITT have all proved this. The
Chino case just proves this once
more.
According to the prosecution
about 300 FBI and other agents
met in San Francisco to discuss
the Chino case, and called
area-wide meetings of local police
intelligence units.
In the trial itself the state
destroyed important evidence
which the court deemed favorable
to the defense.
Report Destroyed
A crucial report written by
Officer Hittson, who claimed to
have seen Andrea in the ambush
car, was destroyed. The D.A.
denied the existence of this
report, and when faced with
possible perjury action, the D.A.
defended his denial on the
grounds that after the report was
destroyed by the chief
prosecution investigator, it no
longer existed.
The state withheld exonerating
evidence. The police did not
report, as required by law, that
the store clerk was unable to
identify Andrea.
What can you do to help?
Publicly support Andrea and
Doug. They've got sentencing and
appeals to go through and public
support can make a big difference.
Support all political prisoners.
These are people fighting for
survival and for a just society.
Support the growing
revolutionary movement. Without
fundamental socialist change we
will continue to live in an
exploitive, corrupt, dog-eat-dog
world.
Why should you give your
support?
Because the "system" and
economy are crumbling. The U.S.
empire is being hit from the
outside as more and more
third-world countries free
themselves through revolution
from our economic grasp.
Hit From Inside
It is being hit from the inside
also as third-world communities
and workers are becoming more
and more willing to fight for
control over their own lives.
As the dollar continues to
crumble, growing numbers will
feel the crunch of inflation,
unemployment, poor medical
care, high rents, political
repression, and union busting.
And if you haven't done so
already, when you protest you
will feel the heel come down on
you, just as it is coming down on
us now.
The more you truly threaten
real change the more you will feel
the heel on your neck. As
someone wrote to Angela Davis, if
they take you away in the
morning, they'll be coming for us
that night.

cars, did not recognize the
defendants. In fact they described
the people inside the car as quite
different.
A criminologist who evaluated
the state's criminology report said

that it was impossible to associate
the hair in the escape cars with
Andrea and Doug.
O.K. then. The verdict is
outrageous.
But how did it happen? Let's
take a look at the main characters
in the scenario:
Beaty
Beaty admitted committing
perjury here and there in his
testimony. Joe Morgan, a former
Chino inmate who did time with
Beaty said Beaty had told him
that he was "playing the part" of
a revolutionary so he could
"infiltrate those creeps" and use
them as a bargaining tool if
anything went wrong with his
escape.
Morgan said that Beaty told
him that he would not turn in the
actual people who helped him so
he could use them again if he had
to.
Some more facts about Beaty:
After his first prison escape
attempt, Beaty tried to get
support from the Black Panthers,
claiming he had a letter from
George Jackson. It turned out he
didn't have a letter from George
Jackson.
In his first escape attempt he
commandeered a car, and then
claimed that the occupants he had
held as hostage were his
accomplices. They weren't.
Now, in this trial, Beaty
testified that he pleaded guilty to
first-degree murder and was
testifying against the defendants
in exchange for the dropping of
previous escape attempts against
him, for his safety being insured,
and "things of that nature."
This way, instead of getting a
life imprisonment sentance, Beaty
can be out of prison in seven
years.
The Burts
Who are the Burts? Two
revolutionaries who believe these
things:
—that black, brown, and all
other third-world people have a
right to self-determination.
— that workers, the
unemployed and the poor should
control the political system, so
that they, rather than a "ruling
class" of the wealthy can share in
the immense wealth that they
produce.
—that women have a right to
full equality.
—that because the ruling class
will attack by any means
necessary those who threaten its
privileges, if we are to achieve
these ends we have to be willing

to defend ourselves by any means
necessary.
—that it will take black, brown,
and white people together, and
disciplined "multinational"
revolutionary groups to help the
people bring about a socialist
revolution.
Movements On Trial
Both Andrea and Doug have
been active in the prison and
revolutionary movements. These
two movements, more than any
others, challenge the system
directly and it is these movements
which were really on trial.
The system will use any means
necessary to maintain itself.
Watergate, Attica, Vietnam, and
ITT have all proved this. The
Chino case just proves this once
more.
According to the prosecution
about 300 FBI and other agents
met in San Francisco to discuss
the Chino case, and called
area-wide meetings of local police
intelligence units.
In the trial itself the state
destroyed important evidence
which the court deemed favorable
to the defense.
Report Destroyed
A crucial report written by
Officer Hittson, who claimed to
have seen Andrea in the ambush
car, was destroyed. The D.A.
denied the existence of this
report, and when faced with
possible perjury action, the D.A.
defended his denial on the
grounds that after the report was
destroyed by the chief
prosecution investigator, it no
longer existed.
The state withheld exonerating
evidence. The police did not
report, as required by law, that
the store clerk was unable to
identify Andrea.
What can you do to help?
Publicly support Andrea and
Doug. They've got sentencing and
appeals to go through and public
support can make a big difference.
Support all political prisoners.
These are people fighting for
survival and for a just society.
Support the growing
revolutionary movement. Without
fundamental socialist change we
will continue to live in an
exploitive, corrupt, dog-eat-dog
world.
Why should you give your
support?
Because the "system" and
economy are crumbling. The U.S.
empire is being hit from the
outside as more and more
third-world countries free
themselves through revolution
from our economic grasp.
Hit From Inside
It is being hit from the inside
also as third-world communities
and workers are becoming more
and more willing to fight for
control over their own lives.
As the dollar continues to
crumble, growing numbers will
feel the crunch of inflation,
unemployment, poor medical
care, high rents, political
repression, and union busting.
And if you haven't done so
already, when you protest you
will feel the heel come down on
you, just as it is coming down on
us now.
The more you truly threaten
real change the more you will feel
the heel on your neck. As
someone wrote to Angela Davis, if
they take you away in the
morning, they'll be coming for us
that night.

Question: Do you see anyone
present in the court who was
present at the escape?
Answer: "No Sir."
"J have never seen these two
people [lookingstraight at Andrea
and Doug] before in my life."
These were the words of two
eyewitnesses to the
ambush-escape of Ronald Beaty
from Chino. Yet Andrea Holman
Burt and Doug Burt were judged
as having beyond a reasonable
doubt committed murder in the
second degree.
There is no question. The
Chino verdict is outrageous. Even
if you look mostly at the
prosecution witnesses, the verdict
is outrageous.
The first quote is from the
surviving prison guard who knew
Doug as an inmate, and who
didn't see either of the defendants
at the escape. The second quote is
from a man who was initially a
prosecution witness; but the
prosecution never called him and
he ended up a defense witness.
The only other witness to the
escape said Doug looked familiar
from the side view, but things had
happened so fast she couldn't be
sure. In her first report she said a
tree partly blocked her view from
100 feet, and that the three
people running from the ambush
were all dark, and probably
Mexican. Andrea and Doug are
both very light-skinned with
blondish-brown hair.
Boltcutters Sold?
After the escape, a store clerk
named Hemphill volunteered to
help the police. He said Andrea
was present when he sold some
boltcutters which might have been
used to cut Beaty's chains. He
described Andrea as having
straight black hair and was unable
to pick her out from photos the
police showed him. However,
after her picture appeared in the
press, he identified her.
But it turns out that between
June 1970 and February 1972 the
store only bought two such
boltcutters and the store's own
invoices show it is highly unlikely
that any boltcutters were sold
around the time Hemphill said he
saw Andrea.
Two gas station attendants,
who serviced the Olds and the
Falcon the state said were escape
cars, did not recognize the
defendants. In fact they described
the people inside the car as quite
different.
A criminologist who evaluated

—that women have a right to
full equality.
—that because the ruling class
will attack by any means
necessary those who threaten its
privileges, if we are to achieve
these ends we have to be willing

to defend ourselves by any means
necessary.
—that it will take black, brown,
and white people together, and
disciplined "multinational"
revolutionary groups to help the
people bring about a socialist
revolution.
Movements On Trial
Both Andrea and Doug have
been active in the prison and
revolutionary movements. These
two movements, more than any
others, challenge the system
directly and it is these movements
which were really on trial.
The system will use any means
necessary to maintain itself.
Watergate, Attica, Vietnam, and
ITT have all proved this. The
Chino case just proves this once
more.
According to the prosecution
about 300 FBI and other agents
met in San Francisco to discuss
the Chino case, and called
area-wide meetings of local police
intelligence units.
In the trial itself the state
destroyed important evidence
which the court deemed favorable
to the defense.
Report Destroyed
A crucial report written by
Officer Hittson, who claimed to
have seen Andrea in the ambush
car, was destroyed. The D.A.
denied the existence of this
report, and when faced with
possible perjury action, the D.A.
defended his denial on the
grounds that after the report was
destroyed by the chief
prosecution investigator, it no
longer existed.
The state withheld exonerating
evidence. The police did not
report, as required by law, that
the store clerk was unable to
identify Andrea.
What can you do to help?
Publicly support Andrea and
Doug. They've got sentencing and
appeals to go through and public
support can make a big difference.
Support all political prisoners.
These are people fighting for
survival and for a just society.
Support the growing
revolutionary movement. Without
fundamental socialist change we
will continue to live in an
exploitive, corrupt, dog-eat-dog
world.
Why should you give your
support?
Because the "system" and
economy are crumbling. The U.S.
empire is being hit from the
outside as more and more
third-world countries free
themselves through revolution
from our economic grasp.
Hit From Inside
It is being hit from the inside
also as third-world communities
and workers are becoming more
and more willing to fight for
control over their own lives.
As the dollar continues to
crumble, growing numbers will
feel the crunch of inflation,
unemployment, poor medical
care, high rents, political
repression, and union busting.
And if you haven't done so
already, when you protest you
will feel the heel come down on
you, just as it is coming down on
us now.
The more you truly threaten
real change the more you will feel
the heel on your neck. As
someone wrote to Angela Davis, if
they take you away in the
morning, they'll be coming for us
that night.

Question: Do you see anyone
present in the court who was
present at the escape?
Answer: "No Sir."
"J have never seen these two
people [lookingstraight at Andrea
and Doug] before in my life."
These were the words of two
eyewitnesses to the
ambush-escape of Ronald Beaty
from Chino. Yet Andrea Holman
Burt and Doug Burt were judged
as having beyond a reasonable
doubt committed murder in the
second degree.
There is no question. The
Chino verdict is outrageous. Even
if you look mostly at the
prosecution witnesses, the verdict
is outrageous.
The first quote is from the
surviving prison guard who knew
Doug as an inmate, and who
didn't see either of the defendants
at the escape. The second quote is
from a man who was initially a
prosecution witness; but the
prosecution never called him and
he ended up a defense witness.
The only other witness to the
escape said Doug looked familiar
from the side view, but things had
happened so fast she couldn't be
sure. In her first report she said a
tree partly blocked her view from
100 feet, and that the three
people running from the ambush
were all dark, and probably
Mexican. Andrea and Doug are
both very light-skinned with
blondish-brown hair.
Boltcutters Sold?
After the escape, a store clerk
named Hemphill volunteered to
help the police. He said Andrea
was present when he sold some
boltcutters which might have been
used to cut Beaty's chains. He
described Andrea as having
straight black hair and was unable
to pick her out from photos the
police showed him. However,
after her picture appeared in the
press, he identified her.
But it turns out that between
June 1970 and February 1972 the
store only bought two such
boltcutters and the store's own
invoices show it is highly unlikely
that any boltcutters were sold
around the time Hemphill said he
saw Andrea.
Two gas station attendants,
who serviced the Olds and the
Falcon the state said were escape
cars, did not recognize the
defendants. In fact they described
the people inside the car as quite
different.
A criminologist who evaluated
the state's criminology report said

that it was impossible to associate
the hair in the escape cars with
Andrea and Doug.
O.K. then. The verdict is
outrageous.
But how did it happen? Let's
take a look at the main characters
in the scenario:
Beaty
Beaty admitted committing
perjury here and there in his
testimony. Joe Morgan, a former
Chino inmate who did time with
Beaty said Beaty had told him
that he was "playing the part" of
a revolutionary so he could
"infiltrate those creeps" and use
them as a bargaining tool if
anything went wrong with his
escape.
Morgan said that Beaty told
him that he would not turn in the
actual people who helped him so
he could use them again if he had
to.
Some more facts about Beaty:
After his first prison escape
attempt, Beaty tried to get
support from the Black Panthers,
claiming he had a letter from
George Jackson. It turned out he
didn't have a letter from George
Jackson.
In his first escape attempt he
commandeered a car, and then
claimed that the occupants he had
held as hostage were his
accomplices. They weren't.
Now, in this trial, Beaty
testified that he pleaded guilty to
first-degree murder and was
testifying against the defendants
in exchange for the dropping of
previous escape attempts against
him, for his safety being insured,
and "things of that nature."
This way, instead of getting a
life imprisonment sentance, Beaty
can be out of prison in seven
years.
The Burts
Who are the Burts? Two
revolutionaries who believe these
things:
—that black, brown, and all
other third-world people have a
right to self-determination.
— that workers, the
unemployed and the poor should
control the political system, so
that they, rather than a "ruling
class" of the wealthy can share in
the immense wealth that they
produce.
—that women have a right to
full equality.
—that because the ruling class
will attack by any means
necessary those who threaten its
privileges, if we are to achieve
these ends we have to be willing

to defend ourselves by any means
necessary.
—that it will take black, brown,
and white people together, and
disciplined "multinational"
revolutionary groups to help the
people bring about a socialist
revolution.

economy are crumbling. The U.S.
empire is being hit from the
outside as more and more
third-world countries free
themselves through revolution
from our economic grasp.
Hit From Inside
It is being hit from the inside
also as third-world communities
and workers are becoming more
and more willing to fight for
control over their own lives.
As the dollar continues to
crumble, growing numbers will
feel the crunch of inflation,
unemployment, poor medical
care, high rents, political
repression, and union busting.
And if you haven't done so
already, when you protest you
will feel the heel come down on
you, just as it is coming down on
us now.
The more you truly threaten
real change the more you will feel
the heel on your neck. As
someone wrote to Angela Davis, if
they take you away in the
morning, they'll be coming for us
that night.

Question: Do you see anyone
present in the court who was
present at the escape?
Answer: "No Sir."
"J have never seen these two
people [lookingstraight at Andrea
and Doug] before in my life."
These were the words of two
eyewitnesses to the
ambush-escape of Ronald Beaty
from Chino. Yet Andrea Holman
Burt and Doug Burt were judged
as having beyond a reasonable
doubt committed murder in the
second degree.
There is no question. The
Chino verdict is outrageous. Even
if you look mostly at the
prosecution witnesses, the verdict
is outrageous.
The first quote is from the
surviving prison guard who knew
Doug as an inmate, and who
didn't see either of the defendants
at the escape. The second quote is
from a man who was initially a
prosecution witness; but the
prosecution never called him and
he ended up a defense witness.
The only other witness to the
escape said Doug looked familiar
from the side view, but things had
happened so fast she couldn't be
sure. In her first report she said a
tree partly blocked her view from
100 feet, and that the three
people running from the ambush
were all dark, and probably
Mexican. Andrea and Doug are
both very light-skinned with
blondish-brown hair.
Boltcutters Sold?
After the escape, a store clerk
named Hemphill volunteered to
help the police. He said Andrea
was present when he sold some
boltcutters which might have been
used to cut Beaty's chains. He
described Andrea as having
straight black hair and was unable
to pick her out from photos the
police showed him. However,
after her picture appeared in the
press, he identified her.
But it turns out that between
June 1970 and February 1972 the
store only bought two such
boltcutters and the store's own
invoices show it is highly unlikely
that any boltcutters were sold
around the time Hemphill said he
saw Andrea.
Two gas station attendants,
who serviced the Olds and the
Falcon the state said were escape
cars, did not recognize the
defendants. In fact they described
the people inside the car as quite
different.
A criminologist who evaluated
the state's criminology report said

that it was impossible to associate
the hair in the escape cars with
Andrea and Doug.
O.K. then. The verdict is
outrageous.
But how did it happen? Let's
take a look at the main characters
in the scenario:
Beaty
Beaty admitted committing
perjury here and there in his
testimony. Joe Morgan, a former
Chino inmate who did time with
Beaty said Beaty had told him
that he was "playing the part" of
a revolutionary so he could
"infiltrate those creeps" and use
them as a bargaining tool if
anything went wrong with his
escape.
Morgan said that Beaty told
him that he would not turn in the
actual people who helped him so
he could use them again if he had
to.
Some more facts about Beaty:
After his first prison escape
attempt, Beaty tried to get
support from the Black Panthers,
claiming he had a letter from
George Jackson. It turned out he
didn't have a letter from George
Jackson.
In his first escape attempt he
commandeered a car, and then
claimed that the occupants he had
held as hostage were his
accomplices. They weren't.
Now, in this trial, Beaty
testified that he pleaded guilty to
first-degree murder and was
testifying against the defendants
in exchange for the dropping of
previous escape attempts against
him, for his safety being insured,
and "things of that nature."
This way, instead of getting a
life imprisonment sentance, Beaty
can be out of prison in seven
years.
The Burts
Who are the Burts? Two
revolutionaries who believe these
things:
—that black, brown, and all
other third-world people have a
right to self-determination.
— that workers, the
unemployed and the poor should
control the political system, so
that they, rather than a "ruling
class" of the wealthy can share in
the immense wealth that they
produce.
—that women have a right to
full equality.
—that because the ruling class
will attack by any means
necessary those who threaten its
privileges, if we are to achieve
these ends we have to be willing

to defend ourselves by any means
necessary.
—that it will take black, brown,
and white people together, and
disciplined "multinational"
revolutionary groups to help the
people bring about a socialist
revolution.
Movements On Trial
Both Andrea and Doug have
been active in the prison and
revolutionary movements. These
two movements, more than any
others, challenge the system
directly and it is these movements
which were really on trial.
The system will use any means
necessary to maintain itself.
Watergate, Attica, Vietnam, and
ITT have all proved this. The
Chino case just proves this once
more.
According to the prosecution
about 300 FBI and other agents
met in San Francisco to discuss
the Chino case, and called
area-wide meetings of local police
intelligence units.
In the trial itself the state
destroyed important evidence
which the court deemed favorable
to the defense.
Report Destroyed
A crucial report written by
Officer Hittson, who claimed to
have seen Andrea in the ambush
car, was destroyed. The D.A.
denied the existence of this
report, and when faced with
possible perjury action, the D.A.
defended his denial on the
grounds that after the report was
destroyed by the chief
prosecution investigator, it no
longer existed.
The state withheld exonerating
evidence. The police did not
report, as required by law, that
the store clerk was unable to
identify Andrea.
What can you do to help?
Publicly support Andrea and
Doug. They've got sentencing and
appeals to go through and public
support can make a big difference.
Support all political prisoners.
These are people fighting for
survival and for a just society.
Support the growing
revolutionary movement. Without
fundamental socialist change we
will continue to live in an
exploitive, corrupt, dog-eat-dog
world.
Why should you give your
support?
Because the "system" and
economy are crumbling. The U.S.
empire is being hit from the
outside as more and more
third-world countries free
themselves through revolution
from our economic grasp.
