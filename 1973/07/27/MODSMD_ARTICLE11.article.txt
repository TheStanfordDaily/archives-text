# City Council Approves PA-University Liason
## 
### 
The Palo Alto City Council
Monday night unanimously
endorsed a top level staff liaison
committee between the city and
the University.
The committee will discuss
mutual problems such as land use,
cable television and joint services
such as fire, sewage and
recreation.
University Vice President for
Business and Finance Robert
Augsburger and Palo Alto City
Manager George Sipel will head
the liaison agency. Staff membrs
from each jurisdiction will join
the administrative body, but no
city council men or University
trustees will be members.
The committee will meet
privately at least once a month,
followed by public reports to the
city council and private reports to
University officials on the actions
of the committee.

Council approval followed an
announcement July 11 from
President Richard Lyman and
Palo Alto Mayor Kirke Comstock
recommending the liaison
committee.
Lyman and Comstock met
earlier that day along with Sipel,
Law Prof. Byron Sher (a
newly-elected city councilman),
Augsburger and Board of Trustees
President Robert Minge Brown to
assess the proposal and suggest
issues for the committee to
discuss.
The city council will evaluate
the committee after six months
and decide then whether city
representatives remain on the
committee, Comstock told the
Daily Wednesday.
The mayor expressed optimism
toward the committee, but he
stated, "There are going to be
problems. This has to be an
evolutionary thing."
