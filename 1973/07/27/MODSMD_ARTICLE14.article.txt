# Carole King Views Life In 'Fantasy'

Carole King: "Fantasy"
(Ode 5P77018)
Up to now, Carole King hasn't
come close to emulating her
stunning performance on
"Tapestry," where each song
stood by itself under a mark of
excellence. Carole's latest album
doesn't equal "Tapestry" (nothing
really could), but it too achieves
excellence in a different way.
Individually, the songs are not
all superb but together, they form
a pattern of socially relevant
thoughts that reveal Carole's
whole-souled approach to life and
to her music. Therefore, to get the
full impact of this album, it must
be listened to all at once rather
than in pieces.
Carole can't sing well, but her
deep yet mellow voice is perfect
for the emotional, honest songs
she writes. This album is more
than an album—it is, in keeping
with a pattern set by "Tapestry,"
a total experience, a venture into
the mind of a musical genius.
The music on the album is far
superior to the performances
registered on her last two albums,
"Rhymes and Reasons" and
"Music." And it is all woven into
the theme of Carole's fantasy—her
visions of what life is and what it
could be.
She starts with a selection
labeled "Fantasy Beginning," in
which she simply says that she's

"looking for a way to say the
things I think about day by day.
Listen to their meaning if you
can."
Carole then proceeds to
contrast reality with idealism.
Unlike previous albums, Carole
draws not on personal experience
for her songs but she now bases
material on observations of
others. But her views still ring
true, not cheap or solely aimed at
making a buck. Therefore, she
succeeds.
She speaks of "Being At War
With Each Other" and then sings
"Directions," in which she sees
hope even though "directions
presenting themselves everyday
are bypassed cause of somebody
else's foolish limitations."
"That's How Things Go
Down" follows with a nice organ
solo and here Carole speaks of
wanting to see the father of her
child again—he has left her
behind. She contrasts this view in
"Weekdays," where she sings of
the dull role of a housewife, still
indicating hope: "I've been with
you and you need me to take care
of you. But we'll work it out so
I'm a person too."
Side Two begins with
"Haywood," which has been
getting some air play, a story
about her brother who is heavily
into dope. She then sings of a
"Quiet Place To Live" contrasted

with "Welfare Symphony" about
a woman in the ghetto having
trouble collecting welfare checks.
The current single from the
album is "You Light Up My
Life," a rhythmic melody in
which Carole expresses faith in
her love. ("You brought me faith
and hope and love and light.")
The album ends on a truly
optimistic note. We hear Carole's
heart beating rapidly in
"Corozon," a fast paced latin
rhythm, and then she sings
"Believe In Humanity." That's the
point of the album.

In "Fantasy End," Carole
concludes:
You may think there's nothing
you can do
To change what's all too true
But all you have to do is use
your mind
She certainly has used it here
to construct a well-integrated ,
jam-packed and smoothly flowing
collectionof songs from the heart.
The album probably won't turn
out much "hit" material but it
definitely ranks as one of the
year's best.

true, not cheap or solely aimed at

succeeds.
She speaks of "Being At War

"Directions," in which she sees
hope even though "directions

"That's How Things Go

solo and here Carole speaks of
wanting to see the father of her
child again—he has left her
behind. She contrasts this view in
"Weekdays," where she sings of
the dull role of a housewife, still

"Haywood," which has been
getting some air play, a story
about her brother who is heavily
into dope. She then sings of a
"Quiet Place To Live" contrasted

with "Welfare Symphony" about
a woman in the ghetto having
trouble collecting welfare checks.
The current single from the
album is "You Light Up My
Life," a rhythmic melody in
which Carole expresses faith in
her love. ("You brought me faith
and hope and love and light.")
The album ends on a truly
optimistic note. We hear Carole's
heart beating rapidly in
"Corozon," a fast paced latin
rhythm, and then she sings
"Believe In Humanity." That's the
point of the album.

In "Fantasy End," Carole
concludes:
You may think there's nothing
you can do
To change what's all too true
But all you have to do is use
your mind
She certainly has used it here
to construct a well-integrated ,
jam-packed and smoothly flowing
collectionof songs from the heart.
The album probably won't turn
out much "hit" material but it
definitely ranks as one of the
year's best.

Carole King: "Fantasy"
(Ode 5P77018)
Up to now, Carole King hasn't
come close to emulating her
stunning performance on
"Tapestry," where each song
stood by itself under a mark of
excellence. Carole's latest album
doesn't equal "Tapestry" (nothing
really could), but it too achieves
excellence in a different way.
Individually, the songs are not
all superb but together, they form
a pattern of socially relevant
thoughts that reveal Carole's
whole-souled approach to life and
to her music. Therefore, to get the
full impact of this album, it must
be listened to all at once rather
than in pieces.
Carole can't sing well, but her
deep yet mellow voice is perfect
for the emotional, honest songs
she writes. This album is more
than an album—it is, in keeping
with a pattern set by "Tapestry,"
a total experience, a venture into
the mind of a musical genius.
The music on the album is far
superior to the performances
registered on her last two albums,
"Rhymes and Reasons" and
"Music." And it is all woven into
the theme of Carole's fantasy—her
visions of what life is and what it
could be.
She starts with a selection
labeled "Fantasy Beginning," in
which she simply says that she's

"looking for a way to say the
things I think about day by day.
Listen to their meaning if you
can."
Carole then proceeds to
contrast reality with idealism.
Unlike previous albums, Carole
draws not on personal experience
for her songs but she now bases
material on observations of
others. But her views still ring
true, not cheap or solely aimed at
making a buck. Therefore, she
