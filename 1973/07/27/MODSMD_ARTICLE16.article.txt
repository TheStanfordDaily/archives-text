# 'Passion Play'
## Jethro Tull Thrills Audience 
### DEBBIE SEAMAN 
Jethro Tull has never been more theatrical than
on its current concert tour. If the music of the
group's latest effort, A Passion Play, is lacking the
novelty and excitement which made their previous
albums so outstanding, this certainly was not
evident when they performed it at Oakland
Coliseum Monday night.
Tull concerts are always charged with
excitement, and this one was no exception. The
very presence of the group, along with the spectacle
the show provided, more than compensated for any
musical deficiency.
A Passion Play is a complete stage performance,
equipped with the masks of Tragedy and Comedy, a
movie screen at the back of the stage and twelve
flying platform sound speakers, among other
effects.
Glowing Orb
The images on the movie screen — such as a
glowing orb which pulsated and expanded to the
sound of a heartbeat and a death-like ballerina who
rose eerily from the ground and then danced her
way into the other side of a mirror — were designed
to boggle the mind.
Judging from the reactions of the audience, the
impact was successful despite (or perhaps because
of) the fact that they didn't exactly make sense.
In the middle of A Passion Play, the group left
the stage and the screen again came alive, this time
with "The Hare Who Lost His Spectacles" a
sometimes-charming, sometimes-satanic animal
fable.
A Passion Play was a good show, but the concert
later became excellent when the group launched
into some of its older songs.
Here, no special effects were needed — the music
was forceful enough and the antics of group
members on stage were certainly theatrical enough
to hold their own.
Center Stage
lan Anderson, lead singer, flautist and acoustic
guitarist, took center stage as always. However, he
almost never went into his famous flute stance,
balancing on one leg with his head cocked.

Instead he was dynamic-twisting, leaping,
pimacing as he sang tunes such as "Aqualung" and
Cross-Eyed Mary." Occasionally, as in parts of
"Thick As A Brick," he proved his ability to be
plaintive as well.
Martin Barre on lead guitar and Jeffrey
Hammond-Hammond on bass moved to and fro,
staging duels with their guitars. Each showed his
individual skill in later solos.
John Evan, who plays piano and organ, cut a
comic figure as he performed stunts and ran madly
around the stage. Also, his facial expressions were
quite unique. Needless to say, he played excellent
piano and organ, doing a lengthy solo introduction
to "Locomotive Breath."
Background
Drummer Barriemore Barlow remained pretty
much in the background until the spotlight found
him near the end of the concert. He performed a
frenzied but skillful drum solo which ended in a
cloud of smoke.
Tull took their bows after these solos were
concluded. Their fans had to work hard, clapping
and stomping for about 10 minutes, to get them
back for an encore. It was worth it.
A long version of "Wind-Up" ended the show,
with Anderson at his versatile best. One minute he
would be appealing, singing alone with his acoustic
guitar and looking down and around at his audience.
Then the group would burst into music so
charged that you could feel it down to your toes,
and Anderson would fly around the stage as if
possessed by some sort of demon.
Electric Excitement
Whatever demon it was, the audience felt it too.
It was impossible to keep still: you could not help
feeling the electric excitement in the air and
responding to it.
"I didn't mind if they groomed me for success,"
sang Anderson, pausing to make a face and spit on
the ground in disgust. Whether or not he was
groomed for success is immaterial. But from the
reaction of the concert audience alone, it is obvious
that he and the other members of Jethro Tull have
found it.
