# Future Stanford Coed Claims Beauty Crown
## 
### GEORGE POWELL 
SAN JOSE—Many people are
unaware of the vast amount of
effort that goes into the selection
of Miss Santa Clara County for
1973. But the contest at the Santa
Clara County Fairgrounds last
Saturday revealed as much about
the people involved as it did about
beauty pageants.
It was rather refreshing (like
laxatives for the constipated) to
see 300 to 400 people commit
themselves so totally to truth,
justice, and an idealized, sterilized
vision of femininity and youth
that is far removed from the
affairs of a more mundane and
dirty world.
The winner (in case anyone is
still unaware) was Miss Constance
Laila DeCampo of San Jose who
plays Chopin on the piano, likes
ice cream, and plans to attend
Stanford.
A Stanford graduate, Nancy
Kay Houfek, was third runner-up
in the contest.
Even the red and white colors
on stage were reminiscent of
Stanford football. But that's
about as far as Stanford intruded
into one's thoughts as the
evening's events unfolded.
A crowd that nearly filled
Fiesta Hall witnessed "The Sweet
Beginning," the theme of this
year's contest.
And sweet it was. After the
overture, KNTV (Channel 2) news

director Fred LaCosse bounced on
stage crooning "Joy to the World"
in a way that would make even
Three Dog Night wince.
When 18 dancing potential
Miss Santa Clara Counties gussied
up in red and white costumes
joined LaCosse on stage, the
audience reacted as if Tom Jones
had suddenly dropped in.
LaCosse was glossy in his stage
presence, but so was the entire
production. It was similar to a
pair of highly polished but
inexpensive shoes that are
someone's idea of with-it fashion;
once you have bought them, the
shoes fall apart after a few
wea rings.
Flags waved, the New Christy
Minstrels sang, and La Cosse
sang—again and again. The dancers
tapped out a routine to "Tie a
Yellow Ribbon Around the Old
Oak Tree" and engaged in other
amazing feats that didn't remotely
resemble the dancing of the
Golddiggers or the Rockettes.
The talent competition
featured the usual run of pianists,
dancers, singers, and even a baton
twirler who dropped her baton
three times and received the most
boisterous applause from the
audience for her fighting spirit.
There was nothing original
about the swimsuit competition.
All contestants are still required
to wear one-piece paneled suits
that appear specifically made to
conceal any hint of female
sexuality.
After a few more
announcements and praise for the
Miss America-sanctioned contest
("70,000 girls compete annually
for over $850,000 in scholarship
money"), and how this contest
offers young America a showcase
for its talents, opinions, goals,
etc., etc., the winner and
runners-up were announced.
Amidst all the flawless
complexions and yards of
well-tanned thighs, I wondered
about the social and political
import of what I had just
witnessed.

beauty pageants.
It was rather refreshing (like
laxatives for the constipated) to
see 300 to 400 people commit
themselves so totally to truth,
justice, and an idealized, sterilized
vision of femininity and youth
that is far removed from the
affairs of a more mundane and
dirty world.
The winner (in case anyone is
still unaware) was Miss Constance
Laila DeCampo of San Jose who
plays Chopin on the piano, likes
ice cream, and plans to attend
Stanford.
A Stanford graduate, Nancy
Kay Houfek, was third runner-up
in the contest.
Even the red and white colors
on stage were reminiscent of
Stanford football. But that's
about as far as Stanford intruded
into one's thoughts as the
evening's events unfolded.
A crowd that nearly filled
Fiesta Hall witnessed "The Sweet
Beginning," the theme of this
year's contest.
And sweet it was. After the
overture, KNTV (Channel 2) news

director Fred LaCosse bounced on
stage crooning "Joy to the World"
in a way that would make even
Three Dog Night wince.
When 18 dancing potential
Miss Santa Clara Counties gussied
up in red and white costumes
joined LaCosse on stage, the
audience reacted as if Tom Jones
had suddenly dropped in.
LaCosse was glossy in his stage
presence, but so was the entire
production. It was similar to a
pair of highly polished but
inexpensive shoes that are
someone's idea of with-it fashion;
once you have bought them, the
shoes fall apart after a few
wea rings.
Flags waved, the New Christy
Minstrels sang, and La Cosse
sang—again and again. The dancers
tapped out a routine to "Tie a
Yellow Ribbon Around the Old
Oak Tree" and engaged in other
amazing feats that didn't remotely
resemble the dancing of the
Golddiggers or the Rockettes.
The talent competition
featured the usual run of pianists,
dancers, singers, and even a baton
twirler who dropped her baton
three times and received the most
boisterous applause from the
audience for her fighting spirit.
There was nothing original
about the swimsuit competition.
All contestants are still required
to wear one-piece paneled suits
that appear specifically made to
conceal any hint of female
sexuality.
After a few more
announcements and praise for the
Miss America-sanctioned contest
("70,000 girls compete annually
for over $850,000 in scholarship
money"), and how this contest
offers young America a showcase
for its talents, opinions, goals,
etc., etc., the winner and
runners-up were announced.
Amidst all the flawless
complexions and yards of
well-tanned thighs, I wondered
about the social and political
import of what I had just
witnessed.
SAN JOSE—Many people are
unaware of the vast amount of
effort that goes into the selection
of Miss Santa Clara County for
1973. But the contest at the Santa
Clara County Fairgrounds last
Saturday revealed as much about
the people involved as it did about
beauty pageants.
