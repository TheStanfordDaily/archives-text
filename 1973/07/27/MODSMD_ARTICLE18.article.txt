# 'Cope': A Source Of Great Joy

SAN FRANCISCO—JoyfuI
experiences in San Francisco
theatre this summer are few and
far between.
Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope
which opened last Friday at the
Geary Theatre however, stands
out as a memorable and enjoyable
experience. Cope has had highly
successful runs in New York, Los
Angeles, Chicago, and Toronto.
The all-Black 18-member Toronto
cast has brought Cope to the City
and nothing has been lost in the
translation.
Cope is described as a new
musical experience. The songs of
Mikki King do not construct a
story line as such, but serve to
build a powerful emotion in the
audience.
Salome Bey and the cast begin
the show on a note of firm
resolution. Bey's resonant and
powerful voice leaves no doubt as
to her goal in "I Gotta Keep
Movin'She sings, "I gotta keep
pushin,' pushin' till I get in."
The cast moves on through a

series of numbers designed to
display the richness and variety of
Black music. They span the
spectrum from West Indian
influence on Black music to the
electronic Shaft-type music. One
message pervades this melange of
musical styles, however. The
Black's plight in American
history, from slavery to the
modern ghetto, is emphasized, as
well as their determination to
overcome.
Sherman Hemsley possesses a
rubber face and a comic wit, and
draws many laughs for his brand
of social commentary. Singing of
ghetto life without the luxury of
windows, Hemsley moans, "I'm
getting tired of scraping Jack
Frost off my skin."
Hemsley emphasizes the

difference in his perspective and
the audience's in "Lookin' Over
From Your Side." "Lookin' over
from your side everything seems
peace and quiet, but if you were
lookin' over from my side you
might start to riot."
The beautiful voice and stage
presence of Lee Kirk brings life to
"Blues" and "Thank Heaven For
You," two more of the many
musical styles displayed in the
first act.
The first act ends as it began:
on a note of resolution. The cast
sings "They Keep Coming," a
chronicle of the achievements of
individual Blacks. Edmond
Wesley, whose talents dominate
the show along with Kirk's and
Bey's, closes the act with "My
Name Is Man." Wesley stands at

center stage and with chest
thrown out, asserts his natural
rights and manhood. His
incredible dancing and singing
skills qualify him for stardom.
The cast conveyed their first
act message well. They left the
audience in sympathy with
Blacks' plight, but unsure of what
to do about it.
In the most beautiful song in
the production, "It Takes A
Whole Lot Of Human Feeling,"
Salome Bey and Lee Kirk begin to
provide an answer. Their powerful
and emotional plea for
brotherhood and understanding
finally unites everyone in the
theatre and dampens a few eyes.
After a brief moment of
silence, Billy Dorsey and the
company break into the raucous
and infectous "Good
Vibrations." (Not the Beach Boy's
song.) The shift was far too
abrupt, but this was soon
forgotten as Dorsey and friends
fanned through the audience
shaking hands and spreading
cheer. The cast spent a good deal
of time in the audience during the
last five numbers of the show,
clapping, singing, conversing, and
clasping hands.
Salome Bey and her magic
voice dominated the stage action
during this time, and by the time
she finished "Do A Little Living
In Peace" and broke into
"Universe In Morning," the entire
audience was standing and
swaying with hands interlocked.
Most of the performers were part
of the audience by now as Bey
carried the message that everyone
could believe in.
Audience participation can be
a terribly phony thing. The cast
never came on too strong
ideologically. Their militancy as
well as brotherhood appeals were
muted, allowing the audience to
interpret the material and involve
themselves accordingly.
Cope is a joyous hymn. It
begins to convey its message
through song and dance. Cope's
beauty is that it allows the
audience to finish it.
