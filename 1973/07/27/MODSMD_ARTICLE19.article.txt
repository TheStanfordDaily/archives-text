# Jazz Recordings Showcase Concord Festival Guitarists
## 
### 
Jim Hall: "It's Nice To Be With
You"
(BASF 20708)
Although jazz guitarist Jim
Hall easily ranks with names like
Barney Kessell, Kenny Burrell,
and Johnny Smith, he is often
overlooked if not completely
forgotten. This LP, recorded in
1969 in Berlin, is the first record
Hall has made under his own
name in over ten years.
Jim Hall describes his own
style this way: "I play simple, the
only way I can do it, anyway."
Hall combines this simplicity with
an unbelievable mastery of
technique, and the result is some
of the tastiest jazz to be heard.
Hall recently performed at the
Bay Area Jazz Festival's "Guitar
Explosion" where he all but stole
the show.
On this album, Hall is backed
by Jimmy Woode on bass and
Daniel Humair on drums. They
play some jazz standards, a few of
Hall's own compositions, and a
jazz interpretation of "Up, Up,
and Away."
The best cut by far is Hall's
version of Duke Ellington's classic
"In A Sentimental Mood," with
two guitar tracks and no back-up.
The Oscar Peterson Trio with
Herb Ellis: "Hello Herbie"
(BASF 20723)
Another giant of jazz guitar is
Herb Ellis. Here he is reunited
with the great Oscar Petersons,
whom he played with during the
50s.
Peterson is probably the most
talented jazz pianist alive today,
and this album represents a great
interplay of two musical
masterminds, or should I say
four? The quartet is rounded out
with Sam Jones on bass, and Bob
Durham on drums.
On this album, recorded in
1969, one can immediately see
that these musicians know each
other's styles and show a lot of
respect for each other. At the
same time it is also immediately
evident that they really had a lot
of fun at this session.
Joe Pass: "Intercontinental"
(BASF 20738)
Currently touring with Herb
Ellis as a duo is guitarist Joe Pass.

In my opinion, there is no
guitarist who swings like Joe Pass.
This album marks the first solo
effort to really do justice to this
fine guitarist. It's just Pass, backed
by bassist Eberhard Weber and
drummer Kenny Calre, a fine
rhythm section.
Pass plays with beautiful
darity, and holds back on his
amazing speed just enough,
teasing the listener with only an
occasional lightning riff.
The influence of blues and
bebop is quite noticeable in Pass'
playing, especially on "Joe's
Blues," and"I Love You" (a
fantastic cut). Pass also handles
bossa nova well on "Meditation,"

"Watch What Happens" and "El
Gento."
But the best cut is saved for
last; Count Basie's beautiful "LiP
Darlin'." On this band Pass shows
that he is as good on the slow
tunes as he is on the fast ones.
Pass and Ellis have recently
released an LP together on the
Concord Jazz label.
All three of these impressive
guitarists, and Oscar Peterson will
be appearing at this year's
Concord Jazz Festival. Ellis and
Pass will be together on a show
which also features Oscar
Peterson, July 29. Jim Hall will
play on August 4.
