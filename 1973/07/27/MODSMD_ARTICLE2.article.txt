# CLASSIC 'ACUTE PARANOID STATE'
## Students Study '62 Nixon Tape 
### 
Stanford psychiatry classes have used a tape of
President Nixon's bitter concession speech in the 1962
California gubernatorial election as a classic example of
"acute paranoid state," the Chicago Sun-Times
reported in its edition this morning.
The speech, a rambling tirade delivered to newsmen
in Beverly Hills after Nixon's defeat by Democratic
Gov. Edmund G. Brown, is best remembered for the
famous quote:
"You won't have Nixon to kick around any more,
because, gentlemen, this is my last press conference."
The report, from the newspaper's Washington
bureau, said the tape was "integrated into the graduate
curriculum at the Stanford University Medical School."
Med Center officials did not deny to Sun-Times
reporters that the tapes had been used, but were
reluctant to provide any further details.
No Comment
"I have to be extremely cautious," said Dr. Peter
Rosenbaum, director of graduate training in the
Psychiatry Clinic.
"I think in view of the extreme sensitivity of this,
I'd simply prefer not to comment. This is such a
sensitive matter."
Dr. Donald Lunde, assistant professor of psychiatry
and head of the department's undergraduate training

program, confirmed existence of the tape, but would
not go into details.
"I know what you're talking about, but I've never
used it [in the training of undergraduates]," he said.
'Common Gossip'
The paper hinted that another west coast medical
school may be making similar use of the tape, and said
that the use of the tape has been "common gossip"
among psychiatrists for some time.
The use of the tape began receiving more attention
following the President's responses to the recent
Watergate developments.
Blakiston's New Gould Medical Dictionary defines a
"paranoid personality" as one "characterized by the
tendency to project hostile feelings so that he always is
or easily becomes suspicious of others, and is quick to
feel persecuted and jealous."
The "acute paranoid state," which the Nixon speech
was used to illustrate, is defined as "a form of paranoid
reaction characterized by delusions of persecution and
sometimes of grandeur, but without the systemization
and manifestations of bizarre fragmentation and
deterioration of the schizoid reaction."
Blakiston's notes that paranoid reactions, when held
in reasonable control, do not constitute mental illness
or "nervous breakdowns."
