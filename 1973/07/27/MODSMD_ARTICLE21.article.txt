House Okays Foreign Aid Bill
WASHINGTON — The U.S. House of Representatives
passed a bill last night approving a $2.8 billion foreign aid
program for the coming year.
The bill, which passed by a thin 188-183 margin,
includes an amendment which denies funds to countries
expropriating U.S. owned businesses without adequate
compensation.
Another amendment to the bill, which would have
provided subsidies to developing nations for buying U.S.
exports, was defeated.
Three Precision Pilots Killed
LAKEHURST, N.J. — Three Navy fliers were killed and
one injured yesterday afternoon when two planes in the
Blue Angels flying team crashed.
Two fliers were aboard both of the two-seat model
planes, when the planes went down near the Naval Air
Station at Lakehurst, N.J.
A total of 10 men have died since the formation of the
precision flying team after World War 11.
The Navy reported that one of the planes was flying
upside-down at the time of the crash.
Lakehurst was the scene of one of the nation's worst
air disasters, when, in 1937, the German dirigible
Hindenburg exploded, killing 39 persons.
U£. Vetoes Anti-Israel Move
UNITED NATIONS — The United States yesterday cast
only the fifth United Nations Security Council veto in its
history.
The U.S. vetoed the resolution which would have
condemned Israel for holding on to Arab lands it has
occupied since 1967. It marked the second time the U.S.
has vetoed such a proposal.
The final vote was 13-1 in favor of the resolution, but
the veto by the U.S. automatically means that the bill did
not pass.
U.S. ambassador John Scalli called the resolution "an
obstacle to peace." The Egyptian ambassador to the U.N.
charged that the U.S. veto defeats the spirit of the
Security Council's charter.
Los Angeles Smog Crisis Ends
LOS ANGELES — Meterological factors caused a sharp
decrease in smog levels in Los Angeles yesterday, thus
averting a potential health hazard.
Air pollution control officials had predicted that the
maximum ozone levels would rise past .45 parts per
million in much of the San Gabriel Valley. This prediction
caused the environmental protection agency to impose an
emergency smog plan in a six-county area.
Two federal offices, the Internal Revenue Service and

the Social Security Office, closed for the day, and in all,
an estimated 25,000 of 115,000 federal workers stayed
home. Many other workers took buses or rode in car pools
to work.
County supervisor Kenneth Hahn protested the
shutdowns, saying that most of those who took the
one-day vacation probably drove to the beach. According
to Hahn, the practice could mean that "the only people
who will be working will be the people who are paying the
taxes."
Japanese Passengers Leave Libya
TOKYO — The 137 passengers and crewmen of a Japanese
jet hijacked last Friday were scheduled to arrive in Tokyo
today.
Two Japan Air Lines relief jets flew them back from
Libya, where they had been stranded since terrorists
forced the pilot of the plane from Amsterdam to land and
then blew up the Boeing 747 jet.
The three Arab and one Japanese men who hijacked
the plane remain in Libya, where an investigation that
could lead to a trial is underway. It is still not known why
the four hijacked the jet.
A Tel Aviv newspaper reported yesterday that Israeli
security officials warned Japanese authorities that a hijack
attempt would be made several days before the hijacking
actually occurred.
France Delays Nuclear Tests
PARIS — France was reported yesterday as waiting until
atmospheric conditions improve before setting off the
second in its series of nuclear tests in the South Pacific.
Meanwhile, the President of French Polynesia has
decided to deport the five crew members of a yacht which
sailed into the danger zone in protest of the French tests.
The five aboard the protest yacht Fri include an
American skipper, David Moodie, and his wife, a New
Zealand couple, and a French army general who has been
forced into early retirement because of his anti-nuclear
activity.
Nixon-Shah Talks Continue
WASHINGTON — President Nixon continued his
discussions yesterday with the Shah of Iran, who is
visiting the U.S.
The President and the Shah were reported to be
discussing oil production and the security of the Near
East.
The U.S. has been on friendly terms with Iran for some
time, and Nixon and the Shah were reported to be
discussing ways the U.S. could improve relations — and
assure a steady oil supply — from such oil-rich countries as
Southern Yemen and Saudi Arabia.
The Shah was reported to have warned the President
that the Soviet Union still has an interest in taking over
the arta, despite the Soviet government's seemingly
friendly intention.
The Shah believes that the USSR and India are banding
together to encourage rebellions in West Pakistan and
were also involved in bringing about a coup in Afghanistan
last week.
Warm, Fair Weather Continues
Continued fair weather through tomorrow except for
patchy low clouds near the coast nights and mornings.
Low temperatures tonight and tomorrow expected in the
50s, with daytime highs in the upper 70s to low 90s both
days.
