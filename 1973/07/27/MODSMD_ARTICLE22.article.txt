# MANZANITA PARK BLACKED OUT
## 
### 
A transformer failure blacked out power to Manzanita
Park for almost three and a half hours yesterday.
Workers said one of the three transformers in the
12,000-volt generator apparently overheated and
overloaded at the same time, causing the failure.
Electricity in the trailers first faded, then surged as the
transformer popped loudly. The electricity went off at
3:18 p.m.
The transformer apparently sustained no permanent
damage, and was switched on again at 6:43 p.m.
