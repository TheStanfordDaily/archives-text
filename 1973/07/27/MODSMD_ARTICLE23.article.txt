# Drug Panel Okays Changes

The struggle for control of Palo
Alto's $220,000 drug abuse control
program has apparently subsided as
the Palo Alto Community Drug Abuse
Board (PACDAB) voted Wednesday
night to accept "under protest" three
contract amendments ordered by the
city council.
The board vote came in the wake of
a city council ultimatum Monday
night that gave PACDAB a choice
between accepting the changes or
being removed from the program.
Board members voted 14-3 to allow
the contract changes and later 11-6 to
chastise the council for its actions. By
assenting to the changes, the
21-member board will remain in
control of the city's drug abuse
prevention center, its residential
treatment facility and the program
budget.
Pharmacology Prof. Avram
Goldstein, a PACDAB member, stated
he still foresee a "long time of
conflict" between the council and the
board.
"There have been basic
disagreements since the program
began," he said.
He characterized the amendments
as "not seriously damaging" to the
program or its original intent. They
represent a "symbolic political
gesture" asserting ultimate council
control over the board.
The controversial amendments
stemmed from a June 25 council
meeting where council members
resolved that
— staff members of the prevention
and residential treatment centers may
not be appointed to the
self-perpetuating drug abuse board,
— PACDAB must compile a list of
program goals and objectives and
submit these to the council by Oct.

15,
— thr board must comply with an
upcom.ng conflict-of-interest code.
In a statement adopted Wednesday
night, PACDAB reasserted its
autonomy and independence from the
city.
The statement referred to the
amendments as "a clear attack on the
practice and philosophy of the
program."
However, the "central issue" will be
the council's evaluation of PACDAB's
goals and objectives of the program,
Goldstein said.
Commenting on the board's

motivation in accepting the council's
amendments rather than calling for a
final showdown, Goldstein said,
"When somebody else has control of
the purse strings, you sometimes have
to do things you wouldn't normally
do."
Board member Lincoln Mitchell
concurred: "You don't go for the
jugular when you want the
pocketbook."
Goldstein added, "But if there is a
serious conflict over the objectives of
the [drug abuse] program, PACDAB
will terminate" its contract with the
city,.
