# Highest Chemistry Honor
## Flory Receives National Award 
### SCOTT FIELDS 
The American Chemical Society
will be awarding the 1974 Priestley
Medal, the highest honor possible in
American chemistry, to Chemistry
Prof. Paul John Flory. He will accept
the gold medal next April in Los
Angeles.
"I was surprised, and many other
people were astonished," Flory
commented when asked if he expected
the award. "It's the difference
between those two words."
Flory has been involved in the area
of polymer research. "I've been

interested in large molecules for more
years than I like to admit," he
commented. "These are the basic
chemical architecture of a wide variety
of materials."
The chemistry professor does not
believe that the award will have an
effect on his work, except that "I'll
try to do better." He hopes, however,
that this prize will help to advance
research in the area of large molecules.
"Whenever such an award is given,
one likes to think that it gives some
emphasis to the field in which the
award was made," he explained.

Flory plans to remain here until his
mandatory retirement in two years. He
has no definite plans after this, except
for a committment to continue
research, and a desire to teach at
"various other places."
Last fall the scientist took a
sabbatical to teach at the Weitzman
Institute in Israel. This fall another
sabbatical will take him to M.I.T. in
Cambridge, Mass.
Flory was born 63 years ago in
Sterling, Illinois. He obtained a
bachelor of science degree in 1931
from Manchester College, Indiana, and

a doctorate in physical chemistry from
Ohio State University in 1934.
He has been here since 1961, and
was chemistry department chairman
from 1969 until 1971. He has also
done research at DuPont, the
University of Cincinnati, Standard Oil
Esso Laboratory, Goodyear, and
Cornell University.
Although the chemist has been
involved with basic research, he does
believe that his work has had every
day consequences.
"I think it is relevant," he said.
"Tracing the connections between
fundamental ideas and application is
extremely difficult. The better
informed people are, the better
equipped they are to make sound
deductions."
Not all advances in technology have
been beneficial, Flory stated, "but on
a balance they certainly are.
"If you threw out the advantages in
technology of the last 20 years,
millions of people would starve, and
we would have worse pollution
problems."
Flory believes that technology is
"very eager to" solve the problems of
the energy crisis and pollution. "I
think that the recognition of this
problem is going to bring forth much
greater efforts in energy research," he
stated.
As to the future of chemistry, the
award-winner said: "Well, I have a
crystal ball on my desk, but it's no
good for that sort of thing. The future
of any science is what people make of
it."
