# Cox, Committee In Court To Compel Disclosures
## 
### DOYLE McMANUS Special to the Daily 
WASHINGTON — A constitutional
crisis looms here as both the Senate
Watergate Committee and special
Prosecutor Archibald Cox have
initiated court proceedings in attempts
to force President Nixon's release of
White House tapes and written
records.
Cox yesterday asked U.S. District
Court Judge John J. Sirica to order
Nixon to show cause why he will not
honor Cox's subpoena issued Monday.
Sirica gave the White House until Aug.
7 to answer.
Also yesterday, the Senate
Watergate Committee voted
unanimously to bring suit against the
President after he refused to comply
with subpoenas the committee served
Monday.
Committee counsels are expected
to seek a declaratory judgement in
District Court this morning. Hearings,
which Sirica will reportedly assign to
himself, will follow.
After the District Court rulings,
both cases are expected to go to the
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and then
to the Supreme Court.
Motion To Sue
The committee's motion to sue was
made by Sen. Howard Baker Jr.
(R-Tenn.) immediately after the
committee chairman Sen. Sam Ervin
Jr. (D-N.C.) read Nixon's letter
refusing to honor the subpoenas.
The subpoenas ordered the

President to furnish tapes of five
conversations he had with then
Presidential counsel John W. Dean 111,
and all written White House records
pertaining to the Watergate
investigation.
Nixon claimed executive privilege
in refusing to furnish the recordings
but wrote that "all specific requests
from the Select Committee [for

written records] will be carefully
considered."
Not Clairvoyant
"We are not clairvoyant," Ervin
objected. "You can't identify a
document you've never seen."
Meanwhile former Presidential aide
John D. Ehrlichman continued in his
third day of testimony to defend the
Administration's burglary of the office
of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist.
"With a grievous raid on secret
documents like this," Ehrlichman said
of Ellsberg's admitted role in the
release of the Pentagon Papers, "the
President would be very remiss in his
obligations if he didn't move
forward."
The discussion of the Ellsberg
burglary continued the colloquy
Ehrlichman touched off Tuesday when
he asserted that the 1971 break-in was
"well within the President's inherent
powers ... to prevent the betrayal of
national security secrets."
Documents
Documents released by the Senate
committee Tuesday revealed a
concerted effort by the White House
in August, 1971 to discredit Ellsberg.
The project sought, according to
one memo, "to develop a very negative
picture around the whole Pentagon
study affair," and included "covert
operation" at the office of Ellsberg's
psychiatrist — as well as the "planting"
of negative information about Ellsberg
in the press.
Ehrlichman, however, continued
yesterday to maintain that the Ellsberg
burglary was legal, proper and
necessary in the interest of national
security — and that he had never
specifically authorized the action.
Repeated Clashes
In three days of wide-ranging
testimony, Ehrlichman has clashed
repeatedly .with members of the
committee.
"I am here to refute every charge of
illegal conduct on my part," he began
Tuesday.
He has alternated between
aggressive confidence in his own point
of view and pointedly literal
evasiveness under cross-examination.
On Tuesday, Ehrlichman defended
the channeling of about $400,000 in
Nixon campaign funds to the
Watergate break-in defendants.
Comparing the money to legal defense
funds for Ellsberg, Angela Davis and
the Berrigan Brothers, he called the
procedure "a commonplace of
American life."
On Wednesday, Ehrlichman
remained silent for a time as his
attorney, John J. Wilson, and Ervin
engaged in a lengthy and colorful
debate on the President's
constitutional powers to protect
national security.
But he defended his contacts with
the presiding judge of the Pentagon

Papers trial, U.S. District Court Judge
Matt Byrne. Ehrlichman sought out
Byrne while the trial was going on and
he asked if he would consider
becoming director of the FBI.
Yesterday Ehrlichman also said that
the White House "plumbers unit" may
have engaged in wider activities than
are now known, but again stood on
executive privilege and refused to
reveal details to the committee.

pertaining to the Watergate
investigation.
Nixon claimed executive privilege
in refusing to furnish the recordings
but wrote that "all specific requests
from the Select Committee [for

written records] will be carefully
considered."
Not Clairvoyant
"We are not clairvoyant," Ervin
objected. "You can't identify a
document you've never seen."
Meanwhile former Presidential aide
John D. Ehrlichman continued in his
third day of testimony to defend the
Administration's burglary of the office
of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist.
"With a grievous raid on secret
documents like this," Ehrlichman said
of Ellsberg's admitted role in the
release of the Pentagon Papers, "the
President would be very remiss in his
obligations if he didn't move
forward."
The discussion of the Ellsberg
burglary continued the colloquy
Ehrlichman touched off Tuesday when
he asserted that the 1971 break-in was
"well within the President's inherent
powers ... to prevent the betrayal of
national security secrets."
Documents
Documents released by the Senate
committee Tuesday revealed a
concerted effort by the White House
in August, 1971 to discredit Ellsberg.
The project sought, according to
one memo, "to develop a very negative
picture around the whole Pentagon
study affair," and included "covert
operation" at the office of Ellsberg's
psychiatrist — as well as the "planting"
of negative information about Ellsberg
in the press.
Ehrlichman, however, continued
yesterday to maintain that the Ellsberg
burglary was legal, proper and
necessary in the interest of national
security — and that he had never
specifically authorized the action.
Repeated Clashes
In three days of wide-ranging
testimony, Ehrlichman has clashed
repeatedly .with members of the
committee.
"I am here to refute every charge of
illegal conduct on my part," he began
Tuesday.
He has alternated between
aggressive confidence in his own point
of view and pointedly literal
evasiveness under cross-examination.
On Tuesday, Ehrlichman defended
the channeling of about $400,000 in
Nixon campaign funds to the
Watergate break-in defendants.
Comparing the money to legal defense
funds for Ellsberg, Angela Davis and
the Berrigan Brothers, he called the
procedure "a commonplace of
American life."
On Wednesday, Ehrlichman
remained silent for a time as his
attorney, John J. Wilson, and Ervin
engaged in a lengthy and colorful
debate on the President's
constitutional powers to protect
national security.
But he defended his contacts with
the presiding judge of the Pentagon

Papers trial, U.S. District Court Judge
Matt Byrne. Ehrlichman sought out
Byrne while the trial was going on and
he asked if he would consider
becoming director of the FBI.
Yesterday Ehrlichman also said that
the White House "plumbers unit" may
have engaged in wider activities than
are now known, but again stood on
executive privilege and refused to
reveal details to the committee.
WASHINGTON — A constitutional
crisis looms here as both the Senate
Watergate Committee and special
Prosecutor Archibald Cox have
initiated court proceedings in attempts
to force President Nixon's release of
White House tapes and written
records.
Cox yesterday asked U.S. District
Court Judge John J. Sirica to order
Nixon to show cause why he will not
honor Cox's subpoena issued Monday.
Sirica gave the White House until Aug.
7 to answer.
Also yesterday, the Senate
Watergate Committee voted
unanimously to bring suit against the
President after he refused to comply
with subpoenas the committee served
Monday.
Committee counsels are expected
to seek a declaratory judgement in
District Court this morning. Hearings,
which Sirica will reportedly assign to
himself, will follow.
After the District Court rulings,
both cases are expected to go to the
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and then
to the Supreme Court.
Motion To Sue
The committee's motion to sue was
made by Sen. Howard Baker Jr.
(R-Tenn.) immediately after the
committee chairman Sen. Sam Ervin
Jr. (D-N.C.) read Nixon's letter
refusing to honor the subpoenas.
The subpoenas ordered the

President to furnish tapes of five
conversations he had with then
Presidential counsel John W. Dean 111,
and all written White House records
pertaining to the Watergate
investigation.
Nixon claimed executive privilege
in refusing to furnish the recordings
but wrote that "all specific requests
