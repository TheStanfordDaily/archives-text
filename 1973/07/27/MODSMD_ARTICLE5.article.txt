# Profs Say No Constitutional Crisis Growing

### BOB SIEGEL 
Two Stanford Political Science
professors agree that no Constitutional
crisis now exists over President
Nixon's refusal to hand over tapes
subpoenaed by Watergate
investigators.
Both Robert Horn and Hubert
Marshall believe Nixon's willingness to
abide by the eventual Supreme Court
resolution of the matter has removed
the possibility for an unresolveable
conflict between executive and
legislative branches. Both the Senate
Watergate Committee and special
prosecutor Archibald Cox have
subpoenaed the tapes.
Prof. Horn thinks the crisis has
been overblown by the media. He said
"Journalists like to build up sensations
as much as possible."
In addition, Horn indicated his
displeasure with committee chairman
Sam Ervin's "grandstanding" through
the televised hearings and criticized as
"absurd" his comment that Watergate
is the country's greatest constitutional
crisis since the Civil War.
