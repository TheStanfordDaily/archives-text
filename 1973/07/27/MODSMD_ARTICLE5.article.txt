# Profs Say No Constitutional Crisis Growing
## 
### BOB SIEGEL 
Two Stanford Political Science
professors agree that no Constitutional
crisis now exists over President
Nixon's refusal to hand over tapes
subpoenaed by Watergate
investigators.
Both Robert Horn and Hubert
Marshall believe Nixon's willingness to
abide by the eventual Supreme Court
resolution of the matter has removed
the possibility for an unresolveable
conflict between executive and
legislative branches. Both the Senate
Watergate Committee and special
prosecutor Archibald Cox have
subpoenaed the tapes.
Prof. Horn thinks the crisis has
been overblown by the media. He said
"Journalists like to build up sensations
as much as possible."
In addition, Horn indicated his
displeasure with committee chairman
Sam Ervin's "grandstanding" through
the televised hearings and criticized as
"absurd" his comment that Watergate
is the country's greatest constitutional
crisis since the Civil War.
Horn, a professor of constitutional
law, stated that the lack of previous
court cases involving executive
privilege will make adjudication of this
case especially interesting. In the past,
he said, "Congress ~. has blinked in
confrontation with the executive
branch."
Prof. Marshall "guesses" that the
court decision will go in the Ervin
Committee's direction. He bases his
conclusion on the fact that the court is
dealing with "illegal acts ... and not
governmental activity." He declared
"It is not a presidential duty to get
re-elected," and added "the decision
would go the other way if we were
dealing with documents involving his
official acts (such as secret
negotiations with the Russians) as
President."
President Nixon's refusal to supply
prosecutor Cox with the tapes presents
an even more uncertain situation. Prof.
Horn observed "Here is an anomaly of
someone who is technically a
subordinate of the President who is
telling him to do something." He
added "again there is no analagous
situation to look back upon."
