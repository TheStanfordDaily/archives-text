# Second Skylab Shot Set For Tomorrow
## 
### 
The second manned Skylab mission
— with Electrical Engineering Prof.
Owen K. Garriott aboard — will lift off
from Cape Kennedy, Fla. early
tomorrow on its record two-month
odyssey in space.
Garriott, along with fellow
astronauts Alan L. Bean and Jack R.
Lousma, will be shot into space at
7:08 a.m., Eastern Time
(4:08 a.m f , Pacific Daylight Time).
They are not scheduled to return
until Sept. 25, 59 days later.
Garriott, 42, has been in the space
program since 1965. Due to pressures
of the program, his contacts with
Stanford have been limited.
Skylab Rendezvous
Some eight and a half hours after
lift-off, the three astronauts are
scheduled to rendezvous their Apollo
command module with the orbiting
Skylab space station launched earlier
this year.
The first Skylab crew — Charles
Conrad, Joseph Kerwin and Paul Weitz
— stayed aloft for 28 days, the longest
space mission ever. If tomorrow's
mission proceeds on schedule, the
crew will more than double that
record.
The astronauts completed their
training in a mock-up of their Apollo
capsule earlier this week at the
Johnson Manned Space Center in

Houston. They flew to Cape Kennedy
yesterday afternoon.
National Aeronautics and Space
Administration spokesmen predicted
good weather for the Saturday launch.
They said there should be only
scattered clouds and winds from the
south at less than 10 miles per hour.
The Apollo and Skylab crafts will
dock some 270 miles above the earth.
Added Precautions
Dr. Charles A. Berry, director of
NASA's life sciences division, said
there will be extra precautions to
safeguard the astronauts.
Since the mission is scheduled to
run more than twice as long as any
previous one, scientists will pay special
attention to the astronauts' health,
and will periodically review their
physical condition.
NASA crews began pumpting the
150,000 gallons of fuel aboard the
Saturn 13 rocket yesterday. Final
countdown for the launching began
Wednesday.
Bean is the only one of the three
ever to have been in space. He was a
member of the crew of Apollo 12, and
walked on the moon.
The crew wound up its 18 months
training earlier this week by practicing
escape maneuvers in case anything
goes wrong on the launch pad
tomorrow.

member of the crew of Apollo 12, and
walked on the moon.
The crew wound up its 18 months
training earlier this week by practicing
escape maneuvers in case anything
goes wrong on the launch pad
tomorrow.

READY TO GO — Astronauts Alan Bean, right, Owen Garriot, left, and Jack
Lousma will be the crew on the second manned Sky lab mission which is set to
take off early tomorrow morning. They will be in space for nearly two months.
The second manned Skylab mission
— with Electrical Engineering Prof.
Owen K. Garriott aboard — will lift off
from Cape Kennedy, Fla. early
tomorrow on its record two-month
odyssey in space.
Garriott, along with fellow
astronauts Alan L. Bean and Jack R.
Lousma, will be shot into space at
7:08 a.m., Eastern Time
(4:08 a.m f , Pacific Daylight Time).
They are not scheduled to return
until Sept. 25, 59 days later.
Garriott, 42, has been in the space
program since 1965. Due to pressures
of the program, his contacts with
Stanford have been limited.
Skylab Rendezvous
Some eight and a half hours after
lift-off, the three astronauts are
scheduled to rendezvous their Apollo
command module with the orbiting
Skylab space station launched earlier
this year.
The first Skylab crew — Charles
Conrad, Joseph Kerwin and Paul Weitz
— stayed aloft for 28 days, the longest
space mission ever. If tomorrow's
mission proceeds on schedule, the
crew will more than double that
record.
The astronauts completed their
training in a mock-up of their Apollo
capsule earlier this week at the
Johnson Manned Space Center in

Houston. They flew to Cape Kennedy
yesterday afternoon.
National Aeronautics and Space
Administration spokesmen predicted
good weather for the Saturday launch.
They said there should be only
scattered clouds and winds from the
south at less than 10 miles per hour.
The Apollo and Skylab crafts will
dock some 270 miles above the earth.
Added Precautions
Dr. Charles A. Berry, director of
NASA's life sciences division, said
there will be extra precautions to
safeguard the astronauts.
Since the mission is scheduled to
run more than twice as long as any
previous one, scientists will pay special
attention to the astronauts' health,
and will periodically review their
physical condition.
NASA crews began pumpting the
150,000 gallons of fuel aboard the
Saturn 13 rocket yesterday. Final
countdown for the launching began
Wednesday.
Bean is the only one of the three
ever to have been in space. He was a
member of the crew of Apollo 12, and
walked on the moon.
