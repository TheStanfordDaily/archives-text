Americans Arise
Editor:
Honorable Americans, the deep
soul of this Nation bor thru great
struggle and desire for Freedom,
then rocked by the courage and
conviction of our Forefathers is
now threatened as never before.
Criminals in the political arena
sicken the spirit while
discrimination, poverty, crime,
waste, oppression and war suck
dry the dream of hope for
America, to be the heart of Truth,
the hand of Courage, and the land
of Freedom.
The Government for the
People must unite to stem the tide
of mistrust instigated by a paltry
few and dam the torrent of grave
social concerns flooding our land.
The memory of Lincoln, Lee,
Jackson, Armstrong, Wright,
Washington, King, Kennedy and
others will be rekindled as leaders
rise anew to such a cause.
A Bell of Principle born of
such a spirit and tolled by

Government by the hour will
swing the momentum. The mighty
American Voice, cheering from
every hamlet at the tidings, will
ring in harmony from pole to
pole, proclaiming new hope for a
troubled and turbulent world.
Proud America shower a fresh
wave of courage and commitment
to flower Freedom from valley to
mountain peak. Now is the
moment for America to be rather
than dream to be the flame of
Freedom in the heart of men to
come. Rise Americans for as
Liberty stands so shall we all.

C.E. Persons, and my Alma Mater,

Psychosurgery Hearing
Editor:
After reading Bill Evers' article,
"Psychosurgery and Civil
Liberties" in Tuesday's (July 24,

1973) Daily, I thought it should
be pointed out that over the past
several months a struggle has been
waged against an impending
program in California's Prisons
and mental institutions for
experimentation with
psychosurgery.
Those pushing for the program,
set up under the guise of a
research center at UCLA called
the "Center for the Reduction of
Violent Behavior" were defeated
in their push to obtain funding
through the state legislature.
This defeat came about
through the efforts of many
groups and individuals who
expressed their opposition
through press conferences, letters

to legislators and mass attendance
at the hearings held recently in
Sacramento.
Now, the proponents of this
program are seeking funds
through the California Council on
Criminal Justice (CCCJ). The
CCCJ will be discussing the
proposed center at their meeting
today, Friday, July 27, 1973.
The meeting, which is open to
the public, is to be held at 9:30
a.m. at the Hyatt House in
Burlingame (1333 W. Bayshore
Hwy.) Dr. Philip Shapiro of the
Medical Committee for Human
Rights and psychologist Lee
Coleman will be testifying against
the proposed violence center and
psychosurgery program.
The subject of psychosurgery is
not expected to come up on the
agenda of the CCCJ until 10:30
a.m. All interested people are
urged to attend to express their
opposition or find out more about
the center.

Americans Arise
Editor:
Honorable Americans, the deep
soul of this Nation bor thru great
struggle and desire for Freedom,
then rocked by the courage and
conviction of our Forefathers is
now threatened as never before.
Criminals in the political arena
sicken the spirit while
discrimination, poverty, crime,
waste, oppression and war suck
dry the dream of hope for
America, to be the heart of Truth,
the hand of Courage, and the land
of Freedom.
The Government for the
People must unite to stem the tide
of mistrust instigated by a paltry
few and dam the torrent of grave
social concerns flooding our land.
The memory of Lincoln, Lee,
Jackson, Armstrong, Wright,
Washington, King, Kennedy and
others will be rekindled as leaders
rise anew to such a cause.
A Bell of Principle born of
such a spirit and tolled by

Government by the hour will
swing the momentum. The mighty
American Voice, cheering from
every hamlet at the tidings, will
ring in harmony from pole to
pole, proclaiming new hope for a
troubled and turbulent world.
Proud America shower a fresh
wave of courage and commitment
to flower Freedom from valley to
mountain peak. Now is the
moment for America to be rather
than dream to be the flame of
Freedom in the heart of men to
come. Rise Americans for as
Liberty stands so shall we all.
Respectfully submited in
honor of my late grandfather, Mr.
C.E. Persons, and my Alma Mater,

Psychosurgery Hearing
Editor:
After reading Bill Evers' article,
"Psychosurgery and Civil
Liberties" in Tuesday's (July 24,

1973) Daily, I thought it should
be pointed out that over the past
several months a struggle has been
waged against an impending
program in California's Prisons
and mental institutions for
experimentation with
psychosurgery.
Those pushing for the program,
set up under the guise of a
research center at UCLA called
the "Center for the Reduction of
Violent Behavior" were defeated
in their push to obtain funding
through the state legislature.
This defeat came about
through the efforts of many
groups and individuals who
expressed their opposition
through press conferences, letters

to legislators and mass attendance
at the hearings held recently in
Sacramento.
Now, the proponents of this
program are seeking funds
through the California Council on
Criminal Justice (CCCJ). The
CCCJ will be discussing the
proposed center at their meeting
today, Friday, July 27, 1973.
The meeting, which is open to
the public, is to be held at 9:30
a.m. at the Hyatt House in
Burlingame (1333 W. Bayshore
Hwy.) Dr. Philip Shapiro of the
Medical Committee for Human
