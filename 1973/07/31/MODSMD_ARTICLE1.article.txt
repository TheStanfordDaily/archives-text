# Haldeman Claims Tapes Clear Nixon
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — Former Presidential
chief of staff H.R. Haldeman revealed
to the Senate Watergate Committee
yesterday that he has listened to tapes
of two crucial meetings President
Nixon had with John W. Dean 111, and
that the tapes exonerate the President.
Haldeman said he listened to the
tapes of meetings Nixon had with the
former White House counsel on Sept.
15, 1972 and March 21, 1973 -
meetings which are fundamental to
Dean's contention that Nixon was
aware of the Watergate scandal
cover-up.
Haldeman said he listened to one of
the tapes in April, 1973, and to the
other this month. His statement
touched off an immediate furor, since
he was a private citizen when he was
allowed to listen to the tapes.
Tapes Withheld
The White House has withheld the
tapes from the investigative committee
headed by Sen. Sam J. Ervin (D-N.C.)
Jr. on the grounds of executive
privilege. However, Haldeman himself
was apparently outside the executive
branch when he listened to at least one
of the tapes.
Ervin called it "a strange thing"
that Haldeman was allowed to listen to
the tapes when the committee could
not.
Haldeman said the two tapes
disproved Dean's assertions. At the
Sept. 15 meeting, Dean had testified
that Nixon congratulated him on the
success of the cover-up, and discussed
ways of delaying a civil suit filed
against the Committee to Re-elect the
President (CRP).
However, Haldeman said Dean was
congratulated not for his handling of
the cover-up but for his role in the
investigation.
Letter From Nixon
Haldeman carried with him a letter
from Nixon authorizing him to tell the
committee the contents of the tape.
However, he was instructed to invoke
executive privilege to cover any
conversations on the tapes he did not
personally participate in.

Haldeman also denied his own
involvement in either the planning or
cover-up of the Watergate break-in,
and disputed testimony of his former
assistant, Gordon Strachan, who said
Haldeman received information on
political intelligence.
Former domestic affairs adviser
John D. Ehrlichman ended his five
days of testimony earlier in the day
with what may have been the most
bitter exchange in the 10 weeks of
hearings so far.
'Clearly Illegal'
Committee counsel Sam Dash and
Ehrlichman clashed over whether
either Haldeman or the President had
been told that the 1971 break-in at
Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office
was "clearly illegal and
unconstitutional."
Ervin had to gavel twice for order
in the hearing room when the two
exchanged heated words after Dash
asked the question several times.
Sen. Howard Baker Jr. (R-Tenn.),
ranking GOP member on the
committee, noted that "I think what
we're going through right now is
evidence that this committee is in fact
tired."
Complete Reports
Ehrlichman testified that the
President asked for complete reports
eight times on the Watergate affair —
but never got one he was happy with.
Under questioning by Sen. Daniel
Inouye (D-Hawaii), Ehrlichman said
requests were made to himself several
times, to Dean, to CRP Director Clark
MacGregor, to GOP National
Chairman George Bush, and at a
meeting with Dean, former
U.S. Atty. Gen. John Mitchell and
Haldeman.
The committee today also
scheduled six more witnesses to follow
Haldeman before the summer recess,
including former Atty. Gen. Richard
Kleindienst, former CIA Director
Richard Helms, Asst. Atty. Gen.
Henry Petersen and former FBI acting
director L. Patrick Gray 111.

Former domestic affairs adviser
John D. Ehrlichman ended his five
days of testimony earlier in the day
with what may have been the most
bitter exchange in the 10 weeks of
hearings so far.
'Clearly Illegal'
Committee counsel Sam Dash and
Ehrlichman clashed over whether
either Haldeman or the President had
been told that the 1971 break-in at
Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office
was "clearly illegal and
unconstitutional."
Ervin had to gavel twice for order
in the hearing room when the two
exchanged heated words after Dash
asked the question several times.
Sen. Howard Baker Jr. (R-Tenn.),
ranking GOP member on the
committee, noted that "I think what
we're going through right now is
evidence that this committee is in fact
tired."
Complete Reports
Ehrlichman testified that the
President asked for complete reports
eight times on the Watergate affair —
but never got one he was happy with.
Under questioning by Sen. Daniel
Inouye (D-Hawaii), Ehrlichman said
requests were made to himself several
times, to Dean, to CRP Director Clark
MacGregor, to GOP National
Chairman George Bush, and at a
meeting with Dean, former
U.S. Atty. Gen. John Mitchell and
Haldeman.
The committee today also
scheduled six more witnesses to follow
Haldeman before the summer recess,
including former Atty. Gen. Richard
Kleindienst, former CIA Director
Richard Helms, Asst. Atty. Gen.
Henry Petersen and former FBI acting
director L. Patrick Gray 111.
WASHINGTON — Former Presidential
chief of staff H.R. Haldeman revealed
to the Senate Watergate Committee
yesterday that he has listened to tapes
of two crucial meetings President
Nixon had with John W. Dean 111, and
that the tapes exonerate the President.
Haldeman said he listened to the
tapes of meetings Nixon had with the
former White House counsel on Sept.
15, 1972 and March 21, 1973 -
meetings which are fundamental to
Dean's contention that Nixon was
aware of the Watergate scandal
cover-up.
Haldeman said he listened to one of
the tapes in April, 1973, and to the
other this month. His statement
touched off an immediate furor, since
he was a private citizen when he was
allowed to listen to the tapes.
Tapes Withheld
The White House has withheld the
tapes from the investigative committee
headed by Sen. Sam J. Ervin (D-N.C.)
Jr. on the grounds of executive
privilege. However, Haldeman himself
was apparently outside the executive
branch when he listened to at least one
of the tapes.
Ervin called it "a strange thing"
that Haldeman was allowed to listen to
the tapes when the committee could
not.
Haldeman said the two tapes
disproved Dean's assertions. At the
Sept. 15 meeting, Dean had testified
that Nixon congratulated him on the
success of the cover-up, and discussed
ways of delaying a civil suit filed
against the Committee to Re-elect the
President (CRP).
However, Haldeman said Dean was
congratulated not for his handling of
the cover-up but for his role in the
investigation.
Letter From Nixon
Haldeman carried with him a letter
from Nixon authorizing him to tell the
committee the contents of the tape.
However, he was instructed to invoke
executive privilege to cover any
conversations on the tapes he did not
personally participate in.

Haldeman also denied his own
involvement in either the planning or
cover-up of the Watergate break-in,
and disputed testimony of his former
assistant, Gordon Strachan, who said
Haldeman received information on
political intelligence.
