# Mayer Brothers Capture Titles In Munich, Western Net Tourneys
## 
### 
Brothers Sandy and Gene Mayer of
Wayne, N.J., both of whom are
expected to play tennis for Stanford
next season, won impressive
tournament victories this weekend.
Sandy Mayer won the men's singles
title at the Bavarian Open Tennis
Championships in Munich Sunday by
defeating Harald Elschenbroich of
West Germany 6-4, 6-3, 6-3.
The victory in the $17,550
tournament continued a series of
successes during Mayer's European
tour, which was highlighted when the
21-year-old senior reached the
semifinals at Wimbledon.
Mayer also teamed with Rick Fisher
of Palo Alto, a June graduate of
Stanford, to finish second in the
Bavarian Open doubles tournament.
The pair reached the finals before
bowing to Elschenbroich and

Hans-Juergen Pohman 7-5, 7-5.
Meanwhile, at the Western Open
Junior Tennis Championships at
Springfield, Ohio, Gene Mayer teamed
with Tom Kreiss of Los Angeles to win
the doubles championship.
The younger Mayer, who will enter
Stanford this fall, and Kreiss, younger
brother of two UCLA star tennis
players, defeated Nick Saviano and
Peter Fleming 7-5, 6-3.
Saviano, from Los Altos Hills, will
also be entering Stanford this fall. He
and Gene Mayer have received the
only two scholarships Stanford
annually gives in tennis.
The Western Open singles title was
won by Billy Martin of Palos Verdes,
Cal., who beat Mayer in the round of
16, 6-4, 6-4, and Saviano in the
semifinals 3-6, 6-1, 6-2.
