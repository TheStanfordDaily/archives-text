### 
Chicago: "Chicago VI"
(Columbia KC32400)
Chicago, by its very name and
the nature of the group's
formation, promises to deliver
tremendous editorial statements
in its songs. Always, there is a
message.
This new album is in keeping
with such a style. But what the
new album fails to do is produce
music to accompany the message.
We liked "Beginnings," "Does
Anybody Really Know What
Time It Is?" "Make Me Smile,"
"Saturday In The Park" and even
"Dialogue" because they were
pleasant to listen to — they had a
good beat and a profound
statement to make.
But the new album sounds as
though it comes direct from the
jungle, with the actual music more
reminiscent of the horrible "Free
Form Guitar" from the "Chicago
Transit Authority" album.
"Feelin' Stronger Every Day,"
the hit single from the album,
along with "Hollywood" and
"Something In This City Changes
People" have promise, although
they lack any kind of catchy
melody.
However, they do have a
melody. The rest of the music
consists of banging drums and
blowing horns wildly in every
direction just to accompany the
sermons they were written for.
"What's This World Comin'
To" sounds like Chicago doing a
parody on Chicago. And that is
the problem with most of the
tunes on Chicago VI.
The songs fit into three basic
categories: Love, show business
and general philosophy. The show
business songs like "Critics'
Choice" have very gutsy thoughts
behind them, but no music.
The love songs run the gamut
from awful, a classification
including "Jenny" (Comedian
George Carl in does a routine
satirizing rock music, singing a

song by the same name and it is
even better music) to excellent.
Our favorite song is "In Terms of
Two," which interestingly enough
consists of harmonica and guitar
minus the horns — maybe that's
why it sounds so great compared
to everything else — because it's
unique.
Chicago hasn't totally failed on
the album — it isn't god-awful —
but don't expect to hear the types
of songs they've produced in the
past.
This album definitely takes
some getting used to because it
does emphasize lyrics over
rhythmic quality. Perhaps this is
the new direction that Chicago is
taking. If so, album seven should
tell.

Jim Croce: "Life And Times"
(ABC x-769)
Jim Croce conveys the
appearance of a harsh, cigar
smoking man who's seen hard
times in the South. You're
supposed to look at his face and
know where he's been.
It surprises people to learn that
he's really a mild-mannered folk
singer from San Diego, California.
But Croce is a showman and his
tunes are down to earth. He
speaks to (not just at) the people.
This album even sounds as
though much of it were recorded
in a beer hall complete with hand
clapping and coyote-type yelping.
But all these factors combined
give Croce's music an aura of
authenticity and they make us
want to learn more about this
mysterious yet colorful man. We
never really do but, in the process
of our curiosity unfolding itself,
we are definitely entertained.
Croce is noted for one kind of
song — the Jed Clampett-type
ballad about strange country
folks. Here, he provides us with a
number of such sagas: "Roller
Derby Queen," — "the meanest

hunk o' woman that anybody ever
seen," "Speedball Tucker" —
"terror of the highway," and, of
course, the famous "Bad, Bad
Leroy Brown" — "meaner than a
junk-yard dog."
But this is not the only type of
music Croce writes. Although at
times sounding much like a
warped Bobby Goldsboro record,
he can sing some soft ballads well.
"Next Time, This Time" and
"These Dreams," an almost
medieval-sounding love song
complete with violins, are
extremely pleasing to the ears.
If Croce has contributed
anything to music in this alubm,
he has made us return to a time
when words were meant to be
understood. His lyrics are the
reason for the success of his songs.
True, Maury Meulleisen, his
accompanying accoustic guitarist,

contributes a lot (particularly on
numbers like "One Less Set Of
Footsteps"), and the melodies are
great toe-tappers, but Jim Croce's
words are classic swamp jargon —
he calls 'em like he sees 'em and
doesn't pull any punches.
The lyrics alone make the
album not only worth listening to
but worth owning.

Rod Stewart: "Sing It Again,
Rod" (Mercury SRM 680)
This album could be
retitled "The Best Of Rod
Stewart," if such a thing is
possible.
It contains 51 minutes of
music, including, complete and
uncut, most of the songs that have
made Rod famous over the years:
"Reason To Believe," "You Wear

It Well," "Maggie May,"
"Handbags And Gladrags," "I
Know I'm Losing You" and for
the first time on any Rod Stewart
album, his version of "Pinball
Wizard" from the rock-opera
"Tommy."
On the cover. Rod thanks
various people for "putting up
with me and my stupid idlings
over the past three or four years."
Ins'de, he still sounds like Rod
McKuen with a cold or, as one
reviewer put it, a "frog in heat."
But the album is a must
for any Rod Stewart fan. If you're
like this reviewer and like only a
few of his songs and they happen
to be on different albums and
you're too cheap to buy so many
records — now, your problem is
solved.

SERVING TWO MASTERS?—DougIas Broyles as Florindo and
Penelope Miller as Beatrice profess their love for one another in Carlo
Goldoni's comedy "The Servant of Two Masters." The drama
department will present the commedia dell-arte August 2-4 and 8-11
at 8 p.m. nightly at the Nitery. Tickets go on sale for $1 in the lobby
at 7:30 p.m. each evening. The production is directed by Kurtwood
Smith and stars experienced Bay Area actors seen earlier this summer
at Stanford in "The Hostage" and"The Rehearsal."
Chicago: "Chicago VI"
(Columbia KC32400)
Chicago, by its very name and
the nature of the group's
formation, promises to deliver
tremendous editorial statements
in its songs. Always, there is a
message.
This new album is in keeping
with such a style. But what the
new album fails to do is produce
music to accompany the message.
We liked "Beginnings," "Does
Anybody Really Know What
Time It Is?" "Make Me Smile,"
"Saturday In The Park" and even
"Dialogue" because they were
pleasant to listen to — they had a
good beat and a profound
statement to make.
But the new album sounds as
though it comes direct from the
jungle, with the actual music more
reminiscent of the horrible "Free
Form Guitar" from the "Chicago
Transit Authority" album.
"Feelin' Stronger Every Day,"
the hit single from the album,
along with "Hollywood" and
"Something In This City Changes
People" have promise, although
they lack any kind of catchy
melody.
However, they do have a
melody. The rest of the music
consists of banging drums and
blowing horns wildly in every
direction just to accompany the
sermons they were written for.
"What's This World Comin'
To" sounds like Chicago doing a
parody on Chicago. And that is
the problem with most of the
tunes on Chicago VI.
The songs fit into three basic
categories: Love, show business
and general philosophy. The show
business songs like "Critics'
Choice" have very gutsy thoughts
behind them, but no music.
The love songs run the gamut
from awful, a classification
including "Jenny" (Comedian
George Carl in does a routine
satirizing rock music, singing a

song by the same name and it is
even better music) to excellent.
Our favorite song is "In Terms of
Two," which interestingly enough
consists of harmonica and guitar
minus the horns — maybe that's
why it sounds so great compared
to everything else — because it's
unique.
Chicago hasn't totally failed on
the album — it isn't god-awful —
but don't expect to hear the types
of songs they've produced in the
past.
This album definitely takes
some getting used to because it
does emphasize lyrics over
rhythmic quality. Perhaps this is
the new direction that Chicago is
taking. If so, album seven should
tell.

Jim Croce: "Life And Times"
(ABC x-769)
Jim Croce conveys the
appearance of a harsh, cigar
smoking man who's seen hard
times in the South. You're
supposed to look at his face and
know where he's been.
It surprises people to learn that
he's really a mild-mannered folk
singer from San Diego, California.
But Croce is a showman and his
tunes are down to earth. He
speaks to (not just at) the people.
This album even sounds as
though much of it were recorded
in a beer hall complete with hand
clapping and coyote-type yelping.
But all these factors combined
give Croce's music an aura of
authenticity and they make us
want to learn more about this
mysterious yet colorful man. We
never really do but, in the process
of our curiosity unfolding itself,
we are definitely entertained.
Croce is noted for one kind of
song — the Jed Clampett-type
ballad about strange country
folks. Here, he provides us with a
number of such sagas: "Roller
Derby Queen," — "the meanest

hunk o' woman that anybody ever
seen," "Speedball Tucker" —
"terror of the highway," and, of
course, the famous "Bad, Bad
Leroy Brown" — "meaner than a
junk-yard dog."
But this is not the only type of
music Croce writes. Although at
times sounding much like a
warped Bobby Goldsboro record,
he can sing some soft ballads well.
"Next Time, This Time" and
"These Dreams," an almost
medieval-sounding love song
complete with violins, are
extremely pleasing to the ears.
If Croce has contributed
anything to music in this alubm,
he has made us return to a time
when words were meant to be
understood. His lyrics are the
reason for the success of his songs.
True, Maury Meulleisen, his
accompanying accoustic guitarist,

contributes a lot (particularly on
numbers like "One Less Set Of
Footsteps"), and the melodies are
great toe-tappers, but Jim Croce's
words are classic swamp jargon —
he calls 'em like he sees 'em and
doesn't pull any punches.
The lyrics alone make the
album not only worth listening to
but worth owning.

Rod Stewart: "Sing It Again,
Rod" (Mercury SRM 680)
This album could be
retitled "The Best Of Rod
Stewart," if such a thing is
possible.
It contains 51 minutes of
music, including, complete and
uncut, most of the songs that have
made Rod famous over the years:
"Reason To Believe," "You Wear

It Well," "Maggie May,"
"Handbags And Gladrags," "I
Know I'm Losing You" and for
the first time on any Rod Stewart
album, his version of "Pinball
Wizard" from the rock-opera
"Tommy."
On the cover. Rod thanks

Rod Stewart: "Sing It Again,
Rod" (Mercury SRM 680)
This album could be
retitled "The Best Of Rod
Stewart," if such a thing is
possible.
It contains 51 minutes of
music, including, complete and
uncut, most of the songs that have
made Rod famous over the years:
"Reason To Believe," "You Wear

It Well," "Maggie May,"
"Handbags And Gladrags," "I
Know I'm Losing You" and for
the first time on any Rod Stewart
album, his version of "Pinball
Wizard" from the rock-opera
"Tommy."
On the cover. Rod thanks
various people for "putting up
with me and my stupid idlings
over the past three or four years."
Ins'de, he still sounds like Rod
McKuen with a cold or, as one
reviewer put it, a "frog in heat."
But the album is a must
for any Rod Stewart fan. If you're
like this reviewer and like only a
few of his songs and they happen
to be on different albums and
you're too cheap to buy so many
records — now, your problem is
solved.

SERVING TWO MASTERS?—DougIas Broyles as Florindo and
Penelope Miller as Beatrice profess their love for one another in Carlo
Goldoni's comedy "The Servant of Two Masters." The drama
department will present the commedia dell-arte August 2-4 and 8-11
at 8 p.m. nightly at the Nitery. Tickets go on sale for $1 in the lobby
at 7:30 p.m. each evening. The production is directed by Kurtwood
Smith and stars experienced Bay Area actors seen earlier this summer
at Stanford in "The Hostage" and"The Rehearsal."
Chicago: "Chicago VI"
(Columbia KC32400)
Chicago, by its very name and
the nature of the group's
formation, promises to deliver
tremendous editorial statements
in its songs. Always, there is a
message.
This new album is in keeping
with such a style. But what the
new album fails to do is produce
music to accompany the message.
We liked "Beginnings," "Does
Anybody Really Know What
Time It Is?" "Make Me Smile,"
"Saturday In The Park" and even
"Dialogue" because they were
pleasant to listen to — they had a
good beat and a profound
statement to make.
But the new album sounds as
though it comes direct from the
jungle, with the actual music more
reminiscent of the horrible "Free
Form Guitar" from the "Chicago
Transit Authority" album.
"Feelin' Stronger Every Day,"
the hit single from the album,
along with "Hollywood" and
"Something In This City Changes
People" have promise, although
they lack any kind of catchy
melody.
However, they do have a
melody. The rest of the music
consists of banging drums and
blowing horns wildly in every
direction just to accompany the
sermons they were written for.
"What's This World Comin'
To" sounds like Chicago doing a
parody on Chicago. And that is
the problem with most of the
tunes on Chicago VI.
The songs fit into three basic
categories: Love, show business
and general philosophy. The show
business songs like "Critics'
Choice" have very gutsy thoughts
behind them, but no music.
The love songs run the gamut
from awful, a classification
including "Jenny" (Comedian
George Carl in does a routine
satirizing rock music, singing a

song by the same name and it is
even better music) to excellent.
Our favorite song is "In Terms of
Two," which interestingly enough
consists of harmonica and guitar
minus the horns — maybe that's
why it sounds so great compared
to everything else — because it's
unique.
Chicago hasn't totally failed on
the album — it isn't god-awful —
but don't expect to hear the types
of songs they've produced in the
past.
This album definitely takes
some getting used to because it
does emphasize lyrics over
rhythmic quality. Perhaps this is
the new direction that Chicago is
taking. If so, album seven should
tell.

Jim Croce: "Life And Times"
(ABC x-769)
Jim Croce conveys the
appearance of a harsh, cigar
smoking man who's seen hard
times in the South. You're
supposed to look at his face and
know where he's been.
It surprises people to learn that
he's really a mild-mannered folk
singer from San Diego, California.
But Croce is a showman and his
tunes are down to earth. He
speaks to (not just at) the people.
This album even sounds as
though much of it were recorded
in a beer hall complete with hand
clapping and coyote-type yelping.
But all these factors combined
give Croce's music an aura of
authenticity and they make us
want to learn more about this
mysterious yet colorful man. We
never really do but, in the process
of our curiosity unfolding itself,
we are definitely entertained.
Croce is noted for one kind of
song — the Jed Clampett-type
ballad about strange country
folks. Here, he provides us with a
number of such sagas: "Roller
Derby Queen," — "the meanest

hunk o' woman that anybody ever
seen," "Speedball Tucker" —
"terror of the highway," and, of
course, the famous "Bad, Bad
Leroy Brown" — "meaner than a
junk-yard dog."
But this is not the only type of
music Croce writes. Although at
times sounding much like a
warped Bobby Goldsboro record,
he can sing some soft ballads well.
"Next Time, This Time" and
"These Dreams," an almost
medieval-sounding love song
complete with violins, are
extremely pleasing to the ears.
If Croce has contributed
anything to music in this alubm,
he has made us return to a time
when words were meant to be
understood. His lyrics are the
reason for the success of his songs.
True, Maury Meulleisen, his
accompanying accoustic guitarist,

contributes a lot (particularly on
numbers like "One Less Set Of
Footsteps"), and the melodies are
great toe-tappers, but Jim Croce's
