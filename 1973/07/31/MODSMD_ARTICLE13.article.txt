# Festival Cinema Films Explore Death Culture
## 
### JON R. KENNEDY 
Palo Alto's new Festival
Cinema uses an idea which is
working successfully in many
other cultural centers around the
country and can hopefully make a
go of it here as well: bringing back
a steady supply of outstanding
films of earlier eras.
Students, film buffs and critics
can profit greatly from such a link
to the history of cinema, whether
the interst is filmmaking
technique, an actor's progress, or
comparative production values.
And the general audience finds
that films of proven merit have a
better chance of providing a
satisfying night out than those
being hyped as someone's latest
commercial venture.
Recently, for example, the
Festival has given us a fresh look
at Michelangelo Antonioni's
Blowup (England, 1967), and The
Loved One (U.S., 1965).

Though the former is a highly
serious drama and the latter an
often-delightful comedy, they
belong together because both are
interpretations of urban
decadence on the lighter level and,
more profoundly, the
contemplation of death.
I had missed The Loved One
on its regular rounds, and was
pleased to find the film a faithful
adaptation of Evelyn Waugh's
incisive satirical novel. The satire
is not about the fact of death but
the American — and particularly
Southern Californian — funeral
business: the tourist-attraction
cemeteries, choice of wetness
moisture- or dampness-proof
coffins, euphemisms to avoid the
subject (the dead are "loved
ones," burial is "out-going," death
itself is "leave-taking") and pet
cemeteries.
Beyond that, the film satirizes
both Hollywood and Los Angeles

in a highly humorous but not
objectionable way, and tosses off
a few laughs about all the poetry
that tries to make death romantic
or appealing.
British Pop Culture
Blowup, according to program
notes issued by Festival manager
Larry Rockwell, was resented by
some critics for inaccurately
interpreting British culture of the
mid-'6os, but it probably
interprets the popular philosophy
of the times better than any other
single piece of work.
It is a cinema version of the
Beatles' "Eleanor Rigby" and
"The Fool on the Hill."
Like "Eleanor" it suggests that
death is incomprehensible,
therefore its very existence should
be doubted. Like "The Fool" it
resolves the tension death creates
by playing games with it. This was
also the statement of Fellini's
later film, The Clowns.

Antonioni went to London to
make the film because he felt that
London, more than Amsterdam,
New York, or San Francisco, had
produced the drug culture with all
its death-mocking manifestations.
His camera pans various
cityscapes and his story gets inside
various subcultures to produce the
conclusion that a culture is a
unity, each facet of it producing
certain by-products, all of which,
like death, are determined,
programmed, or inevitable.
The story tells of a young
fashion photographer whose only
confrontations with death have
been very superficial, like the
animations of a mime troupe.
Confrontation with Death
While doing the thing that
means life itself to him — making
pictures — he confronts death in a
most unexpected place: in one of
his own pictures. A blowup of an
obscure but curious object in a
park scene reveals a hand pointing
a gun. Another looks like what
could .be the body of a person
gunned down.
At night, utterly alone, he
returns to the scene and finds the
body still lying beneath a bush.
He is gripped and fascinated by
this incomprehensible "thing,"
and attempts to tell others, but
they find it even less believable.
He loses two chances to verify his
discovery: first a rock music
nightclub comes between him and
his proof, and then a pot party
where everyone is too stoned to
believe in death intervenes.

The next day's brightness is
too stark and too alive to sustain
belief in death. He returns to the
bush in the park, but the body is
gone, so he gives up his quest.
On the way back to his car he
meets a mime troupe playing
tennis, in mime, of course. Their
belief in their invisible racquets
and tennis ball pulls him in. A
serve is too high, the "ball" goes
over the fence at his corner. The
players look to him to recover
their ball.
Does he believe in the ball or
not? Everyone else there does. He
conforms, walking out in the grass
to where the "ball" has bounced
— picks it up, and throws it back
over the fence.
Existential Lifestyle
Yesterday he had been the
only believer in death. Today he
would not be the only unbeliever.
The film bares an enigma
within existentialist
philosophy-lifestyle. As the
Apostle Paul described it in the
first century A.D., it holds death
as the one absolute. If death is
absolute, Paul said, we should eat,
drink, and be merry.
That's what urban pop culture
— rock clubs, pot parties, and free
swinging sexual mores — is all
about, Antonioni replies. We eat,
drink, and make merry for
tomorrow we die.
But today, while we live, we
don't think about death, we don't
mention its name, we don't
become involved — that's the
enigma.
