# Confusion Reigns In An Irish Brothel
## 
### SUSAN SWIRE 
The drama department has
succeeded in pulling together an
almost impossibly frenetic play in
five short weeks.
The Hostage, a tragi-comedy
by Irishman Brendan Behan, was
presented July 25-29 in the Little
Theater, under the direction of
Robert Mooney of the American
Conservatory Theater.
A sleazy flophouse in Dublin, „
1960, is the claustrophobic setting
for 16 characters caught in the
midst of the age-old Irish troubles.
And in the constant battle
between political idealism and
personal degenceracy nobody
comes out clean.
"Jesus lives! But he doesn't live
here," tells you everything you
have to know about the politics
and the bawdy-house residents.
Three prostitutes, a gay queen,
a "sociable" worker and an
anachronistic English ex-patriot
are among the motley household
under the management of an
ex-hero and his "nearly" wife.
Along with customers and
consorts, everyone gathers around
the bar to sing, to bicker and to
flaunt.
Patriotism and Tragedy
What happens when a young
English military hostage awaiting
his death sentence is billeted
among them? Nobody is able to
decide.
Strong feelings of patriotism
play ping-pong with the
free-for-all instinct to let the boy
escape, until his tragic death
affirms the irresolvability of the
situation in Ireland today.
But the play could take place
anywhere. The troubles in Ireland
only give structure to what a
production staffer termed "the
asshole of life."
Satirical Grab-Bag
The drama department calls
The Hostage a "grab-bag musical
comedy." And on one level it is.
Dry humor and satirical asides jab
at both Catholics and Protestants,
political involvement and
non-involvement, homosexuality,
prostitution and love, all
interlaced with flamboyant
drinking, singing, dancing and sex.
The fun and games are superb
entertainment, but they seem to
overshadow, or at least confuse,
the political message. After all, an
evening that begins with a
music-hall jig and ends with an
embarrassing death does leave you
wondering.
But the message is confusion —
"There's nowhere on earth like
the world," as the theme-song
goes.
Believable Performance
Charles Hallahan as Pat, the
house manager, and part-time
narrator, holds the play together
with an unbelievably believable
performance. His dimpled,
tousled, warm being holds the

fantastic happenings in the
context of reality.
William Moreing as Monsewer,
the oblivious, kilted English
anachronism who seems to live in
the W.C., is also excellent.
Doris Settle, who you may
remember as Elaine in The
Rehearsal, is delightful here as
Miss Gilchrist, the sociable
worker. The innocent Salvation
Army missionary comes into the
flophouse to save souls, but as the
object of everyone's resentment
she nearly loses her own.
There is no doubt that the play
is entertaining through all three
one-hour acts. Entertaining and
exhausting.
The multitude of characters on
the set, contemporaneous scenes
of action, the roar of the flushing
toilet, and the pointed lines kept
the audience jumping between
stony silence and spontaneous
applause.

There is no doubt that the play
is entertaining through all three
one-hour acts. Entertaining and
exhausting.
The multitude of characters on
the set, contemporaneous scenes
of action, the roar of the flushing
toilet, and the pointed lines kept
the audience jumping between
stony silence and spontaneous
applause.

MOTLEY CREW—Miss Gilchrist (Doris Settle) Rio Rita (Douglas
Broyles) and Colette (Teresa Barnes) cheer their Irish heroes in the
drama department production of "The Hostage." The play presented
a battle between morals and politics in an Irish bawdyhouse.
The drama department has
succeeded in pulling together an
almost impossibly frenetic play in
five short weeks.
The Hostage, a tragi-comedy
by Irishman Brendan Behan, was
presented July 25-29 in the Little
Theater, under the direction of
Robert Mooney of the American
Conservatory Theater.
A sleazy flophouse in Dublin, „
1960, is the claustrophobic setting
for 16 characters caught in the
midst of the age-old Irish troubles.
And in the constant battle
between political idealism and
personal degenceracy nobody
comes out clean.
"Jesus lives! But he doesn't live
here," tells you everything you
have to know about the politics
and the bawdy-house residents.
Three prostitutes, a gay queen,
a "sociable" worker and an
anachronistic English ex-patriot
are among the motley household
under the management of an
ex-hero and his "nearly" wife.
Along with customers and
consorts, everyone gathers around
the bar to sing, to bicker and to
flaunt.
Patriotism and Tragedy
What happens when a young
English military hostage awaiting
his death sentence is billeted
among them? Nobody is able to
decide.
Strong feelings of patriotism
play ping-pong with the
free-for-all instinct to let the boy
escape, until his tragic death
affirms the irresolvability of the
situation in Ireland today.
But the play could take place
anywhere. The troubles in Ireland
only give structure to what a
production staffer termed "the
asshole of life."
Satirical Grab-Bag
The drama department calls
The Hostage a "grab-bag musical
comedy." And on one level it is.
Dry humor and satirical asides jab
at both Catholics and Protestants,
political involvement and
non-involvement, homosexuality,
prostitution and love, all
interlaced with flamboyant
drinking, singing, dancing and sex.
The fun and games are superb
entertainment, but they seem to
overshadow, or at least confuse,
the political message. After all, an
evening that begins with a
music-hall jig and ends with an
embarrassing death does leave you
wondering.
But the message is confusion —
"There's nowhere on earth like
the world," as the theme-song
goes.
Believable Performance
Charles Hallahan as Pat, the
house manager, and part-time
narrator, holds the play together
with an unbelievably believable
performance. His dimpled,
tousled, warm being holds the

fantastic happenings in the
context of reality.
William Moreing as Monsewer,
the oblivious, kilted English
anachronism who seems to live in
the W.C., is also excellent.
Doris Settle, who you may
remember as Elaine in The
Rehearsal, is delightful here as
Miss Gilchrist, the sociable
worker. The innocent Salvation
Army missionary comes into the
flophouse to save souls, but as the
object of everyone's resentment
she nearly loses her own.
There is no doubt that the play
is entertaining through all three
one-hour acts. Entertaining and
exhausting.
