Waylon Jennings: "Honky Tonk
Heroes"
(RCA APLI-0420)
Waylon Jennings is clearly one
of the leaders of the longhaired
jet-age cowboy rock genre. His
newest album, "Honky Tonk
Heroes," is a very strong
contribution.
Much of the album's strength is
due to the songwriting abilities of
Billie Joe Shaver. His melodies are
fairly standard country fare, but
his lyrics are something else again.
Time and again, Shaver comes
up with lines that make the
listener sit back, smile, and say "I
wish I'd written that." For
example, a verse of "Low Down
Freedom" ends with:
Cause I'd rather leave here
knowing
That I'd made a fool of love
before it made a fool of me.
And in "Ain't No God in
Mexico," there is the line
If I'd never felt the sunshine//
wouldn't cuss the rain,
If my feet could fit a railroad
track/I guess I'd have been a
train.
Jennings' voice is well suited to
Shaver's songs. He sings in a
strong baritone, a welcome relief
from so many rock singers who
consistently sing higher than their
natural range.
Whether the mood of the song
is quiet and tender or loud and
raunchy, Jennings does a
more-than-adequate job. He seems
at his best, however, with
medium-tempo, gently rocking
songs about movin' on, rivers
rollin' to the sea, and so on.

Jennings is backed on most of
the numbers by his normal road
band, the Waylors, with other
Nashville sidemen sitting in from
time to time. The instrumental
background is solid and
complementary, but the main
emphasis is on Jennings' vocals.
The only disappointing track
on the album is "We Had It All,"
which is muddied by the addition
of strings.
Most of the music, however, is
good, clean country music, played
by, according to Nashville DJ
Capt. Midnite's liner notes, "the
first of the last real cowboys."
Waylon Jennings will be
appearing at Marine World in
Redwood City, Saturday, August
11, on the bill behind Commander
Cody.
Vince Martin: "Vince Martin"
(Capitol ST-11181)
An awful lot of first albums
look the same. Vince Martin's is
no exception.
The closeup picture and the
singer's name on the front cover,
the artistic photo on the back
cover (in this case, a sunset over
water), the impressive list of
backup musicians, and the lyrics
sheet — all are there.
It sounds about like a typical
first album, too. There are some
interesting songs, and dabblings in
various styles, but nothing to
write home about.
One thing on the album worth
mention is the backup work of
Chris Darrow on dobro, mandolin,
guitar, fiddle, and piano.
Darrow has appeared on

i—• Jay Harlow

albums by the Nitty Gritty Dirt
Band, Kaleidoscope, Linda
Ronstadt, and others, and has
recorded two albums under his
own name. His presence adds
considerably to this album.
I can imagine several different
futures for Vince Martin's first
album. A few years and albums
from now, Martin may become a
major star and people will
rediscover the album.
Or some of its tracks may
appear someday in an anthology
or someone's collection of the
works of one of the backup
musicians.
Or maybe it will just drift into
oblivion with thousands of other
not-too-successful albums.
