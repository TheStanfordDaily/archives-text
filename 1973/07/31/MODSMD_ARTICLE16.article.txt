# Savoyards Stage Trial By Jury' With Enthusiasm And Distinction
## 
### GEORGE POWELL 
Savoyards are, by dictionary definition,
enthusiastic admirers of Gilbert and Sullivan operas,
so named because most were first staged at
London's Savoy Theatre.
The courtyard at Wilbur Hall last weekend was
the scene of the Stanford Savoyards summer
production, however. But it could have been just
about anywhere, because the verve and polish with
which Trial by Jury was presented could have
pleased the most jaded Savoyard.
Trial By Jury was first performed in 1875. It was
written to be a curtain raiser, sort of a crowd
warmup for the more lengthy G&S productions. Its
single act takes little more than half an hour to
present, but in that time, in typical Gilbert and
Sullivan fashion, it holds the English judicial system
up to gentle ridicule.
There are three major characters in the short

production. Rick Albrink, as the be-wigged learned
judge in this breach-of-promise case, effectively kept
himself the center of audience attention. His strong
singing, dancing and mugging overshadowed Gerald
Chappell as the defendant, who had promised to
marry the plaintiff (Patty Wolfe Tallmon).
Chappell, however, won the costume contest
easily, with white pants, a red and white sweater
and a red bow tie that would have attracted
attention if he did nothing more than walk on stage.
The two piano accompanists, the chorus of
bridesmaids and the gentlemen of the jury all
acquitted themselves with distinction, and after the
happy resolution of the judicial question, the cast
and large audience merged over punch and cookies.
The Savoyards next production will be Patience
or Bun thorn's Bride. Auditions, open to any
interested parties, will be held during autumn
quarter registration week.
