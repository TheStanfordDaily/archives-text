# 'The Emperor of The North'
## Film Exploits Raw Violence 
### ELLEN KENESHEA 
The Emperor of the North is a
brutal lumbering film that
purports to be about honor
among thieves, about the thin line
where guts can be tempered by
mercy, about friendship and
having heart.
Actually it's just about two
bruising, brawny iron-willed men
and one skinny, cheap, conniving
fellow and how they confront
each other and bash out their
differences.
The two men are Shack (Ernest
Borgnine) , a railroad conductor
who kills bums rather than let
them hitch a free ride on his train,
and A-Number One (Lee Marvin),
the best train-riding bum in the
business.
Out of pride in his profession
and a well-tended sense of
self-esteem, A-Number One vows
to ride Shack's train from one end
of the line to the other. For the
sake of the terror in the minds of
all who know him, Shack takes
steal mallet and chain in hand and
sets out to defeat A-Number One.
Drawn-Out Deduction
A-Number One is hampered by
the appearance of Cigarette (Keith
Carradine) a novice in the art of
bumming. It turns out that
Cigarette "has the juice but not
the heart" to be a great bum, a
fact apparent from the first
although it takes A-Number One
an inordinately long time to figure
it out.
But everything takes longer
than the content requires in the
film, and although director
Robert Aldrich (The Dirty Dozen,
Whatever Happened to Baby
Jane?, among many others) quite
ably keeps scenes moving and
episodes tense, nothing happens in
The Emperor of the North
beneath its vicious surface.
There was a time when Aldrich
confined sadism to the characters
on the screen instead of aiming it
at the audience, and such
brutality was integral to the
characters and the themes of his

films.
But Emperor uses its violence
not to define and comment upon
either Shack or A-Number One
and their world, but to assault the
viewers.
The question seems to be
"How much can you take," rather
than "What is necessary to the
film?" Because of this Emperor
exploits the violence it portrays,
and leaves the actors without
characters to develop when they
aren't smashing things up.
Borgnine overacts his way
through such deficiencies in his
character and motivation, and
tries to look as though he's ready
to pummel somebody given half a
chance or even none.
Stronger Chracterization
Marvin does better, mostly
because he's given a wider range
of possible emotions in his part,
because he's played the type —
quiet, strong, invincible,
incorruptible — before, and
because he's a better actor than
Borgnine.
Keith Carradine makes a sleazy
Cigarette, an annoying gnat-like
person, ingratiating and spineless.

He's so good at being
obnoxious, in fact, that it is
almost impossible to understand
why A-Number One would put up
with him at all, let alone take him
on as a cohort, except that if he
didn't the film would be
(mercifully) only half as long as it
is.
The screenplay runs to the
trivial throughout the film,
particularly in an excrutiatingly
banal tirade A-Number One
delivers as he disappears into the
distance at the end of the film.
Nasty But Adequate
Women are such nonentities in
the film that they do not even
appear long enough to be
exploited — it's a rough, mean
man's world.
And Aldrich knows how to
deal with the nastiness. No matter
how dislikable the whole tenor of
the film may be, Emperor is no
inept job.
The Emperor of the North hits,
and sometimes hits very hard. But
even before the fighting's over, it's
hard to remember what it was all
about.
