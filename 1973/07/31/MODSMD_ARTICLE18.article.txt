Senate Approves Campaign Reforms
WASHINGTON—The Senate yesterday approved the most
sweeping campaign reforms bill in American political
history, designed to end the era of "fat cat" campaign
contributors.
The bill would create a 16-member independent federal
election commission to oversee reforms and impose
penalties of up to $25,000 in fines and 10 years in jail for
violations of campaign spending limits.
The measure clamps a shoestring budget on candidates
for the presidency, the Senate and the House,
Contributions would be limited to $3,000 by an
individual to any one candidate or a maximum of $9,000,
if the candidate must face both a primary runoff and a
general election.
If the bill had been in effect in 1972, George
McGovern and Richard Nixon could not have spent over
$44.7 million on the primary and general elections
combined. The 1972 campaign may have actually cost the
Nixon re-election committee up to $55 million.
The bill passed 82-8 in the Senate. Immediately after
the vote the senators approved a joint resolution that sets
up an election reform commission requested by the
President. The commission will study a range of campaign
reforms, including a proposal that the president be elected
for a one six-year term. /
San Clemente Fund Total Disputed
SAN CLEMENTE—The New York Times reported Sunday
that total spending by all federal agencies for
improvements on President Nixon's homes here and in
Key Biscayne, Florida could approach the $10 million
mark.
The General Services Administration so far has
reported expenditures of $1.9 million for security
improvements at the presidential houses. That estimate is
far greater than the agency's original figures released May
25, that set the total at $39,000.
General Services officials have discounted the Times
report, but are currently preparing a new estimate. The
new figures are expected to reveal that the federal
government spent between $3.5 and $3.7 million on home
improvements. The forthcoming report will include total
government expenditures on the California and Florida
White Houses during the past five years.
Sources indicate the White House may also clarify the
President's transaction with New York industrialist
Robert Abpianalp, who bought 20 acres of Nixon's San
Clemente property for over one million dollars and
cancelled Nixon's outstanding loan.
The California State Board of Equilization yesterday
refused to investigate claims that Orange County
underassessed the western White House for tax purposes.
Board chairman William Bennett urged investigators to
examine the presidential property, but the four other
board members offered no support to Bennett's contention
that the San Clemente property had not been assessed to
full capacity.
Bennett disputed claims that the changes made in the
property were not actually "improvements." "The fence
down there is for all time," he said. "That stuff is there
forever and does improve the value of the property."
He also mentioned that the General Accounting Office,
a congressional investigating agency, is preparing a report
that will show that the security improvements were worth
millions of dollars.
"However, the state board members ignored Bennett's
claims and instead followed the advice of their lawyer,
Charles Otterman. Otterman insisted that the board, as a
state agency, had no authority to make an investigation.

U.S. Appeals Bombing Decision
WASHINGTON—Supreme Court Justice Thurgood
Marshall has taken under advisement a New York District
Court judge's order suspending further U.S. bombing in
Cambodia, and a restraining order obtained by the
government against that ruling.
Marshall met privately yesterday with government
lawyers and lawyers for several persons seeking a halt to
the bombing.
A hearing has been scheduled for Aug. 13, but as legal
arguments continue, American bombers continued strikes
in Cambodia for the 145 th consecutive day. Reports say
rebel troops forced Cambodian soldiers out of a village
near the capital yesterday.
In Laos, Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma and the
Pathet Lao have tentatively agreed to form a coalition
government officials say minor points not yet worked out
probably will not cause snags in the expected settlement.
Reports from Vietnam are not so optimistic, as the
ceasefire there continues to deteriorate.
The international truce team yesterday held its last
regular meeting including Canada, which will pull out of
the team today. One delegation head says the
under-manned truce team will continue to function on a
consultation basis, but will be unable to investigate
cease-fire violations or supervise prisoner releases until a
replacement for Canada is found.
Mortgage Bill Faces Veto
WASHINGTON—A joint congressional committee
yesterday approved a measure restoring HUD's authority
to grant FHA-insured mortgages.
Action on the bill is expected in both houses prior to
the August recess. However, sources say that the bill faces
possible veto because of several amendments.
The first forces the administration to release housing
funds impounded by the President. The second
amendment requires the government to finance repairs on
FHA-approved homes.
Farm Workers Picket Grape Growers
DELANO—The United Farm Workers (UFW), led by
Cesar Chavez, began picketing table grape growers at
California vineyards in the San Joaquin Valley yesterday
morning.
Talks between the union and 29 major growers
collapsed Sunday and the agreements under discussion
expired at midnight.
The walkout is aimed at preventing the loss of the
agreement signed in 1970 after the original grape boycott.
The UFW was born on the strength of those contracts,
and is now under increased pressure as growers are
dropping the UFW in favor of Teamster contracts.
Chavez said Sunday that talks broke down over issues
of pesticide usage, union recognition, and hiring halls.
Reports indicate that the UFW is rapidly losing
strength in the vineyards.
The Teamsters say they will pick up the 29 expired
contracts, claiming workers prefer their union to the
UFW.
Today's Weather
The San Francisco Bay Area weather forecast calls for fair

along the coast extending inland late night and mornings.
Temperatures will range from lows in the 50s to highs
near 60 along the coast and 70s inland. Westerly winds
