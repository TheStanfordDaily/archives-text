# PA Employees May Strike As Salary Talks Deadlock
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
A deadlock in salary negotiations
has created the possibility of a strike
by some 450 Palo Alto city
employees.
Approximately 150 of the
employees, represented by local 715 A
of the Service Employees International
Union (SEIU), AFL-CIO, voted
unanimously last week to seek strike
sanction from the SEIU.
If such sanction is granted, as is
expected, the workers will be able to
take a strike vote, possibly as early as
Friday.
SEIU represents all of Palo Alto's
employees except policemen, firemen,
and management. About 310 of the
450 workers represented are actually
dues-paying members of the union.
Most of these are from the utilities,
maintenance and work crew areas.
Talks between the city and the
employees ended Friday, and no
negotiation sessions have been planned
for this week.
Previous Stall
Contract negotiations stalled for
the first time on July 6, when the
union walked out of a meeting
charging the city with refusing to
bargain in good faith by making
"anti-union" statements to the press.
The negotiations were later
resumed, but only after an agreement
calling for a press blackout. Thus,
neither side is able to reveal how far
apart the two sides are.
If SEIU management does, in fact,
approve a strike, the membership of
local 715 A could take a strike vote at
any time. Such a strike could cripple
the day-to-day operations of the city.
Active Locals
About 1600 Stanford employees
are represented by SEIU local 680.
SEIU locals have been quite active in
the Bay area recently, holding strikes
of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART)
system and at the University of Santa
Clara.
The Stanford SEIU local, United
Stanford Employees (USE), is
currently trying to formulate a series
of contract demands to present to the
University this fall.
At the same time, USE is
attempting to negotiate with the
University regarding office space.
Union spokesman Jack Truher
stated yesterday that the University's
bargaining team has said it will be "out
of town for a month." He added, "the
University has been dragging its feet
every step of the way," during these
preliminary negotiations.
Good Faith?
"They refuse to give us office space
at any sort of reasonable price,"

Truher said. " Their delay is very
questionable behavior in law," which
calls for both sides to bargain in good
faith.
When USE does formulate its
contract demands, it will probably call
for an average wage increase of more
than four and one-half percent, the
average 1973-74 wage increase for
1000 non-union University employees.
'Inadequate' Raise
USE President Glenda Jones last
week called this increase "inadequate

to meet the needs of workers."
However, as the University refuses
to bargain with USE as a minority
union for non-union groups of
employees, "there's not much we can
do about it, " Jones said.
A minority of the group of 1000
workers, which includes most of the
University's clerical and secretarial
staff, belongs to USE.
USE may eventually attempt to
become official representative for the
entire group, Jones said.

questionable behavior in law," which
calls for both sides to bargain in good
faith.
When USE does formulate its
contract demands, it will probably call
for an average wage increase of more
than four and one-half percent, the
average 1973-74 wage increase for
1000 non-union University employees.
'Inadequate' Raise
USE President Glenda Jones last
week called this increase "inadequate

to meet the needs of workers."
However, as the University refuses
to bargain with USE as a minority
union for non-union groups of
employees, "there's not much we can
do about it, " Jones said.
A minority of the group of 1000
workers, which includes most of the
University's clerical and secretarial
staff, belongs to USE.
USE may eventually attempt to
become official representative for the
entire group, Jones said.
A deadlock in salary negotiations
has created the possibility of a strike
by some 450 Palo Alto city
employees.
Approximately 150 of the
employees, represented by local 715 A
of the Service Employees International
Union (SEIU), AFL-CIO, voted
unanimously last week to seek strike
sanction from the SEIU.
If such sanction is granted, as is
expected, the workers will be able to
take a strike vote, possibly as early as
Friday.
SEIU represents all of Palo Alto's
employees except policemen, firemen,
and management. About 310 of the
450 workers represented are actually
dues-paying members of the union.
Most of these are from the utilities,
maintenance and work crew areas.
Talks between the city and the
employees ended Friday, and no
negotiation sessions have been planned
for this week.
Previous Stall
Contract negotiations stalled for
the first time on July 6, when the
union walked out of a meeting
charging the city with refusing to
bargain in good faith by making
"anti-union" statements to the press.
The negotiations were later
resumed, but only after an agreement
calling for a press blackout. Thus,
neither side is able to reveal how far
apart the two sides are.
If SEIU management does, in fact,
approve a strike, the membership of
local 715 A could take a strike vote at
any time. Such a strike could cripple
the day-to-day operations of the city.
Active Locals
About 1600 Stanford employees
are represented by SEIU local 680.
SEIU locals have been quite active in
the Bay area recently, holding strikes
of the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART)
system and at the University of Santa
Clara.
The Stanford SEIU local, United
Stanford Employees (USE), is
currently trying to formulate a series
of contract demands to present to the
University this fall.
At the same time, USE is
attempting to negotiate with the
University regarding office space.
Union spokesman Jack Truher
stated yesterday that the University's
bargaining team has said it will be "out
of town for a month." He added, "the
University has been dragging its feet
every step of the way," during these
preliminary negotiations.
Good Faith?
"They refuse to give us office space
at any sort of reasonable price,"

Truher said. " Their delay is very
questionable behavior in law," which
calls for both sides to bargain in good
faith.
