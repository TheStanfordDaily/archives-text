# Licensing Ordinance Hearing Postponed
## 
### 
A Superior Court judge yesterday
postponed until Thursday a hearing on
the city of Palo Alto's controversial
new apartment manager licensing
ordinance.
The Tri-County Apartment
Association filed the suit to enjoin
enforcement of the ordinance,
scheduled to take effect Friday.
The Association claims that some
managers would be "irreparably
damaged" by "criminal prosecution"
for failing to obtain licenses from the
city.
Managers argue that the ordinance,
designed to curb racial discrimination
in rental housing, will force them to
divulge vacancy and rate information
to competitors, hurting them
economically.
'Lay Soul Bare'
According to Clarke Wells, a
spokesmen for the managers, "some of
the information is very competitive.
You would just lay your soul bare to
your competitors."
"The association's position is that
we're willing to approach the problem
of discrimination, but not through
licensing," he stated.
Although apartment seekers obtain
the same information, Wells maintains
that "that's different from publishing
it," because prospective tenants learn
rates for a single unit "on an individual
basis."
Another Way
He also argues that managers can
enforce prohibitions against
discrimination "within our own
organization. For the past several
years, we have always been faced with
the CORE (Congress of Racial
Equality) and NAACP (National
Association for the Advancement of
Colored People) approach of testing."

Wells said manager organizations
can investigate complaints of
discrimination, suspend members who
discriminate, or "if he is not a member
we can report him to the city. There is
a growing feeling we'll have to start
doing this."
Wells said he might agree to change
discrimination from a civil to a
criminal violation, although he would
like to see the mechanics" of
legislation first. "Some of us feel
strongly enough about it that it would
be an approach I'd probably be in
favor of," he added.
Issue Not Alleged
Marilyn Norek, the assistant city
attorney who drafted the ordinance,
argued that if managers really believe
competitive information is the "real
issue, they haven't bothered to allege
it" during city deliberations on the
ordinance.
"That goes to the reasonableness of
the ordinance," she observed, and
should have been raised before
enactment.
Norek said managers had earlier
claimed the ordinance violated
preemption clauses in California's
Rumford Act and in real estate broker
laws.
Expected Earlier
"We expected the law suit four
months ago, instead of a few days
before the ordinance was due to go
into effect," she said.
None of the issues raised in the suit
surprised city lawyers, Norek noted.
City officials report that
applications for licenses are proceeding
normally. They anticipate an 85 to 90
percent response from the
approximately 632 apartment
complexes subject to the ordinance.
