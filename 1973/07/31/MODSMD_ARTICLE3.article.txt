# Not Used Here Since 1966
## Nixon Tape Role Clarified 
### 
Associate Psychiatry Prof. C. Peter Rosenbaum has
expanded his comments on recent articles concerning use
at the Medical School of a tape of Richard Nixon's 1962
gubernatorial election concession speech as an example of
an "acute paranoid state."
Rosenbaum denied he told a Chicago Sun-Times
reporter that the tapes were used as an example of acute
paranoid state. Instead, he said yesterday, the tape was
used to demonstrate "paranoid trends" in that one
particular speech. "Nixon's reaction is one that could have
happened to anyone," he said.
(Friday's Daily article on the tape was attributed
to a story appearing in Friday's Sun-Times. In fact, the
Sun-Times story appeared on Saturday. The Daily regrets
any confusion this might have caused.)
Rosenbaum told the Daily yesterday that the tape
was used "once a year for four or five years" in a
Psychiatry Clinic staff seminar — not in graduate seminars,
as the Sun-Times stated.
Rosenbaum also said use of the tape ended in
1966 or 1967.
The psychiatrist admitted yesterday that he had

declined to provide that information for publication to
Sun-Times reporter William Hines when he first
questioned Rosenbaum.
However, Rosenbaum said, he intended to tell the
reporter that information after "collecting my thoughts"
on the matter. "He [Hines] knew I wasn't cutting him
off" from information, Rosenbaum said.
Hines and Rosenbaum talked Friday, Rosenbaum
said. However he said, the Sun-Times story still did not
include the fact that the tapes had not been used for
several years, still had them used in graduate seminars, and
still referred to the "acute paranoid state."
Rosenbaum again stressed yesterday that he was
"in no way attempting to comment on his [Nixon's]
personality structure." Any such inferences would be
"foolish and demeaning," he said in a statement Friday.
He called the tape a "15-minute excerpt of
history." Nixon's famous reaction — "You won't have
Nixon to kick around anymore" — was "clear and vivid. It
was used for teaching purposes along with many other
examples showing the virtually universal effects of a
stressful experience," Rosenbaum said.
