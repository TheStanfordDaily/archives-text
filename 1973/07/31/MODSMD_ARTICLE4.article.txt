# CUS Chairman Criticizes Lyman's Reply To Report
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS) Chairman Edwin Good
yesterday criticized President Richard
W. Lyman's comments on the recent
CUS report concerning the SWOPSI
Policy Board's rejection of a course
proposed by controversial Prof.
William Shockley.
In a sometimes sharply-worded
statement, Good said, "I cannot let
the President's conclusions about the
report go unchallenged."
Good took issue with several points
of Lyman's formal response to the
CUS report, and said it was
"unfortunate" that Lyman
commented on the report on KZSU's
"Campus Conference" before
discussing the report with him.
"I believe that some of his
[Lyman's] disquiet about the report
could have been alleviated if Prof.
[Hubert] Marshall [chairman of the
CUS subcommittee that authored the
report] and I could have discussed
some of his points with him," Good
said.
Unanswered Questions
Lyman said over KZSU last week
that he did not feel the report
"answered all the questions I raised
adequately" when he asked CUS to
investigate the tumdown last August.
The CUS subcommittee reported in
mid-July that SWOPSI's rejection of
the proposed course on the heritability
of intelligence was based on "reasoned
and serious" grounds.
(Shockley, a professor of electrical
engineering and Nobel Prize-winner,
has theorized that blacks are
genetically less intelligent than
whites.)
Misleading Letter
The CUS report found that the
letter of rejection sent to Shockley by
SWOPSI Director Dan Lewis was
"damagingly misleading" in that it
misstated the real reasons for the
turndown.
However, the report concluded,
those real reasons for the decision
were compelling enough to justify it.
In his formal response, Lyman
noted that the report considered at
length whether a faculty member has a
right to teach a course for credit
outside his field of expertise.
"Not surprisingly," he said, "the
committee finds that on such "right"
exists. I would go further and say that
no such right has been asserted ... I
believe the proposition to be absurd
on the face of it."
Logical Criterion
Good responded: "I fail. .. to see
that the question... is an absurd
question. An answer to that question
seems to me logically necessary to
establish that the Policy Board had the
right, on application of its chosen
criteria, to reject the proposal of a
faculty member."
Good also said he had the
"impression" that an ad hoc
committee that examined a
Shockley-proposed Graduate Special
course "considered precisely that
question and did not treat it as
absurd."
Lyman also expressed concern over
the "seemingly rather speedy dismissal
of the question of consistency in the

SWOPSI Policy Board's considerations
of competence."
"I am at a loss to know what leads
the President to this conclusion. In
fact, it is not true," Good answered.
He said that question of consistency
was one of the subcommittee's major
topics, and was also considered at two
lengthy meetings by the entire CUS.
Good said Lyman misunderstood a
section of the report dealing with the
need of consensus among class
participants, claiming Lyman "finds it
ominous that the SWOPSI Policy
Board is really interested in a good
education."
He said the "misunderstanding"
could have been avoided if Lyman had
met with he and Marshall first.
Competence
As for the actual question of
Shockley's competence to lead the
workshop, Lyman said a footnote in
the report referring to a memo on file
showing that the SWOPSI Board
routinely considers the competence of
potential instructors was "hardly a
sufficient answer."
That footnote, Good responded,
was "intended as a message to the
President that he ought to ask" for the
memorandum, which, he said, is a
confidential listing of "names, dates
and titles of proposals that the
SWOPSI Policy Board rejected"
because of doubts about the

competence of the instructor.
He said Lyman was told about the
existence of the memo several times,
but did not ask to see it. Thus, he said,
Lyman "can hardly dismiss it as an
insufficient answer."
Distasteful Substance
Lyman again asked whether
Shockley's course was not turned
down because "the substance of his
views were distasteful to those doing
the judging."
While he said the evidence "does
not support an unequivocal answer" to
that question, he said there was reason
to assume the question "is not a
frivolous one."
Good reiterated that the
subcommittee "found no one for
whom the substance of Prof.
Shockley's views was determinative for
a vote ....
"The President, can, if he wishes,
guess that that problem lurked in the
minds of Policy Board
members ... [but] to conclude that,
it would be better never to have had
an enquiry." Lyman's remark, Good
said, was "at best, incautious."
There was no immediate response
from Lyman on Good's statement. A
spokesman said the President, in Los
Angeles for the funeral of University
trustee Benjamin S. Crocker Jr., would
have no further comment at least until
tomorrow.

[Hubert] Marshall [chairman of the
CUS subcommittee that authored the
report] and I could have discussed
some of his points with him," Good
said.
Unanswered Questions
Lyman said over KZSU last week
that he did not feel the report
"answered all the questions I raised
adequately" when he asked CUS to
investigate the tumdown last August.
The CUS subcommittee reported in
mid-July that SWOPSI's rejection of
the proposed course on the heritability
of intelligence was based on "reasoned
and serious" grounds.
(Shockley, a professor of electrical
engineering and Nobel Prize-winner,
has theorized that blacks are
genetically less intelligent than
whites.)
Misleading Letter
The CUS report found that the
letter of rejection sent to Shockley by
SWOPSI Director Dan Lewis was
"damagingly misleading" in that it
misstated the real reasons for the
turndown.
However, the report concluded,
those real reasons for the decision
were compelling enough to justify it.
In his formal response, Lyman
noted that the report considered at
length whether a faculty member has a
right to teach a course for credit
outside his field of expertise.
"Not surprisingly," he said, "the
committee finds that on such "right"
exists. I would go further and say that
no such right has been asserted ... I
believe the proposition to be absurd
on the face of it."
Logical Criterion
Good responded: "I fail. .. to see
that the question... is an absurd
question. An answer to that question
seems to me logically necessary to
establish that the Policy Board had the
right, on application of its chosen
criteria, to reject the proposal of a
faculty member."
Good also said he had the
"impression" that an ad hoc
committee that examined a
Shockley-proposed Graduate Special
course "considered precisely that
question and did not treat it as
absurd."
Lyman also expressed concern over
the "seemingly rather speedy dismissal
of the question of consistency in the

SWOPSI Policy Board's considerations
of competence."
"I am at a loss to know what leads
the President to this conclusion. In
fact, it is not true," Good answered.
He said that question of consistency
was one of the subcommittee's major
topics, and was also considered at two
lengthy meetings by the entire CUS.
Good said Lyman misunderstood a
section of the report dealing with the
need of consensus among class
participants, claiming Lyman "finds it
ominous that the SWOPSI Policy
Board is really interested in a good
education."
He said the "misunderstanding"
could have been avoided if Lyman had
met with he and Marshall first.
Competence
As for the actual question of
Shockley's competence to lead the
workshop, Lyman said a footnote in
the report referring to a memo on file
showing that the SWOPSI Board
routinely considers the competence of
potential instructors was "hardly a
sufficient answer."
That footnote, Good responded,
was "intended as a message to the
President that he ought to ask" for the
memorandum, which, he said, is a
confidential listing of "names, dates
and titles of proposals that the
SWOPSI Policy Board rejected"
because of doubts about the

competence of the instructor.
He said Lyman was told about the
existence of the memo several times,
but did not ask to see it. Thus, he said,
Lyman "can hardly dismiss it as an
insufficient answer."
Distasteful Substance
Lyman again asked whether
Shockley's course was not turned
down because "the substance of his
views were distasteful to those doing
the judging."
While he said the evidence "does
not support an unequivocal answer" to
that question, he said there was reason
to assume the question "is not a
frivolous one."
Good reiterated that the
subcommittee "found no one for
whom the substance of Prof.
Shockley's views was determinative for
a vote ....
"The President, can, if he wishes,
guess that that problem lurked in the
minds of Policy Board
members ... [but] to conclude that,
it would be better never to have had
an enquiry." Lyman's remark, Good
said, was "at best, incautious."
There was no immediate response
from Lyman on Good's statement. A
spokesman said the President, in Los
Angeles for the funeral of University
trustee Benjamin S. Crocker Jr., would
have no further comment at least until
tomorrow.
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS) Chairman Edwin Good
yesterday criticized President Richard
W. Lyman's comments on the recent
CUS report concerning the SWOPSI
Policy Board's rejection of a course
proposed by controversial Prof.
William Shockley.
In a sometimes sharply-worded
statement, Good said, "I cannot let
the President's conclusions about the

Good took issue with several points
of Lyman's formal response to the

"unfortunate" that Lyman
commented on the report on KZSU's

SWOPSI Director Dan Lewis was
"damagingly misleading" in that it
misstated the real reasons for the
turndown.
However, the report concluded,
those real reasons for the decision
were compelling enough to justify it.
In his formal response, Lyman
noted that the report considered at
length whether a faculty member has a
right to teach a course for credit
outside his field of expertise.
"Not surprisingly," he said, "the
committee finds that on such "right"
exists. I would go further and say that
no such right has been asserted ... I
believe the proposition to be absurd
on the face of it."
Logical Criterion
Good responded: "I fail. .. to see
that the question... is an absurd
question. An answer to that question
seems to me logically necessary to
establish that the Policy Board had the
right, on application of its chosen
criteria, to reject the proposal of a
faculty member."
Good also said he had the
"impression" that an ad hoc
committee that examined a
Shockley-proposed Graduate Special
course "considered precisely that
question and did not treat it as
absurd."
Lyman also expressed concern over
the "seemingly rather speedy dismissal
of the question of consistency in the

SWOPSI Policy Board's considerations
of competence."
"I am at a loss to know what leads
the President to this conclusion. In
fact, it is not true," Good answered.
He said that question of consistency
was one of the subcommittee's major
topics, and was also considered at two
lengthy meetings by the entire CUS.
Good said Lyman misunderstood a
section of the report dealing with the
need of consensus among class
participants, claiming Lyman "finds it
ominous that the SWOPSI Policy
Board is really interested in a good
education."
He said the "misunderstanding"
could have been avoided if Lyman had
met with he and Marshall first.
Competence
As for the actual question of
Shockley's competence to lead the
workshop, Lyman said a footnote in
the report referring to a memo on file
showing that the SWOPSI Board
routinely considers the competence of
potential instructors was "hardly a
sufficient answer."
That footnote, Good responded,
was "intended as a message to the
President that he ought to ask" for the
memorandum, which, he said, is a
confidential listing of "names, dates
and titles of proposals that the
SWOPSI Policy Board rejected"
because of doubts about the

competence of the instructor.
He said Lyman was told about the
existence of the memo several times,
but did not ask to see it. Thus, he said,
Lyman "can hardly dismiss it as an
insufficient answer."
Distasteful Substance
Lyman again asked whether
Shockley's course was not turned
down because "the substance of his
views were distasteful to those doing
the judging."
While he said the evidence "does
not support an unequivocal answer" to
that question, he said there was reason
to assume the question "is not a
frivolous one."
Good reiterated that the
subcommittee "found no one for
whom the substance of Prof.
Shockley's views was determinative for
a vote ....
"The President, can, if he wishes,
guess that that problem lurked in the
minds of Policy Board
members ... [but] to conclude that,
it would be better never to have had
an enquiry." Lyman's remark, Good
said, was "at best, incautious."
There was no immediate response
from Lyman on Good's statement. A
spokesman said the President, in Los
Angeles for the funeral of University
trustee Benjamin S. Crocker Jr., would
have no further comment at least until
tomorrow.
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS) Chairman Edwin Good
yesterday criticized President Richard
W. Lyman's comments on the recent
CUS report concerning the SWOPSI
Policy Board's rejection of a course
proposed by controversial Prof.
William Shockley.
In a sometimes sharply-worded
statement, Good said, "I cannot let
the President's conclusions about the
report go unchallenged."
Good took issue with several points
of Lyman's formal response to the
CUS report, and said it was
"unfortunate" that Lyman
commented on the report on KZSU's
"Campus Conference" before
discussing the report with him.
"I believe that some of his
[Lyman's] disquiet about the report
could have been alleviated if Prof.
[Hubert] Marshall [chairman of the
CUS subcommittee that authored the
report] and I could have discussed
some of his points with him," Good
said.
Unanswered Questions
Lyman said over KZSU last week
that he did not feel the report
"answered all the questions I raised
adequately" when he asked CUS to
investigate the tumdown last August.
The CUS subcommittee reported in
mid-July that SWOPSI's rejection of
the proposed course on the heritability
of intelligence was based on "reasoned
and serious" grounds.
(Shockley, a professor of electrical
engineering and Nobel Prize-winner,
has theorized that blacks are
genetically less intelligent than
whites.)
