# Skylab II Astronauts Endure Despite Ills
## 
### 
Skylab II sailed smoothly into
space on Saturday, beginning the
longest mission in NASA's history.
The launching of astronauts Alan L.
Bean, Jack R. Lousma, and Electrical
Engineering Prof. Owen K. Garriott
was successful, despite a heavy fog
covering at Cape Kennedy.
Although the launching went as
planned, the astronauts are now at
least a day behind on their flight
schedule because motion sickness has
plagued all three men.
Bean received permission Sunday
from Mission Control for the
astronauts to sleep late yesterday
morning. "It's becoming obvious to us
that we're just not as spry up here as
we'd like to be," Bean said.
The motion sickness has been
attributed to the difficulty that the
men have had in adapting to
weightlessness, and doctors believe
that the problem will disappear when
their bodies have adapted.
NASA doctors have prescribed
medication and head exercises to help
the astronauts. As one exercise,
mission control instructed the
astronauts to tilt their heads from side
to side 900 to 1200 times every few
hours.
The spacemen were not to exert
themselves all day yesterday, but, they
were awakened from sleep yesterday
morning after Mission Control
detected a leak in the nitrogen-oxygen

gas pressurization system.
After a systematic check, the men
traced the leak to a handle on the
trash airlock which was not properly
closed. The astronauts continued their
resting period after fixing the leak.
A few hours later, the men told
Mission Control that they still had
some symptoms of their illness.
Lousma had taken another anti-nausea
pill, and Bean said that he and Garriott
were still not feeling up to par.
Lousma has been the spaceman
most effected by the seasickness, and a
space agency physician who talked
with the crew in a private medical
conference said Lousma has been
taking pills to keep from vomiting.
A space walk scheduled for today,
has been postponed until at least
Thursday.
The walk will enable Garriott and
Lousma to install a second sun shade
on the outside of the station to
reinforce the shade installed by the
Skylab I crew, and to change the film
in a solar telescope camera system.
The astronauts spent the first two
days of their trip activating the space
station — turning on electronics and
plumbing systems and moving in
hardware for the experiments.
Experimental scientific work will
begin after the space walk. The 59-day
mission will be primarily concerned
with the study of the sun through the
use of a cluster of eight telescope
instruments.

NOTING CHANGES—During his stay at the Stanford in Britain earlier this
month Overseas Campuses Director Mark Mancall outlined the basic changes in
the foreign cainpussystem. Mancall suggested a new type of program toreplacc
the Stanford in Austria campus, new types of foreign language training and a
nine-month program of study as possible improvements for the campuses.
Skylab II sailed smoothly into
space on Saturday, beginning the
longest mission in NASA's history.
The launching of astronauts Alan L.
Bean, Jack R. Lousma, and Electrical
Engineering Prof. Owen K. Garriott
was successful, despite a heavy fog
covering at Cape Kennedy.
Although the launching went as
planned, the astronauts are now at
least a day behind on their flight
schedule because motion sickness has
plagued all three men.
Bean received permission Sunday
from Mission Control for the
astronauts to sleep late yesterday
morning. "It's becoming obvious to us
that we're just not as spry up here as
we'd like to be," Bean said.
The motion sickness has been
attributed to the difficulty that the
men have had in adapting to
weightlessness, and doctors believe
that the problem will disappear when
their bodies have adapted.
NASA doctors have prescribed
medication and head exercises to help
the astronauts. As one exercise,
mission control instructed the
astronauts to tilt their heads from side
to side 900 to 1200 times every few
hours.
The spacemen were not to exert
themselves all day yesterday, but, they
were awakened from sleep yesterday
morning after Mission Control
detected a leak in the nitrogen-oxygen

gas pressurization system.
After a systematic check, the men
traced the leak to a handle on the
trash airlock which was not properly
closed. The astronauts continued their
resting period after fixing the leak.
A few hours later, the men told
Mission Control that they still had
some symptoms of their illness.
Lousma had taken another anti-nausea
pill, and Bean said that he and Garriott
were still not feeling up to par.
Lousma has been the spaceman
most effected by the seasickness, and a
space agency physician who talked
with the crew in a private medical
conference said Lousma has been
taking pills to keep from vomiting.
A space walk scheduled for today,
has been postponed until at least
Thursday.
The walk will enable Garriott and
Lousma to install a second sun shade
on the outside of the station to
reinforce the shade installed by the
Skylab I crew, and to change the film
in a solar telescope camera system.
The astronauts spent the first two
days of their trip activating the space
station — turning on electronics and
plumbing systems and moving in
hardware for the experiments.
Experimental scientific work will
begin after the space walk. The 59-day
mission will be primarily concerned
with the study of the sun through the
use of a cluster of eight telescope
instruments.
