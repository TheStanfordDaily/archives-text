# Mancall Sees Overseas Campus Changes

Special to the Daily
MAIDENHEAD, England—Recently
appointed Overseas Campuses Director
Mark Mancall said here that while he
expects a new program of study in
Austria, he "can guarantee there is no
way that we're going back to the
campus situation in Vienna."
Mancall's remarks came during an
interview at Stanford in Britain as he
and three other University officials
neared the end of a three-week tour of
the five overseas campuses in Italy,
Germany, Austria, England, and
France.
The associate history professor,
chosen last quarter to succeed former
Director Robert Walker, stressed that
the tour was to form general
impressions of the study centers
abroad.
But referring to a number of
revisions already planned, he added,
"We're going to change. That's the
major decision that we made."
Mancall discussed possible reasons
for low attendance overseas, pledged
to beef up the academic program,
outlined plans for expanding
the number of countries involved in
the system, and criticized the current
student attitude toward travel.
Even though the new director
repeated that he is still acquainting

nimself and his staff with the overseas
program and that his decisions are
subject to later modification, it is clear
that he already plans a number of
major changes.
Mancall confirmed that following
summer quarter, Stanford in Austria
will be disbanded. This move,
prompted by poor attendance, follows
the Faculty Senate's June 25 decision
to let the lease expire on the current
building.
New Vienna Program
But, he said, "A plan is already
under consideration by the Austrian
educational authorities for a new and
different kind of program in Vienna."
According to Mancall, the program
may be open to 30-40 students, with
one professor from the home campus.
Mancall's associate director for
finance and budget planning, Don
Price, said students would probably
live and study in the University of
Vienna. Price added that three
members of the present Stanford in
Austria staff have been retained while
the rest have been fired.
Personnel Staying
Those staying on are Director of
Studies Siegfried Kominger, who is a
rector at the University of Vienna;
Associate Director for Cultural Affairs
Hedwig Thiming, and head German
instructor Margaret Mehrl. These three

would probably be involved in the new
Austria program as well.
Mancall emphasized that Stanford
cannot afford to set up anymore
overseas campuses like those now in
England, France, Italy, and Germany.
"There is no alternative," he
explains, "with the rising European
inflation and the continuing pressure
on the American dollar."
Finance Director Price confirmed
that analysis, pointing to a 20 percent
increase in foreign currency costs in
Germany and the widening gap
between what students pay and what
it costs to feed and house them.
Low Attendance
Another problem facing the
overseas system is lower-than-normal
student attendance. Price noted that
out of a possible 94 positions, 30 are
filled in Germany this summer; 46 out
of 65 in Austria; 48 out of 80 in
.Britain; 51 of 65 in France- and 62 out
of 65 in Italy.
Price added that the figures for fall
quarter look better, but it is known
that many students drop out, and
Price regretted that poor participation
has been a problem since around 1970.
Mancall favors surveying students
involved in the overseas program —
both those who do come and those
who decide to drop out — to discover
the causes of poor attendance.

But many undergraduates say they
cannot go overseas because they are
tied to home campus requirements for
pre-medicine and other
science-oriented courses of study.
"One of the first things we have to
do," Mancall predicted, "is to
persuade the pre-professional programs
that a certain component of an
undergraduate's education in the
humanities and social sciences, beyond
the distribution requirements, is
crucial to producing intelligent
members of their professions.
"I think that the social and
humanistic areas of education are as
fundamental to a doctor or a scientist
as they are to anyone else."
Curriculum Patterns
He said that pre-professional
departments must first be persuaded
of that philosophy on an intellectual
level. Then, he said, the University
must develop curriculum patterns that
will permit students to come overseas
even though involved in scientific
training.
Mancall also pledged to "open up"
science training overseas. "The
experience of a math or science major
to come abroad and take courses in
local institutions where the same
subject is being taught and therefore
experience the supranational quality
of the discipline could be very
exciting," he explained.
Mancall said another student
complaint is that the current overseas
academic schedule, with quarters
during the summer, discourages those
who must work. He favors a
nine-month, three-quarter program of
study.
New Overseas Season
"I want to integrate the overseas
system with the rhythm of study at
home," he said, forecasting an overseas
season that would begin in the fall and
end in the spring, as at home.
Students could come for one, two,
or three quarters, depending on their
requirements. This proposal, he
cautioned, must await a test of student
interest.
He added that another solution for
those who want to work in the

summer is to find employment in
another country.
Vacant Jobs
"In Germany," he related, "about
600,000 jobs are vacant. Ten to 15
Stanford students from the last
Germany group now live in
Beutelsbach because they can walk off
the street and be employed, earning a
currency which is doing considerably
better than the dollar."
Mancall called the idea "a great way
to get into the local scene" and
expressed a desire to explore this
possibility in depth.
Mancall said the most important
changes to come will involve the
academic picture overseas, however.
He called language training
"inadequate," and revealed that he
plans an experimental month-long
intensive Italian program in Florence.
Language Course
The language course will be taught
in September to the next group of
Stanford in Italy students and
repeated in March for the group
following them.
"After this month," he said,
"students will have internalized
enough Italian to begin moving into
the Florence community in a way that
has been more difficult before. And it
may give us a better handle on how to
teach languages elsewhere overseas."
He admitted that he does not know
in detail the changes in appointing
professors for teaching overseas
approved by the Faculty Senate last
spring. The change places more
responsibility for the choice on
Mancall.
More Participation
But in general, he said he wants
"more active participation on the part
of the home faculty in the
appointment and judging of our
people teaching overseas."
Mancall was particularly critical of
the way students use the present
three-week break between quarters
overseas for travel.
"The idea of running around
Europe and trying to see Paris in two
days is useless. Anyone can come over
and be a tourist. What we ought to
nrovide is intelligent travel
opportunities."

He told of a field trip taken by the
Italian group — which he taught spring
quarter — to Greece. He called it "one
of the most exciting educational
experiences I've had in my life.
"The Italian archeology professor
who guided our group to Greece made
the stones come alive."
Mancall said some students were so
excited by the trip that they took
their travel break in Crete and Troy to
continue exploring the archeology.
As an alternative, Mancall suggested
taking a week off from study and
using the two weekends and
intervening five days two or three
times. Under his tentative nine-month
proposal, he foresees bringing students
over early and having them travel at
the end of the three quarters, after
planning travel through course work.
Charter Flights
Mancall plans to subject the current
charter flights to a professional study.
Smiling broadly, he said, "I have a
fantasy about the charter flight. We
could drop off all the overseas
students in Paris with a map and
directions and tell them to be at their
campuses in 10 days.
"It would not be required, but
those who did would find out what
traveling involves and could then settle
down to serious studying when the
quarter begins."
For the future, Mancall said he
"can state positively right now that
we're not going to establish any more
campuses."
Smaller Groups
Instead, he favors programs where
smaller groups of students live in
different conditions than at Palo Alto
and become "more integrated into the
local academic scene." One possible
site for such a program is Japan,

Mancall suggested.
He declined to predict the future
for Stanford in Britain, France, and
Germany, but said he knows Italy well
and said the site for the campus there
is superb.
Even so, he has investigated the
possibility of getting out of the
Florence villa and placing students
with families, he said.
"But," he said, "the Italian family
structure doesn't easily permit
outsiders to come in and live either as
members of the family or as boarders.
It's a real cultural difference."
'Back On Feet'
Mancall said he hopes in three years
to get the overseas program "back on
its feet again." He stated, "In some
areas it may not have maintained the
respect of the faculty. The last couple
of years have been difficult.
"But I want this to become a
central part of the whole Stanford
institution, rather than on the margin.
At the end of three years I hope to see
something of a different spirit.
"I hope for more activity, a
three-quarter system, more in-depth
study and teaching, more intelligent
and planned travel. I want to see a
more stimulating environment that
would result from our programs being
in the position where they are."
