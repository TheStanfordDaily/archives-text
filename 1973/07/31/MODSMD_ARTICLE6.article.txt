# Mancall Sees Overseas Campus Changes

Special to the Daily
MAIDENHEAD, England—Recently
appointed Overseas Campuses Director
Mark Mancall said here that while he
expects a new program of study in
Austria, he "can guarantee there is no
way that we're going back to the
campus situation in Vienna."
Mancall's remarks came during an
interview at Stanford in Britain as he
and three other University officials
neared the end of a three-week tour of
the five overseas campuses in Italy,
Germany, Austria, England, and
France.
The associate history professor,
chosen last quarter to succeed former
Director Robert Walker, stressed that
the tour was to form general
impressions of the study centers
abroad.
But referring to a number of
revisions already planned, he added,
"We're going to change. That's the
major decision that we made."
Mancall discussed possible reasons
for low attendance overseas, pledged
to beef up the academic program,
outlined plans for expanding
the number of countries involved in
the system, and criticized the current
student attitude toward travel.
Even though the new director
repeated that he is still acquainting

nimself and his staff with the overseas
program and that his decisions are
subject to later modification, it is clear
that he already plans a number of
major changes.
Mancall confirmed that following
summer quarter, Stanford in Austria
will be disbanded. This move,
prompted by poor attendance, follows
the Faculty Senate's June 25 decision
to let the lease expire on the current
building.
New Vienna Program
But, he said, "A plan is already
under consideration by the Austrian
educational authorities for a new and
different kind of program in Vienna."
According to Mancall, the program
may be open to 30-40 students, with
one professor from the home campus.
Mancall's associate director for
finance and budget planning, Don
Price, said students would probably
live and study in the University of
Vienna. Price added that three
members of the present Stanford in
Austria staff have been retained while
the rest have been fired.
Personnel Staying
Those staying on are Director of
Studies Siegfried Kominger, who is a
rector at the University of Vienna;
Associate Director for Cultural Affairs
Hedwig Thiming, and head German
instructor Margaret Mehrl. These three

would probably be involved in the new
Austria program as well.
Mancall emphasized that Stanford
cannot afford to set up anymore
overseas campuses like those now in
England, France, Italy, and Germany.
"There is no alternative," he
explains, "with the rising European
inflation and the continuing pressure
on the American dollar."
Finance Director Price confirmed
that analysis, pointing to a 20 percent
increase in foreign currency costs in
Germany and the widening gap
between what students pay and what
it costs to feed and house them.
Low Attendance
Another problem facing the
overseas system is lower-than-normal
student attendance. Price noted that
out of a possible 94 positions, 30 are
filled in Germany this summer; 46 out
of 65 in Austria; 48 out of 80 in
.Britain; 51 of 65 in France- and 62 out
of 65 in Italy.
Price added that the figures for fall
quarter look better, but it is known
that many students drop out, and
Price regretted that poor participation
has been a problem since around 1970.
Mancall favors surveying students
involved in the overseas program —
both those who do come and those
who decide to drop out — to discover
the causes of poor attendance.

But many undergraduates say they
cannot go overseas because they are
tied to home campus requirements for
pre-medicine and other
science-oriented courses of study.
"One of the first things we have to
do," Mancall predicted, "is to
persuade the pre-professional programs
that a certain component of an
undergraduate's education in the
humanities and social sciences, beyond
the distribution requirements, is
crucial to producing intelligent
members of their professions.
"I think that the social and
humanistic areas of education are as
fundamental to a doctor or a scientist
as they are to anyone else."
Curriculum Patterns
He said that pre-professional
departments must first be persuaded
of that philosophy on an intellectual
level. Then, he said, the University
must develop curriculum patterns that
will permit students to come overseas
even though involved in scientific
training.
Mancall also pledged to "open up"
science training overseas. "The
experience of a math or science major
to come abroad and take courses in
local institutions where the same
subject is being taught and therefore
