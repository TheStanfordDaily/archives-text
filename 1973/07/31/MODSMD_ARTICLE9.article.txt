# 'Legalized' Government Crime
## What Can President Get Away With? 
### 
Can a man holding the office
of the Presidency of the United
States commit burglary with
impunity? Could he get away with
murder?
These are questions raised by
the July 25 testimony of Nixon's
former aide John D. Ehrlichman
and Ehrlichman's lawyer, John J.
Wilson. Both men told the
Senate's Watergate committee
that the rules in practice today in
the American government allow
the President and his subordinates
to commit crimes such as burglary
in the name of national security.
The similarity of governmental
activity and common criminal
activity has been made clear by
the burglary of the office of
Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist, but
this remarkable likeness is hardly
a new phenomenon.
Richard J. Barnet begins his
newest book, The Roots of War,
by recognizing the nature of
governmental activity: "Thinkers
with as different a view of the
world as Sigmund Freud and
Mikhail Bakunin have been struck
by the fact that the role of the
state is to assert a monopoly on
crime.
"Individuals get medals,
promotions, and honors by
committing the same acts for the
state for which they would be
hanged or imprisoned in any other
circumstances," Bamet said.
Suppress Government Crime
One should not be resigned to
the fact that crime (aggression
against persons and property) is
committed under government
auspices. Instead, every effort
must be made to suppress such
crime and to abolish the regular
channels through which it is
perpetrated.
So while it is historically
accurate to say (as Wilson and
Ehrlichman have) that the
principle that a man's home is his
castle has been undermined over
the years by the officials of the
U.S. government, it is still right, in
all justice, to hold men to this
principle.
All possible opportunities
should be taken to enthrone
sound principles and to repel

governmental encroachments
upon such principles.
Before the American
Revolution, the English Whig
statesman William Pitt the Elder
said (in words that were quoted
by Sens. Herman E. Talmadge and
Sam. J. Ervin, Jr.):
"The poorest man may in his
cottage bid defiance to all the
force of the Crown. It may be
frail; its roof may shake; the wind
may blow through it; the storms
may enter, the rain may enter â€”
but the King of England cannot
enter; all his forces dare not cross
the threshold of the ruined
tenement!"
Extend Principle
The principle that a man's
home is his by right is at the core
of Pitt's famous words. It is a
principle which deserves to be
fully and logically extended to
keep out such men as truant
officers, tax collectors, and
officials trying to condemn land
for urban renewal or for roads.
When a murderer or a thief
uses his house as a hiding place,

then he (by his previous violation
of the rights of others) has
forfeited his right to be secure in
his person and property.
But for example, a person who
enters the home of another to
regain stolen goods shouldbbye y
liable for trespassing and damages
if it turns out that the suspected
man is innocent.
No Legitimate Right
Did Richard M. Nixon or his
assistants have a legitimate right
to burglarize the office of
Ellsberg's psychiatrist?
Furthermore, as Sen. Talmadge
asked Ehrlichman at one point,
"If the President could authorize
a covert break-in, and you do not
know where that power would be
limited, you do not think it could
include murder or other crimes
beyond covert break-ins, do
you?"
To justify their crimes Nixon's
staff have invoked the catch-all
phrase "national security." Past
crimes that have been justified in
the name of "national security"
have included imprisoning

Japanese-Americans in
concentration camps and seizing
steel mills.
Hoppe Column
In fact, Art Hoppe, the San
Francisco Chronicle's satirical
columnist, recently told a fable in
which a future President of the
Untited States, once he was
inaugurated, picked up the
Presidential seal and fatally
conked his wife over the head,
right over nation-wide television.
Of course, there was no way to
convict this President. Because of
all the privileges that had grown
up around the office, he was
immune. It was the perfect crime.

Bill Evers

In considering the crimes of
government officials we must not
limit ourselves to the words of the
Constitution, which may well
sanction their crimes. In terms of
the universal principles of justice,
the aerial bombardment of
innocent civilians is monstrous,
even if perhaps it is permitted
under the Constitution.
Popular pressure at home and
abroad is ultimately the only
effective weapon we have against
the arrogance of power that gives
us both burglaries and mass
murder.
