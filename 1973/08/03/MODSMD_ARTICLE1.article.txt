# 'CIA Had No Role In Watergate'

Special to the Daily
WASHINGTON—The Senate
Watergate Committee, in its sixth
week of testimony, quizzed former
CIA Director Richard Helms on
possible CIA involvement in the
break-in and cover-up yesterday, but
got an emphatic denial.
"The agency had nothing to do
with the Watergate break-in," Helms
declared. However, he admitted that
five of the burglars had worked for the
CIA, and that one—Eugenio
Martinez—was on retainer to the
agency at the time of the break-in.
Helms also said he refused outright
a request from former Presidential
counsel John W. Dean 111 to provide
bail money for the seven men captured
early on the morning of June 17,
1972, inside or near the headquarters
of the Democratic National

Committee.
The committee also heard this week
from former Presidential chief of staff
H.R. Haldeman and the deputy CIA
chief, Lt. Gen. Vernon Walters.
Widening Scandal
The scandal also grew wider with
the disclosures of 16
hither to- unknown White
House-ordered secret investigations,
and there were new indications that
President Nixon was involved in the
ITT scandal, stories of bizarre plots
against Sens. George McGovern
(D—S.D.) and Edward M. Kennedy
(D—Mass.), and questions of FBI and
CIA complicity in the break-in and
cover-up.
The ITT link was strongly suggested
by a 1972 White House memorandum
made public by the Senate committee
Wednesday. The memo warned of the
existence of other internal memos that

would "directly involve" President
Nixon in the favorable settlement of
an anti-trust suit against ITT and "at
this case at the President's doorstep."
Among the memos then-White
House special counsel Charles W.
Colson wrote to Haldeman was one
"alluding to discussions between the
President and the attorney general
[then John Mitchell] as 'we agreed
upon' the resolution of the ITT case."
Sheraton Pledge
Another memo, wrote Colson, set
forth an arrangement whereby an ITT
subsidiary, Sheraton Corp. of America,
had pledged $400,000 to help
underwrite the 1972 Republican
National Convention, then scheduled
to be held in San Diego. "A copy went
to Mitchell," Colson said.
Mitchell, in 1972 testimony before
the Senate Judiciary Committee, had
said the knew nothing of the $400,000
arrangement at the time of the ITT
settlement.
It was reported yesterday that the
Justice Department has decided to
seek indictments against Mitchell in
connection with the case.
Secret Probes
The Washington Post reported
Wednesday that secret investigations
ordered by senior White House aides in
the first Nixon administration
included probes into the lives of House
Speaker Carl Albert (D—Okla.), the
Smothers Brothers comedy team, and
the producers of an anti-Nixon movie,
according to reliable sources, former
White House secret investigator
Anthony T. Ulasewicz conducted most
of the 16 inquiries.
Ulasewicz also rented an apartment
in New York City which the sources
said was part of a plot to seduce
female friends of the late Mary Jo
Kopechne, who was killed in Sen.
Kennedy's automobile accident at
Chappaquiddick in July, 1969.
The purpose of the scheme was to
photograph the women in order to
blackmail them into revealing details
about Kopechne and the
circumstances surrounding the
Chappaquiddick incident.
The Post reported yesterday that
Haldeman, while White House chief of
staff earlier this year, proposed leaking

a story to the press that Sen. McGovern
was the father of an illegitimate child.
The purpose of the leak, Haldeman
suggested in a memo, would be to
foster the impression that President
Nixon had known about the story in
1972, but had refused to use it in his
campaign.
A George S. McGovern of Mitchell,
S.D. is named as the father of an
illegitimate child on birth records in
Fort Wayne, Ind., but both McGovern
and the child's mother deny that he
was the father.
