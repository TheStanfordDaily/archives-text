# Puccini Provides Laughs
## ‘Extropera’ Succeeds 
### DOUG SMITH 
Respectable turnouts and
exceptional performances marked
the auspicious debut of
Extropera,, billed as "a new
operatic venture by West Bay
Opera Association."
This English-language
production of Puccini's one-act
comic opera Gianni Schicchi was
designed to be taken on tour, and
the two Palo Alto performances
(July 27 and 28) were special
benefits for the Henry Holt
Memorial Scholarship Fund.
The evening began with a lieder
and aria recital by Kaye de Vries,
the 1973 winner of the Holt
Scholarship Award. Miss de Vries
chose to warm up with one of
Mozart's most difficult arias, Ach,
ich fuhl's, the celebrated aria of
Pamina from The Magic Flute.
It is difficult because its slow
tempo and long note values tax
the soprano's rhythmic sense, its
wide range explores her whole
spectrum of pitch and color, and
its chromaticism makes severe
demands on accuracy of
intonation. Above and beyond
this, it requires an intelligent and
sensitive interpretation.
Technical Proficiency
De Vries met all of the
technical demands admirably, and
it was apparent that she will need
only a few years of seasoning
before her musical expression is as
fine as that of any professional
operatic soprano alive.
Four lieder of Brahms, Opus
105, were next on the program.
Although she acquitted herself
well, her interpretation and vocal
color proved not as well suited for
Brahms as for the Mozart or for
the French and Italian arias which
followed.
The Aria de Lia from
Debussy's L'Enfant Prodigue was
appropriately lush, with really
beautiful singing in high
pianissimo passages. However
there began to be a tendency to
grate slightly on sustained forte
notes in the high register, which
can only partially be excused by
the small auditorium.
Soprano's Assets
De Vries concluded with two
Puccini arias, the Canzona di
Doretta from La Rondine and Un
Bel Di from Butterfly. Her most
convincing performance of the
evening was in the canzona, where
she exhibited a real affinity for
the style and a captivating stage
presence.
The evening continued with a
barrel of laughs by Puccini. Rich
old Buoso Donati has died, and
his relatives are gathered in his
bedroom to mourn. Their mock
mourning turns to real grief when
they discover that he left
everything to a monastery.
Young Rinuccio thereupon
sends for his girlfriend's father,
Gianni Schicchi, who is well
known as the cleverest man in
Florence. Gianni dresses up as
Buoso, sends for a lawyer and
dictates a new will, leaving the
greater portion of Buoso's wealth
to himself.
Talented Vultures
The whole pack of vultures

(i.e. relatives) was delicious as
they wept crocodile tears,
snapped at each other, connived,
and ultimately outsmarted
themselves. Anthony Cuevas, who
as Betto was also one of the birds
of prey, did a fine job of stage
directing.
Lucy Fogelman as Lauretta,
Gianni's daughter, outsang her
beau Rinuccio, the tenor William
Coburn, who was tense in his high
register. Will Connolly as Gianni
Schicchi was perfectly
convincing in both singing and
acting capacities, especially in the
hilarious dictation of the will.
The set was simple (designed to
be easily portable), but effective.
The costumes were colorful and
contributed a great deal to calling
up the image of thirteenth
century Florence.
Much credit must go to musical
director Ramona Rockway, who
prepared a smooth production
and cast roles appropriately. In
addition, she provided fine
accompaniment at the piano,
assisted by a timpanist and
clarinetist.

RETURNS TO STANFORD—Joan Baez will sing at Stanford for the
first time in two years when she returns to the campus on September
30 for a Registration Week concert in Frost Amphitheater. Her
recently released album "Where Are You Now My Son?" contains a
23-minute ballad-description of the bombing she observed last
December in Hanoi.
