# Harpsichordist Interprets Scarlatti's Iberian Milieu
## 
### BRUCE LAMOTT 
BERKELEY—"Scarlatti and His Iberian Milieu," a
harpsichord recital by Laurette Goldberg on Friday,
July 27, put chamber music in its place.
1750 Arch, the address and name of the locale,
can best be described as a "concert chamber," an
intimate setting (capacity: 50) in the living room of
an old Spanish-style home with a splendid view of
the Bay.
Such surroundings well suit the harpsichord,
which is so often relegated to vacuous concert halls
designed for symphony orchestras, or, as in the case
of Dinkelspiel, suited to who-knows-what.
It is also well-suited to a performer like
Goldberg, who shared her ideas about the music in
informative and personable comments between
sections of the program.
Well-Chosen Program
Sonatas by Seixas (1704-42), a little-known
student of Domenico Scarlatti opened the program,
though the listener could scarcely distinguish them
from the works of his mentor.
A fanfare-motive disguised the minuet of Sonata
No. 42, while the D Major Sonata No. 19 is a piece
croisee based on a simple harmonic structure.
Chopinesque elements in the Sonata No. 65 in A
minor were perhaps more attributable to the
rhapsodic interpretation than to the composer.
A sampling of the numerous sonatas by
Domenico Scarlatti comprised most of the recital,
with particular emphasis on those of markedly
Spanish character.
In her remarks, including a demonstration on the

castanets, Goldberg demonstrated a keen
enthusiasm for Spanish culture and concern with
the variegated rhythms and affects of the
compositions.
However, in the performance, this appreciation
was overtaken by lack of control in the faster
sonatas, and a motoric drive which passed over
much of the composer's audacity and surprise.
Goldberg s registrations of the Dowd double
harpsichord were tastefully chosen. However,
exaggerated articulation in the Seix&s No. 65 and
Scarlatti K. 239 resulted in an annoying, toneless
"chirp" by not allowing the instrument to resonate
properly.
Among the four Soler Sonatas which closed the
program, M. 1 in C minor was played brilliantly but
without internal cohesion, and in M.2, excessive
rubato countered the movement of the vocal
melodic line.
Distinctive Miniatures
A program such as this is a gallery of
miniatures—short, microcosmic pieces of highly
individual character presented singly or in pairs.
As a miniature, each requires its own frame of
silence to delineate its characterization and separate
it from companion works. Persistent music-shifting,
page-turning, and seeming preoccupation with the
upcoming pieces before the preceding one had
settled distracted the listener from the well-chosen
program.
1750 Arch features an ongoing series of local
artists in chamber music, and their calendar is well
worth watching in the upcoming fall season.
