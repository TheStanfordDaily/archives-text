# Joan Baez Returns To Stanford
## 
### 
Folksinger Joan Baez will perform a Sunday
afternoon concert in Frost Amphitheater on
September 30, ASSU Special Events manager
Dan Shure announced yesterday.
Although she visited Stanford last January to
speak about herexperiences during eleven days of
intensive bombing in Hanoi, Baez has not sung at
Stanford in over two years. In a sense, her return
is something of a homecoming.
Baez's father was a professor here, and she
learned about guitar from Emeritus Physics Prof.
Paul H. Kirkpatrick. She also attended Palo Alto
High School where she is remembered by her
former principal as an independent individual
who refused to go along with formalities.

Today, after her marriage to and divorce from
former ASSU president David Harris, and in the
midst of a successful music career, Baez
continues to defy conventions.
Despite the high admission prices commanded
by concert artists in the Bay Area, Baez insists on
low ticket prices for her concerts.
Repairs are being made at Frost in
anticipation of the Registration Week concert.
And Shure theorizes that Baez's pacifistic
attitude will prevent an outbreak of violence
similar to the disruption of last year's Miles Davis
concert.
Tickets for the concert will be available for
$2.50 after September 4.
