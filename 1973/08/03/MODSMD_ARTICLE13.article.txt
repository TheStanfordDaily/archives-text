# '40 Carats' Revives Trite Romantic Plot
## 
### JON R. KENNEDY 
Columbia Pictures' 40 Carats,
seems likely to be one of this
year's cinema breakthroughs.
It has elements of
newness—something very hard to
achieve these days (as opposed to
the days of The Graduate and
Easy Rider a few years ago). And it
is reminiscent of similar qualities
in The Heartbreak Kid and
Scarecrow, both of which tried
desperately to come up with
something fresh but didn't quite
make it.
Just what is it about 40 Carats'?
It isn't the actors—all of these are
big names reverting back to the
star system of an earlier
Hollywood.
It's not the storyline, a rather
thin comedy which is excessively
trite on occasions. The plot is very
predictable in a boy-meets-girl,
they-fall-in-love, she-begins-to
doubt, he-goes-a way,
she-chases-him kind of way. The
only complications arise from her
being 40 to his being 22.
Just Plain Entertainment
It's a romance that presents
solid entertainment as a main
attraction to the masses—there are
no breakthroughs for any kind of
explicitness, there Is no social
statement, the characters are all at
least as well-adjusted as average
New Yorkers could be and there's
not a single reference to
psychoanalysis or any of its
latter-day substitutes (maybe
that's the breakthrough).
If anything, the film
participates in the Nixon-era
decadence which is marked most
of all by the lack of
breakthroughs in any
medium—politically, for example,
Greece is the setting for the film's
idyllic foreign sequences while
Moscow is also alluded to with
deference.
What sets 40 Carats apart from
those others (Heartbreak Kid,
Scarecrow, etc.) may be that the
other films depended on their
unusual story angle to make them
different, whereas 40 Carats takes
a well-worn angle, almost reduces
it to TV comedy level, and then
adds freshness to the dialogue and
the devices.
What would otherwise be
another rehash of An Affair to
Remember becomes a delightful
new look at a classic Hollywood
theme, the second time-around
romance.
Tour de Force Romance
This romance is an
improvement over Love Story,
Summer of '42, Ryan's Daughter,
and most of the other romances
of recent years which have one
common denominator: triteness.
40 Carats is to romance what
What's Up Doc? is to classic
comedy, a tour de force
establishing new perimeters for
the genre; in any history of

cinema romances it is likely to be
one of the watersheds, an example
of a new departure for an old, old
story form, a "how to do it" for
the medium.
40 Carats is best for its
understatement: so many of the
lines are just what you would say,
or wish you had the wit to say, in
those same all-too-familiar
circumstances.
Contemporary Characters
It is "modern" in its free use of
brand names: Peter (the
handsome young rake, played by
Edward Albert, who puts the
make on a woman nearly twice his
age—it's a turn-around on the Mrs.
Robinson theme) rides around
Greece on a Honda 500 and a
whole Pan Am TV commercial is
used to make Ann (Liv Ullman)
wish she were back there.
Ann's 17-year-old daughter is
level-headed and mature, but she's
out all night with boys whose last
names she doesn't know ("it
wasn't a formal get-together").
She plays pool so well that Peter
says she's not really a girl but Paul
Newman in disguise.
Her father, who still gets along
amicably with her mother and his
former wife, Ann, is played by
Gene Kelly as an immature but
loveable ne'er-do-well cabaret and
TV comedian.
Ann's mother is a
scene-stealing Auntie Mame type
not overly concerned about
everyone's respectability and bank
accounts. She also turns out to be
Gene Kelly's dancing partner in
the inevitable but well-placed
dance floor scene.
Meaningless Genre
Perhaps romance in general
depicts life untruthfully. It
attempts a synthesis of the
classical religious mystery play in
which everything had universal
significance, and modern nihilistic
plays which say that nothing has
meaning. The romance "admits,"

on the nihilistic side, that nothing
has ultimate meaning, but says
that the intermediate meaning is
good enough, worth living for and
laughing about.
Thus the best romance is the
most entertaining show, the one
which best relieves the tension of
the audience, drawing it away
from reality. To this reviewer,
something meant mainly to divert
attention from the anxiety of life
cannot at the same time be art.
And if cinema fails as art, it
fails in its highest calling, its
normative function. On the other
hand, art itself is notstructured
normatively to force a
confrontation with reality. If art

has a single norm or "highest
calling" it is probably that of
celebrating; celebrating life, love,
creation, discovery.
Limited Celebration
If romance says that life is not
worth celebrating and then
proceeds to celebrate it or one of
its aspects anyway, it is not an art
form but a form of prostitution.
Therefore romance has a very
limited usefulness and generally
tends, in my opinion, to be a
waste of time.
40 Carats is an exception only
to the extent that it is worth
discussing as a classic example of
its form.
Early in the dialogue Ann tells

Peter, when he asks, "And what
do you believe?" that "I believe in
a good night's sleep." In other
words, I believe in whatever
appeals to me at the moment (a
point proven a few moments later
by her giving up "a good night's
sleep" to roll around with Peter in
his sleeping bag. This
valuelessness, which serious
writers would treat as a tragedy, is
repeated over and over again
throughout the play. Romance is
truly sickening if you see 40
Carats as a product of our age and
look for more than a happy
ending followed by "they lived
happily ever after." Because you
know they didn't. Nobody does.
