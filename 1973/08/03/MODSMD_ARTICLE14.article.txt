# 'Odd Bodkinsâ€™ Comic Strip Musical Provides Fine Outdoor Entertainment
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
Odd Bodkins, a "musical
comic" adapted from the comic
strip of the same name, finishes its
run at the Lucie Stern
Community Center in Palo Alto
with performances tonight and
tomorrow.
The Workshop of Palo Alto
production is based on the book
Hear the Sound of My Feet
Walking Drown the Sound of My
Voice Talking, by Dan O'Neill.
Old-timers will remember the
"Odd Bodkins" comic strip,

which formerly appeared in the
Chronicle in the space now
occupied by "Doonesbury." In its
last few months, the strip was
cancelled, and subsequently
reinstated by popular acclaim. It
then grew progressively weirder
before vanishing entirely.
The cast of characters is mostly
made up of veterans of the strip:
Hugh, a human of sorts; Fred, the
fearless Scorpio bird; the
Bat-Winged Hamburger Snatcher;
Sam, the 100 Percent American
Dog, and others.
Well-Utilized Setting
The show opened last weekend
to full houses both Friday and
Saturday nights. The Fire Circle
Theatre, the site of the outdoor
production, consists of a circular
pit with a platform in the center
and 180-degree seating. And the
setting is effectively used.
Interaction with the audience
is stressed in director Robert
Kelley's staging, but fortunately is
not overdone.

The original score by Michael
Silversher and Gary Levinson and
the choreography of Michael
Brown take the show out of the
two-dimensional world of the
comic strip. The songs vary from
so-so to quite effective, and
sample such a variety of styles
that they are occasionally
distracting.
Varied Choreography
The choreography varies
accordingly, and indues a tap
number, a polka, and a bunny
hop. Each variation is a timely
tie-in to the story line.
Both the singing and dancing
performances are far from perfect,
but the enthusiasm of the
production fairly makes up for
any deficiency. The overall effect
of the play is not significantly
hurt by musical flaws deriving
strength from the staging and
pacing of the action.
The major strength of the
show, however, is the "script,"
the original text by O'Neill. Like
his comic strip, the story line may
involve several actions,
conversations, or soliloquies at

once, contacting one another just
often enough to make sense or
intelligible nonsense.
Multi-Level Journey
The level of the play wanders,
like Hugh and Fred, from the
whimsical to the satirical to the
deeply philosophical. The acting is
at its finest when they meet a man
obsessed with violence,
played by John Berger.
In an extended speech, the
man takes Hugh and Fred along
on his personal journey through
violence and despair and
eventually to hope. His reference
to himself as a member of the
"war-baby generation" is clearly
O'Neill speaking.
Odd Bodkins is an enjoyable
show which has plenty to offer,
both to devotees of the comic
strip and to those who enjoy
original musical comedy. It's not
about to become another Hair,
but it is still worth seeing.
Shows are tonight and
Saturday, at 8:45 p.m. in the
Community Center's Fire Circle
Theatre, at Melville and
Middlefield in Palo Alto.
