# Fine Fifties Revival
## Butch Whacks Generates Nostalgia 
### BRADLEY DICKINSON 
SUNNYVALE—Bands don't usually pass out
scorecards, but then bands don't usually have as
many members as a football team. Such is the case
with Butch Whacks and the Glass Packs.
During the course of their well-choreographed
performance at the Odyssey Room last Monday,
most of their individual personalities were
illuminated. Particularly likable were Moose (Bob
Sallot), Lance (Gary Murphy), Steady Eddie (Wally
Quinn) and, of course, Butch (Jerry Murphy), who
provided most of the vocal work.
Julio Lopez got a bit carried away with his
fixation on voluptuous females, but most of the
time, Lance and Moose provided lively
entertainment with their between-number patter.
But the audience was left to guess what Tux
(John Buick) did besides click his fingers.
Instrumentally, Butch, Mike Haggerty, Bruce
Lopez, Jeff Colino, Carl Young and Dan Ritzo
provided a pretty decent backup for Butch's vocals.
It was a fine evening for fifties freaks. It was

exhausting just to watch the dancing and prancing
of the band.
Such classics as "Duke of Earl" and "Blue
Moon" can currently be labelled as overdone, but
overuse should not detract from the band's fine
performances of those moldy oldies and others,
including "Sea Cruise," "Oh Donna" and "Jailhouse
Rock."
But this reviewer left Butch Whacks and the
Glass Packs with the feeling that too many people
are taking nostalgia seriously.
Although the lack of spontaneity might be
attributed to the lethargic Monday-evening
Sunnyvale crowd, there was a conspicuous absence
of hand-clapping or dancing in the Odyssey Room.
To some, nostalgia means joyfully retracing one's
roots, but others are often too willing to be merely
spectators.
Because Butch Whacks and the Glass Packs is a
Bay Area-based group, they often appear in local
clubs. Keep your eyes open for them if you're in the
mood for a little nostalgia.
