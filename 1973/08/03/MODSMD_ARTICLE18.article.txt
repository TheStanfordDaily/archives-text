# ‘The Devil In Miss Jones' Reveals What Hard-Core Porn Is All About
## 
### GEORGE POWELL 
Pity Miss Jones. She lived her
entire life not knowing the joys of
regular, oral or anal sex, and was
so dispondent that she committed
suicide in a bathtub full of warm
water by slashing her wrists with a
razor blade.
But that's just the start of the
hard-core sex film, The Devil in
Miss Jones. (The"The" is
optional.)
Since suicide is an
unforgiveable sin, she is consigned
to hell. However the devil is
unprepared to accept her
immediately, so Miss Jones gets
some time to experience a desire
for lust (one of the seven deadly
sins).
Miss Jones, as portrayed by
Georgianna Spevlin, seems, after
brief instruction, to be able to
climax sexually with anything
that has a remotely similar shape
to a penis, whether it's placed in
her mouth, vagina or anus.

And that, gentle readers, is the
basic plot of the movie, which
encloses almost all of the
standard hard-core action.
In case anyone is unaware of
the distinction between hard and
soft-core sex movies, the sex act or
acts are all simulated in soft-core
(like the anal sex scene in Imsl
Tango in Paris).
In hard core, actual
penetration is shown, as well as
what is known in the trade as "the
cum shot."
Exaggerated Sex Acts
This digression is to let people
who have never seen a hard-core
film know exactly what they will
be getting into.
Judging from the audience
response at Devil m Miss Jones,
viewers reacted most strongly to
the suicide, which was a quite
graphic simulation of a wrist
slashing, and to the exaggerated
way Miss Spevlin literally
worshiped male semen.
In fact, the sex act is highly
exaggerated in all hard-core films,
and is, of course, the center of
attention. But lately there has
been a trend to words, more
substantial plot and dialogue, as
well as better technical quality in
the film itself.
Cinematic Improvements
For these reasons, current
hard-core films are of higher
quality than the kind that used to
be shown at all-male clubs and
bachelor parties years ago.
The present-day popularity (or
notoriety) of hard-core films has

been aided further by attempts
across the country to suppress the
most reknowned hard-core movie,
Deep Throat. In many respects,
Devil in Miss Jones, is superior,
from a strictly cinematic
standpoint, as well as on the
erotic level.
In fact, the first
during which Miss Jones commits
suicide and meets her devilish
erotic teacher, is highly-charged
and does not drag at all.
Pornographic Smorgasbord
But later in the film, seeing
Miss Jones masturbate herself
with a banana and letting a snake
crawl in her mouth is not very
interesting, or even lustful. If lust
is indeed a sin, it can be
experienced in more rewarding
ways than letting a snake in one's
mouth.
It's precisely at this point that
the movie gets repetitious, silly
and also rather disjointed (no pun
intended). After nearly another
half-hour of a smorgasbord of
lust, with Miss Jones using every
opening in her body except
nostrils and ears to engage in
intercourse, fellatio and

auto-eroticism, she is called to her
reward, as it were.
Hell for the now sexually
promiscuous Miss Jones is to be
locked for eternity in a room with
a man who has no interest at all in
any kind of sex.
The only reward for an
audience in this cinematic exercise
in sex and retribution is to see
that a hard core film can be the
technical equal of an average
movie. But an attempt to get any
serious cinema buff to say that
this film is even remotely
equivalent to Last Tango in Paris
is absurd.
In much of the U.S., though,
an X-rating means a "dirty"
movie, and there are cities where
neither Last Tango In Paris or The
Devil In Miss Jones can be seen by
adults, and that's an even greater
absurdity.
But such is not the case in Palo
Alto, so The Devil In Miss Jones
can continue to satisfy local adult
curiosity about what goes on in
hard-core films. With a simplistic
plot and a minimum of dialogue,
there is little reason besides
curiosity for seeing this film.
