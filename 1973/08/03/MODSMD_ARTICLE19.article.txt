House Okays Pipeline Construction
WASHINGTON—The House of Representatives late last
night passed a bill authorizing construction of the
trans-Alaska oil pipeline. The vote was 356 to 60.
The measure authorizes the Department of the Interior
to award construction permits and forbids court challenges
of the pipeline's environmental impact.
The House bill will be compromised with the Senate's
version after the 30-dcy Congressional recess.
The Senate yesterday passed a bill over President
Nixon's threatened veto increasing the minimum wage t<
$2.20 per hour.
Congressmen Attack Beef Freeze
WASHINGTON—The beef shortage continued yesterday
as congressmen attacked President Nixon's freeze on beef
prices as "stupid," "naive" and "misbegotten."
The Senate voted to lift the freeze yesterday, but the
House Rules Committee put off at least until September
taking action on measures to lift the price restrictions on
beef.
House Democrats argued for more time to study the
effects of any bills to roll the freeze back, while
Republicans pleased that immediate action was necessary.
Republicans cautioned the President that if the freeze
is allowed to continue, it will lead to an aggravated
nationwide shortage of beef, a black market, and
skyrocketing meat prices when the freeze expires Sept.
12.
In Sacramento, Gov. Ronald Reagan added his name
to the list of prominent Republicans speaking out against
the freeze.
Several grocery stores in the Chicago metropolitan area
rationed meat to their customers and many others
predicted supplies will be exhausted well before the
expiration date.
Beef processors indicate that farmers' prices are now
too high for them to buy meat and sell it at a profit under
ceiling prices. A few packing houses have closed until the
freeze ends.
However, Cost of Living Council director John Dunlop
stated he would not support lifting the price restrictions
until the deadline date.
Chavez Asks Public To Till Jails'
FRESNO—United Farm Workers (UFW) leader Cesar
Chavez, with State Sen. George Moscone (D—San
Francisco) at his side, told a cheering crowd yesterday he
is inviting 10,000 to come to the Central Valley and fill
the jails.
Chavez promised the cheering crowd that striking and
picketing against grape growers in the valley will continue
until "the illegal injunctions are stopped." Chavez referred
to a court order limiting strike activities and the number
of pickets.
More than 3000 have been arrested here in recent
weeks and yesterday 150 more pickets were locked up
and charged with failure to disperse.
Moscone told the crowd he fully supports Chavez,
stating, "Until the farm workers in this state are accorded
first-class treatment I'll be on the firing line with Chavez."
Moscone also compared the farm workers' struggle to
the civil rights movement in the South.
State Food and Agricultural Director C.B. Christensen
stated yesterday that the National Guard has been alerted

for possible duty to cope with any additional violence
involving UFW pickets in the San Joaquin Valley.
Local officials alerted the Guard Wednesday night after
violent clashes between pickets and Kern County Sheriff's
deputies near Alvin, Christensen said. However, a Guard
spokesman denied the Guard had been notified.
Up To 30 Oklahoma Convicts Missing
McALESTER, Okla.—Officials at Oklahoma State Prison
here yesterday conducted a prison-wide head count of
prisoners which revealed that as many as 30 convicts are
missing.
Four inmates are known to have been killed in the
rebellion that rocked the prison last week.
A spokesman for Oklahoma Gov. David Hall said he is
positive none of the 30 men missing have escaped. News
aide Ed Hardy said yesterday that he is not sure whether
the missing prisoners are lying dead in the rubble of the
prison or whether they were passed over in the count.
Hardy blamed the discrepancy on the transfer of some
of the 1700 inmates to other prisons for security reasons.
One of the hostages held when the rioting broke out
last Friday, Deputy Warden Sam Johnson, said he had not
found any bodies unaccounted for when he searched the
wreckage and empty cellblocks.
Seven Die In New Jersey Flood
NORTH PLAINFIELD, N.J.—At least seven persons were

2000 people were in the building on this resort island and
firemen indicated that the death toll may climb.
About 30 of the injured are in critical condition.
Explosion Rocks Argentine Barracks
BUENOS AIRES—At least five persons died yesterday

Explosion Rocks Argentine Barracks
BUENOS AIRES—At least five persons died yesterday
when an explosion hit a military barracks in Azul, 180
miles south of here.
The Argentine army reported that 14 were injured and
one is missing after a blow torch ignited leaking natural
gas.
Today's Weather

the coast during the night and early mornings, highs in the
60s along the coast, 70s inland. Lows in the 50s.
House Okays Pipeline Construction
WASHINGTON—The House of Representatives late last
night passed a bill authorizing construction of the
trans-Alaska oil pipeline. The vote was 356 to 60.
The measure authorizes the Department of the Interior
to award construction permits and forbids court challenges
of the pipeline's environmental impact.
The House bill will be compromised with the Senate's
version after the 30-dcy Congressional recess.
The Senate yesterday passed a bill over President
Nixon's threatened veto increasing the minimum wage t<
$2.20 per hour.
Congressmen Attack Beef Freeze
WASHINGTON—The beef shortage continued yesterday
as congressmen attacked President Nixon's freeze on beef
prices as "stupid," "naive" and "misbegotten."
The Senate voted to lift the freeze yesterday, but the
House Rules Committee put off at least until September
taking action on measures to lift the price restrictions on
beef.
House Democrats argued for more time to study the
effects of any bills to roll the freeze back, while
Republicans pleased that immediate action was necessary.
Republicans cautioned the President that if the freeze
is allowed to continue, it will lead to an aggravated
nationwide shortage of beef, a black market, and
skyrocketing meat prices when the freeze expires Sept.
12.
In Sacramento, Gov. Ronald Reagan added his name
to the list of prominent Republicans speaking out against
the freeze.
Several grocery stores in the Chicago metropolitan area
rationed meat to their customers and many others
predicted supplies will be exhausted well before the
expiration date.
Beef processors indicate that farmers' prices are now
too high for them to buy meat and sell it at a profit under
ceiling prices. A few packing houses have closed until the
freeze ends.
However, Cost of Living Council director John Dunlop
stated he would not support lifting the price restrictions
until the deadline date.
Chavez Asks Public To Till Jails'
FRESNO—United Farm Workers (UFW) leader Cesar
Chavez, with State Sen. George Moscone (D—San
Francisco) at his side, told a cheering crowd yesterday he
is inviting 10,000 to come to the Central Valley and fill
the jails.
Chavez promised the cheering crowd that striking and
picketing against grape growers in the valley will continue
until "the illegal injunctions are stopped." Chavez referred
to a court order limiting strike activities and the number
of pickets.
More than 3000 have been arrested here in recent
weeks and yesterday 150 more pickets were locked up
and charged with failure to disperse.
Moscone told the crowd he fully supports Chavez,
stating, "Until the farm workers in this state are accorded
first-class treatment I'll be on the firing line with Chavez."
Moscone also compared the farm workers' struggle to
the civil rights movement in the South.
State Food and Agricultural Director C.B. Christensen
stated yesterday that the National Guard has been alerted

for possible duty to cope with any additional violence
involving UFW pickets in the San Joaquin Valley.
Local officials alerted the Guard Wednesday night after
violent clashes between pickets and Kern County Sheriff's
deputies near Alvin, Christensen said. However, a Guard
spokesman denied the Guard had been notified.
Up To 30 Oklahoma Convicts Missing
McALESTER, Okla.—Officials at Oklahoma State Prison
here yesterday conducted a prison-wide head count of
prisoners which revealed that as many as 30 convicts are
missing.
Four inmates are known to have been killed in the
rebellion that rocked the prison last week.
A spokesman for Oklahoma Gov. David Hall said he is
positive none of the 30 men missing have escaped. News
aide Ed Hardy said yesterday that he is not sure whether
the missing prisoners are lying dead in the rubble of the
prison or whether they were passed over in the count.
Hardy blamed the discrepancy on the transfer of some
of the 1700 inmates to other prisons for security reasons.
One of the hostages held when the rioting broke out
last Friday, Deputy Warden Sam Johnson, said he had not
found any bodies unaccounted for when he searched the
wreckage and empty cellblocks.

here yesterday conducted a prison-wide head count of
prisoners which revealed that as many as 30 convicts are
missing.
Four inmates are known to have been killed in the
rebellion that rocked the prison last week.
A spokesman for Oklahoma Gov. David Hall said he is
positive none of the 30 men missing have escaped. News
aide Ed Hardy said yesterday that he is not sure whether
the missing prisoners are lying dead in the rubble of the
prison or whether they were passed over in the count.
Hardy blamed the discrepancy on the transfer of some
of the 1700 inmates to other prisons for security reasons.
One of the hostages held when the rioting broke out
last Friday, Deputy Warden Sam Johnson, said he had not
found any bodies unaccounted for when he searched the
wreckage and empty cellblocks.
Seven Die In New Jersey Flood
NORTH PLAINFIELD, N.J.—At least seven persons were
killed yesterday when flood waters hit northern New
Jersey.
Water rose to 1$ feet in some areas and at least seven
communities declared a state of emergency as several
hundred people were evacuated.
Telephone lines were downed as the heavy rains
continued to pound the area, and electricity was shut off
to prevent electrocutions of residents.
Gainesville-Eight Trial Begins
GAINESVILLE, Fla.—A seven-woman, five-man jury was
empaneled yesterday to begin the trial of the
"Gainesville-Eight." The eight defendants are charged
with conspiracy to use guerrilla tactics to disrupt the 1972
Republican convention in Miami Beach.
England Blaze Kills At Least 30
DOUGLAS, Isle of Main, England—A blaze tore through a
seven-story entertainment complex yesterday killing at
least 30 and injuring more than 80.

emergency exits, police and witnesses said. Approximately
2000 people were in the building on this resort island and
firemen indicated that the death toll may climb.
About 30 of the injured are in critical condition.
Explosion Rocks Argentine Barracks
BUENOS AIRES—At least five persons died yesterday
when an explosion hit a military barracks in Azul, 180
miles south of here.
The Argentine army reported that 14 were injured and
one is missing after a blow torch ignited leaking natural
gas.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow with fog and low clouds along
the coast during the night and early mornings, highs in the
60s along the coast, 70s inland. Lows in the 50s.
House Okays Pipeline Construction
WASHINGTON—The House of Representatives late last
night passed a bill authorizing construction of the
trans-Alaska oil pipeline. The vote was 356 to 60.
The measure authorizes the Department of the Interior
to award construction permits and forbids court challenges
of the pipeline's environmental impact.
The House bill will be compromised with the Senate's
version after the 30-dcy Congressional recess.
The Senate yesterday passed a bill over President
Nixon's threatened veto increasing the minimum wage t<
$2.20 per hour.
Congressmen Attack Beef Freeze
WASHINGTON—The beef shortage continued yesterday
as congressmen attacked President Nixon's freeze on beef
prices as "stupid," "naive" and "misbegotten."
The Senate voted to lift the freeze yesterday, but the
House Rules Committee put off at least until September
taking action on measures to lift the price restrictions on
beef.
House Democrats argued for more time to study the
effects of any bills to roll the freeze back, while
Republicans pleased that immediate action was necessary.
Republicans cautioned the President that if the freeze
is allowed to continue, it will lead to an aggravated
nationwide shortage of beef, a black market, and
skyrocketing meat prices when the freeze expires Sept.
12.
In Sacramento, Gov. Ronald Reagan added his name
to the list of prominent Republicans speaking out against
the freeze.
Several grocery stores in the Chicago metropolitan area
rationed meat to their customers and many others
predicted supplies will be exhausted well before the
expiration date.
Beef processors indicate that farmers' prices are now
too high for them to buy meat and sell it at a profit under
ceiling prices. A few packing houses have closed until the
freeze ends.
However, Cost of Living Council director John Dunlop
stated he would not support lifting the price restrictions
until the deadline date.
Chavez Asks Public To Till Jails'
FRESNO—United Farm Workers (UFW) leader Cesar
Chavez, with State Sen. George Moscone (D—San
Francisco) at his side, told a cheering crowd yesterday he
is inviting 10,000 to come to the Central Valley and fill
the jails.
Chavez promised the cheering crowd that striking and
picketing against grape growers in the valley will continue
until "the illegal injunctions are stopped." Chavez referred
to a court order limiting strike activities and the number
of pickets.
More than 3000 have been arrested here in recent
weeks and yesterday 150 more pickets were locked up
and charged with failure to disperse.
Moscone told the crowd he fully supports Chavez,
stating, "Until the farm workers in this state are accorded
first-class treatment I'll be on the firing line with Chavez."
Moscone also compared the farm workers' struggle to
the civil rights movement in the South.
State Food and Agricultural Director C.B. Christensen
stated yesterday that the National Guard has been alerted

for possible duty to cope with any additional violence
involving UFW pickets in the San Joaquin Valley.
Local officials alerted the Guard Wednesday night after
violent clashes between pickets and Kern County Sheriff's
deputies near Alvin, Christensen said. However, a Guard
spokesman denied the Guard had been notified.
