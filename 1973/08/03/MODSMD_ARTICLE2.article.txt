# KZSU Says Stereo Could Be Imminent
## 
### SCOTT FIELDS 
After 16 months of promises and
anticipation, KZSU may finally begin
broadcasting in stereo within 10 days,
according to Station Manager Lloyd
Snook.
The station has broadcast in stereo
before, but only late at night. "We had
to make sure that our new equipment
worked before our warranty ran out,"
Snook said.
However, KZSU could not continue
to broadcast in this manner for legal
reasons. The Federal Communications
Commission requires that all stereo
statins use a Volumax, a machine
which keeps the output level within
the proper range.
At first, the station attempted to
buy a used Volumax, but, finding this
impossible, decided to purchase a new
machineat a cost of about $1600.
Delivery on the new equipment is
scheduled for next Friday. However,
Snook is not positive that the machine
will arrive, and even if it does, it will
take several days to convert to stereo.
"The reason why I'm not too

optimistic is because the same guy
[who is delivering the new VolumaxJ
has been telling us the last three
months that he would find us a used
Volumax, but he kept saying 'Give me
another week.' I'll believe it when I see
the thing in my hot little hands."
At the same time that KZSU is
attempting to convert to slereo, they
are also preparing for an FCC battle
with KFJC, the Foothill College
campus station.
KZSU requested a power increse
from 10 to 3000 watts in June, 1972.
This request was turned down, and the
station decided to try again with a
smaller request. They submitted a new
one last January for an increase to 500
watts.
However, KFJC has filed an
objection to the KZSU request,
suggesting that the increase would
interfere with their broadcasts in parts
of Palo Alto.
Most educational stations, including
KFJC and KZSU are licensed by the
FCC to operate at 10 watts and 100
feet height above average terrain
