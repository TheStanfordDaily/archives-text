# City Employees Might Vote On Strike Proposal Tonight
## 
### 
About 310 Palo Alto city
employees may vote tonight on
whether or not to strike.
The workers, members of Service
Employees International Union
(SEIU), AFL-CIO, local 715 A, have
received SEIU authorization for a
strike, and will hold a general
membership meeting tonight where a
strike vote looms as the major topic on
the agenda.
Although a press blackout is in
effect, memorandums distributed by
both sides Wednesday show that the
city and the employees are currently
about $20 per month apart in what is
basically a salary dispute.
The city is offering a $45 per
month wage hike for all employees
except clerical workers, who would

receive a $35 increase. The union is
asking for a $65 across-the-board raise.
State mediator Joseph Anderson
has been working to schedule another
bargaining session between the two
groups today in a last-minute effort to
avert a strike by all Palo Alto
employees except police, firemen, and
management,
No Meetings
The two sides broke off
negotiations for the second time last
Friday, and have not met this week.
However, prospects for a quick
settlement of the dispute, which
threatens to cripple the city,
brightened somewhat yesterday when
the city announced it was ready to
submit to binding arbitration to settle
all future disputes over compensation.
SEIU local 715 A represents some
450 employees; however, only 310 of
these are paid union members. It is not
now known how many of the
remaining 140 workers would
continue on their jobs in the event of a
strike.
City Preparations
The Palo Alto Times reported
yesterday that city preparations in the
event of a strike include using the 140
workers, in addition to about 100
"management" people, to perform the
work normally done by the union
members.
Most of the union members work in
the utilities, maintenance, and work
crew areas.

Also, according to management,
their offer, which calls for an average
pay hike of five percent, includes
fringe benefits which brings the total
package to an eight percent boost.
The reason the city gives for
offering clerical workers a lower pay
raise than other workers is that these
workers are already comparatively
much better paid than in other Bay
Area communities.
The union memorandum disagreed,
charging that management broke off
talks last Friday after only "a few
hours" of discussion on money-related
issues.

About 310 Palo Alto city
employees may vote tonight on
whether or not to strike.
The workers, members of Service
Employees International Union
(SEIU), AFL-CIO, local 715 A, have
received SEIU authorization for a
strike, and will hold a general
membership meeting tonight where a
strike vote looms as the major topic on
the agenda.
Although a press blackout is in
effect, memorandums distributed by
both sides Wednesday show that the
city and the employees are currently
about $20 per month apart in what is
basically a salary dispute.
The city is offering a $45 per
month wage hike for all employees
except clerical workers, who would

receive a $35 increase. The union is
asking for a $65 across-the-board raise.
State mediator Joseph Anderson
has been working to schedule another
bargaining session between the two
groups today in a last-minute effort to
avert a strike by all Palo Alto
employees except police, firemen, and
management,
No Meetings
The two sides broke off
negotiations for the second time last
Friday, and have not met this week.
However, prospects for a quick
settlement of the dispute, which
threatens to cripple the city,
brightened somewhat yesterday when
the city announced it was ready to
submit to binding arbitration to settle
all future disputes over compensation.
SEIU local 715 A represents some
450 employees; however, only 310 of
these are paid union members. It is not
now known how many of the
remaining 140 workers would
continue on their jobs in the event of a
strike.
City Preparations
The Palo Alto Times reported
yesterday that city preparations in the
event of a strike include using the 140
workers, in addition to about 100
"management" people, to perform the
work normally done by the union
members.
Most of the union members work in
the utilities, maintenance, and work
crew areas.

Also, according to management,
their offer, which calls for an average
pay hike of five percent, includes
fringe benefits which brings the total
package to an eight percent boost.
The reason the city gives for
offering clerical workers a lower pay
raise than other workers is that these
workers are already comparatively
much better paid than in other Bay
Area communities.
The union memorandum disagreed,
charging that management broke off
talks last Friday after only "a few
hours" of discussion on money-related
issues.
