# Big Daddy’s Goals--Friends, Food
## 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
The small brick building remains a
place of mystery to most students.
The Faculty Club is well situated
amidst sheltering trees, but even if the
camouflage were not so prolific, most
students simply would never see the
spacious, luxurious interiors because
the opportunity does not exist for
them.
Instead, the club is the get-away for
visiting dignitaries and Stanford
professors and administration officials.
It is here they come to relax. And
relax they do.
The atmosphere is friendly.
Hotel-type accomodations are
available for guests. Staff personnel
make the short walk from their
offices.
But perhaps the greatest drawing
card is the food. Thanks to a staff of
14 regular workers and 35 students,
Stanford professors and administration
officials are among the best fed in the
nation.
And the bulk of the credit for that
goes to Dave McCullum, the
53-year-old chief chef, clad in
immaculate white clothing.

good-natured and somewhat
reminiscent of comic Redd Foxx both
in speech and mannerisms.
Two Goals
Throughout his life, he has pursued
two goals: to become an unsurpassed
cook; and in the process, to make
friends.
According to former Faculty Club
president Nathan Maccoby, McCullum
has succeeded on both counts.
Maccoby calls the chef "wonderful"
and "warm," while at the same time
commending the quality of the food
he prepares: "This facility is known as
one of the best restaurants this side of
San Francisco, and Dave is in no small
measure responsible."
McCullum refers to himself as "just
an ordinary Joe." Spending $3000 a
week for food, serving 200-300 guests
a day for lunch and 350 for dinner,
and preparing everything from
barbequed franks to coq au vin is all in
the line of work.
His friends call him by his
nickname, "Big Daddy," which he
acquired in the Army when he
weighed 295 pounds. Although now,
only 225 pounds. Big Daddy obviously

loves eating as much as cooking.
He likes "seafood, scallops, cat
fish—that's the Southern in me. I like
hot biscuits too. And I don't eat too
much soul food because of my blood
pressure."
'Got To Have Feeling'
What makes McCullum a good
cook? "You got to have feeling. Now,
I can take and teach you everything I
know about cooking, but if you can't
enjoy it, you still won't function right.
If you know how you want to taste
your food, feel your food; then it
comes out right."
McCullum says he knows of no
cook who's "any good" that hates
cooking. He claims that "85 percent of
all cooks are alcoholics. It's their
nerves," but McCullum does not
include himself in that category—"at
least not yet," he says with a smile.
McCullum believes that eating
should be an experience—he's against
the idea of "dining" becoming
"feeding." He cares about pleasing
people and that concern comes
through in his philosophy of life.
Understanding
Trite though it may sound, he

admits, he lives by the slogan, "Try to
understand and respect people and
they respect you the same way."
McCullum puts his "don't hate,
communicate" preaching into practice
in the best way he knows—teaching
people to cook.
He taught in Ohio at Wesleyan
University and at Southern University.
Besides writing his popular regular
recipe column for the Daily,
McCullum would like to teach a class
at Stanford because "people could
really benefit. A good cook is hard to
find and so many kids today would
love to jump at the chance three hours
a day to learn this."
But Big Daddy says this seems
unlikely because of a lack of time on
his part and of interest on the part of
University officials.
Though McCullum doesn't teach
cooking here, his efforts to make
friends remain constant. And he has
gained the confidence of many a
student. One coed recently came to
him with a request to help her remove
unwanted fraternity members who
were crashing a party. Big Daddy
