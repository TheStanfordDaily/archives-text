# Big Daddy’s Goals--Friends, Food
## 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
The small brick building remains a
place of mystery to most students.
The Faculty Club is well situated
amidst sheltering trees, but even if the
camouflage were not so prolific, most
students simply would never see the
spacious, luxurious interiors because
the opportunity does not exist for
them.
Instead, the club is the get-away for
visiting dignitaries and Stanford
professors and administration officials.
It is here they come to relax. And
relax they do.
The atmosphere is friendly.
Hotel-type accomodations are
available for guests. Staff personnel
make the short walk from their
offices.
But perhaps the greatest drawing
card is the food. Thanks to a staff of
14 regular workers and 35 students,
Stanford professors and administration
officials are among the best fed in the
nation.
And the bulk of the credit for that
goes to Dave McCullum, the
53-year-old chief chef, clad in
immaculate white clothing.

good-natured and somewhat
reminiscent of comic Redd Foxx both
in speech and mannerisms.
Two Goals
Throughout his life, he has pursued
two goals: to become an unsurpassed
cook; and in the process, to make
friends.
According to former Faculty Club
president Nathan Maccoby, McCullum
has succeeded on both counts.
Maccoby calls the chef "wonderful"
and "warm," while at the same time
commending the quality of the food
he prepares: "This facility is known as
one of the best restaurants this side of
San Francisco, and Dave is in no small
measure responsible."
McCullum refers to himself as "just
an ordinary Joe." Spending $3000 a
week for food, serving 200-300 guests
a day for lunch and 350 for dinner,
and preparing everything from
barbequed franks to coq au vin is all in
the line of work.
His friends call him by his
nickname, "Big Daddy," which he
acquired in the Army when he
weighed 295 pounds. Although now,
only 225 pounds. Big Daddy obviously

loves eating as much as cooking.
He likes "seafood, scallops, cat
fish—that's the Southern in me. I like
hot biscuits too. And I don't eat too
much soul food because of my blood
pressure."
'Got To Have Feeling'
What makes McCullum a good
cook? "You got to have feeling. Now,
I can take and teach you everything I
know about cooking, but if you can't
enjoy it, you still won't function right.
If you know how you want to taste
your food, feel your food; then it
comes out right."
McCullum says he knows of no
cook who's "any good" that hates
cooking. He claims that "85 percent of
all cooks are alcoholics. It's their
nerves," but McCullum does not
include himself in that category—"at
least not yet," he says with a smile.
McCullum believes that eating
should be an experience—he's against
the idea of "dining" becoming
"feeding." He cares about pleasing
people and that concern comes
through in his philosophy of life.
Understanding
Trite though it may sound, he

admits, he lives by the slogan, "Try to
understand and respect people and
they respect you the same way."
McCullum puts his "don't hate,
communicate" preaching into practice
in the best way he knows—teaching
people to cook.
He taught in Ohio at Wesleyan
University and at Southern University.
Besides writing his popular regular
recipe column for the Daily,
McCullum would like to teach a class
at Stanford because "people could
really benefit. A good cook is hard to
find and so many kids today would
love to jump at the chance three hours
a day to learn this."
But Big Daddy says this seems
unlikely because of a lack of time on
his part and of interest on the part of
University officials.
Though McCullum doesn't teach
cooking here, his efforts to make
friends remain constant. And he has
gained the confidence of many a
student. One coed recently came to
him with a request to help her remove
unwanted fraternity members who
were crashing a party. Big Daddy

complied. McCullum says that nothing
is beyond his jurisdiction or interest
when it comes to helping a friend.
When school closed in June,
McCullum not only received 21 cards
and three bouquets of flowers from
students, but one girl bought him a
cake and another worked with her
mother to bake him one.
McCullum has not always been well
liked—he has in fact led a rough
existence in which people have
shunned him simply because of his
color.
Big Daddy began earning his keep
at age 15 as a fry cook in Newlton, La.
Receiving $15 every two weeks, he
then moved on to a hotel—still a fry
cook. In 1938, he headed for Los
Angeles, attending Jefferson High
School while working at the Statler
Hilton as a fry cook.
But here he got a break: "The chef
took a liking to me. He got me a better
job at the Larkey Cafeteria. Later he
called and told me he wanted to put
me in school."
The chef helped send McCullum to
the Hemphill Institute for chefs. There
McCullum met his first signs of
prejudice, "more than I had found in
the South. I caught hell out there. We
had 150 students and I was the only
black, the second black ever to attend
the school.
"Those that would talk to me were
afraid of the bullies, the ones who
pushed them. 'Don't fool with that
nigger,' and so on." But McCullum
stayed through his first semester
because the instructor told him, "I
want you to stick it out."
He soon began an 18-year stint in
the Army. But, "I never did cook in
the Army. I cooked on the outside in
private jobs." Inside, McCullum spent
seven years as a military policeman. He
recalls racial strife: "The black
members of the military police

couldn't even carry a gun or arrest a
white soldier, but white soldiers
carried guns and could beat black
soldiers to death and it would be
all right."
So McCullum, who played the organ
in a Catholic church back home,
became a music instructor in the
Army. In 1966, he was honorably
discharged. "I made a career out of the
Army," states the husky chef.
After the Army, McCullum worked
at various schools including Ohio
State, Wesleyan, Howard, Southern
University and Mississippi State, and at
such restaurants as the Statler Hilton
and even Howard Johnson's.
Vacation, Incentive
McCullum, who has been head chef
at Stanford for 17 months, got his job
thanks to a vacation and some
incentive on his part.
"I came out to visit my aunt in
Oakland and a union representative
told me about Arturo| Lionetti, former
head chef| having trouble down here.
I talked to him, he sent me to
Personnel, where we worked out an
agreement and I came to work."
McCullum says Stanford's kitchen
is, most importantly, "clean" and
contains "every kind of convenience.
Anything that you need to buy is
okay—no one will stop you, from pots
and pans to food."
Life and Death
Big Daddy claims that the
facilities are "very safe" but
remembers a time over 10 years ago at
Cleveland's Carter Hotel when kitchen
equipment was indeed a matter of life
and death, with an emphasis on death.
He tells of a 28-year-old French
chef who opened a stove filled with
gas, which ignited on contact with the
kitchen heat.
"He opened that stove and blew his
head completely off. And he shook
that whole building. It threw me about
six to eight feet against the wall. The
man's legs were there and his feet were
kicking like a chicken. Then, his head
rolled out from underneath."
McCullum calls the incident "the
most pitiful thing I ever seen." He
himself was badly injured in the
explosion. "For a long time, I thought
I was going to lose that arm." Today,
he unbuttons his shirt to reveal the
very visible remnants of a scar.
Consequences
Big Daddy says "they don't even
allow those types of stoves anymore,
and now they have health inspectors."
Yet, he admits, he'll never forget the
consequences of using less than
modern equipment. Here, he states,
the facilities are so functional that chefs
come from other restaurants for
inspection tours. "They come here
quite regularly."
But McCullum claims that seldom
do they offer praise. "Every cook feels

he's the greatest so very few
compliments are given. They usually
criticize." However, McCullum is so
proud of his kitchen facilities that he
extends an invitation to all readers:
"Come look around anytime. Just
don't everybody rush all at once."
The only improvement necessary in
the Faculty Club kitchen, says
McCullum, is ironing out "the big
friction between black and white
employees." He has faith in the new
manager, "a good man who can
straighten things up." Yet, McCullum
emphasizes, "Up to now, it's been
hell." He says the only solution to the
"disputes" is "understanding; just stop
and listen."
McCullum points out that,
currently, black and white employees
eat lunch in separate dining rooms and
frequently, he says, there are clashes.
"You have to see it to believe it."
Habit
He claims the hostility stems not
from taught prejudice but rather habit.
"I don't think it's hate. You just
follow the leader. If a group of you all
decide everyday to discuss and talk
about your school, what can I discuss
and talk about?
"After a day or two, I run out.
When blacks get together, they have a
lot more in common to talk about.
Whites and blacks should associate
more together. They are going to
school together, working
together-they should be friends."
Assistant manager Joseph Aguilar,
who has held his post for 13 years,
says "friction is nothing unusual. It is
very common." He claims that certain
employees are "set in their ways."
Yet, Aguilar agrees that "harmony" is
necessary. "We should settle down and
try to establish loyalty to one
another."
McCullum explains that he sees
hope for improvement. "It will get
better. It has to. You couldn't go no
lower." He'says that he manages to
"overlook" and "ignore a lot of things
I should holler about. If I was a cocky
man, I'd be fighting everyday. But I'm
not like this."
Class Level
Big Daddy has spent much of his
life trying to improve racial relations.
'I don't believe in discrimination or
prejudice," he says, "but I do believe
in class. If you belong at a certain
level, regardless of your color or
nationality, you should live on this
level."
He says he never picks friends on
the basis of color. "It's how you treat
a person that counts and how he treats
you." McCullum believes that most
people do judge others by this
criterion—even Southern bigots.
He remembers an incident in
Mississippi where he cooked for a man,
who, each Christmas, sent his mother a

turkey.
"Then, one day, he told me to go
to the car and bring some bags in. I
opened the trunk up and saw a Ku
Klux Klan uniform complete with the
hood. I took off."
Friendship
But, McCullum states, the man
tried to convince him of his friendship.
"He talked to me for a week till I
overcame that fear. He said 'You're
one of the family. We love you, Mac.'
and they did."
McCullum says the man even gave
him $50 dollars to come to California
and "every year till the day he died, he
sent my mama a nice present."
McCullum admits this is strange but
again claims, "If you treat anybody
right, if they're any kind of decent
person, they'll accept you."
'Uncle Tom' Image?
Big Daddy says that blacks who eat
at the Faculty Club frequently refuse
to speak with him because they believe
he represents the "Uncle Tom" image.
But, to him, an "Uncle Tom" means
"any man that gets to be a certain age
and pulls off his hat to say, 'yes,
ma'am, yes, sir,' no matter what. He
has lowered himself as a man and his
standards of living. He was taught
this." «
McCullum says the extreme case of
an "Uncle Tom" is "the black in the
South who will hang other blacks for
whites." McCullum considers himself
an individual, claiming, "You're a man
if you carry yourself like one."
Perhaps other blacks look askance
at McCullum because he is not a rebel.

He works within a system; he is, as he
puts it "a first class servant," but he
works for a purpose.
Marching, Not Violence
McCullum, who helped start an
NAACP chapter in New York, believes
in "marching but not violence. That
only shows ignorance." And he
believes that knowledge is the black
man's greatest weapon in the fight for
equality. "What we need now is
education. I want my kids to go to
school. I'll die for this."
Big Daddy is dedicated to putting
his five children through college; in
fact, he probably works himself too
hard. But he says he wouldn't trade
places with anyone.
In a typical day, he arrives at
Stanford at 6 a.m. He bakes fresh
bread, makes soup, plans and cooks
the day's meals. By 1:30 p.m., he is
done—at Stanford.
McCullum doesn't have to cook
dinner at the Faculty Club because he
has taught assistant chefs Oliver Bruce
and John Thomas to act on their own
"and dinner is mainly short orders."
'Moonlighting'
Unless a large party presents itself,
McCullum is off to his next
job—cooking in the Highway Patrol
barracks, "just moonlighting." In his
"spare" time, he sells panty hose and
costume jewelry door to door.
"I like to do all this," McCullum
claims. "It's not just the money,
because I can live comfortably off
Stanford's salary plus my Army
pension, but I can't sit still all day. I
don't drink, don't gamble, don't

smoke, I don't shoot pool and I'm too
old to chase the girls, so I'm happy
doing what I do."
In the midst of all he does, Big
Daddy recently proposed to share his
talents, teaching this reporter some
cooking secrets.
Having watched the Galloping
Gourmet, opened a can of
Franco-American Spaghetti and
successfully prepared a Swanson TV
Dinner, I figured that if George
Plimpton could be a "Paper Lion,"
then "Big Dobby'could act as a "Paper
Chef."
And so on a warm July morning, I
donned complete chef's gear and
entered the kitchen.
'Anybody Can Cook'
Mac allowed me to simmer his
barbequed franks, and even to pour
gravy over braised short ribs.
"Anybody can cook," he advised.
"Take a pot of clear water, get it hot,
put two slices of onion in, season the
water with salt and pepper and you
have onion soup. It's all that easy." So
I asked if I could try. But Big Daddy
knew better.
Gazing at the gravy stains on my
arm and the trembling ladle in my
hand, he said, "Oh, it's too dangerous
to let you cook here. I did it all before
you came. We can't take any chances,
you know."
Somehow, I felt relieved by his
statement, yet still unfulfilled. But he
had the answer to that problem too:
"Let me cook you breakfast." Big
Daddy had indeed made "Big Klutz"
an offer he could not refuse.


DAVE "BIG DADDY" McCULLUM

"BIG DOBBY"—Complete in chef's get-up, reporter George Dobbins gets into the thick of the action stirring one of
Faculty Club head chef Dave McCullum's many pots. Dobbins, who likens his style to that of George Plimpton, orovides
a perfect example of "Big Daddy's" advice: "Anybody can cook"—even "Big Dobby."
The small brick building remains a
place of mystery to most students.
The Faculty Club is well situated

Mac allowed me to simmer his

gravy over braised short ribs.
"Anybody can cook," he advised.
"Take a pot of clear water, get it hot,
put two slices of onion in, season the
water with salt and pepper and you
have onion soup. It's all that easy." So
I asked if I could try. But Big Daddy
knew better.
Gazing at the gravy stains on my
arm and the trembling ladle in my
hand, he said, "Oh, it's too dangerous
to let you cook here. I did it all before
you came. We can't take any chances,
you know."
Somehow, I felt relieved by his

had the answer to that problem too:

DAVE "BIG DADDY" McCULLUM

"BIG DOBBY"—Complete in chef's get-up, reporter George Dobbins gets into the thick of the action stirring one of
Faculty Club head chef Dave McCullum's many pots. Dobbins, who likens his style to that of George Plimpton, orovides
a perfect example of "Big Daddy's" advice: "Anybody can cook"—even "Big Dobby."
The small brick building remains a
place of mystery to most students.
The Faculty Club is well situated
amidst sheltering trees, but even if the
camouflage were not so prolific, most
students simply would never see the
spacious, luxurious interiors because
the opportunity does not exist for
them.
Instead, the club is the get-away for
visiting dignitaries and Stanford
professors and administration officials.
It is here they come to relax. And
relax they do.
The atmosphere is friendly.
Hotel-type accomodations are
available for guests. Staff personnel
make the short walk from their
offices.
But perhaps the greatest drawing
card is the food. Thanks to a staff of
14 regular workers and 35 students,
Stanford professors and administration
officials are among the best fed in the
nation.
And the bulk of the credit for that
goes to Dave McCullum, the
53-year-old chief chef, clad in
immaculate white clothing.

good-natured and somewhat
reminiscent of comic Redd Foxx both
in speech and mannerisms.
Two Goals
Throughout his life, he has pursued
two goals: to become an unsurpassed
cook; and in the process, to make
friends.
According to former Faculty Club
president Nathan Maccoby, McCullum
has succeeded on both counts.
Maccoby calls the chef "wonderful"
and "warm," while at the same time
commending the quality of the food
he prepares: "This facility is known as
one of the best restaurants this side of
San Francisco, and Dave is in no small
measure responsible."
McCullum refers to himself as "just
an ordinary Joe." Spending $3000 a
week for food, serving 200-300 guests
a day for lunch and 350 for dinner,
and preparing everything from
barbequed franks to coq au vin is all in
the line of work.
His friends call him by his
nickname, "Big Daddy," which he
acquired in the Army when he
weighed 295 pounds. Although now,
only 225 pounds. Big Daddy obviously

loves eating as much as cooking.
He likes "seafood, scallops, cat
fish—that's the Southern in me. I like
hot biscuits too. And I don't eat too
much soul food because of my blood
pressure."
'Got To Have Feeling'
What makes McCullum a good
cook? "You got to have feeling. Now,
I can take and teach you everything I
know about cooking, but if you can't
enjoy it, you still won't function right.
If you know how you want to taste
your food, feel your food; then it
comes out right."
McCullum says he knows of no
cook who's "any good" that hates
cooking. He claims that "85 percent of
all cooks are alcoholics. It's their
nerves," but McCullum does not
include himself in that category—"at
least not yet," he says with a smile.
McCullum believes that eating
should be an experience—he's against
the idea of "dining" becoming
"feeding." He cares about pleasing
people and that concern comes
through in his philosophy of life.
Understanding
Trite though it may sound, he

admits, he lives by the slogan, "Try to
understand and respect people and
they respect you the same way."
McCullum puts his "don't hate,
communicate" preaching into practice
in the best way he knows—teaching
people to cook.
He taught in Ohio at Wesleyan
University and at Southern University.
Besides writing his popular regular
recipe column for the Daily,
McCullum would like to teach a class
at Stanford because "people could
really benefit. A good cook is hard to
find and so many kids today would
love to jump at the chance three hours
a day to learn this."
But Big Daddy says this seems
unlikely because of a lack of time on
his part and of interest on the part of
University officials.
Though McCullum doesn't teach
cooking here, his efforts to make
friends remain constant. And he has
gained the confidence of many a
student. One coed recently came to
him with a request to help her remove
unwanted fraternity members who
were crashing a party. Big Daddy

head chef at the Faculty club, displays some of his wares.
complied. McCullum says that nothing
is beyond his jurisdiction or interest
when it comes to helping a friend.
When school closed in June,
McCullum not only received 21 cards
and three bouquets of flowers from
students, but one girl bought him a
cake and another worked with her
mother to bake him one.
McCullum has not always been well
liked—he has in fact led a rough
existence in which people have
shunned him simply because of his
color.
Big Daddy began earning his keep
at age 15 as a fry cook in Newlton, La.
Receiving $15 every two weeks, he
then moved on to a hotel—still a fry
cook. In 1938, he headed for Los
Angeles, attending Jefferson High
School while working at the Statler
Hilton as a fry cook.
But here he got a break: "The chef
took a liking to me. He got me a better
job at the Larkey Cafeteria. Later he
called and told me he wanted to put
me in school."
The chef helped send McCullum to
the Hemphill Institute for chefs. There
McCullum met his first signs of
prejudice, "more than I had found in
the South. I caught hell out there. We
had 150 students and I was the only
black, the second black ever to attend
the school.
"Those that would talk to me were
afraid of the bullies, the ones who
pushed them. 'Don't fool with that
nigger,' and so on." But McCullum
stayed through his first semester
because the instructor told him, "I
want you to stick it out."
He soon began an 18-year stint in
the Army. But, "I never did cook in
the Army. I cooked on the outside in
private jobs." Inside, McCullum spent
seven years as a military policeman. He
recalls racial strife: "The black
members of the military police

couldn't even carry a gun or arrest a
white soldier, but white soldiers
carried guns and could beat black
soldiers to death and it would be
all right."
So McCullum, who played the organ
in a Catholic church back home,
became a music instructor in the
Army. In 1966, he was honorably
discharged. "I made a career out of the
Army," states the husky chef.
After the Army, McCullum worked
at various schools including Ohio
State, Wesleyan, Howard, Southern
University and Mississippi State, and at
such restaurants as the Statler Hilton
and even Howard Johnson's.
Vacation, Incentive
McCullum, who has been head chef
at Stanford for 17 months, got his job
thanks to a vacation and some
incentive on his part.
"I came out to visit my aunt in
Oakland and a union representative
told me about Arturo| Lionetti, former
head chef| having trouble down here.
I talked to him, he sent me to
Personnel, where we worked out an
agreement and I came to work."
McCullum says Stanford's kitchen
is, most importantly, "clean" and
contains "every kind of convenience.
Anything that you need to buy is
okay—no one will stop you, from pots
and pans to food."
Life and Death
Big Daddy claims that the
facilities are "very safe" but
remembers a time over 10 years ago at
Cleveland's Carter Hotel when kitchen
equipment was indeed a matter of life
and death, with an emphasis on death.
He tells of a 28-year-old French
chef who opened a stove filled with
gas, which ignited on contact with the
kitchen heat.
"He opened that stove and blew his
head completely off. And he shook
that whole building. It threw me about
six to eight feet against the wall. The
man's legs were there and his feet were
kicking like a chicken. Then, his head
rolled out from underneath."
McCullum calls the incident "the
most pitiful thing I ever seen." He
himself was badly injured in the
explosion. "For a long time, I thought
I was going to lose that arm." Today,
he unbuttons his shirt to reveal the
very visible remnants of a scar.
Consequences
Big Daddy says "they don't even
allow those types of stoves anymore,
and now they have health inspectors."
Yet, he admits, he'll never forget the
consequences of using less than
modern equipment. Here, he states,
the facilities are so functional that chefs
come from other restaurants for
inspection tours. "They come here
quite regularly."
But McCullum claims that seldom
do they offer praise. "Every cook feels

he's the greatest so very few
compliments are given. They usually
criticize." However, McCullum is so
proud of his kitchen facilities that he
extends an invitation to all readers:
"Come look around anytime. Just
don't everybody rush all at once."
The only improvement necessary in
the Faculty Club kitchen, says
McCullum, is ironing out "the big
friction between black and white
employees." He has faith in the new
manager, "a good man who can
straighten things up." Yet, McCullum
emphasizes, "Up to now, it's been
hell." He says the only solution to the
"disputes" is "understanding; just stop
and listen."
McCullum points out that,
currently, black and white employees
eat lunch in separate dining rooms and
frequently, he says, there are clashes.
"You have to see it to believe it."
Habit
He claims the hostility stems not
from taught prejudice but rather habit.
"I don't think it's hate. You just
follow the leader. If a group of you all
decide everyday to discuss and talk
about your school, what can I discuss
and talk about?
"After a day or two, I run out.
When blacks get together, they have a
lot more in common to talk about.
Whites and blacks should associate
more together. They are going to
school together, working
together-they should be friends."
Assistant manager Joseph Aguilar,
who has held his post for 13 years,
says "friction is nothing unusual. It is
very common." He claims that certain
employees are "set in their ways."
Yet, Aguilar agrees that "harmony" is
necessary. "We should settle down and
try to establish loyalty to one
another."
McCullum explains that he sees
hope for improvement. "It will get
better. It has to. You couldn't go no
lower." He'says that he manages to
"overlook" and "ignore a lot of things
I should holler about. If I was a cocky
man, I'd be fighting everyday. But I'm
not like this."
Class Level
Big Daddy has spent much of his
life trying to improve racial relations.
'I don't believe in discrimination or
prejudice," he says, "but I do believe
in class. If you belong at a certain
level, regardless of your color or
nationality, you should live on this
level."
He says he never picks friends on
the basis of color. "It's how you treat
a person that counts and how he treats
you." McCullum believes that most
people do judge others by this
criterion—even Southern bigots.
He remembers an incident in
Mississippi where he cooked for a man,
who, each Christmas, sent his mother a

turkey.
"Then, one day, he told me to go
to the car and bring some bags in. I
opened the trunk up and saw a Ku
Klux Klan uniform complete with the
hood. I took off."
Friendship
But, McCullum states, the man
tried to convince him of his friendship.
"He talked to me for a week till I
overcame that fear. He said 'You're
one of the family. We love you, Mac.'
and they did."
McCullum says the man even gave
him $50 dollars to come to California
and "every year till the day he died, he
sent my mama a nice present."
McCullum admits this is strange but
again claims, "If you treat anybody
right, if they're any kind of decent
person, they'll accept you."
'Uncle Tom' Image?
Big Daddy says that blacks who eat
at the Faculty Club frequently refuse
to speak with him because they believe
he represents the "Uncle Tom" image.
But, to him, an "Uncle Tom" means
"any man that gets to be a certain age
and pulls off his hat to say, 'yes,
ma'am, yes, sir,' no matter what. He
has lowered himself as a man and his
standards of living. He was taught
this." «
McCullum says the extreme case of
an "Uncle Tom" is "the black in the
South who will hang other blacks for
whites." McCullum considers himself
an individual, claiming, "You're a man
if you carry yourself like one."
Perhaps other blacks look askance
at McCullum because he is not a rebel.

He works within a system; he is, as he
puts it "a first class servant," but he
works for a purpose.
Marching, Not Violence
McCullum, who helped start an
NAACP chapter in New York, believes
in "marching but not violence. That
only shows ignorance." And he
believes that knowledge is the black
man's greatest weapon in the fight for
equality. "What we need now is
education. I want my kids to go to
school. I'll die for this."
Big Daddy is dedicated to putting
his five children through college; in
fact, he probably works himself too
hard. But he says he wouldn't trade
places with anyone.
In a typical day, he arrives at
Stanford at 6 a.m. He bakes fresh
bread, makes soup, plans and cooks
the day's meals. By 1:30 p.m., he is
done—at Stanford.
McCullum doesn't have to cook
dinner at the Faculty Club because he
has taught assistant chefs Oliver Bruce
and John Thomas to act on their own
"and dinner is mainly short orders."
'Moonlighting'
Unless a large party presents itself,
McCullum is off to his next
job—cooking in the Highway Patrol
barracks, "just moonlighting." In his
"spare" time, he sells panty hose and
costume jewelry door to door.
"I like to do all this," McCullum
claims. "It's not just the money,
because I can live comfortably off
Stanford's salary plus my Army
pension, but I can't sit still all day. I
don't drink, don't gamble, don't

smoke, I don't shoot pool and I'm too
old to chase the girls, so I'm happy
doing what I do."
In the midst of all he does, Big
Daddy recently proposed to share his
talents, teaching this reporter some
cooking secrets.
Having watched the Galloping
Gourmet, opened a can of
Franco-American Spaghetti and
successfully prepared a Swanson TV
Dinner, I figured that if George
Plimpton could be a "Paper Lion,"
then "Big Dobby'could act as a "Paper
Chef."
And so on a warm July morning, I
donned complete chef's gear and
entered the kitchen.
'Anybody Can Cook'
Mac allowed me to simmer his
barbequed franks, and even to pour
gravy over braised short ribs.
"Anybody can cook," he advised.
"Take a pot of clear water, get it hot,
put two slices of onion in, season the
water with salt and pepper and you
have onion soup. It's all that easy." So
I asked if I could try. But Big Daddy
knew better.
Gazing at the gravy stains on my
arm and the trembling ladle in my
hand, he said, "Oh, it's too dangerous
to let you cook here. I did it all before
you came. We can't take any chances,
you know."
Somehow, I felt relieved by his
statement, yet still unfulfilled. But he
had the answer to that problem too:
"Let me cook you breakfast." Big
Daddy had indeed made "Big Klutz"
an offer he could not refuse.

equality. "What we need now is
education. I want my kids to go to
school. I'll die for this."
Big Daddy is dedicated to putting
his five children through college; in
fact, he probably works himself too
hard. But he says he wouldn't trade
places with anyone.
In a typical day, he arrives at
Stanford at 6 a.m. He bakes fresh
bread, makes soup, plans and cooks
the day's meals. By 1:30 p.m., he is
done—at Stanford.
McCullum doesn't have to cook
dinner at the Faculty Club because he
has taught assistant chefs Oliver Bruce
and John Thomas to act on their own
"and dinner is mainly short orders."
'Moonlighting'
Unless a large party presents itself,
McCullum is off to his next
job—cooking in the Highway Patrol
barracks, "just moonlighting." In his
"spare" time, he sells panty hose and
costume jewelry door to door.
"I like to do all this," McCullum
claims. "It's not just the money,
because I can live comfortably off
Stanford's salary plus my Army
pension, but I can't sit still all day. I
don't drink, don't gamble, don't

smoke, I don't shoot pool and I'm too
old to chase the girls, so I'm happy
doing what I do."
In the midst of all he does, Big
Daddy recently proposed to share his
talents, teaching this reporter some
cooking secrets.
Having watched the Galloping
Gourmet, opened a can of
Franco-American Spaghetti and
successfully prepared a Swanson TV
Dinner, I figured that if George
Plimpton could be a "Paper Lion,"
then "Big Dobby'could act as a "Paper
Chef."
And so on a warm July morning, I
donned complete chef's gear and
entered the kitchen.
'Anybody Can Cook'
Mac allowed me to simmer his
barbequed franks, and even to pour
gravy over braised short ribs.
"Anybody can cook," he advised.
"Take a pot of clear water, get it hot,
put two slices of onion in, season the
water with salt and pepper and you
have onion soup. It's all that easy." So
I asked if I could try. But Big Daddy
knew better.
Gazing at the gravy stains on my
arm and the trembling ladle in my
hand, he said, "Oh, it's too dangerous
to let you cook here. I did it all before
you came. We can't take any chances,
you know."
Somehow, I felt relieved by his
statement, yet still unfulfilled. But he
had the answer to that problem too:
"Let me cook you breakfast." Big
Daddy had indeed made "Big Klutz"
an offer he could not refuse.

"BIG DOBBY"—Complete in chef's get-up, reporter George Dobbins gets into the thick of the action stirring one of
Faculty Club head chef Dave McCullum's many pots. Dobbins, who likens his style to that of George Plimpton, orovides
a perfect example of "Big Daddy's" advice: "Anybody can cook"—even "Big Dobby."
The small brick building remains a
place of mystery to most students.
The Faculty Club is well situated
amidst sheltering trees, but even if the
camouflage were not so prolific, most
students simply would never see the
spacious, luxurious interiors because
the opportunity does not exist for
them.
Instead, the club is the get-away for
visiting dignitaries and Stanford
professors and administration officials.
It is here they come to relax. And
relax they do.
The atmosphere is friendly.
Hotel-type accomodations are
available for guests. Staff personnel
make the short walk from their
offices.
But perhaps the greatest drawing
card is the food. Thanks to a staff of
14 regular workers and 35 students,
Stanford professors and administration
officials are among the best fed in the
nation.
And the bulk of the credit for that
goes to Dave McCullum, the
53-year-old chief chef, clad in
immaculate white clothing.

good-natured and somewhat
reminiscent of comic Redd Foxx both
in speech and mannerisms.
Two Goals
Throughout his life, he has pursued
two goals: to become an unsurpassed
cook; and in the process, to make
friends.
According to former Faculty Club
president Nathan Maccoby, McCullum
has succeeded on both counts.
Maccoby calls the chef "wonderful"
and "warm," while at the same time
commending the quality of the food
he prepares: "This facility is known as
one of the best restaurants this side of
San Francisco, and Dave is in no small
measure responsible."
McCullum refers to himself as "just
an ordinary Joe." Spending $3000 a
week for food, serving 200-300 guests
a day for lunch and 350 for dinner,
and preparing everything from
barbequed franks to coq au vin is all in
the line of work.
His friends call him by his
nickname, "Big Daddy," which he
acquired in the Army when he
weighed 295 pounds. Although now,
only 225 pounds. Big Daddy obviously

loves eating as much as cooking.
He likes "seafood, scallops, cat
fish—that's the Southern in me. I like
hot biscuits too. And I don't eat too
much soul food because of my blood
pressure."
'Got To Have Feeling'
What makes McCullum a good
cook? "You got to have feeling. Now,
I can take and teach you everything I
know about cooking, but if you can't
enjoy it, you still won't function right.
If you know how you want to taste
your food, feel your food; then it
comes out right."
McCullum says he knows of no
cook who's "any good" that hates
cooking. He claims that "85 percent of
all cooks are alcoholics. It's their
nerves," but McCullum does not
include himself in that category—"at
least not yet," he says with a smile.
McCullum believes that eating
should be an experience—he's against
the idea of "dining" becoming
"feeding." He cares about pleasing
people and that concern comes
through in his philosophy of life.
Understanding
Trite though it may sound, he

admits, he lives by the slogan, "Try to
understand and respect people and
they respect you the same way."
McCullum puts his "don't hate,
communicate" preaching into practice
in the best way he knows—teaching
people to cook.
He taught in Ohio at Wesleyan
University and at Southern University.
Besides writing his popular regular
recipe column for the Daily,
McCullum would like to teach a class
at Stanford because "people could
really benefit. A good cook is hard to
find and so many kids today would
love to jump at the chance three hours
a day to learn this."
But Big Daddy says this seems
unlikely because of a lack of time on
his part and of interest on the part of
University officials.
Though McCullum doesn't teach
cooking here, his efforts to make
friends remain constant. And he has
gained the confidence of many a
student. One coed recently came to
him with a request to help her remove
unwanted fraternity members who
were crashing a party. Big Daddy

head chef at the Faculty club, displays some of his wares.
complied. McCullum says that nothing
is beyond his jurisdiction or interest
when it comes to helping a friend.
When school closed in June,
McCullum not only received 21 cards
and three bouquets of flowers from
students, but one girl bought him a
cake and another worked with her
mother to bake him one.
McCullum has not always been well
liked—he has in fact led a rough
existence in which people have
shunned him simply because of his
color.
Big Daddy began earning his keep
at age 15 as a fry cook in Newlton, La.
Receiving $15 every two weeks, he
then moved on to a hotel—still a fry
cook. In 1938, he headed for Los
Angeles, attending Jefferson High
School while working at the Statler
Hilton as a fry cook.
But here he got a break: "The chef
took a liking to me. He got me a better
job at the Larkey Cafeteria. Later he
called and told me he wanted to put
me in school."
The chef helped send McCullum to
the Hemphill Institute for chefs. There
McCullum met his first signs of
prejudice, "more than I had found in
the South. I caught hell out there. We
had 150 students and I was the only
black, the second black ever to attend
the school.
"Those that would talk to me were
afraid of the bullies, the ones who
pushed them. 'Don't fool with that
nigger,' and so on." But McCullum
stayed through his first semester
because the instructor told him, "I
want you to stick it out."
He soon began an 18-year stint in
the Army. But, "I never did cook in
the Army. I cooked on the outside in
private jobs." Inside, McCullum spent
seven years as a military policeman. He
recalls racial strife: "The black
members of the military police

couldn't even carry a gun or arrest a
white soldier, but white soldiers
carried guns and could beat black
soldiers to death and it would be
all right."
So McCullum, who played the organ
in a Catholic church back home,
became a music instructor in the
Army. In 1966, he was honorably
discharged. "I made a career out of the
Army," states the husky chef.
After the Army, McCullum worked
at various schools including Ohio
State, Wesleyan, Howard, Southern
University and Mississippi State, and at
such restaurants as the Statler Hilton
and even Howard Johnson's.
Vacation, Incentive
McCullum, who has been head chef
at Stanford for 17 months, got his job
thanks to a vacation and some
incentive on his part.
"I came out to visit my aunt in
Oakland and a union representative
told me about Arturo| Lionetti, former
head chef| having trouble down here.
I talked to him, he sent me to
Personnel, where we worked out an
agreement and I came to work."
McCullum says Stanford's kitchen
is, most importantly, "clean" and
contains "every kind of convenience.
Anything that you need to buy is
okay—no one will stop you, from pots
and pans to food."
Life and Death
Big Daddy claims that the
facilities are "very safe" but
remembers a time over 10 years ago at
Cleveland's Carter Hotel when kitchen
equipment was indeed a matter of life
and death, with an emphasis on death.
He tells of a 28-year-old French
chef who opened a stove filled with
gas, which ignited on contact with the
kitchen heat.
"He opened that stove and blew his
head completely off. And he shook
that whole building. It threw me about
six to eight feet against the wall. The
man's legs were there and his feet were
kicking like a chicken. Then, his head
rolled out from underneath."
McCullum calls the incident "the
most pitiful thing I ever seen." He
himself was badly injured in the
explosion. "For a long time, I thought
I was going to lose that arm." Today,
he unbuttons his shirt to reveal the
very visible remnants of a scar.
Consequences
Big Daddy says "they don't even
allow those types of stoves anymore,
and now they have health inspectors."
Yet, he admits, he'll never forget the
consequences of using less than
modern equipment. Here, he states,
the facilities are so functional that chefs
come from other restaurants for
inspection tours. "They come here
quite regularly."
But McCullum claims that seldom
do they offer praise. "Every cook feels

he's the greatest so very few
compliments are given. They usually
criticize." However, McCullum is so
proud of his kitchen facilities that he
extends an invitation to all readers:
"Come look around anytime. Just
don't everybody rush all at once."
The only improvement necessary in
the Faculty Club kitchen, says
McCullum, is ironing out "the big
friction between black and white
employees." He has faith in the new
manager, "a good man who can
straighten things up." Yet, McCullum
emphasizes, "Up to now, it's been
hell." He says the only solution to the
"disputes" is "understanding; just stop
and listen."
McCullum points out that,
currently, black and white employees
eat lunch in separate dining rooms and
frequently, he says, there are clashes.
"You have to see it to believe it."
Habit
He claims the hostility stems not
from taught prejudice but rather habit.
"I don't think it's hate. You just
follow the leader. If a group of you all
decide everyday to discuss and talk
about your school, what can I discuss
and talk about?
"After a day or two, I run out.
When blacks get together, they have a
lot more in common to talk about.
Whites and blacks should associate
more together. They are going to
school together, working
together-they should be friends."
Assistant manager Joseph Aguilar,
who has held his post for 13 years,
says "friction is nothing unusual. It is
very common." He claims that certain
employees are "set in their ways."
Yet, Aguilar agrees that "harmony" is
necessary. "We should settle down and
try to establish loyalty to one
another."
McCullum explains that he sees
hope for improvement. "It will get
better. It has to. You couldn't go no
lower." He'says that he manages to
"overlook" and "ignore a lot of things
I should holler about. If I was a cocky
man, I'd be fighting everyday. But I'm
not like this."
Class Level
Big Daddy has spent much of his
life trying to improve racial relations.
'I don't believe in discrimination or
prejudice," he says, "but I do believe
in class. If you belong at a certain
level, regardless of your color or
nationality, you should live on this
level."
He says he never picks friends on
the basis of color. "It's how you treat
a person that counts and how he treats
you." McCullum believes that most
people do judge others by this
criterion—even Southern bigots.
He remembers an incident in
Mississippi where he cooked for a man,
who, each Christmas, sent his mother a

turkey.
"Then, one day, he told me to go
to the car and bring some bags in. I
opened the trunk up and saw a Ku
Klux Klan uniform complete with the
hood. I took off."
Friendship
But, McCullum states, the man
tried to convince him of his friendship.
"He talked to me for a week till I
overcame that fear. He said 'You're
one of the family. We love you, Mac.'
and they did."
McCullum says the man even gave
him $50 dollars to come to California
and "every year till the day he died, he
sent my mama a nice present."
McCullum admits this is strange but
again claims, "If you treat anybody
right, if they're any kind of decent
person, they'll accept you."
'Uncle Tom' Image?
Big Daddy says that blacks who eat
at the Faculty Club frequently refuse
to speak with him because they believe
he represents the "Uncle Tom" image.
But, to him, an "Uncle Tom" means
"any man that gets to be a certain age
and pulls off his hat to say, 'yes,
ma'am, yes, sir,' no matter what. He
has lowered himself as a man and his
standards of living. He was taught
this." «
McCullum says the extreme case of
an "Uncle Tom" is "the black in the
South who will hang other blacks for
whites." McCullum considers himself
an individual, claiming, "You're a man
if you carry yourself like one."
Perhaps other blacks look askance
at McCullum because he is not a rebel.

He works within a system; he is, as he
puts it "a first class servant," but he
works for a purpose.
Marching, Not Violence
McCullum, who helped start an
NAACP chapter in New York, believes
in "marching but not violence. That
only shows ignorance." And he
believes that knowledge is the black
man's greatest weapon in the fight for
equality. "What we need now is
education. I want my kids to go to
school. I'll die for this."
Big Daddy is dedicated to putting
his five children through college; in
fact, he probably works himself too
hard. But he says he wouldn't trade
places with anyone.
In a typical day, he arrives at
Stanford at 6 a.m. He bakes fresh
bread, makes soup, plans and cooks
the day's meals. By 1:30 p.m., he is
done—at Stanford.
McCullum doesn't have to cook
dinner at the Faculty Club because he
has taught assistant chefs Oliver Bruce
and John Thomas to act on their own
"and dinner is mainly short orders."
'Moonlighting'
Unless a large party presents itself,
McCullum is off to his next
job—cooking in the Highway Patrol
barracks, "just moonlighting." In his
"spare" time, he sells panty hose and
costume jewelry door to door.
"I like to do all this," McCullum
claims. "It's not just the money,
because I can live comfortably off
Stanford's salary plus my Army
pension, but I can't sit still all day. I
don't drink, don't gamble, don't

smoke, I don't shoot pool and I'm too
old to chase the girls, so I'm happy
doing what I do."
In the midst of all he does, Big
Daddy recently proposed to share his
talents, teaching this reporter some
cooking secrets.
Having watched the Galloping
Gourmet, opened a can of
Franco-American Spaghetti and
successfully prepared a Swanson TV
Dinner, I figured that if George
Plimpton could be a "Paper Lion,"
then "Big Dobby'could act as a "Paper
Chef."
And so on a warm July morning, I
donned complete chef's gear and
entered the kitchen.
'Anybody Can Cook'
Mac allowed me to simmer his
barbequed franks, and even to pour
gravy over braised short ribs.
"Anybody can cook," he advised.
"Take a pot of clear water, get it hot,
put two slices of onion in, season the
water with salt and pepper and you
have onion soup. It's all that easy." So
I asked if I could try. But Big Daddy
knew better.
Gazing at the gravy stains on my
arm and the trembling ladle in my
hand, he said, "Oh, it's too dangerous
to let you cook here. I did it all before
you came. We can't take any chances,
you know."
Somehow, I felt relieved by his
statement, yet still unfulfilled. But he
had the answer to that problem too:
"Let me cook you breakfast." Big
Daddy had indeed made "Big Klutz"
an offer he could not refuse.

overcame that fear. He said 'You're
one of the family. We love you, Mac.'
and they did."
McCullum says the man even gave
him $50 dollars to come to California
and "every year till the day he died, he
sent my mama a nice present."
McCullum admits this is strange but
again claims, "If you treat anybody
right, if they're any kind of decent
person, they'll accept you."
'Uncle Tom' Image?
Big Daddy says that blacks who eat
at the Faculty Club frequently refuse
to speak with him because they believe
he represents the "Uncle Tom" image.
But, to him, an "Uncle Tom" means
"any man that gets to be a certain age
and pulls off his hat to say, 'yes,
ma'am, yes, sir,' no matter what. He
has lowered himself as a man and his
standards of living. He was taught
this." «
McCullum says the extreme case of
an "Uncle Tom" is "the black in the
South who will hang other blacks for
whites." McCullum considers himself
an individual, claiming, "You're a man
if you carry yourself like one."
Perhaps other blacks look askance
at McCullum because he is not a rebel.

He works within a system; he is, as he
puts it "a first class servant," but he
works for a purpose.
Marching, Not Violence
McCullum, who helped start an
NAACP chapter in New York, believes
in "marching but not violence. That
only shows ignorance." And he
believes that knowledge is the black
man's greatest weapon in the fight for
equality. "What we need now is
education. I want my kids to go to
school. I'll die for this."
Big Daddy is dedicated to putting
his five children through college; in
fact, he probably works himself too
hard. But he says he wouldn't trade
places with anyone.
In a typical day, he arrives at
Stanford at 6 a.m. He bakes fresh
bread, makes soup, plans and cooks
the day's meals. By 1:30 p.m., he is
done—at Stanford.
McCullum doesn't have to cook
dinner at the Faculty Club because he
has taught assistant chefs Oliver Bruce
and John Thomas to act on their own
"and dinner is mainly short orders."
'Moonlighting'
Unless a large party presents itself,
McCullum is off to his next
job—cooking in the Highway Patrol
barracks, "just moonlighting." In his
"spare" time, he sells panty hose and
costume jewelry door to door.
"I like to do all this," McCullum
claims. "It's not just the money,
because I can live comfortably off
Stanford's salary plus my Army
pension, but I can't sit still all day. I
don't drink, don't gamble, don't

smoke, I don't shoot pool and I'm too
old to chase the girls, so I'm happy
doing what I do."
In the midst of all he does, Big
Daddy recently proposed to share his
talents, teaching this reporter some
cooking secrets.
Having watched the Galloping
Gourmet, opened a can of
Franco-American Spaghetti and
successfully prepared a Swanson TV
Dinner, I figured that if George
Plimpton could be a "Paper Lion,"
then "Big Dobby'could act as a "Paper
Chef."
And so on a warm July morning, I
donned complete chef's gear and
entered the kitchen.
'Anybody Can Cook'
Mac allowed me to simmer his
barbequed franks, and even to pour
gravy over braised short ribs.
"Anybody can cook," he advised.
"Take a pot of clear water, get it hot,
put two slices of onion in, season the
water with salt and pepper and you
have onion soup. It's all that easy." So
I asked if I could try. But Big Daddy
knew better.
Gazing at the gravy stains on my
arm and the trembling ladle in my
hand, he said, "Oh, it's too dangerous
to let you cook here. I did it all before
you came. We can't take any chances,
you know."
Somehow, I felt relieved by his
statement, yet still unfulfilled. But he
had the answer to that problem too:
"Let me cook you breakfast." Big
Daddy had indeed made "Big Klutz"
an offer he could not refuse.

"BIG DOBBY"—Complete in chef's get-up, reporter George Dobbins gets into the thick of the action stirring one of
Faculty Club head chef Dave McCullum's many pots. Dobbins, who likens his style to that of George Plimpton, orovides
a perfect example of "Big Daddy's" advice: "Anybody can cook"—even "Big Dobby."
The small brick building remains a
place of mystery to most students.
The Faculty Club is well situated
amidst sheltering trees, but even if the
camouflage were not so prolific, most
students simply would never see the
spacious, luxurious interiors because
the opportunity does not exist for
them.
Instead, the club is the get-away for
visiting dignitaries and Stanford
professors and administration officials.
It is here they come to relax. And
relax they do.
The atmosphere is friendly.
Hotel-type accomodations are
available for guests. Staff personnel
make the short walk from their
offices.
But perhaps the greatest drawing
card is the food. Thanks to a staff of
14 regular workers and 35 students,
Stanford professors and administration
officials are among the best fed in the
nation.
And the bulk of the credit for that
goes to Dave McCullum, the
53-year-old chief chef, clad in
immaculate white clothing.

good-natured and somewhat
reminiscent of comic Redd Foxx both
in speech and mannerisms.
Two Goals
Throughout his life, he has pursued
two goals: to become an unsurpassed
cook; and in the process, to make
friends.
According to former Faculty Club
president Nathan Maccoby, McCullum
has succeeded on both counts.
Maccoby calls the chef "wonderful"
and "warm," while at the same time
commending the quality of the food
he prepares: "This facility is known as
one of the best restaurants this side of
San Francisco, and Dave is in no small
measure responsible."
McCullum refers to himself as "just
an ordinary Joe." Spending $3000 a
week for food, serving 200-300 guests
a day for lunch and 350 for dinner,
and preparing everything from
barbequed franks to coq au vin is all in
the line of work.
His friends call him by his
nickname, "Big Daddy," which he
acquired in the Army when he
weighed 295 pounds. Although now,
only 225 pounds. Big Daddy obviously

loves eating as much as cooking.
He likes "seafood, scallops, cat
fish—that's the Southern in me. I like
hot biscuits too. And I don't eat too
much soul food because of my blood
pressure."
'Got To Have Feeling'
What makes McCullum a good
cook? "You got to have feeling. Now,
I can take and teach you everything I
know about cooking, but if you can't
enjoy it, you still won't function right.
If you know how you want to taste
your food, feel your food; then it
comes out right."
McCullum says he knows of no
cook who's "any good" that hates
cooking. He claims that "85 percent of
all cooks are alcoholics. It's their
nerves," but McCullum does not
include himself in that category—"at
least not yet," he says with a smile.
McCullum believes that eating
should be an experience—he's against
the idea of "dining" becoming
"feeding." He cares about pleasing
people and that concern comes
through in his philosophy of life.
Understanding
Trite though it may sound, he

admits, he lives by the slogan, "Try to
understand and respect people and
they respect you the same way."
McCullum puts his "don't hate,
communicate" preaching into practice
in the best way he knows—teaching
people to cook.
He taught in Ohio at Wesleyan
University and at Southern University.
Besides writing his popular regular
recipe column for the Daily,
McCullum would like to teach a class
at Stanford because "people could
really benefit. A good cook is hard to
find and so many kids today would
love to jump at the chance three hours
a day to learn this."
But Big Daddy says this seems
unlikely because of a lack of time on
his part and of interest on the part of
University officials.
Though McCullum doesn't teach
cooking here, his efforts to make
friends remain constant. And he has
gained the confidence of many a
student. One coed recently came to
him with a request to help her remove
unwanted fraternity members who
were crashing a party. Big Daddy

BUBBLE AND BOIL, TROUBLE AND TOIL-Dave "Big Daddy" McCullum,
head chef at the Faculty club, displays some of his wares.
complied. McCullum says that nothing
is beyond his jurisdiction or interest
when it comes to helping a friend.
When school closed in June,
McCullum not only received 21 cards
and three bouquets of flowers from
students, but one girl bought him a
cake and another worked with her
mother to bake him one.
McCullum has not always been well
liked—he has in fact led a rough
existence in which people have
shunned him simply because of his
color.
Big Daddy began earning his keep
at age 15 as a fry cook in Newlton, La.
Receiving $15 every two weeks, he
then moved on to a hotel—still a fry
cook. In 1938, he headed for Los
Angeles, attending Jefferson High
School while working at the Statler
Hilton as a fry cook.
But here he got a break: "The chef
took a liking to me. He got me a better
job at the Larkey Cafeteria. Later he
called and told me he wanted to put
me in school."
The chef helped send McCullum to
the Hemphill Institute for chefs. There
McCullum met his first signs of
prejudice, "more than I had found in
the South. I caught hell out there. We
had 150 students and I was the only
black, the second black ever to attend
the school.
"Those that would talk to me were
afraid of the bullies, the ones who
pushed them. 'Don't fool with that
nigger,' and so on." But McCullum
stayed through his first semester
because the instructor told him, "I
want you to stick it out."
He soon began an 18-year stint in
the Army. But, "I never did cook in
the Army. I cooked on the outside in
private jobs." Inside, McCullum spent
seven years as a military policeman. He
recalls racial strife: "The black
members of the military police

couldn't even carry a gun or arrest a
white soldier, but white soldiers
carried guns and could beat black
soldiers to death and it would be
all right."
So McCullum, who played the organ
in a Catholic church back home,
became a music instructor in the
Army. In 1966, he was honorably
discharged. "I made a career out of the
Army," states the husky chef.
After the Army, McCullum worked
at various schools including Ohio
State, Wesleyan, Howard, Southern
University and Mississippi State, and at
such restaurants as the Statler Hilton
and even Howard Johnson's.
Vacation, Incentive
McCullum, who has been head chef
at Stanford for 17 months, got his job
thanks to a vacation and some
incentive on his part.
"I came out to visit my aunt in
Oakland and a union representative
told me about Arturo| Lionetti, former
head chef| having trouble down here.
I talked to him, he sent me to
Personnel, where we worked out an
agreement and I came to work."
McCullum says Stanford's kitchen
is, most importantly, "clean" and
contains "every kind of convenience.
Anything that you need to buy is
okay—no one will stop you, from pots
and pans to food."
Life and Death
Big Daddy claims that the
facilities are "very safe" but
remembers a time over 10 years ago at
Cleveland's Carter Hotel when kitchen
equipment was indeed a matter of life
and death, with an emphasis on death.
He tells of a 28-year-old French
chef who opened a stove filled with
gas, which ignited on contact with the
kitchen heat.
"He opened that stove and blew his
head completely off. And he shook
that whole building. It threw me about
six to eight feet against the wall. The
man's legs were there and his feet were
kicking like a chicken. Then, his head
rolled out from underneath."
McCullum calls the incident "the
most pitiful thing I ever seen." He
himself was badly injured in the
explosion. "For a long time, I thought
I was going to lose that arm." Today,
he unbuttons his shirt to reveal the
very visible remnants of a scar.
Consequences
Big Daddy says "they don't even
allow those types of stoves anymore,
and now they have health inspectors."
Yet, he admits, he'll never forget the
consequences of using less than
modern equipment. Here, he states,
the facilities are so functional that chefs
come from other restaurants for
inspection tours. "They come here
quite regularly."
But McCullum claims that seldom
do they offer praise. "Every cook feels

he's the greatest so very few
compliments are given. They usually
criticize." However, McCullum is so
proud of his kitchen facilities that he
extends an invitation to all readers:
"Come look around anytime. Just
don't everybody rush all at once."
The only improvement necessary in
the Faculty Club kitchen, says
McCullum, is ironing out "the big
friction between black and white
employees." He has faith in the new
manager, "a good man who can
straighten things up." Yet, McCullum
emphasizes, "Up to now, it's been
hell." He says the only solution to the
"disputes" is "understanding; just stop
and listen."
McCullum points out that,
currently, black and white employees
eat lunch in separate dining rooms and
frequently, he says, there are clashes.
"You have to see it to believe it."
Habit
He claims the hostility stems not
from taught prejudice but rather habit.
"I don't think it's hate. You just
follow the leader. If a group of you all
decide everyday to discuss and talk
about your school, what can I discuss
and talk about?
"After a day or two, I run out.
When blacks get together, they have a
lot more in common to talk about.
Whites and blacks should associate
more together. They are going to
school together, working
together-they should be friends."
Assistant manager Joseph Aguilar,
who has held his post for 13 years,
says "friction is nothing unusual. It is
very common." He claims that certain
employees are "set in their ways."
Yet, Aguilar agrees that "harmony" is
necessary. "We should settle down and
try to establish loyalty to one
another."
McCullum explains that he sees
hope for improvement. "It will get
better. It has to. You couldn't go no
lower." He'says that he manages to
"overlook" and "ignore a lot of things
I should holler about. If I was a cocky
man, I'd be fighting everyday. But I'm
not like this."
Class Level
Big Daddy has spent much of his
life trying to improve racial relations.
'I don't believe in discrimination or
prejudice," he says, "but I do believe
in class. If you belong at a certain
level, regardless of your color or
nationality, you should live on this
level."
He says he never picks friends on
the basis of color. "It's how you treat
a person that counts and how he treats
you." McCullum believes that most
people do judge others by this
criterion—even Southern bigots.
He remembers an incident in
Mississippi where he cooked for a man,
who, each Christmas, sent his mother a

turkey.
"Then, one day, he told me to go
to the car and bring some bags in. I
opened the trunk up and saw a Ku
Klux Klan uniform complete with the
hood. I took off."
Friendship
But, McCullum states, the man
tried to convince him of his friendship.
"He talked to me for a week till I
overcame that fear. He said 'You're
one of the family. We love you, Mac.'
and they did."
McCullum says the man even gave
him $50 dollars to come to California
and "every year till the day he died, he
sent my mama a nice present."
McCullum admits this is strange but
again claims, "If you treat anybody
right, if they're any kind of decent
person, they'll accept you."
'Uncle Tom' Image?
Big Daddy says that blacks who eat
at the Faculty Club frequently refuse
to speak with him because they believe
he represents the "Uncle Tom" image.
But, to him, an "Uncle Tom" means
"any man that gets to be a certain age
and pulls off his hat to say, 'yes,
ma'am, yes, sir,' no matter what. He
has lowered himself as a man and his
standards of living. He was taught
this." «
McCullum says the extreme case of
an "Uncle Tom" is "the black in the
South who will hang other blacks for
whites." McCullum considers himself
an individual, claiming, "You're a man
if you carry yourself like one."
Perhaps other blacks look askance
at McCullum because he is not a rebel.

He works within a system; he is, as he
puts it "a first class servant," but he

McCullum doesn't have to cook

has taught assistant chefs Oliver Bruce
and John Thomas to act on their own
"and dinner is mainly short orders."
'Moonlighting'
Unless a large party presents itself,
McCullum is off to his next
job—cooking in the Highway Patrol
barracks, "just moonlighting." In his
"spare" time, he sells panty hose and
costume jewelry door to door.
"I like to do all this," McCullum
claims. "It's not just the money,
because I can live comfortably off
Stanford's salary plus my Army
pension, but I can't sit still all day. I
don't drink, don't gamble, don't

smoke, I don't shoot pool and I'm too
old to chase the girls, so I'm happy
doing what I do."
In the midst of all he does, Big
Daddy recently proposed to share his
talents, teaching this reporter some
cooking secrets.
Having watched the Galloping
Gourmet, opened a can of
Franco-American Spaghetti and
successfully prepared a Swanson TV
Dinner, I figured that if George
Plimpton could be a "Paper Lion,"
then "Big Dobby'could act as a "Paper

who has held his post for 13 years,
says "friction is nothing unusual. It is
very common." He claims that certain
employees are "set in their ways."
Yet, Aguilar agrees that "harmony" is
necessary. "We should settle down and
try to establish loyalty to one
another."
McCullum explains that he sees
hope for improvement. "It will get
better. It has to. You couldn't go no
lower." He'says that he manages to
"overlook" and "ignore a lot of things
I should holler about. If I was a cocky
man, I'd be fighting everyday. But I'm
not like this."
Class Level
Big Daddy has spent much of his
life trying to improve racial relations.
'I don't believe in discrimination or
prejudice," he says, "but I do believe
in class. If you belong at a certain
level, regardless of your color or
nationality, you should live on this
level."
He says he never picks friends on
the basis of color. "It's how you treat
a person that counts and how he treats
you." McCullum believes that most
people do judge others by this
criterion—even Southern bigots.
He remembers an incident in
Mississippi where he cooked for a man,
who, each Christmas, sent his mother a

turkey.
"Then, one day, he told me to go
to the car and bring some bags in. I
opened the trunk up and saw a Ku
Klux Klan uniform complete with the
hood. I took off."
Friendship
But, McCullum states, the man
tried to convince him of his friendship.
"He talked to me for a week till I
overcame that fear. He said 'You're
one of the family. We love you, Mac.'
and they did."
McCullum says the man even gave
him $50 dollars to come to California
and "every year till the day he died, he
sent my mama a nice present."
McCullum admits this is strange but
again claims, "If you treat anybody
right, if they're any kind of decent
person, they'll accept you."
'Uncle Tom' Image?
Big Daddy says that blacks who eat
at the Faculty Club frequently refuse
to speak with him because they believe
he represents the "Uncle Tom" image.
But, to him, an "Uncle Tom" means
"any man that gets to be a certain age
and pulls off his hat to say, 'yes,
ma'am, yes, sir,' no matter what. He
has lowered himself as a man and his
standards of living. He was taught
this." «
McCullum says the extreme case of
an "Uncle Tom" is "the black in the
South who will hang other blacks for
whites." McCullum considers himself
an individual, claiming, "You're a man
if you carry yourself like one."
Perhaps other blacks look askance
at McCullum because he is not a rebel.

He works within a system; he is, as he
puts it "a first class servant," but he
works for a purpose.
Marching, Not Violence
McCullum, who helped start an
NAACP chapter in New York, believes
in "marching but not violence. That
only shows ignorance." And he
believes that knowledge is the black
man's greatest weapon in the fight for
equality. "What we need now is
education. I want my kids to go to
school. I'll die for this."
Big Daddy is dedicated to putting
his five children through college; in
fact, he probably works himself too
hard. But he says he wouldn't trade
places with anyone.
In a typical day, he arrives at
Stanford at 6 a.m. He bakes fresh
bread, makes soup, plans and cooks
the day's meals. By 1:30 p.m., he is
done—at Stanford.
McCullum doesn't have to cook
dinner at the Faculty Club because he
has taught assistant chefs Oliver Bruce
and John Thomas to act on their own
"and dinner is mainly short orders."
'Moonlighting'
Unless a large party presents itself,
McCullum is off to his next
job—cooking in the Highway Patrol
barracks, "just moonlighting." In his
"spare" time, he sells panty hose and
costume jewelry door to door.
"I like to do all this," McCullum
claims. "It's not just the money,
because I can live comfortably off
Stanford's salary plus my Army
pension, but I can't sit still all day. I
don't drink, don't gamble, don't

smoke, I don't shoot pool and I'm too
old to chase the girls, so I'm happy
doing what I do."
In the midst of all he does, Big
Daddy recently proposed to share his
talents, teaching this reporter some
cooking secrets.
Having watched the Galloping
Gourmet, opened a can of
Franco-American Spaghetti and
successfully prepared a Swanson TV
Dinner, I figured that if George
Plimpton could be a "Paper Lion,"
then "Big Dobby'could act as a "Paper
Chef."
And so on a warm July morning, I
donned complete chef's gear and
entered the kitchen.
'Anybody Can Cook'
Mac allowed me to simmer his
barbequed franks, and even to pour
gravy over braised short ribs.
"Anybody can cook," he advised.
"Take a pot of clear water, get it hot,
put two slices of onion in, season the
water with salt and pepper and you
have onion soup. It's all that easy." So
I asked if I could try. But Big Daddy
knew better.
Gazing at the gravy stains on my
arm and the trembling ladle in my
hand, he said, "Oh, it's too dangerous
to let you cook here. I did it all before
you came. We can't take any chances,
you know."
Somehow, I felt relieved by his
statement, yet still unfulfilled. But he
had the answer to that problem too:
"Let me cook you breakfast." Big
Daddy had indeed made "Big Klutz"
an offer he could not refuse.

"BIG DOBBY"—Complete in chef's get-up, reporter George Dobbins gets into the thick of the action stirring one of
Faculty Club head chef Dave McCullum's many pots. Dobbins, who likens his style to that of George Plimpton, orovides
a perfect example of "Big Daddy's" advice: "Anybody can cook"—even "Big Dobby."
The small brick building remains a
place of mystery to most students.
The Faculty Club is well situated
amidst sheltering trees, but even if the
camouflage were not so prolific, most
students simply would never see the
spacious, luxurious interiors because
the opportunity does not exist for
them.
Instead, the club is the get-away for
visiting dignitaries and Stanford
professors and administration officials.
It is here they come to relax. And
relax they do.
The atmosphere is friendly.
Hotel-type accomodations are
available for guests. Staff personnel
make the short walk from their
offices.
But perhaps the greatest drawing
card is the food. Thanks to a staff of
14 regular workers and 35 students,
Stanford professors and administration
officials are among the best fed in the
nation.
And the bulk of the credit for that
goes to Dave McCullum, the
53-year-old chief chef, clad in
immaculate white clothing.

good-natured and somewhat
reminiscent of comic Redd Foxx both
in speech and mannerisms.
Two Goals
Throughout his life, he has pursued
two goals: to become an unsurpassed
cook; and in the process, to make
friends.
According to former Faculty Club
president Nathan Maccoby, McCullum
has succeeded on both counts.
Maccoby calls the chef "wonderful"
and "warm," while at the same time
commending the quality of the food
he prepares: "This facility is known as
one of the best restaurants this side of
San Francisco, and Dave is in no small
measure responsible."
McCullum refers to himself as "just
an ordinary Joe." Spending $3000 a
week for food, serving 200-300 guests
a day for lunch and 350 for dinner,
and preparing everything from
barbequed franks to coq au vin is all in
the line of work.
His friends call him by his
nickname, "Big Daddy," which he
acquired in the Army when he
weighed 295 pounds. Although now,
only 225 pounds. Big Daddy obviously

loves eating as much as cooking.
He likes "seafood, scallops, cat
fish—that's the Southern in me. I like
hot biscuits too. And I don't eat too
much soul food because of my blood
pressure."
'Got To Have Feeling'
What makes McCullum a good
cook? "You got to have feeling. Now,
I can take and teach you everything I
know about cooking, but if you can't
enjoy it, you still won't function right.
If you know how you want to taste
your food, feel your food; then it
comes out right."
McCullum says he knows of no
cook who's "any good" that hates
cooking. He claims that "85 percent of
all cooks are alcoholics. It's their
nerves," but McCullum does not
include himself in that category—"at
least not yet," he says with a smile.
McCullum believes that eating
should be an experience—he's against
the idea of "dining" becoming
"feeding." He cares about pleasing
people and that concern comes
through in his philosophy of life.
Understanding
Trite though it may sound, he

admits, he lives by the slogan, "Try to
understand and respect people and
they respect you the same way."
McCullum puts his "don't hate,
communicate" preaching into practice
in the best way he knows—teaching
people to cook.
He taught in Ohio at Wesleyan
University and at Southern University.
Besides writing his popular regular
recipe column for the Daily,
McCullum would like to teach a class
at Stanford because "people could
really benefit. A good cook is hard to
find and so many kids today would
love to jump at the chance three hours
a day to learn this."
But Big Daddy says this seems
unlikely because of a lack of time on
his part and of interest on the part of
University officials.
Though McCullum doesn't teach
cooking here, his efforts to make
friends remain constant. And he has
gained the confidence of many a
student. One coed recently came to
him with a request to help her remove
unwanted fraternity members who
were crashing a party. Big Daddy

head chef at the Faculty club, displays some of his wares.
complied. McCullum says that nothing
is beyond his jurisdiction or interest
when it comes to helping a friend.
When school closed in June,
McCullum not only received 21 cards
and three bouquets of flowers from
students, but one girl bought him a
cake and another worked with her
mother to bake him one.
McCullum has not always been well
liked—he has in fact led a rough
existence in which people have
shunned him simply because of his
color.
Big Daddy began earning his keep
at age 15 as a fry cook in Newlton, La.
Receiving $15 every two weeks, he
then moved on to a hotel—still a fry
cook. In 1938, he headed for Los
Angeles, attending Jefferson High
School while working at the Statler
Hilton as a fry cook.
But here he got a break: "The chef
took a liking to me. He got me a better
job at the Larkey Cafeteria. Later he
called and told me he wanted to put
me in school."
The chef helped send McCullum to
the Hemphill Institute for chefs. There
McCullum met his first signs of
prejudice, "more than I had found in
the South. I caught hell out there. We
had 150 students and I was the only
black, the second black ever to attend
the school.
"Those that would talk to me were
afraid of the bullies, the ones who
pushed them. 'Don't fool with that
nigger,' and so on." But McCullum
stayed through his first semester
because the instructor told him, "I
want you to stick it out."
He soon began an 18-year stint in
the Army. But, "I never did cook in
the Army. I cooked on the outside in
private jobs." Inside, McCullum spent
seven years as a military policeman. He
recalls racial strife: "The black
members of the military police

couldn't even carry a gun or arrest a
white soldier, but white soldiers
carried guns and could beat black
soldiers to death and it would be
all right."
So McCullum, who played the organ
in a Catholic church back home,
became a music instructor in the
Army. In 1966, he was honorably
discharged. "I made a career out of the
Army," states the husky chef.
After the Army, McCullum worked
at various schools including Ohio
State, Wesleyan, Howard, Southern
University and Mississippi State, and at
such restaurants as the Statler Hilton
and even Howard Johnson's.
Vacation, Incentive
McCullum, who has been head chef
at Stanford for 17 months, got his job
thanks to a vacation and some
incentive on his part.
"I came out to visit my aunt in
Oakland and a union representative
told me about Arturo| Lionetti, former
head chef| having trouble down here.
I talked to him, he sent me to
Personnel, where we worked out an
agreement and I came to work."
McCullum says Stanford's kitchen
is, most importantly, "clean" and
contains "every kind of convenience.
Anything that you need to buy is
okay—no one will stop you, from pots
and pans to food."
Life and Death
Big Daddy claims that the
facilities are "very safe" but
remembers a time over 10 years ago at
Cleveland's Carter Hotel when kitchen
equipment was indeed a matter of life
and death, with an emphasis on death.
He tells of a 28-year-old French
chef who opened a stove filled with
gas, which ignited on contact with the
kitchen heat.
"He opened that stove and blew his
head completely off. And he shook
that whole building. It threw me about
six to eight feet against the wall. The
man's legs were there and his feet were
kicking like a chicken. Then, his head
rolled out from underneath."
McCullum calls the incident "the
most pitiful thing I ever seen." He
himself was badly injured in the
explosion. "For a long time, I thought
I was going to lose that arm." Today,
he unbuttons his shirt to reveal the
very visible remnants of a scar.
Consequences
Big Daddy says "they don't even
allow those types of stoves anymore,
and now they have health inspectors."
Yet, he admits, he'll never forget the
consequences of using less than
modern equipment. Here, he states,
the facilities are so functional that chefs
come from other restaurants for
inspection tours. "They come here
quite regularly."
But McCullum claims that seldom
do they offer praise. "Every cook feels

he's the greatest so very few
compliments are given. They usually
criticize." However, McCullum is so
proud of his kitchen facilities that he
extends an invitation to all readers:
"Come look around anytime. Just
don't everybody rush all at once."
The only improvement necessary in
the Faculty Club kitchen, says
McCullum, is ironing out "the big
friction between black and white
employees." He has faith in the new
manager, "a good man who can
straighten things up." Yet, McCullum
emphasizes, "Up to now, it's been
hell." He says the only solution to the
"disputes" is "understanding; just stop
and listen."
McCullum points out that,
currently, black and white employees
eat lunch in separate dining rooms and
frequently, he says, there are clashes.
"You have to see it to believe it."
Habit
He claims the hostility stems not
from taught prejudice but rather habit.
"I don't think it's hate. You just
follow the leader. If a group of you all
decide everyday to discuss and talk
about your school, what can I discuss
and talk about?
"After a day or two, I run out.
When blacks get together, they have a
lot more in common to talk about.
Whites and blacks should associate
more together. They are going to
school together, working
together-they should be friends."
Assistant manager Joseph Aguilar,
who has held his post for 13 years,
says "friction is nothing unusual. It is
very common." He claims that certain
employees are "set in their ways."
Yet, Aguilar agrees that "harmony" is
necessary. "We should settle down and
try to establish loyalty to one
another."
McCullum explains that he sees
hope for improvement. "It will get
better. It has to. You couldn't go no
lower." He'says that he manages to
"overlook" and "ignore a lot of things
I should holler about. If I was a cocky
man, I'd be fighting everyday. But I'm
not like this."
Class Level
Big Daddy has spent much of his
life trying to improve racial relations.
'I don't believe in discrimination or
prejudice," he says, "but I do believe
in class. If you belong at a certain
level, regardless of your color or
nationality, you should live on this
level."
He says he never picks friends on
the basis of color. "It's how you treat
a person that counts and how he treats
you." McCullum believes that most
people do judge others by this
criterion—even Southern bigots.
He remembers an incident in
Mississippi where he cooked for a man,
who, each Christmas, sent his mother a

turkey.
"Then, one day, he told me to go
to the car and bring some bags in. I
opened the trunk up and saw a Ku
Klux Klan uniform complete with the
hood. I took off."
Friendship
But, McCullum states, the man
tried to convince him of his friendship.
"He talked to me for a week till I
overcame that fear. He said 'You're
one of the family. We love you, Mac.'
and they did."
McCullum says the man even gave
him $50 dollars to come to California
and "every year till the day he died, he
sent my mama a nice present."
McCullum admits this is strange but
again claims, "If you treat anybody
right, if they're any kind of decent
person, they'll accept you."

Big Daddy says that blacks who eat

the facilities are so functional that chefs
come from other restaurants for
inspection tours. "They come here
quite regularly."
But McCullum claims that seldom
do they offer praise. "Every cook feels

he's the greatest so very few
compliments are given. They usually
criticize." However, McCullum is so
proud of his kitchen facilities that he
extends an invitation to all readers:
"Come look around anytime. Just
don't everybody rush all at once."
The only improvement necessary in
the Faculty Club kitchen, says
McCullum, is ironing out "the big
friction between black and white
employees." He has faith in the new
manager, "a good man who can
straighten things up." Yet, McCullum
emphasizes, "Up to now, it's been
hell." He says the only solution to the
"disputes" is "understanding; just stop
and listen."
McCullum points out that,
currently, black and white employees
eat lunch in separate dining rooms and
frequently, he says, there are clashes.
"You have to see it to believe it."
Habit
He claims the hostility stems not
from taught prejudice but rather habit.
"I don't think it's hate. You just
follow the leader. If a group of you all
decide everyday to discuss and talk
about your school, what can I discuss
and talk about?
"After a day or two, I run out.
When blacks get together, they have a
lot more in common to talk about.
Whites and blacks should associate
more together. They are going to
school together, working
together-they should be friends."
Assistant manager Joseph Aguilar,
who has held his post for 13 years,
says "friction is nothing unusual. It is
very common." He claims that certain
employees are "set in their ways."
Yet, Aguilar agrees that "harmony" is
necessary. "We should settle down and
try to establish loyalty to one
another."
McCullum explains that he sees
hope for improvement. "It will get
better. It has to. You couldn't go no
lower." He'says that he manages to
"overlook" and "ignore a lot of things
I should holler about. If I was a cocky
man, I'd be fighting everyday. But I'm
not like this."
Class Level
Big Daddy has spent much of his
life trying to improve racial relations.
'I don't believe in discrimination or
prejudice," he says, "but I do believe
in class. If you belong at a certain
level, regardless of your color or
nationality, you should live on this
level."
He says he never picks friends on
the basis of color. "It's how you treat
a person that counts and how he treats
you." McCullum believes that most
people do judge others by this
criterion—even Southern bigots.
He remembers an incident in
Mississippi where he cooked for a man,
who, each Christmas, sent his mother a

turkey.
"Then, one day, he told me to go
to the car and bring some bags in. I
opened the trunk up and saw a Ku
Klux Klan uniform complete with the
hood. I took off."
Friendship
But, McCullum states, the man
tried to convince him of his friendship.
"He talked to me for a week till I
overcame that fear. He said 'You're
one of the family. We love you, Mac.'
and they did."
McCullum says the man even gave
him $50 dollars to come to California
and "every year till the day he died, he
sent my mama a nice present."
McCullum admits this is strange but
again claims, "If you treat anybody
right, if they're any kind of decent
person, they'll accept you."
'Uncle Tom' Image?
Big Daddy says that blacks who eat
at the Faculty Club frequently refuse
to speak with him because they believe
he represents the "Uncle Tom" image.
But, to him, an "Uncle Tom" means
"any man that gets to be a certain age
and pulls off his hat to say, 'yes,
ma'am, yes, sir,' no matter what. He
has lowered himself as a man and his
standards of living. He was taught
this." «
McCullum says the extreme case of
an "Uncle Tom" is "the black in the
South who will hang other blacks for
whites." McCullum considers himself
an individual, claiming, "You're a man
if you carry yourself like one."
Perhaps other blacks look askance
at McCullum because he is not a rebel.

He works within a system; he is, as he
puts it "a first class servant," but he
works for a purpose.
Marching, Not Violence
McCullum, who helped start an
NAACP chapter in New York, believes
in "marching but not violence. That
only shows ignorance." And he
believes that knowledge is the black
man's greatest weapon in the fight for
equality. "What we need now is
education. I want my kids to go to
school. I'll die for this."
Big Daddy is dedicated to putting
his five children through college; in
fact, he probably works himself too
hard. But he says he wouldn't trade
places with anyone.
In a typical day, he arrives at
Stanford at 6 a.m. He bakes fresh
bread, makes soup, plans and cooks
the day's meals. By 1:30 p.m., he is
done—at Stanford.
McCullum doesn't have to cook
dinner at the Faculty Club because he
has taught assistant chefs Oliver Bruce
and John Thomas to act on their own
"and dinner is mainly short orders."
'Moonlighting'
Unless a large party presents itself,
McCullum is off to his next
job—cooking in the Highway Patrol
barracks, "just moonlighting." In his
"spare" time, he sells panty hose and
costume jewelry door to door.
"I like to do all this," McCullum
claims. "It's not just the money,
because I can live comfortably off
Stanford's salary plus my Army
pension, but I can't sit still all day. I
don't drink, don't gamble, don't

smoke, I don't shoot pool and I'm too
old to chase the girls, so I'm happy
doing what I do."
In the midst of all he does, Big
Daddy recently proposed to share his
talents, teaching this reporter some
cooking secrets.
Having watched the Galloping
Gourmet, opened a can of
Franco-American Spaghetti and
successfully prepared a Swanson TV
Dinner, I figured that if George
Plimpton could be a "Paper Lion,"
then "Big Dobby'could act as a "Paper
Chef."
And so on a warm July morning, I
donned complete chef's gear and
entered the kitchen.
'Anybody Can Cook'
Mac allowed me to simmer his
barbequed franks, and even to pour
gravy over braised short ribs.
"Anybody can cook," he advised.
"Take a pot of clear water, get it hot,
put two slices of onion in, season the
water with salt and pepper and you
have onion soup. It's all that easy." So
I asked if I could try. But Big Daddy
knew better.
Gazing at the gravy stains on my
arm and the trembling ladle in my
hand, he said, "Oh, it's too dangerous
to let you cook here. I did it all before
you came. We can't take any chances,
you know."
Somehow, I felt relieved by his
statement, yet still unfulfilled. But he
had the answer to that problem too:
"Let me cook you breakfast." Big
Daddy had indeed made "Big Klutz"
an offer he could not refuse.

"BIG DOBBY"—Complete in chef's get-up, reporter George Dobbins gets into the thick of the action stirring one of
Faculty Club head chef Dave McCullum's many pots. Dobbins, who likens his style to that of George Plimpton, orovides
a perfect example of "Big Daddy's" advice: "Anybody can cook"—even "Big Dobby."
The small brick building remains a
place of mystery to most students.
The Faculty Club is well situated
amidst sheltering trees, but even if the
camouflage were not so prolific, most
students simply would never see the
spacious, luxurious interiors because
the opportunity does not exist for
them.
Instead, the club is the get-away for
visiting dignitaries and Stanford
professors and administration officials.
It is here they come to relax. And
relax they do.
The atmosphere is friendly.
Hotel-type accomodations are
available for guests. Staff personnel
make the short walk from their
offices.
But perhaps the greatest drawing
card is the food. Thanks to a staff of
14 regular workers and 35 students,
Stanford professors and administration
officials are among the best fed in the
nation.
And the bulk of the credit for that
goes to Dave McCullum, the
53-year-old chief chef, clad in
immaculate white clothing.

good-natured and somewhat
reminiscent of comic Redd Foxx both
in speech and mannerisms.
Two Goals
Throughout his life, he has pursued
two goals: to become an unsurpassed
cook; and in the process, to make
friends.
According to former Faculty Club
president Nathan Maccoby, McCullum
has succeeded on both counts.
Maccoby calls the chef "wonderful"
and "warm," while at the same time
commending the quality of the food
he prepares: "This facility is known as
one of the best restaurants this side of
San Francisco, and Dave is in no small
measure responsible."
McCullum refers to himself as "just
an ordinary Joe." Spending $3000 a
week for food, serving 200-300 guests
a day for lunch and 350 for dinner,
and preparing everything from
barbequed franks to coq au vin is all in
the line of work.
His friends call him by his
nickname, "Big Daddy," which he
acquired in the Army when he
weighed 295 pounds. Although now,
only 225 pounds. Big Daddy obviously

loves eating as much as cooking.
He likes "seafood, scallops, cat
fish—that's the Southern in me. I like
hot biscuits too. And I don't eat too
much soul food because of my blood
pressure."
'Got To Have Feeling'
What makes McCullum a good
cook? "You got to have feeling. Now,
I can take and teach you everything I
know about cooking, but if you can't
enjoy it, you still won't function right.
If you know how you want to taste
your food, feel your food; then it
comes out right."
McCullum says he knows of no
cook who's "any good" that hates
cooking. He claims that "85 percent of
all cooks are alcoholics. It's their
nerves," but McCullum does not
include himself in that category—"at
least not yet," he says with a smile.
McCullum believes that eating
should be an experience—he's against
the idea of "dining" becoming
"feeding." He cares about pleasing
people and that concern comes
through in his philosophy of life.
Understanding
Trite though it may sound, he

admits, he lives by the slogan, "Try to
understand and respect people and
they respect you the same way."
McCullum puts his "don't hate,
communicate" preaching into practice
in the best way he knows—teaching
people to cook.
He taught in Ohio at Wesleyan
University and at Southern University.
Besides writing his popular regular
recipe column for the Daily,
McCullum would like to teach a class
at Stanford because "people could
really benefit. A good cook is hard to
find and so many kids today would
love to jump at the chance three hours
a day to learn this."
But Big Daddy says this seems
unlikely because of a lack of time on
his part and of interest on the part of
University officials.
Though McCullum doesn't teach
cooking here, his efforts to make
friends remain constant. And he has
gained the confidence of many a
student. One coed recently came to
him with a request to help her remove
unwanted fraternity members who
were crashing a party. Big Daddy

head chef at the Faculty club, displays some of his wares.
complied. McCullum says that nothing
is beyond his jurisdiction or interest
when it comes to helping a friend.
When school closed in June,
McCullum not only received 21 cards
and three bouquets of flowers from
students, but one girl bought him a
cake and another worked with her
mother to bake him one.
McCullum has not always been well
liked—he has in fact led a rough
existence in which people have
shunned him simply because of his
color.
Big Daddy began earning his keep
at age 15 as a fry cook in Newlton, La.
Receiving $15 every two weeks, he
then moved on to a hotel—still a fry
cook. In 1938, he headed for Los
Angeles, attending Jefferson High
School while working at the Statler
Hilton as a fry cook.
But here he got a break: "The chef
took a liking to me. He got me a better
job at the Larkey Cafeteria. Later he
called and told me he wanted to put
me in school."
The chef helped send McCullum to
the Hemphill Institute for chefs. There
McCullum met his first signs of
prejudice, "more than I had found in
the South. I caught hell out there. We
had 150 students and I was the only
black, the second black ever to attend
the school.
"Those that would talk to me were
afraid of the bullies, the ones who
pushed them. 'Don't fool with that
nigger,' and so on." But McCullum
stayed through his first semester
because the instructor told him, "I
want you to stick it out."
He soon began an 18-year stint in
the Army. But, "I never did cook in
the Army. I cooked on the outside in
private jobs." Inside, McCullum spent
seven years as a military policeman. He
recalls racial strife: "The black
members of the military police

couldn't even carry a gun or arrest a
white soldier, but white soldiers
carried guns and could beat black
soldiers to death and it would be
all right."
So McCullum, who played the organ
in a Catholic church back home,
became a music instructor in the
Army. In 1966, he was honorably
discharged. "I made a career out of the
Army," states the husky chef.
After the Army, McCullum worked
at various schools including Ohio
State, Wesleyan, Howard, Southern
University and Mississippi State, and at
such restaurants as the Statler Hilton
and even Howard Johnson's.
Vacation, Incentive
McCullum, who has been head chef
at Stanford for 17 months, got his job
thanks to a vacation and some
incentive on his part.
"I came out to visit my aunt in
Oakland and a union representative
told me about Arturo| Lionetti, former
head chef| having trouble down here.
I talked to him, he sent me to
Personnel, where we worked out an
agreement and I came to work."
McCullum says Stanford's kitchen
is, most importantly, "clean" and
contains "every kind of convenience.
Anything that you need to buy is
okay—no one will stop you, from pots
and pans to food."
Life and Death
Big Daddy claims that the
facilities are "very safe" but
remembers a time over 10 years ago at
Cleveland's Carter Hotel when kitchen
equipment was indeed a matter of life
and death, with an emphasis on death.
He tells of a 28-year-old French
chef who opened a stove filled with
gas, which ignited on contact with the
kitchen heat.
"He opened that stove and blew his
head completely off. And he shook
that whole building. It threw me about
six to eight feet against the wall. The
man's legs were there and his feet were
kicking like a chicken. Then, his head
rolled out from underneath."
McCullum calls the incident "the
most pitiful thing I ever seen." He
himself was badly injured in the
explosion. "For a long time, I thought
I was going to lose that arm." Today,
he unbuttons his shirt to reveal the
very visible remnants of a scar.
Consequences
Big Daddy says "they don't even
allow those types of stoves anymore,
and now they have health inspectors."
Yet, he admits, he'll never forget the
consequences of using less than
modern equipment. Here, he states,
the facilities are so functional that chefs
come from other restaurants for
inspection tours. "They come here
quite regularly."
But McCullum claims that seldom
do they offer praise. "Every cook feels

he's the greatest so very few
compliments are given. They usually
criticize." However, McCullum is so
proud of his kitchen facilities that he
extends an invitation to all readers:
"Come look around anytime. Just
don't everybody rush all at once."
The only improvement necessary in
the Faculty Club kitchen, says
McCullum, is ironing out "the big
friction between black and white
employees." He has faith in the new
manager, "a good man who can
straighten things up." Yet, McCullum
emphasizes, "Up to now, it's been
hell." He says the only solution to the
"disputes" is "understanding; just stop
and listen."
McCullum points out that,
currently, black and white employees
eat lunch in separate dining rooms and
frequently, he says, there are clashes.
"You have to see it to believe it."
Habit
He claims the hostility stems not
from taught prejudice but rather habit.
"I don't think it's hate. You just
follow the leader. If a group of you all
decide everyday to discuss and talk
about your school, what can I discuss
and talk about?
"After a day or two, I run out.
When blacks get together, they have a
lot more in common to talk about.
Whites and blacks should associate
more together. They are going to
school together, working
together-they should be friends."
Assistant manager Joseph Aguilar,
who has held his post for 13 years,
says "friction is nothing unusual. It is
very common." He claims that certain
employees are "set in their ways."
Yet, Aguilar agrees that "harmony" is
necessary. "We should settle down and
try to establish loyalty to one
another."
McCullum explains that he sees
hope for improvement. "It will get
better. It has to. You couldn't go no
lower." He'says that he manages to
"overlook" and "ignore a lot of things
I should holler about. If I was a cocky
man, I'd be fighting everyday. But I'm
not like this."

life trying to improve racial relations.

told me about Arturo| Lionetti, former
head chef| having trouble down here.
I talked to him, he sent me to
Personnel, where we worked out an
agreement and I came to work."
McCullum says Stanford's kitchen
is, most importantly, "clean" and
contains "every kind of convenience.
Anything that you need to buy is
okay—no one will stop you, from pots
and pans to food."
Life and Death
Big Daddy claims that the
facilities are "very safe" but
remembers a time over 10 years ago at
Cleveland's Carter Hotel when kitchen
equipment was indeed a matter of life
and death, with an emphasis on death.
He tells of a 28-year-old French
chef who opened a stove filled with
gas, which ignited on contact with the
kitchen heat.
"He opened that stove and blew his
head completely off. And he shook
that whole building. It threw me about
six to eight feet against the wall. The
man's legs were there and his feet were
kicking like a chicken. Then, his head
rolled out from underneath."
McCullum calls the incident "the
most pitiful thing I ever seen." He
himself was badly injured in the
explosion. "For a long time, I thought
I was going to lose that arm." Today,
he unbuttons his shirt to reveal the
very visible remnants of a scar.
Consequences
Big Daddy says "they don't even
allow those types of stoves anymore,
and now they have health inspectors."
Yet, he admits, he'll never forget the
consequences of using less than
modern equipment. Here, he states,
the facilities are so functional that chefs
come from other restaurants for
inspection tours. "They come here
quite regularly."
But McCullum claims that seldom
do they offer praise. "Every cook feels

he's the greatest so very few
compliments are given. They usually
criticize." However, McCullum is so
proud of his kitchen facilities that he
extends an invitation to all readers:
"Come look around anytime. Just
don't everybody rush all at once."
The only improvement necessary in
the Faculty Club kitchen, says
McCullum, is ironing out "the big
friction between black and white
employees." He has faith in the new
manager, "a good man who can
straighten things up." Yet, McCullum
emphasizes, "Up to now, it's been
hell." He says the only solution to the
"disputes" is "understanding; just stop
and listen."
McCullum points out that,
currently, black and white employees
eat lunch in separate dining rooms and
frequently, he says, there are clashes.
"You have to see it to believe it."
Habit
He claims the hostility stems not
from taught prejudice but rather habit.
"I don't think it's hate. You just
follow the leader. If a group of you all
decide everyday to discuss and talk
about your school, what can I discuss
and talk about?
"After a day or two, I run out.
When blacks get together, they have a
lot more in common to talk about.
Whites and blacks should associate
more together. They are going to
school together, working
together-they should be friends."
Assistant manager Joseph Aguilar,
who has held his post for 13 years,
says "friction is nothing unusual. It is
very common." He claims that certain
employees are "set in their ways."
Yet, Aguilar agrees that "harmony" is
necessary. "We should settle down and
try to establish loyalty to one
another."
McCullum explains that he sees
hope for improvement. "It will get
better. It has to. You couldn't go no
lower." He'says that he manages to
"overlook" and "ignore a lot of things
I should holler about. If I was a cocky
man, I'd be fighting everyday. But I'm
not like this."
Class Level
Big Daddy has spent much of his
life trying to improve racial relations.
'I don't believe in discrimination or
prejudice," he says, "but I do believe
in class. If you belong at a certain
level, regardless of your color or
nationality, you should live on this
level."
He says he never picks friends on
the basis of color. "It's how you treat
a person that counts and how he treats
you." McCullum believes that most
people do judge others by this
criterion—even Southern bigots.
He remembers an incident in
Mississippi where he cooked for a man,
who, each Christmas, sent his mother a

turkey.
"Then, one day, he told me to go
to the car and bring some bags in. I
opened the trunk up and saw a Ku
Klux Klan uniform complete with the
hood. I took off."
Friendship
But, McCullum states, the man
tried to convince him of his friendship.
"He talked to me for a week till I
overcame that fear. He said 'You're
one of the family. We love you, Mac.'
and they did."
McCullum says the man even gave
him $50 dollars to come to California
and "every year till the day he died, he
sent my mama a nice present."
McCullum admits this is strange but
again claims, "If you treat anybody
right, if they're any kind of decent
person, they'll accept you."
'Uncle Tom' Image?
Big Daddy says that blacks who eat
at the Faculty Club frequently refuse
to speak with him because they believe
he represents the "Uncle Tom" image.
But, to him, an "Uncle Tom" means
"any man that gets to be a certain age
and pulls off his hat to say, 'yes,
ma'am, yes, sir,' no matter what. He
has lowered himself as a man and his
standards of living. He was taught
this." «
McCullum says the extreme case of
an "Uncle Tom" is "the black in the
South who will hang other blacks for
whites." McCullum considers himself
an individual, claiming, "You're a man
if you carry yourself like one."
Perhaps other blacks look askance
at McCullum because he is not a rebel.

He works within a system; he is, as he
puts it "a first class servant," but he
works for a purpose.
Marching, Not Violence
McCullum, who helped start an
NAACP chapter in New York, believes
in "marching but not violence. That
only shows ignorance." And he
believes that knowledge is the black
man's greatest weapon in the fight for
equality. "What we need now is
education. I want my kids to go to
school. I'll die for this."
Big Daddy is dedicated to putting
his five children through college; in
fact, he probably works himself too
hard. But he says he wouldn't trade
places with anyone.
In a typical day, he arrives at
Stanford at 6 a.m. He bakes fresh
bread, makes soup, plans and cooks
the day's meals. By 1:30 p.m., he is
done—at Stanford.
McCullum doesn't have to cook
dinner at the Faculty Club because he
has taught assistant chefs Oliver Bruce
and John Thomas to act on their own
"and dinner is mainly short orders."
'Moonlighting'
Unless a large party presents itself,
McCullum is off to his next
job—cooking in the Highway Patrol
barracks, "just moonlighting." In his
"spare" time, he sells panty hose and
costume jewelry door to door.
"I like to do all this," McCullum
claims. "It's not just the money,
because I can live comfortably off
Stanford's salary plus my Army
pension, but I can't sit still all day. I
don't drink, don't gamble, don't

smoke, I don't shoot pool and I'm too
old to chase the girls, so I'm happy
doing what I do."
In the midst of all he does, Big
Daddy recently proposed to share his
talents, teaching this reporter some
cooking secrets.
Having watched the Galloping
Gourmet, opened a can of
Franco-American Spaghetti and
successfully prepared a Swanson TV
Dinner, I figured that if George
Plimpton could be a "Paper Lion,"
then "Big Dobby'could act as a "Paper
Chef."
And so on a warm July morning, I
donned complete chef's gear and
entered the kitchen.
'Anybody Can Cook'
Mac allowed me to simmer his
barbequed franks, and even to pour
gravy over braised short ribs.
"Anybody can cook," he advised.
"Take a pot of clear water, get it hot,
put two slices of onion in, season the
water with salt and pepper and you
have onion soup. It's all that easy." So
I asked if I could try. But Big Daddy
knew better.
Gazing at the gravy stains on my
arm and the trembling ladle in my
hand, he said, "Oh, it's too dangerous
to let you cook here. I did it all before
you came. We can't take any chances,
you know."
Somehow, I felt relieved by his
statement, yet still unfulfilled. But he
had the answer to that problem too:
"Let me cook you breakfast." Big
Daddy had indeed made "Big Klutz"
an offer he could not refuse.

"BIG DOBBY"—Complete in chef's get-up, reporter George Dobbins gets into the thick of the action stirring one of
Faculty Club head chef Dave McCullum's many pots. Dobbins, who likens his style to that of George Plimpton, orovides
a perfect example of "Big Daddy's" advice: "Anybody can cook"—even "Big Dobby."
The small brick building remains a
place of mystery to most students.
The Faculty Club is well situated
amidst sheltering trees, but even if the
camouflage were not so prolific, most
students simply would never see the
spacious, luxurious interiors because
the opportunity does not exist for
them.
Instead, the club is the get-away for
visiting dignitaries and Stanford
professors and administration officials.
It is here they come to relax. And
relax they do.
The atmosphere is friendly.
Hotel-type accomodations are
available for guests. Staff personnel
make the short walk from their
offices.
But perhaps the greatest drawing
card is the food. Thanks to a staff of
14 regular workers and 35 students,
Stanford professors and administration
officials are among the best fed in the
nation.
And the bulk of the credit for that
goes to Dave McCullum, the
53-year-old chief chef, clad in
immaculate white clothing.

good-natured and somewhat
reminiscent of comic Redd Foxx both
in speech and mannerisms.
Two Goals
Throughout his life, he has pursued
two goals: to become an unsurpassed
cook; and in the process, to make
friends.
According to former Faculty Club
president Nathan Maccoby, McCullum
has succeeded on both counts.
Maccoby calls the chef "wonderful"
and "warm," while at the same time
commending the quality of the food
he prepares: "This facility is known as
one of the best restaurants this side of
San Francisco, and Dave is in no small
measure responsible."
McCullum refers to himself as "just
an ordinary Joe." Spending $3000 a
week for food, serving 200-300 guests
a day for lunch and 350 for dinner,
and preparing everything from
barbequed franks to coq au vin is all in
the line of work.
His friends call him by his
nickname, "Big Daddy," which he
acquired in the Army when he
weighed 295 pounds. Although now,
only 225 pounds. Big Daddy obviously

loves eating as much as cooking.
He likes "seafood, scallops, cat
fish—that's the Southern in me. I like
hot biscuits too. And I don't eat too
much soul food because of my blood
pressure."
'Got To Have Feeling'
What makes McCullum a good
cook? "You got to have feeling. Now,
I can take and teach you everything I
know about cooking, but if you can't
enjoy it, you still won't function right.
If you know how you want to taste
your food, feel your food; then it
comes out right."
McCullum says he knows of no
cook who's "any good" that hates
cooking. He claims that "85 percent of
all cooks are alcoholics. It's their
nerves," but McCullum does not
include himself in that category—"at
least not yet," he says with a smile.
McCullum believes that eating
should be an experience—he's against
the idea of "dining" becoming
"feeding." He cares about pleasing
people and that concern comes
through in his philosophy of life.
Understanding
Trite though it may sound, he

admits, he lives by the slogan, "Try to
understand and respect people and
they respect you the same way."
McCullum puts his "don't hate,
communicate" preaching into practice
in the best way he knows—teaching
people to cook.
He taught in Ohio at Wesleyan
University and at Southern University.
Besides writing his popular regular
recipe column for the Daily,
McCullum would like to teach a class
at Stanford because "people could
really benefit. A good cook is hard to
find and so many kids today would
love to jump at the chance three hours
a day to learn this."
But Big Daddy says this seems
unlikely because of a lack of time on
his part and of interest on the part of
University officials.
Though McCullum doesn't teach
cooking here, his efforts to make
friends remain constant. And he has
gained the confidence of many a
student. One coed recently came to
him with a request to help her remove
unwanted fraternity members who
were crashing a party. Big Daddy

head chef at the Faculty club, displays some of his wares.
complied. McCullum says that nothing
is beyond his jurisdiction or interest
when it comes to helping a friend.
When school closed in June,
McCullum not only received 21 cards
and three bouquets of flowers from
students, but one girl bought him a
cake and another worked with her
mother to bake him one.
McCullum has not always been well
liked—he has in fact led a rough
existence in which people have
shunned him simply because of his
color.
Big Daddy began earning his keep
at age 15 as a fry cook in Newlton, La.
Receiving $15 every two weeks, he
then moved on to a hotel—still a fry
cook. In 1938, he headed for Los
Angeles, attending Jefferson High
School while working at the Statler
Hilton as a fry cook.
But here he got a break: "The chef
took a liking to me. He got me a better
job at the Larkey Cafeteria. Later he
called and told me he wanted to put
me in school."
The chef helped send McCullum to
the Hemphill Institute for chefs. There
McCullum met his first signs of
prejudice, "more than I had found in
the South. I caught hell out there. We
had 150 students and I was the only
black, the second black ever to attend
the school.
"Those that would talk to me were
afraid of the bullies, the ones who
pushed them. 'Don't fool with that
nigger,' and so on." But McCullum
stayed through his first semester
because the instructor told him, "I
want you to stick it out."
He soon began an 18-year stint in
the Army. But, "I never did cook in
the Army. I cooked on the outside in
private jobs." Inside, McCullum spent
seven years as a military policeman. He
recalls racial strife: "The black
members of the military police

couldn't even carry a gun or arrest a
white soldier, but white soldiers
carried guns and could beat black
soldiers to death and it would be
all right."
So McCullum, who played the organ
in a Catholic church back home,
became a music instructor in the
Army. In 1966, he was honorably
discharged. "I made a career out of the
Army," states the husky chef.
After the Army, McCullum worked
at various schools including Ohio
State, Wesleyan, Howard, Southern
University and Mississippi State, and at
such restaurants as the Statler Hilton
and even Howard Johnson's.
Vacation, Incentive
McCullum, who has been head chef
at Stanford for 17 months, got his job
thanks to a vacation and some
incentive on his part.
"I came out to visit my aunt in
Oakland and a union representative
told me about Arturo| Lionetti, former
head chef| having trouble down here.
I talked to him, he sent me to
Personnel, where we worked out an
agreement and I came to work."
McCullum says Stanford's kitchen
is, most importantly, "clean" and
contains "every kind of convenience.
Anything that you need to buy is
okay—no one will stop you, from pots
and pans to food."
Life and Death
Big Daddy claims that the
facilities are "very safe" but
remembers a time over 10 years ago at
Cleveland's Carter Hotel when kitchen
equipment was indeed a matter of life
and death, with an emphasis on death.
He tells of a 28-year-old French
chef who opened a stove filled with
gas, which ignited on contact with the
kitchen heat.
"He opened that stove and blew his
head completely off. And he shook
that whole building. It threw me about
six to eight feet against the wall. The
man's legs were there and his feet were
kicking like a chicken. Then, his head
rolled out from underneath."
McCullum calls the incident "the
most pitiful thing I ever seen." He
himself was badly injured in the
explosion. "For a long time, I thought
I was going to lose that arm." Today,
he unbuttons his shirt to reveal the
very visible remnants of a scar.
Consequences
Big Daddy says "they don't even
allow those types of stoves anymore,
and now they have health inspectors."
Yet, he admits, he'll never forget the
consequences of using less than
modern equipment. Here, he states,
the facilities are so functional that chefs
come from other restaurants for
inspection tours. "They come here
quite regularly."
But McCullum claims that seldom
do they offer praise. "Every cook feels

he's the greatest so very few
compliments are given. They usually
criticize." However, McCullum is so
proud of his kitchen facilities that he
extends an invitation to all readers:
"Come look around anytime. Just
don't everybody rush all at once."
The only improvement necessary in
the Faculty Club kitchen, says
McCullum, is ironing out "the big
friction between black and white
employees." He has faith in the new
manager, "a good man who can
straighten things up." Yet, McCullum
emphasizes, "Up to now, it's been
hell." He says the only solution to the
"disputes" is "understanding; just stop
and listen."
McCullum points out that,
currently, black and white employees
eat lunch in separate dining rooms and
frequently, he says, there are clashes.
"You have to see it to believe it."

He claims the hostility stems not
from taught prejudice but rather habit.
"I don't think it's hate. You just

prejudice, "more than I had found in
the South. I caught hell out there. We
had 150 students and I was the only
black, the second black ever to attend
the school.
"Those that would talk to me were
afraid of the bullies, the ones who
pushed them. 'Don't fool with that
nigger,' and so on." But McCullum
stayed through his first semester
because the instructor told him, "I
want you to stick it out."
He soon began an 18-year stint in
the Army. But, "I never did cook in
the Army. I cooked on the outside in
private jobs." Inside, McCullum spent
seven years as a military policeman. He
recalls racial strife: "The black
members of the military police

couldn't even carry a gun or arrest a
white soldier, but white soldiers
carried guns and could beat black
soldiers to death and it would be
all right."
So McCullum, who played the organ
in a Catholic church back home,
became a music instructor in the
Army. In 1966, he was honorably
discharged. "I made a career out of the
Army," states the husky chef.
After the Army, McCullum worked
at various schools including Ohio
State, Wesleyan, Howard, Southern
University and Mississippi State, and at
such restaurants as the Statler Hilton
and even Howard Johnson's.
Vacation, Incentive
McCullum, who has been head chef
at Stanford for 17 months, got his job
thanks to a vacation and some
incentive on his part.
"I came out to visit my aunt in
Oakland and a union representative
told me about Arturo| Lionetti, former
head chef| having trouble down here.
I talked to him, he sent me to
Personnel, where we worked out an
agreement and I came to work."
McCullum says Stanford's kitchen
is, most importantly, "clean" and
contains "every kind of convenience.
Anything that you need to buy is
okay—no one will stop you, from pots
and pans to food."
Life and Death
Big Daddy claims that the
facilities are "very safe" but
remembers a time over 10 years ago at
Cleveland's Carter Hotel when kitchen
equipment was indeed a matter of life
and death, with an emphasis on death.
He tells of a 28-year-old French
chef who opened a stove filled with
gas, which ignited on contact with the
kitchen heat.
"He opened that stove and blew his
head completely off. And he shook
that whole building. It threw me about
six to eight feet against the wall. The
man's legs were there and his feet were
kicking like a chicken. Then, his head
rolled out from underneath."
McCullum calls the incident "the
most pitiful thing I ever seen." He
himself was badly injured in the
explosion. "For a long time, I thought
I was going to lose that arm." Today,
he unbuttons his shirt to reveal the
very visible remnants of a scar.
Consequences
Big Daddy says "they don't even
allow those types of stoves anymore,
and now they have health inspectors."
Yet, he admits, he'll never forget the
consequences of using less than
modern equipment. Here, he states,
the facilities are so functional that chefs
come from other restaurants for
inspection tours. "They come here
quite regularly."
But McCullum claims that seldom
do they offer praise. "Every cook feels

he's the greatest so very few
compliments are given. They usually
criticize." However, McCullum is so
proud of his kitchen facilities that he
extends an invitation to all readers:
"Come look around anytime. Just
don't everybody rush all at once."
The only improvement necessary in
the Faculty Club kitchen, says
McCullum, is ironing out "the big
friction between black and white
employees." He has faith in the new
manager, "a good man who can
straighten things up." Yet, McCullum
emphasizes, "Up to now, it's been
hell." He says the only solution to the
"disputes" is "understanding; just stop
and listen."
McCullum points out that,
currently, black and white employees
eat lunch in separate dining rooms and
frequently, he says, there are clashes.
"You have to see it to believe it."
Habit
He claims the hostility stems not
from taught prejudice but rather habit.
"I don't think it's hate. You just
follow the leader. If a group of you all
decide everyday to discuss and talk
about your school, what can I discuss
and talk about?
"After a day or two, I run out.
When blacks get together, they have a
lot more in common to talk about.
Whites and blacks should associate
more together. They are going to
school together, working
together-they should be friends."
Assistant manager Joseph Aguilar,
who has held his post for 13 years,
says "friction is nothing unusual. It is
very common." He claims that certain
employees are "set in their ways."
Yet, Aguilar agrees that "harmony" is
necessary. "We should settle down and
try to establish loyalty to one
another."
McCullum explains that he sees
hope for improvement. "It will get
better. It has to. You couldn't go no
lower." He'says that he manages to
"overlook" and "ignore a lot of things
I should holler about. If I was a cocky
man, I'd be fighting everyday. But I'm
not like this."
Class Level
Big Daddy has spent much of his
life trying to improve racial relations.
'I don't believe in discrimination or
prejudice," he says, "but I do believe
in class. If you belong at a certain
level, regardless of your color or
nationality, you should live on this
level."
He says he never picks friends on
the basis of color. "It's how you treat
a person that counts and how he treats
you." McCullum believes that most
people do judge others by this
criterion—even Southern bigots.
He remembers an incident in
Mississippi where he cooked for a man,
who, each Christmas, sent his mother a

turkey.
"Then, one day, he told me to go
to the car and bring some bags in. I
opened the trunk up and saw a Ku
Klux Klan uniform complete with the
hood. I took off."
Friendship
But, McCullum states, the man
tried to convince him of his friendship.
"He talked to me for a week till I
overcame that fear. He said 'You're
one of the family. We love you, Mac.'
and they did."
McCullum says the man even gave
him $50 dollars to come to California
and "every year till the day he died, he
sent my mama a nice present."
McCullum admits this is strange but
again claims, "If you treat anybody
right, if they're any kind of decent
person, they'll accept you."
'Uncle Tom' Image?
Big Daddy says that blacks who eat
at the Faculty Club frequently refuse
to speak with him because they believe
he represents the "Uncle Tom" image.
But, to him, an "Uncle Tom" means
"any man that gets to be a certain age
and pulls off his hat to say, 'yes,
ma'am, yes, sir,' no matter what. He
has lowered himself as a man and his
standards of living. He was taught
this." «
McCullum says the extreme case of
an "Uncle Tom" is "the black in the
South who will hang other blacks for
whites." McCullum considers himself
an individual, claiming, "You're a man
if you carry yourself like one."
Perhaps other blacks look askance
at McCullum because he is not a rebel.

He works within a system; he is, as he
puts it "a first class servant," but he
works for a purpose.
Marching, Not Violence
McCullum, who helped start an
NAACP chapter in New York, believes
in "marching but not violence. That
only shows ignorance." And he
believes that knowledge is the black
man's greatest weapon in the fight for
equality. "What we need now is
education. I want my kids to go to
school. I'll die for this."
Big Daddy is dedicated to putting
his five children through college; in
fact, he probably works himself too
hard. But he says he wouldn't trade
places with anyone.
In a typical day, he arrives at
Stanford at 6 a.m. He bakes fresh
bread, makes soup, plans and cooks
the day's meals. By 1:30 p.m., he is
done—at Stanford.
McCullum doesn't have to cook
dinner at the Faculty Club because he
has taught assistant chefs Oliver Bruce
and John Thomas to act on their own
"and dinner is mainly short orders."
'Moonlighting'
Unless a large party presents itself,
McCullum is off to his next
job—cooking in the Highway Patrol
barracks, "just moonlighting." In his
"spare" time, he sells panty hose and
costume jewelry door to door.
"I like to do all this," McCullum
claims. "It's not just the money,
because I can live comfortably off
Stanford's salary plus my Army
pension, but I can't sit still all day. I
don't drink, don't gamble, don't

smoke, I don't shoot pool and I'm too
old to chase the girls, so I'm happy
doing what I do."
In the midst of all he does, Big
Daddy recently proposed to share his
talents, teaching this reporter some
cooking secrets.
Having watched the Galloping
Gourmet, opened a can of
Franco-American Spaghetti and
successfully prepared a Swanson TV
Dinner, I figured that if George
Plimpton could be a "Paper Lion,"
then "Big Dobby'could act as a "Paper
Chef."
And so on a warm July morning, I
donned complete chef's gear and
entered the kitchen.
'Anybody Can Cook'
Mac allowed me to simmer his
barbequed franks, and even to pour
gravy over braised short ribs.
"Anybody can cook," he advised.
"Take a pot of clear water, get it hot,
put two slices of onion in, season the
water with salt and pepper and you
have onion soup. It's all that easy." So
I asked if I could try. But Big Daddy
knew better.
Gazing at the gravy stains on my
arm and the trembling ladle in my
hand, he said, "Oh, it's too dangerous
to let you cook here. I did it all before
you came. We can't take any chances,
you know."
Somehow, I felt relieved by his
statement, yet still unfulfilled. But he
had the answer to that problem too:
"Let me cook you breakfast." Big
Daddy had indeed made "Big Klutz"
an offer he could not refuse.
