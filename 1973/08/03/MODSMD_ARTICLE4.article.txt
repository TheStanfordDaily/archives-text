# Arbitrator Upholds Jones Firing, Says He Had One-Year Contract
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
Arbitrator Eva Robins has denied
fired Student Center for Innovation in
Research and Education (SCIRE)
Director W. Ron Jones' grievance
against Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James L. Gibbs.
Robins' nine-page decision, dated
July 27, arrived Wednesday from New
York and ended a four-month dispute
over Jones' dismissal.
In presiding over the grievance
hearing July 2 and 3, Robins stated
she would first decide whether Jones'
appointment was for one or two
academic years.
Both Jones and University attorney
Gerald Halliglan, representing Gibbs,
agreed that only if she found that the
University hired Jones for two years
would she judge whether Gibbs had
the right to fire Jones.

Robins determined that Jones'
contract with SCIRE extended only to
his June 30, 1973 dismissal date and
made no decision on the second issue.
'Stop Date'
In his letter of appointment to
Jones, Gibbs clearly indicated a "stop
date" for Jones' employment, she said.
In that letter, Gibbs wrote,
"although your appointment is for one
year I note your willingness to serve
for two years if, at the end of the year,
you and the [SCIRE) Policy Board
mutually agree that this would be
desirable."
Jones contended that this
statement indicated the Policy Board,
and not the dean's office, would
decide whether or not he remained
with SCIRE next vear.
Robins decided, "I cannot find that
this [the statement in the letter]

meant that the dean was turning over
to the policy board the authority for
the appointment of Mr. Jones for a
second year.
"Indeed, this delegation of power
very probably is beyond the power
and authority of the dean.
'Willing To Serve'
"It is apparent that the language
meant that Mr. Jones was willing to
serve another year if both he and the
Policy Board, at the end of the first
year, thought it would be desirable,"
she stated.
Robins noted that Jones'
appointment was "short-term" and
concluded, "The University did not
reappoint him [Jones] for a second
year, and that was within the
University's right."
Although the arbitrator did not
make a decision on whether or not
Gibbs had the right to fire Jones if the
appointment had been for two years,
she commented extensively on Jones'
term as SCIRE director.
"It is my opinion that, although
Mr. Jones obviously had the ability to
work well with the students and the
capacity for handling well a part of the
position of director, his administrative
skills and his ability to meet the
legitimate needs of the University were
not sufficient," she stated.
"Witness after witness, called by
him as well as those called by the
University, point this up in their
testimony.
"Under such circumstances, it
could not in any case be considered
unreasonable or discriminatory to
deny him reappointment for a second
year," she said.

Jones said he was "disappointed in
both the decision and the eventuality
of a student program being consumed
by the University."
SCIRE is "the dean's center, and he
can do what he wants with it," Jones
said after the hearings.
Commenting on the arbitrator,
Jones told the Daily, "I liked her as a
person. She was kind to us in letting us
present our case. She was very
lenient."
The ex-SCIRE director said the
grievance would be the final step in his
attempt to regain the post with
SCIRE.
The Policy Board appointed him
"ghost director" during its last
meeting of the academic year in June.
Jones will serve in an advisory capacity
to the program while doing
independent research in"underground
education and alternative publications.'
Administrators Pleased
Gibbs, Halligan and Assistant Dean
of Undergraduate Studies B. Michael
Closson were all pleased with the
decision.
Gibbs stated he thought Robins
made "a very wise" and "fair
decision," but that he was
"disappointed" in the time lost for
finding a new SCIRE head.
The dean said he plans to meet with
the SCIRE Policy Board in September
to initiate a search for Jones'
successor. He is presently drafting a
letter to board members that "asks
each member whether he or she will
stay on."

ties with the dean's office a few days

DENIED Fired SCIRE Director Ron Jones' appeal to reverse his dismissal was
denied Wednesday by arbitrator Eva Robins. Robins ruled that Jones' contract
expired on June 30, and that Dean of Undergraduate Studies James L. Gibbs was
within his rights in declining to rehire him.
