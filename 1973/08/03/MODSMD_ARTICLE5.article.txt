# Two Thruster Malfunctions Threaten Skylab II Mission
## 
### MEADE MURPHY 
The Skylab II crew encounterd a serious problem in
the command service module that could scrub the 59-day
flight.
Although the astronauts and space station are not in
immediate jeopardy, it may be necessary to fly a rescue
mission to bring them home earlier than previously
planned.
For the moment, mission control officials at the
Lyndon B. Johnson Manned Space Center in Houston, say
the astronauts will remain in space for theentirescheduled
59 days.
But officials are keeping a close watch on signs from
the spacecraft's machinery.
The astronauts—Alan L. Bean, Stanford Prof. Owen K.
Garriott and Jack R. Lousma—had received the go-ahead
to begin experiments Wednesday, after they had
recovered from a bout of motion sickness which had
plagued them since launch Saturday.
Backlog
The astronauts were resting form the first rush to
complete the backlog of experiments when the trouble
was discovered.
The master alarm system was triggered by a loss in
pressure and temperature in a jet thruster on the
command module. Garriott defrosted the thruster with a
heater and then disconnected it from the rest of the
spacecraft maneuvering system.
Thrusters of this type control pitch, yaw, and roll of
the spacecraft. They are used to make minor corrections
in the re-entry trajectory, and in the spacecraft's altitude
and position to the earth.
Malfunctions
The loss of one thruster would not be greatly noticed.
However, last Saturday during docl ing maneuvers,

another thruster malfunctioned in a similar way.
With both systems inoperative, the command module is
left with only half of its maneuvering ability. Top Skylab
officials yesterday met to discuss the problem. An
oxidizer leak caused the malfunction of both thrusters,
and since the systems are connected there is a possibility
for further failure that cannot be ignored.
Skylab Rescue Mission?
Christopher C. Kraft, director of the Johnson Space
Center in Houston, announced that launch crews at Cape
Kennedy, Fla., were preparing the Skylab 111 rocket and
command module in case a rescue mission is needed.
The rescue rocket would be the Saturn IB that was to
have flown up to the station Nov. 9. The earliest launch
date will be Sept. 10, flight director Charles Lewis
announced.
Two of the Skylab 111 astronauts, Gerald P. Carr and
William R. Poague would fly the rescue mission and return
in an Apollo modified to carry five men.
Medical Experiments
Meanwhile, Garriott will continue medical
experiments that will provide added information as to
whether the astronauts can endure the lengthy flight. One
of the experiments tests how the vestibular system
(governing balance) operates under non-gravity
conditions.
The space walk, first planned for Tuesday and now
postponed three times, will be conducted no earlier than
Sunday, as tests on the thruster take up most of the
crew's time.
On Sunday, Garriott and Lousma will unfurl a new,
sturdier sunshr.de to keep the workshop cool. Film
cartridges will also be loaded into the solar telescopes for
the photo-astronomy experiments.

have flown up to the station Nov. 9. The earliest launch
date will be Sept. 10, flight director Charles Lewis
announced.
Two of the Skylab 111 astronauts, Gerald P. Carr and
William R. Poague would fly the rescue mission and return
in an Apollo modified to carry five men.
Medical Experiments
Meanwhile, Garriott will continue medical
experiments that will provide added information as to
whether the astronauts can endure the lengthy flight. One
of the experiments tests how the vestibular system
(governing balance) operates under non-gravity
conditions.
The space walk, first planned for Tuesday and now
postponed three times, will be conducted no earlier than
Sunday, as tests on the thruster take up most of the
crew's time.
On Sunday, Garriott and Lousma will unfurl a new,
sturdier sunshr.de to keep the workshop cool. Film
cartridges will also be loaded into the solar telescopes for
the photo-astronomy experiments.
The Skylab II crew encounterd a serious problem in
the command service module that could scrub the 59-day
flight.
Although the astronauts and space station are not in
immediate jeopardy, it may be necessary to fly a rescue
mission to bring them home earlier than previously
planned.
For the moment, mission control officials at the
Lyndon B. Johnson Manned Space Center in Houston, say
the astronauts will remain in space for theentirescheduled
59 days.
But officials are keeping a close watch on signs from
the spacecraft's machinery.
The astronauts—Alan L. Bean, Stanford Prof. Owen K.
Garriott and Jack R. Lousma—had received the go-ahead
to begin experiments Wednesday, after they had
recovered from a bout of motion sickness which had
plagued them since launch Saturday.
Backlog
The astronauts were resting form the first rush to
complete the backlog of experiments when the trouble
was discovered.
The master alarm system was triggered by a loss in
pressure and temperature in a jet thruster on the
command module. Garriott defrosted the thruster with a
heater and then disconnected it from the rest of the
spacecraft maneuvering system.
Thrusters of this type control pitch, yaw, and roll of
the spacecraft. They are used to make minor corrections
in the re-entry trajectory, and in the spacecraft's altitude
and position to the earth.
Malfunctions
The loss of one thruster would not be greatly noticed.
However, last Saturday during docl ing maneuvers,

another thruster malfunctioned in a similar way.
With both systems inoperative, the command module is
left with only half of its maneuvering ability. Top Skylab
officials yesterday met to discuss the problem. An
oxidizer leak caused the malfunction of both thrusters,
and since the systems are connected there is a possibility
for further failure that cannot be ignored.
Skylab Rescue Mission?
Christopher C. Kraft, director of the Johnson Space
Center in Houston, announced that launch crews at Cape
Kennedy, Fla., were preparing the Skylab 111 rocket and
command module in case a rescue mission is needed.
The rescue rocket would be the Saturn IB that was to
have flown up to the station Nov. 9. The earliest launch
date will be Sept. 10, flight director Charles Lewis
announced.
