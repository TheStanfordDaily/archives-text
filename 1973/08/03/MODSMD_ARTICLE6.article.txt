Less Vitriolic
Editor:
Tuesday's Daily (July 31) ran
an article on various SEIU union
strikes and negotiations
underway. United Stanford
Employees (USE) was included,
and I am concerned that the
article conveys a more vitriolic

stance than we wish to
communicate at this time. Let us
just start over on the subjects
reported.
USE has been frustrated at the
difficulty of getting over a couple
of hurdles preliminary to
negotiation: namely employee
time off the job for bargaining,
and office space on campus. Our
position has been that the union is
now a legal and legitimate
employee organizationâ€”internally

funded by workers at Stanford.
Just as other University
committees and units of faculty,
students, and staff already meet
for reasonable periods and in
reasonable space, similarly USE
members ought to meet with
management and be housed here
without charge.
We ought not to be billed as if
we were funded by outside money
from HEW, the Defense
Department, or the Bank of
America. The University disputes
this argument, and USE remains
dissatisfied with their response to
these two hurdles. But to broadly
charge "foot dragging" may not
accurately characterize our
frustration.
The University bargaining team
will be unavailable for several

weeks, and their absence is read as
a symbolic precedent by some.
But such an interpretation has
little basis in fact. The team did
discuss their vacation plans with
us, and USE expressed no serious
objections.
I would retract the charge that
"their delay is very questionable
in law" because it almost says
"their delay is obvious and
illegal." Neither of these can be
substantiated to date. It is true
that both parties are bound to
"bargain in good faith," by the
National Labor Relations Act. We
do intend to scrutinize
management's pattern of
negotiation with reference to the
spirit and letter of the Act.
