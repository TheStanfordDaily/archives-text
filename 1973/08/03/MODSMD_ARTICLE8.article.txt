# Auto Anti-Pollution Devices
## Detroit's 'Converter’ Inferior 
###

This past Monday, the Environmental Protection
Agency granted the three largest auto manufacturers
the one year reprieve they had sought from the
tough 1976 emission standard for nitrogen oxides.
Acting EPA administrator Robert Fri granted the
delay after two weeks of hearings because "no
one—manufacturer, supplier, or anyone
else—presented evidence that the (nitrogen oxide)
standards could be met by 1976."
He continued, "Since I do not think technology
(to meet the standard) is available, I believe
substantial disruption would occur if I denied the
suspension."
Last April, former EPA director William
Ruckelshaus gave the automakers an additional year
to comply with the 1975 emission standards for
hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide after the
industry had vociferously expressed its inability to
meet the regulations.
Interim Standards
Thp decisions, however, require the industry to
meet interim standards for each of the three
pollutants during the respective grace periods.
Although both decisions were favorable to
Detroit, reaction among industry executives has
been cool. General Motors, for example, resumed
lobbying in Congress this week to re-write the 1970
Clean Air Act—which establishes the emission
criteria--into a form which would impose less
stringent regulations for several more years.
Ford Motor Company declared, "We don't know
whether we can meet the combination of standards
for 1976."
Japanese Comply
Protests voiced by the American automobile
manufacturers would be more credible were it not
for two Japanese firms who have already developed
"mass-produceable" cars which comply with the
original 1975 standards and are on the verge of
meeting the old 1976 criteria.
Toyo Kogyo, manufacturers of the Mazda,
declared in testimony before the Senate Public
Works Committee in May that their car will not
only meet the tough 1975 hydrocarbon-carbon
monoxide standards, but will also comply with the
stringent 1975 California standards for nitrogen
oxides.
The Mazda uses the Wankel engine which is
smaller, more efficient, and has fewer moving parts
than conventional automobile power plants. While it
is not a 'clean' engine, its emissions can be
controlled through the use of a thermal reactor.
Honda's Solution
Honda has shown even more impressive progress

in developing a low-polluting power source. Last
October the company announced it was the first to
meet 1975 criteria and accomplished the task using
the stratified charge engine. In contrast to the
conventional or Wankel engines, the stratified
charge is a relatively 'clean' engine and thereby
needs no devices to cut its emissions to acceptable
levels.
Detroit's big four have taken a different
approach to solving the emissions problem. Besides
crying to Congress and the EPA, they have invested
millions of dollars and devoted the major thrust of
their anti-pollution efforts toward the catalytic
converter.
By using this approach, the auto-makers will be
able to continue marketing essentially the same
"dirty"engines while relying upon the catalyst to
change the three poisonous pollutants into harmless
gases and water.
Catalytic Problems
The problem is no one has yet discovered a
combination that will both effect the desired
reduction in pollutants and last for several years. In
addition, the catalysts will be expensive (around
$230), will reduce gas mileage, and will quickly be
rendered useless if contaminated with lead (a
common gasoline additive currently used to raise
octane).
In a report issued in February, an investigative
committee of the National Academy of Sciences
concluded in part, "the system most likely to be
available in 1976 in the greatest numbers—the dual
catalyst system—is the most disadvantageous with
respect to first cost, fuel economy, maintainability
and durability.
"On the other hand, the most promising
system—the carbureted stratified charge
engine—which may not be available in very large
numbers in 1976, is superior in all these categories."
Ford Motor Company President lacocca said last
February the auto industry had been "backed to the
edge of desperation by the 1975 requirements.
General Motors (which just announced a record
$1.6 billion profit for last quarter) declared the new
interim standards for nitrogen oxides "are beyond
our current technology for mass production."
Meanwhile, Honda, a comparatively small
company which spent all of $50 million on
developing the stratified charge engine, quietly
continues work on cutting emission levels down to
1976 .. . no, 1977 standards.

criteria--into a form which would impose less
stringent regulations for several more years.
Ford Motor Company declared, "We don't know
whether we can meet the combination of standards
for 1976."
Japanese Comply
Protests voiced by the American automobile
manufacturers would be more credible were it not
for two Japanese firms who have already developed
"mass-produceable" cars which comply with the
original 1975 standards and are on the verge of
meeting the old 1976 criteria.
Toyo Kogyo, manufacturers of the Mazda,
declared in testimony before the Senate Public
Works Committee in May that their car will not
only meet the tough 1975 hydrocarbon-carbon
monoxide standards, but will also comply with the
stringent 1975 California standards for nitrogen
oxides.
The Mazda uses the Wankel engine which is
smaller, more efficient, and has fewer moving parts
than conventional automobile power plants. While it
is not a 'clean' engine, its emissions can be
controlled through the use of a thermal reactor.
Honda's Solution
Honda has shown even more impressive progress

in developing a low-polluting power source. Last
October the company announced it was the first to
meet 1975 criteria and accomplished the task using
the stratified charge engine. In contrast to the
conventional or Wankel engines, the stratified
charge is a relatively 'clean' engine and thereby
needs no devices to cut its emissions to acceptable
levels.
Detroit's big four have taken a different
approach to solving the emissions problem. Besides
crying to Congress and the EPA, they have invested
millions of dollars and devoted the major thrust of
their anti-pollution efforts toward the catalytic
converter.
By using this approach, the auto-makers will be
able to continue marketing essentially the same
"dirty"engines while relying upon the catalyst to
change the three poisonous pollutants into harmless
gases and water.
Catalytic Problems
The problem is no one has yet discovered a
combination that will both effect the desired
reduction in pollutants and last for several years. In
addition, the catalysts will be expensive (around
$230), will reduce gas mileage, and will quickly be
rendered useless if contaminated with lead (a
common gasoline additive currently used to raise
octane).
In a report issued in February, an investigative
committee of the National Academy of Sciences
concluded in part, "the system most likely to be
available in 1976 in the greatest numbers—the dual
catalyst system—is the most disadvantageous with
respect to first cost, fuel economy, maintainability
and durability.
"On the other hand, the most promising
system—the carbureted stratified charge
engine—which may not be available in very large
numbers in 1976, is superior in all these categories."
Ford Motor Company President lacocca said last
February the auto industry had been "backed to the
edge of desperation by the 1975 requirements.
General Motors (which just announced a record
$1.6 billion profit for last quarter) declared the new
interim standards for nitrogen oxides "are beyond
our current technology for mass production."
Meanwhile, Honda, a comparatively small
company which spent all of $50 million on
developing the stratified charge engine, quietly
continues work on cutting emission levels down to
1976 .. . no, 1977 standards.

This past Monday, the Environmental Protection
Agency granted the three largest auto manufacturers
the one year reprieve they had sought from the
tough 1976 emission standard for nitrogen oxides.
Acting EPA administrator Robert Fri granted the
delay after two weeks of hearings because "no
one—manufacturer, supplier, or anyone
else—presented evidence that the (nitrogen oxide)
standards could be met by 1976."
He continued, "Since I do not think technology
(to meet the standard) is available, I believe
substantial disruption would occur if I denied the
suspension."
Last April, former EPA director William
Ruckelshaus gave the automakers an additional year
to comply with the 1975 emission standards for
hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide after the
industry had vociferously expressed its inability to
meet the regulations.
Interim Standards
Thp decisions, however, require the industry to
meet interim standards for each of the three
pollutants during the respective grace periods.
Although both decisions were favorable to
Detroit, reaction among industry executives has
been cool. General Motors, for example, resumed
