In the Matter of the Hearing on the Grievance of
W.RON JONES OPINION OF
against HEARING OFFICER
STANFORD UNIVERSITY (Decision Attached)
BEFORE: Eva Robins, Hearing Officer
APPEARANCES:
For the Grievant: W. Ron Jones and Elizabeth Ann
Walker, Grievance Representative.
For the University: Gerald M. Halligan, Esq., Assist
ant Staff Counsel to the President.
The following issues were submitted to me for final
and binding decision, under the applicable provisions of
Guide Memo 22.10 (I 2/1/71) of the University:
1. Whether the appointment of W. Ron Jones as
Director of the Student Center for Innovation and
Research in Education (herein. SCIRE) was for
one or two years, considering all the surrounding
circumstances.
2. If the appointment is found to have been for
two years, whether or not the notification to VV.
Ron Jones that he would not be reappointed as
Director of SCIRE for the 1973-74 academic year
was an unreasonable or discriminatory application
of University policy.
Hearings were held before me at the University on
July 2 and July 3, 1973, at which the parties appeared
and were afforded opportunity to present evidence,
testimony and argument in support of their respective
contentions. Witnesses testified under oath.
The University sought to have a decision on Issue No.
I before any evidence or testimony was taken on Issue
No. 2. I was unwilling to make a bench decision on that
issue. To avoid a second series of hearings if I should
find that Mr. Jones was hired for two years, the Univer
sity agreed to proceed on both issues, scriatum, and

evidence, testimony and argument were presented on
both. It was understood by the Grievant and the Univer
sity that 1 would decide Issue No. 1 first and only if I
found that the circumstances here equated to a two-year
appointment would 1 then go on to decide Issue No. 2.
Facts and Positions of the Grievant and the
University
W. Ron Jones was appointed Director of SCIRE by
the Dean of Undergraduate Studies, James L. Gibbs, Jr.,
by letter dated September 1, 1972 (Grievant's Ex. 3).
Mr. Jones was not reappointed for the academic year
1973-74. It is this failure to reappoint which Mr. Jones
considers an unwarranted dismissal, which he grieved.
The appointment letter of September 1. 1972, spe
cifically refers to the appointment as being for the
academic year, which is defined in the letter as a "ten
month" appointment from September I, 1972, through
June 30, 1973. The letter also includes the following
pa ragraph:
"Although your appointment is for one year I
note your willingness to serve for two years if, at
the end of the year, you and the Policy Board
mutually agree that this would be desirable."
Dean Gibbs' letter to the members of the SCIRE
Policy Board, dated August 29, 1972 (Grievant's Ex. 2)
stated in part:
As you undoubtedly know by now, in June our
office accepted the recommendation of the Policy
Board and appointed W. Ron Jones as the Director
of SCIRE beginning 1 September, 1972. . . .
"In making Ron Jones' appointment, I have
stressed the importance of continuity in leadership
for SCIRE. Mr. Jones also feels that continuity is
important and has agreed to do his best to commit
himself to the Directorship for two years if, at the
end of this academic year both Ron and the Policy
Board see this as desirable. " (Emphasis mine)
That letter went on to explain to the Policy Board what
Dean Gibbs hoped the Board would do in defining Mr.
Jones' responsibilities and setting the goals it would like
him to achieve. He stated that "the relationship between
Ron Jones and the Board is likely to be most productive
if the Board will provide some direction, being as clear as
it can be about its expectations concerning the Direc
tor's role."
The Policy Board of SCIRE consists of 1 I voting
members appointed by the Dean, of which 6 are student
members appointed from nominees provided by ASSU,
and 5 are members of the Academic Council. The Dean
and the Director of SCIRE serve ex officio without vote.
The Charge to SCIRE (Grievant's Ex. 4) attempts to
legislate governance for SCIRE and the power and re
sponsibilities of its components. Paragraph 3 of the
Charge states:
"The Dean of Undergraduate Studies shall appoint
the Director of SCIRE with advice from a faculty
student search committee appointed by the Dean
in consultation with the Policy Board, using a set
of criteria established by the Dean after consulta
tion with the Board."
The University considers that this was a fixed-term
appointment as described in University Guide Memo
22.8, of June I, 1969, and as such it is within the
University's right not to reappoint for additional terms
of employment. Paragraph 2b of 22.8 reads as follows:
b. End of fixed-term appointments - Employees
appointed for a fixed term (e.g. one quarter, one
year, or until a specific date) are terminated on the
last day of the appointment unless they are given a
new appointment or are transferred. Unless other-

wise authorized by the department head, any vaca
tion accumulation should be taken before the
designated terminating date. The department
should notify the employee to confirm the termi
nation in advance of the designated date. A termi
nation notice is required. See Paragraph 4.
(Emphasis in the original.)
The grievant, too, refers to the Guide Memo and claims
that Paragraph d (1) of Section 2 has been violated by
the University. It reads:
(1) Before a decision is made to terminate for
unsatisfactory performance, a regular staff em
ployee should be informed of specific deficiencies
and given an opportunity to improve.
Mr. Jones concedes that the appointment letter stated
a 10-month appointment, but that the surrounding cir
cumstances meant two years and that the appointment,
for the continuity which the Dean's office had con
sidered so valuable, was to be two years if he and the
Policy Board mutally agreed that it would be desirable.
He contends that he and the Policy Board have so
indicated, but that the Office of the Dean of Undergrad
uate Studies has, in effect, overruled the Policy Board of
SCIRE in "terminating" his employment as Director.
Further, Mr. Jones claims that the conditions of Guide
Memo 22.8, Section 2 d (1) have been violated by the
University in that he has not been informed of specific
deficiencies and given an opportunity to improve.
The method of Director appointments, as testified to
by Dean Gibbs, is that the SCIRE Policy Board submits
a list of 3 candidates, and that the Director selects the
candidate he considers best for the position. In June,
1972, before Mr. Jones' appointment. Dean Gibbs
talked with him after checking his application data.
Because this was the 3rd Director of SCIRE, the first
and second having left at the end of their first year, and
because the Dean considered continuity to be important,
he had indicated that no one should be considered for
the position unless he or she was available for more than
one year. Further, since Mr. Jones' record of previous
employment seemed to indicate that he had had 3 differ
ent jobs from 1969 to 1972, the Dean wanted to be sure
he would stick with the SCIRE job for the full academic
year and would be available for more than one year. On
the basis of Dean Gibbs' letter of appointment, the
office prepared the formal appointment notice, showing
a starting date of September 1, 1972, and a "stop date"
of June 30, 1973. The "yes-no" boxes next to the
question "Is employment expected to continue beyond
stop date shown above?" were not checked.
Thus, it is the University's position that while availa
bility for 2 years was a condition it considered impor
tant, in that any individual who was not available and
willing to serve for two years would not have been
appointed, the appointment was made on a one-year
basis. The Dean considered that Mr. Jones would need
strong back-up in administrative judgment and ability
and wanted to make that clear to the Policy Board. The
letter to the Board (Grievant's Ex. 2) attempted to have
the Board exercise leadership in working with Mr. Jones
and assume leadership in developing the work of SCIRE.
The Dean also points out that at that time the program
was budgeted by the Provost's office for one year only.
Discussion and Findings
The accreditation of courses is delegated to the facul
ty. according to the Provost of the University. The
faculty's instrument for this responsibility is the Senate
of the Academic Council, and its various committees.
The Senate takes final action on accreditation, but the
Committee of the Senate makes initial determinations.
When SCIRK was changed (University Ex. 3, as adopted

by the Senate of the Academic Council on 1 /11*/73),
Provost Miller's testimony is that the Dean of Under
graduate Studies became totally responsible for SCIRE,
and both the Director of SCIRE and the Policy Board of
SCIRE had responsibilities to the Dean of Undergrad
uate Studies. It is the Provost's testimony that the
SCIRE program was unique in that it furnished oppor
tunity for interdepartmental programs and for experi
mentation with programs which might later become part
of a regular curriculum. It was also structurally unique,
in that it reported to the Dean in a different way than
other school programs.
It is apparent that differences had developed within
the SCIRE program before Mr. Jones was hired, and that
those differences related to the lines of authority and
responsibility, and to the question of who would have
leadership. When Mr. Jones was hired, Dean Gibbs made
an effort, in his letter to the SCIRE Policy Board, to
have that Board fill the gap by furnishing leadership to
the Director. But it does not seem to me that Dean
Gibbs gave to the Policy Board and to the Director the
decision-making power to jointly agree on the Director's
reappointment for a second year. Clearly, the Dean did
state in his letter that he noted Mr. Jones' willingness to
serve for two years if at the end of the first year Mr.
Jones and the Policy Board mutually agree that this
would be desirable. But considering the structure of the
authority and responsibility—both before and after Janu
ary-1 cannot find that this meant that the Dean was
turning over to the Policy Board the authority for the
appointment of Mr. Jones for a second year. Indeed, this
delegation of power very probably is beyond the power
and authority of the Dean. It is apparent that the lan
guage meant that Mr. Jones was willing to serve another
year if both he and the Policy Board, at the end of the
first year, thought it would be desirable. It did not
mean, in my judgment, that this would be any more
than a recommendation of the Policy Board, which the
Dean had the final authority to accept or reject. The
language upon which Mr. Jones relies really does no
more than state the conditions under which lie was
willing to serve for two years.
Thus it appears to me to be clear that, considering all
of the surrounding circumstances, the appointment of
W. Ron Jones was for one year. There is no evidence
that he was dismissed. The University did not reappoint
him for a second year, and that was within the Univer
sity's right.
Although it is not required that I make a decision on
Issue No. 2, having found that under Issue No. 1 Mr.
Jones' claim is not supportable, it does seem to me that
some comments, as dicta, might be indicated. There
appear to have been a variety of concerns- as to the
academic value of the proposals, the accreditation prob
lems, the deadlines, the sponsor support, and the general
administration of the programs. Some were not ade
quately handled by Mr. Jones. It does not seem to me,
having analysed very carefully the documents offered as
exhibits by the parties, and the testimony of the wit
nesses, that there was here an unreasonable or dis
criminatory application of policy. It is my opinion that,
although Mr. Jones obviously had the ability to work
well with the students and the capacity for handling well
a part of the position of Director, his administrative
skills and his ability to meet the legitimate needs of the
University were not sufficient. Witness after witness,
called by him as well as those called by the University,
point this up in their testimony. Under such circum
stances, it could not in any case be considered un
reasonable or discriminatory to deny him reappointment
for a second year.
