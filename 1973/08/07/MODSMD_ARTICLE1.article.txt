# Skylab Astronauts Walk Outside Craft
## 
### MEADE MURPHY 
Skylab astronauts Jack R. Lousma
and Stanford Engineering Prof. Owen
K. Garriott floated out into space
yesterday on the first of three
spacewalks. Together they unrolled
the new sunshade over the lab and
inspected trouble spots on the
surface of the 118-foot spacecraft.
The airlock opened at 10:35 PDT
to start the planned 3Vi hour trek.
Bundled in heavy white spacesuits, the
astronauts maneuvered easily about
the 100-ton craft on their 60 lifelines.
Garriott was the first to emerge.
Upon seeing the panaorama before
him, he commented, "What a view!"
Delay in checking out equipment
caused the astronauts to leave over an
hour late. Hangups also occurred in
the airlock depressurizing system.
However, Mission Control at Johnson
Space Center in Houston fixed most of
the problems.
Sunshade Installed
The astronauts first installed the
22-by-24 foot sunshade over the
spacelab using a series of rods
combined into two 55-foot poles. The
sail-like shade was then bolted to the
roof of the space lab.
The new awning, made out of a
special aluminized nylon, will cover
the parasol installed on the Skylab I
mission. The need for the two
canopies stems from the loss of the
lab's metal sunshade during launch
May 14.
Skylab ll's commander, Alan L.
Bean, monitored the walk from the
inside of the station, relaying
information to Mission Control. He
too donned a spacesuit in case any
trouble arose.
Film Packs
The astronauts next installed film
packs into the solar telescope cameras.
These will be trained on the sun for
long periods of time. They will provide
information aiding the study of solar
physics.
A week ago, there was fear that the
crew would have to end experiments
and return home by this Friday due to
the loss of two command module
thruster rockets.
Astronauts first realized the failure
when a master alarm buzzer went off
last Thursday morning.
Apparently a leak sprang from a
propellant valve on one of the four
thrusters. Similar trouble had occurred
to another thruster during docking
maneuvers.
Rescue Preparations
Mission Control officials gave the
go-ahead for an accelerated
preparation of the Skylab 111 rocket,
which still may be needed to fly a
three-day rescue mission in early
September.
If needed, the rescue vehicle will be
equipped with five couches and will be
flown by the Skylab backup
astronauts Vance D. Brand and Donald
L. Lind. The Skylab has a second
docking facility that could be used.
If the Skylab 111 rescue mission flies
it would cost taxpayers $100 million.
However, the command module still
has maneuvering ability, so there is a
possibility that the rescue craft will
not be necessary.

In that case it would be returned to
storage until Skylab Ill's scheduled
flight Nov. 9. It is very likely Garriott
can fix the problem himself on his
next space walk. Mission Control is
now drawing up plans for this repair.
Experiments Continue
If the rescue mission is needed, it
will not shorten the experiment
procedure considerably because the
launch date would not be until
September.
Last weekend the astronauts and
ground control were able to clear up a
series of electrical problems occurring
in the voltage regulator system.
Minutes later Mission Control
corrected the malfunction by radio
signal. Several shorts in the Solar
Telescope system were corrected by
Garriott.
