# Men Portrayed Attractively
## TV Ads Stereotype Women 
### 
Margie Shuer

Last Monday I read Virginia
Woolf's A Room of One's Own. I
also watched the 9:00 Movie
which was accompanied by a host
of repulsive commercials. Virginia
Woolf must have had an effect on
me, because I started really
noticing all the sexual
stereotyping and injustices of the
commercials and I gradually
became infuriated. It was almost
as if Ms. Greer and Ms. Woolf
were standing over my shoulder
making sure I noticed every
possible nuance.
Commercials take amazing
liberties. Not only did I have to
watch women being made fools of
in "comic housewife type" scenes,
but in the course of the two-hour
movie there were at least five
beauty commercials.
These "do as I do and you too
can be a striking beauty"
commercials present the audience
with the stereotype of the perfect
American woman. Sandwiched
between these two types of
commercials were those using men
to sell produts.
The men were presented in two
flattering lights. They were either
the rough-tough he-man or the
authoritative businessman who
really knows his stuff. Men were
never presented in a
condescending way.
I felt this was not right. Why
should women be presented as
comic figures or ethereal beauties
while the men appear closer to
reasonable human form?
Tuna Ad's Bias
The first commercial to
infuriate me was one concerning
Chunky Tuna. The commercial
began with the son challenging his
father to race to the houseboat.
They swim towards their
destination in what could be
termed a very poor crawl.
The camera then cuts from the
swimmers to the delicious chunky
tuna prepared by the mother. The
'men' get on deck and the mother
who looks as though she has spent
the entire morning in a beauty
salon brings in the lunch.
The male-narrated commercial
implies many things .. . Boys do
competitive things like swimming
and racing while mothers stay on

houseboats, cook and look
beautiful.
Beer And Bear
The next commercial
advertised beer. It began with a
rough tough he-man in the
wilderness getting into a canoe
and paddling across the river. For
some reason he was accompanied
by a bear who swam with the
canoe.
I couldn't quite figure out the
bear's purpose, unless it was to
show that the man was even
tougher than he at first seemed.
The scene changed to the man
drinking beer with his friends.
Why are women never shown
drinking beer? The companies
must think that beer is still a
'man's' drink and that is the way
it should be advertised. This
commercial implies that only men
are tough enough to handle the
American wilderness armed with a
bottle of beer in one hand and a
bear on the other.
Beauty Commercials
I found it hard to believe the
large number of beauty
commercials programmed for a
Monday evening. During the
afternoon soap opera marathon
one expects this because the
audience is chiefly made up of
women. But to show these beauty
extravaganzas during the evening
must have some other purpose.
The commercials could succeed
in selling more products to those
women who work during the day,
but they also restate the artificial
stereotypes of the American male
and female population.
They perpetuate these
completely false and generally

unattainable images of the tough
he-man and fragile delicate thing.
The frustrated American people
all want to be these godlike
extremes.
Images Become Truth
What right have the media to
continually bombard us with
these splendiferous images until
we are brainwashed into believing
that they are truth?
Something has to be done
about the media. Isn't it time we
saw a little girl playing with a
train set or a boy doing something
that isn't strictly "masculine"?
Why is it that men always
advertise and sell the important
objects? One explanation is that
when men do the selling more
items are bought. If this is true it
seems we as a society have been
taught to listen and respect men
and not women.
Men Run Industry
Who runs the industry? Who
do you see most often in the
important roles on the TV? Look
at the friendly newsman every
night who jokes around and now
brings you the 'informal' news.
How many times do you see a
woman?
With TV continuously feeding
out these horrendous stereotypes
any rap sessions or
consciousness-raising groups will
be completely undermined. The
people of America can be reached
through mass media and it is the
media that needs to be changed,
through legislation or infiltration.

Why is it that men always
advertise and sell the important
objects? One explanation is that
when men do the selling more
items are bought. If this is true it
seems we as a society have been
taught to listen and respect men
and not women.
Men Run Industry
Who runs the industry? Who
do you see most often in the
important roles on the TV? Look
at the friendly newsman every
night who jokes around and now
brings you the 'informal' news.
How many times do you see a
woman?
With TV continuously feeding
out these horrendous stereotypes
any rap sessions or
consciousness-raising groups will
be completely undermined. The
people of America can be reached
through mass media and it is the
media that needs to be changed,
through legislation or infiltration.

Last Monday I read Virginia
Woolf's A Room of One's Own. I
also watched the 9:00 Movie
which was accompanied by a host
of repulsive commercials. Virginia
Woolf must have had an effect on
me, because I started really
noticing all the sexual
stereotyping and injustices of the
commercials and I gradually
became infuriated. It was almost
as if Ms. Greer and Ms. Woolf
were standing over my shoulder
making sure I noticed every
possible nuance.
Commercials take amazing
liberties. Not only did I have to
watch women being made fools of
in "comic housewife type" scenes,
but in the course of the two-hour
movie there were at least five
beauty commercials.
These "do as I do and you too
can be a striking beauty"
commercials present the audience
with the stereotype of the perfect
American woman. Sandwiched
between these two types of
commercials were those using men
to sell produts.
The men were presented in two
flattering lights. They were either
the rough-tough he-man or the
authoritative businessman who
really knows his stuff. Men were
never presented in a
condescending way.
I felt this was not right. Why
should women be presented as
comic figures or ethereal beauties
while the men appear closer to
reasonable human form?
Tuna Ad's Bias
The first commercial to
infuriate me was one concerning
Chunky Tuna. The commercial
began with the son challenging his
father to race to the houseboat.
They swim towards their
destination in what could be
termed a very poor crawl.
The camera then cuts from the
swimmers to the delicious chunky
tuna prepared by the mother. The
'men' get on deck and the mother
who looks as though she has spent
the entire morning in a beauty
salon brings in the lunch.
The male-narrated commercial
implies many things .. . Boys do
competitive things like swimming
and racing while mothers stay on

houseboats, cook and look
beautiful.
Beer And Bear
The next commercial
advertised beer. It began with a
rough tough he-man in the
wilderness getting into a canoe
and paddling across the river. For
some reason he was accompanied
by a bear who swam with the
canoe.
I couldn't quite figure out the
bear's purpose, unless it was to
show that the man was even
tougher than he at first seemed.
The scene changed to the man
drinking beer with his friends.
Why are women never shown
drinking beer? The companies
must think that beer is still a
'man's' drink and that is the way
it should be advertised. This
commercial implies that only men
are tough enough to handle the
American wilderness armed with a
bottle of beer in one hand and a
bear on the other.
Beauty Commercials
I found it hard to believe the
large number of beauty
commercials programmed for a
Monday evening. During the
afternoon soap opera marathon
one expects this because the
audience is chiefly made up of
women. But to show these beauty
extravaganzas during the evening
must have some other purpose.
The commercials could succeed
in selling more products to those
women who work during the day,
but they also restate the artificial
stereotypes of the American male
and female population.
They perpetuate these
completely false and generally

unattainable images of the tough
he-man and fragile delicate thing.
The frustrated American people
all want to be these godlike
extremes.
Images Become Truth
What right have the media to
continually bombard us with
these splendiferous images until
we are brainwashed into believing
that they are truth?
Something has to be done
about the media. Isn't it time we
saw a little girl playing with a
train set or a boy doing something
that isn't strictly "masculine"?
Why is it that men always
advertise and sell the important
objects? One explanation is that

afternoon soap opera marathon
one expects this because the
audience is chiefly made up of
women. But to show these beauty
extravaganzas during the evening
must have some other purpose.
The commercials could succeed
in selling more products to those
women who work during the day,
but they also restate the artificial
stereotypes of the American male
and female population.
They perpetuate these
completely false and generally

unattainable images of the tough
he-man and fragile delicate thing.
The frustrated American people
all want to be these godlike
extremes.
Images Become Truth
What right have the media to
continually bombard us with
these splendiferous images until
we are brainwashed into believing
that they are truth?
Something has to be done
about the media. Isn't it time we
saw a little girl playing with a
train set or a boy doing something
that isn't strictly "masculine"?
Why is it that men always
advertise and sell the important
objects? One explanation is that
when men do the selling more
items are bought. If this is true it
seems we as a society have been
taught to listen and respect men
and not women.
Men Run Industry
Who runs the industry? Who
do you see most often in the
important roles on the TV? Look
at the friendly newsman every
night who jokes around and now
brings you the 'informal' news.
How many times do you see a
woman?
With TV continuously feeding
out these horrendous stereotypes
any rap sessions or
consciousness-raising groups will
be completely undermined. The
people of America can be reached
through mass media and it is the
media that needs to be changed,
through legislation or infiltration.
