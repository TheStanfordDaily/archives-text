# Concord Festival Showcases Fine Jazz Musicians
## 
### DAN FORTE First of Two Parts 
CONCORD—The first weekend of
the Concord Summer Festival
(July 27-29) had something for
every musical taste. The three
well-rounded evening shows
featured some fine jazz musicians.
Festivities opened on Friday,
June 27, at 8 p.m. at the grassy
Concord Boulevard Park. Bassist
Milt Hinton and his Jazz Masters
opened the show. The group
includes some of the greats of
early Swing; Budd Johnson on
sax, Roy Eldridge on trumpet,
Claude Hopkins on piano, Bennie

Morton on trombone, and Jo
Jones on drums.
The average age of the band
members is 64, but they played as
hot and as sharp as ever—whether
playing together or spotlighting a
single musician.
Standout Selections
Two standouts were Eldridge's
blues vocal about his girlfriend
"Wineola," and Jones' extended
solo on Duke Ellington's
"Caravan." Although Jones is
noted for being a fine rhythm
drummer (from the original Count
Basie Band), this solo was as
well-structured and flawless as any

by the more flamboyant
super-drummers of jazz.
The trio of England's pianist
George Shearing appeared next
with what was possibly the best
set of the weekend. Shearing's
music was just right; not too old.
not too new. Shearing's solos
complemented Concord's
outdoor-under-the-stars setting
perfectly.
The crowd came to its feet at
the end of Shearing's final
selection, Carole King's "You've
Got A Friend," so he sat back
down and played a few more
choruses, with the audience

clapping along as Shearing had
instructed.
Disappointing New Style
Friday night ended with a
disappointing set by Quincy Jones
and his 24-member Big Band.
Jones no longer delivers the jazz
he may have played at one time
(with Lionel Hampton, Dizzy
Gillespie, and others).
Jones spent at least 15 minutes
explaining to the audience how
people don't understand what he's
into. But he could have made it
short, sweet, and honest by
simply saying, "Hi, I'd like to
introduce my 24-piece soul
band."
It was a shame to see such
talented artists as Harry "Sweets"
Edison (trumpeter from the
original Basie band), Cat
Anderson (Duke Ellington's
trumpeter, famous for his
incredible high notes), and
vocalist Blinky Williams (who sang
"T'ain't Nobody's Business" in
iMdy Sings the Blues) doing
muddy versions of songs like
"What's Going On?" and "Ain't
No Sunshine."
Saturday Concert
Saturday night got off to an
outstanding start with the great
drummer Louie Bellson and his
Super Stars.
Bellson saved his long solo for
last, dedicating it to "Mrs.
Bellson, who's in the audience
tonight." (He's married to Pearl
Bailey.)
Next, Ella Fitzgerald joined the
group, with Tommy Flanagan on

piano, and drummer Freddy Waits
replacing Bellson.
Fitzgerald is literally a singer's
singer, the best in jazz today, and
surely ranks with Billie Holiday as
one of the top vocalists in the
history of jazz.
Crowd-Pleasing Vocals
She had missed the Concord
Festival two years in a row. And
this time, the weekend's biggest
crowd was waiting for her •
Fitzgerald easily won the
crowd over by singing more than a
dozen songs, including "I Gotta
Be Me," "Sweet Georgia Brown,"
"Taking A Chance On Love,"
Cole Porter's "Miss Otis Regrets,"
"Love You Madly," "Some O'
These Days," and Billie Holiday's
"Good Morning Heartache."
Fitzgerald is famous for her
scat-singing, and showcased this
style on "Ray's Idea," written by
bassist Brown. Her phrasing on
this number sounded just like that
of a good trumpet player. The
crowd loved it.
Supersax On Sunday
Sunday night's show began
with an interesting new group,
Supersax. The group operates on
the premise that the improvised
alto sax solos of the late Charlie
Parker are not just great solo
breaks, but worthy compositions
on their own.
The group's co-founders, Med
Flory (alto) and Buddy Clark
(bass), have transcribed many of
Parker's recorded solos and set
them to harmony. And that's
what Supersax plays; Charlie
Parker and nothing else.
The group, which includes five

saxes, piano, bass, drums, and a
fine trumpet (Jay Diversa), played
a great set of bebop including
"Scrapple From The Apple,"
"Lady Be Good," "Salt Peanuts,"
"Just Friends," and "Koko,"
among other Parker standards.
Their lastest album, "Supersax
Plays Bird," is great musical
tribute, executed in fine style.
Two Great Guitarists
The great guitar duo of Herb
Ellis and Joe Pass followed,
backed by Jake Hanna on drums
and Ray Brown on bass.
Pass and Ellis opened with
Coleman Hawkins' "Stuffy" and
proceeded to delight and amaze
the audience with beautiful, close
interplay.
Each guitarist soloed, with the
other leaving the stage, on one
number apiece, and for these
numbers both Pass and Ellis chose
soft mellow selections.
Talented And Tasteful
Together they played Charlie
Christian's "Seven Come Eleven,"
"Georgia," and Duke Ellington's
classic "In A Mellotone." They
closed with a beautiful rendition
of "I'm Confessin' " with Ellis
handling the melody line, and
returned for an encore with
'Perdido," another Ellington
tune.
Ellis and Pass are without a
doubt two of the most respected,
most talented, and most tasteful
jazz guitarists around. Their first
LP together, "Jazz/Concord," has
just been released as the premiere
recording for the Concord Jazz
label. It includes the same
personnel as was used Sunday

night.
Oscar Peterson, surely the most
taltented jazz pianist alive,
brought Concord's first weekend
to a close.
Peterson was backed by Pass
on guitar and Niels Pederson,
from Copenhagen, on bass.
Pederson turned out to be one of
the big surprises of the festival;
not only because Ray Brown
wasn't sitting in, but because
Pederson produced some
fantastic, unique bass work.
As for Peterson, he was as great
as could be expected, if not
greater. He plays jazz like a
concert pianist—flawless, with
impeccable taste and class.
Peterson's trio got the most
enthusiastic ovation of the
weekend after their final number,
"On The Trail." During their
uptempo encore Peterson played a
long stretch alone, including a few
fine boogie-woogie choruses.
The Concord Summer Festival
is by far the best organized, most
enjoyable festival this reviewer has
ever attended. The Concord
Boulevard Park is the place to be
for jazz fans and music lovers.
The Concord Jazz Festival
offered a second weekend of
concerts featuring big-name jazz
musicians August 3-5. A review of
these performances will appear in
h\iday's Daily.
