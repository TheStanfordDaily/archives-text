# 'The Servant Of Two Masters'
## Comedy Needs Refinement 
### GEORGE POWELL 
The Servant of Two Masters,
an eighteenth-century farce by
Carlo Goldoni, is currently being
presented at the Nitery by the
drama department's comedy
workshop. The play depends
heavily on pace and timing which
just wasn't there last Thursday,
the opening night.
Almost all other necessary
elements were present, though,
and a near-capacity audience was
clearly appreciative of the actors'
efforts to bring the comedia

dell'arte characters to life.
But aside from Douglas
Broyles, who played Florindo
Aretusi, no one principal was able
to evoke a constant response from
the audience.
A brief explanation of the plot
here would be as silly as the plot
itself. Let it suffice to say that the
action revolves around a case of
mistaken identity, artfully foolish
servants, unrequited love, and a
pontificating professor.
Daniel Moran, as Truffaldino,
played the actual servant of two

masters, and his part was probably
the most demanding mentally and
physically. While continually
exuding an air of romantic
cunning, he was thrashed, fell fiat
on his back, and jumped into a
tank.
His actions became more
intelligible after he stopped
running through his lines at
breakneck speed.
The other traditional
com media dell'arte characters
included Pantalone (Wlliam
Moreing), Dr. Lombardi (Peter
Davis), and Brighella (Michael
Hill).
Although these characters are
supposed to add comic thrust to
the play, only Truffaldino
injected enough zaniness into his
role. Dr. Lombtrdi had some
outrageous English/Latin puns,
but his effort could have been
improved by further tune-up.
Because of early deficiencies,
The Servant of Two Masters
started two touchdowns behind
and had to play catch-up the rest
of the way. Further refinement
would overcome this deficit to the
increased enjoyment of everyone
who pays the $1 admission.
This play is the comedy
workshop's final production ofthe
summer. An additional play will
be offered by an independent
group of Stanford and
ex-Stanford thespians. Jean-Paul
Sartre's No Exit will be presented
Aug. 9-11 in the Branner Dining
Hall.

Two Masters."
The Servant of Two Masters,
an eighteenth-century farce by
Carlo Goldoni, is currently being
presented at the Nitery by the
drama department's comedy
workshop. The play depends
heavily on pace and timing which
just wasn't there last Thursday,
the opening night.
Almost all other necessary
elements were present, though,
and a near-capacity audience was
clearly appreciative of the actors'
efforts to bring the comedia

dell'arte characters to life.
But aside from Douglas
Broyles, who played Florindo
Aretusi, no one principal was able
to evoke a constant response from
the audience.
A brief explanation of the plot
here would be as silly as the plot
itself. Let it suffice to say that the
action revolves around a case of
mistaken identity, artfully foolish
servants, unrequited love, and a
pontificating professor.
Daniel Moran, as Truffaldino,
played the actual servant of two

masters, and his part was probably
the most demanding mentally and
physically. While continually
exuding an air of romantic
cunning, he was thrashed, fell fiat
on his back, and jumped into a
tank.
His actions became more
intelligible after he stopped
running through his lines at
breakneck speed.
The other traditional
com media dell'arte characters
included Pantalone (Wlliam
Moreing), Dr. Lombardi (Peter
Davis), and Brighella (Michael
Hill).
Although these characters are
supposed to add comic thrust to
the play, only Truffaldino
injected enough zaniness into his
role. Dr. Lombtrdi had some
outrageous English/Latin puns,
but his effort could have been
improved by further tune-up.
Because of early deficiencies,
The Servant of Two Masters
started two touchdowns behind
and had to play catch-up the rest
of the way. Further refinement
would overcome this deficit to the
increased enjoyment of everyone
who pays the $1 admission.
This play is the comedy
workshop's final production ofthe
summer. An additional play will
be offered by an independent
group of Stanford and
ex-Stanford thespians. Jean-Paul
Sartre's No Exit will be presented
Aug. 9-11 in the Branner Dining
Hall.
