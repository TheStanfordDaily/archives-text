Cambodian Bombing Kills 100
PHNOM PENH—What military sources have
described as the worst accidental bombing strike in
the history of the war in Indochina left more than
100 civilians dead and about 600 others wounded in
a government-held Cambodian town yesterday.
The pre-dawn bomb shower caught most of the
town's residents in bed. In Washington, Pentagon
spokesman Jerry Freidheim explained, "The initial
indications are that part of the bomb load of one
B-52 fell short of the intended target." The
Pentagon has not yet released official casualty
figures.
New York Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman
and four air force officers have asked the Supreme
Court to reinstate a New York* District Court order
banning the bombing.
South Vietnam Fighting Continues
SAIGON—The worst fighting since the peace treaty
was signed last January continues in South Vietnam.
The Saigon command estimated that 70 South
Vietnamese and Viet Cong soldiers died in 24 hours
of sharp clashes. Nine civilians died and 20 were
wounded.
Saigon reported 113 Communist truce violations
in the 24-hour period ending at noon yesterday.
Judge Affirms Beef Ceiling
SAN FRANCISCO—A federal judge yesterday
denied a motion for a preliminary injunction against
price ceilings imposed on beef by the Cost of Living
Council.
A suit by the Pacific Coast Meat Jobbers
Association contended that the council had violated
congressional edicts by not holding hearings before
imposing price ceilings on beef only. The petition
also stated that ceiling regulations should not cause
hardships, gross inequalities, or serious market
disruptions.
And across the nation the pressure of the beef
ceiling is keeping some packing plants closed and
causing dwindling market beef supplies.

Consumers across the country are hoarding
supplies as prices on chickens and eggs have risen
more than one-third since the end of the freeze.
Meanwhile, one steak restaurant is offering a
"Nixon Special"—a bowl of soup and a grilled
cheese sandwich.
Nixon Home Expenses Disclosed
WASHINGTON—The General Services
Administration, the Defense Department, and the
Secret Service, acting on presidential orders,
yesterday released the amounts each has spent for
security improvements on the President's California
and Florida properties.
The disclosure was an attempt to justify spending
nearly 10 million tax dollars for improvements that
increased the value of the President's property.
According to the figures, the armed forces spent
nearly $6 million, primarily for communications, at
San Clemente and Key Biscayne, but hopes to
recover $40,000 in re-usable equipment.
BART Trains Resume Service
OAKLAND—Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) trains
returned to the tracks yesterday for the first time in
five weeks.
A four-week strike by 1200 workers halted the
system until the two striking unions and BART's
board of directors last Tuesday approved a contract
boosting wages and fringe benefits 43 percent over
three years.
The walkout forced about 35,000 commuters to
turn to buses and cars during morning rush hours.
But patronage yesterday morning was 16 percent
lower than the pre-strike daily average.
The Westinghouse Electric Company announced
yesterday it would begin testing this week on BART
trains for the San Francisco and Dalv Citv routes.
Five Oklahoma Convicts Escaped
McALISTER, Okla.—Officials at Oklahoma State
Prison yesterday confirmed that at least five
convicts escaped during an eight-day riot at the
facility that lasted from July 27 to August 5

Four persons were killed in the disturbance
which caused $20 million in damages.
Gov. David Hall is described as especially alarmed
about the escape of Rex Brinlee, who was serving a
life sentence for a 1971 bomb murder of a school
teacher.
Mullin's Mental State Diagnosed
SANTA CRUZ—Stanford Asst. Psychiatry Prof.
Donald Lunde testified yesterday that Herbert
Mullin, accused of killing ten persons, was a
paranoid schizophrenic.
Lunde told the court that Mullin's mind was
"like a switchboard gone beserk" that had "some
strange connections." But he acknowledged that
other psychiatrists might interpret Mullin's mental
state differently.
Mullin's defense contends that he was insane
when he committed the 13 killings to which he has
confessed.
Banks Boost Prime Lending Rate
SAN FRANCISCO—Major California Banks
yesterday followed the rising trend in interest rates
by boosting the prime interest rate from eight and
three-fourths to nine percent.
The prime rate is the interest rate charged to
banks' most creditworthy corporate borrowers.
Bank of America and Wells Fargo were among those
banks that began yesterday morning with the new
rate.
Meanwhile, the dollar is making a comeback on
the European money markets. It climbed yesterday
to a three-week high against the German mark.
British dealers attribute the sudden show of
strength to the prime lending rate hikes.
Fair, Mild Weather Continues
The San Francisco Bay Area Weather forecast calls
for fair weather today and tomorrow with low
clouds near the coast extending inland night and
morning. Predicted temperatures for today and
tomorrow will range from highs in the 70s inland
and 60s near the coast to nighttime lows in the 50s.

Secret Service, acting on presidential orders,
yesterday released the amounts each has spent for
security improvements on the President's California
and Florida properties.
The disclosure was an attempt to justify spending
nearly 10 million tax dollars for improvements that
increased the value of the President's property.
According to the figures, the armed forces spent
nearly $6 million, primarily for communications, at
San Clemente and Key Biscayne, but hopes to
recover $40,000 in re-usable equipment.
BART Trains Resume Service
OAKLAND—Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) trains
returned to the tracks yesterday for the first time in
five weeks.
A four-week strike by 1200 workers halted the
system until the two striking unions and BART's
board of directors last Tuesday approved a contract
boosting wages and fringe benefits 43 percent over
three years.
The walkout forced about 35,000 commuters to
turn to buses and cars during morning rush hours.
But patronage yesterday morning was 16 percent
lower than the pre-strike daily average.
The Westinghouse Electric Company announced
yesterday it would begin testing this week on BART
trains for the San Francisco and Dalv Citv routes.
Five Oklahoma Convicts Escaped
McALISTER, Okla.—Officials at Oklahoma State
Prison yesterday confirmed that at least five
convicts escaped during an eight-day riot at the
facility that lasted from July 27 to August 5

Four persons were killed in the disturbance
which caused $20 million in damages.
Gov. David Hall is described as especially alarmed
about the escape of Rex Brinlee, who was serving a
life sentence for a 1971 bomb murder of a school
teacher.
Mullin's Mental State Diagnosed
SANTA CRUZ—Stanford Asst. Psychiatry Prof.
Donald Lunde testified yesterday that Herbert
Mullin, accused of killing ten persons, was a
paranoid schizophrenic.
Lunde told the court that Mullin's mind was
"like a switchboard gone beserk" that had "some
strange connections." But he acknowledged that
other psychiatrists might interpret Mullin's mental
state differently.
Mullin's defense contends that he was insane
when he committed the 13 killings to which he has
confessed.
Banks Boost Prime Lending Rate
SAN FRANCISCO—Major California Banks
yesterday followed the rising trend in interest rates
by boosting the prime interest rate from eight and
three-fourths to nine percent.
The prime rate is the interest rate charged to
banks' most creditworthy corporate borrowers.
Bank of America and Wells Fargo were among those
banks that began yesterday morning with the new
rate.
Meanwhile, the dollar is making a comeback on
the European money markets. It climbed yesterday
to a three-week high against the German mark.
British dealers attribute the sudden show of
strength to the prime lending rate hikes.
Fair, Mild Weather Continues
The San Francisco Bay Area Weather forecast calls
for fair weather today and tomorrow with low
clouds near the coast extending inland night and
morning. Predicted temperatures for today and
tomorrow will range from highs in the 70s inland
and 60s near the coast to nighttime lows in the 50s.
Cambodian Bombing Kills 100
PHNOM PENH—What military sources have
described as the worst accidental bombing strike in
the history of the war in Indochina left more than
100 civilians dead and about 600 others wounded in
a government-held Cambodian town yesterday.
The pre-dawn bomb shower caught most of the
town's residents in bed. In Washington, Pentagon
spokesman Jerry Freidheim explained, "The initial
indications are that part of the bomb load of one
B-52 fell short of the intended target." The
Pentagon has not yet released official casualty
figures.
New York Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman
and four air force officers have asked the Supreme
Court to reinstate a New York* District Court order
banning the bombing.
South Vietnam Fighting Continues
SAIGON—The worst fighting since the peace treaty
was signed last January continues in South Vietnam.
The Saigon command estimated that 70 South
Vietnamese and Viet Cong soldiers died in 24 hours
of sharp clashes. Nine civilians died and 20 were
wounded.
Saigon reported 113 Communist truce violations
in the 24-hour period ending at noon yesterday.
Judge Affirms Beef Ceiling
SAN FRANCISCO—A federal judge yesterday
denied a motion for a preliminary injunction against
price ceilings imposed on beef by the Cost of Living
Council.
A suit by the Pacific Coast Meat Jobbers
Association contended that the council had violated
congressional edicts by not holding hearings before
imposing price ceilings on beef only. The petition
also stated that ceiling regulations should not cause
hardships, gross inequalities, or serious market
disruptions.
And across the nation the pressure of the beef
ceiling is keeping some packing plants closed and
causing dwindling market beef supplies.

Consumers across the country are hoarding
supplies as prices on chickens and eggs have risen
more than one-third since the end of the freeze.
Meanwhile, one steak restaurant is offering a
"Nixon Special"—a bowl of soup and a grilled
cheese sandwich.

other psychiatrists might interpret Mullin's mental
state differently.
Mullin's defense contends that he was insane
when he committed the 13 killings to which he has
confessed.
Banks Boost Prime Lending Rate
SAN FRANCISCO—Major California Banks
yesterday followed the rising trend in interest rates
by boosting the prime interest rate from eight and
three-fourths to nine percent.
The prime rate is the interest rate charged to
banks' most creditworthy corporate borrowers.
Bank of America and Wells Fargo were among those
banks that began yesterday morning with the new
rate.
Meanwhile, the dollar is making a comeback on
the European money markets. It climbed yesterday
to a three-week high against the German mark.
British dealers attribute the sudden show of
strength to the prime lending rate hikes.
Fair, Mild Weather Continues
The San Francisco Bay Area Weather forecast calls
for fair weather today and tomorrow with low
clouds near the coast extending inland night and
morning. Predicted temperatures for today and
tomorrow will range from highs in the 70s inland
and 60s near the coast to nighttime lows in the 50s.
Cambodian Bombing Kills 100
PHNOM PENH—What military sources have
described as the worst accidental bombing strike in
the history of the war in Indochina left more than
100 civilians dead and about 600 others wounded in
a government-held Cambodian town yesterday.
The pre-dawn bomb shower caught most of the
town's residents in bed. In Washington, Pentagon
spokesman Jerry Freidheim explained, "The initial
indications are that part of the bomb load of one
B-52 fell short of the intended target." The
Pentagon has not yet released official casualty
figures.
New York Congresswoman Elizabeth Holtzman
and four air force officers have asked the Supreme
Court to reinstate a New York* District Court order
banning the bombing.
South Vietnam Fighting Continues
SAIGON—The worst fighting since the peace treaty
was signed last January continues in South Vietnam.
The Saigon command estimated that 70 South
Vietnamese and Viet Cong soldiers died in 24 hours
of sharp clashes. Nine civilians died and 20 were
wounded.
Saigon reported 113 Communist truce violations
in the 24-hour period ending at noon yesterday.
Judge Affirms Beef Ceiling
SAN FRANCISCO—A federal judge yesterday
denied a motion for a preliminary injunction against
price ceilings imposed on beef by the Cost of Living
Council.
A suit by the Pacific Coast Meat Jobbers
Association contended that the council had violated
congressional edicts by not holding hearings before
imposing price ceilings on beef only. The petition
also stated that ceiling regulations should not cause
hardships, gross inequalities, or serious market
disruptions.
And across the nation the pressure of the beef
ceiling is keeping some packing plants closed and
causing dwindling market beef supplies.

Consumers across the country are hoarding
supplies as prices on chickens and eggs have risen
more than one-third since the end of the freeze.
Meanwhile, one steak restaurant is offering a
"Nixon Special"—a bowl of soup and a grilled
cheese sandwich.
Nixon Home Expenses Disclosed
WASHINGTON—The General Services
Administration, the Defense Department, and the
Secret Service, acting on presidential orders,
yesterday released the amounts each has spent for
security improvements on the President's California
and Florida properties.
The disclosure was an attempt to justify spending
nearly 10 million tax dollars for improvements that
increased the value of the President's property.
According to the figures, the armed forces spent
nearly $6 million, primarily for communications, at
San Clemente and Key Biscayne, but hopes to
recover $40,000 in re-usable equipment.
BART Trains Resume Service
OAKLAND—Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) trains
returned to the tracks yesterday for the first time in
five weeks.
A four-week strike by 1200 workers halted the
system until the two striking unions and BART's
board of directors last Tuesday approved a contract
boosting wages and fringe benefits 43 percent over
three years.
The walkout forced about 35,000 commuters to
turn to buses and cars during morning rush hours.
But patronage yesterday morning was 16 percent
lower than the pre-strike daily average.
The Westinghouse Electric Company announced
yesterday it would begin testing this week on BART
trains for the San Francisco and Dalv Citv routes.
Five Oklahoma Convicts Escaped
McALISTER, Okla.—Officials at Oklahoma State
Prison yesterday confirmed that at least five
convicts escaped during an eight-day riot at the
facility that lasted from July 27 to August 5

Four persons were killed in the disturbance
which caused $20 million in damages.
Gov. David Hall is described as especially alarmed
about the escape of Rex Brinlee, who was serving a
life sentence for a 1971 bomb murder of a school
teacher.
Mullin's Mental State Diagnosed
SANTA CRUZ—Stanford Asst. Psychiatry Prof.
Donald Lunde testified yesterday that Herbert
Mullin, accused of killing ten persons, was a
paranoid schizophrenic.
Lunde told the court that Mullin's mind was
"like a switchboard gone beserk" that had "some
strange connections." But he acknowledged that
other psychiatrists might interpret Mullin's mental
state differently.
Mullin's defense contends that he was insane
when he committed the 13 killings to which he has
confessed.
