about the Watergate situation until Mr.
Henry E. Petersen came to me on
April 16," Gray stated.
Petersen came to ask if Gray had
destroyed papers belonging to
convicted Watergate conspirator E.
Howard Hunt.
Gray quit a few days after his
conversation with Petersen.
The 26-year Navy veteran also
testified that fired White House
counsel John W. Dean 111 falsely
assured him last year that he was
bringing all the information
concerning the FBI Watergate to the
President's attention.
Gray said he thought it proper to
give FBI reports to Dean and that he

did not question the authority of
former White House aides Dean and
John D. Ehrlichman when they gave
him what he considered orders to
destroy papers taken from Hunt's
White House safe.
Meanwhile, sources close to former
Atty. Gen. Richard G. Kleindienst say
he is prepared to testify to the
committee that President Nixon did
not learn all the facts about Watergate
until April 15.
Petersen, assistant attorney general
in charge of the Justice Department's
Watergate investigation reportedly will
confirm Kleindienst's testimony.
Kleindienst and Petersen will be the
final witnesses appearing before the
Senate committee concludes the first
stage of its investigation.
