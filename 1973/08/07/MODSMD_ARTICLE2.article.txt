# Escondido Group Says 'Don't Pay Rent Hike’

### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
An Escondido Village group is
asking residents there to withhold
payment of a seven percent rent
increase scheduled for Sept. 1.
Cheryl Faught, chairman of the
Committee for Just Rents, said
yesterday that residents should not
pay the increase until release of a
promised University residents report
on Escondido housing.
Financial analyst Dave Bell,
conducting the University
examination, said yesterday that the
report will be out "within a couple of
weeks," but gave no definite date.
In a handbill circulated in the
Village, the committee asked residents
to withhold payment "until the
Administration study is complete and
the residents are satisfied with the
result."
According to Faught, the
University has given no firm assurances
when the report will be out, and "we
don't want to be committeed to
death." She said that the handbill was
circulated "to show the University
that we're serious, that we mean
business."
In a memo to residents issued July
31, Escondido Director Frank E.
Gallagher confirmed that while the

University study continued, "we are
moving ahead with the schedule of
rents approved by the Board of
Trustees in November, 1972."
The statement said that if the study
recommends no rent boost, rents will
be readjusted to the original figure.
Gallagher said yesterday that the
University has "a great concern" for
the problems of renters, many of
whom are on fixed or diminishing
incomes through student financial aid.
However, he called the handbill
"premature," and said it was
"inconsistent" for Faught to be
circulating the handbill since her
husband, William, is a member of the
residents' committee working with
Bell to prepare the report.
Responded Faught: "We're still two
separate people."
If a resident withholds the rent
increase — which would amount to
between $8 and $12 a month —
Gallagher could conceivably order a
hold placed on his registration
materials when the debt reached $50.
However, Faught said she didn't
think the dispute would last long
enough for any residents to run up a
$50 deficit.
"I expect a solution within a few
months," she said.
