# Commissions Due By Fall
## Future Campus Deputies Chosen 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
Plans to commission between 20
and 30 Stanford Public Safety
Department officers as reserve Santa
Clara County Sheriffs deputies are
making "good progress," Department
of Public Safety Director Marvin
Herrington said yesterday.
Herrington told the Daily that "if
all goes well," deputized Stanford
officers will patrol the campus
regularly "by the time school starts in
the fall, maybe before."
He said he has already selected six
mobile officers for deputization and
that the county has approved his
initial selections. However, before the
six become Sheriff's deputies they
must complete police academy
training and receive state identification
confirmation.
Of the six mobile officers
Herrington selected for deputization,
four have served on the department 10
years or more: Carl Gielitz, 24 years;
Herman Williams, 15 years; Donald
Lillie, 13 years; and Thomas Berubee,
10 years. Luther Long, nine years and
Ernest Brooks, three years, were also
selected.

Deputization comes as part of
Herrington's department
reorganization in which deputized
officers will replace mobile patrolmen
and all other officers will fill
community service, or foot patrol,
posts.
Herrington said deputization here
will gradually "phase out" campus
patrols by regular county sheriff's
deputies, freeing Santa Clara officers
for work in other sections of the
county.
"I'm beginning to see some move
toward our goals," Herrington
commented. "I'm very optimistic."
According to Herrington, 15 to 20
Stanford deputies should begin duty
by Jan. 1,1974.
Herrington himself holds a captain's
rank in the sheriff's reserve and Public
Safety Captains Frank Benederet and
William Wullschleger have been

deputies for approximately one year.
Red Lights, Sirens?
Deputized officers' cars may again
be equipped with red lights and sirens,
although Herrington is "still looking
into that." He explained that it is legal
for deputized men to use the
emergency lights and siren on campus,
but that he is unsure of their legality
off campus.
The new deputies will have
newly-ordered, more traditional police
uniforms, but will "not routinely" ride
with shotguns in their cars. They will
carry sidearms, handcuffs and
nightsticks as do present mobile
officers, Herrington said.
He stated that the deputies may
carry mace regularly if they are trained
to use it.
Parallel Training
Berubee and Brooks have already
completed their academy training,

Herrington said, and he hopes to have
the other four enrolled in sessions
beginning in September. Public Safety
officers who attend these academies
receive training parallel to regular
sheriff's deputies' training.
Herrington said he hopes to fill the
remaining deputy posts with officers
from within the department, but that
the department has opened the
positions to outside applicants.
The department has also begun
recruiting sergeants and lieutenants to
head the new deputized division. "We
hope to fill those positions from the
ranks, but we will need to recruit one
or two supervisors immediately,"
Herrington said.
Reorganizing Records
Another problem the department
faces is reorganization of department
records to conform to the county

although Herrington is "still looking
into that." He explained that it is legal
for deputized men to use the
emergency lights and siren on campus,
but that he is unsure of their legality
off campus.
The new deputies will have
newly-ordered, more traditional police
uniforms, but will "not routinely" ride
with shotguns in their cars. They will
carry sidearms, handcuffs and
nightsticks as do present mobile
officers, Herrington said.
He stated that the deputies may
carry mace regularly if they are trained
to use it.
Parallel Training
Berubee and Brooks have already
completed their academy training,

Herrington said, and he hopes to have
the other four enrolled in sessions
beginning in September. Public Safety
officers who attend these academies
receive training parallel to regular
sheriff's deputies' training.
Herrington said he hopes to fill the
remaining deputy posts with officers
from within the department, but that
the department has opened the
positions to outside applicants.
The department has also begun
recruiting sergeants and lieutenants to
head the new deputized division. "We
hope to fill those positions from the
ranks, but we will need to recruit one
or two supervisors immediately,"
Herrington said.
Reorganizing Records

faces is reorganization of department

Plans to commission between 20
and 30 Stanford Public Safety
Department officers as reserve Santa
Clara County Sheriffs deputies are
making "good progress," Department
of Public Safety Director Marvin
Herrington said yesterday.
Herrington told the Daily that "if
all goes well," deputized Stanford
officers will patrol the campus
regularly "by the time school starts in
the fall, maybe before."
He said he has already selected six
mobile officers for deputization and
that the county has approved his
initial selections. However, before the
six become Sheriff's deputies they
must complete police academy
training and receive state identification
confirmation.
Of the six mobile officers
Herrington selected for deputization,
four have served on the department 10
years or more: Carl Gielitz, 24 years;
Herman Williams, 15 years; Donald
Lillie, 13 years; and Thomas Berubee,
10 years. Luther Long, nine years and
Ernest Brooks, three years, were also
selected.

Deputization comes as part of
Herrington's department
reorganization in which deputized
officers will replace mobile patrolmen
and all other officers will fill
community service, or foot patrol,
posts.
Herrington said deputization here
will gradually "phase out" campus
patrols by regular county sheriff's
deputies, freeing Santa Clara officers
for work in other sections of the
county.
"I'm beginning to see some move
toward our goals," Herrington
commented. "I'm very optimistic."
According to Herrington, 15 to 20
Stanford deputies should begin duty
by Jan. 1,1974.
Herrington himself holds a captain's
rank in the sheriff's reserve and Public
Safety Captains Frank Benederet and
William Wullschleger have been

deputies for approximately one year.
Red Lights, Sirens?
Deputized officers' cars may again
be equipped with red lights and sirens,
although Herrington is "still looking
into that." He explained that it is legal
for deputized men to use the
emergency lights and siren on campus,
but that he is unsure of their legality
off campus.
