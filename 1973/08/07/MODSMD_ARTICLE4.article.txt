# Meat Shortage Hits Commissary

The meat shortage and the continued rise in food costs
have begun to affect the Commissary, supplier of most
campus dining facilities. According to Manager Sterling
Silver, supplies are very low, and the Commissary faces
difficulties in purchasing additional meat of all varieties.
"Unfortunately we can't predict too far ahead. We're
lucky to go day by day at the present time," Sterling said,
adding that the Commissary could not locate any meat
yesterday.
The Commissary supplies food to fraternities, eating
houses, row houses, dormitory dining halls, the hospital,
the convalescent home, the Faculty Club, and Tresidder,
according to Silver.
"It's my guess that we're feeding about 7000 people a
day during regular Stanford sessions," Silver explained.
The Commissary purchases about one and one-half million
pounds of beef during the regular school months.
Many Factors
Silver believes that the meat shortage can be attributed
to a conglomeration of factors. "A lot of people are
blaming the government for this whole fiasco," he said.
"But I think that the real answer is that we just had some
lousy weather all around the world."
According to Silver, there have been crop failures in
many countries this year.
He also attributes the meat shortage to the loss of
200,000 cattle in Texas during the winter, additional
losses in Colorado and Utah, a lower pork crop than usual,
problems in the Midwest due to a heavy amount of rain,
the lack of natural gas, the Mississippi Valley flood, and a
doubling of U.S. beef consumption in the last eight years.

Chain reactions often account for many shortages, he
says. The midwestern soybean crop was severely damaged
because of rain last summer, and sardine catches were
also bad. These two foods are primary ingredients
which farmers use to feed chickens, and when the soybean
and sardine shortages occurred, a natural shortage in
chickens followed.
When the chicken shortage occurred, the beef shortage
was compounded as many people substituted meat in
place of chicken.
Few Alternatives
"We've had many years where we might have had a
freeze or crop failure in one item, but we've always had
some alternatives," Silver commented. "This year they
happened to hit us all at once, so our alternatives are
lessened."
"The government should lift the freeze on beef," Silver
urged. He predicts that if slaughterhouses were allowed to
raise prices, they would not be forced to close. The price
of beef would rise 30 to 40 cents a pound, but the price
of other meats would decrease.
The University will probably be forced to raise the
price of meal plans in the future. "Some schools are
talking about increasing their board by as much as 20
percent," he said.
Silver contends that he cannot give a definite
prediction of the immediate future of the beef supply at
Stanford, but admits that it doesn't look too good.
"This is the first time in my professional career that
we've ever had anything this bad. It's even worse than
World War II," he said. "It's a pessimistic situation."

"The government should lift the freeze on beef," Silver
urged. He predicts that if slaughterhouses were allowed to
raise prices, they would not be forced to close. The price
of beef would rise 30 to 40 cents a pound, but the price
of other meats would decrease.
The University will probably be forced to raise the
price of meal plans in the future. "Some schools are
talking about increasing their board by as much as 20
percent," he said.
Silver contends that he cannot give a definite
prediction of the immediate future of the beef supply at
Stanford, but admits that it doesn't look too good.
"This is the first time in my professional career that
we've ever had anything this bad. It's even worse than
World War II," he said. "It's a pessimistic situation."

ARE THEY BEEFlNG?—Butchers of the University's Commissary, who normally process one and one-half million
pounds of meat during the regular school year, may find their workload somewhat lessened next year as the Commissary
is having difficulty procuring meat.

The meat shortage and the continued rise in food costs
have begun to affect the Commissary, supplier of most
campus dining facilities. According to Manager Sterling
Silver, supplies are very low, and the Commissary faces
difficulties in purchasing additional meat of all varieties.
"Unfortunately we can't predict too far ahead. We're
lucky to go day by day at the present time," Sterling said,
adding that the Commissary could not locate any meat
yesterday.
The Commissary supplies food to fraternities, eating
houses, row houses, dormitory dining halls, the hospital,
the convalescent home, the Faculty Club, and Tresidder,
according to Silver.
"It's my guess that we're feeding about 7000 people a
day during regular Stanford sessions," Silver explained.
The Commissary purchases about one and one-half million
pounds of beef during the regular school months.
Many Factors
Silver believes that the meat shortage can be attributed
to a conglomeration of factors. "A lot of people are
blaming the government for this whole fiasco," he said.
"But I think that the real answer is that we just had some
lousy weather all around the world."
According to Silver, there have been crop failures in
many countries this year.
He also attributes the meat shortage to the loss of
200,000 cattle in Texas during the winter, additional
losses in Colorado and Utah, a lower pork crop than usual,
problems in the Midwest due to a heavy amount of rain,
the lack of natural gas, the Mississippi Valley flood, and a
doubling of U.S. beef consumption in the last eight years.

Chain reactions often account for many shortages, he
says. The midwestern soybean crop was severely damaged
because of rain last summer, and sardine catches were
also bad. These two foods are primary ingredients
which farmers use to feed chickens, and when the soybean
and sardine shortages occurred, a natural shortage in
chickens followed.
When the chicken shortage occurred, the beef shortage
was compounded as many people substituted meat in
place of chicken.
Few Alternatives
"We've had many years where we might have had a
freeze or crop failure in one item, but we've always had
some alternatives," Silver commented. "This year they
happened to hit us all at once, so our alternatives are
lessened."
