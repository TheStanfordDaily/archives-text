# Gray Tells Of Warning President About Cover-up
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - Former acting FBI
Director L. Patrick Gray 111 testified
before the Senate Watergate
committee yesterday that he warned
President Nixon by phone July 6,
1972 that presidential staff members
were out to "mortally wound" him by
employing the FBI and Central
Intelligence Agency (CIA) to muddle
the investigation of the break-in and
cover-up.
Gray said he gave Nixon enough
indication to believe something illegal
and improper was going on in the
White House. He said he thought
Nixon would ask questions of him, but
since none came, assumed there was
no cause for alarm.

"Do you think a reasonable and
prudent man, on the basis of the
warning you gave him at that time,
would have been alerted to the fact
that his staff was engaged in something
that was improper, unlawful, illegal?"
Sen. Herman Talmadge (D-Ga.) asked
Gray.
"I do," Gray replied.
Gray recalled to the committee that
he and Lt. Gen. Vernon A. Walters Jr.,
deputy director of the CIA, came to
the conclusion very shortly after the
break-in that White House staffers
were using the federal agencies to
cloud the Watergate investigation.
Nixon paused, Gray said, and told
him, "Pat, you just continue to

conduct your aggressive and thorough
investigation."
Gray admitted that he had never
used the term obstruction of justice in
his warnings to the President, but
stated "I certainly think it was
adequate to put him on notice" that
he suspected staff members of
wrongdoing.
For two weeks, Gray said, he called
Walters to find out if the President had
contacted the deputy CIA director.
"When I heard nothing I began to
feel General Walters and I were
alarmists, that we had hold of
nothing," Gray stated.
The former FBI chief also testified
that although Nixon stated March 21
that he ordered Watergate investigators
to report directly to him, Gray was
never notified of that order.
The President did call him two days
later, Gray said, to tell him the Senate
Judiciary Committee was attacking
him unfairly. The Senate committee
ultimately refused to approve Gray's
nomination as permanent FBI
director.
Nixon told him there would always
be a place for him in the Nixon
administration and there would be
another day for revenge against the
administration's enemies, Gray
testified.
Nixon never referred to an
intensified Watergate investigation,
according to Gray.
"I was not given any orders by the
President of the United States or
anyone else to give them any facts

system.
"I've been intending to change that
system â€¢ from the beginning,"
Herrington said, "but it's going to take
some work, it's going to take some
time to make it compatible with theirs
[the county's]."
"It's taken a long time since we've
gotten it [deputization] off the
ground," Herrington reflected. The
department was plagued by a year-long
dispute between the Stanford Public
Safety Officers Association and the
University over new contract terms
and other reorganization changes.
