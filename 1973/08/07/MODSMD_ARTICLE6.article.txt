NEW YORK - The Wall Street
Journal is reporting this morning
that Vice President Spiro T.
Agnew has been given notice by
the U.S. Attorney's office in
Baltimore that he is under formal
investigation for bribery,
extortion, and tax fraud.
The newspaper says that
Agnew was given the notice last
week that the Baltimore office is
conducting the investigation.
Agnew, contacted last night,
declined to comment on the
investigation except to say that he
is "innocent of any wrong-doing"
and that he is "confident his
innocence will be affirmed."
A spokesman for Agnew said
that the Vice President is not at
liberty to discuss the allegations.
