# PA Council Adopts New Traffic Plan
## 
### 
The Palo Alto City Council last
night adopted an "immediate action
program" that calls for erecting
temporary physical barriers on
Escondido Road, Yale Street and on
streets running through College
Terrace to alleviate traffic congestion
in that residential area.
The council also referred to
committee for more study a
"short-range action program" that
would have requested the University
to close Escondido Road completely
north of Escondido School and to
accelerate funding and construction of
Campus Drive to Junipero Serra
Boulevard.
The adopted plan calls for blocking
Escondido Road near Olmstead Road
and closing the Yale Street entrance to
Escondido Village. The proposal
virtually eliminates all traffic emptying
from the village onto Stanford
Avenue.
Other barriers will be installed at
the intersections of College Street and
Amherst, Bowdoin and Columbia
Streets.
The barriers will remain for a four
to six-month period to allow city
traffic engineers to evaluate their
effectiveness. If the plan proves
ineffective, engineers will be instructed
to make minor alterations to help
improve the traffic flow.
Only if those minor alterations do
not help alleviate traffic problems in
the terrace will the city consider
implementing an alternative proposal.
The council's action came after
extensive studies of College Terrace
traffic patterns by City Traffic
Engineer Ted Noguchi.
Noguchi met with Terrace residents,
members of student and faculty
housing organizations, representatives
of the University Planning Office and
spokesmen for the California Avenue
Merchants Association last month to
discuss the plans presented to the
council last night.
Oscar Nelson, master planner for
the University, told the Daily last
month that the University could offer
no formal response to the Nogouchi
proposal, but that the closing of
Escondido was agreeable with
long-range University plans.
