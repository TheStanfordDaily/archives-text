Long-Haired Athletes
Editor:
Wednesday's Palo Alto Times
printed a United Press
International dispatch containing
several interesting quotes from
Stanford track coach Payton
Jordan.
Jordan said, "Athletes who
look dirty and have hair that
won't stay in place, don't belong
at Stanford and should not be
allowed to compete for other
schools."
Jordan, speaking in Salt Lake
City Tuesday night, reiterated his
policy that beards and goatees are
not permissable and that
"moustaches are okay and hair
can go down to the collar, but our
boys can't wear headbands to
keep it in place."
1 cannot see how long hair,
beards, or headbands could
noticeably hamper an athlete's
performance in track, as they
would in wrestling.
It thus seems that the reason
for Jordan's policy is purely an

aesthetic one. He feels that
collegiate athletes should fit an
image he believes is proper.
And, in fact, Jordan has had
disputes with long-haired athletes
dating back to 1966, when he
suspended Pat Morrison, a
promising sprinter from England
who wore a Beatle haircut.
At that time, there existed a
departmental policy against
long-haired athletes. Today no
such policy exists, and many
Stanford athletes have worn their
hair well beyond Jordan's stated
limits.
I personally feel that personal
appearance rules requiring athletes
to conform to an image are unfair.
Athletes should be subject to
the same rules as all other
students. At Stanford, this is true
to a greater extent than at many
other schools, and, in fact, the
athletic department uses the idea
of personal freedom to help
recruit prospective athletes.
Jordan, although the most
vocal, is by no means the only
Stanford coach to apply his own

tastes to arbitrary rules. I feel that
no coach should be able to impose
his own standards on personal
appearance on his athletes.
I would like to ask Mr. Jordan
to explain his stand. Space in the
Daily will be available for such an
explanation.

The Watergate investigations
often trigger recollections
concerning subject matter
touched upon in the diverse
literature that I have perused at
variouspoints in time.
In particular, the following
excerpt from Stephen Heller's
Catch-22 seems to apply equally
well to Messrs. Mitchell,
Ehrlichman, and, to the best of
my recollection, Haldeman, as to
the chaplain from the novel. I
would not be greatly surprised
were it also to apply to the
President.
"The chaplain had mastered, in

a moment of divine intuition, the
handy technique of protective
rationalization, and he was
exhiliarated by his discovery. It
was miraculous. It was almost no
trick at all to turn vice into virtue
and slander into truth, impotence
into abstinence, arrogance into
humility, plunder into
philanthropy, thievery into honor,
blasphemy into wisdom, brutality
into patriotism, and sadism into
justice. Anybody could do it; it
required no brains at all. It merely
required no character."
This is perhaps what Nietzsche
intended when he wrote, "One is
best punished for one's virtues."

concerning subject matter
touched upon in the diverse
literature that I have perused at
variouspoints in time.
In particular, the following
excerpt from Stephen Heller's
Catch-22 seems to apply equally
well to Messrs. Mitchell,
Ehrlichman, and, to the best of
my recollection, Haldeman, as to
the chaplain from the novel. I
would not be greatly surprised
were it also to apply to the
President.
"The chaplain had mastered, in

a moment of divine intuition, the
handy technique of protective
rationalization, and he was
exhiliarated by his discovery. It
was miraculous. It was almost no
trick at all to turn vice into virtue
and slander into truth, impotence
into abstinence, arrogance into
humility, plunder into
philanthropy, thievery into honor,
blasphemy into wisdom, brutality
into patriotism, and sadism into
justice. Anybody could do it; it
required no brains at all. It merely
required no character."
This is perhaps what Nietzsche
intended when he wrote, "One is
best punished for one's virtues."

Wednesday's Palo Alto Times
printed a United Press
International dispatch containing
several interesting quotes from
Stanford track coach Payton
Jordan.
Jordan said, "Athletes who
look dirty and have hair that
won't stay in place, don't belong
at Stanford and should not be
allowed to compete for other
schools."
Jordan, speaking in Salt Lake
City Tuesday night, reiterated his
policy that beards and goatees are
not permissable and that
"moustaches are okay and hair
can go down to the collar, but our
boys can't wear headbands to
keep it in place."
1 cannot see how long hair,
beards, or headbands could
noticeably hamper an athlete's
performance in track, as they
would in wrestling.
It thus seems that the reason
for Jordan's policy is purely an

aesthetic one. He feels that
collegiate athletes should fit an
image he believes is proper.
And, in fact, Jordan has had
disputes with long-haired athletes
dating back to 1966, when he
suspended Pat Morrison, a
promising sprinter from England
who wore a Beatle haircut.
At that time, there existed a
departmental policy against
long-haired athletes. Today no
such policy exists, and many
Stanford athletes have worn their
hair well beyond Jordan's stated
limits.
I personally feel that personal
appearance rules requiring athletes
to conform to an image are unfair.
Athletes should be subject to
the same rules as all other
students. At Stanford, this is true
to a greater extent than at many
other schools, and, in fact, the
athletic department uses the idea
of personal freedom to help
recruit prospective athletes.
Jordan, although the most
vocal, is by no means the only
Stanford coach to apply his own

tastes to arbitrary rules. I feel that
no coach should be able to impose
his own standards on personal
appearance on his athletes.
I would like to ask Mr. Jordan
to explain his stand. Space in the
Daily will be available for such an
explanation.
