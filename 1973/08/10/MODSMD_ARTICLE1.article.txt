# 19 Murders Unearthed In Houston
## 
### 
HOUSTON — Two teenage boys
yesterday told police that they were
involved in what police called the
biggest mass murder in U.S. history.
Police have already found at least
19 bodies: 15 teenage boys shot to
death and two strangled near a
Houston boat shed, and two more
were found dead at another site, and
police expect to find more bodies.
David Brooks, 18, has "admitted
taking part in practically all of the
killings over a three-year period,"
saying he knew of "25 or 30"
homosexual slayings, say police.
Aided In Murders
Brooks says that he and Elmer
Henley, 17, aided a 34-year old
homosexual electrician, Dean Corll, in
the murders.
Henley, who said he killed Corll
Wednesday night, first told police that
Corll alone sexually assaulted and
murdered all the victims.
Henley led police to the boat shed,
where they found the 17 bodies. Last
night, Henley led police to a second
spot, in a pine forest near Sam
Ray burn Reservoir, 120 miles
northeast of Houston, where, he said,
more bodies were buried.
Third Site
Brooks told police of a third burial
site — High Island, a Gulf Coast town
near Galveston.
Henley claims he knew of the burial
sites because Corll bragged of the
killings and told him of the sites.
However, Brooks' testimony
implicates Henley as at least an
accessory.
Both Brooks and Henley claim that
Corll sexually molested all the victims
before killing them.
Police used shovels and heavy
equipment to unearth the bodies at
the rusty tin boat shed. They said that
the victims, all males from the
Houston area, ranged in age from 13
to 19 years, and that all had been
sexually assaulted prior to being killed.
One had been missing since 1971.
Decomposed Skeletons
The decomposed skeletons were
found in lime-soaked graves six feet
underground.
Mrs. M.E. Meynier, owner of the
boat storage area Corll rented, called
him "a very nice man, very gentle
man ... who loved to be around
kids."
According to Henley, an
eighth-grade dropout, Corll held a
party Wednesday night for Henley,
another man, and a girl. The three
sniffed acrylic paint out of a bag and
passed out.
"He woke us up and was tying us
up," Henley told reporters yesterday,
adding that Corll said he would kill
them after molesting them.
However, Henley said he talked
Corll into releasing him so that he
could do the killing himself. He then
grabbed Corll's gun and shot him.
