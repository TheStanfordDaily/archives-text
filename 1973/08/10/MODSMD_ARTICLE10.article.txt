# Nothing's A Kick Anymore
## Summer '73: Where Are We? 
### 
Viae Kershner

If the current nostalgia craze
continues, someday authors,
filmmakers, and songwriters will
look back at this, the summer of
1973.
What will they see? Where are
we, the youth culture, "at this
point in time," to use the
contemporary catchphrase?
First, this summer will always
be remembered for the Watergate
hearings—the daily televised
revelations. For the youth culture,
each new charge affirms its belief
in the unmitigated evil of Nixon.
It's not only Nixon who is
corrupt, however, it is the big oil
companies and the meatpacking
industry which are causing
shortages. To many of us, the
shortages and high prices are only
another capitalist plot to squeeze
another dollar from us.
But it would be wrong to say
that Watergate and shortages have
deeply shaken the faith of young
people in American government
and industry any more than

Vietnam had.
At least in the late 19605, we
had some beliefs—free love, peace,
dope could cure the world. If the
whole world could be a
Woodstock, everything would be
all right.
Now, in 1973, we hear they
had a rock festival even bigger
than Woodstock. But, from the
information we receive
second-hand, it wasn't the same:
too comfortable, too
self-conscious.
Marijuana is becoming
respectable, rock festivals are
becoming respectable, Tom
Bradley is respectable enough for
LA to elect him mayor .. . and
for us, just about everything that
isn't Haldemananderlichmanic is
OK.
This is the only summer where,
in the Doonesberry cartoon strip,
Zonker Harris could be acquitted
on a marijuana charge simply
because he alleged the police

bugged his hotel room.
It's 1973 now. We've been
through it all and it's all no longer
a kick. We have to grasp for
straws—hoping to find something
to believe in.
That's why the past that Karen
Carpenter yearns for, Commander
Cody smokes at, and Paul Simon
snaps pictures of suddenly
becomes relevant. But we, as a
culture, have to do more than just
try to live in an earlier era. We
have' to create our own symbols,
our own things to believe in.
Right now. somewhere, some
people are "into" the things
which will become a national
craze in a few years.
What are these things?
Japanese cars with engines that
twang? Playing real country
music? Taking trips to Red China
and imitating their culture? Hard

physical labor and a return to the
farms? Bisexuality?
Hopefully, some new elements
(not necessarily the ones listed
above) will enter our culture and
we'll have something to believe in
again.
These new elements will join
with beer, wine, dope, football,
Coca-Cola, cruising Main, the
beach, boring summer jobs, and
other hallmarks of current youth
culture to produce a new and even
better one.
Here in 1973, music, as well as
culture as a whole, isn't doing
much to excite anyone. It's an
aimless time, sort of like the time
between the death of President
Kennedy and the appearance of
the Beatles on Ed Sullivan. But
things will get better soon.

and industry any more than

Vietnam had.
At least in the late 19605, we
had some beliefs—free love, peace,
dope could cure the world. If the
whole world could be a
Woodstock, everything would be
all right.
Now, in 1973, we hear they
had a rock festival even bigger
than Woodstock. But, from the
information we receive
second-hand, it wasn't the same:
too comfortable, too
self-conscious.
Marijuana is becoming
respectable, rock festivals are
becoming respectable, Tom
Bradley is respectable enough for
LA to elect him mayor .. . and
for us, just about everything that
isn't Haldemananderlichmanic is
OK.
This is the only summer where,
in the Doonesberry cartoon strip,
Zonker Harris could be acquitted
on a marijuana charge simply
because he alleged the police

bugged his hotel room.
It's 1973 now. We've been
through it all and it's all no longer
a kick. We have to grasp for
straws—hoping to find something
to believe in.
That's why the past that Karen
Carpenter yearns for, Commander
Cody smokes at, and Paul Simon
snaps pictures of suddenly
becomes relevant. But we, as a
culture, have to do more than just
try to live in an earlier era. We
have' to create our own symbols,
our own things to believe in.
Right now. somewhere, some
people are "into" the things
which will become a national
craze in a few years.
What are these things?
Japanese cars with engines that
twang? Playing real country
music? Taking trips to Red China
and imitating their culture? Hard

physical labor and a return to the
farms? Bisexuality?
Hopefully, some new elements
(not necessarily the ones listed
above) will enter our culture and
we'll have something to believe in
again.
These new elements will join
with beer, wine, dope, football,
Coca-Cola, cruising Main, the
beach, boring summer jobs, and
other hallmarks of current youth
culture to produce a new and even
better one.
Here in 1973, music, as well as
culture as a whole, isn't doing
much to excite anyone. It's an
aimless time, sort of like the time
between the death of President
Kennedy and the appearance of
the Beatles on Ed Sullivan. But
things will get better soon.

If the current nostalgia craze
continues, someday authors,
filmmakers, and songwriters will
look back at this, the summer of
1973.
What will they see? Where are
we, the youth culture, "at this
point in time," to use the
contemporary catchphrase?
First, this summer will always
be remembered for the Watergate
hearings—the daily televised
revelations. For the youth culture,
each new charge affirms its belief
in the unmitigated evil of Nixon.
It's not only Nixon who is
corrupt, however, it is the big oil
companies and the meatpacking
industry which are causing
shortages. To many of us, the
shortages and high prices are only
another capitalist plot to squeeze
another dollar from us.
But it would be wrong to say
that Watergate and shortages have
deeply shaken the faith of young
people in American government
and industry any more than

Vietnam had.
