Anti-Union Conduct
(Editor s Note: These excerpts are
taken from a letter written to
Doug Barton, University Staff
Legal Counsel.)
We are writing to inform you
of the anti-union conduct of the
food service director of Wilbur
Food Service, Mrs. Kathy Malik.
We have confirmed reports that,
subsequent to the NLRB
certification, she told several food
service employees not to join the
union until they were absolutely
sure what they were doing and
what the union had to offer in
comparison with what the
University had to offer.
She told the workers that she
was giving them this advice
because she was interested in their
welfare and didn't want them to
do something that wouldn't
benefit them.
U.S.E.'s main organizer of the
food service, Rafael Verbera, was
also harassed by Mrs. Malik while

distributing membership cards to
workers at Wilbur last June.
Although workers there are free
to discuss any other matters
during working hours, Mrs. Malik
prevented them on at least one
occasion from talking ab<i»t union
membership with Mr. Verbera.
When Mr. Verbera first talked
to workers at Wilbur about joining
U.S.E., they were enthusiastic.
When he returned to pick up their
membership cards they were
reluctant to talk to him. Upon
questioning these workers on why
their attitudes had changed, they
told him they were reluctant
because of what Mrs. Malik had
said.
Whether employees join a
union is strictly their business and
no supervisor should interfere in
this matter. Mrs. Malik was
obviously using her position as
supervisor to discourage workers
from joining U.S.E.
We request that Stanford write
a letter reprimanding her for her
actions to be posted in public
areas where she supervises.
