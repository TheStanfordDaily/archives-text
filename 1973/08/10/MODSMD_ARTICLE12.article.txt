# Attack On Prison Movement
## Why The Chino Prosecutions? 
### 
Mick Goldstein

A recent column on this page discussed the
complete failure of the evidence to support Andrea
and Doug Burt's convictions in the Chino escape
case.
The vigor of the governmental attack is
unquestionable: some time ago, 300 FBI and other
agents met to discuss their work on the case; the
federal harboring prosecutions are being supervised
by the "Justice" Department's Internal Security
Division and its grand inquisitor, Guy Goodwin; and
San Bernardino County wants $500,000 from the
state to reimburse it? costs!
The criminal justice system is already structured
so that guilt or innocence is one of the less relevant
variables: at least 95 percent of defendants
minimize their risks by pleading guilty to reduced
charges, whether they have committed any crime or
not.
But why all the special effort to convict the
Chino defendants? What this and other political
cases show is that the system shifts into high gear
when there is an opportunity to attack political
movements that threaten the foundations of an
exploitative society.
Prison Conditions
An earlier article spoke of the detestable
conditions in the county jails in which Andrea and
Doug and thousands of others are kept; state prison
conditions are different, but equally brutal and
destructive. In recent years prisoners have shown
increasing awareness that they have done nothing to
deserve such treatment.
Despite serious risks of retaliation, they have
reacted by publicizing their grievances, petitioning
the authorities, organizing prisoners' unions, filing
lawsuits, calling strikes when necessary, and, when
circumstances are desperate, engaging in
spontaneous violence or organized rebellion.
These developments and the growing outside
support that helps make them possible face
incredible official resistance. This resistance exists
not bceause of the violence that may result from
perpetual refusals to meet just demands, but rather
because prisoners and outsiders are mobilizing to
make the demands at all and to challenge the prison
system's authority to crush human beings.
At this moment the House Internal Security
Committee is investigating the movement to support
prisoners' rights. This is because HISC recognizes
the contradiction between the idea that the
convicted class has rights and the concept that the
ruling classes are entitled to maintain a society so
unjst that it generates a massive amount of crime.
Cover For Crime
The Chino prosecution is a three-pronged attack
on the prison movement. Fist, it has attempted to
paint the movement as a cover for plotting escapes
such as Ronald Beaty's. At least six people on
Beaty's long list of those whose freedom he wishes
to trade for his own were in touch with him because
they were supporting his and others' attempts to
vindicate legal rights through the courts.
Beaty claimed these communications channels
were used to plan his escape, with a code where
legal terms connoted various elements of the escape
plan. (Referring to one inmate's letter to noted
prison lawyer Fay Stender, the prosecutor claimed
that the man meant "escape" when he wrote her
asking about his "habeas corpus petition"!)
The point is to discredit the prison movement

publicly and to justify its repression by the
Department of Corrections.
Second, corrections officials have spent several
years claiming that "radical lawyers" are responsible
for violence and other threats to security in the
prisons.
The courts have consistently rejected this
argument, leaving lawyers who work with prisoners
as the one group of people who at least theoretically
have the right to communicate with prisoners
without being subject to harassment and censorship.
Beaty's tale neatly implicates five lawyers or
people working with lawyers, providing the
Department of Corrections (and its recent ally,
HISC) with a new element of credibility when it
tries to present lawyers as a security threat.
Finally, Andrea and Doug's convictions represent
an obvious attempt to intimidate individuals
associated with the prison movement. If supportive
contact with a prisoner can lead to a murder
conviction, the stakes are being raised mighty high.
Just Another Target
The attack on the prison movement is new, since
the target is new. The history of a bourgeois
democracy's illegal attacks on the Left spans a
century, however. In contemporary times this has
meant the use of surveillance, infiltration, and
provocateurs against the peace and student
movements, and police executions of the Black
Panthers.
Today Venceremos (itself a subject of a special
HISC report) is one of a number of revolutionary
organizations perceived as a threat to the corporate
imperialist state. Witnesses have testified that Beaty
knew that state and federal authorities would go
wild over his infiltration of Venceremos and his
claim that that organization executed his escape.
Besides the attempt to discredit Venceremos as a
rational revolutionary group, this provided the
excuse to arrest a number of its members and
former members, send some of those to prison,
conduct searches of members' homes at gunpoint,
and gather intelligence by seizing such items as
address books (while threatening conspiracy
prosecutions).
Aiding Navajos Is Suspect
Those arrested in Arizona on federal harboring
chargees, including this author, have never been in
Venceremos. As one FBI agent explained, the fact
that we had worked in a school-board election
campaign on behalf of Navajos who wanted
self-determination was enough to generate
suspicion.
A little knowledge of history and of the legal
system's function as protector of the existing
distribution of wealth and power in a capitalist
society prepares those who are working for radical
social change, in the prison movement or on other
fronts, for invasions of their liberty by the state.
The expenditure of tremendous resources and
the resort to consistent illegality in the prosecution
of the Chino case are explained by its function as an
attack on the prison movement and on the Left. But
permitting such governmental abuses to continue
endangers all but those powerful enough to control
the destructive machinery themselves.

meant the use of surveillance, infiltration, and
provocateurs against the peace and student
movements, and police executions of the Black
Panthers.
Today Venceremos (itself a subject of a special
HISC report) is one of a number of revolutionary
organizations perceived as a threat to the corporate
imperialist state. Witnesses have testified that Beaty
knew that state and federal authorities would go
wild over his infiltration of Venceremos and his
claim that that organization executed his escape.
Besides the attempt to discredit Venceremos as a
rational revolutionary group, this provided the
excuse to arrest a number of its members and
former members, send some of those to prison,
conduct searches of members' homes at gunpoint,
and gather intelligence by seizing such items as
address books (while threatening conspiracy
prosecutions).
Aiding Navajos Is Suspect
Those arrested in Arizona on federal harboring
chargees, including this author, have never been in
Venceremos. As one FBI agent explained, the fact
that we had worked in a school-board election
campaign on behalf of Navajos who wanted
self-determination was enough to generate
suspicion.
A little knowledge of history and of the legal
system's function as protector of the existing
distribution of wealth and power in a capitalist
society prepares those who are working for radical
social change, in the prison movement or on other
fronts, for invasions of their liberty by the state.
The expenditure of tremendous resources and
the resort to consistent illegality in the prosecution
of the Chino case are explained by its function as an
attack on the prison movement and on the Left. But
permitting such governmental abuses to continue
endangers all but those powerful enough to control
the destructive machinery themselves.

A recent column on this page discussed the
complete failure of the evidence to support Andrea
and Doug Burt's convictions in the Chino escape
case.
The vigor of the governmental attack is
unquestionable: some time ago, 300 FBI and other
agents met to discuss their work on the case; the
federal harboring prosecutions are being supervised
by the "Justice" Department's Internal Security
Division and its grand inquisitor, Guy Goodwin; and
San Bernardino County wants $500,000 from the
state to reimburse it? costs!
The criminal justice system is already structured
so that guilt or innocence is one of the less relevant
variables: at least 95 percent of defendants
minimize their risks by pleading guilty to reduced
charges, whether they have committed any crime or
not.
But why all the special effort to convict the
Chino defendants? What this and other political
cases show is that the system shifts into high gear
when there is an opportunity to attack political
movements that threaten the foundations of an
exploitative society.
Prison Conditions
An earlier article spoke of the detestable
conditions in the county jails in which Andrea and
Doug and thousands of others are kept; state prison
conditions are different, but equally brutal and
destructive. In recent years prisoners have shown
increasing awareness that they have done nothing to
deserve such treatment.
Despite serious risks of retaliation, they have
reacted by publicizing their grievances, petitioning
the authorities, organizing prisoners' unions, filing
lawsuits, calling strikes when necessary, and, when
circumstances are desperate, engaging in
spontaneous violence or organized rebellion.
These developments and the growing outside
support that helps make them possible face
incredible official resistance. This resistance exists
not bceause of the violence that may result from
perpetual refusals to meet just demands, but rather
because prisoners and outsiders are mobilizing to
make the demands at all and to challenge the prison
system's authority to crush human beings.
At this moment the House Internal Security
Committee is investigating the movement to support
prisoners' rights. This is because HISC recognizes
the contradiction between the idea that the
convicted class has rights and the concept that the
ruling classes are entitled to maintain a society so
unjst that it generates a massive amount of crime.
Cover For Crime
The Chino prosecution is a three-pronged attack
on the prison movement. Fist, it has attempted to
paint the movement as a cover for plotting escapes
such as Ronald Beaty's. At least six people on
Beaty's long list of those whose freedom he wishes
to trade for his own were in touch with him because
they were supporting his and others' attempts to
vindicate legal rights through the courts.
Beaty claimed these communications channels
were used to plan his escape, with a code where
legal terms connoted various elements of the escape
plan. (Referring to one inmate's letter to noted
prison lawyer Fay Stender, the prosecutor claimed
that the man meant "escape" when he wrote her
asking about his "habeas corpus petition"!)
The point is to discredit the prison movement

publicly and to justify its repression by the
Department of Corrections.
Second, corrections officials have spent several
years claiming that "radical lawyers" are responsible
for violence and other threats to security in the
prisons.
The courts have consistently rejected this
argument, leaving lawyers who work with prisoners
as the one group of people who at least theoretically
have the right to communicate with prisoners
without being subject to harassment and censorship.
Beaty's tale neatly implicates five lawyers or
people working with lawyers, providing the
Department of Corrections (and its recent ally,
HISC) with a new element of credibility when it
tries to present lawyers as a security threat.
Finally, Andrea and Doug's convictions represent
an obvious attempt to intimidate individuals
associated with the prison movement. If supportive
contact with a prisoner can lead to a murder
conviction, the stakes are being raised mighty high.
Just Another Target
The attack on the prison movement is new, since
the target is new. The history of a bourgeois
democracy's illegal attacks on the Left spans a

on the prison movement. Fist, it has attempted to
paint the movement as a cover for plotting escapes
such as Ronald Beaty's. At least six people on
Beaty's long list of those whose freedom he wishes
to trade for his own were in touch with him because
they were supporting his and others' attempts to
vindicate legal rights through the courts.
Beaty claimed these communications channels
were used to plan his escape, with a code where
legal terms connoted various elements of the escape
plan. (Referring to one inmate's letter to noted
prison lawyer Fay Stender, the prosecutor claimed
that the man meant "escape" when he wrote her
asking about his "habeas corpus petition"!)
The point is to discredit the prison movement

publicly and to justify its repression by the
Department of Corrections.
Second, corrections officials have spent several
years claiming that "radical lawyers" are responsible
for violence and other threats to security in the
prisons.
The courts have consistently rejected this
argument, leaving lawyers who work with prisoners
as the one group of people who at least theoretically
have the right to communicate with prisoners
without being subject to harassment and censorship.
Beaty's tale neatly implicates five lawyers or
people working with lawyers, providing the
Department of Corrections (and its recent ally,
HISC) with a new element of credibility when it
tries to present lawyers as a security threat.
Finally, Andrea and Doug's convictions represent
an obvious attempt to intimidate individuals
associated with the prison movement. If supportive
contact with a prisoner can lead to a murder
conviction, the stakes are being raised mighty high.
Just Another Target
The attack on the prison movement is new, since
the target is new. The history of a bourgeois
democracy's illegal attacks on the Left spans a
century, however. In contemporary times this has
meant the use of surveillance, infiltration, and
provocateurs against the peace and student
movements, and police executions of the Black
Panthers.
Today Venceremos (itself a subject of a special
HISC report) is one of a number of revolutionary
organizations perceived as a threat to the corporate
imperialist state. Witnesses have testified that Beaty
knew that state and federal authorities would go
wild over his infiltration of Venceremos and his
claim that that organization executed his escape.
Besides the attempt to discredit Venceremos as a
rational revolutionary group, this provided the
excuse to arrest a number of its members and
former members, send some of those to prison,
conduct searches of members' homes at gunpoint,
and gather intelligence by seizing such items as
address books (while threatening conspiracy
prosecutions).
Aiding Navajos Is Suspect
Those arrested in Arizona on federal harboring
chargees, including this author, have never been in
Venceremos. As one FBI agent explained, the fact
that we had worked in a school-board election
campaign on behalf of Navajos who wanted
self-determination was enough to generate
suspicion.
A little knowledge of history and of the legal
system's function as protector of the existing
distribution of wealth and power in a capitalist
society prepares those who are working for radical
social change, in the prison movement or on other
fronts, for invasions of their liberty by the state.
The expenditure of tremendous resources and
the resort to consistent illegality in the prosecution
of the Chino case are explained by its function as an
attack on the prison movement and on the Left. But
permitting such governmental abuses to continue
endangers all but those powerful enough to control
the destructive machinery themselves.

A recent column on this page discussed the
complete failure of the evidence to support Andrea
and Doug Burt's convictions in the Chino escape
case.
The vigor of the governmental attack is
unquestionable: some time ago, 300 FBI and other
agents met to discuss their work on the case; the
federal harboring prosecutions are being supervised
by the "Justice" Department's Internal Security
Division and its grand inquisitor, Guy Goodwin; and
San Bernardino County wants $500,000 from the
state to reimburse it? costs!
The criminal justice system is already structured
so that guilt or innocence is one of the less relevant
variables: at least 95 percent of defendants
minimize their risks by pleading guilty to reduced
charges, whether they have committed any crime or
not.
But why all the special effort to convict the
Chino defendants? What this and other political
cases show is that the system shifts into high gear
when there is an opportunity to attack political
movements that threaten the foundations of an
exploitative society.
Prison Conditions
An earlier article spoke of the detestable
conditions in the county jails in which Andrea and
Doug and thousands of others are kept; state prison
conditions are different, but equally brutal and
destructive. In recent years prisoners have shown
increasing awareness that they have done nothing to
deserve such treatment.
Despite serious risks of retaliation, they have
reacted by publicizing their grievances, petitioning
the authorities, organizing prisoners' unions, filing
lawsuits, calling strikes when necessary, and, when
circumstances are desperate, engaging in
spontaneous violence or organized rebellion.
These developments and the growing outside
support that helps make them possible face
incredible official resistance. This resistance exists
not bceause of the violence that may result from
perpetual refusals to meet just demands, but rather
because prisoners and outsiders are mobilizing to
make the demands at all and to challenge the prison
system's authority to crush human beings.
At this moment the House Internal Security
Committee is investigating the movement to support
prisoners' rights. This is because HISC recognizes
the contradiction between the idea that the
convicted class has rights and the concept that the
ruling classes are entitled to maintain a society so
unjst that it generates a massive amount of crime.
