LACKEY: "Warden? Warden
Hoff?"
WARDEN: "Yes, what is it this
time, Lackey?"
LACKEY: "Sir, as part of my
intensive research into Humane
Trends in Modern Penology. ..
WARDEN (interrupting): "I
thought they scrapped that
program for lack of research
material?"
LACKEY: "Well, not quite sir.
When the Supreme Court almost
abolished the death penalty, I was
sent back to work, in hope of
finding some such trends."
WARDEN: "And?"
LACKEY: "And it appears to
be a false alarm. Almost every
state, including ours, is
re-establishing capital punishment.

In fact, our own Department of
Corrections is now seeking huge
funds for Psychosurgery Research
and two new maximum security
Adjustment Centers. In addition,
the Adult Authority has
announced a revised 'get-tough'
policy toward the granting of
paroles."
WARDEN (jubilantly):
"Lackey, that's the best news I've
heard in a long time! Finally some
people are getting serious about
protecting society!"
LACKEY: "Anyway, sir, what
I came to report is that there has
been another prison riot."
WARDEN (concerned):
"Where?"
LACKEY: "Oklahoma."
WARDEN: "Any damage?"
LACKEY: "Yes, the convicts

nearly burnt the prison to the
ground. Several inmates are dead,
but all hostages were released."
WARDEN (relieved): "Well at
least there was no loss of life."
LACKEY: "Oh no sir, I said
that several inmates died."
WARDEN (irritated): "Lackey,
when will you get that idealistic
poppycock out of your head? I
meant human lives—those men
who died were animals."
LACKEY: "Sir, I beg to differ
with you. According to the
definition of a human as a
warm-blooded mammal with.. .."
WARDEN (very upset):
"Lackey, how many times do I
have to tell you? Convicts are
animals, coldblooded animals!
They'd all rape their mothers if
they hadn't already killed them!"
LACKEY: "Aren't you
exaggerating, sir?"
WARDEN: "Lackey, I've dealt
with prisoners all my life—they
rape, rob, and kill each other. I
know no humans like that. And
society knows they're animals,
too. That's why people get more
upset about someone drowning a
puppy than us executing a
prisoner."
LACKEY: "But puppies are
animals, too."
WARDEN: "Ah yes. But
puppies are warm. They feel.
They think. They snuggle up to
your face."
LACKEY: "But warden, can't
prisoners do the same?"
WARDEN (exasperated):
"Lackey, look. It's been a hard
day and I don't have time to deal
with your snivelling inanities. So
what if convicts can cry, laugh,
think, and feel! They're still
animals!"
LACKEY: "But sir, if puppies
and prisoners are both animals,
why can't society care about
both?"
WARDEN (whistfully): "I
guess, Lackey, that it just isn't
humanly possible."
LACKEY: "Does that mean
there's a bit of animal in eich of
us?"
WARDEN: "I guess it does,
Lackey. I guess it does.
