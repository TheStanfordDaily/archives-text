# Judge Denies Move To Block Apartment Licensing Law
## 
### CHARLES RAY 
Santa Clara County Judge John M. Brenner Monday
refused to enjoin Palo Alto's recently-enacted apartment
licensing ordinance. The judge will, however, issue a
preliminary injunction against sections in the ordinance
pertaining to housing discrimination.
Brenner's decision prohibits criminal prosecution and
denial or revocation of an owner's license for
discrimination until the court rules on the validity of
those penalties.
Although the City cannot prosecute under the sections
pertaining to discrimination, it is not restrained from
taking action against a license on the basis of any unlawful
acts other than illegal housing discrimination.
He explained the decision stating, "The subject matter
has been partially covered by general law couched in such
terms as to indicate clearly that a paramount state
concern will not tolerate further or additional local
action."
The controversial ordinance requires all apartment
managers to post the terms and conditions of rental, and
the numbers and types of vacancies for present and future
tenants.
Assistant city attorney, Marilyn Norek, who drafted
the ordinance, stated, "We are confident that the court

eventually will determine that these sections complement
state law on housing discrimination and do not conflict
with it. In the meantime, the apartment licensing
program will continue as scheduled."
Norek said the city will appeal the decision, but that
the date of that appeal is uncertain yet.
E.C. Christianson, a spokesman for Tri-County
Apartment Association, was pleased with the decision.
"Things went as predicted. Judge Brenner's decision fully
sustains the views the association has been repeatedly
urging upon deaf ears."
The association along with Lorraine Wilson, John M.
Klimp and Don S. Sevy filed suit against the ordinance
July 19.
Palo Alto Mayor Kirke W. Comstock, disappointed
with the decision, commented, "I'm sorry he [Judge
Brenner] took part of the ordinance and not all. I'm
confident that the section concerning discrimination will
pass though."
But Jack Giosso, President of the Palo Alto Real Estate
Board said, "Had the ordinance passed, it would have hurt
the competition in the business drastically. And since
most of the businesses are small, the ordinance would
place a tremendous hardship on those who run them."
