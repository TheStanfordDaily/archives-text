# Ex-Football Mascot Williams
## Reagan Fires Indian Adviser 
### SCOTT FIELDS 
H.D. Timm Williams,
football mascot here for 20
years, was fired Tuesday by
Governor Ronald Reagan from his
position as Indian affairs adviser.
Williams was the first high-level
adviser on Indian matters to any
California governor.
For two and a half years,
Williams, a full-blooded Yurok
Indian, has served as a link
between Reagan and the state's
200,000 Indians.
Although Williams has received
a dismissal notice, he says that he
does not intend to leave. "I plan
to stay until I can tell the
Governor what should be done—if
not by me personally, that's fine.
But someone should tell the
Governor of the Indian's plight in
this state."
Williams' dismissal notice set
no deadline for leaving his office.
James E. Jenkins, director of
public affairs and spokesman for
Reagan, said Williams was fired
because he did not fulfill certain
conditions on his contract.
Jenkins would not elaborate on
specific failures, but said Williams
did "absolutely nothing" to solve
Indian problems.
Williams appeared to be upset
over his dismissal. "I haven't been
able to get along with the Reagan
staff . . . because I have been
persistent," he said. Williams was
referring to his repeated efforts
"in pushing Indian programs."
"In all that time," Williams
told reporters Tuesday, "I never

got a chance to sit down with the
governor and talk about the
problems of the California
Indians."
Williams said that he had only
met with the governor twice
during his years as adviser. The
first time he had his picture
taken with the governor; the
second time he and a group of
Indian leaders met with Reagan.
Williams said that his purpose at
this meeting was "to keep the
Indians in line."
"The people around the
governor wouldn't let me get to
talk to him—it was sort of a
Watergate mentality," Williams
asserted.
The Reagan administration
"has put the California Indian at
the bottom of the totem pole," he
said.
Williams has said that he
accomplished much while he held
the $18,000 per year position. He

stated that he has pushed for
creation of dental clinics that
serve Indians at the local level, has
helped establish Indian
campgrounds in the state, and has
placed between 20 and 30 Indians
on college staffs.
State Senator Mervyn Dynally,
(D— L.A.), co-chairman of the
Senate Ad Hoc Committee on
Indian Affairs and author of
legislation to set up an expanded
Indian Advisory Board, called
Reagan's decision
"disheartening."
"Prince Lightfoot," as Williams
was known during his mascot
days, entertained football fans for
20 consecutive seasons by dancing
at the sidelines in full Indian
costume whenever Stanford
scored a touchdown. His
involvement with the University
ended last year when the Indian
was banned as the school symbol
because of its alleged degrading
racial nature.

Indians in line."
"The people around the
governor wouldn't let me get to
talk to him—it was sort of a
Watergate mentality," Williams
asserted.
The Reagan administration
"has put the California Indian at
the bottom of the totem pole," he
said.
Williams has said that he
accomplished much while he held
the $18,000 per year position. He

stated that he has pushed for
creation of dental clinics that
serve Indians at the local level, has
helped establish Indian
campgrounds in the state, and has
placed between 20 and 30 Indians
on college staffs.
State Senator Mervyn Dynally,
(D— L.A.), co-chairman of the
Senate Ad Hoc Committee on
Indian Affairs and author of
legislation to set up an expanded
Indian Advisory Board, called
Reagan's decision
"disheartening."
"Prince Lightfoot," as Williams
was known during his mascot
days, entertained football fans for
20 consecutive seasons by dancing
at the sidelines in full Indian
costume whenever Stanford
scored a touchdown. His
involvement with the University
ended last year when the Indian
was banned as the school symbol
because of its alleged degrading
racial nature.
H.D. Timm Williams,
football mascot here for 20
years, was fired Tuesday by
Governor Ronald Reagan from his
position as Indian affairs adviser.
Williams was the first high-level
adviser on Indian matters to any
California governor.
For two and a half years,
Williams, a full-blooded Yurok
Indian, has served as a link
between Reagan and the state's
200,000 Indians.
Although Williams has received
a dismissal notice, he says that he
does not intend to leave. "I plan
to stay until I can tell the
Governor what should be done—if
not by me personally, that's fine.
But someone should tell the
Governor of the Indian's plight in
this state."
Williams' dismissal notice set
no deadline for leaving his office.
James E. Jenkins, director of
public affairs and spokesman for
Reagan, said Williams was fired
because he did not fulfill certain
conditions on his contract.
Jenkins would not elaborate on
specific failures, but said Williams
did "absolutely nothing" to solve
Indian problems.
Williams appeared to be upset
over his dismissal. "I haven't been
able to get along with the Reagan
staff . . . because I have been
persistent," he said. Williams was
referring to his repeated efforts
"in pushing Indian programs."
"In all that time," Williams
told reporters Tuesday, "I never

got a chance to sit down with the
governor and talk about the
problems of the California
Indians."
Williams said that he had only
met with the governor twice
during his years as adviser. The
first time he had his picture
taken with the governor; the
second time he and a group of
Indian leaders met with Reagan.
Williams said that his purpose at
this meeting was "to keep the
Indians in line."
