### 
The Department of Health, Education and Welfare has
awarded a $210,400 contract to the School of Medicine here
to develop a model graduate training program in primary care,
utilizing a team approach to the delivery of family health
services, dean Clayton Rich announced Tuesday.
The program would qualify trainees to take board
examinations for certification in internal medicine or
pediatrics.
The school intends to admit at least 12 trainees to the
program during the three-year period of the contract,
including four part-time residents in the first year. Eventually,
there will be two trainees in medicine and two in pediatrics
each year.
