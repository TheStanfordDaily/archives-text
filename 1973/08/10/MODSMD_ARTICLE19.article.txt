# PA Labor Talks Stalled
## 
### 
Labor negotiations for some
450 Palo Aito city employees are
at a standstill, but the threat of a
strike has been at least
temporarily averted.
The workers, who are
represented by Service Employees
International Union (SEIU) local
715 A, will hold a meeting today
at which they will decide how to
proceed with stalled contract
talks. A similar meeting one week
ago produced no result.
A news blackout is in effect for
both sides. However, it is known
that the city is offering a $35 per
month increase for clerical
workers and a $48 increase for
other workers, while the union
wants a $65 across-the-board
raise.
SEIU represents all city
employees except firemen, police,
and management.
