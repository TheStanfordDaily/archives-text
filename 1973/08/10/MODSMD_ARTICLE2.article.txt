# 15 Percent Rise Seen
## Tresidder To Boost Prices 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Tresidder Union plans to increase
food prices within two weeks.
Skip Mclntyre, president of Tout
de Suite, Inc. (TDS), which manages
Tresidder's cafeteria and coffee hoUse,
said Wednesday that price increases on
an item-by-item basis will take effect
"reasonably soon."
Mclntyre declined to estimate the
amount of the average price increase.
However, Tresidder Financial Manager
Gordon Starr has been quoted as
predicting a 15 percent price hike at
the Union, which serves an average of
6000 customers per week during the
school year.
Diana Conklin, assistant to the
vacationing Staff, called the 15
percent average increase "very likely,"
and said that prices would probably
rise Aug. 15-25.
Food Prices Jump
Mclntyre emphasized that while
Tresidder's prices have not risen since
July, 1972, wholesale food costs in the
same period of time have climbed
"38-40 percent."

"What we are doing now is studying
all 1500 items on our menu and
analyzing our portions," Mclntyre
said. "That's why we might not have
as large an amount of increase as you
might anticipate."
While costs have gone up, TDS,
according to Mclntyre, has not had
any trouble in procuring meat. The
University's Commissary, on the other
hand, is having such problems.
Low-Cost Dinners
Even after the price rise, Conklin
said, low-cost dinners for $1 or less
will be available. However, such dishes
may contain less meat than before.
Mclntyre sees no end to the
problem of "purchasing costs going
astronomically out of sight."
"It's going to get a hell of a lot
worse before it gets better," he said.
According to Mclntyre, a number
of factors have caused the rise in
wholesale food prices. He cited "sales
of high-protein grains to Russia, bad
weather all over the world, and
unfortunate government
intervention," as factors.

The TDS president criticized
government controls, which "throw
the whole system of supply and
demand out of whack."
In the case of beef prices, which are
frozen until September, the controls
do not even work because of two
factors, he said.
First, "beef packers are taking live
carcasses up to Canada so they can be
brought back and sold as imports"
without price restrictions.
Second, some suppliers are "kiting"
— shortweighting restaurants by
delivering less than the full contract.

and said that prices would probably
rise Aug. 15-25.
Food Prices Jump
Mclntyre emphasized that while
Tresidder's prices have not risen since
July, 1972, wholesale food costs in the
same period of time have climbed
"38-40 percent."

"What we are doing now is studying
all 1500 items on our menu and
analyzing our portions," Mclntyre
said. "That's why we might not have
as large an amount of increase as you
might anticipate."
While costs have gone up, TDS,
according to Mclntyre, has not had
any trouble in procuring meat. The
University's Commissary, on the other
hand, is having such problems.
Low-Cost Dinners
Even after the price rise, Conklin
said, low-cost dinners for $1 or less
will be available. However, such dishes
may contain less meat than before.
Mclntyre sees no end to the
problem of "purchasing costs going
astronomically out of sight."
"It's going to get a hell of a lot
worse before it gets better," he said.
According to Mclntyre, a number
of factors have caused the rise in
wholesale food prices. He cited "sales
of high-protein grains to Russia, bad
weather all over the world, and
unfortunate government
intervention," as factors.

The TDS president criticized
government controls, which "throw
the whole system of supply and
demand out of whack."
In the case of beef prices, which are
frozen until September, the controls
do not even work because of two
factors, he said.
First, "beef packers are taking live
carcasses up to Canada so they can be
brought back and sold as imports"
without price restrictions.
Second, some suppliers are "kiting"
— shortweighting restaurants by
delivering less than the full contract.
Tresidder Union plans to increase
food prices within two weeks.
Skip Mclntyre, president of Tout
de Suite, Inc. (TDS), which manages
Tresidder's cafeteria and coffee hoUse,
said Wednesday that price increases on
an item-by-item basis will take effect
"reasonably soon."
Mclntyre declined to estimate the
amount of the average price increase.
However, Tresidder Financial Manager
Gordon Starr has been quoted as
predicting a 15 percent price hike at
the Union, which serves an average of
6000 customers per week during the
school year.
Diana Conklin, assistant to the
vacationing Staff, called the 15
percent average increase "very likely,"
and said that prices would probably
rise Aug. 15-25.
