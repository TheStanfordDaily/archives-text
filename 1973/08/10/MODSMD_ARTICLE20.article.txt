# Scientists Debate Vitamin C-Cold Link
## 
### 
Nobel laureates Linus Pauling
and Albert Szent-Gyorgyi shared
center stage at a symposium on
"Vitamin C and the Common
Cold" sponsored by the Industrial
Affiliates of the Chemistry and
Chemical Engineering
Departments this week.
Szent-Gyorgyi, 80, discovered
Vitamin C, or ascorbic acid, over
40 years ago. Although he said he
has had little to do with research
on the stuff for the past 30 years,
he regularly ingests two grams a
day — plus plenty of wheat germ
— and says he is no longer
troubled with colds.
Pauling, 72, is the author of
the best-seller for which the
symposium was named. He takes
at least six grams a day — around
100 times the FDA-recommended
dosage — and claims never to get
colds.
"If the body doesn't get
enough ascorbic acid, you don't
just get a cold," said
Szent-Gyorgyi, who heads the
Institute for Muscle Research at
Woods Hole, Mass. "Everything —
just everything — goes to pieces,
and the final stage is scurvy."

He criticized the reluctance of
government health agencies to
support more research on the
substance and the medical
profession's reluctance to espouse
it. "Dr. Pauling estimated colds
cost us $15 billion a year, and the
combined ignorance of politicians
and physicians keeps us from
spending even $1 million a year to
prevent them."
However where neither
subjects nor testers know who is
receiving a real dose — Pauling
himself toted up 11
"double-blind" studies made so
far (including four reported at the
symposium), every one of which
gives positive support to his
theory that Vitamin C in large
doses is a good cold preventive.
His contention that Vitamin C is
entirely nontoxic met with
considerable opposition from
other participants, however.
Dr. Thomas C. Chalmers,
director of the National Institutes
of Health Clinical Center, pointed
out that even water can be toxic if
taken in excessive amounts.
Chalmers also presented one of
the experimental reports which
showed a small protective effect
against colds as a result of taking
Vitamin C during a nine-month
study of 190 subjects. He termed
it "insignificant," however.
Szent-Gyorgyi cited a case of a
man who took 100 grams of
Vitamin C per day without ill
effects, while Pauling said the
highest dose on record was 125
grams administered to a critically
ill pneumonia patient who
eventually recovered.
Other participants cited

individual cases, on the other
hand, in which persons who had
been on large, long-term Vitamin
C dosage had become "scorbutic"
(deficient in ascorbic acid) fairly
soon after they stopped taking it.

The advice of all participants
seemed to be that anyone taking
large doses for a long time should
not suddenly stop taking it,
particularly if they were exposed
to disease.

Communications Commission (FCC) for its stringent control over the
television industry. Speaking in Redwood Hall, Whitehead advocated
greater community control of television stations and the removal of
much of the FCC's powers.

man who took 100 grams of
Vitamin C per day without ill
effects, while Pauling said the
highest dose on record was 125
grams administered to a critically
ill pneumonia patient who
eventually recovered.
Other participants cited

individual cases, on the other
hand, in which persons who had
been on large, long-term Vitamin
C dosage had become "scorbutic"
(deficient in ascorbic acid) fairly
soon after they stopped taking it.

The advice of all participants
seemed to be that anyone taking
large doses for a long time should
not suddenly stop taking it,
particularly if they were exposed
to disease.

MEDIA MAN — Clay Whitehead, director of the Federal Office of
Telecommunication Policy, last night criticized the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) for its stringent control over the
television industry. Speaking in Redwood Hall, Whitehead advocated
greater community control of television stations and the removal of
much of the FCC's powers.
Nobel laureates Linus Pauling
and Albert Szent-Gyorgyi shared
center stage at a symposium on
"Vitamin C and the Common
Cold" sponsored by the Industrial
Affiliates of the Chemistry and
Chemical Engineering
Departments this week.
Szent-Gyorgyi, 80, discovered
Vitamin C, or ascorbic acid, over
40 years ago. Although he said he
has had little to do with research
on the stuff for the past 30 years,
he regularly ingests two grams a
day — plus plenty of wheat germ
— and says he is no longer
troubled with colds.
Pauling, 72, is the author of
the best-seller for which the
symposium was named. He takes
at least six grams a day — around
100 times the FDA-recommended
dosage — and claims never to get
colds.
"If the body doesn't get
enough ascorbic acid, you don't
just get a cold," said
Szent-Gyorgyi, who heads the
Institute for Muscle Research at
Woods Hole, Mass. "Everything —
just everything — goes to pieces,
and the final stage is scurvy."

He criticized the reluctance of
government health agencies to
support more research on the
substance and the medical
profession's reluctance to espouse
it. "Dr. Pauling estimated colds
cost us $15 billion a year, and the
combined ignorance of politicians
and physicians keeps us from
spending even $1 million a year to
prevent them."
However where neither
subjects nor testers know who is
receiving a real dose — Pauling
himself toted up 11
"double-blind" studies made so
far (including four reported at the
symposium), every one of which
gives positive support to his
theory that Vitamin C in large
doses is a good cold preventive.
His contention that Vitamin C is
entirely nontoxic met with
considerable opposition from
other participants, however.
Dr. Thomas C. Chalmers,
director of the National Institutes
of Health Clinical Center, pointed
out that even water can be toxic if
taken in excessive amounts.
Chalmers also presented one of
the experimental reports which
showed a small protective effect
against colds as a result of taking
Vitamin C during a nine-month
study of 190 subjects. He termed
it "insignificant," however.
Szent-Gyorgyi cited a case of a
man who took 100 grams of
Vitamin C per day without ill
effects, while Pauling said the
highest dose on record was 125

ill pneumonia patient who
eventually recovered.
