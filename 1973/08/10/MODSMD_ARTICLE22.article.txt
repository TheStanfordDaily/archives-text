# On-Campus Pub Planning Begins
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Plans are now being made to
convert the Encina Snack Bar into
"Little Leland's Pub," a
restaurant open until late at night.
ASSU Vice-President Jim
Friend, who is working on
designing the proposed on-campus
facility, said he is planning a decor
which will be "a satire on the
history of Stanford."
According to Friend, the pub's
menu will include "hamburgers,
hot dogs, hot sandwiches,
submarines, ice cream, and
perhaps some kind of pizza."
At least initially, no alcoholic
beverages would be sold.
However, Friend hopes to
eventually procure at least a beer
license from the Alcoholic
Beverages Commission.
Only one college in the state,
San Francisco State University,
currently serves beer on campus.
In order for Little Leland's to
become a reality, both the
University and Tout de Suite,
Inc., the company that would
manage the pub, must agree that
the project "is financially and

socially desirable," Friend said.
TDS would hire "99 percent
students" to run Little Leland's,
with perhaps one fulltime
manager, Friend says. This is the
way the Tresidder Coffee House,
also managed by TDS, is run.
Friend said he did not know
exactly how the remodeling
would be paid for, but predicted
that either the University or TDS
would take out a loan which
would be paid back out of the
profits of the venture.
Friend declined to say when he
thought the restaurant could be
opened, saying only that he hopes
construction will begin by fall
quarter. He is currently searching
for an architect, designer, and
contractor for the project.
TDS President Skip Mclntyre
said that his organization is
currently acting in "an advisory
role" to the ASSU. He added that
feasibility studies are now being
made, but expressed optimism
that the project will prove a viable
one even without serving alcoholic
beverages.
