# Opens And Closes In One Night
## David Frye Leaves Fairmont 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
SAN FRANClSCO—lmpressionist
David Frye set a new Venetian
Room record Aug. 2 when his
two-week engagement at the
Fairmont Hotel was terminated
after one night. The old record
was three nights, held by Jerry
Lewis and Dean Martin.
It was sad to see such a
brilliant comedian stumble so
badly. His routine was sprinkled
with funny moments, but overall
it was a sloppy performance that
left the audience embarrassed for
Frye.
Frye was obviously drunk. He
kept repeating lines as many as
eight times, driving them into the
ground and forcing the audience
into an embarrassed silence. He
attempted to do an imitation of
Sen. Sam Ervin (D—N.C.) that did
not come off well. He waggled his
eyebrows and said, "I'm just a
poor old country lawyer from
Noth Cahlina." He interspersed
his many renditions of this one
line with monologues emphasizing
the difficulty of doing
impressions.
Notebooks
Towards the end of the show,
Frye did about 20 minutes of his
famous Richard Nixon
impression. He had to read from a
notebook because he could not
remember the lines. As if that was
not bad enough, he repeatedly
broke away from his material and
launched into profuse apologies.
He kept asking the audience to
come back in a few nights,
claiming that he would know his
material then and could give a
better show.
Frye tried to save himself by
playing off a few people in the
audience. He introduced
columnist Herb Caen and for the
rest of the show made references
to Caen when he was not getting
laughs. For instance, when he was
reading from a notebook Frye
stopped and said, "Herb isn't
smiling. Herb doesn't like me
reading my material. C'mon Herb,
smile. It's all right."
It wasn't all right, and Frye got
worse as the show went on. To be
fair, however, there were some
good reasons for his debacle. He
was informed before showtime
that a very close friend of his had
been killed by a car in New York
earlier that day. That shock,
coupled with the fact that Frye
had not worked a club date in

over three months, accounted in
great part for his poor showing.
Shouldn't Go On
Frye is a professional, though,
and should not have gone on stage
in his condition. The 9:30 p.m.
show went poorly and Frye was
asked if he wanted to go on for
the midnight performance. He
did, and things got worse and
worse. The management of the
Fairmont fired him Friday
morning and singer Jaye P.
Morgan opened that evening.
Frye is, however, one of the
best comedian-impressionists
around and the quality of his
material showed through in spots.
He did an excellent imitation
of New York. Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller, intoning, "Last year I
promised that I would get the
Long Island Railroad back on its
feet. Now 90 percent of its trains
are running on time. Of course,
they are running into the other 10
percent."
Some New Lines
Frye has been working on
some new lines as evidenced by
his version of Nixon's position on

the Watergate tapes. "I have
decided to give up all of my
personal tapes to the Ervin
committee. I just hope that they
like Mantovani."
Some other bits of Frye-Nixon
humor:
"I will not give up until I
become Governor of California.
"I have been wrestling with my
conscience. Six times I have
handed in my resignation, and six
times I have rejected it.
"I would never divert from the
Watergate affair. That would be
the cowardly thing to do. Today
Pat and I adopted two Vietnamese
children, one from the North and
one from the South. We are going
to mate them. Only in America."
It is sad to see a great talent
like David Frye have such a hard
time. His albums and previous
club dates testify to his
excellence. After seeing his
Venetian Room performance, one
wished he could see the David
Frye who would have provided a
funny and enjoyable evening
under normal circumstances.

in his condition. The 9:30 p.m.
show went poorly and Frye was
asked if he wanted to go on for
the midnight performance. He
did, and things got worse and
worse. The management of the
Fairmont fired him Friday
morning and singer Jaye P.
Morgan opened that evening.
Frye is, however, one of the
best comedian-impressionists
around and the quality of his
material showed through in spots.
He did an excellent imitation
of New York. Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller, intoning, "Last year I
promised that I would get the
Long Island Railroad back on its
feet. Now 90 percent of its trains
are running on time. Of course,
they are running into the other 10
percent."
Some New Lines
Frye has been working on
some new lines as evidenced by
his version of Nixon's position on

the Watergate tapes. "I have
decided to give up all of my
personal tapes to the Ervin
committee. I just hope that they
like Mantovani."
Some other bits of Frye-Nixon
humor:
"I will not give up until I
become Governor of California.
"I have been wrestling with my
conscience. Six times I have
handed in my resignation, and six
times I have rejected it.
"I would never divert from the
Watergate affair. That would be
the cowardly thing to do. Today
Pat and I adopted two Vietnamese
children, one from the North and
one from the South. We are going
to mate them. Only in America."
It is sad to see a great talent
like David Frye have such a hard
time. His albums and previous
club dates testify to his
excellence. After seeing his
Venetian Room performance, one
wished he could see the David
Frye who would have provided a
funny and enjoyable evening
under normal circumstances.
SAN FRANClSCO—lmpressionist
David Frye set a new Venetian
Room record Aug. 2 when his
two-week engagement at the
Fairmont Hotel was terminated
after one night. The old record
was three nights, held by Jerry
Lewis and Dean Martin.
It was sad to see such a
brilliant comedian stumble so
badly. His routine was sprinkled
with funny moments, but overall
it was a sloppy performance that
left the audience embarrassed for
Frye.
Frye was obviously drunk. He
kept repeating lines as many as
eight times, driving them into the
ground and forcing the audience
into an embarrassed silence. He
attempted to do an imitation of
Sen. Sam Ervin (D—N.C.) that did
not come off well. He waggled his
eyebrows and said, "I'm just a
poor old country lawyer from
Noth Cahlina." He interspersed
his many renditions of this one
line with monologues emphasizing
the difficulty of doing
impressions.
Notebooks
Towards the end of the show,
Frye did about 20 minutes of his
famous Richard Nixon
impression. He had to read from a
notebook because he could not
remember the lines. As if that was
not bad enough, he repeatedly
broke away from his material and
launched into profuse apologies.
He kept asking the audience to
come back in a few nights,
claiming that he would know his
material then and could give a
better show.
Frye tried to save himself by
playing off a few people in the
audience. He introduced
columnist Herb Caen and for the
rest of the show made references
to Caen when he was not getting
laughs. For instance, when he was
reading from a notebook Frye
stopped and said, "Herb isn't
smiling. Herb doesn't like me
reading my material. C'mon Herb,
smile. It's all right."
It wasn't all right, and Frye got
worse as the show went on. To be
fair, however, there were some
good reasons for his debacle. He
was informed before showtime
that a very close friend of his had
been killed by a car in New York
earlier that day. That shock,
coupled with the fact that Frye
had not worked a club date in

over three months, accounted in
great part for his poor showing.
Shouldn't Go On
Frye is a professional, though,
and should not have gone on stage
in his condition. The 9:30 p.m.
show went poorly and Frye was

did, and things got worse and
