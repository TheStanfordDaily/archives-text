# Experienced Thespians Stage 'No Exit'; Production Reflects Cohesive Effort
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
No Exit by Jean Paul Sartre is a play many
people have read but few people have seen.
Five Stanford and ex-Stanford students will
stage the rarely-presented work August 16-18
in the Branner dining hall.
Director David M. Richman, a graduate
student in English, was interested in paging
No Exit for technical reasons and as a learning
experience.
"It is a difficult play with difficult roles,"
he explained. Part of the problem is inherent
in the play itself; it contains much talk and
little action.
Richman, who is blind, describes his role as
a director as that of a catalyst, an observer. He
believes he has a good idea of the emotional
affects of the play. "In rehearsal I may suggest
movements which may or may not be
appropriate," he acknowledged, "and that
puts extra responsibility on the actors to
come up with the blocking themselves."
Cast Cooperation
When directing a play with a large cast,
Richman usually works with an assistant. But
No Exit requires only four actors, and during
rehearsals it is apparent that the production
will reflect a cohesive, community effort.

Don Bowman, a Ph.D. candidate in drama
with substantial performing and directing
experience at Stanford, portrays Garcin, one
of three characters who finds himself
entrapped in Sartre's vision of hell—a room
from which there is no exit. There, he
encounters Inez (Susan Lichtman) and Estelle
(Gail Anderson). The valet (Kip Davis) greets
each of them as they enter hell.
Both Lichtman and Anderson are Stanford
alumni. Anderson acted at Stanford, and has
performed professionally in San Francisco.
Lichtman directed The Gloaming and
appeared in other plays while at Stanford but
says she's fighting the urge to act
professionally.
Davis, an English major Swarthmore
College with an interest in acting and directing,
is attending Stanford during the summer.
Richman is a graduate of Harvard.
Right People, Right Time
Richman and Lichtman originally
attempted to assemble a cast for The
Revenger's Tragedy, but were unable to fill
the play's many parts. According to Bowman,
they then decided to do No ETlt because few
people have seen it and because they had the
right people for the roles.

Richman has expanded on the original
stage directions for No Exit. The action takes
place in a drawing room furnished with three
couches. The appearance of each couch
distinctly parallels one of the three principal
characters.
Garcin, the young journalist, is represented
by a sturdy green couch. A shabby brown
couch reflects the drab Inez, and Estelle is
associated with an elegant white sofa.
Although the associations are arbitrary,
Richman hopes the audience will come to
identify each character with his particular
couch or territory of the room.
Independent Production
The group is producing the play
independently, but they have received drama
department aid in building a door flat. The
same system of mobile lights used by the
Company will provide lighting effects.
No Exit opens August 16 at 8:30 p.m.
Additional performances are scheduled for
August 17 and 18 at 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.
Admission to all performances is 50 cents at
the door of Branner dining hall.
"It's my way of getting back at Branner
Hall for the year I spent there as a freshman,"
Lichtman explains with a smile.

NO WAY OUT?—lnez (Susan Lichtman) reacts to an encounter

emotionally-charged scene from "No Exit." The play will be

No Exit by Jean Paul Sartre is a play many
people have read but few people have seen.
Five Stanford and ex-Stanford students will
stage the rarely-presented work August 16-18
in the Branner dining hall.
Director David M. Richman, a graduate
student in English, was interested in paging
No Exit for technical reasons and as a learning
experience.
"It is a difficult play with difficult roles,"
he explained. Part of the problem is inherent
in the play itself; it contains much talk and
little action.
Richman, who is blind, describes his role as
a director as that of a catalyst, an observer. He
believes he has a good idea of the emotional
affects of the play. "In rehearsal I may suggest
movements which may or may not be
appropriate," he acknowledged, "and that
puts extra responsibility on the actors to
come up with the blocking themselves."
Cast Cooperation
When directing a play with a large cast,
Richman usually works with an assistant. But
No Exit requires only four actors, and during
rehearsals it is apparent that the production
will reflect a cohesive, community effort.

Don Bowman, a Ph.D. candidate in drama
with substantial performing and directing
experience at Stanford, portrays Garcin, one
of three characters who finds himself
entrapped in Sartre's vision of hell—a room
from which there is no exit. There, he
encounters Inez (Susan Lichtman) and Estelle
(Gail Anderson). The valet (Kip Davis) greets
each of them as they enter hell.
Both Lichtman and Anderson are Stanford
alumni. Anderson acted at Stanford, and has
performed professionally in San Francisco.
Lichtman directed The Gloaming and
appeared in other plays while at Stanford but
says she's fighting the urge to act
professionally.
Davis, an English major Swarthmore
College with an interest in acting and directing,
is attending Stanford during the summer.
Richman is a graduate of Harvard.
Right People, Right Time
Richman and Lichtman originally
attempted to assemble a cast for The
Revenger's Tragedy, but were unable to fill
the play's many parts. According to Bowman,
they then decided to do No ETlt because few
people have seen it and because they had the
right people for the roles.

Richman has expanded on the original
stage directions for No Exit. The action takes
place in a drawing room furnished with three
couches. The appearance of each couch
distinctly parallels one of the three principal
characters.
Garcin, the young journalist, is represented
by a sturdy green couch. A shabby brown
couch reflects the drab Inez, and Estelle is
associated with an elegant white sofa.
Although the associations are arbitrary,
Richman hopes the audience will come to
identify each character with his particular
couch or territory of the room.
Independent Production
The group is producing the play
independently, but they have received drama
department aid in building a door flat. The
same system of mobile lights used by the
Company will provide lighting effects.
