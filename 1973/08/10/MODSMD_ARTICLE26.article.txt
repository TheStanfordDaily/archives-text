# Memorable Music Fills Oakland Stadium
## 
### DEBBIE SEAMAN 
OAKLAND— Loggins and Messina,
the Leon Russell Group, Mary
McCreary, and the Elvin Bishop
Group provided music at the
Oakland Stadium last Sunday
from 10 a.m. until late in the
afternoon.
And while there was plenty of
activity on stage, there was even
more action in the eager and
responsive crowd. Judging from
the audience reaction during the
"day on the green," most of the
audience was very pleased.
The concert, produced by Bill
Graham, was the first of its kind
held in a major league ballpark in
the Bay Area. The arrangements
were excellent. The stadium,
particularly the field area, was
jammed with people, but the
prevailing atmosphere was
relaxed, happy, and very colorful.
Mary McCreary and band
provided jyake-up, warm-up music
at 10 a.m. There was nothing

particularly distinctive or
outstanding about their music,
but they served their purpose.
Mildly Enthusiastic Encore
Some of their rock numbers
got people on their feet and
clapping and the audience called
them back, if only with mild
enthusiasm, for an encore.
The Elvin Bishop Group,
although performing without
former female lead singer Jo
Baker, was as rousing as ever as
they played a set of blues and
rock.
By the end of the set, their
rendition of "Party 'Til the Cows
Come Home" had everyone on
their feet and dancing with far
more than mild enthusiasm.
Lively, Delicate Music
Loggins and Messina opened
the afternoon with an outstanding
show. Their music was lively, but
far more delicate than that of any
of the other groups. And they
never failed to offer real listening

pleasure.
First, Kenny Loggins entered by
himself. Accompanied only by his
guitar he soloed on "The House at
Pooh Corner" and "Danny's
Song" in an incredibly clear,
mellow voice.
Loggins was soon joined by
Messina and the rest of the group.
The band played "Angry Eyes"
and then a large number of songs
off their "Sittin' In" album.
Entertaining Movement
The members of the group
moved cohesively with each other
and used stage space well. Loggins
and Messina would stand on either
side of the mike, face each other,
and play their guitars back and
forth in harmony. Lester Garth
joined in up front with some
amazing violin playing.
The highlight of their set was a
lengthy version of "Vahevala" a
sailor's song of Jamaica. The
group embarked on several
musical tangents with guitars,

violin, horns, harmonica, and
various kinds of percussion. At
times, they seemed to move in
slow motion, barely touching
their instruments to create
delicate, spaced-out arrangements.
Loggins and Messina wound up
their set in good ol' rock 'n roll
style with "Your Mama Don't
Dance."
Russell Plus Gospel
Later in the afternoon, Leon
Russell was accompanied by the
Rev. Patrick Henderson on piano.
Henderson's gospel singers added
an effective but unsynchronized
chorus and some stiff dance
movements.
Russell himself, dressed in a
red shirt, white pants and cap,
with his long mane of grey hair
and familiar shades, did his show
as if he were conducting a revival
meeting.
Most of the songs were familiar
ones, including "Sweet, Emily,"
"Alcatraz," "Tightrope;" and a
long version of "I'll Take You
There." Addressing the audience
in his half-singing, half-speaking
voice, he said, "Put on a show for
me, and I'll put on a show for
you!"
Contagious Excitement
The audience, ip turn,
responded enthusiastically, and
the crowd of 32,000 clapped their
hands in the air. Ttye people
directly in front of the s,tage were

packed dangerously close
together. Nevertheless they could
not refrain from dancing and
swaying. And the mood was
contagious.
The stage area and environs
began to take on the aspects of an
Elizabethan theater, especially
among the people outside the
show who were sitting on stage.
Like their predecessors, the
Elizabethan dandies, many of
those who had managed to
procure seats on stage were
dressed in all their finery and were
doing their best to attract
attention to themselves. Friends,
groupies, and even a drag queen,
decked out in their Sunday best,
danced with abandon to the
music; others sat on the sidelines
trying to look cool, glancing
occasionally down at the
groundlings in the pit.
In spite of, or maybe because
of, extremely crowded conditions,
the sideliners seemed to be having
a fine time inhaling dust and
marijuana, dancing, and enjoying
the atmosphere.
The outdoorsy, afternoon
atmosphere of the concert also
contributed much to the spirit in
the Oakland Stadium. Without
the bright lights and special stage
effects, the performers were not
endowed with that larger-than-life
quality that tends to separate the
musicians from the audience.
