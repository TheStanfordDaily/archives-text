# Carpenters Offer 'Oldies But Goodies'; New Albums Concentrate On Nostalgia
## 
### 
Carpenters: "Now And Then"
(A&M 5P3519)
Chances are you either like the
Carpenters or you hate
them—there is virtually no
in-between because their sound is
so individual.
However, don't shun this
album even if they are number
one on your enemies list. The
album is so diverse, so appealing
that, at times, you'd swear you
weren't even listening to the
Carpenters. And then again, at
times, you'd know you were.
But it is indeed an album with
something for everybody (even
Mark Spitz's)—good music, voices
that sing on key, fond memories,
and a lot of fun.
The album is based on the
theme of nostalgia. Side one deals
with music "now." The cute

though overplayed "Sing"
launches a barrage of five tunes
including: the old Hank Williams
song "Jambalaya," recently better
performed by John Fogerty
(under the name The Blueridge
Rangers); a moving Leon Russell
song called "The Masquerade,"
and "Heather," an instrumental.
Karen, thank God, has
abandoned that falsetto voice she
adopted on "Goodbye To Love,"
returning to that natural tone
which suits her better.
This side tends to drag a bit,
particularly with the final song, "I
Can't Make Music," the title of
which speaks for itself. However,
side two immediately picks up the
pace and is well worth the price of
the album.
Side two reflects upon the
"oldies but goodies," the "then"

in the title. Beginning with the
latest hit single, "Yesterday Once
More," which we like, it fades
back into the golden era of the
sixties for a medley of hits
including: "Fun, Fun, Fun," the
old Beach Boys tune; "The End
Of The World," "Johnny Angel,"
"Our Day Will Come," and "One
Fine Day."
Richard even gets solo vocals in
"Dead Man's Curve" and"The
Night Has A Thousand Eyes,"
"one of Bobby Vee's biggest
hits," according to Tony Peluso,
lead guitarist, who makes the
album by perfectly imitating a
typical top-40 disc jockey
annoucing in-between each "blast
from the past."
In the past, the Carpenters
have produced a predominance of
somber songs. But this album
reveals their sense of humor while
stressing a major point that the
old songs are still the best and
most memorable.

Dick Clark: "Presenting 20 Years
of Rock 'N' Roll"
(Buddah 8D55133-2)
Besides functioning as one
giant commercial for Dick Clark
Enterprises, Inc. (including shows
like the 20 year-old "American
Bandstand," and "In Concert"
and even his probable interests in
pimple cream), the album
contains a lot of good music.
True, you have to tolerate the
photos of Dick Clark which
plaster the cover and you even
have to wade thourgh his
yearbook with "exclusive" photos
from "my scrapbook."
And then there's his cardboard
33-1/3 rpm record containing
"exclusive inside stories," which
also has a picture of Dick on it
and requires the user to punch out
the center with a pencil.
However, once these obstacles
are overcome, the two record set
contains 30 boss, nifty, ginchy,
neato (any others?) classics
covering the period 1953-73.
The fiedlity is not always the
greatest but the songs, many of
which are rare (cannot be found
anywhere at any price and all of
that), rate as all time hits and
should be a part of any collection
that the owner dares to label
"complete."

Led Zeppelin: "Houses of the
Holy"
(Atlantic SD 7255)
Despite the title—"Houses of
the Holy"—there is absolutely
nothing sacred about Led
Zeppelin's latest album. It
contains some fine music, but
unfortunately also contains some
of the most uncoordinated wailing
recorded in recent memory.
Jimmy Page's lead guitar work
is consistently fine throughout the
album, while John Paul Jones
adds depth and background on
bass, organ, piano, and
synthesizer. Robert Plant gets a
chance to show amazing vocal
versatility, but all too often his
wailing fails to correspond with
what Jones and Page are doing.
If "D'yer Maker" and"The
Crunge" were left off the album
entirely, "Houses of the Holy"
would be a much more listenable
LP.
"The Crunge" is nothing more
than a stream-of-consciousness
conglomeration of words,
apparently in reference to a certain
woman, coupled with messy
instrumental backup that really
does cause the listener to
"crunge."
No single cut on the album
stands out with the mellow
harmony of "Stairway to Heaven"
or the driving force of "Whole
Lotta Love." But in a fashion that
is neither outstanding nor dull,
Led Zeppelin has combined both
of these styles in a creditable
album.
But the Zeppelin really gets off
the ground in the fast-paced
rhythm of "Dancing Days" and
the forceful bass line of "The
Song Remains the Same." Page,
Jones, and drummer John
Bonham provide some fine vocal
backing in "The Ocean" and
should assist Plant more often.
"Over the Hills and Far Away"
remains the finest cut on this
album.
Although one or two AM disc
jockeys have discovered this fine
cut, hopefully it won't be
slaughtered by over-repetition on
top-40 music stations and thus
suffer the same fate as much of
Led Zeppelin's most memorable
music.

(Buddah 8D55133-2)
Besides functioning as one
giant commercial for Dick Clark
Enterprises, Inc. (including shows
like the 20 year-old "American
Bandstand," and "In Concert"
and even his probable interests in
pimple cream), the album
contains a lot of good music.
True, you have to tolerate the
photos of Dick Clark which
plaster the cover and you even
have to wade thourgh his
yearbook with "exclusive" photos
from "my scrapbook."
And then there's his cardboard
33-1/3 rpm record containing
"exclusive inside stories," which
also has a picture of Dick on it
and requires the user to punch out
the center with a pencil.
However, once these obstacles
are overcome, the two record set
contains 30 boss, nifty, ginchy,
neato (any others?) classics
covering the period 1953-73.
The fiedlity is not always the
greatest but the songs, many of
which are rare (cannot be found
anywhere at any price and all of
that), rate as all time hits and
should be a part of any collection
that the owner dares to label
"complete."

Led Zeppelin: "Houses of the
Holy"
(Atlantic SD 7255)
Despite the title—"Houses of
the Holy"—there is absolutely
nothing sacred about Led
Zeppelin's latest album. It
contains some fine music, but
unfortunately also contains some
of the most uncoordinated wailing
recorded in recent memory.
Jimmy Page's lead guitar work
is consistently fine throughout the
album, while John Paul Jones
adds depth and background on
bass, organ, piano, and
synthesizer. Robert Plant gets a
chance to show amazing vocal
versatility, but all too often his
wailing fails to correspond with
what Jones and Page are doing.
If "D'yer Maker" and"The
Crunge" were left off the album
entirely, "Houses of the Holy"
would be a much more listenable
LP.
"The Crunge" is nothing more
than a stream-of-consciousness
conglomeration of words,
apparently in reference to a certain
woman, coupled with messy
instrumental backup that really
does cause the listener to
"crunge."
No single cut on the album
stands out with the mellow
harmony of "Stairway to Heaven"
or the driving force of "Whole
Lotta Love." But in a fashion that
is neither outstanding nor dull,
Led Zeppelin has combined both
of these styles in a creditable
album.
But the Zeppelin really gets off
the ground in the fast-paced
rhythm of "Dancing Days" and
the forceful bass line of "The
Song Remains the Same." Page,
Jones, and drummer John
Bonham provide some fine vocal
backing in "The Ocean" and
should assist Plant more often.
"Over the Hills and Far Away"
remains the finest cut on this
album.
Although one or two AM disc
jockeys have discovered this fine
cut, hopefully it won't be
slaughtered by over-repetition on
top-40 music stations and thus
suffer the same fate as much of
Led Zeppelin's most memorable
music.

Carpenters: "Now And Then"
(A&M 5P3519)
Chances are you either like the
Carpenters or you hate
them—there is virtually no
in-between because their sound is
so individual.
However, don't shun this
album even if they are number
one on your enemies list. The
album is so diverse, so appealing
that, at times, you'd swear you
weren't even listening to the
Carpenters. And then again, at
times, you'd know you were.
But it is indeed an album with
something for everybody (even
Mark Spitz's)—good music, voices
that sing on key, fond memories,
and a lot of fun.
The album is based on the
theme of nostalgia. Side one deals
with music "now." The cute

though overplayed "Sing"
launches a barrage of five tunes
including: the old Hank Williams
song "Jambalaya," recently better
performed by John Fogerty
(under the name The Blueridge
Rangers); a moving Leon Russell
song called "The Masquerade,"
and "Heather," an instrumental.
Karen, thank God, has
abandoned that falsetto voice she
adopted on "Goodbye To Love,"
returning to that natural tone
which suits her better.
This side tends to drag a bit,
particularly with the final song, "I
Can't Make Music," the title of
which speaks for itself. However,
side two immediately picks up the
pace and is well worth the price of
the album.
Side two reflects upon the
"oldies but goodies," the "then"

in the title. Beginning with the
latest hit single, "Yesterday Once
More," which we like, it fades
back into the golden era of the
sixties for a medley of hits
including: "Fun, Fun, Fun," the
old Beach Boys tune; "The End
Of The World," "Johnny Angel,"
"Our Day Will Come," and "One
Fine Day."
Richard even gets solo vocals in
"Dead Man's Curve" and"The
Night Has A Thousand Eyes,"
"one of Bobby Vee's biggest
hits," according to Tony Peluso,
lead guitarist, who makes the
album by perfectly imitating a
typical top-40 disc jockey
annoucing in-between each "blast
from the past."
In the past, the Carpenters
have produced a predominance of
somber songs. But this album
reveals their sense of humor while
stressing a major point that the
old songs are still the best and
most memorable.

rhythm of "Dancing Days" and
the forceful bass line of "The
Song Remains the Same." Page,
Jones, and drummer John
Bonham provide some fine vocal
backing in "The Ocean" and
should assist Plant more often.
"Over the Hills and Far Away"
remains the finest cut on this
album.
Although one or two AM disc
jockeys have discovered this fine
cut, hopefully it won't be
slaughtered by over-repetition on
top-40 music stations and thus
suffer the same fate as much of
Led Zeppelin's most memorable
music.

Carpenters: "Now And Then"
(A&M 5P3519)
Chances are you either like the
Carpenters or you hate
them—there is virtually no
in-between because their sound is
so individual.
However, don't shun this
album even if they are number
one on your enemies list. The
album is so diverse, so appealing
that, at times, you'd swear you
weren't even listening to the
Carpenters. And then again, at
times, you'd know you were.
But it is indeed an album with
something for everybody (even
Mark Spitz's)—good music, voices
that sing on key, fond memories,
and a lot of fun.
The album is based on the
theme of nostalgia. Side one deals
with music "now." The cute

though overplayed "Sing"
launches a barrage of five tunes
including: the old Hank Williams
song "Jambalaya," recently better
performed by John Fogerty
(under the name The Blueridge
Rangers); a moving Leon Russell
song called "The Masquerade,"
and "Heather," an instrumental.
Karen, thank God, has
abandoned that falsetto voice she
adopted on "Goodbye To Love,"
returning to that natural tone
which suits her better.
This side tends to drag a bit,
particularly with the final song, "I
Can't Make Music," the title of
which speaks for itself. However,
side two immediately picks up the
pace and is well worth the price of
the album.
Side two reflects upon the
"oldies but goodies," the "then"

in the title. Beginning with the
latest hit single, "Yesterday Once
More," which we like, it fades
back into the golden era of the
sixties for a medley of hits
including: "Fun, Fun, Fun," the
old Beach Boys tune; "The End
Of The World," "Johnny Angel,"
"Our Day Will Come," and "One
Fine Day."
Richard even gets solo vocals in
"Dead Man's Curve" and"The
Night Has A Thousand Eyes,"
"one of Bobby Vee's biggest
hits," according to Tony Peluso,
lead guitarist, who makes the
album by perfectly imitating a
typical top-40 disc jockey
annoucing in-between each "blast
from the past."
In the past, the Carpenters
have produced a predominance of
somber songs. But this album
reveals their sense of humor while
stressing a major point that the
old songs are still the best and
most memorable.

Dick Clark: "Presenting 20 Years
of Rock 'N' Roll"
(Buddah 8D55133-2)
Besides functioning as one
giant commercial for Dick Clark
Enterprises, Inc. (including shows
like the 20 year-old "American
Bandstand," and "In Concert"
and even his probable interests in
pimple cream), the album
contains a lot of good music.
True, you have to tolerate the
photos of Dick Clark which
plaster the cover and you even
have to wade thourgh his
yearbook with "exclusive" photos
from "my scrapbook."
And then there's his cardboard
33-1/3 rpm record containing
"exclusive inside stories," which
also has a picture of Dick on it
and requires the user to punch out
the center with a pencil.
However, once these obstacles
are overcome, the two record set
contains 30 boss, nifty, ginchy,
neato (any others?) classics
covering the period 1953-73.
The fiedlity is not always the
greatest but the songs, many of
which are rare (cannot be found
anywhere at any price and all of
that), rate as all time hits and
should be a part of any collection
that the owner dares to label
"complete."

Led Zeppelin: "Houses of the
Holy"
(Atlantic SD 7255)
Despite the title—"Houses of
the Holy"—there is absolutely
nothing sacred about Led
Zeppelin's latest album. It
contains some fine music, but
unfortunately also contains some
of the most uncoordinated wailing
recorded in recent memory.
Jimmy Page's lead guitar work
is consistently fine throughout the
album, while John Paul Jones
adds depth and background on
bass, organ, piano, and
synthesizer. Robert Plant gets a
chance to show amazing vocal
versatility, but all too often his
wailing fails to correspond with
what Jones and Page are doing.
If "D'yer Maker" and"The
Crunge" were left off the album
entirely, "Houses of the Holy"
would be a much more listenable
LP.
"The Crunge" is nothing more
than a stream-of-consciousness
conglomeration of words,
apparently in reference to a certain
woman, coupled with messy
instrumental backup that really
does cause the listener to
"crunge."
No single cut on the album
stands out with the mellow
harmony of "Stairway to Heaven"
or the driving force of "Whole
Lotta Love." But in a fashion that
is neither outstanding nor dull,
Led Zeppelin has combined both
of these styles in a creditable
album.
But the Zeppelin really gets off
the ground in the fast-paced
rhythm of "Dancing Days" and
the forceful bass line of "The
Song Remains the Same." Page,
