THE MACHINERY OF
FREEDOM By David
Friedman. 239 pages. Harper
Colophon Books. $2.25.
These two new books are
introductions to libertarianism.
The political views of the authors
can be described as a radical
variety of Jeffersonian
individualism.
Rothbard's book is a political
manifesto in which he sets forth
the libertarian principles of justice
and then shows how they apply to
particular American political
problems like the draft, welfare,
ecology, and war.
Friedman's book is a series of
short essays proposing reforms
like schooling vouchers and
decentralized city government
that Friedman hopes will lead to a
more efficient, freer society.
Early in his book, Rothbard
defends a natural-rights ethical
basis for the libertarian creed of
non-aggression against anyone's
person and property.
"While the behavior of plants
and at least the lower animals is
determined by their biological
nature or perhaps by their
'instincts,' the nature of man is
such that each individual person
must, in order to act, choose his

own ends and employ his own
means in order to attain them.. . .
To interfere with and cripple this
process by using violence goes
profoundly against what is
necessary by man's nature for his
life and prosperity," Rothbard
writes.
Right of Ownership
Rothbard develops this theory,
in a way similar to John Locke's
Second Treatise, but deriving a
much more radical, absolutist
view of property rights.
Rothbard argues that each
person has an absolute right of
ownership in his own body and
that each person has an absolute
right of ownership in natural
resources that he has transformed
from a state of nature.
Consequently each person has
absolute rights to any transformed
natural resource that he receives
in exchange or as a gift.
In several of the following
chapters, Rothbard, with bold wit
and a display of broad academic
knowledge, gives logical and
historical evidence for an
isolationist foreign policy and
nuclear disarmament, and for an
end to governmental participation
in commercial and industrial
activities.
Rothbard's Arguments
He also argues for the abolition
of public schools and compulsory
attendance laws, for a halt to the
draft, for a changeover from
governmental maintainance of a
pauper class to private workhouse
relief of the poor, and for the
prohibition of poisoning and
damage by pollution.
In addition, he explains how
non-governmental provision of
police, judicial, and defense
services on the open market might
work in practice.
In contrast with Rothbard's
development from basic principles
to concrete problems in American
society, Friedman's book does not
really have a course of
development. Each brief reform
proposal could stand on its own as
a practical suggestion.
Friedman Compromises Beliefs
Friedman apologizes that he
has "said almost nothing about
rights, ethics, good and bad, right
and wrong, although these are
matters central to the ideas of
most libertarians."
Some of Friedman's essays are
gems, such as his attack upon
William Buckley's plan to put

drug users in concentration
camps. But while Friedman's
self-professed basis for his
libertarianism is a natural-rights
ethic he has a tendency to
compromise his beliefs.
Friedman has written
elsewhere that "utilitarianism [is]
the ethic which postulated as its
ultimate end the maximizing of
human welfare. Given that end,
my right to be free is itself only a
prudential question, depending on
such factors as the relationship
between my dislike of slavery and
the pleasure my master derives
from consuming what I produce."
Friedman therefore rejects
utilitarian ethics.
'Politically Possible' Proposals
But in fact, The Machinery of
Freedom is full of proposals made
on utilitarian grounds, and like
utilitarian arguments at all times,
they are framed to be "politically
possible" and are addressed to
those in power (in one case
specifically to Nelson Rockefeller
and Ronald Reagan).
The philosophical swamps of
positivism and utilitarianism are
dangerous ground. Friedman slips
at one point far enough into a
Hobbesian "might is right"
posture to say that in an
anarcho-capitaiist society it will
be possible to outlaw heroin use.
Yet Friedman himself has
contended in the past that a
society is anarchist only if it
follows a principle of no initiation
of coercion.
Friedman's book contains
some flashes of brilliant economic
insight interspersed with some
dubious political propositions. He
accepts too much of the corporate
liberal economists' doctrine of
"public goods" in discussing
national defense.
He believes that there are no
net beneficiaries of the present
social system and finding no
"ruling class," he believes that
persuasion and Fabian reform
tactics can transform society.
These two books are among
the best of the recent
introductions to libertarianism
that have been published. They
belong in the library of anyone
seriously interested in political
thought and current problems.
