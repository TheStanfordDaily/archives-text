# Jazz Artists Delight Bay Area Fans At Annual Concord Summer Festival
## 
### DAN FORTE 
CONCORD—Thanks to the
Concord Summer Festival, Bay
Area jazz fans no longer have to
drive all the way to Monterey
every September, or lose their
shirts at San Francisco clubs like
El Matador to hear good music by
big name jazz artists. This was
once again evidenced at the
second week of the festival.
A special concert on
Wednesday evening, August 1,
featured Chuck Mangione and the
Oakland Symphony.
The only member of
Mangione's travelling group who
was very impressive was
saxophonist Gerry Niewood,
formerly of the Buddy Rich Band.
Singer Esther Satterfield
sounded too much like Dionne
Warwicke. Folk guitarist Don
Potter was out of place in a jazz
format (if you could call it that),
as was Chuck's brother, Gap, on
electric piano.
As for Mangione, one can only
judge him by his compositions
since he only blew his trumpet
once or twice.
Mann Draws A Crowd
The largest crowd of the entire
festival, gathered Friday night to
hear headliner Herbie Mann.
His group, The Family of
Mann, featured David Newman on
flute and tenor sax. Mann who is
without a doubt the number one
flautist in jazz, pleased the crowd
with his Memphis-soul type of
jazz.
The Family of Mann consisted
of piano, drums, electric bass,
congas (by "Potato" Valdez),
flute, and sax. The absence of
guitar allowed Mann and Newman
more space to solo.
On nearly all of the songs
Mann would play extended breaks
without the band, which really
got the audience into high spirits.
Mann was the most exciting act
of the festival. He received the
most enthusiastic ovation, and
returned for an encore to play
Ben Tucker's classic composition
"Comin' Home, Baby."
Preceeding Mann was
vibraphonist Cal Tjader's quintet
with a few friends. The group
included electric piano, bass,
drums, trumpet (by Luis Gasca),
tenor sax, two conga drummers
and timbales. The Escoveda
brothers, Pete and Coke of
Azteca, were on congas and
timbales.
Losing The Vibes
Naturally, Tjader's vibes were
practically lost in the crowd. Most
of the Latin-style set was devoted
to the rhythm section.
The best number was done
minus the horns and plus
percussion; Johnny Mandel's
beautiful ballad "Emily."
Trombone fans were in for a
big treat Saturday night with Kai
Winding's Brass Ensemble, which
features four trombones and two
French horns, backed by bass.

piano, and drums.
The trombone section included
Kai Winding (who is a perennial
top-ranker in all of the jazz polls),
Frank Rosolino, Chauncey Welsh,
and Benny Powell, who ranks
right alongside Winding as one of
the best.
The group's best number was
their first of the set, the late
Charlie Parker's "Buzzy."
Next was one of the best jazz
guitarists alive—Jim Hall.
Guitarist's Disadvantage
A guitarist is always at a
disadvantage at a big outdoor
festival, because there's no way
one guitar can match the volume
and power of a big band or even a
piano, no matter what kind of
amplifier you use.
So, unfortunately, when Jim
Hall came on, backed only by
bassist Jay Leonhardt, much of
the audience decided it was
intermission time.
What the inattentive members
of the crowd missed was one of
the most beautiful sets of the
festival. Starting with "Fly Me To
The Moon" and finishing with
Cole Porter's "I Concentrate On
You," Hall demonstrated his
beautifully soft technique and
impeccable taste throughout the
set.
Before the last number Hall,
who's not one to address the
audience more than is necessary,
said, "I can't play much louder, so
I guess you'll just have to listen
closer."
Pseudo-Hip Jazz
Saturday night came to a close
with Maynard Ferguson's Big
Band from England.
Ferguson's type of music can
best be described by the selections
he played for his finale and
encore; "Mac Arthur Park" and
"Hey Jude." These couldn't really
be termed as "jazz
interpretations," just more
instruments.
His set wasn't too bad except
for the over-dramatic, psuedo-hip
staginess of 45-year-old Ferguson
and his young band members.
The only real excitement came
when Ferguson was joined by
Chronicle columnist and
occasional scat-singer, Jon
Hendricks, formerly of Lambert,
Hendricks, and Ross.
Hendricks scooble-dee-oobed
his way through a nice
blues-jazz-gospel tune entitled
"Got The Spirit." This also
featured tenor saxophonist
Ferdinand Povel on a nice
extended solo, which was
practically a musical
impersonation of he late Lester
Young. Ferguson only
occasionally played his trumpet
during the set.
Mary Osborne's quartet opened
Sunday night's festivities.
Osborne holds the distinction of
being the only female jazz
guitarist to reach any degree of
success. She has played or

recorded with such names as Mary
Lou Williams, Joe Venuti, and
Coleman Hawkins. She also sings.
Osborne's best number
was an almost note-for-note
tribute to the late Charlie
Christian on his famous "Solo
Flight."
Milt Jackson, of the legendary
Modern Jazz Quartet, is without a
doubt the best vibraphonist in the
world. Bassist Ray Brown has won
the Playboy All-Star Poll every
year since it began in 1958, and
has also won the Down Beat
Reader's Poll more than a dozen
times.
Jackson Meets Brown
Any meeting of these two
talents is bound to be a study in
swinging perfection. Sunday night
was no exception.
Along with tenor saxophonist
Teddy Edwards, pianist Monte
Alexander, and drummer Duffy
Jackson, Jackson and Brown
easily stole the closing show of
Concord's sth Summer Festival.
Each member was featured
individually, and all were
outstanding; Edwards on "Georgia
On My Mind," Duffy Jackson on
"Sweet Georgia Brown,"
Alexander on a romping "Battle
Hymn of the Republic," Milt on
"A Time For Love," and Brown
on "Tenderly." Together they
closed with the late Lee Morgan's
"Speed Ball."
Sixty-year-old clarinetist
Woody Herman brought the
Concord Festival to an end.
Herman has said "I felt a

wedding was in the offing
between jazz and rock, and that's
what we're trying to do." The
result was boredom, which is
unfortunate because Herman is
still one of the best jazz musicians
around.
Jazz-Rock Wedding
If a jazz-rock fusion was to
take place, it would have a better
chance for success in a smaller
combo, rather than with the 16
pieces Herman used.
Herman made the same
mistakes Ferguson made the night
before. One was not playing his
instrument. It's not enough to just
look at a great musician, it's nice
to hear him play as well.
The other mistake was hiring a
band made up entirely of young,
long-haired members, presumably
to try to make more
commercially.
I don't see why older jazzmen
think it necessary to change and
"keep up with the times." The
two greatest jazz bands ever, Duke
Ellington and Count Basie,
haven't had to resort to hiring all
young J 'musicians, wearing mod
outfits, yet; why should Herman
or Ferguson?
Next year's Concord Summer
Festival will be held at the
newly-planned Concord Center
For The Performing Arts, once
again under the stars.
Conctird is by far the best
festival I've ever come in contact
with. Ft's a shame it can't
every weekend, instead
of only every August.

take place, it would have a better
chance for success in a smaller
combo, rather than with the 16
pieces Herman used.
Herman made the same
mistakes Ferguson made the night
before. One was not playing his
instrument. It's not enough to just
look at a great musician, it's nice
to hear him play as well.
The other mistake was hiring a
band made up entirely of young,
long-haired members, presumably
to try to make more
commercially.
I don't see why older jazzmen
think it necessary to change and
"keep up with the times." The
two greatest jazz bands ever, Duke
Ellington and Count Basie,
haven't had to resort to hiring all
young J 'musicians, wearing mod
outfits, yet; why should Herman
or Ferguson?
Next year's Concord Summer
Festival will be held at the
newly-planned Concord Center
For The Performing Arts, once
again under the stars.
Conctird is by far the best
festival I've ever come in contact
with. Ft's a shame it can't
every weekend, instead
of only every August.

CONCORD CLOSlNG—Clarinetist Woody Herman brought the highly successful Concord Summer
Festival to a close last Sunday night. In itself, Herman s performance was not so successful, as the
sixty-year-old jazz artist attempted to merge jazz and rock. But his disappointing performance could not
seriously mar the overall excellence of the Festival.
CONCORD—Thanks to the
Concord Summer Festival, Bay
Area jazz fans no longer have to
drive all the way to Monterey
every September, or lose their
shirts at San Francisco clubs like
El Matador to hear good music by
big name jazz artists. This was
once again evidenced at the
second week of the festival.
A special concert on
Wednesday evening, August 1,
featured Chuck Mangione and the
Oakland Symphony.
The only member of
Mangione's travelling group who
was very impressive was
saxophonist Gerry Niewood,
formerly of the Buddy Rich Band.
Singer Esther Satterfield
sounded too much like Dionne
Warwicke. Folk guitarist Don
Potter was out of place in a jazz
format (if you could call it that),
as was Chuck's brother, Gap, on
electric piano.
As for Mangione, one can only
judge him by his compositions
since he only blew his trumpet
once or twice.
Mann Draws A Crowd
The largest crowd of the entire
festival, gathered Friday night to
hear headliner Herbie Mann.
His group, The Family of
Mann, featured David Newman on
flute and tenor sax. Mann who is
without a doubt the number one
flautist in jazz, pleased the crowd
with his Memphis-soul type of
jazz.
The Family of Mann consisted
of piano, drums, electric bass,
congas (by "Potato" Valdez),
flute, and sax. The absence of
guitar allowed Mann and Newman
more space to solo.
On nearly all of the songs
Mann would play extended breaks
without the band, which really
got the audience into high spirits.
Mann was the most exciting act
of the festival. He received the
most enthusiastic ovation, and
returned for an encore to play
Ben Tucker's classic composition
"Comin' Home, Baby."
Preceeding Mann was
vibraphonist Cal Tjader's quintet
with a few friends. The group
included electric piano, bass,
drums, trumpet (by Luis Gasca),
tenor sax, two conga drummers
and timbales. The Escoveda
brothers, Pete and Coke of
Azteca, were on congas and
timbales.
Losing The Vibes
Naturally, Tjader's vibes were
practically lost in the crowd. Most
of the Latin-style set was devoted
to the rhythm section.
The best number was done
minus the horns and plus
percussion; Johnny Mandel's
beautiful ballad "Emily."
Trombone fans were in for a
big treat Saturday night with Kai
Winding's Brass Ensemble, which
features four trombones and two
French horns, backed by bass.

piano, and drums.
The trombone section included
Kai Winding (who is a perennial
top-ranker in all of the jazz polls),
Frank Rosolino, Chauncey Welsh,
and Benny Powell, who ranks
right alongside Winding as one of
the best.
The group's best number was
their first of the set, the late
Charlie Parker's "Buzzy."
Next was one of the best jazz
guitarists alive—Jim Hall.
Guitarist's Disadvantage
A guitarist is always at a
disadvantage at a big outdoor
festival, because there's no way
one guitar can match the volume
and power of a big band or even a
piano, no matter what kind of
amplifier you use.
So, unfortunately, when Jim
Hall came on, backed only by
bassist Jay Leonhardt, much of
the audience decided it was
intermission time.
What the inattentive members
of the crowd missed was one of
the most beautiful sets of the
festival. Starting with "Fly Me To
The Moon" and finishing with
Cole Porter's "I Concentrate On
You," Hall demonstrated his
beautifully soft technique and
impeccable taste throughout the
set.
Before the last number Hall,
who's not one to address the
audience more than is necessary,
said, "I can't play much louder, so
I guess you'll just have to listen
closer."
Pseudo-Hip Jazz
Saturday night came to a close
with Maynard Ferguson's Big
Band from England.
Ferguson's type of music can
best be described by the selections
he played for his finale and
encore; "Mac Arthur Park" and
"Hey Jude." These couldn't really
be termed as "jazz
interpretations," just more
instruments.
His set wasn't too bad except
for the over-dramatic, psuedo-hip
staginess of 45-year-old Ferguson
and his young band members.
The only real excitement came
when Ferguson was joined by
Chronicle columnist and
occasional scat-singer, Jon
Hendricks, formerly of Lambert,
Hendricks, and Ross.
Hendricks scooble-dee-oobed
his way through a nice
blues-jazz-gospel tune entitled
"Got The Spirit." This also
featured tenor saxophonist
Ferdinand Povel on a nice
extended solo, which was
practically a musical
impersonation of he late Lester
Young. Ferguson only
occasionally played his trumpet
during the set.
Mary Osborne's quartet opened
Sunday night's festivities.
Osborne holds the distinction of
being the only female jazz
guitarist to reach any degree of
success. She has played or

recorded with such names as Mary
Lou Williams, Joe Venuti, and
Coleman Hawkins. She also sings.
Osborne's best number
was an almost note-for-note
tribute to the late Charlie
Christian on his famous "Solo
Flight."
Milt Jackson, of the legendary
Modern Jazz Quartet, is without a
doubt the best vibraphonist in the
world. Bassist Ray Brown has won
the Playboy All-Star Poll every
year since it began in 1958, and
has also won the Down Beat
Reader's Poll more than a dozen
times.
Jackson Meets Brown
Any meeting of these two
talents is bound to be a study in
swinging perfection. Sunday night
was no exception.
Along with tenor saxophonist
Teddy Edwards, pianist Monte
Alexander, and drummer Duffy
Jackson, Jackson and Brown
easily stole the closing show of
Concord's sth Summer Festival.
Each member was featured
individually, and all were
outstanding; Edwards on "Georgia
On My Mind," Duffy Jackson on
"Sweet Georgia Brown,"
Alexander on a romping "Battle
Hymn of the Republic," Milt on
"A Time For Love," and Brown
on "Tenderly." Together they
closed with the late Lee Morgan's
"Speed Ball."
Sixty-year-old clarinetist
Woody Herman brought the
Concord Festival to an end.
Herman has said "I felt a

wedding was in the offing
between jazz and rock, and that's
what we're trying to do." The
result was boredom, which is
unfortunate because Herman is
still one of the best jazz musicians
around.
Jazz-Rock Wedding
If a jazz-rock fusion was to
take place, it would have a better
chance for success in a smaller
combo, rather than with the 16
pieces Herman used.

Milt Jackson, of the legendary

times.

Any meeting of these two
talents is bound to be a study in
swinging perfection. Sunday night
was no exception.
Along with tenor saxophonist
Teddy Edwards, pianist Monte
Alexander, and drummer Duffy
Jackson, Jackson and Brown
easily stole the closing show of
Concord's sth Summer Festival.
Each member was featured
individually, and all were
outstanding; Edwards on "Georgia
On My Mind," Duffy Jackson on
"Sweet Georgia Brown,"
Alexander on a romping "Battle
Hymn of the Republic," Milt on
"A Time For Love," and Brown
on "Tenderly." Together they
closed with the late Lee Morgan's
"Speed Ball."
Sixty-year-old clarinetist
Woody Herman brought the
Concord Festival to an end.
Herman has said "I felt a

wedding was in the offing
between jazz and rock, and that's
what we're trying to do." The
result was boredom, which is
unfortunate because Herman is
still one of the best jazz musicians
around.
Jazz-Rock Wedding
If a jazz-rock fusion was to
take place, it would have a better
chance for success in a smaller
combo, rather than with the 16
pieces Herman used.
Herman made the same
mistakes Ferguson made the night
before. One was not playing his
instrument. It's not enough to just
look at a great musician, it's nice
to hear him play as well.
The other mistake was hiring a
band made up entirely of young,
long-haired members, presumably
to try to make more
commercially.
I don't see why older jazzmen
think it necessary to change and
"keep up with the times." The
two greatest jazz bands ever, Duke
Ellington and Count Basie,
haven't had to resort to hiring all
young J 'musicians, wearing mod
outfits, yet; why should Herman
or Ferguson?
Next year's Concord Summer
Festival will be held at the
newly-planned Concord Center
For The Performing Arts, once
again under the stars.
Conctird is by far the best
festival I've ever come in contact
with. Ft's a shame it can't
every weekend, instead

CONCORD CLOSlNG—Clarinetist Woody Herman brought the highly successful Concord Summer
Festival to a close last Sunday night. In itself, Herman s performance was not so successful, as the
sixty-year-old jazz artist attempted to merge jazz and rock. But his disappointing performance could not
seriously mar the overall excellence of the Festival.
CONCORD—Thanks to the
Concord Summer Festival, Bay
Area jazz fans no longer have to
drive all the way to Monterey
every September, or lose their
shirts at San Francisco clubs like
El Matador to hear good music by
big name jazz artists. This was
once again evidenced at the
second week of the festival.
A special concert on
Wednesday evening, August 1,
featured Chuck Mangione and the
Oakland Symphony.
The only member of
Mangione's travelling group who
was very impressive was
saxophonist Gerry Niewood,
formerly of the Buddy Rich Band.
Singer Esther Satterfield
sounded too much like Dionne
Warwicke. Folk guitarist Don
Potter was out of place in a jazz
format (if you could call it that),
as was Chuck's brother, Gap, on
electric piano.
As for Mangione, one can only
judge him by his compositions
since he only blew his trumpet
once or twice.
Mann Draws A Crowd
The largest crowd of the entire
festival, gathered Friday night to
hear headliner Herbie Mann.
His group, The Family of
Mann, featured David Newman on
flute and tenor sax. Mann who is
without a doubt the number one
flautist in jazz, pleased the crowd
with his Memphis-soul type of
jazz.
The Family of Mann consisted
of piano, drums, electric bass,
congas (by "Potato" Valdez),
flute, and sax. The absence of
guitar allowed Mann and Newman
more space to solo.
On nearly all of the songs
Mann would play extended breaks
without the band, which really
got the audience into high spirits.
Mann was the most exciting act
of the festival. He received the
most enthusiastic ovation, and
returned for an encore to play
Ben Tucker's classic composition
"Comin' Home, Baby."
Preceeding Mann was
vibraphonist Cal Tjader's quintet
with a few friends. The group
included electric piano, bass,
drums, trumpet (by Luis Gasca),
tenor sax, two conga drummers
and timbales. The Escoveda
brothers, Pete and Coke of
Azteca, were on congas and
timbales.
Losing The Vibes
Naturally, Tjader's vibes were
practically lost in the crowd. Most
of the Latin-style set was devoted
to the rhythm section.
The best number was done
minus the horns and plus
percussion; Johnny Mandel's
beautiful ballad "Emily."
Trombone fans were in for a
big treat Saturday night with Kai
Winding's Brass Ensemble, which
features four trombones and two
French horns, backed by bass.

piano, and drums.
The trombone section included
Kai Winding (who is a perennial
top-ranker in all of the jazz polls),
Frank Rosolino, Chauncey Welsh,
and Benny Powell, who ranks
right alongside Winding as one of
the best.
The group's best number was
their first of the set, the late
Charlie Parker's "Buzzy."
Next was one of the best jazz
guitarists alive—Jim Hall.
Guitarist's Disadvantage
A guitarist is always at a
disadvantage at a big outdoor
festival, because there's no way
one guitar can match the volume
and power of a big band or even a
piano, no matter what kind of
amplifier you use.
So, unfortunately, when Jim
Hall came on, backed only by
bassist Jay Leonhardt, much of
the audience decided it was
intermission time.
What the inattentive members
of the crowd missed was one of
the most beautiful sets of the
festival. Starting with "Fly Me To
The Moon" and finishing with
Cole Porter's "I Concentrate On
You," Hall demonstrated his
beautifully soft technique and
impeccable taste throughout the
set.
Before the last number Hall,
who's not one to address the
audience more than is necessary,
said, "I can't play much louder, so
I guess you'll just have to listen
closer."
Pseudo-Hip Jazz
Saturday night came to a close
with Maynard Ferguson's Big
Band from England.
Ferguson's type of music can
best be described by the selections
he played for his finale and
encore; "Mac Arthur Park" and
"Hey Jude." These couldn't really
be termed as "jazz
interpretations," just more
instruments.
His set wasn't too bad except
for the over-dramatic, psuedo-hip
staginess of 45-year-old Ferguson
and his young band members.
The only real excitement came
when Ferguson was joined by
Chronicle columnist and
occasional scat-singer, Jon
Hendricks, formerly of Lambert,
Hendricks, and Ross.
Hendricks scooble-dee-oobed
his way through a nice
blues-jazz-gospel tune entitled
"Got The Spirit." This also
featured tenor saxophonist
Ferdinand Povel on a nice
extended solo, which was
practically a musical
impersonation of he late Lester
Young. Ferguson only
occasionally played his trumpet
during the set.
Mary Osborne's quartet opened
Sunday night's festivities.
Osborne holds the distinction of
being the only female jazz
guitarist to reach any degree of
success. She has played or

recorded with such names as Mary
Lou Williams, Joe Venuti, and
Coleman Hawkins. She also sings.
Osborne's best number
was an almost note-for-note
tribute to the late Charlie
Christian on his famous "Solo
Flight."
Milt Jackson, of the legendary
Modern Jazz Quartet, is without a
doubt the best vibraphonist in the
world. Bassist Ray Brown has won
the Playboy All-Star Poll every
year since it began in 1958, and
has also won the Down Beat
Reader's Poll more than a dozen
times.

Any meeting of these two

with Maynard Ferguson's Big
Band from England.
Ferguson's type of music can
best be described by the selections
he played for his finale and
encore; "Mac Arthur Park" and
"Hey Jude." These couldn't really
be termed as "jazz
interpretations," just more
instruments.
His set wasn't too bad except
for the over-dramatic, psuedo-hip
staginess of 45-year-old Ferguson
and his young band members.
The only real excitement came
when Ferguson was joined by
Chronicle columnist and
occasional scat-singer, Jon
Hendricks, formerly of Lambert,
Hendricks, and Ross.
Hendricks scooble-dee-oobed
his way through a nice
blues-jazz-gospel tune entitled
"Got The Spirit." This also
featured tenor saxophonist
Ferdinand Povel on a nice
extended solo, which was
practically a musical
impersonation of he late Lester
Young. Ferguson only
occasionally played his trumpet
during the set.
Mary Osborne's quartet opened
Sunday night's festivities.
Osborne holds the distinction of
being the only female jazz
guitarist to reach any degree of
success. She has played or

recorded with such names as Mary
Lou Williams, Joe Venuti, and
Coleman Hawkins. She also sings.
Osborne's best number
was an almost note-for-note
tribute to the late Charlie
Christian on his famous "Solo
Flight."
Milt Jackson, of the legendary
Modern Jazz Quartet, is without a
doubt the best vibraphonist in the
world. Bassist Ray Brown has won
the Playboy All-Star Poll every
year since it began in 1958, and
has also won the Down Beat
Reader's Poll more than a dozen
times.
Jackson Meets Brown
Any meeting of these two
talents is bound to be a study in
swinging perfection. Sunday night
was no exception.
Along with tenor saxophonist
Teddy Edwards, pianist Monte
Alexander, and drummer Duffy
Jackson, Jackson and Brown
easily stole the closing show of
Concord's sth Summer Festival.
Each member was featured
individually, and all were
outstanding; Edwards on "Georgia
On My Mind," Duffy Jackson on
"Sweet Georgia Brown,"
Alexander on a romping "Battle
Hymn of the Republic," Milt on
"A Time For Love," and Brown
on "Tenderly." Together they
closed with the late Lee Morgan's
"Speed Ball."
Sixty-year-old clarinetist
Woody Herman brought the
Concord Festival to an end.
Herman has said "I felt a

wedding was in the offing
between jazz and rock, and that's
what we're trying to do." The
result was boredom, which is
unfortunate because Herman is
still one of the best jazz musicians
around.
Jazz-Rock Wedding
If a jazz-rock fusion was to
take place, it would have a better
chance for success in a smaller
combo, rather than with the 16
pieces Herman used.
Herman made the same
mistakes Ferguson made the night
before. One was not playing his
instrument. It's not enough to just
look at a great musician, it's nice
to hear him play as well.
The other mistake was hiring a
band made up entirely of young,
long-haired members, presumably
to try to make more
commercially.
I don't see why older jazzmen
think it necessary to change and
"keep up with the times." The
two greatest jazz bands ever, Duke
Ellington and Count Basie,
haven't had to resort to hiring all
young J 'musicians, wearing mod
outfits, yet; why should Herman
or Ferguson?
Next year's Concord Summer
Festival will be held at the
newly-planned Concord Center
For The Performing Arts, once
again under the stars.
Conctird is by far the best
festival I've ever come in contact
with. Ft's a shame it can't
every weekend, instead
of only every August.

CONCORD CLOSlNG—Clarinetist Woody Herman brought the highly successful Concord Summer
Festival to a close last Sunday night. In itself, Herman s performance was not so successful, as the
sixty-year-old jazz artist attempted to merge jazz and rock. But his disappointing performance could not
seriously mar the overall excellence of the Festival.
CONCORD—Thanks to the
Concord Summer Festival, Bay
Area jazz fans no longer have to
drive all the way to Monterey
every September, or lose their
shirts at San Francisco clubs like
El Matador to hear good music by
big name jazz artists. This was
once again evidenced at the
second week of the festival.
A special concert on
Wednesday evening, August 1,
featured Chuck Mangione and the
Oakland Symphony.
The only member of
Mangione's travelling group who
was very impressive was
saxophonist Gerry Niewood,
formerly of the Buddy Rich Band.
Singer Esther Satterfield
sounded too much like Dionne
Warwicke. Folk guitarist Don
Potter was out of place in a jazz
format (if you could call it that),
as was Chuck's brother, Gap, on
electric piano.
As for Mangione, one can only
judge him by his compositions
since he only blew his trumpet
once or twice.
Mann Draws A Crowd
The largest crowd of the entire
festival, gathered Friday night to
hear headliner Herbie Mann.
His group, The Family of
Mann, featured David Newman on
flute and tenor sax. Mann who is
without a doubt the number one
flautist in jazz, pleased the crowd
with his Memphis-soul type of
jazz.
The Family of Mann consisted
of piano, drums, electric bass,
congas (by "Potato" Valdez),
flute, and sax. The absence of
guitar allowed Mann and Newman
more space to solo.
On nearly all of the songs
Mann would play extended breaks
without the band, which really
got the audience into high spirits.
Mann was the most exciting act
of the festival. He received the
most enthusiastic ovation, and
returned for an encore to play
Ben Tucker's classic composition
"Comin' Home, Baby."
Preceeding Mann was
vibraphonist Cal Tjader's quintet
with a few friends. The group
included electric piano, bass,
drums, trumpet (by Luis Gasca),
tenor sax, two conga drummers
and timbales. The Escoveda
brothers, Pete and Coke of
Azteca, were on congas and
timbales.
Losing The Vibes
Naturally, Tjader's vibes were
practically lost in the crowd. Most
of the Latin-style set was devoted
to the rhythm section.
The best number was done
minus the horns and plus
percussion; Johnny Mandel's
beautiful ballad "Emily."
Trombone fans were in for a
big treat Saturday night with Kai
Winding's Brass Ensemble, which
features four trombones and two
French horns, backed by bass.

piano, and drums.
The trombone section included
Kai Winding (who is a perennial
top-ranker in all of the jazz polls),
Frank Rosolino, Chauncey Welsh,
and Benny Powell, who ranks
right alongside Winding as one of
the best.
The group's best number was
their first of the set, the late
Charlie Parker's "Buzzy."
Next was one of the best jazz
guitarists alive—Jim Hall.
Guitarist's Disadvantage
A guitarist is always at a
disadvantage at a big outdoor
festival, because there's no way
one guitar can match the volume
and power of a big band or even a
piano, no matter what kind of
amplifier you use.
So, unfortunately, when Jim
Hall came on, backed only by
bassist Jay Leonhardt, much of
the audience decided it was
intermission time.
What the inattentive members
of the crowd missed was one of
the most beautiful sets of the
festival. Starting with "Fly Me To
The Moon" and finishing with
Cole Porter's "I Concentrate On
You," Hall demonstrated his
beautifully soft technique and
impeccable taste throughout the
set.
Before the last number Hall,
who's not one to address the
audience more than is necessary,
said, "I can't play much louder, so
I guess you'll just have to listen
closer."
Pseudo-Hip Jazz
Saturday night came to a close
with Maynard Ferguson's Big
Band from England.
Ferguson's type of music can
best be described by the selections
he played for his finale and
encore; "Mac Arthur Park" and
