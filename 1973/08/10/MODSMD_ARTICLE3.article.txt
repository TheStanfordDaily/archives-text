# Skylab Experiments
## Garriott Studies Sun 
### 
Dr. Owen Garriott, Stanford's
Skylab II scientist, began intense solar
studies this week, using the telescope
he prepared during a spacewalk with
Jack R. Lousma Monday.
Once inside the ship, Garriott
aimed the telescope at "active region
85," a source of recent solar flare
activity. Television cameras send the
images back to earth for further

analysis.
Garriott hopes to find the key to
controlled nuclear fusion. Fusion is
the source of the sun's energy, and
may prove to be the source of the
earth's future energy. The information
will also examine what effect the sun
has on weather and communications
around the world.
The spacewalk allowed Garriott to
load film into a battery of solar
telescope cameras. While doing so, he
noted the strange effect the sun had
on the surface of Skylab. Those areas
exposed to direct rays were acquiring a
"sunburn" tint, while those unexposed
remained white.
Spiders
Meanwhile, Arabella, the unofficial
mascot for the Skylab, continues to
spin contentedly in the no-gravity
environment. Arabella and her
companion Anita are female spiders
who are part of an experiment
proposed by Judith Miles, 17, of
Lexington, Mass. Miles wondered what
type of web a spider would spin in
space.
When Garriott first observed the
spider in her new home, he said she
was "alive and kicking." But Arabella
seemed to have difficulty becoming
adjusted to the zero-gravity situation.

At first the webs were only
rudimentary strands in the corner of
her cage.
By the third day, however, she
managed to turn out a normal circular
web, hoping to capture any passing
insect.
Insects not being freely available,
Arabella was rewarded with a fly.
Garriott remarked, "Simply working
on her own, she has figured out a very
nice solution to the problems of zero
gravity."

Capt. Alan L. Bean and Lousma
prepared for the first of 26 resource
scannings of the earth's surface
Wednesday. The first pass was over
British Columbia, North Dakota and
Cape Hatteras.
This set of experiments is part of
Skylab's Earth Resources Experiment
Package (EREP). These will provide
mineral resource evidence all over the
world. It is hoped new sources of
quickly diminishing elements will be
discovered through the study.

who are part of an experiment
proposed by Judith Miles, 17, of
Lexington, Mass. Miles wondered what
type of web a spider would spin in
space.
When Garriott first observed the
spider in her new home, he said she
was "alive and kicking." But Arabella
seemed to have difficulty becoming
adjusted to the zero-gravity situation.

At first the webs were only
rudimentary strands in the corner of
her cage.
By the third day, however, she
managed to turn out a normal circular
web, hoping to capture any passing
insect.
Insects not being freely available,
Arabella was rewarded with a fly.
Garriott remarked, "Simply working
on her own, she has figured out a very
nice solution to the problems of zero
gravity."

Capt. Alan L. Bean and Lousma
prepared for the first of 26 resource
scannings of the earth's surface
Wednesday. The first pass was over
British Columbia, North Dakota and
Cape Hatteras.
This set of experiments is part of
Skylab's Earth Resources Experiment
Package (EREP). These will provide
mineral resource evidence all over the
world. It is hoped new sources of
quickly diminishing elements will be
discovered through the study.
