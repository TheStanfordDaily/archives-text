# Skylab Experiments
## Garriott Studies Sun 
### 
Dr. Owen Garriott, Stanford's
Skylab II scientist, began intense solar
studies this week, using the telescope
he prepared during a spacewalk with
Jack R. Lousma Monday.
Once inside the ship, Garriott
aimed the telescope at "active region
85," a source of recent solar flare
activity. Television cameras send the
images back to earth for further

analysis.
Garriott hopes to find the key to
controlled nuclear fusion. Fusion is
the source of the sun's energy, and
may prove to be the source of the
earth's future energy. The information
will also examine what effect the sun
has on weather and communications
around the world.
The spacewalk allowed Garriott to
load film into a battery of solar
telescope cameras. While doing so, he
noted the strange effect the sun had
on the surface of Skylab. Those areas
exposed to direct rays were acquiring a
"sunburn" tint, while those unexposed
remained white.
