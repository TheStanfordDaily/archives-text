# Disappointing Premiere
## Ballet Resurrects Winchester Ghosts 
### TERRY ANZUR 
SAN JOSE—In 1884, Sarah
Winchester purchased an
eight-room house near San Jose.
Construction began immediately
and continued day and night for
the next 38 years, financed with
the Winchester Repeating Rifle
fortune Sarah inherited from her
father-in-law, inventor of 'The
Gun That Won The West."
Sarah Winchester died in 1922,
and the five million dollar
Winchester Mystery House
annually attracts thousands of
tourists. The enigma of Sarah's
motivation for building the house
has recently captured the
imagination of Shawn Stuart, a
Bay Area choreographer.
Stuart has created a potentially
good ballet based on the

Winchester Legend, but Sarah was
overshadowed at its unveiling last
Friday night at the San Jose Civic
Auditorium by Leona Norman's
hilarious dance-parody Golden
Moments of the Ballet [Circa
1920].
Stuart, co-director of the San
Jose Dance Theater (formerly
West Valley Ballet),
choreographed Sarah under a
grant from the National
Endowment for the Arts. It was
performed as a work in progress at
the Pacific Regional Ballet
Festival in San Raphael last May.
Drawn-Out Interpretation
The legend of Sarah Winchester
is fascinating in itself. From a
technical standpoint the dancers
of San Jose Dance Theater
performed Stuart's choreography
at least adequately. But for several
reasons, Sarah did not live up to
expectations.
In the prologue, a group of
present-day tourists wanders
through the Winchester house on
the heels of a guide.
The guide delivers a
word-for-word rehash of the
program notes ennumerating the
160 rooms, 10,000 windows, 47
stairways, and other curiosities of
the house ad nauseum. Although
the dancers carried on like truly
obnoxious tourists, throughout
the speech, they must have been
as bored as the audience was at its
conclusion.
Three Explanations
The ballet then returns to a
bygone era, offering three
different explanations for Sarah's
construction of the house.
Victoria Manne interpreted
"Sarah, the Seeker," who has lost
her husband and infant child in a
thunderstorm and seeks mystical
communication with their spirits
by adding on to the house.
Gloria Vauges Mohr, formerly
with Balanchine's New York City
Ballet, interpreted the defiant
Sarah, who planned elaborate
parties for hundreds of local guests
who never attended, and then
constructed the bizarre house in
defiance of social ridicule.
Haunted By Victims
In the most moving
interpretation of the three, Nancie
Berridge (formerly of American
Ballet Theater) represented
"Sarah, the Condemned" haunted
by the ghosts of the Winchester
rifle's victims, and condemned to
appease them by erecting a
monument of penance.
Although the three Sarahs were
danced by the three most
experienced dancers in the San
Jose company, the interpretations

lacked sufficient differentiation
and depth to be believable.
Company members who flitted
across the stage as ghosts added an
eerie quality to the ballet, first
beckoning Sarah as her husband
and child, then partying and
laughing as imaginary guests, and
finally, as the rifle's victims,
accusing her of their deaths.
Refinement Needed
Other unfortunate deficiencies
occured in the scenery and music.
The tiny set nearly got lost on
stage, resembling only a fraction
of the expansive mystery house.
What music there was consisted of
a well-researched combination of
folk ballads, but long stretches of
mime without music quickly
became boring.
Nevertheless, Sarah is a
well thought-out ballet, and with
much refinement and cutting
could emerge as a truly fine work.
As tourist-ghosts crowd around
the three Sarahs near the end of
the ballet, Stuart makes his
strongest statement; the real
tragedy is that the psychological
enigma of Sarah Winchester has
been exploited as a tourist trap.
Sarah's local premiere was part
of a ballet "pops" concert, the
first performance by the San Jose
Dance Theater under its new
name. A $5 ticket entitled the
viewer to sip champagne or punch
at a "promenade table." But the
view from the tables was so poor
that much of the audience moved
into cheaper, but better seats in
the three-fourths empty
auditorium.
Other Ballets
The program featured three
other works by Stuart. Partita was
the kind of ballet one sees and
then promptly forgets. Danzas de
las Pulgas was a typical

pseudo-Spanish work performed
largely without the vitality that
makes the genre palatable.
Becky Meyers, a high school
student, was featured in
Coronation, a modern ballet
about the election of a new queen
in a beehive. Meyers' long,
well-extended arms and legs were
well-suited to the insect-like
movements.
But the evening belonged to
Leona Norman's Golden Moments
of the Ballet [Circa 1920/.
Fortunately this comic ballet was
placed last on the program, as it
effectively ridiculed everything
else in the program up to that
point.
Genuinely Funny Farce
Norman choreographed
Moments for a ballet festival she
was forced to enter without a
large group of experienced
dancers.
Balletomanes who might
remember small town ballet
school recitals or the undiluted
corn of vaudeville "ballet" of past
decades burst out laughing as
chorus-line cuties bounced around
a poet (danced by Stuart) who
finally earns his laurels from a
Roman gladiator.
Even those who know nothing
about ballet would find Moments
genuinely funny. In an especially
memorable moment, little Sandy
Noda, dancing the part of a tiny
moth, lifted the immense "flame"
and passed out from exhaustion.
Moments requires no great
dancing, just a willingness on the
part of the performers to ham it
up for all they're worth. And'
there was no meat shortage at the
San Jose Civic last Friday, even if
the relatively young San Jose
Dance Theater has much room for
technical improvement.

The ballet then returns to a
bygone era, offering three
different explanations for Sarah's
construction of the house.
Victoria Manne interpreted
"Sarah, the Seeker," who has lost
her husband and infant child in a
thunderstorm and seeks mystical
communication with their spirits
by adding on to the house.
Gloria Vauges Mohr, formerly
with Balanchine's New York City
Ballet, interpreted the defiant
Sarah, who planned elaborate
parties for hundreds of local guests
who never attended, and then
constructed the bizarre house in
defiance of social ridicule.
Haunted By Victims
In the most moving
interpretation of the three, Nancie
Berridge (formerly of American
Ballet Theater) represented
"Sarah, the Condemned" haunted
by the ghosts of the Winchester
rifle's victims, and condemned to
appease them by erecting a
monument of penance.
Although the three Sarahs were
danced by the three most
experienced dancers in the San
Jose company, the interpretations

lacked sufficient differentiation
and depth to be believable.
Company members who flitted
across the stage as ghosts added an
eerie quality to the ballet, first
beckoning Sarah as her husband
and child, then partying and
laughing as imaginary guests, and
finally, as the rifle's victims,
accusing her of their deaths.
Refinement Needed
Other unfortunate deficiencies
occured in the scenery and music.
The tiny set nearly got lost on
stage, resembling only a fraction
of the expansive mystery house.
What music there was consisted of
a well-researched combination of
folk ballads, but long stretches of
mime without music quickly
became boring.
Nevertheless, Sarah is a
well thought-out ballet, and with
much refinement and cutting
could emerge as a truly fine work.
As tourist-ghosts crowd around
the three Sarahs near the end of
the ballet, Stuart makes his
strongest statement; the real
tragedy is that the psychological
enigma of Sarah Winchester has
been exploited as a tourist trap.
Sarah's local premiere was part
of a ballet "pops" concert, the
first performance by the San Jose
Dance Theater under its new
name. A $5 ticket entitled the
viewer to sip champagne or punch
at a "promenade table." But the
view from the tables was so poor
that much of the audience moved
into cheaper, but better seats in
the three-fourths empty
auditorium.
Other Ballets
The program featured three
other works by Stuart. Partita was
the kind of ballet one sees and
then promptly forgets. Danzas de
las Pulgas was a typical

pseudo-Spanish work performed
largely without the vitality that
makes the genre palatable.
Becky Meyers, a high school
student, was featured in
Coronation, a modern ballet
about the election of a new queen
in a beehive. Meyers' long,
well-extended arms and legs were
well-suited to the insect-like
movements.
But the evening belonged to
Leona Norman's Golden Moments
of the Ballet [Circa 1920/.
Fortunately this comic ballet was
placed last on the program, as it
effectively ridiculed everything
else in the program up to that
point.
Genuinely Funny Farce
Norman choreographed
Moments for a ballet festival she
was forced to enter without a
large group of experienced
dancers.
Balletomanes who might
remember small town ballet
school recitals or the undiluted
corn of vaudeville "ballet" of past
decades burst out laughing as
chorus-line cuties bounced around
a poet (danced by Stuart) who
finally earns his laurels from a
Roman gladiator.
Even those who know nothing
about ballet would find Moments
genuinely funny. In an especially
memorable moment, little Sandy
Noda, dancing the part of a tiny
moth, lifted the immense "flame"
and passed out from exhaustion.
Moments requires no great
dancing, just a willingness on the
part of the performers to ham it
up for all they're worth. And'
there was no meat shortage at the
San Jose Civic last Friday, even if
the relatively young San Jose
Dance Theater has much room for
technical improvement.
SAN JOSE—In 1884, Sarah
Winchester purchased an
eight-room house near San Jose.
Construction began immediately
and continued day and night for
the next 38 years, financed with
the Winchester Repeating Rifle
fortune Sarah inherited from her
father-in-law, inventor of 'The
Gun That Won The West."
Sarah Winchester died in 1922,
and the five million dollar
Winchester Mystery House
annually attracts thousands of
tourists. The enigma of Sarah's
motivation for building the house
has recently captured the
imagination of Shawn Stuart, a
Bay Area choreographer.
Stuart has created a potentially
good ballet based on the

Winchester Legend, but Sarah was
overshadowed at its unveiling last
Friday night at the San Jose Civic
Auditorium by Leona Norman's
hilarious dance-parody Golden
Moments of the Ballet [Circa
1920].
Stuart, co-director of the San
Jose Dance Theater (formerly
West Valley Ballet),
choreographed Sarah under a
grant from the National
Endowment for the Arts. It was
performed as a work in progress at
the Pacific Regional Ballet
Festival in San Raphael last May.
Drawn-Out Interpretation
The legend of Sarah Winchester
is fascinating in itself. From a
technical standpoint the dancers
of San Jose Dance Theater
performed Stuart's choreography
at least adequately. But for several
reasons, Sarah did not live up to
expectations.
In the prologue, a group of
present-day tourists wanders
through the Winchester house on
the heels of a guide.
The guide delivers a
word-for-word rehash of the
program notes ennumerating the
160 rooms, 10,000 windows, 47
stairways, and other curiosities of
the house ad nauseum. Although
the dancers carried on like truly
obnoxious tourists, throughout
the speech, they must have been
as bored as the audience was at its
conclusion.

first performance by the San Jose
Dance Theater under its new
name. A $5 ticket entitled the
viewer to sip champagne or punch
at a "promenade table." But the
view from the tables was so poor
that much of the audience moved
into cheaper, but better seats in
the three-fourths empty
auditorium.
Other Ballets
The program featured three
other works by Stuart. Partita was
the kind of ballet one sees and
then promptly forgets. Danzas de
las Pulgas was a typical

pseudo-Spanish work performed
largely without the vitality that
makes the genre palatable.
Becky Meyers, a high school
student, was featured in
Coronation, a modern ballet
about the election of a new queen
in a beehive. Meyers' long,
well-extended arms and legs were
well-suited to the insect-like
movements.
But the evening belonged to
Leona Norman's Golden Moments
of the Ballet [Circa 1920/.
Fortunately this comic ballet was
placed last on the program, as it
effectively ridiculed everything
else in the program up to that
point.
Genuinely Funny Farce
Norman choreographed
Moments for a ballet festival she
was forced to enter without a
large group of experienced
dancers.
Balletomanes who might
remember small town ballet
school recitals or the undiluted
corn of vaudeville "ballet" of past
decades burst out laughing as
chorus-line cuties bounced around
a poet (danced by Stuart) who
finally earns his laurels from a
Roman gladiator.
Even those who know nothing
about ballet would find Moments
genuinely funny. In an especially
memorable moment, little Sandy
Noda, dancing the part of a tiny
moth, lifted the immense "flame"
and passed out from exhaustion.
Moments requires no great
dancing, just a willingness on the
part of the performers to ham it
up for all they're worth. And'
there was no meat shortage at the
San Jose Civic last Friday, even if
the relatively young San Jose
Dance Theater has much room for
technical improvement.
SAN JOSE—In 1884, Sarah
Winchester purchased an
eight-room house near San Jose.
Construction began immediately
and continued day and night for
the next 38 years, financed with
the Winchester Repeating Rifle
fortune Sarah inherited from her
father-in-law, inventor of 'The
Gun That Won The West."
Sarah Winchester died in 1922,
and the five million dollar
Winchester Mystery House
annually attracts thousands of
tourists. The enigma of Sarah's
motivation for building the house
has recently captured the
imagination of Shawn Stuart, a
Bay Area choreographer.
Stuart has created a potentially
good ballet based on the

Winchester Legend, but Sarah was
overshadowed at its unveiling last
Friday night at the San Jose Civic
Auditorium by Leona Norman's
hilarious dance-parody Golden
Moments of the Ballet [Circa
1920].
Stuart, co-director of the San
Jose Dance Theater (formerly
West Valley Ballet),
choreographed Sarah under a
grant from the National
Endowment for the Arts. It was
performed as a work in progress at
the Pacific Regional Ballet
Festival in San Raphael last May.
Drawn-Out Interpretation
The legend of Sarah Winchester
is fascinating in itself. From a
technical standpoint the dancers
of San Jose Dance Theater
performed Stuart's choreography
at least adequately. But for several
reasons, Sarah did not live up to
expectations.
In the prologue, a group of
present-day tourists wanders
through the Winchester house on
the heels of a guide.
The guide delivers a
word-for-word rehash of the
program notes ennumerating the
160 rooms, 10,000 windows, 47
stairways, and other curiosities of
the house ad nauseum. Although
the dancers carried on like truly
obnoxious tourists, throughout
the speech, they must have been
as bored as the audience was at its
conclusion.
Three Explanations
The ballet then returns to a
bygone era, offering three
different explanations for Sarah's
construction of the house.
Victoria Manne interpreted
"Sarah, the Seeker," who has lost
her husband and infant child in a
thunderstorm and seeks mystical
communication with their spirits
by adding on to the house.
Gloria Vauges Mohr, formerly
with Balanchine's New York City
Ballet, interpreted the defiant
Sarah, who planned elaborate
parties for hundreds of local guests
who never attended, and then
constructed the bizarre house in
defiance of social ridicule.
Haunted By Victims
In the most moving
interpretation of the three, Nancie
Berridge (formerly of American
Ballet Theater) represented
"Sarah, the Condemned" haunted
by the ghosts of the Winchester
rifle's victims, and condemned to
appease them by erecting a
monument of penance.
Although the three Sarahs were
danced by the three most
experienced dancers in the San
Jose company, the interpretations

lacked sufficient differentiation
and depth to be believable.
Company members who flitted
across the stage as ghosts added an
eerie quality to the ballet, first
beckoning Sarah as her husband
and child, then partying and
laughing as imaginary guests, and
finally, as the rifle's victims,
accusing her of their deaths.
Refinement Needed
Other unfortunate deficiencies
occured in the scenery and music.
The tiny set nearly got lost on
stage, resembling only a fraction
of the expansive mystery house.
What music there was consisted of
a well-researched combination of
folk ballads, but long stretches of
mime without music quickly
became boring.
Nevertheless, Sarah is a
well thought-out ballet, and with
much refinement and cutting
could emerge as a truly fine work.
As tourist-ghosts crowd around
the three Sarahs near the end of
the ballet, Stuart makes his
strongest statement; the real
tragedy is that the psychological
enigma of Sarah Winchester has
been exploited as a tourist trap.
Sarah's local premiere was part
of a ballet "pops" concert, the
first performance by the San Jose
Dance Theater under its new
