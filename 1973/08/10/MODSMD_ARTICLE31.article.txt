Ervin Committee Asks Injunction
WASHINGTON — The Senate Watergate Committee went
to court yesterday in its attempt to force President Nixon
to hand over Watergate-related tapes.
The committee filed a complaint in U.S. District Court,
seeking an injunction ordering Nixon to relinquish the
tapes.
The committee says the tapes are no longer protected
by executive privilege if they ever were since Nixon
allowed former White House chief of staff H.R. Haldeman
to listen to them as a private citizen, after he had left his
official capacity.
Special Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox used the
same argument in his bid for use of the tapes as evidence
in preparation of criminal cases against potential
Watergate defendants.
After the suit was filed, yesterday, three attorneys
representing the committee personally served three
presidential lawyers with the court papers.
At Camp David, Md., President Nixon worked on his
latest remarks about the Watergate incident.
Nixon conferred with his personal speechwriter
Wednesday and met with his confidential secretary
yesterday. The President is expected to remain at Camp
David over the weekend.
Laird Ordered Secret Bombing
WASHINGTON — The Pentagon made public yesterday a
1969 order by then-Defense Secretary Melvin Laird calling
for secret bombing strikes in Cambodia and a cover story
saying that targets were hit in South Vietnam.
However, neither Adm. Thomas Moorer, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, nor Deputy Defense Secretary
William Clement were able to tell the Senate Armed
Services Committee who ordered the false information
presented to the committee in 1971 and again this past
spring.
Moore also told the committee that false reports of the
bombing missions have been made since 1966. According
to Moore, a dual reporting system has been kept ever since
the U.S. first began bombing the Ho Chi Minh trail.
Phnom Penh Siege Continues
PHNOM PENH — Insurgent communist troops continued
their siege of Phnom Penh yesterday.
The New China News Agency reported that rebel
forces have already entered the Cambodian capital. In a
broadcast early this morning, the Chinese said that the
rebel forces have appealed to Phnom Penh residents to
fight against their government.
Cambodian government troops have been
counterattacking along a path bombed open by U.S.
planes on the southwestern fringes of the city. Field
reports say that government troops have moved into areas
captured by the rebels in July and have established
positions at a river bank 12 miles from the city.
Libya-Egypt Merger Planned
CAIRO — Political sources here yesterday said that
Egyptian and Libyan officials have reached a tentative
agreement that lays the groundwork for an eventual

merger of the two countries into one nation.
Negotiators for the two states met yesterday for what
was billed as the final session. According to sources, Libya
had been seeking a complete merger by Sept. 1, but the
Egyptians refused.
Meanwhile, the Egyptian government claims that its
fighter planes yesterday intercepted six Israeli jets that
violated Egyptian airspace.
One Israeli plane was hit, according to the military
communique, but no place or time was accorded to the
incident.
In Tel Aviv, Israeli military command spokesmen said
that all planes patrolling the Gulf of Suez area returned
safely.
Humphrey, Ford Assail Freeze
CHICAGO — In separate press conferences, House
Minority Leader Gerald Ford (R-Mich.) and Sen. Hubert
Humphrey (D-Minn.) yesterday lashed out at the freeze
on beef prices and called for lifting of the restrictions
before the Sept. 12 deadline.
Ford described the beef shortage as "chaotic," while
Humphrey labeled the freeze a "very stupid" political
move.
Up to 20,000 journeymen and apprentice butchers
nationally have been laid off due to the beef shortage,
according to the Amalgamated Meat cutters union.
Mullin Defense Rests
SANTA CRUZ — The defense rested yesterday at the trial
of Herbert Mullin, accused of 10 murders.
Defense attorney James Jackson concluded by calling
Mullin's former fiancee to the stand. Loretta Smith said
Mullin once told her he was a homosexual, and once said
he was going to Canada to get away from earthquakes.
The defense has been trying to show that Mullin killed
because he felt it was the only way earthquakes could be
avoided.
Police Find Dismantled Bomb
LOS ANGELES — Police, following up an anonymous
phone call, found a dismantled pipe bomb and an
extortion note at Los Angeles International Airport
today.
The note said that other active bombs were hidden in a
cosmetic case at the airport, and that people would "get
hurt" unless a $631,000 ransom is paid by Western
Airlines.
However, a nine-hour search of hundreds of lockers,
conducted by dynamite-sniffing dogs, failed to unearth
any other bombs.
The dismantled bomb was found in a small black valise
in a locker after an anonymous phone call came to
Western Airlines.
Police say they have no suspects.
