# Judge Delays Burts' Sentencing, Agrees To Hear New Trial Move
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
San Bernardino Superior Court
Judge Thomas Haldorsen said
Wednesday that he would rule on
defense attorney Charles Garry's
request for a new trial when convicted
Chino defendants Andrea Holman
Burt and Benton Douglas Burt appear
for sentencing Aug. 16.
On July 18 a jury found the Burts
guilty of second degree murder, assault
with a deadly weapon, lynching
(rescuing a prisoner), and being armed
at the scene of an ambush escape last
Oct. 6 that freed convict Ronald
Wayne Beaty from the California
Institution for Men at Chino and left
prison guard Jesus Sanchez dead.
Garry requested a new trial in a
brief filed Wednesday, protesting
certain legal rulings by the judge and
charging both Deputy District
Attorney Joseph D. Canty and
members of the jury with several
instances of "misconduct."
Garry alleged that the prosecutor
had unnecessarily confronted the jury
with prejudicial material by using
improper questions. He also objected
to portions of Canty's final argument.
'Political Verdict'
The brief also cites statements
made by jurors indicating that their
verdict may have been influenced by
the politics of the defendants rather
than the evidence. The
non-sequestered jurors may have read
newspaper accounts of the trial against
the judge's orders, Garry claimed.
Andrea Burt, the daughter of
Medicine Prof. Halsted Holman, is a

member of . Venceremos, a
revolutionary organization. She and
Burt were married in court last
February.
Besides rescheduling the sentencing
date, Haldorsen Wednesday ordered
the San Bernardino County Sheriff's
Department to return notes Andrea
Burt took during the trial that were
confiscated last week.
Next Trial
Two others are accused of murder,
assault, and lynching in connection
with the escape and will face trial in
San Bernardino Sept. 17. They are

former Venceremos member Jean
Hobson, who was arrested with Beaty
two months after the escape, and
Robert Seabock, whom Beaty has
singled out as the man who fired the
shots that killed the guard.
According to courtroom testimony,
four ambushers intercepted a state car
drive by two guards who were
transporting Beaty from the Chino
prison to a court hearing in San
Bernardino. The trigger-man yelled
"dirty pig!" and fired two shots
point-blank at the guards who had
been forced into the back seat.

Two others are accused of murder,
assault, and lynching in connection
with the escape and will face trial in
San Bernardino Sept. 17. They are

former Venceremos member Jean
Hobson, who was arrested with Beaty
two months after the escape, and
Robert Seabock, whom Beaty has
singled out as the man who fired the
shots that killed the guard.
According to courtroom testimony,
four ambushers intercepted a state car
drive by two guards who were
transporting Beaty from the Chino
prison to a court hearing in San
Bernardino. The trigger-man yelled
"dirty pig!" and fired two shots
point-blank at the guards who had
been forced into the back seat.
