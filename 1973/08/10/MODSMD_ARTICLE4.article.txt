# Agnew Claims Innocence, Mulls Executive Privilege
## 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
Special to the Daily
WASHINGTON - Vice President
Spiro T. Agnew left for a family va
ation on the West Coast yesterday,
apparently confident that the Federal
investigation of his conduct as Vice
President and as governor of Maryland
will turn up no wrong-doing.
Agnew is under investigation for
possible violation of bribery,
extortion, conspiracy and tax fraud
laws in connection with the awarding
of federal and state contracts, it was
learned early this week. Wednesday he
denounced the reports of possible
misconduct as "damned lies."
Federal investigators requested that
Agnew turn over his financial records
by 2 p.m. yesterday, but the deadline
passed with no records released.
Agnew was reportedly granted a

one-week delay so that his lawyers
could consider the constitutional
questions of the case, including
possible applications of executive
privilege.
"I have nothing to hide," Agnew
declared at a press conference
Wednesday. "I will make available at
the appropriate time and in the
appropriate way to the appropriate
authorities, as determined after
consultation with my counsel,
whatever records, my own body for
interrogation, whatever is needed."
Improprieties
The investigation is centered on
allegations that private engineering and
architectural firms were improperly
awarded federal contracts during
Agnew's term as Vice President and
that similar improprieties occurred
with state contracts while Agnew was
governor of Maryland.
Federal prosecutors, led by U.S.
Atty. George Beall are said to be
looking into what may be a broad web
of corruption including a large
assortment of prominent Maryland
Republican and Democratic
politicians, political fund raisers, and
several engineering and architectural
firms based in Maryland and
Washington.
Agnew and two of his close friends
and former fund raisers — J. Walter
Jones and I.H. (Bud) Hammerman,
both Baltimore investment bankers —
are being investigated for ties to an
alleged scheme in which Maryland
Republicans influenced the awarding
of contracts in return for kickbacks
for political contributions.
Innocence Declared
Agnew first responded to the
allegations Monday night in a

statement which declared that "I am
innocent of any wrongdoing, that I am
confident in the criminal justice
system of the United States and that I
am fully confident that my innocence
will be affirmed."
The press conference Wednesday
reaffirmed that position, although
Agnew did say that he "suspected"
that he had received campaign
contributions from contractors.
"Anyone who would expect that
campaign contributions don't come
from contracters doing state and
federal business" he said, "is quite
naive."
The Washington Post reported
yesterday that one of the Maryland
contractors under scrutiny in the
probe contacted at least one associate
of Agnew earlier this year to ask that
the Vice President use his influence to
stop the inquiry.
The contractor, Baltimore County
consulting engineer Lester Matz,
warned the intermediaries that the
continuing inquiry was bound to
effect Agnew. Agnew reportedly
received the message but refused to
take any action against the
investigation.

and former fund raisers — J. Walter
Jones and I.H. (Bud) Hammerman,
both Baltimore investment bankers —
are being investigated for ties to an
alleged scheme in which Maryland
Republicans influenced the awarding
of contracts in return for kickbacks
for political contributions.
Innocence Declared
Agnew first responded to the
allegations Monday night in a

statement which declared that "I am
innocent of any wrongdoing, that I am
confident in the criminal justice
system of the United States and that I
am fully confident that my innocence
will be affirmed."
The press conference Wednesday
reaffirmed that position, although
Agnew did say that he "suspected"
that he had received campaign
contributions from contractors.
"Anyone who would expect that
campaign contributions don't come
from contracters doing state and
federal business" he said, "is quite
naive."
The Washington Post reported
yesterday that one of the Maryland
contractors under scrutiny in the
probe contacted at least one associate
of Agnew earlier this year to ask that
the Vice President use his influence to
stop the inquiry.
The contractor, Baltimore County
consulting engineer Lester Matz,
warned the intermediaries that the
continuing inquiry was bound to
effect Agnew. Agnew reportedly
received the message but refused to
take any action against the
investigation.

Special to the Daily
WASHINGTON - Vice President
Spiro T. Agnew left for a family va
ation on the West Coast yesterday,
apparently confident that the Federal
investigation of his conduct as Vice
President and as governor of Maryland
will turn up no wrong-doing.
Agnew is under investigation for
possible violation of bribery,
extortion, conspiracy and tax fraud
laws in connection with the awarding
of federal and state contracts, it was
learned early this week. Wednesday he
denounced the reports of possible
misconduct as "damned lies."
Federal investigators requested that
Agnew turn over his financial records
by 2 p.m. yesterday, but the deadline
passed with no records released.
Agnew was reportedly granted a

one-week delay so that his lawyers
could consider the constitutional
questions of the case, including
possible applications of executive
privilege.
"I have nothing to hide," Agnew
declared at a press conference
Wednesday. "I will make available at
the appropriate time and in the
appropriate way to the appropriate
authorities, as determined after
consultation with my counsel,
whatever records, my own body for
interrogation, whatever is needed."
Improprieties
The investigation is centered on
allegations that private engineering and
architectural firms were improperly
awarded federal contracts during
Agnew's term as Vice President and
that similar improprieties occurred
with state contracts while Agnew was
governor of Maryland.
Federal prosecutors, led by U.S.
Atty. George Beall are said to be
looking into what may be a broad web
of corruption including a large
assortment of prominent Maryland
Republican and Democratic
politicians, political fund raisers, and
several engineering and architectural
firms based in Maryland and
Washington.
Agnew and two of his close friends
and former fund raisers — J. Walter
Jones and I.H. (Bud) Hammerman,
both Baltimore investment bankers —
are being investigated for ties to an
