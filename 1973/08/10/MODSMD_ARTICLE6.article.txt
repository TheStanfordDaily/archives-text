# Fired Public Safety Union Chief Rehired After Eight-Month Wait
## 
### 
Fired Public Safety Department
officer Wayne Warwick quietly
returned to work July 16 after an
independent arbiter upheld his
grievance against the University.
Warwick was president of the
Stanford Department of Public Safety
Officers Association (SDPSOA) when
he was fired last Nov. 30 for allegedly
moonlighting as a store detective while
on sick leave.
Harold Chapman, an attorney for
the security officers' union,
said at the time that Police Services
Director Marvin Herrington dismissed
Warwick "only because of his Union
activities."
Arbitration hearings were held in
private last March. Warwick told the
Daily yesterday that he learned of the
decision in his favor through his
attorney on July 3, and returned to
work two weeks later.
The arbitration decision termed the
eight months after Warwick's dismissal
a "leave of absence, not a firing," and
ordered that he be returned to his
former post as a mobile patrol officer
with full reinstatement of University
benefits.
However, the arbiter did not order
back pay for Warwick.
Warwick said the arbitrator decided

that dismissal was "clearly excessive
and that the remedy to that was
reinstatement. However he felt that
remedy with back pay was excessive as
far as the University was concerned
because at my salary it would have
cost them some $8000."
Warwick said he was pleased with
the decision, and said that reaction
from his co-workers was "generally

favorable." However, he refused to
comment on the reaction of his
superiors.
Warwick said he "understood" the
University's reluctance to announce
the decision to rehire him. "I think
they didn't want to publicize it
because they don't look too good."
He dismissed the argument that his
reinstatement was a personnel matter
and thus forced the University to treat
it confidentially as "hogwash. If they
wanted it to be confidential they
could certainly keep the dismissal
confidential, but I don't see what
anybody has to be ashamed of when
they get rehired," Warwick
commented.
Reflecting on Chapman's allegation
that the dismissal was based on the
officer's union involvement, Warwick
said, "There is no way to prove that
the whole thing took place as a result
of union activities. However, for what
other reason would such harsh and
excessive punishment be inflicted?"
Warwick said that he didn't want to
make "too many comments of an
outstanding nature" because they

might jeopardize his bid for
deputization as a reserve Santa Clara
County Sheriff's deputy.
He said that since he was not here
when the preliminary selection from
within the department was made, he
was being considered as an outside
applicant for the deputy's job, along
with 60-70 others.
"I certainly stand as good a chance
as anyone else to become a deputy.
University policy as published would
dictate that I have a better chance
than anyone else since I work here,
but University policy can be deviated
from. It's not a regulation that they
have to abide by."
Warwick said he hoped "people
involved realize that some of the
things I had to fight for I might not
have agreed with.

Arbitration hearings were held in
private last March. Warwick told the
Daily yesterday that he learned of the
decision in his favor through his
attorney on July 3, and returned to
work two weeks later.
The arbitration decision termed the
eight months after Warwick's dismissal
a "leave of absence, not a firing," and
ordered that he be returned to his
former post as a mobile patrol officer
with full reinstatement of University
benefits.
However, the arbiter did not order
back pay for Warwick.
Warwick said the arbitrator decided

that dismissal was "clearly excessive
and that the remedy to that was
reinstatement. However he felt that
remedy with back pay was excessive as
far as the University was concerned
because at my salary it would have
cost them some $8000."
Warwick said he was pleased with
the decision, and said that reaction
from his co-workers was "generally

favorable." However, he refused to
comment on the reaction of his
superiors.
Warwick said he "understood" the
University's reluctance to announce
the decision to rehire him. "I think
they didn't want to publicize it
because they don't look too good."
He dismissed the argument that his
reinstatement was a personnel matter
and thus forced the University to treat
it confidentially as "hogwash. If they
wanted it to be confidential they
could certainly keep the dismissal
confidential, but I don't see what
anybody has to be ashamed of when
they get rehired," Warwick
commented.
Reflecting on Chapman's allegation
that the dismissal was based on the
officer's union involvement, Warwick
said, "There is no way to prove that
the whole thing took place as a result
of union activities. However, for what
other reason would such harsh and
excessive punishment be inflicted?"
Warwick said that he didn't want to
make "too many comments of an
outstanding nature" because they

might jeopardize his bid for
deputization as a reserve Santa Clara
County Sheriff's deputy.
He said that since he was not here
when the preliminary selection from
within the department was made, he
was being considered as an outside
applicant for the deputy's job, along
with 60-70 others.
"I certainly stand as good a chance
as anyone else to become a deputy.
University policy as published would
dictate that I have a better chance
than anyone else since I work here,
but University policy can be deviated
from. It's not a regulation that they
have to abide by."
Warwick said he hoped "people
involved realize that some of the
things I had to fight for I might not
have agreed with.
Fired Public Safety Department
officer Wayne Warwick quietly
returned to work July 16 after an
independent arbiter upheld his
grievance against the University.
Warwick was president of the
Stanford Department of Public Safety
Officers Association (SDPSOA) when
he was fired last Nov. 30 for allegedly
moonlighting as a store detective while
on sick leave.
Harold Chapman, an attorney for
the security officers' union,
said at the time that Police Services
Director Marvin Herrington dismissed
Warwick "only because of his Union
activities."
