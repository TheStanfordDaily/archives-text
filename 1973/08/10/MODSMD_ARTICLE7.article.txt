improve Stanford's Japanese studies
program.
Japan's Prime Minister Kakuei
Tanaka announced during a visit to the
United States last week that his
government would donate $10 million
to various U.S. universities, but did
not identify the schools.
Besides Stanford, nine other
schools received grants of $1 million
each: the University of California at
Berkeley, Columbia, the University of
Chicago, Harvard, Yale, the University

of Hawaii, the University of Michigan,
Princeton and the University of
Washington at Seattle.
President Richard W. Lyman, who
learned of announcement of the grant
through reporters, said he was
"naturally, very pleased" at the gift.
However, Lyman said he could not
comment further since the University
had not been formally notified of the
grant, and did not know terms or
conditions attached to it.
Reports from Tokyo say the money
will be used to hire more professors in
Japanese studies.
