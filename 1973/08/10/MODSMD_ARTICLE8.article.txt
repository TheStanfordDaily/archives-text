# Suspicion, Scandal--Trademarks Of The 'Big Four'
## 
### ELLEN SWANBERG 
Scandal and suspicion surrounded
the Southern Pacific Railroad for the
40 years it was controlled by the "Big
Four"—Leland Stanford, Collis
Huntington, Mark Hopkins and
Charles Crocker. Both public and press
criticized the four's greed, dishonesty
and incompetence.
But 80-year-old author-historian
Oscar Lewis, who researched
newspaper accounts and personal
correspondence of the four, cautions,
"When we view their methods, we
must put them in a frame of
time... in those days, business was
conducted on a somewhat more selfish
basis."
Lewis' 1938 book, The Big Four,
was one of the first studies of the men
who ran the railroad.
'Pretty Ruthless'
"Even in their time, they were
pretty ruthless. You couldn't by any
stretch of the imagination call them
'public-spirited'. .. they were out to
make whatever money they could,"
Lewis told the Daily.
Shopkeeper Leland Stanford had
lived in California for nine years when
Theodore Judah came to him in 1861

with a plan for a transcontinental
railroad. Stanford invested $15,000 in
the newly-incorporated Central Pacific
Railroad of California—forerunner of
the S.P. Comparable investments from
Judah, Crocker, Huntington and
Hopkins supposedly gave just enough
to proceed.
However, the actual financial
situation of the railroad was
ambiguous. The four seemed to need
and actively solicit investments but
swiftly bought out stockholders who
criticized their management.
The four were already out for total
control. "That was how Judah got
them interested," declares Lewis. 44 'If
you do this," he said, 4 you can control
the traffic between the east and west
of the country.'
Monopoly
"They saw what they needed to do
was to get a monopoly, and to do this
they had to build branch lines. It took
a lot of borrowing, but they knew
they could control traffic and they did
for years.
"As soon as the period of rapid
expansion was over, I don't think they
even tried to sell stock. They were
insistent that they would control it

[the company] as long as the four
lived."
Stanford was named president of
the CPRR in 1861, and was elected
governor of California later that year.
Through his efforts, Congress
approved the Pacific railroad bill; the
secession of the south eliminated the
problem of Southern senators refusing
to approve the Pacific route.
Judah died in 1863 and left the
four in virtual control of the Central
Pacific. In the next several years they
battled through investment and labor
shortages, scandals, challenges, and the
biting criticisms of the public and the
press.
Press Strategy
But the company had a simple
strategy for handling the press.
"They would buy the newspaper,"
says Lewis. "Or they would launch a
rival paper. [William Randolph]
Hearst was their first serious rival. He
was the son of a rich man—he wasn't
interested in selling out."
The San Francisco Examiner
crusaded against the railroad. "The
citizens were all complaining. They
[the four] did the most ruthless
things. A merchant in Reno would

order [from] New York; they would
insist that the freight go to a
'distribution point' in San Francisco
first. Then they would charge him the
full amount."
The company established rate
schedules on the basis of "all the
traffic would bear," explains Lewis.
"They charged as much as they could.
It was time to stop raising rates when
the number of patrons went down."
The freight rate for produce was
determined by its market price. "In
good years the profit went not to [the
farmer], but to the railroad."
'Punish The Passenger'
Ambrose Bierce wrote extensively
for the Examiner on what he termed
"the methods devised by the railroad
company to punish the Demon
Passenger;"
"The Overland arrived at Midnight
last night, more than nine hours late,
and 20 passengers descended from
snow-covered cars. All were frozen and
half-starved, but thankful they had
escaped with their lives."
Another Examiner paragraph
described a suicide in Petaluma,
concluding: "Petaluma is not on the

BIG FOUR MINUS THREE — Leland Stanford made his millions — some of
which was eventually used to construct his University — through his involvement
in the construction of the western portion of the transcontinental railroad. One
of his less altruistic partners habitually referred to the University as "the circus."
