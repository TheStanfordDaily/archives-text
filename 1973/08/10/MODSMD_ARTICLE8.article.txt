# Suspicion, Scandal--Trademarks Of The 'Big Four'
## 
### ELLEN SWANBERG 
Scandal and suspicion surrounded
the Southern Pacific Railroad for the
40 years it was controlled by the "Big
Four"—Leland Stanford, Collis
Huntington, Mark Hopkins and
Charles Crocker. Both public and press
criticized the four's greed, dishonesty
and incompetence.
But 80-year-old author-historian
Oscar Lewis, who researched
newspaper accounts and personal
correspondence of the four, cautions,
"When we view their methods, we
must put them in a frame of
time... in those days, business was
conducted on a somewhat more selfish
basis."
Lewis' 1938 book, The Big Four,
was one of the first studies of the men
who ran the railroad.
'Pretty Ruthless'
"Even in their time, they were
pretty ruthless. You couldn't by any
stretch of the imagination call them
'public-spirited'. .. they were out to
make whatever money they could,"
Lewis told the Daily.
Shopkeeper Leland Stanford had
lived in California for nine years when
Theodore Judah came to him in 1861

with a plan for a transcontinental
railroad. Stanford invested $15,000 in
the newly-incorporated Central Pacific
Railroad of California—forerunner of
the S.P. Comparable investments from
Judah, Crocker, Huntington and
Hopkins supposedly gave just enough
to proceed.
However, the actual financial
situation of the railroad was
ambiguous. The four seemed to need
and actively solicit investments but
swiftly bought out stockholders who
criticized their management.
The four were already out for total
control. "That was how Judah got
them interested," declares Lewis. 44 'If
you do this," he said, 4 you can control
the traffic between the east and west
of the country.'
Monopoly
"They saw what they needed to do
was to get a monopoly, and to do this
they had to build branch lines. It took
a lot of borrowing, but they knew
they could control traffic and they did
for years.
"As soon as the period of rapid
expansion was over, I don't think they
even tried to sell stock. They were
insistent that they would control it

[the company] as long as the four
lived."
Stanford was named president of
the CPRR in 1861, and was elected
governor of California later that year.
Through his efforts, Congress
approved the Pacific railroad bill; the
secession of the south eliminated the
problem of Southern senators refusing
to approve the Pacific route.
Judah died in 1863 and left the
four in virtual control of the Central
Pacific. In the next several years they
battled through investment and labor
shortages, scandals, challenges, and the
biting criticisms of the public and the
press.
Press Strategy
But the company had a simple
strategy for handling the press.
"They would buy the newspaper,"
says Lewis. "Or they would launch a
rival paper. [William Randolph]
Hearst was their first serious rival. He
was the son of a rich man—he wasn't
interested in selling out."
The San Francisco Examiner
crusaded against the railroad. "The
citizens were all complaining. They
[the four] did the most ruthless
things. A merchant in Reno would

order [from] New York; they would
insist that the freight go to a
'distribution point' in San Francisco
first. Then they would charge him the
full amount."
The company established rate
schedules on the basis of "all the
traffic would bear," explains Lewis.
"They charged as much as they could.
It was time to stop raising rates when
the number of patrons went down."
The freight rate for produce was
determined by its market price. "In
good years the profit went not to [the
farmer], but to the railroad."
'Punish The Passenger'
Ambrose Bierce wrote extensively
for the Examiner on what he termed
"the methods devised by the railroad
company to punish the Demon
Passenger;"
"The Overland arrived at Midnight
last night, more than nine hours late,
and 20 passengers descended from
snow-covered cars. All were frozen and
half-starved, but thankful they had
escaped with their lives."
Another Examiner paragraph
described a suicide in Petaluma,
concluding: "Petaluma is not on the

BIG FOUR MINUS THREE — Leland Stanford made his millions — some of
which was eventually used to construct his University — through his involvement
in the construction of the western portion of the transcontinental railroad. One
of his less altruistic partners habitually referred to the University as "the circus."
line of the Southern Pacific Railroad.
The citizens of towns that enjoy that
privilege can commit suicide with far
less fuss and bother."
Worst Railroad
Bierce warned patrons of the
California railroad that they were
"exposed to the perils of senility." He
fumed in 1888, "the worst railroads in
America are in the West. The worst
railroads on the Pacific Coast are those
operated by the Southern Pacific
Company. The worst railroad operated
by the Southern Pacific Company is
the Central Pacific.
"It owes the government more
millions of dollars than Leland
Stanford has vanities; it will pay it
fewer cents than Collis P. Huntington
has virtues. It has always been
managed by rapacity tempered by
incompetence."
The four took advantage of every
possible source of finances. Observes
Lewis, "They did need
money ... they shrewdly realized the
liberal subsidies. Funds were given
them from the federal government,
states and counties. They'd play one
against the other. They'd say, "Well, if
you won't approve, we'll go to a rival
town.' They had the money rolling
in."
Finance Company
Another money-making device was
a self-made finance company. Railroad
work accelerated in 1867 with the
four's organization of the Contract
and Finance Company. Comments
Lewis:
"They decided, 'Why should we go
outside our own little circle to hire
contractors—we'll award contracts to
ourselves and build our own
railroads.' "
It was not until 1869 that the four
purchased its namesake-to-be, the
Southern Pacific. Some years later,
when they formed a new holding
company in Kentucky to transfer legal

jurisdiction in California suits to the
federal courts, they officially changed
the company's name to the Southern
Pacific.
Political Overseer
During and after his governorship
of 1861-63 and through his U.S.
Senate term of 1885-91, Stanford was
considered the political affairs overseer
for the railroad. To Lewis, Stanford's
prestige and popularity, rather than
ingenuity, granted him the corporate
presidency—a "figurehead" role. Lewis
writes in The Big Four:
"There remained Stanford, who
had all Huntington's craving for
leadership and much of his
ruthlessness, but who lacked the
other's adroit cunning and his talent
for moving in a direct line to a desired
end.
"In the battle that presently arose
for leadership, Stanford, heavy handed
and slow and often stupid, was easily
outmaneuvered, and from the
beginning to the end of their
association his was the secondary
place.
"Denied actual leadership, he seized
nominal leadership as the most
attractive substitute, a decision made
easier by Huntington's liking for
obscurity."
Records Vanish
After Hopkins' death in 1878, 15
volumes of company records vanished.
With intensifying outrage from the
press, public, and their own investors,
Big Four efforts did not prevent a
lengthy Pacific Railway Commission
investigation.
Among the more searing
conclusions of the probe was that
$2,250,000 set aside for "general
company expenses" was "used for the
purpose of influencing legislation and
of preventing the passage of measures
deemed to be hostile to the interests
of the company, and for the purpose
of influencing legislation."
Observes Lewis, "For years the

California legislature was kept under
control with yearly railroad passes.
They could ride anywhere, anytime."
About the report, and the
equally-scathing Examiner articles,
Lewis concludes, "The company
probably deserved everything that was
said about them in those days."
In later years Huntingon viewed
Stanford's increasing devotion to his
private hobbies of horsebreeding,
winemaking, real estate and
philanthropy with disgust.
Resented Stanford
"He felt Stanford wasn't doing his
share," says Lewis, who speculates tha
Huntington "was feeling sorry for
himself, working so hard. I think he
actually resented Stanford's greater
notoriety—his political career, the
University [which Huntington referred
to as "the circus"]. He thought it
nonsense, but it rankled him."
These later disagreements resulted
in Stanford's break with the
directorship of the railroad in 1890.
He did, however, continue as an
"advisor" until his death in 1893.
The only descendant of Stanford's
to continue financial involvement with
the Southern Pacific Company is the
University—and even this has been a
generally businesslike one of mutual
investments.
For several years the University and

Southern Pacific maintained a liaison
in mutual Board members, but in
recent years the two have had no
members in common. Before the
Southern Pacific Foundation was
established in 1960, the company
itself was a frequent donor to the
campus.
Stable Contributions
According to R.W. Humphrey,
secretary to the Foundation,
contributions to the campus have been
"fairly stable" over the last 10 years,
usually taking the form of unrestricted
gifts to the Graduate School of
Business of $8-10,000.

The University has also kept a
relatively consistent investment in the
SP Company. Rod Adams, manager of
investments, says the University has
"one of [its] smaller investments" in
Southern Pacific: 30,436 shares of
common stock, valued at $962,539.
However, the University has been
selling off parts of its holdings in
recent years.
Severe Judgment?
Reflecting on the 40-year reign of
the Big Four, Lewis puts his own view
into perspective, suggesting, "There are
people who thought I was too severe
in my judgment of the four. But mine

was so mild compared to what others
were saying. All the newspapers,
except the pro-railroads, made a career
out of abusing the railroad and
everybody connected with it.
"I think that at their time, although
there was a lot of criticism, a lot of
people envied and admired them for
doing these things. ...
"Their attitude was that they
hastened the development of the
Pacific Coast. They brought settlers
here, developed the agriculture. They
would say, ' we weren't thy only ones
who profited; it was the whole
country.' "
