bit. We have been delivering to Stanford for over thirty years and can help you plan any kind of party (well, almost any
kind!) from a casual TGIF to a more elaborate faculty-student cocktail party. We have the liquor, the beer, the wine, the
glasses, the ice, and all ihe fixins, plus thirty years of party know-how to help make any function a success. Remember,
over forty million Stanford students can't be wrong.
