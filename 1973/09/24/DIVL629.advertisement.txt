I WE'RE CONTRIBUTING I
We feel that a shopping center like ours should take
a larger part in helping the community — and that's
just what we're doing.
This year we have already assisted 35 charitable or
ganizations and we will continue to assist more. We
also held one of the largest smog control tests in the
West during February.
We have other ideas for the future. We are planning
activities for retarded and handicapped children at
Christmas as well as providing young artists a place to
show their work next summer. We are investigating a
recycling center and plan to work with the new region
al blood center at Stanford.
But we want to do more! We are interested in any
ideas that the Stanford community has for contribut
ing to an improvement in our way of life.
We're contributing and will continue to do our part.
We would like to hear from you. Please call or write
and give us your suggestion.
