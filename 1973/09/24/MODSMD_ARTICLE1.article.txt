# Prices Hit School In Pocket, Students In Stomach
## 
### CLAIRE SPIEGEL 
When the chow hits the plate this
quarter, students in Stanford's lofty
ivory tower will suddenly confront the
realities of the real world. Soaring
food prices are expected to hit the
University in the pocket and students
in the stomach.
It's "belt-tightening time," as Food
Service Manager Maxine Anderson put
it.
That means soybean additive in
hamburger patties and casseroles, one
apple per person per meal and no more
seconds on expensive meat disnes.
"We'll cut down on expensive items —
fresh fruit and some canned fruits,
which aren't even available," Anderson
said.
However, she affirmed that eggs
will be served for breakfast, despite a
staggering 119 percent price increase
in the last year. Bacon and sausage,
too, will be served for Sunday brunch.
But in general, "There will be less of
the more expensive [meat] cuts," said
Edward Scoles, director of housing
management.

Prices will continue to soar,
predicts Sterling Silver, manager of
Stanford's commissary, which supplies
campus dining facilities with 1.5
million pounds of meat during the
school year. Meat shortages which hit
the commissary this summer are not
expected to affect supplies this fall, he
added.
According to a survey conducted
by the food service, the price of bacon
has shot up 84 percent since last
September. Turkey is up 97 percent;

chicken, 69 percent; ground beef, 57
percent; oil, 88 percent; and flour. 63
percent.
Scoles said, "A 10 percent increase
was cranked into the budget last fall"
in expectation of rising food costs. But
Frank Riddle, director of fiscal
planning and accounts, explained that
food prices climbed much higher than
anticipated. The University will rely in
part upon its reserves to absorb the
shock of the increases.
Anderson is also concerned about

making ends meet, and she pointed
out that the 3.8 percent increase in
students' board bills alone will not
compensate for greater expenses.
Cutting Out Waste
So, she is urging students to help
out by eliminating waste. "Eat what
you take," she emphasized.
An orange flyer decorating dorm
dining halls reads: "Do you know
what the cost would be if we take one
extra pat of butter at every meal (and
don't use it)? One pat of butter costs

lc." So 2600 persons would waste
$494 worth of butter per week, or
$1,976 per month.
Anderson is also urging students
not to hoard food in their rooms. That
goes for dishes too. "Some of our
chinaware just walks off," she said.
Replacement costs can run as high as
$15,000 per year.
Last-Ditch Effort
If reducing waste and tightening
belts doesn't work, Riddle said the
University would resort to raising

board bills as "a last-ditch effort."
A student who feels his belt buckle
rubbing his backbone and forsakes
dorm food for Tresidder's meals will
find the prices have increased about 18
percent across the board. Skip
Mclntyre, president of Tout de Suite
Inc. (TDS), which manages Tresidder's
cafeteria and coffee house, said the
increase — the first in 15 months — is
due to a massive increase in wholesale
prices.
Training Table
In addition to supplying Tresidder's
cafeteria and coffee shop, TDS has
contracted with the Athletic
Department to feed 78 football
players and 17 affiliated personnel.
According to Reba Lewis, manager of
the football training table, the big
boys are getting their fill. She said,
'They've had steak, chicken teriyaki,
roast beef, sirloin steak and prime rib"
— meat that even the White House had
trouble ordering only a month ago.
As Mclntyre put it, "We can't send
them off to the Rose Bowl on peanut
butter and jelly sandwiches."
