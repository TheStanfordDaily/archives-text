# The
						world is a teacher
## Beyond The Ivory Tower...

Welcome, freshmen, to the
new, improved Stanford.
Although it is quiet enough
now to go about the 'business' of
education without the rude
interruptions of political turmoil
that characterized the campus but
a few years ago, you should be
put on alert.
For if it is education you seek,
a quiet campus is not likely to
afford it easily. Quite the
contrary. It will make education
all the more elusive; it will make
the process of education, which is
the process of personal change, all
the more dependent on
self-initiative. And that, from the
perspective of one who has never
been overburdened with
self-initiative, ain't easy.
Even worse, it will make it
difficult to obtain the most
important kind of education, and
that is a political education.
A political education is what
Kropotkin spoke of when he said,
"Think about the kind of world
you want to live and work in.
What do you need to know to
build the world? Demand that
your teachers teach you that."
That was one of the many
demands of the students of the ,
nineteen-sixties. And while we
should not lionize the rebels of
those years, or make myth of
their Movement, we can learn
from their history.
Discoveries
One of their first discoveries
was that the University was not
providing them a political
education d'apres Kropotkin. One
of their first responses was,
naturally epough, to expand their
intellectual inquiry beyond the
strictures of University courses.
When their inquiry led them to
question the American political
and social order, the impulse to
change often outstripped the
impulse merely to learn.
Such instances — the civil
rights crusades and the Mississippi
Summer, the draft resistance and
the anti-ROTC and antiwar
campaigns — required students to
look frankly and closely at the
political premises by which they
were running their lives. It was a
rude, harsh, and uncomfortable
experience, which may suggest
that it was a good deal more
educative than the general run of
undergraduate studies.
"I learned and felt more about
American society in the few days
of the student strike," said one
Berkeley student, "than in four
years of taking courses."
Such an opportunity to learn
and, as important, to feel, may be
lost in the nineteen-seventies.
There is a disquieting parallel —
as yet unproven — between this
time of tranquil, unquestioning
campuses and that of the
nineteen-fifties. The analogy is

most disturbing — the fifties were
a time of intellectual and political
quiet as well as domestic
tranquillity, a time in which social
change was nearly stilled and in
which civil liberties were beaten
and flogged.
More important to the point at
hand, the nineteen-fifties
produced a generation that, in the
words of historian Christopher
Lasch, never got a political
education.
There may be relatively little
an individual student — or the
most eminent scholar — can do to
prevent a new drift toward
intellectual eunuchry, if that be
the temper of the time. But a
return to the illusory and
destructive 'end of ideology' of
twenty years ago can and should
be resisted fiercely — by
individuals who refuse to be
educationally shortchanged by
being denied a political education.
Opportunities
The University, as an
institution, can be expected to
provide little help. The dictates of

self-preservation make a large
institution prefer safe ideas to
dangerous ones.
Nevertheless, the years of
University education present an
opportunity for basic questioning
and personal redirection. Those
serious about their own education
— those who have thought
seriously about its purposes — will
resist attempts to restrict that
opportunity, and embrace
occasions to expand it. They will
seek out disagreement; they will
seek out radical ideas, Left and
Right, for the challenge they offer
and the truth they hold.
Indeed, gentle reader, if you
seize the opportunity to gain a
political education, you can even
have a great deal of fun.
But if you spend time here
merely studying, and leave
without a political education, you
really won't have much of an
education at all.
