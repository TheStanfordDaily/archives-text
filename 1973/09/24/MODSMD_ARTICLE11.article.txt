Editor:
Hi, last year I handy rote over
7,000 letters in an attempt to
become an active candidate for
the office of President of the
U.S.A. Yes, I'm eligible.
My 1972 effort was made from
a prison cell. Soon I may be
offered my freedom.
Would the students at Stanford
accept an ex-con as a serious
presidential candidate? The

answer is important to me.
Many of you fellow students
might be willing to send me a
brief postcard or letter expressing
individual opinions.
My telling you that I'm a nice
friendly guy may not be very
convincing. Therefore, I suggest
that the students willing to write
me give no return address and use
"Indian" for a signature.
I'd really appreciate anything
you might do to encourage
response.
Sincerely,
John J. Desmond, Jr. 19491
