# College life: A never-never land
## We May Never Pass This Way Again 
### 
Mark Weaver

It was four years ago this week
that I first arrived on that
quadrennial island known as the
campus. That fall crispness was in
the air but instead of waiting for
the early morning school bus I
found myself part of a large
caravan of luggage strewn autos
streaming toward the dorms with
young fearful faces much like my
own curiously peering out at that
great unknown soon to be their
home.
I rushed up to room 104 and
was shocked. "I'm supposed to
live in this," I thought. "My
roommate," came to mind next.
"Will he be a dud or will we be
the best of friends?" My parents
helped me pile my junk in a neat

pile on my side of the room and
drove off as my mother made a
big scene with her tears,
embarrassing the hell out of me
right in front of all my future
peers.
I was left standing face to face
with the hollow dorm corridor
stretching out before me. There
was not a shred of familiarity to
be grasped and the emptiness set
in, tempered only by the
anticipation of this strange new
exciting place. For the first time
you are all alone. No family, no
friends. It is time to start anew.
That first week was about the
strangest I ever suffered through.
Thrown into a totally foreign
environment you witness the total

destruction of routine. The only
way to recover your equilibrium is
to undergo the pain of seven days
of awkwardness.
The Wrong Way
You usually start out by
getting in the lunch line and
realizing that everybody else is
moving toward you. Then you go
over to the Wilbur milk machines,
pull the whole milk lever and get a
cup of chocolate. But you're not
doing so bad. There was the kid
who thought he pushed the
ketchup button and got Pepsi all
over his lamb chop.
Next there is that obscenity
called "registration." It was a lot
more complicated four years ago
but it is still pure frustration.
"W's" do their thing from 11:00
til 11:45 but you walk in at noon
because you asked someone where
memorial something was and they
sent you to Memorial Church
when what you really wanted was
Memorial Auditorium. So you
hunt down the "LATES" table
and rush back to the dorm to find
out it is 1:05 and they stopped
serving lunch five minutes ago.
What a bitch.
The next day classes start. You
are on your way to a ten o'clock,
and stop a co-ed to ask where
Bishop auditorium is. She admits
she is a freshman too. So you grab
someone else. "Oh yeah, that's on
the other side of campus," he
says, sportingly. Headaches. You
start running in the direction he
pointed and at 10:10 rush into
the room panting like a dog only
to be greeted by a professor who
quips that you are not dressed for
jogging. A patient upper-classman
asks to see your schedule and
points out that your class meets
there on Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday and that today is Tuesday.
Hang In There
If you are a frosh, bear up. We
veterans look back on that harred

beginning with misty-eyed
amusement. The only real hassle is
in your mind. After my best
friend had finished his first day of
college I asked him "What is it
like?" He replied excitedly, "God
it is horrible. One guy already
jumped out his fourth floor dorm
window!" A month later I learned
that that guy had merely been
cleaning his window. "Well I
didn't say he hit the ground," my
friend retorted. Things get blown
up out of proportion that first
week. You learn to laugh it off.
But at times even this is hard.
At the end of your first class the
professor announces that "the
assignment for tomorrow is to
read chapters one through twelve
in Sorensen and pages 360
through 440 in Tinnerowitz."
That has a way of wiping the
smile off your face. So you repare
to the security of ... correction,
the insecurity of your dorm where
everyone is, amusingly leaving his
door wide open in a not too
subtle invitation for you to drop
in and get acquainted.
Ah yes. The freshman dorm.
No one should miss the
experience. It was invented by a
couple of psychologists who
decided to throw several score of
mixed-up floundering post
adolescents into close quarters,
give them the run of the place and
then watch what would happen. It
is literally "the blind leading the
blind" as someone once said.
"Weirdness," was the way I think
we described it.
The Dorm
The freshman dorm Is a nine
month sensitivity session. Friends
are close and so are acquaintances.
You know what Paul and Marty
are up to down the hall even if
you do not know them all that
well. In the adjustment from
parental authority to
self-sufficiency you lean on each
other without realizing it,
sometimes even knocking each
other down in the process.
All four years are much this
way, though not so intense. They
are a getting in touch with other's
ideas, lifestyles, and emotions.
They are a getting in touch with
oneself.
Perhaps more than anything
else college is remembered in
terms of the friends made there.
Few situations are more ideal
for fostering the growth of
friendships, be they deep or
shallow, sexual or platonic. A
campus is the coming together of
a group of people of the same age
and of similar interests, all of
whom are going through the same
unique, all-pervasive experience.
Wherever you go, interaction is
intense; from the dorm to the
classroom to extra-curricular
activities. A friend is never more
than fifteen minutes away and
usually is just down the hall.
These are the times when
schedules are flexible and leisure
time plentiful enough for a group
to do things together often.
Looking back now I lament the
transient nature of college
friendships. While friends were
plentiful, good friends were a
rarity. All too often best friends
one month went their separate
ways the next. Once out of
college too many people crawl
into their marraiges and lock out
the life outside them.
Looking back now, these were
four years I wish were twenty. As
I review the past and ponder the
future I come to believe what 1
once scorned as parental banality:
"Your college years will be the
best years of your life."
Never-Never Land
College is a unique never-nevei
land where you are responsible
enough to chuck responsibility
and go have some fun. Ah whal
memories: the weekend trip t(
the Grand Canyon just to see i
you could make it there and bacl
in time for Monday mornin)
classes, the midnight bull sessioi
that spontaneously decided t<
take off for the beach, the nigh
Trancos was attacked by wate
balloons catapulted over fron
Toyon, and of course thosi
pinball marathons.
College is also a place when
you go through a lot of shit am
end up laughing about it. Then
were those immortal all-nighters
doggedly pursued as a pape
deadline comes screaming over th
early morning horizon. Then, th
next day, feeling totally depravei
and wretched, you sullenly ham

your masterpiece to a knowing
professor.
Then there are those
unforgettable finals weeks when
everybody goes bananas from the
pressure. You could just sense the
tension built up in everyone from
too many non-stop hours spent
over books. The release is
infectious and utterly comic.
Dinner-time chatter during finals
weeks is twice the normal volume.
Everything becomes funny.
People will sit around in the halls
and laugh at the most trite things.
"What did the penquin yell as he
fell out of his boat?" went one
joke. "Radio!" We never laughed
so hard, fifteen minutes straight.
Water Fight
I remember the night a physics
major figured out a way to turn
off all the dorm lights and a wild
water fight engulfed all three
floors. The topper was the night
we filled someone's room almost
to the ceiling with scores of
scrunched up Chicago Tribunes.
The janitors hated us for that
prank.
The authorities did not cotton
to our political activism much
either. Protest was a way of life
and lent college a special
excitement.
Each spring we braced for the
annual rite of dissidence. And in
1970, it hit the hardest, just
before I transferred to Stanford.
What an initiation for a freshman.
I remember the whole dorm
packed into the lounge to watch
Nixon announce the invasion of
Cambodia. The next thing I
remember was the thousands of
demonstrators marching across
campus. I remember the night the
guard moved in and imposed a
seven-thirty curfew. Suddenly we
were rushing to close the dorm
windows and jamming wet rags
under our doors to keep the tear
gas out. That was the night we
thought the revolution had
started.
Sit-In
Then there was that incredible
night six thousand students sat in
on the president's lawn and
demanded he close the school.
When he terminated classes a
month early they went into
pandamonium. What a night it
was. Thousands streamed into the
main street of nearby Carbondale
singing, dancing, uncorking rivers
of wine and openly smoking
marijuana.
Politics permeated all aspects
of college life in those years. The
usual penny pinching of students
buffeted by high tuition was
romanticized into a political
anti-materialistic dialectic. Even
the more affluent students joined
in, living meagerly for the sheer
adventure of it. Frayed shirts and
ragged pants were "cool" even if
you had to spend a weekend
running your new jeans through
the washer. What an
accomplishment it was to nurse a
pair of faded and patched trousers
into a life after death. The
romance of the open road
persuaded many to stick out a
thumb even though the bank
account back at school could well
afford a bus ticket.
Those were the years the
pre-meds were accused of being
hot reds instead of red hots and
talked about working in
community clinics instead of
tenth floor suites. Those were the
years when booking slacked off
and learning was more for its own
sake than the job waiting at the
other end.
Good Old Days
Those were the days when
smoking dope was more deviant
than chic. And when too many
people went over-board with
drugs. That was when a friend of
mine bought his first pair of
bell-bottoms and could still admit
"A year ago I resolved I would
never be caught dead in these
things." Those were the days of
Abbey Road, Iron Butterfly, anc"
Blood, Sweat, and Tears. Thos'
were the days. Those were thi
days.
If you are a
freshman right now, cheer up.
Look what you have to look
forward to. All too soon you will
be looking back and wistfully
whispering, "Those where the
days."

Politics permeated all aspects
of college life in those years. The
usual penny pinching of students
buffeted by high tuition was
romanticized into a political
anti-materialistic dialectic. Even
the more affluent students joined
in, living meagerly for the sheer
adventure of it. Frayed shirts and
ragged pants were "cool" even if
you had to spend a weekend
running your new jeans through
the washer. What an
accomplishment it was to nurse a
pair of faded and patched trousers
into a life after death. The
romance of the open road
persuaded many to stick out a
thumb even though the bank
account back at school could well
afford a bus ticket.
Those were the years the
pre-meds were accused of being
hot reds instead of red hots and
talked about working in
community clinics instead of
tenth floor suites. Those were the
years when booking slacked off
and learning was more for its own
sake than the job waiting at the
other end.
Good Old Days
Those were the days when
smoking dope was more deviant
than chic. And when too many
people went over-board with
drugs. That was when a friend of
mine bought his first pair of
bell-bottoms and could still admit
"A year ago I resolved I would
never be caught dead in these
things." Those were the days of
Abbey Road, Iron Butterfly, anc"
Blood, Sweat, and Tears. Thos'
were the days. Those were thi
days.
If you are a
freshman right now, cheer up.
Look what you have to look
forward to. All too soon you will
be looking back and wistfully
whispering, "Those where the
days."

It was four years ago this week
that I first arrived on that
quadrennial island known as the
campus. That fall crispness was in
the air but instead of waiting for
the early morning school bus I
found myself part of a large
caravan of luggage strewn autos
streaming toward the dorms with
young fearful faces much like my
own curiously peering out at that
great unknown soon to be their
home.
I rushed up to room 104 and
was shocked. "I'm supposed to
live in this," I thought. "My
roommate," came to mind next.
"Will he be a dud or will we be
the best of friends?" My parents
helped me pile my junk in a neat

pile on my side of the room and
drove off as my mother made a
big scene with her tears,
embarrassing the hell out of me
right in front of all my future
peers.
I was left standing face to face
with the hollow dorm corridor
stretching out before me. There
was not a shred of familiarity to
be grasped and the emptiness set
in, tempered only by the
anticipation of this strange new
exciting place. For the first time
you are all alone. No family, no
friends. It is time to start anew.
That first week was about the
strangest I ever suffered through.
Thrown into a totally foreign
environment you witness the total

destruction of routine. The only
way to recover your equilibrium is
to undergo the pain of seven days
of awkwardness.
The Wrong Way
You usually start out by
getting in the lunch line and
realizing that everybody else is
moving toward you. Then you go
over to the Wilbur milk machines,
pull the whole milk lever and get a
cup of chocolate. But you're not
doing so bad. There was the kid
who thought he pushed the
ketchup button and got Pepsi all
over his lamb chop.
Next there is that obscenity
called "registration." It was a lot
more complicated four years ago
but it is still pure frustration.
"W's" do their thing from 11:00
til 11:45 but you walk in at noon
because you asked someone where
memorial something was and they
sent you to Memorial Church
when what you really wanted was
Memorial Auditorium. So you
hunt down the "LATES" table
and rush back to the dorm to find
out it is 1:05 and they stopped
serving lunch five minutes ago.
What a bitch.
The next day classes start. You
are on your way to a ten o'clock,
and stop a co-ed to ask where
Bishop auditorium is. She admits
she is a freshman too. So you grab
someone else. "Oh yeah, that's on
the other side of campus," he
says, sportingly. Headaches. You
start running in the direction he
pointed and at 10:10 rush into
the room panting like a dog only
to be greeted by a professor who
quips that you are not dressed for
jogging. A patient upper-classman
asks to see your schedule and
points out that your class meets
there on Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday and that today is Tuesday.
Hang In There
If you are a frosh, bear up. We
veterans look back on that harred

beginning with misty-eyed
amusement. The only real hassle is
in your mind. After my best
friend had finished his first day of
college I asked him "What is it
like?" He replied excitedly, "God
it is horrible. One guy already
jumped out his fourth floor dorm
window!" A month later I learned
that that guy had merely been
cleaning his window. "Well I
didn't say he hit the ground," my
friend retorted. Things get blown
up out of proportion that first
week. You learn to laugh it off.
But at times even this is hard.
At the end of your first class the
professor announces that "the
assignment for tomorrow is to
read chapters one through twelve
in Sorensen and pages 360
through 440 in Tinnerowitz."
That has a way of wiping the
smile off your face. So you repare
to the security of ... correction,
the insecurity of your dorm where
everyone is, amusingly leaving his
door wide open in a not too
subtle invitation for you to drop
in and get acquainted.
Ah yes. The freshman dorm.
No one should miss the
experience. It was invented by a
couple of psychologists who
decided to throw several score of
mixed-up floundering post
adolescents into close quarters,
give them the run of the place and
then watch what would happen. It
is literally "the blind leading the
blind" as someone once said.
"Weirdness," was the way I think
we described it.
The Dorm
The freshman dorm Is a nine
month sensitivity session. Friends
are close and so are acquaintances.
You know what Paul and Marty
are up to down the hall even if
you do not know them all that
well. In the adjustment from
parental authority to
self-sufficiency you lean on each
other without realizing it,
sometimes even knocking each
other down in the process.
All four years are much this
way, though not so intense. They
are a getting in touch with other's
ideas, lifestyles, and emotions.
They are a getting in touch with
oneself.
Perhaps more than anything
else college is remembered in
terms of the friends made there.
Few situations are more ideal
for fostering the growth of
friendships, be they deep or
shallow, sexual or platonic. A
campus is the coming together of
a group of people of the same age
and of similar interests, all of
whom are going through the same
unique, all-pervasive experience.
Wherever you go, interaction is
intense; from the dorm to the
classroom to extra-curricular
activities. A friend is never more
than fifteen minutes away and
usually is just down the hall.
These are the times when
schedules are flexible and leisure
time plentiful enough for a group
to do things together often.
Looking back now I lament the
transient nature of college
friendships. While friends were
plentiful, good friends were a
rarity. All too often best friends
one month went their separate
ways the next. Once out of
college too many people crawl
into their marraiges and lock out
the life outside them.
Looking back now, these were
four years I wish were twenty. As
I review the past and ponder the
future I come to believe what 1
once scorned as parental banality:
"Your college years will be the
best years of your life."
Never-Never Land
College is a unique never-nevei
land where you are responsible
enough to chuck responsibility
and go have some fun. Ah whal
memories: the weekend trip t(
the Grand Canyon just to see i
you could make it there and bacl
in time for Monday mornin)
classes, the midnight bull sessioi
that spontaneously decided t<
take off for the beach, the nigh
Trancos was attacked by wate
balloons catapulted over fron
Toyon, and of course thosi
pinball marathons.
College is also a place when
you go through a lot of shit am
end up laughing about it. Then
were those immortal all-nighters
doggedly pursued as a pape
deadline comes screaming over th
early morning horizon. Then, th
next day, feeling totally depravei
and wretched, you sullenly ham

your masterpiece to a knowing
professor.
Then there are those
unforgettable finals weeks when
everybody goes bananas from the
pressure. You could just sense the
tension built up in everyone from
too many non-stop hours spent
over books. The release is
infectious and utterly comic.
Dinner-time chatter during finals
weeks is twice the normal volume.
Everything becomes funny.
People will sit around in the halls
and laugh at the most trite things.
"What did the penquin yell as he
fell out of his boat?" went one
joke. "Radio!" We never laughed
so hard, fifteen minutes straight.
Water Fight
I remember the night a physics
major figured out a way to turn
off all the dorm lights and a wild
water fight engulfed all three
floors. The topper was the night
we filled someone's room almost
to the ceiling with scores of
scrunched up Chicago Tribunes.
The janitors hated us for that
prank.
The authorities did not cotton
to our political activism much
either. Protest was a way of life
and lent college a special
excitement.
Each spring we braced for the
annual rite of dissidence. And in
1970, it hit the hardest, just
before I transferred to Stanford.
What an initiation for a freshman.
I remember the whole dorm
packed into the lounge to watch
Nixon announce the invasion of
Cambodia. The next thing I
remember was the thousands of
demonstrators marching across
campus. I remember the night the
guard moved in and imposed a
seven-thirty curfew. Suddenly we
were rushing to close the dorm
windows and jamming wet rags
under our doors to keep the tear
gas out. That was the night we
thought the revolution had
started.
Sit-In
Then there was that incredible
night six thousand students sat in
on the president's lawn and
demanded he close the school.
When he terminated classes a
month early they went into
pandamonium. What a night it
was. Thousands streamed into the
main street of nearby Carbondale
singing, dancing, uncorking rivers
of wine and openly smoking
marijuana.
Politics permeated all aspects
of college life in those years. The
usual penny pinching of students
buffeted by high tuition was
romanticized into a political
anti-materialistic dialectic. Even
the more affluent students joined

and laugh at the most trite things.
"What did the penquin yell as he
fell out of his boat?" went one
joke. "Radio!" We never laughed
so hard, fifteen minutes straight.
Water Fight
I remember the night a physics
major figured out a way to turn
off all the dorm lights and a wild
water fight engulfed all three
floors. The topper was the night
we filled someone's room almost
to the ceiling with scores of
scrunched up Chicago Tribunes.
The janitors hated us for that
prank.
The authorities did not cotton
to our political activism much
either. Protest was a way of life
and lent college a special
excitement.
Each spring we braced for the
annual rite of dissidence. And in
1970, it hit the hardest, just
before I transferred to Stanford.
What an initiation for a freshman.
I remember the whole dorm
packed into the lounge to watch
Nixon announce the invasion of
Cambodia. The next thing I
remember was the thousands of
demonstrators marching across
campus. I remember the night the
guard moved in and imposed a
seven-thirty curfew. Suddenly we
were rushing to close the dorm
windows and jamming wet rags
under our doors to keep the tear
gas out. That was the night we
thought the revolution had
started.
Sit-In
Then there was that incredible
night six thousand students sat in
on the president's lawn and
demanded he close the school.
When he terminated classes a
month early they went into
pandamonium. What a night it
was. Thousands streamed into the
main street of nearby Carbondale
singing, dancing, uncorking rivers
of wine and openly smoking
marijuana.
Politics permeated all aspects
of college life in those years. The
usual penny pinching of students
buffeted by high tuition was
romanticized into a political
anti-materialistic dialectic. Even
the more affluent students joined
in, living meagerly for the sheer
adventure of it. Frayed shirts and
ragged pants were "cool" even if
you had to spend a weekend
running your new jeans through
the washer. What an
accomplishment it was to nurse a
pair of faded and patched trousers
into a life after death. The
romance of the open road
persuaded many to stick out a
thumb even though the bank
account back at school could well
afford a bus ticket.
Those were the years the
pre-meds were accused of being
hot reds instead of red hots and
talked about working in
community clinics instead of
tenth floor suites. Those were the
years when booking slacked off
and learning was more for its own
sake than the job waiting at the
other end.
Good Old Days
Those were the days when
smoking dope was more deviant
than chic. And when too many
people went over-board with
drugs. That was when a friend of
mine bought his first pair of
bell-bottoms and could still admit
"A year ago I resolved I would
never be caught dead in these
things." Those were the days of
Abbey Road, Iron Butterfly, anc"
Blood, Sweat, and Tears. Thos'
were the days. Those were thi
days.
If you are a
freshman right now, cheer up.
Look what you have to look
forward to. All too soon you will
be looking back and wistfully
whispering, "Those where the
days."

It was four years ago this week
that I first arrived on that
quadrennial island known as the
campus. That fall crispness was in
the air but instead of waiting for
the early morning school bus I
found myself part of a large
caravan of luggage strewn autos
streaming toward the dorms with
young fearful faces much like my
own curiously peering out at that
great unknown soon to be their
home.
I rushed up to room 104 and
was shocked. "I'm supposed to
live in this," I thought. "My
roommate," came to mind next.
"Will he be a dud or will we be
the best of friends?" My parents
helped me pile my junk in a neat

pile on my side of the room and
drove off as my mother made a
big scene with her tears,
embarrassing the hell out of me
right in front of all my future
peers.
I was left standing face to face
with the hollow dorm corridor
stretching out before me. There
was not a shred of familiarity to
be grasped and the emptiness set
in, tempered only by the
anticipation of this strange new
exciting place. For the first time
you are all alone. No family, no
friends. It is time to start anew.
That first week was about the
strangest I ever suffered through.
Thrown into a totally foreign
environment you witness the total

destruction of routine. The only
way to recover your equilibrium is
to undergo the pain of seven days
of awkwardness.
The Wrong Way
You usually start out by
getting in the lunch line and
realizing that everybody else is
moving toward you. Then you go
over to the Wilbur milk machines,
pull the whole milk lever and get a
cup of chocolate. But you're not
doing so bad. There was the kid
who thought he pushed the
ketchup button and got Pepsi all
over his lamb chop.
Next there is that obscenity
called "registration." It was a lot
more complicated four years ago
but it is still pure frustration.
"W's" do their thing from 11:00
til 11:45 but you walk in at noon
because you asked someone where
memorial something was and they
sent you to Memorial Church
when what you really wanted was
Memorial Auditorium. So you
hunt down the "LATES" table
and rush back to the dorm to find
out it is 1:05 and they stopped
serving lunch five minutes ago.
What a bitch.
The next day classes start. You
are on your way to a ten o'clock,
and stop a co-ed to ask where
Bishop auditorium is. She admits
she is a freshman too. So you grab
someone else. "Oh yeah, that's on
the other side of campus," he
says, sportingly. Headaches. You
start running in the direction he
pointed and at 10:10 rush into
the room panting like a dog only
to be greeted by a professor who
quips that you are not dressed for
jogging. A patient upper-classman
asks to see your schedule and
points out that your class meets
there on Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday and that today is Tuesday.
Hang In There
If you are a frosh, bear up. We
veterans look back on that harred

beginning with misty-eyed
amusement. The only real hassle is
in your mind. After my best
friend had finished his first day of
college I asked him "What is it
like?" He replied excitedly, "God
it is horrible. One guy already
jumped out his fourth floor dorm
window!" A month later I learned
that that guy had merely been
cleaning his window. "Well I
didn't say he hit the ground," my
friend retorted. Things get blown
up out of proportion that first
week. You learn to laugh it off.
But at times even this is hard.
At the end of your first class the
professor announces that "the
assignment for tomorrow is to
read chapters one through twelve
in Sorensen and pages 360
through 440 in Tinnerowitz."
That has a way of wiping the
smile off your face. So you repare
to the security of ... correction,
the insecurity of your dorm where
everyone is, amusingly leaving his
door wide open in a not too
subtle invitation for you to drop
in and get acquainted.
Ah yes. The freshman dorm.
No one should miss the
experience. It was invented by a
couple of psychologists who
decided to throw several score of
mixed-up floundering post
adolescents into close quarters,
give them the run of the place and
then watch what would happen. It
is literally "the blind leading the
blind" as someone once said.
"Weirdness," was the way I think
we described it.
The Dorm
The freshman dorm Is a nine
month sensitivity session. Friends
are close and so are acquaintances.
You know what Paul and Marty
are up to down the hall even if
you do not know them all that
well. In the adjustment from
parental authority to
self-sufficiency you lean on each
other without realizing it,
sometimes even knocking each
other down in the process.
All four years are much this
way, though not so intense. They
are a getting in touch with other's
ideas, lifestyles, and emotions.
They are a getting in touch with
oneself.
Perhaps more than anything
else college is remembered in
terms of the friends made there.
Few situations are more ideal
for fostering the growth of
friendships, be they deep or
shallow, sexual or platonic. A
campus is the coming together of
a group of people of the same age
and of similar interests, all of
whom are going through the same
unique, all-pervasive experience.
Wherever you go, interaction is
intense; from the dorm to the
classroom to extra-curricular
activities. A friend is never more
than fifteen minutes away and
usually is just down the hall.
These are the times when
schedules are flexible and leisure
time plentiful enough for a group
to do things together often.
Looking back now I lament the
transient nature of college
friendships. While friends were
plentiful, good friends were a
rarity. All too often best friends
one month went their separate
ways the next. Once out of
college too many people crawl
into their marraiges and lock out
the life outside them.
Looking back now, these were
four years I wish were twenty. As
I review the past and ponder the
future I come to believe what 1
once scorned as parental banality:
"Your college years will be the
best years of your life."
Never-Never Land
College is a unique never-nevei
land where you are responsible
enough to chuck responsibility
and go have some fun. Ah whal
memories: the weekend trip t(
the Grand Canyon just to see i
you could make it there and bacl
in time for Monday mornin)
classes, the midnight bull sessioi
that spontaneously decided t<
take off for the beach, the nigh
Trancos was attacked by wate
balloons catapulted over fron
Toyon, and of course thosi
pinball marathons.
College is also a place when
you go through a lot of shit am
end up laughing about it. Then
were those immortal all-nighters
doggedly pursued as a pape
deadline comes screaming over th
early morning horizon. Then, th
next day, feeling totally depravei
and wretched, you sullenly ham

your masterpiece to a knowing
professor.
Then there are those
unforgettable finals weeks when
everybody goes bananas from the
pressure. You could just sense the
tension built up in everyone from
too many non-stop hours spent
over books. The release is
infectious and utterly comic.
Dinner-time chatter during finals
weeks is twice the normal volume.
Everything becomes funny.
People will sit around in the halls
and laugh at the most trite things.

plentiful, good friends were a
rarity. All too often best friends
one month went their separate
ways the next. Once out of
college too many people crawl
into their marraiges and lock out
the life outside them.
Looking back now, these were
four years I wish were twenty. As
I review the past and ponder the
future I come to believe what 1
once scorned as parental banality:
"Your college years will be the
best years of your life."
Never-Never Land
College is a unique never-nevei
land where you are responsible
enough to chuck responsibility
and go have some fun. Ah whal
memories: the weekend trip t(
the Grand Canyon just to see i
you could make it there and bacl
in time for Monday mornin)
classes, the midnight bull sessioi
that spontaneously decided t<
take off for the beach, the nigh
Trancos was attacked by wate
balloons catapulted over fron
Toyon, and of course thosi
pinball marathons.
College is also a place when
you go through a lot of shit am
end up laughing about it. Then
were those immortal all-nighters
doggedly pursued as a pape
deadline comes screaming over th
early morning horizon. Then, th
next day, feeling totally depravei
and wretched, you sullenly ham

your masterpiece to a knowing
professor.
Then there are those
unforgettable finals weeks when
everybody goes bananas from the
pressure. You could just sense the
tension built up in everyone from
too many non-stop hours spent
over books. The release is
infectious and utterly comic.
Dinner-time chatter during finals
weeks is twice the normal volume.
Everything becomes funny.
People will sit around in the halls
and laugh at the most trite things.
"What did the penquin yell as he
fell out of his boat?" went one
joke. "Radio!" We never laughed
so hard, fifteen minutes straight.
Water Fight
I remember the night a physics
major figured out a way to turn
off all the dorm lights and a wild
water fight engulfed all three
floors. The topper was the night
we filled someone's room almost
to the ceiling with scores of
scrunched up Chicago Tribunes.
The janitors hated us for that
prank.
The authorities did not cotton
to our political activism much
either. Protest was a way of life
and lent college a special
excitement.
Each spring we braced for the
annual rite of dissidence. And in
1970, it hit the hardest, just
before I transferred to Stanford.
What an initiation for a freshman.
I remember the whole dorm
packed into the lounge to watch
Nixon announce the invasion of
Cambodia. The next thing I
remember was the thousands of
demonstrators marching across
campus. I remember the night the
guard moved in and imposed a
seven-thirty curfew. Suddenly we
were rushing to close the dorm
windows and jamming wet rags
under our doors to keep the tear
gas out. That was the night we
thought the revolution had
started.
Sit-In
Then there was that incredible
night six thousand students sat in
on the president's lawn and
demanded he close the school.
When he terminated classes a
month early they went into
pandamonium. What a night it
was. Thousands streamed into the
main street of nearby Carbondale
singing, dancing, uncorking rivers
of wine and openly smoking
marijuana.
Politics permeated all aspects
of college life in those years. The
usual penny pinching of students
buffeted by high tuition was
romanticized into a political
anti-materialistic dialectic. Even
the more affluent students joined
in, living meagerly for the sheer
adventure of it. Frayed shirts and
ragged pants were "cool" even if
you had to spend a weekend
running your new jeans through
the washer. What an
accomplishment it was to nurse a
pair of faded and patched trousers
into a life after death. The
romance of the open road
persuaded many to stick out a
thumb even though the bank
account back at school could well
afford a bus ticket.
Those were the years the
pre-meds were accused of being
hot reds instead of red hots and
talked about working in
community clinics instead of
tenth floor suites. Those were the
years when booking slacked off
and learning was more for its own
sake than the job waiting at the
other end.
Good Old Days
Those were the days when
smoking dope was more deviant
than chic. And when too many
people went over-board with
drugs. That was when a friend of
mine bought his first pair of
bell-bottoms and could still admit
"A year ago I resolved I would
never be caught dead in these
things." Those were the days of
Abbey Road, Iron Butterfly, anc"
Blood, Sweat, and Tears. Thos'
were the days. Those were thi
days.
If you are a
freshman right now, cheer up.
Look what you have to look
forward to. All too soon you will
be looking back and wistfully
whispering, "Those where the
days."

It was four years ago this week
that I first arrived on that
quadrennial island known as the
campus. That fall crispness was in
the air but instead of waiting for
the early morning school bus I
found myself part of a large
caravan of luggage strewn autos
streaming toward the dorms with
young fearful faces much like my
own curiously peering out at that
great unknown soon to be their
home.
I rushed up to room 104 and
was shocked. "I'm supposed to
live in this," I thought. "My
roommate," came to mind next.
"Will he be a dud or will we be
the best of friends?" My parents
helped me pile my junk in a neat

pile on my side of the room and
drove off as my mother made a
big scene with her tears,
embarrassing the hell out of me
right in front of all my future
peers.
I was left standing face to face
with the hollow dorm corridor
stretching out before me. There
was not a shred of familiarity to
be grasped and the emptiness set
in, tempered only by the
anticipation of this strange new
exciting place. For the first time
you are all alone. No family, no
friends. It is time to start anew.
That first week was about the
strangest I ever suffered through.
Thrown into a totally foreign
environment you witness the total

destruction of routine. The only
way to recover your equilibrium is
to undergo the pain of seven days
of awkwardness.
The Wrong Way
You usually start out by
getting in the lunch line and
realizing that everybody else is
moving toward you. Then you go
over to the Wilbur milk machines,
pull the whole milk lever and get a
cup of chocolate. But you're not
doing so bad. There was the kid
who thought he pushed the
ketchup button and got Pepsi all
over his lamb chop.
Next there is that obscenity
called "registration." It was a lot
more complicated four years ago
but it is still pure frustration.
"W's" do their thing from 11:00
til 11:45 but you walk in at noon
because you asked someone where
memorial something was and they
sent you to Memorial Church
when what you really wanted was
Memorial Auditorium. So you
hunt down the "LATES" table
and rush back to the dorm to find
out it is 1:05 and they stopped
serving lunch five minutes ago.
What a bitch.
The next day classes start. You
are on your way to a ten o'clock,
and stop a co-ed to ask where
Bishop auditorium is. She admits
she is a freshman too. So you grab
someone else. "Oh yeah, that's on
the other side of campus," he
says, sportingly. Headaches. You
start running in the direction he
pointed and at 10:10 rush into
the room panting like a dog only
to be greeted by a professor who
quips that you are not dressed for
jogging. A patient upper-classman
asks to see your schedule and
points out that your class meets
there on Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday and that today is Tuesday.
Hang In There
If you are a frosh, bear up. We
veterans look back on that harred

beginning with misty-eyed
amusement. The only real hassle is
in your mind. After my best
friend had finished his first day of
college I asked him "What is it
like?" He replied excitedly, "God
it is horrible. One guy already
jumped out his fourth floor dorm
window!" A month later I learned
that that guy had merely been
cleaning his window. "Well I
didn't say he hit the ground," my
friend retorted. Things get blown
up out of proportion that first
week. You learn to laugh it off.
But at times even this is hard.
At the end of your first class the
professor announces that "the
assignment for tomorrow is to
read chapters one through twelve
in Sorensen and pages 360
through 440 in Tinnerowitz."
That has a way of wiping the
smile off your face. So you repare
to the security of ... correction,
the insecurity of your dorm where
everyone is, amusingly leaving his
door wide open in a not too
subtle invitation for you to drop
in and get acquainted.
Ah yes. The freshman dorm.
No one should miss the
experience. It was invented by a
couple of psychologists who
decided to throw several score of
mixed-up floundering post
adolescents into close quarters,
give them the run of the place and
then watch what would happen. It
is literally "the blind leading the
blind" as someone once said.
"Weirdness," was the way I think
we described it.
The Dorm
The freshman dorm Is a nine
month sensitivity session. Friends
are close and so are acquaintances.
You know what Paul and Marty
are up to down the hall even if
you do not know them all that
well. In the adjustment from
parental authority to
self-sufficiency you lean on each
other without realizing it,
sometimes even knocking each
other down in the process.
All four years are much this
way, though not so intense. They
are a getting in touch with other's
ideas, lifestyles, and emotions.
They are a getting in touch with
oneself.
Perhaps more than anything
else college is remembered in
terms of the friends made there.
Few situations are more ideal
for fostering the growth of
friendships, be they deep or
shallow, sexual or platonic. A
campus is the coming together of
a group of people of the same age
and of similar interests, all of
whom are going through the same
unique, all-pervasive experience.
Wherever you go, interaction is
intense; from the dorm to the
classroom to extra-curricular
activities. A friend is never more
than fifteen minutes away and
usually is just down the hall.
These are the times when
schedules are flexible and leisure
time plentiful enough for a group
to do things together often.
Looking back now I lament the
transient nature of college
friendships. While friends were
plentiful, good friends were a
rarity. All too often best friends
one month went their separate
ways the next. Once out of
college too many people crawl
into their marraiges and lock out
the life outside them.

experience. It was invented by a
couple of psychologists who
decided to throw several score of
mixed-up floundering post
adolescents into close quarters,
give them the run of the place and
then watch what would happen. It
is literally "the blind leading the
blind" as someone once said.
"Weirdness," was the way I think
we described it.
The Dorm
The freshman dorm Is a nine
month sensitivity session. Friends
are close and so are acquaintances.
You know what Paul and Marty
are up to down the hall even if
you do not know them all that
well. In the adjustment from
parental authority to
self-sufficiency you lean on each
other without realizing it,
sometimes even knocking each
other down in the process.
All four years are much this
way, though not so intense. They
are a getting in touch with other's
ideas, lifestyles, and emotions.
They are a getting in touch with
oneself.
Perhaps more than anything
else college is remembered in
terms of the friends made there.
Few situations are more ideal
for fostering the growth of
friendships, be they deep or
shallow, sexual or platonic. A
campus is the coming together of
a group of people of the same age
and of similar interests, all of
whom are going through the same
unique, all-pervasive experience.
Wherever you go, interaction is
intense; from the dorm to the
classroom to extra-curricular
activities. A friend is never more
than fifteen minutes away and
usually is just down the hall.
These are the times when
schedules are flexible and leisure
time plentiful enough for a group
to do things together often.
Looking back now I lament the
transient nature of college
friendships. While friends were
plentiful, good friends were a
rarity. All too often best friends
one month went their separate
ways the next. Once out of
college too many people crawl
into their marraiges and lock out
the life outside them.
Looking back now, these were
four years I wish were twenty. As
I review the past and ponder the
future I come to believe what 1
once scorned as parental banality:
"Your college years will be the
best years of your life."
Never-Never Land
College is a unique never-nevei
land where you are responsible
enough to chuck responsibility
and go have some fun. Ah whal
memories: the weekend trip t(
the Grand Canyon just to see i
you could make it there and bacl
in time for Monday mornin)
classes, the midnight bull sessioi
that spontaneously decided t<
take off for the beach, the nigh
Trancos was attacked by wate
balloons catapulted over fron
Toyon, and of course thosi
pinball marathons.
College is also a place when
you go through a lot of shit am
end up laughing about it. Then
were those immortal all-nighters
doggedly pursued as a pape
deadline comes screaming over th
early morning horizon. Then, th
next day, feeling totally depravei
and wretched, you sullenly ham

your masterpiece to a knowing
professor.
Then there are those
unforgettable finals weeks when
everybody goes bananas from the
pressure. You could just sense the
tension built up in everyone from
too many non-stop hours spent
over books. The release is
infectious and utterly comic.
Dinner-time chatter during finals
weeks is twice the normal volume.
Everything becomes funny.
People will sit around in the halls
and laugh at the most trite things.
"What did the penquin yell as he
fell out of his boat?" went one
joke. "Radio!" We never laughed
so hard, fifteen minutes straight.
Water Fight
I remember the night a physics
major figured out a way to turn
off all the dorm lights and a wild
water fight engulfed all three
floors. The topper was the night
we filled someone's room almost
to the ceiling with scores of
scrunched up Chicago Tribunes.
The janitors hated us for that
prank.
The authorities did not cotton
to our political activism much
either. Protest was a way of life
and lent college a special
excitement.
Each spring we braced for the
annual rite of dissidence. And in
1970, it hit the hardest, just
before I transferred to Stanford.
What an initiation for a freshman.
I remember the whole dorm
packed into the lounge to watch
Nixon announce the invasion of
Cambodia. The next thing I
remember was the thousands of
demonstrators marching across
campus. I remember the night the
guard moved in and imposed a
seven-thirty curfew. Suddenly we
were rushing to close the dorm
windows and jamming wet rags
under our doors to keep the tear
gas out. That was the night we
thought the revolution had
started.
Sit-In
Then there was that incredible
night six thousand students sat in
on the president's lawn and
demanded he close the school.
When he terminated classes a
month early they went into
pandamonium. What a night it
was. Thousands streamed into the
main street of nearby Carbondale
singing, dancing, uncorking rivers
of wine and openly smoking
marijuana.
Politics permeated all aspects
of college life in those years. The
usual penny pinching of students
buffeted by high tuition was
romanticized into a political
anti-materialistic dialectic. Even
the more affluent students joined
in, living meagerly for the sheer
adventure of it. Frayed shirts and
ragged pants were "cool" even if
you had to spend a weekend
running your new jeans through
the washer. What an
accomplishment it was to nurse a
pair of faded and patched trousers
into a life after death. The
romance of the open road
persuaded many to stick out a
thumb even though the bank
account back at school could well
afford a bus ticket.
Those were the years the
pre-meds were accused of being
hot reds instead of red hots and
talked about working in
community clinics instead of
tenth floor suites. Those were the
years when booking slacked off
and learning was more for its own
sake than the job waiting at the
other end.
Good Old Days
Those were the days when
smoking dope was more deviant
than chic. And when too many
people went over-board with
drugs. That was when a friend of
mine bought his first pair of
bell-bottoms and could still admit
"A year ago I resolved I would
never be caught dead in these
things." Those were the days of
Abbey Road, Iron Butterfly, anc"
Blood, Sweat, and Tears. Thos'
were the days. Those were thi
days.
If you are a
freshman right now, cheer up.
Look what you have to look
forward to. All too soon you will
be looking back and wistfully
whispering, "Those where the
days."

It was four years ago this week
that I first arrived on that
quadrennial island known as the
campus. That fall crispness was in
the air but instead of waiting for
the early morning school bus I
found myself part of a large
caravan of luggage strewn autos
streaming toward the dorms with
young fearful faces much like my
own curiously peering out at that
great unknown soon to be their
home.
I rushed up to room 104 and
was shocked. "I'm supposed to
live in this," I thought. "My
roommate," came to mind next.
"Will he be a dud or will we be
the best of friends?" My parents
helped me pile my junk in a neat

pile on my side of the room and
drove off as my mother made a
big scene with her tears,
embarrassing the hell out of me
right in front of all my future
peers.
I was left standing face to face
with the hollow dorm corridor
stretching out before me. There
was not a shred of familiarity to
be grasped and the emptiness set
in, tempered only by the
anticipation of this strange new
exciting place. For the first time
you are all alone. No family, no
friends. It is time to start anew.
That first week was about the
strangest I ever suffered through.
Thrown into a totally foreign
environment you witness the total

destruction of routine. The only
way to recover your equilibrium is
to undergo the pain of seven days
of awkwardness.
The Wrong Way
You usually start out by
getting in the lunch line and
realizing that everybody else is
moving toward you. Then you go
over to the Wilbur milk machines,
pull the whole milk lever and get a
cup of chocolate. But you're not
doing so bad. There was the kid
who thought he pushed the
ketchup button and got Pepsi all
over his lamb chop.
Next there is that obscenity
called "registration." It was a lot
more complicated four years ago
but it is still pure frustration.
"W's" do their thing from 11:00
til 11:45 but you walk in at noon
because you asked someone where
memorial something was and they
sent you to Memorial Church
when what you really wanted was
Memorial Auditorium. So you
hunt down the "LATES" table
and rush back to the dorm to find
out it is 1:05 and they stopped
serving lunch five minutes ago.
What a bitch.
The next day classes start. You
are on your way to a ten o'clock,
and stop a co-ed to ask where
Bishop auditorium is. She admits
she is a freshman too. So you grab
someone else. "Oh yeah, that's on
the other side of campus," he
says, sportingly. Headaches. You
start running in the direction he
pointed and at 10:10 rush into
the room panting like a dog only
to be greeted by a professor who
quips that you are not dressed for
jogging. A patient upper-classman
asks to see your schedule and
points out that your class meets
there on Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday and that today is Tuesday.
Hang In There
If you are a frosh, bear up. We
veterans look back on that harred

beginning with misty-eyed
amusement. The only real hassle is
in your mind. After my best
friend had finished his first day of
college I asked him "What is it
like?" He replied excitedly, "God
it is horrible. One guy already
jumped out his fourth floor dorm
window!" A month later I learned
that that guy had merely been
cleaning his window. "Well I
didn't say he hit the ground," my
friend retorted. Things get blown
up out of proportion that first
week. You learn to laugh it off.
But at times even this is hard.
At the end of your first class the
professor announces that "the
assignment for tomorrow is to
read chapters one through twelve
in Sorensen and pages 360
through 440 in Tinnerowitz."
That has a way of wiping the
smile off your face. So you repare
to the security of ... correction,
the insecurity of your dorm where
everyone is, amusingly leaving his
door wide open in a not too
subtle invitation for you to drop
in and get acquainted.
Ah yes. The freshman dorm.
No one should miss the
experience. It was invented by a
couple of psychologists who
decided to throw several score of
mixed-up floundering post
