# Disturbing Annual Report
## Cal Faces Costly Problems 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - The
University of California at
Berkeley's annual "state of the
campus" report Friday to UC
Regents included two disturbing
and potentially costly items
among the encouraging notes.
Chancellor Albert H. Bowker's
report, presented at the regular
monthly regents' meeting,
contained warnings that
potentially costly problems plague
the Berkeley library system and
other buildings on the Berkeley
campus.
Vice Chancellor Mark
Christensen, presenting part of the
report, said the library crisis,
caused in part by inflation and

devaluation, could not be
estimated in dollars.
And Vice Chancellor of
Administration Robert Kerley,
talking about the physical plant,
said at least $80 million would be
needed to bring campus buildings
up to earthquake safety codes and
much more would be needed to
simply repair "the physical plant
which has been seriously eroded."
Bowker noted that "Berkeley's
continuing strong drawing power"
was evident in a 10 percent
increase in students seeking
admission.
He said figures also show the
lowest rate of tenured resignations

in the last decade. Additionally,
he noted that in the last 10 years,
faculty salaries have risen 40
percent, but the cost per degree
has risen only 22 percent. "Thus
18 percent of the increased salary
cost... has been absorbed by the
Berkeley faculty in higher degree
productivity."
Christensen, however, was less
enthusiastic when he spoke about
the main campus library which
"became full in 1966. Since that
time, for every volume added we
have had to transfer a volume to a
storage facility in Richmond. It is
just not possible to provide good,
economical services within the
layout of the present building."

He said a new library building
is almost a necessity.
He said while use of library
services rose 13 percent last year,
the library staff was reduced
because of the budget crisis. He
also said the cost of valuable
magazines has increased as much
as 43 percent in some cases,
forcing the university to halt such
purchases.
Kerley said the amount of
floor space in Berkeley's academic
buildings is seven million square
feet and "40 percent of that area
was built before 1933," when new
earthquake-safety laws were
passed. Additional laws were
passed in 1971, after the San
Fernando earthquake.
"In short, 40 percent of
Berkeley's physical plant is two
laws behind," Kerley said. He said
the replacement value of the
buildings was $600 million.
He also told regents that the $2
million the Berkeley campus now
receives for building maintenance
is about one-third of what the
university president's office study
says is needed and only about 10
percent of what some industrial
standards indicate should be the
figure.
"A good definition of
maintenance is doing on time
those things which keep a building
in the condition it was in when
built," he said. "We need ... $6
million to keep things in shape
once we get them in shape."
