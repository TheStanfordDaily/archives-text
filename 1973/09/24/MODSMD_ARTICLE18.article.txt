# Chino Escape Case
## Burts Convicted Of Murder 
### TERRY ANZUR 
The murder trial of Andrea
Holman Burt, daughter of
Medicine Prof. Halsted Holman,
and her husband, Benton Douglas
Burt ended July 18 when a San
Bernardino County jury found the
couple guilty of second-degree
murder, assault with a deadly
weapon, and rescuing a prisoner.
Judge Thomas Haldorsen
sentenced the couple to five years
to life in prison on Sept. 7.
The charges against the Burts
stemmed from convict Ronald
Wayne Beaty's Oct. 6 escape from
the California Institution for Men
at Chino.
According to testimony, four
ambushers waylaid a state Car
carrying Beaty to a court hearing
in San Bernardino, freed him, and
forced the two unarmed guards
into the back seat. One ambusher
then fired two shots point-blank
at the guards, killing one and
wounding the other.
State's Evidence
Police recaptured Beaty on the
Oakland Bay Bridge nearly two
months after his escape. He
received a life sentence after
pleading guilty to the murder of
the guard and turned state's
evidence, providing the
prosecution's most damaging
testimony against the Burts.
During the trial, defense
attorney Charles Garry repeatedly
assailed Beaty's credibility,
eliciting from Beaty that an
admission that he "didn't tell the
complete truth" when testifying
before a county grand jury
investigating the escape.
The Burts surrendered to
authorities Oct. 23 in the Menlo
Park office of attorney Tom
Nolan after learning of a warrant
for their arrest in connection with
the escape.
They denied any involvement
in a conspiracy to free Beaty, and
defense witnesses testified that
the Burts were in Hayward at the
time of the escape. Prosecution
witnesses, however, corroborated
Beaty's statements placing the
Burts at the ambush site.
Deputy District Attorney
Joseph D. Canty contended that
the Burts could be convicted of
murder for their part in a
conspiracy to free Beaty even
though they did not actually fire
the shots that killed guard Jesus
Sanchez.
Parole
The couple will be eligible for
parole in 20 months. Haldorsen
also gave them credit for time

spent in custody before and
during the trial.
The trial judge struck the jury's
finding that the Burts were armed
at the scene of the escape, citing
insufficient evidence on that
count. That element of the
conviction would have doubled
the 20-month minimum time
parole eligibility.
In sentencing both defendants
to the full adult term for
second-degree murder, Haldorsen
rejected without comment an
alternative that would have
allowed Andrea Burt to be eligible
for parole in six months, under a
state law applying to persons
under 25 years old.
Referring to "numerous letters
written by obviously very
intelligent and very good people"
on her behalf, Haldorsen
commented, "Of all the
defendants I've seen, none have
had the talent and capability this
defendant has."
He also lamented her
involvement in the case. "It really
is a sad and tragic thing, but as I
indicated, the death of Sanchez
was also an extremely tragic and
unfortunate thing."
No New Trial
At the same Sept. 7 hearing,
Haldorsen denied Garry's motion
for a new trial. The defense
motion charged that one juror was
prejudiced against the defendants
because of their politics and that
other jurors had allowed
newspaper or other outside
accounts of the trial to influence
their verdict.
Andrea Burt is a member of
Venceremos, the Peninsula-based
revolutionary organization. In
response to Garry's questions
during a hearing on the new trial
motion, 77 year-old juror Thomas
Gavlin admitted that he was
finally convinced of the Burts'
guilt after Garry referred to
Venceremos in his closing
argument.
Halsted Holman, Andrea Burt's
father, said neither he nor the
Burts were surprised by the
sentence and the failure of the
motion for the new trial.
Holman added that the defense
would certainly appeal the ruling.
"I've been told the appeal would
take us two or three months to
file," he said.
High Security
Andrea Burt is serving her
sentence in - Frontera, . the
California Institution for Women
near Chino, where she is confined
in a high security psychotherapy

unit. Her mother explained that
her daughter's psychotherapy
(PTU) group includes former
mental hospital patients. <4 They
play games with them in there,"
she said, referring to encounter
groups and other programs for
PTU inmates.
Although Andrea Burt is
reportedly in good mental health,
she must remain in the PTU
because the Frontera facility is
the only women's detention
center in the state prison system.
Doug Burt is being held in the
Reception and Guidance facility
at Vacaville. Authorities feared
that Burt would be in danger if
assigned to CIM, due to possible
reactions from many prisoners
there who knew the slain guard.

A bill under consideration in
the state Assembly would
reimburse San Bernardino County
for the $500,000 it spent on the
61-day trial. Assembly Bill 2573,
proposed by Assemblyman John
Quimby, R-San Bernardino,
would extend the bill under which
the state reimbursed Santa Clara
County for the trials of Angela
Davis and Ruchell Magee.
A committee hearing on the
measure scheduled for Sept. 4 has
been postponed until January, at
Garry's request. Barbara
Hofmeister, spokesman for the
Chino Defense Committee,
explained that Garry would fight
the measure on grounds that the
county expended funds for items
that created a "police-state
atmosphere" at the trial.

authorities Oct. 23 in the Menlo
Park office of attorney Tom
Nolan after learning of a warrant
for their arrest in connection with
the escape.
They denied any involvement
in a conspiracy to free Beaty, and
defense witnesses testified that
the Burts were in Hayward at the
time of the escape. Prosecution
witnesses, however, corroborated
Beaty's statements placing the
Burts at the ambush site.
Deputy District Attorney
Joseph D. Canty contended that
the Burts could be convicted of
murder for their part in a
conspiracy to free Beaty even
though they did not actually fire
the shots that killed guard Jesus
Sanchez.
Parole
The couple will be eligible for
parole in 20 months. Haldorsen
also gave them credit for time

spent in custody before and
during the trial.
The trial judge struck the jury's
finding that the Burts were armed
at the scene of the escape, citing
insufficient evidence on that
count. That element of the
conviction would have doubled
the 20-month minimum time
parole eligibility.
In sentencing both defendants
to the full adult term for
second-degree murder, Haldorsen
rejected without comment an
alternative that would have
allowed Andrea Burt to be eligible
for parole in six months, under a
state law applying to persons
under 25 years old.
Referring to "numerous letters
written by obviously very
intelligent and very good people"
on her behalf, Haldorsen
commented, "Of all the
defendants I've seen, none have
had the talent and capability this
defendant has."
He also lamented her
involvement in the case. "It really
is a sad and tragic thing, but as I
indicated, the death of Sanchez
was also an extremely tragic and
unfortunate thing."
No New Trial
At the same Sept. 7 hearing,
Haldorsen denied Garry's motion
for a new trial. The defense
motion charged that one juror was
prejudiced against the defendants
because of their politics and that
other jurors had allowed
newspaper or other outside
accounts of the trial to influence
their verdict.
Andrea Burt is a member of
Venceremos, the Peninsula-based
revolutionary organization. In
response to Garry's questions
during a hearing on the new trial
motion, 77 year-old juror Thomas
Gavlin admitted that he was
finally convinced of the Burts'
guilt after Garry referred to
Venceremos in his closing
argument.
Halsted Holman, Andrea Burt's
father, said neither he nor the
Burts were surprised by the
sentence and the failure of the
motion for the new trial.
Holman added that the defense
would certainly appeal the ruling.
"I've been told the appeal would
take us two or three months to
file," he said.
High Security
Andrea Burt is serving her
sentence in - Frontera, . the
California Institution for Women
near Chino, where she is confined
in a high security psychotherapy

unit. Her mother explained that
her daughter's psychotherapy
(PTU) group includes former
mental hospital patients. <4 They
play games with them in there,"
she said, referring to encounter
groups and other programs for
PTU inmates.
Although Andrea Burt is
reportedly in good mental health,
she must remain in the PTU
because the Frontera facility is
the only women's detention
center in the state prison system.
Doug Burt is being held in the
Reception and Guidance facility
at Vacaville. Authorities feared
that Burt would be in danger if
assigned to CIM, due to possible
reactions from many prisoners
there who knew the slain guard.

Judge Thomas Haldorsen
sentenced the couple to five years
to life in prison on Sept. 7.
The charges against the Burts
stemmed from convict Ronald
Wayne Beaty's Oct. 6 escape from
the California Institution for Men
at Chino.
According to testimony, four
ambushers waylaid a state Car
carrying Beaty to a court hearing
in San Bernardino, freed him, and
forced the two unarmed guards
into the back seat. One ambusher
then fired two shots point-blank
at the guards, killing one and
wounding the other.
State's Evidence
Police recaptured Beaty on the
Oakland Bay Bridge nearly two
months after his escape. He
received a life sentence after
pleading guilty to the murder of
the guard and turned state's
evidence, providing the
prosecution's most damaging
testimony against the Burts.
During the trial, defense
attorney Charles Garry repeatedly
assailed Beaty's credibility,
eliciting from Beaty that an
admission that he "didn't tell the

investigating the escape.

defendants I've seen, none have
had the talent and capability this
defendant has."
He also lamented her
involvement in the case. "It really
is a sad and tragic thing, but as I
indicated, the death of Sanchez
was also an extremely tragic and
unfortunate thing."
No New Trial
At the same Sept. 7 hearing,
Haldorsen denied Garry's motion
for a new trial. The defense
motion charged that one juror was
prejudiced against the defendants
because of their politics and that
other jurors had allowed
newspaper or other outside
accounts of the trial to influence
their verdict.
Andrea Burt is a member of
Venceremos, the Peninsula-based
revolutionary organization. In
response to Garry's questions
during a hearing on the new trial
motion, 77 year-old juror Thomas
Gavlin admitted that he was
finally convinced of the Burts'
guilt after Garry referred to
Venceremos in his closing
argument.
Halsted Holman, Andrea Burt's
father, said neither he nor the
Burts were surprised by the
sentence and the failure of the
motion for the new trial.
Holman added that the defense
would certainly appeal the ruling.
"I've been told the appeal would
take us two or three months to
file," he said.
High Security
Andrea Burt is serving her
sentence in - Frontera, . the
California Institution for Women
near Chino, where she is confined
in a high security psychotherapy

unit. Her mother explained that
her daughter's psychotherapy
(PTU) group includes former
mental hospital patients. <4 They
play games with them in there,"
she said, referring to encounter
groups and other programs for
PTU inmates.
Although Andrea Burt is
reportedly in good mental health,
she must remain in the PTU
because the Frontera facility is
the only women's detention
center in the state prison system.
Doug Burt is being held in the
Reception and Guidance facility
at Vacaville. Authorities feared
that Burt would be in danger if
assigned to CIM, due to possible
reactions from many prisoners
there who knew the slain guard.

A bill under consideration in
the state Assembly would
reimburse San Bernardino County
for the $500,000 it spent on the
61-day trial. Assembly Bill 2573,
proposed by Assemblyman John
Quimby, R-San Bernardino,
would extend the bill under which
the state reimbursed Santa Clara
County for the trials of Angela
Davis and Ruchell Magee.
A committee hearing on the
measure scheduled for Sept. 4 has
been postponed until January, at
Garry's request. Barbara
Hofmeister, spokesman for the
Chino Defense Committee,
explained that Garry would fight
the measure on grounds that the
county expended funds for items
that created a "police-state
atmosphere" at the trial.

The murder trial of Andrea
Holman Burt, daughter of
Medicine Prof. Halsted Holman,
and her husband, Benton Douglas
Burt ended July 18 when a San
Bernardino County jury found the
couple guilty of second-degree
murder, assault with a deadly
weapon, and rescuing a prisoner.
Judge Thomas Haldorsen
sentenced the couple to five years
to life in prison on Sept. 7.
The charges against the Burts
stemmed from convict Ronald
Wayne Beaty's Oct. 6 escape from
the California Institution for Men
at Chino.
According to testimony, four
ambushers waylaid a state Car
carrying Beaty to a court hearing
in San Bernardino, freed him, and
forced the two unarmed guards
into the back seat. One ambusher
then fired two shots point-blank
at the guards, killing one and
wounding the other.
State's Evidence
Police recaptured Beaty on the
Oakland Bay Bridge nearly two
months after his escape. He
received a life sentence after
pleading guilty to the murder of
the guard and turned state's
evidence, providing the
prosecution's most damaging
testimony against the Burts.
During the trial, defense
attorney Charles Garry repeatedly
assailed Beaty's credibility,
eliciting from Beaty that an
admission that he "didn't tell the
complete truth" when testifying
before a county grand jury
investigating the escape.
The Burts surrendered to
authorities Oct. 23 in the Menlo
Park office of attorney Tom
Nolan after learning of a warrant
for their arrest in connection with
the escape.
They denied any involvement
in a conspiracy to free Beaty, and
defense witnesses testified that
the Burts were in Hayward at the
time of the escape. Prosecution
witnesses, however, corroborated
Beaty's statements placing the
Burts at the ambush site.
Deputy District Attorney
Joseph D. Canty contended that
the Burts could be convicted of
murder for their part in a
conspiracy to free Beaty even
though they did not actually fire
the shots that killed guard Jesus
Sanchez.
Parole
The couple will be eligible for
parole in 20 months. Haldorsen
also gave them credit for time

spent in custody before and
during the trial.
The trial judge struck the jury's
finding that the Burts were armed
at the scene of the escape, citing
insufficient evidence on that
count. That element of the
conviction would have doubled
the 20-month minimum time
parole eligibility.
In sentencing both defendants
to the full adult term for
second-degree murder, Haldorsen
rejected without comment an
alternative that would have
allowed Andrea Burt to be eligible
for parole in six months, under a
state law applying to persons
under 25 years old.
Referring to "numerous letters
written by obviously very
intelligent and very good people"
on her behalf, Haldorsen
commented, "Of all the
defendants I've seen, none have
had the talent and capability this
defendant has."
He also lamented her
involvement in the case. "It really
is a sad and tragic thing, but as I
indicated, the death of Sanchez
was also an extremely tragic and
