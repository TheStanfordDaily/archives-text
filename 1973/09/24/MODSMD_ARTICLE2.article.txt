# Mahoney, Roy den To New Posts

### 
University officials filled two
administration vacancies in early
September by announcing the
appointments of former Faculty
Senate Chairman Halsey L. Royden as
dean of the School of Humanities and
Sciences and Associate Provost Sally
Mahoney as University registrar.
Royden is the new head of the
University's largest school, whose 32
departments and major programs
enroll 80 percent of the University's
undergraduates and more than a
quarter of its graduates.
As dean, Royden will be involved in
a number of academic policy
decisions. He will oversee the
appointments process for the
approximately 35 faculty positions
filled each year and the budgeting
process for all departments and
programs.
Royden, who has served as
associate dean and acting dean of
Humanities and Sciences, said one of
his major goals is to facilitate faculty
organization of programs which would
emphasize a structured liberal
education.
He is already part of one such
program, organized by History Prof.
Mark Mancall, in which he plans to
teach a course on Greek mathematics
next fall.
Baby With The Bath
"I felt at the time of the Study of
Education at Stanford [SES] that in
changing the old general study
requirements — which were much too
rigid and some of which were
inappropriate — we were throwing the
baby out with the bath water. Instead
of designing an appropriate system of
education, we decided to have no
system at all," said Royden.
"I do detect among the more
thoughtful students a desire for more
substance, more structure in their
education. I think their mood is very
much more in sympathy with serious
educational activity than it's been for
a long time," Royden said.
A mathematician, Royden has been
researching the functions of complex
variables since he came to Stanford in
1951 after completing a Ph.D. at
Harvard. His work earned him a
Guggenheim fellowship for advanced
study last year.
Administration First To Go
"I certainly don't intend to give up
either teaching or research; I'll give up
administration first," said Royden of
his appointment.
"I really look upon myself as a
somewhat unfortunate faculty
member doing a job I wish someone
else were doing. But I think it's
important that it be done by a faculty
member and I am depending on the
support of the faculty," he added.
Mahoney, who from 1964-69
served as residence director, assistant
and then associate dean of students,
was named assistant provost and
director of the summer session in 1970
and was promoted to associate provost
last year.
She noted the need of academic
policies to be administered "with
fairness and attention to their
implications over time."
Insure Privacy
"Clearly, as we move into an era of
sophisticated technical systems, we
have an obligation to insure the
privacy of student records," she
observed.
As registrar, Mahoney is a member
of the Academic Council and is
responsible for administering academic
policy and regulations in areas of
academic appraisal and accreditation.

1951 after completing a Ph.D. at
Harvard. His work earned him a
Guggenheim fellowship for advanced
study last year.
Administration First To Go
"I certainly don't intend to give up
either teaching or research; I'll give up
administration first," said Royden of
his appointment.
"I really look upon myself as a
somewhat unfortunate faculty
member doing a job I wish someone
else were doing. But I think it's
important that it be done by a faculty
member and I am depending on the
support of the faculty," he added.
Mahoney, who from 1964-69
served as residence director, assistant
and then associate dean of students,
was named assistant provost and
director of the summer session in 1970
and was promoted to associate provost
last year.
She noted the need of academic
policies to be administered "with
fairness and attention to their
implications over time."
Insure Privacy
"Clearly, as we move into an era of
sophisticated technical systems, we
have an obligation to insure the
privacy of student records," she
observed.
As registrar, Mahoney is a member
of the Academic Council and is
responsible for administering academic
policy and regulations in areas of
academic appraisal and accreditation.
University officials filled two
administration vacancies in early
September by announcing the
appointments of former Faculty
Senate Chairman Halsey L. Royden as
dean of the School of Humanities and
Sciences and Associate Provost Sally
Mahoney as University registrar.
Royden is the new head of the
University's largest school, whose 32
departments and major programs
enroll 80 percent of the University's
undergraduates and more than a
quarter of its graduates.
As dean, Royden will be involved in
a number of academic policy
decisions. He will oversee the
appointments process for the
approximately 35 faculty positions
filled each year and the budgeting
process for all departments and
programs.
Royden, who has served as
associate dean and acting dean of
Humanities and Sciences, said one of
his major goals is to facilitate faculty
organization of programs which would
emphasize a structured liberal
education.
He is already part of one such
program, organized by History Prof.
Mark Mancall, in which he plans to
teach a course on Greek mathematics
next fall.
Baby With The Bath
"I felt at the time of the Study of
Education at Stanford [SES] that in
changing the old general study
requirements — which were much too
rigid and some of which were
inappropriate — we were throwing the
baby out with the bath water. Instead
of designing an appropriate system of
education, we decided to have no
system at all," said Royden.
"I do detect among the more
thoughtful students a desire for more
substance, more structure in their
education. I think their mood is very
much more in sympathy with serious
educational activity than it's been for
a long time," Royden said.
A mathematician, Royden has been
researching the functions of complex
variables since he came to Stanford in
1951 after completing a Ph.D. at
Harvard. His work earned him a
Guggenheim fellowship for advanced
study last year.
