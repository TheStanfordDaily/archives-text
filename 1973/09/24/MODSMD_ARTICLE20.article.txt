# Albert Defends Congress' Record
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Speaker Carl Albert defended
Congress' legislative record
yesterday and said President
Nixon's criticism of it was an
attempt to obscure the
administration's own failures.
In a nationwide radio address
responding to Nixon's latest
attack, Albert said Congress has
compiled an impressive record so
far this year and will improve on
it before adjourning.
"The President does not have a
monopoly on wisdom or on a
commitment to serve the nation's
business," said Albert. "Congress
is doing and will continue to do
its part in moving the legislative
program forward."
Albert's speech was the
Democrats' reply to a second
State of the Union message by
Nixon Sept. 10. Nixon preceded
delivery of his written message to
Congress with a nationwide radio
broadcast.
In his message, Nixon said
Congress' performance was
disappointing, particularly in
regard to 50 measures proposed
by the administration.
Albert said 40 of the 50
priority items were already in the
legislative process when Nixon set
up the message and that half of
them have passed one or both
houses of Congress. And the
message itself, he said, "contained
an embarrassing lack of new
initiatives."
It is Congress that has taken
the lead, Albert said, in trying to

deal with the major problems
facing the nation in the areas of
the economy, health, energy and
crime.
"Congress granted the
President some of the most
sweeping economic powers a
Congress can confer upon a
President," he said. "Because the
President was slow to act, the cost
of living is up 8 percent compared
with 3.4 percent for all of 1972."
The administration's shifts
from control to decontrol to
recontrol of prices have provided
no relief from inflation, Albert
said, and price increases are now
plaguing nearly every American
family.
"Congress has helped by
increasing Social Security
benefits, expanding farm
production to eliminate shortages
and guaranteeing children a hot
nutritious meal at school," he
said.
And it is Congress, not Nixon,
he said, that is doing something
effective about holding down
federal spending.
"Congress has cut President
Nixon's budget requests by more
than $20 billion over the past four
years," he said. "Despite that, the
President's first four budgets
added an incredible $97 billion to
the national debt. That totals up
to 20 percent of the national debt
accumulated in just four years."
In its efforts to provide health
care services for the nation, Albert
said, Congress has been thwarted
by Presidential vetoes and budget
cutbacks.

cutbacks.
WASHINGTON (AP) -
Speaker Carl Albert defended
Congress' legislative record
yesterday and said President
Nixon's criticism of it was an
attempt to obscure the
administration's own failures.
In a nationwide radio address
responding to Nixon's latest
attack, Albert said Congress has
compiled an impressive record so
far this year and will improve on
it before adjourning.
"The President does not have a
monopoly on wisdom or on a
commitment to serve the nation's
business," said Albert. "Congress
is doing and will continue to do
its part in moving the legislative
program forward."
Albert's speech was the
Democrats' reply to a second
State of the Union message by
Nixon Sept. 10. Nixon preceded
delivery of his written message to
Congress with a nationwide radio
broadcast.
In his message, Nixon said
Congress' performance was
disappointing, particularly in
regard to 50 measures proposed
by the administration.
Albert said 40 of the 50
priority items were already in the
legislative process when Nixon set
up the message and that half of
them have passed one or both
houses of Congress. And the
message itself, he said, "contained
an embarrassing lack of new
initiatives."
It is Congress that has taken
the lead, Albert said, in trying to

deal with the major problems
facing the nation in the areas of
the economy, health, energy and
crime.
"Congress granted the
President some of the most
sweeping economic powers a
Congress can confer upon a
President," he said. "Because the
President was slow to act, the cost
of living is up 8 percent compared
with 3.4 percent for all of 1972."
The administration's shifts
from control to decontrol to
recontrol of prices have provided
no relief from inflation, Albert
said, and price increases are now
plaguing nearly every American
family.
"Congress has helped by
increasing Social Security
benefits, expanding farm
production to eliminate shortages
and guaranteeing children a hot
nutritious meal at school," he
said.
And it is Congress, not Nixon,
he said, that is doing something
effective about holding down
federal spending.
"Congress has cut President
Nixon's budget requests by more
than $20 billion over the past four
years," he said. "Despite that, the
President's first four budgets
added an incredible $97 billion to
the national debt. That totals up
to 20 percent of the national debt
accumulated in just four years."

care services for the nation, Albert
said, Congress has been thwarted
