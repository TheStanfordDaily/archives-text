# Senate Considers Defense Budget
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)
President Nixon's pleas against
cuts in the military budget face
sharp tests in the Senate this week
on moves to cut U.S. forces
overseas and slow development of
the Trident submarine.
In his latest expression of
concern, Nixon said, "all of our
efforts to secure a more peaceful
and prosperous world will be
endangered if we unilaterally
erode our defense posture."
In a letter to Senate leaders,
released Saturday by the White
House, the President said current
efforts in Congress to reduce the
defense budget "are deeply
disturbing to me."
"There is no doubt in my mind
that a strong defense posture is
closely linked to the past success
and fiuture development of our
foreign policies," Nixon said.
The Senate is expected to work
all this coming week on a bill
authorizing $20.4 billion for
military procurement in the
current fiscal year.
House Action
The House, meanwhile, plans
to act on the second stop-gap
appropriation bill for the fiscal
year that started July 1. It
provides funding for federal
agencies.
Senate and House leaders are
still a talking about winding up
the session at the end of October.
For the seventh time this year,
congressional Democrats will try
to muster the two-thirds vote
needed to override a Nixon veto.
Disaster Relief Aid
The Senate has scheduled a

vote tomorrow afternoon on
overriding the veto of a bill
expanding federal disaster relief
aid by providing up to $2,500
that wouldn't have to be repaid.
The original bill passed the Senate
82 to 1 and the House by voice
vote.
The Senate Watergate
Committee resumes its inquiry
today into the June, 1972,
break-in at the Democratic
National Committee (see page
20).
The Senate plans to put the
military procurement bill aside for
several hours today to consider a
bill authorizing an additional
$129.5 million in federal subsidies
to meet rising costs in the school
lunch program.
Administration Opposition
Similar to a bill recently passed
by the House, it is opposed by the
Nixon administration.
Among military procurement
amendments due for Senate
consideration today is a proposal
by Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz.,
to authorize a study of possible
merger of the Air National Guard
and the Air Force Reserve.
Senate Democratic Leader
Mike Mansfield introduced a
proposal for a 50 percent
world-wide cut in overseas ground
forces on Saturday, and a vote
could come tomorrow.
A vote is likely Wednesday on
the amendment by Sen. Thomas
J. Mclntyre, D-N.H., to cut $885
million of the approximately $1.5
billion in the bill for the Trident,
an advanced missile-firing
submarine.
