WASHINGTON (AP) — Public suspicions about U.S. involvement
in the downfall of the Allende government are likely to preclude overt
displays of American friendship toward Chile's new military junta for
the foreseeable future.
This is the assessment of informed American officials, who admit
to a sense of frustration over the persistence of the charges of U.S.
complicity in the coup despite repeated official denials.
More than 15 countries have announced a renewal of relations with
Chile in the wake of the change of command in Santiago.
But the United States is not among them, notwithstanding the
ideological affinity between Washington and the junta's
anti-communist rulers.
Officials say, however, that an announcement of a "continuation
of relations" with Chile is expected shortly. There will be no
announcement of diplomatic recognition per se because this often is
interpreted as a gesture of approval of a new government, according to
officials.
For the future, Washington is expected to offer only modest
amounts of aid to Chile.
Among the reasons given is that the U.S. government, although
aware of Chile's need for substantial outside assistance, must keep its
profile down because of its continuing vulnerability to charges it
inspired the coup.
So persistent have these accusations been that some U.S. officials
say they find the coup more of an embarrassment than a political
plus.
At least a dozen senators and congressmen have expressed
skepticism over White House and State Department assertions of
non-involvement in the coup. There have been two calls for
congressional investigations of the U.S. activities in the days before
the takeover.
There have been charges that the Nixon administration provoked
the ouster of President Salvador Allende through a policy of economic
denial. The CIA was accused of financing a prolonged truckers' strike
that contributed heavily to Chile's economic disarray.
