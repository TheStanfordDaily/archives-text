# 'Big Brother' Threat Disputed

### 
VIENNA (AP) - Can a future
"Big Brother" government get all
the information on your private
life by merely pushing a button
and releasing the data which had
been collected by statisticians?
A leading American statistician
conceded there was concern about
such a possibility, but he added he
felt this was unfounded.
For one thing, the statisticians
would not go along with it.
William H. Kruskal, who is on
the faculty of the department of
statistics of the University of
Chicago, attended the recent
10-day session of the
International Statistical Institute
(ISI) here.
Though the problem of an
invasion of privacy for statistical
reasons was not a main topic of
the session, Kruskal reported
there was a lot of interest in it and
he discussed it with colleagues
from a number of countries.
"I think that many people have
fears about the future, especially
with increasing computerization,"
Kruskal said. He termed the fears

"science-fiction, '1984-kind of
fantasies,' " referring to the book
"1984" by George Orwell which
described a future "Big Brother"
government that spies on its
people through technological
devices.
Kruskal conceded that the
concern was not completely
unrealistic. He said:
"In the old-fashioned statistics,
where information was kept in file
folders in various offices, it would
have been a very difficult and
expensive job to accumulate a
dossier on a single person.
"Now in principle, if you have
computerization, you could do
what we call 'matching' or
'linkage' and put together various
pieces of information about the
same person."
Kruskal stressed that despite all
that, he thought it impossible that
any future "Big Brother"
government could use statistics to
invade the privacy of individuals.
"Statisticians working with
that kind of data would refuse to
cooperate, they understand the

civil liberty aspects of the
problem," he said.
Furthermore, in virtually every
Western country of the world,
there are studies and
recommendation to protect the
privacy of the people and
confidentiality of the information
of statistical surveys.
In the United States, for
instance, Kruskal said, there was
the recommendation that if
someone is asked a question as
part of a survey and is promised
confidentiality, the data he

provides should not be used for
any other purpose than he agreed
to.
Another recommendation was
that a citizen should be entitled to
see what is on the record on
himself, and correct it, or at least
be able to object to it, if he
disagrees.
Kruskal said the
understandable concern over an
invasion of privacy should not
obscure the benefits that can be
derived from statistical surveys.

same person."
Kruskal stressed that despite all
that, he thought it impossible that
any future "Big Brother"
government could use statistics to
invade the privacy of individuals.
"Statisticians working with
that kind of data would refuse to
cooperate, they understand the

civil liberty aspects of the
problem," he said.
Furthermore, in virtually every
Western country of the world,
there are studies and
recommendation to protect the
privacy of the people and
confidentiality of the information
of statistical surveys.
In the United States, for
instance, Kruskal said, there was
the recommendation that if
someone is asked a question as
part of a survey and is promised
confidentiality, the data he

provides should not be used for
any other purpose than he agreed
to.
Another recommendation was
that a citizen should be entitled to
see what is on the record on
himself, and correct it, or at least
be able to object to it, if he
disagrees.
Kruskal said the
understandable concern over an
invasion of privacy should not
obscure the benefits that can be
derived from statistical surveys.
VIENNA (AP) - Can a future
"Big Brother" government get all
the information on your private
life by merely pushing a button
and releasing the data which had
been collected by statisticians?
A leading American statistician
conceded there was concern about
such a possibility, but he added he
felt this was unfounded.
For one thing, the statisticians
would not go along with it.
William H. Kruskal, who is on
the faculty of the department of
statistics of the University of
Chicago, attended the recent
10-day session of the
International Statistical Institute
(ISI) here.
Though the problem of an
invasion of privacy for statistical
reasons was not a main topic of
the session, Kruskal reported
there was a lot of interest in it and
he discussed it with colleagues
from a number of countries.
"I think that many people have
fears about the future, especially
with increasing computerization,"
Kruskal said. He termed the fears

"science-fiction, '1984-kind of
fantasies,' " referring to the book
"1984" by George Orwell which
described a future "Big Brother"
government that spies on its
people through technological
devices.
Kruskal conceded that the
concern was not completely
unrealistic. He said:
"In the old-fashioned statistics,
where information was kept in file
folders in various offices, it would
have been a very difficult and
expensive job to accumulate a
dossier on a single person.
"Now in principle, if you have
computerization, you could do
what we call 'matching' or
'linkage' and put together various
pieces of information about the
same person."
Kruskal stressed that despite all
that, he thought it impossible that
any future "Big Brother"
government could use statistics to
invade the privacy of individuals.
