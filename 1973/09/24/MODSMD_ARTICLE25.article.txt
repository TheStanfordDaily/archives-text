Agnew 'Defends' Office
WASHINGTON — Vice President Spiro Agnew was
reported to be proceeding yesterday with plans to
"defend his constitutional office."
Two developments over the weekend indicated the vice
president intends to try to retain his office and fight
charges of political corruption.
Agnew will move in court this week to block a grand
jury investigation, sources close to the vice president
revealed Saturday. "He is going to defend his
constitutional office," Agnew's lawyer, Judah Best, was
quoted by WTTG-TV in Washington as saying.
This seemed to indicate that motions filed in behalf of
the vice president would argue" that he could not be
indicted without first being impeached and removed from
office.
Further evidence of Agnew's fighting mood was the
disclosure Saturday by an aide that "an Agnew defense
fund" is being organized.
Agnew has denied allegations growing out of a federal
grand jury probe in Baltimore that he took political
kickbacks for awarding construction contracts while he
was governor of Maryland and while he was a Baltimore
County executive.
In yesterday's editions, the Washington Post quoted
informed sources as saying that lawyers for Agnew and
Department of Justice officials are deadlocked in their
negotiations over Agnew's possible resignation and
acceptance of a guilty plea in the Maryland investigation.
The Post reported Saturday that Agnew's lawyers and
the department officials have been engaged in "delicate
negotiations" concerning a possible Agnew resignation to
be coupled with a guilty plea to a relatively minor offense.
Watergate Hearings Resume Today
WASHINGTON — Sen. Sam J. Ervin Jr. will bang his
gavel against the mahogany table in the huge Senate
Caucus Room today, resuming the Watergate hearings
that have been recessed since Aug. 7.
The committee has promised that the rest of the
hearings will be streamlined as compared with the first 37
days.
They'll run only three days a week instead of five. The
witness list has been culled to weed out minor testimony.
And there is a self-imposed deadline for winding it up —
Nov. 1.
Live television cameras will be on hand at least today,
tomorrow and Wednesday, with each of the three
commercial networks taking one day.
Peron Regains Presidency
BUENOS AIRES — Juan D. Peron was elected president
of Argentina again yesterday, 18 years after he was ousted
from power by a military coup.
His running mate and wife, Isabel, will become the first
woman vice president in Latin American history. The
Perons will take office Oct. 12.
Screaming, cheering crowds gathered at the Plaza de
Mayo to celebrate at the same spot where hundreds died
in bombing that started the three-month coup in 1955.
Official returns showed that the Perons were assured of
a majority well over the 50 percent needed to win without
a run-off election.
The victory culminates one of the most spectacular
political comebacks in memory, as the former Argentine
strongman rides back to power behind an organization
that survived the long years of exile.
His wife, a former cabaret dancer with almost no
political background, has openly campaigned as the

successor to Peron's popular second wife, Evita, who died
of cancer.
One poster showed Peron and Isabel looking at each
other across an Argentine flag through which floated the
ghost of Evita.
Farm Workers Adopt Constitution
FRESNO, Calif. — The United Farm Workers adopted a
constitution yesterday after three days of debate
interspersed with speeches supporting their struggle to
represent field hands.
Key elements included a recommitment to
non-violence, a name change from United Farm Workers
Union to United Farm Workers of America and waiving
dues when members are out of work. Some had criticized
the practice of requiring $3.50 monthly dues of jobless
members.
The convention, first in the UFW's eight-year history,
was called to meet a federal requirement that unions
adopt constitutions. The UFW switched from an
organizing committee to an official AFL-CIO union early
last year.
James Herman, member of the Longshoremen's Union
executive board, broke the laborious study briefly by
promising to consider a ban on loading grapes bound for
export. UFW President Cesar Chavez has intensified a
table grape boycott in the union's fight with California
growers who refused to renew contracts this year. Many
signed farm labor pacts with the rival Teamsters Union.
Chrysler Workers End Strike
DETROIT — Chrysler production workers voted
acceptance by a wide margin of a new contract offer over
the weekend, ending a nine-day national walkout by most
of the company's 127,000 employees.
The United Auto Workers said 48 of 55 reporting
locals endorsed the accord, while seven rejected it. There
are 69 Chrysler locals.
The three-year contract includes among its provisions a
wage hike of three percent a year, plus 12 cents in the
first year.
The wage increase takes effect today when production
is set to resume. Fringe benefits such as voluntary
overtime and a company-supported dental plan will take
effect later in the contract period.
