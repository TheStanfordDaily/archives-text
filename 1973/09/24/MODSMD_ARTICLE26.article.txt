# ASSU Closes 'Door'

ASSU Sunday Flicks Manager Bob
Sisson has decided not to screen the
controversial X-rated film, Behind the
Green Door, on Dec. 9 because of
threatened criminal prosecution by the
Santa Clara County district attorney
for exhibition of an obscene film.
Acknowledging that a 300-person
survey at the final summer Sunday
Flick placed the film among the 10
most popular of 45, Sisson said he
"would like to show the film just
because of the great demand for it.
But I'll be in finals that week and I
don't want to be a test case."
A county sheriff's official told
University attorney Gerald Halligan
that the sheriff's vice squad would
probably confiscate the film and arrest
the projectionist.
(The film has already been ruled
obscene by an Orange County judge.
Similar charges are pending in San
Mateo County.)
'Graphic Depictions'
According to Santa Clara County
Deputy Dist. Atty. A 1 Nuddlman, the
film "contains graphic depictions of
orgiasm [sic], oral copulation, sodomy
and genital-to-genital intercourse,
which violate the California obscenity
law, Section 311 of the California
Penal Code."
Under that law, an obscene film is
one whose dominant theme appeals to
the prurient interest of an average
adult; whose contents are offensive as
an affront to community standards;
and that is taken as a whole lacking in
serious literary, artistic, political or
scientific value.
Sisson said that because Behind the
Green Door was "very popular,

beating out films like The Godfather
and Last Picture Show," he had
arranged a contract with the movie's
distributor, Mitchell Brothers Film
Group of San Francisco.
Approval Sought
But "because the film could be
construed as pornographic, I wanted
to make sure the University
approved," Sisson said.
He checked first with Public Events
Director Thomas Bacchetti, who said,
"We wouldn't try to stop it even if it
could be busted, but we would require
ASSU Sunday Flicks to sign a release
form saying they cannot ask
University legal support."
Sisson then consulted Halligan.
Remembering that sponsors of
pornographic films shown in Roble
Hall last year had received assurances
from the vice squad that no police action
would be taken if the films were
shown, Halligan believed such
assurance could be obtained for
Behind the Green Door.
Surprised
'The sheriff's office surprised me"
by threatening to take action this
time, Halligan said.
He theorized that "the D.A. tends
to have a better shot at conviction in
the sense that now it's for sure that
the state community can judge
whether or not the film meets the
three criteria of obscenity," since the
U.S. Supreme Court's June decision in
the case of Miller v. California.
Thus, despite the fact that ASSU
Sunday Flicks presented another
X-rated film, The History of the Blue
Movie, last year without incident or
complaint, Sisson plans to replace
Green Door with Easy Rider.


ALL-AMERICAN GIRL â€” The only chance students will have to see Marilyn
Chambers, star of "Behind the Green Door," is in her original role as cover girl
for Ivory Snow. The controversial film was tentatively scheduled for the Sunday
Flicks, but has been canceled for legal reasons.
