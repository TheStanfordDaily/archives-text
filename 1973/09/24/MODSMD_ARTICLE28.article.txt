## Had Rejected Shockley Course SWOPSI Decision Upheld 
### 
The SWOPSI Policy Board's
rejection of a genetics course proposed
by controversial Electrical Engineering
Prof. William Shockley — on a back
burner for almost a year — moved
back into the spotlight this summer
when a special investigating board
backed the policy board's action.
The investigating board, a
subcommittee of the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies, found that the
SWOPSI decision was based on
"reasoned and serious" grounds.
However, that conclusion was at
least partially questioned by

University President Richard W.
Lyman, who originally ordered the
CUS probe in August, 1972 after he
found some reasons given by SWOPSI
for the turndown "deeply disturbing."
Shockley, the Nobel Prize-winning
inventor of the transistor, has
theorized that blacks are genetically
less intelligent than whites. His course
would have explored the relationship
between heritability and intelligence.
The CUS report on the rejection,
originally due last Nov. 15, was not
issued until July 11, 1973. It in effect

discounted most of the reasons for the
turndown offered by SWOPSI Director
Dan Lewis in the letter of rejection he
sent Shockley in July, 1972.
Among reasons cited in the notice
were the possibilities that the class
might be disrupted and that the
workshop might contribute more to
the problem being discussed than to its
solution.
Lyman requested an investigation
into the rejection in September, 1972.
Political Science Prof. Hubert
Marshall, chairman of the CUS
subcommittee, explained that
difficulties in arranging meetings and
members' heavy teaching loads
delayed the report.
On July 24, two weeks after the
report was finally released, Lyman
declared that it had not "answered all
the questions I raised adequately," and
said he was "somewhat disappointed"
in its handling of matters related to
academic freedom.
CUS Chairman Edwin Good sharply
criticized Lyman's statements, saying
the president "misunderstood" parts
of the report and terming some of his
statements, "at best, incautious."
However, neither Lyman nor Good
appeared inclined to continue the
inquiry into the matter. Lyman noted
that further discussion would
eventually reach "the point of
diminishing returns."
A spokesman for the American
Civil Liberties Union, which at one
point had indicated an interest in
intervening in the case on Shockley's
behalf, said the organization now
contemplates no action in the matter.

COURSE CONTROVERSY — Over the summer, a subcommittee of the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies affirmed SWOPSI's decision not to allow
Electrical Engineering Prof. William B. Shockley (above) to teach a workshop on
his controversial theories on the heritability of intelligence.
