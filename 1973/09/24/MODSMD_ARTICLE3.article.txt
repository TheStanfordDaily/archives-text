# Remap Proposal Puts Campus Into New Legislative Districts
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
The Aug. 31 recommendations of the Special Masters,
the court-appointed reapportionment committee, could
presage major changes in the make-up of all three
legislative districts that include Stanford.
If the state Supreme Court approves the plan of the
three retired judges, Stanford will find itself in completely
new state Senate and Assembly districts, as well as a
substantially revamped Congressional district.
The Supreme Court appointed the Special Masters to
redraw the state's legislative boundaries after the state
legislature and Gov. Ronald Reagan were unable to reach
a compromise plan. Legislators — some of them less than
delighted with the Masters' plan — nonetheless think the
court will adopt the recommendations with few changes.
Under the Masters' plan, Stanford would be removed
completely from the districts of Assemblyman Richard
Hayden, R-Sunnyvale — a former University administrator
— and state Sen. Clark Bradley, R-San Jose. The campus
would remain in the district of Rep. Paul N. McCloskey
Jr., R-Menlo Park, but that district would be made more
geographically compact.
Congressional Changes
Currently, McCloskey's sprawling 17th District
stretches 37 miles from Hillsborough to East San Jose.
The Masters' proposal calls for the amputation of a long
"arm" that currently meanders from Palo Alto south
through parts of Mountain View, Sunnyvale, Santa Clara
and San Jose while bypassing several closer communities.
Instead, McCloskey would be given several of the closer
communities his district now misses, including Altos
and Los Altos Hills. The Masters' plan also reunites 10 of
the 12 municipalities that would have been split up
between two or more districts in the state legislature's
plan.
This would be the third major alteration of
McCloskey's district since he was first elected to Congress
in 1967. In that year, he ran to succeed the late Rep. J.
Arthur Younger, R-San Mateo, in a district totally within
San Mateo County.

Under a temporary reapportionment last year, the bulk
of his constituency was shifted into Santa Clara County, a
trend that would continue under the Masters' proposal.
Havoc On Gregorio
The Masters played havoc with the state Senate district
now represented by Sen. Arlen P. Gregorio, D-San Mateo.
As a result, Gregorio may be forced to run in a district
where half the voters — including those in Stanford and
Palo Alto — don't know him.
The Masters split Gregorio's current district nearly in
half. The northern part of his present constituency would
be linked with part of San Francisco to form one district,
while the southern portion of his current district would be
linked with northern Santa Clara County to form another
district.
Gregorio told the Daily he has given "very serious
thought" to running in the new 10th District, which
includes Stanford. He said he is leaning towards running in
the 10th, but has not "absolutely" decided, noting that
the Supreme Court might still modify the Masters'
proposal.
Arnett Opponent?
If Gregorio does run in the 10th, his most likely
opponent would be Assemblyman Dixon Arnett,
R Redwood City, whom Gregorio termed "very
formidable." A Gregorio-Arnett race would be
compounded by the fact that each has represented about
half of the district already: Gregorio has represented most
of the northern portion in the Senate, while Arnett has
represented most of the southern portion — except for the
Stanford-Palo Alto area — in the Assembly.
The Masters plan would carve out a completely new
Assembly district, the 21st, that would include much of
the area currently represented by Hayden. The new
district would cover Palo Alto-Stanford, a small portion of
San Mateo County including East Palo Alto and Menlo
Park, Mountain View and some 90 percent of Sunnyvale.
Hayden, however, lives in the 10 percent of Sunnyvale
not included in the 21st, and will probably run in his new,
southerly district — leaving the Palo Alto di&kiitv's seat
without an incumbent and up for grabs.
