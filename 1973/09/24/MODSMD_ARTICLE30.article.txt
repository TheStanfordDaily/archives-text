# Two Stanford Officers Deputized
## 
### 
Two Stanford Public Safety
Department officers have been
commissioned as reserve Santa Clara
County Sheriff's deputies, Public
Safety Director Marvin Herrington has
announced.
The two deputies are Thomas
Berubee, who has served 10 years in
the department, and Ernest Brooks, a
three-year veteran.
The move toward deputization
came as part of Herrington's
department reorganization in which
deputized officers will replace mobile
patrolmen on campus.
Herrington noted that "the
deputized officer has the power of any
policeman — to investigate, to make an
arrest. The mobile patrolman does not
have that authority, in that he may
only make a citizen's arrest, and must
call for a deputy after the crime."
Such deputization will gradually
"phase out" campus patrols by regular
sheriff's deputies, freeing the county
officers for work in other sections of
the county.
Six more officers, presently
fulfilling the 400-hour training
requirement for deputies, could be
patrolling campus as early as Nov. 1.
Herrington added that four officers
will be entering training school Oct. 1.
Present mobile patrolmen were not
required to complete such a screening
and training program.
The deputies will have
newly-ordered, more traditional police
uniforms. They will carry sidearms,
handcuffs and nightsticks as do
present mobile officers. Herrington
noted that the deputies may carry
mace regularly if trained to use it.

Herrington himself holds a captain's
rank in the sheriff's reserve. Public
Safety Capts. Frank Benederet and
William Wullschleger have been
deputies for about a year, bringing to
five the number of deputies in the
department.
