# Heart Surgeons In News Again
## 
### 
Four children of a Santa Rosa,
Calif, truck driver attracted national
attention June 28 when they all
underwent open heart surgery on the
same day at the Stanford Medical
Center.
The four children of Mr. and Mrs.
David Costello — David Jr., 18;
Richard, 15; Kevin, 13; and Karen,
four — sailed through the operation to
correct an atrial septal defect, a hole in
the muscle wall of the heart.
Hospital spokesman Gary Cavalli
said the defect, if unrepaired, is
debilitating but not fatal. Doctors
examining one child for an unrelated
ailment discovered the defect, and
subsequent examinations confirmed
the hereditary condition in the other
three.
Surgical teams headed by Drs.
Norman Shumway and Edward
Stinson performed the operations,
which took about two hours each.
The four were released from the
hospital on July 4. Doctors said that
after a month of rest, they would be
able to lead more active lives than they
had before the operations.
