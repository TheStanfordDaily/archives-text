# Stanford Summer News Summary
## USE Taking Steps Toward Negotiations 
### 
United Stanford Employees (USE)
took its first steps this summer toward
negotiating a contract with the
University.
The union, affiliated with the
Service Employees International
Union of the AFL-CIO, won the right
to represent some 1550 University
employees in bargaining with the
University in a June 6 election.
The vote in that election was 660
for USE and 494 favoring a "no
union" choice.
The employees represented by USE
hold technical, maintenance and
service jobs in a unit approved by the

National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB), which certified the results of
the June ballot.
However, the status of about 55
Tresidder food service employees
remains in doubt. These employees
were among those represented by USE
until Tout de Suite, Inc., a private
company, took over management of
the food service.
In a suit filed with the NLRB, USE
claims these workers should still be
among those officially represented by
USE. TDS disagrees, and the matter is
now in litigation in Washington.
The union has also obtained interim
office space in a temporary building
located between the Old Pavillion and
the Men's Pool.
USE President Glenda Jones is not
satisfied with the arrangement,
however, saying, "We ought to have
suitable space at a reasonable cost,"
and adding that USE would continue
bargaining with the University for
office space.
Jones said USE is also hopeful of
beginning contract negotiations with
the University this week. The union
spent the summer trying to formulate
a package of demands to present to
the University.
The union's contract demands
committee late last week was
considering two alternate proposals.
One would ask the University that "all
salaries be raised at least $100 per
month," with a minimum rate of
$3.47 per hour.
The other proposal would ask the
University for "step" increases which
would increase all salaries to average
Bay Area levels for different job
classifications.
