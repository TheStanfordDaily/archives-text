# Tresidder Hikes Prices
## 
### 
Prices at the Tresidder cafeteria and coffee house rose an average of 18
percent Aug. 23.
According to John Shaw, food services director of Tout de Suite, Inc. (TDS),
which manages the Tresidder food services, wholesale price rises forced the
increases.
In a memo addressed to Tresidder customers, Shaw said that "food costs have
increased 38-40 percent," in the past year.
While prices have skyrocketed, especially for high protein foodstuffs, TDS has
not experienced any major shortages.
TDS President Skip Mclntyre explained, "We might have a hard time getting
some item — for example, olives are very scarce right now — but for the most
part, all the shortages have meant to us is that we've had to go to a different
supplier for some item."
Earlier in the summer, Tresidder food prices rose six percent when California
state sales tax was imposed.
The tax took effect soon after TDS officially assumed management of the
cafeteria and coffee house June 23. Prior to that, the University managed the
food services and, as an educational institution, was not required to charge sales
tax.
The sales tax — formerly five percent — rose to six percent July 1. However,
the tax will return to its previous level on Oct. 1.
