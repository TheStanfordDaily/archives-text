# Judge Revises Decision Concerning Franklin Suit
## 
### 
Fired English Prof. H. Bruce
Franklin's lawsuit to be reinstated on
the faculty here "is very much up in
the air" after a ruling last month by
Santa Clara County Superior Court
Judge Joseph P. Kelly.
On May 24, Kelly denied the
University's motion for summary
judgment in its favor, ruling that the
court "has decided its duty in this case
is not simply to review the [Faculty]
Advisory Board proceedings [which
led to Franklin's dismissal] but to
accord plaintiff plenary trial of facts."
However, at the University's
request, Kelly reconsidered his
decision and ruled on Aug. 17 that he
did not have the authority to rule that
Franklin was entitled to a "complete
new trial," saying the matter "should
be resolved by the trial court, not this
department."
University attorney Gary H. Moore
said Kelly's original ruling "seemed
contrary to the law, contrary to

Franklin's contract and not to make
much sense."
According to Moore, Kelly in his
original decision "had not intended to
answer the question of what kind of
trial should take place in this case."
Both Moore and Larry Sleizer, an
ACLU attorney representing Franklin,
say there are no motions now pending
in the case.
Sleizer said he and ACLU attorney
Charles Marson are preparing to file
motions to obtain the evidence upon
which the University is basing its
defense. He said that Franklin still
intends to ask for a trial to examine
the procedure under which the
University dismissed him.
After six weeks of hearings, a board
of faculty members voted 5-2 in
January 1972 to recommend that
Franklin be fired for "urging and
inciting to the use of illegal coercion
and violence" during the previous
year. President Lyman and the Board
of Trustees upheld the
recommendation and dismissed
Franklin effective in August of that
year.
Moore, a member of the firm of
McCutchen, Doyle, Brown and
Enerson, said the case "is very much
up in the air. Either side has available
procedural routes they can follow."
He added that the University is
"considering the different actions we
might take, but we haven't firmly
decided which course to follow."
