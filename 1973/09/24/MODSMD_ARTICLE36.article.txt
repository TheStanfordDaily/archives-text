# Arbitrator Denies Jones' Grievance
## 
### 
Arbitrator Eva Robins July 27
denied fired SCIRE Director W. Ron
Jones' grievance against Dean of
Undergraduate Studies James L.
Gibbs.
In presiding over the grievance

hearings July 2 and 3, Robins stated
she would first decide whether Jones'
appointment was for one or two
academic years. Both Jones and
University attorney Gerald Halligan,
representing Gibbs, agreed that only if
she found that the University hired
Jones for two years would she judge
whether Gibbs had the right to fire
Jones before the SCIRE head's
contract had expired.
Robins' nine-page decision stated
that Jones' contract extended only to
his June 30, 1973 dismissal date, thus
ending the four-month long dispute.
Robins noted that Jones'
appointment was "short-term" and
concluded, "The University did not
reappoint him [Jones] for a second
year and that was within the
University's right."
The arbitrator also commented
extensively on Jones' term as SCIRE
director in the decision.
"It is my opinion that, although
Mr. Jones obviously had the ability to
work well with the students and the
capacity for handling well a part of the
position of director, his administrative
skill and his ability to meet the
legitimate needs of the University were
not sufficient," she stated.
"Under such circumstances, it
could not in any case be considered
unreasonable or discriminatory to
deny him reappointment for a second
year," she said.
Jones said he was "disappointed in
both the decision and the eventuality
of a student program being consumed
by the University."
The dean said last month he plans
to meet with the SCIRE Policy Board
in September to initiate a search for
Jones' successor. But he stated he did
not expect to appoint a new
permanent SCIRE director before
winter quarter.
How quickly SCIRE gets an acting
director "depends on how quickly we
[the dean's office] and the Policy
Board can come to an agreement,"
Gibbs sa d.
