# Coffee House Remodeled
## 
### 
The Stanford Community
Coffee House reopened July 9
with a completely new look.
The coffee house, remodeled
during June and early July, has a
completely new floor plan, service
area, decor and color scheme.
Architects Nick Corff and
Bonnie Koehler expanded the
service area into a three-sided bar.
Customers thus have access to the
service area from any of three
sides.
The new coffee house is larger
than the old one, as some space
was taken from the games room
next door.
The remodeling cost about
$30,000. Student labor was used
whenever possible in construction.
