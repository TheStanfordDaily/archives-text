# Student's Slaying Baffles Campus, County Officers
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Santa Clara County sheriff's
detectives and officers of the Stanford
Department of Public Safety remain
baffled by the brutal murder of a
physics student here nearly two weeks
ago.
Early on the morning of Sept. 11, a
jogger found the body of David Sidney
Levine, a senior in physics from
Ithaca, N.Y., on a walkway just east of
the Meyer Library. Levine's assailant
had stabbed him 15 times in the back
and side.
Contacted on Friday, Santa Clara
County Undersheriff Tom Rosa said,
"We haven't had any breaks at this
point in the case." He added that eight
to 10 investigators from his office
were still trying to solve the murder.

Rosa said that his office and
Stanford's Public Safety Department
have both supplemented their
on-campus patrols at night.
Caution Urged
Stanford Public Safety Capt. Frank
Benederet urged students and the
general public to be sensibly cautious
when on campus at night. Said
Benederet, "If a motive isn't
established for the murder of David S.
Levine, then there's a possibility that a
maniac is on the loose."
Detectives said that there was no
sign of a struggle near the spot where
Levine's body was found, indicating
his assailant took him completely by
surprise. Police found Levine's empty
wallet in his pants pocket and virtually
ruled out robbery as a possible motive
for the murder.
On the day of the murder, Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons
announced that the University is
offering a $10,000 reward for
information leading to the arrest and
conviction of Levine's murderer. The
University's offer expires on June 30,
1974.
Information Sought
Lyons asked those with "helpful
information" to contact the sheriff's
office at (408) 299-2211, or the
Stanford Public Safety Department at
321-2300, ext. 3444.
Witnesses saw Levine leaving the
physics department at approximately
1 a.m. the day he was killed.
Investigators believe he was slain while
returning to his home in the Mirrielees
Apartments in Escondido Village.
The murder was the second on the
main campus in the past decade. In
1969, Dr. Leslie Kulhanek was shot to
death at the Medical Center by a

gunman who later surrendered.
Top Student
Over the summer, Levine had been
compiling the computer program for a
magneto-cardiogram project being
coordinated by Physics Prof. William
Fairbanks. A co-worker in the project
observed that "only the top
undergraduate students got those
jobs."
"Dave was the one who really had
the computer knowledge in that
project," said the co-worker. "It will
take a long time to finish his work."
A straight-A student, Levine would
have graduated after only three years
because of advanced placement credit
he received for work in high school.
Levine was a member of the ASSU
Senate and also served on the
Academic Council's Committee on
Research. Lyons gave Levine credit for
a large portion of the effort required
for the publication of the ASSU
Course Review last spring.
Quiet Worker
Jack Gilderoy, a staff technician in
the Physics Department who also
worked with the Fairbanks group, said
that Levine usually preferred to work
quietly, by himself, and never seemed
to have visitors while he was working.
Other acquaintances called Levine a
"brilliant, quiet guy," a "hard
worker," and a "loner." Lyons said of
Levine, "He wasn't a loner. He was
busy."
Levine was the son of Cornell
University Agricultural Engineering
Prof. Gilbert Levine. At the request of
his family, the University established a
David Levine Memorial Fund to help
undergraduates studying in physics.

Encina Hall.
