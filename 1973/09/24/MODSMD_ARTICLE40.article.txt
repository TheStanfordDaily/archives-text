# Possible Violations Seen In Farm Labor Arrests
## 
### 
FRESNO (AP) â€” The chairman
of the state Assembly committee
investigating farm labor violence
said preliminary evidence shows
there is some validity to charges
that excessive force was used in
some arrests in Kern and Tulare
Counties.
Assemblyman Richard
Alatorre, D-Los Angeles, said his
group will concentrate on possible
"serious violations" of farm
workers' rights by law
enforcement officials in those
counties.
The violence erupted during
the summer in the Coachella and
San Joaquin Valleys as the United
Farm Workers union and the
Teamsters union became locked in
a bitter dispute over farm labor
contracts. More than 3500 arrests
were made statewide.
Alatorre did not detail the

violations his committee was
investigating.
"The committee is not out to
conduct a witch hunt," Alatorre
said. His committee just wants to
determine if accusations made by
the UFW against San Joaquin
Valley law enforcement agencies
are true, he explained.
His committee would not be
concerned with who is right or
wrong in the farm labor dispute,
he said. They simply want to
assess the performance of the law
enforcement agencies in question.
The end result, he said, may be
legislation to help better equip
law enforcement agencies to
handle such a situation, or further
investigation by the state attorney
general's office.
Alatorre was in Fresno to
attend a Mexican-American
Political Association fund-raising
function.
