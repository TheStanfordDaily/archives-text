# Pursuing An Unusual Hobby
## 
### 
RIDGEWOOD, N.J. (AP) -
When the spirit moves him, which
it does about every two weeks,
retired groceryman William M.
Stubbs drives off on an antique
hunt.
Old phonographs are his main
game. Their speaker horns
scattered about his cellar rumpus
room testify to highly successful
safaris.
He buys, sells and repairs
phonographs. He exhibits them
and lectures about them to clubs

and school kids.
His hunting expeditions usually
are conducted in about a 400-mile
area and run three or four days.
One or more of his three
grandchildren may go along.
If he fails to track down a
phonograph, he may bag one of
the old-time music boxes that he
says the phonograph replaced, or
an old mechanical bank, or a 19th
century toy, or any other antique
that strikes his fancy that he may
later spruce up and offer for sale.

He presently has about 30
phonographs and has sold about
125 over the years, made by
Edison, Columbia and Victor.
One of his proudest trophies,
which he isn't likely to part with,
is an Edison concert phonograph
resplendent with two four-foot
brass horns.
The 1899 creation by Thomas
A. Edison was a sort of first try at
present day stereo. It plays a wax
cylinder record five inches in
diameter and because of its
volume was used in theaters. It's
one of a half dozen the great
inventor made. They cost $150
apiece, a sizable sum at the turn
of the century.
"I've always liked antiques,"
said Stubbs. "I worked every day
for 25 years without a vacation or
a day off and didn't have much
time for them."
His first big antique purchase
was a model T1914 Ford. Later
he owned 1915 and 1910 Ford
models.
Now he has a 1931 Packard
roadster but his interest switched
from antique cars about three
years before retirement when his
son "dragged home a beat-up
Edison phonograph."
A one-time Edison employee
got the machine going, but after
Stubbs began collecting, he
became his own fixer-upper.
"There's a big demand for old
phonographs," said Stubbs.
"People want to put them in their
front room. They're getting
harder to find."

AUTUMNAL RITES — Although most students and parents aren't dancing at the prospect of paying yet
another tuition bill, these quaint and colorful Farm natives seem perfectly willing to boogie their cares
away.
RIDGEWOOD, N.J. (AP) -
When the spirit moves him, which
it does about every two weeks,
retired groceryman William M.
Stubbs drives off on an antique
hunt.
Old phonographs are his main
game. Their speaker horns
scattered about his cellar rumpus
room testify to highly successful
safaris.
He buys, sells and repairs
phonographs. He exhibits them
and lectures about them to clubs

and school kids.
His hunting expeditions usually
are conducted in about a 400-mile
area and run three or four days.
One or more of his three
grandchildren may go along.
If he fails to track down a
phonograph, he may bag one of
the old-time music boxes that he
says the phonograph replaced, or
an old mechanical bank, or a 19th
century toy, or any other antique
that strikes his fancy that he may
later spruce up and offer for sale.

He presently has about 30
phonographs and has sold about
125 over the years, made by
Edison, Columbia and Victor.
One of his proudest trophies,
which he isn't likely to part with,
is an Edison concert phonograph
resplendent with two four-foot
brass horns.
The 1899 creation by Thomas
A. Edison was a sort of first try at
present day stereo. It plays a wax
cylinder record five inches in
diameter and because of its
volume was used in theaters. It's
one of a half dozen the great
inventor made. They cost $150
apiece, a sizable sum at the turn
of the century.
"I've always liked antiques,"
said Stubbs. "I worked every day
for 25 years without a vacation or
a day off and didn't have much
time for them."
His first big antique purchase
was a model T1914 Ford. Later
he owned 1915 and 1910 Ford
models.
Now he has a 1931 Packard
roadster but his interest switched
from antique cars about three
years before retirement when his
son "dragged home a beat-up
Edison phonograph."
A one-time Edison employee
got the machine going, but after
Stubbs began collecting, he
became his own fixer-upper.
"There's a big demand for old
phonographs," said Stubbs.
"People want to put them in their
front room. They're getting
harder to find."
