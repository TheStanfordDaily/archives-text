# Unique Automated System
## Infant Deafness Battled 
### 
Screening newborn babies for
deafness is a 24-hour operation
the Medical Center here, but it is
all done by machine.
A unique automated system
called the crib-o-gram detects
infant movement in the crib and
records any changes when a test
sound is turned on. Over the past
three years, 180,000 tests have
been administered to 6000 babies
in the nurseries here.
The procedure was developed
to meet the challenge of detecting
hearing loss and deafness early in
life, long before the parents or
physician would normally suspect
a problem exists.
Results so far have been
encouraging. Eight babies who
failed the test at birth were
confirmed by additional testing at
six months to have hearing losses.
Treatment for them has begun
before the age of one, giving them
a better chance to live a fuller life
in a sound-filled world.
The findings were reported last
week by the crib-o-gram's
developer, Dr. F. Blair Simmons,
head of the division of
otolaryngology at the School of
Medicine. They were presented at
the 78th annual meeting of the
American Academy of
Ophthalmology and
Otolaryngology in Dallas, Texas.
Grant From NIH
Simmons' work was done with
the help of Frederica Russ,
research assistant. It was
supported by a grant from the
National Institute of Neurological
Diseases and Stroke of the
National Institutes of Health in
Bethesda, Maryland.
"Hearing rehabilitation is most
successful if it is begun around six
months of age," said Simmons.
"Yet very few children with
hearing defects are discovered
before they are one. In fact, most
problems are not detected until
children are two or three, when
their language development
falters. Testing hearing at birth or
soon after can improve the
chances of normal speech and
language development," he noted.
The heart of the automatic
system is an inexpensive motion
detector called a transducer. It
was originally developed to
register the fuel load in aircraft by
the amount of weight stress on
the wing supports. When mounted
on the crib frame, it detects the
stress caused by movement in the
crib.
Sensitive Device
The device monitors motion
before, during, and after a test
sound is emitted from a
microphone in the ceiling of the
nursery. It is so sensitive, it can
detect breathing, heart beats or
hiccups.
Activity is recorded on a paper
tape which is scored during
normal working hours. Since the
crib-o-gram is a pilot project,
scoring is done by individuals, but
a computer could do it as
completely, Simmons pointed
out. "It is simply a matter of

determining whether there has
been a change in crib activity after
a test sound."
The likelihood of a positive
test response independent of
spontaneous movements, nursery
routines and changes in arousal
level depends on the infants' level
of consciousness. Tests are most
accurate when infants are lightly
sleeping according to the
investigators, and least dependable
when they are fully awake and
active or deeply asleep and
dreaming.
Best Results Obtained
At Stanford, the best time to
obtain positive responses is
between 3 and 4 a.m., said
Simmons. However, he stresses
that it is important to test infants
repeatedly at different times
throughout their nursery stay for
a valid response rate.
An index of infants' response
rates to account for spontaneous
movements unrelated to the test
sound is computed periodically by
running a test without sound. The
scorer, who does not know when
a test has been silent, scores it the
same way as a regular test. Scoring
criteria are revised from the
results of the random rates.
Criteria for passing and failing
the test have been developed
through a control study of 5000
babies in the Stanford nurseries
between October 1970 and April
1973. Infants are considered to
hear if their response rates are
better than 20 percent, or if there
are two distinct arousal responses
within two seconds after the test
sound.
Stanford Requests Data
The average response rate of
those in the study who passed was
36 percent. Pediatricians of every
infant tested have been requested
to notify Stanford if any hearing
problems develop later. But in a
follow-up study of two-year-olds
who passed the test, there have
been no reports of deafness.
A total of 327 babies who
failed the crib-o-gram were asked
to return here or another facility
at six months for further
screening. Eight of those babies
were found to have hearing
defects.
The incidence of deafness in
newborns is one or two per
thousand, according to Simmons.
Since it is a relatively small ratio,
nursery staff or pediatricians do
not always feel it is worth their
time to screen every infant
individually, he said.
'Everything Is Mechanized'
"With the crib-o-gram, little
extra time or effort is involved,"
explained Simmons. "Everything
can be mechanized, and the
average cost is 85 cents per child."
The equipment is set to test
each of four rooms of the
well-baby nursery 20 times a day.
It turns on, simultaneously
monitors all cribs in a room,
switches to another room and
then shuts off after every room
has been tested until a timer
begins the next cycle.

Although the system monitors
the 32 cribs in the Stanford
nursery, it is capable of testing
600 babies an hour throughout
the day, Simmons said. Each crib
is identified for the recorder unit
by a digital code.
More Care Required
For babies in the premature
and intensive care nurseries who
require more individual care,
Simmons has designed a small,
portable unit that can be used
with any type of crib, including
an isolette. Infants as small as
three and one-half pounds have
been successfully tested.
The transducer is placed under
the mattress and a small
microphone is clipped to the crib.
Before infants are discharged, a
test sequence is recorded hourly
for 24 hours. Results are
processed as in the larger system,
but there are no silent tests to
check spontaneous responses. This
smaller unit is also being tried by
hospitals in Boston, Denver and
Pittsburgh.
