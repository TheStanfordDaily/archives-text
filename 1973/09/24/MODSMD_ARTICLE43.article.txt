# Lower College Enrollment Seen
## 
### 
BERKELEY (AP) - Far fewer students
than projected will enroll in the nation's
colleges and universities in this century, the
Carnegie Commission on Higher Education
reported yesterday.
Commission Chairman Clark Kerr
announced the revised projection for 1980 is
1.5 million less than the projection made in
1971 and the new figure for the year 2000 is
3.4 million less than the 1971 projection.
He said enrollment would decline because
the number of high school graduates has

leveled off, birth rates have declined sharply
and college and university enrollments have
decreased in 1971 and 1972.
The new projections for total enrollment in
U.S. higher education call for 11.4 million in
1980, 10.6 million in 1990 and 13.2 million
in 2000. The enrollment in 1970 was 8.6
million.
Details of the revisions will be described in
a technical note to the commission's final
report which is scheduled to be released next
month, Kerr said.
