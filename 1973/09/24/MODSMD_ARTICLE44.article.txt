# Congressmen Worried About Safety Of Chilean Prisoners
## 
### 
After returning from
Washington, D.C. last week
Political Science Prof. Richard
Fagen said he believes that the
congressmen involved with
U.S.-Latin American relations are
concerned about the safety of
Chilean prisoners and exiles.
Fagen returned here after two
days in Washington with Profs.
Henry Landsberger of the
University of North Carolina and
Thomas Skidmore of the
University of Wisconsin.
Fagen is president-elect of the
Latin American Studies
Association, Landsberger is
current president, and Skidmore
immediate past president of the
1500-member scholarly
association. All spoke with
congressmen as individuals rather
than representatives of the
organization, however.
The three professors and three
representatives of the National
Council of Churches and the U.S.
Catholic Conference met with
Sens. Edward Kennedy of
Massachusetts, Gale McGee of
Wisconsin, and Congressmen
Dante Fascell, Donald Fraser, and
others.
The scholars expressed their
concern about the safety and
treatment of prisoners by the new
Chilean junta and the confusing
reports and censorship of the
media following the military
coup.
"Everyone we met was
extremely cooperative," Fagen
said. "Kennedy and Fraser, who
head the Senate and House
committees on refugees and
exiles, promised to explore ways
to alleviate the situation and

protect basic human and civil
rights for both Chileans and
foreigners.
"Above all," he added, "we
were able to see so many busy

people in so short a time that it
indicates a real Congressional
concern about the Chilean
situation and the past, present,
and future role of the U.S. in
Chile."
