### 
An expanded series of eight
Tuesday Evening Lectures here
will offer campus residents an
opportunity to hear outstanding
teachers present their views on
such varied topics as human
behavior control, China, cancer,
and creativity.
Long a popular tradition here,
the series drew a total attendance
of more than 5,600 when it was
revived last year with a series of
seven lectures.
All the 1973-74 programs are
scheduled for 8 p.m. and are open
to the public free of charge.

psychology of prison life received
widespread publicity, will open
the series Oct. 9 in Memorial
Auditorium. He will lecture on
"The Now Generation vs. The
H e re-To morrow Gone-Tod ay
Generation: Reflections on the
Temporal Control of Human

Prof. Jim Adams and Bob
McKim of the Design Division,
whose classes build unusual
contraptions to accomplish
specified tasks, will attempt to
remove your "Blocks to
Creativity" in their Nov. 13
lecture in the Tresidder Union
lounges. Their demonstration that
rigid thinking and problem solving
are incompatible has proven
highly popular.

Communist in the Chinese
Revolution" will be the title of

Prof. John W. Lewis's Dec. 4

on his major concern — civil
liberty and education for citizens
of emerging nations.

who is credited by Capt. James
Stockdale, USN, with teaching the
salutary principles that redeemed
his life as a POW in Vietnam, will
lecture on "Authority and

lecture on "Authority and
Freedom," March 12 in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Rhinelander's judgment and
integrity have won him the
respect of colleagues and students
alike.
An expanded series of eight
Tuesday Evening Lectures here
will offer campus residents an
opportunity to hear outstanding
teachers present their views on
such varied topics as human
behavior control, China, cancer,
and creativity.
Long a popular tradition here,
the series drew a total attendance
of more than 5,600 when it was
revived last year with a series of
seven lectures.
All the 1973-74 programs are
scheduled for 8 p.m. and are open
to the public free of charge.
Prof. Philip G. Zimbardo,
whose campus experiment in the
psychology of prison life received
widespread publicity, will open
the series Oct. 9 in Memorial
Auditorium. He will lecture on
"The Now Generation vs. The
H e re-To morrow Gone-Tod ay
Generation: Reflections on the
Temporal Control of Human
Behavior."
Prof. Jim Adams and Bob
McKim of the Design Division,
whose classes build unusual
contraptions to accomplish
specified tasks, will attempt to
remove your "Blocks to
Creativity" in their Nov. 13
lecture in the Tresidder Union
lounges. Their demonstration that
rigid thinking and problem solving
are incompatible has proven
highly popular.
"Divine Rebels and Mortal
Communist in the Chinese
Revolution" will be the title of

Prof. John W. Lewis's Dec. 4
lecture in Memorial Auditorium.
Lewis will accompany his lecture
with slides from his recent visit to

been a pioneer in the treatment of
Hodgkin's disease and is one of
the nation's leading authorities on
cancer treatment.
"World Culture and the Black
Experience" is the title of Dr. Ali
Mazrui's Feb. 12 lecture in the
Tresidder Union lounges. A native
of Kenya and one of Africa's most
eminent political thinkers, he is
currently a visiting research fellow
at the Hoover Institution. He has
written many books and articles
on his major concern — civil
liberty and education for citizens
of emerging nations.
Prof. Philip H. Rhinelander,
who is credited by Capt. James
Stockdale, USN, with teaching the
salutary principles that redeemed
his life as a POW in Vietnam, will
lecture on "Authority and
Freedom," March 12 in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
