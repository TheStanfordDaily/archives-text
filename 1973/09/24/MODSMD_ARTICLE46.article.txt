# Meet Stanford's Wild Wide World
## 
### TERRY ANZUR GEORGE DOBBINS 
(First of Two Parts)
Stanford and its enviorns
provide a veritable smorgasbord of
entertainment — if you know
where to look for it and have
enough money to pay for it.
The most exhaustive listing of
Bay Area entertainment events
appears in the San Francisco
Chronicle Sunday "pink sheet."
Entertainment Spectrum, a
selective listing of events of

special interest to Daily readers
will appear every Thursday on the
entertainment pages.
The Office of Public Events,
ASSU Special Events, and other
Stanford organizations promote a
variety of performers, speakers,
films, and events on campus. And
tickets to all major Bay Area
happenings may be obtained via
Ticketron (for a small service
charge) at the Tresidder ticket
office.
This article is intended as an

overview of Stanford-area
entertainment highlights, to help
you plan those much-anticipated
study breaks in advance. The
uninitiated freshman will soon
discover, however, that the
Stanford student's problem is not
in deciding whether or not to opt
for recreation, but in choosing
what he will do with his
entertainment time and dollars.
POPULAR MUSIC
Stanford students are fortunate
to be attending a prestigious
campus that, by its name and
location, attracts a great deal of
popular musical talent.
Aside from guitarists or singers
who may spontaneously entertain
at Tresidder or in White Plaza, the
major organized pop-culture
events including rock concerts are
sponsored by the ASSU Special
Events Board; this Sunday,
September 30, special events
directors Dan Scher and Doug
Baldwin present Joan Baez in
concert at 3 p.m. in Frost
Amphitheater, with gates open at
2. All tickets are $2.50, available
thru ASSU or at the door.
Upcoming special
events-sponsored attractions
include: the S.F. Mime Troupe
(Oct. 13), a Latin Dance (Nov.
10), and a concert featuring Hot
Tuna, the Albert King Review and
the sounds of Mark
Bloomfield-Mark Naftalin (Dec.
1).
Outside of Stanford, rock,
popular music, jazz, and even blue
grass are usually a short distance
away. Although the Circle Star
Theatre in San Carlos and Marine
World in Redwood City
frequently provide concerts and a
few local clubs such as Homer's
Warehouse in Palo Alto feature
bluegrass and rock performers, the
major activities are in San
Francisco.
Bill Graham, whose Filmore
East and West closed down a
couple of years back, still provides
the majority of live rock concerts
for local audiences, held in San
Francisco at Winterland or the
Masonic Auditorium and in
Berkeley at the Community
Theatre and in Oakland at the
Coliseum. Tomorrow night, he
presents the Allman Brothers
Band at the Oakland Coliseum at
7:30 p.m. From Sept. 27 thru 30,
songstress Bette Midler appears at
Berkeley. On Tuesday, Oct. 9,
Graham presents Rod Stewart and
Faces with Earth, Wind and Fire
and Rory Galagher at the Cow
Palace.
For bluegrass music, the best
place to go is the Boarding House
at 960 Bush St. in San Francisco.
The Big Band jazz sound can best
be heard at the Great American
Music Hall at 859 O'Farrell in the
city. On Sept. 28-29, the Hall
presents the Thad Jones-Mel
Lewis Band. The Hall regularly
features a variety of performers
ranging from Buddy Rich to
Butch Whacks and the Glass
Packs.
A number of independent
promoters also spark musical
entertainment in the Bay Area.
Concerts are usually held at: the
Oakland Coliseum, Marin
Veterans Auditorium in San
Rafael, San Jose Civic
Auditorium, Masonic Auditorium
and SF Civic Auditorium.
Tomorrow evening at 8 p.m.,
Gary Naseef presents Rare Earth
with Buddy Miles in Concert at
the Oakland Coliseum.
LIVELY ARTS AT STANFORD
According to director Tom
Bachetti, the Office of Public
Events plans to offer Stanfordites
"a chance to stretch your minds
and emotions by hearing, seeing,
and digesting a wide range of
performances, some by the
world's great artists, some by
potentially great young
professionals, and some by
students struggling to gain a

foothold in a slippery profession
and still concerned with the
difficult ma t ters of
interpretation."
The Public Events season kicks
off Sunday, Oct. 7 with the
American Brass Quintet. Other
fall quarter attractions include the
Cleveland Quartet (Oct. 16), the
Alvin Ailey Dance Theater (Oct.
17-20) guitarist Narciso Yepes
(Nov. 2), mezzo soprano Joy
Blackett (Nov. 9), the Guarneri
String Quartet (Nov. 11),
flamenco guitarist Paco DeLucia
(Nov. 16), Richard Kiley's
interpretation of Cervantes (Nov.
21), the Aman Folk Dance
ensemble (Nov. 30).
Season tickets and series
tickets that entitle the holder to
attend all performances in a given
interest area (e.g. guitarists, early
music), are available at 30 percent
discount from regular admission
prices averaging $3-5 for each
event.
Public events will also present
"The Best of Charlie Chaplin" a
fall quarter film «prips.
STUDENT PRODUCTIONS
The University drama
department has scheduled four
major productions for the
upcoming academic year. During
fall quarter, Puntila and His Hired
Man, an Austrian folk play by
Bertolt Brecht, will be staged in
the Little Theater Nov. 6-10 and
13-17.
The Music Department
presents a program of classical
music artists that continues
throughout the year, commencing
in early October.
Tickets for all music and drama
department productions are
available in advance by mail or at
the Tresidder ticket office and
student rates and package plans
are offered.
Campus musical organizations
and individual artists also offer
free concerts throughout the year.
"The Company" — a group of
undergraduate thespians — some
residences and many student
groups frequently provide
enjoyable entertainment on
campus free or at nominal
admission prices.
SAN FRANCISCO 'CULTURE'
Stanford's proximity to "The
City" allows the music buff who is
willing to drive 37 miles to take
advantage of excellent symphony
and opera productions.
The San Francisco Symphony,
under the direction of Seiji Ozawa
and various guest conductors
opens its 62nd season Nov. 28.
Many dorms purchase season
tickets to the symphony for use
by residents and non-residents on
a first-come-first-served basis.
The opera season is currently
full-swing. (Turn to page 16 for
more information on attending
the opera.) Radio station KKHI
carries live broadcasts from the
Opera House.
But symphony and opera
abound throughout the Bay Area.
The San Jose Symphony under
the direction of George Cleve
offers a fine concert season
beginning Oct. 13. The Paramount
Theater of the Arts in Oakland
will house the Oakland Symphony
as well as a varied program of
classic movie revivals and cultural
events.
Local opera associations often
stage excellent productions.
First American Concerts, Inc.
brings reknowned artists to the
Bay Area. Various dance troupes,
orchestras, and individuals
generally make the rounds of the
San Francisco Opera House, the
Paramount in Oakland, and Flint
Center in Cupertino. Tickets for
all attractions are available at
Tresidder, and special ticket
packages are available.
THE ART SCENE
Art galleries mushroom in the
Bay Area. Major museums include
the California Palace of the Legon
of Honor and the M.H. deYoung
Memorial Museum in Golden Gate
Park, the San Francisco Museum
of Art near the Civic Center, and
the Oakland Museum across the
bay. There are several excellent
art galleries in Palo Alto.
The Stanford Museum and Art
Gallery calendar of exhibits for
fall quarter includes Indian
Paintings (Art Gallery, Sept.
25-Nov. 4), Master Prints and
Drawings (Museum, Oct. 2-Nov.
18), Shipwrecks (Art Gallery,
Nov. 13-Jan. 2), and Dolls and
Puppets (Museum, Dec. 2-Jan.
13). Admission is free. Tours are
available.
The Committee for Art at
Stanford will sponsor "Art Plus"
— a diverse series of art-related
lectures by distinguished scholars.
The afternoon series (Oct. 2-Dec.
4) on Tuesdays from 1:15-2:30
p.m. will focus on the history of
the artist's profession. A spring
quarter series will cover European
and Renaissance Art.
A Tuesday evening program
Oct. 2-Dec. 4, at 8:15-9:30 p.m.
will explore "China: Yesterday
and Today," covering economics,
religion, and technology as related
to the art of the country.
All "Art Plus" lectures will be
held in Annenberg Auditorium in
the Cummings Art Building.

Admission cost for the full
20-lecture series is $50, $30 for
10 lectures.
ON STAGE
Although some dramatic
entertainment is available on
campus, numerous drama
companies thrive in the San
Francisco atmosphere.
American Conservatory
Theater (ACT) productions offer
a consistently high caliber of
entertainment. Money-saving
ticket package plans are available
for the 73-74 season which opens
October 12. Student rush is
usually available for ACT
productions.
Included in the lineup of plays
are Shakespeare's The Taming of
the Shrew, Chekhov's The Cherry
Orchard, Moliere's The Miser,
Lorca's The House of Bernardo
Alba, Rostand's Cyrano de
Bergerac, and such plays as
Broadway, The Hot L Baltimore,
Tonight at 8:30 and You Can't
Take It With You.
In addition, ACT also sponsors
such special attractions as
Godspell, and Dont Bother Me I
Can't Cope.
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest, a play based on the novel by
Ken Kesey, is in its fourth year at
the Little Fox Theater in San
Francisco. It received rave reviews
and should provide a fine
evening's entertainment.
Many fine productions
hopefully headed for the
Broadway stage stop off for a
short run at the San Francisco
Civic Light Opera's Curran
Theater. Carol Channing is
currently starring in Lorelei there,
and coming attractions include
Deborah Kerr in The Day After
the Fair, and a stage musical
version of Gone With The Wind.
For middle-of-the-road and
contemporary stage shows, the
Circle Star in nearby San Carlos is
the place to go. Mitzi Gaynor is
currently headlining there, and
she will be followed by such
well-known celebrities as Helen
Reddy, Johnny Carson, Bill
Cosby, George Carlin, and Gladys
Knight and the Pips. The
Fairmont Hotel also books
big-name nightclub entertainment.
Bay Area resident stage
companies also present some fine
entertainment. The Palo Alto
Community Playhouse, and the
Berkeley Repertory theater are
among the many groups worthy
of note.
For Gibert and Sullivan buffs,
the Lamplighters are the resident
G&S troupe in the city. The
Savoyards maintain the G&S
tradition here at Stanford.
The San Francisco Ballet will
unveil its new repertoire in an
Oakland Season Oct. 10-21. Until
Rudolph Nureyev and the
National Ballet of Canada return
to the area in the spring, Bay Area
balletomanes must satisfy their
aesthetic apetites with the San
Jose Dance Theater, Ballet San
Jose, and other regional and local
companies.
Contemporary dance fans also
face a rather skimpy diet in the
Bay Area, but modern dance
troupes and folk ensembles tour
the area from time to time.
TOURIST TRAPS, HANGOUTS
AND OTHER EVENTS
When you just can't fight the
urge to don your Hawaiian print
shirt and Kodak instamatic
camera, the tourist bastions of the
Bay Area will welcome you with
open arms.
If you're wild enough, Marine
World/Africa U.S.A. offers the
usual killer-whale-dolphin-show
type of attractions. (Rock
concerts are frequently held at
Marine World, too.)
While nothing in the area can
begin to compete with
Disneyland, Frontier Village
offers a commercialized journey
into the old West. The Santa Cruz
Boardwalk boasts the usual
amusement park fare, highlighted
by the Big Dipper roller coaster.
For relaxed shopping and
people-watching, visit Sausalito,
Fisherman's Wharf, Ghirardelli
Square, the Cannery (near the
Wharf), and Old Town LosGatos.
In addition, it's a good idea to
take advantage of such special
events as the Renaissance Pleasure
Faire in the Oak Forest near
Novato, weekends through Oct. 8.
