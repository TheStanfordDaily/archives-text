# 'American Graffiti'
## Nostalgic Film Gives Blast From The Past 
### DAN FORTE 
Remember when everyone
thought Wolfman Jack was a
Negro? For that matter,
remember when "Negro" was an
acceptable term?
American Graffiti asks the
musical question, "Where were
you in '62?"
If you're having a hard time
remembering back to '62, that
was the year the Beach Boys
ushered in surf music with
"Surfin' Safari."
But not everyone immediately
bleached their hair, donned blue
tennies, and headed for the beach.
One prime example in American
Graffiti was John Milner who had
the hottest machine in the San
Joaquin Valley, didn't dig the new
"surf shit," and thought rock 'n'
roll had "gone downhill ever
since Buddy Holly died."
Golden Oldies Revisited
At that time most kids
probably would have echoed his
sentiments. At least 75 percent of
the songs heard in American
Graffiti, via Wolfman Jack's radio
broadcast, were recorded before
1960.
The use of "Rock Around The
Clock" (a hit in 1955) as the
opening theme was reaching a bit,
especially since it already has been
used as a movie theme, in
Blackboard Jungle. The closing
theme, "All Summer Long," was
recorded by The Beach Boys after
1962.
Unlike most movies trying to
cash in on the current nostalgia
trend, American Graffiti not only
boasts 50s and early 60s music
and greasy hair styles, but also
features an exciting plot and fine
acting. Especially notable
performances come from Richard
Dreyfus and Paul LeMat, as
Milner.
Memory Lane
American Graffiti is sure to
evoke many memories, whether

you graduated from high school in
'62 or '72. Everyone knew a guy
like John Milner; every town has
at least one. (You can still run
into a few of these rare types on
East 14th St. in San Leandro on
any Friday night.)
The movie was filmed in
Petaluma on Petaluma Boulevard,
at Mel's Drive-In in San Francisco,
and at Tarn High in Mill Valley.
The New York Times called
American Graffiti, "easily one of
the best films of the year." So far
it's been the year's biggest
money-maker, and hopefully
should be in line for a fair share of
awards; maybe even an Oscar or
two.
Put American Graffiti high on
your list of films to see this year
— it's the next best thing to
actually cruisin' Third Street for
yourself.

recorded by The Beach Boys after
1962.
Unlike most movies trying to
cash in on the current nostalgia
trend, American Graffiti not only
boasts 50s and early 60s music
and greasy hair styles, but also
features an exciting plot and fine
acting. Especially notable
performances come from Richard
Dreyfus and Paul LeMat, as
Milner.
Memory Lane
American Graffiti is sure to
evoke many memories, whether

you graduated from high school in
'62 or '72. Everyone knew a guy
like John Milner; every town has
at least one. (You can still run
into a few of these rare types on
East 14th St. in San Leandro on
any Friday night.)
The movie was filmed in
Petaluma on Petaluma Boulevard,
at Mel's Drive-In in San Francisco,
and at Tarn High in Mill Valley.
The New York Times called
American Graffiti, "easily one of
the best films of the year." So far
it's been the year's biggest
money-maker, and hopefully
should be in line for a fair share of
awards; maybe even an Oscar or
two.
Put American Graffiti high on
your list of films to see this year
— it's the next best thing to
actually cruisin' Third Street for
yourself.
Remember when everyone
thought Wolfman Jack was a
Negro? For that matter,
remember when "Negro" was an
acceptable term?
American Graffiti asks the
musical question, "Where were
you in '62?"
If you're having a hard time
remembering back to '62, that
was the year the Beach Boys
ushered in surf music with
"Surfin' Safari."
But not everyone immediately
bleached their hair, donned blue
tennies, and headed for the beach.
One prime example in American
Graffiti was John Milner who had
the hottest machine in the San
Joaquin Valley, didn't dig the new
"surf shit," and thought rock 'n'
roll had "gone downhill ever
since Buddy Holly died."
Golden Oldies Revisited
At that time most kids
probably would have echoed his
sentiments. At least 75 percent of
the songs heard in American
Graffiti, via Wolfman Jack's radio
broadcast, were recorded before
1960.
The use of "Rock Around The
Clock" (a hit in 1955) as the
opening theme was reaching a bit,
especially since it already has been
used as a movie theme, in
Blackboard Jungle. The closing
theme, "All Summer Long," was
recorded by The Beach Boys after
1962.
