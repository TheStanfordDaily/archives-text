# 'Green Door' Tops Hard-Core Porn Field
## 
### GEORGE POWELL 
Pornography, like rock and
roll, is here to stay, contrary to
what Warren Burger or Richard
Nixon have to say about the
subject. Interest in pornography
has always been generated not by
its artistic merits, but by its
appeal to the prurient interest.
The San Francisco area has of
late been attempting to combine
parts of both appeals to make the
ultimate hard-core pornographic
movie.
Taking time out for a brief
definition of terms, pornographic
means having to do with sexual
arousal (although there are many
other kinds of pornography) and
hard-core means showing actual,
not simulated, intercourse.
With these definitions in mind,
San Francisco's resident brother
tandem in the hard-core field, the

Mitchell Borthers, have in fact
created the closest thing to an
arty porn-flick to date — Behind
the Green Door.
Porno Film Queen
Although it hasn't had the
national exposure of Deep Throat,
it is a better erotic film that
involves the audience more in
what's happening on the screen,
mostly because of the presence of
Marilyn Chambers.
She, and not Linda Lovelace,
should be the reigning hard-core
sex queen for at least three
reasons. Chambers is better
looking with her clothes on or off,
is better at emoting erotically, and
doesn't seem bored with the
action.
Behind the Green Door also
has Johnnie Keyes, who more
than fulfills everyone's fantasy in
the role of Black Stud. He and
Marilyn really bring the word
intercourse to life in an effort that
leaves both them and the audience
gasping at its conclusion.

The plot the Mitchell brothers
chose to build this erotic movie
on is fairly simple, but convincing
enough for the 73-minute film.
Chambers is a girl who checks
into a motel/hotel but has been
fingered for kidnapping by this
San Francisco-based sex club. As
an entertainment for the masked
guests she will be ravished in
various ways while loving every
minute of it.
The questions of why she was
picked for kidnapping and how
she becomes so compliant are
never answered, but by inference
the audience can assume she is not
unfamiliar with various sex acts,
since she performs intercourse and
fellatio with gusto in various
positions for most of the movie.
Truck Driver's Fantasy?
But in a further twist to the
plot, the story of what goes on
behind the Green Door is actually
being told by a couple of truck
drivers in a diner to an attentive
counterman. The whole thing

could be a figment of a horny
truck driver's imagination.
Technically, the movie isn't as
well-photographed as The Devil in
Miss Jones, a hard-core film which
has won its share of critical
plaudits along with Deep Throat.
But the Mitchell brothers, James
and Artie, seem to have a way of
filming slam-bam hard-core action
without making it dull and
mechanical.
After some years of producing
run-of-the-mill sex films, the
Mitchell brothers have a chance to
become the Russ Meyer of the
19705. Meyer made the
breakthrough of the 1960s with
The Immoral Mr. Teas, which
featured a man with eyes that
could see through clothes. That
fantasy seems quite tame
compared to the fantasies actually
acted out in Behind the Green
Door.
Setting Hard-Core Standards
But who, other than the public
collectively, can draw the line at a

certain level of candor and
permissiveness? What new levels
the Mitchell brothers latest film
featuring Marilyn Chambers will
reach are unknown to this
reviewer. The Resurrection of Eve
has been released in the Bay Area
and will be reported on here soon.
Until that film is reviewed, the
report card on Chambers in
Behind the Green Door ought to
have three D's — debauched,
depraved and delightful.

hard-core means showing actual,
not simulated, intercourse.
With these definitions in mind,
San Francisco's resident brother
tandem in the hard-core field, the

Mitchell Borthers, have in fact
created the closest thing to an
arty porn-flick to date — Behind
the Green Door.
Porno Film Queen
Although it hasn't had the
national exposure of Deep Throat,
it is a better erotic film that
involves the audience more in
what's happening on the screen,
mostly because of the presence of
Marilyn Chambers.
She, and not Linda Lovelace,
should be the reigning hard-core
sex queen for at least three
reasons. Chambers is better
looking with her clothes on or off,
is better at emoting erotically, and
doesn't seem bored with the
action.
Behind the Green Door also
has Johnnie Keyes, who more
than fulfills everyone's fantasy in
the role of Black Stud. He and
Marilyn really bring the word
intercourse to life in an effort that
leaves both them and the audience
gasping at its conclusion.

The plot the Mitchell brothers
chose to build this erotic movie
on is fairly simple, but convincing
enough for the 73-minute film.
Chambers is a girl who checks
into a motel/hotel but has been
fingered for kidnapping by this
San Francisco-based sex club. As
an entertainment for the masked
guests she will be ravished in
various ways while loving every
minute of it.
The questions of why she was
picked for kidnapping and how
she becomes so compliant are
never answered, but by inference
the audience can assume she is not
unfamiliar with various sex acts,
since she performs intercourse and
fellatio with gusto in various
positions for most of the movie.
Truck Driver's Fantasy?
But in a further twist to the
plot, the story of what goes on
behind the Green Door is actually
being told by a couple of truck
drivers in a diner to an attentive
counterman. The whole thing

could be a figment of a horny
truck driver's imagination.
Technically, the movie isn't as
well-photographed as The Devil in
Miss Jones, a hard-core film which
has won its share of critical
plaudits along with Deep Throat.
But the Mitchell brothers, James
and Artie, seem to have a way of
filming slam-bam hard-core action
without making it dull and
mechanical.
After some years of producing
run-of-the-mill sex films, the
Mitchell brothers have a chance to
become the Russ Meyer of the
19705. Meyer made the
breakthrough of the 1960s with
The Immoral Mr. Teas, which
featured a man with eyes that
could see through clothes. That
fantasy seems quite tame
compared to the fantasies actually
acted out in Behind the Green
Door.
Setting Hard-Core Standards
But who, other than the public
collectively, can draw the line at a

certain level of candor and
permissiveness? What new levels
the Mitchell brothers latest film
featuring Marilyn Chambers will
reach are unknown to this
reviewer. The Resurrection of Eve
has been released in the Bay Area
and will be reported on here soon.
Until that film is reviewed, the
report card on Chambers in
Behind the Green Door ought to
have three D's — debauched,
depraved and delightful.
Pornography, like rock and
roll, is here to stay, contrary to
what Warren Burger or Richard
Nixon have to say about the
subject. Interest in pornography
has always been generated not by
its artistic merits, but by its
appeal to the prurient interest.
The San Francisco area has of
late been attempting to combine
parts of both appeals to make the
ultimate hard-core pornographic
movie.
Taking time out for a brief
definition of terms, pornographic
means having to do with sexual
arousal (although there are many
other kinds of pornography) and
hard-core means showing actual,
not simulated, intercourse.
