# 'Quad' Resumes Publication
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
The Quad, the school yearbook
that suspended publication two years
ago, will resume production this year,
according to Publisher Mason Blacher.
Blacher says he has already raised
some $6000 in donations from various
University offices toward the
yearbook's projected $20,000 budget.
The donations are unrestricted grants
from — among others — the General
Secretary's Office, the President's
Office, and the Athletic Department,
Blacher said.
The Quad has not published since
1971. Although the book still owes
some $6700 in back debts, Blacher
says one of the creditors, Taylor
Publishing Co., has agreed to print this
year's edition. Blacher says the new
Quad crew is making "tentative
arrangements" to repay the money
still owed, including $2300 to Taylor
and $3400 to the ASSU for paying off
a 1970 debt.
Blacher believes that the
outstanding debt was not the major

stumbling block to the yearbook's
resurrection. He blamed the rising tide
of campus unrest, along with previous
Quad managements' "neglect of the
business operation," for the
suspension of publication.
'Confident'
This year, however, Blacher says,
"We're confident we can make a go of
this." He said the Quad staff, which he
hopes will number about 50, will be
entirely volunteer. "Nobody's going to
be paid, nobody's going to earn a
cent," he said.
The book, tentatively set at 320
pages, will sell for $10. Blacher said
the Quad is shooting for sales of at
least 2000 (the last edition, distributed
in June, 1971, sold 1900 copies).
Blacher said the Quad will try to
avoid extras that chip away profits. He
said everybody — including Quad
staffers — will have to pay full price
for the books, and that advertisers
would also be solicited to buy books
at full price.
ASSU Financial Manager Dave

Martin said he didn't know whether
the ASSU would provide back-up
money if Quad sales fell short. "If it
does not seem feasible [to put out the
book], I suppose they'll stop their
effort." However, he noted that
Blacher had already deposited some
$3000 in donations with promises for
more.
Blacher says the loss of half the
Quad's office space in the Storke
Building will be "a difficulty." Last
year, the Daily and Quad Editor Carter
Schellirig agreed to a one-year
arrangement allowing the Daily
business office to take over half the
Quad space and the ASSU typesetting
shop expanded to take over some
space formerly occupied by the Daily.
Blacher notes that next year, the
space reverts to the Quad, and that
"the onus, the burden, is on the
Daily" to attempt to retain the space.
Schelling, in an Aug. 30 letter to
the ASSU Publications Board — which
controls space allocation in the Storke
Building — said he would not support
any Quad efforts to regain the space
before the agreement expires in June
because "a deal is a deal."
However, he said, "we state this
with a special kind of regret because
we suspect that the original Daily
estimates of space needed by their
operations may turn out to seem
exaggerated."
The Daily and the typesetting shop
— which sets the Daily, the Chaparral,
the Arena and several other student
publications — have each spent several
hundred dollars to finance the move.
Daily Editor Jim Wascher said he
hoped the Daily and Quad would be
able to negotiate a mutually
acceptable solution this spring when
the matter comes up for
reconsideration.

would also be solicited to buy books
at full price.
ASSU Financial Manager Dave

Martin said he didn't know whether
the ASSU would provide back-up
money if Quad sales fell short. "If it
does not seem feasible [to put out the
book], I suppose they'll stop their
effort." However, he noted that
Blacher had already deposited some
$3000 in donations with promises for
more.
Blacher says the loss of half the
Quad's office space in the Storke
Building will be "a difficulty." Last
year, the Daily and Quad Editor Carter
Schellirig agreed to a one-year
arrangement allowing the Daily
business office to take over half the
Quad space and the ASSU typesetting
shop expanded to take over some
space formerly occupied by the Daily.
Blacher notes that next year, the
space reverts to the Quad, and that
"the onus, the burden, is on the
Daily" to attempt to retain the space.
Schelling, in an Aug. 30 letter to
the ASSU Publications Board — which
controls space allocation in the Storke
Building — said he would not support
any Quad efforts to regain the space
before the agreement expires in June
because "a deal is a deal."
However, he said, "we state this
with a special kind of regret because
we suspect that the original Daily
estimates of space needed by their
operations may turn out to seem
exaggerated."
The Daily and the typesetting shop
— which sets the Daily, the Chaparral,
the Arena and several other student
publications — have each spent several
hundred dollars to finance the move.
Daily Editor Jim Wascher said he
hoped the Daily and Quad would be
able to negotiate a mutually
acceptable solution this spring when
the matter comes up for
reconsideration.
The Quad, the school yearbook
that suspended publication two years
ago, will resume production this year,
according to Publisher Mason Blacher.
Blacher says he has already raised
some $6000 in donations from various
University offices toward the
yearbook's projected $20,000 budget.
The donations are unrestricted grants
from — among others — the General
Secretary's Office, the President's
Office, and the Athletic Department,
Blacher said.
The Quad has not published since
1971. Although the book still owes
some $6700 in back debts, Blacher
says one of the creditors, Taylor
Publishing Co., has agreed to print this
year's edition. Blacher says the new
Quad crew is making "tentative
arrangements" to repay the money
still owed, including $2300 to Taylor
and $3400 to the ASSU for paying off
a 1970 debt.
Blacher believes that the
outstanding debt was not the major

stumbling block to the yearbook's
resurrection. He blamed the rising tide
of campus unrest, along with previous
Quad managements' "neglect of the
business operation," for the
suspension of publication.
'Confident'
This year, however, Blacher says,
"We're confident we can make a go of
this." He said the Quad staff, which he
hopes will number about 50, will be
entirely volunteer. "Nobody's going to
be paid, nobody's going to earn a
cent," he said.
The book, tentatively set at 320
pages, will sell for $10. Blacher said
the Quad is shooting for sales of at
least 2000 (the last edition, distributed
in June, 1971, sold 1900 copies).
Blacher said the Quad will try to
avoid extras that chip away profits. He
said everybody — including Quad
staffers — will have to pay full price
for the books, and that advertisers
would also be solicited to buy books
at full price.
