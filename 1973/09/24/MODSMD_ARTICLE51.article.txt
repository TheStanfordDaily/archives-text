The Allman Brothers Band:
"Brothers and Sisters,"
(Capricorn CP0111)
In the last several years, the
Allman Brothers Band has
produced some of the finest rock
albums ever made. Their string has
been broken with their newest
release, Brothers and Sisters.
After listening to this album, I
wanted to cry. I just wasn't
prepared for a mediocre Allman
Brothers record.
The first two cuts, "Wasted
Words" and "Ramblin' Man,"
were made before the death of
bassist Berry Oakley, who was
replaced by Lamar Williams on
the rest of the album. Williams is
adequate, but not as melodic a
bass player as Oakley.
Disappointing Addition
Another new member of the
band is Chuck Leavell on piano.
In the past, the piano work was

handled quite well by organist
Gregg Allman.
Leavell was presumably added
in order to have both instruments
in their live performances,
something that was impossible
before. However, his piano
playing really doesn't add much
to this album.
Also present on Brothers and
Sisters is guitarist Les Dudeck,
currently with Boz Scaggs, who
shared the bill with the Allman
Brothers on their recent concert
tour. Listeners have described
Dudeck as sounding enough like
the late Duane Allman to be his
ghost, and his one lead guitar
track on this album is
encouraging.
Dicky Betts' lead guitar has
always been inconsistent; usually
competent, sometimes brilliant.
The same is true on this album.
He is at his best on "Jelly, Jelly,"
the last track on side one, and
"Jessica," one of his compositions
on side two.
Second-Rate Production
Probably the most distressing
thing about this album is the
production, the overall sound.
This is an area in which past
Allman Brothers albums have
been so excellent.
For example, side one of
Idle wild South is a masterpiece of
cohesion of material,
proportioning of vocals and
instruments, and overall unity.
Live at the Fillmore East and the
live portions of Eat a Peach
capture the sheer musical power
of a live performance as well as
any I have heard.
Compared to these, Brothers
and Sisters is a sloppy job.
Everything sounds rough;
whatever instrument is doing the
most interesting thing is often
next to inaudible; and that
something is not loud enough,
regardless of the volume.
Lack of Cohesive Arrangements
Even with better producing,
the quality of the songs on this
album is not up to the band's past
standards. Both Gregg and Betts
have demonstrated far more
ability in melody and arrangement
than appears on this album.

The Allman Brothers Band:
"Brothers and Sisters,"
(Capricorn CP0111)
In the last several years, the
Allman Brothers Band has
produced some of the finest rock
albums ever made. Their string has
been broken with their newest
release, Brothers and Sisters.
After listening to this album, I
wanted to cry. I just wasn't
prepared for a mediocre Allman
Brothers record.
The first two cuts, "Wasted
Words" and "Ramblin' Man,"
were made before the death of
bassist Berry Oakley, who was
replaced by Lamar Williams on
the rest of the album. Williams is
adequate, but not as melodic a
bass player as Oakley.
Disappointing Addition
Another new member of the
band is Chuck Leavell on piano.
In the past, the piano work was

handled quite well by organist
Gregg Allman.
Leavell was presumably added
in order to have both instruments
in their live performances,
something that was impossible
before. However, his piano
playing really doesn't add much
to this album.
Also present on Brothers and
Sisters is guitarist Les Dudeck,
currently with Boz Scaggs, who
shared the bill with the Allman
Brothers on their recent concert
tour. Listeners have described
Dudeck as sounding enough like
the late Duane Allman to be his
ghost, and his one lead guitar
track on this album is
encouraging.
Dicky Betts' lead guitar has
always been inconsistent; usually
competent, sometimes brilliant.
The same is true on this album.
He is at his best on "Jelly, Jelly,"
the last track on side one, and
"Jessica," one of his compositions
on side two.
Second-Rate Production
Probably the most distressing
thing about this album is the
production, the overall sound.
This is an area in which past
Allman Brothers albums have
been so excellent.
For example, side one of
Idle wild South is a masterpiece of
cohesion of material,
