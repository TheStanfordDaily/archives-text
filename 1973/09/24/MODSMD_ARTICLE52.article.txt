# Belly Dancers, Puppets, Clowns, And Crowds
## Tresidder Carnival Initiates Freshmen 
### CHRIS KENRICK 
The Tresidder Carnival was
created and advertised for
freshmen and transfer students.
As expected, probably less than
half of those attending fit that
description.
But no one minded.
Tresidder was at its best
Saturday night as some 2,000
pre-grind pleasure seekers turned
out for a good time.
"Not too much heavy action
here," was an oft-heard remark
during the evening, but the
crowd's ranks continued to swell.
With twenty-five different
attractions performing
simultaneously, it would have
been difficult to walk past them

all and make an exit.
Robyn Goldsmith, a belly
dancer with a boa constrictor,
initially drew the largest — and
predominantly male — audience,
including three nine-year-olds on
sting ray bicycles.
Frosh Make The Scene
Freshmen men arrived and
remained together in small groups,
attentive, amused, and shy. "This
is super funky," sighed one,
unmistakable in a spanking white
Stanford sweatshirt, "even though
it's sorta hard to meet people."
But with countless carnival
diversions, meeting people could
wait.
San Francisco City Clowns
made their way through the

crowd all evening.
In front of the cafeteria, the
San Francisco Street Puppet
Theater charmed enthusiastic
audiences.
Popular Carnival Attractions
Hordes packed the continuous
showings of the Marx Brothers
"Horsefeathers" in the large
lounge.
Downstairs, a more active
crowd jammed the bowling alley
and billiard room for an evening
of free games.
On the back deck, a small,
quieter group practiced folk
dancing.
A floor show inside Dinkelspiel
featured a comedian, a classic
magician act, an impersonator,

and Freaky Ralph — a musical
satirist.
Musical groups, a purple cotton
candy stand, and Artifactory
craftspeople squeezed into empty
spaces outside.
Too Much To Do
Many complained of too much
to do. "This is completely
chaotic," shrieked one freshman
woman.
"That's how we planned it,"
says New Student Orientation
Chairman and carnival
mastermind Mark Cushing.
"Freshman weekend there's
usually not much to do and the
students get kind of bored. I
wanted to give the freshmen a
bizarre, carnival-type thing that

might help to relax them."
Freshmen stood, stared, and
relaxed a little. Not much mixing
of the sexes went on at the
Tresidder Carnival (at 10:30 p.m.,
three of 43 participants in the
billiard room were women). But
then there was Sunday's
Freshman Dance for that.

stage show and meeting each other. These guileful gamblers thought
they could break the house but soon learned that at Stanford, money
goes fast — good preparation for registration day.

wanted to give the freshmen a
bizarre, carnival-type thing that

might help to relax them."
Freshmen stood, stared, and
relaxed a little. Not much mixing
of the sexes went on at the
Tresidder Carnival (at 10:30 p.m.,
three of 43 participants in the
billiard room were women). But
then there was Sunday's
Freshman Dance for that.

DIALING FOR DOLLARS — At Saturday night's carnival for new
students, some won prizes but all had fun watching free movies, a
stage show and meeting each other. These guileful gamblers thought
they could break the house but soon learned that at Stanford, money
goes fast — good preparation for registration day.
The Tresidder Carnival was
created and advertised for
freshmen and transfer students.
As expected, probably less than
half of those attending fit that
description.
But no one minded.
Tresidder was at its best
Saturday night as some 2,000
pre-grind pleasure seekers turned
out for a good time.
"Not too much heavy action
here," was an oft-heard remark
during the evening, but the
crowd's ranks continued to swell.
With twenty-five different
attractions performing
simultaneously, it would have
been difficult to walk past them

all and make an exit.
Robyn Goldsmith, a belly
dancer with a boa constrictor,
initially drew the largest — and
predominantly male — audience,
including three nine-year-olds on
sting ray bicycles.
Frosh Make The Scene
Freshmen men arrived and
remained together in small groups,
attentive, amused, and shy. "This
is super funky," sighed one,
unmistakable in a spanking white
Stanford sweatshirt, "even though
it's sorta hard to meet people."
But with countless carnival
diversions, meeting people could
wait.
San Francisco City Clowns
made their way through the

crowd all evening.
In front of the cafeteria, the
San Francisco Street Puppet
Theater charmed enthusiastic
audiences.
Popular Carnival Attractions
Hordes packed the continuous
showings of the Marx Brothers
"Horsefeathers" in the large
lounge.
Downstairs, a more active
crowd jammed the bowling alley
and billiard room for an evening
of free games.
On the back deck, a small,
quieter group practiced folk
dancing.
A floor show inside Dinkelspiel
featured a comedian, a classic
magician act, an impersonator,

and Freaky Ralph — a musical
satirist.
Musical groups, a purple cotton
candy stand, and Artifactory
craftspeople squeezed into empty
spaces outside.
Too Much To Do
Many complained of too much
to do. "This is completely
chaotic," shrieked one freshman
woman.
"That's how we planned it,"
says New Student Orientation
Chairman and carnival
mastermind Mark Cushing.
"Freshman weekend there's
usually not much to do and the
students get kind of bored. I
wanted to give the freshmen a
bizarre, carnival-type thing that

might help to relax them."
