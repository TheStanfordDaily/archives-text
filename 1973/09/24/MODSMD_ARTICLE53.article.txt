# San Francisco Opera Launches New Season; Excellent Singing Marks Opening Productions

### DOUG SMITH 
SAN FRANCISCO—If the first
three operas presented by the San
Francisco Opera this season are
the norm here, this company
should be counted not just as one
of America's finest but as one of
the greatest anywhere. The 51st
season opened early in September
with a magnificent performance
of La Favorita, Die Fledermaus,
and Rigoletto.
La Favorita is not the best of
Donizetti's 70-odd operas,
and when it was over I could not
remember a single tune to whistle
as I walked to my car. However,
the singing, especially that of
Luciano Pavarotti, was
superlative.
Pavarotti is one of the best
lyric tenors since Caruso. His
voice is incredibly clear, his tones
are ringing, his intonation is
uncannily accurate, his
interpretations are sensitive and
intelligent.
But above and beyond his
extraordinary musicality, he can
soar without apparent effort into
the most astronomical regions and
still produce beautiful sound.
In La Favorita Pavarotti took
some optional notes and floated
above high C several times,
unleashing a storm in the
audience.
The proof of a great opera
company is not how strong the
leading role is cast, but how
strong all of the roles are.
Although the mezzo, Maria Luisa
Nave, compensates for insecure
pitch with an annoying, wide
vibrato, the rest of the cast was
very fine.
Baritone Renato Bruson and
bass Bonaldo Giaiotti were
marvelous, as was Bay Area

soprano Ariel Bybee in the part of
La Favorita's lady in waiting.
Pre-curtain anticipation for Die
Fledermaus (by Johann Strauss,
Jr.) focused on Joan Sutherland's
debut in the role of Rosalinda. As
it turned out, the singing and
antics of Norwegian tenor Ragnar
Ulfung as Alfred and Montana
soprano Judith Blegen as Adele
stole the show.
Iranian director Lotfi
Mansouri, the opera's drama
coach, presumably engineered

many of the antics.
Mansouri made the most of the
stage director's nightmare, a short
tenor and tall soprano. Ulfung
jumped up to place his bouquet of
flowers into the hand at the end
of Sutherland's raised arm, and he
very conspicuously hopped on a
riser behind Sutherland for their
duet.
Blegen not only executed the
coloratura with flawless bravado,
but she proved perfectly
convincing as a stage-struck young

actress, and even entertained with
a few flourishes on a violin.
Walter Slezak was a bit of a
letdown as Frosch, the drunken
jailer, but he elicited a few good
laughs, especially with an allusion
to Watergate: "The best people
are going to jail today. Doctors,
lawyers, politicians."
Sutherland, of course, was
excellent in the role of Rosalinda,
but the rest of the cast was so fine
that she did not stand out.
In Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's new

production of Verdi's Rigoletto,
the spotlight was on the sets and
the drama. Both aspects were
strikingly original, and laden with
sexual symbolism.
The deep red walls of the
Duke's apartment depicted
seduction scenes, the ladies of the
court lasciviously displayed their
thighs during the first scene, and
Gilda and the Duke disappeared
into an enormous bed instead of
an adjacent room in the second
act.
The singing was superb. Here
the standouts were Sherrill Milnes
in the title role and Giacomo
Aragall as the licentious Duke.
Milnes has a big, rich voice and
brought a superlative
characterization to the part. The
role of the Duke, with its
extremely high tessitura, is almost
never sung well, but Aragall had
no apparent problems.
Among the most promising
upcoming operas are Mozart's
Cosi Fan Tutte, Mussorgsky's
Boris Godunov, Wagner's
Tannhauser and Verdi's La
Traviata. Complete schedules are
available at Tresidder ticket
offtee.

brought a superlative
characterization to the part. The
role of the Duke, with its
extremely high tessitura, is almost
never sung well, but Aragall had
no apparent problems.
Among the most promising
upcoming operas are Mozart's
Cosi Fan Tutte, Mussorgsky's
Boris Godunov, Wagner's
Tannhauser and Verdi's La
Traviata. Complete schedules are
available at Tresidder ticket

SAN FRANCISCO—If the first
three operas presented by the San
Francisco Opera this season are
the norm here, this company
should be counted not just as one
of America's finest but as one of
the greatest anywhere. The 51st
season opened early in September
with a magnificent performance
of La Favorita, Die Fledermaus,
and Rigoletto.
La Favorita is not the best of
Donizetti's 70-odd operas,
and when it was over I could not
remember a single tune to whistle
as I walked to my car. However,
the singing, especially that of
Luciano Pavarotti, was
superlative.
Pavarotti is one of the best
lyric tenors since Caruso. His
voice is incredibly clear, his tones
are ringing, his intonation is
uncannily accurate, his
interpretations are sensitive and
intelligent.
But above and beyond his
extraordinary musicality, he can
soar without apparent effort into
the most astronomical regions and
still produce beautiful sound.
In La Favorita Pavarotti took
some optional notes and floated
above high C several times,
unleashing a storm in the
audience.
The proof of a great opera
company is not how strong the
leading role is cast, but how
strong all of the roles are.
Although the mezzo, Maria Luisa
Nave, compensates for insecure
pitch with an annoying, wide
vibrato, the rest of the cast was
very fine.
Baritone Renato Bruson and
bass Bonaldo Giaiotti were
marvelous, as was Bay Area

soprano Ariel Bybee in the part of
La Favorita's lady in waiting.
Pre-curtain anticipation for Die
Fledermaus (by Johann Strauss,
Jr.) focused on Joan Sutherland's
debut in the role of Rosalinda. As
it turned out, the singing and
antics of Norwegian tenor Ragnar
Ulfung as Alfred and Montana
soprano Judith Blegen as Adele
stole the show.
Iranian director Lotfi
Mansouri, the opera's drama
coach, presumably engineered

many of the antics.
Mansouri made the most of the
stage director's nightmare, a short
tenor and tall soprano. Ulfung
jumped up to place his bouquet of
flowers into the hand at the end
of Sutherland's raised arm, and he
very conspicuously hopped on a
riser behind Sutherland for their
duet.
Blegen not only executed the
coloratura with flawless bravado,
but she proved perfectly
convincing as a stage-struck young

actress, and even entertained with
a few flourishes on a violin.
Walter Slezak was a bit of a
letdown as Frosch, the drunken
jailer, but he elicited a few good
laughs, especially with an allusion
to Watergate: "The best people
are going to jail today. Doctors,
lawyers, politicians."
Sutherland, of course, was
excellent in the role of Rosalinda,
but the rest of the cast was so fine
that she did not stand out.
In Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's new

production of Verdi's Rigoletto,
the spotlight was on the sets and
the drama. Both aspects were
strikingly original, and laden with
sexual symbolism.
The deep red walls of the
Duke's apartment depicted
seduction scenes, the ladies of the
court lasciviously displayed their
thighs during the first scene, and
Gilda and the Duke disappeared
into an enormous bed instead of
an adjacent room in the second
act.
The singing was superb. Here
the standouts were Sherrill Milnes
in the title role and Giacomo
Aragall as the licentious Duke.
Milnes has a big, rich voice and
brought a superlative
characterization to the part. The
role of the Duke, with its
extremely high tessitura, is almost
never sung well, but Aragall had
no apparent problems.
Among the most promising
upcoming operas are Mozart's
Cosi Fan Tutte, Mussorgsky's
