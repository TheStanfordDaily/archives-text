# Opera Standees Need Endurance

SAN FRANCISCO—Going to the San Francisco
Opera can be easier than you might think. All
that is necessary are three dollars and some
comfortable shoes.
Because the season is virtually sold out — and
all that remain are some $16 orchestra seats —
you will probably have to stand.
Standing room tickets are sold two hours
before the performance begins, at the Opera's
box office inside the Van Ness Street entrance.
Standees are admitted to the auditorium at 7
p.m. Real aficionados with feet and backs of
steel usually arrive in the afternoon in order to
stake out the best spots.
Lesser mortals arrive at six, buy a ticket, go to
dinner, and return shortly before the
performance begins at 8 p.m. The disadvantage
of this itinerary is that there will be two or three
rows of standees in front of you, which is less of
a problem if you are over six feet tall.
For a very popular performance (for example
Rigoletto or La Traviata on a weekend evening)
there is also a danger that the tickets might sell
out.
Standees stand at the rear of the auditorium
on the main floor level, dress circle, and balcony.
If you dash up to a good spot and leave a scarf or

a program to stake your claim, it will usually be
honored while you leave to have a drink
downstairs or just sit down.
If money is no object and you MUST have a
seat, there is almost always a way to get one.
Arrive one half-hour or 45 minutes early and
there are usually people offering tickets that they
cannot use, for sale at face value.
For less popular operas — Elektra, Peter
Grimes or Don Carlo — student rush may be
available. If any seats are unsold one half-hour
before the performance, the Opera offers them
to students (have your current student body card
ready) for $3.50. You might get a $16 seat. Call
the Opera box office (626-8345) late in the
afternoon to find out if any tickets are left.
Opera attire is varied. On opening night half
of the men were in white tie and tails, but one
character thumbed his nose at the pomp and
wore Dickies overalls over his frilly dress shirt.
By and large, a suit or at least a sport coat and
tie is de rigueur for the men, and a dress or pant
suit is appropriate for the women.
Don't ignore the drinks. The basement level
and the box seat level have full bars with liqueurs,
hard liquor, Irish coffee (at least in the
basement) and champagne. During a long opera
every standee needs some fortification.
