# Mismatch In Michigan
## Vengeful Wolverines Overpower Cards 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
ANN ARBOR — Michigan
football coach Bo Schembechler,
an understandably vengeful man,
didn't want his players to forget
what happened in Pasadena on
New Year's Day, 1972.
So instead of taking his team
to an action-packed Western or
war movie on Friday night,
Schembechler decided to treat the
Wolverines to a showing of his
favorite horror flick — the fourth
quarter of Stanford's 13-12 Rose
Bowl victory over Michigan.
Apparently the Michigan squad
was sufficiently inspired by
Friday night's films. On Saturday
afternoon the hopped-up
Wolverines executed
Schembechler's "basic" plays to
perfection, scoring the first five
times they had the ball and
eventually romping past
Stanford's outmanned Cardinals,
47-10.
It was Stanford's worst defeat
since the 1959 Cardinals suffered
a 55-13 shellacking against UCLA.
And even though the Cards flew
2400 miles westward immediately
following the game, it left coach
Jack Christiansen's struggling

squad considerably farther from
Pasadena than Schembechler's
impressive Wolverines.
Michigan destroyed the Cards
with an attack that used to be
called "three yards and a cloud of
dust" before Michigan and seven
other Big 10 schools replaced the
dust with various artificial
surfaces.
Saturday, the Wolverines
churned over the Michigan
Stadium Tartan-Turf with an
offense that could be more aptly
described as four yards and a pile
of battered bodies.
Opening Drive
After receiving the opening
kickoff, Michigan controlled the
ball for 7:46 on a 16-play,
85-yard drive that was amazingly
efficient if not dazzling. Wolverine
quarterback Dennis Franklin
passed only once during the drive
— completing a 13-yarder to tight
end Paul Seal — but that pass was
merely a momentary diversion
from one of the nation's most
bruising ground games.
Franklin gained 21 yards
himself on keepers and the
remainder of the yardage resulted
from inside runs by fullback Ed
Shuttlesworth and outside dashes
by tailback Chuck Heater, usually
on option-play pitchouts from
Franklin. Heater finally crossed
the goal line on a three-yard run
and it was obvious that Stanford
was in for a long afternoon.
"That first drive was a good
one," Schembechler said while
savoring his victory in a post-game
press conference. "We really went
after 'em."
The Wolverines got a chance to
"go after 'em" again only a
minute later when John
Winesberry fumbled on Stanford's
second play from scrimmage and
Walt Garrison recovered for
Michigan on the Stanford 15.
Shuttlesworth banged over
right guard for the score four
plays later and Mike Lantry's
second left-footed conversion
made it 14-0.
More Mistakes
On the next series things got
even worse for the Cards. After
failing to record a first down,
Stanford lined up to punt. Rudy
Bergthold's snap bounced in front
of punter Tom Lynn and by the

time Lynn recovered the ball, two
Wolverine defenders had already
decided that a punt return
wouldn't be necessary. Lynn was
tackled on the six-yard line and
the inevitable Michigan
touchdown made it 21-0, with the
latter two scores resulting from
suicidal Card miscues deep in their
own territory.
"You can't make two mistakes
like that against Vassar,"
Christiansen said later.
The Card offense recorded a
victory of sorts on the next series
when Mike Boryla completed a
nine-yard pass to Glen Stone for
Stanford's first first down. On the
very next play, however, Don
Coleman intercepted a Boryla pass
on the Cards' 38.
Then it was the defense's turn
for a moral victory. Stanford held
Michigan to four yards on three
plays and the Wolverines had to
settle for a field goal. Lantry
kicked the three-pointer from 50
yards out, eclipsing the old
Michigan record by eight yards.
Late in the second quarter,

Lantry broke his own short-lived
record with a 51-yarder that gave
the Wolverines a 34-0 halftime
lead.
In the second half most of the
80.177 fans concentrated on their
strategy for an early scramble to
the parking lots. Those who
remained attentive to the action
on the field, however, saw two
impressive Stanford scoring
marches.
A 63-yard drive highlighted by
three Boryla to Bill Singler passes
resulted in a 37-yard Rod Garcia
field goal and a 19-yard scoring
pass from Boryla to Reggie
Ishman culminated a 52-yard
Cardinal touchdown march.
But those offensive highlights

couldn't obscure Stanford's
embarrassing rushing total. The
Cards "gained" minus five yards
on the ground, a figure that
represented a three-yard
improvement over last week's
minus eight yard performance
against Penn State.
Still, Schembechler insisted
that Stanford "wasn't that bad.
They've got some talent — I'll tell
you right now that they're much
better than they showed today."
Was the Michigan victory
enough consolation for the 1972
Rose Bowl?
"This was no consolation,"
Schembechler said. "It was nice to
win today but that Rose Bowl
game was a bitter pill to swallow."

Cardinal Notes: Freshmen
continued to play key roles for
the Stanford offense. Gary
Anderson, who celebrated his
18th birthday Saturday, started at
left guard even though his name
wasn't even listed in the official
program or the Stanford press
book.
Frosh quarterback Mike
Cordova wore Jim Plunkett's
number 16 onto the field and was
extremely impressive in his 1:41
of action. The 6-4, 215 pound
high school All-American had runs
of 13 and 12 yards nullified by
penalties, recorded a legitimate
carry of eight yards and passed to
classmate Ron Inge for a 17-yard
gain. Other freshmen to see action
in Michigan were wide receiver
Anthony Hill and guard Alex
Karakozoff.
One Stanford alumnus who
accompanied the team to
Michigan at least found some
solace in the weekend. "One good
thing happened," he said after the
47-10 rout. "I got so enthusiastic
drinking last night that I forgot to
place my bets."

DOC SOCKED — Free safety Doc Blanchard is tackled by two Penn
State defenders after intercepting a Nittany Lion pass in last week's
Stanford opener. The Cards, now 0-2 as a result of losses to Penn
State and Michigan, will try to get in the win column this Saturday
when they meet San Jose State at Stanford Stadium.
