# Shuffling The Cards
## Band Rivalry Mellows 
### Dave Robinson 
ANN ARBOR — "We came back here expecting
the worst," said band manager Doug Peterson, "but
these people have been really nice to us."
Strange as it may seem, the Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band and the Michigan
Marching Band survived five days here without any
battles except the musical ones on the field at
Michigan Stadium.
For those of you who may not remember, the
LSJUMB gained national notoriety at the 1972
Rose Bowl when several members of the Stanford
band ran through the Michigan marching formations
during a practice session, tossed footballs around
and allegedly threw rocks at some of the Michigan
bandsmen.
At about 1:30 that morning, the LSJUMB
serenaded the Michigan band outside Hedrick Hall
with an ear-shattering rendition of "Yellow River"
and several other tunes. Then the LSJUMB almost
got Michigan off to a false start on their Rose Bowl
halftime show by blowing whistles along the
sidelines.
All of which, as any perceptive West Coast
football fan could realize, was purely in fun.
Unfortunately, the Michigan band and some
members of the local press corps didn't understand
the inner workings of the Stanford bandsmen.
"They blew it totally out of proportion,"
Peterson said. 'They made it sound like some sort
of attack on the morals of the country."
Welcome From Cavender
But for some inexplicable reason the Rose Bowl
antics were forgotten when the LSJUMB arrived in
Ann Arbor last week after three days of driving'in a
procession of vans labelled the "Palo Alto Pussy
Posse." George Cavender, an ex-Marine who directs
the Michigan band and constantly implores his
charges to "Pick up those feet. Lock that knee at
the top!", welcomed the Stanford band on arrival.
Arrangements were made to house the LSJUMB
in the University Chapel, of all places. And only a
few water balloon attacks marred two campus

appearances by Stanford's 88-person contingent.
'The rivalry between the two bands has
obviously mellowed," Peterson said. "There is very
little friction anymore."
Of course that doesn't mean that there was no
friction at all. The LSJUMB press release described
the pregame and halftime programs and then said:
"The above has been brought to you by the
Stanford Band, to whom all 1972 Rose Bowl
atrocities and crimes against humanity have been
attributed. At this time, we'd also like to
acknowledge full responsibility for the sinking of
the Titanic, the Korean War and the entire
Watergate incident."
Typical Fun
The band also had some typical LSJUMB fun. On
Friday night they played for the football team at
the Ann Arbor Hilton, staged a brief concert in the
middle of the hotel's dining room and marched
through the halls singing an incredibly obscene
version of the Michigan Fight song.
At the game, the shows came off as expected.
Stanford saluted one of its finest former Rose Bowl
opponents by spelling out "Ohio" with the musical
comment that "It's Too Late" to make up for past
defeats.
The Michigan band, meanwhile, went through
their militaristic marching routines and played such
inspiring songs as "Put On a Happy Face."
"Everyone was perfectly in line — there were no
foulups," Peterson said of Michigan's halftime
performance, "but their show was about as
imaginative as a banana slug in the spring."
Dr. Arthur P. Barnes, director of the Stanford
Band, said that Michigan was "excellent musically.
What they do they do superbly well."
But Barnes also added a thought which could
revolutionize halftime shows in much the same
manner as the forward pass revitalized college
football. "I think," he said after the Michigan
performance, "that you've seen the last of a dying
breed."

The Michigan band, meanwhile, went through
their militaristic marching routines and played such
inspiring songs as "Put On a Happy Face."
"Everyone was perfectly in line — there were no
foulups," Peterson said of Michigan's halftime
performance, "but their show was about as
imaginative as a banana slug in the spring."
Dr. Arthur P. Barnes, director of the Stanford
Band, said that Michigan was "excellent musically.
What they do they do superbly well."
But Barnes also added a thought which could
revolutionize halftime shows in much the same
manner as the forward pass revitalized college
football. "I think," he said after the Michigan
performance, "that you've seen the last of a dying
breed."
ANN ARBOR — "We came back here expecting
the worst," said band manager Doug Peterson, "but
these people have been really nice to us."
Strange as it may seem, the Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band and the Michigan
Marching Band survived five days here without any
battles except the musical ones on the field at
Michigan Stadium.
For those of you who may not remember, the
LSJUMB gained national notoriety at the 1972
Rose Bowl when several members of the Stanford
band ran through the Michigan marching formations
during a practice session, tossed footballs around
and allegedly threw rocks at some of the Michigan
bandsmen.
At about 1:30 that morning, the LSJUMB
serenaded the Michigan band outside Hedrick Hall
with an ear-shattering rendition of "Yellow River"
and several other tunes. Then the LSJUMB almost
got Michigan off to a false start on their Rose Bowl
halftime show by blowing whistles along the
sidelines.
All of which, as any perceptive West Coast
football fan could realize, was purely in fun.
Unfortunately, the Michigan band and some
members of the local press corps didn't understand
the inner workings of the Stanford bandsmen.
"They blew it totally out of proportion,"
Peterson said. 'They made it sound like some sort
of attack on the morals of the country."
Welcome From Cavender
But for some inexplicable reason the Rose Bowl
antics were forgotten when the LSJUMB arrived in
Ann Arbor last week after three days of driving'in a
procession of vans labelled the "Palo Alto Pussy
Posse." George Cavender, an ex-Marine who directs
the Michigan band and constantly implores his
charges to "Pick up those feet. Lock that knee at
the top!", welcomed the Stanford band on arrival.
Arrangements were made to house the LSJUMB
in the University Chapel, of all places. And only a
few water balloon attacks marred two campus

appearances by Stanford's 88-person contingent.
'The rivalry between the two bands has
obviously mellowed," Peterson said. "There is very
little friction anymore."
Of course that doesn't mean that there was no
friction at all. The LSJUMB press release described
the pregame and halftime programs and then said:
"The above has been brought to you by the
Stanford Band, to whom all 1972 Rose Bowl
atrocities and crimes against humanity have been
attributed. At this time, we'd also like to
acknowledge full responsibility for the sinking of
the Titanic, the Korean War and the entire
Watergate incident."
Typical Fun
The band also had some typical LSJUMB fun. On
Friday night they played for the football team at
the Ann Arbor Hilton, staged a brief concert in the
middle of the hotel's dining room and marched
through the halls singing an incredibly obscene
version of the Michigan Fight song.
At the game, the shows came off as expected.
Stanford saluted one of its finest former Rose Bowl
opponents by spelling out "Ohio" with the musical
comment that "It's Too Late" to make up for past
defeats.
