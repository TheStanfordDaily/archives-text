# Pac-8 Roundup
## Conference Teams Struggle 
### 
The football reputation of the
Pacific Eight conference
continued its quick descent
Saturday as only the two Los
Angeles schools won. Adding the
conference's record in season
openers of 1-7 to Saturday's 2-6
mark, Pac-8 schools now have a
dismal combined record of 3-13
thus far.
USC extended its victory
streak to 14 games Saturday,
topping Georgia Tech in Atlanta
23-6.
Lynn Swann led the Trojans by
scoring a pair of touchdowns on a
48-yard punt return and a 15-yard
pass reception from Pat Haden,
but it was really USC's defense
which won the game for the
defending national champions.
USC coach John McKay, who
earlier in the week blasted his
team's "fat cats" for not being in
shape, praised the defense, saying
"when you hold the opposition
without a touchdown for two
straight weeks, your defense has
done a good job."
UCLA avenged its opening
40-13 loss to Nebraska by rolling
over lowa 55-18. As usual, the
Bruins did it all with their ground
game, which gained 405 yards
against only 61 yards in the air.
James McAlister gained 101 yards
in 18 carries while Kermit
Johnson had 87 in 12 carries.
While UCLA continues to pass
sparingly, Oregon State, long
known for its running game, has
turned into an air force. But the
Beavers' attack backfired
Saturday, as SMU intercepted
four of the team's 45 aerials en
route to a 35-16 victory.
The real Air Force turned back
a late Oregon rally to defeat the
Ducks 24-17. The Falcons held a
17-0 lead at one time, but two
quick Oregon touchdowns in the
fourth quarter tied the score

before a Duck fumble led to a
Falcon touchdown in the battle of
the birds.
Washington State's defense
looked impressive against Arizona
State, but the Cougars' inability
to score a touchdown led to a
20-9 defeat.
Alonzo Emery made an
87-yard run in the third quarter to
break what had been a tight game

wide open.
In a see-saw battle, Washington
finally fell to Duke, 23-21, on a
touchdown scored with only 1:37
to play. The Huskies did show an
impressive passing attack, with
quarterbacks Denny Fitzpatrick
and freshman James Anderson
each tossing long touchdown
passes.
Inability to sustain any sort of
offensive attack led to California's
27-7 loss to Illinois. The Golden
Bears gained only 224 yards in the
game.
Illini tailback George
Uremovich ran over Cal, gaining
149 yards in 23 carries. Cal'sonly
standout was Ivan "the Terrible"
Weiss, who made 11 unassisted
tackles, recovered one fumble and
intercepted a pass.
