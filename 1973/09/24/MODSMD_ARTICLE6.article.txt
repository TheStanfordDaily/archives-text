# Figures Say Four Of Five Freshmen Will Graduate
## 
### 
Anyone of the 1502 entering
freshmen, who will be registering along
with 5000 other undergraduates and
5000 graduates today and tomorrow,
stands about a 30 percent better
chance of graduating four years from
now than did an entering freshman in
1921.
So say figures from Associate
Registrar Robert Houghton's office,
which show that some 81.1 percent of
1969's freshman class graduated last
year, compared with 52.9 percent of
members of the 1921 freshman class.
Despite the largest expected
enrollment in Stanford history and the
absence of advance registration last
spring, Houghton says he expects lines
to be shorter this year.
"We will have many more people at
the desks, and we hope to have both

cameras working this year," Houghton
said. He noted that some photos for
identification cards have been taken
over the weekend in an effort to
shorten time-consuming lines.
Houghton urged students to
carefully read the registration
instructions on page two of the new
time schedule.
Commenting that he "expects at
this point to continue" to carry out
advance registration for winter and
spring quarters, Houghton doubted the
possibility of future autumn
pre-regi strati on.
"It's an inefficient, expensive
procedure because only one-third of
the students pre-register in the spring
for fall quarter compared to two-thirds
pre-registering for the other two
quarters."

SCHIZOPHRENIA — If ever a house had cause for mental illness, this one does. First its name was changed — from
Stillman-Grove to Columbae, as part of a living group shuffle. Then it was literally sliced in two so the University could
move it to a new location at the corner of and Campus Drive. Right now it's sitting on stilts, awaiting permanent
emplacement.
