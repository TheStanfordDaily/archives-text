# Opener Turns Off TV Viewers
## Penn State Befuddles Cardinal Offense 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Stanford's offensive line played
as a unit for the first time against
Penn State on Sept. 15, and the
results were just as Nittany Lion
coach Joe Paterno expected.
ftterno had his team stunt,
blitz and otherwise throw chaos
into Stanford's offense to take
advantage of the inexperienced
line.
The result: the Lions stifled
the Cards' running game, harried
their passing game and allowed
only one belated touchdown en
route to a 20-6 win in the
nationally televised season opener.
In the first three quarters, the
Stanford Stadium crowd
estimated at 57,000 had little to
cheer about as the Cardinals
started only one offensive play
from beyond midfield; that after
safety Randy Poltl recoverd a
fumble at the Penn State 16 yard
line late in the first quarter.
But, on the next play,
cornerback Jim Bradley picked
off a Mike Boryla pass, ending the
threat.
Strong Defense
Penn State's offense didn't
exactly decimate Stanford, but
good play by the Lions' defensive
and special teams accounted for
the visitors' first 17 points.
In the second quarter, Lion
linebacker Doug Allen caught
Tom Lynn admittedly taking too
much time on a punt, and blocked
the kick out of the end zone for a
safety.
When Stanford next got the
ball, Scott Laidlaw was hit hard
and fumbled into the arms of

Bradley. Two plays later, Lion
quarterback Tom Shurnan hit
Gary Hayman with a touchdown
pass.
Thereafter, the teams traded
punts (11 by Stanford alone), the
Cans traded yawns and the TV
viewers probably fiddled with
their dials in search of an old
movie or Celebrity Bowling.
Penn State scored its second
touchdown in the third quarter
after a punt return brought the
ball to the Stanford 37. Running
back John Cappelletti, the Lions'
All-American candidate, threw the
first pass of his college career to
the Stanford four, and then
banged over on three straight runs
to the left side.
Chris Bahr kicked a 24-yard
field goal early in the fourth
quarter to complete Penn State's
scoring.
Cappelletti 'Tough'
Cappelletti did most of the
work in second half drives, but
still gained only 79 yards on 26
bruising carries. Stanford star
defensive end Roger Stillwell, who
collided with Cappelletti on
numerous occasions, called his foe
"about as tough a running back as
I've ever seen."
Paterno returned the
compliment, praising Stillwell and
Pat Donovan, the other defensive
end, for shutting off the Lions'
outside running game.
But while the Cards' defense
played reasonably well against one
of the top 10 teams in the nation,
the offense could do nothing until
the fourth quarter, when Boryla
began finding his receivers.

The Cards made two
unsuccessful marches downfield,
one of which got to the Penn
State three before Boryla tripped
over his own guard and lost six
yards.
Then, late in the game, free

safety Doc Blanchard intercepted
a pass in Penn State territory,
Boryla hit Bill Singler for 37 yards
to get to the Lion eight, and then
found tight end Glen Stone in the
end zone for the score.
The try for a two-point
conversion and an onside kick
both failed, and Stanford never
touched the ball again.
In all, the Cardinals lost eight
yards rushing, a figure that
includes nine sacks of Boryla, who
made the team's longest run —
seven yards.
After the game, Stanford's
dejected players took the blame
for the loss.
Boryla admitted he "should
have done a better job in finding"
his receivers.
Stillwell blamed the defense, at
least in part, saying, "if we'd have
played real well, they wouldn't
have scored."
Stone blamed the
inexperienced offensive line: "We
had a lot of mental breakdowns in
blocking assignments... we
weren't holding blocks long
enough."
Coach Jack Christiansen said,
"We had almost no offense.
Instead of going forwards, it went

sideways or backwards."
Christiansen then spent a
sleepless Saturday night pondering
ways of repairing the errant
gearshift.

Cardinal Notes: Penn State
coach Paterno gave his players a
night on the town in San
Francisco after the game, warning
them to "watch out for go-go
girls."
Paterno praised Stanford's
strong safety, then changed his
mind when he learned the
defensive back's name was Randy
Poltl. "I thought it was Poletti,"
Paterno quipped. "If he's not
Italian I take it all back."
Freshman Anthony Hill, who
marked his seventeenth birthday
in June, caught two passes during
his varsity debut for the Cards.
However, Hill said, "I really didn't
feel any pressure out there. It
wasn't as physical as I expected."
Stanford opens its next three
seasons at Penn State. Stanford
reportedly requested the unusual
scheduling so it can take a trip
east every year.
Stanford's opening day crowd
of about 57,000 was a very good
turnout for so early in the year,
but some fans didn't get there in
time for the kickoff. It seems that
tickets printed a 1:30 starting
time, but the game was moved up
to 12:50 on ABC's request.
