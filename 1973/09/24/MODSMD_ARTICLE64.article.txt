# New Stadium Fence Irks Fun-Loving Stanford Fans
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Those fans who were fortunate enough to miss
Stanford's 20-6 loss to Penn State may not be aware
that a six-foot high cyclone fence has been
constructed at field level around the entire stadium.
Former Band bigwig Dean Smith said that "the
fence adds significantly to the beauty of the place,"
but later admitted that he was lying. Another old
hand with the Band spoke knowingly of Mongol
hordes descending upon the stadium to tear down
the fences.
When asked why the Athletic Department had
erected the fence, Sports Information Director Bob
Murphy smiled and said: "Some people in this
department are always looking for something to
do." Murphy then grumbled something about
"interfering with the spirit of football" and stalked
off to find Bud Wilkinson.
Most other reactions to the construction of the
fence were unprintable in a family newspaper.
Associate Athletic Director Robert Young
authorized construction of the fence at a cost of
$4200 because "we were having great security
problems on the field and a lot of that we think was

coming from the YMCA's Junior Rooters section."
Young explained that the University is "liable for
anybody who's injured in that stadium. We had
some minor injuries last year and we were just lucky
that they weren't more serious."
Approximately 40 off-duty Santa Clara County
Sheriffs deputies will supplement the security for
the field perimeter. Each deputy will wear a red
"Stanford Athletic Event Security" windbreaker,
will be unarmed, but will carry handcuffs.
The primary targets for those fans who ran onto
the field in the past were the wooden goalposts at
either end of the field. Over the summer, however,
the Athletic Department installed single-post,
aluminum goal posts greased with STP.
Football coach Jack Christiansen said, "From my
standpoint as a coach, I think the fences are great in
terms of keeping people off the field. I'd like to see
the team get off the field in one piece without
getting stepped on."
Christiansen did not explain how an 11 year-old
junior rooter would go about "stepping on" Roger
Stillwell, but anyone who could scale a greased
metal goal post and tear it down while evading 40
Sheriffs deputies could probably find a way.
