# Mayer, Hencken Pace Globetrotting Card Athletes
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON VLAE KERSHNER 
Competing without the aid of the band, the
dollies or screaming Stanford fans, several
Cardinal athletes braved the real world this
summer in a variety of athletic endeavors.
And even though college sports purists like
Chris Schenkel might find the absence of those
incentives upsetting, Stanford's individuals did
quite well on their own this summer, ranging
from Sandy Mayer's much-publicized Wimbledon
heroics to more modest but equally gratifying
victories by lesser-known Cardinal athletes.
The following is a summary of Stanford's
summer sports accomplishments:
Tennis
Stanford tennis players won all the major
amateur titles the game has to offer this summer.
Highlighting the summer was the emergence
of senior Alex (Sandy) Mayer as one of the
world's best players. Mayer, after winning the
NCAA singles championship in June and leading
the Cards to their first national championship in
any sport since 1967, catapulted into
international fame at Wimbledon.
Mayer shocked Ilie Nastase of Rumania,
first-seeded in the English tourney and ranked
second among all players in the world last year,
beating him 6-4, 8-6, 6-8, 6-4. Mayer used
quickness and deep service returns to defeat his
highly-regarded foe.
Then, in the quarterfinals of Wimbledon,
which was boycotted by most professionals from
non-Communist countries, Mayer beat West
Germany's Jurgen Fassbender 3-6, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4,
6-4 in an amazing comeback win.
However, the odyssey of the 21-year old
senior came to an end ir. the semifinals, when
Mayer lost to Russia's Alex Metreveli, 6-3, 3-6,
6-3, 6-4. Metreveli lost the Wimbledon
championship to Czechoslovakia's Jan Kodes the
next day.
Mayer continued his European tour by
winning the Bavarian Open in Munich. The
Stanford star downed West Germany's Harald
Elschenbroich in the finals 6-4, 6-3, 6-3.
Mayer and doubles partner Rick Fisher,
captain of last year's Cardinal tennis team as a
senior, finished second in the Bavarian Open
doubles event.
Fisher reached the semifinals at the NCAA
championship at Princeton, N.J., in June, before
being beaten by Raul Ramirez of USC, who
Mayer then beat for the title.
Mayer, Fisher and junior Jim Delaney, who
teamed with Mayer for the NCAA doubles title,
all won All-American honors.
Delaney also scored a major success later in
the summer, winning the men's U.S. amateur
title in Southampton, N.Y. in August. Delaney,
seeded only eighth, beat Nick Saviano, who
enters Stanford this fall, in the finals, 6-4, 7-6,
6-1.
Saviano reached the finals by beating USC star
John Andrews, who once beat Mayer, by a 6-4,
6-1, 6-7, 7-6 score. Delaney topped Stanford
sophomore John Whitlinger 6-4, 7-5, 6-1 in the
semifinals. Junior Chip Fisher also teached the
quarter finals of the Stanford-dominated
tournament.
In the doubles event, Pat DuPre, fourth-best
player on last year's Stanford varsity, teamed

two in-depth articles on the goodwill tours of the
People's Republic of China made this summer by
swimming coach Jim Gaughran, swim captain
Brian Job and basketball star Rich Kelley.

with Victor Amaya of Michigan to win the
crown.
DuPre also won a national singles
championship, this in the U.S. Amateur clay
court championships in July.
Another player who did well was Gene Mayer,
Sandy's younger brother, who joins Saviano as an
incoming freshman tennis scholarship winner.
The younger Mayer teamed with Tom Kreiss
to win the doubles title at the Western Open
Junior Championships in Springfield, Ohio,
defeating Saviano and Peter Fleming in the finals.
Both Mayer and Saviano lost in the singles event
to Billy Martin, the eventual champion.
Several Stanford players capped off their
summer by playing in the prestigious U.S. Open
at Forest Hills, N.Y. Only one Stanford men's
tennis player survived the first round, Mayer
having to default his opening match due to an
ankle injury.
Delaney, who beat Ivan Molina of Colombia
in the opening round, met John Newcombe of
Australia, the eventual men's champion, in the
second round, and surprised the fans by
appearing in torn T-shirt. "Zany" Delaney
surprised again by forcing Newcombe into a first
set tiebreaker before losing 7-6, 6-3, 6-3.
Incoming freshman Marcy O'Keefe competed
in the Forest Hills' women's event, winning her
first round match against England's Lindsay
Beaven before bowing to South Africa's liana
Kloss.
Swimming
e John Hencken continued his reign as the
e world's premier breastroker this summer.
y The Stanford sophomore, a 1972 Olumpic
n gold medalist at 200 meters, set a world record in
the 100 meter event at the World Aquatic
_ Championships at Belgrade, Yugoslavia.

Hencken's time of 1:04.2 in the finals eclipsed
his own previous world record, set at the AAU
longcourse championships in Louisville, Kentucky,
earlier in the summer.
Hencken also set a world record in the 200
meter breaststroke at Kentucy, and bettered that
time in Belgrade, recording a 2:19.9. However,
David Wilkie of England beat Hencken in that
race to establish his own world record.
Brian Roux, an incoming freshman from
Cupertino, finished fourth at the AAU meet in
the 100 meter butterfly, recording an excellent
52.9 time.
Sprinter Dean Anderson was Stanford's
representative at the World University Games in
Moscow, and finished third in the 100 meter
freestyle as well as participating on the winning
400 meter freestyle relay.
Swim coach Jim Gaughran, who, along with
Brian Job, former Cardinal breaststroke star,
spent the summer touring the People's Republic
of China, also complimented the swimming of
sophomore Bruce Goodwin. Goodwin improved
on his lifetime bests in the longcourse 100 and
200, swimming the 200 in 1:57.
Golf
When Dave Baskins arrived at Toledo, Ohio
for the U.S. Amateur golf tournament this
summer, he was one of the least recognizable
faces in the mammouth field of 200. But after
Baskins upset Walker Cupper Mark Pfeil in the
second round of the prestigious event, his name
suddenly appeared on the leader boards and
throughout the national media.
Baskins, who along with teammate Conrad
Nilneier had earned honorable mention
All-American recognition for his performance
during the past college season, won his trip to the
nationals by firing rounds of 76-70 in the local

qualifying at Silverado Country Club in Napa.
Baskins' 146 total was the pacesetting figure in
the Napa qualifying.
Earlier in the summer, he was Stanford's only
individual to survive the 36-hole cut at the
NCAA tournament at Stillwater, Okla. The
Cardinal team, however, finished a very
disappointing 28th in the nation.
Once at Toledo, Baskins drew a first round
bye and was rated a definite underdog when he
teed off against Pfeil in the second round. But
Pfeil, one of the pre-tournament favorites on the
basis of his selection to the Walker Cup team and
a match play victory two weeks earlier over
three-time NCAA champion Ben Crenshaw,
suffered three double bogies and lost to the
steady Baskins, 2 and 1.
The following day Baskins once again played
superb golf, but his one under par performance
wasn't enough against Richard Strawn of
Concord, N.C. Strawn who eventually lost to
USC's Craig Stadler in the finals after recording
an impressive 6 and 5 victory over 55 year-old
veteran Bill Campbell in the semis, ended Baskins
stay in Toledo with a 3 and 2 third round
victory.
Another Stanford golfer also qualified for the
nationals. Incoming freshman Glenn Goethels
was eliminated in the second round of
competition after surviving the local qualifying
test near his home town of Princeton, N.J.
Several members of the Cardinal varsity
excelled in local and state tournaments. Junior
Bob Chapman won the 62nd Michigan Amateur
championship with a 5 and 3 victory over Dr.
Wayne Kramer in the final match. Using a putter
he borrowed from Stanford teammate Aly
Trompas, Chapman was devastating on the greens
throughout the five days of the tournament.
Defending North Dakota Amateur champion

Gary Hamblef, also a Stan ord junior, came
within one shot of making it two in a roO at the
1973 North Dakota tourney. Hamblet reached
the final round but lost 1 up in a 20-hole thriller.
Conrad Nilmeier won the Kings River
Invitational in Fresno and also finished second in
the California State Fair tournament at
Sacramento. Nilmeier carded rounds of 71-67-72
in the latter event.
Aly Trompas and 1973 Stanford graduate
John Beers teamed in the Stanford Invitational
best-ball tournament and tied for first before
losing a sudden death playoff for the
championship.
Baseball
Coach Ray Young and seven members of his
varsity baseball team escaped the heat in Alaska
this summer. Young's Anchorage ballclub
compiled a 41-19 record in semi-pro
competition, including a third place finish in the
National Baseball Congress tournament at
Wichita, Kansas. Cardinal stars Dave Baker, A 1
Arthur, Dave Frost, Bob DiPietro and Ken Grolle
all played for Anchorage and Baker was an
AU-American selection at the NBC tourney.
Meanwhile, Bruce Robinson and Mark Lucich
played even closer to the North Pole at
Fairbanks. Lucich belted the ball at a .380 clip
for the Fairbanks team, which won its second
straight national championship at Wichita.
Fairbanks defeated Liberal, Kansas, 10-6, in the
final game.
Steve Davis, Ed Orrizzi, Max Goldstein, Mike
Williamson and Gary Morton also played in
various semi-pro leagues this summer, but the
most serious baseball was played by junior
varsity coach Mark Marquess. Marquess batted
.290 for the lowa Oaks, a Triple-A minor league
affiliate of the Chicago White Sox. lowa won the
American Association pennant in a playoff
against Tulsa.
Basketball
Rich Kelley spent the early part of his
summer on a goodwill basketball tour of the
People's Republic of China. Kelley, Stanford's
talented seven-footer who earned first team
All-League recognition as a sophomore last
season, was one of 12 college All-Stars selected
by Memphis State coach Gene Bartow to make
the historic trip to China.
The United States team won all eight games
on its tour, defeating Chinese opposition by
margins ranging from 19 to 37 points. Kelley
contributed a 9.1 scoring average to the balanced
U.S. offense and also pulled down 53 rebounds
and shot 58 percent from the field. Ronnie
Robinson of Memphis State led the Americans in
scoring with a 13.0 average.
Robinson, Kelley, George Karl of North
Carolina, Quinn Buckner of Indiana and Kevin
Grevey of Kentucy comprised the U.S. starting
five.
Track and Field
Ken Kring and Terry Albritton both recorded
victories for the United States in international
competition this summer.
Kring earned two gold medals at the
Maccabiah Games in Tel Aviv, Israel, winning the
10-event decathlon competition in addition to an
individual event victory in the pole vault.
Albritton, who set the all-time Stanford shot
put record of as a freshman last year,
toured Europe with the AAU junior team.
Albritton was undefeated in the shot put as the
U.S. rolled over junior teams from West Germany
and Poland and recorded a 123-108 upset victory
over the U.S.S.R.

SUMMER HEROES—Sandy Mayer (left) and John Hencken highlighted a productive summer for Stanford athletics. Mayer, who won the NCAA singles
title in June as the Cards captured their first national tennis championship, received international acclaim two weeks later by reaching the semifinals at
Wimbledon. Hencken, the 1972 Olympic gold medalist in the 200 meter breastroke set a new world record in the 100 meter event last month, clocking
1:04.2 at the World Aquatic Championships in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
