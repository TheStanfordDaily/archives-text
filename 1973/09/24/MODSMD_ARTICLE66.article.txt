# Hearings Resume Today After Seven Weeks
## Watergate Witness List Trimmed To Meet Nov. 1 Deadline 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Sen. Sam J.
Ervin Jr.'s select committee takes up
the Watergate hearings today where
they left off seven weeks ago, but the
initiative in the investigation seems to
have passed to special prosecutor
Archibald Cox.
The Senate committee, trimming its
witness list and trying to meet a
self-imposed Nov. 1 deadline, has only
E. Howard Hunt scheduled before it
ends phase one — the broad look into
the Democratic headquarters break-in,
what led to it and how it was covered
up.
Hunt, one of seven convicted
Watergate conspirators, is to testify
today. (A profile on Hunt may be
found on this page.)
Following Hunt, the committee has
scheduled John Ragan, a former FBI
man and one-time Republican security
consultant; White House speechwriter
Patrick J. Buchanan and former
presidential law-enforcement aide
John J. Caulfield, who has testified
before.
They are the opening witnesses in
the so-called dirty tricks phase of the
hearings.
Cox Investigation
The Cox investigation has deprived
the committee — at least temporarily
— of a major witness, former White
House special counsel Charles W.
Colson.
Colson told the committee in
closed session last Wednesday that he
is under investigation in connection
with the burglary of the office of
Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist.
When he was refused immunity for
his testimony by the Senate panel,
Colson invoked his Fifth Amendment
rights against self-incrimination.
Committee Halted
Because Cox's federal investigators
are looking into the Ellsberg affair, the
committee won't go any further in
that area.
The U.S. Court of Appeals, having
failed in its efforts for a compromise
in the Nixon tape recordings
controversy, is deliberating its ruling.
The case pits Cox against White House
lawyer Charles Alan Wright in a battle
over Watergate-related recordings.
The court had hoped to avoid
making a constitutional finding by

suggesting that the two sides agree to
allow Cox to hear the tapes of
President Nixon's conversations. But
on Thursday both sides said three days
of meetings had been fruitless.
Committee Lawsuit
Meanwhile, the Senate committee's
lawsuit to obtain White House
recordings is yet to be decided in
district court.
Last Monday Hunt followed the
lead of four other Watergate
defendants. He asked that the guilty
plea he made in January be
withdrawn. He also asked the judge to
drop all charges, saying he took part in
the Watergate break-in because he
believed the operation was "at the
direction of high government officials
and with assurance . . . that the acts
were lawful."
Thursday, Henry B. Rothblatt, the
lawyer who represented Bernard L.
Barker, Eugenio R. Martinez, Virgilio
R. Gonzales and Frank Sturgis until
they pleaded guilty, filed a $10 million
suit against President Nixon and others

claiming they coerced his clients into
making the pleas.
Yet another suit, filed by the
National Citizens' Committee for
Fairness to the Presidency, Inc., was
dismissed Friday by a federal judge.
The committee sought to prevent the
Senate committee from resuming its
hearings.

over Watergate-related recordings.
The court had hoped to avoid
making a constitutional finding by

suggesting that the two sides agree to
allow Cox to hear the tapes of
President Nixon's conversations. But
on Thursday both sides said three days
of meetings had been fruitless.
Committee Lawsuit
Meanwhile, the Senate committee's
lawsuit to obtain White House
recordings is yet to be decided in
district court.
Last Monday Hunt followed the
lead of four other Watergate
defendants. He asked that the guilty
plea he made in January be
withdrawn. He also asked the judge to
drop all charges, saying he took part in
the Watergate break-in because he
believed the operation was "at the
direction of high government officials
and with assurance . . . that the acts
were lawful."
Thursday, Henry B. Rothblatt, the
lawyer who represented Bernard L.
Barker, Eugenio R. Martinez, Virgilio
R. Gonzales and Frank Sturgis until
they pleaded guilty, filed a $10 million
suit against President Nixon and others

claiming they coerced his clients into
making the pleas.
Yet another suit, filed by the
National Citizens' Committee for
Fairness to the Presidency, Inc., was
dismissed Friday by a federal judge.
The committee sought to prevent the
Senate committee from resuming its
hearings.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Sen. Sam J.
Ervin Jr.'s select committee takes up
the Watergate hearings today where
they left off seven weeks ago, but the
initiative in the investigation seems to
have passed to special prosecutor
Archibald Cox.
The Senate committee, trimming its
witness list and trying to meet a
self-imposed Nov. 1 deadline, has only
E. Howard Hunt scheduled before it
ends phase one — the broad look into
the Democratic headquarters break-in,
what led to it and how it was covered
up.
Hunt, one of seven convicted
Watergate conspirators, is to testify
today. (A profile on Hunt may be
found on this page.)
Following Hunt, the committee has
scheduled John Ragan, a former FBI
man and one-time Republican security
consultant; White House speechwriter
Patrick J. Buchanan and former
presidential law-enforcement aide
John J. Caulfield, who has testified
before.
They are the opening witnesses in
the so-called dirty tricks phase of the
hearings.
Cox Investigation
The Cox investigation has deprived
the committee — at least temporarily
— of a major witness, former White
House special counsel Charles W.
Colson.
Colson told the committee in
closed session last Wednesday that he
is under investigation in connection
with the burglary of the office of
Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist.
When he was refused immunity for
his testimony by the Senate panel,
Colson invoked his Fifth Amendment
rights against self-incrimination.
Committee Halted
Because Cox's federal investigators
are looking into the Ellsberg affair, the
committee won't go any further in
that area.
The U.S. Court of Appeals, having
failed in its efforts for a compromise
in the Nixon tape recordings
controversy, is deliberating its ruling.
The case pits Cox against White House
lawyer Charles Alan Wright in a battle
over Watergate-related recordings.

making a constitutional finding by

suggesting that the two sides agree to
allow Cox to hear the tapes of
President Nixon's conversations. But
on Thursday both sides said three days
