# Hunt's Downfall Brought On By Colson
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - E. Howard Hunt's
downfall began when his friend Charles W.
Colson got him a job with the White House
plumbers unit.
They met in the mid-1960s when Colson was
president and Hunt was vice president of the
Brown University alumni club. In June 1971
Colson arranged the job for Hunt with the
plumbers who were supposed to plug news
leaks to the press.
A year and a half later Hunt pleaded guilty
to wiretapping, burglary and conspiracy charges
arising from the Watergate break-in.
In the meantime, Hunt dabbled in forgery,
bungled direction of a burglary at Daniel
Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office, poked into the
ITT and Chappaquiddick affairs and paid a
college student to spy on Democratic Sens.
Edmund S. Muskie and George S. McGovern.
The White House still won't disclose some of
the things Hunt did, contending that to do so
would damage national security.
Hunt Testifies
Today Hunt is scheduled to testify before
the Senate Watergate committee under

immunity from further prosecution.
Colson, who failed to get immunity, has
refused to testify on grounds he might tend to
incriminate himself. But he says he is innocent
of any wrongdoing.
Hunt, 55, was born in Hamburg, N.Y.,
graduated from Brown in 1940, attended the
Naval Academy briefly and saw service in China
in World War 11.
Joins CIA
After stints as a screenwriter and editorialist,
he joined the Central Intelligence Agency in
1949. Former CIA Director Richard M. Helms
says there sometimes were questions about the
effectiveness of Hunt's work, but never any
suggestion of wrongdoing.
"Mr. Hunt was a bit of a romantic. He used
to write books in his spare time, and I think
there was a tendency sometimes for him to get
a little bit carried away with some of the things
he was involved in," Helms told the Ervin
Committee.
Seeking more money, Hunt retired from the
CIA in 1970 and took a job at a public relations
firm. He kept up his contact with Colson, who

was by then President Nixon's special counsel,
and who had a reputation as the
administration's specialist in political dirty
tricks.
'Nail' Ellsberg Effort
In 1971, shortly after the Supreme Court
refused to bar newspapers from further
publication of the Pentagon Papers, Hunt and
Colson spoke on the telephone about how to
"nail" Daniel Ellsberg, the man who said he
gave the top-secret documents to newsmen.
Hunt told Colson he thought he could discredit
Ellsberg publicly, given the proper resources.
A recording of the telephone call is now in
the hands of Senate investigators. Soon after
the call, Colson recommended that Hunt be
hired. He was.
Within three months, according to Hunt's
own grand jury testimony, he helped fellow
plumber G. Gordon Liddy direct the burglary
at the office of Ellsberg's psychiatrist. The
burglars apparently failed to find Ellsbere's
records.
By early 1972 Liddy had moved to the

President's re-election committee, where he was
trying to get approval for plans, among other
things, to wiretap Democrats. Hunt took him to
see Colson, who interceded.
Colson called campaign deputy Jeb Stuart
Magruder and urged that Liddy's plans be
considered. Hunt and Liddy stood by his side
while he made the call. Magruder says the
Colson call led him to believe the wiretapping
plan had White House approval. Colson now
says he didn't know Liddy's plans included
wiretapping.
By all accounts the wiretapping was no more
successful than Hunt's earlier efforts. On June
17, when the burglary crew went back into the
Watergate building for another try, five were
• aught. Evidence in their possession soon led to
Hunt and Liddy, who were indicted with the
rest in September 1972, at the height of the
presidential election campaign.
Conduits For Payoffs
According to Senate testimony, both Hunt's
wife and his lawyer acted as conduits for payoff
money from White House sources, money said
by some to have been Hunt's price for silence.

Within three months, according to Hunt's
own grand jury testimony, he helped fellow
plumber G. Gordon Liddy direct the burglary
at the office of Ellsberg's psychiatrist. The
burglars apparently failed to find Ellsbere's
records.
By early 1972 Liddy had moved to the

President's re-election committee, where he was
trying to get approval for plans, among other
things, to wiretap Democrats. Hunt took him to
see Colson, who interceded.
Colson called campaign deputy Jeb Stuart
Magruder and urged that Liddy's plans be
considered. Hunt and Liddy stood by his side
while he made the call. Magruder says the
Colson call led him to believe the wiretapping
plan had White House approval. Colson now
says he didn't know Liddy's plans included
wiretapping.
By all accounts the wiretapping was no more
successful than Hunt's earlier efforts. On June

Conduits For Payoffs
According to Senate testimony, both Hunt's

money from White House sources, money said
by some to have been Hunt's price for silence.
WASHINGTON (AP) - E. Howard Hunt's
downfall began when his friend Charles W.
Colson got him a job with the White House
plumbers unit.
They met in the mid-1960s when Colson was
president and Hunt was vice president of the
Brown University alumni club. In June 1971
Colson arranged the job for Hunt with the
plumbers who were supposed to plug news
leaks to the press.
A year and a half later Hunt pleaded guilty
to wiretapping, burglary and conspiracy charges
arising from the Watergate break-in.
In the meantime, Hunt dabbled in forgery,
bungled direction of a burglary at Daniel
Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office, poked into the
ITT and Chappaquiddick affairs and paid a
college student to spy on Democratic Sens.
Edmund S. Muskie and George S. McGovern.
The White House still won't disclose some of
the things Hunt did, contending that to do so
would damage national security.
Hunt Testifies
Today Hunt is scheduled to testify before
the Senate Watergate committee under

immunity from further prosecution.
Colson, who failed to get immunity, has
refused to testify on grounds he might tend to
incriminate himself. But he says he is innocent
of any wrongdoing.
Hunt, 55, was born in Hamburg, N.Y.,
graduated from Brown in 1940, attended the
Naval Academy briefly and saw service in China
in World War 11.
Joins CIA
After stints as a screenwriter and editorialist,
he joined the Central Intelligence Agency in
1949. Former CIA Director Richard M. Helms
says there sometimes were questions about the
effectiveness of Hunt's work, but never any
suggestion of wrongdoing.
"Mr. Hunt was a bit of a romantic. He used
to write books in his spare time, and I think
there was a tendency sometimes for him to get
a little bit carried away with some of the things
he was involved in," Helms told the Ervin
Committee.
Seeking more money, Hunt retired from the
CIA in 1970 and took a job at a public relations
firm. He kept up his contact with Colson, who

was by then President Nixon's special counsel,
and who had a reputation as the
administration's specialist in political dirty
tricks.
