# U.S. Intervention With Chile
## Indirect Involvement Topples Allende 
### 
Silvia Arrom

Although the military coup
which overthrew the
constitutional government of
Chile on September 11 was no
surprise, no one anticipated the
bloody repression that has
followed. During its first week in
power, the military brutally
attempted to crush all resistance:
it bombed and machine-gunned
squatter settlements, factories,
and the University of Chile. It
executed resisters on the spot,
arrested thousands of political
opponents and exiles from
neighboring dictatorships, and is
allegedly torturing them in
detention centers. It is carrying
out house to house searches and
even book burnings. Some 5,200
civilians are now awaiting trial by
the military. Estimates of the first
week's death toll alone range from
an official 97 to more than
15,000.
What brought about the
downfall of the popularly elected
government of Chile? What caused
the right-wing Chileans and the
military to violate a long tradition
of respect for democratic
institutions — a tradition which
distinguished Chile from other
Latin American countries?
From the time Salvador
Allende became the first elected
Marxist President in the Western
Hemisphere, he continued an
existing agrarian reform program,
nationalized U.S. copper
companies, expanded state
control over factories, and
instituted numerous projects for
government housing, education,
and welfare. Most of these
measures met with considerable
popular approval. Support for the
Popular Unity government
increased from 36% to 44% in the
last three years, but its opposition
also became more intransigent. In
the months preceding the coup,
Chile was completely polarized
between left and right. Many
Chileans opposed President
Allende on ideological grounds, or
found him going too far, too fast.
But the crucial element in
swinging the balance against him
— and in convincing the military
to intervene — was the economic
and political disorder during the
last year of his administration:
inflation was estimated at 1% a
day in the last months, there were
shortages of some essential
commodities, a deadlock in
Congress, and, finally, right-wing
strikes and sabotage. President
Allende's policies contributed to
the inflation, but even more, it
was the actions of right-wing
Chileans and of the United States
which caused the economic and

political disruption.
The U.S. officially denied any
participation in the events of the
coup. Well substantiated evidence
of C.I.A. involvement in Chile and
reports of unusual U.S. military
and diplomatic activities in the
days preceding the coup indicate
that this is not so. But overt U.S.
involvement in the coup itself is
not there crucial question. The
United States had been involved
in preparation for the coup for
three years. As the San Francisco
Examiner reported (Sept. 16),
"the U.S. strangled Allende rule."
The Chilean coup is a revealing
example of Nixon's "low-profile"
policy. It shows that direct
intervention is not necessary to
topple a government.
The United States' military and
economic policies were designed
to weaken President Allende's
government and to strengthen his
opposition. As soon as Allende
took office, U.S. economic aid to
Chile, which had been one of the
highest in Latin America, dropped
drastically. (Aid to Frei's
government ranged from $25 to
$82 million a year and fell to $8.7
in 1971.) The U.S. banned certain
Chilean imports and moved to
deny credit to President Allende,
but Chile was still left with a huge
debt to pay on loans granted to
Frei's government. In addition,
U.S. companies were involved in
imposing an economic blockade
on Chile. The copper companies
embargoed Chilean copper, ITT
pressured private banks and
corporations to curtail operations
in Chile, and necessary goods and
replacement parts for U.S. made
vehicles and machinery were
denied to Chile.
Encouragement
At the same time as the U.S.
government acted to encourage
economic chaos, it granted larger
amounts of military aid to Chile
than ever before in an effort to
build up anti-Allende elements in
the Armed Forces. The year
Allende took office U.S. military
aid to Chile climbed from
$800,000 to $5.7 million and to
$12.3 million in 1972. Last year
alone the Pentagon spent more
money training Chilean officers
than it did on any other Latin
American country. It was U.S.
equipment which bombed the
National Palace and the civilian
population. Without U.S. military
aid the Chilean military simply
would not have had the power to
carry out a successful coup.
By actively undermining the
duly elected government of Chile,

which never overstepped its legal
bounds, the United States has
dealt a crippling blow to
democratic government in Latin
America. We as Americans share
the responsibility for the Chilean
tragedy, and we must demonstrate
our concern. We urge you to:
(1) Write, cable, or phone your
senators (Stanford representatives
are: Senator Alan Cranston, Sen.
John Tunney, Wash. D.C. 20510;
Congressman Paul McCloskey,
Wash., D.C. 20515), and Sen.
Fulbright, Chairman, Senate
Foreign Relations Committee;
Rep. Dante Fascell,
Subcommittee on Inter-American
Affairs, House of Representatives,
Wash., D.C. Urge them to a)
withhold all military and
economic aid and recognition
from the military junta or any

illegal government they may
subsequently install, b) take
immediate steps to prevent the
killing and repression of political
prisoners, members of the
opposition, and foreign exiles, c)
call for an investigation of the
U.S. government and
corporations' role in the Chilean
tragedy.
(2) Come to a Teach-in on

Chile on September 11 was no
surprise, no one anticipated the
bloody repression that has
followed. During its first week in
power, the military brutally
attempted to crush all resistance:
it bombed and machine-gunned
squatter settlements, factories,
and the University of Chile. It
executed resisters on the spot,
arrested thousands of political
opponents and exiles from
neighboring dictatorships, and is
allegedly torturing them in
detention centers. It is carrying
out house to house searches and
even book burnings. Some 5,200
civilians are now awaiting trial by
the military. Estimates of the first
week's death toll alone range from
an official 97 to more than
15,000.
What brought about the
downfall of the popularly elected
government of Chile? What caused
the right-wing Chileans and the
military to violate a long tradition
of respect for democratic
institutions — a tradition which
distinguished Chile from other
Latin American countries?
From the time Salvador
Allende became the first elected
Marxist President in the Western
Hemisphere, he continued an
existing agrarian reform program,
nationalized U.S. copper
companies, expanded state
control over factories, and
instituted numerous projects for
government housing, education,
and welfare. Most of these
measures met with considerable
popular approval. Support for the
Popular Unity government
increased from 36% to 44% in the
last three years, but its opposition
also became more intransigent. In
the months preceding the coup,
Chile was completely polarized
between left and right. Many
Chileans opposed President
Allende on ideological grounds, or
found him going too far, too fast.
But the crucial element in
swinging the balance against him
— and in convincing the military
to intervene — was the economic
and political disorder during the
last year of his administration:
inflation was estimated at 1% a
day in the last months, there were
shortages of some essential
commodities, a deadlock in
Congress, and, finally, right-wing
strikes and sabotage. President
Allende's policies contributed to
the inflation, but even more, it
was the actions of right-wing
Chileans and of the United States
which caused the economic and

political disruption.
The U.S. officially denied any
participation in the events of the
coup. Well substantiated evidence
of C.I.A. involvement in Chile and
reports of unusual U.S. military
and diplomatic activities in the
days preceding the coup indicate
that this is not so. But overt U.S.
involvement in the coup itself is
not there crucial question. The
United States had been involved
in preparation for the coup for
three years. As the San Francisco
Examiner reported (Sept. 16),
"the U.S. strangled Allende rule."
The Chilean coup is a revealing
example of Nixon's "low-profile"
policy. It shows that direct
intervention is not necessary to
topple a government.
The United States' military and
economic policies were designed
to weaken President Allende's
government and to strengthen his
opposition. As soon as Allende
took office, U.S. economic aid to
Chile, which had been one of the
highest in Latin America, dropped
drastically. (Aid to Frei's
government ranged from $25 to
$82 million a year and fell to $8.7
in 1971.) The U.S. banned certain
Chilean imports and moved to
deny credit to President Allende,
but Chile was still left with a huge
debt to pay on loans granted to
Frei's government. In addition,
U.S. companies were involved in
imposing an economic blockade
on Chile. The copper companies
embargoed Chilean copper, ITT
pressured private banks and
corporations to curtail operations
in Chile, and necessary goods and
replacement parts for U.S. made
vehicles and machinery were
denied to Chile.
Encouragement
At the same time as the U.S.
government acted to encourage
economic chaos, it granted larger
amounts of military aid to Chile
than ever before in an effort to
build up anti-Allende elements in
the Armed Forces. The year
Allende took office U.S. military
aid to Chile climbed from
$800,000 to $5.7 million and to
$12.3 million in 1972. Last year
alone the Pentagon spent more
money training Chilean officers
than it did on any other Latin
American country. It was U.S.
equipment which bombed the
National Palace and the civilian
population. Without U.S. military
aid the Chilean military simply
would not have had the power to
carry out a successful coup.
By actively undermining the
duly elected government of Chile,

which never overstepped its legal
bounds, the United States has
dealt a crippling blow to
democratic government in Latin
America. We as Americans share
the responsibility for the Chilean
tragedy, and we must demonstrate
our concern. We urge you to:
(1) Write, cable, or phone your
senators (Stanford representatives

John Tunney, Wash. D.C. 20510;

power, the military brutally
attempted to crush all resistance:
it bombed and machine-gunned
squatter settlements, factories,
and the University of Chile. It
executed resisters on the spot,
arrested thousands of political
opponents and exiles from
neighboring dictatorships, and is
allegedly torturing them in
detention centers. It is carrying
out house to house searches and
even book burnings. Some 5,200
civilians are now awaiting trial by
the military. Estimates of the first
week's death toll alone range from
an official 97 to more than
15,000.
What brought about the
downfall of the popularly elected
government of Chile? What caused
the right-wing Chileans and the
military to violate a long tradition
of respect for democratic
institutions — a tradition which
distinguished Chile from other
Latin American countries?
From the time Salvador
Allende became the first elected
Marxist President in the Western
Hemisphere, he continued an
existing agrarian reform program,
nationalized U.S. copper
companies, expanded state
control over factories, and
instituted numerous projects for
government housing, education,
and welfare. Most of these
measures met with considerable
popular approval. Support for the
Popular Unity government
increased from 36% to 44% in the
last three years, but its opposition
also became more intransigent. In
the months preceding the coup,
Chile was completely polarized
between left and right. Many
Chileans opposed President
Allende on ideological grounds, or
found him going too far, too fast.
But the crucial element in
swinging the balance against him
— and in convincing the military
to intervene — was the economic
and political disorder during the
last year of his administration:
inflation was estimated at 1% a
day in the last months, there were
shortages of some essential
commodities, a deadlock in
Congress, and, finally, right-wing
strikes and sabotage. President
Allende's policies contributed to
the inflation, but even more, it
was the actions of right-wing
Chileans and of the United States
which caused the economic and

political disruption.
The U.S. officially denied any
participation in the events of the
coup. Well substantiated evidence
of C.I.A. involvement in Chile and
reports of unusual U.S. military
and diplomatic activities in the
days preceding the coup indicate
that this is not so. But overt U.S.
involvement in the coup itself is
not there crucial question. The
United States had been involved
in preparation for the coup for
three years. As the San Francisco
Examiner reported (Sept. 16),
"the U.S. strangled Allende rule."
The Chilean coup is a revealing
example of Nixon's "low-profile"
policy. It shows that direct
intervention is not necessary to
topple a government.
The United States' military and
economic policies were designed
to weaken President Allende's
government and to strengthen his
opposition. As soon as Allende
took office, U.S. economic aid to
Chile, which had been one of the
highest in Latin America, dropped
drastically. (Aid to Frei's
government ranged from $25 to
$82 million a year and fell to $8.7
in 1971.) The U.S. banned certain
Chilean imports and moved to
deny credit to President Allende,
but Chile was still left with a huge
debt to pay on loans granted to
Frei's government. In addition,
U.S. companies were involved in
imposing an economic blockade
on Chile. The copper companies
embargoed Chilean copper, ITT
pressured private banks and
corporations to curtail operations
in Chile, and necessary goods and
replacement parts for U.S. made
vehicles and machinery were
denied to Chile.
Encouragement
At the same time as the U.S.
government acted to encourage
economic chaos, it granted larger
amounts of military aid to Chile
than ever before in an effort to
build up anti-Allende elements in
the Armed Forces. The year
Allende took office U.S. military
aid to Chile climbed from
$800,000 to $5.7 million and to
$12.3 million in 1972. Last year
alone the Pentagon spent more
money training Chilean officers
than it did on any other Latin
American country. It was U.S.
equipment which bombed the
National Palace and the civilian
population. Without U.S. military
aid the Chilean military simply
would not have had the power to
carry out a successful coup.
By actively undermining the
duly elected government of Chile,

which never overstepped its legal
bounds, the United States has
dealt a crippling blow to
democratic government in Latin
America. We as Americans share
the responsibility for the Chilean
tragedy, and we must demonstrate
our concern. We urge you to:
(1) Write, cable, or phone your
senators (Stanford representatives
are: Senator Alan Cranston, Sen.
John Tunney, Wash. D.C. 20510;
Congressman Paul McCloskey,
Wash., D.C. 20515), and Sen.
Fulbright, Chairman, Senate
Foreign Relations Committee;
Rep. Dante Fascell,
Subcommittee on Inter-American
Affairs, House of Representatives,
Wash., D.C. Urge them to a)
withhold all military and
economic aid and recognition
from the military junta or any

illegal government they may
subsequently install, b) take
immediate steps to prevent the
killing and repression of political
prisoners, members of the
opposition, and foreign exiles, c)
call for an investigation of the
U.S. government and
corporations' role in the Chilean
tragedy.
(2) Come to a Teach-in on
Chile in Cubberley Auditorium,
