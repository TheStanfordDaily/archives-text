# Frosh Panic, Ask Advisers For Help With Class Schedule
## 
### CLAIRE SPIEGEL 
Freshman Kristee Rosendahl of Los
Angeles took all the right classes in
high school to get admitted to
Stanford — but she doesn't know
where to go from here.
Admission is a big enough hurdle
for many freshmen, and their
academic plans often get lost in the
excitement, and anticipation of the
collegiate social scene, and the shuffle
of moving.
"I kind of pushed planning my
schedule to the back of my mind,"
Rosendahl said. Feeling the crunch
this weekend, she pored over the time
schedule and catalogue preparing for
registration.
Associate Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Mason Yearian, coordinator of
the freshman advising program,

estimates that a quarter of the
freshmen arriving at Stanford don't
know at all what to take their first
quarter. Most have decided generally
whether they'll study science or
humanities, some are even considering
a major, but few have decided
specifically what classes to take.
No Time
"The main problem is time," said
Robert Shilling, a freshman from
Ponca City, Okla. "We get the
catalogue one day and have to decide
on classes by the next." Wasting no
time, some freshmen thumb through
the catalogue even at meals.
History Prof. Lewis Spitz, associate
coordinator of the freshman advising
program, said, "Most are bewildered
when they hit that huge catalogue."
Often, freshmen look to their advisers

to help straighten their schedules out.
Volunteers from the faculty,
administration, SLAC and the Medical
Center meet and eat regularly with
students in their dorms. Or most do.
"Half are long-time advisers, and they
are conscientious. There are variations
among the other half," Yearian
explained.
Can't Satisfy
Even the conscientious ones can't
always satisfy students. Some
complain their advisers don't know
any more about courses than they do.
"That's even what my adviser told us,"
said Wendy Boyle of New Jersey.
Yearian is the first to admit his limits
as he leafs through a catalogue looking
for a course description. Generally,
advisers cannot speak authoritatively
about courses outside their own field.
It's hard to answer the student's
simplest, most direct and most
common question, "What shall I
take?" Yearian explained: "It's the
student's choice. The only thing that
gets decided for him is fulfilling the
writing requirement."
The director of the Academic
Information Center, Robert Hamardla,
who also teaches a freshman seminar
and advises students, said, "We're not
course dictators." He and his advisees
"try to answer questions together."
Can't Criticize
Criticizing a colleague's teaching
ability poses "an ethical problem" for
some advisers. "There's no difficulty
in telling students a professor teaches
an excellent course," Yearian said.
"When asked which professor is the
best lecturer or teacher of a certain
course, some are loath to respond to
that question."
Student residence staff members
and upperclassmen are often better to
consult on these technicalities, said
Spitz. Advisers are equipped to handle
"bigger questions," he said. For
example, "A pre-med might ask if he
can major in English and still get into
medical school."

Yearian added that the adviser's
task is "to keep options open as long
as possible and then give long-range
assistance in making choices between
options."
Robert Shilling is a student with
choices to make. "I'm giving medicine
a chance," he said. "I'm very
interested in humanities and will
maybe major in history."
He is enrolled in a new history
series, "Modern Europe," taught by
Profs. Gordon Craig, Lewis Spitz and
Gordon Wright. The course integrates
teaching materials and methods to
reflect the richness of European
culture.
Spitz said the new design indicates
a move toward more structured
education. President Richard Lyman
has praised these efforts to "give more
coherence in curriculum and more
guidance to the students."
Limited
Over 450 freshmen requested
enrollment in the history series, but
only 200 were placed. The popularity
of the series indicates that they, too,
desire a firmer educational structure
and are rejecting the "smorgasbord
approach" with its pursuant
"academic chaos," Spitz said.
In the last few years Yearian said he
has noticed "less dilettantism" in the
entering freshman classes. "Students
are more motivated toward success.
There is less horseplay," he said.
Although students may have trouble
selecting their first quarter's workload,
more students than before know the
direction they're heading. "There's a
return to an earlier era, to the
pre-scramble days of 1968 and 1969,"
Yearian said.

assistance in making choices between
options."
Robert Shilling is a student with
choices to make. "I'm giving medicine
a chance," he said. "I'm very
interested in humanities and will
maybe major in history."
He is enrolled in a new history
series, "Modern Europe," taught by
Profs. Gordon Craig, Lewis Spitz and
Gordon Wright. The course integrates
teaching materials and methods to
reflect the richness of European
culture.
Spitz said the new design indicates
a move toward more structured
education. President Richard Lyman
has praised these efforts to "give more
coherence in curriculum and more
guidance to the students."
Limited
Over 450 freshmen requested
enrollment in the history series, but
only 200 were placed. The popularity
of the series indicates that they, too,
desire a firmer educational structure
and are rejecting the "smorgasbord
approach" with its pursuant
"academic chaos," Spitz said.
In the last few years Yearian said he
has noticed "less dilettantism" in the
entering freshman classes. "Students
are more motivated toward success.
There is less horseplay," he said.
Although students may have trouble
selecting their first quarter's workload,
more students than before know the
direction they're heading. "There's a
return to an earlier era, to the
pre-scramble days of 1968 and 1969,"
Yearian said.
Freshman Kristee Rosendahl of Los
Angeles took all the right classes in
high school to get admitted to
Stanford — but she doesn't know
where to go from here.
Admission is a big enough hurdle
for many freshmen, and their
academic plans often get lost in the
excitement, and anticipation of the
collegiate social scene, and the shuffle
of moving.
"I kind of pushed planning my
schedule to the back of my mind,"
Rosendahl said. Feeling the crunch
this weekend, she pored over the time
schedule and catalogue preparing for
registration.
Associate Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Mason Yearian, coordinator of
the freshman advising program,

estimates that a quarter of the
freshmen arriving at Stanford don't
know at all what to take their first
quarter. Most have decided generally
whether they'll study science or
humanities, some are even considering
a major, but few have decided
specifically what classes to take.
No Time
"The main problem is time," said
Robert Shilling, a freshman from
Ponca City, Okla. "We get the
catalogue one day and have to decide
on classes by the next." Wasting no
time, some freshmen thumb through
the catalogue even at meals.
History Prof. Lewis Spitz, associate
coordinator of the freshman advising
program, said, "Most are bewildered
when they hit that huge catalogue."
Often, freshmen look to their advisers

to help straighten their schedules out.
Volunteers from the faculty,
administration, SLAC and the Medical
Center meet and eat regularly with
students in their dorms. Or most do.
"Half are long-time advisers, and they
are conscientious. There are variations
among the other half," Yearian
explained.
Can't Satisfy
Even the conscientious ones can't
always satisfy students. Some
complain their advisers don't know
any more about courses than they do.
"That's even what my adviser told us,"
said Wendy Boyle of New Jersey.
Yearian is the first to admit his limits
as he leafs through a catalogue looking
for a course description. Generally,
advisers cannot speak authoritatively
about courses outside their own field.
It's hard to answer the student's
simplest, most direct and most
common question, "What shall I
take?" Yearian explained: "It's the
student's choice. The only thing that
gets decided for him is fulfilling the
writing requirement."
The director of the Academic
Information Center, Robert Hamardla,
who also teaches a freshman seminar
and advises students, said, "We're not
course dictators." He and his advisees
"try to answer questions together."
Can't Criticize
Criticizing a colleague's teaching
ability poses "an ethical problem" for
some advisers. "There's no difficulty
in telling students a professor teaches
an excellent course," Yearian said.
"When asked which professor is the
best lecturer or teacher of a certain
course, some are loath to respond to
that question."
Student residence staff members
and upperclassmen are often better to
consult on these technicalities, said
Spitz. Advisers are equipped to handle
"bigger questions," he said. For
example, "A pre-med might ask if he
can major in English and still get into
medical school."

Yearian added that the adviser's
task is "to keep options open as long
as possible and then give long-range
assistance in making choices between
options."

Yearian is the first to admit his limits
as he leafs through a catalogue looking
for a course description. Generally,
advisers cannot speak authoritatively
about courses outside their own field.
It's hard to answer the student's
simplest, most direct and most
common question, "What shall I
take?" Yearian explained: "It's the
student's choice. The only thing that
gets decided for him is fulfilling the
writing requirement."
The director of the Academic
Information Center, Robert Hamardla,
who also teaches a freshman seminar
and advises students, said, "We're not
course dictators." He and his advisees
"try to answer questions together."
Can't Criticize
Criticizing a colleague's teaching
ability poses "an ethical problem" for
some advisers. "There's no difficulty
in telling students a professor teaches
an excellent course," Yearian said.
"When asked which professor is the
best lecturer or teacher of a certain
course, some are loath to respond to
that question."
Student residence staff members
and upperclassmen are often better to
consult on these technicalities, said
Spitz. Advisers are equipped to handle
"bigger questions," he said. For
example, "A pre-med might ask if he
can major in English and still get into
medical school."

Yearian added that the adviser's
task is "to keep options open as long
as possible and then give long-range
assistance in making choices between
options."
Robert Shilling is a student with
choices to make. "I'm giving medicine
a chance," he said. "I'm very
interested in humanities and will
maybe major in history."
He is enrolled in a new history
series, "Modern Europe," taught by
Profs. Gordon Craig, Lewis Spitz and
Gordon Wright. The course integrates
teaching materials and methods to
reflect the richness of European
culture.
Spitz said the new design indicates
a move toward more structured
education. President Richard Lyman
has praised these efforts to "give more
coherence in curriculum and more
guidance to the students."
Limited
Over 450 freshmen requested
enrollment in the history series, but
only 200 were placed. The popularity
of the series indicates that they, too,
desire a firmer educational structure
and are rejecting the "smorgasbord
approach" with its pursuant
"academic chaos," Spitz said.
In the last few years Yearian said he
has noticed "less dilettantism" in the
entering freshman classes. "Students
are more motivated toward success.
There is less horseplay," he said.
Although students may have trouble
selecting their first quarter's workload,
more students than before know the
direction they're heading. "There's a
return to an earlier era, to the
pre-scramble days of 1968 and 1969,"
Yearian said.
