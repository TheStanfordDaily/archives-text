# Chile Junta Condemned
## Plea For Humane Policies 
### 
Amnesty 1 International

Amnesty International has
learned from reliable sources that
members of Allende's Popular
Unity Coalition are being arrested.
Many are being executed, and
many thrown out of helicopters.
Guards who were on duty at the
Presidential Palace at the time of
the coup were stripped naked,
thrown on the floor and trampled
by soldiers of the new military
junta.
Hundreds of workers in
industrial outskirts of Santiago
and in Valparaiso have been
executed. A doctor in Santiago
reports 5,000 dead and 1,000
wounded in his hospital alone.
The hospitals need medical
supplies immediately.
On September 15, 1973,
Amnesty International sent urgent
appeals to United Nations
Secretary General Kurt Waldheim,
to the General Secretary of the
Organization of American States,
and to Chile's military junta head
Agosto Pinochet Ugarte, calling
for the protection of persons who
have sought political asylum in
Chile.ln the telegrams Amnesty
International urged the new
military junta in Chile to observe
the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights, and to act justly
and humanely towards members
of the opposition political parties.
'Tragic'
"Speaking for the new junta,
General Agosto Pinochet Ugarte,
commander in chief of the army,
said the military was ready to
'exterminate Marxism from the
country' Amnesty International
called tne statement "tragic and
deplorable," and called for the
retraction of the statement and
the action it would entail, since
37 percent of the Chilean
population supported the election
of the late president.
General Oscar Bonilla, the
junta's minister of the interior,
has said that the reason they
overthrew the Allende
government is that more than
"10,000 extremists" from other
countries had entered Chile.
Amnesty International insists that
the organization has
well-documented evidence that
these political refugees were
compelled to seek political asylum
in Chile because the military
regimes in Brazil, Uruguay,
Paraguay and other Latin
American countries were
systematically arresting and

torturing dissidents, forcing them
to seek political asylum elsewhere.
Amnesty International says the
junta MUST continue to honor
the right of political asylum
traditionally granted to all
political refugees in Latin
America.
The requirement that every
"exile" living in Chile register
with the police to "clarify his or
her legal status" may be a death
sentence for those individuals,
considering the actions and
intentions of the junta thus far.

Amnesty International
deplores the lawlessness which is
occuring in Chile in flagrant
disregard for the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, and
calls for action from the United
Nations and the Organization of
American States to ensure
immediately the protection of
human rights for everyone in
Chile.
(Amnesty International is an
independent, non-governmental
organization which endeavors to
ensure the right for everyone to
hold and express his or her beliefs.
