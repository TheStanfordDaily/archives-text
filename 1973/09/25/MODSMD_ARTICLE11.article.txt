# Chilean Workers Must Fight
## Forceful Revolution Needed 
### 
Linda Grouse

It is business as usual at the
large Santiago bank until several
cars pull up out front. Out of the
cars emerge a cameraman,
soundman, director and what
appears to be several actors. The
director tells the guard in front of
the bank that they are there to
shoot a scene for a film.
Before the guard can respond,
the director barks out orders to
the "actors," the cameras roll and
the action begins. The whole crew
moves into the bank, rounds up
the unsuspecting bank tellers and
locks them in the bathroom. The
"actors" then take the money and
emerge from the oank still
pretending to film the episode.
They leave the same way they
came.
Three weeks later at the same
bank, three special investigative
police cars stop out front. The
"investigators" and a "judge"
along with a few people dressed as
robbers, get out of the cars. This
time they explain to the bank
guard that they are there in order
to re-enact the crime. They go in,
lock up the tellers and rob the
bank again. After they drive away,
the "investigators" remove the
police emblems from their car and

merge into the traffic.
Later the radio announces that
these were "expropriations" for
the revolution carried out by
MIR, the Movement of the
Revolutionary Left.
What is MIR? It is a
revolutionary group in Chile
which believes that workers
should control the country.
Unlike Allende the group believes
that the "ruling class" will not
surrender its power and privilege
without a fight. The military
take-over in Chile bears this out.
Small Minority
In Chile, like the U.S., a small
minority controls the wealth
produced by workers, 17
corporations or groups control 78
percent of the working capital
generated by labor. A couple
thousand rich families amass 2/3
of all agricultural income, and a
few control the large banks. These
people of course get the lion's
share of the national income. Like
the U.S. roughly 50 percent of the
people receive only 15 percent of
the national income.
In addition, Chilean workers
produce immense profits for U.S.
corporations like ITT, Anaconda
and Kennecott. These monopolies
and others control Chile's copper,
nitrate, iron, petroleum, chemical
and even shoe production — an
investment worth 2 billion dollars.
Allende workers' that over the
years "imperialists" have taken
out of the country 9.8 billion
dollars, while the Chilean workers
who produced this wealth fight to
keep their heads above water as
inflation- soars, and their real
income dwindles.
Protecting this concentration
of wealth are the military and
police, financed by the U.S.
government to the tune of 175.8
million dollars between 1950 and
1970 —a U.S. subsidy second only
to that given the Brazilian
military.
Violence Condemned
While campaigning for office,
Allende's United Party
condemned the police violence
commonly inflicted upon those
students, strikers and poor people
fighting for change.
The Party stated that the
"violence means that while some
have luxurious housing, a large
part of the population lives in
unhealthy housing and others do
not even have a roof over their
heads. Violence means that while
some people throw food out,
others have nothing to eat."
Allende was elected through a
coalition of leftist parties. Their
goal: "to end the dominion of the
imperialists, the monopolists and
the land-holding oligarchy," to
begin the construction of estimated
control, or socialism, in Chile. It's
here that Allende and MIR parted
company. Allende felt this could
be done peacefully, and MIR felt
it would take a fight, an armed
revolution. In 1970 MIR
predicted:
"It seems to us that the
predominant strategy of the
bourgeoisie and of imperialism
consists in allowing Allende to
take power, to try and give him a
few months to govern, to 'tie him
up' with the ropes of legalism, use
the armed forces to guarantee the
effectiveness of the ties, and thus
have the UP (Allende's party)
under the constant threat of a
reactionary military coup, with

the specific purpose of keeping
Allende from carrying out his
fundamental plans. It is also part
of the strategy of the bourgeoisie
to create a reduction in industrial
production, to refuse to negotiate
the foreign debt, and to reduce
the planting of the fields thus
increasing inflation and
employment. In this way they
intend to destroy the prestige of
the UP government and then,
based on right-wing groups
created in the meantime, they
would use the armed forces 'to
save the fatherland' and to
prevent 'disorder and chaos'."
Prediction
MlR's prediction proved
correct. Prior to and immediately
following Allende's election,
landowners reduced crop
plantings (as an index, fertilizer
sales dropped 90 percent the next
year), burned crops and
slaughtered thousands of head of
cattle. Wealthy Chileans withdrew
huge amounts from the banks,
industries reduced output, truck
owners "went on strike" (in
reality "locked out" workers), as
did doctors.
The U.S. corporations and
banks caused international
banking credit to be withdrawn,
and pressured subsidiaries and
foreign assocaites to withhold sale
of goods and replacement parts
crucial to the operation of U.S.
made equipment and vehicles. At
the same time, however, the U.S.
government granted 14.5 million
dollars in credit to the Chilean
military; low-profile sabotage.
What does this all mean? A
ruling class will not let itself be
peacefully voted out of existence.
If you leave the power in the
hands of the Chilean ruling class —
power meaning control of the
industries, banks, land, police and
military — even if it means allying
with outside (American) forces to
do so, the ruling class will
sabotage any attempt of workers
to take away that power. This
power must be taken by force. It
is dangerous fantasy to think
otherwise.
What is going to happen in
Chile now? MIR has said: "The
workers have already gained the
right to make foreign enterprises,
the banks, the factories and the
land the property of all of the
people. The people have already
elected Salvador Allende and this
is not negotiable at any cost." In
spite of public statements to the
contrary, the resistance has
already begun in Chile.
When looking at what's come
down in Chile it's important to
remember that "revolution is the
main trend of the world." That is
not an empty slogan.
Revolutionary groups and parties
are growing in S.E. Asia, Africa,
here in the U.S., especially in the
internal "colonies;" the black,
brown and Indian ghettos. And
there are armed revolutionary
groups in virtually every South
American country. A film is being
shown at Stanford (Thursday,
7:30 and 9:30 at Cubberley
Auditorium), on the Tupamaros, a
group in Uraguay very similar to
MIR. Come to it. Not only to see
what it's all about, but to show
support for the Chilean workers
and the long fight they have
ahead.
