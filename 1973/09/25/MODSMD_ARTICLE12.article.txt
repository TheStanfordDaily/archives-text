# Look Beyond The Law
## Do We Assess Our Leaders? 
### 
Mark Weaver

President Nixon has declared
that it is time to "get on with the
urgent business of our nation."
Since the prerequisite for the
solution of national problems is
having an impeccable government
guided by people of the highest
character we must now demand
his resignation.
Whether by incompetence or
flagrant violation of the laws and
political ethics, Nixon has
presided over a political scandal
which by every factual guide
(seriousness of the acts, number
of persons and level of
government involved) is the
greatest in our country's history.
Even Andrew Johnson was
impeached for less —
inflammatory rhetoric and
disobeying an act of Congress.
Nixon has even rivaled him in this
area, having defied a
Congressional subpoena, a federal
district court order, and
impounded Congressional funds.
But Johnson was never associated
with any criminal activities.
Of course there are those who
will argue that Nixon has not yet
been legally charged with crimes.
But if we are to insist on a
government of high stature we
must look beyond the law to the
realm of ethics to find those
standards by which we measure
the men who lead us. I do not
mean by this that a president is
guilty until proven innocent,
merely that high national goals
should be pursued by people of
the highest integrity.
What can be said of a man who
refuses to prove his innocence?
Nixon's refusal to release the
tapes is built on the most
transparent of reasoning. He
claims he must protect the
confidentiality of the Office for
future presidents. But if one
wants confidentiality why record
conversations in the first place?
And as we have seen, Mr. Nixon's
notion of confidentiality is that
the party being recorded does not
know about it.
Benefit of the Doubt
Even giving Mr. Nixon the
benefit of the doubt it is very
hard not to believe he is guilty of
criminal acts. In mid-August, after
analyzing the public testimony,
Time magazine concluded that
"Although Nixon's involvement in
the cover-up is not proved by
courtroom standards, by any
other rational standard it is
extremely difficult not to belieye
he did not know of it or

encourage it."
We all wonder if Mr. Dean was
lying out of some sort of personal
vindictiveness when he implicated
the President. But is it not much
more probable that finding himself
becoming the scapegoat at the
highest echelon, he decided to put
an end to his loyalty and "drag"
the other guilty parties down with
him? Isn't it much more probable
that Misters Haldeman and
Ehrlichman are lying to protect
themselves and Nixon? How are
we to take their lapses of memory
when compared to Mr. Dean's
impeccable recall. Is it humanly
possible to invent a sequence of
events so complex and detailed,
and related with the accuracy
Dean evinced.
Only Dean has implicated the
President in the wrong doing.
However, it is totally probably
that Nixon, being aware of the
risks involved, would confine
orders as blatantly illegal as the
cover-up directives to his three
most trusted confidants —
Mitchell, Haldeman, and
Ehrlichman — and mistakenly
trust Dean. What would you do if
five of your subordinates were
arrested on such spectacular
charges in the middle of a
re-election campaign with the
stakes being as high as the
Presidency? If you were innocent,
wouldn't you forcefully condemn
the charges instead of curtly
denying them every few months?
Even the President's press
conferences have been
meaningless. They are merely a
chic way of showing that the
President is "open" without
having to explain anything in
detail. How fair can any forum be
when the questioners are subject
to the whim of the President and
not allowed follow-up questions?

Furthermore, there is just as
much reason to believe Nixon was
aware of the plans for the bugging
in advance.
Mr. Mitchell most likely OK'd
the operation. Magruder testified
to this and Strachan corroborated
it. In any event it is unlikely that
such a plan, as illegal and risky as
it was, and costing a quarter of a
million dollars would have been
approved by anyone with less
authority than Mitchell.
Moreover, he must have had
approval to spend that much
money from either Haldeman or
Ehrlichman and most likely from
the President himself. Mitchell
and Nixon have long been the
closest of friends. It is almost
inconceivable that the former
Attorney General would not share
the plans with the President. How
are we to interpret the flourish of
phone calls, as detailed in official
White House logs, between the
two men after the arrests and
continuing on into the summer,
even after Mitchell had stepped
down as campaign director two
weeks after the incident, which is
suspicious in itself? What does
Martha Mitchell know?
Richard Nixon is doing a lot of
sweating right now. If either
Haldeman, Ehrlichman, or
Mitchell are faced with jail
sentences, and if they are
protecting the President, they
may well re-assess their positions.
The benefit of a doubt is no
longer good enough for Richard
Nixon. You may or may not agree
with my hypothesis. It will be a
while before we know the truth,
perhaps even thirty years. In the
meantime it would be terribly
unfortunate for the people to
suffer from the delusion that a
President would not lie to them.

President Nixon has declared
that it is time to "get on with the
urgent business of our nation."
Since the prerequisite for the
solution of national problems is
having an impeccable government
guided by people of the highest
character we must now demand
his resignation.
Whether by incompetence or
flagrant violation of the laws and
political ethics, Nixon has
presided over a political scandal
which by every factual guide
(seriousness of the acts, number
of persons and level of
government involved) is the
greatest in our country's history.
Even Andrew Johnson was
impeached for less —
inflammatory rhetoric and
disobeying an act of Congress.
Nixon has even rivaled him in this
area, having defied a
Congressional subpoena, a federal
district court order, and
impounded Congressional funds.
But Johnson was never associated
with any criminal activities.
Of course there are those who
will argue that Nixon has not yet
been legally charged with crimes.
But if we are to insist on a
government of high stature we
must look beyond the law to the
realm of ethics to find those
standards by which we measure
the men who lead us. I do not
mean by this that a president is
guilty until proven innocent,
merely that high national goals
should be pursued by people of
the highest integrity.
What can be said of a man who
refuses to prove his innocence?
Nixon's refusal to release the
tapes is built on the most
transparent of reasoning. He
claims he must protect the
confidentiality of the Office for
future presidents. But if one
wants confidentiality why record
conversations in the first place?
And as we have seen, Mr. Nixon's
notion of confidentiality is that
the party being recorded does not
know about it.
Benefit of the Doubt
Even giving Mr. Nixon the
benefit of the doubt it is very
hard not to believe he is guilty of
criminal acts. In mid-August, after
analyzing the public testimony,
Time magazine concluded that
"Although Nixon's involvement in
the cover-up is not proved by
courtroom standards, by any
other rational standard it is
extremely difficult not to belieye
he did not know of it or

encourage it."
We all wonder if Mr. Dean was
lying out of some sort of personal
vindictiveness when he implicated
the President. But is it not much
more probable that finding himself
becoming the scapegoat at the
highest echelon, he decided to put
an end to his loyalty and "drag"
the other guilty parties down with
him? Isn't it much more probable
that Misters Haldeman and
Ehrlichman are lying to protect
themselves and Nixon? How are
we to take their lapses of memory
when compared to Mr. Dean's
impeccable recall. Is it humanly
possible to invent a sequence of
events so complex and detailed,
and related with the accuracy
Dean evinced.
Only Dean has implicated the
President in the wrong doing.
However, it is totally probably
that Nixon, being aware of the
risks involved, would confine
orders as blatantly illegal as the
cover-up directives to his three
most trusted confidants —
Mitchell, Haldeman, and
Ehrlichman — and mistakenly
trust Dean. What would you do if
five of your subordinates were
arrested on such spectacular
charges in the middle of a
re-election campaign with the
stakes being as high as the
Presidency? If you were innocent,
wouldn't you forcefully condemn
the charges instead of curtly
denying them every few months?
Even the President's press
conferences have been
meaningless. They are merely a
chic way of showing that the
President is "open" without
having to explain anything in
detail. How fair can any forum be
when the questioners are subject
to the whim of the President and
not allowed follow-up questions?

Furthermore, there is just as
much reason to believe Nixon was
aware of the plans for the bugging
in advance.
Mr. Mitchell most likely OK'd
the operation. Magruder testified
to this and Strachan corroborated
it. In any event it is unlikely that
such a plan, as illegal and risky as
it was, and costing a quarter of a
million dollars would have been
approved by anyone with less
authority than Mitchell.
Moreover, he must have had
approval to spend that much
money from either Haldeman or
Ehrlichman and most likely from
the President himself. Mitchell
and Nixon have long been the
closest of friends. It is almost
inconceivable that the former
Attorney General would not share
the plans with the President. How
are we to interpret the flourish of
phone calls, as detailed in official
White House logs, between the
two men after the arrests and
continuing on into the summer,
even after Mitchell had stepped
down as campaign director two
weeks after the incident, which is
suspicious in itself? What does
Martha Mitchell know?

it was, and costing a quarter of a
million dollars would have been
approved by anyone with less
authority than Mitchell.
Moreover, he must have had
approval to spend that much
money from either Haldeman or
Ehrlichman and most likely from
the President himself. Mitchell
and Nixon have long been the
closest of friends. It is almost
inconceivable that the former
Attorney General would not share
the plans with the President. How
are we to interpret the flourish of
phone calls, as detailed in official
White House logs, between the
two men after the arrests and
continuing on into the summer,
even after Mitchell had stepped
down as campaign director two
weeks after the incident, which is
suspicious in itself? What does
Martha Mitchell know?
Richard Nixon is doing a lot of
sweating right now. If either
Haldeman, Ehrlichman, or
Mitchell are faced with jail
sentences, and if they are
protecting the President, they
may well re-assess their positions.
The benefit of a doubt is no
longer good enough for Richard
Nixon. You may or may not agree
with my hypothesis. It will be a
while before we know the truth,
perhaps even thirty years. In the
meantime it would be terribly
unfortunate for the people to
suffer from the delusion that a
President would not lie to them.

President Nixon has declared
that it is time to "get on with the
urgent business of our nation."
Since the prerequisite for the
solution of national problems is
having an impeccable government
guided by people of the highest
character we must now demand
his resignation.
Whether by incompetence or
flagrant violation of the laws and
political ethics, Nixon has
presided over a political scandal
which by every factual guide
(seriousness of the acts, number
of persons and level of
government involved) is the
greatest in our country's history.
Even Andrew Johnson was
impeached for less —
inflammatory rhetoric and
disobeying an act of Congress.
Nixon has even rivaled him in this
area, having defied a
Congressional subpoena, a federal
district court order, and
impounded Congressional funds.
But Johnson was never associated
with any criminal activities.
Of course there are those who
will argue that Nixon has not yet
been legally charged with crimes.
But if we are to insist on a
government of high stature we
must look beyond the law to the
realm of ethics to find those
standards by which we measure
the men who lead us. I do not
mean by this that a president is
guilty until proven innocent,
merely that high national goals
should be pursued by people of
the highest integrity.
What can be said of a man who
refuses to prove his innocence?
Nixon's refusal to release the
tapes is built on the most
transparent of reasoning. He
claims he must protect the
confidentiality of the Office for
future presidents. But if one
wants confidentiality why record
conversations in the first place?
And as we have seen, Mr. Nixon's
notion of confidentiality is that
the party being recorded does not
know about it.
Benefit of the Doubt
Even giving Mr. Nixon the
benefit of the doubt it is very
hard not to believe he is guilty of
criminal acts. In mid-August, after
analyzing the public testimony,
Time magazine concluded that
"Although Nixon's involvement in
the cover-up is not proved by
courtroom standards, by any
other rational standard it is
extremely difficult not to belieye
he did not know of it or

encourage it."
We all wonder if Mr. Dean was
lying out of some sort of personal
vindictiveness when he implicated
the President. But is it not much
more probable that finding himself
becoming the scapegoat at the
highest echelon, he decided to put
an end to his loyalty and "drag"
the other guilty parties down with
him? Isn't it much more probable
that Misters Haldeman and
Ehrlichman are lying to protect
themselves and Nixon? How are
we to take their lapses of memory
when compared to Mr. Dean's
impeccable recall. Is it humanly
possible to invent a sequence of
events so complex and detailed,
and related with the accuracy
Dean evinced.
Only Dean has implicated the
President in the wrong doing.
However, it is totally probably
that Nixon, being aware of the
risks involved, would confine
orders as blatantly illegal as the
cover-up directives to his three
most trusted confidants —
Mitchell, Haldeman, and
Ehrlichman — and mistakenly
trust Dean. What would you do if
five of your subordinates were
arrested on such spectacular
charges in the middle of a
re-election campaign with the
stakes being as high as the
Presidency? If you were innocent,
wouldn't you forcefully condemn
the charges instead of curtly
denying them every few months?
Even the President's press
conferences have been
meaningless. They are merely a
chic way of showing that the
President is "open" without
having to explain anything in
detail. How fair can any forum be
when the questioners are subject
to the whim of the President and
not allowed follow-up questions?

Furthermore, there is just as
much reason to believe Nixon was
aware of the plans for the bugging
in advance.
Mr. Mitchell most likely OK'd
the operation. Magruder testified
to this and Strachan corroborated
it. In any event it is unlikely that
such a plan, as illegal and risky as
it was, and costing a quarter of a
million dollars would have been
approved by anyone with less
authority than Mitchell.
Moreover, he must have had
