# Local Gas Protest Proves Effective
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -
Like camels in a desert, motorists
searched for gasoline oases as
many Northern California service
stations closed in protest of Phase
4 pricing controls.
Disgruntled drivers queued up
for blocks at the few stations
remaining open Friday night and
harried station operators rationed
gas in many cases. The 72-hour
protest began Saturday.
A spot check showed that most
stations staying open despite the
protest are company owned.
The California Highway Patrol
said it spotted numerous
out-of-gas motorists and received
calls from others looking for open
stations. Police also reported
switchboards jammed with calls
from gas-hungry consumers.
"We're rationing six gallons to
the customer, but some people go
around the block and come back
again," an employee at a Standard
Oil Co. station said Friday. "We
can't close because we're a
company station. The cars are
lined up for blocks and the
customers seem panicked."
Bob Moore, spokesman for the
California Service Station Dealers
Association, estimated that at
least half of the 5,000
dealer-operated stations in
Northern California would stay
closed until today to protest
the government price controls.

Ray Ashwell, executive
director of the 500-member
California Gasoline Retailers
Association, based primarily in
the Sacramento-San Joaquin
Valley, estimated 90 percent of
his membership closed their
pumps.

Ninety of the 101 stations in
Eureka, Arcadia, McKinleyville
and Fortuna areas closed down
for the 72-hour protest, said
Warren Goade of the Humboldt
County Service Station Dealers
Association.
In San Jose, 400 members of

the local chapter of the National
Service Station Dealers
Association gave their support to
the shutdown protest at a Friday
night meeting.
A check around Redding found
60 percent of the gas stations
closed down.
