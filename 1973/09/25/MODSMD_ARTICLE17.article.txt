# Write Biology Textbook
## Undergraduates Teach Course 
### 
Two years ago Hank Kistler
and five fellow undergraduates
took Biology 110-L, a vertebrate
biology laboratory. Last year they
taught the course. This summer
they wrote and illustrated what is
now the new textbook for the
course; the first edition is going
on the Bookstore shelves now.
Vertebrate Biology — A
Laboratory Manual was an idea
which incubated first in the mind
of Professor Norman K. Wessells,
who teaches the vertebrate
biology lecture course. Chairman
of the Department of Biological
Sciences and the recent recipient
of a University award for
excellence in teaching, Wessells
first began two years ago to use
undergraduates as teaching
assistants in the laboratory part of
the course.
He and his assistant, Elizabeth
Center, who supervises the
laboratory part of the course,
agree that undergraduates make
excellent teachers. "They have
just taken the course and know all
the pitfalls," says Center.
The opportunity has become a
coveted one and last fall over 30

students competed for the eight
places available as teaching
assistants.
"The TA's are usually good
students," says Center, "but the
group last year was really
exceptional, both in their interest
and in their ability." When
Wessells proposed that they
consider writing a new laboratory
manual for the course, six of the
TA's responded enthusiastically.
Other Participants
In addition to Kistler they
were David J. Anderson, Neil
Baker, Mary M. Cook, Mary Bryan
McNabb, and Nathan C. Schafer.
Nina Shapley, a senior this fall,
agreed to do the illustrations.
"In the past we had been using
bits and pieces of several different
lab texts in the course. That was
disorganized and expensive," says
Kistler, a human biology major
who graduated last December and
became coordinator of the joint
authors.
"None of the texts we had
been using combined the lab
manual with a text on evolution
or a discussion of physiology — of
how systems work," says Shapley,
a biology major.
180 Page Manual
The group decided to combine
all three aspects in their manual.
The 180-page text uses detailed
instructions and careful
descriptions to take laboratory
students through hemichordates
and lower chordates, the lamprey,
the dogfish shark, the sheep and
the cat. The dissections are
designed to reveal the structure,
function, and evolutionary
relationships of their
musculoskeletal, digestive,
urogenital, respiratory,
circulatory, and central nervous
systems.
The text includes about 100
carefully crafted illustrations of
the various stages of the
dissections. All the art work was
done by Shapley, whose previous

experience included work as a
medical illustrator for the
University of California and
illustrations for the handouts in
Wessells' course last year.
Unlike most budding authors,
these students had a publisher's
contract before they began work.
The William Kaufman Company
of Los Altos Hills agreed to
publish the first edition of the
manual, which is essentially a trial
run. The authors expect to rework
the text in response to comments
and criticism of the 300 Stanford
students using it this fall.
Not For Money
"People ask me if I'm doing
this for money," says Shapley.
"But I wouldn't work this hard
for money." None of the students
involved initially realized the kind
of time commitment the work
eventually would require.

All three found great
satisfaction in carrying out the
project. "In most dissections there
is an unlimited reservoir of things
to find," says Kistler. "There are
different levels of complexity. A
one-hour dissection could easily
be a 15-hour dissection. We tried
to write into the manual as many
things as possible that would be
good teaching and learning
experiences."
"Many students who take the
course say they like these labs
better than anything else they've
taken," says Center. "For many
students this is their first chance
to dissect and they find it exciting
and challenging."
Although a large proportion of
the students who take it are
premeds, the vertebrate biology
course is not a specified part of
the premed curriculum.
