# Revision Of World Monetary System Delayed
## 
### 
NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Deadlocked
on key issues, the world's top finance
ministers decided Sunday to give
themselves another 10 months to design a
new international monetary system.
The International Monetary Fund's
Committee of 20 ministers, a select panel
with the job of writing new monetary
rules, gave up trying to settle their
differences this week because their efforts
appeared fruitless.
"The whole thing is a real scrambled egg
at the moment," one source said leaving
Sunday's meeting. "There is no sign of any
of the real problems being solved here."
Instead, the ministers agreed to put
their deputies to work at once on the many
points in dispute, wait for compromises to
jell, then meet again next January and next
June to seek final approval.
The failure to move ahead quickly with
monetary reform apparently means that
the present system of floating exchange
rates for the world's major currencies will
remain in effect for almost another year.

This in turn means continued
uncertainty about prices and exchange
rates for travelers, traders and consumers,
because the major currencies, including the
dollar, are free to range as much in value as
the markets will permit.
The average American consumer
probably won't notice this directly, unless
the dollar goes through another sharp
plunge as it did earlier this year. That
would raise the price of imports to the
United States still more and make
American goods still cheaper in foreign
markets.
Asked how firm the July 31 deadline is,
U.S. Treasury Secretary George P. Shultz
said:
"It sounds like a sort of an
unambiguous deadline. You can pin us
down on that."
There was no effort by the ministers to
try to tackle their differences during a
two-hour closed-door meeting Sunday at
Nairobi's new Kenyatta Conference Center,
where the annual meeting of the

126-nation International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank begins Monday.
The key disputes holding back
monetary reform appear to be:
—How, and under what conditions,
nations will change the official value of
their currencies. The United States has
proposed making this more automatic.
—Convertibility of the dollar. Since
President Nixon on Aug. 15, 1971, refused
to allow the United States to exchange
dollars for gold, the world's monetary
system has been in disarray. The dollar's
convertibility at $35 per ounce of gold had
been the basis of international exchange
rates for 27 years. Washington has declined
to restore convertibility except as part of
an over-all reform package.
—Linking monetary reform with
development aid. The developing nations
are pressing for a greater share of wealth
created through the device of "paper
gold," the nickname for Special Drawing
Rights, a new kind of international monev.

unambiguous deadline. You can pin us
down on that."
There was no effort by the ministers to
try to tackle their differences during a
two-hour closed-door meeting Sunday at
Nairobi's new Kenyatta Conference Center,
where the annual meeting of the

126-nation International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank begins Monday.
The key disputes holding back
monetary reform appear to be:
—How, and under what conditions,
nations will change the official value of
their currencies. The United States has
proposed making this more automatic.
—Convertibility of the dollar. Since
President Nixon on Aug. 15, 1971, refused
to allow the United States to exchange
dollars for gold, the world's monetary
system has been in disarray. The dollar's
convertibility at $35 per ounce of gold had
been the basis of international exchange
rates for 27 years. Washington has declined
to restore convertibility except as part of
an over-all reform package.
—Linking monetary reform with
development aid. The developing nations
are pressing for a greater share of wealth
created through the device of "paper
gold," the nickname for Special Drawing
Rights, a new kind of international monev.
NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — Deadlocked
on key issues, the world's top finance
ministers decided Sunday to give
themselves another 10 months to design a
new international monetary system.
The International Monetary Fund's
Committee of 20 ministers, a select panel
with the job of writing new monetary
rules, gave up trying to settle their
differences this week because their efforts
appeared fruitless.
"The whole thing is a real scrambled egg
at the moment," one source said leaving
Sunday's meeting. "There is no sign of any
of the real problems being solved here."
Instead, the ministers agreed to put
their deputies to work at once on the many
points in dispute, wait for compromises to
jell, then meet again next January and next
June to seek final approval.
The failure to move ahead quickly with
monetary reform apparently means that
the present system of floating exchange
rates for the world's major currencies will
remain in effect for almost another year.

This in turn means continued
uncertainty about prices and exchange
rates for travelers, traders and consumers,
because the major currencies, including the
dollar, are free to range as much in value as
the markets will permit.
The average American consumer
probably won't notice this directly, unless
the dollar goes through another sharp
plunge as it did earlier this year. That
would raise the price of imports to the
United States still more and make
American goods still cheaper in foreign
markets.
Asked how firm the July 31 deadline is,
U.S. Treasury Secretary George P. Shultz
said:
"It sounds like a sort of an
unambiguous deadline. You can pin us
down on that."
