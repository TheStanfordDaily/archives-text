# Progress Made In Heart Disease Work
## 
### 
University medical researchers have developed an instrument which
permits them to take a small sample of heart tissue from a living
patient and study it for evidence of rejection or heart disease.
The instrument, called a bioptome, was pioneered by Japanese
physicians 10 years ago, but very few doctors in the West have used it.
Working with Werner P. Schulz, a Peninsula engineer who
specializes in microsurgical instruments, researchers here have
developed a new bioptome which is shorter and more flexible than the
original.
The bioptome is essentially a piece of wire with a clipper at the
end. It is inserted into the patient's jugular vein and threated down
into the heart, where it takes a small sample of cardiac tissue. The
procedure is done under local anesthetic, and the insertion is viewed
through a fluoroscope.
The instrument is now used routinely here to obtain tissue
specimens from patients following heart transplantation, and to make
a direct diagnosis of rejection — a common problem in transplants.
Previously, the doctors made their diagnosis by studying the
electrocardiogram and clinical signs.
The report of the new development appears in a recent issue of the
Journal of the American Medical Association. The authors are Drs.
Philip K. Caves, Edward Stinson, Anthony F. Graham, Margaret E.
Billingham, Todd M. Grehl, and Norman E. Shumway.
"The virtue of the bioptome," Shumway explained, "is that it
permits direct judgment, based on tissue study, of the rejection
reaction."
In particular, he said, the bioptome samples help avoid excessive
use of drugs to combat the rejection reaction. This is important
because the drugs cripple the body's immunological defenses and thus
open the way for infections.
Caves, who is now a lecturer in cardiac surgery at the University of
Edinburgh, reported that up to now studies of the transplanted heart
in living patients have been limited by the lack of a simple, safe biopsy
technique.
Caves and his collaborators first tried the new bioptome in
transplanted dogs and found they could obtain excellent tissue
specimens for microscopic studies.
He subsequently tested the instrument in 10 heart transplant
patients, obtaining 20 biopsy specimens. "The specimens were
valuable in diagnosing acute rejection episodes," he said. "All the
patients tolerated the procedure well and there have been no
complications."
Stanford physicians, Caves said, plan to apply the new technique to
the study of other forms of myocardial disease.
He did the work while here under fellowships from the British
Heart Foundation and the American Heart Association.

open the way for infections.
Caves, who is now a lecturer in cardiac surgery at the University of
Edinburgh, reported that up to now studies of the transplanted heart
in living patients have been limited by the lack of a simple, safe biopsy
technique.
Caves and his collaborators first tried the new bioptome in
transplanted dogs and found they could obtain excellent tissue
specimens for microscopic studies.
He subsequently tested the instrument in 10 heart transplant
patients, obtaining 20 biopsy specimens. "The specimens were
valuable in diagnosing acute rejection episodes," he said. "All the
patients tolerated the procedure well and there have been no
complications."
Stanford physicians, Caves said, plan to apply the new technique to
the study of other forms of myocardial disease.
He did the work while here under fellowships from the British
Heart Foundation and the American Heart Association.
