## Hunt Denies Watergate 'Blackmail' 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - E. Howard
Hunt, the one-time master spy,
testified yesterday he had brought up
"seamy" chores he had performed for
the White House in one request for
payment of his post-Watergate
expenses.
But he denied the reference
amounted to blackmail and said he
had never asked presidential clemency.
The convicted Watergate
conspirator, a member of the White
House unit that conducted the
burglary of Daniel Ellsberg's
psychiatrist's office, added a new
element to an oft-told story in an
otherwise colorless resumption of the
Senate Watergate hearings.
He said former White House special
counsel Charles W. Colson knew in
advance about the intelligence
gathering plan that led to the break-in
of Democratic party headquarters.
Memories
Hunt had sworn earlier that he had
no such knowledge about Colson. But
he said Monday that his memory was

refreshed in closed-door questioning
by the committee counsel Samuel
Dash.
From that, Hunt said, he recalled a
conversation with Colson in January,
1972 where Colson "indicated he was
aware of the over-all intelligence
plan."
That would have been before the
Jan. 27 meeting in which G. Gordon
Liddy first broached a million-dollar
intelligence plan to then Atty. Gen.
John N. Mitchell, Dash pointed out.
Withdraw Plea
Hunt recently asked to withdraw
his plea of guilty to the charges
stemming from the Watergate break-in,
indicating in his motion that he
believed Colson, among others,
approved the plan.
Dash suggested that the move to
withdraw the plea might have
influenced Hunt's change of
testimony. Hunt said his legal position
does not depend on when Colson
knew of the intelligence plan.
Testifying in a subdued voice,

frequently conferring with his lawyer,
Hunt stopped short of saying that
Colson knew specifically about the
Watergate burglary plan and stood by
a previous sworn affidavit that Colson
had information "only to the over-all
intelligence program."
Colson has denied having
foreknowledge of Watergate, but asked
to be excused from Senate testimony
on grounds of possible
self-incrimination.
Meeting
Hunt said that in March this year, a
few days before he came up for
sentencing on his guilty plea in the
Watergate trial, he met with Paul
O'Brien, an attorney representing
President Nixon's re-election
committee.
He said he spoke about his legal
bills, which then totaled $60,000, and
about his concern for the future of his
family.
"I put it to Mr. O'Brien that I had
engaged ... in other activities which I
believe I described as seamy activities

for the White House," Hunt said.
Asked if that was not a threat,
Hunt said "No, sir."
He added, however, that soon
thereafter he received $75,000 in a
sealed envelope, which he put in a safe
