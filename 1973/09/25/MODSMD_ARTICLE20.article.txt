# Cutbacks Threaten Waste Treatment Plans
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) -
Federal cutbacks would deny
$32.3 million to 170 California
sewage treatment projects,
Chairman Win Adams of the state
Water Resources Control Board
said Friday.
The regulations adopted by the
U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency "are totally unfair and
may be in violation of the federal
law authorizing the retroactive
grants," Adams said in a
statement.
"We have been working
through EPA and the
congressional and Senate

delegation to get a reversal of this
policy since the regulations were
first proposed in June," Adams
added.
He explained that under a
1972 law the 30-33 percent of
federal aid for clean water
projects was intended to climb to
50-55 percent. But Adams said it
is estimated the cost would be
$2.4 billion nationwide to
implement that program and only
about $1.9 billion is available.
Adams explained that the rules
permit full retroactive grants to all
New York projects but no
California projects are eligible.
