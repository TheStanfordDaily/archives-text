# In Case Of Gas Shortage
## Rationing Plan Proposed 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Just in
case things really get bad, the
Nixon administration has a
last-resort plan for fuel rationing,
with some features borrowed
from the military draft and others
from check-account banking.
The rationing system is the
final stage of a four-step
"contingency plan" for coping
with fuel shortages ranging from
mild to severe.
Administration officials insist
the contingency plan is only a
"working draft" which has not
been formally approved. But it is
the only plan they have, and most
of its ideas are already being
carried out in response to growing
fuel shortages.
Presidential counsellor Melvin
Laird said Sunday on the CBS
television program "Face the
Nation" that "it may be necessary
to go forward with a program of
mandatory allocation."
He added that the President
may not be able to wait for
congressional action before
putting such a plan into effect.
The White House Energy
Policy Office refused to release
the contingency plan, but another
office permitted a newsman to
read it.

Prescribing for theoretical fuel
shortages ranging from 10 to 30
percent, the plan's proposals are
grouped into four degrees of
increasing severity:
— Appeals for voluntary fuel
conservation by the public,
reinforced by fuel price increases.
— Shifting consumption by
power plants and other industries
from scarce fuels to plentiful
types, and other measures to take
the pressure off the shortage
areas.
— Establishment of fuel-use
priorities and allocations.
— And finally, as a last resort
for severe shortages, formal
rationing of fuels among the final
consumers.
The administration already has
adopted measures from the first
three phases of the plan.
Should rationing become
necessary, it would probably
revolve around the issuance of
rationing "checks" to all owners

of motor vehicles and to other
fuel consumers.
As sketched out by the
contingency plan, the consumer
would have to present a rationing
check to purchase fuel and the
retailer would then deposit the
checks he has collected in an
account on which he could then
draw, to receive further fuel
supplies.
Consumers would be issued
checks for various fuel allowances
based on a priority system. The
contingency plan does not specify
any priorities.
The plan suggests that
rationing could begin with a
presidential declaration of a
national fuel emergency, coupled
with a weekend ban on all retail
sales of gasoline as a transition to
ration ing-by-check.
Gasoline rationing could be
applied in summer, the peak
demand season, and all-fuel
rationing in winter.

case things really get bad, the
Nixon administration has a
last-resort plan for fuel rationing,
with some features borrowed
from the military draft and others
from check-account banking.
The rationing system is the
final stage of a four-step
"contingency plan" for coping
with fuel shortages ranging from
mild to severe.
Administration officials insist
the contingency plan is only a
"working draft" which has not
been formally approved. But it is
the only plan they have, and most
of its ideas are already being
carried out in response to growing
fuel shortages.
Presidential counsellor Melvin
Laird said Sunday on the CBS
television program "Face the
Nation" that "it may be necessary
to go forward with a program of
mandatory allocation."
He added that the President
may not be able to wait for
congressional action before
putting such a plan into effect.
The White House Energy
Policy Office refused to release
the contingency plan, but another
office permitted a newsman to
read it.

Prescribing for theoretical fuel
shortages ranging from 10 to 30
percent, the plan's proposals are
grouped into four degrees of
increasing severity:
— Appeals for voluntary fuel
conservation by the public,
reinforced by fuel price increases.
— Shifting consumption by
power plants and other industries
from scarce fuels to plentiful
types, and other measures to take
the pressure off the shortage
areas.
— Establishment of fuel-use
priorities and allocations.
— And finally, as a last resort
for severe shortages, formal
rationing of fuels among the final
consumers.
The administration already has
adopted measures from the first
three phases of the plan.
Should rationing become
necessary, it would probably
revolve around the issuance of
rationing "checks" to all owners

of motor vehicles and to other
fuel consumers.
As sketched out by the
contingency plan, the consumer
would have to present a rationing
check to purchase fuel and the
retailer would then deposit the
checks he has collected in an
account on which he could then
draw, to receive further fuel
supplies.
Consumers would be issued
checks for various fuel allowances
based on a priority system. The
contingency plan does not specify
any priorities.
The plan suggests that
rationing could begin with a
presidential declaration of a
national fuel emergency, coupled
with a weekend ban on all retail
sales of gasoline as a transition to
ration ing-by-check.
Gasoline rationing could be
applied in summer, the peak
demand season, and all-fuel
rationing in winter.
