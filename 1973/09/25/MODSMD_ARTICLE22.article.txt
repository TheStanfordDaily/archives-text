# Foreign Capital Increasing

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -
Increased investment by foreign
countries inside the United States
is an economic fact of life that
could benefit U.S. corporations,
some top American businessmen
say.
"Since 1970, when they passed
the $100 million mark, foreign
investments have been growing
steadily," said Jacques G.
Maisonrouge, chief executive
officer and president of IBM
World Trade Corp. in New York.
"Now with devaluation, the
process is even faster," he said. "It
costs a German firm 40 percent
less to buy an American company
today than in 1969." Maisonrouge
and other leading executives were
interviewed during the
International Industrial
Conference held in San Francisco
Sept. 17-21.
"In general these investments
are a favorable factor in increasing
understanding among peoples,"
Maisonrouge said. "They make
U.S. investments abroad much less
vulnerable to nationalistic

governments, because we have the
implied power to retaliate."
"We ought to be encouraging
it," agreed Robert H. Malott,
president and chief executive
officer of FMC Corp. in Chicago.
"How can we try to stop foreign
investment here if we want to
invest abroad — it's a two way
street."
Malott said talk by some
politicians of possible federal
legislation to restrict Japanese or
other investments was "political
naivete." He said it "would be
very dangerous if pressures
developed in Washington against
foreign investments."
"It's ridiculous for American
politicians to raise the specter of
foreign domination when the
amounts from outside are so
small," Maisonrouge said. "We're
still talking about minute
amounts" compared to American
investment abroad, which last
year rose to $94 billion.
"Many overseas companies feel
the greatest single concentrated
market for their product is the

United States," said J. Sheppard
Poor, managing director of
Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc., a New
York investment firm. "They feel
that if you really want to be part
of the market, you have to be
more than an exporter."
"Now is the right time to
invest in this country," said
Eikichi Itoh, chairman of C. Itoh
& Co., Ltd., in Osaka, Japan.
"The dollar is undervalued, so it's
a good time for the Japanese to
invest to improve our balance of
payments."
Itoh said he hadn't found any
signs of U.S. resistance to
Japanese investors, but said he
could foresee some possible
difficulties with American labor in
the future.
"There is a mentality
problem," said Dennis M.
Finnigan, vice-president in charge
of research operations for
Stanford Research Institute. "The
Japanese are particularly sensitive
about the problems of importing
an entire management structure —
they've seen it happen to
themselves too often."

costs a German firm 40 percent
less to buy an American company
today than in 1969." Maisonrouge
and other leading executives were
interviewed during the
International Industrial
Conference held in San Francisco
Sept. 17-21.
"In general these investments
are a favorable factor in increasing
understanding among peoples,"
Maisonrouge said. "They make
U.S. investments abroad much less
vulnerable to nationalistic

governments, because we have the
implied power to retaliate."
"We ought to be encouraging
it," agreed Robert H. Malott,
president and chief executive
officer of FMC Corp. in Chicago.
"How can we try to stop foreign
investment here if we want to
invest abroad — it's a two way
street."
Malott said talk by some
politicians of possible federal
legislation to restrict Japanese or
other investments was "political
naivete." He said it "would be
very dangerous if pressures
developed in Washington against
foreign investments."
"It's ridiculous for American
politicians to raise the specter of
foreign domination when the
amounts from outside are so
small," Maisonrouge said. "We're
still talking about minute
amounts" compared to American
investment abroad, which last
year rose to $94 billion.
"Many overseas companies feel
the greatest single concentrated
market for their product is the

United States," said J. Sheppard
Poor, managing director of
Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc., a New
York investment firm. "They feel
that if you really want to be part
of the market, you have to be
more than an exporter."
"Now is the right time to
invest in this country," said
Eikichi Itoh, chairman of C. Itoh
& Co., Ltd., in Osaka, Japan.
"The dollar is undervalued, so it's
a good time for the Japanese to
invest to improve our balance of
payments."
Itoh said he hadn't found any
signs of U.S. resistance to
Japanese investors, but said he
could foresee some possible
difficulties with American labor in
the future.
"There is a mentality
problem," said Dennis M.
Finnigan, vice-president in charge
of research operations for
Stanford Research Institute. "The
Japanese are particularly sensitive
about the problems of importing
an entire management structure —
they've seen it happen to
themselves too often."

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -
Increased investment by foreign
countries inside the United States
is an economic fact of life that
could benefit U.S. corporations,
some top American businessmen
say.
"Since 1970, when they passed
the $100 million mark, foreign
investments have been growing
steadily," said Jacques G.
Maisonrouge, chief executive
officer and president of IBM
World Trade Corp. in New York.
"Now with devaluation, the
process is even faster," he said. "It
costs a German firm 40 percent
less to buy an American company
today than in 1969." Maisonrouge

interviewed during the
International Industrial
