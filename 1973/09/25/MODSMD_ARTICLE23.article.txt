# 1.8 Percent Increase
## August Prices Rise Sharply 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)
Inflation took its biggest bite in
more than a generation last month
as consumer prices, led by the
biggest one-month jump in food
costs since 1933, rose 1.8 percent,
the government reported Friday.
A White House economics
adviser said the sharp increase in
food prices was "in part an
over-reaction to pressures built up
during the freeze," and predicted
they would begin dropping this
fall.
President Nixon said through a
spokesman he "expects the steps
we are taking to combat

inflation ... will bring about a
decrease in the rise of inflation
and solve this problem and bring
the cost of living index down to a
reasonable level."
But AFL-CIO President George
Meany, noting the August rise in
the Consumer Price Index was the
sharpest in 26 years, called the
figures "complete proof of the
utter incompetence of this
administration."
The sharp price increases
reflected in the Labor Department
report had been anticipated
following the huge jump in
wholesale prices last month. The

price explosion coincided with the
government's lifting of the freeze
on most food prices July 18 and
for almost everything else in
mid-August.
Food prices, including
restaurant meals, advanced six
percent last month on an
unadjusted basis and 6.1 percent
after adjustment for normal
seasonal changes.
Last month's 6 percent jump
was surpassed only by a 9.4
percent increase at the height of
the Depression in July 1933 and
the record 9.6 percent increase of
April 1917. Seasonally adjusted,
the increase was the largest on
record since the government
began keeping seasonal figures in

1946.
Grocery prices rose even
higher, climbing 7.4 percent
unadjusted and 7.7 percent
adjusted, more than in any month
since the government started
maintaining separate figures on
food store prices after World War
H.
The index for nonfood
commodities, which usually
declines in August, rose
two-tenths of one percent,
reflecting higher prices for
clothing, houses, maintenance and
fuel oil.
The big increase in the cost of
living further eroded the buying
power of the average worker by
offsetting wage increases.

WASHINGTON (AP)
Inflation took its biggest bite in
more than a generation last month
as consumer prices, led by the
biggest one-month jump in food
costs since 1933, rose 1.8 percent,
the government reported Friday.
A White House economics
adviser said the sharp increase in
food prices was "in part an
over-reaction to pressures built up
during the freeze," and predicted
they would begin dropping this
fall.
President Nixon said through a
spokesman he "expects the steps
we are taking to combat

inflation ... will bring about a
decrease in the rise of inflation
and solve this problem and bring
the cost of living index down to a
reasonable level."
But AFL-CIO President George
Meany, noting the August rise in
the Consumer Price Index was the
sharpest in 26 years, called the
figures "complete proof of the
utter incompetence of this
administration."
The sharp price increases
reflected in the Labor Department
report had been anticipated
following the huge jump in
wholesale prices last month. The

price explosion coincided with the
government's lifting of the freeze
on most food prices July 18 and
for almost everything else in
mid-August.
Food prices, including
restaurant meals, advanced six
percent last month on an
unadjusted basis and 6.1 percent
after adjustment for normal
seasonal changes.
Last month's 6 percent jump
was surpassed only by a 9.4
percent increase at the height of
the Depression in July 1933 and
the record 9.6 percent increase of
April 1917. Seasonally adjusted,
the increase was the largest on
record since the government
began keeping seasonal figures in

1946.
Grocery prices rose even
higher, climbing 7.4 percent
unadjusted and 7.7 percent
adjusted, more than in any month
since the government started
maintaining separate figures on
food store prices after World War

commodities, which usually

two-tenths of one percent,
