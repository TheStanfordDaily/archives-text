# Study Probes Disruptive Classroom Behavior
## 
### 
Recipe for changing ringleaders
into student leaders:
Offer rewards instead of
punishment and stir in a generous
mixture of firm educational
psychology.
That was the formula that
worked well for the holder of a
newly-minted Stanford doctorate
in education, Joanne Rand
Whitmore of Burlingame.
Her project was to modify
disruptive classroom behavior,
part of a five-year study originally
headed by Prof. Pauline Sears,
now retired.
For her study, Whitmore chose
a "distressed" Peninsula
elementary school — "distressed'
in this case defined as "those
[schools] in which tension and
conflict predominate."
Most of the school's pupils
were defying their teachers,
abusing each other, wouldn't
mind, and wouldn't learn. The
teachers responded with harsh and
harsher discipline in order to
counter classroom chaos and
achieve a semblance of academic
goals. Many teachers were
frustrated because they thought
they had failed professionally.
Racial Differences
To complicate matters, most of
the teachers were white and most

of the pupils black.
"It was almost a complete
breakdown of relationships,"
Whitmore recalled recently. "The
kids hated school and the
teachers, and the teachers hated
the kids because they wouldn't
learn and were troublemakers."
Fresh from a highly successful
three years' stint as a teacher of
gifted children in the Cupertino
School District, Whitmore sailed
into this mess with
self-confidence.
Videotaped Interviews
She analyzed the problem
through interviews with pupils
and teachers and videotaped the
interviews so they could be
studied later. She talked to the
kids on the playground, visited
parents and administrators, and
came up with a simple,
horse-sense answer:
Tone down the harsh discipline
and reward good behavior.
She set about making attitudes
change — encouraging teachers to
show more trust and respect for
the students, and showing
recalcitrant students that
constructive behavior got more
rewards than destructive.
She concentrated on Grades
four, five and six — a total of 280
youngsters and eight teachers.

She identified the student
leaders — the "bad guys" as well
as the "good" — and met with
them twice a week for four
months as an unpaid adviser. In
the words of her doctoral thesis,
she sought "to study school
problems and to plan projects
which might contribute to the
development of a more
harmonious and productive
learning environment."
She gradually developed a
system of rewards — display of
classroom banners and insignia for
"good citizenship," appointment
of student monitors, selection of
sixth grade "interns" who worked
with school administrators, and
use of older students as teacher
aides in the kindergarden-primary
classrooms.
Since education is a two-way
street, Whitmore found that
changes in teacher behavior were
necessary, although not always
successful.
Teacher Support
The most promising changes in
classroom behavior came from
rooms where the teachers
supported the program. Two of
the high-resistance types left the
profession, she reported.
Selection of popular students

to assume more responsibility
brought their peer groups with
them, Whitmore found. The
youngsters set up simple rules —
no more playground fights and no
more "putdowns" (derogatory
remarks) to each other or the
teacher.
Among the rewards were
noontime dances to soul music
twice a week, which the older
students wanted and the teachers
opposed. The dances worked out
fine, Whitmore found.
Negative Behavior Cut
When she got through with her
18-month project, she found she
had reduced but not entirely
eliminated the negative behavior.
Of the 64 students in the
study, divided evenly between
boys and girls, 12 out of 32 boys
showed marked improvement. For
some reason, not as many of the
girls improved.
The boys gained self-esteem
and helped establish respect for
each other and their teachers by
being assigned and accepting
responsibility.
Attitudes Shift
Boys with negative attitudes
who were popular with their
classmates were turned around —
they became constructive, she
found.

At a year-end awards
ceremony, she recalled, she was
able to hand out seven medals to
boys who at first had been the
most hostile.
Whitmore found herself almost
immediately forced into a
position as liaison between
teachers and students. Since little
enthusiasm was shown by some
teachers for playground
monitoring, Whitmore found
herself in that job, too.
'Grab Someone'
"When I had to grab someone
by the arm," she said, "I usually
said something like 'You don't
want to be that kind of person, do
you? I know you are capable of
better behavior than that.' It
worked better than sending them
to the principal's office."
Whitmore, the wife of the
Reverend Richard Whitmore of
Burlingame, has written a
"how-to-do-it" manyal for
teachers in similar school
situations which she hopes to have
published.
She also will probably accept
the position of assistant professor
of education at George Peabody
College in Nashville, where she
hopes to study the other side of
the coin — the changing of teacher
attitudes toward their charges.

disruptive classroom behavior,
part of a five-year study originally
headed by Prof. Pauline Sears,
now retired.
For her study, Whitmore chose
a "distressed" Peninsula
elementary school — "distressed'
in this case defined as "those
[schools] in which tension and
conflict predominate."
Most of the school's pupils
were defying their teachers,
abusing each other, wouldn't
mind, and wouldn't learn. The
teachers responded with harsh and
harsher discipline in order to
counter classroom chaos and
achieve a semblance of academic
goals. Many teachers were
frustrated because they thought
they had failed professionally.
Racial Differences
To complicate matters, most of
the teachers were white and most

of the pupils black.
"It was almost a complete
breakdown of relationships,"
Whitmore recalled recently. "The
kids hated school and the
teachers, and the teachers hated
the kids because they wouldn't
learn and were troublemakers."
Fresh from a highly successful
three years' stint as a teacher of
gifted children in the Cupertino
School District, Whitmore sailed
into this mess with
self-confidence.
Videotaped Interviews
She analyzed the problem
through interviews with pupils
and teachers and videotaped the
interviews so they could be
studied later. She talked to the
kids on the playground, visited
parents and administrators, and
came up with a simple,
horse-sense answer:
Tone down the harsh discipline
and reward good behavior.
She set about making attitudes
change — encouraging teachers to
show more trust and respect for
the students, and showing
recalcitrant students that
constructive behavior got more
rewards than destructive.
She concentrated on Grades
four, five and six — a total of 280
youngsters and eight teachers.

She identified the student
leaders — the "bad guys" as well
as the "good" — and met with
them twice a week for four
months as an unpaid adviser. In
the words of her doctoral thesis,
she sought "to study school
problems and to plan projects
which might contribute to the
development of a more
harmonious and productive
learning environment."
She gradually developed a
system of rewards — display of
classroom banners and insignia for
"good citizenship," appointment
of student monitors, selection of
sixth grade "interns" who worked
with school administrators, and
use of older students as teacher
aides in the kindergarden-primary
classrooms.
Since education is a two-way
street, Whitmore found that
changes in teacher behavior were
necessary, although not always
successful.
Teacher Support
The most promising changes in
classroom behavior came from
rooms where the teachers
supported the program. Two of
the high-resistance types left the
profession, she reported.
Selection of popular students

to assume more responsibility
brought their peer groups with
them, Whitmore found. The
youngsters set up simple rules —
no more playground fights and no
more "putdowns" (derogatory
remarks) to each other or the
teacher.
Among the rewards were
noontime dances to soul music
twice a week, which the older
students wanted and the teachers
opposed. The dances worked out
fine, Whitmore found.
Negative Behavior Cut
When she got through with her
18-month project, she found she
had reduced but not entirely
eliminated the negative behavior.
Of the 64 students in the
study, divided evenly between
boys and girls, 12 out of 32 boys
showed marked improvement. For
some reason, not as many of the
girls improved.
The boys gained self-esteem
and helped establish respect for
each other and their teachers by
being assigned and accepting
responsibility.
Attitudes Shift
Boys with negative attitudes
who were popular with their
classmates were turned around —
they became constructive, she
found.

At a year-end awards
ceremony, she recalled, she was
able to hand out seven medals to
boys who at first had been the
most hostile.
Whitmore found herself almost
immediately forced into a
position as liaison between
teachers and students. Since little
enthusiasm was shown by some
teachers for playground
monitoring, Whitmore found
herself in that job, too.
'Grab Someone'
"When I had to grab someone
by the arm," she said, "I usually
said something like 'You don't
want to be that kind of person, do
you? I know you are capable of
better behavior than that.' It
worked better than sending them
to the principal's office."
Whitmore, the wife of the
Reverend Richard Whitmore of
Burlingame, has written a
"how-to-do-it" manyal for
teachers in similar school
situations which she hopes to have
published.
She also will probably accept
the position of assistant professor
of education at George Peabody
College in Nashville, where she
hopes to study the other side of
the coin — the changing of teacher
attitudes toward their charges.
Recipe for changing ringleaders
into student leaders:
Offer rewards instead of
punishment and stir in a generous
mixture of firm educational
psychology.
That was the formula that
worked well for the holder of a
newly-minted Stanford doctorate
in education, Joanne Rand
Whitmore of Burlingame.

Most of the school's pupils
were defying their teachers,
abusing each other, wouldn't
mind, and wouldn't learn. The
teachers responded with harsh and
harsher discipline in order to
counter classroom chaos and
achieve a semblance of academic
goals. Many teachers were
frustrated because they thought
they had failed professionally.
Racial Differences
To complicate matters, most of
the teachers were white and most

of the pupils black.
"It was almost a complete
breakdown of relationships,"
Whitmore recalled recently. "The
kids hated school and the
teachers, and the teachers hated
the kids because they wouldn't
learn and were troublemakers."
Fresh from a highly successful
three years' stint as a teacher of
gifted children in the Cupertino
School District, Whitmore sailed
into this mess with
self-confidence.
Videotaped Interviews
She analyzed the problem
through interviews with pupils
and teachers and videotaped the
interviews so they could be
studied later. She talked to the
kids on the playground, visited
parents and administrators, and
came up with a simple,
horse-sense answer:
Tone down the harsh discipline
and reward good behavior.
She set about making attitudes
change — encouraging teachers to
show more trust and respect for
the students, and showing
recalcitrant students that
constructive behavior got more
rewards than destructive.
She concentrated on Grades
four, five and six — a total of 280
youngsters and eight teachers.

She identified the student
leaders — the "bad guys" as well
as the "good" — and met with
them twice a week for four
months as an unpaid adviser. In
the words of her doctoral thesis,
she sought "to study school
problems and to plan projects
which might contribute to the
development of a more
harmonious and productive
learning environment."
She gradually developed a
system of rewards — display of
classroom banners and insignia for
"good citizenship," appointment
of student monitors, selection of
sixth grade "interns" who worked
with school administrators, and
use of older students as teacher
aides in the kindergarden-primary
classrooms.
Since education is a two-way
street, Whitmore found that
changes in teacher behavior were
necessary, although not always
successful.
Teacher Support
The most promising changes in
classroom behavior came from
rooms where the teachers
supported the program. Two of
the high-resistance types left the
profession, she reported.
Selection of popular students

to assume more responsibility
brought their peer groups with
them, Whitmore found. The
youngsters set up simple rules —
no more playground fights and no
more "putdowns" (derogatory
remarks) to each other or the
teacher.
Among the rewards were
noontime dances to soul music
twice a week, which the older
students wanted and the teachers
opposed. The dances worked out
fine, Whitmore found.
Negative Behavior Cut
When she got through with her
18-month project, she found she
had reduced but not entirely
eliminated the negative behavior.
Of the 64 students in the
study, divided evenly between
boys and girls, 12 out of 32 boys
showed marked improvement. For
some reason, not as many of the
girls improved.
The boys gained self-esteem
and helped establish respect for
each other and their teachers by
being assigned and accepting
responsibility.
Attitudes Shift
Boys with negative attitudes
who were popular with their
classmates were turned around —
they became constructive, she
found.

At a year-end awards
ceremony, she recalled, she was
able to hand out seven medals to
boys who at first had been the
most hostile.
Whitmore found herself almost
immediately forced into a
position as liaison between
teachers and students. Since little
enthusiasm was shown by some
teachers for playground
monitoring, Whitmore found
herself in that job, too.
'Grab Someone'
"When I had to grab someone
by the arm," she said, "I usually
said something like 'You don't
want to be that kind of person, do
you? I know you are capable of
better behavior than that.' It
worked better than sending them
to the principal's office."
Whitmore, the wife of the
Reverend Richard Whitmore of
Burlingame, has written a
"how-to-do-it" manyal for
teachers in similar school
situations which she hopes to have
published.
She also will probably accept
the position of assistant professor
of education at George Peabody
College in Nashville, where she
hopes to study the other side of
the coin — the changing of teacher
attitudes toward their charges.
Recipe for changing ringleaders
into student leaders:
Offer rewards instead of
punishment and stir in a generous
mixture of firm educational
psychology.
That was the formula that
worked well for the holder of a
newly-minted Stanford doctorate
in education, Joanne Rand
Whitmore of Burlingame.
Her project was to modify
disruptive classroom behavior,
part of a five-year study originally
headed by Prof. Pauline Sears,
now retired.
For her study, Whitmore chose
a "distressed" Peninsula
elementary school — "distressed'
in this case defined as "those
[schools] in which tension and
conflict predominate."
Most of the school's pupils
were defying their teachers,
abusing each other, wouldn't
mind, and wouldn't learn. The
teachers responded with harsh and
