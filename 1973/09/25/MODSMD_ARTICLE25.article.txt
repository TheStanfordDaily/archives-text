# Communication Department Activities
## New Undergrad Film Courses Offered 
### BILL WEINSTEIN 
Two new undergraduate film
courses highlight increased
activity in the Communication
Department this fall.
Characterized as "sheer
evolution" by Prof. Henry
Breitrose, the film and
broadcasting section recently
hired three new instructors,
expanded their film library,
scheduled a series of lectures and
will sponsor a film society.
Asst. Prof. Steve Kovacs, one

of the three new faculty members,
will teach Russian Revolutionary
Cinema as part of what he said
was "a new emphasis on culture,
theory, and historical aspects of
film." The course will offer 26
Soviet post-revolutionary films,
including some never before
shown in this country.
'The Soviet films are all very
interesting although some may be
put off because they are Russian
and silent," Kovacs said. "Yet,
they will provide a vision of what

post-war Russia was like."
A new introductory
undergraduate course in film and
video work will also be offered by
new instructor Kris Samuelson.
"Up until now everyone had to
take Com. 200, Visual and Aural
Communications Techniques,"
Kovacs said. 'This will be a more
basic film course where everyone
will have a crack at film — to see
if their heart is in film," he added.
In addition to the emphasis on
film aesthetics, screen-writing will

be upgraded with the hiring of
Julian Blaustein. Blaustein, who
will also be involved in film
production, produced many major
films, including Three Into Two
Won't Go and Kharioum, as well
as 250 documentary films during
World War 11.
A lecture program wiii also
begin with Italian director
Roberto Rosellini's appearance
here Oct. 25.
Kovacs hopes these new classes
and lectures will generate more
interest in films by students. "I'm
trying to organize a film society
of undergraduates and graduates"
which, he said, would eventually
take charge of the speaker
program and create new film
series.
To supplement the new
offerings, $3000 was used to
purchase new films for the film
library. Among those bought were
Ivan the Terrible, Blue Angel,
Citizen Kane, The Passion of Joan
of Arc, and Potemkin.
The expanded program does
not mean, however, that the film
section is altering its goals. "We
have no plans of becoming a USC
film school," Kovacs said. "We
will never be a film factory of any
sorts."
Breitrose added, 'To borrow
an expression from William Miller
[University provost] we are being
innovative within a dynamic
steady state. We're doing these
changes within the budget of our
own department."
Many of the changes in the
section came as a result of student
requests, Breitrose said. "I think it
is very important to do interesting
things, to be responsive to the
needs of the students," he said.
Kovacs said that the new
programs should raise the quality
of all the film courses as well as
provide more variety in the
courses offered to undergraduates.

will have a crack at film — to see
if their heart is in film," he added.
In addition to the emphasis on
film aesthetics, screen-writing will

be upgraded with the hiring of
Julian Blaustein. Blaustein, who
will also be involved in film
production, produced many major
films, including Three Into Two
Won't Go and Kharioum, as well
as 250 documentary films during
World War 11.
A lecture program wiii also
begin with Italian director
Roberto Rosellini's appearance
here Oct. 25.
Kovacs hopes these new classes
and lectures will generate more
interest in films by students. "I'm
trying to organize a film society
of undergraduates and graduates"
which, he said, would eventually
take charge of the speaker
program and create new film
series.
To supplement the new
offerings, $3000 was used to
purchase new films for the film
library. Among those bought were
Ivan the Terrible, Blue Angel,
Citizen Kane, The Passion of Joan
of Arc, and Potemkin.
The expanded program does
not mean, however, that the film
section is altering its goals. "We
have no plans of becoming a USC
film school," Kovacs said. "We
will never be a film factory of any
sorts."
Breitrose added, 'To borrow
an expression from William Miller
[University provost] we are being
innovative within a dynamic
steady state. We're doing these
changes within the budget of our
own department."
Many of the changes in the
section came as a result of student
requests, Breitrose said. "I think it
is very important to do interesting
things, to be responsive to the
needs of the students," he said.
Kovacs said that the new
programs should raise the quality
of all the film courses as well as
provide more variety in the
courses offered to undergraduates.
Two new undergraduate film
courses highlight increased
activity in the Communication
Department this fall.
Characterized as "sheer
evolution" by Prof. Henry
Breitrose, the film and
broadcasting section recently
hired three new instructors,
expanded their film library,
scheduled a series of lectures and
will sponsor a film society.
Asst. Prof. Steve Kovacs, one

of the three new faculty members,
will teach Russian Revolutionary
Cinema as part of what he said
was "a new emphasis on culture,
theory, and historical aspects of
film." The course will offer 26
Soviet post-revolutionary films,
including some never before
shown in this country.
'The Soviet films are all very
interesting although some may be
put off because they are Russian
and silent," Kovacs said. "Yet,
they will provide a vision of what

post-war Russia was like."
A new introductory
undergraduate course in film and
video work will also be offered by
new instructor Kris Samuelson.
"Up until now everyone had to
take Com. 200, Visual and Aural
Communications Techniques,"
Kovacs said. 'This will be a more
basic film course where everyone
will have a crack at film — to see
if their heart is in film," he added.
