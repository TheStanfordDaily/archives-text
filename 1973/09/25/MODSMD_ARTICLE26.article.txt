NEW YORK (AP) - Martha
Mitchell says she wants her
husband back.
The wife of John N. Mitchell,
the indicted former U.S. attorney
general, said in a television
interview that she feels
"abandoned" and "mentally
tortured."
"Well I guess he's mad at me
for throwing his clothes out for
one thing," Mrs. Mitchell told
Claire Crawford of NBC News in
the interview taped here Friday
for broadcast Sunday night.
"And then I think he thinks

that I'm just overly wrought and
that I should have some kind of
care," she said in her spacious
Fifth Avenue apartment. "But I'm
not, I'm not at a 11..."
Mrs. Mitchell said the clothing
incident involved throwing a "few
ties and a few shirts" into a foyer
because "I got mad like any
woman does" after no one
bothered to inform her about a
postponement of her husband's
trial.
Mitchell and former Commerce
Secretary Maurice Stans are under
indictment on perjury,

obstruction and conspiracy
charges in connection with a
secret $200,000 contribution to
President Nixon's re-election
campaign by fugitive financier
Robert L. Vesco.
The former attorney general
reportedly left his apartment two
weeks ago. .
Asked: "Would you like him to
come back?" Mrs. Mitchell said,
"Of course, of course."
"The suggestion of divorce has
only been through the media,"
Mrs. Mitchell said, complaining
that "somebody mimics my voice
all the time." Late-night
telephone conversations from Mrs.
Mitchell to reporters have been
widely published in the past.
Asked why she granted the
interview, she responded:
"Well the reason I agreed was
because of these, these nasty
horrible stories that these lawyers
have put out against me and,
number two, that my mail has
now begun to say they're sorry
I'm in the hospital, to please take
care of myself ...
"So I decided it was time for
me to tell the American public
that I am sitting in my apartment,
I'm perfectly capable of doing
anything I want to do and there's
absolutely nothing wrong with
me, except I'm mentally tortured
from the torture I'm being put
through."
She was asked whether she had
ever been hospitalized for a
nervous ailment.
"I've never been committed to
anything ... except the good of
my country," Mrs. Mitchell
replied.
