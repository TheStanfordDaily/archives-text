# Oil Companies Seek Recourse

STATELINE, Nev. (AP) â€” The head of an independent oil firm
says major oil companies have "been pushed around enough" in Libya
and will seek recourse in international court.
Mary Hudson, president of the Hudson Oil Co., told newsmen at
the Pacific Oil Conference here Friday that Libya recently took over
all major oil company interests and is "pricing oil outrageously high."
"Oil companies feel they have been pushed around enough and
now they're ready to go to court with them. That's what is going to
be done," she said.
Asked whether she thought the United States might become
involved in a war with Libya if legal efforts failed, she said "it's a little
hard for me to answer that question."
'They might not have to go to war because the Arabs would have
to form a union and up to now they haven't been able to get
together," she said.
"And if they're not together, there would be no necessity of going
to war with Libya because there's plenty of oil in other areas," she
said.
Earlier during the conference Hudson called on the federal
government to enforce a fair market system to prevent independents
from being squeezed out by major oil companies.
She said that present economic conditions favor monopolistic
practices by oil firms.
Hudson said that unless government controls are imposed to
help the independents, all gasoline stations will be owned by refineries
and will be run by their employees.
