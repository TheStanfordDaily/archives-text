# Reagan Removes 'Lightfoot' As Native American Adviser
## 
### 
Gov. Ronald Reagan last
month dismissed H.D. "Timm"
Williams, long-time football
mascot here, as his adviser for
native American affairs.
Williams was the first high-level
adviser on native American
matters to any California
governor. He is a full-blooded
Yurok and had served as Reagan's
liaison to the state's 200,000
native Americans since 1971.
As "Prince Lightfoot,"
Williams danced in Indian garb for
Stanford fans during 20
consecutive football seasons.
President Lyman eliminated the
Indian symbol early in 1972 after
native American students here
complained that it presented "a
gross misconception of the

Indian."
James E. Jenkins, director of
public affairs and spokesman for
Reagan, said the governor had
fired Williams because he did not
fulfill certain conditions of his
contract.
While refusing to elaborate on
specific failures, Jenkins said
Williams did "absolutely nothing"
to solve native American
problems.
Williams said, "1 haven't been
able to get along with the Reagan
staff. . . because I have been

persistent in pushing Indian
programs."
Although he received $18,000
a year to serve as Reagan's adviser,
Williams said he had met with the
governor only twice during his
term. The first time he had his
picture taken with Reagan; the
second time he and a group of
native American leaders met with
him.
Williams said the purpose of
the second meeting was "to keep
the Indian in line."
