# Sequoia Shows 'Engaging' Writing
## 
### PETER PESIC 
The latest issue of the Sequoia
(Summer, 1973) is quite an
impressive collection of work. In
this attractively composed and
illustrated issue one can find
many interesting and' engaging
pieces of new writing by Stanford
authors. Herewith a few
comments on some of the items
that particularly attracted my
attention.
Mark Loughridge's sequence of
poems from "A Potter's Journal"
is especially noteworthy. A series
of short poems which describe the
process of throwing and firing a
pot, it shows a remarkable control
of language and a knack for vivid
imagery.
Consider such passages as
"once alive upon/ a flying wheel/
it grew, rising/ from the thin/
metal plate as/ a swan surfacing/
from a dive beneath/ the still
pond."
I admire here the terseness of
expression combined with a
striking and visually fascinating
image. The poems are full of nice
touches, and show the imprint of
a skillful and sure maker.
Formally, I find them the most
innovative items in the issue.
Loughridge uses short stanzas
which are, at times, as
concentrated as haiku. This form
intensifies the tactility and
visuality of his images.
Finally, the connections
between the process of pottery
and more general processes of

growth and creation are
engagingly and subtly drawn.
Loughridge's work is especially
notable since he is a freshman.
Short, Convincing Lyric
Dana Gioia has contributed an
excellent group of poems. Best, in
my opinion, is "Vocation," a
short, (seven line) lyric remarkable
for its evocative power and
convincing atmosphere. It recalls
J. Alfred Prafrock, walking by the
seashore and hearing the
mermaids' call.
In Gioia's poem, Prufrock
walks again: "Silver hair streams
in the foam,/ Hands beckon.
Knowing that they/ call us, we
hesitate and run." This is one of
the finest things in the issue, and a
very well-wrought poem.
His two "Songs" are also quite
good, and"The Letter" is an
interesting experiment in using a
strict metrical scheme in language
which is rather prosaic.
Eloquent Epitaph
I enjoyed David Barton's
"Epitaph for Theodore
Wratislaw," a witty and archly
eloquent poem about a refined
Polish poet (probably imaginary,
alas) who describes himself as "a
second-rate aesthete/ and true
Count of Bohemia/ by lineal
descent."
The note of elaborate elegance
is punctuated by funny
incongruities: "the dark repose/
of too many summer gardens/
scented with woodbine/ and roses
that shook apart/ like little

harlots."
Judith Cody's "Akhenaton's
Hymn to Aton" is a very fine
evocation of a prayer by the great,
mysterious Egyptian
pharaoh-heretic who sought to
establish the cult of the solar disk,
the True God Aton, and eradicate
the dark polytheism of his fathers,
symbolized by his father's god
Amon. She has caught well the
impassioned awkwardness that
strikes one in reading the extant
Egyptian texts.
Awkward Misprint
The poem is altogether an
original and effective work. There
seems to be an unfortunate
misprint in the first line that
makes the poem hard to construe:
the first line is "Iris, moonbearer
flame of Osiris" and one wonders
whether it is Isis rather than Iris,
since Isis and Osiris are
companions, husband and wife, in
the Egyptian myth of the dying
and rising god.
Michael Stillman is represented
by a haiku, which deserves
quotation in full: "Telling
fantasies/ so ardently she/ has
walked through the spider's web."
This poem, one of a long series of
haiku I understand he has been
writing, demonstrates a
remarkable transmutation of the
Japanese form into English
poetry.
The combination of a specific
sensual image and a felt reaction
which characterizes the greatest
Japanese haiku is well realized

here — the subtle surprise of the
spider's web, the atmosphere of
passionate absorption suddenly
disturbed. It is too short a form to
be philosophical or discursive, so
any larger connections must be
brought to mind by specific,
highly charged images.
Effective Short Story
Nora Eisenberg's short story
"Sunday Afternoon" is
remarkable for achieving a
convincing tone and drawing the
reader deftly through a narrative
in the brief compass of slightly
more than two pages. Eisenberg's
style has clearly been informed by
Virginia Woolf, whose technique
of "narrated monologue" has
been used here to good effect.
Eisenberg's characters,
however, inhabit a different social
milieu than Woolfs; her lovers
broil in New York City. The
humor is deft and well-used. This
story is enjoyable despite some
reservations about the
commonplaceness of the situation
as reflected in the language: "He
had been so brown when she first
saw him, so strong" or "They
both loved Mexican food — they
shared everything it seemed
sometimes."
In "Justo Villegas," Javier Silva
has crafted an interesting
character in Justo and the story of
his life in a small Mexican town,
in his dealings with women and

burros. Silva's sense of style and
voice is good and quite convinces
the reader.
There is a slight problem with
the use of Spanish words
unknown to the average
English-speaking reader; generally
Silva uses them effectively in
establishing the character of
Justo, but in one or two places it
becomes a bit awkward.
Stephen Babson's "The
Impressionist" is a wild and
woolly story about John Lawson,
"painter and chauffeur," pursuing
Lucinda as the vision of ideal
beauty and the completion of his
current canvas. It is alternately
engaging and annoying, having
many good touches (such as the
takeover of Lucinda's campus by
four Jewish radicals) and some
stereotypes (such as the
over-dressed preppie Singer who,
of course, becomes drunk and
obnoxious). It is perhaps too cute,
but is interesting nonetheless and
draws the reader along well.
Mark Rathbun's drawings are a
real contribution to the issue. He
exhibits a greater variety of styles
than he has previously. His funky
comic-book style is less pleasing
then his others. His drawings are
well suited to the pieces they
accompany.
Reading this issue of the
Sequoia is an interesting and
rewarding experience.

had been so brown when she first
saw him, so strong" or "They
both loved Mexican food — they
shared everything it seemed
sometimes."
In "Justo Villegas," Javier Silva
has crafted an interesting
character in Justo and the story of
his life in a small Mexican town,
in his dealings with women and

burros. Silva's sense of style and
voice is good and quite convinces
the reader.
There is a slight problem with
the use of Spanish words
unknown to the average
English-speaking reader; generally
Silva uses them effectively in
establishing the character of
Justo, but in one or two places it
becomes a bit awkward.
Stephen Babson's "The
Impressionist" is a wild and
woolly story about John Lawson,
"painter and chauffeur," pursuing
Lucinda as the vision of ideal
beauty and the completion of his
current canvas. It is alternately
engaging and annoying, having
many good touches (such as the
takeover of Lucinda's campus by
four Jewish radicals) and some
stereotypes (such as the
over-dressed preppie Singer who,
of course, becomes drunk and
obnoxious). It is perhaps too cute,
but is interesting nonetheless and
draws the reader along well.
Mark Rathbun's drawings are a
real contribution to the issue. He
exhibits a greater variety of styles
than he has previously. His funky
comic-book style is less pleasing
then his others. His drawings are
well suited to the pieces they
accompany.
Reading this issue of the
Sequoia is an interesting and
rewarding experience.

The latest issue of the Sequoia
(Summer, 1973) is quite an
impressive collection of work. In
this attractively composed and
illustrated issue one can find
many interesting and' engaging
pieces of new writing by Stanford
authors. Herewith a few
comments on some of the items
that particularly attracted my
attention.
Mark Loughridge's sequence of
poems from "A Potter's Journal"
is especially noteworthy. A series
of short poems which describe the
process of throwing and firing a
pot, it shows a remarkable control
of language and a knack for vivid
imagery.
Consider such passages as
"once alive upon/ a flying wheel/
it grew, rising/ from the thin/
metal plate as/ a swan surfacing/
from a dive beneath/ the still
pond."
I admire here the terseness of
expression combined with a
striking and visually fascinating
image. The poems are full of nice
touches, and show the imprint of
a skillful and sure maker.
Formally, I find them the most
innovative items in the issue.
Loughridge uses short stanzas
which are, at times, as
concentrated as haiku. This form
intensifies the tactility and
visuality of his images.
Finally, the connections
between the process of pottery
and more general processes of

growth and creation are
engagingly and subtly drawn.
Loughridge's work is especially
notable since he is a freshman.
Short, Convincing Lyric
Dana Gioia has contributed an
excellent group of poems. Best, in
my opinion, is "Vocation," a
short, (seven line) lyric remarkable
for its evocative power and
convincing atmosphere. It recalls
J. Alfred Prafrock, walking by the
seashore and hearing the
mermaids' call.
In Gioia's poem, Prufrock
walks again: "Silver hair streams
in the foam,/ Hands beckon.
Knowing that they/ call us, we
hesitate and run." This is one of
the finest things in the issue, and a
very well-wrought poem.
His two "Songs" are also quite
good, and"The Letter" is an
interesting experiment in using a
strict metrical scheme in language
which is rather prosaic.
Eloquent Epitaph
I enjoyed David Barton's
"Epitaph for Theodore
Wratislaw," a witty and archly
eloquent poem about a refined
Polish poet (probably imaginary,
alas) who describes himself as "a
second-rate aesthete/ and true
Count of Bohemia/ by lineal
descent."
The note of elaborate elegance
is punctuated by funny
incongruities: "the dark repose/
of too many summer gardens/
scented with woodbine/ and roses
that shook apart/ like little

harlots."
Judith Cody's "Akhenaton's
Hymn to Aton" is a very fine
evocation of a prayer by the great,
mysterious Egyptian
pharaoh-heretic who sought to
establish the cult of the solar disk,
the True God Aton, and eradicate
the dark polytheism of his fathers,
symbolized by his father's god
Amon. She has caught well the
impassioned awkwardness that
strikes one in reading the extant
Egyptian texts.
Awkward Misprint
The poem is altogether an
original and effective work. There
seems to be an unfortunate
misprint in the first line that
makes the poem hard to construe:
the first line is "Iris, moonbearer
flame of Osiris" and one wonders
whether it is Isis rather than Iris,
since Isis and Osiris are
companions, husband and wife, in
the Egyptian myth of the dying
and rising god.
Michael Stillman is represented
by a haiku, which deserves
quotation in full: "Telling
fantasies/ so ardently she/ has
walked through the spider's web."
This poem, one of a long series of
haiku I understand he has been
writing, demonstrates a
remarkable transmutation of the
Japanese form into English
poetry.
The combination of a specific
sensual image and a felt reaction
which characterizes the greatest
Japanese haiku is well realized

here — the subtle surprise of the
spider's web, the atmosphere of
passionate absorption suddenly
disturbed. It is too short a form to
be philosophical or discursive, so
any larger connections must be
brought to mind by specific,
highly charged images.
Effective Short Story
Nora Eisenberg's short story
"Sunday Afternoon" is
remarkable for achieving a
convincing tone and drawing the
reader deftly through a narrative
in the brief compass of slightly
more than two pages. Eisenberg's
style has clearly been informed by
Virginia Woolf, whose technique
of "narrated monologue" has
been used here to good effect.
Eisenberg's characters,
however, inhabit a different social
milieu than Woolfs; her lovers
broil in New York City. The
humor is deft and well-used. This
story is enjoyable despite some
reservations about the
commonplaceness of the situation
as reflected in the language: "He
had been so brown when she first
saw him, so strong" or "They
both loved Mexican food — they
shared everything it seemed
sometimes."

strikes one in reading the extant
Egyptian texts.
Awkward Misprint
The poem is altogether an
original and effective work. There
seems to be an unfortunate
misprint in the first line that
makes the poem hard to construe:
the first line is "Iris, moonbearer
flame of Osiris" and one wonders
whether it is Isis rather than Iris,
since Isis and Osiris are
companions, husband and wife, in
the Egyptian myth of the dying
and rising god.
Michael Stillman is represented
by a haiku, which deserves
quotation in full: "Telling
fantasies/ so ardently she/ has
walked through the spider's web."
This poem, one of a long series of
haiku I understand he has been
writing, demonstrates a
remarkable transmutation of the
Japanese form into English
poetry.
The combination of a specific
sensual image and a felt reaction
which characterizes the greatest
Japanese haiku is well realized

here — the subtle surprise of the
spider's web, the atmosphere of
passionate absorption suddenly
disturbed. It is too short a form to
be philosophical or discursive, so
any larger connections must be
brought to mind by specific,
highly charged images.
Effective Short Story
Nora Eisenberg's short story
"Sunday Afternoon" is
remarkable for achieving a
convincing tone and drawing the
reader deftly through a narrative
in the brief compass of slightly
more than two pages. Eisenberg's
style has clearly been informed by
Virginia Woolf, whose technique
of "narrated monologue" has
been used here to good effect.
Eisenberg's characters,
however, inhabit a different social
milieu than Woolfs; her lovers
broil in New York City. The
humor is deft and well-used. This
story is enjoyable despite some
reservations about the
commonplaceness of the situation
as reflected in the language: "He
had been so brown when she first
saw him, so strong" or "They
both loved Mexican food — they
shared everything it seemed
sometimes."
In "Justo Villegas," Javier Silva
has crafted an interesting
character in Justo and the story of
his life in a small Mexican town,
in his dealings with women and

burros. Silva's sense of style and
voice is good and quite convinces
the reader.
There is a slight problem with
the use of Spanish words
unknown to the average
English-speaking reader; generally
Silva uses them effectively in
establishing the character of
Justo, but in one or two places it
becomes a bit awkward.
Stephen Babson's "The
Impressionist" is a wild and
woolly story about John Lawson,
"painter and chauffeur," pursuing
Lucinda as the vision of ideal
beauty and the completion of his
current canvas. It is alternately
engaging and annoying, having
many good touches (such as the
takeover of Lucinda's campus by
four Jewish radicals) and some
stereotypes (such as the
over-dressed preppie Singer who,
of course, becomes drunk and
obnoxious). It is perhaps too cute,
but is interesting nonetheless and
draws the reader along well.
Mark Rathbun's drawings are a
real contribution to the issue. He
exhibits a greater variety of styles
than he has previously. His funky
comic-book style is less pleasing
then his others. His drawings are
well suited to the pieces they
accompany.
Reading this issue of the
Sequoia is an interesting and
rewarding experience.

death of rock superstar Jimi Hendrix, by recounting his life story
through his music. In this scene from the film, Hendrix is shown
arriving in Denmark for a concert tour.
The latest issue of the Sequoia
(Summer, 1973) is quite an
impressive collection of work. In
this attractively composed and
illustrated issue one can find
many interesting and' engaging
pieces of new writing by Stanford
authors. Herewith a few
comments on some of the items
that particularly attracted my
attention.
Mark Loughridge's sequence of
poems from "A Potter's Journal"
is especially noteworthy. A series
of short poems which describe the
process of throwing and firing a
pot, it shows a remarkable control
of language and a knack for vivid
imagery.
Consider such passages as
"once alive upon/ a flying wheel/
it grew, rising/ from the thin/
metal plate as/ a swan surfacing/
from a dive beneath/ the still
pond."
I admire here the terseness of
expression combined with a
striking and visually fascinating
image. The poems are full of nice
touches, and show the imprint of
a skillful and sure maker.
Formally, I find them the most
innovative items in the issue.
Loughridge uses short stanzas
which are, at times, as
concentrated as haiku. This form
intensifies the tactility and
visuality of his images.
Finally, the connections
between the process of pottery
and more general processes of

growth and creation are
engagingly and subtly drawn.
Loughridge's work is especially
notable since he is a freshman.
Short, Convincing Lyric
Dana Gioia has contributed an
excellent group of poems. Best, in
my opinion, is "Vocation," a
short, (seven line) lyric remarkable
for its evocative power and
convincing atmosphere. It recalls
J. Alfred Prafrock, walking by the
seashore and hearing the
mermaids' call.
In Gioia's poem, Prufrock
walks again: "Silver hair streams
in the foam,/ Hands beckon.
Knowing that they/ call us, we
hesitate and run." This is one of
the finest things in the issue, and a
very well-wrought poem.
His two "Songs" are also quite
good, and"The Letter" is an
interesting experiment in using a
strict metrical scheme in language
which is rather prosaic.
Eloquent Epitaph
I enjoyed David Barton's
"Epitaph for Theodore
Wratislaw," a witty and archly
eloquent poem about a refined
Polish poet (probably imaginary,
alas) who describes himself as "a
second-rate aesthete/ and true
Count of Bohemia/ by lineal
descent."
The note of elaborate elegance
is punctuated by funny
incongruities: "the dark repose/
of too many summer gardens/
scented with woodbine/ and roses
that shook apart/ like little

harlots."
Judith Cody's "Akhenaton's
Hymn to Aton" is a very fine
evocation of a prayer by the great,
mysterious Egyptian
pharaoh-heretic who sought to
establish the cult of the solar disk,
the True God Aton, and eradicate
the dark polytheism of his fathers,
symbolized by his father's god
Amon. She has caught well the
impassioned awkwardness that
strikes one in reading the extant
Egyptian texts.
Awkward Misprint

original and effective work. There
seems to be an unfortunate
misprint in the first line that
makes the poem hard to construe:
