# Professor Blasts Chilean Coup
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
SAN FRANCISCO — A Stanford
faculty member who was in Santiago,
Chile during the military coup that
overthrew Marxist President Salvadore
Allende earlier this month told a press
conference here yesterday that "you
cannot expect a country such as Chile
to live under a military government
indefinitely."
Spanish Prof. Fernando Alegria
added that "most of the changes
achieved by the government of
Salvadore Allende are irreversible." He
specifically referred to the
nationalization of foreign-owned
copper mines in Chile.
Alegria, who has been on a leave of
absence from the faculty since his
appointment as counselor to the
Chilean embassy in Washington, D.C.
in 1971, was a close personal friend of
Allende.
'Sadness'
"The Chilean people have a great
weight of sadness, of fear, of horror on
their hearts," in the wake of the coup
and Allende's death, according to
Alegria.
He said he has "the conviction that
President Allende died fighting ... for
what he believed, the cause of social
justice and the liberation of the
Chilean people." Military officials had
said that Allende committed suicide in
the presidential palace in Santiago.
Alegria called for the United

Nations commission now in Santiago
to thoroughly investigate charges of
mass executions after the coup. He
also endorsed Senate Majority Leader
Mike Mansfield's suggestion that the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee
investigate the circumstances leading
up to Allende's overthrow.
When he left Chile Sunday, Allegria
said "no publication of the left or
publications of any kind which differ
with the junta were able to come out
on the street." He urged a return of
"common sense" and traditional
political activity in Chile as soon as
possible.
Chilean Counselor
Alegria joined the Stanford faculty
in 1967 after teaching Latin American
literature at Berkeley for 20 years.
Allende appointed him counselor to
the Chilean embassy in charge of
cultural affairs, the third-ranking post
in the embassy.
He arrived in Chile 10 days before
the coup and was able to leave the
country with no difficulty, even
though travel outside Chile has been
severely restricted by the junta.
Alegria and English Prof. John
Felstiner will speak at a Chile teach-in
tomorrow at 7:30 p.m. in Cubberley
Auditorium. The Concerned Latin
American Scholars at Stanford, the
Stanford Committee on Political
Education and the Faculty Political
Action Group are co-sponsors of the

teach-in.
Felstiner served for a time as an
interpreter for the late Pablo Neruda,
the Nobel Prize winning Chilean poet
who died of cancer Sunday. The
English professor accompanied Alegria
to yesterday's press conference.

WHAT A MESS — It looks a bit like Kraa the Unhuman has been ravaging the countryside here. But it's only the erection
of Stanford's new law school, proceeding more or less on schedule.
