# Documentary Examines Jimi Hendrix With Superficial, Haunting Imagery
## 
### ELLEN KENESHEA 
Jimi Hendrix is an interesting
documentary film about a
compelling figure in a fascinating
milieu, that of the superstar, the
pop hero, individuals who are
cults unto themselves.
The film itself is far less
flamboyant than its subject who
was one of "acid rock's" most
colorful and talented artists.
Hendrix was, says the Rolling
Stone's own superstar Mick
Jagger, "just amazing. He blew me
head off completely."

Jimi Hendrix does not quite
bear out Jagger's viewpoint, but
only because the film never fully
captures the tremendous energy
and flair of a live Hendrix
performance.
Still, though it isn't easy to
judge Hendrix's magnetism, Jimi
Hendrix does recall memories of
the aura the surrounded the
young star, and some wistful, sad
thoughts of a younger and
brighter period for rock and roll.
Star's Chronology
Footage of Hendrix's live
performances punctuates the

interviews that form the bulk of
the film. Both have been edited
together to give a fairly
chronological account of
Hendrix's rise to fame and
subsequent death from an
overdose of drugs only five years
later.
Though interesting, the
interviews are not insightful.
Interviewees give us fitful glimpses
of Hendrix as he was, but not of
why he should have been so.
Almost everyone, from his
father to ex-girlfriends to other
prominent members of rock

society, agrees that Hendrix was
shy, self-conscious, and naive.
This may be true, but it doesn't
help to explain his stage presence,
his act, his artistry. For as the
faces pass, and those who knew
him talk about knowing him, the
man himself recedes.
Enigmatic Subject
Perhaps it is inevitable that
films like Jimi Hendrix must treat
their subjects as enigmas.
Certainly Joe Boyd who
produced, John Head who
researched and Gary Weiss who
assembled the visuals for the film
culled through available
information thoroughly and
found out and kept such material
as they considered most relevant.
They may be blamed for a certain
lack of imagination and style in
the finah production, but probably
not for insufficient research.
For Hendrix himself says at
one point, "When I'm on stage
I'm a complete natural." But
then, no film will ever fathom
what he was all about, for it is on
stage, his head thrown back, eyes
closed, tongue licking in and out
of his open mouth, lost to all
except the music he makes, that
Hendrix is most mysterious and
unknowable.
Haunting Imagery
His father recounts an
anecdote about Jimi as a child,
deprived of his guitar until he has
swept his bedroom, but instead of
sweeping, he sits on the end of his
bed strumming the broom. The
image of this child, the passionate
guitar player, haunts the film.
That and the image of the star.
Because Jimi Hendrix was a star,
as Little Richard puts it,"the
only trouble was he never got
pulled out of the Dipper and back
into the world."
