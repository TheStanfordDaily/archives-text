# A Guide To Gustatory Goodies And Multitudinous Media
## 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
(Editor's Note: This is the
second in a two part series aimed
at describing what to do for fun,
excitement and entertainment in
the Bay Area. Today, we
concentrate not only on places to
visit — namely restaurants — but
also on what you can see by
opening your eyes, ears and mind
to local mass media.)
WHERE TO EAT
Even students are like most
people in one respect — they love
to eat, particularly when the
featured fare is a gastronomical
delight without astronomical
prices. Although the
UNIVERSITY FOOD SERVICE
acts as the major feeding source
for many students, the Stanford
area abounds in choice spots for
those wishing different varieties of
food at almost any time of day.
On campus, the recently
remodeled COFFEE HOUSE
(located in Tresidder) serves as a
gathering place for chess players,
pinball wizards and those who
simply want a sandwich and
drink. The coffee house usually
remains open past midnight.
Adjacent to the coffee house is
the TRESIDDER CAFETERIA
(open nightly until 8 p.m.) which
serves complete lunches and
dinners and features a special
Sunday morning brunch.
Branching out onto the
peninsula, a multitude of
restaurants encompass the area.
Naturally, we can't mention all of
them but we will outline a few.
For those nights when you've got
to have a snack, MACDONALDS,
JACK IN THE BOX, KENTUCKY
FRIED CHICKEN and even H.
SALT ESQUIRE fish and chips
are available along the El Camino
for quick comfort and,
sometimes, heartburn.
For inexpensive meals, the
STANFORD BARN (our version
of LA's Farmers Market) provides
a wide variety of food at
reasonable prices. If you must
have steak, try the SIZZLER in
Palo Alto or Mt. View.
Good semi-expensive
restaurants in the area include:
THE REFECTORY (for meat and
lobster), WINERY (for steak),
MING'S (for Chinese food) and
L' OMLETTE (French cuisine).
The super expensive restaurants
are the COTE D' AZUR and
L'AUBERGE, both French, both
excellent — if you want to impress
someone, take them to either one.
Naturally, out of the way

places are often good to try.
Don't let the exterior scare you
away from FRANKIE AND
LUIGI'S in Mt. View, which, for
example, offers excellent Italian
food. THE VILLAGE PUB in
Woodside and LA MERE
MICHELLE in Saratoga are also
worth visiting.

Of course, for a change of
style, there's always San
Francisco, restaurant capital of
the western United States. The
fanciest restaurants here are:
ERNIES, the BLUE FOX, and
TRADER VIC. If fancy isn't your
bag, then experiment — it's worth
doing - at FISHERMAN'S
WHARF, THE CANNERY,
CHINATOWN, GHIRARDELLI
SQUARE or UNION STREET.
If you come, upon any
restaurants that entice your
appetite, let us know because
we'll be running our own
restaurant review column in
future weeks and would love to
receive suggestions as to where
our columnist's next meal should
come from.

THE MEDIA
Television
Incredible though it may
sound, a poll taken last year
revealed that Stanford students do
indeed watch television. The
major Bay Area network affiliated
stations are: KPIX (Channel 5,

CBS), KRON (Channel 4, NBC),
KGO (Channel 7, ABC) and
KQED (Channel 9, Public
Broadcast System). KTVU
(Channel 2) is an independent
station specializing in movies
(particularly the highly rated
horror film series Creature
Features ) and re-runs of old
shows.

UHF stations KEMO (Channel
20), KBHK (Channel 44) and
KGSC ("the perfect 36") also
feature old movies and re-runs of
more of our cancelled favorites.
Recommended local shows
include: Jim Dunbar's AM (an
interview-phone in show weekday
mornings, 7 to 9 on Channel 7)
and Belva Davis' Altogether Now

(oriented toward the black
experience, Sundays at 10:30
p.m. on Channel 5.)
Newswise, KGO Newscene is
the area's highest rated program.
Also called "happy-talk" news,
this show, with anchorman Van
Amberg, is a good source of
information although, at times,
overly sensational. KPIX
Eyewitness News tries to be cute
but fails although it does cover
events adequately.
KRON's Newswatch is
probably the most serious and
comprehensive, yet it too stays
fresh with features like
"Newsreel" and "Four Country,"
and reporters like Sportscaster
Eddie Alexander, who ends each
telecast with his immortal "Good
luck, everybody." KTVU's Ten
O'clock Report is good if you
have to watch the news later in
the evening but don't want to stay
up past 11 p.m. To see the
original conversational approach
in reporting complete with a
sometimes overly liberal bias yet a
very intensive study of events, try
KQED's Newsroom with Mel Wax.
Radio
Being a loyal Stanford student,
your first inclination might be to
wonder if the University radio
station merits your attention. In
public affairs and news, it does,
including broadcasts of home
football games. In music,
programming is up to the
individual disc jockey and must be
so judged. It may range from
opera to blue grass to rock to easy
listening material. ... KZSU
recently went stereo and
broadcasts on 90.1 FM. In some
dorms, it runs thru house current
and can be tuned on 8:80 AM.

Local commercial radio varies
from awful to pretty good and
because San Francisco is an
excellent market, there's a lot to
choose from. Recommended
pop-rock stations are: AM—KYA
(1260), KFRC (610), KLOK
(1170 for oldies); FM—KARA
(105.7, particularly good for
oldies), KYA FM (93.3), KFRC
FM (106), KlOl (101.3), KSFX
(103.7), and KSAN (95.7, a
"progressive" rock station with
hip-sounding djs).
For middle of the road music,
listen to (AM) KSFO (550), which
also broadcasts Stanford football
and SF Giants games) and KNBR
(740). The best local country
music station is KEEN (1370 AM)
which also broadcasts Oakland A's
baseball. KGO is the area's
"people to people" talk station,
so if you have a gripe, here's the
place to vent it for all to hear.
Local sex-talk programs include
KNEW's (910 AM) California
Girls and California Guys and
Russ Syracuse's Love Line (after
midnight on KSFO).
Movies
Stanford students need never
fear for the scarcity of film
entertainment on campus. Almost
any night of the week, some
group is probably sponsoring the
showing of a movie, from the
crazy antics of the Marx Brothers
to the culture of natives in South
America.
The Public Events Board is
running a Charlie Chaplin Festival
early in the quarter. Tresidder
Films (usually on Friday nights
and costing $1) and the Law
School Film Society (usually for
50 cents) screen movies
throughout the quarter. Each

Sunday night, ASSU Flicks
screens a film in Memorial
Auditorium for 50 cents a person.
Note: there is always an early and
a late showing. Season tickets,
which eliminate waiting in line,
are available today at a booth in
Maples Pavilion for $5.50. This
Sunday, Neil Simon's The
Heartbreak Kid will be shown at
7 and 9:15 p.m.
In the past, there have been
problems with noisy crowds but
Flicks manager Bob Sisson doesn't
anticipate any this year. Of
course, he wonders, as do we all,
whether the belcher will return to
haunt the balcony again.
The Palo Alto area
compliments Stanford nicely with
an amazing variety and number of

movie theaters. They are:
the Aquarius One and Two,
Bijou, Kine Arts, Palo Alto
Square, Stanford and Varsity. In
Sunnyvale, the Hacienda Cinema
building houses three theatres.
For viewing of proven classic
films, try the Festival Cinema in
Palo Alto.
The Paris Theater features
adult films. It is nearby and easy
to reach. Not that we're afraid
you'll know the identity of
George Powell, Jerry Coleman or
any of our other porno reviewers
(which has nothing to do with the
fact that we've never printed a
picture of them), but should you
recognize one, we'll disavow any
knowledge of their perverse
actions.
