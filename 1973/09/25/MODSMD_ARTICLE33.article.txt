Death Penalty Signed
LOS ANGELES - The death
penalty will be mandatory in
California for 11 categories of murder
beginning Jan. 1, 1974, under a law
signed yesterday by Gov. Ronald
Reagan.
Some legal experts, including state
Atty. Gen. Evelle Younger, say four
other categories already carry an
automatic death sentence under
guidelines prescribed by the U.S.
Supreme Court.
However, California has had no
death penalty law as such since the
state Supreme Court declared it
unconstitutional on Feb. 18, 1972,
saying the penalty was "cruel or
unusual punishment."
In signing the bill, Reagan noted it
was a direct result of the 67 percent
support given by the state's voters to a
death penalty initiative on last
November's ballot.
"I'm sure we all regret the necessity,
of having to sign such a bill," the
Republican chief executive told
reporters at the bill-signing
ceremonies.
"But I do have the feeling of
satisfaction that comes from doing
something that you know is right.
There is no way of knowing how many
lives of innocent, law-abiding citizens
this legislation will save."
Reagan and other supporters of the
new law say they believe the death
penalty is a deterrent to crime.
The new law may face a court
battle before it is used and will
automatically come up for review by
the state Supreme Court the first time
it is.

The American Civil Liberties Union
has charged that the measure is
"legally defective and
unconstitutional." Other opponents
argue that the law's mandatory
provisions will result in hundreds of
executions every year.
Kissinger Debuts In UN
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. - Secretary
of State Henry A. Kissinger assured
the nations of the world yesterday
that the United States will not seek to
dominate their affairs in concert with
the Soviet Union, or with any other
big power.
"My country remains committed to
the goal of a world community,"
Kissinger promised the United Nations
General Assembly in his debut as
secretary. "We will continue to work
in this parliament of man to make it a
reality."
In order to make the United
Nations more effective, Kissinger
proposed that the 135 member nations
reach agreement on peacekeeping
guidelines for swift and effective
action in future crises.
"In recent years we found ourselves
locked in fruitless debates about the
inauguration of peacekeeping
operations and over the degree of
control the Security Council would
exercise over peacekeeping machinery,
an impasse which ensured only that
permanent peacekeeping machinery
would never come into being," he said.
Troops Near Linkup
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Two
government units moved through light
opposition to within bV* miles of a

linkup yesterday in a sweep designed
to secure Phnom Penh's vulnerable
western approaches.
Field reports confirmed by the
Cambodian command said the troops
were trying to join up at Thmat Pong,
about 18 miles west of the capital.
Elements of the government's 7th
Division were moving from the north
and the 13th Brigade was moving from
the south near Highway 4, the reports
said.
At least five battalions of
government soldiers were reported
involved in the operation to take
Himat Pong, which is said to be a
division headquarters for
Communist-led Cambodian insurgents
and their North Vietnamese allies. A
Cambodian batallion usually contains
between 300 and 500 soldiers.
Col. Am Rong, the command's
chief spokesman, said resistance was
light, indicating at least some insurgent
elements had perhaps left the area in
advance of the government sweep.
If successful, the linkup could
prove helpful in beefing up the
capital's defenses. The western
approach forms a natural attack route,
free of the watery barriers that
encircle Phnom Penh on the east,
north and south.
Chile Burns Books
SANTIAGO, Chile — Chilean military
authorities have launched a book
burning campaign against Marxist
literature, raiding private homes and
ordering merchants to get rid of leftist
materials.
Col. Pedro Ewing, secretary-general
of government for the military junta
that seized power Sept. 11, said in an
interview published yesterday that
book stores "must eliminate Marxist
texts if they don't want to be
sanctioned."
On Sunday, security forces raided
numerous apartments at gunpoint in
central Santiago and threw Marxist
books, pamphlets and posters to the
street, where they were burned in
bonfires.
The government also banned
Marxist newspapers that supported the
government of President Salvador

Allende, who died in the bloody Sept.
11 coup.
Ewing told the right-wing
newspaper Tribuna: "We don't like
Marxism. We want Chilean
expressions. Marxism only stirs up
class hate ..."
But the press secretary for the
junta, Federico Willoughby, indicated
that the new government does not
have a full-fledged policy to eliminate
Marxist books.
Willoughby told a newsman: "The
junta respects ideas. It doesn't believe
burning books will stop ideas."
On Sunday's book burnings, he
said: "Soldiers, police and students do
not always react in a manner
coinciding with government policy. It
was something of the moment."
Oregon Cuts Electricity
GLENEDEN BEACH, Ore. - Use
of electricity for display and
advertising purposes has been banned
in Oregon effective at dusk yesterday.
The executive order to that effect
was signed Sunday by Gov. Tom
McCall of Oregon at the Western
States Governors Conference at
Salishan Lodge on the north Oregon
Coast.
McCall said voluntary cutbacks in
electricity usage have not produced
sufficient savings.
He said further cuts will be ordered
including elimination of electricity for
some uses if the lighting ban does not
produce a sufficient reduction. He did
not specify what the further cutbacks
would be. Lighting for security and for
night sports events will not be
effected, he said.
"Without conservation efforts of
this magnitude, we may be 30 percent
short of meeting firm committment
load requirements by March of next
year," McCall warned.
Water behind hydroelectric dams in
the Columbia River system is at a
record low because of last year's light
snow pack and a dry summer.
The energy crisis is the theme of
this year's conference, which runs
through tomorrow.
McCall said the ban could extend to
outdoor Christmas lighting if the

situation is not improved by
December.
In August, McCall asked Oregonians
to reduce electrical consumption by 7
percent voluntarily.
"Despite notable efforts, not
everyone got the message," he said.
"We must now save energy at a rate of
7Va percent and fully expect that we
will have to raise our sights even more
next month to 10 percent."
Prices Show No Increase
PHILADELPHIA — It's two weeks
since the beef ceiling was lifted and
supermarket shoppers yesterday found
that prices and supplies were back to
normal. No one wanted to predict
what would happen next, however.
An Associated Press survey showed
•nost beef prices were at or below their
freeze level. Increases and decreases on
individual items generally balanced
each other out.
Retailers reported there was no
rush by shoppers to buy beef, which
had been in short supply during the
freeze. Some experts said people had
changed their eating habits and just
got used to other foods.
Cattle prices at livestock markets
declined from a high of about 60 cents
per pound to 45 cents a pound or less
and the drop was reflected at the meat
counter.
"The flow of the product is back to
normal," said Bernie Cross, president
of Cross Brothers Meat Packers Inc. of
Philadelphia. "There is plenty of beef
on the market, more than needed . . ."
"The wholesale market, price wise,
is off 15 percent. Supply has exceeded
demand . . . Retailers are buying only
what they need because they're afraid
what they buy today will cost less
tomorrow."
Skylab Crew Returns
SPACE CENTER, Houston - Clean
up, pack up and power down chores

occupied the Skylab 2 astronauts
Monday as the record-breaking
spacemen prepared for their Tuesday
splashdown and the end of their
59Vi-day voyage.
"Watch us today — we'll get this
thing all put to bed," said Skylab 2
commander Alan L. Bean as the
astronauts worked to close down the
space station. "We're coming home
tomorrow."
Bean and his crewmates, Jack R.
Lousma and Owen K. Garriott, spent
Monday tidying up the orbiting
laboratory and preparing it for the
Skylab 3 crew, which is scheduled to
spend 56 days aboard the space station
starting Nov. 11.
The Skylab 2 splashdown target is
230 miles southwest of San Diego, in
the Pacific Ocean. Officials said the
target may be moved to the northwest
a number of miles if Hurricane Irah,
which is 500-600 miles south of the
splashdown point, becomes a hazard.
Bean spotted the storm off the
coast of western Mexico on Monday
and told Mission Control it was "a
beautiful hurricane."
Bean, Garriott and Lousma will
board their Apollo command ship
Tuesday morning. They will conduct a
"hot fire" test of some steering
rockets and undock the command
module from Skylab at 12:50 p.m.
PDT.
After moving away from the
orbiting laboratory, the astronauts will
fire the powerful service propulsion
rocket on the Apollo craft. This will
slow their speed, cause them to fall
from orbit and streak into the
atmosphere toward the ocean.
Splashdown will come at 3:20 p.m.
PDT.

There will be an important )
returning Daily staff luncheon !
today at noon. Photographs for j(
press cards will be taken. ;!
