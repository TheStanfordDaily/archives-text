# Escondido Management Reorganized, Alan Cummings Named New Director
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
University officials yesterday
announced a mfyor reorganization in
the administration of Escondido
Village, with Residences and
Fraternities Manager Alan Cummings
replacing Frank E. Gallagher Jr. as
village director.
Cummings retains his previous post
and has been given the title of manager
of student residences, said Housing
Manager Edward Scoles. Gallagher,
village director since 1960, has been
transferred to the position of assistant
director of housing.
Under the new set-up, Escondido is
one of several divisions under
Cummings. The village was formerly a
separate operation under Gallagher,
who reported directly to Scoles.
Scoles, who initiated the
reorganization, declined to comment

on what prompted the change.
However, reports over the summer
predicting action said tensions
between Gallagher and many residents
at least partially influenced the
change.
(The Daily reported on July 10 that
Gallagher might be leaving his post. A
source said at the time that Gallagher
was being forced out because of his
difficulties with the residents.)
Target
Gallagher had recently been an
increasing target of tenant displeasure
for his alleged intransigence in dealings
with them. Some also blamed him for
the steadily-increasing rents in the
village.
In his new post specializing in
financial and facilities planning,
Gallagher will examine future rent
rates. Scoles said yesterday, though,
that he will have "no more [impact on
setting rates] than any other
individual .. . there's an awful lot of
checks and balances involved in setting
rates."
Scoles specifically defended
Gallagher's role in the current round
of Escondido rent increases. He said
the boosts were caused by the heavy
"debt burden" on Escondido IV and
stressed that it was not Gallagher's
decision to construct the building.
University Policy
The construction, he said, was in
line with a University policy of
expanding housing to meet student
needs, while recognizing that increased
construction would mean higher rents
for tenants.
Gallagher's appointment will take
effect when he returns from vacation
next week, Scoles said.
Cummings said yesterday that there
would be "no immediate changes" in
the day-to-day operation of the village,
describing himself as "an observer" for
the time being. "For now, I want to
proceed cautiously," he said.
Committed
Although Scoles said he did not
consult with Escondido residents
before making the shift, Cummings
said, "I really am committed to
working with the residents' association
and with the residents themselves."
Suzi Tilson, president of the
Escondido Village Council, said the

reorganization was "very welcome."
"I think it's very safe to say that
the village outgrew the [previous]
structure ... we had only one central
person to refer to for all our needs."

committee working for a reduction in
the rent increases announced last year,

said that "the residents had hoped that
the administration would talk to us"
before naming a new director.
However, she added, "we certainly
have nothing against A 1 Cummings."
Rent Cutback
The University had previously
announced a seven percent rate hike
this year, but after negotiations with
the committee residents that figure

was cut back to five percent.
"We're still not very happy," said
Faught. "We get the feeling that the
University arbitrarily picked out a
figure of five percent and tried to cite
everything they could to justify it."
She said residents would discuss the
rent problem at Wednesday night's
Village Council meeting, and would
decide whether to continue plans for a
rent slowdown.
