# BSU Chiefs Emphasize Involvement

### GLENN KRAMON 
New Black Students Union (BSU)
Chairman Derek Toliver has called for
"increased black participation in
existing University organizations in an
effort to expose the black experience"
during the coming year.
Speaking with Vice Chairman Tony
Brisco in an interview with the Daily,
Toliver said he would "encourage
black students to run for the ASSU
Senate" and would urge increased
participation in University committees
and ASSU organizations such as the
Speaker's Bureau and Special Events
Board.
"We want more input as to what we
feel will be beneficial for black
students, rather than what others feel
will be beneficial for us," commented
Brisco.
Toliver, a junior in economics, and
Brisco, a sophomore in general studies,
were elected last May by the
650-member organization, which
includes all black students here.
Meetings 'Productive'
The BSU leaders discussed several
areas in which they have been dealing
with the University. Brisco called
meetings with Dean of the Chapel
Robert G.H. Kelly "pretty
productive" in terms of establishing a
black religious activities time slot on
Sunday mornings.
Toliver expressed concern over "the
phasing out of the office of former
assistant to President Lyman, James
Simmons," who has acted as a liaison
between black students and the
president. "We think the University
feels there's a limit in dealing with
black affairs," Toliver said, noting that
he will exert pressure to maintain the
office.
Toliver and Brisco both indicated
they would continue to lobby for
"increasing admission not only for
black students, but particularly for
black Californians."
Acknowledging the need for "more
black professorships with tenure,"
Toliver said that he and Brisco are
"finding out how professors are
recruited" in an attempt to become
directly involved in the effort.
More Coaches
Toliver also called for an increase in
the number of black coaches on
Stanford athletic teams.
Both leaders emphasized unity
within their organization. Recognizing
that Roble Hall is the center for BSU
activities, Toliver suggested
"mobilizing BSU activities by utilizing
different arenas such as Tresidder" to
attract blacks in other dorms. The
move also comes as part of their plan
to "open Stanford's facilities to the

black community."
Brisco added that he plans
increased use of the Black House
behind Tresidder so that "people
coming in from off campus may
communicate with the BSU."
'Umbrella'
On a community level, the pair said
they hope to enhance the BSU's image
as an "umbrella organization for the
total community" by continuing a
black student volunteer service in
Ravenswood and other neighboring
school districts.
Toliver also discussed a conference
next spring on racism and oppression
featuring outside speakers and cultural
activities and a fund-raising drive to
aid famine-stricken countries in Africa.
A longer-range goal, he said, would
entail "creating channels of
communication with other California
BSU's" for a more powerful voice in
national affairs.
