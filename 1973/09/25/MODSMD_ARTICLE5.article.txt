New Black Students Union (BSU)
Chairman Derek Toliver has called for
"increased black participation in
existing University organizations in an
effort to expose the black experience"
during the coming year.
Speaking with Vice Chairman Tony
Brisco in an interview with the Daily,
Toliver said he would "encourage
black students to run for the ASSU
Senate" and would urge increased
participation in University committees
and ASSU organizations such as the
Speaker's Bureau and Special Events
Board.
"We want more input as to what we
feel will be beneficial for black
students, rather than what others feel
will be beneficial for us," commented
Brisco.
Toliver, a junior in economics, and
Brisco, a sophomore in general studies,
were elected last May by the
650-member organization, which
includes all black students here.
Meetings 'Productive'
The BSU leaders discussed several
areas in which they have been dealing
with the University. Brisco called
meetings with Dean of the Chapel
Robert G.H. Kelly "pretty
productive" in terms of establishing a
black religious activities time slot on
Sunday mornings.
Toliver expressed concern over "the
phasing out of the office of former
assistant to President Lyman, James
Simmons," who has acted as a liaison
between black students and the
president. "We think the University
feels there's a limit in dealing with
black affairs," Toliver said, noting that
he will exert pressure to maintain the
office.
