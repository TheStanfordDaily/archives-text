# Lyman Names Keogh To Chair New CJP
## 
### 
Associate Dean William T. Keogh of the Law School has been named
chairman of the Campus Judicial Panel (CJP) for the coming academic year by
University President Richard W. Lyman.
Keogh succeeds Law Prof. William Cohen as chairman of the panel, which
makes disciplinary recommendations to the president on student honor code
violations.
A 1952 law graduate here, Keogh was named an associate dean of the school
in 1961. He resigned to practice privately in Palo Alto in 1967, returning to the
University two years later.
Bom in 1916 in New York City, Keogh received a bachelor's degree in
chemical engineering from Kansas State University in 1942.
Army Vet
A 20-year Army veteran, he served as chief of international law at the Army's
European headquarters, and as a military judge for the Army's Ninth Judicial
Circuit.
The CJP, established by President Lyman in November 1971, includes three
other faculty members recommended by the Faculty Committee on Committees
and three students chosen by a random process.
Faculty serving this year will be Aerophysics Prof. Daniel Bershader, a
member last year; Religion Prof. Lee H. Yearley;and Operations Research Prof.
Patricia, Jacobs. The students will be selected this fall by a random process.
Approved
Proposals which would give students a voting majority in the CJP were
approved by a 14-1 vote of the Committee of 15 last spring, following an
extensive student-faculty-administration study.
The C-15 proposal calls for a judicial panel composed of four students, three
faculty, and a chairman from the Law School, who would vote only to break
ties. The change still requires the approval of the ASSU Senate, the Faculty
Senate, and President Lyman before taking effect. It will be placed on a Oct
10-11 student referendum.
Some student leaders, including current ASSU President Kevin O'Grady, have
opposed the proposal because a two-thirds vote of either senate or the president
alone could terminate the potential student majority "upon determining that the
[judicial council] is impaired by the composition of that body."
Under the present system, complaints are filed with the CJP by the
administration, which will be represented by Gerald M. Halligan and Carole Price
of the president's office.
Law students will often represent the students who are charged. Disputed
facts are resolved in a hearing conducted by an outside hearing officer, who
submits findings to the CJP.
