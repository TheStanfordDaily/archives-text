# Executive Privilege
## Precedence Exists For Sirica Decision 
### 
James Lobsenz

The historic "Tapes" decision,
rendered by Chief Judge John J.
Sirica, has been erroneously
labeled as the first case of its kind,
a pioneer in a legal desert barren
of precedent.
Yet a substantial body of case
law exists concerning the
executive privilege of
confidentiality, and it stands
solidly behind the thrust of
Sirica's decision.
In 1953, the U.S. Supreme
Court, in U.S. v. Reynolds (345
US 1), discussed for the first time
the doctrine of executive
privilege. Suit was brought in a
federal district court by the
widows of crew members who
died in the crash of a B-29 aircraft
engaged in the testing of
top-secret electronic equipment.
A motion for production of the
Air Force's accident report and
for the statements of surviving
crew members was filed by the
plaintiffs.
The Government claimed
executive privilege and refused to
obey a court order to produce the
documents for an in camera
inspection (a private inspection by
the judge alone in his chambers)
to ascertain what documents were
privileged. The district court then
entered judgment for the
plaintiffs by default and their
decision was affirmed by a U.S.
Court of Appeals.
The U.S. Supreme Court
reversed this decision and held
that: 1) an executive privilege
existed, but was not absolute; 2)
that the determination of the
scope of the privilege was one to
be made solely by the courts; and
3) that in camera inspection was a
proper procedure in some
situations, but that it was not
proper in the case at bar.
Rules
The crux of the matter, then,
lies in the rules that the Court
formed for determining when in
camera inspection is proper.
It was ruled that in cases where
a court could be reasonably
satisfied that the evidence in
question contained military and
diplomatic secrets that "the court
should not jeopardize the security
which the privilege is meant to
protect by insisting upon an
examination, even by the judge
alone, in chambers."
However, in all other cases of
claims of executive privilege, the
courts were instructed that their
vigor in probing the confidences
of the executive office should be
guided by the strength of the
moving party's necessity for
obtaining the evidence desired.
Where the necessity demonstrated
was little, the courts were told to
favor the executive claim, but
where necessity was great, the
executive claim should be
examined critically and in detail.
In Reynolds the Supreme
Court believed that the accident
report would contain military
secrets, and was thus privileged
even from an in camera
inspection. The Court also found
that since the Air Force had
offered to make the surviving
crew members available to the
plaintiffs' attorneys for
questioning, that the necessity of
obtaining their official statements
was not severe, since an
alternative method existed for
gaining the information sought.
It is clear to Sirica (and to this
reporter) that in the "Tapes" case
the need for the evidence sought
is extreme. Those tapes can
almost certainly aid the grand jury
in determining who is telling the
truth; John Dean or President
Nixon. No feasible alternative
means exists for making this
determination, and no claim is
made that the tapes include
recordings of military or
diplomatic secrets. Thus the
decision to order an in camera
inspection is a proper one.
Dictum
The U.S. Court of Appeals is
presently hearing Nixon's (and
Cox's) appeal from Sirica's
decision. That they will uphold
the decision is almost virtually
certain. But the position of the

U.S. Supreme Court is less clear.
The Reynolds' rule concerning
claims of executive privilege in
matters not involving military
secrets is not a binding precedent.
It is what is called dictum:
language used by the court in
discussing an issue or situation
that is not present in the case
which the court is deciding.
Therefore the question arises,
"Could the Supreme Court ignore
the guiding dictum of Reynolds?"
the answer is, "Yes, they could,"
but it is highly unlikely.
As recently as 1966 the U.S.
District Court for the District of
Columbia applied the dictum of
Reynolds, and ruled in point that:
In camera inspection in
executive privilege cases is
appropriate where it appears with
reasonable clarity that the party
seeking production is entitled to
access. (Carl Zeiss Stiftung u.
V.E.B. Carl Zeiss, 40 F.R.D. 318).
But of crucial significance is
the fact that this decision was
affirmed by the U.S. Court of
Appeals and that certiorari was
denied by the U.S. Supreme Court
(128 U.S.App.D.C. 10 and 389
U.S. 952). (A denial of certiorari
by the Supreme Court has the
effect of extending the Court's
blessing upon the ruling of the
lower court without having to
actually hear the case.) The actions

of the District Court and the
Appeal Court are binding
precendents. The action of the
Supreme Court is not dictum, nor
is it binding precedents, but
nevertheless should a largely
Nixon-appointed Supreme Court
desire to rule in the President's
favor when the "Tapes" case
reaches their chambers, Zeiss will
present a formidable legal obstacle
that this reporter believes cannot
be overcome without tremendous
effort.
Lazy Court
Earlier in this article it was
maintained it was virtually certain
that the U.S. Appeals Court
would uphold Sirica's decision.
This assertion draws its strength
from the fact that in addition to
affirming the Zeiss decision seven
years ago, this very same U.S.
Appeals Court has upheld the
principle of in camera inspections
in executive privilege cases in
three other decisions rendered in
1960, 1968 and 1971.
Freeman v. Seligson, (132
U.S.App.D.C. 56) was decided by
a seemingly unindustrious Judge
Robinson whq ordered a plaintiff
seeking documents in the
possession of the U.S. Dept. cf
Agriculture to file a brief
supporting his claim that the
evidence sought was relevant and
vital to the plaintiffs case.

Robinson, in thus applying the
Reynolds' "necessity rule" stated
that while the courts "have
adopted the in camera inspection
as the procedure for accomdating
claims of privilege where no
military or diplomatic secrets are
involved." He hoped that the
parties could "avoid a showdown
on privilege," so that the Court
could forego the "laborious
page-by-page examination" which
an in camera inspection would
require.
'Fraud and Corruption'
In Boeing Airplane v.
Coggeshall, (280 F. 2d 654) the
same court upheld a district court
order compelling the
Renegotiation Board of the I.R.S.
to hand over documents
concerning their policy on
collecting excess profit taxes in
order that they might be expected
by the court to determine
whether or not they were
privileged.
And in 1971 in Committe for
Nuclear Responsibility v. Seaborg,
(463 F 2d 788), Chief Judge
Bazelon, the same judge presently
presiding over the Cox v. Nixon
appeal, sustained a district court
order that required the Atomic
Energy Commission to submit to
a similar in camera inspection
procedure in a case involving
alleged violations of the National

Environmental Policy Act.
The significance of this
decision lies in the following
language which embodies not legal
precedent, but was guided
"principally by the root
conception of the rule of law in
our democratic society. An
essential ingredient to our rule of
law is the authority of the courts
to determine whether an
executive official has complied
with the Constitution."
