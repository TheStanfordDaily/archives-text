KEPLER'S KWIK KOURSE:
The History of Western Civilization
In the beginning there was no Western Civilization...
Throughout Europe, Britain and the Americas, simple peoples lived in relative harmony.
Some, like the Eskimos, didn't even have a word (or the concept) "war.." Indeed, life was on
a primitive, uncivilized level.
Then a flourishing Civilization emerged in Greece. Within a few hundred years the Greeks
destroyed and emasculated their society through unending internecine warefare.
Next, the short swords were taken up by the simple, sturdy Romans, who in a few hundred
years conquered the world and brought Civilization through a never ending series of wars.
This culminated in the Dark Ages.
In the age of chivalry a new feudal society carrying the Christian banner brought
Civilization through warfare to Europe. Christ's soldiers bludgeoned their way to the Holy
Land, and Allah's warriors slashed into southern France and to Constantinople.
Civilization flourished.
Came the Renaissance, Machiavelli and the Borgias. Poison, knife, bribery and war
carried Civilization to new heights. The Christians, having defeated the Moslems, now
carried on great wars among themselves as Portestant and Catholic smote and burned one
another The Jews were confined, between pogroms, in Ghettoes.
Religion and Western Civilization grew ever greater.
In the 16th and 17th Centuries the Nation States and Absolute Monarchs carved new
places in the sun. Men died, women wept, children starved and Civilization flourished
The French Revolution for Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite "liberated" thousands from their
lives in France and Europe. It brought "equality" through the Levee en masse: all were
equally conscripted. The "fraternity" was that of arms as wars were fought from 1790 until
1815.
Out of Liberte emerged the dictator Napoleon. Civilization flourished In 1815 Napoleon
fell The Congress of Vienna settled matters so well that in the years following, Civilization
flourished as wars and incipient revolutions broke out all over Europe.
Britain enlarged and consolidated its empire, its fleet, operating by bomb and sword,
bringing Civilization to the "Lesser Breeds."
The United States, victorious in its war against Britain, brought Civilization to the
American Indians throughout the 19th Century — by massacre, alcohol, lies, concentration
camps, making and breaking treaties, war and other civilized methods. This effort was so
successful that by 1900 there was hardly an uncivilized Indian left. In fact, there was hardly
an Indian left.
All this brought us to the 20th Century, World Wars I and 11, the Russian Revolution,
Hitler's Europe, the Cold War, the H bomb, the ICBM, the war in Vietnam, Watergate and
the bloody coup in Chile.
Civilization flourishes.

destroyed and emasculated their society through unending internecine warefare.
Next, the short swords were taken up by the simple, sturdy Romans, who in a few hundred
years conquered the world and brought Civilization through a never ending series of wars.
This culminated in the Dark Ages.
In the age of chivalry a new feudal society carrying the Christian banner brought
Civilization through warfare to Europe. Christ's soldiers bludgeoned their way to the Holy
Land, and Allah's warriors slashed into southern France and to Constantinople.
Civilization flourished.
Came the Renaissance, Machiavelli and the Borgias. Poison, knife, bribery and war
carried Civilization to new heights. The Christians, having defeated the Moslems, now
carried on great wars among themselves as Portestant and Catholic smote and burned one
another The Jews were confined, between pogroms, in Ghettoes.
Religion and Western Civilization grew ever greater.
In the 16th and 17th Centuries the Nation States and Absolute Monarchs carved new
places in the sun. Men died, women wept, children starved and Civilization flourished
The French Revolution for Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite "liberated" thousands from their
lives in France and Europe. It brought "equality" through the Levee en masse: all were
equally conscripted. The "fraternity" was that of arms as wars were fought from 1790 until
1815.
Out of Liberte emerged the dictator Napoleon. Civilization flourished In 1815 Napoleon
fell The Congress of Vienna settled matters so well that in the years following, Civilization
flourished as wars and incipient revolutions broke out all over Europe.
Britain enlarged and consolidated its empire, its fleet, operating by bomb and sword,
bringing Civilization to the "Lesser Breeds."
The United States, victorious in its war against Britain, brought Civilization to the
American Indians throughout the 19th Century — by massacre, alcohol, lies, concentration
camps, making and breaking treaties, war and other civilized methods. This effort was so
successful that by 1900 there was hardly an uncivilized Indian left. In fact, there was hardly
an Indian left.
All this brought us to the 20th Century, World Wars I and 11, the Russian Revolution,
Hitler's Europe, the Cold War, the H bomb, the ICBM, the war in Vietnam, Watergate and
the bloody coup in Chile.
Civilization flourishes.

KEPLER'S KWIK KOURSE:
The History of Western Civilization
In the beginning there was no Western Civilization...
Throughout Europe, Britain and the Americas, simple peoples lived in relative harmony.
Some, like the Eskimos, didn't even have a word (or the concept) "war.." Indeed, life was on
a primitive, uncivilized level.
Then a flourishing Civilization emerged in Greece. Within a few hundred years the Greeks
destroyed and emasculated their society through unending internecine warefare.
Next, the short swords were taken up by the simple, sturdy Romans, who in a few hundred
years conquered the world and brought Civilization through a never ending series of wars.
