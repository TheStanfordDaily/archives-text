The All-Arounder
Right for the road and ready for the rough - that's an apt description of
the HondaCL-350 K5. It's truly an all-around machine, with a popular
sized 325 cc four-stroke engine that moves you with authority. Oil-damped
telescopic front forks shrug off bumps, and a newly designed seat is narrow
er for greater comfort A constant-mesh transmission smoothly delivers all
five speeds to the road. New features abound: Instrumentation is backlit
for easier reading. The speedometer and tachometer are inclined for quick
er viewing. For safety, turn signal width is increased. And there's a larger
rear view mirror. Plus an easier-to-use ignition cut-off switch. And constant
velocity twin carburetion helps maintain top performance.
