American
Brass \|p'
Quintet <j|L
The brass quintet has undergone a phenomenal
revival since the beginning of the twentieth cen
tury. After World War II many composers began
contributing to the brass repertoire because of the
unusually wide dynamic range of the brass, its
variety of tonal colors, and the ability clearly to
delineate simultaneous musical lines while still
maintaining homogeneity of sound. Virtuosi
Raymond Mase, Louis Ranger, Herb Rankin,
Robert Biddlecome, and Edward Birdwell have
united years of individual talent and a devotion to
the ideal of chamber music for brass to form the
American Brass Quintet. . .it is quite impossible
to overpraise the playing of the Brass Quintet. . .
they have everything. . .brilliance of attack, perfect
ensemble and intonation, and a tone quality of
unrivaled purity, range and power," Daily Tele

"Among their peers there is no competition. The
line to the great string ensembles is direct," stated
the Chicago Tribune reviewer when the Cleveland
Quartet made its debut in Chicago. The musicians
and patrons of music who attended the Quartet's
sensationally brilliant debut at the Marlboro Music
Festival in the summer of 1969 are still talking
about the Quartet's perfect ensemble, dazzling
technique and profound music-making. There is no
doubt that this group will become one of the most
important chamber music ensembles America has
ever produced.

the heritage of the American Black his legacy of
music and dance, his moods of sorrow, joy and
hope through the medium of ecstatic, dramatic
and vital dance. Alvin Alley choreographs to com

dancers and they all respond completely. The

American
Brass \|p'
Quintet <j|L
The brass quintet has undergone a phenomenal
revival since the beginning of the twentieth cen
tury. After World War II many composers began
contributing to the brass repertoire because of the
unusually wide dynamic range of the brass, its
variety of tonal colors, and the ability clearly to
delineate simultaneous musical lines while still
maintaining homogeneity of sound. Virtuosi
Raymond Mase, Louis Ranger, Herb Rankin,
Robert Biddlecome, and Edward Birdwell have
united years of individual talent and a devotion to
the ideal of chamber music for brass to form the
American Brass Quintet. . .it is quite impossible
to overpraise the playing of the Brass Quintet. . .
they have everything. . .brilliance of attack, perfect
ensemble and intonation, and a tone quality of
unrivaled purity, range and power," Daily Tele

Cleveland Quartet
"Among their peers there is no competition. The
line to the great string ensembles is direct," stated
the Chicago Tribune reviewer when the Cleveland
Quartet made its debut in Chicago. The musicians
and patrons of music who attended the Quartet's
sensationally brilliant debut at the Marlboro Music
Festival in the summer of 1969 are still talking
about the Quartet's perfect ensemble, dazzling
technique and profound music-making. There is no
doubt that this group will become one of the most
important chamber music ensembles America has
ever produced.
