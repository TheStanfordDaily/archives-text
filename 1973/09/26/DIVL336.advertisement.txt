JAZZ
That unmistakable, original New Orleans jazz will
be back with the indomitable Preservation Hall
Jazz Band, their 58th performance at Stanford. An
evening with Billie and DeDe Pierce, Willie
Humphrey, "Cie" Frazier, "Big Jim" Robinson,
and Allan Jaffe promises to be one of uninhibited
head-bobbing, toe-tapping, hand-clapping, and
thigh-slapping.

Narciso Yepes
Narciso Yepes, inventor of the ten-string guitar,
was born in Southern Spain in 1927. He began to
play the guitar at the age of five. Through his
patient and sensitive study of his instrument he has
developed a revolutionary technique and dis
covered hitherto unsuspected resources and possi
bilities. Sublime musicianship, true mastery, sensi
tivity and intelligence are all words used to de
scribe his playing.

Joy Blackett
Spring Opera Theater goers will recognize the name
of Joy Blackett, the young mezzo-soprano who
sang in Monteverdi's "Orfeo." A native of
Bermuda, Miss Blackett has studied at Oberlin Col
lege and the Juilliard School of Music with Hans
Heinz. A reviewer in the New York Times said. "In
timbre, if not in size. Miss Blackett's voice recalls
that of the young Marian Anderson. It has the
same metallic gleam at the top, the same duskiness
in the lower range. . .it is a beautiful instrument."
