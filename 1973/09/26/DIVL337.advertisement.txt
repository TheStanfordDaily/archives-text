Paco De Lucia
flamenco guitarist
Phenomenal technique, fluency and passion are
hallmarks of de Lucia's playing. Critics only used
superlatives when describing this young Spanish
guitarist's first U.S. appearance at Carnegie Hall
last November. Antonio Gades of L'Aurore (Paris)
wrote three years ago, "A star is born. A 21-year
old guitarist with the face of an angel improvises
melodies of the gods with the technique of a
demon."
