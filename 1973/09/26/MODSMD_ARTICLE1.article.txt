# Agnew Requests House To Investigate Charges
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Vice
President Spiro T. Agnew asked the
House of Representatives yesterday to
investigate accusations that he was
involved in political corruption.
Agnew denied wrongdoing in a
man-to-man meeting with President
Nixon, then took his case to Congress.
The vice president acted after Atty.
Gen. Elliot L. Richardson announced
he had authorized federal prosecutors
to take their evidence against Agnew
before a grand jury in Baltimore
tomorrow.
Letter To Albert
Agnew made his request of the
House in a letter to Speaker Carl
Albert. Agnew personally took his
letter to Capitol Hill, where he met for
more than an hour with Albert and
other House leaders.
In the letter, the vice president said
his lawyers had advised him the

Constitution bars criminal proceedings
against a vice president while he holds
office.
He said he therefore could not
acquiesce in any criminal proceedings,
or look to them for vindication.
Asks House Probe
"In these circumstances, I believe, it
is the right and duty of the vice
president to turn to the House," he
said.
Agnew's letter did not mention
impeachment proceedings as a forum
for the full inquiry he requested. Nor,
said Albert, did Agnew mention that
possibility during the meeting.
The request caught congressional
leaders by surprise, and there was no
immediate word as to what the House
might do about it.
Albert, asked whether impeachment
had been ruled out, replied simply:
"Nothing has been ruled out."

A spokesman for Richardson said
the attorney general stood by his
decision to have the evidence against
Agnew presented to the grand jury.
Nixon Assured
Nixon said Agnew had personally
assured him of his innocence. He said
the vice president, like any citizen, is
entitled to the presumption of
innocence. And he praised Agnew's
performance as his vice president.
Agnew was informed by federal
prosecutors last month that he was
under investigation for possible
criminal violations of tax, bribery,
extortion and conspiracy laws.
Agnew left the Capitol declining
comment. "The letter speaks for
itself," he said. But he added he might
have something further to say in a few
days.
Motives Questioned
He left behind an instant debate on
his request, his motives, and the
possible courses of action open to the
House.
Agnew's letter was read to the
House, after Albert and the other
leaders trooped back to the chamber
from their meeting with the vice
president.
While Agnew cited legal arguments
against criminal proceedings against
him, his request for a House inquiry
also appeared aimed at getting the
whole matter into a forum less
restricted than the secrecy of a grand
jury.
Any House panel investigating the
case would have a Republican
minority, and members who might
offer a defense and, in effect,
cross-examine Agnew's accusers.
Precedent
In his letter, Agnew discussed the
precedent of a House investigation of
Vice President John C. Calhoun nearly
150 years ago. Calhoun, accused of
war profiteering, was investigated by a
House committee and cleared.
Later, in a different dispute,
Calhoun resigned.
Among the possible forums, should
the House decide on an inquiry, would
be the judiciary committee or a
committee created specifically to
handle the Agnew case.
