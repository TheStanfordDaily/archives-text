LIONS IN THE STREET: THE
INSIDE STOR Y OF THE GREA T
WALL STREET LAW FIRMS, By
Paul Hoffman (New York:
Saturday Review Press, 1973),
244 pages, $7.95.
THE SUPER LA WYERS: THE
SMALL AND POWERFUL
WORLD OF THE GREAT
WASHINGTON LAW FIRMS, By
Joseph C. Goulden (New York:
Dell Publishing Company, 1973),
414 pages, $1.75.
In his seminal work, Hie Power
Elite, the brillant American
sociologist C. Wright Mills found
that important corporate lawyers
were at the command posts of
American society:
"The inner core of the power
elite also includes men of the
higher legal and financial type
from the great law factories and
investment firms, who are almost
professional go-betweens of

economic, political, and military
affairs, and who thus act to unify
the power elite. The corporation
lawyer and investment banker
perform the functions of the
'go-between' effectively and
powerfully. By the nature of their
work, they transcend the narrow
milieu of any one industry, and
accordingly are in a position to
speak and act for the corporate
world or at least sizable sectors of
it.
"The corporation lawyer is a
key link between the economic
and military and political areas;
the investment banker is a key
organizer and unifier of the
corporate world and a person well
versed in spending the huge
amounts of money the American
military establishment now
ponders. When you get a lawyer
who handles the legal work of
investment bankers you get a key
member of the power elite."
Although there is some
empirical data gathered by Gabriel
Kolko which backs up Mills'
insights on the corporate lawyers,
we have lacked until this time any
useful, lengthy studies of these
lawyers and their firms.
While Hoffman's and Goulden's
books are not accompanied by
footnotes and scholarly apparatus
(which would be somewhat
ridiculous since the papers of law
firms remain closed to
researchers), they are excellent
examples of investigative
reporting. People interested in the
make-up of America's ruling elite
will definitely want to read these
books.
Essential Background
These books provide essential
background on many of the major
decision-makers of modern
American history. All the men
discussed are of course lawyers,
but other roles include foreign
policy maker (the Dulles
brothers, John J. McCloy, Dean
Acheson, Henry L. Stimson),
Presidential candidate (Nixon,
Thomas Dewey), and Presidential
adviser (Clark Clifford, John
Mitchell).
Also provided are details on
what individuals and firms
regularly work for which
manufacturing, banking, and
other business interests and on
what precise legal matters.
Simpson Thacher and Bartlett
handles Lehman Brothers.
Milbank Tweed is the special legal
force of the Rockefellers and their
Chase Manhattan Bank. White &
Case represents Bankers Trust and
U.S. Steel, both of which were
creations of the House of Morgan.
Shearman & Sterling's largest
client is the First National City
Bank.
In Washington, D.C.,
Covington and Burling have a long
association with the du Pont
interests. Clark Clifford has not
only been an intimate adviser of
leading Democrats from Truman
through Johnson, but also is at
times the lawyer for Standard Oil
of California, Hughes Tool, ABC,
Continental Airlines, TWA, El
Paso Natural Gas, du Pont, Time
magazine, General Electric,
Phillips Petroleum, and others.
The Wall Street law firms
described by Hoffman have a
longer history and ar? to this day
more important than the
Washington firms. The Wall Street
firms when viewed in their

business and government context
constitute a complex network of
school, family, friendship, and
commercial ties. Many firms trace
their ancestor partnerships back a
hundred years.
Growth
There have been spurts of
growth that coincide with growth
in industry, banking, or
government, especially the latter.
Today the Wall Street firms are
growing into hundreds of
partners, paralleling the growth of
new regulations and laws.
The Washington firms basically
date from the Progressive Era, a
time when businessmen decided
they needed a partner in the
nation's capital. Edward Burling
of Covington and Burling saw
back in those days that the other
side of government regulation of
business was the likely prospect of
regulation that would crush the
competition that was eating away
at the market shares of established
companies.
Goulden quotes Richard Olney
(later Cleveland's Attorney
General) on the uses of regulation
to stifle competition. Olney told
his client the Chicago, Burlingon
& Quincy Railroad in the earlier
days of national regulation of
railroads that "the part of wisdom
is not to destroy the [Interstate
Commerce 1 Commission, but to
utilize it." Apparently the
railroads have done just that, for
Goulden cites a study which
shows that rail and truck freight
rates would drop by as much as
twenty percent if surface
transport were freed from the
Commission's regulations.
Valuable Study
One of the most valuable case
studies in Goulden's book is his
five-page account of the creation
of the airline industry cartel in the
late 19305. All attempts to create
pools or cartels are inherently
unstable and will fall apart unless
the government serves to supervise
them in some fashion. The Civil
Aeronautics Board controls prices
and the nature of services, but
even more importantly it controls
entry into the business. No one
can engage in air transport unless
he proves to the CAB that he is
"fit, willing, and able" to perform
the proposed service, and that the
service is required in the "public
convenience and necessity." But
all the old, established airlines
that were already going in the
1930s do not have to prove any
such thing. Therefore, they have
all the business, and new
scheduled trunk operations are
not permitted. The architects of
this cartel were lawyers from
Covington and Burling.
Whether a corporate lawyer
like Thomas Corcoran is writing
New Deal regulatory legislation on
the securities industry or aiding
Chiang Kai-shek's China Lobby,
or Paul Porter of Arnold, Fortas
and Porter is heading the World
War II Office of Price
Administration or putting down a
guerrilla war in Greece, men like
these, skilled at wearing different
hats and taking on many roles, are
making the choices that govern
American life. Books like
Hoffman's and Goulden's provide
valuable information on who rules
America.
