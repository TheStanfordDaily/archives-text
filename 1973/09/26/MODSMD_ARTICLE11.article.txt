# Student Poll
## Religious Survey 
### 
Striking trends in students'
religious views were evident from
the tabulation of the 1972-73
"Stanford Religious Survey." The
survey, conducted by students
working in conjunction with
Campus Crusade for Christ, will
resume its fourth year of progress
at Stanford. It is designed to
sample students' religious
backgrounds and beliefs in order
to map out the yearly variations.
Last year's questionnaire dealt
with one's religious affiliation,
personal philosophy, relationship
to God, and conception of Jesus
Christ's significance. Students
were given an opportunity to
comment on some basic Christian
principles. Only freshmen have
participated in order to provide a
consistent sampling base and for
the practical reason that they are
more easily contacted.
Approximately two thirds of the
class responded, offering the
following opinions which
appeared to be more carefully
considered than those of previous
years.
Roman Catholicism (22.1
percent) led other denominations
for the third consecutive year as
the faith representing students'
religious backgrounds. Other
frequently named backgrounds
were Presbyterian (13.1 percent),
Episcopalian (9.8 percent),
Congregational (8.9 percent), and
independent Christian (3.9
percent). The proportion of
students having no
denominational background fell
to 12.1 percent from 27.1 percent
of the previous year.
The greatest range of response
was to the question, "What in
your opinion is the basic problem
of humanity?" Some of the
responses included
self-centeredness (27.5 percent),
intolerance (11.6 percent), lack of
purpose (17.1 percent), and lack
of education (2.7 percent).

Of those surveyed, 40.0
percent indicated they had a
definite philosophy while 56.7
percent had a somewhat vague
philosophy and 3.3 percent had
none. Many claimed that
significant changes had taken
place in their thinking since
coming to Stanford. Interestingly,
43.5 percent indicated that their
personal philosophy included a
solution to man's basic problem,
at least on the individual level.
A surprising 63.2 percent
responded affirmatively to the
question, "Do you believe in a
God who is both infinite and
personal?" The remaining 36.8
percent split their answers
between "No" and more
narrowly-defined conceptions of
God. Sex difference was
agnificant here: of the women,
67.6 percent responded
affirmatively versus 58.8 percent
of the men.
"Who in your opinion is Jesus
Christ?" elicited responses of Son
of God (39.8 percent), teacher or
philosopher (18.0 percent),
religious figure (8.6 percent), and
unsure (14.0 percent). These
convictions were reflected in the
jump from 11.9 percent to 27.0
percent who explained that one
becomes a Christian by "believing
in Christ as personal savior."
One thing is certain: Stanford
frosh are not spiritually apathetic.
The often encountered
noncommittal spiritual attitudes
seem to exist only because
students take these issues
seriously enough to cautiously
evaluate all the philosophies
encountered at Stanford. This
year's freshmen will have an
opportunity to offer their view in
the same survey, and the
computer-tabulated results will be
analyzed spring quarter for
Stanford Daily publication.
