Welcome!
Editor:
On behalf of the City Council,
welcome to the Palo Alto
community. While you may not
be living within Palo Alto, you
undoubtedly will take advantage
of the many resources and
opportunities which the Palo Alto
area offers. Palo Alto and
Stanford enjoy a unique and
special relationship. Both
communities are enriched by the
variety of facilities and
opportunities that each provides.
As neighbors, we hope that you
will find the services offered by
the City to be of assistance
throughout your experience at
Stanford. There are some
activities that you may be
particularly intersted in. Palo Alto
has a fine on-going cultural
program provided by the Arts
Department which includes Arts
and Crafts Exhibits at the
Community Cultural Center, a full
schedule of plays, and various
craft and discussion workshops.
The City's concern for
preserving and enhancing the
environment has led to the
establishment of a Baylands
Preserve, re-cycling facilities,
special open space areas in the
foothills, and a bicycle path
system offers a safe and exciting
alternative to the automobile.
These are, of course, only a few of
many programs offered by the
City which may be of interest to
you. I encourage you to get to
know and enjoy the opportunities
within the area.
Finally, let me extend to you
my best wishes for success in your
endeavors at Stanford.
Sincerely,
Enid Pearson
Vice Mayor
Use Caution
Editor:
Last Saturday evening there
was a tragic traffic accident on
Junipero Serra Blvd. which killed
two Palo Alto youths and
seriously injured a third person.
Most members of the Stanford
community, especially the new
students, do not realize that this
unfortunate accident was not an
isolated incident.
In the past three years the
residents of the short stretch of
Junipero Serra Blvd. between
Stanford Avenue and Mayfield
Avenue have witnessed the horror
and gore of six fatalities and many
extremely serious injuries.
Just in front of his home,
Professor Nathan Oliviera
observed the fiery death of one of
his students. Major and minor
accidents not involving fatalities
are a common occurrence on this
half mile section of road, and we
see and experience near misses

daily. It is also sad to count the
members of wild animals which
are killed on this road which cuts
between the hills and the wooded
areas of campus. Five years ago
raccoons were common visitors to
homes on Junipero Serra, and
now they are non-existant.
If the statistics were adjusted
for traffic volume, this short
section of roadway on the
Stanford campus might be one of
the most hazardous and deadly
roads in California.
I urge all members of the
Stanford community to exercise
caution when traveling on
Junipero Serra Blvd. and to
observe the 35 m.p.h. speed limit.
Anyone who is interested in
working for a safer Junipero Serra
Blvd. or anyone who has any ideas
as to how that can be achieved is
invited to attend a meeting
tonight, at 7:30 p.m. at my home:
648 Junipero Serra Blvd. (Foothill
Rd.)

Student Activities
Editor:
This summer the ASSU
Council of Presidents, in
conjunction with the Dean of
Student Affairs Office, is
attempting to compile
information for an activities
handbook. The handbook is
intended to better inform
Stanford students as to the kinds
of opportunities available through
the 100-plus student organizations
registered on campus.
Organizations will be listed in the
handbook by interest group (e.g.
social action, political,
recreational, minority, women's
affairs, religious). Following the
name of each organization will be
listed the telephone number,
location and name of the group's
representative, plus a brief
description of the group's
activities. The handbook will also
contain how-to's and useful
information * for organizations,
such as guidelines for starting a
new group, seed funding and
fund-raising, guidelines for
political/commercial activities,
and listings of meeting spaces and
auditoriums on campus.
In order to list your
organization in the handbook, we
need some information from you
on the activities of your group.
The description need not be
detailed, but it should include
enough information to give a good
idea of the scope of your group. If
you are connected with such an
organization, please fill out a form
in the Dean of Student Affairs
Office, Old Union, or in the ASSU
Office, Tresidder, as soon as
possible.
