# Nixon Appointees Involved?
## San Jose Riot Probed 
### 
SAN JOSE (AP) - Special
Watergate Prosecutor Archibald
Cox's staff is investigating
whether the 1970 rock and egg
throwing incident involving
President Nixon here was incited
or exploited by Nixon appointees,
a spokesman for the state senator
who requested the probe said
Monday.
State Sen. Alfred E. Alquist,
Dâ€” San Jo9e, received a
two-sentence letter from
Watergate Assistant Special
Prosecutor Nathaniel H. Akerman

confirming the planned probe,
Alquist's office said.
"This office is aware of
allegations arising out of the
President's visit to San Jose in
1970, and it is our intention to
investigate this matter to the
extent it falls within the
jurisdiction of this office,"
Akerman's letter said.
Alquist's administrative
assistant, Gael Douglass, released
the Akerman letter after its
contents were reported in the San
Jose News Monday. Douglass also

released Alquist's letter to Cox on
Aug. 6 requesting the probe.
In his letter to Cox, Alquist
said both police and the secret
service did all that was possible to
prevent the incident.
"This would appear to leave
only the security directives
themselves as an explanation for
what was allowed to develop,"
Alquist said.
Douglass said doubts had been
raised by the security directives
and the handling of the
demonstration.
"Deliberate incitment may
have been involved," Douglass
said.
Rocks and eggs were thrown at
the presidential limousine as it
was leaving the San Jose Civic
Auditorium. President Nixon had
flashed the crowd of
demonstrators a "V" sign before
he entered the car.
At least two demonstrators
were injured in the incidents and
four were arrested on various
charges in connection with the
demonstration.
The paper said that Akerman
when contacted in Washington,
D.C., said his probe was based on
the allegations that presidential
appointees might be involved.
