# School Lunch Aid Hike Voted
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Senate yesterday voted a
$315-million federal increase in
the nation's school-lunch
program, twice the hike
recommended by the House.
Senators who favored a smaller
increase said the Senate was so
generous that President Nixon
might veto the bill.
The government last year spent
$1.5 billion on the school-lunch
program, which includes low-cost
breakfasts in some schools, free
milk and other projects designed
to improve child nutrition.

By an 81 to 4 vote Monday,
the Senate voted to raise the
federal contribution to the basic
program by 50 percent.
The key vote was the 52 to 34
adoption of an amendment by
Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey,
D—Minn., to raise the federal
subsidy from eight to 12 cents per
lunch, regardless of a pupil's
financial need.
The House-passed bill, and the
original Senate proposal, would
raise the subsidy to 10 cents.
A compromise will have to be
worked out between House and
Senate versions.
