# Grand Juries Examine Alleged Misconduct Cases
## 
### 
PHOENIX (AP) â€” Watergate
and the Maryland kickback probe
involving Spiro T. Agnew have
received the lion's share of
headlines on corruption in
government. But the war against

illicit activities by public officials
is being waged on many other
legal battlegrounds as well.
An Associated Press survey
showed federal and county grand
juries in areas from Pennsylvania

to Arizona are investigating
allegations of wrongdoing
involving officials at varying levels
of government.
The Arizona case, which drew
national attention, involves Sen.
Paul Fannin, a Republican, who
was arrested last November and
charged with driving while
intoxicated.
The charge was dropped after
three physicians submitted sworn
statements that a drug the senator
was taking could have affected the
results of a breathalyzer test.
Maricopa County Atty. Moise
Berger refiled the charge in
August, however, and Fannin
pleaded guilty. The senator was
sentenced to one day in the

county jail and was fined $110.
Grand Jury Probe
A county grand jury probe is
under way into the circumstances
by which the original charge was
dismissed. Fannin testified before
the panel and reportedly told the
grand jury he was unaware of
alleged political pressure to stop
the investigation.
Most of the probes into
possible political corruption
concern lesser-known figures.
Though they have not drawn so
much attention as Watergate or
the Baltimore grand jury
investigation of allegations that
Agnew was involved in a kickback
scandal while an elected official in
Maryland, the issues have a

familiar ring.
Accused of Phone Tap
On July 17, for example, a
county grand jury recommended
criminal indictment against Mayor
John R. Coder of Williamsport,
Pa., alleging that he tapped the
telephone of a now-retired police
captain in an effort to get him off
the force.
The grand jury recommended
that Coder, a Republican, and
John M. Samony, the city public
safety director, be charged with
criminal conspiracy, intercepting
and recording telephone
conversations and false swearing.
Hie district attorney filed charges
late in July.
In Michigan, a county probate
judge, a state senator and a liquor
salesman are under indictment on
charges of conspiracy to bribe an
official of the state liquor
commission.
The charges against State Sen.
Charies N. Youngblood, a
Democrat from Detroit; Wayne

County Probate Court Judge
Frank S. Szymanski, and salesman
Louis Pappas were handed down
by a grand jury last February and
the case is expected to come to
trial shortly.
The three men are accused of
conspiring to bribe an official of
the state Liquor Control
Commission to obtain liquor
licenses for Borman's Inc.,
operator of Farmer Jack
supermarkets.
A federal grand jury in
Oklahoma City indicted the state
treasurer, Leo Winters, a
Democrat, last May 31 on charges
of conspiracy to commit
extortion, mail fraud and misuse
of bank funds.
Winters, who is accused of
conspiring to deposit state funds
under his control in certain banks
in return for loans and
other considerations, claims the
probe is a "Republican-sponsored
witch hunt" led by U.S. Atty.

William R. Burkett, a former state
GOP chairman.
A federal grand jury in Illinois
is probing racing stock linked to
political figures. The investigation
is a follow-up to the probe that
resulted in the conviction last
February of U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals Judge Otto Kemer,
governor of Illinois from 1960 to
1968.
Kerner, who is now on leave
from the court, and an associate
were convicted of conspiracy,
bribery, income tax evasion and
stock fraud in connection with
stock deals made when Kemer
was governor. Kemer also was
convicted of perjury and making a
false statement to an Internal
Revenue Service agent.
The case is under appeal. If the
conviction is upheld, Kerner faces
a maximum sentence of 83 years
in prison and fines of $93,000.
In the Chicago area,
meanwhile, federal and Cook
County grand juries are
continuing a two-year probe of
police corruption. Sixty-one
policement have been indicted.
A Cook County grand jury also
indicted Alderman Thomas
Keane, an aide to Mayor Richard
J. Daley. Keane was indicted on
conflict of interest charges
stemming from his alleged
involement in authorizing city
funds to be placed in a bank in
which he held stock.
Both the majority and
minority floor leaders of the
Washington senate are under
investigation by a federal grand
jury in Seattle.
The panel is looking at charges
that State. Sen. August Mardesich,
a Democrat and the majority
leader, accepted payoffs from
garbage disposal interests and at
an allegation that State Sen. Harry
Lewis, a Republican and the
minority leader, was improperly
involved in securing a federal loan
for an industrial development
complex.
