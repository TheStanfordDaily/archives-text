# Government Asks Court To Enforce Unlawful Penalties
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The government has
urged the Supreme Court to enforce contempt fines
against reporters who disobey concededly illegal
judicial orders.
The government plea came in response to an
appeal by two Baton Rouge, La., newspaper
reporters seeking to overturn $300 contempt fines
levied against them.
The two reporters disobeyed a federal district
court order prohibiting reporting of details of a
hearing held in open court. *
The appeal turns on whether the order of District
Court Judge E. Gordon West was so obviously illegal
that it freed the reporters from any responsibility to
comply pending appeal.
The 1971 hearing dealt with allegations by a
black civil rights worker, Frank Stewart, that state
charges against him were politically motivated and
aimed at abridging his Ist Amendment rights.
Stewart was indicted in 1970 for allegedly
conspiring to murder the mayor of Baton Rouge.
Reported On Testimony
The reporters, Gibbs Adams and Larry Dickinson
of the Morning Advocate and the State-Times,
respectively, reported on testimony in editions
immediately following the hearing.
The U.S. Circuit Court at New Orleans
invalidated West's order, but ruled that the order
should have been obeyed until reversed by a higher
court.
"It was not unreasonable to conclude that
newspaper accounts of the hearing might cause, at
the time of publication itself, irreversible prejudice
to the rights of the accused and the public to have
an impartial jury trial at the place where the crime

was allegedly committed," wrote U.S. Solicitor
General Robert H. Bork.
'Had No Right'
"Under these circumstances Adams and
Dickinson had no right to disregard the District
Court's order as frivolous or transparently invalid,"
Bork continued.
Lawyers for Adams and Dickinson had argued
just the opposite. To uphold West's order, they
maintained would "arm courts with the power to
authorize patently impermissible prior restraints on
the exercise of Ist Amendment rights through the
use of contempt power and thus allow them to
accomplish indirectly what the Constitution flatly
prohibits them from doing directly."
The government noted that accounts of the
hearing were published without an attempt to
overturn West's order on appeal.
Compelled Compliance
Compliance with such an order, the government
continued, must be compelled in an area where
some restrictions on the press are permissible in
pursuit of the constitutional demand for an
impartial jury.
If not, Bork argued, trial judges may increasingly
turn to closed-door hearings, a result that would
restrict not expand public access to court
proceedings.
The government's response was filed nearly a
month and a half late.
The late filing would apparently have no effect
since the court has been in summer recess and will
not reconvene its new term until Oct. 1. No reason
for the late filing was given. The response was made
public at the court Monday.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The government has
urged the Supreme Court to enforce contempt fines
against reporters who disobey concededly illegal
judicial orders.
The government plea came in response to an
appeal by two Baton Rouge, La., newspaper
reporters seeking to overturn $300 contempt fines
levied against them.
The two reporters disobeyed a federal district
court order prohibiting reporting of details of a
hearing held in open court. *
The appeal turns on whether the order of District
Court Judge E. Gordon West was so obviously illegal
that it freed the reporters from any responsibility to
comply pending appeal.
The 1971 hearing dealt with allegations by a
black civil rights worker, Frank Stewart, that state
charges against him were politically motivated and
aimed at abridging his Ist Amendment rights.
Stewart was indicted in 1970 for allegedly
conspiring to murder the mayor of Baton Rouge.
Reported On Testimony
The reporters, Gibbs Adams and Larry Dickinson
of the Morning Advocate and the State-Times,
respectively, reported on testimony in editions
immediately following the hearing.
The U.S. Circuit Court at New Orleans
invalidated West's order, but ruled that the order
should have been obeyed until reversed by a higher
court.
"It was not unreasonable to conclude that
newspaper accounts of the hearing might cause, at
the time of publication itself, irreversible prejudice
to the rights of the accused and the public to have
an impartial jury trial at the place where the crime

was allegedly committed," wrote U.S. Solicitor
General Robert H. Bork.
'Had No Right'
"Under these circumstances Adams and
Dickinson had no right to disregard the District
Court's order as frivolous or transparently invalid,"
Bork continued.
Lawyers for Adams and Dickinson had argued
just the opposite. To uphold West's order, they
maintained would "arm courts with the power to
authorize patently impermissible prior restraints on
the exercise of Ist Amendment rights through the
use of contempt power and thus allow them to
accomplish indirectly what the Constitution flatly
prohibits them from doing directly."
The government noted that accounts of the
hearing were published without an attempt to
overturn West's order on appeal.
Compelled Compliance
Compliance with such an order, the government
continued, must be compelled in an area where
some restrictions on the press are permissible in
pursuit of the constitutional demand for an
impartial jury.
If not, Bork argued, trial judges may increasingly
turn to closed-door hearings, a result that would
restrict not expand public access to court
proceedings.
The government's response was filed nearly a
month and a half late.
The late filing would apparently have no effect
since the court has been in summer recess and will
not reconvene its new term until Oct. 1. No reason
for the late filing was given. The response was made
public at the court Monday.
