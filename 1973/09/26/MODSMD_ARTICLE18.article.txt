# Marijuana Studied For Anesthetic Possibilities
## 
### 
PHILADELPHA (AP) - A
dozen volunteers are being given
marijuana in a study to see how it
works as an anesthetic.
Dr. Theodore Smith, head of
the University of Pennsylvania
Hospital team making the study,
says the weed holds promise as an
anesthetic but it will be at least
another year before marijuana
could be given to a surgical
patient.
Each volunteer is strapped to a
table, a mask placed over the face
to monitor breathing and
marijuana dissolved in alcohol is
inserted into the heart through a

tube entering the body at the
neck and routed through blood
vessels.
The solution must be inserted
this way because marijuana won't
dissolve in water and it is
extremely painful to inject
alcohol with a hypodermic
syringe, Smith said.
The researchers hope the large
doses of marijuana — 1,000 times
the amount of active ingredients
in a puff from a marijuana
cigarette — will replace a large
variety of drugs now required for
surgical patients, without the
undesirable side effects.
