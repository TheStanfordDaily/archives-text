# Management Changes Tresidder Cafeteria
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Tout de Suite, Inc. (TDS) has been
trying to change the Tresidder
cafeteria from a white elephant to a
profit-making restaurant.
Since taking over management of
the Cafeteria June 23, TDS has already
made several organizational changes,
according to the company's president,
Skip Mclntyre.
First, TDS installed a new line of
beverage machines, replacing the
former meter-measured machines.
"They were unsanitary, the customer
never knew how much he might get,
there was an overflow problem,"
Mclntyre explained.
One meter-measured machine, for
milk, does remain in the cafeteria, but
TDS hopes to replace this machine
soon, pending financial considerations.
New Hours
Second, Tresidder now opens at 8
a.m. instead of 9:30 on weekends.
"We used to have crowds waiting at
the door before opening and then,
when we did open, we couldn't serve
the huge number of people properly,"
Mclntyre says.
However, Tresidder still closes at 8
p.m. on weekdays, although TDS
hopes to delay closing time until 10 or
10:30 p.m. soon.
"We would really like to stay open
later," cafeteria manager Louise
Swanson explained, "but we can't to
so until all our schedules for student
employees are set."
"We feel we could fill a need in the
University if we could fill the 9 p.m.
snack trade," Mclntyre said.
Self-Busing
TDS has also instituted self-busing
of dishes in a move to free workers for
other tasks. "In the first few days it's
been working out phenomenally well,"
Food Services Director John Shaw
said. "It's been at least 80 percent
effective."
TDS hopes to institute other
changes shortly, including:
— further improvement of the
fast-fry area, which, at least until

recently, has been notoriously slow;
— creation of an express check-out
line;
— and adding more items, possibly
including specialty items such as
Mexican food, to the menu.
TDS also hopes to eventually carpet
the floors and put vinyl tile on the
walls.
Blue Is Blah
"Our studies show us that blue is
the worst possible color for the food
management... on grey mornings in
here, it really looks blah," Mclntyre
said.
TDS wants to replace the blue ana
white decor with one centered around
warm yellows, oranges, and greens.
"But we can't go ahead and do it,"
Mclntyre said, "until it's financially
feasible."
Meanwhile, despite an 18 percent
price increase in August, Tresidder's
sales are considerably higher than last
year.

"But we can't go ahead and do it,"
Mclntyre said, "until it's financially
feasible."
Meanwhile, despite an 18 percent
price increase in August, Tresidder's
sales are considerably higher than last
year.

WAITING GAME — Most students did not find the lines in Maples Pavilion this
short during registration yesterday and Monday.
Tout de Suite, Inc. (TDS) has been
trying to change the Tresidder
cafeteria from a white elephant to a
profit-making restaurant.
Since taking over management of
the Cafeteria June 23, TDS has already
made several organizational changes,
according to the company's president,
Skip Mclntyre.
First, TDS installed a new line of
beverage machines, replacing the
former meter-measured machines.
"They were unsanitary, the customer
never knew how much he might get,
there was an overflow problem,"
Mclntyre explained.
One meter-measured machine, for
milk, does remain in the cafeteria, but
TDS hopes to replace this machine
soon, pending financial considerations.
New Hours
Second, Tresidder now opens at 8
a.m. instead of 9:30 on weekends.
"We used to have crowds waiting at
the door before opening and then,
when we did open, we couldn't serve
the huge number of people properly,"
Mclntyre says.
However, Tresidder still closes at 8
p.m. on weekdays, although TDS
hopes to delay closing time until 10 or
10:30 p.m. soon.
"We would really like to stay open
later," cafeteria manager Louise
Swanson explained, "but we can't to
so until all our schedules for student
employees are set."
"We feel we could fill a need in the
University if we could fill the 9 p.m.
snack trade," Mclntyre said.
Self-Busing
TDS has also instituted self-busing
of dishes in a move to free workers for
other tasks. "In the first few days it's
been working out phenomenally well,"
Food Services Director John Shaw
said. "It's been at least 80 percent
effective."
TDS hopes to institute other
changes shortly, including:
— further improvement of the
fast-fry area, which, at least until

recently, has been notoriously slow;
— creation of an express check-out
line;
— and adding more items, possibly
including specialty items such as
Mexican food, to the menu.
TDS also hopes to eventually carpet
the floors and put vinyl tile on the
walls.
Blue Is Blah
"Our studies show us that blue is
the worst possible color for the food
management... on grey mornings in
here, it really looks blah," Mclntyre
said.
TDS wants to replace the blue ana
white decor with one centered around
warm yellows, oranges, and greens.
"But we can't go ahead and do it,"
Mclntyre said, "until it's financially
feasible."
Meanwhile, despite an 18 percent
price increase in August, Tresidder's
sales are considerably higher than last
