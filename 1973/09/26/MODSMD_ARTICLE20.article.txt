# Cold Prevention Researcher
## Prof Receives Medicine Award 
### 
Dr. Thomas C. Merigan,
professor of medicine and head of
the division of infectious diseases
at the School of Medicine, has
been named winner of the annual
Borden Award for outstanding
research from the Association of
American Medical Colleges
(AAMC).
The award was announced
yesterday by Dr. John A.D.
Cooper, president of the AAMC.
It will be presented to Merigan
Nov. 6 at the AAMC's 84th
annual meeting in Washington,
D.C.
Merigan was cited for his
pioneering work on interferon, a
protein produced by body cells in

response to virus infection. In
March of this year, he and three
doctors from the Common Cold
Unit at Harvard Hospital in
Wiltshire, England reported they
had successfully used inteferon to
prevent common cold infections
in human volunteers.
Effective doses of interferon
produced by currently available
methods cost several thousand
dollars each. The protein will not
be marketable at reasonable prices
for several years.
Merigan explained that
interferon "aborts" cold
symptoms because doctors can
administer it "earlier and in
greater quantity" than is normal

when the body itself responds to a
viral infection.
A prolific writer and
researcher, Merigan has made
numerous other contributions in
the fields of molecular biology,
virology, and human genetics.

The San Francisco native
obtained his B.A. (1955) and
M.D. (1958) degrees from the
University of California. Before
joining the faculty at Stanford in
1963, he was a clinical associate at
the National Heart Institute in
Bethesda, Maryland.
