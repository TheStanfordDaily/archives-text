# State Colleges Tighten Discipline Regulations
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - A
committee of the trustees of the
California State University and
Colleges voted yesterday to
tighten regulations on student
probation and disqualification.
The resolution adopted by the
Committee on Educational Policy
places a new emphasis on a
student's progress toward his
academic goal rather than relying
primarily on his gradepoint
average.
The trustees were concerned
about excessive withdrawals from
courses and repeated changes in
degree goals. Under the new
policy not only will poor grades
be considered for probation and
disqualification, but the
administrations also will take into
account whether the student is
making satisfactory progress
toward his goal and the number of
withdrawals.

The committee agreed to
consider at the next trustees'
meeting the matter of students
who routinely schedule extra
classes with the intention of
dropping them.
Clay Sharts, a professor at Cal
State San Diego told the
committee that this practice is a
waste of academic resources and
denies many entering freshmen
the opportunity to take classes
they need.
"Upperclassmen who register
early systematically enroll in 17
units with the full intention of
dropping one course," Sharts said.
"This denies entering freshmen
vitally needed classes. All that's
left for them is garbage."
Sharts suggested that every
student be given a unit budget
that would carry him toward
graduation and be charged tuition
for any extra units scheduled.
