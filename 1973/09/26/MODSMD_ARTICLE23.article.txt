# Still Much To Learn'
## Poet Chaucer Revived: A Tale Of Eight Studies 
### EMERSON BROWN, JR 
Although most of the
worthwhile contributions to our
understanding of Chaucer
continue to appear in the form of
journal articles rather than books,
enough books dealing in part or
entirely with Chaucer have
appeared within the last year or so
to justify a brief review.
Roger Hart's English Life in
Chaucer's Day (London-New
York: Wayland-G.P. Putnams,
1973) is a coffee table sort of
book, one of a series he has
turned out recently including
English Life in the Seventeenth
Century, English Life in Tudor
Times, and so on. He seems to
work rather fast. The book
contains lots of pictures, many of
them quite interesting, including
eight pages of color plates of
unequal quality. The bibliography
somehow manages to omit all
important editions of Chaucer's
own works and the Chaucer Life
Records.
Such statements as "In 1361,
twenty years before the Black
Death," lead one to have some
doubts about the accuracy of the
factual information that fills in
the spaces between the pictures,
but the absence of any
documentation to support the
text makes it impossible to check
the sources of his "facts."
There are some good things in
this book, but all in all it has little
to recommend it above the similar
works recently put together by
Maurice Hussey (Chaucer's

World), F.E. Halliday (Chaucer
and His World), and R.S. Loomis
(A Mirror of Chaucer's World) and
the older but fuller and still
fascinating collection by G.G.
Coulton, Chaucer and His England
Useful Books
Useful background books with
a greater proportion of text to
illustration are Derek Brewer's
Chaucer in His Time and the
occasionally exasperating but
stimulating Chaucer's London by
the controversial Princeton
medievalist D.W. Robertson, Jr.
The picture on the cover of
Thomas W. Ross's Chaucer's
Bawdy (New York: E.P. Dutton,
1972) — a naked Lady Godiva
type sitting behind pilgrim
Geoffrey on his horse — is enough
to make the heart of any
red-blooded Chaucerian skip a
beat. Unfortunately, the title, that
picture, and the blurb on the back
cover ("an anlysis of over 300
risque words used by
Chaucer. . . ") promise a good
deal more than the book delivers.
Among these 300 risque words
are such invitations to slathering
lubricity as the following:
"copulacioun. Chaucer does not
use the word;" or "bak: An object
of erotic pleasure, as in Troilus
and Criseyde (III.1247) where he
strokes 'hire streghte bak and
softe' or "ball. Never used for
testicle in Chaucer, which is
unfortunate since there are so
many opportunities for comedy."
Apparently, any opportunity to
be bawdy which Chaucer misses is

"unfortunate," as we note at the
beginning of the entry on
"coppe": "Could it mean vagina
in Chaucer'? I am afraid that the
evidence is disappointing."
On the other hand, an
occasional entry is surprisingly
good. His suggestion that there is
a potential pun lurking in the
word "grace" that might link it
with "grass," and hence pubic
hair, makes the Squire's hope to
"stonden in his lady grace" rather
more interesting than heretofore
and makes Troilus's fear that he
might "fall in grace" even more
disconcerting.
Disappointment
For those seeking a scholarly,
judicious investigation of an
important feature of Chaucer's
diction this book is a distinct
disappointment. As a series of
chatty, opinionated, often trivial,
frequently strained but
occasionally genuinely
enlightening short essays it may
have a place.
If nothing else, it serves to
remind us that we still could use a
good dictionary of Chaucer's
English — a dictionary more
sensitive to faint overtone,
punning (including bi-lingual
punning), bawdiness of all sorts,
cross reference, enrichment from
context, and so on than the OED
or MED is, or, of course, could or
should be.
Although pleased to note the
first sentence under the long entry
for women — "Bawdiness cannot
exist without them," MCP's will

be unhappy to see that there is no
entry for men.
In Poetry and Crisis in the Age
of Chaucer (Notre Dame:
University of Notre Dame Press:
1972) Charles Muscatine examines
Chaucer, Langland and the Pearl
poet, and their responses to the
cultural crises of the late 14th
century. After an introductory
chapter, "Relevance, Poetic Style,
and Cultural Crisis," he devotes
one chapter to each of the three
writers. These four chapters were
originally a series of lectures given
at Notre Dame in 1969. Many of
us were trying to be relevant then,
and Professor Muscatine has come
closer to succeeding than most.
Muscatine's approach is at once
original and highly derivative. It is
indeed "relevant" to see how
these poets faced the crises of
their time. His general statements
about them strike me as often
sound and occasionally brilliant,
but when he gets down to
particulars he has less new insight
to offer.
His chapter on Chaucer, "Irony
and Its Alternatives," is somewhat
disappointing. There is very little
original thinking here, and in
surveying the work of other
students of Chaucer, Muscatine is
not always as thorough as he
might be.
Somewhere Between
Nevertheless, though perhaps a
bit thin on original discovery and
a bit lacking in bold suggestion,
this is a worthwhile book. There is
a calm wisdom in Muscatine's

appraisal of the poetic solutions
to the difficult times these poets
faced.
He concludes: "These three are
great poets, and their response to
their own culture is deeper and
truer than other men's. Studying
through them the relation of
poetry to history, we learn
something about the responses of
men to history as well."
P.M. Kean's two-volume study,

Chaucer and the Making of
English Poetry (London:
Itantledge and Kegan Paul: 1972),
is the most ambitious in scope of
all the books here reviewed. She
attempts to discuss virtually all of
Chaucer's poetry, and even 460
pages is not enough for such an
undertaking. This is a difficult
book to appraise. Much of it is
either derivative or obvious but
