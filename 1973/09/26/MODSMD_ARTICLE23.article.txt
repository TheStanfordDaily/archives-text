# Still Much To Learn'
## Poet Chaucer Revived: A Tale Of Eight Studies 
### EMERSON BROWN, JR 
Although most of the
worthwhile contributions to our
understanding of Chaucer
continue to appear in the form of
journal articles rather than books,
enough books dealing in part or
entirely with Chaucer have
appeared within the last year or so
to justify a brief review.
Roger Hart's English Life in
Chaucer's Day (London-New
York: Wayland-G.P. Putnams,
1973) is a coffee table sort of
book, one of a series he has
turned out recently including
English Life in the Seventeenth
Century, English Life in Tudor
Times, and so on. He seems to
work rather fast. The book
contains lots of pictures, many of
them quite interesting, including
eight pages of color plates of
unequal quality. The bibliography
somehow manages to omit all
important editions of Chaucer's
own works and the Chaucer Life
Records.
Such statements as "In 1361,
twenty years before the Black
Death," lead one to have some
doubts about the accuracy of the
factual information that fills in
the spaces between the pictures,
but the absence of any
documentation to support the
text makes it impossible to check
the sources of his "facts."
There are some good things in
this book, but all in all it has little
to recommend it above the similar
works recently put together by
Maurice Hussey (Chaucer's

World), F.E. Halliday (Chaucer
and His World), and R.S. Loomis
(A Mirror of Chaucer's World) and
the older but fuller and still
fascinating collection by G.G.
Coulton, Chaucer and His England
Useful Books
Useful background books with
a greater proportion of text to
illustration are Derek Brewer's
Chaucer in His Time and the
occasionally exasperating but
stimulating Chaucer's London by
the controversial Princeton
medievalist D.W. Robertson, Jr.
The picture on the cover of
Thomas W. Ross's Chaucer's
Bawdy (New York: E.P. Dutton,
1972) — a naked Lady Godiva
type sitting behind pilgrim
Geoffrey on his horse — is enough
to make the heart of any
red-blooded Chaucerian skip a
beat. Unfortunately, the title, that
picture, and the blurb on the back
cover ("an anlysis of over 300
risque words used by
Chaucer. . . ") promise a good
deal more than the book delivers.
Among these 300 risque words
are such invitations to slathering
lubricity as the following:
"copulacioun. Chaucer does not
use the word;" or "bak: An object
of erotic pleasure, as in Troilus
and Criseyde (III.1247) where he
strokes 'hire streghte bak and
softe' or "ball. Never used for
testicle in Chaucer, which is
unfortunate since there are so
many opportunities for comedy."
Apparently, any opportunity to
be bawdy which Chaucer misses is

"unfortunate," as we note at the
beginning of the entry on
"coppe": "Could it mean vagina
in Chaucer'? I am afraid that the
evidence is disappointing."
On the other hand, an
occasional entry is surprisingly
good. His suggestion that there is
a potential pun lurking in the
word "grace" that might link it
with "grass," and hence pubic
hair, makes the Squire's hope to
"stonden in his lady grace" rather
more interesting than heretofore
and makes Troilus's fear that he
might "fall in grace" even more
disconcerting.
Disappointment
For those seeking a scholarly,
judicious investigation of an
important feature of Chaucer's
diction this book is a distinct
disappointment. As a series of
chatty, opinionated, often trivial,
frequently strained but
occasionally genuinely
enlightening short essays it may
have a place.
If nothing else, it serves to
remind us that we still could use a
good dictionary of Chaucer's
English — a dictionary more
sensitive to faint overtone,
punning (including bi-lingual
punning), bawdiness of all sorts,
cross reference, enrichment from
context, and so on than the OED
or MED is, or, of course, could or
should be.
Although pleased to note the
first sentence under the long entry
for women — "Bawdiness cannot
exist without them," MCP's will

be unhappy to see that there is no
entry for men.
In Poetry and Crisis in the Age
of Chaucer (Notre Dame:
University of Notre Dame Press:
1972) Charles Muscatine examines
Chaucer, Langland and the Pearl
poet, and their responses to the
cultural crises of the late 14th
century. After an introductory
chapter, "Relevance, Poetic Style,
and Cultural Crisis," he devotes
one chapter to each of the three
writers. These four chapters were
originally a series of lectures given
at Notre Dame in 1969. Many of
us were trying to be relevant then,
and Professor Muscatine has come
closer to succeeding than most.
Muscatine's approach is at once
original and highly derivative. It is
indeed "relevant" to see how
these poets faced the crises of
their time. His general statements
about them strike me as often
sound and occasionally brilliant,
but when he gets down to
particulars he has less new insight
to offer.
His chapter on Chaucer, "Irony
and Its Alternatives," is somewhat
disappointing. There is very little
original thinking here, and in
surveying the work of other
students of Chaucer, Muscatine is
not always as thorough as he
might be.
Somewhere Between
Nevertheless, though perhaps a
bit thin on original discovery and
a bit lacking in bold suggestion,
this is a worthwhile book. There is
a calm wisdom in Muscatine's

appraisal of the poetic solutions
to the difficult times these poets
faced.
He concludes: "These three are
great poets, and their response to
their own culture is deeper and
truer than other men's. Studying
through them the relation of
poetry to history, we learn
something about the responses of
men to history as well."
P.M. Kean's two-volume study,

Chaucer and the Making of
English Poetry (London:
Itantledge and Kegan Paul: 1972),
is the most ambitious in scope of
all the books here reviewed. She
attempts to discuss virtually all of
Chaucer's poetry, and even 460
pages is not enough for such an
undertaking. This is a difficult
book to appraise. Much of it is
either derivative or obvious but
there is also some original research
and some original thinking.
Throughout, though, her work
is damaged by the tendency to
overlook important studies that
have appeared in recent years. The
result is too many errors, too
many facile conclusions that a
sympathetic study of the
scholarly work of others would
have made impossible.
Her introduction, "Chaucer
and the English Tradition," is
quite good. Also, her final
chapter, "The Noble Rethor
Poet," treats well the range and
importance of Chaucer's influence
on English poetry for the century
or so following his death. These
two chapters certainly justify her
title, but too much of that which
lies between them is little more
than plot summary, lengthy
quotation, and idle chatter.
It is a shame that people
sometimes feel compelled to write
books when they don't quite have
books to write. These volumes
contain material for many good
articles, and one can only hope
that Professor Kean will turn once
again to some of the issues she has
raised here but treated more
superficially than they deserve.
Book's Highlight
The chapter on the Knight's
Tale in lan Robinson's Chaucer
and the English Tradition
(Cambridge, England: Cambridge
University Press, 1972) is the best
thing in the book and with some
rethinking and rewriting it might
make a good journal article.
As for the rest of the book, it
consists mainly of the sort of
thing anyone who has taught
Chaucer for a few years could sit
down and dictate without any
research, without any new
information, with nothing,
indeed, beyond a reasonable
amount of literacy, some memory
of Chaucer's works and what a
few other people have said about
them, and with some recollection
of scraps of reading from other
English writers.
The theoretical position, to be
generous, upon which this study is
based seems to be that if one is
sufficiently English (as
demonstrated by one's capacity to
cite Dickens, Joyce, Shakespeare,
Conrad, Tolkien, Coventry
Patmore, Donne, Milton, D.H.

Lawrence (repeatedly), Samuel
Johnson, Wycherly, George, and
even T.S., Eliot), then one can
read Chaucer (and write about
Chaucer) without the aid of other
critics and scholars.
True Test
The test of the scholar-critic of
medieval literature, however, is
not whether or not he embraces
the basic principles of other
scholars unquestioningly, but how
well he is able to select the truly
brilliant insights from among
uneven writings and assimilate
them productively into his own
critical approach. This is a test
Robinson fails utterly.
He doesn't reveal the full range
of his shallow pretentiousness,
however, until he comes to Dante.
TTie tortured reasoning and
painful chauvinism that lead him
to the conclusion that Chaucer's is
"the surer genius of the two" are
more embarrassing than troubling,
especially given his admission that
he reads "Dante in the Temple
Classics text, making frequent use
of the facing translations."
Of the great advances in Dante
studies in recent decades made by
such scholars as C-S. Singleton,
John Freccero, and Erich
Auerbach, he seems totally
unaware. Don't misunderstand. I
love Chaucer dearly. But no one's
genius is surer than Dante's.
As I stoically plowed through
this seemingly endless book, I had
the feeling that I had been invited
to dinner by an old retired cavalry
officer who had last seen active
duty in the Boer war and of late
had taken up medieval poetry to
fill the lonesome hours between
sherry and brandy. When I find
myself led into his study and
settled into a comfortable chair as
he begins to talk, I see nothing at
first to cause alarm.
Uninformed Pronouncements
He is, after all, my host, and
he's getting on in years, and
probably no one has ever paid
much attention to him as he
mumbles on in the fashion of
Nigel Bruce playing Doctor
Watson saying such things as
"Chaucer's is a higher kind of
poetry than Dante's," and"the
difference between the poets is
essentially the difference between
the literatures of Italy and
England."
He's not quite bad enough for

me to lose my patience and walk
out, but he is so opinionated, and
so ill- (and un-) informed, so
bumbling in his articulation and
so pompous in his pronouncing of
solemn platitudes that I swear to
myself a hundred times that I
shall never again return to his
place and that I shall advise my
acquaintances against going there
at all.
There is important work to be
done on Chaucer, work of the sort
exemplified by the remaining
three books in this review.
George Economou's Hie
Goddess Natura in Medieval
Literature (Cambridge, Mass:
Harvard University Press, 1972) is
an important study of one of the
great figures in medieval thought
and literature. Although the main
lines of historical development of
the Goddess Natura are dear
enough, understanding her role in
medieval literature is an
immensely complicated task.
It involves nothing less than a
confrontation with one of the
great paradoxes and unresolved
contradictions in medieval
Christian thought: the role of
sexuality in a fallen world in
which no sexual act — even within
marriage and intended for
procreation — is entirely free from
sin and yet in which sexuality is
essential for the survival of
mankind.
Significance Traced
In Chapter 111 Economou
treats at length the role of Natura
in the writings of those two
fascinating figures from the 12th
century School of Chartres,
Bernard Silvestris and Alan of
Lille. His treatment is balanced
and perceptive throughout, as he
uses the work of other students of
Chartrian thought in developing
his own synthesis.
For me, this is perhaps the
most valuable chapter in the
book. It provides a steady guide
through some of the most
complex philosophical /poetical
texts in the Middle Ages and
further enriches our growing
appreciation of the greatness of
the "Chartrian vision of the
universe."
In Chapter IV, Economou
ventures onto one of the most
bizarre battlefields in the world of
literary criticism — the battlefield
on which critics contest with

passionate intensity the issue of
what the Roman de la Rose is
really all about. He provides
essential background, and by
showing the limitations of Natura
and Genius in the Roman, he
makes it clear that they cannot be
seen as the "definitive expressions
of Jean de Meun's own
philosophy of love."
Overview Needed
Eventually, it seems to me, the
only kind of interpretation of the
Roman on which it will be
reasonable to expect general
agreement will be one that does
not depend on taking any single
figure in the poem as the
spokesman for some
philosophically coherent, single
system of ideas and values.
As Economou states in the
concluding sentence of this
chapter, "In the last analysis, it is
not what any one character in the
poem says that represents the
poet's attitude but the meaning of
the entire poem that indicates his
beliefs," an approach verified by
recent studies of the Roman by
Stanford's Professor William
Calin.
The final chapter treats the last
great poetic appearance of the
Natura tradition in medieval
letters, Chaucer's Parliament of
Foules. There is a great deal in
this chapter to admire, and
Economou provides a stanza by
stanza guide through many of the
complexities of the poem as well
as a thorough examination of the
role of Natura in it.
Even with Economou's clarity
of expression and with
translations of the key Greek,
Latin, and Old French texts, this
is not an easy book, for the issues
it confronts are among the most
complex we find in all of out
intellectual history. Yet until we
confront what Nature meant to
Jean de Meun or to Chaucer, it is
far too easy for us to transfer our
own P os t - P to lemaic ,
Post-Wordsworthian, and
Post-Bergeonian notions to an
intellectual environment in which
they have little applicability.
To understand some of the
most exciting currents in medieval
thought and some of the greatest
works of medieval literature, one
must understand medieval ideas
about Nature. This book would be

a fine place to begin.
Sheila Delaney's Chaucer's
House of Fame: Hie Poetics of
Skeptical Fideism (Chicago:
University of Chicago Press, 1972)
is a think book (122 pages), and it
shows less revision from her
doctoral dissertation than I might
have wished. It is, in spite of its
limitations, a stimulating and
valuable book.
She examines Chaucer's
"House of Fame" in the context
of late medieval philosophy and
succeeds not only in presenting
one of the two or three most
illuminating studies of that vexing
poem to date, but also in
affirming one of the approaches
that will surely mark important
studies in 14th century literature
for years to come.
Delaney demonstrates how
valuable, indeed in this case
essential, it is to see Chaucer
within the intellectual currents of
his own time. Her work would
have been more impressive,
however, had she relied less on
secondary accounts in assessing
the main lines of 14th century
thought.
Delaney writes from a position
of intense political engagement.
Her book shows that a serious
concern with the problems of the
greater community, and even a
commitment to radical solutions
to them, are by no means
impediments to literary
scholarship of high quality.
Politics Interferes
Only in her concluding
sentences does political
commitment begin to interfere
with critical judgment. In viewing
"Chaucer's pluralism, his inability
(or refusal) to commit himself
wholeheartedly to the past or to
the present, his ironic treatment
of intellectual systems," she
concludes: "if the House of Fame
can clarify anything for us it is the
potential sterility of being unable
to choose."
Had the "House of Fame" been
all that Chaucer kit us, one might
well agree. But he went on to
write Troilus and Criseyde and the
Canterbury Tales, avoiding overt
commitment until, perhaps, the
last few lines of the Troilus and
the last gruff words on the last
day of the pilgrimage to
Canterbury as the dour parson
sets the scene for his final sermon

and for Chaucer's final retraction.
If the collected works of
Geoffrey Chaucer can clarify
anything for us along these lines,
it is, for me, the fact that
indecision and doubt and lack of
wholehearted commitment may
be preferable to a blind
commitment at a time when the
world is unable to provide you
with adequate means for making a
choice.
If being unable to choose
produced the Troilus and the
Canterbury Tales — further, if
being unable to choose helped
produce the kind of human being
who wrote the Troilus and the
Canterbury Tales — then I'm
content to live with being unable
to choose.
But this is quibbling over one
small part of an exciting and
clearly important book.
Brilliant Study
With the Publication of Alfred
L. Kellogg's Chaucer, Langland,
Arthur: Essays in Middle English
Literature (New Brunswick, New
Jersey: Rutgers University Press,
1972), we have collected in one
volume some twenty years of
brilliant thinking, careful research,
and charming writing by one of
the world's great students of
medieval English literature.
Most of the articles printed
here have already appeared in
scholarly journals. Among such is
"An Augustinian Interpretation of
Chaucer's Pardoner," to my mind
one of the finest studies of
Chaucer ever written.
The inclusion of some
previously unpublished studies
makes this far more than a
welcome collection of already

known work. Among these is his
delightful and highly imaginative
reconstruction of the amatory
underworld lurking behind the
scenes of Chaucer's "Book of the
Duchess," a reconstruction on
which, as Professor Kellogg says,
"a few facts are occasionally
allowed to intrude."
There is a lesson here that the
authors of at least two of the
books here reviewed need very
much to learn. I know of no word
that Kellogg has ever published
for any reason other than sheer
delight in discovery and joy in
sharing his discoveries with others.
• New Information
His approach is to seek out
new sources of information to
enrich our understanding of
medieval literature and then to
elucidate the texts in question in a
charming and effective style.
When he decides to put a
discovery in print it is because,
one gathers, he believes it to be
original, worthwhile, and correct.
He is rarely, if ever, wrong.
So we have them: eight books
published in the last year or so on
England's greatest narrative poet.
Of the eight perhaps only three or
four emerge as clearly significant,
but I'm inclined to think that it
has been a pretty good year.
If some of the excellent journal
articles that have appeared in
recent months were also included
in this review, it would be even
clearer that Chaucer studies are
thriving. We still have much to
learn about these magnificent
poems and the remarkable human
being who created them.
