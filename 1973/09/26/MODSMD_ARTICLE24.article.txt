# Diamonds—And Democrats—Are A Girl's Best Friends
## 'Enemy' Carol Channing Glitters In 'Lorelei' Role 
### TERRY ANZUR 
SAN FRANCISCO - Carol
Channing's delightful
characterization of Lorelei at the
Curran Theater (thru Oct. 6)
makes it difficult to understand
how she could appear on anyone's
enemies list — even Richard
Nixon's.
At a recent press conference,
Channing admitted that she too is
mystified by her inclusion on the
White House "enemies list." But
she considers it an honor even
though she doesn't view herself as
a political person.
"The extent of my being
Democrat is that the Republicans
never invited me to the White
House," she explains, recalling her
rendition of "Hello Lyndon" at
the Democratic national
convention in 1964, and her
performances at the White House
at the invitation of both
Presidents Kennedy and Johnson.
"I don't really know what Mr.
Nixon has against me," says
Channing. "Maybe the President
doesn't like my singing voice."
Diamonds Make Enemies
Although Channing "wouldn't
think of singing 'Hello Richard' "
at this point in time, she did
attend a luncheon for the first
lady one week before the enemies
list came out.
"During the course of the
afternoon I presented Mrs. Nixon
with my Carol Channing Award —
a diamond," Channing declares.
"But the quality that gives a
diamond value is the quantity of
sentiment attached to it and all I
can conclude is that the President
had the stone appraised."
Whether or not diamonds got
Channing into trouble at the
White House, they are still her
strong suit in fjorclei.
And if her performance in the
less-than-perfect musical revival of
Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is
appraised on the diamond
standard — the quality of
sentiment attached — Channing's
wide-eyed exuberance and
honeyed southern drawl can only
be judged as priceless.
The unreserved enthusiasm she
displays on stage is evident
offstage as she speaks about
Lorelei Lee — the Arkansas
preacher's daugher with an
"attractive gangster element" in
her past who makes good as a
diamond-hungry social-climber in
New York City.

"Lorelei Lee is immortal. She
deserves to be done again from
many different aspects, just like
Lady Macbeth, Liza Doolittle or
Dolly Levi. In this production I
get to play Lorelei at my age and
recall the glorious days of the
Twenties."
Classic Character Recreated
Channing chose to recreate
Lorelei after British actor John
Gielgud told her that Americans
always forget their great
characters, mentioned that Lorelei
was one of them, and suggested
that Channing perform again in
the role that catapulted her to
Broadway stardom in 1949.
Channing discussed the
possibility of presenting the
further adventures of Lorelei Lee
with Jule Styne, who compsoed
the original music. Thus, Lorelei
was built around a new book by
Kenny Solms and Gail Parent,
new lyrics by Betty Comden and
Adolph Green, and new music by
Jule Styne.
In reality, the highlights of the
production are the hit tunes from
Blondes, inimitably performed by
Channing. Her stranglehold on the
Anita Loos character is
demonstrated in the nuances of
her stage presence; an apparent
flirty wink at an admirer in the
balcony, the conspicuous flash of
a diamond as she sings of
"memories that last."
Charming Channing
Nearly a quarter-century after
she first charmed broadway as
Lorelei Lee, Channing is still very
much the wide-eyed ingenue as
she croons, "I'm Just a Little Girl
from Little Rock."
The unforgettable "Diamonds
Are a Girl's Best Friend" brought
down the house, and in closing,
Channing thanked her San
Francisco fans for welcoming her
to her "hometown" so
enthusiastically.
But Channing's stage presence
in Lorelei is reminiscent of a
supernova; it is so brilliant that it
blinds the observer to the fact
that the production as a whole is
merely second-rate.
Part of the problem lies with

the storyline. Awkward
transitions mark the distinction
between the aging Lorelei's
remembrances of the past, and the
actual re-enactment of her
adventures.
Channing opens the show in
widow's weeds. She informs the
audience that her button-king
husband has died, and procedes to
console herself with her diamonds
and her diary by singing "Looking
Back."
Then, without warning, the
curtain rises, and the audience is
whisked back to the 20s for what
is essentially a rehash of the
Gentlemen Prefer Blondes saga.
Matron's Memories '
An occasional freeze in the
action while Lorelei concults her
diary for further details serves as
the only reminder to the observer
that all the goings-on are really in
Lorelei's memory.
Lorelei reappears in mourning
clothes at the conclusion of the
play, she suddenly casts aside the
somber black clothing to reveal a
sparkling flapper costume — an
awkward transition to "Diamonds
Are a Girl's Best Friend."
The basic storyline is par for
the musical comedy course.
Lorelei boards a luxury liner and
discovers that she must make the
trans-Atlantic cruise without her
fiance, button empire heir Gus
Esmond (Peter Palmer).
But Lorelei and travelling
companion Dorothy (Tamara
Long) are a formidable pair. By
the time they arrive in Paris,
Dorothy has fallen in love with
Henry Spofford (Lee Roy
Reams), a member of the U.S.
Olympic Team, who travels with
his liquor-guzzling mother (Dody
Goodman).
Finally, the entire crew decides
that they're homesick, Lorelei is
reunited with Gus, and old Mr.
Esmond is finally persuaded to
forget Lorelei's shady past and
consent to their marriage.
But we've seen all this before in
Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.
Aside from Lorelei's account of
her happy marriage and her

husband's death, wp learn very
little about the further adventures
of Lorelei Lee. And the crippled
script actually prevents
except Channing from unveiling
the full extent of their siage
talents.
As Dorothy, Long's dark,
self-assured beauty provides a
welcome and effective contrast to
Channing's bubbly blondeness. She
proves she can really dance in "I
Love What I'm Doing" but her
limited vocal range proved

disastrous when she attempted
such serious songs as "I Won't Let
You Get Away" and "We're Just a
Kiss Apart."
Palmer, as Lorelei's adoring
fiance, does little but sing and
beam at Channing while she
matter-of-factly steals his moment
of the show.
Goodman, formerly of the Jack
Paar Show, provided some fine
drunk-comic bits, but faded
quickly into the background while
the more spectacular musical

numbers monopolized the
audience's attention.
"I'm Alive, I'm A-Tingle I'm
Aglow" was Brandon Maggart's
only chance to win the audience
over in his protrayal of the zipper
king, who also happens to be a
physical culture nut.
Not surprisingly, Channing's
solo numbers stole the show, and
few of the new songs in the
production managed to catch the
viewer's fancy. Most promising of
the new material is "Men" a

cynical attack on chauvinism
performed by Channing with an
edge that would turn Rosie Casals
green with envy.
Gentlemen may Prefer Blondes,
blondes may prefer diamonds, and
diamonds may be a girl's best
friend — but without doubt, Carol
Channing's talent transcends a
production badly in need of
further refinement if it is ever to
reach the Broadway stage.

SUGAR AND SPICE-In view of rapidly rising food prices it isn't hard to reconcile an expenditure of
$100,000 for Carol Channing's costumes in "Lorelei," a revival of "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes," on stage
at the Curran Theater through Oct. 6. In the musical number "Coquette" she is dressed as a large dessert
and is accompanied by chorus girls in the guises of lobster, caviar, pheasant, and salad.

SUGAR AND SPICE-In view of rapidly rising food prices it isn't hard to reconcile an expenditure of
$100,000 for Carol Channing's costumes in "Lorelei," a revival of "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes," on stage
at the Curran Theater through Oct. 6. In the musical number "Coquette" she is dressed as a large dessert
and is accompanied by chorus girls in the guises of lobster, caviar, pheasant, and salad.

SAN FRANCISCO - Carol
Channing's delightful
characterization of Lorelei at the
Curran Theater (thru Oct. 6)
makes it difficult to understand
how she could appear on anyone's
enemies list — even Richard
Nixon's.
At a recent press conference,
Channing admitted that she too is
mystified by her inclusion on the
White House "enemies list." But
she considers it an honor even
though she doesn't view herself as
a political person.
"The extent of my being
Democrat is that the Republicans
never invited me to the White
House," she explains, recalling her
rendition of "Hello Lyndon" at
the Democratic national
convention in 1964, and her
performances at the White House
at the invitation of both
Presidents Kennedy and Johnson.
"I don't really know what Mr.
Nixon has against me," says
Channing. "Maybe the President
doesn't like my singing voice."
Diamonds Make Enemies
Although Channing "wouldn't
think of singing 'Hello Richard' "
at this point in time, she did
attend a luncheon for the first
lady one week before the enemies
list came out.
"During the course of the
afternoon I presented Mrs. Nixon
with my Carol Channing Award —
a diamond," Channing declares.
"But the quality that gives a
diamond value is the quantity of
sentiment attached to it and all I
can conclude is that the President
had the stone appraised."
Whether or not diamonds got
Channing into trouble at the
White House, they are still her
strong suit in fjorclei.
And if her performance in the
less-than-perfect musical revival of
Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is
appraised on the diamond
standard — the quality of
sentiment attached — Channing's
wide-eyed exuberance and
honeyed southern drawl can only
be judged as priceless.
The unreserved enthusiasm she
displays on stage is evident
offstage as she speaks about
Lorelei Lee — the Arkansas
preacher's daugher with an
"attractive gangster element" in
her past who makes good as a
diamond-hungry social-climber in
New York City.

"Lorelei Lee is immortal. She
deserves to be done again from
many different aspects, just like
Lady Macbeth, Liza Doolittle or
Dolly Levi. In this production I
get to play Lorelei at my age and
recall the glorious days of the
Twenties."
Classic Character Recreated
Channing chose to recreate
Lorelei after British actor John
Gielgud told her that Americans
always forget their great
characters, mentioned that Lorelei
was one of them, and suggested
that Channing perform again in
the role that catapulted her to
Broadway stardom in 1949.
Channing discussed the
possibility of presenting the
further adventures of Lorelei Lee
with Jule Styne, who compsoed
the original music. Thus, Lorelei
was built around a new book by
Kenny Solms and Gail Parent,
new lyrics by Betty Comden and
Adolph Green, and new music by
Jule Styne.
In reality, the highlights of the
production are the hit tunes from
Blondes, inimitably performed by
Channing. Her stranglehold on the
Anita Loos character is
demonstrated in the nuances of
her stage presence; an apparent
flirty wink at an admirer in the
balcony, the conspicuous flash of
a diamond as she sings of
"memories that last."
Charming Channing
Nearly a quarter-century after
she first charmed broadway as
Lorelei Lee, Channing is still very
much the wide-eyed ingenue as
she croons, "I'm Just a Little Girl
from Little Rock."
The unforgettable "Diamonds
Are a Girl's Best Friend" brought
down the house, and in closing,
Channing thanked her San
Francisco fans for welcoming her
to her "hometown" so
enthusiastically.
But Channing's stage presence
in Lorelei is reminiscent of a
supernova; it is so brilliant that it
blinds the observer to the fact
that the production as a whole is
merely second-rate.
Part of the problem lies with

the storyline. Awkward
transitions mark the distinction
between the aging Lorelei's
remembrances of the past, and the
actual re-enactment of her
adventures.
Channing opens the show in
widow's weeds. She informs the
audience that her button-king
husband has died, and procedes to
console herself with her diamonds
and her diary by singing "Looking
Back."
Then, without warning, the
curtain rises, and the audience is
whisked back to the 20s for what
is essentially a rehash of the
Gentlemen Prefer Blondes saga.
Matron's Memories '
An occasional freeze in the
action while Lorelei concults her
diary for further details serves as
the only reminder to the observer
that all the goings-on are really in
Lorelei's memory.
Lorelei reappears in mourning
clothes at the conclusion of the
play, she suddenly casts aside the
somber black clothing to reveal a
sparkling flapper costume — an
awkward transition to "Diamonds
Are a Girl's Best Friend."
The basic storyline is par for
the musical comedy course.
Lorelei boards a luxury liner and
discovers that she must make the
trans-Atlantic cruise without her
fiance, button empire heir Gus
Esmond (Peter Palmer).
But Lorelei and travelling
companion Dorothy (Tamara
Long) are a formidable pair. By
the time they arrive in Paris,
Dorothy has fallen in love with
Henry Spofford (Lee Roy
Reams), a member of the U.S.
Olympic Team, who travels with
his liquor-guzzling mother (Dody
Goodman).
Finally, the entire crew decides
that they're homesick, Lorelei is
reunited with Gus, and old Mr.
Esmond is finally persuaded to
forget Lorelei's shady past and
consent to their marriage.
But we've seen all this before in
Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.
Aside from Lorelei's account of
her happy marriage and her

husband's death, wp learn very
little about the further adventures
of Lorelei Lee. And the crippled
script actually prevents
except Channing from unveiling
the full extent of their siage
talents.
As Dorothy, Long's dark,
self-assured beauty provides a
welcome and effective contrast to
Channing's bubbly blondeness. She
proves she can really dance in "I
Love What I'm Doing" but her
limited vocal range proved

disastrous when she attempted
such serious songs as "I Won't Let
You Get Away" and "We're Just a
Kiss Apart."
Palmer, as Lorelei's adoring
fiance, does little but sing and
beam at Channing while she
matter-of-factly steals his moment
of the show.
Goodman, formerly of the Jack
Paar Show, provided some fine
drunk-comic bits, but faded
quickly into the background while
the more spectacular musical

numbers monopolized the
audience's attention.
"I'm Alive, I'm A-Tingle I'm
Aglow" was Brandon Maggart's
only chance to win the audience
over in his protrayal of the zipper
king, who also happens to be a
physical culture nut.
Not surprisingly, Channing's
solo numbers stole the show, and

SUGAR AND SPICE-In view of rapidly rising food prices it isn't hard to reconcile an expenditure of
$100,000 for Carol Channing's costumes in "Lorelei," a revival of "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes," on stage
at the Curran Theater through Oct. 6. In the musical number "Coquette" she is dressed as a large dessert
and is accompanied by chorus girls in the guises of lobster, caviar, pheasant, and salad.

SAN FRANCISCO - Carol
Channing's delightful
characterization of Lorelei at the
Curran Theater (thru Oct. 6)
makes it difficult to understand
how she could appear on anyone's
enemies list — even Richard
Nixon's.
At a recent press conference,
Channing admitted that she too is
mystified by her inclusion on the
White House "enemies list." But
she considers it an honor even
though she doesn't view herself as
a political person.
"The extent of my being
Democrat is that the Republicans
never invited me to the White
House," she explains, recalling her
rendition of "Hello Lyndon" at
the Democratic national
convention in 1964, and her
performances at the White House
at the invitation of both
Presidents Kennedy and Johnson.
"I don't really know what Mr.
Nixon has against me," says
Channing. "Maybe the President
doesn't like my singing voice."
Diamonds Make Enemies
Although Channing "wouldn't
think of singing 'Hello Richard' "
at this point in time, she did
attend a luncheon for the first
lady one week before the enemies
list came out.
"During the course of the
afternoon I presented Mrs. Nixon
with my Carol Channing Award —
a diamond," Channing declares.
"But the quality that gives a
diamond value is the quantity of
sentiment attached to it and all I
can conclude is that the President
had the stone appraised."
Whether or not diamonds got
Channing into trouble at the
White House, they are still her
strong suit in fjorclei.
And if her performance in the
less-than-perfect musical revival of
Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is
appraised on the diamond
standard — the quality of
sentiment attached — Channing's
wide-eyed exuberance and
honeyed southern drawl can only
be judged as priceless.
The unreserved enthusiasm she
displays on stage is evident
offstage as she speaks about
Lorelei Lee — the Arkansas
preacher's daugher with an
"attractive gangster element" in
her past who makes good as a
diamond-hungry social-climber in
New York City.

"Lorelei Lee is immortal. She
deserves to be done again from
many different aspects, just like
Lady Macbeth, Liza Doolittle or
Dolly Levi. In this production I
get to play Lorelei at my age and
recall the glorious days of the
Twenties."
Classic Character Recreated
Channing chose to recreate
Lorelei after British actor John
Gielgud told her that Americans
always forget their great
characters, mentioned that Lorelei
was one of them, and suggested
that Channing perform again in
the role that catapulted her to
Broadway stardom in 1949.
Channing discussed the
possibility of presenting the
further adventures of Lorelei Lee
with Jule Styne, who compsoed
the original music. Thus, Lorelei
was built around a new book by
Kenny Solms and Gail Parent,
new lyrics by Betty Comden and
Adolph Green, and new music by
Jule Styne.
In reality, the highlights of the
production are the hit tunes from
Blondes, inimitably performed by
Channing. Her stranglehold on the
Anita Loos character is
demonstrated in the nuances of
her stage presence; an apparent
flirty wink at an admirer in the
balcony, the conspicuous flash of
a diamond as she sings of
"memories that last."
Charming Channing
Nearly a quarter-century after
she first charmed broadway as
Lorelei Lee, Channing is still very
much the wide-eyed ingenue as
she croons, "I'm Just a Little Girl
from Little Rock."
The unforgettable "Diamonds
Are a Girl's Best Friend" brought
down the house, and in closing,
Channing thanked her San
Francisco fans for welcoming her
to her "hometown" so
enthusiastically.
But Channing's stage presence
in Lorelei is reminiscent of a
supernova; it is so brilliant that it
blinds the observer to the fact
that the production as a whole is
merely second-rate.
Part of the problem lies with

the storyline. Awkward
transitions mark the distinction
between the aging Lorelei's
remembrances of the past, and the
actual re-enactment of her
adventures.
Channing opens the show in
widow's weeds. She informs the
audience that her button-king
husband has died, and procedes to
console herself with her diamonds
and her diary by singing "Looking
Back."
Then, without warning, the
curtain rises, and the audience is
whisked back to the 20s for what
is essentially a rehash of the
Gentlemen Prefer Blondes saga.
Matron's Memories '
An occasional freeze in the
action while Lorelei concults her
diary for further details serves as
the only reminder to the observer
that all the goings-on are really in
Lorelei's memory.
Lorelei reappears in mourning
clothes at the conclusion of the
play, she suddenly casts aside the
somber black clothing to reveal a
sparkling flapper costume — an
awkward transition to "Diamonds
Are a Girl's Best Friend."
The basic storyline is par for
the musical comedy course.
Lorelei boards a luxury liner and
discovers that she must make the
trans-Atlantic cruise without her
fiance, button empire heir Gus
Esmond (Peter Palmer).
But Lorelei and travelling
companion Dorothy (Tamara
Long) are a formidable pair. By
the time they arrive in Paris,
Dorothy has fallen in love with
Henry Spofford (Lee Roy
Reams), a member of the U.S.
Olympic Team, who travels with
his liquor-guzzling mother (Dody
Goodman).
Finally, the entire crew decides
that they're homesick, Lorelei is
reunited with Gus, and old Mr.
Esmond is finally persuaded to
forget Lorelei's shady past and
consent to their marriage.
But we've seen all this before in
Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.
Aside from Lorelei's account of
her happy marriage and her

husband's death, wp learn very
little about the further adventures
of Lorelei Lee. And the crippled
script actually prevents
except Channing from unveiling
the full extent of their siage
talents.

SUGAR AND SPICE-In view of rapidly rising food prices it isn't hard to reconcile an expenditure of
$100,000 for Carol Channing's costumes in "Lorelei," a revival of "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes," on stage
at the Curran Theater through Oct. 6. In the musical number "Coquette" she is dressed as a large dessert
and is accompanied by chorus girls in the guises of lobster, caviar, pheasant, and salad.

SAN FRANCISCO - Carol
Channing's delightful
characterization of Lorelei at the
Curran Theater (thru Oct. 6)
makes it difficult to understand
how she could appear on anyone's
enemies list — even Richard
Nixon's.
At a recent press conference,
Channing admitted that she too is
mystified by her inclusion on the
White House "enemies list." But
she considers it an honor even
though she doesn't view herself as
a political person.
"The extent of my being
Democrat is that the Republicans
never invited me to the White
House," she explains, recalling her
rendition of "Hello Lyndon" at
the Democratic national
convention in 1964, and her
performances at the White House
at the invitation of both
Presidents Kennedy and Johnson.
"I don't really know what Mr.
Nixon has against me," says
Channing. "Maybe the President
doesn't like my singing voice."
Diamonds Make Enemies
Although Channing "wouldn't
think of singing 'Hello Richard' "
at this point in time, she did
attend a luncheon for the first
lady one week before the enemies
list came out.
"During the course of the
afternoon I presented Mrs. Nixon
with my Carol Channing Award —
a diamond," Channing declares.
"But the quality that gives a
diamond value is the quantity of
sentiment attached to it and all I
can conclude is that the President
had the stone appraised."
Whether or not diamonds got
Channing into trouble at the
White House, they are still her
strong suit in fjorclei.
And if her performance in the
less-than-perfect musical revival of
Gentlemen Prefer Blondes is
appraised on the diamond
standard — the quality of
sentiment attached — Channing's
wide-eyed exuberance and
honeyed southern drawl can only
be judged as priceless.
The unreserved enthusiasm she
displays on stage is evident
offstage as she speaks about
Lorelei Lee — the Arkansas
preacher's daugher with an
"attractive gangster element" in
her past who makes good as a
diamond-hungry social-climber in
New York City.

"Lorelei Lee is immortal. She
deserves to be done again from
many different aspects, just like
Lady Macbeth, Liza Doolittle or
Dolly Levi. In this production I
get to play Lorelei at my age and
recall the glorious days of the
Twenties."
Classic Character Recreated
Channing chose to recreate
Lorelei after British actor John
Gielgud told her that Americans
always forget their great
characters, mentioned that Lorelei
was one of them, and suggested
that Channing perform again in
the role that catapulted her to
Broadway stardom in 1949.
Channing discussed the
possibility of presenting the
further adventures of Lorelei Lee
with Jule Styne, who compsoed
the original music. Thus, Lorelei
was built around a new book by
Kenny Solms and Gail Parent,
new lyrics by Betty Comden and
Adolph Green, and new music by
Jule Styne.
In reality, the highlights of the
production are the hit tunes from
Blondes, inimitably performed by
Channing. Her stranglehold on the
Anita Loos character is
demonstrated in the nuances of
her stage presence; an apparent
flirty wink at an admirer in the
balcony, the conspicuous flash of
a diamond as she sings of
"memories that last."
Charming Channing
Nearly a quarter-century after
she first charmed broadway as
Lorelei Lee, Channing is still very
much the wide-eyed ingenue as
she croons, "I'm Just a Little Girl
from Little Rock."
The unforgettable "Diamonds
Are a Girl's Best Friend" brought
down the house, and in closing,
Channing thanked her San
Francisco fans for welcoming her
to her "hometown" so
enthusiastically.
But Channing's stage presence
in Lorelei is reminiscent of a
supernova; it is so brilliant that it
blinds the observer to the fact
that the production as a whole is
merely second-rate.
Part of the problem lies with

the storyline. Awkward
transitions mark the distinction
between the aging Lorelei's
remembrances of the past, and the
actual re-enactment of her
adventures.
Channing opens the show in
widow's weeds. She informs the
audience that her button-king
husband has died, and procedes to
console herself with her diamonds
and her diary by singing "Looking
Back."
Then, without warning, the
curtain rises, and the audience is
whisked back to the 20s for what
is essentially a rehash of the
Gentlemen Prefer Blondes saga.
Matron's Memories '
An occasional freeze in the
action while Lorelei concults her
diary for further details serves as
the only reminder to the observer
that all the goings-on are really in
Lorelei's memory.
Lorelei reappears in mourning
clothes at the conclusion of the
play, she suddenly casts aside the
somber black clothing to reveal a
sparkling flapper costume — an
awkward transition to "Diamonds
Are a Girl's Best Friend."
The basic storyline is par for
the musical comedy course.
Lorelei boards a luxury liner and
discovers that she must make the
trans-Atlantic cruise without her
fiance, button empire heir Gus
Esmond (Peter Palmer).
But Lorelei and travelling
companion Dorothy (Tamara
Long) are a formidable pair. By
the time they arrive in Paris,
Dorothy has fallen in love with
Henry Spofford (Lee Roy
Reams), a member of the U.S.
Olympic Team, who travels with
