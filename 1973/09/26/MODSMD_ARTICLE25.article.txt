# Coach, Athletes Gain Insights On China Tours
## Kelley Experiences New Eastern Culture The 						Stanford Daily SPORTS 
### STAN WILSON 
Eighteen months ago President
Richard Nixon and Dr. Henry
Kissinger, together with several
hundred enthusiastic newsmen
and diplomats, conducted an
historic trip to the Peoples
Republic of China, a trip which
resulted in the reestablishment of
diplomatic relations between the
two superpowers and was
symbolized by an exchange of
gifts, a pair of Muskoxen to the
Chinese and a gift of giant panda
bears to the Americans.
Last summer America sent its
second wave of ambassadors to
mainland China. This time,
however, the faces were a bit
younger, the contingent a bit
smaller and the fanfare perhaps
just a bit less ostentatious. But the
enthusiasm was still there, and
Stanford's star basketballer Rich
Kelley was among the 40 athletes
and coaches, both men and
women, who hiked to the top of
the Great Wall of China, and
suffered ping pong defeat at the
hands of Chinese school children
in the playgrounds of Peking.
The men's team was a
collection of a dozen All-Stars,
gathered from California to New
York, and chosen by Memphis
State Coach Gene Bartow, who
led his team to the NCAA finals
last year against perennial
champion UCLA. Though the
team had only two weeks to

practice, it easily won all eight of
its games against outmatched
Oiinese All-Star teams.
"If the Chinese came to the
United States they might win a
quarter of their games — probably
less," said Kelley, a junior from
Woodside and Stanford's top
player a year ago. "They wouldn't
believe the rooting that goes on
here," he said. "In the games in
China nobody cheers."

Baskets Everywhere
Chinese incompetence on the
hardwood is not, at any rate, due
to lack of interest. Basketball is
easily the country's most popular
team sport, and it seems as if
everyone plays the game. "There
were baskets set up
everywhere ... even in the
weirdest places," Kelley said.
But the purpose of the trip —
as the Chinese constantly
reminded their guests — was
friendship first, competition
second. "Our coaches wanted us
to entertain them," said the

seven-foot center, and they
accomplished this by stuffing the
basketball, something the Chinese
apparently weren't very proficient
at doing. "The only time they
really got excited was when one
of us dunked," he added, pointing
out that as many as 5,000 people
attended their morning practices
just to witness this spectacle.
The relatively easy competition
resulted in a "hang-loose"

atmosphere, and the players
experienced few problems.
Unfortunately, the coaches didn't
fare so well. "I was really
surprised with how well our whole
team got along," said Kelley.
"The only ones who got homesick
were the coaches. Our head coach,
Bartow, was so homesick it was
unbelieveable ... he just sat in his
room everyday and stared at the
wall."
The atmosphere carried over
into the banquets which were held
in every city the players visited,
and the young dignitaries were
treated to Chinese food and drink,
of which there was always plenty.
"They had a lot of wine and Mao
Tai (a "super-charged brandy") at
the banquets ... you could get
pretty drunk," Kelley said,
pointing out that there would be
as many as fifteen separate toasts
at a banquet.
"There was one time when I'm
pretty sure one player was told by
his coach to try and get us all
drunk. There were five of us at a
table, and he tried to take us all
(xi in a drinking contest. In a half
hour he had to leave the table."
Buckner Reeling
Indiana's Quinn Buckner,
Kelley's roommate for the
three-week affair, ran headlong
into Mao Tai the first night the
group was in China. "He downed
a quick six of those things, and he
was just reeling. But the coaches
didn't get pissed off because they
were half-buzzed themselves, and
everyone knew we were going to
win."
But the trip was not all
basketball, banquets and booze.
Kelley had some time to be on his
own, and he occasionally walked
around the cities by himself. "I
didn't like it too much because
when I'd turn around, there
would be 50 people staring at
me ... they were staring at me so

much that it made me just want
to shrivel up — and I'm used to
getting stared at," explained the
slender seven-footer. "It wasn't
hatred or anything, but they were
just so intensely curious."
The players enjoyed virtually
unlimited travel priveleges. "They
took us just about anywhere we
wanted to go. We could do what
we wanted at night, but there was
just nothing to do. It's
unbelievable — the place just
closes down. There's no such
thing as a nightclub or anything
like that. The only think I ever
saw anyone do at night was just
sitting under a lamp playing
cards."
Occasional shopping tours
found the Americans in Chinese
"Friendship Stores," set up
specifically for tourists. "They
handed out Little Red Books by
the hundreds to us," said Kelley.
He also returned home with an
authentic Chinese ping-pong
paddle (now broken), and a giant
Chinese flag. Teammate Jim
Andrews brought back perhaps
the most unusual souvenir — a
tailor made Chairman Mao suit.
The players also brought back
something a bit less tangible — a
greater understanding of another
culture.
"I think Communism is about
the only way it could be done in

China, with 800 million people to
keep fed. I never saw one person
who looked extremely destitute
or sick. I know that in the United
States if I'd done the same tour I
couldn't have said that. Maybe
they manipulated our tours, but I
got the feeling that they didn't.
"I got a feeling that they were
really together in their spirit — the
reason they were was probably
because of all the propaganda and
everything, but it has worked.
What bothered me was the
regimentation and the closed
mind attitude."
Kelley was able to perceive
significant differences between
the various Chinese cities. "Peking
had a really different personality
than any of the other cities," he
explained. It was so much more
regimented, subdued and dull.
Shanghai and Kantow were much
livelier, and the people were much
friendlier."
Understanding and friendship
were the themes behind the
athletes' trip to China — themes
which overshadowed the
one-sided victories of the talented
American cage team. What did
Kelley leam during his three week
tour? "I learned a lot about the
Chinese way of life — but I sure
didn't learn anything about
basketball from the Chinese," he
said with a grin.
