# Swim Clinics Please Chinese Crowds
## 
### MIKE CHASSON 
For 22 days this summer a
State Department-sponsored
group of swimmers and divers
toured the People's Republic of
China. Among this select group
were Stanford's head swimming
and water polo coach Jim
Gaughran and former Stanford
swimming star Brian Job.
Gaughran was selected by the
State Department to head up the
tour and was given a free hand in
selecting the swimmers and divers.
His selections were based to a
large extent on the fact that each
swimmer and diver had to have
completed his career, since each
faced expulsion from the Amateur
Athletic Union if they travelled to
China. This is due to the fact that
China is not a member of FINA,
the world body that governs
swimming and to which the AAU
belongs.
The trip originated with Henry
Kissinger's talks with the Chinese.
The Chinese and the Americans
discussed mutual visits by athletic
teams and the Chinese requested
that a group of swimmers be sent
to give clincs and demonstrations.
No competition was planned
for the trip. Gaughran would
usually speak to groups of coaches
at each city, while the swimmers
gave demonstrations and
instructed small groups of Chinese
swimmers in stroke techniques.
The first demonstration was on
June 2 in Kwanchow where
12,000 Chinese stood in torrential
monsoon rain to see the
Americans. The instruction
sessions lasted many hours past
the scheduled period of time as
each American helped the Chinese
with his or her stroke. With the
exception of kickboards the hosts
had never seen such aquatic
devices as hand paddles, pull
buoys, pace clocks and
Exergenies.
First Americans
On June 6 the group travelled
to Chansha, a city of 800,000
where they were the first
Americans ever to visit this city.
During the demonstrations there
was a constant flow of Chinese
who would stay 10 or 15 minutes
and then leave to allow others to
watch.
It was in Changsha that the
Chinese people first became
infatuated with the Americans'
act of pulling young swimmers
out of the water after their races.
The Chinese had staged some
races by their young swimmers
and the Americans went to each

of their lanes and pulled them up
to the deck.
The Chinese crowd applauded
this gesture and soon the older
Chinese were pulling the young
swimmers out of the water along
with the Americans.
One of the highlights of the
trip occurred following the
demonstrations in Changsha,
when the group visited Mao Tse
Tung's birthplace in the village of
Shoa Shan. More than 5,000
Chinese daily visit the house in
which Mao was born.
"The long lines of people were
quite surprised when a group of
Americans were ushered to the
front of the long line waiting to
see Mao's birthplace," Gaughran
said. "Most had never seen an
American."
Chairman Mao provided the
impetus for the great Chinese
interest in swimming. Mao stated
that, "Swimming is an exercise in
struggling with the forces of
nature and you should toughen
yourself in big rivers and seas."
Aware of Children
Throughout the visit to China
the group was constantly aware of
the children of China. The tours'
fascination with the children
served as a unifying factor
between the Chinese and the
Americans. The Chinese became
more friendly when they observed
the swimmers talking and
photographying children.
In Shanghai the first
demonstration was observed by
over 4,000 people who jammed
into the swim stadium. They
applauded throughout the
demonstrations. In Shanghai, as in
other parts of China, they were
mobbed everywhere they went by
curious Chinese. Large groups of
people would follow them as they
walked down the streets and went
into stores.
One of the most exciting parts
of the Shanghai trip was the
observation of a lobedectomy
being performed on a male
worker. This involved the removal
of a lung and the only anesthesia
administered was acupuncture.
In Shanghai, there were
Children's Palaces where extensive
programs in sport, the arts, crafts
and technology were offered
children of both sexes from ages
seven to 16. The children were
always kept busy, with little free
time.
The final stop on the tour was
Peking, where the Chinese had
planned a heavy week of

sightseeing and demonstrations.
Visits to the Great Wall and the
Ming Tombs were intermingled
with demonstrations before large
crowds.
At the opening demonstration
in Peking the Head of the United
States Liasion Office, David
Bruce, as well as the head of the
All China Sports Federation, Mr.
Wang Meng, watched as the
demonstration and clinic was
shown throughout Peking on
television. Two days later the
group gave its final demonstration
before 7,500 people.
Madame Mao
On what was supposed to be
the final evening of the trip,
Madame Chiang Ching, Chairman
Mao's wife, appeared at a
reception prior to the start of a
basketball game between the
United States and China. She
invited the swimmers to stay an
extra day to see her favorite
opera.
"Ambassador Bruce advised us
that this was considered a
command performance and was a
great honor, so we had no choice
but to stay an additional day,"
Gaughran said.
At the basketball reception she
personally congratulated each
the swimmers and divers. For the
first time since 1949 she appeared
in Western clothes and her
appearance with the Americans
was televised throughout China.
Before leaving for China,
Gaughran had expected the worst
in the way of swimming facilities.
"I told the kids to expect the
worst, that they might end up
swimming in irrigation ditches,"
he explained.
The group was surprised when
they saw the large number of
pools and that most were
50-meters long, had excellent
diving facilities and large amounts
of seating.
Impressive Complex
In Peking they discovered one
of the finest swimming complexes
in the world. It consisted of three
50-meter pools and a diving well
with seating for 7700. The pools
had ten lanes and permanent
concerete starting platforms.
Gaughran noted that swimming
in China is about two or three
years behind the rest of the world
due to the fact that no
competition or training took place
from 1969 to 1971 because of the
Cultural Revoltuion.
There has been little
international competition since

the nation dropped out of FINA
in 1957. They did compete on a
limited basis against five other
countries who belong to FINA,
but those teams remain a secret to
protect them from punishment.
Gaughran said this about some
of the young swimmers: "Their
stroke techniques looked very
good. I didn't expect this. I didn't
expect them to be as advanced.
"Some of the senior swimmers
are quite outstanding. They swim
well. .. they have lots of
potential .. . they have good
flotation so they have all of the
tools necessary to be good
swimmers. They need the kind of
competition that has made our
country so good."
Gaughran was most impressed
with the people of China. They
were friendly and warm. "They
were not thinking of waging war
as many Americans would like to
believe," stated Gaughran. "The
people were working together
everywhere we went to make
China great."
