# Pro Prognosis
## What Did It All Prove? 
### Don Tollefson 
EDITOR'S NOTE — "Pro Prognosis," a column
analyzing current happenings in professional sports,
will appear every Wednesday in the Daily sports
section. Author Don Tollefson is a former sports
editor and editor-in-chief of the Daily. He is
currently working as the Daily's advertising manager
and as a sports stringer for the San Francisco
Chronicle.
It finally happened. After months of betting,
baiting and belittling, "Sugar Daddy" Riggs, the
year-old hustler extraordinaire, finally had his tennis
ball vollied down his throat by Billie Jean King last
Thursday night in the air-conditioned splendor of
the Houston Astrodome.
Hie tennis match that even truckdrivers could
appreciate turned out to be almost as one-sided as
some of the polarized commentary 50 million
viewers were subjected to on ABC. But what did it
all prove?
Before the match, almost everyone had an
opinion as to what the impact of a King or Riggs
victory would be. Opinions ranged from diehard
women's activists who felt a King victory would be
a symbolic castration for all American males, to
card-carrying male chauvinist pigs, who felt sure a
Riggs win would keep women in the kitchen and
bedroom for years to come.
Hopefully, something worthwhile will outlive the
rhetoric which surrounded this athletic "Battle of
the Sexes." Hopefully, most of the 50 million
people who witnessed the event will realize that
women's athletics and women athletes have been
afforded far too little attention for a long time in
this - country. And perhaps many viewers will
experience an attitude change towards women
which goes beyond sports alone.
But if any of this occurs, it will be in spite of
King's fellow pro Rosemary Casals, who made a
complete and unadulterated fool of herself on
national television. Unfortunately, Casals may have
very well done more than enough to offset any gains
for women's athletics or the women's movement
which might have come out of King's victory.
'Simple-Minded Rhetoric'
Casals provided a steady stream of the kind of
humorless, pig-headed, simple-minded rhetoric
which put so many people to sleep during anti-war
rallies of the late 60s and early 70s. Casals turned
her howitzer on Riggs from the moment she
appeared on camera and never slowed up all night.
And whether you like him or not, Bobby Riggs was
more successful as a men's tennis player than Rosie
Casals could be as a women's tennis player, even if
she was reincarnated three times.
Casals was paid to add analysis and not the kind
of banal banter any junior high student would be
proud of. From the sound of things, you might have
thought Casals was the last woman on earth
protecting herself from a band of mad rapists.
Casals' commentary would have annoyed me
considerably anyway, but when I consider that it
may very well have neutralized most of the impact
of King's victory, it is absolutely outrageous.
Unfortunately, the rest of the ABC production
wasn't much better. ABC bowed to a threat from
King, who said she wouldn't play if Jack Kramer
was in the announcing team, and replaced Kramer
with a tennis also-ran named Gene Scott. Scott had

little chance of being offensive since his comments
were mostly monosyllabic or at best, something less
than lucid.
Humble Howard
Casals and Scott were joined by the inimitable
Howard Cosell, who tried to make up for his lack of
tennis knowledge with worse-than-ever inflated
language and Frank Gifford, who spent most of his
time sticking microphones in the faces of assorted
celebrities in the crowd.
Gifford spent a large part of his time searching
for and pointing out "attractive" women spectators
in the worst sexist tradition which annoys me as
much as I am sure it annoys King and Casals. And as
a group, the announcing team often talked about
the match in a way that I am sure many viewers
uninitiated in tennis parlance found a bit confusing.
Even the camera work was uninspiring for a
match of this magnitude. Creative uses of slow
motion and instant replay and ingenious camera
angles were sadly underused in the coverage of the
King-Riggs match.
The impact this undeprecedented tennis circus
will have on the game itself should be fairly major.
Millions of viewers who had never or rarely ever
picked up a racket before will undoubtedly join the
ranks of a sport which has already increased its
popularity immensely in recent years. And because
the match was a little slower-paced than most of the
ace-dominated pro tennis usually seen on television,
many weekend volleyers may have had their spirits
lifted considerably.
Relative Merits
But what this match didn't need to prove was the
relative merits of men's tennis and women's tennis.
The fact that the top star of women's tennis easily
disposed of a decaying former Wimbledon champion
means little if anything in that respect. Anyone who
claims that any woman player could win a series of
five matches against Stan Smith or Rod Laveris
almost as naive as someone who thinks that there is
a woman in the world who could last five rounds
against George Foreman or Joe Frazier. But that
isn't the point.
Women's tennis should not be judged relative to
men's tennis. It should be judged on its own merits
as nothing less than a very exciting and entertaining
sport which features thousands of talented athletes,
who happen to be women. I for one, find most
women's tennis matches infinitely more entertaining
and exciting than the usual men's match, and I am
sure I am not alone in this regard.
Until this society begins to realize that women
athletes are not overgrown tomboys suffering from
acute cases of penis envy, this will still be a
discriminatory society. But equal treatment for
women athletes must go hand in hand with equal
treatment for women doctors, lawyers and teachers
and women in every other profession or
occupational field.
Until the majority of people in this society
believe that all women have a right to be more than
cooks, mothers and bottlewashers, we will continue
to be an unfulfilled society which wastes
irreplaceable human resources. I feel this long
overdue and long awaited equality is coming ever
closer and I only hope that King's victory expedites
matters, in spite of Rosemary Casals.

EDITOR'S NOTE — "Pro Prognosis," a column
analyzing current happenings in professional sports,
will appear every Wednesday in the Daily sports
section. Author Don Tollefson is a former sports
editor and editor-in-chief of the Daily. He is
currently working as the Daily's advertising manager
and as a sports stringer for the San Francisco
Chronicle.
It finally happened. After months of betting,
baiting and belittling, "Sugar Daddy" Riggs, the
year-old hustler extraordinaire, finally had his tennis
ball vollied down his throat by Billie Jean King last
Thursday night in the air-conditioned splendor of
the Houston Astrodome.
Hie tennis match that even truckdrivers could
appreciate turned out to be almost as one-sided as
some of the polarized commentary 50 million
viewers were subjected to on ABC. But what did it
all prove?
Before the match, almost everyone had an
opinion as to what the impact of a King or Riggs
victory would be. Opinions ranged from diehard
women's activists who felt a King victory would be
a symbolic castration for all American males, to
card-carrying male chauvinist pigs, who felt sure a
Riggs win would keep women in the kitchen and
bedroom for years to come.
Hopefully, something worthwhile will outlive the
rhetoric which surrounded this athletic "Battle of
the Sexes." Hopefully, most of the 50 million
people who witnessed the event will realize that
women's athletics and women athletes have been
afforded far too little attention for a long time in
this - country. And perhaps many viewers will
experience an attitude change towards women
which goes beyond sports alone.
But if any of this occurs, it will be in spite of
King's fellow pro Rosemary Casals, who made a
complete and unadulterated fool of herself on
national television. Unfortunately, Casals may have
very well done more than enough to offset any gains
for women's athletics or the women's movement
which might have come out of King's victory.
'Simple-Minded Rhetoric'
Casals provided a steady stream of the kind of
humorless, pig-headed, simple-minded rhetoric
which put so many people to sleep during anti-war
rallies of the late 60s and early 70s. Casals turned
her howitzer on Riggs from the moment she
appeared on camera and never slowed up all night.
And whether you like him or not, Bobby Riggs was
more successful as a men's tennis player than Rosie
Casals could be as a women's tennis player, even if
she was reincarnated three times.
Casals was paid to add analysis and not the kind
of banal banter any junior high student would be
proud of. From the sound of things, you might have
thought Casals was the last woman on earth
protecting herself from a band of mad rapists.
Casals' commentary would have annoyed me
considerably anyway, but when I consider that it
may very well have neutralized most of the impact
of King's victory, it is absolutely outrageous.
Unfortunately, the rest of the ABC production
wasn't much better. ABC bowed to a threat from
King, who said she wouldn't play if Jack Kramer
was in the announcing team, and replaced Kramer
with a tennis also-ran named Gene Scott. Scott had

little chance of being offensive since his comments
were mostly monosyllabic or at best, something less
than lucid.
Humble Howard
Casals and Scott were joined by the inimitable
Howard Cosell, who tried to make up for his lack of
tennis knowledge with worse-than-ever inflated
language and Frank Gifford, who spent most of his
time sticking microphones in the faces of assorted
celebrities in the crowd.
Gifford spent a large part of his time searching
for and pointing out "attractive" women spectators
in the worst sexist tradition which annoys me as
much as I am sure it annoys King and Casals. And as
a group, the announcing team often talked about
the match in a way that I am sure many viewers
uninitiated in tennis parlance found a bit confusing.
Even the camera work was uninspiring for a
match of this magnitude. Creative uses of slow
motion and instant replay and ingenious camera
angles were sadly underused in the coverage of the
King-Riggs match.
The impact this undeprecedented tennis circus
will have on the game itself should be fairly major.
Millions of viewers who had never or rarely ever
picked up a racket before will undoubtedly join the
ranks of a sport which has already increased its
popularity immensely in recent years. And because
the match was a little slower-paced than most of the
ace-dominated pro tennis usually seen on television,
many weekend volleyers may have had their spirits
lifted considerably.
Relative Merits
But what this match didn't need to prove was the
relative merits of men's tennis and women's tennis.
The fact that the top star of women's tennis easily
disposed of a decaying former Wimbledon champion
means little if anything in that respect. Anyone who
claims that any woman player could win a series of
five matches against Stan Smith or Rod Laveris
almost as naive as someone who thinks that there is
a woman in the world who could last five rounds
against George Foreman or Joe Frazier. But that
isn't the point.
Women's tennis should not be judged relative to
men's tennis. It should be judged on its own merits
as nothing less than a very exciting and entertaining
sport which features thousands of talented athletes,
who happen to be women. I for one, find most
women's tennis matches infinitely more entertaining
and exciting than the usual men's match, and I am
sure I am not alone in this regard.
Until this society begins to realize that women
athletes are not overgrown tomboys suffering from
acute cases of penis envy, this will still be a
discriminatory society. But equal treatment for
women athletes must go hand in hand with equal
treatment for women doctors, lawyers and teachers
and women in every other profession or
occupational field.
Until the majority of people in this society
believe that all women have a right to be more than
cooks, mothers and bottlewashers, we will continue
to be an unfulfilled society which wastes
irreplaceable human resources. I feel this long
overdue and long awaited equality is coming ever
closer and I only hope that King's victory expedites
matters, in spite of Rosemary Casals.

EDITOR'S NOTE — "Pro Prognosis," a column
analyzing current happenings in professional sports,
will appear every Wednesday in the Daily sports
section. Author Don Tollefson is a former sports
editor and editor-in-chief of the Daily. He is
currently working as the Daily's advertising manager
and as a sports stringer for the San Francisco
Chronicle.
It finally happened. After months of betting,
baiting and belittling, "Sugar Daddy" Riggs, the
year-old hustler extraordinaire, finally had his tennis
ball vollied down his throat by Billie Jean King last
Thursday night in the air-conditioned splendor of
the Houston Astrodome.
Hie tennis match that even truckdrivers could
appreciate turned out to be almost as one-sided as
some of the polarized commentary 50 million
viewers were subjected to on ABC. But what did it
all prove?
Before the match, almost everyone had an
opinion as to what the impact of a King or Riggs
victory would be. Opinions ranged from diehard
women's activists who felt a King victory would be
a symbolic castration for all American males, to
card-carrying male chauvinist pigs, who felt sure a
Riggs win would keep women in the kitchen and
bedroom for years to come.
Hopefully, something worthwhile will outlive the
rhetoric which surrounded this athletic "Battle of
the Sexes." Hopefully, most of the 50 million
people who witnessed the event will realize that
women's athletics and women athletes have been
afforded far too little attention for a long time in
this - country. And perhaps many viewers will
experience an attitude change towards women
which goes beyond sports alone.
But if any of this occurs, it will be in spite of
King's fellow pro Rosemary Casals, who made a
complete and unadulterated fool of herself on
national television. Unfortunately, Casals may have
very well done more than enough to offset any gains
for women's athletics or the women's movement
which might have come out of King's victory.
'Simple-Minded Rhetoric'
Casals provided a steady stream of the kind of
humorless, pig-headed, simple-minded rhetoric
which put so many people to sleep during anti-war
rallies of the late 60s and early 70s. Casals turned
her howitzer on Riggs from the moment she
appeared on camera and never slowed up all night.
And whether you like him or not, Bobby Riggs was
more successful as a men's tennis player than Rosie
Casals could be as a women's tennis player, even if
she was reincarnated three times.
Casals was paid to add analysis and not the kind
of banal banter any junior high student would be
proud of. From the sound of things, you might have
thought Casals was the last woman on earth
protecting herself from a band of mad rapists.
Casals' commentary would have annoyed me
considerably anyway, but when I consider that it
may very well have neutralized most of the impact
of King's victory, it is absolutely outrageous.
Unfortunately, the rest of the ABC production
wasn't much better. ABC bowed to a threat from
King, who said she wouldn't play if Jack Kramer
was in the announcing team, and replaced Kramer
with a tennis also-ran named Gene Scott. Scott had

little chance of being offensive since his comments
were mostly monosyllabic or at best, something less
than lucid.
Humble Howard
Casals and Scott were joined by the inimitable
Howard Cosell, who tried to make up for his lack of
tennis knowledge with worse-than-ever inflated
language and Frank Gifford, who spent most of his
time sticking microphones in the faces of assorted
celebrities in the crowd.
Gifford spent a large part of his time searching
for and pointing out "attractive" women spectators
in the worst sexist tradition which annoys me as
much as I am sure it annoys King and Casals. And as
a group, the announcing team often talked about
the match in a way that I am sure many viewers
uninitiated in tennis parlance found a bit confusing.
Even the camera work was uninspiring for a
match of this magnitude. Creative uses of slow
motion and instant replay and ingenious camera
angles were sadly underused in the coverage of the
King-Riggs match.
The impact this undeprecedented tennis circus
will have on the game itself should be fairly major.
Millions of viewers who had never or rarely ever
picked up a racket before will undoubtedly join the
ranks of a sport which has already increased its
popularity immensely in recent years. And because
the match was a little slower-paced than most of the
ace-dominated pro tennis usually seen on television,
many weekend volleyers may have had their spirits
lifted considerably.
Relative Merits
But what this match didn't need to prove was the
relative merits of men's tennis and women's tennis.
The fact that the top star of women's tennis easily
disposed of a decaying former Wimbledon champion
means little if anything in that respect. Anyone who
claims that any woman player could win a series of
five matches against Stan Smith or Rod Laveris
almost as naive as someone who thinks that there is
a woman in the world who could last five rounds
against George Foreman or Joe Frazier. But that
isn't the point.
Women's tennis should not be judged relative to
men's tennis. It should be judged on its own merits
as nothing less than a very exciting and entertaining
sport which features thousands of talented athletes,
who happen to be women. I for one, find most
women's tennis matches infinitely more entertaining
and exciting than the usual men's match, and I am
sure I am not alone in this regard.
Until this society begins to realize that women
athletes are not overgrown tomboys suffering from
acute cases of penis envy, this will still be a
discriminatory society. But equal treatment for
women athletes must go hand in hand with equal
treatment for women doctors, lawyers and teachers
and women in every other profession or
occupational field.
Until the majority of people in this society
believe that all women have a right to be more than
cooks, mothers and bottlewashers, we will continue
to be an unfulfilled society which wastes
irreplaceable human resources. I feel this long
overdue and long awaited equality is coming ever
closer and I only hope that King's victory expedites
matters, in spite of Rosemary Casals.
