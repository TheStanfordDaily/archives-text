# Coaches Cynical, Skeptical About Card-Spartan Battle
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Stanford's Jack Christiansen
was cynical and San Jose State's
Darryl Rogers' skeptical yesterday
at the Northern California
Football Writer's luncheon.
"We've figured out a way to
keep the other team's yardage
down," Christiansen said while
analyzing last week's dismal
Cardinal performance against
Michigan. "We kept giving them
the ball in our own territory so
they didn't have to go very far to
score."
Rogers, meanwhile, doubted if
his Spartans would be able to
compete with the Cards Saturday
when the two teams continue a
30-game rivalry at Stanford
Stadium. "There's no question
that Stanford is a tremendous
opponent for San Jose," he said.
"We'll definitely be outhorsed —
I've got a 190 pound tight end to
block Stillwell and I don't think
he's shown up at school since I
told him."
Stanford is currently 0-2 and
San Jose State 3-0 but that fact

didn't seem to matter to Rogers.
"I don't think San Jose is in the
same class as Penn State or
Michigan," Rogers said. "Stanford
is just going to be a very
formidable opponent — greater
than any team any member of our
coaching staff has ever come up
against."
Christiansen was obviously
relieved not to be thinking about
seemingly futile game plans for
nationally ranked teams like Penn
State and Michigan. "I'd like to
think that we're back on equal
terms," Chris said of the Cards'
next two games against San Jose
and Illinois, "but we've still got a
tough job ahead this week.
Hopefully playing two quality
opponents has helped our team."
Christiansen indicated that
Stanford will run the option a
little more and dismissed any
thoughts of moving John
Winesberry from running back to
flanker. "Winesberry won't be
going outside," Chris said. "He's
still being bothered by his broken
hand and it's easier to hand the
ball to him than throw it."
The Northern California
players of the week were San Jose
State split end Ike Mcßee, a
freshman who caught seven passes
for 111 yards Saturday against
Long Beach State, and California
linebacker Ivan Weiss, who made
11 unassisted tackles, intercepted
a pass and recovered a fumble
against Illinois.

Quarterback Mike Boryla,
quoted in the current issue of
Sports Illustrated as blasting
Christiansen's game plan, told
Christiansen and Sports
Information Director Bob Murphy
that he didn't say anything of the
sort.
The Sports Illustrated
quotation read: "Three things
beat us — the Penn State defense,
the way I played, and our game
plan. Can you believe they told us
to run up the middle and to use
roll-out passes? Those are the two
things we can't do. The coaches
decided that everything we
normally could do, we would not
be able to do against Penn State.
So here I have Winesberry, a 9.7
sprinter, and all I can do is run
him up the middle."
None of the writers at
yesterday's luncheon could
remember any Boryla comments
which even faintly resembled the
Sports Illustrated "quote."
