# Skylab 2 Astronauts Return From Historic Space Trip
## 
### 
ABOARD USS NEW ORLEANS
(AP) — The men of Skylab 2 returned
to earth yesterday from history's
longest space mission, a 59V2-day
odyssey of science.
Officials said astronauts Alan L.
Bean, Jack R. Lousma and Owen K.
Garriott appeared "in excellent
condition" after splashing down in the
Pacific Ocean to complete a space
voyage of more than 24 million miles.
The spacemen guided their partially
crippled Apollo command ship to a
3:20 p.m. PDT landing in a sea laced
with whitecaps 225 miles southwest of
San Diego, Calif.
WOW
"Man, that was a spectacular
entry," said Lousma through a special
communications hookup after the
spacecraft was on the water. "I like
the bang when the main chutes came
out. Golly. I'd like to do it again."
All three astronauts were able to
climb out of their spacecraft after it
was lifted onto the deck of this prime
recovery ship.
They walked to chairs on a nearby
platform with unsteady, hesitant gaits,
but smiled and waved at sailors

crowded nearby for a look at
America's newest space heroes.
Good Shape
Doctors had warned that they
could suffer from dizziness and
possible nausea because oi their long
exposure to the weightlessness of
space. But the three men, other than
an unsteady walk, appeared healthy, in
better shape than the Skylab men that
ended a 28-day mission June 22.
Each man donned a baseball-style
cap as they left the spacecraft. They
also wore air-inflated suits that helped
their hearts, weakened by the long
space mission, to pump blood through
their legs.
Bean, Garriott and Lousma
remained in the chairs on the platform
as a forklift transported them 50 feet
to a medical laboratory. They were
helped inside the lab where doctors
immediately began long physical
examinations.
The splashdown came 3V2 hours
after the astronauts boarded their
Apollo command ship and left the
Skylab space station that had been
their home since Julv 28.
"We undocked on time and we're

moving away," said Bean as the Apollo
craft moved free of the large space
station at 12:50 PDT.
"Seems like we're leaving home,"
said Lousma.
"It's a beautiful sight," Bean said of
the Skylab space station. He said there
were red, gold, yellow and blue lights
shining on it and the big craft "looks
like a Christmas tree. We see stars in
the background."
The reentry was complicated when
the astronauts were forced to fly the
Apollo command ship by using tricky,
makeshift procedures never tried
before. Two of four steering rockets
on the spaceship were disabled and the
astronauts used new techniques for
guiding the craft.
Bean said the Apollo spacecraft
worked well with only two steering
rockets.
Smooth Flight
"It flies real smooth," he said,
"better than I expected."
In the orbit just before splashdown,
the astronauts passed over a Pacific
Ocean storm, Hurricane Irah, and
Lousma said he could see the circular
cloud pattern.
"It has a very definite buildup in
what appears to be the center," he
said. "It looks like a mountain."
The astronauts landed well north of
the storm, but it was affecting the
weather in the splashdown area. Waves
were six to eight feet and the wind was
a brisk 22 miles per hour.
Problem
The return to earth went smoothly
despite a communications failure
which prevented the astronauts from
hearing radio calls from Mission
Control after their spacecraft was
descending via parachute.

HOME AGAIN — Skylab 2 astronauts returned to earth yesterday, concluding history's longest manned space mission.
They are Owen Garriott, science pilot; Alan Bean, commander; and Jack Lousma, pilot.
Bean, Garriott and Lousma, unable
to hear Mission Control, radioed "in
the blind" that they were feeling fine.
Their microphone stuck and, unknown
to them, their conversations were
broadcast to the carrier.
They talked of "feeling heavy" as
their bodies reacted to their return to
earth's gravity.
"Why is this book so heavy?" one
asked.
Lighter
"I feel lighter than when we first
landed," Lousma said at one point.
"But my feet feel kind of heavy."
Bean and Lousma also talked
excitedly of the fireball their
spacecraft created as it smashed into
the atmosphere at a high speed.
"You should have seen the swirl in
that fireball," said Lousma.
"Yeah," said Bean, "it was so
bright I couldn't read" some of the
spacecraft instruments.
All three of the men could be heard
laughing happily as they waited for the
USS New Orleans to pull alongside.
TTiey had landed on target but six
miles from this recovery carrier.
Garriott is an electrical engineering
professor here, specializing in
electromagnetic theory and
ionospheric physics. He has been on
leave from the University a nee he
began training for the mission.
Garriott holds both Master's and Ph.D.
degrees in electrical engineering from
Stanford.
