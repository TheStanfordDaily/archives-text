High Officials Directed Hunt Actions
WASHINGTON — Watergate conspirator E. Howard
Hunt concluded two days of Senate testimony with a
declaration yesterday that he acted "with the knowledge
and approval and under the direction of high officials of
the government.
"Accordingly," he said of the Watergate and Ellsberg
break-ins, "I was engaged in lawful acts."
His eight-hour appearance before the Senate Watergate
committee was delayed once in the afternoon so the
obviously worn Hunt could rest briefly.
Hunt acknowledged he was responsible for one group
of Cuban-Americans he recruited thinking it acted legally
when it helped in the Watergate break-in and another such
group believing the same when it broke into the office of
Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist.
Sen. Lowell P. Weicher Jr., R-Conn., asked Hunt who
should be quizzed to determine whether Hunt, in turn,
had himself acted reasonably in believing the two
break-ins were legal as he followed orders to help plan and
execute them.
Former presidential aide John D. Ehrlichman and
former White House aide Egil Bud Krogh, said Hunt in
reference to the Ellsberg break-in.
For the Watergate break-in, he named former Atty.
Gen. John N. Mitchell, former White House counsel John
W. Dean 111, former Nixon deputy campaign chief Jeb S.
Magruder, convicted Watergate conspirator G. Gordon
Liddy, and "perhaps" former White House special counsel
Charles W. Colson.
Hunt finished up his day of mostly fine-point
testimony by saying: "I regret my participation but I do
not think it justifies my conviction or the punishment
which has been imposed upon me."
Boyle Near Death - Suicide Attempt?
WASHINGTON — Former United Mine Workers boss
W.A. "Tony" Boyle lay near death yesterday after a
suspected suicide attempt within hours of a scheduled
court appearance on murder conspiracy charges.
Dr. Milton Gusack, said blood drawn from the
comatose Boyle showed large amounts of sodium amytal,
a strong barbituate, and that chances for survival were
poor.
Boyle was rushed to the intensive care unit of the
George Washington University Medical Center Monday
night. Hospital spokesman said they thought at first that
he had suffered a stroke.
But Gusack told newsmen at midaftemoon that "It was
an apparent effort at self-destruction."
The deposed UMW president had been scheduled to
appear yesterday before a U.S. magistrate for removal to
Pennsylvania to face state murder charges in the 1969
slaying of insurgent union leader Joseph A. "Jock"
Yablonski and Yablonski's wife and daughter.
Arabs Boycott Kissinger Lunch
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. - A boycott by five states
undercut Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger's bid
yesterday for conciliation with the Arab world. But he

made a sizable advance on contacts with European
nations.
Iraq, Syria, Libya, Algeria and South Yemen sent their
regrets and in a gesture against U.S. Mideast policy passed
up a luncheon given by Kissinger at the U.S. mission
across the street from the United Nations.
All five boycotters have supported the Palestinian
position against recognition of Israel. Libya has an
additional quarrel with the United States: Its objections
to the presence of the U.S. 6th Fleet in the
Mediterranean.
However, 13 other Arab diplomats and a representative
of the Arab League showed up for the lunch and joined
the new secretary, a Jew, in a toast to peace and
friendship.
The snub marred a busy day of diplomacy for
Kissinger, topped by an agreement with the European
Common market countries to meet within a week to begin
formulation of new declarations on economic and
political cooperation.
The session, possibly in Washington, may point the way
to a trip to Europe by President Nixon for signing by the
end of the year.
Schultz Says Dollar Will Strengthen
NAIROBI, Kenya — U.S. Treasury Secretary George P.
Shultz told the world's financial leaders yesterday that the
dollar will strengthen and the American balance of
payments will move into the black next year.
Finance ministers and central bankers attending the
joint annual meeting here of the International Monetary
Fund and World Bank welcomed the forecast, saying it
brightened chances of monetary reform.
If Shultz's prediction pans out it will mean the first
surplus in the U.S. basic balance of payments since 1964.
The basic balance of payments, including trade and
long-term investments, is one of three key yardsticks for
measuring the outflow of dollars from the United States.
It is the measurement most closely watched by
economists, since it tends to show longer-term trends.
The postwar international monetary system collapsed
two years ago after years of heavy U.S. payments deficits
pumped billions of dollars into Western Europe and
Japan, eroding the value of the U.S. currency. Shultz'
prediction would signal a reversal of that trend.
Shultz said America's trade balance, in deficit for two
years in a row, also would show a surplus next year. That
means Americans will export more than they import.
Travel Or Die
LONDON — Claire Puzey has been chosen "Miss British
Rail Commuter 1973." The 4-year-old girl must travel 600
miles a week or die.
Claire has no kidneys and makes a 200-mile round trip
three times a week from her home in rural Hampshire to
be treated on a kidney machine at Guy's Hospital in
London.

High Officials Directed Hunt Actions
WASHINGTON — Watergate conspirator E. Howard
Hunt concluded two days of Senate testimony with a
declaration yesterday that he acted "with the knowledge
and approval and under the direction of high officials of
the government.
"Accordingly," he said of the Watergate and Ellsberg
break-ins, "I was engaged in lawful acts."
His eight-hour appearance before the Senate Watergate
committee was delayed once in the afternoon so the
obviously worn Hunt could rest briefly.
Hunt acknowledged he was responsible for one group
of Cuban-Americans he recruited thinking it acted legally
when it helped in the Watergate break-in and another such
group believing the same when it broke into the office of
Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist.
Sen. Lowell P. Weicher Jr., R-Conn., asked Hunt who
should be quizzed to determine whether Hunt, in turn,
had himself acted reasonably in believing the two
break-ins were legal as he followed orders to help plan and
execute them.
Former presidential aide John D. Ehrlichman and
former White House aide Egil Bud Krogh, said Hunt in
reference to the Ellsberg break-in.
For the Watergate break-in, he named former Atty.
Gen. John N. Mitchell, former White House counsel John
W. Dean 111, former Nixon deputy campaign chief Jeb S.
Magruder, convicted Watergate conspirator G. Gordon
Liddy, and "perhaps" former White House special counsel
Charles W. Colson.
Hunt finished up his day of mostly fine-point
testimony by saying: "I regret my participation but I do
not think it justifies my conviction or the punishment
which has been imposed upon me."
Boyle Near Death - Suicide Attempt?
WASHINGTON — Former United Mine Workers boss
W.A. "Tony" Boyle lay near death yesterday after a
suspected suicide attempt within hours of a scheduled
court appearance on murder conspiracy charges.
Dr. Milton Gusack, said blood drawn from the
comatose Boyle showed large amounts of sodium amytal,
a strong barbituate, and that chances for survival were
poor.
Boyle was rushed to the intensive care unit of the
George Washington University Medical Center Monday
night. Hospital spokesman said they thought at first that
he had suffered a stroke.
But Gusack told newsmen at midaftemoon that "It was
an apparent effort at self-destruction."
The deposed UMW president had been scheduled to
appear yesterday before a U.S. magistrate for removal to
Pennsylvania to face state murder charges in the 1969
slaying of insurgent union leader Joseph A. "Jock"
Yablonski and Yablonski's wife and daughter.
Arabs Boycott Kissinger Lunch
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. - A boycott by five states
undercut Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger's bid
yesterday for conciliation with the Arab world. But he

made a sizable advance on contacts with European
nations.
Iraq, Syria, Libya, Algeria and South Yemen sent their
regrets and in a gesture against U.S. Mideast policy passed
up a luncheon given by Kissinger at the U.S. mission
across the street from the United Nations.
All five boycotters have supported the Palestinian
position against recognition of Israel. Libya has an
additional quarrel with the United States: Its objections
to the presence of the U.S. 6th Fleet in the
Mediterranean.
However, 13 other Arab diplomats and a representative
of the Arab League showed up for the lunch and joined
the new secretary, a Jew, in a toast to peace and
friendship.
The snub marred a busy day of diplomacy for
Kissinger, topped by an agreement with the European
Common market countries to meet within a week to begin
formulation of new declarations on economic and
political cooperation.
The session, possibly in Washington, may point the way
to a trip to Europe by President Nixon for signing by the
end of the year.
Schultz Says Dollar Will Strengthen
NAIROBI, Kenya — U.S. Treasury Secretary George P.
Shultz told the world's financial leaders yesterday that the
dollar will strengthen and the American balance of
payments will move into the black next year.
Finance ministers and central bankers attending the
joint annual meeting here of the International Monetary
Fund and World Bank welcomed the forecast, saying it
brightened chances of monetary reform.
If Shultz's prediction pans out it will mean the first
surplus in the U.S. basic balance of payments since 1964.
The basic balance of payments, including trade and
long-term investments, is one of three key yardsticks for
measuring the outflow of dollars from the United States.
It is the measurement most closely watched by
economists, since it tends to show longer-term trends.
The postwar international monetary system collapsed
two years ago after years of heavy U.S. payments deficits
pumped billions of dollars into Western Europe and
Japan, eroding the value of the U.S. currency. Shultz'
prediction would signal a reversal of that trend.
Shultz said America's trade balance, in deficit for two
years in a row, also would show a surplus next year. That
means Americans will export more than they import.

pumped billions of dollars into Western Europe and
Japan, eroding the value of the U.S. currency. Shultz'
prediction would signal a reversal of that trend.
Shultz said America's trade balance, in deficit for two
years in a row, also would show a surplus next year. That
means Americans will export more than they import.

High Officials Directed Hunt Actions
WASHINGTON — Watergate conspirator E. Howard
Hunt concluded two days of Senate testimony with a
declaration yesterday that he acted "with the knowledge
and approval and under the direction of high officials of
the government.
"Accordingly," he said of the Watergate and Ellsberg
break-ins, "I was engaged in lawful acts."
His eight-hour appearance before the Senate Watergate
committee was delayed once in the afternoon so the
obviously worn Hunt could rest briefly.
Hunt acknowledged he was responsible for one group
of Cuban-Americans he recruited thinking it acted legally
when it helped in the Watergate break-in and another such
group believing the same when it broke into the office of
Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist.
Sen. Lowell P. Weicher Jr., R-Conn., asked Hunt who
should be quizzed to determine whether Hunt, in turn,
had himself acted reasonably in believing the two
break-ins were legal as he followed orders to help plan and
execute them.
Former presidential aide John D. Ehrlichman and
former White House aide Egil Bud Krogh, said Hunt in
reference to the Ellsberg break-in.
For the Watergate break-in, he named former Atty.
Gen. John N. Mitchell, former White House counsel John
W. Dean 111, former Nixon deputy campaign chief Jeb S.
Magruder, convicted Watergate conspirator G. Gordon
Liddy, and "perhaps" former White House special counsel
Charles W. Colson.
Hunt finished up his day of mostly fine-point
testimony by saying: "I regret my participation but I do
not think it justifies my conviction or the punishment
which has been imposed upon me."
Boyle Near Death - Suicide Attempt?
WASHINGTON — Former United Mine Workers boss
W.A. "Tony" Boyle lay near death yesterday after a
suspected suicide attempt within hours of a scheduled
court appearance on murder conspiracy charges.
Dr. Milton Gusack, said blood drawn from the
comatose Boyle showed large amounts of sodium amytal,
a strong barbituate, and that chances for survival were
poor.
Boyle was rushed to the intensive care unit of the
George Washington University Medical Center Monday
night. Hospital spokesman said they thought at first that
he had suffered a stroke.
But Gusack told newsmen at midaftemoon that "It was
an apparent effort at self-destruction."
The deposed UMW president had been scheduled to
appear yesterday before a U.S. magistrate for removal to
Pennsylvania to face state murder charges in the 1969
slaying of insurgent union leader Joseph A. "Jock"
Yablonski and Yablonski's wife and daughter.
Arabs Boycott Kissinger Lunch
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. - A boycott by five states
undercut Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger's bid
yesterday for conciliation with the Arab world. But he

made a sizable advance on contacts with European
nations.
Iraq, Syria, Libya, Algeria and South Yemen sent their
regrets and in a gesture against U.S. Mideast policy passed
up a luncheon given by Kissinger at the U.S. mission
across the street from the United Nations.
All five boycotters have supported the Palestinian
position against recognition of Israel. Libya has an
additional quarrel with the United States: Its objections
to the presence of the U.S. 6th Fleet in the
Mediterranean.
However, 13 other Arab diplomats and a representative
of the Arab League showed up for the lunch and joined
the new secretary, a Jew, in a toast to peace and
friendship.
The snub marred a busy day of diplomacy for
Kissinger, topped by an agreement with the European
Common market countries to meet within a week to begin
formulation of new declarations on economic and
political cooperation.
The session, possibly in Washington, may point the way
to a trip to Europe by President Nixon for signing by the
end of the year.
Schultz Says Dollar Will Strengthen
NAIROBI, Kenya — U.S. Treasury Secretary George P.
Shultz told the world's financial leaders yesterday that the
dollar will strengthen and the American balance of
payments will move into the black next year.
Finance ministers and central bankers attending the
joint annual meeting here of the International Monetary
Fund and World Bank welcomed the forecast, saying it
brightened chances of monetary reform.
If Shultz's prediction pans out it will mean the first
surplus in the U.S. basic balance of payments since 1964.
The basic balance of payments, including trade and
long-term investments, is one of three key yardsticks for
measuring the outflow of dollars from the United States.
It is the measurement most closely watched by
economists, since it tends to show longer-term trends.
