# Cold Spell May Bring Cutbacks

"If we have a winter like the last,
PG&E [Pacific Gas and Electric
Company] will cut off our natural gas,
and we'll be running around turning
off steam in non-essential buildings.
But what 'non-essential' is will be
difficult to determine," W. Lloyd
Gallagher, the University utilities
manager, said yesterday.
Gallagher anticipates that a limit on
use of natural gas to heat most of the

campus will be accompanied by
rationing of electrical power. Although
energy costs have sharply increased,
this is the first year that power cuts
are imminent.
In an unusual cold spell last
December, PG&E withheld natural gas
from the University for three days.
During that time, fuel oil obtained
from a San Jose distributor
circumvented the power cut. However,
the University can only obtain a
week's supply of fuel oil at a time, and
PG&E has already warned of more
severe natural gas cut-backs.
Supplies Diminishing
According to Gallagher, natural gas
from Canad and El Paso, Texas is
diminishing due to both political
pressure and increased demand. PG&E
raised natural gas prices 15 percent
this year, and a minimum eight
percent increase is expected next year.
In turn, the price of fuel oil jumped
50 percent this year, induced by the
demand for low-sulfur oils, which are
now required by anti-smog legislation
of several states.
Because of the bind for organic
fuels, PG&E faces the same problem
when it generates electricity. Under
Public Utilities Commission rules for
natural gas rationing, PG&E must shut
down its electrical generators as an
initial conservation measure. Industrial
users face cut-offs for more severe
circumstances. Because of the pinch,
PG&E raised electricity rates 12
percent this year.
Less Auto Fuel
Gallagher doesn't expect a gasoline
shortage for University vehicles, but
increased prices from Standard Oil (the
University's distributor) will still force
careful budgeting of this fuel source.
Even if the winter is mild, Plant
Services intends to reduce university
power consumption. "We're going to
ask students and staff to think of ways
to save energy. Turning off lights when
not needed for security or safety will
help. At Plant Services, office lights go
out at lunchtime," Gallagher said.
Heating Schedule
"We want people to turn down their
radiators at night and managers from
the older dorms will be asked to assist
in coordinating a heating schedule."
Thermostats will probably be set
lower this year, and in the case of
severe rationing, heating in the dorms
may be limited to 7-9 a.m. and 5-10
p.m.
"Get to like cooler showers. Try to

get in and out quicker than last year.
Study more during the daytime and
keep your electric blankets off at
night," Gallagher suggested.
Water prices have also increased
over the year, and a new state tax on
water obtained from wells will add to
costs. Gallagher expects prices of most
utilities to increase at least eight
percent in cost by next year, and
PG&E has informed the University
that it expects matters to get worse
before they get better. "They tell us to
have standby oil when they shut off
our gas, but we can't get oil,"
Gallagher said. "It's like a cat chasing
its tail."
