# Foothill Station Predicts More Interference
## KZSU Power Increase Approval Delayed 
### PETER ALESHIRE 
The application of campus radio
station KZSU for a power boost from
10 to 500 watts — pending before the
Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) — has been indefinitely delayed
by the opposition of KFJC, a 10 watt
station at nearby Foothill Junior
College.
The KZSU application has become
entangled in a debate over how much
the boosted KZSU signal will
interefere with the weaker KFJC signal
in the Palo Alto area. The
disagreement has sparked legal
maneuvering and some bad feeling
between the two student stations.
KZSU originally applied for a boost
to 3000 watts after approval of a
$39,000 fee assessment for spring
quarter 1972. About $22,000 from

those funds were to be used for the
power increase and conversion to
stereo.
The application was rejected that
summer because the boosted KZSU
would have interfered with the signal
of a San Francisco station, KCMA.
KZSU then reapplied for the boost
to 500 watts in January, 1973. The
application was reviewed and accepted
for consideration by the FCC on April
7, 1973.
Objection
This summer KFJC filed an
objection to the power increase,
claiming a stronger KZSU signal would
block out the KFJC signal in areas of
Palo Alto, Menlo Park and Atherton.
KJFC also cited an FCC ruling that
transmitters for commercial stations
must be located at least 15 miles apart
while the KZSU and KFJC
transmitters are only about nine miles
apart.
KZSU responded through
University lawyers with a reply to the
objections sent to the FCC on Sept. 7.
The situation is complicated by the
special status of 10 watt stations. The
FCC is not as concerned with such
items as meter reading, consistency of
power output and certification of
personnel in these small stations as it is
in the big commercial stations.
"The FCC makes certain
assumptions about 10 watt stations,"
said Lloyd Snook, station manager of
KZSU. "One of the assumptions they
make is that all 10 watt stations are
only 100 feet above the average height
of the terrain in their receiving areas."
However, says Snook, the KZSU
transmitter is actually 13 feet below
average terrain due to the foothills
west of the KZSU area. KFJC's
transmitter on Black Mountain is 1800
feet above average terrain.
Interference
The 10 watt KFJC signal thus
covers a much greater area than the 10
watt KZSU signal and this causes the
signals of the two stations to interfere
with each other.
Snook said that when KZSU first
began FM operations in 1964, when
KFJC moved to Black Mountain in
1968 and when KZSU moved its
transmitter to a higher location in

1970, the FCC operated on the 100
feet above average terrain assumption
to determine if there would be any
interference.
"What we're saying is that the
Commission should continue to use its
assumed figures and therefore give us
the approval. What they would in fact
be doing otherwise would be giving
KFJC a power boost without going
through the process," said Snook.
"There will in fact be some
interference. There is some now. But
no one can say how much there will
be. Our point is that KFJC has no legal
right to gripe.
"In the Palo Alto area there would
be intereference with people with very
bad radios. But people with good
radios could still receive KFJC. We will
be strong enough so they can't
interefere with us but we can interfere
with them. Now they interfere with us
as a matter of fact," said Snook.
"The reason we went for the power
increase was that some 50 percent of
all Stanford students live more than
three and a quarter miles away from
campus. Fifty percent of the faculty
and staff live more than four and a
half miles from campus. Our
transmitter is located about a mile
west of campus in the foothills.
Lack Of Coverage
"With a six mile signal radius this
means there is a significant part of the
Stanford community we're not
reaching," said Snook.
He said the power increase will
increase the signal radius to 12 miles
and increase the area of coverage four
times.
KFJC Program Director Ted Brooks
commented, 'The only reason we filed
the objection is that we think they're
going to move into our coverage. We're
worried about Palo Alto, Menlo Park,
and Atherton, where we really come in
strong and they might cut us off.
"We don't think the FCC should
approve the application because as our
license is set up we don't really show
how far our signal transmits. But since
we're on Black Mountain we broadcast
a lot farther than we should," said
Brooks.
"I myself don't care too much. It's
too bad that we have such a terrible

working relationship.
KZSU has already purchased a
$7000 transmitter in anticipation of
the power boost which also allows
them to broadcast in stereo. "The
assumption is that we'll someday get a
power boost at some level," said
Snook.

in the Palo Alto area. The
disagreement has sparked legal
maneuvering and some bad feeling
between the two student stations.
KZSU originally applied for a boost
to 3000 watts after approval of a
$39,000 fee assessment for spring
quarter 1972. About $22,000 from

those funds were to be used for the
power increase and conversion to
stereo.
The application was rejected that
summer because the boosted KZSU
would have interfered with the signal
of a San Francisco station, KCMA.
KZSU then reapplied for the boost
to 500 watts in January, 1973. The
application was reviewed and accepted
for consideration by the FCC on April
7, 1973.
Objection
This summer KFJC filed an
objection to the power increase,
claiming a stronger KZSU signal would
block out the KFJC signal in areas of
Palo Alto, Menlo Park and Atherton.
KJFC also cited an FCC ruling that
transmitters for commercial stations
must be located at least 15 miles apart
while the KZSU and KFJC
transmitters are only about nine miles
apart.
KZSU responded through
University lawyers with a reply to the
objections sent to the FCC on Sept. 7.
The situation is complicated by the
special status of 10 watt stations. The
FCC is not as concerned with such
items as meter reading, consistency of
power output and certification of
personnel in these small stations as it is
in the big commercial stations.
"The FCC makes certain
assumptions about 10 watt stations,"
said Lloyd Snook, station manager of
KZSU. "One of the assumptions they
make is that all 10 watt stations are
only 100 feet above the average height
of the terrain in their receiving areas."
However, says Snook, the KZSU
transmitter is actually 13 feet below
average terrain due to the foothills
west of the KZSU area. KFJC's
transmitter on Black Mountain is 1800
feet above average terrain.
Interference
The 10 watt KFJC signal thus
covers a much greater area than the 10
watt KZSU signal and this causes the
signals of the two stations to interfere
with each other.
Snook said that when KZSU first
began FM operations in 1964, when
KFJC moved to Black Mountain in
1968 and when KZSU moved its
transmitter to a higher location in

1970, the FCC operated on the 100
feet above average terrain assumption
to determine if there would be any
interference.
"What we're saying is that the
Commission should continue to use its
assumed figures and therefore give us
the approval. What they would in fact
be doing otherwise would be giving
KFJC a power boost without going
through the process," said Snook.
"There will in fact be some
interference. There is some now. But
no one can say how much there will
be. Our point is that KFJC has no legal
right to gripe.
"In the Palo Alto area there would
be intereference with people with very
bad radios. But people with good
radios could still receive KFJC. We will
be strong enough so they can't
interefere with us but we can interfere
with them. Now they interfere with us
as a matter of fact," said Snook.
"The reason we went for the power
increase was that some 50 percent of
all Stanford students live more than
three and a quarter miles away from
campus. Fifty percent of the faculty
and staff live more than four and a
half miles from campus. Our
transmitter is located about a mile
west of campus in the foothills.
Lack Of Coverage
"With a six mile signal radius this
means there is a significant part of the
Stanford community we're not
reaching," said Snook.
He said the power increase will
increase the signal radius to 12 miles
and increase the area of coverage four
times.
KFJC Program Director Ted Brooks
commented, 'The only reason we filed
the objection is that we think they're
going to move into our coverage. We're
worried about Palo Alto, Menlo Park,
and Atherton, where we really come in
strong and they might cut us off.
"We don't think the FCC should
approve the application because as our
license is set up we don't really show
how far our signal transmits. But since
we're on Black Mountain we broadcast
a lot farther than we should," said
Brooks.
"I myself don't care too much. It's
too bad that we have such a terrible

working relationship.
KZSU has already purchased a
$7000 transmitter in anticipation of
the power boost which also allows
them to broadcast in stereo. "The
assumption is that we'll someday get a
power boost at some level," said
Snook.
The application of campus radio
station KZSU for a power boost from
10 to 500 watts — pending before the
Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) — has been indefinitely delayed
by the opposition of KFJC, a 10 watt
station at nearby Foothill Junior
College.
The KZSU application has become
entangled in a debate over how much
the boosted KZSU signal will
interefere with the weaker KFJC signal
in the Palo Alto area. The
disagreement has sparked legal

would have interfered with the signal
of a San Francisco station, KCMA.
KZSU then reapplied for the boost
to 500 watts in January, 1973. The
application was reviewed and accepted
for consideration by the FCC on April
7, 1973.
Objection
This summer KFJC filed an
objection to the power increase,
claiming a stronger KZSU signal would
block out the KFJC signal in areas of
Palo Alto, Menlo Park and Atherton.
KJFC also cited an FCC ruling that
transmitters for commercial stations
must be located at least 15 miles apart
while the KZSU and KFJC
transmitters are only about nine miles
apart.
KZSU responded through
University lawyers with a reply to the
objections sent to the FCC on Sept. 7.
The situation is complicated by the
special status of 10 watt stations. The
FCC is not as concerned with such
items as meter reading, consistency of
power output and certification of
personnel in these small stations as it is
in the big commercial stations.
"The FCC makes certain
assumptions about 10 watt stations,"
said Lloyd Snook, station manager of
KZSU. "One of the assumptions they
make is that all 10 watt stations are
only 100 feet above the average height
of the terrain in their receiving areas."
However, says Snook, the KZSU
transmitter is actually 13 feet below
average terrain due to the foothills
west of the KZSU area. KFJC's
transmitter on Black Mountain is 1800
feet above average terrain.
Interference
The 10 watt KFJC signal thus
covers a much greater area than the 10
watt KZSU signal and this causes the
signals of the two stations to interfere
with each other.
Snook said that when KZSU first
began FM operations in 1964, when
KFJC moved to Black Mountain in
1968 and when KZSU moved its
transmitter to a higher location in

1970, the FCC operated on the 100
feet above average terrain assumption
to determine if there would be any
interference.
"What we're saying is that the
Commission should continue to use its
assumed figures and therefore give us
the approval. What they would in fact
be doing otherwise would be giving
KFJC a power boost without going
through the process," said Snook.
"There will in fact be some
interference. There is some now. But
no one can say how much there will
be. Our point is that KFJC has no legal
right to gripe.
"In the Palo Alto area there would
be intereference with people with very
bad radios. But people with good
radios could still receive KFJC. We will
be strong enough so they can't
interefere with us but we can interfere
with them. Now they interfere with us
as a matter of fact," said Snook.
"The reason we went for the power
increase was that some 50 percent of
all Stanford students live more than
three and a quarter miles away from
campus. Fifty percent of the faculty
and staff live more than four and a
half miles from campus. Our
transmitter is located about a mile
west of campus in the foothills.
Lack Of Coverage
"With a six mile signal radius this
means there is a significant part of the
Stanford community we're not
reaching," said Snook.
He said the power increase will
increase the signal radius to 12 miles
and increase the area of coverage four
times.
KFJC Program Director Ted Brooks
commented, 'The only reason we filed
the objection is that we think they're
going to move into our coverage. We're
worried about Palo Alto, Menlo Park,
and Atherton, where we really come in
strong and they might cut us off.
"We don't think the FCC should
approve the application because as our
license is set up we don't really show
how far our signal transmits. But since
we're on Black Mountain we broadcast
a lot farther than we should," said
Brooks.
"I myself don't care too much. It's
too bad that we have such a terrible

working relationship.
KZSU has already purchased a
$7000 transmitter in anticipation of
the power boost which also allows
them to broadcast in stereo. "The
assumption is that we'll someday get a
power boost at some level," said
Snook.
The application of campus radio
station KZSU for a power boost from
10 to 500 watts — pending before the
Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) — has been indefinitely delayed
by the opposition of KFJC, a 10 watt
station at nearby Foothill Junior
College.
The KZSU application has become
entangled in a debate over how much
the boosted KZSU signal will
interefere with the weaker KFJC signal
in the Palo Alto area. The
disagreement has sparked legal
maneuvering and some bad feeling
between the two student stations.
KZSU originally applied for a boost
to 3000 watts after approval of a
$39,000 fee assessment for spring
quarter 1972. About $22,000 from

those funds were to be used for the
power increase and conversion to
stereo.
The application was rejected that
summer because the boosted KZSU
would have interfered with the signal
of a San Francisco station, KCMA.
KZSU then reapplied for the boost
to 500 watts in January, 1973. The
