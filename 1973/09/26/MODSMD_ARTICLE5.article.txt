# Overseas Studies Offers More Options To Students

### BOB LOWE 
Overseas Studies Director Mark
Mancall, whose title was recently
changed from director of overseas
campuses, says he feels the new
designation "is a better reflection of
what we want to do. The reason why
we changed the title is because we
want to develop a variety of different
kinds of programs. The campus is only
one kind."
Mancall says he wants to institute
more "varied and serious" academic
programs at the foreign study centers.
As an example, Mancall cited a
program which will enable students to
stay overseas "for the length of time
necessary for the thing they want to
do overseas."
New Options
Currently, the programs of study
are organized in two-quarter sessions.
The new program would enable a
student to stay for less or more than
two quarters and have an academic
program fitted to his interest and
length of stay.
Pre-medicine and other
science-oriented undergraduates are
now discouraged from attending the
study centers because of the absence
of science courses. Mancall plans to
soon "include science components" in
the overseas program so these students
won't be prohibited from going
overseas due to insufficient course
offerings.
Intensive Language
Mancall, a history professor who
was appointed director in April, said
the program is experimenting with an
intensive language class in the Italy

program.
The program, it's hoped, will enable
those in the fall-winter group, having
two quarters of Italian to refine their
language speaking abilities and become
more involved in the life and culture
of Florence.
The students in the program will
have three hours of language study
each day, five days a week, for the
first month. Results will help
determine the feasibility of similar
classes at the other study centers.
The Overseas Studies program has
also agreed to ship tapes back and
forth from the study centers for KZSU
in an attempt to promote interest in
the program. Broadcasts will keep
students here informed of the news
and events happening at the study
centers.
Vienna Campus Closed
In recent years, falling enrollment
has plagued the program. Last spring,
as a result, some language
requirements were dropped and the
Vienna, Austria campus was closed.
Mancall said the more intensive
programs would not discourage
students wanting travel.
"I think they [now] have less
mobility than they should have,
paradoxically, because the way the
programs are now, they have to choose
between studying and traveling. One
of the things I'm working on is how to
organize the calendar so there are
significant blocs of time for study and
other significant blocs of time for
traveling. You might study for three
weeks intensively and take a week to
travel." he said.
