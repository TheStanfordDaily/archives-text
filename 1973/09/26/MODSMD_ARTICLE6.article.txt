# Executive Privilege
## Who Really Rules America? 
### 
(Continued from yesterday, this is
the second half of a two-part
series.)
"No executive official or
agency can be given
absolute authority to
determine what documents
in his possession may he
considered by the court in
its task. Otherwise the head
of an executive department
would have the power on
his own say so to cover up
all evidence of fraud and
corruption when a federal
court or grand jury was
investigating malfeasance in
office and this is not the
law."
Chief Judge David Bazelon
In support of his "Tapes
decision Chief Judge John J.
Sirica cited the Nuclear
Committee case in his decision,
and one wonders if he too did not
pause in reading the preceding
language, for judiciously hidden in
the footnotes to his decision lies
what might appear to some as an
almost vicious tongue-in-cheek
barb directed at Nixon. Sirica
quotes Reynolds saying that
"judicial control over the evidence
in a case cannot be abdicated to
the caprice of executive officers,"
and then in footnoting this quote
Sirica writes:
"The Court intends no
suggestions that Respondent
[Nixon] could not be trusted as
his own judge in matters of
privilege, but it would hesitate to
set a precedent in contravention
of basic constitutional principles
that might permit or encourage
some future high executive officer
to become a despot."
The King of England
Despite the weight of
precedent holding that the
executive must in some situations,
surrender materials to the courts
for inspection, one nagging
question persists: "Is the
President somehow different from
the rest of the executive?"
Chief Justice Marshall didn't

think so, and said as much in the
treason trial of Aaron Burr in
1807, in which Marshall directed a
subpoena to President Jefferson
(which was ignored).
Marshall held that the laws of
evidence are binding upon all, no
matter what office the individual
in question may hold:
"The single reservation
alluded to is the case of the
king. Although he may,
perhaps, give testimony, it is
said to be incompatible with
his dignity to appear under
the process of the court.. ..
It is a principle of the
English constitution that
the King can do no wrong,
that no blame can be
imputed to him.... By the
Constitution of the U.S. the
President, as well as any
other official of the
government, may be
impeached...
In a doubly bizzare stroke of
seemingly fated irony, Sirica
chose to cite in support of his
"Tapes" decision, his own prior
ruling in the "Watergate 7 Trial"
(G. Gordon Liddy, et alv. U.S.,
354 F. Supp. 208 -1972 ). In that
case Sirica held two Los Angeles
Times newsreporters in contempt
of court for refusing to obey a
grand jury subpoena. The
reporters, authors of a four-part
article series entitled "Inside
Accounts of the Watergate
Bugging," were jailed.
Sirica ruled that newsmen have
no privilege exempting them from
obeying a grand jury subpoena.
And by citing this ruling in
support of his "Tapes" decision,
he places both the President and
the press in the same boat, no
doubt to the mutual distaste of
these strange bedfellows.
In 1878 a grand jury sought
instruction from a federal district
court judge Judge Gresham. The
grand jury told him that the
President of the United States
(Rutherford B. Hayes—Rep.) had
personally instructed them not to

James Lobsenz

indict a certain party for
embezzlement in a case under
investigation by the grand jury.
"Should they heed his words?"
they asked.
"No," said the good judge. He
informed them that aside from
exercising his pardoning power,
the President "in no way has the
slightest authority to control your
action." And then in words that
will hopefully nqt prove
prophetic, the Court said:
"ITie moment the executive is
allowed to control the action of
the courts in the administration of
criminal justice, their
independence is gone."

law clerk for the Connecticut
firm, Zeldes, Needle and Cooper.)

In a doubly bizzare stroke of
seemingly fated irony, Sirica
chose to cite in support of his
"Tapes" decision, his own prior
ruling in the "Watergate 7 Trial"
(G. Gordon Liddy, et alv. U.S.,
354 F. Supp. 208 -1972 ). In that
case Sirica held two Los Angeles
Times newsreporters in contempt
of court for refusing to obey a
grand jury subpoena. The
reporters, authors of a four-part
article series entitled "Inside
Accounts of the Watergate
Bugging," were jailed.
Sirica ruled that newsmen have
no privilege exempting them from
obeying a grand jury subpoena.
And by citing this ruling in
support of his "Tapes" decision,
he places both the President and
the press in the same boat, no
doubt to the mutual distaste of
these strange bedfellows.
In 1878 a grand jury sought
instruction from a federal district
court judge Judge Gresham. The
grand jury told him that the
President of the United States
(Rutherford B. Hayes—Rep.) had
personally instructed them not to

James Lobsenz

indict a certain party for
embezzlement in a case under
investigation by the grand jury.
"Should they heed his words?"
they asked.
"No," said the good judge. He
informed them that aside from
exercising his pardoning power,
the President "in no way has the
slightest authority to control your
action." And then in words that
will hopefully nqt prove
prophetic, the Court said:
"ITie moment the executive is
allowed to control the action of
the courts in the administration of
criminal justice, their
independence is gone."
(James Lobsenz, Daily staffer, is a
law clerk for the Connecticut
firm, Zeldes, Needle and Cooper.)
(Continued from yesterday, this is

"No executive official or
agency can be given
absolute authority to
determine what documents
in his possession may he
considered by the court in
its task. Otherwise the head
of an executive department
would have the power on
his own say so to cover up
all evidence of fraud and
corruption when a federal
court or grand jury was
investigating malfeasance in
office and this is not the
law."
Chief Judge David Bazelon
In support of his "Tapes
decision Chief Judge John J.
Sirica cited the Nuclear
Committee case in his decision,
and one wonders if he too did not
pause in reading the preceding
language, for judiciously hidden in
the footnotes to his decision lies
what might appear to some as an
almost vicious tongue-in-cheek
barb directed at Nixon. Sirica
quotes Reynolds saying that
"judicial control over the evidence
in a case cannot be abdicated to
the caprice of executive officers,"
and then in footnoting this quote
Sirica writes:
"The Court intends no
suggestions that Respondent
[Nixon] could not be trusted as
his own judge in matters of
privilege, but it would hesitate to
set a precedent in contravention
of basic constitutional principles
that might permit or encourage
some future high executive officer
to become a despot."
The King of England
Despite the weight of
precedent holding that the
executive must in some situations,
surrender materials to the courts
for inspection, one nagging
question persists: "Is the
President somehow different from
the rest of the executive?"
Chief Justice Marshall didn't

think so, and said as much in the
treason trial of Aaron Burr in
1807, in which Marshall directed a
subpoena to President Jefferson
(which was ignored).
Marshall held that the laws of
evidence are binding upon all, no
matter what office the individual
in question may hold:
