# The 						Lighter Side:
## Party Time Is Here Again...

coc Jerry Coleman

Good morning and welcome
back to Stanford, gang! You've all
been admitted here because you
can count up to 1052: those of
you on scholarships line up to the
left; you others can park your
lincolns on the right.
Where do I stand? you ask. I
work my way through college, sir,
and am proud of it! Why, I do
odd jobs down here at the Daily
office — sweeping, polishing
chairs, cleaning the lint out of the
AP teletype machine.
Sometimes around 11 p.m.
they let me pick up the pizza
wrappers and pop tops off the
floor; I even get to keep these
nice, shiny treasures as a reward
for my hard work.
But I'm not always in the
office, though: I work the streets,
selling Dailies dorm to dorm.
Four years now, and I've built up
a clientele certain that their dimes
are getting them the cheapest
Dailies on campus. They're happy,
and so am I: dimes are nice and
shiny too.
So much for me. And don't
wait for me to ask about you. I
tried that last year, remember?
"Send me your funny
experiences, send me your tired
and huddled masses yearning to
be free, send ..." And what did I
get for all my trouble?
I got three letters: one telling
me a great story about a vegetable
grocer I could interview if only he

hadn't died two months before;
the second, a lengthy manuscript
from a student who now has a
column of his own and probably
curses himself for wasting the
postage; and the third from a
women working somewhere on
the University staff, who offered
me generous praise, but when I
called her extension to thank her,
could not remember my name.
So save your letters to the
Daily for really important issues,
such as how late the DU's kept
Storey awake last night, and what
the political and religious
significance is of the Dollies'
wearing red tops but white boots.
You'll be too busy to write
anyway, what with bills to pay,
books to buy, checks to cash,
out-of-stock books to reorder, and
trips to Telegraph Avenue (Cal
Books, Berkeley Books, Textbook
Exchange... ).
Have fun: I had mine in
Michigan with the Band. (I went
there to see how right those
Mastercharge ads are about
"Anywhere in America You're
Going, We'll Be There." By the
time my dad gets next month's
bill, I'll be in San Juan!)
Being on a road trip with the
Band in a strange eastern town is
an experience that will live with
me all my days. And you might
just like to leam what happened
since it's YOUR money that
helped make it possible.

We drove 57 hours straight to
Ann Arbor — stopping only when
a tire on one of the rented vans
lost its tread in the Nevada desert,
and when we discovered that only
five gas stations were open in Salt
Lake City after 10:00 p.m. and
four were out of gas.
Two hours of sleep in as many
days and what do we do when we
arrive? Party! A local pizza and
beer joint called the Brown Jug
may never forget the Stanford
Band.
Finding the drinking age to be
18, the Bandsmen ordered an
unending stream of pitchers and
proceeded to Zoom, Schwartz,
and Profigliano themselves into
inebriation. (Those last three
Albanian words are the name of
an arcane drinking game and Band
Puberty Rite.)
Then we went to bed, right?
No, some red-hots sang their own
version of the Michigan fight song
to numerous campus sororities.
Speaking of sororities, the five
dollies were sequestered in Alpha
Gamma Delta for the week, and
invited me and two fellow Theta
Xi-Bandsmen over for a late
evening snack. To the average
Stanford male familiar with
coeducational living, the following
will sound extreme.
We males waited outside while
the girls asked their hosts for our
permission to enter. As potential
defilers of sacred womanhood and
soilers of the elite, we were finally
admitted only under the proviso
that we keep our voices down and
our bodies downstairs.
At that point, I seriously
considered donning a gorilla suit
and pounding on the keys of the
baby grand piano with dead
mackeral to protest our
treatment. But it was only later,
as we helped the Gamma Delta
Dollies with the dishes, that we
learned a rush party in progress
upstairs had been responsible for
our limited welcome. Party over,
the girls really opened up; we even
got to chat with the House
Mother!
TTie following day, Michigan
Band Director George Cavender
welcomed us and praised our
"esprit de corps." To his own
band he stated, "Crudeness,
vulgarity, obscenity in music
always goes hand in hand with
immaturity: the signs of a
sophomoric intellect ' I
Did he mean us? Judge for
yourself Saturday when you see
our half-time show. I've got to
sign off now, so until then,
remember: never accept candy
from strangers!
