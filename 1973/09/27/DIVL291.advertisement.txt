1 BSR 710 or 810.
Either way you'll
get the shaft.
The BSR 810 and 710 have their brains in
their shaft. A carefully machined metal rod
holding eight precision-molded cams. When
the cam shaft turns, the cams make things
happen. A lock is released, an arm raises and
swings, a record drops, a platter starts spinning,
the arm is lowered, the arm stops, the arm raises
again, it swings back, another record is dropped
onto the platter, the arm is lowered again,
> ! and so on, for as many hours as you like.
L, Deluxe turntables from other companies do
3 much the same thing, but they use many
more parts—scads of separate swinging arms,
filtllmlfiltf gears, plates, and springs—in an arrange
liiillllftlilll ment that is not nearly as mechanically
||||llU%lllt| elegant, or as quiet or reliable; that produces
considerably more vibration, and is much
more susceptible to mechanical shock than
the BSR sequential cam shaft system.
