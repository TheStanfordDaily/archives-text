# Computer Fouls Up; Extra Fees Charged
## 
### STEPHEN CARTER 
University officials are still trying to
discover the causes of massive
computer foul-ups during registration
this week which caused many
sophomores to be charged a $23
freshman orientation fee.
Primary problems came from the
Units Toward Graduation (UTG)
program, according to Marshall
Warner, assistant registrar for
computer services. The UTG, which
determines a student's class standing,
routinely charged the fee to all
students which it classified as
freshmen. Associate Registrar Robert
Houghton emphasized that although
the data base may be incorrect, the
registrar's office has the correct
material on paper.
The registrar's office said it learned
late yesterday that fewer than 100
students were mistakenly charged the
$23 fee. Students who noticed the
error on their Permits to Register
(PTR) before paying fees had the item
removed from their bills. Also, a
memo notified the cashiers early
Monday to be alert for the error.
The registrar's office expected to
have a list by this morning of those
who overpaid. Warner explained that
the list was obtained simply by asking
the computer which "Freshmen" had
paid the fee who did not have student
numbers beginning with 0173, the
code for this year's incoming students.
Student Accounting Manager Joseph
Jedd promised that the University will
notify all students deserving refunds
no later than next Friday.
Delay Explained
The delay, he explained, arises from
a number of causes, including
registering late students, checking
which students have already had the
fee removed, and discovering which
students were charged the fee but
deferred payment. Those who deferred
payment will be granted a credit of
$23 on their deferment forms.
Students who note errors other than
the $23 charge should fill out a
"discrepancy form" at the registrar's
office. Those who note incorrect meal
plan charges should see Karolyn
Gaskin, food service administrative
assistant, and receive a signed

authorization for a refund, Jedd
explained.
Explanations vary on what caused
the errors, but, said Warner, "that
program has never worked right."
Robert Edson, new project leader of
the On-Line Student Information
System (OASIS), explained that his
office will make "every effort" to
improve the situation by next quarter.
He put a large measure of the blame

ENDANGERED DISH — Stanford University's giant radio telescope, nestled in the foothills behind Stanford, may be
coming down. The fate of the "Big Dish" remains in the hands of the government who will decide if funds are to be
allotted to maintain the telescope.
