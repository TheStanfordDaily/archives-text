# Computer Fouls Up; Extra Fees Charged
## 
### STEPHEN CARTER 
University officials are still trying to
discover the causes of massive
computer foul-ups during registration
this week which caused many
sophomores to be charged a $23
freshman orientation fee.
Primary problems came from the
Units Toward Graduation (UTG)
program, according to Marshall
Warner, assistant registrar for
computer services. The UTG, which
determines a student's class standing,
routinely charged the fee to all
students which it classified as
freshmen. Associate Registrar Robert
Houghton emphasized that although
the data base may be incorrect, the
registrar's office has the correct
material on paper.
The registrar's office said it learned
late yesterday that fewer than 100
students were mistakenly charged the
$23 fee. Students who noticed the
error on their Permits to Register
(PTR) before paying fees had the item
removed from their bills. Also, a
memo notified the cashiers early
Monday to be alert for the error.
The registrar's office expected to
have a list by this morning of those
who overpaid. Warner explained that
the list was obtained simply by asking
the computer which "Freshmen" had
paid the fee who did not have student
numbers beginning with 0173, the
code for this year's incoming students.
Student Accounting Manager Joseph
Jedd promised that the University will
notify all students deserving refunds
no later than next Friday.
Delay Explained
The delay, he explained, arises from
a number of causes, including
registering late students, checking
which students have already had the
fee removed, and discovering which
students were charged the fee but
deferred payment. Those who deferred
payment will be granted a credit of
$23 on their deferment forms.
Students who note errors other than
the $23 charge should fill out a
"discrepancy form" at the registrar's
office. Those who note incorrect meal
plan charges should see Karolyn
Gaskin, food service administrative
assistant, and receive a signed

authorization for a refund, Jedd
explained.
Explanations vary on what caused
the errors, but, said Warner, "that
program has never worked right."
Robert Edson, new project leader of
the On-Line Student Information
System (OASIS), explained that his
office will make "every effort" to
improve the situation by next quarter.
He put a large measure of the blame

allotted to maintain the telescope.
for the many recent errors on the
sheer volume the system had to handle
during autumn quarter registration.
Because no advance registration was
held in the spring, he pointed out, the
staff had to handle some 12,000
students, rather than 4000-5000. He
added that more than 100,000 cards
had to be punched for registration
alone, vastly increasing the chances of
error.
Edson further explained that the
chances of machine error were about
one in two billion, but that people had
to do the work of copying student
data, encoding it and keypunching it.
He pointed out that mere sloppy
handwriting could have fouled up the
system.
Edson admitted that many students
could not be provided with PTR's
when they registered, but attributed
this to their long absences from
school. He blamed the system's
current capacity, explaining that it
carries data on "only" some 30,000
current and former students.
Complexity
Cheryl Traver, advanced systems
development manager, refused to
attribute the rash of errors solely to
human causes, blaming instead the
system's complexity. She admitted the
current OASIS set-up is simply too
difficult for humans to handle, calling
this "not excusable in a computer
system." Traver and Edson both noted
that the file, which must be
restructured to ease information
retrieval, is currently being revamped.
Houghton agreed that OASIS has
proven "a more complicated system"
than expected at its inception in
1970-71. "OASIS was behind schedule
right from the start," primarily
because trained programmers in the
past would leave the University to
work for various corporations,
Houghton said.
Massy Committee
A partial solution may not be far
off. Vice Provost for Research William
Massy currently chairs a committee
hoping to iron out many of the
difficulties in OASIS.
Committee members include
Personnel Director Emil Sarpa;

Director of Fiscal Planning Frank
Riddle; Director of Administrative
Records Terry Denley; Director of
Academic Planning Raymond
Bacchetti; University Registrar Sally
Mahoney; Manager of Analytic Studies
Kent Peterson; and Allen Veaner of

University libraries.
Massy said he hoped the situation
would improve by the end of the
quarter. He said that discovering the
errors will be "a hell of a hard
process," adding with a laugh, "it's
going to be an interesting quarter."

coming down. The fate of the "Big Dish" remains in the hands of the government who will decide if funds are to be
allotted to maintain the telescope.
for the many recent errors on the
sheer volume the system had to handle
during autumn quarter registration.
Because no advance registration was
held in the spring, he pointed out, the
staff had to handle some 12,000
students, rather than 4000-5000. He
added that more than 100,000 cards
had to be punched for registration
alone, vastly increasing the chances of
error.
Edson further explained that the
chances of machine error were about
one in two billion, but that people had
to do the work of copying student
data, encoding it and keypunching it.
He pointed out that mere sloppy
handwriting could have fouled up the
system.
Edson admitted that many students
could not be provided with PTR's
when they registered, but attributed
this to their long absences from
school. He blamed the system's
current capacity, explaining that it
carries data on "only" some 30,000
current and former students.
Complexity
Cheryl Traver, advanced systems
development manager, refused to
attribute the rash of errors solely to
human causes, blaming instead the
system's complexity. She admitted the
current OASIS set-up is simply too
difficult for humans to handle, calling
this "not excusable in a computer
system." Traver and Edson both noted
that the file, which must be
restructured to ease information
retrieval, is currently being revamped.
Houghton agreed that OASIS has
proven "a more complicated system"
than expected at its inception in
1970-71. "OASIS was behind schedule
right from the start," primarily
because trained programmers in the
past would leave the University to
work for various corporations,
Houghton said.
Massy Committee
A partial solution may not be far
off. Vice Provost for Research William
Massy currently chairs a committee
hoping to iron out many of the
difficulties in OASIS.
Committee members include
Personnel Director Emil Sarpa;

Director of Fiscal Planning Frank
Riddle; Director of Administrative
Records Terry Denley; Director of
Academic Planning Raymond
Bacchetti; University Registrar Sally
Mahoney; Manager of Analytic Studies
Kent Peterson; and Allen Veaner of

University libraries.
Massy said he hoped the situation
would improve by the end of the
quarter. He said that discovering the
errors will be "a hell of a hard
process," adding with a laugh, "it's
going to be an interesting quarter."
University officials are still trying to
discover the causes of massive
computer foul-ups during registration
this week which caused many
sophomores to be charged a $23
freshman orientation fee.
Primary problems came from the
Units Toward Graduation (UTG)
program, according to Marshall
Warner, assistant registrar for
computer services. The UTG, which
determines a student's class standing,
routinely charged the fee to all
students which it classified as
freshmen. Associate Registrar Robert
Houghton emphasized that although
the data base may be incorrect, the
registrar's office has the correct
material on paper.
The registrar's office said it learned
late yesterday that fewer than 100
students were mistakenly charged the
$23 fee. Students who noticed the
error on their Permits to Register
(PTR) before paying fees had the item
removed from their bills. Also, a
memo notified the cashiers early
Monday to be alert for the error.
The registrar's office expected to
have a list by this morning of those
who overpaid. Warner explained that
the list was obtained simply by asking
the computer which "Freshmen" had
paid the fee who did not have student
numbers beginning with 0173, the
code for this year's incoming students.
Student Accounting Manager Joseph
Jedd promised that the University will
notify all students deserving refunds
no later than next Friday.
Delay Explained
The delay, he explained, arises from
a number of causes, including
registering late students, checking
which students have already had the
fee removed, and discovering which
students were charged the fee but
deferred payment. Those who deferred
payment will be granted a credit of
$23 on their deferment forms.
Students who note errors other than
the $23 charge should fill out a
"discrepancy form" at the registrar's
office. Those who note incorrect meal
plan charges should see Karolyn
Gaskin, food service administrative
assistant, and receive a signed

current capacity, explaining that it
carries data on "only" some 30,000
current and former students.
Complexity
Cheryl Traver, advanced systems
development manager, refused to
attribute the rash of errors solely to
human causes, blaming instead the
system's complexity. She admitted the
current OASIS set-up is simply too
difficult for humans to handle, calling
this "not excusable in a computer
system." Traver and Edson both noted
that the file, which must be
restructured to ease information
retrieval, is currently being revamped.
Houghton agreed that OASIS has
proven "a more complicated system"
than expected at its inception in
1970-71. "OASIS was behind schedule
right from the start," primarily
because trained programmers in the
past would leave the University to
work for various corporations,
Houghton said.
Massy Committee
A partial solution may not be far
off. Vice Provost for Research William
Massy currently chairs a committee
hoping to iron out many of the
difficulties in OASIS.
Committee members include
Personnel Director Emil Sarpa;

Director of Fiscal Planning Frank
Riddle; Director of Administrative
Records Terry Denley; Director of
Academic Planning Raymond
Bacchetti; University Registrar Sally
Mahoney; Manager of Analytic Studies
Kent Peterson; and Allen Veaner of

University libraries.
Massy said he hoped the situation
would improve by the end of the
quarter. He said that discovering the
errors will be "a hell of a hard
process," adding with a laugh, "it's
going to be an interesting quarter."
University officials are still trying to
discover the causes of massive
computer foul-ups during registration
this week which caused many
sophomores to be charged a $23
freshman orientation fee.
Primary problems came from the
Units Toward Graduation (UTG)
program, according to Marshall
Warner, assistant registrar for
computer services. The UTG, which
determines a student's class standing,
routinely charged the fee to all
students which it classified as
freshmen. Associate Registrar Robert
Houghton emphasized that although
the data base may be incorrect, the
registrar's office has the correct
material on paper.
The registrar's office said it learned
late yesterday that fewer than 100
students were mistakenly charged the
$23 fee. Students who noticed the
error on their Permits to Register
(PTR) before paying fees had the item
removed from their bills. Also, a
memo notified the cashiers early
Monday to be alert for the error.
The registrar's office expected to
have a list by this morning of those
who overpaid. Warner explained that
the list was obtained simply by asking
the computer which "Freshmen" had
paid the fee who did not have student
numbers beginning with 0173, the
code for this year's incoming students.
Student Accounting Manager Joseph
Jedd promised that the University will
notify all students deserving refunds
no later than next Friday.
Delay Explained
The delay, he explained, arises from
a number of causes, including
registering late students, checking
which students have already had the
fee removed, and discovering which
students were charged the fee but
deferred payment. Those who deferred
payment will be granted a credit of
$23 on their deferment forms.
Students who note errors other than
the $23 charge should fill out a
"discrepancy form" at the registrar's
office. Those who note incorrect meal
plan charges should see Karolyn
Gaskin, food service administrative
assistant, and receive a signed

authorization for a refund, Jedd
explained.
Explanations vary on what caused
the errors, but, said Warner, "that
program has never worked right."
Robert Edson, new project leader of
the On-Line Student Information
System (OASIS), explained that his
office will make "every effort" to
improve the situation by next quarter.
He put a large measure of the blame

for the many recent errors on the
sheer volume the system had to handle
during autumn quarter registration.
Because no advance registration was
held in the spring, he pointed out, the
staff had to handle some 12,000
students, rather than 4000-5000. He
added that more than 100,000 cards
had to be punched for registration
alone, vastly increasing the chances of
error.
Edson further explained that the
chances of machine error were about
one in two billion, but that people had
to do the work of copying student
data, encoding it and keypunching it.
He pointed out that mere sloppy
handwriting could have fouled up the
system.
Edson admitted that many students
could not be provided with PTR's
when they registered, but attributed
this to their long absences from
school. He blamed the system's
current capacity, explaining that it
carries data on "only" some 30,000
current and former students.
