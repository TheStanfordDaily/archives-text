# The 						Monarchy Of King Veg
## 
### 
The library need not be the
null set of the Stanford student's
social life.
After all, there is the Chess
Club, the Bridge club, the skiing,
drama, tennis, photography, and
foreign language clubs. There are
groups for blacks, browns, reds,
liberal republicans, conservative
republicans, democrats, marxists
and libertarians.
Why not the Veg Club?
As it happens there is indeed a
Veg Club, now welcoming new
members.
The first question that occurs
is what, pray tell, is the Veg Club?
Truth be told it has never been
precisely defined. However it can
be partially described.
Two Years Ago
The Veg Club was initiated two
years ago in a freshman dorm (as
have so many other fine Stanford
traditions such as the inter-dorm
water balloon fight, the "let's
drink beer until we throw-up"
Saturday night, the "let's get the
redcoat" food fight, and the
"what do you want to do" Friday
night).
Veg Club activities center in
the Stacks. Yes, the stacks â€” that
citadel of higher learning, that
four-story book shelf.
The Patron Saint of the Veg
Club is King Veg.
I suspect you still do not have
a clear picture of the frequently
aforementioned club. Let's try a
chronological description.
The account which follows is
approximately true. The names
have been changed to protect the
guilty.
Melancholy Friendship
The whole thing started with
the melancholy friendship of two
pre-med students. Living in the
same freshman dorm, these two
pillars of the academic
community, whom we shall call
Tom and Dick, found that their
library schedules coincided; they
went when it opened and left
when it closed.
Nurtured by this similarity of
experience and a common despair
at being pre-med they slowly
became fast friends.
Being human they at length

decided that they must make the
studious hours at the library a
social asset rather than a liability.
Hie first tactic they employed
was to pretend they enjoyed
studying in the library. They
found favorite cubicals, adjoining,
in which they invariably studied.
They avoided social contact with
people who studied in the circus
atmosphere of the Undergraduate
Library which they referred to
only by its acronym, UGLY.
These feeble efforts floundered
on the dreary fact of their nightly
entombment. And then they
discovered King Veg.
Who Is He?
It is uncertain precisely what,
or who, King Veg is. However, it
is a recorded fact that every time
Tom or Dick went in the library
King Veg was there already. And
King Veg never left before they
did.
It was then that Tom and Dick
began discovering the innermost
secrets of the stacks. They found
there were certain cubicals which
were always occupied. Certain
beings which were always there,
often sitting silently for weeks
before the same book.
They had glassy, opaque eyes.
They could not speak, but could
only make hissing noises from
behind their lips.
Conclusion
By the oppressive weight of the
evidence Tom and Dick were
forced to a disquieting
conclusion: the Stacks were
riddled with a vegetable
sub-culture. In the light of this
courageous moment of
intellectual insight many bizarre
bits of information formed a
sudden pattern.
The purpose of the network of
pipes and sprinklers throughout
the library was now clear.
The periodic disappearance of
regular library goers was
explained. They had taken root,
and now lived always in the
lightbulb twilight of the Stacks.
Regular incursions of groups
of gardeners and the subsequent
absence of several of the silent
sitters indicated the University
was trimming once again.

And finally the terrible
deadpan dignity of King Veg, lord
of the hidden cubicals, was made
plain.
Far from being horrified by
this revelation, Tom and Dick
were elated. It planted the seed of
an idea which would revolutionize
their social existence. Like the veg
culture the social system would
center in the Library! It was in
that moment the Veg Club was
bom.
Membership requirements are
nebulous. Veg Clubism is more a
state of mind than any particular
activity. The one requirement for
full membership status is regular
pilgrimages to the Stacks.
Knowing full well how few
were capable of fulfilling this
requirement, Tom and Dick also
established associate member
positions. Associate Members
were required to simply be in
sympathy with the movement and
its movers.
