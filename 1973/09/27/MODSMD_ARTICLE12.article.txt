Growing Membership
In a twinkling the club swelled
to four members, including Harry,
and myself as an associate
member. At this plateau
membership leveled off, though
the club's term for the Stacks, the
Veg Pathc, spread throughout the
dorm and from there rippled
across campus.
New members were taken to
view King Veg.
. (He looked like a perfectly
ordinary Stanford Upperclassman,
except for his dead fish eyes.)
This year the Veg Club is
sedately active. The first sighting
of King Veg has yet to be
recorded but this is hardly
surprising since the heavy
studying is not yet underway.
Cucumber Calm
Some theorize that the veg
culture has moved out of the
library. They cite the cucumber
calm of the campus in recent
time, and the rising number of
academically obsessed students.
I do not much credit this
theory myself as I believe that real
sunshine would be fatal to these
hothouse beings. Besides which,
everyone I know complains about
the food and the tuition, factors
which would hardly bother a
vegetable being.
Any persons interested in
membership in this organizaton
should feel uninhibited in
contacting me care of the Daily.
If two people do something,
it's a humor column. But if it's in
the paper it's a movement.
Veges of the world, Unite!
