About 400 transfer students
arrived at Stanford this year; 135
got into on-campus housing. The
others face a crisis shortage in
housing. Many of them will end
up living by themselves, knowing
nobody in the Stanford area. A
student who comes here without
any avenue for meeting people in
dorms or off-campus houses is in a
miserable position.
If you would like to help ease
this situation, call the ASSU
Office, 321-2300, extension 4331.
They will give you the name and
phone number of one or more
transfer students who did not get
on-campus housing. The rest is up
to you and the transfer. Bring
him/her home for dinner or just
show 'em around. The important
thing is that as many transfers as
possible have some friendly
contact at Stanford.

I am cognizant of the fact that
spiraling prices have fomented an
increase in University costs. I am
also aware of the bureaucratic
difficulties and the expense of a
mail-out to all returning students.
Still, it is embarrasing to give
one's parents a total estimate of
the tuition and room and board
bill that has an error factor as
large as two hundred dollars per
quarter.
It seems that someone in the
Grcumlocution Office could take
the time to inform returning
students of the precise amount
that will be expected and collect
Fall quarter of the new year,
particularly if that amount
involves another substantial
increase.
