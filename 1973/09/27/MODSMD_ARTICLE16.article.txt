and special per diem allowances
related to that travel.
About half of that travel was
to Washington, D.C., and the
expense records show most of it
was one or two-day trips. But the
travel roster also shows trips to
such diverse places as Calgary,
Canada; Aspen, Colo.; Detroit and
various Florida cities.
Calgary Stampede
Five members of a legislative
committee in charge of county
fairs visited the Calgary Stampede
in mid-July on "legislative
business," racking up $500 to
$800 each in expenses.
On Saturday, one of the five
members of the Calgary trip, Sen.
Randolph Collier, E>—Yreka, is
scheduled to leave on a two-week
tour of forest lands in Europe on
"legislative business" of the Select
Committee on Timber Land.
At present, the records in the
state controller's office are
incomplete, and some are as much
as seven weeks behind in posting
of expenditures.
Expensee Remain Study
But they point to year-end
total expenditures matching
almost precisely last year's total
of $3.08 million in salaries and
personal expenses of legislators.
Last year the average legislator
received $19,200 in salary plus
about $6,500 in personal expense
and travel money. This year's
salary is unchanged, and expenses
are at about the same rate.
The state's most expensive
legislator so far this year is
Assemblyman John Burton,
D—San Francisco, who has
accumulated $20,979.83 in salary
and expenses, including $2,370 in
travel on 16 different dates.
He's Number Two
Number two traveler is
Assemblyman William T. Bagley,
R—San Rafael, with 14 trips
costing $1,895. His total salary
and expenses is $20,833.78.
Other top spenders and
travelers are Assemblyman John
Briggs, R—Fullerton, $20,774.23,
and Carlos Bee, D—Hay ward,

$20,456.39.
Altogether, 21 of 40 senators
and 61 of 80 Assembly members
had some travel expenditure.
Party Leaders
Party leaders in both houses
were relatively low in travel
expenses:
Assembly Speaker Bob
Moretti, ID—Van Nuys, claimed
only $625.37 for three trips. His
total expenses and salary to date
are $19,125.37.
Assembly GOP floor leader
Robert Beverly, R—Manhattan
Beach, ran up only $437.93 in
travel so far this year, for a total

of $19,45.63 in salary and
expenses.
Un the low side were two
legislators who objected to the
hike last year to $30 a day per
diem for legislators. Sen. Albert
Rodda, D— Sacramento, and
Assemblyman Floyd Wakefield,
R South Gate, both still accept
only $25-a-day, the same as other
state officials.
That meant Wakefield, who
also claimed no special travel
expenses total of only $17,725.
Rodda, who claimed only $75 so
far this year for travel, had a total
of $17,950.

and special per diem allowances
related to that travel.
About half of that travel was
to Washington, D.C., and the
expense records show most of it
was one or two-day trips. But the
travel roster also shows trips to
such diverse places as Calgary,
Canada; Aspen, Colo.; Detroit and
various Florida cities.
Calgary Stampede
Five members of a legislative
committee in charge of county
fairs visited the Calgary Stampede
in mid-July on "legislative
business," racking up $500 to
$800 each in expenses.
On Saturday, one of the five
members of the Calgary trip, Sen.
Randolph Collier, E>—Yreka, is
scheduled to leave on a two-week
tour of forest lands in Europe on
"legislative business" of the Select
Committee on Timber Land.
At present, the records in the
state controller's office are
incomplete, and some are as much
as seven weeks behind in posting
of expenditures.
Expensee Remain Study
But they point to year-end
total expenditures matching
almost precisely last year's total
of $3.08 million in salaries and
personal expenses of legislators.
Last year the average legislator
received $19,200 in salary plus
about $6,500 in personal expense
and travel money. This year's
salary is unchanged, and expenses
are at about the same rate.
The state's most expensive
legislator so far this year is
Assemblyman John Burton,
D—San Francisco, who has
accumulated $20,979.83 in salary
and expenses, including $2,370 in
travel on 16 different dates.
He's Number Two
Number two traveler is
Assemblyman William T. Bagley,
R—San Rafael, with 14 trips
costing $1,895. His total salary
and expenses is $20,833.78.
Other top spenders and
travelers are Assemblyman John
Briggs, R—Fullerton, $20,774.23,
and Carlos Bee, D—Hay ward,

$20,456.39.
Altogether, 21 of 40 senators
and 61 of 80 Assembly members
had some travel expenditure.
Party Leaders
Party leaders in both houses
were relatively low in travel
expenses:
Assembly Speaker Bob
Moretti, ID—Van Nuys, claimed
only $625.37 for three trips. His
total expenses and salary to date
are $19,125.37.
Assembly GOP floor leader
Robert Beverly, R—Manhattan
Beach, ran up only $437.93 in
travel so far this year, for a total

of $19,45.63 in salary and
expenses.
Un the low side were two
legislators who objected to the
hike last year to $30 a day per
diem for legislators. Sen. Albert
Rodda, D— Sacramento, and
Assemblyman Floyd Wakefield,
R South Gate, both still accept
only $25-a-day, the same as other
state officials.
That meant Wakefield, who
also claimed no special travel
expenses total of only $17,725.
Rodda, who claimed only $75 so
far this year for travel, had a total
of $17,950.
SACRAMENTO (AP) -
California's 120 state legislators
have received more than $2.3
million in salaries and personnal
expenses so far this year, an
average of a little more than
$19,000 each, official records
show.
That includes only the cash
paid directly to members of the
Senate and Assembly. It does not
include their state-leased
automobiles, gasoline and
telephone credit cards or other
fringe benefits.
Of that total, about $1.5
million is salary — $12,800 each
for the first eight months of the
year — and about $7 00,000 is the
$30-per-day per diem living
allowance which lawmakers are

scheduled to leave on a two-week

as seven weeks behind in posting
of expenditures.
Expensee Remain Study
But they point to year-end
total expenditures matching
almost precisely last year's total
of $3.08 million in salaries and
personal expenses of legislators.
Last year the average legislator
received $19,200 in salary plus
about $6,500 in personal expense
and travel money. This year's
salary is unchanged, and expenses
are at about the same rate.
The state's most expensive
legislator so far this year is
Assemblyman John Burton,
D—San Francisco, who has
accumulated $20,979.83 in salary
and expenses, including $2,370 in
travel on 16 different dates.

Number two traveler is
Assemblyman William T. Bagley,
R—San Rafael, with 14 trips
costing $1,895. His total salary
and expenses is $20,833.78.
Other top spenders and
travelers are Assemblyman John
Briggs, R—Fullerton, $20,774.23,
and Carlos Bee, D—Hay ward,

$20,456.39.
Altogether, 21 of 40 senators
and 61 of 80 Assembly members
had some travel expenditure.
Party Leaders
Party leaders in both houses
were relatively low in travel
expenses:
Assembly Speaker Bob
Moretti, ID—Van Nuys, claimed
only $625.37 for three trips. His
total expenses and salary to date
are $19,125.37.
Assembly GOP floor leader
Robert Beverly, R—Manhattan
Beach, ran up only $437.93 in
travel so far this year, for a total

of $19,45.63 in salary and
expenses.
Un the low side were two
legislators who objected to the
hike last year to $30 a day per
diem for legislators. Sen. Albert
Rodda, D— Sacramento, and
Assemblyman Floyd Wakefield,
R South Gate, both still accept
only $25-a-day, the same as other
state officials.
That meant Wakefield, who
also claimed no special travel
expenses total of only $17,725.
Rodda, who claimed only $75 so
far this year for travel, had a total
of $17,950.
SACRAMENTO (AP) -
California's 120 state legislators
have received more than $2.3
million in salaries and personnal
expenses so far this year, an
average of a little more than
$19,000 each, official records
show.
That includes only the cash
paid directly to members of the
Senate and Assembly. It does not
include their state-leased
automobiles, gasoline and
telephone credit cards or other
fringe benefits.
Of that total, about $1.5
million is salary — $12,800 each
for the first eight months of the
year — and about $7 00,000 is the
$30-per-day per diem living
allowance which lawmakers are
allowed during the regular
