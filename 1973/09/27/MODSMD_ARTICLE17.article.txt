# Colleges Examine Prof Moonlighting

### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - A
committee on faculty and staff
affairs for trustees of California
State University and Colleges took
up the issue of faculty
moonlighting yesterday but took
no action.
The committee studied a
statement of guidelines on outside
employment but postponed
further consideration.
Dr. Charles Adams, chairman
of the Academic Senate, said "the
central issue is that people
employed should carry out their
assigned duties."
William O. Weissich, a trustee
from San Rafael, said "I felt we
should only put down that they're
expected to do their job well and
what they do after that is their
own affair."
Another trustee, Winifred H.
Lancaster of Santa Barbara, said
she believed a detailed guideline
would simply "Legislate
mediocrity" and felt they could
not put a limitation on the more
brilliant and energetic faculty
members.
The committee also passed
resolution guidelines for salary

and fringe benefit increases for
academic personnel. Vice
Chancellor C. Mansel Keene said
they called for a salary increase of
s>/ 2 percent and fringe benefits of
3V2 percent. The guidelines are
recommended to the legislature
for next year's budget.
Keane told the trustees that
faculty recruiting had become
increasingly tough in recent years
because salaries are not
comparable at some other
institutions.
A faculty spokesman said he
did not believe the 5V6 percent
proposal was a realistic figure and
said it did not even keep pace
with the cost of living.
In a session Tuesday trustees
heard a staff report concerning
"serious administrative
deficiencies" in student financial
aid programs at San Francisco and
Sonoma State universities.
Audit staff chief Fred Dalton
said the chancellor's office told
administrators at the two schools
to review student aid files back to
the 1970-71 school year and take
steps where appropriate to recover
awards lacking justification.
