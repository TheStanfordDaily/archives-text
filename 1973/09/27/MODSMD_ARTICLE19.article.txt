# 1961â€”1967 Survey
## MBAs Pleased With Jobs 
### 
A study of seven classes of
graduates from the Master of
Business Administration program
here, 1961-67, indicates the job
satisfaction and perception of job
success are remarkably high.
Two-thirds of those surveyed
indicate that they found their jobs
either "extraordinarily satisfying"
or "very satisfying."
About a third of the
respondents classified their job
success as "extraordinarily
successful" or "very successful,"
while 46 percent described it as
"successful." Only six percent
termed their job success
"moderate" or "minimal."
Among these graduates, starting
salaries ran from $600 per month
in 1961 to $1005 in 1967.
Salaries doubled by five years
after graduation, with graduates in

small businesses (less than 1000
employees) earning more than
those in large companies in recent
years.
Marketing was the leading field
of work, employing 23 percent of
the respondents. Finance and
general management each
employed 20 percent of the
graduates concerned. As might be
expected, graduates in small
business reached general
management earlier.
Overall, twice as many
graduates were employed in big as
opposed to small business.
However there was a decided shift
to small business in the class of
1967, which has become a general
trend since then.
Eighty-seven percent of those
surveyed responded; a total of

606 questionnaires were returned.
Only American born men were
included since it was felt that
earnings would be less comparable
if sex and national differences
were included.
Although the sample is small, it
is interesting to note that those
employed in a family business
earned less than classmates in
nonfamily business.
At the outset of the study,
those in family business were
omitted from the results on the
grounds that they might be
earning excessively high salaries
because of their kinship. The
reverse turns out to be the case.
Funded by a grant from Walter
H. Field 111, the study was
conducted by Thomas W. Harrell
and Margaret S. Harrell.
