# Labor Contract Negotiations
## USE—University Talks Begin 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
United Stanford Employees (USE)
begins bargaining with the University
today for a contract for some 1550
workers, but serious discussions still
seem far away.
The union, which won the right in
June to represent the University
technical, maintenance and service
workers, sits down today with the
University to discuss such issues as the
size of the negotiating teams and the
time and place of negotiations.
But, at a USE membership meeting
in Tresidder Union last night attended
by 62 persons, Jim Berk, a member of
USE's bargaining team, pointed out
that "if we were to begin serious
bargaining tomorrow, we would be
embarrassed."
Berk and the union's Executive
Committee have thus ordered Kit
Taylor, the union's fulltime organizer
from the Service Employees
International Union (SEIU) of the
AFL-CIO, to concentrate on research
work.
Research
Much research is necessary, Berk
and Dennis Davie, alternate on the
negotiations team, explained, because
of the type of wage package USE will
ask for.
Instead of asking for a monetary
wage hike of $100 per month for the
workers, USE's contract
representatives voted 82 to 22 percent

to ask for a wage increase in each job
category to "at least average Bay Area
standards."
This, Taylor explained, requires that
the union define job categories as well
as find out what average Bay Area
standards are.
In the most recent issue of the
union newspaper, Employees
Organize, USE called for workers to
submit comparative wage data to the
union.
102% Participation
USE contract representatives also
have voted 75 percent to 27 percent to
seek a one-year contract rather than an
ongoing one, Davies explained, adding
that "the figures add up to more than
100 percent because some people
voted on both sides."
This was not the only note of
comedy at the membership meeting.
At one point, procedural questions
were debated for some 15 minutes
before a vote was finally taken on
whether pictures of candidates for
union office should be put in
Employees Organize.
After long debate, a vote was taken
— with two recounts — the second of
which was conducted by a standing
count and left USE reporter Jack
Truher crawling out of the room.
Eventually, the members voted
31-27 to allow pictures of candidates
to be printed in the newspaper. About
five members subsequently walked

out, calling the policy "racist."
The elections for USE general
officers will take place Oct. 24. Three
persons, Davies, Berk, and Keith Doty
are all running for President.
Berk, a former President, is the
husband of current USE President
Glenda Jones. Jones, at expiration of
her term of office, will become a
salaried employee of the union.
Early in the meeting, one member
said he "wondered at the propriety of
the wife of the possible future
President being a fulltime employee."
In other business, Jim Wolpman, the
union's lawyer, spoke on the dispute
between USE and Tout de Suite, Inc.
(TDS), the private food services
committee which manages Tresidder
cafeteria and coffee house.
TDS Dispute
According to Wolpman, the
National Labor Relations Board in
Washington is currently mediating the
dispute. USE claims the workers, who
were employed by the University until
TDS took over June 22, should be
members of the bargaining unit. The
workers were part of the unit which
voted for the unit June 6.
Asked why the union doesn't give
up its suit and seek to organize these
55 workers anew, Wolpman said "the
problem there is that TDS came in and
started smoothing up to those
people," and therefore USE might be
unable to win such an election.
