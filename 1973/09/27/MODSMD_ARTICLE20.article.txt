# 'Independence' Here Noted
## 
### 
In the absence of other social
rituals, entering college has
become the time when many
youths obtain a symbolic
"declaration of independence"
from their parents, Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons said
last Friday.
He urged 300 parents of
freshmen to respect the decisions
of their sons and daughters and be
tolerant of a lack of information
from them.
While parents may certainly
disagree with their youngsters'
decisions, they should not
threaten retribution, he said.
Criticize their actions "as a good
friend" who "ultimately accepts
their prerogative to make
choices," Lyons suggested.
While parents commonly
finance their children's education,
he noted, "our primary obligation
is to your sons and daughters, to
provide them the best education
possible."
Some parents may find it "hard
to swallow" the fact that the
University won't send them
grades, advise them of every
troublesome episode, and that the
amount of individualized
information "from us to you will
be virtually zero," he noted.
'Source Of Information'
With few exceptions, "your
only source of information about
your sons and daughters is
themselves." But whenever there
is a severe crisis, "whenever their
health or welfare is in jeopardy,
you will hear" from the
University, he added.
When freshmen return home on
their first vacation, don't ask
them when they'll be at the
house. Inquire instead about their
classes and new friends, Lyons
suggested. "You may not get an
answer, but try," he added,
drawing laughter.
"If things should start to go
wrong, remember that your sons
and daughters will see Stanford as
a time of testing — and to test,
you have to have the possibility of

failure."
Few Flunk Out
Very, very few students flunk
out of Stanford, he pointed out,
but to freshmen little faiures seem
overwhelming — flunking a single
test in chemistry can be seen as
the end of any hopes for medical
school, for example.
Small problems may be
magnified if parents tell students
they're not studying hard enough
or the students come to feel they
have somehow failed their
parents. 'They're more sensitive
than you may realize to your
appraisals," Lyons said.
While there are probably less
extreme variations in ideology and
life styles than five years ago,
these, too, will be tested as
students seek to develop their
own individual identity. "This can
be very painful, but keep your

cool," Lyons advised.
Idea Marketplace
The university remains a place
where "ideas can be stretched and
the consequences of experiencing
failure minimized," he added.
Hence academic transcripts at
Stanford show only those courses
successfully completed, a policy
which permits students to try new
fields. (To remain in good
standing, students must
successfully complete a specified
total number of units.)
Despite the highly publicized
demise of in loco parentis and the
ivory tower on campus, Lyons
said, "We still have limits. We
surround your sons and daughters
with human beings whose job it is
to know them well" and to help
when things go wrong.
Because the University has "the
highest regard for old-fashioned,

civil libertarian ideas about
privacy (of information], we do a
lot you'll never hear about," he
said.
Police Patrols Increased
Questioned about the campus
murder early this month, Lyons
said police patrols have been
increased, both by the University
and the sheriff's department.
Despite an "unbelievably
intensive" investigation, "as yet
we have no idea who did it, or
why."
Lyons said he personally feels
"it was a random act." He said he
was "quite hopeful" the
individual responsible would be
identified, arrested, and
convicted.
The University offered a
$10,000 reward for information
leading to such an outcome the
day after the campus killing.
