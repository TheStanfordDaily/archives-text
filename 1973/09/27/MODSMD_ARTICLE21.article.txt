# California Regents Review Board's Investment Policy
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — The question of how
University of California regents vote on UC
investments arose last week in the Board of Regents
meeting.
William Roth asked fellow regents to read a
report concerning how a number of major
universities and foundations handle their investment
matters. The report showed that six major
universities were members of the nonprofit Investor
Responsibility Research Center.
Both then suggested that the University of
California pay the $5,000 fee to join the IRRC to
obtain further information about the firms in which
the University has its funds invested.
He was joined in the idea by Lee Altschuler, a
representative for the University-wide Student Body
Presidents' Council, Altschuler said the more
information the regents received, the more socially
responsible they could be when voting on the stock
the university holds.
The University of California has $1.1 billion
invested, including $456 million in common stock.
In reply to Roth and Altschuler, the regents

agreed to investigate the whole question of how the
university votes on the stock in its investment
portfolio, Altschuler said that "in the past, the
university has blindly followed management's
position right on down the line."
Some of the nation's top universities, including
Harvard, Princeton and Stanford, belong to the
IRRC, a firm regulated by the Securities and
Exchange Commission as an investment advisory
group.
Altschuler said joining the IRRC would be
"money well spent."
Later, Dean Watkins, chairman of the board of
regents, admitted he had no idea how much the
university made on its investments last year, and
also said the voting record of investments
committee members on stock proxy votes is
confidential.
He said the investments committee meets in
executive session to handle such stock matters and
their votes are not made public because if they
were, they might affect the market.
