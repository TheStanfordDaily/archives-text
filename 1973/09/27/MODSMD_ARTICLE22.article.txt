# Expect 45 To Enroll
## MBA Program Attracts More Women 
### 
Ten years ago six women
application to the Business
School's Master of Business
Administration (MBA) program.
One enrolled.
This year the School has
received 223 applications from
women, and 45 are expected to be
part of the class entering this
month.
Women comprise
approximately 15 percent of the
600 MBA students this fall, up
from about nine percent last year.
Through June, 1972, the
number of women holding the
Stanford MBA degree totaled 102.
About a third of all the women
who have ever attended Stanford
Business School were in residence
during the past academic year.
Why the heavy female interest
in management all of a sudden?
Gary G. Williams, assistant dean
for admissions and students
affairs, says: "It's a subtle factor,
but the word is out that women
can move to higher levels of
management, and increasingly,
women are recognizing that the
MBA degree is a good way to get
there."
Reasons For Interest
The women's liberation
movement, affirmative action
programs, and changing
male-female work and social roles
are among key reasons for the
burgeoning interest in
management education, say MBA
students here.

"Women are turning away from
fields society expects them to
follow and are now doing what
they are interested in," says
Barbara Burgess, MBA '73.
"Women are also finding out they
don't have to be hard, cold, and
calculating in order to be
managers," she adds.
Mary Barnacle, MBA '74,
believes the women's movement
rates a lot of credit for raising
women's consciousness of work
and career. Barnacle decided she
wanted an MBA degree when,
after working for several years,
she found herself dealing
increasingly with MBA's, but at a
distinct disadvantage to herself.
'No Match For MBAs'
"Continually, I found myself in
situations where, despite what I
knew, I was no match for people
with MBA training. I decided I
wanted a career," she adds.
Joellyn Murphy, MBA '74, says
the MBA degree is "a credential
and a half for women. Women
need it more than men now in
order to overcome stereotypes,
demonstrate competence, and
pave the way for others who will
come. The MBA degree is an
opportunity to leap over the time
it would otherwise take to
equalize salary with a man."
Murphy, who spent several
years in volunteer work with a
community-based fair housing
group, plans to continue working
far community organizations

following graduation. She came to
the Business School because she
feels that "people in community
organizations need to know how
decisions are made, how to get
data, and how to interpret it. If
you want to work within the
system, you need to know how
the system operates. That means
you need to understand finance,
accounting, and economics."
Diverse Backgrounds
Like their male counterparts,
today's female MBA candidates
have widely diverse backgrounds,
experience, and job objectives.
The Class of '74, for example,
ranges in age from 23 to 37. Their
undergraduate backgrounds
include major study in
mathematics (three students),
engineering, art, psychology,
biology, economics, history,
anthropology, and social science.
Two have been computer
programmer analysts. One was a
ski resort recreational director.
One ran an art gallery. Two were
airline stewardesses. One was an
advertising designer. One managed
sales and • marketing for a
family-owned food manufacturing
business. Another was a restaurant
manager. And still another
founded and operated her own
hotel food catering service.
High Achievement Record
Women MBA students here also
exhibit uniformly high academic
achievement. Of the 21 women
students in the Class of 1973, four

were high school valedictorians,
eight graduated with honors, and
three of the eight received their
undergraduate degrees "cum
laude."
As women become more of a
fixture in class, they are less
frequently called upon to defend
their enrollment or to "give the
woman's point of view" in class.
Being taken seriously, however, is
a real problem, say many of the
women students. Stereotypes and
female socialization seem to
complicate things for both sexes.
Murphy reports that one visitor
to her class imagined that all the
women in class were housewives.
"We had a marketing executive
who, in introducing himself, said
he hoped his talk would be useful
for the students — and then,
looking at the women in the class
— and their wives."
Going On Offensive
Marianne Austin, MBA '73, a
soft-spoken person, found herself
going on the offensive in order to
avoid being ignored, and then
worried about whether her
behavior was too aggressive.
Barnacle came to business
school partly because she felt she
wasn't taken seriously in her job.
"I had to work twiqe as hard to
convince someone that I was as
qualified as a man. At the bank I
remember a person coming in to
talk to a bank officer. I kept
telling him I was an officer, but
what he really wanted was to talk

to a man."
If the backgrounds of today's
GSB women are highly varied, so,
too, are their job interests. The
days when women MBAs
concentrated in advertising and
marketing may be over, if the
class of '73 is indicative. Public
accounting, banking, and
investment management attracted
the majority of the students, with
others taking jobs in management
consulting, computer sales, food
service, land development, and the
federal Office of Management and
Budget.
Job Successes
There were firsts for some.
Austin is joining the tax
department of Arthur Andersen,
San Francisco, the first woman in
that department. Barbara Burgess
is joining an acquisitions
subsidiary of Wells Fargo Bank in
San Francisco, the first women on
a five-member professional staff.
Adams will be doing negotiated
underwriting in municipal finance
with Blyth, Eastman, Dillon and
Co., New York, where she will be
one of the first women in a highly
specialized, male dominated field.
Carole Lynn sums it up: "The
first quarter is really a tough
adjustment — the workload is very
heavy and constant. There is a lot
of diversity, and a lot of very
different career interests, and the
people mix as they do anywhere.
There are some who sympathize
and some who don't."

YOUR KIND OF PLACE? — If Food Service and Tresidder prices are
getting you down, there's a place on El Camino Real where you can
still get a burger, coke and fries, and change back from your dollar.
