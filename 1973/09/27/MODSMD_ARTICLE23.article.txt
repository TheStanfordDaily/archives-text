OAKLAND—The ornate movie palaces of the
1920s and the 1930s that served as emporiums of
celluloid Hollywood dreams for moviegoers of the
Depression era still stand today in cities across the
nation.
But they have fallen into disrepair or undergone
transformation into supermarkets while today's
Slmgoers frequent smaller, newer theaters.
But a glimpse of the Golden Age of the movies
was visible at the restored Paramount Theater in
Oakland — listed by the Historic American
Buildings survey as "a fine example of Art Deco
(Moderne) architecture" — as public officials and
entertainers participated in the premiere of the
refurbished theater last Saturday nignt.
Former Supreme Court Justice Earl Warren,

Rudy Vallee, Kathryn (Mrs. Bing) Crosby, and
numerous local officials viewed a variety show
patterned after the original opening of the
Paramount in 1931. The revue featured such
performers as Henry Fonda, Milton Berle, and
Donald O'Connor.
Gov. Ronald Reagan was expected to attend, but
was delayed in Southern California by plane
troubles.
The nostalgia-packed opening was a benefit for
the non-profit Paramount Theater of the Arts.
Renovated at a cost of $4 million, the resurrected
3000-seat Paramount will serve as a cultural center
for the Bay Area. Experts say it ranks as "one of the
top ten performing arts theaters in the world."

installation of plush carpeting just prior to the reopening of the
Paramount Theater of the Arts last Saturday. The new carpeting was
woven by the company who made the original rugs and is fashioned in
the same pattern. The "art deco" style of the Paramount has been
painstakingly restored with applications of gold and silver leaf.
