## Perry Mason Lays A Brick 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
Watch out for any show calling
itself "The New." That means it's
trying to modernize the old and in
the case of CBS's The New Perry
Mason, that means disaster.
The old Perry Mason, is still an
institution in the United States
although Earle Stanley Gardner
and three of the five original stars
are dead, a graying Raymond Bun
spends his hours in a wheelchair,
and Barbara Hale (formerly Delia
Street) now advertises
refrigerators.
But we well remember the
nights when a murder was
committed and we tried to help
Perry solve the crime to free his
client.
Playing heavily on our
nostalgic memories of the old
series, CBS executives have tried
to revive the era of Perry Mason.
If they had put more time into
casting and script-writing they
might have succeeded, but now,
fine recollections of a good show
are being whitewashed by
glimpses of a cheap copy that
sacrifices ingeniously detailed
production for thoughtless
commercial trash.
The New Perry Mason isn't
really new. It is a combination of
Owen Marshall, Mannix, and
Hawaii Five-O. Perry galavants all
over the country, makes
emotional pleas, and looks
debonaire. But the subtleties are
virtually non-existant both in the
lines and those who deliver them.
Incompetent Acting
With so many actors looking
for work it is amazing that CBS
casting directors couldn't find
capable ones. Monte Markham
(we underline the ham) who you
might remember from Mr. Deeds
Goes To Town or The Second
Hundred Years still smiles nicely
and sports short hair is what CBS
calls "an athletic rendition" of
Perry Mason. But now he's got to
spout serious meaningful dialogue
(we'll criticize that later).
Either Markham is reading too
much into the scripts or he never
got to play Shakespeare. He
shouts "I object" loudly (that's
his best line) but all of his

speeches contain enough wind to
huff, puff, and blow the
courtroom down. Oh how we
wish they would!
Part of Markham's problems is
that he is surrounded by such
useless colleagues. Sharon Acker
poses well and is great to look at
but that's all Delia Street's role is
in this series. As Mason's private
secretary, if she does act it must
be off camera.
Bar-Hopping Detective
Albert Stratton as detective
Paul Drake, is not only a nothing
in his part, but he has no
distinguishing physical or vocal
characteristics. In short, he is
unnecessary, as Mason does most
of his own detective work. All
Drake does is spend a lot of tme
in bars.
Fortunately, there is one
exception to the overall poor
acting — Harry Guardino, who
plays district attorney Hamilton
Burger, recreates the character
with that same touch of likable
hostility that Bill Tallman used to
achieve. Unhappily, he has the
fewest lines. But even a drop of
water is welcome in the desert.
Speaking of deserts, this is the
only term adequate to describe
the minds of those who have
written scripts for this farce.
No More Genius
The old Perry Mason ingenious
was intriguing; now, that ingenius
system exists no longer. The first
episode is a classic esample of this
bumbling technique. Mason was
asked to attend a Crusade for
Christ meeting to chat with the
mother of Chris Baxter, a young
evangelist, who was being
blackmailed with a picture
apparently taken at a wild orgy.
Mason agrees to meet with the
blackmailer, who is found dead
when Perry enters the house in
time to confront Lt. Tragg.
Trudy, who loves Chris, is also
found at the house and brought in
as the murder suspect, the other
motive being that she had an
illegitimate child by the
blackmailer and didn't want Chris
to know. To shorten this
boredom, it eventually turns out

that a barkeep killed the
blackmailer to steal the money
that Mason was bringing — so
Trudy goes free and all is well.
With so much action occurring so
fast, we didn't know what was
coming off. True, it was all there
in front of us but the
superficiality made it meaningless.
Philosophical Platitudes
Adding to this type of flimsy,
confusing plot and the winning
theme music, we have to confront
Mason's platitudinal philosophical
tangents which slow us down even
more — statements like, "The
police are bungling fools in
detective stories, not anywhere
else." (Well, he should be an
expert on bungling fools). But
Perry Mason is not supposed to
deliver emotional outbursts — he
should stay cool.
Strangely enough, we're

supposed to believe he's cool in a
different sense — a real swinger.
Characters constantly mention
that they saw his name in the
newspaper and that "You didn't
get a Wilshire Boulevard office for
believing your clients." At this
rate, he may soon get an office in
the department of human
resources.
Perhaps we shouldn't compare
this series to the old one — but it's
impossible not to. And if this
show can't recreate the quality
perpetuated by the original, then
Perry Mason should be quickly
disbarred.
There is only one hope for the
new Perry; he and CBS executives
must take heed of what Perry
advised a client in the first
episode: "There's a big difference
between theater and theatrics."
