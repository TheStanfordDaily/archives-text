# 'Okie From Muskogee' Thrills Marine World
## 
### BRADLEY DICKINSON 
REDWOOD CITY - Merle
Haggard appeared at Marine World
on Saturday night, and his
performance was both
professional and bizarre.
Although he may be best
known to college students for two
arch-con servative tunes written
during the height of America's
insanity over Vietnam, Haggard is
a master of the country ballad,
both as author and performer.
Hailing from Bakersfield, he has
the ability to sing about the
problems of the working man, and
the composition of the audience
reflected his wide appeal.
Haggard is a charmer,
constantly reassuring an impatient
crowd that "Okie" will be on the
program, or glaring heavenward
upon feeling a raindrop as if to
say "I'm not finished yet," and
delaying a shower until after the
concert.
Haggard is a showman, raising
his guitar to the mike for a fancy
run he must have spent weeks on,
or dancing a jig during an
instrumental chorus.
Haggard is a singer with a
respect for the past greats of
country music, yodelling through
Jimmie Rodgers' "No Hard
Times" or fiddling through a Bob
Wills tune.
Haggard's backup band, the
Strangers, is one of the tightest
groups in country music, a hand a
fist over groups like the Tennessee
Three. They have the services of
two fine old country gentlemen
on guitar, Norman Hamlet playing
dobro and pedal steel and Roy
Nichols on lead.
Merle also brought along the
Dixieland Express, three young
gents on trumpet, clarinet and
trombone. This is the point at

which the concert became a bit
bizarre.
The idea of a Dixieland chorus
in the middle of "Workingman
Blues" or "Mama Tried" certainly
never had crossed my mind
before, yet there it was and in
Marineworld; maybe I'm not wild
enough.
My favorites, however,
remained pure. Haggard's own
favorite is "Today I Started
Loving You Again" and "Sing Me
Back Home" and "Silver Wings"
are two of his finest tunes.
The concert concluded with a
version of "Okie of Muskogee"
that bordered on self-parody.
Merle even slipped on the words
at one point.
"The Fighting Side of Me," his
most politically revolting song,
closed a two-number encore;
about one third of the audience
left and the rest put up enough
fuss to bring Haggard out for a
second encore of about eight
more numbers, a strange ending
for a fine concert.
