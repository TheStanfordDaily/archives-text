# Bowls Hollywood Over
## Elton John 'Puts On' Concert 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
The music was sincere,
beautifully performed. And even
Hollywood, with all its tinsel,
put-ons, rip-offs and phony
excitement couldn't detract from
the warmth and fullness of Elton
John's piano in his appearance at
the Hollywood Bowl Sept. 7.
The Bowl had been sold out for
weeks and over 5400 Elton fans
and groupies first had to brave a
chilly night and an even colder
warm-up group (Sutherland
Brothers and Quiver) to welcome
the English songwriter-pianist.
Things began to look up as
Deep Throat's Linda Lovelace
waltzed onstage. But instead of
just introducing the star, she
presented Hollywood extras
made-up to look like the Beatles,
Elvis, Frankenstein, the Pope,
among others, who strolled down
a golden staircase.
Next, white doves flew out of
five multi-colored fake pianos
lined up to spell E-L-T-O-N.
Costumed Prankster
Audience reactions to the
show-biz pranks ranged from
laughter to disgust, and Elton
John made his entrance just in
time. Dressed in silver-striped
white leader bells with a matching
white fur-collared vest, John
launched into an energetic
rendition of "Elderberry Wine."
Accompanied by the exact,
moving drumming of Nigel

Olsson, the loose bass of Dee
Murray, and the receeding lead
guitar of Davey Johnstone, John
impressed his audience, but never
reallyrockedthem until the end of
the show.
He jumped around the stage,
onto the piano, played on his
knees, kicked his bench out from
behind him, all in true style. But
even these seemed put-on at
times.
Successful Numbers
Musically, John was
magnificent. He played brilliant
piano and brought his music to
life without the massive
orchestration that has often
drowned out his technique in his
albums.
He kept most of his songs
("Daniel," "Rocket Man," "High
Flying Bird," "Hercules"), short,
close to the album versions.

Almost half of his songs in the
show came from his Don't Shoot
Me, I'm Only the Piano Player
album, but John found time to
introduce new songs.
He presented three cuts from
his Goodbye, Yellow Brick Road
album, his ninth, which should be
out any day now. Songs like
"Tender, Young Alice" and the
title track were beautiful, moving,
and memorable.
'Crocodile Rock'
The most exciting moments ill
the concert came with John
introducing his stage manager
dressed as a crocodile (more
Hollywood) for "Crocodile
Rock." In successive encores,
John broke out with his famous
flashing Elton glasses, "Saturday
Night's Alright for Fighting" and
the Rolling Stones' "Honky
Tonk Women." Both songs were
energetic with an infectious
rhythm that made people spill
into the aisles and dance.
John's only failures came with
his old songs: a choppy version of
"Your Song" (one of his oldest
hits, which drew cheers, but was
not really well sung) and
"Madman Across the Water"
(which was long, rambling and
poorly structured during the
instrumental breaks.)
