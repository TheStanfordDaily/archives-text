# Albert Rejects Request For House Agnew Probe
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Speaker
Carl Albert has rejected for the time
being any House action on Vice
President Spiro T. Agnew's request for
an investigation of charges he was
involved in political corruption in
Maryland.
That left a federal grand jury in
Baltimore as the only forum scheduled
to hear evidence on the allegations
against Agnew. Atty. Gen. Elliot L.

Richardson has ordered the panel to
begin hearing that evidence Thursday
morning.
Meanwhile, Agnew and the White
House disagreed over whether Agnew
and President Nixon had discussed the
Vice President's possible resignation,
according to the San Francisco
Examiner.
The Vice President denied that he
and Nixon had discussed the question
of Agnew's resignation; his statement
contradicted a report by Deputy Press
Secretary Gerald Warren that the two
had discussed the matter. Warren said
that Nixon neither encouraged nor
discouraged the idea.
'Not Resigning'
Agnew added, "I want to make it
very clear that I am not resigning."
The Vice President said he would hold
a news conference at some future date,
but did not say when.
Albert announced his decision on
Agnew's request in a statement
yesterday afternoon.
"The vice president's letter relates
to matters before the courts," the
statement said. "In view of that fact, I,
as Speaker, will not take any action on
the letter at this time." He refused to
elaborate or answer questions.
Agnew asked for the House
investigation Tuesday after secret
negotiations between Agnew's lawyers
and Justice Department officials broke
down and Atty. Gen. Elliot L.
Richardson announced he had
authorized a federal grand jury in
Baltimore to begin hearing the Agnew
case Thursday.
Might Reconsider
In rejecting Agnew's request for a
House hearing, Albert left open the
possibility that when Agnew's case is
no longer a matter for judicial action,
the House might reconsider the
decision if the facts warrant.
As leader of the Democratic
majority in the House, Albert's
personal decision is decisive providing
he can keep Democratic members
behind him. Albert made his
announcement aftc-r conferring with
other House Democratic leaders and
there were indications that decision

would not be challenged.
House Republican Leader Gerald R.
Ford of Michigan said he would not
try to forge any coalition to override
Albert's decision.
"If their ranks are solid and our
ranks are solid, we don't have the
votes," Ford said. "It's that simple."
Republican Lunch
The Vice President's remarks
yesterday came at a Capitol Hill
luncheon with ten liberal Republican
senators.
Sen. Mark O. Hatfield, R-Ore., host
for the luncheon, told a reporter later
that the senators met with Agnew for
more than an hour and that no one in
the group believed Albert's rejection
of Agnew's request was final or
irrevocable.
The White House said President
Nixon had neither encouraged nor
pressured Agnew to take any
particular course in responding to or
fighting the graft allegations against
him.
Rights 'Respected'
Deputy White House Press Secretary
Gerald L. Warren said he believed it
would be improper for the White
House to comment on Agnew's choice
of methods for fighting the graft
allegations but added that Nixon
"respects the vice president's rights
and privilege to handle this in his own
way."
On another matter, Warren said
Nixon did not concur or need to
concur in Richardson's decision to
take Justice Department evidence
against Agnew to the federal grand
jury in Baltimore.
Nixon "did not want to interject
himself into or interefere with the
judicial process and therefore it was
not a matter of the President
approving or concurring in the
attorney general's action," Warren
said.
Sleepy Lawyers
Congressional lawyers worked all
night researching precedents and
seeking opinions before Albert made
the announcement, Rep. Peter W.
Rodino, Jr., D-N.J. said yesterday.
Rodino, chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee, sat in on the
leadership sessions Tuesday and
yesterday after Agnew made his
surprise request.
In a statement amplified at a news
conference yesterday, Rodino backed
Albert's decision to take no action
now on Agnew's request.
Inappropriate Action
"It is my personal view as a lawyer
and a legislator that it would be
inappropriate for the Congress to take
any steps to impede the orderly
administration of justice in the
courts," Rodino said.
Rodino said a House inquiry,
whether or not it would block the
grand jury investigation of Agnew
scheduled to begin today, could at
least be used as an argument to do so.

Carl Albert has rejected for the time
being any House action on Vice
President Spiro T. Agnew's request for
an investigation of charges he was
involved in political corruption in
Maryland.
That left a federal grand jury in
Baltimore as the only forum scheduled
to hear evidence on the allegations
against Agnew. Atty. Gen. Elliot L.

Richardson has ordered the panel to
begin hearing that evidence Thursday
morning.
Meanwhile, Agnew and the White
House disagreed over whether Agnew
and President Nixon had discussed the
Vice President's possible resignation,
according to the San Francisco
Examiner.
The Vice President denied that he
and Nixon had discussed the question
of Agnew's resignation; his statement
contradicted a report by Deputy Press
Secretary Gerald Warren that the two
had discussed the matter. Warren said
that Nixon neither encouraged nor
discouraged the idea.
'Not Resigning'
Agnew added, "I want to make it
very clear that I am not resigning."
The Vice President said he would hold
a news conference at some future date,
but did not say when.
Albert announced his decision on
Agnew's request in a statement
yesterday afternoon.
"The vice president's letter relates
to matters before the courts," the
statement said. "In view of that fact, I,
as Speaker, will not take any action on
the letter at this time." He refused to
elaborate or answer questions.
Agnew asked for the House
investigation Tuesday after secret
negotiations between Agnew's lawyers
and Justice Department officials broke
down and Atty. Gen. Elliot L.
Richardson announced he had
authorized a federal grand jury in
Baltimore to begin hearing the Agnew
case Thursday.
Might Reconsider
In rejecting Agnew's request for a
House hearing, Albert left open the
possibility that when Agnew's case is
no longer a matter for judicial action,
the House might reconsider the
decision if the facts warrant.
As leader of the Democratic
majority in the House, Albert's
personal decision is decisive providing
he can keep Democratic members
behind him. Albert made his
announcement aftc-r conferring with
other House Democratic leaders and
there were indications that decision

would not be challenged.
House Republican Leader Gerald R.
Ford of Michigan said he would not
try to forge any coalition to override
Albert's decision.
"If their ranks are solid and our
ranks are solid, we don't have the
votes," Ford said. "It's that simple."
Republican Lunch
The Vice President's remarks
yesterday came at a Capitol Hill
luncheon with ten liberal Republican
senators.
Sen. Mark O. Hatfield, R-Ore., host
for the luncheon, told a reporter later
that the senators met with Agnew for
more than an hour and that no one in
the group believed Albert's rejection
of Agnew's request was final or
irrevocable.
The White House said President
Nixon had neither encouraged nor
pressured Agnew to take any
particular course in responding to or
fighting the graft allegations against
him.
Rights 'Respected'
Deputy White House Press Secretary
Gerald L. Warren said he believed it
would be improper for the White
House to comment on Agnew's choice
of methods for fighting the graft
allegations but added that Nixon
"respects the vice president's rights
and privilege to handle this in his own
way."
On another matter, Warren said
Nixon did not concur or need to
concur in Richardson's decision to
take Justice Department evidence
against Agnew to the federal grand
jury in Baltimore.
Nixon "did not want to interject
himself into or interefere with the
judicial process and therefore it was
not a matter of the President
approving or concurring in the
attorney general's action," Warren
said.
Sleepy Lawyers
Congressional lawyers worked all
night researching precedents and
seeking opinions before Albert made
the announcement, Rep. Peter W.
Rodino, Jr., D-N.J. said yesterday.
Rodino, chairman of the House
Judiciary Committee, sat in on the
leadership sessions Tuesday and
yesterday after Agnew made his
surprise request.
In a statement amplified at a news
conference yesterday, Rodino backed
Albert's decision to take no action
now on Agnew's request.
Inappropriate Action
"It is my personal view as a lawyer
and a legislator that it would be
inappropriate for the Congress to take
any steps to impede the orderly
administration of justice in the
courts," Rodino said.
Rodino said a House inquiry,
whether or not it would block the
grand jury investigation of Agnew
scheduled to begin today, could at
least be used as an argument to do so.
