Senate Rejects Troop Cutbacks
WASHINGTON — Overturning a vote taken earlier in
the day, the Senate yesterday rejected an attempt to force
a 40-percent cutback in U.S. land-based troops stationed
abroad.
A 49-46 vote yesterday morning had resulted in
tentative acceptance of the amendment by Senate
Democratic Leader Mike Mansfield. But a second vote was
necessary to tie the provision to the defense-procurement
authorization bill. That vote was 51 to 44 against the
amendment.
The amendment, strongly opposed by the Nixon
administration, would have directed that 188,400 of the
estimated 471,000 troops stationed abroad be withdrawn
by July 1,1976, with at least 47,100 being pulled back by
next July 1.
Mansfield, asked his reaction, said, "I have nothing to
say. We lost."
Asked how the votes were switched, he said: "You'll
have to ask the Defense Department, Gen. Goodpaster
and the White House." The reference was to Gen. Andrew
J. Goodpaster, the chief NATO commander. Mansfield
had said Schlesinger and other officials had undertaken
intensive lobbying.
Kissinger Winds Up UN Visit
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. - Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger focused his diplomacy on U.S.-European
relations yesterday while British and West German leaders
called for freer movement of people and ideas between
East and West.
Winding up a three-day visit to the United Nations,
Kissinger had a lunch date with Foreign Minister Michel
Jobert of France and an evening conference with West
German Chancellor Willy Brandt.
Kissinger already has reached agreement with the nine
European Common Market nations to begin formulation
of new declarations on economic and political
cooperation.
Insurgents Leaflet Phnom Penh
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Insurgent leaflets calling on
citizens to help overthrow the government were spread
yesterday among the people of Phnom Penh, police
sources disclosed.
The small, crudely printed leaflets warned residents to
stay clear of two areas in the city designated as targets for
attack. They declared, "Now it is time for all of us to
strike and help our liberation forces overthrow the Phnom
Penh traitors."
They did not designate any specific time for the attack.
The two targets identified in the leaflets were the United
Nations Bridge over the Bassac River on the southern
fringe of the city and the national broadcasting station at
Stung Mean Chey in the southwestern suburbs.
Chamberlain Signs With San Diego
CHULA VISTA, Calif. — Towering Wilt Chamberlain
jumped the Los Angeles Lakers yesterday and signed a
three-year contract as player-coach with the San Diego
Conquistadors for an estimated $600,000 per year.
Chamberlain had been in the National Basketball
Association since 1959 and three times was voted its most
valuable player.
"This job should be the biggest challenge of my life,"
the 37-year-old star declared. "I feel perfectly able to play
another 10 years if my mind and body hold out."
Monetary terms of the contract were not disclosed and
Chamberlain said he did not know if the Lakers of the
NBA would take legal action trying to stop him from
playing.
An official of the club indicated Los Angeles would not
oppose Chamberlain coaching but would fight any
attempt of his to play in the ABA during the 1973-74
season.
Skylab Astronauts 'Much Improved*
ABOARD USS NEW ORLEANS - The Skylab 2
astronauts, back on earth after a 59'/2-day space mission,
were "much improved and all in very good spirits," space
doctors said yesterday.
Astronauts Alan L. Bean, Jack R. Lousma and Owen K.
Garriott spent their first morning back on earth in more
than two months sleeping late in their quarters aboard this
prime recovery ship. They awoke about 7 a.m., just as the

New Orleans was entering port at San Diego, Calif.
After the ship tied up at a dock here, the spacemen
started a six-hour medical examination, their second since
they splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on Tuesday.
"We're impressed," said Dr. Paul Buchanan, one of the
space agency physicians on board here.
Garriott, he said, "looks very good."
Buchanan said, 'The other two are slightly down. Owen
has more bounce to the ounce. Jack trails him a little and
A 1 is just a notch behind Jack."
Buchanan Defends Tactics
WASHINGTON — Nixon campaign tactician Patrick J.
Buchanan said yesterday that ghost-written
advertisements, pranks and undercover operatives are
legitimate political weapons.
He denied to the Senate Watergate committee,
beginning the dirty tricks phase of its hearings, that he
pulled the strings on political sabotage in the 1972
campaign from his post as President Nixon's top speech
writer.
And he accused the committee of harboring "character
assassins" who he said orchestrated a campaign to malign
his reputation through the news media in advance of his
testimony.
"There are covert or clandestine activities in
intelligence in my view that there is nothing wrong with,"
Buchanan testified.
He conceded he directed the preparation of
advertisements that appeared in the name of various
committees, but added: "I've ghosted speeches for
presidents, for vice presidents, for senators. I've ghosted
letters to the editor. What's wrong with ghosting an ad
that people are willing to put their names on?"
He admitted freely that he had urged an early attack on
Sen. Edmund S. Muskie of Maine when he was the
front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination,
but said he was not aware of any political sabotage
campaign against Muskie or any other Democrat.
And he confirmed that he recommended measures to
counter tax-exempt organizations like the Ford
Foundation whose policies, he said, are "in basic
disagreement with our own political philosophy."
"I would recommend the President turn over such
grants to organizations which follow principles we believe
in, rather than to such as the Brookings Institution, which
in my judgment is a government in exile for the
Democratic Party," he said.
Buchanan said he was asked in summer 1971 to direct
an investigation of Pentagon Papers figure Daniel Ellsberg
but turned it down as "a waste of my time and my
abilities." He said he did not know that subsequently a
group of "plumbers" was set up for that purpose.
The committee had 34 memoranda, from Buchanan
and others, obtained elsewhere.
The documents showed:
— On March 24, 1971, Buchanan in a memo to the
President headed "the Muskie Watch" recommended that
the administration's interests "dictate smoking him out
now and keeping him in front as long as we can."
— On April 19, 1971, Buchanan told the President "I
believe that outside of the White House, we should keep
the heat on Big Ed. If, then, he does get the nomination,
he will be scarred — as to be politically ineffective."
— On July 28, 1971, deputy campaign director Jeb
Stuart Magruder wrote John N. Mitchell, then attorney
general, that "in Buchanan's view... if Muskie is
nominated, he should be painted 'as far left as possible.' "
Buchanan told the committee, "My recommendation
repeatedly was we ought not to do anything to Sen.
McGovern to impede his run for the presidency."
Buchanan said he found hilarious one project of placing
a large group of pregnant black women into the Miami
Beach convention area with signs saying "Nixon's the
One."
"Republicans were not responsible for the downfall of
Sen. Muskie," he said. "Republicans were not responsible
for the nomination of Sen. McGovern .... The McGovern
people won their own nomination and they lost their own
election.

Kissinger Winds Up UN Visit
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. - Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger focused his diplomacy on U.S.-European
relations yesterday while British and West German leaders
called for freer movement of people and ideas between
East and West.
Winding up a three-day visit to the United Nations,
Kissinger had a lunch date with Foreign Minister Michel
Jobert of France and an evening conference with West
German Chancellor Willy Brandt.
Kissinger already has reached agreement with the nine
European Common Market nations to begin formulation
of new declarations on economic and political
cooperation.
Insurgents Leaflet Phnom Penh
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Insurgent leaflets calling on
citizens to help overthrow the government were spread
yesterday among the people of Phnom Penh, police
sources disclosed.
The small, crudely printed leaflets warned residents to
stay clear of two areas in the city designated as targets for
attack. They declared, "Now it is time for all of us to
strike and help our liberation forces overthrow the Phnom
Penh traitors."
They did not designate any specific time for the attack.
The two targets identified in the leaflets were the United
Nations Bridge over the Bassac River on the southern
fringe of the city and the national broadcasting station at
Stung Mean Chey in the southwestern suburbs.
Chamberlain Signs With San Diego
CHULA VISTA, Calif. — Towering Wilt Chamberlain
jumped the Los Angeles Lakers yesterday and signed a
three-year contract as player-coach with the San Diego
Conquistadors for an estimated $600,000 per year.
Chamberlain had been in the National Basketball
Association since 1959 and three times was voted its most
valuable player.
"This job should be the biggest challenge of my life,"
the 37-year-old star declared. "I feel perfectly able to play
another 10 years if my mind and body hold out."
Monetary terms of the contract were not disclosed and
Chamberlain said he did not know if the Lakers of the
NBA would take legal action trying to stop him from
playing.
An official of the club indicated Los Angeles would not
oppose Chamberlain coaching but would fight any
attempt of his to play in the ABA during the 1973-74
season.
Skylab Astronauts 'Much Improved*
ABOARD USS NEW ORLEANS - The Skylab 2
astronauts, back on earth after a 59'/2-day space mission,
were "much improved and all in very good spirits," space
doctors said yesterday.
Astronauts Alan L. Bean, Jack R. Lousma and Owen K.
Garriott spent their first morning back on earth in more
than two months sleeping late in their quarters aboard this
prime recovery ship. They awoke about 7 a.m., just as the

New Orleans was entering port at San Diego, Calif.
After the ship tied up at a dock here, the spacemen
started a six-hour medical examination, their second since
they splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on Tuesday.
"We're impressed," said Dr. Paul Buchanan, one of the
space agency physicians on board here.
Garriott, he said, "looks very good."
Buchanan said, 'The other two are slightly down. Owen
has more bounce to the ounce. Jack trails him a little and
A 1 is just a notch behind Jack."
Buchanan Defends Tactics
WASHINGTON — Nixon campaign tactician Patrick J.
Buchanan said yesterday that ghost-written
advertisements, pranks and undercover operatives are
legitimate political weapons.
He denied to the Senate Watergate committee,
beginning the dirty tricks phase of its hearings, that he
pulled the strings on political sabotage in the 1972
campaign from his post as President Nixon's top speech
writer.
And he accused the committee of harboring "character
assassins" who he said orchestrated a campaign to malign
his reputation through the news media in advance of his
testimony.
"There are covert or clandestine activities in
intelligence in my view that there is nothing wrong with,"
Buchanan testified.
He conceded he directed the preparation of
advertisements that appeared in the name of various
committees, but added: "I've ghosted speeches for
presidents, for vice presidents, for senators. I've ghosted
letters to the editor. What's wrong with ghosting an ad
that people are willing to put their names on?"
He admitted freely that he had urged an early attack on
Sen. Edmund S. Muskie of Maine when he was the
front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination,
but said he was not aware of any political sabotage
campaign against Muskie or any other Democrat.
And he confirmed that he recommended measures to
counter tax-exempt organizations like the Ford
Foundation whose policies, he said, are "in basic
disagreement with our own political philosophy."
"I would recommend the President turn over such
grants to organizations which follow principles we believe
in, rather than to such as the Brookings Institution, which
in my judgment is a government in exile for the
Democratic Party," he said.
Buchanan said he was asked in summer 1971 to direct
an investigation of Pentagon Papers figure Daniel Ellsberg
but turned it down as "a waste of my time and my
abilities." He said he did not know that subsequently a
group of "plumbers" was set up for that purpose.
The committee had 34 memoranda, from Buchanan
and others, obtained elsewhere.
The documents showed:
— On March 24, 1971, Buchanan in a memo to the
President headed "the Muskie Watch" recommended that
the administration's interests "dictate smoking him out
now and keeping him in front as long as we can."
— On April 19, 1971, Buchanan told the President "I
believe that outside of the White House, we should keep
the heat on Big Ed. If, then, he does get the nomination,
he will be scarred — as to be politically ineffective."
— On July 28, 1971, deputy campaign director Jeb
Stuart Magruder wrote John N. Mitchell, then attorney
general, that "in Buchanan's view... if Muskie is
nominated, he should be painted 'as far left as possible.' "
Buchanan told the committee, "My recommendation
repeatedly was we ought not to do anything to Sen.
McGovern to impede his run for the presidency."
Buchanan said he found hilarious one project of placing
a large group of pregnant black women into the Miami
Beach convention area with signs saying "Nixon's the
One."
"Republicans were not responsible for the downfall of
Sen. Muskie," he said. "Republicans were not responsible
for the nomination of Sen. McGovern .... The McGovern
people won their own nomination and they lost their own
election.

Senate Rejects Troop Cutbacks
WASHINGTON — Overturning a vote taken earlier in
the day, the Senate yesterday rejected an attempt to force
a 40-percent cutback in U.S. land-based troops stationed
abroad.
A 49-46 vote yesterday morning had resulted in
tentative acceptance of the amendment by Senate
Democratic Leader Mike Mansfield. But a second vote was
necessary to tie the provision to the defense-procurement
authorization bill. That vote was 51 to 44 against the
amendment.
The amendment, strongly opposed by the Nixon
administration, would have directed that 188,400 of the
estimated 471,000 troops stationed abroad be withdrawn
by July 1,1976, with at least 47,100 being pulled back by
next July 1.
Mansfield, asked his reaction, said, "I have nothing to
say. We lost."

The small, crudely printed leaflets warned residents to
stay clear of two areas in the city designated as targets for
attack. They declared, "Now it is time for all of us to
strike and help our liberation forces overthrow the Phnom
Penh traitors."
They did not designate any specific time for the attack.
The two targets identified in the leaflets were the United
Nations Bridge over the Bassac River on the southern
fringe of the city and the national broadcasting station at
Stung Mean Chey in the southwestern suburbs.
Chamberlain Signs With San Diego
CHULA VISTA, Calif. — Towering Wilt Chamberlain
jumped the Los Angeles Lakers yesterday and signed a
three-year contract as player-coach with the San Diego
Conquistadors for an estimated $600,000 per year.
Chamberlain had been in the National Basketball
Association since 1959 and three times was voted its most
valuable player.
"This job should be the biggest challenge of my life,"
the 37-year-old star declared. "I feel perfectly able to play
another 10 years if my mind and body hold out."
Monetary terms of the contract were not disclosed and
Chamberlain said he did not know if the Lakers of the
NBA would take legal action trying to stop him from
playing.
An official of the club indicated Los Angeles would not
oppose Chamberlain coaching but would fight any
attempt of his to play in the ABA during the 1973-74
season.
Skylab Astronauts 'Much Improved*
ABOARD USS NEW ORLEANS - The Skylab 2
astronauts, back on earth after a 59'/2-day space mission,
were "much improved and all in very good spirits," space
doctors said yesterday.
Astronauts Alan L. Bean, Jack R. Lousma and Owen K.
Garriott spent their first morning back on earth in more
than two months sleeping late in their quarters aboard this
prime recovery ship. They awoke about 7 a.m., just as the

New Orleans was entering port at San Diego, Calif.
After the ship tied up at a dock here, the spacemen
started a six-hour medical examination, their second since
they splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on Tuesday.
"We're impressed," said Dr. Paul Buchanan, one of the
space agency physicians on board here.
Garriott, he said, "looks very good."
Buchanan said, 'The other two are slightly down. Owen
has more bounce to the ounce. Jack trails him a little and
A 1 is just a notch behind Jack."
Buchanan Defends Tactics
WASHINGTON — Nixon campaign tactician Patrick J.
Buchanan said yesterday that ghost-written
advertisements, pranks and undercover operatives are
legitimate political weapons.
He denied to the Senate Watergate committee,
beginning the dirty tricks phase of its hearings, that he
pulled the strings on political sabotage in the 1972
campaign from his post as President Nixon's top speech
writer.
And he accused the committee of harboring "character
assassins" who he said orchestrated a campaign to malign
his reputation through the news media in advance of his
testimony.
"There are covert or clandestine activities in
intelligence in my view that there is nothing wrong with,"
Buchanan testified.
He conceded he directed the preparation of
advertisements that appeared in the name of various
committees, but added: "I've ghosted speeches for
presidents, for vice presidents, for senators. I've ghosted
letters to the editor. What's wrong with ghosting an ad
that people are willing to put their names on?"
He admitted freely that he had urged an early attack on
Sen. Edmund S. Muskie of Maine when he was the
front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination,
but said he was not aware of any political sabotage
campaign against Muskie or any other Democrat.
And he confirmed that he recommended measures to
counter tax-exempt organizations like the Ford
Foundation whose policies, he said, are "in basic
disagreement with our own political philosophy."
"I would recommend the President turn over such
grants to organizations which follow principles we believe
in, rather than to such as the Brookings Institution, which
in my judgment is a government in exile for the
Democratic Party," he said.
Buchanan said he was asked in summer 1971 to direct
an investigation of Pentagon Papers figure Daniel Ellsberg
but turned it down as "a waste of my time and my
abilities." He said he did not know that subsequently a
group of "plumbers" was set up for that purpose.
The committee had 34 memoranda, from Buchanan
and others, obtained elsewhere.
The documents showed:
— On March 24, 1971, Buchanan in a memo to the
President headed "the Muskie Watch" recommended that
the administration's interests "dictate smoking him out
now and keeping him in front as long as we can."
— On April 19, 1971, Buchanan told the President "I
believe that outside of the White House, we should keep
the heat on Big Ed. If, then, he does get the nomination,
he will be scarred — as to be politically ineffective."
— On July 28, 1971, deputy campaign director Jeb
Stuart Magruder wrote John N. Mitchell, then attorney
general, that "in Buchanan's view... if Muskie is
nominated, he should be painted 'as far left as possible.' "
Buchanan told the committee, "My recommendation
repeatedly was we ought not to do anything to Sen.
McGovern to impede his run for the presidency."
Buchanan said he found hilarious one project of placing
a large group of pregnant black women into the Miami
Beach convention area with signs saying "Nixon's the
One."
"Republicans were not responsible for the downfall of
Sen. Muskie," he said. "Republicans were not responsible
for the nomination of Sen. McGovern .... The McGovern
people won their own nomination and they lost their own
election.

Senate Rejects Troop Cutbacks
WASHINGTON — Overturning a vote taken earlier in
the day, the Senate yesterday rejected an attempt to force
a 40-percent cutback in U.S. land-based troops stationed
abroad.
A 49-46 vote yesterday morning had resulted in
tentative acceptance of the amendment by Senate
Democratic Leader Mike Mansfield. But a second vote was
necessary to tie the provision to the defense-procurement
authorization bill. That vote was 51 to 44 against the
amendment.
The amendment, strongly opposed by the Nixon
administration, would have directed that 188,400 of the
estimated 471,000 troops stationed abroad be withdrawn
by July 1,1976, with at least 47,100 being pulled back by
next July 1.
Mansfield, asked his reaction, said, "I have nothing to
say. We lost."
Asked how the votes were switched, he said: "You'll
have to ask the Defense Department, Gen. Goodpaster
and the White House." The reference was to Gen. Andrew
J. Goodpaster, the chief NATO commander. Mansfield
had said Schlesinger and other officials had undertaken
intensive lobbying.

another 10 years if my mind and body hold out."
Monetary terms of the contract were not disclosed and
Chamberlain said he did not know if the Lakers of the
NBA would take legal action trying to stop him from
playing.
An official of the club indicated Los Angeles would not
oppose Chamberlain coaching but would fight any
attempt of his to play in the ABA during the 1973-74
season.
Skylab Astronauts 'Much Improved*
ABOARD USS NEW ORLEANS - The Skylab 2
astronauts, back on earth after a 59'/2-day space mission,
were "much improved and all in very good spirits," space
doctors said yesterday.
Astronauts Alan L. Bean, Jack R. Lousma and Owen K.
Garriott spent their first morning back on earth in more
than two months sleeping late in their quarters aboard this
prime recovery ship. They awoke about 7 a.m., just as the

New Orleans was entering port at San Diego, Calif.
After the ship tied up at a dock here, the spacemen
started a six-hour medical examination, their second since
they splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on Tuesday.
"We're impressed," said Dr. Paul Buchanan, one of the
space agency physicians on board here.
Garriott, he said, "looks very good."
Buchanan said, 'The other two are slightly down. Owen
has more bounce to the ounce. Jack trails him a little and
A 1 is just a notch behind Jack."
Buchanan Defends Tactics
WASHINGTON — Nixon campaign tactician Patrick J.
Buchanan said yesterday that ghost-written
advertisements, pranks and undercover operatives are
legitimate political weapons.
He denied to the Senate Watergate committee,
beginning the dirty tricks phase of its hearings, that he
pulled the strings on political sabotage in the 1972
campaign from his post as President Nixon's top speech
writer.
And he accused the committee of harboring "character
assassins" who he said orchestrated a campaign to malign
his reputation through the news media in advance of his
testimony.
"There are covert or clandestine activities in
intelligence in my view that there is nothing wrong with,"
Buchanan testified.
He conceded he directed the preparation of
advertisements that appeared in the name of various
committees, but added: "I've ghosted speeches for
presidents, for vice presidents, for senators. I've ghosted
letters to the editor. What's wrong with ghosting an ad
that people are willing to put their names on?"
He admitted freely that he had urged an early attack on
Sen. Edmund S. Muskie of Maine when he was the
front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination,
but said he was not aware of any political sabotage
campaign against Muskie or any other Democrat.
And he confirmed that he recommended measures to
counter tax-exempt organizations like the Ford
Foundation whose policies, he said, are "in basic
disagreement with our own political philosophy."
"I would recommend the President turn over such
grants to organizations which follow principles we believe
in, rather than to such as the Brookings Institution, which
in my judgment is a government in exile for the
Democratic Party," he said.
Buchanan said he was asked in summer 1971 to direct
an investigation of Pentagon Papers figure Daniel Ellsberg
but turned it down as "a waste of my time and my
abilities." He said he did not know that subsequently a
group of "plumbers" was set up for that purpose.
The committee had 34 memoranda, from Buchanan
and others, obtained elsewhere.
The documents showed:
— On March 24, 1971, Buchanan in a memo to the
President headed "the Muskie Watch" recommended that
the administration's interests "dictate smoking him out
now and keeping him in front as long as we can."
— On April 19, 1971, Buchanan told the President "I
believe that outside of the White House, we should keep
the heat on Big Ed. If, then, he does get the nomination,
he will be scarred — as to be politically ineffective."
— On July 28, 1971, deputy campaign director Jeb
Stuart Magruder wrote John N. Mitchell, then attorney
general, that "in Buchanan's view... if Muskie is
nominated, he should be painted 'as far left as possible.' "
Buchanan told the committee, "My recommendation
repeatedly was we ought not to do anything to Sen.
McGovern to impede his run for the presidency."
Buchanan said he found hilarious one project of placing
a large group of pregnant black women into the Miami
Beach convention area with signs saying "Nixon's the
One."
"Republicans were not responsible for the downfall of
Sen. Muskie," he said. "Republicans were not responsible
for the nomination of Sen. McGovern .... The McGovern
people won their own nomination and they lost their own
election.

Senate Rejects Troop Cutbacks
WASHINGTON — Overturning a vote taken earlier in
the day, the Senate yesterday rejected an attempt to force
a 40-percent cutback in U.S. land-based troops stationed
abroad.
A 49-46 vote yesterday morning had resulted in
tentative acceptance of the amendment by Senate
Democratic Leader Mike Mansfield. But a second vote was
necessary to tie the provision to the defense-procurement
authorization bill. That vote was 51 to 44 against the
amendment.
The amendment, strongly opposed by the Nixon
administration, would have directed that 188,400 of the
estimated 471,000 troops stationed abroad be withdrawn
by July 1,1976, with at least 47,100 being pulled back by
next July 1.
Mansfield, asked his reaction, said, "I have nothing to
say. We lost."
Asked how the votes were switched, he said: "You'll
have to ask the Defense Department, Gen. Goodpaster
and the White House." The reference was to Gen. Andrew
J. Goodpaster, the chief NATO commander. Mansfield
had said Schlesinger and other officials had undertaken
intensive lobbying.
Kissinger Winds Up UN Visit
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. - Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger focused his diplomacy on U.S.-European
relations yesterday while British and West German leaders
called for freer movement of people and ideas between
East and West.
Winding up a three-day visit to the United Nations,
Kissinger had a lunch date with Foreign Minister Michel
Jobert of France and an evening conference with West
German Chancellor Willy Brandt.
Kissinger already has reached agreement with the nine
European Common Market nations to begin formulation
of new declarations on economic and political
cooperation.
Insurgents Leaflet Phnom Penh
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Insurgent leaflets calling on
citizens to help overthrow the government were spread
yesterday among the people of Phnom Penh, police
sources disclosed.
The small, crudely printed leaflets warned residents to
stay clear of two areas in the city designated as targets for
attack. They declared, "Now it is time for all of us to
strike and help our liberation forces overthrow the Phnom
Penh traitors."
They did not designate any specific time for the attack.
The two targets identified in the leaflets were the United
Nations Bridge over the Bassac River on the southern
fringe of the city and the national broadcasting station at
Stung Mean Chey in the southwestern suburbs.
Chamberlain Signs With San Diego
CHULA VISTA, Calif. — Towering Wilt Chamberlain
jumped the Los Angeles Lakers yesterday and signed a
three-year contract as player-coach with the San Diego
Conquistadors for an estimated $600,000 per year.
Chamberlain had been in the National Basketball
Association since 1959 and three times was voted its most
valuable player.
"This job should be the biggest challenge of my life,"
the 37-year-old star declared. "I feel perfectly able to play
another 10 years if my mind and body hold out."
Monetary terms of the contract were not disclosed and
Chamberlain said he did not know if the Lakers of the
NBA would take legal action trying to stop him from
playing.
An official of the club indicated Los Angeles would not
oppose Chamberlain coaching but would fight any
attempt of his to play in the ABA during the 1973-74
