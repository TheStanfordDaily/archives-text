# Flicks Try New Plan
## 
### 
The ASSU Sunday Flicks will
institute a new seating system at
Memorial Auditorium this fall,
Manager Bob Sisson has announced.
Under this new system, season
pass-holders will be able to use express
lines to be seated more quickly.
The season passes will be on sale for
$5.50 and will be available at Mem
Aud on Sunday evening. The passes
are good for all 11 movies, and they
will be transferable. No passes will be
sold after Sunday evening, Sisson said.
To avoid seating confusion between
shows, Sisson plans to extend the time

presently allowed for clearing the
auditorium. He says the break will now
last 20 to 25 minutes.
Sisson plans to continue the policy
to restrict admission of non-students
under the age of 18 without parent or
guardian. "The movies are a lot less
rowdy without the kids," Sisson
explained. This policy started last year
after several incidents involving youths
from the local area.
The admission price of the Flicks
will remain 50c. Sisson declined to
make any forecasts for the finances of
the Flicks, but said the series broke
even over the summer.
