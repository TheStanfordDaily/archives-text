# Chilean Diplomat Lauds Allende, Denies Failure Of 'Experiment'
## 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
Chilean scholar-diplomat Fernando
Alegria declared last night that "the
Chilean experiment has not failed ... I
don't think progressive forces have lost
the final decision."
Alegria, formerly a cultural attache
at the Chilean embassy in Washington
and now a professor of Spanish here,
was the final speaker in a "Chile
Teach-In" that packed Cubberley
Auditorium to the rafters — and which
was punctuated by an apparent bomb
threat.
"President Allende died the death
of a fighter," Alegria said, denying
reports by the military junta which
overthrew Allende's Marxist regime
that Allende committed suicide.
"Allende told the Chilean people to
understand the personal sacrifice he
was about to perform, and all of us
who knew Salvador Allende knew that

could only mean one thing: he was
going to get out of the Presidency of
Chile in 1976 [the end of his legal
term of office], because he was the
legally elected head of the Chilean
people. And he also meant that if
force was used, there was only one
way they were going to get him out.
And that was dead."
Coup Background Discussed
Other speakers discussed the
economic and political background of
the Sept. 11 coup, charged the United
States with a role in the coup, and
scored the junta's treatment of
political opponents.
"The military decided to kill the
duly-elected president of Chile and to
begin the worst slaughter in
Latin-American history since the
Mexican Revolution," Associate
Professor of Education Martin Carnoy
declared. "We believe that in two days,
20,000 Chileans lost their lives. We
now know that many Chilean citizens
are being held by the army, and that
many are being tortured and killed."
The junta, which seized power in a
bloody attack on downtown Santiago

that — depending on which account
you read — may or may not have met
stiff resistance, quickly outlawed all
Marxist parties and arrested thousands
of anticipated opponents. Yesterday
the new regime disbanded Chile's
largest labor federation and declared a
"State of Internal War," granting itself
sweeping powers of arrest and
detention.
'Rule By Terror'
The junta, said Patricia Fagen,
professor of Latin American Studies at
California State University, San Jose,
is ruling "by extreme terror, by
murder, and by the physical
elimination of all those it considers to
be its chief rivals."
Much of the blame, said Political
Science Professor Richard Fagen and
Pacific Studies Center associate
Jonathan Marshall, a sophomore in
political science, must fall to the
United States.
"The United States government is,
was, and will be deeply implicated in
Chilean affairs," Fagen charged, "and
almost without exception implicated
on the wrong side, from the humane
or humanitarian viewpoint."
Marshall said American aid to Chile
from 1950 to 1970 "was not directed
toward helping the poor, but toward
helping the middle class, in an attempt
to build up the middle class as a
non-communist alternative." The
second major focus of American aid,
Marshall said, was support of the
Chilean military.
Marshall cited the Chilean
economy's need for U.S. dollars, and
charged that the United States
deliberately sabotaged the Chilean
economy by cutting off economic aid
and loans by the World Bank and
International Development
Association. "[World Bank President
and former Secretary of Defense]
Robert McNamara argued that Chile
was a bad credit risk, despite 8.5
percent growth under Allende and
despite a sudden increase in American
aid to the Chilean military," Marshall
said.
Marshall also quoted from a
fascinating series of International
Telephone & Telegraph Corp. (ITT)
memoranda. ITT, which had massive
financial holdings in Chile before
Allende's government nationalized the
company, was revealed in United
States Senate hearings this spring to
have sought CIA participation in an

attempt to prevent Allende's election.
"Undercover attempts are being
made to bring about the bankruptcy
of one or two of the major savings and
loan associations [in Chile]," a Sept.
29, 1970, memorandum read.
"Massive unemployment and unrest
might produce enough violence to
force the military to move."
The almost bomb threat was
announced to the overflow audience at
8:10, in the middle of a film about the
political and economic organization of
a Chilean slum. The audience was
asked to look under its seats for
suspicious objects. It did.
"We received a call at the station at
about 8 o'clock," Stanford Public
Safety Sgt. R.A. Sanguinetti said.
"When we played the tape back, we
heard him say, 'There'll be a lot of
dead Commies in Cubberley in about
15 minutes.' "
Public Safety Department
spokesmen said it is not University
policy to evacuate a building unless an
actual, expressed bomb threat is made.
In cases of ambiguous threats, police
allow a program's sponsors — in this
case, the Concerned Latin American
Scholars at Stanford, the Faculty
Political Action Group, and the
Stanford Committee on Political
Education (SCOPE) to decide what
action should be taken.

the Sept. 11 coup, charged the United
States with a role in the coup, and
scored the junta's treatment of
political opponents.
"The military decided to kill the
duly-elected president of Chile and to
begin the worst slaughter in
Latin-American history since the
Mexican Revolution," Associate
Professor of Education Martin Carnoy
declared. "We believe that in two days,
20,000 Chileans lost their lives. We
now know that many Chilean citizens
are being held by the army, and that
many are being tortured and killed."
The junta, which seized power in a
bloody attack on downtown Santiago

that — depending on which account
you read — may or may not have met
stiff resistance, quickly outlawed all
Marxist parties and arrested thousands
of anticipated opponents. Yesterday
the new regime disbanded Chile's
largest labor federation and declared a
"State of Internal War," granting itself
sweeping powers of arrest and
detention.
'Rule By Terror'
The junta, said Patricia Fagen,
professor of Latin American Studies at
California State University, San Jose,
is ruling "by extreme terror, by
murder, and by the physical
elimination of all those it considers to
be its chief rivals."
Much of the blame, said Political
Science Professor Richard Fagen and
Pacific Studies Center associate
Jonathan Marshall, a sophomore in
political science, must fall to the
United States.
"The United States government is,
was, and will be deeply implicated in
Chilean affairs," Fagen charged, "and
almost without exception implicated
on the wrong side, from the humane
or humanitarian viewpoint."
Marshall said American aid to Chile
from 1950 to 1970 "was not directed
toward helping the poor, but toward
helping the middle class, in an attempt
to build up the middle class as a
non-communist alternative." The
second major focus of American aid,
Marshall said, was support of the
Chilean military.
Marshall cited the Chilean
economy's need for U.S. dollars, and
charged that the United States
deliberately sabotaged the Chilean
economy by cutting off economic aid
and loans by the World Bank and
International Development
Association. "[World Bank President
and former Secretary of Defense]
Robert McNamara argued that Chile
was a bad credit risk, despite 8.5
percent growth under Allende and
despite a sudden increase in American
aid to the Chilean military," Marshall
said.
Marshall also quoted from a
fascinating series of International
Telephone & Telegraph Corp. (ITT)
memoranda. ITT, which had massive
financial holdings in Chile before
Allende's government nationalized the
company, was revealed in United
States Senate hearings this spring to
have sought CIA participation in an

attempt to prevent Allende's election.
"Undercover attempts are being
made to bring about the bankruptcy
of one or two of the major savings and
loan associations [in Chile]," a Sept.
29, 1970, memorandum read.
"Massive unemployment and unrest
might produce enough violence to
force the military to move."
The almost bomb threat was
announced to the overflow audience at
8:10, in the middle of a film about the
political and economic organization of
a Chilean slum. The audience was
asked to look under its seats for
suspicious objects. It did.
"We received a call at the station at
about 8 o'clock," Stanford Public
Safety Sgt. R.A. Sanguinetti said.
"When we played the tape back, we
heard him say, 'There'll be a lot of
dead Commies in Cubberley in about
15 minutes.' "
Public Safety Department
spokesmen said it is not University
policy to evacuate a building unless an
actual, expressed bomb threat is made.
In cases of ambiguous threats, police
allow a program's sponsors — in this
case, the Concerned Latin American
Scholars at Stanford, the Faculty
Political Action Group, and the
Stanford Committee on Political
Education (SCOPE) to decide what
action should be taken.
Chilean scholar-diplomat Fernando
Alegria declared last night that "the
Chilean experiment has not failed ... I
don't think progressive forces have lost
the final decision."
Alegria, formerly a cultural attache
at the Chilean embassy in Washington
and now a professor of Spanish here,
was the final speaker in a "Chile
Teach-In" that packed Cubberley
Auditorium to the rafters — and which
was punctuated by an apparent bomb
threat.
"President Allende died the death
of a fighter," Alegria said, denying
reports by the military junta which
overthrew Allende's Marxist regime
that Allende committed suicide.
"Allende told the Chilean people to
understand the personal sacrifice he
was about to perform, and all of us
who knew Salvador Allende knew that

could only mean one thing: he was
going to get out of the Presidency of
Chile in 1976 [the end of his legal
term of office], because he was the
legally elected head of the Chilean
people. And he also meant that if
force was used, there was only one
way they were going to get him out.
And that was dead."

Jonathan Marshall, a sophomore in
political science, must fall to the
United States.
"The United States government is,
was, and will be deeply implicated in
Chilean affairs," Fagen charged, "and
almost without exception implicated
on the wrong side, from the humane
or humanitarian viewpoint."
Marshall said American aid to Chile
from 1950 to 1970 "was not directed
toward helping the poor, but toward
helping the middle class, in an attempt
to build up the middle class as a
non-communist alternative." The
second major focus of American aid,
Marshall said, was support of the
Chilean military.
Marshall cited the Chilean
economy's need for U.S. dollars, and
charged that the United States
deliberately sabotaged the Chilean
economy by cutting off economic aid
and loans by the World Bank and
International Development
Association. "[World Bank President
and former Secretary of Defense]
Robert McNamara argued that Chile
was a bad credit risk, despite 8.5
percent growth under Allende and
despite a sudden increase in American
aid to the Chilean military," Marshall
said.
Marshall also quoted from a
fascinating series of International
Telephone & Telegraph Corp. (ITT)
memoranda. ITT, which had massive
financial holdings in Chile before
Allende's government nationalized the
company, was revealed in United
States Senate hearings this spring to
have sought CIA participation in an

attempt to prevent Allende's election.
"Undercover attempts are being
made to bring about the bankruptcy
of one or two of the major savings and
loan associations [in Chile]," a Sept.
29, 1970, memorandum read.
"Massive unemployment and unrest
might produce enough violence to
force the military to move."
The almost bomb threat was
announced to the overflow audience at
8:10, in the middle of a film about the
political and economic organization of
a Chilean slum. The audience was
asked to look under its seats for
suspicious objects. It did.
"We received a call at the station at
about 8 o'clock," Stanford Public
Safety Sgt. R.A. Sanguinetti said.
"When we played the tape back, we
heard him say, 'There'll be a lot of
dead Commies in Cubberley in about
15 minutes.' "
Public Safety Department
spokesmen said it is not University
policy to evacuate a building unless an
actual, expressed bomb threat is made.
In cases of ambiguous threats, police
allow a program's sponsors — in this
case, the Concerned Latin American
Scholars at Stanford, the Faculty
Political Action Group, and the
Stanford Committee on Political
Education (SCOPE) to decide what
action should be taken.
Chilean scholar-diplomat Fernando
Alegria declared last night that "the
Chilean experiment has not failed ... I
don't think progressive forces have lost
the final decision."
Alegria, formerly a cultural attache
at the Chilean embassy in Washington
and now a professor of Spanish here,
was the final speaker in a "Chile
Teach-In" that packed Cubberley
Auditorium to the rafters — and which
was punctuated by an apparent bomb
threat.
"President Allende died the death
of a fighter," Alegria said, denying
reports by the military junta which
overthrew Allende's Marxist regime
that Allende committed suicide.
"Allende told the Chilean people to
understand the personal sacrifice he
was about to perform, and all of us
who knew Salvador Allende knew that

could only mean one thing: he was
going to get out of the Presidency of
Chile in 1976 [the end of his legal
term of office], because he was the
legally elected head of the Chilean
people. And he also meant that if
force was used, there was only one
way they were going to get him out.
And that was dead."
Coup Background Discussed
Other speakers discussed the
economic and political background of
the Sept. 11 coup, charged the United
States with a role in the coup, and
scored the junta's treatment of
political opponents.
"The military decided to kill the
duly-elected president of Chile and to
begin the worst slaughter in
Latin-American history since the
Mexican Revolution," Associate
Professor of Education Martin Carnoy
declared. "We believe that in two days,
20,000 Chileans lost their lives. We
now know that many Chilean citizens
are being held by the army, and that
many are being tortured and killed."
The junta, which seized power in a
bloody attack on downtown Santiago

that — depending on which account
you read — may or may not have met
stiff resistance, quickly outlawed all
Marxist parties and arrested thousands
of anticipated opponents. Yesterday
the new regime disbanded Chile's
largest labor federation and declared a
"State of Internal War," granting itself
sweeping powers of arrest and
detention.
'Rule By Terror'
The junta, said Patricia Fagen,
professor of Latin American Studies at
California State University, San Jose,
is ruling "by extreme terror, by
murder, and by the physical
elimination of all those it considers to
be its chief rivals."
Much of the blame, said Political
Science Professor Richard Fagen and
Pacific Studies Center associate
Jonathan Marshall, a sophomore in
political science, must fall to the
United States.
"The United States government is,
was, and will be deeply implicated in
Chilean affairs," Fagen charged, "and
almost without exception implicated
on the wrong side, from the humane
or humanitarian viewpoint."
