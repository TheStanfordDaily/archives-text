# Fate Of 'Big Dish' Remains Doubtful
## 
### CLAIRE SPIEGEL 
The "Big Dish" in the Stanford foothills gazes
majestically toward the heavens — undaunted by
rumors that the enormous radiotelescope has
outlived its scientific usefulness and that its demise
is near.
A local newspaper has labeled the 150-foot
radiotelescope "a relic" and reported that the Dish
will be dismantled within two years. But Tom Croft,
senior research associate in the University's radio
science laboratory, contradicted those statements.
"There is no present plan to dismantle it,"he said.
Conceding that the Dish has almost completed its
present assignments, Ray Leadabrand, executive
director of the electronic and radio sciences division
at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI), said,
"There is a high probability that we will find other
uses for the Big Dish."
The problem is not that the Dish is scientifically
obsolete. Croft said, but that financial support may
not be forthcoming. "It's a problem of national
priorities being redirected towards objectives that
the Dish doesn't serve. There's a general feeling that
financial support for this kind of work is
disappearing, but I think the benefit is worth the
cost."
The Dish was built 12 years ago on an Air Force
contract at a cost of $500,000. SRI and the

government will ultimately decide its fate, with the
government having the "final say," Leadabrand
commented.
At the time of its construction, calculations
indicated that the scrap value of the antenna would
probably pay for its dismantling and for the
restoration of the site to its natural state.
According to Leadabrand, "It's least likely that it
will be tom down and scrapped; more likely that it
will be used for other assignments; and most likely
it will be torn down, reassembled and used
elsewhere."
Not Economical
Croft pointed out, "It's not economical to tear
the whole thing down, compared with the cost of
building an entirely new one." Croft mentioned he
has a project which, if accepted by the government,
would "put the Dish back in business."
The main functions of the radiotelescope have
been the study of the moon, sun, interplanetary
space and the earth's ionosphere (a layer of ionized
gas 100 miles above the earth). Researchers have
synchronized the transmitting abilities of the Big
Dish with receiving equipment aboard Pioneer
spacecraft orbiting the sun.
Signals are sent from the Big Dish to the
spacecraft, which determine how the messages are
affected as they pass through the solar wind, "the
extension of the glowing corona you see around the

stin is photographs," Croft said.
The solar wind is so hot that it flows
supersonically outward toward the earth, and the
earth's magnetic field pushes it away by creating a
shock wave permanently hanging in space.
Fortunate Planet
E. Taylor Howard, the senior research associate
who runs the Stanford portion of the Pioneer
project, said researchers have discovered, "We're
very fortunate to be protected by this bottle
[magnetic field surrounding the earth]. Without it
we'd be subject to very, very strong radiation."
Of the Pioneer series, which began in 1965,
numbers eight and nine are still aloft and
functioning with Stanford receivers. Pioneer 10, en
route to Jupiter, is not being monitored by
Stanford.
Another Big Dish project has involved the use of
equipment aboard the Apollo 14, 15, and 16
spacecraft to receive signals bounced off the moon.
The signals have enabled researchers to project a
crude map of the moon's surface and immediate
sub-surface.
Researchers have predicted that the antenna will
have observed a full 11-year solar cycle by
December, 1975. What will happen to the Big Dish
after that is a question floating as high in the sky as
the sun which the Dish observes.
