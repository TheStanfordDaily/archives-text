# Justice Hoist On Own Petard
## Red-Hunting, Agnew, And Plumbers 
### 
GREENVILLE, Miss., Sept. 24
— One of the Nixon
administration-Department of
Justice's favorite tactics in past
trials of political "radicals" may
now effectively prevent the
successful prosecutions of former
administration officials and
campaign aides indicted in the
wake of Watergate.
Simultaneously, another
favorite radical-hunting
innovation may be aiding the
Maryland grand jury's
investigation into Vice President
Spiro Agnew's political part.
In an historic 1963 decision,
Brady v. Maryland, the U.S.
Supreme Court ruled that "a trial
is not a sporting event" where
prosecutors may use any method
they choose to insure convictions,
including the withholding of
"exculpatory material;" that is,
evidence that might tend to prove
the innocence of a defendant.
The government's tactic of
withholding exculpatory evidence
last reached epidemic proportions
during the "Pentagon Papers" trial
earlier this year. Time and time
again the prosecutor told U.S.
District Court Judge William
Matthew Byrne Jr. that the
government was holding no
exculpatory evidence.
Damage Reports
But the first prosecution
witness in the case, an assistant
general counsel in the Department
of Denfense, testified that the
DoD prepared many "damage
reports" — analyses of the alleged
damage caused by the release of
the "Papers." The reports, he said,
showed that in fact no damage
had been caused by the release of
the "Top Secret" study.
The government eventually
turned over more than 40 such
analyses — most containing
exculpatory material — under the
persistent prodding of Byrne and
angry defense attorneys.
Some legal scholars, as well as
defense attorneys for a number of
Watergate indictees (present and
future) believe that President
Nixon's tape recordings of
conversations with staff members
and campaign aides — which the
President says he won't turn over
to the Watergate grand jury unless
the Supreme Court issues a
definitive ruling, whatever that
may mean — may contain
exculpatory material.
Whether or not the tapes in
fact do contain such evidence may

prove irrelevant. Should the
President choose not to turn over
the tapes, or orders them altered
or destroyed, many of the
Watergate defendants may have
grounds to ask either that the
charges against them be dropped
or that mistrials be declared in
proceedings against them.

many of

be dropped or that
mistrials be declared

Should that situation come to
pass, then the President, whether
by design or not, will . have
stopped or prevented prosecutions
and succeeded in eliminating any
future need to grant executive
pardons to his former associates —
and he will have done it all neatly
in the name of preserving
executive privilege.
In 1970, the Congress
approved an Organized Crime
Control act strengthening the
powers of federal grand juries.
The act allows the Department of
Justice to convene special

investigative grand juries for up to
18 months (they may be
reconvened for an additional 18
months if the prosecutor so
elects). It also gives prosecutors a
choice in the type of immunity
they may grant witnesses.
Prior to the mid-1960'5, the
only type of immunity federal
prosecutors could give was
"transactional immunity, meaning
that witnesses could not
incriminate themselves in front of
grand juries and expect to be
indicted in connection with the
same matter about which they
testified.
New Technique
But the 1970 crime-control act
gives prosecutors a new tool —
"use immunity." Under this
technique, used with equal fervor
against the New Left and so-called
organized crime, a witness can't
be indicted on the basis of his
own testimony — but if the grand
jury is able to obtain

1 Ed Kohn

incriminating evidence from
another source not mentioned by
the witness, he may be indicted
despite his appearance before the
grand jury.
Federal prosecutors in
Maryland apparently are using this
recently-sanctioned form of
immunity in connection with the
appearances of several contractors
in the prosecutors' efforts to build
a case against Vice President
Agnew.
Whether or not an indictment
of the Vice President is
forthcoming is not clear; but the
prosecutors anticipate the
indictment of several Maryland
contractors, and possibly
legislators — despite their
appearances before the grand jury
investigating the matter.

pass, then the President, whether
by design or not, will . have
stopped or prevented prosecutions

future need to grant executive
pardons to his former associates —
and he will have done it all neatly
in the name of preserving
executive privilege.
In 1970, the Congress
approved an Organized Crime
Control act strengthening the
powers of federal grand juries.
The act allows the Department of
Justice to convene special

investigative grand juries for up to
18 months (they may be
reconvened for an additional 18
months if the prosecutor so
elects). It also gives prosecutors a
choice in the type of immunity
they may grant witnesses.
Prior to the mid-1960'5, the
only type of immunity federal
prosecutors could give was
"transactional immunity, meaning
that witnesses could not
incriminate themselves in front of
grand juries and expect to be
indicted in connection with the
same matter about which they
testified.
New Technique
But the 1970 crime-control act
gives prosecutors a new tool —
"use immunity." Under this
technique, used with equal fervor
against the New Left and so-called
organized crime, a witness can't
be indicted on the basis of his
own testimony — but if the grand
jury is able to obtain

1 Ed Kohn

incriminating evidence from
another source not mentioned by
the witness, he may be indicted
despite his appearance before the
grand jury.
Federal prosecutors in
Maryland apparently are using this
recently-sanctioned form of
immunity in connection with the
appearances of several contractors
in the prosecutors' efforts to build
a case against Vice President
Agnew.
Whether or not an indictment
of the Vice President is
forthcoming is not clear; but the
prosecutors anticipate the
indictment of several Maryland
contractors, and possibly
legislators — despite their
appearances before the grand jury
investigating the matter.

GREENVILLE, Miss., Sept. 24
— One of the Nixon
administration-Department of
Justice's favorite tactics in past
trials of political "radicals" may
now effectively prevent the
successful prosecutions of former
administration officials and
campaign aides indicted in the
wake of Watergate.
Simultaneously, another
favorite radical-hunting
innovation may be aiding the
Maryland grand jury's
investigation into Vice President
Spiro Agnew's political part.
In an historic 1963 decision,
Brady v. Maryland, the U.S.
Supreme Court ruled that "a trial
is not a sporting event" where
prosecutors may use any method
they choose to insure convictions,
including the withholding of
"exculpatory material;" that is,
evidence that might tend to prove
the innocence of a defendant.
The government's tactic of
withholding exculpatory evidence
last reached epidemic proportions
during the "Pentagon Papers" trial
earlier this year. Time and time
again the prosecutor told U.S.
District Court Judge William
Matthew Byrne Jr. that the
government was holding no
exculpatory evidence.
Damage Reports
But the first prosecution
witness in the case, an assistant
general counsel in the Department
of Denfense, testified that the
DoD prepared many "damage
reports" — analyses of the alleged
damage caused by the release of
the "Papers." The reports, he said,
showed that in fact no damage
had been caused by the release of
the "Top Secret" study.
The government eventually
turned over more than 40 such
analyses — most containing
exculpatory material — under the
persistent prodding of Byrne and
angry defense attorneys.
Some legal scholars, as well as
defense attorneys for a number of
Watergate indictees (present and
future) believe that President
Nixon's tape recordings of
conversations with staff members
and campaign aides — which the
President says he won't turn over
to the Watergate grand jury unless
the Supreme Court issues a
definitive ruling, whatever that
may mean — may contain
exculpatory material.
Whether or not the tapes in
fact do contain such evidence may

prove irrelevant. Should the
President choose not to turn over
the tapes, or orders them altered
or destroyed, many of the
Watergate defendants may have
grounds to ask either that the
charges against them be dropped
or that mistrials be declared in
proceedings against them.

"exculpatory material;" that is,
evidence that might tend to prove
the innocence of a defendant.
The government's tactic of
withholding exculpatory evidence
last reached epidemic proportions
during the "Pentagon Papers" trial
earlier this year. Time and time
again the prosecutor told U.S.
District Court Judge William
Matthew Byrne Jr. that the
government was holding no
exculpatory evidence.
Damage Reports
But the first prosecution
witness in the case, an assistant
general counsel in the Department
of Denfense, testified that the
DoD prepared many "damage
reports" — analyses of the alleged
damage caused by the release of
the "Papers." The reports, he said,
showed that in fact no damage
had been caused by the release of
the "Top Secret" study.
The government eventually
turned over more than 40 such
analyses — most containing
exculpatory material — under the
persistent prodding of Byrne and
angry defense attorneys.
Some legal scholars, as well as
defense attorneys for a number of
Watergate indictees (present and
future) believe that President
Nixon's tape recordings of
conversations with staff members
and campaign aides — which the
President says he won't turn over
to the Watergate grand jury unless
the Supreme Court issues a
definitive ruling, whatever that
may mean — may contain
exculpatory material.
Whether or not the tapes in
fact do contain such evidence may

prove irrelevant. Should the
President choose not to turn over
the tapes, or orders them altered
or destroyed, many of the
Watergate defendants may have
grounds to ask either that the
charges against them be dropped
or that mistrials be declared in
proceedings against them.

"Should the
President choose not
to turn over the
tapes, or orders them
altered or destroyed,
many of
the Watergate
defendants
may have
grounds to ask
either that the
charges against them
be dropped or that
mistrials be declared
in proceedings
againstthem."

Should that situation come to
pass, then the President, whether
by design or not, will . have
stopped or prevented prosecutions
and succeeded in eliminating any
future need to grant executive
pardons to his former associates —
and he will have done it all neatly
in the name of preserving
executive privilege.
In 1970, the Congress
approved an Organized Crime
Control act strengthening the
powers of federal grand juries.
The act allows the Department of
Justice to convene special

investigative grand juries for up to
18 months (they may be
reconvened for an additional 18
months if the prosecutor so
elects). It also gives prosecutors a
choice in the type of immunity
they may grant witnesses.
Prior to the mid-1960'5, the
only type of immunity federal
prosecutors could give was
"transactional immunity, meaning
that witnesses could not
incriminate themselves in front of
grand juries and expect to be
indicted in connection with the
same matter about which they
testified.
New Technique
But the 1970 crime-control act
gives prosecutors a new tool —
"use immunity." Under this
technique, used with equal fervor
against the New Left and so-called
organized crime, a witness can't
be indicted on the basis of his
own testimony — but if the grand
jury is able to obtain

incriminating evidence from
another source not mentioned by
the witness, he may be indicted
despite his appearance before the
grand jury.
Federal prosecutors in
Maryland apparently are using this
recently-sanctioned form of
immunity in connection with the
appearances of several contractors
in the prosecutors' efforts to build
a case against Vice President
Agnew.
Whether or not an indictment
of the Vice President is
forthcoming is not clear; but the
prosecutors anticipate the
indictment of several Maryland
contractors, and possibly
legislators — despite their
appearances before the grand jury
investigating the matter.
