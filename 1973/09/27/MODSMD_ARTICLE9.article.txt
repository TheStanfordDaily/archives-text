# Painful, But Real
## Have You Had Any Experience? 
### 
Summers can be filled with
extraordinary experiences, some
of which are unique and
incommunicable, others of which
are so faithfully recurrent as to be
archetypical. These are type I and
type II experiences, respectively.
The following tale is of the second
sort.
The liberal arts' student goes
out to look for a job and is
besieged by queries concerning
"experience." Now no one, no
matter how lowly or
impoverished, is without
experience. It is simply a question
of what qualifies as bona fide
Experience. No, he has never
worked graveyard shift in a hotel
before, but he has occasionally,
when duty required, stood post to
greet the sun. Or again, he has
never been a Cook as such, but he
has cooked and would cook again.
Nor has he driven cab, but then a
cab bears a curious resemblance to
a ....
The liberal arts' student is
miffed. He is absolutely certain of
his intellectual and moral
superiority. How can these

flunkies make such trite demands
for a job which is less than ideal
to begin with? He could run the
whole show. Our friend would
make one hell-of-a Good Humor
Man, but he has got to be given
the opportunity.
Well, the opportunity is given
— begrudgingly. Our student
friend, his hair somewhat shorter,
shows up for work with
anticipatory cynicism. He is
briefed on the "do's" and
"don'ts." Told who is boss and
who, coincidentally, will always
be boss. Receives certain
suggestions on comportment and
procedure. After taking the order,
he should always ask, "Would you
like french fries with that?"
Work goes well. New insights
about slavery accrue faster than
they can be processed. A mere
two more paychecks until he can
afford to buy his Fall quarter's
books. His boss likes the way he
works and tells him that if he
quits school, he might get a raise
- and a promotion. The boss does
not understand that quitting
school is not on the boy's mind.

In fact, the boy can hardly wait to
get back to school. Somehow,
they treat him better back on the
Farm.
So, it's Fall. He rolls into town
a little older, a little wiser, a little
more ruthless. As he fingers
through the course catalogue, he
pauses fleetingly on the Biology
section. No, he has never been a
science buff. Medicine is too
Woody. Electrical Engineering?
Too dangerous. Computer
Science? Too automated. Law?
Why hadn't he seen it before?
That's it! He'll be a lawyer. And
the next time some flunky comes
along asking about "experience,"
he'll shovel so much Latinesque
jargon on this pea-brain that the
latter will gratefully withdraw a
few rungs. That will provide much
experience for all.
The point of our little story —
for it does not have a moral — is
that sooner or later, just like
puberty, the realization dawm
that a college education per se
does not entitle a fellow to the
Good Life; and if the Good Life is
what a fellow wants (maybe it is

1 Peter Podgorny

not), remedial measures must be
instituted. The emotional
concomitant of this realization is
the gut apprehension that one
could conceivably end-up on the
bottom of the social totem Dple.
For some reason this does not jive
with one's self image or one's
divine destiny, self-construed. So
begins the frenetic search for a
profession. What makes this partly
a type I tale is that the emotional
indignation one feels at the
thought of not being given one's
rightful due in the social arena is
truly a singular experience, truly
ineffable. That this should come
as a horrendous surprise to the
unwitting student says something
about the Farm and the other
farms, as well as about one's
inbred expectations.

begins the frenetic search for a
profession. What makes this partly
a type I tale is that the emotional
indignation one feels at the
thought of not being given one's
rightful due in the social arena is
truly a singular experience, truly
ineffable. That this should come

Summers can be filled with
extraordinary experiences, some
of which are unique and
incommunicable, others of which
are so faithfully recurrent as to be
archetypical. These are type I and
type II experiences, respectively.
The following tale is of the second
sort.
The liberal arts' student goes
out to look for a job and is
besieged by queries concerning
"experience." Now no one, no
matter how lowly or
impoverished, is without
experience. It is simply a question
of what qualifies as bona fide
Experience. No, he has never
worked graveyard shift in a hotel
before, but he has occasionally,
when duty required, stood post to
greet the sun. Or again, he has
never been a Cook as such, but he
has cooked and would cook again.
Nor has he driven cab, but then a
cab bears a curious resemblance to
a ....
The liberal arts' student is
miffed. He is absolutely certain of
his intellectual and moral
superiority. How can these

flunkies make such trite demands
for a job which is less than ideal
to begin with? He could run the
whole show. Our friend would
make one hell-of-a Good Humor
Man, but he has got to be given
the opportunity.
Well, the opportunity is given
— begrudgingly. Our student
friend, his hair somewhat shorter,
shows up for work with
anticipatory cynicism. He is
briefed on the "do's" and
"don'ts." Told who is boss and
who, coincidentally, will always
be boss. Receives certain
suggestions on comportment and
procedure. After taking the order,
he should always ask, "Would you
like french fries with that?"
Work goes well. New insights
about slavery accrue faster than
they can be processed. A mere
two more paychecks until he can
afford to buy his Fall quarter's
books. His boss likes the way he
works and tells him that if he
quits school, he might get a raise
- and a promotion. The boss does
not understand that quitting
school is not on the boy's mind.

In fact, the boy can hardly wait to
get back to school. Somehow,
they treat him better back on the
Farm.
So, it's Fall. He rolls into town
a little older, a little wiser, a little
more ruthless. As he fingers
through the course catalogue, he
pauses fleetingly on the Biology
section. No, he has never been a
science buff. Medicine is too
Woody. Electrical Engineering?
Too dangerous. Computer
Science? Too automated. Law?
Why hadn't he seen it before?
That's it! He'll be a lawyer. And
the next time some flunky comes
along asking about "experience,"
he'll shovel so much Latinesque
jargon on this pea-brain that the
latter will gratefully withdraw a
few rungs. That will provide much
experience for all.
The point of our little story —
for it does not have a moral — is
that sooner or later, just like
puberty, the realization dawm
that a college education per se
does not entitle a fellow to the
Good Life; and if the Good Life is
what a fellow wants (maybe it is

1 Peter Podgorny

not), remedial measures must be
instituted. The emotional
concomitant of this realization is
the gut apprehension that one
could conceivably end-up on the
bottom of the social totem Dple.
For some reason this does not jive
with one's self image or one's
divine destiny, self-construed. So
