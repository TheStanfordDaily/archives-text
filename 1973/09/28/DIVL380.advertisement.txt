The New Super Sport 500
Now a four-cylinder Honda 500! A bike of incredible beauty ...
and incredible power. The 4-stroke OHC transversely-mounted
4-cylinder engine delivers 50 hp. Plenty of speed for the freeway.
Great acceleration for beating the traffic in town. There are four
racing-style carburetors to go with the four cylinders. And another
four to top it off — four beautiful, chrome, megaphone-style,
tuned pipes. The CB-500 is the lowest and sleekest looking 500 on
the road. The tank, side covers, striping and emblems are all new
and all out-of-sight.
