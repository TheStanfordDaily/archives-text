"Hi."
"Hi."
"Anybody sitting here."
"No."
"Who are you?"
"Oh, Bill."
"Bill. Bill, Bill, Bill."
"Yeah."
"I'm just memorizing it. And
who are you?"
"I'm Rick."
"Rick, right. And you?"
"Rick."
"Rick? Another Rick?"
"Yeah, small world."
"Let's see then, Bob, Rick and
Rick."
"No, Bill."
"Oh, sorry. Then it's Bill, Bob
and Rick."
"No, I'm Rick."
"I thought he was Rick."
"We're both Rick."
"Yeah small world."
"Then who's Bob?"
"Don't know. Say Rick, do
you know any Bobs?"
"Yeah, there's one in Otero."
"That must be your man."
"Oh, I thought one of you was
Bob."
"Afraid not."
"Oh. Then what's your
major?"
"Who?"
"Rick."
"Which Rick?"
"Uh, on the right."
"Psychology."
"Now."
"Oh you're one of those."
"One of which?"
"Changing your major all the
time."
"Nope, you're thinking of
Pete."
"Pete?"
"My wishy-washy roommate."
"Oh? Does he live in our
dorm?"
"Yeah, he's my roommate."
"Oh. What's his major?"

"Who knows."
"What year are you?"
"I think I'm 20."
"No, I mean what year in
school?"
"What's today?"
"Uh, Friday."
"Then I must be a junior."
"What are you going to do
with a psychology major?"

"Teach hop-scotch."
"Oh."
"He's pre-med."
"Oh, that's too bad."
"Yeah."
"What classes have you got?"
"Dear Lord, how long must
this continue."
"What?"
"Nothing."
"Don't mind him, he's very
biblical."
"Well, so how are your
classes?"
"Oh, they're in the time
schedule."
"So?"
"That's about all I can say for
them."
"Bill actually loves the
academic environment. He just
can't help being clever."
"Yeah. I don't know what
comes over me."

"Where are you from
anyway?"
"Before this?"
"Yeah."
"I was in my room. 109.

"No. He was lying."
"Then where is he from?"
"San Jose."
"But isn't San Jose in
California."
"No, it got expelled."
"I'll have you know, Rick, San
Jose is one of the finest cities in
the state."
"Next to Mil pitas."
"Oh yeah. How about the San
Jose airport?"
"That's an asset?"
"And how about the Civic
auditorium?"
"You mean the place that had
its roof fall in?"
"Yeah."
"Oh That's wonderful."
"Well it's better than L.A."
"Pass."
"Oh, are you from L.A."
"Sort of."
"Sort of?"

"I live there, but refuse to
admit it."
"Hey, look. Are you about out
of questions?"
"Wait a minute, let me check."
"Uh?"
"I have a list so I won't forget
any."
"Where's everybody been
getting that damn list."
"Let's see now. I asked your
name, major, where you're from,
your dorm. That just leaves how
are you and do you have any
more classes today."
"Fine. No."
"Oh yeah, and did you hold
any office in high school?"
"I was ball monitor."
"0.K., I guess that's about it."
"Amqn."
"You are very religious aren't
you?"
"Yeah, I'm very consumated."
"He means constipated."
"You guys are not as friendly
as you might be."
"Another country heard
from."
"I mean, I've really been
making an effort."
"I noticed. What you need is a
good freshman dorm."
"Yeah. We're kind of above all
that?"
"Being friendly."
"No. Speech."
"Oh."
"You know, I'd like to
smother the guy that's printing
those lists."
Moral for the day:
Freshmen don't know what's
going on.
Sophomores think they know
what's going on.
Juniors know no one knows
what's going on.
Seniors don't care what the
hell is going on.
