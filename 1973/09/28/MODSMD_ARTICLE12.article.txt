Editor:
The senior class officers and
university administration will
soon be selecting a speaker for
Commencement 1974. Any
suggestions from seniors regarding
specific speakers or type of
speaker (i.e. educator, journalist,
political activist) would be
appreciated.
Please send suggestions to:
Class of 1974
550 San Juan
Stanford
or take them to the ASSU office
in Tresiader Union.

A new school year! Meeting
new people and seeing old friends,
discovering classes to be both
more interesting and more work
than expected, studying till
midnite in order to party till
dawn!! An exciting life!!!
But, sometimes I feel that
some people are too excited. I felt
this way this morning while riding
my bike between classes. The
other bicycles seemed to be Caster
and harder to dodge than ever. I
had hoped that after the
experiences of last year, cycling
conditions would improve. Last
year, many people on campus
were involved or witnessed bicycle
accidents and everyone indirectly
felt the tragedy of a bicycle
accident which ended the life of a
fellow student. Nevertheless, the
situation is worse today than a
year ago. Stanford continually
reminds me that education is a

nearly impossible process.
Of course, a totally effective
and satisfactory solution isn't
obvious. However, a few common
sense observations and suggestions
are more than obvious. 1) Don't
pedal too fast, 2) Stay on the
right side of the road or path, 3)
When driving a car, remember that
most pedestrians (except for the
terror stricken ones) and bicycle
riders are not watching out for
you, so it becomes your
responsibility to look out for
them.
For my part, while on the
road, I ask all bicyclists who stir
up a breeze while gliding by me to
"please slow down." I don't have
a monopoly on those three
monosyllabic words, so you are
welcome to use them. If anyone
has bigger or better ideas on the
subject, please let all of us know.
