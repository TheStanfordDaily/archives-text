# Let's End Corruption
## Campaign Funding 
### 
"U.S. Senator Alan Cranston
(D—Calif.) recently laid out
before a Senate subcommittee the
"basic principles" of public
financing of political campaigns
which, he said, should be enacted
into law "to cleanse elections of
th corrupting curse of huge
private campaign contributions."
"Watergate," Cranston told the
Senate Rules Subcommittee on
Elections and Privileges, "is only
the latest demonstration of this
long over-due need."
Cranston acted as spoilsman
for a bipartisan group of 33
Senators, including the
Democratic and Republican
leaders, and a number of citizen
groups such as Common Cause.
Cranston also testified on
behalf of his own campaign
financing bill, called the Clean
Elections Financing Act, which
would limit an individual's private
contribution to any one candidate
in a federal election to $250.
"The American people will not
have a truly representative
government as long as giant,
powerful special interests are free
to pour millions of dollars into
political campaigns to defeat
people who disagree with them
and to put into office people who
will do their bidding," Cranston
declared.
"The only way to clean up the
political process — to cure the

Sen. Alan Cranston

body politic and remove the
insidious influence of big money
on our democracy — is to provide
substantial financial support for
elections from public funds."
"We need a system for
encouraging large numbers of
small contributions from millions
of ordinary citizens," Cranston
said. "But we also will need to
supplement these small private
contributions with sufficient
public funds so lesser-known
challengers can have a fair change
in races against incumbents in
office."
Cranston's bill provides 4-to-l
federal matching of private
contributions of $100 or less in
Congressional and Presidential
primaries, and 80 percent public
financing of major party
candidates in general elections.
Funds would come from the
present $1 check-off on income
tax returns, which would be raised
to $2 under the Cranston
measure. The Cranston bill also
makes the $2 ear-marking
automatic, unless the taxpayer
indicates otherwise.
The system is to be supervised
by a new bipartisan 7-member
Federal Election Commission to
be selected jointly by the
President and Congress.

"U.S. Senator Alan Cranston
(D—Calif.) recently laid out
before a Senate subcommittee the
"basic principles" of public
financing of political campaigns
which, he said, should be enacted
into law "to cleanse elections of
th corrupting curse of huge
private campaign contributions."
"Watergate," Cranston told the
Senate Rules Subcommittee on
Elections and Privileges, "is only
the latest demonstration of this
long over-due need."
Cranston acted as spoilsman
for a bipartisan group of 33
Senators, including the
Democratic and Republican
leaders, and a number of citizen
groups such as Common Cause.
Cranston also testified on
behalf of his own campaign
financing bill, called the Clean
Elections Financing Act, which
would limit an individual's private
contribution to any one candidate
in a federal election to $250.
"The American people will not
have a truly representative
government as long as giant,
powerful special interests are free
to pour millions of dollars into
political campaigns to defeat
people who disagree with them
and to put into office people who
will do their bidding," Cranston
declared.
"The only way to clean up the
political process — to cure the

Sen. Alan Cranston

body politic and remove the
insidious influence of big money
on our democracy — is to provide
substantial financial support for
elections from public funds."
"We need a system for
encouraging large numbers of
small contributions from millions
of ordinary citizens," Cranston
said. "But we also will need to
supplement these small private
contributions with sufficient
public funds so lesser-known
challengers can have a fair change
in races against incumbents in
office."
Cranston's bill provides 4-to-l
federal matching of private
contributions of $100 or less in
Congressional and Presidential
primaries, and 80 percent public
financing of major party
candidates in general elections.
Funds would come from the
present $1 check-off on income
tax returns, which would be raised
to $2 under the Cranston
measure. The Cranston bill also
makes the $2 ear-marking
automatic, unless the taxpayer
indicates otherwise.
The system is to be supervised
by a new bipartisan 7-member
Federal Election Commission to
be selected jointly by the
President and Congress.
