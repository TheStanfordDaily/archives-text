# Intellectuals Face Exile, Confinement
## Soviet Dissidents Endure Persecution 
### WILLIAM L. RYAN AP Special Correspondent Analysis 
A few towering figures still
man the battered ramparts of
human rights in the Soviet Union,
defying the most sustained
Kremlin offensive against dissent
since the Stalin era.
Andrei D. Sakharov, the noted
nuclear physicist; Alexander I.
Solzhenitsyn, the Nobel Prize
author, and a few other eminent
intellectuals associated with them
risk the same sort of terrifying
punishment meted out to many
others who dare criticize the
system.
But perhaps because of their
prominence, the regime opted for

siege rather than the trial and
imprisonment tactics used against
so many others since Leonid I.
Brezhnev came to power as head
of the Communist party in 1964.
For a time, then, the battle may
be limited to persistent official
harassment.
There are many ways open to
the regime for dealing with
inconvenient intellectuals in a
land where history of repression
seems constantly to repeat itself.
Punsihment By Exile
Milder punishments include
exile abroad; exile inside the
U.S.S.R., restrictions on means of
livelihood, harassment, spying on
and threatening a dissenter and his
family.

But usually, the punishments
are harsh: confinement in prison
or hard-labor camps plus, often,
forced treatment in prison mental
hospitals.
The czars frequently got rid of
dissidents by letting them out of
Russia and not letting them
return. Lenin, too, used this
device for ridding himself of
"trouble makers."
The current regime would
probably like to handle Sakharov,
Solzhenitsyn and some others that
way: let them out and then lift
their citizenship.
"You may notice,"
Solzhenitsyn told interviewers
recently, "that in those cases
when it is impossible to get rid of
a person with behind-the-scene

methods used on the
nonprominent, they find it least
painful to fling him out into the
West, and it is best if it can be
worked out as a voluntary
agreement in the guise of a
temporary trip abroad or an
irrevocable emigration."
That was the tactic used
against many outstanding figures,
including Dr. Zhores Medvedev,
the notfed geneticist now living in
London; Valery N. Chalidze, the
physicist, now in the United
States; Alexander Yesenin-Volpin,
the mathematician, now in Italy,
and others. The human rights
advocates were stripped of their
Soviet citizenship while they were
abroad.
The regime seems to hold it
axiomatic that a citizen
disagreeing with its rule is most
likely a lunatic. Nikita S.
Khrushchev had contended that
the major source of such
disagreement was psychotic.
'Special' Hospitals
More than a score of "special"
Soviet hospitals are associated
with police use of psychiatry.
Solzhenitsyn in 1970
denounced what he called the
"obliging, perjured psychiatrists,"
adding that "detention of
free-thinking people in insane
asylums is spiritual murder, a
variant of the gas chamber and
even more cruel."
Bertram D. Wolfe an historian
and expert on Soviet affairs here,
wrote last year that psychiatric
treatment of dissidents involves
drug-induced high fever and
torture by such methods as
binding the subject in wet cloths
that contract while drying,
causing intense pain.
Case Histories
From a long roll of
"psychiatric" prisoners, a few case
histories:
—Vladimir Bukovsky, 31,
writer. He criticized persecution
of writers. In May 1963 he was
confined in the Serbsky Institute
of Forensic Psychiatry, then

transferred to a prison psychiatric
hospital for 15 months. Since
then he was arrested twice more,
and underwent forced psychiatric
treatment. Protests from abroad
persuaded the regime to drop its
attempts to have him declared
insane. Tried as a criminal he drew
a 12-year sentence in prison, labor
camp and exile. He is in frail
health.
—Pyotr Grigorenko, former
army general, champion of rights
of minority people. He was sent
to a "special" psychiatric hospital
at Chernyakovsk, whence he
managed to smuggle out a
manuscript called "Thoughts of a
Madman."
Prison Hospitals
"The prison psychiatric
hospital is a frightening place for a
sane person," he wrote. "An
inmate has no rights. Doctors do
with him as they please."
—Andrei Amalrik, a young
writer and civil rights champion
whose "Will the Soviet Union
Survive until 1984?" infuriated
the Kremlin, finished a three-year
labor camp term May 22. His wife
Gyusel was informed officially
that he was rearrested that day on
new charges and sent back for
three more years. He now has
meningitis and his health is
declining rapidly.
—Viktor Rain berg and
Vladimir Borisov, members of a
human rights group. They were
arrested in August 1968 for
protesting the Soviet invasion of
Czechoslovakia. Both got forced
treatment at the Serbsy Institute.
Records of the case, smuggled
out, were studied by 44 British
psychiatrists who, in a joint
statement, then expressed grave
concern about such use of
psychiatry.
Natalya Gorbanevskaya, a
young poet active in the human
rights cause, protested the
invasion of Czechoslovakia.
Arrested in 1970 she was declared
mentally unstable and committed
to an indeterminate sentence in an
insane asylum.
