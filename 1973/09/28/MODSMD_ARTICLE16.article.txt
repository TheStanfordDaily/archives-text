# Trustees Request Outlay Program For State Schools
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - The
Board of Trustees of the
California State University and
Colleges called on the Reagan
administration and legislature
Wednesday to approve a capital
outlay program of $77 million for
1974-75.
The program includes more
than $58 million for the
construction of new buildings on
the 19 campuses of the system.
The board, which concluded a
two-day meeting, forecast a
five-day 1974-78 state-funded
capital outlay of more than
$361.9 million.
The trustees were told that the
growth rate at the schools had
slowed from an average high of 18
percent a year in the 1960s to
four percent in the 19705. A
decline in enrollment was
predicted for the 1980s.
The capital outlay for such
facilities as residence halls,
parking and student unions, to be
raised by revenue bonds, was
placed at $2.9 million for
1974-75.
The five-year figure is $61
million.
The board, meeting in full
session, postponed until its next
meeting action on amending the
procedures of the internal audit
staff. The delay was taken to
reword the report to prevent
embarrassing audits from being
kept secret except for compelling
legal reasons.
The trustees adopted a

committee resolution tightening
controls on student probation and
disqualification. The resolution,
aimed at so-called professional
students, places new emphasis for
probation and disqualification
satisfactory progress toward an
academic goal. Withdrawals from
class also would be a
consideration for disciplinary
action.
Chancellor Glenn S. Dumke
announced the appointment of
Milton Dobkin as acting president
of California State University at
Humboldt, pending appointment
of a permanent successor to
former president Cornelius
Siemens by the board of trustees.
Earlier, trustees discussed the
issue of faculty moonlighting but
postponed taking action.
Trustee William O. Weissich of
San Rafael said he felt "we should
only put down that they're
expected to do their job well, and
what they do after that is their
own affair."
Another trustee, Winifred H.
Lancaster of Santa Barbara, said
she felt a detailed guideline would
simply "legislate mediocrity," and
she said trustees could not put a
limitation on more brilliant and
energetic faculty, who earn
additional salaries in jobs when
they are not teaching.
A committee on faculty and
staff affairs studied a statement of
guidelines on outside employment
and postponed action on the
matter.
