# Reagan Vetoes Indian Aid Bill

### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) — A $1.6 million bill for
Indian education centers was vetoed by Gov.
Ronald Reagan Wednesday on grounds that their
services would overlap with existing programs.
The bill was introduced by Sen. George Moscone,
D-San Francisco.
It would have set up 20 Indian education centers
throughout the state with a $400,000 appropriation
in fiscal 1973-74, and a $1.2 million appropriation
in 1974-75. /
In his veto message, Reagan said, "the majority
of the services to be provided by the Indian
education centers are presently available or may be
provided through a number of existing local, state
and federal education programs.
"To commit the state to a permanent program of
this magnitude without determining if the proposed

services cannot be provided by other programs
would not be in the taxpayers' best interest,"
Reagan added.
Moscone commented that the veto was "not
surprising in view of the governor's consistent denial
of basic services for American natives."
"What we sought was an expansion of the very
successful education center program operated in the
Bishop area, where high school dropout rates have
been reduced from 40 percent to 10 percent,"
Moscone said.
He added: "The governor says these services are
available elsewhere. I think any governor or citizen
who goes out to the reservation can plainly see that
they are not only not available but that we are
letting most Indians struggle along in the most
abject circumstances."
