# New Apartment Studied
## 
### 
A feasibility study of
apartment development on the
old Stanford Elementary School
site will be reported to the
University's Board of Trustees at
their October meeting.
This report follows the
recommendation of a special
advisory committee to the
University's Committee on Land
& Building Development chaired
by Prof. Paul R. Hanna, emeritus
holder of the Lee Jacks
professorship of education.
Based on survey results, the
committee recommended the
immediate construction of up to
100 units for older faculty and
staff members who no longer
want the responsibility for a single
family residence.
The plan calls for some units to
be available with a three-year time
limit for newly arrived junior
faculty and staff. A few units
would be reserved for visiting
professors.

According to a questionnaire
filled out during the spring of
1972 by the potential residents,
the majority of families eligible
for the project would consist of
two adults without children who
prefer a mix of architectural
styles. A 1200-1500-square-foot
unit with two bedrooms, two
baths, and a combined
living-dining area was favored. A
few smaller and a few larger units
would also be developed.

Private developers in the area
have been asked to submit
proposals for developing the
school site under a long term lease
in which the developer himself
maintains and manages the
project. The school now serves as
a day care and pre-school center
and as a Music Department annex.
These activities would be
relocated by next summer if
construction is authorized.
