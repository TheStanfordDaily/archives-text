# Michigan Students Start Tuition Strike
## 
### 
Special to the Daily
Bothered by a recent Michigan
Supreme Court ruling forcing
tuition for state residents
upwards, University of Michigan
students have begun a tuition
strike.
The court ruling eliminated the
tuition discount residents receive
and requires them to pay as much
each semester as students from
other states who attend Michigan
state colleges and universities.
For some students, the
elimination of the discount means
a 50 percent hike in their tuition
bill and many students have risen
in protest.
(Tuition will now run
approximately $1800 for the
average Michigan student, far
short of the $3135 an undergrad
here will pay this year.)
Approximately 5000 students
[roughly 1/6 of the Ann Arbor
student body] have signed
preliminary petitions stating they

will not pay the increase,
according to Chris Parks,
co-editor-in-chief of the Michigan
Daily. About 25 percent of the
Michigan student body are regular
Michigan residents.
"There are a lot of supporters,
particularly among the teaching
fellows [equivalent to teaching
assistants here]," the student
newspaper editor said. "But the
visual manifestations, rallies, etc.
have been flops.
"The strike is really an
underground thing," he
continued.
The success of the tuition
strike depends not on how many
students sign petitions, but how
many actually refuse to pay
approximately $500 extra this
semester in tuition.
"We really don't know how
many students did withhold their
first [tuition] payment. It will be
another week or so before those
figures are available," Parks said.
