# Vice President Contests Maryland Inquiry
## Special Grand Jury Opens Agnew Probe 
### Associated Press 
BALTIMORE — A special federal
grand jury opened an unprecedented
investigation yesterday, a political
graft probe involving Vice President
Spiro T. Agnew. At the same time,
Agnew's lawyers planned to go to
court to stop the inquiry.
One of the lawyers, Judah Best,
said in Washington that a motion
would be filed, possibly as early as the
first of next week, seeking a
temporary injunction to halt the grand
jury proceedings. Such a move had
been expected from the lawyers
yesterday morning before the jury
session started.
"We are going to file," Best said,
adding he did not feel that Agnew's
argument against the grand jury probe
would be hurt by filing for an
injunction after the investigation was
under way.
Three witnesses appeared before
the grand jury during the first hours of
work, but only one of the witnesses
could be identified. He was William J.
Muth, former vice president of the
Baltimore City Council, now the office
manager of an engineering consulting
firm, Hurst-Rosche Engineers, Inc.
Muth has been an Agnew fund raiser.
"The investigation of the vice
president is a lot of bull," Muth said as
he left the federal courthouse after
testifying.
Agnew Notified Earlier
Agnew was notified last month by
federal prosecutors that he was under
investigation for possible criminal
violation of tax, extortion, bribery and
conspiracy laws. He has insisted he is
innocent of any wrongdoing.
The allegations against him center
on kickbacks from contractors during
the 1960s when Agnew was chief
executive of Baltimore County and
then governor of Maryland. There also
have been published reports which
Agnew has denied that he received
illegal cash after becoming vice
president in 1969.
In a related development, three
CBS television crewmen were detained
by federal marshals after they were
found on the roof of an eight-story
building next door to the federal court

house where the grand jury was sitting.
Marshals said the men were filming the
court house from an angle at which
they could see the grand jury room.

At one point, U.S. Atty. George
Beall, who is conducting the probe,
personally questioned the men who
were identified only as Herbert Alston,
A 1 Colby and Dan Bowers. The men
were released after several hours of
questioning but their film was
confiscated.
The grand jury session was being
conducted under conditions of
strictest secrecy. The corridors leading
to the grand jury room were sealed off
by federal marshals so newsmen could
not see who was coming or going.
If and when Agnew's lawyers file a
motion to stop the grand jury
proceedings, the case will be heard by
U.S. Dist. Court Judge Walter

Hoffman of Norfolk, Va. He was
appointed supervising judge after all
nine District Court judges in Maryland
disqualified themselves because they
were either friends or business
associates of Agnew.
Lawyers Will Notify Judge
Edward S. Northrup, chief judge of
the U.S. District Court in Maryland,
said in an interview that Beall and
Agnew's lawyers have "a gentlemen's
agreement" that the lawyers will
notify Beall in advance of their legal
filing.
"Then there will be no evidence
presented to the grand jury until Judge
Hoffman acts on the matter,"
Northrup said.
If Hoffman refused to grant the
temporary restraining order, Agnew's
lawyers would have no appeal,
Northrup said.
If the temporary order were issued,

the judge said, there must be a hearing
on it within 10 days. At that hearing,
the constitutional question of whether
a vice president can be indicted while
in office would be argued and
probably decided, he said.
Agnew Has Routine Day
Meanwhile, in Washington Agnew
spent a relatively routine day, going to
Capitol Hill briefly to perform his
duties as president of the Senate, then
putting final touches'on a scheduled
trip to the West Coast this weekend.
His office said tentative plans called
for Agnew to fly from Washington to
Palm Springs, Calif., Friday morning,
speak to a Republican women's group
in Los Angeles Saturday, then stay in
Palm Springs through Sunday.
In the House of Representatives,
debate continued over Agnew's
request Tuesday for a House
investigation of the charges against
him. That request was turned down
Wednesday by Speaker Carl Albert on
the grounds that the matter was before
the courts.
Republicans Call For Investigation
Yesterday, 14 Republicans on the
House Judiciary Committee
introduced a resolution calling for the
committee to undertake the kind of
investigation Agnew had requested.
A request for Albert to reconsider
came from House Republican Whip,
Leslie C. Arends of Illinois.
Albert said all the resolutions that
have been introduced in the last few
days by Republicans supporting
Agnew's request have been referred to
the House Rules Committee, over
which the Democratic leadership has
firm control.

Agnew's lawyers have "a gentlemen's
agreement" that the lawyers will
notify Beall in advance of their legal
filing.
"Then there will be no evidence
presented to the grand jury until Judge
Hoffman acts on the matter,"
Northrup said.
If Hoffman refused to grant the
temporary restraining order, Agnew's
lawyers would have no appeal,
Northrup said.
If the temporary order were issued,

the judge said, there must be a hearing
on it within 10 days. At that hearing,
the constitutional question of whether
a vice president can be indicted while
in office would be argued and
probably decided, he said.
Agnew Has Routine Day
Meanwhile, in Washington Agnew
spent a relatively routine day, going to
Capitol Hill briefly to perform his
duties as president of the Senate, then
putting final touches'on a scheduled
trip to the West Coast this weekend.
His office said tentative plans called
for Agnew to fly from Washington to
Palm Springs, Calif., Friday morning,
speak to a Republican women's group
in Los Angeles Saturday, then stay in
Palm Springs through Sunday.
In the House of Representatives,
debate continued over Agnew's
request Tuesday for a House
investigation of the charges against
him. That request was turned down
Wednesday by Speaker Carl Albert on
the grounds that the matter was before
the courts.
Republicans Call For Investigation
Yesterday, 14 Republicans on the
House Judiciary Committee
introduced a resolution calling for the
committee to undertake the kind of
investigation Agnew had requested.
A request for Albert to reconsider
came from House Republican Whip,
Leslie C. Arends of Illinois.
Albert said all the resolutions that
have been introduced in the last few
days by Republicans supporting
Agnew's request have been referred to
the House Rules Committee, over
which the Democratic leadership has
firm control.
BALTIMORE — A special federal
grand jury opened an unprecedented
investigation yesterday, a political
graft probe involving Vice President
Spiro T. Agnew. At the same time,
Agnew's lawyers planned to go to
court to stop the inquiry.
One of the lawyers, Judah Best,
said in Washington that a motion
would be filed, possibly as early as the
first of next week, seeking a
temporary injunction to halt the grand
jury proceedings. Such a move had
been expected from the lawyers
yesterday morning before the jury
session started.
"We are going to file," Best said,
adding he did not feel that Agnew's
argument against the grand jury probe
would be hurt by filing for an
injunction after the investigation was
under way.
Three witnesses appeared before
the grand jury during the first hours of
work, but only one of the witnesses
could be identified. He was William J.
Muth, former vice president of the
Baltimore City Council, now the office
manager of an engineering consulting
firm, Hurst-Rosche Engineers, Inc.
Muth has been an Agnew fund raiser.
"The investigation of the vice
president is a lot of bull," Muth said as
he left the federal courthouse after
testifying.
Agnew Notified Earlier
Agnew was notified last month by
federal prosecutors that he was under
investigation for possible criminal
violation of tax, extortion, bribery and
conspiracy laws. He has insisted he is
innocent of any wrongdoing.
The allegations against him center
on kickbacks from contractors during
the 1960s when Agnew was chief
executive of Baltimore County and
then governor of Maryland. There also
have been published reports which
Agnew has denied that he received
illegal cash after becoming vice
president in 1969.
In a related development, three
CBS television crewmen were detained
by federal marshals after they were
found on the roof of an eight-story
building next door to the federal court

house where the grand jury was sitting.
Marshals said the men were filming the
court house from an angle at which
they could see the grand jury room.
Attorney Quizzes Cameramen
At one point, U.S. Atty. George
Beall, who is conducting the probe,
personally questioned the men who
were identified only as Herbert Alston,
A 1 Colby and Dan Bowers. The men
were released after several hours of
questioning but their film was
confiscated.
The grand jury session was being
conducted under conditions of
strictest secrecy. The corridors leading
to the grand jury room were sealed off
by federal marshals so newsmen could
not see who was coming or going.
If and when Agnew's lawyers file a
motion to stop the grand jury
proceedings, the case will be heard by
U.S. Dist. Court Judge Walter

Hoffman of Norfolk, Va. He was
appointed supervising judge after all
nine District Court judges in Maryland
disqualified themselves because they
were either friends or business
associates of Agnew.
Lawyers Will Notify Judge
Edward S. Northrup, chief judge of
the U.S. District Court in Maryland,
said in an interview that Beall and

federal prosecutors that he was under
investigation for possible criminal
violation of tax, extortion, bribery and
conspiracy laws. He has insisted he is
innocent of any wrongdoing.
The allegations against him center
on kickbacks from contractors during
the 1960s when Agnew was chief
executive of Baltimore County and
then governor of Maryland. There also
have been published reports which
Agnew has denied that he received
illegal cash after becoming vice
president in 1969.
In a related development, three
CBS television crewmen were detained
by federal marshals after they were
found on the roof of an eight-story
building next door to the federal court

house where the grand jury was sitting.
Marshals said the men were filming the
court house from an angle at which
they could see the grand jury room.
Attorney Quizzes Cameramen
At one point, U.S. Atty. George
Beall, who is conducting the probe,
personally questioned the men who
were identified only as Herbert Alston,
A 1 Colby and Dan Bowers. The men
were released after several hours of
questioning but their film was
confiscated.
The grand jury session was being
conducted under conditions of
strictest secrecy. The corridors leading
to the grand jury room were sealed off
by federal marshals so newsmen could
not see who was coming or going.
If and when Agnew's lawyers file a
motion to stop the grand jury
proceedings, the case will be heard by
U.S. Dist. Court Judge Walter

Hoffman of Norfolk, Va. He was
appointed supervising judge after all
nine District Court judges in Maryland
disqualified themselves because they
were either friends or business
associates of Agnew.
Lawyers Will Notify Judge
Edward S. Northrup, chief judge of
the U.S. District Court in Maryland,
said in an interview that Beall and
Agnew's lawyers have "a gentlemen's
agreement" that the lawyers will
notify Beall in advance of their legal
filing.
"Then there will be no evidence
presented to the grand jury until Judge
Hoffman acts on the matter,"
Northrup said.
If Hoffman refused to grant the
temporary restraining order, Agnew's
lawyers would have no appeal,
Northrup said.
If the temporary order were issued,

the judge said, there must be a hearing
on it within 10 days. At that hearing,
the constitutional question of whether
a vice president can be indicted while
in office would be argued and
probably decided, he said.
Agnew Has Routine Day
Meanwhile, in Washington Agnew
spent a relatively routine day, going to
Capitol Hill briefly to perform his
duties as president of the Senate, then
putting final touches'on a scheduled
trip to the West Coast this weekend.
His office said tentative plans called
for Agnew to fly from Washington to
Palm Springs, Calif., Friday morning,
speak to a Republican women's group
in Los Angeles Saturday, then stay in
Palm Springs through Sunday.
In the House of Representatives,
debate continued over Agnew's
request Tuesday for a House
investigation of the charges against
him. That request was turned down
Wednesday by Speaker Carl Albert on
the grounds that the matter was before
the courts.
Republicans Call For Investigation
Yesterday, 14 Republicans on the
House Judiciary Committee
introduced a resolution calling for the
committee to undertake the kind of
investigation Agnew had requested.
A request for Albert to reconsider
came from House Republican Whip,
Leslie C. Arends of Illinois.
Albert said all the resolutions that
have been introduced in the last few
days by Republicans supporting
Agnew's request have been referred to
the House Rules Committee, over
which the Democratic leadership has
firm control.
