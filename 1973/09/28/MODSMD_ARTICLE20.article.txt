# Constitutional Amendment Proposed To Restore Religious Instruction
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) - A big,
new push is developing to get
teaching about religion restored to
public school education in this
country.
The drive is coming in two
arenas, both among educators and
church people out in the field,
and in the halls of Congress.
There, the effort took on new
dimensions last week when the
U.S. Catholic Conference called
for a constitutional amendment
permitting both religious
instruction under private auspices
and also prayer in public schools.
The move has sparked debate
in religious circles, and some
opposition.

Until it came, the issue in
Congress had been largely
confined in recent years to
repeatedly defeated proposals to
allow "voluntary" or
"nondenominational" prayers in
schools.
About 30 such proposals —
seven in the Senate and 23 in the
House — are again up for
consideration.
However, broader action now
is gathering momentum in
educational circles to get courses
"about" religion into public
school curricula as an essential
part of a well-rounded education.
"As an integral part of man's
culture, it must be included," says

the American Association of
School Administrators.
A special center, recently
established at Wright State
University in Dayton, Ohio, is
working to provide guide manuals
and prepare public school teachers
for handling classes on religion.
"Curriculum materials have
now been developed to enable
such instruction in the schools,"
says James Panoch, coordinator
for the newly set up Public
Education Religion Studies
Center.
He points out that public
school courses on religion were
encouraged — and not outlawed —
by the U.S. Supreme Court

decision of 10 years ago banning
state-sponsored devotional
exercises.
Retired U.S. Justice Thomas C.
Clark, who wrote that landmark
decisions, told a recent
symposium at the center that the
decision has been widely
misunderstood as banning
vital religious classes.
The center, set up by a grant
from Religious Heritage of
America, Inc., found in a recent
partial survey that courses about
religion already exist in many high
schools.
With hearings again percolating
in Congress about school prayers,
the U.S. Catholic Conference
made its proposal for a
constitutional amendment
allowing privately conducted
religious instruction on school
premises.
Bishop James S. Bausch, the
conference's general secretary,
says such a step is "vitally
important to protect the religious
liberty of parents and children."
However, the Rev. James E.
Wood Jr., head of the Baptist
Joint Committee on Public
Affairs, said the move would
"bring confusion" to the whole
issue of religion and public
schools.

NEW YORK (AP) - A big,
new push is developing to get
teaching about religion restored to
public school education in this
country.
The drive is coming in two
arenas, both among educators and
church people out in the field,
and in the halls of Congress.
There, the effort took on new
dimensions last week when the
U.S. Catholic Conference called
for a constitutional amendment
permitting both religious
instruction under private auspices
and also prayer in public schools.
The move has sparked debate
in religious circles, and some
opposition.

Until it came, the issue in
Congress had been largely
confined in recent years to
repeatedly defeated proposals to
allow "voluntary" or
"nondenominational" prayers in
schools.
About 30 such proposals —
seven in the Senate and 23 in the
House — are again up for
consideration.
However, broader action now
is gathering momentum in
educational circles to get courses
"about" religion into public
school curricula as an essential
part of a well-rounded education.
"As an integral part of man's
culture, it must be included," says

the American Association of
School Administrators.
A special center, recently
established at Wright State
University in Dayton, Ohio, is
working to provide guide manuals
and prepare public school teachers
for handling classes on religion.
"Curriculum materials have
now been developed to enable
such instruction in the schools,"
says James Panoch, coordinator
for the newly set up Public
Education Religion Studies
Center.
He points out that public
school courses on religion were
encouraged — and not outlawed —
by the U.S. Supreme Court

decision of 10 years ago banning
state-sponsored devotional
exercises.
Retired U.S. Justice Thomas C.
Clark, who wrote that landmark
decisions, told a recent
symposium at the center that the
decision has been widely
misunderstood as banning
vital religious classes.
The center, set up by a grant
from Religious Heritage of
America, Inc., found in a recent
partial survey that courses about
religion already exist in many high
schools.
With hearings again percolating
in Congress about school prayers,
the U.S. Catholic Conference
made its proposal for a
constitutional amendment
allowing privately conducted
religious instruction on school
premises.
Bishop James S. Bausch, the
conference's general secretary,
says such a step is "vitally
important to protect the religious
liberty of parents and children."
However, the Rev. James E.
Wood Jr., head of the Baptist
Joint Committee on Public
