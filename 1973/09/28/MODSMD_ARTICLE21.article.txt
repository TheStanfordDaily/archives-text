# Anti-Smog Devices Required
## Price Increase Due On Used Cars 
### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) — If you're planning to
buy a 1966-70 model car, it may be cheaper to do it
this weekend.
Beginning Monday, most cars manufactured in
that period will require a new antismog device
costing up to $35 when they are sold in the San
Francisco, San Diego or South Coast air basins.
The South Coast area includes the region from
Santa Barbara on the north to the San Diego
County line, and includes about half the state's
population.
A special emissions inspection also will be
required for such cars changing ownership in the
three air basins.
Both the device and the inspection will be paid
for by the buyer except in cases where the seller is a
dealer. Then the dealer pays for the device.
The state Air Resources Board last week ordered
the program to proceed after a four-month delay for
added review of the devices. The delay was
occasioned by predictions that the devices would
cause engine overheating and damage. After the
review, the ARB changed the specifications slightly
for the devices in an effort to prevent such
problems.
By Oct. 31, 1974 the devices will be required
statewide for virtually all of California's 5.4 million
1966-70 model cars, not just those changing

ownership.
That program will be phased in over 10 months
according to the final digit in each car's license
plate. *
Cars made in 1966-70 came equipped with
factory-made antismog equipment aimed at
controlling emissions of carbon monoxide and
carbohydrates but not oxides of nitrogen. They
accomplished this by increasing the engine's
operating temperature, allowing more complete
combustion of fuel.
However, increased combustion temperature
sharly increases oxides of nitrogen, the smog
component which is harmful to plant and animal
life and which gives smog its greenish caste.
As a result, cars of 1966-70 vintage generally
emit low concentrations of carbon monoxide and
hydrocarbons but high concentrations of oxides and
nitrogen.
Cars made since 1970 have been equipped with
factory-made oxides of nitrogen controls.
Six manufacturers have won ARB accreditation
for the devices. State law requires that the devices
cost no more than $35, including installation. Some
of the approved devices cost much less. They can
only be purchased at service stations and gargages
licensed as official state inspection stations.
The accredited devices cut oxides of nitrogen by
at least 42 percent, the ARB said.

three air basins.
Both the device and the inspection will be paid
for by the buyer except in cases where the seller is a
dealer. Then the dealer pays for the device.
The state Air Resources Board last week ordered
the program to proceed after a four-month delay for
added review of the devices. The delay was
occasioned by predictions that the devices would
cause engine overheating and damage. After the
review, the ARB changed the specifications slightly
for the devices in an effort to prevent such
problems.
By Oct. 31, 1974 the devices will be required
statewide for virtually all of California's 5.4 million
1966-70 model cars, not just those changing

ownership.
That program will be phased in over 10 months
according to the final digit in each car's license
plate. *
Cars made in 1966-70 came equipped with
factory-made antismog equipment aimed at
controlling emissions of carbon monoxide and
carbohydrates but not oxides of nitrogen. They
accomplished this by increasing the engine's
operating temperature, allowing more complete
combustion of fuel.
However, increased combustion temperature
sharly increases oxides of nitrogen, the smog
component which is harmful to plant and animal
life and which gives smog its greenish caste.
As a result, cars of 1966-70 vintage generally
emit low concentrations of carbon monoxide and
hydrocarbons but high concentrations of oxides and
nitrogen.
Cars made since 1970 have been equipped with
factory-made oxides of nitrogen controls.
Six manufacturers have won ARB accreditation
for the devices. State law requires that the devices
cost no more than $35, including installation. Some
of the approved devices cost much less. They can
only be purchased at service stations and gargages
licensed as official state inspection stations.
The accredited devices cut oxides of nitrogen by
at least 42 percent, the ARB said.
