# Band Outdraws Baseball In Extra Innings
## Solos Mar Allman Brothers Concert 
### GEORGE POWELL 
OAKLAND - In a battle of
â€¢championship attractions in
Oakland Tuesday night the
Allman Brothers Band easily
outdrew the Oakland Athletics,
and outplayed them as welj.
A capacity crowd of around
16,000 Allman fans in the Arena
outdistanced the A's total of 3700
in the nearby Coliseum. The
hard-core Allman fans saw Gregg
Allman. Dicky Betts and company
get off to a fast start, but falter in
the late innings, long after the
baseball fans had left their half of
the Alameda County sports
complex.
To one who has never seen the

Allman Brothers live before, the
group's fans seem every bit as
fanatic as Greatful Dead admirers,
even down to a candlelight ritual
to insure an encore. For the
Allmans, this involves everyone
holding lighted matches, which
gave the Coliseum a sort of
Fairyland appearance in the dark.
In a way, it's a fitting tribute
for the strong but delicate touch
that the Allman Brothers display
in all their material. Betts' guitar
work throughout the evening was
very controlled, without excessive
volume. But he sometimes became
quite self-indulgent, particularly
at the end of the concert.
Since I have never seen the

AJlman Brothers in action and
don't own any of their later
records, I really didn't know what
sort of music to expect. Would
the delicacy of "Jessica" or heavy
southern funk predominate? Or
would the Allmans play a series of
long, jazz influenced numbers?
As Betts said early in the
evening, "We're going to play just
as many numbers as we can," and,
happily, they did. It wasn't in the
variety of selections, but in the
structuring of the sets that the
concert was disappointing.
Starting with short numbers,
Allman and Betts traded the vocal
chores and kept the tempo varied
and interesting, with funky

numbers like "Southbound,"
alternating with more
jazz-influenced tunes.
High Point
But with "Ramblin' Man," the
group's current single hit, and
"Jessica," the set reached a high
point. The remaining hour was all
downhill, with a slow trickle
toward the exits by many in
attendance.
Why? Because the Allmans
became overly pretentious and
self-indulgent. Betts in particular
seemed to think that showing his
technical virtuosity, ability to
change keys and play high up on
the frets was more important than
making a cogent piece of music.
In a very long number that
practically emptied the section in
which I sat, all six members of the
band got to show their virtuosity
on each one's particular
instrumental specialty.
Self-Indulgent Solos
If the solos had been
interesting, this contrived
technical display might have come
off. But they weren't, so it didn't.
But the truly faithful fans
didn't seem to mind the band's
solo flights of fancy, and probably
took advantage of the
opportunity to go to the
bathroom, since beer and wine
were as popular as good ol' grass
with Allman fans.
After the fans were relieved of
their liquid burdens and the
Allmans had released theii
pretentions an encore was in
order.
But the encore was much like
the previous hour's effort. I
wearied of the instrumental
pretentions and left, so the
memory of the Allman's fine
beginning would not be spoiled
for me.
Marshall Tucker Music
Before the Allmans arrived the
Marshall Tucker Band entertained
the crowd. Although the group
has released just one single album
to date, they have a reputation as
up and coming.
Tuesday wasn't their night,
however, as the sound system gave
their six-man group a muddied
musical presentation. The vocals
were unintelligible and the lead
guitar licks seemed nothing more
than an up-tempo ripoff of 8.8.
King.
Hie Marshall Tucker Band
deserves the benefit of the doubt,
since they're newcomers on the
big concert scene.
But the Allman Brothers are
too good to have to indulge in
foolish pretentions, and there is
no need for Dicky Betts to prove
he is as great a guitar technician as
the late Duane Allman. That's just
not the way good ol' southern
boys should behave.
