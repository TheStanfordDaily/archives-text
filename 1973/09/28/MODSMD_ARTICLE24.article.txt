## 'Kung Fu' Perpetuates Asian Character Myths 
### PAUL FONG 
Despite strenuous objections,
Hollywood has continually cast
white actors in Asiatic roles.
Yesterday's Charlie Chan and
today's Caine, the protagonist of
the new television series, King Fu,
are two of many Asian characters
played by white actors. Caine, the
more pretentious of the two, has a
Chinese mother and gets his name
from his American father.
As a selling point, King Fu's

producers claim that the
half-Chinese, half-white Caine, as
played by caucasian actor David
Carradine, gives a positive image
of Asians in the mass media.
The hyperbole is equivalent to
the thought expressed in the
following scenario: a television
producer decides to upgrade the
image of Blacks by offering to his
audience an alternative to Amos
h Andy. To do so, he creates a
new program starring a white

actor who plays a half-black and
half-white character.
The possible repercussions of
such an expression of racism are
distressing — a belief that racial
minorities are too inferior to
portray the white-conceived roles
meant for them.
Asian Stereotype
Kung Fu blends old and new
stereotypes of Asians for the
consumption of the American
viewer. Its central figure, Caine,

still bears the old stigmas of
inscrutability and passivity.He is a
loner who rarely shows emotion.
Caine seldom speaks, and when
he does he often mutters a
semi-Confucian platitude. His
utter self-reliance and patronizing
air run counter to man's basic
need for human warmth and
companionship.
The new twist in Caine's
character lies in his almost
superhuman qualities. As a novice
in a Chinese monastery, he has
mastered the techniques and
philosophy of the martial arts.
Forced to flee China, he
wanders barefoot through the
American Territorial Southwest.
His hearing can detect voices miles
away. He rarely sleepsor eats and
never shows fatigue when fighting
or working. And the attribution
of unrealistic feats to a despotized
minority is cruel insincerity.
Counter-Revolutionary
Last year, members of
Columbae House found, in Caine,
a new model of their
"revolutionary non-violent"
philosophy. This is difficult to
imagine. Non-violence, as Ghandi
perceived it, is a revolutionary
path towards political and social
liberation. In contrast, Caine's
semi-Confucian, semi-Taoist

philosophy is distinctly
counter-revolutionary.
Caine emphasizes personal
self-cultivation to a point which
leaves no room for social
consciousness. This leads him to
take the reactionary actions
characteristic of his elite
upbringing. Wishing to be above
the rabble, he abandons fellow
railroad workers when they are on
the verge of a strike.
In one episode, he tames a
horse by meditation. In doing so,
Caine presents to us an opiate
dream of how we may deal with
our present needs — meditate
them away.
The historical incredibility of
King Fu would cause any
educated person to see the
commercialism underlying the
mock-Chinese veneer. The
program is set in the Southwest
during the 1870s. In this time and
place, no Chinese was able to
wander alone safely.
The coining of the phrse, "not
a Chinaman's chance," reflects the
vicious anti-Chinese attitudes of
that time. Family and district
associations were set up in
Chinatown to provide safety and
comfort to the Chinese from the
"white devils."
In another episode last season,

Caine's accusation against a white
sheriff was taken seriously —
another product of fantasy.
Chinese, in those days, were
considered subhuman. They were
ineligible to testify in court
against a white man. They were
barred from voting and for a
period were excluded from
entering this country.
Through Caine, Kung Fu
presents a distorted image of
Asians as a passive, undemanding,
and accomodating people. Caine
fights only in personal self
defense, never in the context of
social challenge. Contrast this
with the aggressive and open
determination of the People's
Republic to fight imperialism.
Like the current popularity of
Black movies from Hollywood,
Kung Fu attempts to capitalize on
the honest desire of millions of
ITiird World people in the U.S. for
dignity. Some Asians like the
show because it reinforces an
image which whites expect of
them. The "good"
Asian-American is cultured, quiet,
industrious, and uncomplaining.
It is sad to see commercial
products of the media act as
pacifiers for Third World peoples.
The message from the medium
veils the still-present social
oppression and asks Asians to be
good, to be content, to see no
evil. Such Hollywood myths,
based on profit, are like sweet
poison — one does not notice its
effect until it is too late.

educated person to see the
commercialism underlying the
mock-Chinese veneer. The
program is set in the Southwest
during the 1870s. In this time and
place, no Chinese was able to
wander alone safely.
The coining of the phrse, "not
a Chinaman's chance," reflects the
vicious anti-Chinese attitudes of
that time. Family and district
associations were set up in
Chinatown to provide safety and
comfort to the Chinese from the
"white devils."
In another episode last season,

Caine's accusation against a white
sheriff was taken seriously —
another product of fantasy.
Chinese, in those days, were
considered subhuman. They were
ineligible to testify in court
against a white man. They were
barred from voting and for a
period were excluded from
entering this country.
Through Caine, Kung Fu
presents a distorted image of
Asians as a passive, undemanding,
and accomodating people. Caine
fights only in personal self
defense, never in the context of
social challenge. Contrast this
with the aggressive and open
determination of the People's
Republic to fight imperialism.
Like the current popularity of
Black movies from Hollywood,
Kung Fu attempts to capitalize on
the honest desire of millions of
ITiird World people in the U.S. for
dignity. Some Asians like the
show because it reinforces an
image which whites expect of
them. The "good"
Asian-American is cultured, quiet,
industrious, and uncomplaining.
It is sad to see commercial
products of the media act as
pacifiers for Third World peoples.
The message from the medium
veils the still-present social
oppression and asks Asians to be
good, to be content, to see no
evil. Such Hollywood myths,
based on profit, are like sweet
poison — one does not notice its
effect until it is too late.
Despite strenuous objections,
Hollywood has continually cast
white actors in Asiatic roles.
Yesterday's Charlie Chan and
today's Caine, the protagonist of
the new television series, King Fu,
are two of many Asian characters
played by white actors. Caine, the
more pretentious of the two, has a
Chinese mother and gets his name
from his American father.
As a selling point, King Fu's

producers claim that the
half-Chinese, half-white Caine, as
played by caucasian actor David
Carradine, gives a positive image
of Asians in the mass media.
The hyperbole is equivalent to
the thought expressed in the
following scenario: a television
producer decides to upgrade the
image of Blacks by offering to his
audience an alternative to Amos
h Andy. To do so, he creates a
new program starring a white

actor who plays a half-black and
half-white character.
The possible repercussions of
such an expression of racism are
distressing — a belief that racial
minorities are too inferior to
portray the white-conceived roles
meant for them.
Asian Stereotype
Kung Fu blends old and new
stereotypes of Asians for the
consumption of the American
viewer. Its central figure, Caine,

still bears the old stigmas of
inscrutability and passivity.He is a
loner who rarely shows emotion.
Caine seldom speaks, and when
he does he often mutters a
semi-Confucian platitude. His
utter self-reliance and patronizing
air run counter to man's basic
need for human warmth and
companionship.
The new twist in Caine's
character lies in his almost
superhuman qualities. As a novice
in a Chinese monastery, he has
mastered the techniques and
philosophy of the martial arts.
Forced to flee China, he
wanders barefoot through the
American Territorial Southwest.
His hearing can detect voices miles
away. He rarely sleepsor eats and
never shows fatigue when fighting
or working. And the attribution
of unrealistic feats to a despotized
minority is cruel insincerity.
Counter-Revolutionary
Last year, members of
Columbae House found, in Caine,
a new model of their
"revolutionary non-violent"
philosophy. This is difficult to
imagine. Non-violence, as Ghandi
perceived it, is a revolutionary
path towards political and social
liberation. In contrast, Caine's
semi-Confucian, semi-Taoist

philosophy is distinctly
counter-revolutionary.
Caine emphasizes personal
self-cultivation to a point which
leaves no room for social
consciousness. This leads him to
take the reactionary actions
characteristic of his elite
upbringing. Wishing to be above
the rabble, he abandons fellow
railroad workers when they are on
the verge of a strike.
In one episode, he tames a
horse by meditation. In doing so,
Caine presents to us an opiate
dream of how we may deal with
our present needs — meditate
them away.

viewer. Its central figure, Caine,

still bears the old stigmas of
inscrutability and passivity.He is a
loner who rarely shows emotion.
Caine seldom speaks, and when
he does he often mutters a
semi-Confucian platitude. His
utter self-reliance and patronizing
air run counter to man's basic
need for human warmth and
companionship.
The new twist in Caine's
character lies in his almost
superhuman qualities. As a novice
in a Chinese monastery, he has
mastered the techniques and
philosophy of the martial arts.
Forced to flee China, he
wanders barefoot through the
American Territorial Southwest.
His hearing can detect voices miles
away. He rarely sleepsor eats and
never shows fatigue when fighting
or working. And the attribution
of unrealistic feats to a despotized
minority is cruel insincerity.
Counter-Revolutionary
Last year, members of
Columbae House found, in Caine,
a new model of their
"revolutionary non-violent"
philosophy. This is difficult to
imagine. Non-violence, as Ghandi
perceived it, is a revolutionary
path towards political and social
liberation. In contrast, Caine's
semi-Confucian, semi-Taoist

philosophy is distinctly
counter-revolutionary.
Caine emphasizes personal
self-cultivation to a point which
leaves no room for social
consciousness. This leads him to
take the reactionary actions
characteristic of his elite
upbringing. Wishing to be above
the rabble, he abandons fellow
railroad workers when they are on
the verge of a strike.
In one episode, he tames a
horse by meditation. In doing so,
Caine presents to us an opiate
dream of how we may deal with
our present needs — meditate
them away.
The historical incredibility of
King Fu would cause any
educated person to see the
commercialism underlying the
mock-Chinese veneer. The
program is set in the Southwest
during the 1870s. In this time and
place, no Chinese was able to
wander alone safely.
The coining of the phrse, "not
a Chinaman's chance," reflects the
vicious anti-Chinese attitudes of
that time. Family and district
associations were set up in
Chinatown to provide safety and
comfort to the Chinese from the
"white devils."
In another episode last season,

Caine's accusation against a white
sheriff was taken seriously —
another product of fantasy.
Chinese, in those days, were
considered subhuman. They were
ineligible to testify in court
against a white man. They were
barred from voting and for a
period were excluded from
entering this country.
Through Caine, Kung Fu
presents a distorted image of
Asians as a passive, undemanding,
and accomodating people. Caine
fights only in personal self
defense, never in the context of
social challenge. Contrast this
with the aggressive and open
determination of the People's
Republic to fight imperialism.
Like the current popularity of
Black movies from Hollywood,
Kung Fu attempts to capitalize on
the honest desire of millions of
ITiird World people in the U.S. for
dignity. Some Asians like the
show because it reinforces an
image which whites expect of
them. The "good"
Asian-American is cultured, quiet,
industrious, and uncomplaining.
It is sad to see commercial
products of the media act as
pacifiers for Third World peoples.
The message from the medium
veils the still-present social
oppression and asks Asians to be
good, to be content, to see no
evil. Such Hollywood myths,
based on profit, are like sweet
poison — one does not notice its
effect until it is too late.
