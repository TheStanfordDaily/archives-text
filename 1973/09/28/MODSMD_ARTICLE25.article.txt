# Take It Or Leave It — Joan Baez Preaches Peace And Love To A 'Foul, Lethargic' World
## 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
Beyond the freeway, tucked
neatly in the Palo Alto Hills, a
pure stretch of rustic acreage leads
directly to Joan Baez's house.
Shaded by tall trees and guarded
by outlying pastures and
mountains, the ranch-style
building exudes an aura of
seemingly unreal but nevertheless
pleasant peacefulness.
Clad in blue jeans, bare feet, a
striped shirt and purple smock,
the young yet hardship
experienced looking folksinger
beckons her visitors into an open
doorway as she smiles
encouragingly.
Then, down to business. As
Baez begins to speak, it's obvious
she's been through a myriad of
interviews. She knows the
questions before they're asked
and merely proceeds to ramble,
expounding upon what she
believes the proper subjects,
pausing intermittently to field
other queries.
The Question of Sincerity
She sounds so honest that the
reporter wonders just how sincere
she really is, whether Baez truly
exemplifies what she professes. Is
she the sincere champion of good
or merely a bandwagon jumper?
When Baez performs at
Stanford this Sunday, students
will also have the right to judge
her as well as enjoy her music. She
doesn't believe in putting on a
show; rather, she claims, a concert
is simply an extension of herself.
Throughout her life, she says,
her dedication has been to
promoting nonviolence and love —
thru music and by talking to
people, during concerts or
anytime. Her philosophy is
succinct: "I've been lucky that I
don't like flags. I'm not an
American patriot and I couldn't
be a patriot of any other place in
the world. I'm patriotic to people.
I'm absolutely devoted to the
family of man. And if I have a
symbol that would ever go up on
a flag, it would be the face of a
child — every child in the world.
Each time I see a child, I know
why I fight and why I fight the
way I fight."
Against All Violence
Those who don't take an active
part in political and social issues
bother Joan Baez. "There's plenty
to dissent about," she claims,
"you can sit around in the
lethargy and passivity. I think it's
a very boring way to live. I
couldn't do it, I guess. You lose a

lot of sleep if you do it the other
way. It's hard to listen to the
radio at night and be involved."
Baez is and always has been
involved, to the point where she's
blocked draft boards, refused to*
pay income tax and gone to
prison in the name of peace.
She points out, "What's
offered to you in this country is a
niche in American Society. If you
don't want a niche, you're in a
bind and you'll get hassled. The
way I look at it is you choose
your risk because life is one fat
risk."
Baez condemns educational
institutions for merely
indoctrinating students into the
"corrupt ways" of a competitive
society. "I hated school, all the
way through — the stomach pains,
nausea, separation anxiety from
my family — everything about it is
a general nightmare."
Even college (which she never
attended), she says, is full of
"bullshit liberalism," her reason
for the lack of campus protest
activities in recent months: "So
now we can have bearded killers
instead of non-bearded ones. It's
scary. You're worried about your
family, how many Mustangs
you're going to own, how you're
going to get your little groove in
the American way of life.
Lucky
"I'm lucky — I sing and can
make money and I live well. Most
of my friends don't have money.
They live on subsistance and they
live happily. They don't have time
to worry about Mustangs — they
worry about whether their
Volkswagen's going to hold
together to get them to the next
demonstration in San Francisco."
But, according to Baez, most
people don't behave this way —
rather, everyone is out for
himself.
"I don't know even a liberal
who isn't a bullshit liberal," she
says, "Liberals put money into
radical causes but the radicals take
the risks. I'm a radical — now,
that's not violent; violent people
are reactionaries — but I take
risks."
Baez claims that in order to
best be educated, people must
actually exist in adverse
conditions rather than study them
in a classroom: "In this country,
at least every white middle class
American should experience jail at
least once. Do it under a
controlled situation — in a

demonstration, when you know
approximately how long you'll be
in. There's a whole other half of
America in those prisons." Baez
remembers her unpleasant
experience in a cell but claims
she'd do it agtin.
In the course of preaching her
activist philosophy, aside from
cartoonist A 1 Capp who called her
"Phonie Joanie," Baez says no
one has ever told her, "You're full
of shit."
Living by the code of "being
heavy on human decency," Baez
wants the American public to also
accept non-violence as a way of
life. "That's hard because I know
that because I've spoken out
against the flag, against the
nation-state, very few people
understand that I'm talking about
all flags and all nation-states.
That's partly because I think
America is the worst offender —
we have more power than any
other country so we're acting
more foul."
Devotion To Man
Religion plays a large part in
Joan Baez's conception of
decency. "I get very devout about
the human race. I don't know
what God means but I know that
I fall very easily into prayer and
meditation, in crisis times more
than others."
Although she believes in God
("The Quakers say, 'There's that
of good in every man.' I was
raised as a Quaker and I guess it
still sticks.") Baez frowns on
Campus Crusade and other
organized religious groups because
"I think it's frenzied looking for a
shortcut way to find peace.
There's absolutely no relation to
the people who are dying in Chile
and Vietnam."
Baez doesn't model her life
after anyone because "it's
dangerous," but she "takes hints"
from Caesar Chavez, Ghandi and
Christ.
Although Baez doesn't

consider herself an optimist or
pessimist, but rather "a realist,"
her view of man is cynical: "I
want to appeal to the best in
people but it's much easier to
bring out the worst. The reason
we have Chiles and Nixons is that
for 6,000 years, human nature ha*
been basically the same — it's just
disgusting, stupid, visceral,
reactionary, violent, dumb. It's
easier to be violent."
These human emotions, she
claims, are what inspire Baez to
write her songs, perform her
concerts and become involved.
"The songs I write are either very
personal things about some affair
I've just had that made it or didn't
— then there's my son and then
there's politics."
Baez, who has had two top 40
hits The Night They Drove Old
Dixie Down and In the Quiet
Morning, says she never writes
with the market in mind because
"I don't think I could. For the
farm workers, I wrote a song
about Juan De La Cruz, which I'll
sing Sunday, and it's not
marketable. It's a hell of a lot
better than the song about George
Jackson but it would never sell."
The Hooker
What then does sell? "You got
to have the line called the hooker.
It has to repeat at least five or six
times. Dylan did that
instinctively. He wrote songs that
had a line that by the end of the
song, you knew well enough to
hum over and over — the answer is
blowing in the wind."
Baez says that songs vary in
writing time. Her ballands, Listen
To A Stranger and When Time Is
Stolen, took two to three days to
create where as Bangladesh took a
week: "All of it came out of one
paragraph in Newsweek, the italics
before the story." Baez will
shortly record a new album ("a
hodge-podge of Latin American
weirdness") to be released before
Christmas: "I'm going to try and

get a bunch of farm workers to
come with me in the studio and
do songs like We Shall Overcome
in Spanish." She has her own
expensive quadraphonic stereo for
"perfect sound" but Baez claims
"silence is my favorite sound."
But Joan Baez seldom has a
moment of silence for she is
always dealing with other people.
She keens informed on news and
current events by osmosis ("T hate
to read, so I surround myself with
peode who know what I want to
know"). She spends time with
Gabriel, her young son. She works
for Amnesty, International, an
organization "on behalf of
prisoners of conscience all over
the world aimed at eliminating
cases of torture."
Baez grew up in Palo Alto but
she treats Stanford as any other
concert "I just try to keep
callouses on my fingers. I have a
bunch of songs written on the
guitar and if I run out of ideas, I
look therp." Baez lines "loose
concerts," where she can relax.
Recently, in San Diego, she
brought Gabriel up on stage and
told him a story with the
microphone open.
At Stanford, she expects the
same atmosphere as anywhere
else. She expects people to have
booze, the outdoor crowd to
concentrate on getting a tan and
therefore taking some of its
attention off her. But she also

expects that she can charm a
Stanford audience as she has
charmed and acquired the kind
consideration of others: "I'm
going to get them delethargized as
fast as I can and talk about the
farmworkers, Chile and Amnesty
International."
In short, Baez plans to
perpetuate her controversial,
thought-provoking lifestvle, of
which, for $2.50, you can get a
brief glimpse on Sunday at 3 p.m.
in Frost Amphitheater.
