# Cards Compete In California Invitational
## Gaughran Enthused As Water Polo Begins 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Stanford water polo coach Jim
Gaughran is enthusiastic in
assessing his team's chances for a
berth in the NCAA
championships. The first test of
his enthusiasm will come this
morning as the Cardinal season
gets underway at the University of
California Invitational in
Berkeley.
Stanford will face Pacific in a
first round game of (he 10-team,
single elimination tournament this
morning at 9 a.m. Further games
are scheduled for 5 p.m. today
and the same two times
tomorrow. The Cards will play all
four games regardless of today's
results since losers are
automatically placed in the
consolation bracket. Cal is rated
the overwhelming favorite but the

Bears could have a tough time
against UC-Davis or Stanford.
"We'll definitely be improved
over last year's 7-9 team,"
Gaughran said. "The NCAA water
polo tournament is a very real
possibility for us. The key will be
to beat USC and to upset either
UCLA or Cal."
Gaughran spoke of the
importance of developing a top
goalie if the NCAA tournament is
to become a reality for the Cards
come November. As of now the
goalie situation is confused, with
Tom Cummings listed as the
tentative top man.
Freshman Chris Dorst has been
outstanding in practice and Doug
Tanner and Peter Abate are also
challenging for Cummings' job.
Aggressive Offense
Gaughran indicated that the
Cards will utilize an aggressive
offensive attack. "We'll use a fast
break offense, with all seven men
as potential offensive threats," he
said. "This will take away the
possibility of a team shutting off
just one man and thereby the
whole team."
Eleven lettermen return from
last year's team along with four
junior college transfers. Five
freshmen will also compete.
The probable starters for
today's opening game are Dean
Anderson, Greg Lointz, Drew
McDonald, John-Paul Roberts,
Thomas Warden and Rick Gebers,
with Cummings in goal.
Anderson holds the Stanford

school record in the 50-meter
freestyle and was a 1972
All-American in the event. He will
add much speed to the team, and
should help to start the fast break
offense the team will employ this
year.
'Terrific Addition'
Gebers, a junior college
transfer from DeAnza College, is
"a terrific addition to our team,"
according to Gaughran. Craig Van
Zandt is another top JC transfer.
McDonald, a freshman from
Concord, should see considerable
action this season. McDonald
swam on one of the best AAU
clubs in the nation.
Other returning lettermen
include Matthew Greer, Stanley
Johnson, Lawrence Mann, Peter
Snyder and George Herbert Webb.
Snyder suffered an injury in
practice, a split between his
fingers which Gaughran said may
keep him out for a week.
College water polo is much like
the water polo played in the
Olympics. Each side has seven
men, including the goalie. There
are four seven-minute quarters in
a game.
New Rule
Gaughran expects a new rule
the Pacific Eight Conference
approved this year to have a
significant effect on the game.
Tlie new rule calls for a 30-second
penalty when a player commits a
major foul. Under this sytem a
team will play short-handed,

much like hockey.
The water polo team has been
practicing five to six hours a day
for 10 days in order to tune up
for todays season opener.
However the team has been forced
to hold some of its workouts at
DeAnza Junior College, because
of the fact that the new swimming
complex has not opened.
Of the eight schools in the
Pac-8, only the California schools
field water polo teams. Thus the
conference schedule dictates two
games each with USC, UCLA and
Cal. The top two league finishers
advance to the NCAA
tournament.
"Our schedule has two
tournaments and one
non-conference" game on tap
before we play our first
conference opponent. This should
help the team develop into a
unit," remarked Gaughran.
The first opportunity for
Stanford's students to observe the
water poloists in action at home
will come on October 12, when
the Cards take on Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo. The following day
Stanford will host UCLA.

The Cards will play 11 games
in 1973, all of which will be
played at Stanford's new $2.2
million pool-squash-handball
complex.
