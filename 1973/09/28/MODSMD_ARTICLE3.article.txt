# Faculty Group Seeks Road Safety Measure
## 
### BOB LOWE 
About 40 faculty and staff
members living along the segment of
Junipero Serra Boulevard which passes
through campus are asking Santa Clara
County and the University to
implement measures to improve a
dangerous, 700 yard stretch of road
where auto accidents have claimed six
lives in the past three and a half years.
The segment of road extends north
from the Santa Maria Avenue
intersection. Art Prof. Nathan Oliveira,
chairman of the Roads and Safety
Committee of the Stanford
Homeowners, has been leading the
efforts to get the county to 'calm
down" the heavy traffic on Junipero
Serra.
He said the "notorious stretch of
highway" is a danger and should be a
concern to everyone who drives,
bicycles or jogs along Junipero Serra.
The road has been the sight of three
fatal head-on accidents, including one
last weekend.
(Two 19-year-old Palo Alto men
were killed about 11:15 p.m. Saturday
when their vehicle collided with
another in front of Psychology Prof.
Albert Hastorf's home at 571 Junipero
Serra Blvd.)
As a result of Saturday's accident,
two committees have been formed.

One, headed by Oliveira, proposes that
the University close Santa Maria for a
month on an experimental basis. The
other committee, headed by Biology
Prof. Craig Heller, is considering the
problem of the boulevard itself.
# County officials have already taken
some precautions, such as reducing the
speed limit from 45 to 35 miles per
hour and iastalling safety reflectors.
However, Oliveira feels that the job
is incomplete and says,"the county
has dragged it's feet by not putting in
everything that is necessary.'
Junipero Serra "should be closed
off and given back to the University,"
Oliveira said. But he doubts this will
happen.
Santa Maria, he sais, is the
"University's property and problem"
and should be closed. Residents have
suggested this to the Planning Office,
and Oliveira feels that 'if any
intelligent and objective
consideration" were used, Santa Maria
would be closed.
The danger along Junipero Serra is
a large knoll. A motorist approaching
from either side cannot see beyond the
crest of the hill, creating danger for
both the motorist and for pedestrians
crossing the boulevard. The knoll
covers a large system of utility valves
used by PC»& E.

As a result of Saturday's accident,
two committees have been formed.

One, headed by Oliveira, proposes that
the University close Santa Maria for a
month on an experimental basis. The
other committee, headed by Biology
Prof. Craig Heller, is considering the
problem of the boulevard itself.
# County officials have already taken
some precautions, such as reducing the
speed limit from 45 to 35 miles per
hour and iastalling safety reflectors.
However, Oliveira feels that the job
is incomplete and says,"the county
has dragged it's feet by not putting in
everything that is necessary.'
Junipero Serra "should be closed
off and given back to the University,"
Oliveira said. But he doubts this will
happen.
Santa Maria, he sais, is the
"University's property and problem"
and should be closed. Residents have
suggested this to the Planning Office,
and Oliveira feels that 'if any
intelligent and objective
consideration" were used, Santa Maria
would be closed.
The danger along Junipero Serra is
a large knoll. A motorist approaching
from either side cannot see beyond the
crest of the hill, creating danger for
both the motorist and for pedestrians
crossing the boulevard. The knoll
covers a large system of utility valves
used by PC»& E.
