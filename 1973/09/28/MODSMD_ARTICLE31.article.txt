# Experienced Card Booters Open 1973 Season Tonight
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Stanford's varsity soccer team,
hoping to improve on last year's
10-5-1 record, opens its season
tonight at 8 p.m. against a strong
San Jose State squad on the
Spartans' home field.
The Cardinal booters return
most of their starters from last
year's team, but will need an
excellent effort to top San Jose,
which allowed only one goal while
winning its first three games this
year.
The Spartans are currently
rated fourth in the Far West
(University of San Francisco is
number one), and 18th in the
nation. Defending national
champion St. Louis University
holds down the top spot in an
early poll.
Experience
Coach Fred Priddle feels the
Cards have "fairly good chances"
to finish with a fine record
because of experience. Seniors
Walt Harris, Tom Miller, Mike
Grasty and Alan McDonald will
anchor the starting lineup tonight.
Both Harris and Miller have three
years of varsity experience.
They will be joined by junior
Walter "Robby" Robb and

sophomores Richard "Mac"
Taylor, Mike Kellogg, Phil Wright,
Marty Glickfeld, Brian Bershader
and last year's leading scorer, Bob
Geiger. Wright, Glickfeld and
Geiger all played on the varsity as
freshman.
Priddle, who has coached
soccer here for 25 years, also
expects senior Grant Heidrick,
junior Ricky Caldwell and
sophomore Johnny Murro to see a
lot of action. Heidrick and
Caldwell are recovering from
injuries, but should be ready to
play tonight.
Enthusiasm
Priddle's cautious optimism
towards the new season stems not
only from the team's experience,
but also from the player's
enthusiasm, which often plays an
important role in the so-called
minor sports.
But when you come right
down to it, talent is usually the
key to victory, and although the
Cardinals don't have any foreign
players as most of the top teams
like San Jose and UCLA (number
three in the West) do, they have
three returning All Conference
players: Miller, Harris and Geiger.
Priddle is confident that they will
repeat as All-Conference and said
that all three should be
Ail-American candidates in 1973.
Priddle has added Marty Krum,
former All-American and
Olympian to his staff. They, along
with the team, face a 17-game
schedule, playing about two
matches per week.
Increased Popularity
Considered the most popular
sport in the world today, soccer is
"growing by leaps and bounds" in
this country, according to Priddle.
Most colleges have a team and

many high schools are taking up
the game.
The NCAA has two soccer
divisions: the University division
which Stanford plays in, and the
College division. The country is
divided into sections, and the
Card booters naturally find
themselves in the Far West
section.
At the end of the season the
members of the Far West selection
board, including Priddle, choose a
team to represent this section of
the country against the Midwest's
top team. The NCAA semifinals
and finals are held in the Orange
Bowl during the week prior to the
New Year's game which possesses
the name soccer does in most of
the world â€” football.
The junior varsity plays its first
game tonight at 6 p.m. against San
Jose State's JV's. The freshman
team takes on Mission High (S.F.)
tomorrow at 10:30 a.m. on Harry
Maloney Field by Sunken
Diamond. All varsity home games
will be played at Maloney Field.
