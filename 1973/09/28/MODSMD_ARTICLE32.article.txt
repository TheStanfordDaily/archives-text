SURROUNDED—John Winesberry (26) had trouble finding running
room against Penn State two weeks ago, and this play was no
exception. The Cards hope to substantially improve a running attack
that has so far accounted for minus 13 yards when Stanford meets
San Jose State tomorrow in a 1:30 p.m. game at Stanford Stadium.
