# Frosh Footballers Continue High School Success Stories
## 
### TIM FERGUSON 
The two came from different
ends of California, but the record
was the same in both cases — that
of a success story.
"Ron Inge: 6-1, 205,
Stockton's 'Amateur Athlete of
the Year' for 1973, a football,
basketball and track standout
with 4.6 speed; scrambled 67
yards for a touchdown to lead the
North to a 14-10 upset of the
South in last August's Shrine high
school all-star game."
"Anthony Hill: 6-2, 175, as
quarterback of Long Beach Poly
High broke all of the passing and
total offense records set there by
former Stanford Ail-American,
now San Francisco 49er, Gene
Washington."
Now Inge and Hill have joined
at Stanford to become part of a
new dimension in collegiate
football — the freshman varsity
gridder.
"It's a dream come true," says
Hill, a 17 year-old who says he's
fought his way to the status of
second-team wide receiver. He's
made two receptions in the
opening losses to Penn State and
Washington.
Did Inge think a year ago that
he'd be playing against the likes of
the Nittany Lions and Wolverines?
"Not this year," he says, but he's
not by the prospect
now-realized. "They [the
Wolverines, 47-10 victors] weren't
as good as they looked."
Confident
Both men exude confidence
that the Cardinals are better than
they appeared in the first two
encounters.
"We made a lot of mistakes,"
admits Hill. "We won't make
those mistakes Saturday [against
San Jose State]. Practice this
week has been a lot more intense.
We're going to surprise people.
We're going to be bad — we're
going to be tough."
"We can take the Rose Bowl
this year," claims Hill. "The
coaches have been doing a good
job. We [the players] have been

making the mistakes."
Despite a 30-yard kickoff
return and 17-yard reception
against Michigan, Inge says he's "a
borderline case" between what
assistant coach Dave Currey calls
"part-time" varsity work and
full-time junior varsity status.
"Inge can play just about
anywhere," says Currey. "It just
so happens he's got good people
in front of him."
Frosh Guards
Currey was also high on Hill
("He gets better every day") but
saved the most praise for
freshman offensive guards Gary
Anderson and Alex Karakozoff,
both of whom are in contention
for starting posts. Anderson
opened against Michigan and is
scheduled to start again tomorrow
against the Spartans.
Says Currey of Karakozoff, a
6-3, 230-pounder from San
Francisco, "He's a real tough,
coachable kid. We're very
surprised at how mature he is in
learning his position. We've had a
lack of depth and this has allowed
him to move up."
Hill lauds fellow freshman
Mike Cordova as another top
prospect. Cordova made an
auspicious-albeit-brief debut
against Michigan, and his wide
receiver says, "Cordova's a good
runner. He's another [Jim]
Plunkett." Cordova, incidentally,
wears Plunkett's number 6 on his
jersey.
Inge says it's "not that unusual
anymore" for freshman to play
varsity, and Stanford's roster
bears his view out.
"I thought we had a great year
recruiting," says Currey. "The six
freshman on the varsity are
indicative of that." (Quarterback
Guy Benjamin is the sixth
freshman on the roster.) He says
this year's crop of newcomers is
"better than years past from a
skill-position standpoint." To
further point out recruiting gains,
Currey adds that new football
scholarships have increased from

nine three years ago to 23 in
1973.
What is it like for the freshmen
who arrived four weeks before the
start of classes to play football on
the Farm, where the gridiron
admittedly takes a back seat to
the classroom?
"I get a lot of ribbing from the
people in my dorm [Roble
Hall]," says Inge, "but that'll
pass."
Inge says the strain of varsity
football will not prove a new
distraction to his academics. "This
was the way it was in high school,
but they say there's more
homework here."
"We were both recruited by
USC [a football training school
south of Santa Barbara]," says
Hill, "but the attitude is different
here. Everyone helps each other
out. That's one of the strengths
that are going to make us a great
team — unity.
"We're going to the Rose Bowl
before we leave here," asserts
Inge. The losses to Penn State and
Michigan "won't defer our
confidence."
But what of a New Year's Day
trip to Pasadena as a freshman, as
a 17-year-ol<P. Hill recalls an
earlier prospect when he says,
"That's another dream...
