# IM Roundup
## Women Now Eligible 
### PETE BHATIA 
Another big year of
intramurals is ready to begin and
for the first time women may
participate in all IM sports. Even
though it seems a little ridiculous,
a 250 pound Zete could possibly
be rushing against a 98 blocking
Ms. from Burbank this season.
However, the University
assures us all that there is no legal
problem involved with this new
policy decision.
The University, through its
counsel Cassius Kirk, essentially
states that one plays IM's at his
own risk, and that this applies to
both sexes. Kirk emphasized the
University's insurance would
adequately cover any disputes. A
committee chaired by law
professor Jack Friedenthal then
moved to make the change
official. After President Lyman
approved the decision, IM director
Dutch Fehring rewrote the IM
handbook eliminating all
references to sex — or should I say
gender — and thus, here we are.

Tomorrow, during halftime of
the Stanford-San Jose State
football game, Dutch Fehring will
present the 1972-73 IM
championship trophy to Theta
Delta Chi. The Theta Delts scored
an astounding 300 points Spring
Quarter to come from 50 points
behind to win going away. It was
the second straight title for the
fraternity. The Tlieta Delt's "jock
chairman" from last Spring, Mike
"Pieman" Simons, will receive the
award for the house.

All those planning to referee
IM football should attend an
orientation meeting tomorrow
moming at 10 a.m. in the IM
