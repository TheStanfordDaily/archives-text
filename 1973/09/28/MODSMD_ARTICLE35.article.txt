# County Championship At Stake
## Winless Cards Host Unbeaten Spartans 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Unbeaten San Jose State and
winless Stanford will meet
tomorrow at Stanford Stadium in
a 1:30 p.m. game that will have
very little bearing on national
rankings, the Rose Bowl race or
the front page of any sports
section outside of Northern
California.
But at least one Cardinal fan is
glad that nothing more than the
football championship of Santa
Clara County will be at stake. An
avid Stanford rooter from across
the bay expressed genuine relief
concerning the fact that Stanford
is 0-2 so far this year.
"I should be able to really
enjoy the games now," he wrote
in a letter to Sports Information
Director Bob Murphy. "There's
no pressure anymore. I won't have
to sit on the edge of my seat and
bite my nails like I did during the
Rose Bowl years. Now I can just
enjoy some good football games
and still retain my sanity."
Of course not everyone is
taking a lighthearted appraoch to
tomorrow's game. Tuesday at the
Northern California Football
Writer's luncheon, Stanford coach
Jack Christiansen and first year
San Jose State boss Darryl Rogers

engaged in a mutual praise war
that was lively enough for a
pre-Rose Bowl press conference.
'Quality Team'
"We're playing another quality
football team," Christiansen said.
"San Jose is solid overall,
especially on defense — they have
a strong line, good linebackers and
two cornerbacks who cover as
well as anyone we've seen."
Rogers, meanwhile, was
ebullient in his praise of Stanford.
"They are a great football team —
they do a lot of things well."
"Fumble?" Christiansen
interjected.
"We'll definitely be
outhorsed," Rogers said. "For us
to win Jack's players are almost
going to have to quit and I can't
see them doing that at this time.
"We're very fortunate to have
won our first three football
(£mies, but we haven't been tested
like we feel we're going to be
tested during the remainder of the
season."
Who's Lying?
It's hard to tell which coach
was telling the truth. San Jose is
off to its best start since 1955
(with victories so far over Santa
Clara, Fresno State and Long
Beach State), but then again, as
Rogers pointed out, "We're just
not the same calibre of football
team as Penn State and
Michigan."
Stanford's losses to the Nittany
Lions (20-6) and the Wolverines
(47-10) represent the first time
since 1961 that the Cards have
dropped their first two games.
"We've made enough mistakes in
two games to last a whole
season," Christiansen said.
Tomorrow Chris hopes his
charges can eliminate those costly
miscues and steal some of the
Spartans' momentum. "Darryl
Rogers has done a great job of
getting his team off to such a

good start and that momentum is
sometimes tough to stop. We'll
spend this week trying to develop
a little momentum of our own."
Rejuvenate Running
The first item on Christiansen's
list of priorities involves
rejuvenating a Card running attack
that went only sideways and
backwards against Penn State and
Michigan. San Jose, meanwhile,
has been effective on the ground
in its first three outings. Hie
Spartans' cumulative rushing total
of 452 yards is exactly 465 more
than Stanford's two-game total.
Fullback Robert Evans is San

Jose's leading ballcarrier, having
rolled up 214 yards on 40 carries
for an impressive 5.4 average.
However Evans, who fractured his
wrist against Long Beach State, is
one of three Spartan starters listed
as "doubtful" by Rogers.
Defensive lineman Dave Wasick,
the team's leading tackier, and
linebacker Emanuel Armstrong
are also questionable starters.
Both teams should frequently
put the ball in the air. Card
quarterback Mike Boryla
currently ranks at the top of the
Pac-8 passing charts and trails
oily Army's Kingley Fry and

Oregon State's Alvin White in the
national statistics. (The NCAA
and the Pac-8 use different
methods to rank passers,
accounting for the fact that
Boryla leads White on the league
list and Whie is ahead nationally.)
Spartan quarterback Craig
Kimball also boasts an impressive
set of statistics. Kimball has
completed 35 passes in 57
attempts for 399 yards and five
touchdowns. Freshman split end
Ike Mcßee has caught 14 of
Kimball's aerials.
A crowd of about 40,000 is
expected for the 1:30 kickoff.

see them doing that at this time.
"We're very fortunate to have
won our first three football
(£mies, but we haven't been tested
like we feel we're going to be
tested during the remainder of the
season."
Who's Lying?
It's hard to tell which coach
was telling the truth. San Jose is
off to its best start since 1955
(with victories so far over Santa
Clara, Fresno State and Long
Beach State), but then again, as
Rogers pointed out, "We're just
not the same calibre of football
team as Penn State and
Michigan."
Stanford's losses to the Nittany
Lions (20-6) and the Wolverines
(47-10) represent the first time
since 1961 that the Cards have
dropped their first two games.
"We've made enough mistakes in
two games to last a whole
season," Christiansen said.
Tomorrow Chris hopes his
charges can eliminate those costly
miscues and steal some of the
Spartans' momentum. "Darryl
Rogers has done a great job of
getting his team off to such a

good start and that momentum is
sometimes tough to stop. We'll
spend this week trying to develop
a little momentum of our own."
Rejuvenate Running
The first item on Christiansen's
list of priorities involves
rejuvenating a Card running attack
that went only sideways and
backwards against Penn State and
Michigan. San Jose, meanwhile,
has been effective on the ground
in its first three outings. Hie
Spartans' cumulative rushing total
of 452 yards is exactly 465 more
than Stanford's two-game total.
Fullback Robert Evans is San

Jose's leading ballcarrier, having
rolled up 214 yards on 40 carries
for an impressive 5.4 average.
However Evans, who fractured his
wrist against Long Beach State, is
one of three Spartan starters listed
as "doubtful" by Rogers.
Defensive lineman Dave Wasick,
the team's leading tackier, and
linebacker Emanuel Armstrong
are also questionable starters.
Both teams should frequently
put the ball in the air. Card
quarterback Mike Boryla
currently ranks at the top of the
Pac-8 passing charts and trails
oily Army's Kingley Fry and

Oregon State's Alvin White in the
national statistics. (The NCAA
and the Pac-8 use different
methods to rank passers,
accounting for the fact that
Boryla leads White on the league
list and Whie is ahead nationally.)
Spartan quarterback Craig
Kimball also boasts an impressive
set of statistics. Kimball has
completed 35 passes in 57
attempts for 399 yards and five
touchdowns. Freshman split end
Ike Mcßee has caught 14 of
Kimball's aerials.
A crowd of about 40,000 is
expected for the 1:30 kickoff.

GOAL LINE STAND—Stanford's Joe Martin (78) stops a Penn State
scoring attempt by John Cappelletti two weeks ago. TTie Cards held
on this play and one more but Cappelletti eventually made it across
the goal line.
Unbeaten San Jose State and
winless Stanford will meet
tomorrow at Stanford Stadium in
a 1:30 p.m. game that will have
very little bearing on national
rankings, the Rose Bowl race or
the front page of any sports
section outside of Northern
California.
But at least one Cardinal fan is
glad that nothing more than the
football championship of Santa
Clara County will be at stake. An
avid Stanford rooter from across
the bay expressed genuine relief
concerning the fact that Stanford
is 0-2 so far this year.
"I should be able to really
enjoy the games now," he wrote
in a letter to Sports Information
Director Bob Murphy. "There's
no pressure anymore. I won't have
to sit on the edge of my seat and
bite my nails like I did during the
Rose Bowl years. Now I can just
enjoy some good football games
and still retain my sanity."
Of course not everyone is
taking a lighthearted appraoch to
tomorrow's game. Tuesday at the
Northern California Football
Writer's luncheon, Stanford coach
Jack Christiansen and first year
San Jose State boss Darryl Rogers

engaged in a mutual praise war
that was lively enough for a
pre-Rose Bowl press conference.
'Quality Team'
"We're playing another quality
football team," Christiansen said.
"San Jose is solid overall,
especially on defense — they have
a strong line, good linebackers and
two cornerbacks who cover as
well as anyone we've seen."
Rogers, meanwhile, was
ebullient in his praise of Stanford.
"They are a great football team —
they do a lot of things well."
"Fumble?" Christiansen
interjected.
"We'll definitely be
outhorsed," Rogers said. "For us
to win Jack's players are almost
going to have to quit and I can't
see them doing that at this time.
"We're very fortunate to have
won our first three football

However Evans, who fractured his
wrist against Long Beach State, is
one of three Spartan starters listed
as "doubtful" by Rogers.
Defensive lineman Dave Wasick,
the team's leading tackier, and
linebacker Emanuel Armstrong
are also questionable starters.
Both teams should frequently
put the ball in the air. Card
quarterback Mike Boryla
currently ranks at the top of the
Pac-8 passing charts and trails
oily Army's Kingley Fry and

Oregon State's Alvin White in the
national statistics. (The NCAA
and the Pac-8 use different
methods to rank passers,
accounting for the fact that
Boryla leads White on the league
list and Whie is ahead nationally.)
Spartan quarterback Craig
Kimball also boasts an impressive
set of statistics. Kimball has
completed 35 passes in 57
attempts for 399 yards and five
touchdowns. Freshman split end
Ike Mcßee has caught 14 of
Kimball's aerials.
A crowd of about 40,000 is
expected for the 1:30 kickoff.

GOAL LINE STAND—Stanford's Joe Martin (78) stops a Penn State
scoring attempt by John Cappelletti two weeks ago. TTie Cards held
on this play and one more but Cappelletti eventually made it across
the goal line.
Unbeaten San Jose State and
winless Stanford will meet
tomorrow at Stanford Stadium in
a 1:30 p.m. game that will have
very little bearing on national
rankings, the Rose Bowl race or
the front page of any sports
section outside of Northern
California.
But at least one Cardinal fan is
glad that nothing more than the
football championship of Santa
Clara County will be at stake. An
avid Stanford rooter from across
the bay expressed genuine relief
concerning the fact that Stanford
is 0-2 so far this year.
"I should be able to really
enjoy the games now," he wrote
in a letter to Sports Information
Director Bob Murphy. "There's
no pressure anymore. I won't have
to sit on the edge of my seat and
bite my nails like I did during the
Rose Bowl years. Now I can just
enjoy some good football games
and still retain my sanity."
Of course not everyone is
taking a lighthearted appraoch to
tomorrow's game. Tuesday at the
Northern California Football
Writer's luncheon, Stanford coach
Jack Christiansen and first year
San Jose State boss Darryl Rogers

engaged in a mutual praise war
that was lively enough for a
pre-Rose Bowl press conference.
'Quality Team'
"We're playing another quality
football team," Christiansen said.
"San Jose is solid overall,
especially on defense — they have
a strong line, good linebackers and
two cornerbacks who cover as
well as anyone we've seen."
Rogers, meanwhile, was
ebullient in his praise of Stanford.
"They are a great football team —
they do a lot of things well."
"Fumble?" Christiansen
interjected.
"We'll definitely be
outhorsed," Rogers said. "For us
to win Jack's players are almost
going to have to quit and I can't
see them doing that at this time.
"We're very fortunate to have
won our first three football
(£mies, but we haven't been tested
like we feel we're going to be
tested during the remainder of the
season."
Who's Lying?
It's hard to tell which coach
was telling the truth. San Jose is
off to its best start since 1955
(with victories so far over Santa
Clara, Fresno State and Long
Beach State), but then again, as
Rogers pointed out, "We're just
not the same calibre of football
team as Penn State and
Michigan."
Stanford's losses to the Nittany
Lions (20-6) and the Wolverines
(47-10) represent the first time
since 1961 that the Cards have
dropped their first two games.
"We've made enough mistakes in
two games to last a whole
season," Christiansen said.
Tomorrow Chris hopes his
charges can eliminate those costly
miscues and steal some of the
Spartans' momentum. "Darryl
Rogers has done a great job of
getting his team off to such a

good start and that momentum is
sometimes tough to stop. We'll
spend this week trying to develop
a little momentum of our own."
Rejuvenate Running
The first item on Christiansen's
list of priorities involves
rejuvenating a Card running attack
that went only sideways and
backwards against Penn State and
Michigan. San Jose, meanwhile,
has been effective on the ground
in its first three outings. Hie
Spartans' cumulative rushing total
of 452 yards is exactly 465 more
than Stanford's two-game total.
Fullback Robert Evans is San

Jose's leading ballcarrier, having
rolled up 214 yards on 40 carries
for an impressive 5.4 average.
However Evans, who fractured his
wrist against Long Beach State, is
one of three Spartan starters listed
as "doubtful" by Rogers.
Defensive lineman Dave Wasick,
the team's leading tackier, and
linebacker Emanuel Armstrong
are also questionable starters.
