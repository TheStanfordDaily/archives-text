# Pac-8 Predictions
## 
### 
This week's Pacific Eight
schedule may be just what the
doctor ordered for the
struggling conference. Pac-8
teams have been suffering from
a freakish disease known as
losing to intersectional
opponents." The disease nearly
reached epidemic proportions
in the Big 10 last season but
hasn't appeared on the West
Coast since 1963, when the
Pac-8 posted a 13-21-2 record
against i ntersectional
opposition.
This week, however, teams
like San Jose State, Syracuse
and Idaho may be weak
enough to restore some
respectability to the
conference, which currently
sports a very undistinguished

non-league record of 3-13. USC
and UCLA will be battling
toughter opponents, but the
two Los Angeles powers should
be able to handle the task
simply on the basis of their
own overpowering strength.
The following predictions,
which will appear weekly in
the Daily, represent the
consensus of one member of
the Daily sports staff, who
wishes to remain anonymous
until further notice.
Stanford 34, San Jose State 9
USC 28, Oklahoma 14
UCLA 37, Michigan State 20
Army 22, California 7
Brigham Young 28, Oregon St. 24
Utah 30, Oregon 14
