# Crimson Tide TD Ruled Illegal
## Alabama Rout Over Col Softened 
### 
From the Associated Press
KNOXVILLE, Tenn-It may not
be much consolation, but the
NCAA Rules Committee has
decided that California's
embarrassing opening game defeat
against Alabama two weeks ago
was by a score of 59-0, not 66-0.
A maneuver Alabama used in
scoring its first touchdown against
Cal has been declared illegal, the
Knoxville News-Sentinel says.
The Alabama play went like
this:
With the ball on the California
11, Coach Paul "Bear" Bryant
sent in Bill Davis, a kicking
specialist, ostensibly to attempt a
field goal. No one came out,
leaving 12 Alabama players on the
field.

Alabama went into a huddle.
As the Crimson Tide broke the
huddle, Davis picked up the
kicking tee and dashed off the
field.
Quarterback Gary Rutledge
took the ball from center on a
quick snap, swung right and
pitched wide to Wilbur Jackson,
who ran in for the score.
The rules committee said the
play is illegal because it violates a
rule that says a team cannot
simulate a substitution "designed
to confuse an opponent." Such a
play carries a 15-yard penalty.

The News-Sentinel said the
NCAA has notified its member
schools of the committee's ruling.
Cal is off to its slowest start in
recent memory, having lost to
Illinois 27-7 in addition to the
debacle at Birmingham.
Tomorrow the Bears travel to
New York to face Army in a game
that will feature a battle of
contrasting football teams as well
as contrasting student body life
styles.
Stanford will meet Cal on Nov.
24 in the 76th Big Game.
