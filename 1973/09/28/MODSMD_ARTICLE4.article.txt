# Faculty Senate Debates Teacher Evaluation
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
The Faculty Senate yesterday, in its
first meeting of the year, began
extensive discussions on proposed new
guidelines for the evaluation of
teaching.
Faculty representatives, acting as "a
committee of the whole," started
informal debate on, and modification
of, a statement of policies handed
down from the Committee on
Academic Appraisal and Achievement
(C-AAA) in May.
The C-AAA report recommends
that every University tenure
appointment and promotion should
involve evaluation of teaching ability.
(The Senate voted in June to
postpone action on the report until
yesterday's meeting.)
No Action
During the meeting, senators took
no official action on the committee's
recommendations, but tentatively
approved the rewording of the first of
four planks, an outline of proposed
departmental teaching evaluation
procedures.

The C-AAA suggested specifically
— that each graduate and
undergraduate division use some
formal procedure of teaching
evaluation approved by the dean of
the school in considering tenure and
promotion
Annual Discussions
— that each department chairman,
or his designated senior faculty
representative [a full professor],
discuss with each junior faculty
member [instructors, assistant and
associate professors] in the
department at least once a year his
teaching performance
— that the chairman provide similar
opportunities for senior faculty
— and that salary increases for
senior faculty should be based on
evaluation of their teaching
performance.
Amendments
During more than 90 minutes of
debate, Senate Chairman J. Dirk
Walecka received five amendments,
three of which were later withdrawn.
Of the remaining two, Sociology
Prof. Sanford Dombusch's amendment
completely reorganized the provisions
and eliminated evaluation distinctions
between junior and senior faculty
members. The Dornbusch amendment
suggested that an annual discussion
between department chairmen and
their entire teaching staff be
mandatory.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James L. Gibbs proposed that several
forms of evaluation, including student
questionnaires, classroom observation
and colleague critiques, be employed
instead of a single technique. Gibbs
said this would help to limit bias from
using any method alone.
Both amendments passed the
Senate on a voice vote.

Law Prof. Howard Williams
expressed concern that yearly
evaluation would become "pure
formality, pure routine matter" and
eventually be meaningless, while Vice
Provost Robert Rosenzweig said
regular evaluation for salary increases
would be a "fanciful notion."
After the meeting, Walecka and
Academic Secretary H. Donald
Winbigler cautioned that yesterday's
Senate action was in no way final.
"The Senate may still choose to reject
the resolution," said Winbigler.
The Senate will resume "committee

of the whole" discussions of the
C-AAA resolutions at its next meeting
in two weeks.
Other Business
In other Senate business,
representatives
— received the annual report from
the C-AAA chairman
— approved the designation of
Economics and Public Policy Prof.
George L. Bach as Vice Chairman of
the Senate
— conferred baccalaureate and
advanced degrees for September.
