Astronauts Return To Houston
SPACE CENTER, Houston — History's most
traveled space adventurers came home yesterday,
back from a 24-million-mile, 59 1 /2-day voyage. Their
wives greeted them driving an antique car bearing
the sign, "Hooray, we made it."
Skylab 2 astronauts Alan L. Bean, Jack R.
Lousma and Dr. Owen K. Garriott, walking slowly,
but feeling fine, greeted their wives with hugs and
kisses and told about 500 assembled space workers,
"We appreciate your efforts."
The astronauts arrived here about 7 p.m. EDT,
flying direct from San Diego, Calif., where they
earlier went through their third medical
examination since returning from space Tuesday.
Bean, the mission commander, said they went
into space with three objectives: "To do the job
right... to do it safe ... and to have a good time.
We accomplished all three."
He said they were recovering from the effects of
weightlessness and felt like they were "getting over
the flu."
Garriott said the mission had "days of adventure,
days of hard work and there was even time for a
little fun."
"I thank God for a safe and successful flight,"
said Lousma. "I thank the American people for
their spirit that makes a flight like this possible."
Wives of the astronauts greeted their husbands in
a 1929 Ford. The women wore long, flowing dresses
and sun bonnets that were fashionable a century
ago. Signs on the car read "59 days or bust" and
"Hooray, we made it."
Bean, Garriott and Lousma laughed at the
costumes and the car as they swept their wives up in
embraces, then drove off in the old car.
Chilean Leftists Executed
SANTIAGO — A firing squad executed the
former leftist governor of Talca yesterday after he
was convicted of killing a policeman and attempting
to blow up a dam.
The victim was identified by the military
government as German Castro Rojas. He was the
first high official of the former regime of President
Salvador Allende to go before a firing squad. The
execution took place in Talca, 140 miles south of
Santiago.
A military communique also said a 26-year-old
man, Teovaldo Saldiva Villalon, was executed in the
town of Quillota, 60 miles west of Santiago. It said
he was arrested Sept. 17 and found guilty of taking
part in an extremist attack on a police patrol.
The two men were the 9th and 10th persons to
be executed after summary courts-martial since the
armed forces overthrew the Allende government in a
bloody coup Sept. 11.
Meanwhile, military authorities relaxed a strict
curfew, leaving Chileans free for the first time since
the coup to take evening strolls and go out to
dinner.
The curfew, enforced by soldiers and police with
submachine guns, had emptied Santiago streets daily
at 8 p.m., earlier than the normal Chilean dinner
hour. Yesterday it was moved back to 10 p.m., a
major step toward normalizing life in this battered
capital.
The military government continued to raid
homes, offices and factories in a hunt for pockets of
leftist resistance. But the ruling junta sought to
assure Chileans that everything is in order.
Gunman Attacks Radio Station
SAN FRANCISCO — A young man fired shots at
a KGO radio talk show host in a bulletproof
streetside studio yesterday, shot another man, then
turned the gun on himself, a KGO spokesman
reported.
Dave Chase of the KGO news department said a
young man attempted to shoot through the
bulletproof glass at show host Jim Dunbar, but
found the window inpenetrable.
The man then tried to enter the station lobby
and shot another KGO employee, wounding him at

least twice with the ,22-caliber Colt automatic
pistol, Chase said.
The gunman sprinted down Hyde Street to
McAllister, reloaded and shot himself, he said.
Both men were in critical condition when taken
from the scene to Mission Emergency Hospital,
police said.
Newswriter Paula Mehr, who was in the studio at
the time of the shooting, said, "Somebody came
running up and said 'Ben Munson was shot.'
Another salesman knocked the gun aside. This guy
ran onto McAllister and shot himself in the head."
She said that had the plate glass in front of
Dunbar not been bulletproof, it would have killed
him.
Soviets Launch Manned Flight
MOSCOW The Soviet Union launched its first
manned space flight in more than two years
yesterday, sending two cosmonauts on a test
mission in a new Soyuz craft that was powered into
earth orbit.
The Soyuz 12 spaceship was launched on a
two-day flight from the Soviet space center at
Baikonur on the Kazakhstan plains in central Asia,
Tass news agency announced.
Soyuz 12 carries two rookie spacemen, Lt. Col.
Vasily Lazarev, the commander, and flight engineer
Oleg Makarov.
The craft is an "improved" version of the Soyuz
ship in which three cosmonauts were killed at the
end of the last manner Soviet mission in 1971.
Tass said the mission will include
"comprehensive checking and testing of the
improved flight systems, further testing of the
process of manual and automatic control in various
flight conditions."
The Soviet launching came just two days after
three American astronauts returned from a record
591/2-day flight in space aboard Skylab 2.
The previous Soyuz 11 mission ended in disaster
on June 30, 1971, when the three-man crew died on
return to earth because the craft's hatch failed to
close properly after undocking from the orbiting
Salyut 1 space laboratory.
The Soyuz craft was sent back for redesign. Last
April the Soviets launched another space lab and
planned to send a new manned Soyuz vehicle to
dock with it.
But the orbiting laboratory broke up in space
and the manned mission was scratched.
Senate Rejects Sub Slowdown
WASHINGTON — The Senate refused yesterday
to block the Navy's full speed ahead schedule for
development and production of a $13 billion fleet
of Trident submarines.
By a 49 to 47 vote, the Senate turned down an
amendment to a $21 billion weapons authorization
bill to stretch out production two years and delay
completion of the first of 10 of the larger vessels by
two years.
The Navy proposes to get the first of the
540-foot submarines, equipped with a new longer
range 4000-mile Trident missile, ready for launching
by 1978.
At the White House, deputy press secretary
Gerald L. Warren said President Nixon was
"extremely gratified" with the rejection of the
Trident amendment. Warren also restated the
President's delight with the defeat of a move
Wednesday to cut U.S. troop strength in Europe.
The Trident slowdown was proposed by Sens.
Thomas J. Mclntyre, D-N.H., and Peter H.
Dominick, R-Colo., senior members of the Senate
Armed Services subcommittee on research and
development.
They argued that the Navy plan to pull all 10
Trident submarines under construction before the
first can be tested in operation risks, without
military justification, costly engineering errors.
Mclntyre referred the Senate to cost overruns on
the abandoned Cheyenne Helicopter and the Fill
and CSA military aircraft as examples of proceeding
with production before research, development and

testing is completed.
Plane Crash Ruled Aecidenlal
WASHINGTON — The Chicago plane crash that
killed a congressman and the wife of convicted
Watergate defendant E. Howard Hunt was caused by
pilot error — not by sabotage, the National
Transportation Safety Board said yesterday.
Forty-three of the 61 passengers and crew
members died when the United Air Lines jet crashed
into a residential area near Chicago's Midway
Airport. Two other persons on the ground were
killed in the crash and in the resulting fire. Five
homes were destroyed.
Among those killed in the crash last Dec. 8 were
Rep. George W. Collins, D-IIL, and CBS newswoman
Michele Clark.
The safety board said the probable cause of the
accident was .. the captain's failure to exercise
positive flight management." This resulted, the
board concluded, in the plane losing its air speed
and going into a stall on a landing attempt.
The board said it found no evidence of sabotage
or foul play in connection with the crash. Chicago
legal researcher Sherman Skolnick had claimed the
plane was sabotaged because, he claimed, 12 of the
passengers were directly linked with Watergate. He
said some of those passengers had documents on
them that linked President Nixon and former Atty.
Gen. John Mitchell with Watergate. Mrs. Hunt had
$10,000 in $100 bills in her purse when she died.
The safety board, noting the "allegations of foul
play which have been injected into the publicity
surrounding this accident," said it found "no
evidence of any medical condition that would have
incapacited the crew or of any interference with the
crew in the performance of their duties.
'The finding of elevated levels of carbon
monoxide and cyanide in some of the victims was
consistent with death due to smoke inhalation in
the conditions existing during the post-crash fire,"
the board added.
That statement referred to autopsies that showed
traces of cyanide and carbon monoxide in the blood
streams of some of the victims. The two chemicals
are formed when wool, cotton, paper or plastic
decompose during fires. Traces of the chemicals
have been found in victims of other aircraft fires.
The board said its investigation showed the
aircraft and its engines and flight controls were
airworthy at the time of the accident.
It said the plane's captain had called for the first
and second officers to read out a checklist while the
plane was approaching the runway.
This meant the first officer could not make "any
of the required altitude callouts," the board said,
"nor does it appear that he was monitoring air speed
and rate of descent."
Braves 9 Slugger Rained Out
ATLANTA — Hank Aaron's march toward Babe
Ruth's record 714 career home runs was delayed
last night when the scheduled baseball game
between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Atlanta
Braves was rained out.

Matthew's lineup for last night's game which won't
be rescheduled.
Although the Braves have an open date today,
the Dodgers travel to San Diego to meet the Padres
tonight. The regular baseball season ends Sunday.
