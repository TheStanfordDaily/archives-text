# Venceremos Disbands; Group Localism Blamed
## 
### BILL EVERS 
The Venceremos organization, a
Bay Area communist revolutionary
group active in Stanford and Palo Alto
politics for the last two and one-half
years, has disbanded.
A state prison officer this summer
had called Venceremos "probably the
most dangerous group there is in
existence right now on the streets."
The group had been disintegrating
at a rapid rate since the late spring,
and the last large elements remaining
decided over the course of the last ten
days to leave the organization.
A final issue of the Venceremos
newspaper, will be published in a
week. It will contain an essay-length
attack by the group's Central

Committee on what these leaders
consider the too narrowly local, Bay
Area-oriented perspective of many of
the organization's members.
There were three waves of exodus
from Venceremos during the summer.
First came the collectives from the
East Bay. Then came the collectives in
San Mateo County, concentrated in
Redwood City, Menlo Park and South
San Francisco. Finally, the collectives
in San Francisco and in Palo Alto
decided that the organization was too
small and no longer viable. So they left
too.
No Rancor, Bitterness
The members in San Jose and much
of the central leadership stayed until
the end. The splitting up of the
organization occurred without the
rancor and bitterness that often
accompanies divisions in left-wing
parties. As one member put it, "We are
not at each other's throats."
The local collectives which left
Venceremos during the summer saw
the organization's central leadership as
inclined toward quick, ill-considered
efforts at merging with other
communist groups to form a
communist party. These local
collective groups desired to re-evaluate
the experience of Venceremos in the
Bay Area and revamp the
organization's policies before moving
on to the formation of a national
communist party.
Most of these people believe that
they still adhere to the basic political
views they shared when they were in
the organization. They have not
repudiated Venceremos' unique stress
on armed self-defense and on the
nationalism of ethnic minorities. But
they say they wanted to move
ideologically beyond the provisions of
Venceremos' organizational
constitution.
They maintain that the

organization's political line was not
related to its practice. They add that
the content of its political line was not
being systematically reviewed and
claim that strategic thinking was
inadequate. One spoke of the need for
a political line that was "more
developed, more precise, more
concrete."
The question these people posed to
those in the leadership of the
organization was, as one put it, "How
can we talk about national
revolutionary action, when we're not
even talking to the people right around
us." These collectives foresaw months
of self-critical analysis of Venceremos'
past activities and months of further
work on building more support for
Venceremos in the Bay Area before
steps toward creating a national party
should properly be taken.
Many of these collectives are still
on-going entities. Members are talking
of putting out a Bay Area newspaper.
They describe what they envisage as a
"proletarian Berkeley Tribe."
Group Coordination
Members of these collectives also
expect to co-ordinate some of their
activities with the work of the radical
National Lawyers Guild and with the
Chino Defense Committee, which
supports defendants charged in
connection with an Oct. 1972
ambush-escape in which an unarmed
guard was murdered.
In response to the collective groups'
criticism, members of the central
leadership such as fired Stanford
English Prof. H. Bruce Franklin
condemn what they describe as a
"disease" of "localism" that was
eating away at the work of the
organization.
The leadership argued that "you
can't make a revolution in the San
Francisco Bay Area." It spoke of the
necessity for one strategy, one
political line, throughout the United
States on the ground that America is a
single society, argued that an
organization whose aim was the
overthrow of the U.S. government had
to be prepared to meet the capitalist
class and the government on a
nationwide basis.
Narrowness Hit
The majority of the central
committee felt that too many
members lacked a nationwide
perspective. One talked of the
development of "an unbelievable
narrowing of geographical focus that
had been going on over a long period
of time." The result was differing
general political lines for San
Francisco and San Jose.
One prominent former member of
Venceremos, who was active in the
Stanford anti-war and anti-ROTC
movements and has now joined the
new Community Union, left because
he came to disagree with the political
theory and the practical political work
he found in Venceremos.
(The Community Union was
formed this month by 60 people as a
Midpeninsula vehicle for leftist
politics. It publishes The Grapevine.)
He and some others were
dissatisfied with the lack of attention
in Venceremos to psychological and
cultural dimensions of political
matters. He was dismayed that
Venceremos members were unfamiliar
with much of twentieth-century
Marxist theory.
'Sterile Quoting'
He cited what he called "sterile
quoting of the classics," including
Marx and Engels, rather than study
and use of contemporary Marxist
thinkers. These weaknesses in
theoretical matters, according to this
dissident, were combined with an
"isolation of the central leadership"
from the members and a passive
"employee mentality" on the part of
many members.
He also spoke of an "ultra-leftist"
tendency in the organization,
specifically the "heavy emphasis on
guns and armed struggle" at a time
when this was "not on minds of
everyone in the country" and "beating
everyone over the head" with
race-related matters rather than
seriously concerning itself with what
were the interests of laborers as a
social class.
The central leadership of the
organization rejected the Hegelian
Marxist political ideas of this member
as "bullshit" and "theory that hasn't
worked." The leadership said it
preferred study of Mao, Stalin, Ho
Chi Minh, and Kim 11-Sung.
Some criticisms of the past
activities of the organization seemed
to be shared by all elements, including

the leadership. The organization's
constitution assigns a majority of the
central leadership positions to
members of ethnic minorities.
Members of all races told the Daily
that this quota system had sometimes
led to inexperienced people being
elevated to leadership roles as
"tokens." One black told of the
"white guilt" phenomenon, but said it
had been diminishing.
Insufficient Education
Generally there was agreement that
both internal and external political
education had been insufficient.
Dissidents blamed this on the leaders;
a leader said he did not know whom to
blame, but cited the anti-theoretical
proclivites of American culture and
the anti-intellectualism of ex-students
trying to live down their past.
Organizational malfunctioning in
the final days added to disillusionment
with the leaders, as necessary
directives were not forthcoming from
the central committee. The lessening
of useful guidance from the center
gave further impetus to the already
strong centrifugal forces.
Only a few members considered
that police repression had been a
significant factor in the dissolution.
One said, "We definitely were not
smashed by the pigs." The numerous
legal cases and intense police
infiltration "did not cause the
disbanding," according to another. But
all agreed that while the organizations
internal political problems were the
primary cause, trouble with the police
intensified those internal problems.
