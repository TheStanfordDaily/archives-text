# Public Safety Officers Undergo Extensive Deputization Training
## 
### ROSARIO De La TORRE 
Officers of Stanford's Public Safety
Department are receiving "fairly
extensive" police academy training to
become deputized Santa Clara County
Sheriff's officers, according to
Stanford Capt. Frank Benederet.
Officers are trained at either
California State University, San Jose
or in Modesto. Benederet noted that
the academy at Modesto "was one of
the first academies in the country to
provide training on a regional basis. It
receives federal funds and is able to
provide excellent facilities but it only
offers four programs per year."
Consequently, San Jose is used to train
deputies when Modesto is not
available.
The Commission of Peace Officers
Standards and Training requires a
minimum of 200 hours for
accreditation. Benederet stressed that
Stanford deputies receive "twice the
minimum, or 400 hours of training."
Training includes both physical and
academic instruction. Trainees are
taught self-defense and controling
prisoners. Much of the physical
training centers around daily running
to keep the trainees fit.
Trainees are also given instruction
in rules of evidence, conducting
searches and other legal matters.
In addition the students receive
instruction in identifying behavior and
in dealing with people. Benederet
concluded that the trainees "receive
training in both the theory and
practical aspects of law enforcement."
The screening procedure for
officers has also been made more
extensive. Before the department

reorganization started, "there was
almost no screening of applicants,"
Benederet commented. "If the chief
liked thy person, he was hired."
Applicants for the department must
now have at least four years of either
education or experience in law
enforcement, or a combination of
either. "Most members of the

department presently hold a B.A.
degree," Benederet stated.
"There is no height, sex or upper
age requirement or limit. Candidates
must be of proportionate height for
their weight," he added.
After the candidates fulfill these
requirements, top candidates are
