# Suit Against Nixon, Agnew
## People's Lawsuit Growing 
### 
In April of this year the idea of a lawsuit to s#»t
aside the 19?2 election was raided at a meetinp of
ttie national Guild leadershiD. The tip of the
"Watergate" icpber<* had recently surfaced, but it
was not vet clear if anv substantial involvement of
any high government official would be uncovered.
TTie suggestion of the lawsuit brought forth a ripple
of lauPhtc, but after a few moments the laughter
died and an air of excitement swept across the
meeting
At first glance the suit seamed slightly
unbelievable: after all, it had at its heart the removal
o f the President and Vice-President — an act which
had never before conceived of as even a remote
possibility. Howevpr, this suit also had the potential
to provide for thp direct participation of the peode
in the major crisis which was starting to unravel.
Although the lawsuit appeared far-fetched, the
Guild tx'gan to investigate the possibility of actually
going ahead.
What seemed to be a pipe dream only a few
months ago, today is an exciting reality. The
People's Lawsuit To Set Aside The 1972 Elections is
rapidly gathering momentum in a nationwide effort.
WHAT IS THE BASIS
OF THE SUIT?
The legal actions in the suit are based on the
thesis that the American people have been deprived
of their right to choose their highest elected officials
by a widespread illegal conspiracy which operated
through a serips of crimes and unconstitutional acts
including burglary, unlawful surveillance, misuse of
judicial procpss (grand juries and frame-up trials),
misuse of government agencies (FBI, CIA, IRS)
forced letters and other illegal campaign frauds,
extortion, intimidation, perjury, sabotage, and the
list goes on and on.
Once a procedure for the selection of presidential
electors is established and every state provides for
their election bv the registered voters — it is
constitutionally mandated that the process must be
fair and open. That is the essence of our "republican
form of government" guaranteed by the Declaration
of Indenendence and the Preamble and Art. IV, Sec.
4 of the Constitution. Furthermore, the violation of
criminal statutes in the course of the effort to insure
the Nixon victory independently gives rise to our
civil action to void the elections.
The theories which have been developed are
designed to reflect not only the legal problems of
bringing a suit, but the political objectives as well.
This can be seen, for example, in the use of the
concept of "free elections": how often has that
banner been raised to justify American Foreign
policy? Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, Latin America,
have all seen American intervention and destruction
in the name of free and open elections. The 1954
elections in Vietnam were halted by the
Eisenhower-Nixon administration because the U.S.
claimed that fair elections had been compromised.
But in 1972 it is the American people who claim
that fair elections have been compromised; in fact,
that the American elections were effectively called
off by the cover illegal activities of the
Nixon-Agnew administration.
It is also important that the complaint reflect the
fact that the illegal and unconstitutional acts carried
out by the Nixon administration were only one part
of a much more expansive policy; the other parts
are manifest in the international and domestic
policies: cutbacks in social and economic programs
for poor and working people; the policy of
destruction in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos; the
''Southern Strategy" of dividing the ountry by
racism; the "Workfare" program of forced cheap
labor for welfare recipients; and the wage freeze and
price escalation.
WHY A PEOPLE'S LAWSUIT?
Even though the legal and factual research points
toward the success of the suit, we know that our

National Lawyer's Guild

ability to win is as much a political question as it is
a legal one. Throughout our history many important
victories have been won in the courtroom but in
almost every instance (e.g., the antiwar movement's
mobilizations against U.S. imperialist policies in
Southeast Asia and the civil rights movement's
direct action against segregation) it was the
participation of thousands of people that brought
about the real change.
In cities throughout the country the Guild, other
movements organizations and many local groups are
setting up "Committees to Set Aside the 1972
Elections." This is the way thousands of people can
be directly involved in the largest crisis in the ruling
class since World War 11. A plaintiff in this lawsuit
can be more than an armchair observer of the
Senate Committee or a signature on a petition to an
intransigent Congress-person.
After the Watergate Workshop at the Chicago
National Executive Board meeting, the National
Office sent out a memo in Guild chapters and
contacts asking for guidance on key political and
legal questions. The response from all corners of the
country was both enthusiastic and helpful.
ONWARD THROUGH THE WATER
At this point, a draft of the complaint has been
completed. Guild chapters and sympathetic friends
are currently going over this draft making
suggestions, criticism, additions, subtractions, etc.
Many individuals and organizations are working
closely with the Guild to make the complaint
comprehensible to people with no legal training.
This process should be completed soon, and we will
be ready to file the final complaint in United States
District Court sometime in September. Even after
filing we expect to amend the complaint especially
for the addition of the many thousands of new
plaintiffs who can join the suit after September.
There is plenty to be done on the suit for any
Guild chapter, individual or organization who
would like to participate. At this stage of the
proceedings the work consists of:
1. LEGAL RESEARCH Each cause of the action
and each legal allegation must be thoroughly backed
up by a memo of points and authorities. This is
exciting legal research and everyone is encouraged
to take "a piece of the action."
2. FACTUAL INVESTIGATION Each of the
factual allegations has to be expanded, detailed, and
documented. The task is monumental and all
indications point to the possibility of filling up
more volumes than "Corpus Juris Secundum." We
outlined the various incidents and divided up the
categories so that it is possible to research a
manageable chunk.
3. COMMITTEES Committees to Set Aside the
Election have been the main form through which
people can join the suit as plaintiffs in each local
area. If no Committee exists in your citv or school,
one can be started. The Committees can become the
place where many groups work together to create
focal points of political education and direct action.
This work is being coordinated by the Guild
National Office with help from other groups. All
Guild chapters or contacts can obtain a copy of the
draft complaint. The
1. People's Lawsuit brochure. Four page simple
presentation of the suit. Includes plaintiff
authorization form.
2. Plaintiff Authorization Cards.
