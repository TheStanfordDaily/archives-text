# Improved SJS Tests Frustrated Cardinals
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
This time, the Stanford-San
Jose State game might be more
than the extra ticket fans get
stuck with when they buy their
season's passes.
New coach Darryl Rogers
brings his Spartans into Stanford
Stadium for today's 1:30 game
with a 3-0 record, a mark which
represents SJS's best start since
1955.
And while Stanford's offense
hopes to come out of hibernation
today against a perennially weak
foe, it just could be that Jack
Christiansen's Cardinals are in for
a rude awakening.
But to hear Rogers tell it, the
Spartans don't have much chance
to come out of the game with
anything more than bruises.
Still well Too Strong
"Stanford has such great
athletes in people like Roger
Stillwell [defensive end]. I think
he will undoubtably replace any
four of our people," Rogers said.
"I hope we can get out of the
game alive."
Tuesday, Rogers poor-mouthed
his team's chances, saying "I think
Stanford does some things very
well..
Christiansen interrupted the
speech: "Fumble?"
Three fumbles and a like
number of interceptions, plus a
blocked punt, have been key
reasons why Stanford has lost its

first two games, a 20-6 loss to
Penn State and a 47-10
shellacking at the hands of
Michigan.
SJS is certainly not in a class
with either of those teams, but, as
Christiansen said after the
Michigan loss, "we can't make
mistakes like that against Vassar."
Last year, Stanford crushed
SJS 44-0 in the annual "Santa
Clara County Championship"
game to take a 26-3 lead in the
series. In order to come close to
matching that margin this year,
the Cardinals must show a more
potent running attack than they
have demonstrated in the first two
gpmes.
Minus Yardage
Thus far, Cardinal running
backs John Winesberry and Scott
Laidlaw have averaged only 1.9
and 2.5 yards per carry,
respectively. Yardage lost by Mike
Boryla while attempting to pass
has more than erased even this
measly total.
In order for the running game
to succeed, and for Boryla to get
more time to throw, Stanford's
young offensive line must block
better than in previous games.
Boryla leads the Pacific Eight
conference in passing after two
games, but has led Stanford to
only two touchdowns.
While the Cardinal offense is a
question-mark, there are no such
doubts about the Stanford

defense.
Even against Michigan, the
defense played reasonably well, as
offensive turnovers led to the
one-sided score.
San Jose, which thus far has
run on a majority of plays, will
find it difficult to gain much
yardage against Stillwell, Pete
Hanson, Joe Martin, and Pete
Donovan, the Stanford front four,
who even contained Penn State's
star running back John Cappelletti
well.
Spartan quarterback Craig
Kimball has thus far been most
impressive, completing 61.4
percent of his aeriels. Kimball has
an excellent receiver in split end
Ike Mcßee, who has caught 14
passes thus far in the year.
But once again, San Jose State
will find it difficult to move
against the Cards' outstanding
defensive secondary.
Not Much To Do
According to Rogers, "I don't
know what you can do against
them [Stanford]. At this point I
don't see a whole lot."
The Spartans' prospects of
significantly denting the
Cardinals' defense are bleak.
But SJS's defense has been
tough so far, allowing an average
of only eight points per game, and
it will take a lot more offensive
punch than has thus far been
demonstrated for Stanford to win
a breather.

offensive turnovers led to the
one-sided score.
San Jose, which thus far has
run on a majority of plays, will
find it difficult to gain much
yardage against Stillwell, Pete
Hanson, Joe Martin, and Pete
Donovan, the Stanford front four,
who even contained Penn State's
star running back John Cappelletti
well.
Spartan quarterback Craig
Kimball has thus far been most
impressive, completing 61.4
percent of his aeriels. Kimball has
an excellent receiver in split end
Ike Mcßee, who has caught 14
passes thus far in the year.
But once again, San Jose State
will find it difficult to move
against the Cards' outstanding
defensive secondary.
Not Much To Do
According to Rogers, "I don't
know what you can do against
them [Stanford]. At this point I
don't see a whole lot."
The Spartans' prospects of
significantly denting the
Cardinals' defense are bleak.
But SJS's defense has been
tough so far, allowing an average
of only eight points per game, and
it will take a lot more offensive
punch than has thus far been
demonstrated for Stanford to win
a breather.

NOT STONE-FINGERED — Stanford tight end Glen Stone has been
one of the few pleasant surprises on the Stanford offense. He is tied
for the Cardinal lead in receptions with seven and also caught a
touchdown pass for the team's only score against Penn State.
This time, the Stanford-San
Jose State game might be more
than the extra ticket fans get
stuck with when they buy their
season's passes.
New coach Darryl Rogers
brings his Spartans into Stanford
Stadium for today's 1:30 game
with a 3-0 record, a mark which
represents SJS's best start since
1955.
And while Stanford's offense
hopes to come out of hibernation
today against a perennially weak
foe, it just could be that Jack
Christiansen's Cardinals are in for
a rude awakening.
But to hear Rogers tell it, the
Spartans don't have much chance
to come out of the game with
anything more than bruises.
Still well Too Strong
"Stanford has such great
athletes in people like Roger
Stillwell [defensive end]. I think
he will undoubtably replace any
four of our people," Rogers said.
"I hope we can get out of the
game alive."
Tuesday, Rogers poor-mouthed
his team's chances, saying "I think
Stanford does some things very
well..
Christiansen interrupted the
speech: "Fumble?"
Three fumbles and a like
number of interceptions, plus a
blocked punt, have been key
reasons why Stanford has lost its

first two games, a 20-6 loss to
Penn State and a 47-10
shellacking at the hands of
Michigan.
SJS is certainly not in a class
with either of those teams, but, as
Christiansen said after the
Michigan loss, "we can't make
mistakes like that against Vassar."
Last year, Stanford crushed
SJS 44-0 in the annual "Santa
Clara County Championship"
game to take a 26-3 lead in the
series. In order to come close to
matching that margin this year,
the Cardinals must show a more
potent running attack than they
have demonstrated in the first two
gpmes.
Minus Yardage
Thus far, Cardinal running
backs John Winesberry and Scott
Laidlaw have averaged only 1.9
and 2.5 yards per carry,
respectively. Yardage lost by Mike
Boryla while attempting to pass
has more than erased even this
measly total.
In order for the running game
to succeed, and for Boryla to get
more time to throw, Stanford's
young offensive line must block
better than in previous games.
Boryla leads the Pacific Eight
conference in passing after two
games, but has led Stanford to
only two touchdowns.
While the Cardinal offense is a
question-mark, there are no such
doubts about the Stanford

defense.
Even against Michigan, the
