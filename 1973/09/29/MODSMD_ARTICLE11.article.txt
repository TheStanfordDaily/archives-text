# Forrie Martin: Some See Red Above The Jersey
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
It's not hard to spot Forrie
Martin on the Stanford campus.
He's the guy with the crew cut —
the guy who's neck is so bare that
onlookers automatically classify it
as red.
"I'm fairly conservative,"
Martin admits. "Most people
would probably label me as a
red-neck but that's because people
don't realize where my head's at."
Middle linebacker Forrie Martin
is also easy to find on the football
field. There, however, everyone
knows where Forrie's head's at.
It's always right in the middle of
the play and often ends up in the
pit of some unlucky running
back's stomach.
Forrie Martin is a Stanford
junior who linebacker coach Ray
Handley thinks can be as good as
former Card All-American Jeff
Siemon. He weighs 225 pounds
but is the fastest man on the
Stanford team according to spring
practice 40-yard dash times
(Forrie ran 4.5). He played high
school football on the same team
as UCLA stars James McAlister
and Kermit Johnson (Blair High
School in Pasadena was 11-0,
averaged 48 points a game and
was the unofficial national
champion in 1969).
He passed up last year's
football trip to Hawaii for a
chemistry test and spent a good
part of last week's five-and-a-half
hour flight home from Michigan
reading a book entitled

"Vertebrate Adaptations." He has
also said that Richard Nixon "is in
many respects a great president."
All of which makes Forrie
Martin a unique football player
and a very unique contemporary
college student.
Fanaticism
Forrie approaches football with
an attitude that borders on
fanaticism. "I always want to
fight against whatever's coming at
me," he explains. "Middle
linebackers are like that."
"Forrie's an aggressive sort,"
says Handley. "He really gets
emotionally involved — he always
goes full speed, even when every
other player is dragging."
"Desire is the key," Forrie says.
"Anyone who puts his mind to
something can do it even with
adequate talent. If I ever lose my
desire I'm lost."
As a freshman Forrie found his
adjustment to the Stanford
community difficult when some
of his intense desires accompanied
him off the football field. "I took
very dynamic stands and alienated
a lot of people," he recalls. "I just
made myself miserable."
During the 1972 student strike
protesting increased U.S. bombing
in Cambodia, Forrie decided he
couldn't cope with a large group
of students who blockaded the
door to his human biology class.
His leg was in a cast at the time so
he called the police and was
escorted into class.
"Under certain circumstances

you've just got to be an asshole,"
Forrie explained.
Personality Change
Since then, however, Forrie has
mellowed considerably. "I came
here with a lot of
misconceptions," he says, "many
of which were due to my
conservative, middle class
background. I think I've mellowed
somewhat even though I still take
strong stands.
"Stanford has been great for
me — you develop here as a
mature person. I've learned how
to live with people better and am
more tolerant in the way I view
the world."
Martin's peers at Stanford have
noticed the character change but
it's doubtful that any opposing
football players would call Forrie
"tolerant." Last week against
Michigan he was in on nine tackles
and against Penn State he stopped
11 enemy ballcarriers.
"He's getting better every
week," says Handley. "I think he
can eventually be as good as
Siemon but that's still a while off
since he didn't get a lot of playing
time last year."
"I spent most of my time either
in a hospital bed or training
quarters my first two years,"
Martin said. "This is my first
really healthy year at Stanford."
Medical Aspirations
Now, the football field and the
library have replaced the hospital
as Forrie's favorite hangouts. He is
a biochemistry major who plans
to go into medicine, even at the
expense of a possible professional
football career.
"Pro football is definitely one
option I'm leaving open," he says,
"but if football interfered with
my education as a doctor I'd have
to choose medicine."
But Forrie remains
overwhelmingly self-confident
despite his hesitancy to consider
pro football as a career. "I might
be a little small for a middle
linebacker [6-0, 225], but I still
think I could make it as a pro.
Plenty of guys my size have made
it before — I've got good speed
and I think I could do it."
With nine games remaining in
1973 and his entire senior season
ahead of him, Forrie's current
concerns involve helping Stanford
regain national football
prominence and improving his
already advanced linebacking
skills.
Even at this young stage in his
career he has often been
compared to Siemon and some
observers have noticed strong
likenesses to such famed middle
linebackers as Ray Nitchske and
Dick Butkus. Forrie, however,
dismisses all comparisons.
"I don't pattern myself after
anyone," he says, his face
assuming a sudden seriousness.
"I'm enough of an egotist to think
that Forrie Martin is different
from anyone else."

protesting increased U.S. bombing
in Cambodia, Forrie decided he
couldn't cope with a large group
of students who blockaded the
door to his human biology class.
His leg was in a cast at the time so
he called the police and was
escorted into class.
"Under certain circumstances

you've just got to be an asshole,"
Forrie explained.
Personality Change
Since then, however, Forrie has
mellowed considerably. "I came
here with a lot of
misconceptions," he says, "many
of which were due to my
conservative, middle class
background. I think I've mellowed
somewhat even though I still take
strong stands.
"Stanford has been great for
me — you develop here as a
mature person. I've learned how
to live with people better and am
more tolerant in the way I view
the world."
Martin's peers at Stanford have
noticed the character change but
it's doubtful that any opposing
football players would call Forrie
"tolerant." Last week against
Michigan he was in on nine tackles
and against Penn State he stopped
11 enemy ballcarriers.
"He's getting better every
week," says Handley. "I think he
can eventually be as good as
Siemon but that's still a while off
since he didn't get a lot of playing
time last year."
"I spent most of my time either
in a hospital bed or training
quarters my first two years,"
Martin said. "This is my first
really healthy year at Stanford."
Medical Aspirations
Now, the football field and the
library have replaced the hospital
as Forrie's favorite hangouts. He is
a biochemistry major who plans
to go into medicine, even at the
expense of a possible professional
football career.
"Pro football is definitely one
option I'm leaving open," he says,
"but if football interfered with
my education as a doctor I'd have
to choose medicine."
But Forrie remains
overwhelmingly self-confident
despite his hesitancy to consider
pro football as a career. "I might
be a little small for a middle
linebacker [6-0, 225], but I still
think I could make it as a pro.
Plenty of guys my size have made
it before — I've got good speed
and I think I could do it."
With nine games remaining in
1973 and his entire senior season
ahead of him, Forrie's current
concerns involve helping Stanford
regain national football
prominence and improving his
already advanced linebacking
skills.
Even at this young stage in his
career he has often been
compared to Siemon and some
observers have noticed strong
likenesses to such famed middle
linebackers as Ray Nitchske and
Dick Butkus. Forrie, however,
dismisses all comparisons.
"I don't pattern myself after
anyone," he says, his face
assuming a sudden seriousness.
"I'm enough of an egotist to think
that Forrie Martin is different
from anyone else."

MEAN MAN IN THE MIDDLE — Forrie Martin, who combines
sprint-calibre speed with almost fanatic desire, may be Stanford's next
All-American middle linebacker. Martin anchors an outstanding
Cardinal linebacking corps which also includes Gordie Riegel and Geb
Church.
It's not hard to spot Forrie
Martin on the Stanford campus.
He's the guy with the crew cut —
the guy who's neck is so bare that
onlookers automatically classify it
as red.
"I'm fairly conservative,"
Martin admits. "Most people
would probably label me as a
red-neck but that's because people
don't realize where my head's at."
Middle linebacker Forrie Martin
is also easy to find on the football
field. There, however, everyone
knows where Forrie's head's at.
It's always right in the middle of
the play and often ends up in the
pit of some unlucky running
back's stomach.
Forrie Martin is a Stanford
junior who linebacker coach Ray
Handley thinks can be as good as
former Card All-American Jeff
Siemon. He weighs 225 pounds
but is the fastest man on the
Stanford team according to spring
practice 40-yard dash times
(Forrie ran 4.5). He played high
school football on the same team
as UCLA stars James McAlister
and Kermit Johnson (Blair High
School in Pasadena was 11-0,
averaged 48 points a game and
was the unofficial national
champion in 1969).
He passed up last year's
football trip to Hawaii for a
chemistry test and spent a good
part of last week's five-and-a-half
hour flight home from Michigan
reading a book entitled

"Vertebrate Adaptations." He has
also said that Richard Nixon "is in
many respects a great president."
All of which makes Forrie
Martin a unique football player
and a very unique contemporary
college student.
Fanaticism
Forrie approaches football with
an attitude that borders on
fanaticism. "I always want to
fight against whatever's coming at
me," he explains. "Middle
linebackers are like that."
"Forrie's an aggressive sort,"
says Handley. "He really gets
emotionally involved — he always
goes full speed, even when every
other player is dragging."
"Desire is the key," Forrie says.
"Anyone who puts his mind to
something can do it even with
adequate talent. If I ever lose my
desire I'm lost."
As a freshman Forrie found his
adjustment to the Stanford
community difficult when some
of his intense desires accompanied
him off the football field. "I took
very dynamic stands and alienated
a lot of people," he recalls. "I just
made myself miserable."
During the 1972 student strike
protesting increased U.S. bombing
in Cambodia, Forrie decided he
couldn't cope with a large group
of students who blockaded the

career he has often been

MEAN MAN IN THE MIDDLE — Forrie Martin, who combines
sprint-calibre speed with almost fanatic desire, may be Stanford's next
All-American middle linebacker. Martin anchors an outstanding
Cardinal linebacking corps which also includes Gordie Riegel and Geb
Church.
It's not hard to spot Forrie
Martin on the Stanford campus.
He's the guy with the crew cut —
the guy who's neck is so bare that
onlookers automatically classify it
as red.
"I'm fairly conservative,"
Martin admits. "Most people
would probably label me as a
red-neck but that's because people
don't realize where my head's at."
Middle linebacker Forrie Martin
is also easy to find on the football
field. There, however, everyone
knows where Forrie's head's at.
It's always right in the middle of
the play and often ends up in the
pit of some unlucky running
back's stomach.
Forrie Martin is a Stanford
junior who linebacker coach Ray
Handley thinks can be as good as
former Card All-American Jeff
Siemon. He weighs 225 pounds
but is the fastest man on the
Stanford team according to spring
practice 40-yard dash times
(Forrie ran 4.5). He played high
school football on the same team
as UCLA stars James McAlister
and Kermit Johnson (Blair High
School in Pasadena was 11-0,
averaged 48 points a game and
was the unofficial national
champion in 1969).
He passed up last year's
football trip to Hawaii for a
chemistry test and spent a good
part of last week's five-and-a-half
hour flight home from Michigan
reading a book entitled

"Vertebrate Adaptations." He has
also said that Richard Nixon "is in
many respects a great president."
All of which makes Forrie
Martin a unique football player
and a very unique contemporary
college student.
Fanaticism
Forrie approaches football with
an attitude that borders on
fanaticism. "I always want to
fight against whatever's coming at
me," he explains. "Middle
linebackers are like that."
"Forrie's an aggressive sort,"
says Handley. "He really gets
emotionally involved — he always
goes full speed, even when every
other player is dragging."
"Desire is the key," Forrie says.
"Anyone who puts his mind to
something can do it even with
adequate talent. If I ever lose my
desire I'm lost."
As a freshman Forrie found his
adjustment to the Stanford
community difficult when some
of his intense desires accompanied
him off the football field. "I took
very dynamic stands and alienated
a lot of people," he recalls. "I just
made myself miserable."
During the 1972 student strike
protesting increased U.S. bombing
in Cambodia, Forrie decided he
couldn't cope with a large group
of students who blockaded the
door to his human biology class.
His leg was in a cast at the time so
he called the police and was
escorted into class.
"Under certain circumstances

you've just got to be an asshole,"
Forrie explained.
Personality Change
Since then, however, Forrie has
mellowed considerably. "I came
here with a lot of
misconceptions," he says, "many
of which were due to my
conservative, middle class
background. I think I've mellowed
somewhat even though I still take
strong stands.
"Stanford has been great for
me — you develop here as a
mature person. I've learned how
to live with people better and am
more tolerant in the way I view
the world."
Martin's peers at Stanford have
noticed the character change but
it's doubtful that any opposing
football players would call Forrie
"tolerant." Last week against
Michigan he was in on nine tackles
and against Penn State he stopped
11 enemy ballcarriers.
"He's getting better every
week," says Handley. "I think he
can eventually be as good as
Siemon but that's still a while off
since he didn't get a lot of playing
time last year."
"I spent most of my time either
in a hospital bed or training
quarters my first two years,"
Martin said. "This is my first
really healthy year at Stanford."
Medical Aspirations
Now, the football field and the
library have replaced the hospital
as Forrie's favorite hangouts. He is
a biochemistry major who plans
to go into medicine, even at the
expense of a possible professional
football career.
"Pro football is definitely one
option I'm leaving open," he says,
"but if football interfered with
my education as a doctor I'd have
to choose medicine."
But Forrie remains
overwhelmingly self-confident
despite his hesitancy to consider
pro football as a career. "I might
be a little small for a middle
linebacker [6-0, 225], but I still
think I could make it as a pro.
Plenty of guys my size have made
it before — I've got good speed
and I think I could do it."
With nine games remaining in
1973 and his entire senior season
ahead of him, Forrie's current
concerns involve helping Stanford
regain national football
prominence and improving his
already advanced linebacking
skills.
Even at this young stage in his
career he has often been
compared to Siemon and some
observers have noticed strong
likenesses to such famed middle
linebackers as Ray Nitchske and
Dick Butkus. Forrie, however,
dismisses all comparisons.
