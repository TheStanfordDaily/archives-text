# Hot Dogs, Malts 55 Cents
## Concession Prices Rise 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Stanford Stadium has a new
look this year, and it goes further
than new fences and tunnels.
Specifically, the price lists over
stadium concession stands have
changed quite a bit — in an
upward direction. All prices have
gone up at least a nickel over last
year so fans had better have
plenty of change on hand when
the concessionnaire comes around
this afternoon.
Hot dogs and malts are up five
cents to 55, soft drinks up a
nickel to 35, and orange juice bars
up 10 cents to 35.
"It's just like everything else,
prices are going up all over,"
explained Bob Young, associate
director of athletics. "We've raised
prices sometimes in the past, but
this is the first general, across the
board raise. I just got back from
Michigan, and the prices were the
same there. They even charge 35
cents for popcorn."
Hot Dogs Inflated
Young said wholesale hot dog
prices have inflated a great deal
over the last year, and stadium

concession stands may quit selling
them.
"I wouldn't allow the
concessionaire to go above 55
cents for a hot dog, and it still
could happen that we wouldn't
have hot dogs," Young pointed
out. "The concessionaire just
might not be able to afford to sell
them at that price.
"By the time he pays our rental
fee, and the seller's fee, and his
overhead, he just might not be
able to afford it. You know, if
you don't make any money on
these things, it's easier not to sell
them," he continued.
Young explained that soft
drink prices could be cut up to 10
cents if concessionaires could use
fountain-type mixers rather than
canned drinks.
No Facilities
"That's why we've kept the
prices down at Maples
[Pavilion]," he said. "You can
serve soft drinks a lot cheaper
with the water ice set-up, but you
have to have all the facilities like
we do in Maples.... We don't
have water and power available to
all the concession stands in the
stadium.
"Since we're allowed to use it
probably only eight times a year

[six football games and two track
meets] a good concessionaire is
not willing to put a lot of
improvements in something that
will be torn up by vandals most of
the year," Young added.
But he said the University is
currently negotiating with
concessionaires on the
improvements, and a compromise
is likely in time for next fall.
No Threat
Young said he doubted that
"pirate" concession stands outside
the stadium, selling soft drinks at
lower prices, would significantly
damage sales inside, even with the
price increase.
"The big sale is during the ball
game," he noted. "Actually,
tailgate parties cut into concession
sales more than those other
stands. And frankly, we encourage
tailgates. It brings people to the
game early and cuts down on
traffic problems, and it attracts
more people. But you know when
people bring big fancy lunches
and cocktails that it will hurt our
sales some."
But Young isn't too worried:
"Our income has improved
considerably in the past five years.
And we think it will keep going
up."
