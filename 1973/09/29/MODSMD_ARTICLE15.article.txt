# Red-Faced Pac-8 Seeks Wins Today
## 
### 
Members of the once-proud
Pacific Eight go into battle today
in a third effort to save the
reputation of the conference.
Pac-8 schools have
accumulated a munificent 3-11
record in non-conference play
thus far, and the league is in
serious danger of posting its first
intersectional record below .500
in 10 years.
Even the league's star
attraction, USC, which has won
both it's games, hasn't been able
to generate much offense. The
top-ranked Trojans must do better
to top Oklahoma, second in the
nation last year, tonight.
Explosive UCLA, which
crushed lowa last week, takes its
wishbone to Michigan State today.
The Bruins, who rarely put the
ball into the smog, seem to have
found the perfect quarterback in
sophomore John Sciarra — he's
gained more yards rushing than
passing.
The Pac-B's six schools located
north of Los Angeles all seek their
first wins today.
In a battle of contrasting
life-styles California journeys to
West Point to play Army.
The Golden Bears, whose
quarterback Vince Ferragamo
thus far hasn't lived up tor his
promise of last year, are hopeful
of escaping with their hair against
a supposedly weaker Eastern
school.
Oregon has produced the
league's newest star in junior
tailback Don Reynolds, who made
an incredible run on regional TV
last week against Air Force.
Reynolds, who leads the league in
rushing, broke four stiff hits for a
44-yard score. The Ducks host
Utah today.
While Stanford won't play
Brigham Young because of the
school's racial policies, Oregon
State apparently has no such
qualms. The Beavers take their
new passing attack to Provo
tonight. Thus far this year, OSU
has thrown 97 times, 35 more
than any other team in the league.
Unfortunately for the Beavers,
eight passes have been
intercepted.
Washington has already lost to

Hawaii in Seattle, and followers of
the Huskies are likely to start
throwing their umbrellas if the
team doesn't do better today
while hosting Syracuse.
Washington State hasn't won
any games thus far, but it has
impressed opponents with a
bruising defense. The Cougars
need only a more consistent
offense to post another winning
season, and the team is favored to
start things rolling against Idaho
at Pullman today.
