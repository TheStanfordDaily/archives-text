# San Jose State At A Glance
## 
### 
Coaching
San Jose State couldn't beat him, so they
hired him.
Darryl Rogers led Fresno State to a
46-37-1 mark as head coach from 1966-72,
including three straight wins over the Spartans
1970-72.
So San Jose State administrators made a
concerted effort to hire Rogers this past
winter and finally succeeded.
Rogers brought two top assistants with him
and the trio has tried to teach Rogers' system
to San Jose State's team.
Offensive Formation
Among Rogers' innovations at SJS is his
favorite offensive formation. One standard
set-up puts both tackles on the strong side of
the field, along with a guard and split end.
Only a guard and the right end are left to
block on the weak side. The backs are either
in a pro or I—formation, with a flanker on the
weak side.
Offensive Line
Reno Waite (220 pounts) has recovered
from a knee injury to take over the center
slot, with Ed Smith (250) at strong side guard
and sophomore Tom Cobey (210), a
converted defensive end, on the weak side.
Jim Ruiz (220) fills the inside tackle
position with converted end Ken Rigmaiden
(220) at outside tackle. The Spartans have not

used a tackle-eligible play this season, but
Rigmaiden could conceivably key this trick
play.
Running Game
Last year, San Jose had an anemic rushing
attack, gaining less than 100 yards on the
ground per game. But fullback Robert Evans
(193) has changed all that. Thus far, Evans has
gained 214 yards for a fine 5.4 average.
Evans' partner, tailback Larry Lloyd (215)
is new to his job, but already has become the
Spartans' bread-and-butter making short
plunges up the middle.
Passing Game
San Jose State thus far has run more than
they've thrown, but quarterback Craig
Kimball (185) makes most of his passes (61.4
percent) count.
Kimball, 13th leading passer in the nation
last year, particularly likes to throw to Ike
Mcßee, the split end. Mcßee was named
Northern California Offensive Player of the
Week this past week for his seven catches and
111 yards against Long Beach State.
Freshman Gary Maddocks has won the
starting flanker role. Star tight end Chris
Moyneur (190) has thus far been out of action
with bruised ribs, but may take over the
starting slot from Dan Prager (200) this week.
Defensive Line
San Jose State's defensive formation differs
from most (including Stanford's) in that a

player who usually would be on the weak side
instead plays head-to-head with the center.
Junior college transfer Doug Johnson usually
plays this middle guard position.
Elsewhere, the line features Larry Houston
(200) and Wilson Fauminia (255) at strong
side end and tackle respectively with Dave
Wasick (220) alone on the weak side. Wasick
leads the team with 27 tackles.
Linebackers
Carl Ekem (190) holds down the middle
linebacking slot, with Emanuel Armstrong
(225) on the strong side and Larry Zajonc
(200) on the weak side. The trio is quick and
experienced.
Defensive Secondary
This is one of San Jose State's strongest
points, and Stanford coach Jack Christiansen
has said "their two cornerbacks cover as well
as any we've seen." Dwayne Price (185) plays
left cornerback with AI Mason (170) on the
right.
Strong safety is Rick James (180), with
Clay Jackson as free safety.
Specialists
Kicker Ron Ploger, a junior college
transfer, is a soccer style booter whose kicks
get "immediate height." He's hit all eight
PAT's and both field goals he's tried for this
year. Punter Jeff Cunningham has an excellent
39.1 average.

year. Punter Jeff Cunningham has an excellent
39.1 average.
Coaching
San Jose State couldn't beat him, so they
hired him.
Darryl Rogers led Fresno State to a
46-37-1 mark as head coach from 1966-72,
including three straight wins over the Spartans
1970-72.
So San Jose State administrators made a
concerted effort to hire Rogers this past
winter and finally succeeded.
Rogers brought two top assistants with him
and the trio has tried to teach Rogers' system
to San Jose State's team.
Offensive Formation
Among Rogers' innovations at SJS is his
favorite offensive formation. One standard
set-up puts both tackles on the strong side of
the field, along with a guard and split end.
Only a guard and the right end are left to
block on the weak side. The backs are either
in a pro or I—formation, with a flanker on the
weak side.
Offensive Line
Reno Waite (220 pounts) has recovered
from a knee injury to take over the center
slot, with Ed Smith (250) at strong side guard
and sophomore Tom Cobey (210), a
converted defensive end, on the weak side.
Jim Ruiz (220) fills the inside tackle
position with converted end Ken Rigmaiden
(220) at outside tackle. The Spartans have not

used a tackle-eligible play this season, but
Rigmaiden could conceivably key this trick
play.
Running Game
Last year, San Jose had an anemic rushing
attack, gaining less than 100 yards on the
ground per game. But fullback Robert Evans
(193) has changed all that. Thus far, Evans has
gained 214 yards for a fine 5.4 average.
Evans' partner, tailback Larry Lloyd (215)
is new to his job, but already has become the
Spartans' bread-and-butter making short
plunges up the middle.
Passing Game
San Jose State thus far has run more than
they've thrown, but quarterback Craig
Kimball (185) makes most of his passes (61.4
percent) count.
Kimball, 13th leading passer in the nation
last year, particularly likes to throw to Ike
Mcßee, the split end. Mcßee was named
Northern California Offensive Player of the
Week this past week for his seven catches and
111 yards against Long Beach State.
Freshman Gary Maddocks has won the
starting flanker role. Star tight end Chris
Moyneur (190) has thus far been out of action
with bruised ribs, but may take over the
starting slot from Dan Prager (200) this week.
Defensive Line
San Jose State's defensive formation differs
from most (including Stanford's) in that a

player who usually would be on the weak side
instead plays head-to-head with the center.
Junior college transfer Doug Johnson usually
plays this middle guard position.
Elsewhere, the line features Larry Houston
(200) and Wilson Fauminia (255) at strong
side end and tackle respectively with Dave
Wasick (220) alone on the weak side. Wasick
leads the team with 27 tackles.
Linebackers
Carl Ekem (190) holds down the middle
linebacking slot, with Emanuel Armstrong
(225) on the strong side and Larry Zajonc
(200) on the weak side. The trio is quick and
experienced.
Defensive Secondary
This is one of San Jose State's strongest
points, and Stanford coach Jack Christiansen
has said "their two cornerbacks cover as well
as any we've seen." Dwayne Price (185) plays
left cornerback with AI Mason (170) on the
right.
Strong safety is Rick James (180), with
Clay Jackson as free safety.
Specialists
Kicker Ron Ploger, a junior college
transfer, is a soccer style booter whose kicks

PAT's and both field goals he's tried for this
year. Punter Jeff Cunningham has an excellent
