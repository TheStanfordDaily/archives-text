# Football's More Than Game When ABC Covers Spectacle
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
A dearth of exciting plays
hampered the Penn State-Stanford
game played here two weeks ago.
But not all viewers of ABC's
coast-to-coast telecast of the
football spectacle fell asleep in
their easy chairs.
Spectacle, not game. ABC
would quit before merely
televising a college football game.
Gridiron shots must share time
with endless shots of the Stanford
band, with accent on the dollies,
screaming crowds waving banners,
campus panorama from the
Goodyear blimp Columbia,
interesting sights (mostly co-eds)
in the stands ...
Chuck Howard, who produced
the telecast, puts it this way: "the
reason I like college football more
than pro football — aside from the
fact that I think it's a better game
on the field — is that there's so
much more happening off the
field."
ABC begins preparing for the
extravaganza on Tuesday and
Wednesday, when much of ABC's
legion arrives to set up equipment.
The top brass — announcers
and producers — doesn't land in
California until Thursday night
and Friday.
ABC's producers begin
co-ordinating the program Friday
morning, with meetings discussing
timing of the band shows and
player introductions.
Stanford Sports Information
Director Bob Murphy invites
Howard and associates onto the
field. Murphy's thought pays off
-- the next day's telecast includes
mention of Stanford Stadium's
well-kept bermuda grass.
Announcers Arrive
Friday afternoon the
announcers arrive to tape the
opening spots for the next day's
broadcast.
Arriving at the Stadium,
play-by-play announcer Chris
Schenkel moodily gazes at the
field, head in hand, watching
Stanford practice. Color
commentator Bud Wilkinson
whispers with Howard, the pair
marvelling at the strength of Rod
Garcia's foot. Former Michigan
State coach Duffy Daugherty,
added to the announcing team
this year because of his sense of
humor, lives up to his reputation.
"The reason my daughter went
to Stanford," Daugherty quips,
referring to Dree, a sophomore,
"is because her grades weren't
good enough for Michigan State."
After all the preparation, and
business dinner Friday night, the
show begins at 12:30 p.m. Just as
Terry Jastrow, associate producer,
arranged it the previous day, the
band launches into "Only the
Beginning."
The first scene the TV
audience sees is of the dollies
dancing.
Anthem Unseen
Following pregame analysis,
ABC cuts to a series of
commercials just as the band plays
the national anthem. Another
band trademark, the mildly
obscene "Yellow River"
formation done as players spurt
onto the field, also never makes it
onto the air.
The game begins on schedule.
ABC's first master touches are
isolated camera shots of Gordon
Riegel making a crunching tackle

and Reggie Ishman catching a
Mike Boryla pass just in bounds.
The network uses seven
cameras in all. Two, on the 25
yard lines just below the press
box, cover the play-by-play. Two
are mounted on pickup trucks at
ground level on both sides of the
field. One is in the north end
zone, one is in the blimp, and one
is used only for superimposing
statistics onto the screen.
Howard manipulates the
cameras from the control truck
deftly. "Just like the teams, we
have three or four game plans on
who to isolate depending on how
the game is going. I decide who to
isolate after seeing the teams and
reading the press books and
papers," he explains.
On each play, three cameras
focus on one player or scene.
Howard views the monitors of
each camera, decides which (if
any) isolated shot to use, and
relays his decision to the
announcers and director. On
televised sports programs, the
producer is boss.
The camera mounted on a
yellow truck on the Stanford side
of the field is used for crowd
shots only. "You can't shoot the
game from that side of the field
because everything's reversed, the
viewer would be disoriented,"

Howard explains.
During the second quarter, the
"backwards" camera eyes young
women in the stands. The subjects
of these portraits react with
waves, giggles, and even a dance.
Three banal banners greeting
ABC also get onto the air during
the second quarter. Among
banners TV viewers didn't get a
chance to see were two reading
"EMBO-ABC" and "Boycott
Gallo."
The final shot seen before
halftime is of bandsman Bob
Mann walking onto the field
sporting pink bunny ears.
Boyish Band
At halftime, ABC makes sure it
shows the Stanford band's entire
BV2 minute program. Jastrow
explains, "we feel the Stanford
band has a great free spirit, a
boyish quality," viewers want to
see.
During the show, Schenkel
reads — not always
comprehensibly — the script
handed him. He refers several
times to the "junior varsity"
band, evidently because someone
was confused over "Junior
University" in the LSJUMB's title.
While commentary leaves
something to be desired, ABC's
camera work concentrates on
visual interest — dollies,

drummers, tuba players, the drum
major, and one member wearing a
burnoose hood.
After Stanford's band finishes
its show, another band appears,
but the viewers never see a hint of
this more traditional
drum-and-bugle corps.
Instead, the audience sees a
one-minute blurb about Stanford
University, completely prepared
by Murphy's office, and
emphasizing Memorial Church and
Lake Lagunita. Following the
campus tour, UCLA coach Pepper
Rodgers analyzes the first half on
the "Coaches Corner" feature.
Lasses To Lions
Even ABC can't disguise the
fact that the third quarter is dull.
In the fourth quarter, Penn State
having clinched victory, the shots
between plays change from girls
to victorious Nittany Lions
relaxing on the sidelines.

Stanford finally scores late in
the contest, but this time, in
contrast with earlier exciting
plays, there is no shot of the
screaming crowd. It has
dissipated.
The game finally ends at 3:28
p.m. After a commercial, the
network superimposes credits
onto another sideways, spaced-out
view of the campus taken by the
blimp.
At 3:30, a postgame show,
produced elsewhere, begins.
After the game, the network's
announcers and producers, having
done their professional jobs,
quickly leave for New York and
Los Angeles, where the
USC-Arkansas game will soon
begin.
Only the technicians remain to
dismantle equipment and move it
to the site of the next ABC
extravaganza.


COLLEGE FOOTBALL SPECTACLE — Crowded stands, banners
waving in the wind, the Goodyear blimp — this is part of what college
football means to ABC.
