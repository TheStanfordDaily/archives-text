# Cuban Gains Impress Ogletree

### BILL ROSS 
Cuba's recent gains in social
equality more than compensate for its
economic setbacks, according to
Charles Ogletree, ASSU vice president,
after a summer visit to Cuba.
Ogletree spent three weeks in Cuba
as a guest of the Cuban Institute for
Friendship of the Peoples, an
organization sponsored by the Cuban
government. He and five other
American students were selected for
the Cuban tour by the Federation of
United Students of Cuba.
Ogletree's invitation came after a
group of members of the African
Liberation Society — an organization
which provides financial aid for black
self-determination movements in
Africa — told the student organization
of his interest in Cuban society.
Ogletree said what impressed him
most about Cuba was the apparent
lack of racism, sexism and class

conflict.
"Great strides have been made in
the incorporation of blacks and
women into the social structure of
Cuba," Ogletree said. "This is an
example of the socialist revolution's
successful attempt to eliminate the
idea of minorities and allow everyone
to participate as equals in Cuban life."
No Distinctions
There are no class distinctions in
Cuba, Ogletree claimed. While a few
older citizens still hold prejudices, the
youth has rejected the idea of social
class, he said.
Ogletree said he was treated with
extreme cordiality in all his official
contacts with Cubans. He frequently
ventured alone into the streets to talk
informally with other people, and
found them equally amicable.
"I had an elementary knowledge of
Spanish so I had no trouble
communicating with the people,"

Ogletree said. "I learned that they
have a favorable impression" of
individual Americans and do not hold
the individuals responsible for the
actions of the U.S. government.
Ogletree was especially interested in
the Cuban university system. Students
there spend four hours each day
studying and four hours applying their
knowledge in fields, factories and
laboratories, he explained. He said
American students would benefit from
a similar program.
Elections Superfluous
The Cuban government has
suspended the electoral process,
Ogletree said, because elections would
be superfluous.
"Castro has the support of the
people and in reality the people lead
Cuba," he asserted. "When the
government goes against the wishes of
the people, the masses make their
objections known by refusing to

cooperate with the government.
"For example, drinking and
smoking were once prohibited, but the
people insisted upon their right to use
alcohol and cigarettes and the
government repealed its prohibitions."
"However, it's rare for the Cuban
people not to follow the general plans
of the Castro regime," Ogletree noted.
Enthusiasm
"The enthusiasm of the citizens is
tremendous. There is a strong
inclination among the people to want
to labor hard to build a socialist
society. Cubans work voluntarily for
long hours building schools and
hospitals," he noted.
Ogletree said he is convinced that
such enthusiasm is genuine since there
aren't any personal benefits derived
from such zeal in a society of equals.
Dissent is tolerated in Cuba,
according to Ogletree. If people speak
