# Cuban Gains Impress Ogletree
## 
### BILL ROSS 
Cuba's recent gains in social
equality more than compensate for its
economic setbacks, according to
Charles Ogletree, ASSU vice president,
after a summer visit to Cuba.
Ogletree spent three weeks in Cuba
as a guest of the Cuban Institute for
Friendship of the Peoples, an
organization sponsored by the Cuban
government. He and five other
American students were selected for
the Cuban tour by the Federation of
United Students of Cuba.
Ogletree's invitation came after a
group of members of the African
Liberation Society — an organization
which provides financial aid for black
self-determination movements in
Africa — told the student organization
of his interest in Cuban society.
Ogletree said what impressed him
most about Cuba was the apparent
lack of racism, sexism and class

conflict.
"Great strides have been made in
the incorporation of blacks and
women into the social structure of
Cuba," Ogletree said. "This is an
example of the socialist revolution's
successful attempt to eliminate the
idea of minorities and allow everyone
to participate as equals in Cuban life."
No Distinctions
There are no class distinctions in
Cuba, Ogletree claimed. While a few
older citizens still hold prejudices, the
youth has rejected the idea of social
class, he said.
Ogletree said he was treated with
extreme cordiality in all his official
contacts with Cubans. He frequently
ventured alone into the streets to talk
informally with other people, and
found them equally amicable.
"I had an elementary knowledge of
Spanish so I had no trouble
communicating with the people,"

Ogletree said. "I learned that they
have a favorable impression" of
individual Americans and do not hold
the individuals responsible for the
actions of the U.S. government.
Ogletree was especially interested in
the Cuban university system. Students
there spend four hours each day
studying and four hours applying their
knowledge in fields, factories and
laboratories, he explained. He said
American students would benefit from
a similar program.
Elections Superfluous
The Cuban government has
suspended the electoral process,
Ogletree said, because elections would
be superfluous.
"Castro has the support of the
people and in reality the people lead
Cuba," he asserted. "When the
government goes against the wishes of
the people, the masses make their
objections known by refusing to

cooperate with the government.
"For example, drinking and
smoking were once prohibited, but the
people insisted upon their right to use
alcohol and cigarettes and the
government repealed its prohibitions."
"However, it's rare for the Cuban
people not to follow the general plans
of the Castro regime," Ogletree noted.
Enthusiasm
"The enthusiasm of the citizens is
tremendous. There is a strong
inclination among the people to want
to labor hard to build a socialist
society. Cubans work voluntarily for
long hours building schools and
hospitals," he noted.
Ogletree said he is convinced that
such enthusiasm is genuine since there
aren't any personal benefits derived
from such zeal in a society of equals.
Dissent is tolerated in Cuba,
according to Ogletree. If people speak

out against the government, they are
permitted to hold their views, he
insisted. At first their fellow citizens
try to debate with them, and if they
don't change, they are eventually
ignored.
Ogletree denied the reported
existence of political prisoners in Cuba
and said that Cubans are always
allowed due process. Justice in Cuba is
swifter than in the United States, he
said. A Cuban who commits a crime
usually is not detained prior to his
trial, and at his hearing is judged by a
tribunal of his peers, he said.
Freedom of religion also is
permitted, said Ogletree, who
admitted that the same isn't true of all
communist nations. While most young
people find religion irrelevant, no one
who follows a faith receives
discriminatory treatment, he
contended.
Ogletree also claimed that
educational opportunities in the
nation have vastly increased since the
revolution began.
"In 1958, the last year of the

Bastista regime, the Cuban government
spent $70 million on education,"
Ogletree said. "In 1973 it has allocated
$700 million for education."
Cuban authorities have tried to
eliminate illiteracy, and have
succeeded in giving Cuba the highest
literacy rate in Latin America,
Ogletree claimed.
Hie government has also increased
the number of universities from one to
five and has quadrupled the
enrollment of students in higher
education from 11,000 to 44,000, he
added. This does not include a large
number of part time students who
study at the expense of the
government.
Impressed
Ogletree said that while he was
impressed with Cuba, it is difficult to
apply what he learned to the political
situation in the United States.
The differences in size, industrial
development and culture make it
difficult to see Cuba in an American
perspective, he said.
"The social situation in Cuba has
improved so greatly during the years
of the revolution that it is difficult to
explain it to anyone who has not
personally visited Cuba," Ogletree
said. "I realize that what I say may
sound too good to be true."
Economic Problems
Ogletree acknowledged the
existence of severe economic problems
in Cuba.
"The economic blockade of Cuba
by the United States has caused the
Cuban nation, short in natural
resources, to be deprived of many
consumer goods," Ogletree said.
"The gross national product of
Cuba has not advanced significantly
during the years of the Castro regime,
and there is a badly unbalanced ratio

between labor and production."
However, Ogletree predicted that
the enthusiasm of the Cuban people
for the development of their country
will ultimately result in prosperity.
"Meanwhile, the spirit of equality
generated by the socialist revolution
makes the economic sacrifices
worthwhile," he said. "There is a lot in
Cuba at which we may look
positively."

There are no class distinctions in
Cuba, Ogletree claimed. While a few
older citizens still hold prejudices, the
youth has rejected the idea of social
class, he said.
Ogletree said he was treated with
extreme cordiality in all his official
contacts with Cubans. He frequently
ventured alone into the streets to talk
informally with other people, and
found them equally amicable.
"I had an elementary knowledge of
Spanish so I had no trouble
communicating with the people,"

Ogletree said. "I learned that they
have a favorable impression" of
individual Americans and do not hold
the individuals responsible for the
actions of the U.S. government.
Ogletree was especially interested in
the Cuban university system. Students
there spend four hours each day
studying and four hours applying their
knowledge in fields, factories and
laboratories, he explained. He said
American students would benefit from
a similar program.
Elections Superfluous
The Cuban government has
suspended the electoral process,
Ogletree said, because elections would
be superfluous.
"Castro has the support of the
people and in reality the people lead
Cuba," he asserted. "When the
government goes against the wishes of
the people, the masses make their
objections known by refusing to

cooperate with the government.
"For example, drinking and
smoking were once prohibited, but the
people insisted upon their right to use
alcohol and cigarettes and the
government repealed its prohibitions."
"However, it's rare for the Cuban
people not to follow the general plans
of the Castro regime," Ogletree noted.
Enthusiasm
"The enthusiasm of the citizens is
tremendous. There is a strong
inclination among the people to want
to labor hard to build a socialist
society. Cubans work voluntarily for
long hours building schools and
hospitals," he noted.
Ogletree said he is convinced that
such enthusiasm is genuine since there
aren't any personal benefits derived
from such zeal in a society of equals.
Dissent is tolerated in Cuba,
according to Ogletree. If people speak

out against the government, they are
permitted to hold their views, he
insisted. At first their fellow citizens
try to debate with them, and if they
don't change, they are eventually
ignored.
Ogletree denied the reported
existence of political prisoners in Cuba
and said that Cubans are always
allowed due process. Justice in Cuba is
swifter than in the United States, he
said. A Cuban who commits a crime
usually is not detained prior to his
trial, and at his hearing is judged by a
tribunal of his peers, he said.
Freedom of religion also is
permitted, said Ogletree, who
admitted that the same isn't true of all
communist nations. While most young
people find religion irrelevant, no one
who follows a faith receives
discriminatory treatment, he
contended.
Ogletree also claimed that
educational opportunities in the
nation have vastly increased since the
revolution began.
"In 1958, the last year of the

Bastista regime, the Cuban government
spent $70 million on education,"
Ogletree said. "In 1973 it has allocated
$700 million for education."
Cuban authorities have tried to
eliminate illiteracy, and have
succeeded in giving Cuba the highest
literacy rate in Latin America,
Ogletree claimed.
Hie government has also increased
the number of universities from one to
five and has quadrupled the
enrollment of students in higher
education from 11,000 to 44,000, he
added. This does not include a large
number of part time students who
study at the expense of the
government.
Impressed
Ogletree said that while he was
impressed with Cuba, it is difficult to
apply what he learned to the political
situation in the United States.
The differences in size, industrial
development and culture make it
difficult to see Cuba in an American
perspective, he said.
"The social situation in Cuba has
improved so greatly during the years
of the revolution that it is difficult to
explain it to anyone who has not
personally visited Cuba," Ogletree
said. "I realize that what I say may
sound too good to be true."
Economic Problems
Ogletree acknowledged the
existence of severe economic problems
in Cuba.
"The economic blockade of Cuba
by the United States has caused the
Cuban nation, short in natural
resources, to be deprived of many
consumer goods," Ogletree said.
"The gross national product of
Cuba has not advanced significantly
during the years of the Castro regime,
and there is a badly unbalanced ratio

between labor and production."
However, Ogletree predicted that
the enthusiasm of the Cuban people
for the development of their country
will ultimately result in prosperity.
"Meanwhile, the spirit of equality
generated by the socialist revolution
makes the economic sacrifices
worthwhile," he said. "There is a lot in
Cuba at which we may look
positively."
Cuba's recent gains in social
equality more than compensate for its
economic setbacks, according to
Charles Ogletree, ASSU vice president,
after a summer visit to Cuba.
Ogletree spent three weeks in Cuba
as a guest of the Cuban Institute for
Friendship of the Peoples, an
organization sponsored by the Cuban
government. He and five other
American students were selected for
the Cuban tour by the Federation of
United Students of Cuba.
Ogletree's invitation came after a
group of members of the African
Liberation Society — an organization
which provides financial aid for black
self-determination movements in
Africa — told the student organization
of his interest in Cuban society.
Ogletree said what impressed him
most about Cuba was the apparent
lack of racism, sexism and class

conflict.
"Great strides have been made in
the incorporation of blacks and
women into the social structure of
Cuba," Ogletree said. "This is an
example of the socialist revolution's
successful attempt to eliminate the
idea of minorities and allow everyone
to participate as equals in Cuban life."

Cuba," he asserted. "When the
government goes against the wishes of
the people, the masses make their
objections known by refusing to

cooperate with the government.
"For example, drinking and
smoking were once prohibited, but the
people insisted upon their right to use
alcohol and cigarettes and the
government repealed its prohibitions."
"However, it's rare for the Cuban
people not to follow the general plans
of the Castro regime," Ogletree noted.
Enthusiasm
"The enthusiasm of the citizens is
tremendous. There is a strong
inclination among the people to want
to labor hard to build a socialist
society. Cubans work voluntarily for
long hours building schools and
hospitals," he noted.
Ogletree said he is convinced that
such enthusiasm is genuine since there
aren't any personal benefits derived
from such zeal in a society of equals.
Dissent is tolerated in Cuba,
according to Ogletree. If people speak

out against the government, they are
permitted to hold their views, he
insisted. At first their fellow citizens
try to debate with them, and if they
don't change, they are eventually
ignored.
Ogletree denied the reported
existence of political prisoners in Cuba
and said that Cubans are always
allowed due process. Justice in Cuba is
swifter than in the United States, he
said. A Cuban who commits a crime
usually is not detained prior to his
trial, and at his hearing is judged by a
tribunal of his peers, he said.
Freedom of religion also is
permitted, said Ogletree, who
admitted that the same isn't true of all
communist nations. While most young
people find religion irrelevant, no one
who follows a faith receives
discriminatory treatment, he
contended.
Ogletree also claimed that
educational opportunities in the
nation have vastly increased since the
revolution began.
"In 1958, the last year of the

Bastista regime, the Cuban government
spent $70 million on education,"
Ogletree said. "In 1973 it has allocated
$700 million for education."
Cuban authorities have tried to
eliminate illiteracy, and have
succeeded in giving Cuba the highest
literacy rate in Latin America,
Ogletree claimed.
Hie government has also increased
the number of universities from one to
five and has quadrupled the
enrollment of students in higher
education from 11,000 to 44,000, he
added. This does not include a large
number of part time students who
study at the expense of the
government.
Impressed
Ogletree said that while he was
impressed with Cuba, it is difficult to
apply what he learned to the political
situation in the United States.
The differences in size, industrial
development and culture make it
difficult to see Cuba in an American
perspective, he said.
"The social situation in Cuba has
improved so greatly during the years
of the revolution that it is difficult to
explain it to anyone who has not
personally visited Cuba," Ogletree
said. "I realize that what I say may
sound too good to be true."
Economic Problems
Ogletree acknowledged the
existence of severe economic problems
in Cuba.
"The economic blockade of Cuba
by the United States has caused the
Cuban nation, short in natural
resources, to be deprived of many
consumer goods," Ogletree said.
"The gross national product of
Cuba has not advanced significantly
during the years of the Castro regime,
and there is a badly unbalanced ratio

between labor and production."
However, Ogletree predicted that
the enthusiasm of the Cuban people
for the development of their country
will ultimately result in prosperity.
"Meanwhile, the spirit of equality
generated by the socialist revolution
makes the economic sacrifices
worthwhile," he said. "There is a lot in
Cuba at which we may look
positively."
Cuba's recent gains in social
equality more than compensate for its
economic setbacks, according to
Charles Ogletree, ASSU vice president,
after a summer visit to Cuba.
Ogletree spent three weeks in Cuba
as a guest of the Cuban Institute for
Friendship of the Peoples, an
organization sponsored by the Cuban
government. He and five other
American students were selected for
the Cuban tour by the Federation of
United Students of Cuba.
Ogletree's invitation came after a
group of members of the African
Liberation Society — an organization
which provides financial aid for black
self-determination movements in
Africa — told the student organization
of his interest in Cuban society.
Ogletree said what impressed him
most about Cuba was the apparent
lack of racism, sexism and class

conflict.
"Great strides have been made in
the incorporation of blacks and
women into the social structure of
Cuba," Ogletree said. "This is an
example of the socialist revolution's
successful attempt to eliminate the
idea of minorities and allow everyone
to participate as equals in Cuban life."
No Distinctions
There are no class distinctions in
Cuba, Ogletree claimed. While a few
older citizens still hold prejudices, the
youth has rejected the idea of social
class, he said.
Ogletree said he was treated with
extreme cordiality in all his official
contacts with Cubans. He frequently
ventured alone into the streets to talk
informally with other people, and
found them equally amicable.
"I had an elementary knowledge of
Spanish so I had no trouble
communicating with the people,"

Ogletree said. "I learned that they
have a favorable impression" of
individual Americans and do not hold
the individuals responsible for the
actions of the U.S. government.
Ogletree was especially interested in
the Cuban university system. Students
there spend four hours each day
studying and four hours applying their
knowledge in fields, factories and
laboratories, he explained. He said
American students would benefit from
a similar program.
Elections Superfluous
The Cuban government has
suspended the electoral process,
Ogletree said, because elections would
be superfluous.
"Castro has the support of the
people and in reality the people lead
Cuba," he asserted. "When the
government goes against the wishes of
the people, the masses make their
objections known by refusing to

cooperate with the government.
