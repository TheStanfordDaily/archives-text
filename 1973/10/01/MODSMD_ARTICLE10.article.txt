Your future, your education, and the future of
California depend upon a crucial special election on
November 6.
Ronald Reagan's tax initiative — Proposition 1 —
would place arbitrary limits on state spending over
the next 10 years. It radically limits the power of
the Legislature to govern. The long-range effect is to
remove all flexibility from government, a
frightening move in this time of rapid change.
The immediate effect (according to Alan Post,
the Legislative Analyst and California's foremost
nonpartisan money expert) will be a cut next year
of $620 million in current state programs. This
could well mean charging tuition at the state
universities and community colleges, increasing
tuition at the University of California, and
curtailing student aid programs at private colleges
and universities. It would almost certainly mean
cuts in health and services for the poor.

Knowing state government, you can bet rich
people won't get hurt. In fact, the initiative freezes
in current tax loopholes which allow oil companies
and corporations to escape their fair share of taxes.
This means that ultimately other forms of taxation
(like sales and property taxes) will have to be raised.
Ronald Reagan and his friends - with their big
money — will be trying to buy your vote, through
the media, and ignorance. You owe it to yourself
and to your friends to vote wisely. More
information is available from your student body
office. Inform yourself, involve yourself.
Remember, you must register by October 7 — in
order to vote on November 6.
