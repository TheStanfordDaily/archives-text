# Objection To Discrimination
## Admissions Policy Favors Engineers 
### 
James Lobsenz, Eric Hemel

Last spring a student member of the
Committee on Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid (CUAFA) informed us that the
Stanford University Admissions Office
pursues a policy of favoring applicants for the
freshman class who express an interest in
engineering by deliberately accepting a
disproportionately high number of
pre-engineering students.
Though we were reluctant to believe him at
first, he dispelled our doubts by showing us a
passage from the April 1973 Report on
Undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aid.
The report relied on a compilation of
Probable Major Statistics prepared by the
Academic Planning Office. The passage which
stunned us stated that Stanford pursues an
admissions policy of "supporting the
undergraduate engineering programs by giving
preference (other things being equal) to
candiates who evidence a strong interest in
engineering."
The report went on to say that "about 47
percent of these applicants [pre-engineering
students] are offered admission, compared
with 32 percent for the (qualified) applicant
pool as a whole." Later, in an informal
interview, Associate Dean of Admissions John
Muyskens, Jr. confirmed our information.
We object to the above policy for two

reasons.
First, we believe that such a policy
interferes with the market of free ideas at
Stanford. An artificially inflated number of
engineering students creates an unduly large
demand for engineering facilities. Thus such a
policy distorts the allocation of educational
resources at Stanford.
But of greater importance is the fact that
the above policy results in de facto
discrimination against women and minority
group applicants to Stanford. Since women
and minority group members choose
engineering majors less frequently than do
white males, this policy artifically boosts the
number of white males in the freshman class
at the expense of minority and female
freshman applicants. Policies allowing for the
acceptance of a disproportionate number of
pre-engineers are in effect then, just as
destructive as the sexist and racist admission
barriers of the not-too-distant past.
Despite this policy's effects, we hope the
public reaction to them does not create a
backlash. While pre-engineering applicants do
not deserve the special status they now enjoy,
neither should they be disadvantaged.
Applicants with exceptional engineering talent
deserve special admissions consideration. What
is unjustified is that equally talented

applicants in other fields (e.g. history or
biology) do not receive the same admissions
break.
Because of the harm this policy may cause
we believe that it and similar policies should
not be kept secret. The entire Stanford
community has a right to know what these
policies are, and to know the reasons behind
them.
To facilitate the dispersal of such
knowledge we make three requests. First, we
request that Prof. Paul Green, this year's
CUAFA chairman, examine CUAFA records
and inform the public through the Daily as to
the history and original rationale of this
policy and any others like it that may exist.
Second, we request that previous members
of CUAFA use the Daily to explain why they
agreed to maintain this or similar policies.
Finally, we urge the members of CUAFA
to meet as soon as possible to discuss this
policy, so that it can be eliminated before the
selection process begins anew. Hopefully, this
meeting can be open to the public, so that its
results can be known and judged by the entire
Stanford community.

admissions policy of "supporting the
undergraduate engineering programs by giving
preference (other things being equal) to
candiates who evidence a strong interest in
engineering."
The report went on to say that "about 47
percent of these applicants [pre-engineering
students] are offered admission, compared
with 32 percent for the (qualified) applicant
pool as a whole." Later, in an informal
interview, Associate Dean of Admissions John
Muyskens, Jr. confirmed our information.
We object to the above policy for two

reasons.
First, we believe that such a policy
interferes with the market of free ideas at
Stanford. An artificially inflated number of
engineering students creates an unduly large
demand for engineering facilities. Thus such a
policy distorts the allocation of educational
resources at Stanford.
But of greater importance is the fact that
the above policy results in de facto
discrimination against women and minority
group applicants to Stanford. Since women
and minority group members choose
engineering majors less frequently than do
white males, this policy artifically boosts the
number of white males in the freshman class
at the expense of minority and female
freshman applicants. Policies allowing for the
acceptance of a disproportionate number of
pre-engineers are in effect then, just as
destructive as the sexist and racist admission
barriers of the not-too-distant past.
Despite this policy's effects, we hope the
public reaction to them does not create a
backlash. While pre-engineering applicants do
not deserve the special status they now enjoy,
neither should they be disadvantaged.
Applicants with exceptional engineering talent
deserve special admissions consideration. What
is unjustified is that equally talented

applicants in other fields (e.g. history or
biology) do not receive the same admissions
break.
Because of the harm this policy may cause
we believe that it and similar policies should
not be kept secret. The entire Stanford
community has a right to know what these
policies are, and to know the reasons behind
them.
To facilitate the dispersal of such
knowledge we make three requests. First, we
request that Prof. Paul Green, this year's
CUAFA chairman, examine CUAFA records
and inform the public through the Daily as to
the history and original rationale of this
policy and any others like it that may exist.
Second, we request that previous members
of CUAFA use the Daily to explain why they
agreed to maintain this or similar policies.
Finally, we urge the members of CUAFA
to meet as soon as possible to discuss this
policy, so that it can be eliminated before the
selection process begins anew. Hopefully, this
meeting can be open to the public, so that its
results can be known and judged by the entire
Stanford community.

Last spring a student member of the
Committee on Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid (CUAFA) informed us that the
Stanford University Admissions Office
pursues a policy of favoring applicants for the
freshman class who express an interest in
engineering by deliberately accepting a
disproportionately high number of
pre-engineering students.
Though we were reluctant to believe him at
first, he dispelled our doubts by showing us a
passage from the April 1973 Report on
Undergraduate Admissions and Financial Aid.
The report relied on a compilation of
Probable Major Statistics prepared by the
Academic Planning Office. The passage which
stunned us stated that Stanford pursues an
admissions policy of "supporting the
undergraduate engineering programs by giving
preference (other things being equal) to
candiates who evidence a strong interest in
engineering."
