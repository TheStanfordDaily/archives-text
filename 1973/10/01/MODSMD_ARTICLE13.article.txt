# Auditors Discover Aid 'Irregularities'

LOS ANGELES (AP) - The
internal audits staff of the board
of trustees of the California State
University and Colleges said
Tuesday it had found "serious
administrative deficiencies" at
two colleges in the administration
of financial aid for students.
The two colleges are San
Francisco and Sonoma, Fred
Dalton, chief of the audit staff,
said in a report to trustees.
The staff found that the
financial aids for students were
soundly administered at four
other campuses: Dominguez Hills,
Fresno, Humboldt and
Northridge.
Dalton said this series of audit
review of financial aid programs
resulted from a September 1972
request for an audit of the
Sonoma program by President
Thomas McGrath. He said
McGrath became aware of
irregularities in the financial aid
program on his campus.

Dal ton said reviews of 11 other
campuses will be made as soon as
possible.
Dalton said McGrath has been
asked to examine each of the
individual aid files for the school
years since 1970-71 to determine
whether the students were eligible
to receive federal aid.
The chief auditor said he also
outlined procedures to insure
orderly administration of the
programs in the future.
The recommendations were: to
appoint a capable and fully
qualified permanent financial aids
officer immediately; to develop
and put into effect operational
procedures to regularize the
financial aid program beginning
with summer 1973; to make a
complete review of each financial
aid file beginning with the
1970-71 to correct or complete
the files, and to take steps where
appropriate to recover awards
lacking justification.
