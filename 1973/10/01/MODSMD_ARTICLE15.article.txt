# Fired-Up Cards Stomp San Jose State
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Not everyone agrees on just
what the spark was, but
something finally lit a fire under
Stanford in the second half of
Saturday's football game against
scrappy San Jose State.
And, for the first time this
year, the Cardinals made the big
plays necessary to win, as
Stanford rallied from a 12-6
deficit to beat the Spartans 23-12
before 47,500 sunburned fans at
Stanford Stadium.
Maybe Stanford's
transformation from a talented
loser to a real football team took
place in the third quarter when
running back John Winesberry
was injured on what some called a
late hit or "cheap shot."
Winesberry underwent knee
surgery yesterday, and is out for
the season.
After the play, defensive end
Roger Stillwell, who played his
usual great game, yelled, "Let's
win this one for John."
'Had To Win'
Quarterback Mike Boryla
agreed that was a turning point:
"When I saw him go out on a
stretcher, I felt we just had to
win."

After the injury, Boryla hit
tight end Glen Stone on a 38-yard
pass play, but matters ended there
when Boryla's next throw was
picked off.
But two plays later, Jim Kaffen
returned the insult, intercepting
Craig Kimball's pass and giving the
ball to the Cardinals on the SJS
40.
Two plays later, Boryla hit
Brad Williams 'at the five. But
three plays advanced the ball only
one yard.
Fourth and four. As it became
evident Stanford would go for
broke, many in the student rooter
section stood up and applauded.
Boryla rolled right and found a
leaping Eric Test just across the
goal line.
"It was just a curl pattern,"
Test said. "I caught it in the air
and was knocked back by two
guys. I looked at the ref and for
just a second I thought 'oh, no,
he's not going to give it to me.' "

Stanford's fired-up defense
stopped SJS cold on the next
series. Craig Zaltosky retreated to
his own 32 for the ensuing punt
and zig-zagged across the field for
the final Stanford touchdown.
Gordie Riegel sprung Zaltosky
with a crunching block, and
Zaltosky depreciated his own
effort, saying "anyone can run
'em back with blocks like that."
Nobody believed that statement.

Nothing much happened after
that touchdown, except that
Zaltosky, Kaffen and Butch
Blanchard all intercepted passes to
snuff out closing SJS drives.
Stanford might have been able
to score another touchdown after
Kaffen returned the ball to the
SJS seven, but kept the ball on
the ground to set up a 26-yard
Garcia field goal which rounded
out the scoring.
Sluggish Start
While the Cards played great
second-half football, their first
half, for the third straight game,
showed little offensive punch.
SJS took an early 6-0 lead after
a Tom Lynn punt slithered only
16 yards to the Cardinals' 28.
From there, Kimball threw to Ike
Mcßee to set up the touchdown, a
one-yard plunge by Kimball.
Mcßee, a quick, exciting junior
end, was voted offensive player of
the game, Zaltosky winning
defensive honors.
Stanford came back to score
on a wobbly 17-yard touchdown
pass from Boryla to Bill Singler,
the wide receiver coming back to
make a leaping catch. Garcia's
extra point attempt failed, leaving
SJS in command, 7-6.
Quipped Christiansen: "Garcia
looked like Gaylord Perry out
there, he was kicking a spitter or
something."

In the second quarter, SJS
marched to a first-and-goal
situation on the Stanford one, but
four straight runs failed to bang
the ball over. Said Stillwell of the
stand, "We weren't sure we were a
good defensive team — I'm sure
we are now."
On the next play however,
Scott Laidlaw was nailed behind
the line for a safety.

Cardinal Notes: Dave Ottmar
received an ovation when he
booted his first punt of the year
51 yards in the fourth quarter.
Ottmar, Boryla's backup
quarterback last year, injured his
knee in the spring.
"I had wanted to redshirt,"
and thus possibly start at
quarterback next year, "but he
[Christiansen] told me to go in
and punt. So I went in and kicked
it."
"Our punting has really hurt us
in the first three games,"
Christiansen said. "Dave's going to
be our punter the rest of the
season .. . who knows, he may
still get to play quarterback."
Apparently Stanford is already
looking ahead to the "Big Game"
Nov. 24 against traditional rival
California. According to
linebacker Gordie Riegel, "Illinois
knocked the hell out of Cal so we
want to knock the hell out of
Illinois next week."

WINESBERRY'S LAST RUN — John Winesberry gained two yards on
this run Saturday against San Jose State but those two yards were his
last as a Stanford player. Winesberry suffered torn ligaments in his left
knee when tackled and underwent knee surgery yesterday at Stanford
Hospital.
