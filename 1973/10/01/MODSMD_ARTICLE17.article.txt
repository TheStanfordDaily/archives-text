# Surgery Successful But Wines' Career Over
## 
### 
John Winesberry should
recover normally from knee
surgery performed yesterday but
his collegiate football career is
definitely over, according to
Stanford team surgeon Dr. Fred
Behling.
"The operation went well,"
said Behling, who repaired two
torn ligaments in Winesberry's left
knee yesterday afternoon at
Stanford Hospital.
Behling said that Winesberry
won't be able to run for at least
two months. The knee should heal
properly, however, and won't
hamper a possible professional
career.
Winesberry was hit by San Jose
State tackles Dave Jurnett and

Dave Wasick after a two-yard gain
midway in the third quarter.
Stanford coach Jack Christiansen
and several Cardinal players
hinted that it was a late hit â€” a
"cheap shot" at Winesberry.
Wines watched the rest of the
game on the sidelines, sitting in a
golf cart with an ice bag on his
left knee. After the game he was
sullen, talking quietly with some
teammates but advising reporters
that "I'm in a terrible mood. Why
don't you talk to the doctor."
The injury culminated a
frustrating career for Winesberry.
Certainly one of the most talented
athletes ever to wear a Cardinal
uniform, Wines was forced to
struggle through most of his three
seasons with a series of injuries.
He performed brilliantly as a
sophomore flanker in 1971
despite a troublesome knee that
limited his movement in some
games. He was switched to
running back last year and
finished sixth in the Pac-8 rushing
statistics even though he was
nursing a severely sprained ankle
for much of the season.
Earlier this year he was
bothered by a broken hand and a
hip-pointer.
