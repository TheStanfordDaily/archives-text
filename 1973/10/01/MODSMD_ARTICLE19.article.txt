# Shuffling The Cards
## More Victories To Come 
### Dave Robinson 
Stanford's football players, hesitant to offer any
self-judgment while suffering the effects and
after-effects of Penn State and Michigan, overflowed
with confidence in the locker room Saturday
following their first football victory of 1973.
"I know we have the potential," said quarterback
Mike Boryla. "We just haven't unleashed it yet."
"Before today we [the defense] were guessing
"Are we that good or are we that bad,' " said
linebacker Gordie Riegel. "But now I don't have
any doubts. That goal line stand proved a lot to our
defense and a lot to me personally."
"We finally decided to start hitting people," said
defensive end Roger Stillwell. "We're getting mean
— we're not waiting for the other team to give us a
game anymore. We're ready to go out and win on
our own."
Realistically, a 23-12 victory over San Jose State
shouldn't be a cause for celebration or excessive
confidence. "This team just looked awful those first
two games," I kept reminding myself while listening
to the players predict great things for the Cards in
the coming weeks.
Misplaced Magic
But after watching two outmanned Stanford
teams win Rose Bowl games, after witnessing scores
of lesser Stanford miracles on the football field,
after seeing the unbelievable effects of the changing
Cardinal "mood," I found myself believing every
word th ?y said.
Mayle, just maybe, the Cards will find some of
the misplaced magic of the John Ralston years.
This won't be another Rose Bowl year for
Stanford. The C rds won't even finish second in the
Pac-8 and in all probability will never scare even the
bottom rungs of ;he AP and UPI football polls.
But when viewed in the proper perspective, 1973

should be a successful year for Stanford football.
The Card defense is unquestionably solid in all
departments. Stillwell may be the best defensive end
on the West Coast, and Pete Hanson, Joe Martin and
Pat Donovan join him to form a strong front four.
The linebacking corps (Forrie Martin, Riegel, Geb
Church and John Snider) is impressive and the
secondary (Randy Poltl, James Ferguson, Doc
Blanchard, Jim Kaffen and Craig Zaltosky) may be
one of Stanford's best ever.
Victim Of Circumstance
The defense was more of a victim of
circumstance against Penn State and Michigan than
a victim of the Nittany Lions or Wolverines.
The offense, of course, remains a serious
question mark, especially an offensive line which
looked like a sieve against Penn State and Michigan.
But things improved Saturday, and the Cardinal
running backs were appreciative.
"The line did a good job," said fullback Scott
Laidlaw, who took advantage of the line's
improvement with 57 yards in 13 carries. "They
finally settled down — they didn't get confused or
upset. Today was a confidence-builder for our
whole offense."
But more importantly, the Cards played
Saturday with a sort of spontaneity that
characterized the Rose Bowl teams of 1970 and 71
— Stanford didn't wear down San Jose State, but
Craig Zaltosky's punt return and Mike Boryla's
fourth down touchdown pass to Eric Test destroyed
the Spartans' momentum. Plays like that bring
upsets and Stanford fans should expect some upsets
during the remainder of the season.
"I really think USC is beatable," Laidlaw said.
Well, let's not get carried away.

Cardinal "mood," I found myself believing every
word th ?y said.
Mayle, just maybe, the Cards will find some of
the misplaced magic of the John Ralston years.
This won't be another Rose Bowl year for
Stanford. The C rds won't even finish second in the
Pac-8 and in all probability will never scare even the
bottom rungs of ;he AP and UPI football polls.
But when viewed in the proper perspective, 1973

should be a successful year for Stanford football.
The Card defense is unquestionably solid in all
departments. Stillwell may be the best defensive end
on the West Coast, and Pete Hanson, Joe Martin and
Pat Donovan join him to form a strong front four.
The linebacking corps (Forrie Martin, Riegel, Geb
Church and John Snider) is impressive and the
secondary (Randy Poltl, James Ferguson, Doc
Blanchard, Jim Kaffen and Craig Zaltosky) may be
one of Stanford's best ever.
Victim Of Circumstance
The defense was more of a victim of
circumstance against Penn State and Michigan than
a victim of the Nittany Lions or Wolverines.
The offense, of course, remains a serious
question mark, especially an offensive line which
looked like a sieve against Penn State and Michigan.
But things improved Saturday, and the Cardinal
running backs were appreciative.
"The line did a good job," said fullback Scott
Laidlaw, who took advantage of the line's
improvement with 57 yards in 13 carries. "They
finally settled down — they didn't get confused or
upset. Today was a confidence-builder for our
whole offense."
But more importantly, the Cards played
Saturday with a sort of spontaneity that
characterized the Rose Bowl teams of 1970 and 71
— Stanford didn't wear down San Jose State, but
Craig Zaltosky's punt return and Mike Boryla's
fourth down touchdown pass to Eric Test destroyed
the Spartans' momentum. Plays like that bring
upsets and Stanford fans should expect some upsets
during the remainder of the season.
"I really think USC is beatable," Laidlaw said.
Well, let's not get carried away.
Stanford's football players, hesitant to offer any
self-judgment while suffering the effects and
after-effects of Penn State and Michigan, overflowed
with confidence in the locker room Saturday
following their first football victory of 1973.
"I know we have the potential," said quarterback
Mike Boryla. "We just haven't unleashed it yet."
"Before today we [the defense] were guessing
"Are we that good or are we that bad,' " said
linebacker Gordie Riegel. "But now I don't have
any doubts. That goal line stand proved a lot to our
defense and a lot to me personally."
"We finally decided to start hitting people," said
defensive end Roger Stillwell. "We're getting mean
— we're not waiting for the other team to give us a
game anymore. We're ready to go out and win on
our own."
Realistically, a 23-12 victory over San Jose State
shouldn't be a cause for celebration or excessive
confidence. "This team just looked awful those first
two games," I kept reminding myself while listening
to the players predict great things for the Cards in
the coming weeks.
Misplaced Magic
But after watching two outmanned Stanford
teams win Rose Bowl games, after witnessing scores
of lesser Stanford miracles on the football field,
after seeing the unbelievable effects of the changing
Cardinal "mood," I found myself believing every
word th ?y said.
