# Political Future Is 'Destroyed'â€”Agnew
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - Vice
President Spiro T. Agnew, according
to close associates, believes that even
without an indictment the corruption
investigation involving him has
reduced his future political prospects
to "just about zero."
Following a weekend speech to
Republican women, the vice president
met privately with a group of
California Republican officials and,

according to a spokesman, told them
he believes his political career has been
destroyed by the investigation.
J. Marsh Thomson, Agnew's press
secretary, said the state officials
disputed Agnew's view of his political
future.
The vice president, in fact, may
have drawn fresh encouragement from
the GOP women waving banners,
shouting "We want Agnew," and in

some cases standing on tables to cheer
him as he again declared his innocence
and accused the Justice Department of
trying to destroy him politically.
Agnew Speaks Out
Thomson said that after weeks of
little or no comment, Agnew decided
to speak out more sharply than ever in
his own behalf on very short notice,
sometime after he left Washington on
Friday.
"He wanted a good forum and
came to the conclusion that this
audience along with national television
was his chance to get to the American
people," Thomson said.
Agnew was moved nearly to tears
by a three-minute ovation on arrival.
After he finished his prepared,
relatively blank script, he launched his
fiercest public defense to date.
Vice-President Is Mobbed
Leaving the hall, he was mobbed by
women who knocked over barriers to
get to him. Some wore "Spiro for
President" lapel pins. "It was
amazing," said an aide. "Ordinarily
you don't worry about losing control
in an audience of women."
Agnew, he said, was "gratified by
the response but is still trying to take
it in."
The accusations against Agnew are
that he received political kickbacks
from state contractors while a county
executive and later as Maryland
governor. A federal grand jury in
Baltimore began studying evidence
against him last week.
Investigation Continues
A federal judge has given the Justice
Department permission to continue
presenting evidence but the
department has also been ordered to
answer by Friday a move by Agnew's
lawyers to halt the probe. The grand
jury is expected to reconvene
Wednesday or Thursday.
Declaring again that he would not
resign even if indicted, Agnew told his
audience he is the victim of a vengeful
conspiracy by "small and frightened
men" who dishonestly implicated him
because he would not intercede to
stop the investigation of others.
He charged also that high officials
of the Justice Department,
embarrassed by failure in Watergate
and other cases, are trying to make
him a scapegoat to restore their
reputations and destroy him
politically.
Agnew Seeks Denial
He said he would demand that they
deny under oath that they are the
source of news leaks, and if they could
not deny it, he would ask President
Nixon to "discharge those individuals
summarily."
In a statement issued after Agnew's
speech, Atty. Gen. Elliot L.

Richardson said he would "assume full
responsibility for the performance of
official duties by my subordinates.
"And I shall remain committed to
the standards of conduct and fairness
which Americans have long cherished
and which our legal system is intended
to protect."
Deal Possible
Meanwhile, Newsweek reported
yesterday that a team of Nixon's own
lawyers tried to work out a deal
between the Justice Department and
Agnew's lawyers.
The magazine said the Nixon team,
headed by J. Fred Buzhardt, made the
effort in a series of meetings and
telephone conversations last week.
The White House said last week
that the Nixon lawyers' presence at
the meetings was purely
"informational."
But Newsweek quoted a Justice
Department official as saying that the
Nixon team was seeking a deal starting
from the department's "bottom-line
requirement" that Agnew resign and
plead guilty to a charge for which he
could get at least nine months in jail.
A Justice Department spokesman
said the department would have no
comment on the Newsweek report.
There was no immediate comment
from the White House.
