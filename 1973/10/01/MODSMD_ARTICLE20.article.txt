# Cards Upset SJS In Soccer Opener
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Sparked by the outstanding
goaltending of Walt Harris, the
Stanford soccer team upset San
Jose State, 1-0, Friday night in
the Cards' opening game of the
season.
The only goal was scored
during the 35th minute of the
first half. Phil Wright dribbled
down the right sideline and took a
shot on goal, which was blocked
by Spartan goalie Gary St. Clair.
But last year's top scorer, Bobby
Geiger, kicked in the rebound,
and the Cardinals were on their
way to victory.
For San Jose, rated 18th in the
nation in a pre-season poll, it was
the first loss against four wins.
Coach Fred Priddle, overjoyed
with the victory, said, "There was
no doubt in my mind from the
moment the game started that we
would win." He described the
game as a "team effort" in which
the Cardinals played "amazingly
well."
Priddle singled out Harris,
Wright and Geiger as the Card's
outstanding players, but
emphasized that every team
member made an important
contribution.
The game was fast-paced, with
the ball exchanging hands rapidly.
Priddle was especially pleased that
his players were able to force the

Spartans to take bad shots and
make bad passes.
"San Jose took 18 shots, and
we only had eight, but they were
shooting from 25 to 30 yards out.
We didn't allow them any
close-range shots," he said.
"I don't see any reason that we
would not be ranked as one of the
top teams in the West after this
win," Priddle added. San Jose was
rated fourth in the West before
the loss.
Stanford's next game and
home opener is Wednesday against
College of Notre Dame at 3:30 on
Harry Maloney field next to
Sunken Diamond. Priddle said
that Notre Dame (Belmont)
doesn't have much of a team,
using last year's 10-0 drubbing at
the hands of the Cardinals as an
example.
However, he added that the
game should be a good warm-up
for next Saturday's contest
against the University of San
Francisco, which is rated as the
best team on the Coast and one of
the top squads in the country.
The junior varsity topped the
San Jose State JV's, 1-0, as Larry
Hilks provided the winning
margin. The freshman did not fare
so well in their first game, after
only two day's of practice, losing
to Mission High 5-1. Rich
Morroow scored the only
Stanford goal.

MIKE S PEAK Quarterback Mike Boryla fires a pass over onrushing
San Jose State defenders during Stanford's 23-12 victory over the
Spartans Saturday. Boryla completed 9 of 18 passes for 130 yards and
two touchdowns.
Sparked by the outstanding
goaltending of Walt Harris, the
Stanford soccer team upset San
Jose State, 1-0, Friday night in
the Cards' opening game of the
season.
The only goal was scored
during the 35th minute of the
first half. Phil Wright dribbled
down the right sideline and took a
shot on goal, which was blocked
by Spartan goalie Gary St. Clair.
But last year's top scorer, Bobby
Geiger, kicked in the rebound,
and the Cardinals were on their
way to victory.
For San Jose, rated 18th in the
nation in a pre-season poll, it was
the first loss against four wins.
Coach Fred Priddle, overjoyed
with the victory, said, "There was
no doubt in my mind from the
moment the game started that we
would win." He described the
game as a "team effort" in which
the Cardinals played "amazingly
well."
Priddle singled out Harris,
Wright and Geiger as the Card's
outstanding players, but
emphasized that every team
member made an important
contribution.
The game was fast-paced, with
the ball exchanging hands rapidly.
Priddle was especially pleased that
his players were able to force the

Spartans to take bad shots and
make bad passes.
"San Jose took 18 shots, and
we only had eight, but they were
shooting from 25 to 30 yards out.
We didn't allow them any
close-range shots," he said.
"I don't see any reason that we
would not be ranked as one of the
top teams in the West after this
win," Priddle added. San Jose was
rated fourth in the West before
the loss.
Stanford's next game and
home opener is Wednesday against
College of Notre Dame at 3:30 on
Harry Maloney field next to
Sunken Diamond. Priddle said
that Notre Dame (Belmont)
doesn't have much of a team,
using last year's 10-0 drubbing at
the hands of the Cardinals as an
example.
However, he added that the
game should be a good warm-up
for next Saturday's contest
against the University of San
Francisco, which is rated as the
best team on the Coast and one of
the top squads in the country.
The junior varsity topped the
San Jose State JV's, 1-0, as Larry
Hilks provided the winning
margin. The freshman did not fare
so well in their first game, after
only two day's of practice, losing
to Mission High 5-1. Rich
Morroow scored the only
Stanford goal.
