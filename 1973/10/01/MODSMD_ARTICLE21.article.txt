# California Invitational
## Polomen Finish Second 
### CHRIS BAKER 
"We're a much stronger team
than last year," asserted Stanford
water polo coach Jim Gaughran in
reviewing his teams' second place
finish in the California
Invitational tournament over the
weekend.
Gaughran had made the same
statement last week before his
Cardinal team travelled to
Berkeley but he said it with
authority Saturday after Stanford
had won three of four games to
capture the second place trophy.
The Cards defeated Pacific
14-1 and Fresno State 6-1 in
Friday's opening games to
advance to Saturday's three-team,
round-robin finals. On Saturday
Stanford defeated UC-Davis 10-6
but lost 11-1 to California. The
Bears, ranked number one in the
nation, clinched the championship
with a 9-1 victory over Davis.
"Even though the score may
not indicate it, we played really
well against Cal," Gaughran said.
"We were tied 1-1 at the end of
the first quarter. We did get
nervous in the second half, but
Cal's team has played together for
a long time and that had to have a
great deal of effect on the second
half."
Cal shut off Stanford's fast
break offense as the Cards were
held to just one goal — a second
period tally by Craig Van Zandt.
Tom Cummings performed
creditably in the nets but the Card

defense was simply incapable of
stopping the nation's top-ranked
team.
In the earlier games, however,
Stanford compiled some
impressive statistics.
Against Pacific, Andy
McDonald led the scoring with
three goals while Dean Anderson,
Tom Warden and John-Paul
Roberts contributed two goals
apiece. Rick Gebers, Van Zandt,
Larry Mann and Stan Johnson
rounded out the scoring with one
goal each.
Roberts scored twice again
against Fresno State and
Anderson, Warden and Johnson
each fired one shot past the
Bulldog goalie.
Gebers and Matt Greer each
scored four times in the victory
over UC-Davis. Lointz and
Roberts contributed two goals
apiece.

"Our offense needs a little
more work at controlling the
ball," Gaughran said in analyzing
his team's weekend performance.
"The biggest part of our fast
break offense is the timing. That's
why these games are important to
us.
"Right now we're trying to get
the whole team set," Gaughran
continued. "Rather than just
keeping our best team in the
game, I tried to see all of our
players perform in a game
situation."
The Cards will host Long
Beach City College Wednesday at
3:30 p.m. in Stanford's first home
game. The Northern California
Open tournament is on tap for the
weekend at DeAnza and Foothill
Colleges. The Cards will face
DeAnza, Humboldt State and
Long Beach State in Friday's
opening round games.

Long Beach State in Friday's
opening round games.
"We're a much stronger team
than last year," asserted Stanford
water polo coach Jim Gaughran in
reviewing his teams' second place
finish in the California
Invitational tournament over the
weekend.
Gaughran had made the same
statement last week before his
Cardinal team travelled to
Berkeley but he said it with
authority Saturday after Stanford
had won three of four games to
capture the second place trophy.
The Cards defeated Pacific
14-1 and Fresno State 6-1 in
Friday's opening games to
advance to Saturday's three-team,
round-robin finals. On Saturday
Stanford defeated UC-Davis 10-6
but lost 11-1 to California. The
Bears, ranked number one in the
nation, clinched the championship
with a 9-1 victory over Davis.
"Even though the score may
not indicate it, we played really
well against Cal," Gaughran said.
"We were tied 1-1 at the end of
the first quarter. We did get
nervous in the second half, but
Cal's team has played together for
a long time and that had to have a
great deal of effect on the second
half."
Cal shut off Stanford's fast
break offense as the Cards were
held to just one goal — a second
period tally by Craig Van Zandt.
Tom Cummings performed
creditably in the nets but the Card

defense was simply incapable of
stopping the nation's top-ranked
team.
In the earlier games, however,
Stanford compiled some
impressive statistics.
Against Pacific, Andy
McDonald led the scoring with
three goals while Dean Anderson,
Tom Warden and John-Paul
Roberts contributed two goals
apiece. Rick Gebers, Van Zandt,
Larry Mann and Stan Johnson
rounded out the scoring with one
goal each.
Roberts scored twice again
against Fresno State and
Anderson, Warden and Johnson
each fired one shot past the
Bulldog goalie.
Gebers and Matt Greer each
scored four times in the victory
over UC-Davis. Lointz and
Roberts contributed two goals
apiece.

"Our offense needs a little
more work at controlling the
ball," Gaughran said in analyzing
his team's weekend performance.
"The biggest part of our fast
break offense is the timing. That's
why these games are important to
us.
"Right now we're trying to get
the whole team set," Gaughran
continued. "Rather than just
keeping our best team in the
game, I tried to see all of our
players perform in a game
situation."
The Cards will host Long
Beach City College Wednesday at
3:30 p.m. in Stanford's first home
game. The Northern California
Open tournament is on tap for the
weekend at DeAnza and Foothill
Colleges. The Cards will face
DeAnza, Humboldt State and
Long Beach State in Friday's
opening round games.
