Nixon To Visit Europe Soon?
WASHINGTON — West German Chancellor Willy
Brandt predicted after weekend talks with President
Nixon that the American leader will visit Western Europe
within the next few months.
Nixon, said Brandt, "will visit individual countries in
addition to visiting NATO and the European Common
Market."
Nixon had proclaimed 1973 "the year of Europe" and
proposed a declaration of principles between the United
States and the European allies. However, slow progress on
the proposal led to speculation that the trip might be
postponed until next year.
Brandt said Nixon "will be welcome in Germany
whether he comes now or later."
The German leader said consultations on the proposed
declaration are progressing well despite what he termed
"impatient statements" one might hear about them.
"One should perhaps understand impatience. There
can't be progress in any field without impatience," Brandt
told reporters.
Brandt volunteered the remarks about the planned
Nixon trip during a news conference Saturday shortly
before he returned to Bonn.
Troop Reduction Uncertain
WASHINGTON - The 110,000-man reduction in U.S.
troop strength in Europe voted by the Senate last week is
not likely to emerge intact from a conference with the
House, Senate Democratic Leader Mike Mansfield says.
Mansfield, who has proposed a far larger cutback, said,
however, he does believe a reduction will result from the
48 to 36 vote by which the Senate Thursday approved an
amendment offered by Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey,
D-Minn.
"I think the Humphrey amendment represents without
question the sentiment in the Senate," Mansfield said in a
conversation with newsmen over the weekend.
"The House conferees don't look on it with much
favor," he said. "But I'm not discouraged at that. I
anticipate some reductions will come out of this."
Mansfield has campaigned for years for reducing the
size of American forces in Europe, contending the United
States can no longer afford to pay the price of a
commitment established at the end of World War 11, 28
years ago.
The White House has contended it cannot afford a
unilateral troop reduction of any size at a time when it is
preparing for long-range talks with the Soviet Union on

mutual troop cutbacks.
Wreckage Found In Arkansas
MEN A, Ark—Wreckage believed to be that of a Texas
International airliner missing since Thursday with 11
persons aboard was spotted yesterday on a mountainside
near here, Civil Air Patrol officials said.
CAP Col. Charles McKinnon said it could not be
immediately determined whether there were any
survivors. He said a helicopter was at the scene and medics
were being lowered to the wreckage.
The plane is in an area almost 100 miles north of the
plane's scheduled flight path.
Discovery of the wreckage was first reported by Texas
International officials in Houston, Tex. The CAP and
Arkansas state police confirmed the sighting.
It could not be learned immediately how the wreckage
was spotted. A massive land and air search which started
Friday had not been scheduled to move into the Mena
area until today.
Earlier yesterday, search officials had reported the
sighting of a large, burned-out area in south-central
Arkansas.
The airliner, a Convair turbo-prop jet with eight
passengers and a crew of three aboard, disappeared
Thursday night on a 75-mile flight between the south
Arkansas cities of El Dorado and Texarkana.

Nixon To Visit Europe Soon?
WASHINGTON — West German Chancellor Willy
Brandt predicted after weekend talks with President
Nixon that the American leader will visit Western Europe
within the next few months.
Nixon, said Brandt, "will visit individual countries in
addition to visiting NATO and the European Common
Market."
Nixon had proclaimed 1973 "the year of Europe" and
proposed a declaration of principles between the United
States and the European allies. However, slow progress on
the proposal led to speculation that the trip might be
postponed until next year.
Brandt said Nixon "will be welcome in Germany
whether he comes now or later."
The German leader said consultations on the proposed
declaration are progressing well despite what he termed
"impatient statements" one might hear about them.
"One should perhaps understand impatience. There
can't be progress in any field without impatience," Brandt
told reporters.
Brandt volunteered the remarks about the planned
Nixon trip during a news conference Saturday shortly
before he returned to Bonn.
Troop Reduction Uncertain
WASHINGTON - The 110,000-man reduction in U.S.
troop strength in Europe voted by the Senate last week is
not likely to emerge intact from a conference with the
House, Senate Democratic Leader Mike Mansfield says.
Mansfield, who has proposed a far larger cutback, said,
however, he does believe a reduction will result from the
48 to 36 vote by which the Senate Thursday approved an
amendment offered by Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey,
D-Minn.
"I think the Humphrey amendment represents without
question the sentiment in the Senate," Mansfield said in a
conversation with newsmen over the weekend.
"The House conferees don't look on it with much
favor," he said. "But I'm not discouraged at that. I
anticipate some reductions will come out of this."
Mansfield has campaigned for years for reducing the
size of American forces in Europe, contending the United
States can no longer afford to pay the price of a
commitment established at the end of World War 11, 28
years ago.
The White House has contended it cannot afford a
unilateral troop reduction of any size at a time when it is
preparing for long-range talks with the Soviet Union on

mutual troop cutbacks.
Wreckage Found In Arkansas
MEN A, Ark—Wreckage believed to be that of a Texas
International airliner missing since Thursday with 11
persons aboard was spotted yesterday on a mountainside
near here, Civil Air Patrol officials said.
CAP Col. Charles McKinnon said it could not be
immediately determined whether there were any
survivors. He said a helicopter was at the scene and medics
were being lowered to the wreckage.
The plane is in an area almost 100 miles north of the
plane's scheduled flight path.
Discovery of the wreckage was first reported by Texas
International officials in Houston, Tex. The CAP and
Arkansas state police confirmed the sighting.
It could not be learned immediately how the wreckage
was spotted. A massive land and air search which started
Friday had not been scheduled to move into the Mena
area until today.
Earlier yesterday, search officials had reported the
sighting of a large, burned-out area in south-central
Arkansas.
The airliner, a Convair turbo-prop jet with eight
passengers and a crew of three aboard, disappeared
Thursday night on a 75-mile flight between the south
