# Lively Arts To Begin Student Discount Plan
## 
### GLENN KRAMON 
Director of Public Events Tom
Bacchetti has announced two new
discounts designed to encourage
student attendance at lively arts
performances on campus this year.
Speaking at a press conference
Friday, Bacchetti outlined plans for a
uniform price of $2 for all student
tickets. Such tickets, formerly
available only at the door just before
the performance, may be purchased at
any time for the best available seats in
any section.
Students must present a valid
student body card both at the time of
purchase, which must be made in
person, and at the gate. Student
spouses are eligible for the discount
tickets if they present a properly
marked student body card.
Freshman Plan
Bacchetti also announced an
introductory ticket plan for all
freshmen, transfer and new graduate
students living in on-campus
residences. New students will be
assigned to one performance by
residence and will go as a group. They
will also receive a coupon enabling
them to attend a second performance
of their choice for 50 cents.
New students living off campus
who desire such coupons should
consult the Dean of Student Affairs'
office, Bacchetti advised.
Terming the student discount an
experiment "to see how important
money is in the student's decision to
attend" a performance, Bacchetti said
he will be interested to see if allowing
the uniform student ticket charge of
$2 will increase attendance.
Consequences
Asked of the fiscal consequences of
such a move for the Office of Public
Events, Bacchetti observed that "if we
sold out every performance at $2,
we'd just about break even." He added
without releasing a specific figure that
the University has pledged some
financial support.

Bacchetti noted that last year, "we
didn't break even. We made up 67
percent of total costs at the box
office." But he added that Public
Events made up some of the deficit
over the summer through a travel film
series and several performances of the
Preservation Hall Jazz Band.
Though declining to cite figures of
last year's deficit, Bacchetti said that
"a survey of ten selected colleges
showed that, with one exception [the
Claremont Colleges], our financial
performance has been the best" in
terms of self-sufficiency. He observed
that UC Berkeley and UCLA, both
included in the survey, "are much
more heavily underwritten by the
university."
Interaction
Stressing "the interaction of
students and artists on more than just
a performance level," Bacchetti said
that this year University residences
will host many of the artists before
and after their performances here. He
noted that Branner Hall and Roble
Hall will entertain the Alvin Ailey
City Center Dance Theatre during its
stay Oct. 17-20.
Bacchetti said he has been working
on increased access to Memorial
Auditorium, presently occupied
primarily by drama department
functions, for Public Events
performances. "We need to
acoustically isolate the Little Theatre
from the main stage in order to use
both at the same time," he said.
Questioned about future use of
Frost Amphitheatre for rock concerts,
Bacchetti stated that "the moratorium
is still on for rock concerts there until
we can renovate the place" with
stronger fences. He added that "rock
concerts tore the hell out of that
place."
The moratorium was placed on
Frost rock concerts shortly after
incidents of violence erupted during an
Elvin Bishop-Cold Blood concert there
in July, 1971.
