# Village Stages Protest Opposing 'Arbitrary' Escondido Rent Hikes
## 
### JOHN FREED 
Escondido Village residents are
staging a rent slowdown to protest
"arbitrary" and "unjustifiable" rent
increases, while University officials
apparently plan no immediate action.
Last Wednesday, the Escondido
Village Council formally endorsed the
slowdown, with only one dissenting
vote. Cheryl Faught, an organizer of
the protest, observed that such
solidarity is unusual for village
members.
"People were overwhelmingly in
favor of the slowdown. They showed a
sense of community rarely found in a
group with such a high turnover," she
said.
In the face of the nearly unanimous

vote of the council, University officials
still expressed uncertainty over the
number of persons supporting the
slowdown, according to Alan
Cummings, newly appointed manager
of student residences.
'Individual Decision'
"Once the academic quarter has
begun and things become rather stable,
in a week or so, then we can see the
number of people involved in the rent
slowdown. Whether to pay the rent is
an individual decision," Cummings
said.
The controversy centers around a
five percent rent increase effective
Sept. 1. The University originally set
the increase at seven percent, but that
figure was reduced after negotiations

between residents and administrators.
The residents want the raise cut to
only one or two percent. They will
refuse to pay the five percent increase
in their rent.
"The residents and administration
all agree on the basic facts and
variables involved, yet the residents
came up with one plan and the
University came up with something
entirely different. There's no way in
the world the University could come
up with five percent when the
information shows that one to three
percent would take care of it," Faught
claimed.
Life Span
The differences arise because the
residents would like to consider a
40-year life span for the entire project,
while administrators prefer to look
just 10 years ahead. The conflict
surfaced during meetings of residents
and administrators studying the rent
situation.
University financial analyst Dave
Bell, who provided statistical
information to the committee,
explained that small errors in
projected inflation could cost
hundreds of thousands of dollars over
the 40-year period.
"The University prefers not to take
a great deal of risk in the matter," Bell
remarked.
Bell-Shaped Curve
Since major expenses for the
project approximate a bell-shaped
curve, residents will pay for more of
the peak expenses now than in 20
years, Bell explained. In this way, the
University can recover more of their
losses if, for example, demand for
housing in the village drops in the year
2000.
"The residents in the next 20 years
will subsidize those in the last 20

years. We're paying for a
roof-and-a-half, while they'll only have
to pay for half-a-roof," said resident
Bill Faught.
Administrators and residents on the
committee — which included Bill
Faught — issued an interim committee
report dated Sept. 4. However, only a
small percentage of all the information
has been considered by the committee,
according to Cheryl Faught.
No Justification
"The administration has only
looked at 20 percent of the material
we sent them last June. The Escondido
Village Council felt that, until the rent
report was complete, the University
had absolutely no justification for the
rent increase," she charged.
"The five percent rent increase
seemed to be rather arbitrary, and
many lower-echelon administration
officials seem to have the
responsibility of defending it," her
husband said.
The slowdown, which amounts to
an average of $10 per month for
villagers, could force a confrontation
by February. When a resident becomes
$50 delinquent in payments, the
University can hold up his registration
materials. Mrs. Faught hopes such a
confrontation will not be necessary.
Hope For Settlement
"I would definitely hope it would
be settled by February. I had hoped
we could reach an agreement by
October, though it might take longer
than a month," she said.
The administration view, however,
seemed to be that the matter was
essentially over, according to
Cummings.
"The feeling from the members of
the rent committee was that those
items chosen to be studied over the
summer were really studied very
thoroughly. Other areas, perhaps
having a lower dollar impact on rents,
will be studied in the coming weeks
and months. I don't intend to redo the
committee's work.
"I don't think there's any
immediate reaction to the council's
endorsement of the slowdown,"
Cummings concluded.
Mrs. Faught emphasized that the
slowdown had nothing to do with a
recent administrative reshuffling which
saw Cummings replace Frank E.
Gallagher as village director.
"The slowdown is definitely not
aimed at the new director. We want to
make that very clear," she said.
Campus Road Opens
The new Quarry Road extension to
Campus Drive near the Stanford
Medical Center has been opened ahead
of schedule, Oscar Nelson, master
planner for the Facilities Planning
Office reported Tuesday, Sept. 25.
The $90,000 project is a divided
two-lane road which now makes access
to the shopping center, professional
area and neighboring parking lots
much more convenient, Nelson said.

favor of the slowdown. They showed a
sense of community rarely found in a
group with such a high turnover," she
said.
In the face of the nearly unanimous

vote of the council, University officials
still expressed uncertainty over the
number of persons supporting the
slowdown, according to Alan
Cummings, newly appointed manager
of student residences.
'Individual Decision'
"Once the academic quarter has
begun and things become rather stable,
in a week or so, then we can see the
number of people involved in the rent
slowdown. Whether to pay the rent is
an individual decision," Cummings
said.
The controversy centers around a
five percent rent increase effective
Sept. 1. The University originally set
the increase at seven percent, but that
figure was reduced after negotiations

between residents and administrators.
The residents want the raise cut to
only one or two percent. They will
refuse to pay the five percent increase
in their rent.
"The residents and administration
all agree on the basic facts and
variables involved, yet the residents
came up with one plan and the
University came up with something
entirely different. There's no way in
the world the University could come
up with five percent when the
information shows that one to three
percent would take care of it," Faught
claimed.
Life Span
The differences arise because the
residents would like to consider a
40-year life span for the entire project,
while administrators prefer to look
just 10 years ahead. The conflict
surfaced during meetings of residents
and administrators studying the rent
situation.
University financial analyst Dave
Bell, who provided statistical
information to the committee,
explained that small errors in
projected inflation could cost
hundreds of thousands of dollars over
the 40-year period.
"The University prefers not to take
a great deal of risk in the matter," Bell
remarked.
Bell-Shaped Curve
Since major expenses for the
project approximate a bell-shaped
curve, residents will pay for more of
the peak expenses now than in 20
years, Bell explained. In this way, the
University can recover more of their
losses if, for example, demand for
housing in the village drops in the year
2000.
"The residents in the next 20 years
will subsidize those in the last 20

years. We're paying for a
roof-and-a-half, while they'll only have
to pay for half-a-roof," said resident
Bill Faught.
Administrators and residents on the
committee — which included Bill
Faught — issued an interim committee
report dated Sept. 4. However, only a
small percentage of all the information
has been considered by the committee,
according to Cheryl Faught.
No Justification
"The administration has only
looked at 20 percent of the material
we sent them last June. The Escondido
Village Council felt that, until the rent
report was complete, the University
had absolutely no justification for the
rent increase," she charged.
"The five percent rent increase
seemed to be rather arbitrary, and
many lower-echelon administration
officials seem to have the
responsibility of defending it," her
husband said.
The slowdown, which amounts to
an average of $10 per month for
villagers, could force a confrontation
by February. When a resident becomes
$50 delinquent in payments, the
University can hold up his registration
materials. Mrs. Faught hopes such a
confrontation will not be necessary.
Hope For Settlement
"I would definitely hope it would
be settled by February. I had hoped
we could reach an agreement by
October, though it might take longer
than a month," she said.
The administration view, however,
seemed to be that the matter was
essentially over, according to
Cummings.
"The feeling from the members of
the rent committee was that those
items chosen to be studied over the
summer were really studied very
thoroughly. Other areas, perhaps
having a lower dollar impact on rents,
will be studied in the coming weeks
and months. I don't intend to redo the
committee's work.
"I don't think there's any
immediate reaction to the council's
endorsement of the slowdown,"
Cummings concluded.
Mrs. Faught emphasized that the
slowdown had nothing to do with a
recent administrative reshuffling which
saw Cummings replace Frank E.
Gallagher as village director.
"The slowdown is definitely not
aimed at the new director. We want to
make that very clear," she said.
Campus Road Opens
The new Quarry Road extension to
Campus Drive near the Stanford
Medical Center has been opened ahead
of schedule, Oscar Nelson, master
planner for the Facilities Planning
Office reported Tuesday, Sept. 25.
The $90,000 project is a divided
two-lane road which now makes access
to the shopping center, professional
area and neighboring parking lots
much more convenient, Nelson said.
Escondido Village residents are
staging a rent slowdown to protest
"arbitrary" and "unjustifiable" rent
increases, while University officials
apparently plan no immediate action.
Last Wednesday, the Escondido
Village Council formally endorsed the
slowdown, with only one dissenting
vote. Cheryl Faught, an organizer of
the protest, observed that such
solidarity is unusual for village
members.

number of people involved in the rent
slowdown. Whether to pay the rent is
an individual decision," Cummings
said.
The controversy centers around a
five percent rent increase effective
Sept. 1. The University originally set
the increase at seven percent, but that
figure was reduced after negotiations

between residents and administrators.
The residents want the raise cut to
only one or two percent. They will
refuse to pay the five percent increase
in their rent.
"The residents and administration
all agree on the basic facts and
variables involved, yet the residents
came up with one plan and the
University came up with something
entirely different. There's no way in
the world the University could come
up with five percent when the
information shows that one to three
percent would take care of it," Faught
claimed.
Life Span
The differences arise because the
residents would like to consider a
40-year life span for the entire project,
while administrators prefer to look
just 10 years ahead. The conflict
surfaced during meetings of residents
and administrators studying the rent
situation.
University financial analyst Dave
Bell, who provided statistical
information to the committee,
explained that small errors in
projected inflation could cost
hundreds of thousands of dollars over
the 40-year period.
"The University prefers not to take
a great deal of risk in the matter," Bell
remarked.
Bell-Shaped Curve
Since major expenses for the
project approximate a bell-shaped
curve, residents will pay for more of
the peak expenses now than in 20
years, Bell explained. In this way, the
University can recover more of their
losses if, for example, demand for
housing in the village drops in the year
2000.
"The residents in the next 20 years
will subsidize those in the last 20

years. We're paying for a
roof-and-a-half, while they'll only have
to pay for half-a-roof," said resident
Bill Faught.
Administrators and residents on the
committee — which included Bill
Faught — issued an interim committee
report dated Sept. 4. However, only a
small percentage of all the information
has been considered by the committee,
according to Cheryl Faught.
No Justification
"The administration has only
looked at 20 percent of the material
we sent them last June. The Escondido
Village Council felt that, until the rent
report was complete, the University
had absolutely no justification for the
rent increase," she charged.
"The five percent rent increase
seemed to be rather arbitrary, and
many lower-echelon administration
officials seem to have the
responsibility of defending it," her
husband said.
The slowdown, which amounts to
an average of $10 per month for
villagers, could force a confrontation
by February. When a resident becomes
$50 delinquent in payments, the
University can hold up his registration
materials. Mrs. Faught hopes such a
confrontation will not be necessary.
Hope For Settlement
"I would definitely hope it would
be settled by February. I had hoped
we could reach an agreement by
October, though it might take longer
than a month," she said.
The administration view, however,
seemed to be that the matter was
essentially over, according to
Cummings.
"The feeling from the members of
the rent committee was that those
items chosen to be studied over the
summer were really studied very
thoroughly. Other areas, perhaps
having a lower dollar impact on rents,
will be studied in the coming weeks
and months. I don't intend to redo the
committee's work.
"I don't think there's any
immediate reaction to the council's
endorsement of the slowdown,"
Cummings concluded.
Mrs. Faught emphasized that the
slowdown had nothing to do with a
recent administrative reshuffling which
saw Cummings replace Frank E.
Gallagher as village director.
"The slowdown is definitely not
aimed at the new director. We want to
make that very clear," she said.
Campus Road Opens
The new Quarry Road extension to
Campus Drive near the Stanford
Medical Center has been opened ahead
of schedule, Oscar Nelson, master
planner for the Facilities Planning
Office reported Tuesday, Sept. 25.
The $90,000 project is a divided
two-lane road which now makes access
to the shopping center, professional
area and neighboring parking lots
much more convenient, Nelson said.
Escondido Village residents are
staging a rent slowdown to protest
"arbitrary" and "unjustifiable" rent
increases, while University officials
apparently plan no immediate action.
Last Wednesday, the Escondido
Village Council formally endorsed the
slowdown, with only one dissenting
vote. Cheryl Faught, an organizer of
the protest, observed that such
solidarity is unusual for village
members.
"People were overwhelmingly in
favor of the slowdown. They showed a
sense of community rarely found in a
group with such a high turnover," she
said.
In the face of the nearly unanimous

vote of the council, University officials
still expressed uncertainty over the
number of persons supporting the
slowdown, according to Alan
Cummings, newly appointed manager
of student residences.
'Individual Decision'
"Once the academic quarter has
begun and things become rather stable,
in a week or so, then we can see the
number of people involved in the rent
slowdown. Whether to pay the rent is
an individual decision," Cummings
said.
