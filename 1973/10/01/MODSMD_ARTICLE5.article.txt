# McCloskey Supports Agnew Request
## Congressman Speaks At 'Zots' 
### 
Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr.,
R-Menlo Park, said Saturday that he
supported Vice President Spiro
Agnew's request for the House of
Representatives to investigate criminal
allegations against him.
Speaking to between 75 and 100

persons at the Alpine Beer Garden
[Zots] in Portola Valley, McCloskey
indicated there is no evidence so far to
convince him that Agnew should be
impeached. "I don't think you can
impeach a man without evidence
against him," McCloskey said.

The maverick fourth-term
representative said that while complete
federal financing of election campaigns
would be an improvement over the
present system, an even better system
would have the federal government
matching small private donations on a
dollar-for-dollar basis.
He noted, however, that this system
would increase the power of labor
unions that can exert pressure on their
memberships to contribute.
McCloskey urged increased citizen
interest in news as one way to end
corruption in government. He urged
his listeners to join such
politically-active groups as Common
Cause and the League of Women
Voters, and to become more aware of
the news.
Considering local issues, McCloskey
suggested that Stanford students ought
to occupy more than 100
federally-financed houses in East Palo
Alto that are currently unoccupied. He
said the students' presence could ease
racial tensions in the area. However, he
noted that the project would need
government assistance and approval.
McCloskey also touched on revision
of laws concerning medical
malpractice suits, which he said ought
to be eliminated. However, he warned
against trends towards socializing
medicine.
The congressman said that price
controls sometimes prove necessary to
keep the economy on an even keel,
but added that he didn't feel President
Nixon's Phase Four plans were
working.
