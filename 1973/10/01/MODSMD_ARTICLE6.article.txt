# Breakfast Of Dunderheads
## To Start Off Fall Quarter...

Is Stanford a school with good
taste, or does it taste good? Well,
after reading accounts from the
annals of upperclassman diaries, it
seems like a fresh point of view
would be refreshing — fresh
anyway. Since grad students have
the unique privilege of populating
almost half the student body, the
record of their experiences seems
important as well.
Many of us have been on or
around campus for almost three
weeks now, and probably the
most astounding phenomenon
observed thus far was the terrific
influx of people prior to
registration. We had been warned
there were around 11,000 in this
year's student body, but that's
hard to believe after one has

wandered around campus for two
weeks with hardly a soul in sight.
And a good number of those you
saw you knew, either through the
Clearinghouse or pre-registration
activities. By the way, a word of
thanks to those who worked for
the Clearinghouse is in turn.
It appears the Clearinghouse
was originally set up as an
efficient means to get housing for
new students and to provide some
orientation to the campus. But
through the largely volunteer
efforts of some rare people (Sally,"
Mark, Kelly, Esther, Alan, Jerry,
and others — you know who you
are) what could have been endless
red tape and bureaucratic
merrygoroundsturned into a really
good experience. Where else could
you see San Francisco from a
cable car, eat at a restaurant in
Chinatown, then time trip back to
the Renaissance period at the
Pleasure Faire, and end up tasting
wine in the Napa vineyards, and
more if one's imagination
exceeded the time and energy
drain from that series of culture
shocks. The most amazing part of
all of this is that we got to know
each other a little better during
these escapades.
Among the most exciting and
at the same time confusing
discoveries we made was that as a
group we were about as
homogeneous as the U.N. People
had come from France, Germany,

England, Canada, Mexico, Latin
America, Japan, China, and just
about any Rich- or Po-dunk town
you could name in the good old
U.S. of A. And I thought the
Midwest was a long way to come
from ... but let me tell you, it
i5....
Some quick impressions of the
campus and Palo Alto: why is
some of the grass watered
completely and the rest left to
burn up? Half of the place looks
like a package of Camels and the
other half like a Salem
commercial. Bikes are definitely
king of the road here, on and off
campus, but if everyone has a
bike, why so many thefts? Selling
bike chains is almost a better
business than bikes. One idea.
Take up a collection for those
who can't afford one. Then
everybody will be happier. Palo
Alto appears to be one big snake,
the only problem is figuring out
which way it's crawling. Answer:
towards the fault.
As all "serious" grad students
must finally do, it is time for me
to crawl back into the woodwork
for a week, so as to help bring to
fruition Lincoln Moses' ambitious
prediction that next Spring the
grad "straights" will outnumber
the u.g. "freaks." With or without
me, thy will be done. Until then.
