# Repression Continues
## Stop U.S. Financing Of Thieu's Prisons 
### 
Jonathan Marshall

Last week the press reported
with some fanfare the release of
Mme. Ngo Ba Thanh from a South
Vietnamese jail after two years of
confinement without trial.
Although arrested for her role as
head of the Women's Movement
for the Right to Live (obviously a
subversive organization), the
Thieu government denies that
politics have anything to do with
it. .. there are no 'political
prisoners' in South Vietnam," its
Ambassador states flatly.
"The law in South Vietnam
does not permit the arrest of a
person merely for his opposition
to the policies of the
government." Perhaps the 43-year
old lawyer, once offered a
teaching post at Columbia
University, was arrested under
Article 2 of Decree Law
93/SL/CIT which defines
"incitement of neutralism" as a
crime against the State.
These last two years, Ngo Ba
Thanh came to be a symbol of the
repression in South Vietnam.
Thieu's own denials to the
contrary, Anglican News Service
reports that "The prisoners now
thought to be in custody in South
Vietnam total more than 240,000
and include students, adults, and a
number of clergy."
This estimate is shared by the
American Friends Service

Committee, former South
Vietnamese government officials,
Amnesty International, and by
such independent experts as Don
Luce of International Volunteer
Services and Joseph Buttinger.
Most of these prisoners are the
"third force" neutralists;
communists who are captured
tend to die after interrogation
sessions.
Prison Conditions
Although the International
Red Cross has been denied access
to South Vietnam's prisons,
reports of conditions inside do
leak out. As one American
Bishop, returned from South
Vietnam, reported recently, "I
can state unequivocally that there
are political prisoners in Saigon's
jails and in jails throughout the
provinces.... There can be
absolutely no doubt about this.
And it is clear that these prisoners
are subject to inhuman treatment,
including deliberate and
prolonged torture."
The testimony of former
prisoners, including two
Frenchmen recently released after
international protest, confirms
this judgement with grisly detail.
So do the reports of two
American Congressmen who
visited the infamous "tiger cages"
on Con Son island, where
thousands of prisoners are starved,

paralyzed from the cramped
conditions, and burned and
blinded by the lye poured on
them at frequent intervals.
Did the Thieu Government's
release of Mme. Ngo Ba Thanh
reflect a new policy of
liberalization, in the spirit of
national reconciliation promised
by the Paris peace accord? Or, as
cynics might claim, did her release
parallel that of Truong Dzu,
runner up in the 1967 elections,
just before Thieu visited the US
last April?
If ever there was an auspicious
time for Thieu to defuse the
prisoner issue by a token act of
mercy, it would be now, as the
Senate considers the latest
Foreign Aid Bill.
Amendment
Senator Abourezk has offered
an amendment to the Bill which
will deeply trouble most of
America's free world allies. It
provides simply that "no funds
authorized by this or any other
act will be used to provide
economic or military assistance to
the government of any foreign
country which persecutes by
internment or imprisonment, that
country's citizens for political
purposes." What would this mean
to Thieu, besides the collapse of
South Vietnam's dollar-dependent
economy?
Besides paying 90 percent of
the Saigon Government's costs,
including provision of its vast
arsenal of planes, bombs, and
ammunition, the United States
assumes the cost of running
Thieu's police force and prison
system. For example, two
American construction companies
(Brown & Root and Raymond
International) were awarded a
$400,000 contract from the US
Navy to build a new batch of tiger
cages to house an expanding
prison population; the floor area
is 2 sq. feet smaller than before.
The condition of a group of
prisoners released last March from
such cells was described by Time
Magazine: "It is not really proper
to call them men anymore.
'Shapes' is a better word —
grotesque sculptures of scarred
flesh and gnarled limbs."
The Nixon administration, in
direct violation of the Paris peace
agreement signed by the United
States last January, has budgeted
over $20 million for fiscal year
1974 to increase the efficiency of
Saigon's police and prison system,
a fifty percent increase over last
year. Formerly channeled to the
Thieu government through the
"public safety" program, the aid
will arrive under such headings as
"technical support," "public
administration," and "public
works" — an obvious effort to
fool Congress and bypass the
peace agreement.
Expenditures
As , far as the Senate
Subcommittee on Refugees has
been able to determine, the
Agency for International
Development will spend $869,000
for police computer training
under "technical support"; $1.5
million for a new telecommunica
tions system under "public
works"; $256,000 to train police
officers at the International Police
Academy (remember State of

Siege?); $10.6 million for new
equipment required by Siagon's
expanding police force; $3.3
million for general support of the
prison system under the
"American Aid Chapter" of the
Vietnamese budget; and $3.8
million for miscellaneous
expenditures.
The United States helps fill the
jails it builds through the
CIA-sponsored Phoenix program,
designed to kill or jail civilians
suspected of helping the Viet
Cong. Thieu has used the program
to eliminate a wide variety of
opponents, including Buddhists,
students, and labor leaders.
Official figures indicate that as of
a year ago 27,000 civilians had
been "neutralized" and another
100,000 taken prisoner.
Summary
Senator Alan Cranston has
summed up the situation: "AID is
continuing to bolster a cruel and
repressive police apparatus in
South Vietnam. A vast
surveillance system is in effect,
aided by US communications
equipment and personnel. Police
torture and inhuman jail
conditions, including the
notorious [US financed] tiger
cages, await those who criticize
the government's policies."
There is one immediate course
of action open to those who
would fight American complicity
with the Thieu dictatorship. Write

your representatives in
Washington immediately, asking
them to support the Abourezk
amendment to the Foreign Aid
Bill, and to cut off all aid to the
Saigon regime.

million for a new telecommunica
tions system under "public
works"; $256,000 to train police
officers at the International Police
Academy (remember State of

Siege?); $10.6 million for new
equipment required by Siagon's
expanding police force; $3.3
million for general support of the
prison system under the
"American Aid Chapter" of the
Vietnamese budget; and $3.8
million for miscellaneous
expenditures.
The United States helps fill the
jails it builds through the
CIA-sponsored Phoenix program,
designed to kill or jail civilians
suspected of helping the Viet
Cong. Thieu has used the program
to eliminate a wide variety of
opponents, including Buddhists,
students, and labor leaders.
Official figures indicate that as of
a year ago 27,000 civilians had
been "neutralized" and another
100,000 taken prisoner.
Summary
Senator Alan Cranston has
summed up the situation: "AID is
continuing to bolster a cruel and
repressive police apparatus in
South Vietnam. A vast
surveillance system is in effect,
aided by US communications
equipment and personnel. Police
torture and inhuman jail
conditions, including the
notorious [US financed] tiger
cages, await those who criticize
the government's policies."
There is one immediate course
of action open to those who
would fight American complicity
with the Thieu dictatorship. Write

your representatives in
Washington immediately, asking
them to support the Abourezk
amendment to the Foreign Aid
Bill, and to cut off all aid to the
Saigon regime.

Last week the press reported
with some fanfare the release of
Mme. Ngo Ba Thanh from a South
Vietnamese jail after two years of
confinement without trial.
Although arrested for her role as
head of the Women's Movement
for the Right to Live (obviously a
subversive organization), the
Thieu government denies that
politics have anything to do with
it. .. there are no 'political
prisoners' in South Vietnam," its
Ambassador states flatly.
"The law in South Vietnam
does not permit the arrest of a
person merely for his opposition
to the policies of the
government." Perhaps the 43-year
old lawyer, once offered a
teaching post at Columbia
University, was arrested under
Article 2 of Decree Law
93/SL/CIT which defines
"incitement of neutralism" as a
crime against the State.
These last two years, Ngo Ba
Thanh came to be a symbol of the
repression in South Vietnam.
Thieu's own denials to the
contrary, Anglican News Service
reports that "The prisoners now
thought to be in custody in South
Vietnam total more than 240,000
and include students, adults, and a
number of clergy."
This estimate is shared by the
American Friends Service

Committee, former South
Vietnamese government officials,
Amnesty International, and by
such independent experts as Don
Luce of International Volunteer
Services and Joseph Buttinger.
Most of these prisoners are the
"third force" neutralists;
communists who are captured
tend to die after interrogation
sessions.
Prison Conditions
Although the International
Red Cross has been denied access
to South Vietnam's prisons,
reports of conditions inside do
leak out. As one American
Bishop, returned from South
Vietnam, reported recently, "I
can state unequivocally that there
are political prisoners in Saigon's
jails and in jails throughout the
provinces.... There can be
absolutely no doubt about this.
And it is clear that these prisoners
are subject to inhuman treatment,
including deliberate and
prolonged torture."
The testimony of former
prisoners, including two
Frenchmen recently released after
international protest, confirms
this judgement with grisly detail.
So do the reports of two
American Congressmen who
visited the infamous "tiger cages"
on Con Son island, where
thousands of prisoners are starved,

paralyzed from the cramped
conditions, and burned and
blinded by the lye poured on
them at frequent intervals.
Did the Thieu Government's
release of Mme. Ngo Ba Thanh
reflect a new policy of
liberalization, in the spirit of
national reconciliation promised
by the Paris peace accord? Or, as
cynics might claim, did her release
parallel that of Truong Dzu,
runner up in the 1967 elections,
just before Thieu visited the US
last April?
If ever there was an auspicious
time for Thieu to defuse the
prisoner issue by a token act of
mercy, it would be now, as the
Senate considers the latest
Foreign Aid Bill.
Amendment
Senator Abourezk has offered
an amendment to the Bill which
will deeply trouble most of
America's free world allies. It
provides simply that "no funds
authorized by this or any other
act will be used to provide
economic or military assistance to
the government of any foreign
country which persecutes by
internment or imprisonment, that
country's citizens for political
purposes." What would this mean
to Thieu, besides the collapse of
South Vietnam's dollar-dependent
economy?
Besides paying 90 percent of
the Saigon Government's costs,
including provision of its vast
arsenal of planes, bombs, and
ammunition, the United States
assumes the cost of running
Thieu's police force and prison
system. For example, two
American construction companies
(Brown & Root and Raymond
International) were awarded a
$400,000 contract from the US
Navy to build a new batch of tiger
cages to house an expanding
prison population; the floor area
is 2 sq. feet smaller than before.
The condition of a group of
prisoners released last March from
such cells was described by Time
Magazine: "It is not really proper
to call them men anymore.
'Shapes' is a better word —
grotesque sculptures of scarred
flesh and gnarled limbs."
The Nixon administration, in
direct violation of the Paris peace
agreement signed by the United
States last January, has budgeted
over $20 million for fiscal year
1974 to increase the efficiency of
Saigon's police and prison system,
a fifty percent increase over last
year. Formerly channeled to the
Thieu government through the
"public safety" program, the aid
will arrive under such headings as
"technical support," "public
administration," and "public
works" — an obvious effort to
fool Congress and bypass the
peace agreement.
Expenditures
As , far as the Senate
Subcommittee on Refugees has
been able to determine, the
Agency for International
Development will spend $869,000
for police computer training
under "technical support"; $1.5
million for a new telecommunica
tions system under "public
works"; $256,000 to train police
officers at the International Police
Academy (remember State of

Siege?); $10.6 million for new
equipment required by Siagon's
expanding police force; $3.3

to Thieu, besides the collapse of
South Vietnam's dollar-dependent
economy?
Besides paying 90 percent of
the Saigon Government's costs,
including provision of its vast
arsenal of planes, bombs, and
ammunition, the United States
assumes the cost of running
Thieu's police force and prison
system. For example, two
American construction companies
(Brown & Root and Raymond
International) were awarded a
$400,000 contract from the US
Navy to build a new batch of tiger
cages to house an expanding
prison population; the floor area
is 2 sq. feet smaller than before.
The condition of a group of
prisoners released last March from
such cells was described by Time
Magazine: "It is not really proper
to call them men anymore.
'Shapes' is a better word —
grotesque sculptures of scarred
flesh and gnarled limbs."
The Nixon administration, in
direct violation of the Paris peace
agreement signed by the United
States last January, has budgeted
over $20 million for fiscal year
1974 to increase the efficiency of
Saigon's police and prison system,
a fifty percent increase over last
year. Formerly channeled to the
Thieu government through the
"public safety" program, the aid
will arrive under such headings as
"technical support," "public
administration," and "public
works" — an obvious effort to
fool Congress and bypass the
peace agreement.
Expenditures
As , far as the Senate
Subcommittee on Refugees has
been able to determine, the
Agency for International
Development will spend $869,000
for police computer training
under "technical support"; $1.5
million for a new telecommunica
tions system under "public
works"; $256,000 to train police
officers at the International Police
Academy (remember State of

Siege?); $10.6 million for new
equipment required by Siagon's
expanding police force; $3.3
million for general support of the
prison system under the
"American Aid Chapter" of the
Vietnamese budget; and $3.8
million for miscellaneous
expenditures.
The United States helps fill the
jails it builds through the
CIA-sponsored Phoenix program,
designed to kill or jail civilians
suspected of helping the Viet
Cong. Thieu has used the program
to eliminate a wide variety of
opponents, including Buddhists,
students, and labor leaders.
Official figures indicate that as of
a year ago 27,000 civilians had
been "neutralized" and another
100,000 taken prisoner.
Summary
Senator Alan Cranston has
summed up the situation: "AID is
continuing to bolster a cruel and
repressive police apparatus in
South Vietnam. A vast
surveillance system is in effect,
aided by US communications
equipment and personnel. Police
torture and inhuman jail
conditions, including the
notorious [US financed] tiger
cages, await those who criticize
the government's policies."
There is one immediate course
of action open to those who
would fight American complicity
with the Thieu dictatorship. Write

your representatives in
Washington immediately, asking
them to support the Abourezk
amendment to the Foreign Aid
Bill, and to cut off all aid to the
Saigon regime.

Last week the press reported
with some fanfare the release of
Mme. Ngo Ba Thanh from a South
Vietnamese jail after two years of
confinement without trial.
Although arrested for her role as
head of the Women's Movement
for the Right to Live (obviously a
subversive organization), the
Thieu government denies that
politics have anything to do with
it. .. there are no 'political
prisoners' in South Vietnam," its
Ambassador states flatly.
"The law in South Vietnam
does not permit the arrest of a
person merely for his opposition
to the policies of the
government." Perhaps the 43-year
old lawyer, once offered a
teaching post at Columbia
University, was arrested under
Article 2 of Decree Law
93/SL/CIT which defines
"incitement of neutralism" as a
crime against the State.
These last two years, Ngo Ba
Thanh came to be a symbol of the
repression in South Vietnam.
Thieu's own denials to the
contrary, Anglican News Service
reports that "The prisoners now
thought to be in custody in South
Vietnam total more than 240,000
and include students, adults, and a
number of clergy."
This estimate is shared by the
American Friends Service

Committee, former South
Vietnamese government officials,
Amnesty International, and by
such independent experts as Don
Luce of International Volunteer
Services and Joseph Buttinger.
Most of these prisoners are the
"third force" neutralists;
communists who are captured
tend to die after interrogation
sessions.
Prison Conditions
Although the International
Red Cross has been denied access
to South Vietnam's prisons,
reports of conditions inside do
leak out. As one American
Bishop, returned from South
Vietnam, reported recently, "I
can state unequivocally that there
are political prisoners in Saigon's
jails and in jails throughout the
provinces.... There can be
absolutely no doubt about this.
And it is clear that these prisoners
are subject to inhuman treatment,
including deliberate and
prolonged torture."
The testimony of former
prisoners, including two
Frenchmen recently released after
international protest, confirms
this judgement with grisly detail.
So do the reports of two
American Congressmen who
visited the infamous "tiger cages"
on Con Son island, where
thousands of prisoners are starved,

paralyzed from the cramped
conditions, and burned and
blinded by the lye poured on
them at frequent intervals.
Did the Thieu Government's
release of Mme. Ngo Ba Thanh
reflect a new policy of
liberalization, in the spirit of
national reconciliation promised
by the Paris peace accord? Or, as
cynics might claim, did her release
parallel that of Truong Dzu,
runner up in the 1967 elections,
just before Thieu visited the US
last April?
If ever there was an auspicious
time for Thieu to defuse the
prisoner issue by a token act of
mercy, it would be now, as the
Senate considers the latest
Foreign Aid Bill.
Amendment
Senator Abourezk has offered
an amendment to the Bill which
will deeply trouble most of
America's free world allies. It
provides simply that "no funds
authorized by this or any other
act will be used to provide
economic or military assistance to
the government of any foreign
country which persecutes by
internment or imprisonment, that
country's citizens for political
purposes." What would this mean
to Thieu, besides the collapse of
South Vietnam's dollar-dependent
economy?

the Saigon Government's costs,
including provision of its vast
arsenal of planes, bombs, and
ammunition, the United States
