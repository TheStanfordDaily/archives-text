# Chile Is Burning
## 
### 
Pablo Nerudo (1904-1973) We, Allende (9-13-73)
What can we say The world is silent
Pablo, you with though the fires burn
the sound of justice, your northern neighbors'
you with the cry denials die on the flame
of love, Allende, Allende, we hear,
Chile is burning /s gone, Chile is back
our world is cold, where it belongs,
Where is your voice - Long Live / T and T,
Pablo, one word, hail to the rodents!
another poem; the centuries stir,
for every hyena we are the people,
exposed we are the power,
a hundred free people we are the flame
in our midst
Pablo, speak again — By Jon Eckels
