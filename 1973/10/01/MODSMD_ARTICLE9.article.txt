Now that you are settled
in your classes, with your
friends, and into whatever
degree of routine you pursue,
you might have time to share
with the rest of the university
community aspects of the
campus and the world at large
which annoy, destroy or
delight you.
Bring your columns,
letters, commentaries and
cartoons to the Daily
editorial offices at Panama
and Lomita Streets to the
opinions editor (ext. 4632,
4633).
