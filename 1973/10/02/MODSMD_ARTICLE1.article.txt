# Time May Be Problem
## Agnew Probe Speeds Up 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Federal
prosecutors are racing the calendar to
wind up their probe of Spiro T. Agnew
before statutes of limitations run out
on alleged crimes for which the vice
president is being investigated.
Legal arguments may be made that
the statutes on at least some of the
alleged crimes expire in as little as
three weeks, it was learned yesterday.
Agnew is under investigation by a
special federal grand jury in Baltimore
for possible violation of bribery,
extortion, tax and conspiracy laws
while governor of Maryland.
Under federal law, prosecution for
bribery and extortion must be
initiated within five years of the
commission of the crime. After five
years, no legal action can be taken.
The statutes of limitations on tax
evasion and tax fraud are six years.
The statutes on conspiracy to
commit bribery or extortion are five
years; on conspiracy to commit tax
evasion or fraud, six years.
On Oct. 22, 1968, the Maryland
State Board of Public Works held its
last major session before Agnew left
the office of governor. At that session,
seven major engineering contracts were
awarded totalling more than $5.6
million.
These contracts involved
construction of approaches to the
Chesapeake Bay Bridge and the
Baltimore Outer Harbor Tunnel, the
two major projects to be financed out
of a $220 million bond issue.
All records involving these
contracts have been subpoenaed by
the Baltimore grand jury.
Should the panel wish to indict
Agnew for extortion, bribery or
conspiracy to commit either of those
crimes in connection with the Oct. 22,
1968 awards, Agnew's lawyers
reportedly are considering an
argument that the indictment cannot
be returned after Oct. 22, 1973— five
years after the meeting, sources close
to the case reported.
By that reasoning, however, the
prosecutors should have until Oct. 22
of next year to pursue allegations of
violation of tax laws, the sources said.
It is known that the prosecutors in
Baltimore are moving as quickly as
possible to present evidence to the

grand jury.
Crucial to that effort was the ruling
last week by U.S. Dist. Court Judge
Walter E. Hoffman that the grand jury
investigation may continue while
Agnew's lawyers and the Justice
Department battle in court over the
grand jury's constitutional right to
investigate a sitting vice president.
In the meantime, Agnew was to
return here late yesterday afternoon
from a weekend on the West Coast
during which he made the strongest

statement in his personal defense since
he disclosed Aug. 6 that he was under
investigation.
Agnew also attacked Asst. Atty.
Gen. Henry E. Petersen as the source
of a controversial news leak about the
investigation. Yesterday, the White
House said Atty. Gen. Elliot L.
Richardson had assured President
Nixon that Petersen was not the
source of the CBS news report Sept.
22.

years, no legal action can be taken.
The statutes of limitations on tax
evasion and tax fraud are six years.
The statutes on conspiracy to
commit bribery or extortion are five
years; on conspiracy to commit tax
evasion or fraud, six years.
On Oct. 22, 1968, the Maryland
State Board of Public Works held its
last major session before Agnew left
the office of governor. At that session,
seven major engineering contracts were
awarded totalling more than $5.6
million.
These contracts involved
construction of approaches to the
Chesapeake Bay Bridge and the
Baltimore Outer Harbor Tunnel, the
two major projects to be financed out
of a $220 million bond issue.
All records involving these
contracts have been subpoenaed by
the Baltimore grand jury.
Should the panel wish to indict
Agnew for extortion, bribery or
conspiracy to commit either of those
crimes in connection with the Oct. 22,
1968 awards, Agnew's lawyers
reportedly are considering an
argument that the indictment cannot
be returned after Oct. 22, 1973— five
years after the meeting, sources close
to the case reported.
By that reasoning, however, the
prosecutors should have until Oct. 22
of next year to pursue allegations of
violation of tax laws, the sources said.
It is known that the prosecutors in
Baltimore are moving as quickly as
possible to present evidence to the

grand jury.
Crucial to that effort was the ruling
last week by U.S. Dist. Court Judge
Walter E. Hoffman that the grand jury
investigation may continue while
Agnew's lawyers and the Justice
Department battle in court over the
grand jury's constitutional right to
investigate a sitting vice president.
In the meantime, Agnew was to
return here late yesterday afternoon
from a weekend on the West Coast
during which he made the strongest

statement in his personal defense since
he disclosed Aug. 6 that he was under
investigation.
Agnew also attacked Asst. Atty.
Gen. Henry E. Petersen as the source
of a controversial news leak about the
investigation. Yesterday, the White
House said Atty. Gen. Elliot L.
Richardson had assured President
Nixon that Petersen was not the
source of the CBS news report Sept.
22.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Federal
prosecutors are racing the calendar to
wind up their probe of Spiro T. Agnew
before statutes of limitations run out
on alleged crimes for which the vice
president is being investigated.
Legal arguments may be made that
the statutes on at least some of the
alleged crimes expire in as little as
three weeks, it was learned yesterday.
Agnew is under investigation by a
special federal grand jury in Baltimore
for possible violation of bribery,
extortion, tax and conspiracy laws
while governor of Maryland.
Under federal law, prosecution for
bribery and extortion must be
initiated within five years of the
commission of the crime. After five
years, no legal action can be taken.
The statutes of limitations on tax
evasion and tax fraud are six years.
The statutes on conspiracy to
commit bribery or extortion are five
