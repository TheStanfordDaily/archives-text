# What is your stand?
## Speculation About 'The Ratio' 
###

It is time certain topics were brought out into
the light.
It is time certain conversations were taken out of
the closets and from their late night time slots and
subjected to the harsh glare of newsprint.
It is time we talked about The Ratio.
Yes, The Ratio. Surely on a campus where Plato
and Skinner are bandied, where Hannawalt and
Sokolove teach, where pianos but not television sets
abound in dorms, and where the course review is
published, even The Ratio can be calmly discussed.
Admittedly, even the mention of The Ratio calls
forth a whole series of deeply felt emotional
reactions. It is generally a subject on which people
have already taken a stand. And, most regrettably,
opinion seems to fall fairly predictably into two
clumps; men and women.
Thus any discussion of The Ratio is likely to find
itself in immediate deep water, with smoking,
half-built bridges all around.
Considerations â€¢
Let us then consider the issue.
Consider the male Stanford freshman.
Alas.
The Stanford freshman comes to school with the
fond hope that at least half of his mother's fears
concerning co-ed dorms will be realized. What he
finds, generally, is social bewilderment and the fully
articulated theory of The Ratio.
Reluctant to part with his visions of a better
world the freshman clings tenaciously to his ideal of
a social rennaissance. The length of clingation
depends on a range of personality and social factors
as well as upon the occasional encouragement of
circumstance.
Stanford Parties
The freshman male discovers Stanford parties
early in his undergraduate experience. Many
observers have drawn analogies between Stanford
parties and track meets but I shall spare you any
more than passing reference to this metaphor.
Suffice to say the impression most males carry
away from these social extravaganzas is of a
frightening, overwhelming male mob hovering at the
edge of the dance floor in various stages of
intoxication. Even this does not produce immediate
disillusionment. After all, most of these prodigies
occupied the social peak (at least among the honors
students) in High School and are not ready to
entertain the notion that not only is the pool bigger,
but they are distinctly smaller fish.
Thus it is possible for the freshman to maintain
an uneasy belief in his discoverability, for a time.
This is not to say that all freshmen remain
undiscovered. Occasionally an in-dorm relationship
will light the sky for miles around. The participants
in such a meeting of souls spark optimism and envy
at dinner tables throughout the dorms.
Seeds of Doubt
Eventually, however, as parties proceed in their
familiar pattern and people begin filtering off to the

library on Saturday nights seeds of doubt begin to
flourish. It is at this point the freshmen become
vulnerable to the ideology of The Ratio.
The trend is continued, and often accelerated in
the Sophomore year. The most sobering realization
of the Sophomore year is that the problem last year
wasn't being a freshman. Indeed, once out of the
freshman dorm the unattached male is denied even
the comfort of a whole dorm full of other
unattached males desperate for something to do.
Sophomores can often still be found at dorm
parties, but a subtle alteration of attitude has taken
place. There is now the faintly cynical, slightly
superior air of the observer, or the columnist, about
these silent sophomores. They tend to make more
comments about people who are dancing and fewer
efforts to dance.
Prime Year
This is the prime year of susceptibility to the
tenents of The Ratio. Simply stated, The Ratio is a
means of absolving the male from any blame for his
social failures and placing it somewhere in the safely
anonymous admissions office. The average Stanford
male (i.e. one without a girlfriend) believes there are
too many other males in this immediate area, that is
to say too few females.
To supplement this purely statistical view of the
social horizons many males also subscribe to the
Stanford Girl Theory. As we stray from such hard
and fast data as admission figures information
becomes irretrievably subjective.
Stated carefully, The Stanford Girl Theory
postulates that due to the glut of males on the
market females can be picky, they need not settle
for the dictates of circumstance. This in turn leads
to a caginess on the female part, a tendancy to drive
a hard bargain. Some males, in their more bitter
moments, go so far as implying that Stanford girls
are more interested in careers than romance. This
seems to be letting more of the chauvinist cat out of
generally disguised bag than is altogether safe.
Ending The Cycle
To finish the cycle, in the Junior and Senior
years the Ratio either becomes doctrine, is
discredited and forgotten when one becomes
discovered, or becomes unimportant as one becomes
an undiluted intellect.
The essential question before us is still, how valid
is the theory? Hidden within the basic tenents of
The Ratio is a terrible dilemma which must be faced
by any believer. If one does not accept The Ratioas
gospel he is forced to blame himself for all and
sundry unhappiness. If one accepts The Ratio he is
condemned to explainable, but inevitable despair.
You see, dear reader, if failure is blamed on
circumstances beyond our meager control then even
avoiding failure becomes beyond us.
Thus The Ratio involves a very basic decision: to
be miserable but secure, or miserable with potentials
for happiness.
