# Reagan Supports Agnew Defense

### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Gov. Ronald Reagan
expressed support yesterday for Spiro Agnew in the
vice president's fiery counterattack against charges
of his involvement with corruption in Maryland and
leaks about the investigation.
"After his speech last week, I don't see how
anyone can doubt the man," Reagan told the 66th
annual convention of the Independent Insurance
Agents Association of California.
Reagan reaffirmed his belief in President Nixon's
innocence in the Watergate affair and raked those
"stupid and illegal acts" of a "little band of men."
"There are politically motivated vigilantes who
are trying to torpedo the things we voted for in
1972, including reduction of the bureaucracy on the
banks of the Potomac," he told his applauding
audience of 600 insurance agents.
He added that those implicated in Watergate have
been apprehended and "pretty much those people
who were responsible have been tagged."
Reagan, a potential contender for the Republican

Presidential nomination in 1976, refused to discuss
aspirations for higher office. But he outlined plans
for speaking engagements across the nation after he
leaves the governor chair next year.
"I have already said I am going to hit the sawdust
trail nationwide to rebut economic and political
mythologies," he said, referring to what he called
"liberal economic theories" of government
spending.
He also said he would work against the bill
before Congress for national land use planning.
"I'm going to work against that horrendous land
use plan that would take away the meaning of
ownership of property in this country," he said.
Reagan said his tax reduction initiative,
Proposition 1, the main topic of his convention
remarks, could be applied to federal spending and
taxes.
"You bet it can work at the national level, and it
should have been working there for many years
past," he said.
