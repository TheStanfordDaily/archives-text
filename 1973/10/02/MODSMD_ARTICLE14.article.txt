# Undergrade Would Benefit
## Lyman Wants More Student Aid 
### 
President Richard W. Lyman
yesterday welcomed
recommendations from the
Committee for Economic
Development (CED) calling for
increased federal and state
support of undergraduate students
through grants and loans.
This is "the most safe and

flexible way for the government
to support higher education,"
Lyman declared.
The CED report, released
yesterday, said tuition changes at
many colleges and universities are
"unjustifiably low." It
recommended increasing these to
approximately 50 percent of

instructional costs within five
years â€” or within a decade at
community colleges.
Lyman said he valued the
committee's recognition of the
problem facing private institutions
because of the "growing gap" in
tuition with public institutions.
He was not terribly concerned
with how the gap is narrowed and
said "it should not be completed
closed." But private institutions
"cannot sit back and watch the
gap continually widen indefinitely
(because) eventually we'll find
ourselves unable to compete."
Stanford's tuition, now $3135,
"more than meets the CED
recommendations," he added. The
University "isn't immune to
inflation" and tuition increases of
six to eight percent may be
necessary.
Lyman strongly endorsed the
CED recommendation that
existing tax incentives for
voluntary support of higher
education "be maintained and, to
the extent not incompatible with
other objectives, expanded in
order to strengthen the base of
financial support of all colleges
and universities."
The CED study was conducted
by a subcommittee headed by

W.D. Eberle, a Stanford trustee
and President Nixon's special
representative for trade
negotiations. Former Stanford
Trustee Charles E. Ducommun
also served on the 38-member
group.
In making several
recommendations for
strengthening the management of
higher education, Lyman said the
CED is "preaching what we've
been trying to practice," with
appropriate distinctions between
business and educational
institutions.
On the other hand, he said a
CED recommendation that
colleges divide their available
faculty positions about 50-50
between tenure and contract
(nontenure) positions would be
"unrealistic," if applied across the
board.
This, he charged, could conflict
with another stated goal in the
CED report, that "external
agencies and system governing
boards not raise obstacles to
diversity among institutions of
higher education but rather
establish policies and practices
that will preserve and cultivate
diversity."
