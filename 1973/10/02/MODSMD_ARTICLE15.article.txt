# A 						Steaming Night In 'Sleazy City'
## Bette Midler's Unique Talent Stuns Berkeley Audience 
### TERRY ANZUR 
B ERKELEY—From the
moment she burst onto the
Community Theater stage
Saturday night Bette Midler
captured her audience with a
dynamic electricity, establishing a
rapport that brought the sellout
crowd dancing into the aisles and
demanding more from the Divine
Miss M in a wild ovation that
lasted long after she had left the
stage.
Midler specializes in a genre of
music and stage antics which she
describes as "good old American
garbage." She combines camp,
comedy, and sexuality, with
dynamite stage presence and sheer
vocal talent. She holds an
audience in the palm of her hand
(and various other prominent
parts of her anatomy), and loves
every minute of it.
Saturday's 8 p.m. concert
started promptly at 8:30, but the
delay only heightened the current
of anticipation in the audience to
a frenzy of lethal voltage. Also, it
afforded some of Midler's more
picturesque fans an additional half
hour to parade around the lobby
and down the aisles in their
finery.
Costumes included fox
furpieces, tie-dye frocks, bare

midriffs, pearl earrings, sheer
black net blouses, and
rh in est one-studded platform
bootheels — and that was only the
fellas. Vamps, flappers, and
assorted drag queens sported sleek
long dresses, elaborate eye
make-up, and the hairstyles of the
20s, 30s, and 40s, topped with
sequined pillbox hats or garnished
with gaudy artificial flowers.
Sideshow Stifled
But the sideshow ended
abruptly when Midler's 11-man
band took its place on stage. The
houselights dimmed. The Harlets
— three backup vocalists who are
later introduced as "the girls you
love to grope "--suddenly strike a
seductive pose in the leftstage
spotlight, clad in vampy halter
tops and dark skirts slit to the
waistband.
The Divine Miss M appears in a
flurry of hot pink ostrich feathers,
wearing black trousers and a
low-slung striped blouse that
leaves little to the imagination. As
she launches into "Friends," one
is tempted to give odds on who
will collapse from exhaustion first
— Midler or her wildly
enthusiastic audience.
And Midler has no intention of
slowing the pace, displaying her
versatility in a knockout version

of Helen Reddy's hit "Delta
Dawn." She begins the song
quietly, without instrumental
backup, building the effect by
alternately delivering the
honneyed tones of a wide-eyed
ingenue and the grinding growl of
a sleazy burlesque singer.
Steaming In Berkeley
Between numbers, Midler
pauses to gulp liquid refreshment
from paper cups concealed inside
the grand piano. "It's steaming
tonight in Berkeley," she jokes,
referring to the intensity of the
crowd's reactions as well as to the
heat onstage that was fierce
enough to melt her makeup.
If Midler wasn't such a
dynamic songstress and gutsy
stage performer, she could
probably make it as a distaff Don
Rickles. She plays with her
audience, flinging sarcastic insults
at the balcony crowd as well as
the front-row fans.
Most of her verbal torpedoes
score direct hits, as she ridicules
the "organic" lifestyle of
Berkeleyites, and chides the
audience . for laughing
schoolboyishly at
bedroom/bathroom humor.
"You're so cheap," she declares.
"I know all the words, so I'll just
say them one by one and you can

laugh to your heart's
content.. . Poppers, anyone?"
Sweaty Artwork
She asks hard-core fans in
orchestra seats why they wanted
to sit close enough to see her
sweating from every pore: "The
Divine Miss M is such a work of
art you have to be 500 yards away
to appreciate it."
Midler ridicules herself, as well
as the audience. She introduced a
"Filthydelphia Medley" as "one
of our most tasteless medleys —
it's tenament music that reeks of
American Bandstandßefore
belting out "In The Mood" she
explained that the tune was pure
Hubba Hubba — a popular
phrase of the 40s meaning hot
shit." On this number, the Harlets
mimicked various musical
instruments in a fine vocal
backup. "We busted our buns on
this number," Midler exclaimed.
If she was referring to the frenzy
in which she and her "girls"
cavorted about the stage, they
bust much more than their buns.
After a brief intermission Barry
Manilow, Midler's talented
pianist-arranger, sang three tunes
from his recently-released album,
with a little help from the Harlets.
He was politely received, as most
of the audience was busily

wondering what Midler could
possibly do in the second half of
the program to outstrip the
beautiful crassness of the first
half.
And they weren't
disappointed. The Harlets
reappeared in "Howard
Johnson's-in-drag" waitress garb,
singing a falsetto ditty from The
Wizard of Oz. That set the stage
for Midler's entrance, and she
shimmered onstage in a pink
sequined starlet gown, slit to the
navel from both directions. She
flaunted a fox pelt and a
rainbow-colored boa as she sang
"Lullaby of Broadway."
"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy"
the old Andrew's Sisters hit,
allowed Midler and the "girls" to
prance about in well
choreographed hysteria. Midler

remained in perpetual motion
throughout several encores of the
tune.
Brash, Braless Talent
The uninhibited gyrations of
Midler's braless breasts provided
the main attraction for some
members of the audience. But a
more "real" element of the Divine
Miss M shone from beneath the
hard crust of comic camp and
crass sexuality.
She delivered "Superstar" with
a breathless agony and depth
absent in Karen Carpenter's
bubble-gum version of the tune.
In "Am I Blue" she brought all the
exquisite loneliness of the Ethel
Waters torch song to life with
pure, low notes that spread over
the audience like softened butter.
She literally ruined the crowd

with "I Shall Be Released."
"I came here to give you a
giggle and maybe a tear now and
then," Midler said, and as she
vocalized the utter loneliness of
old age in "Hello In There," more
than a few eyes were moistened.
The 'Real' Miss M
It is too easy to pass over Bette
Midler as a phenomenon of the
current camp-nostalgia craze, as
she and the Harlets strip down to
their slips to render "Leader of
the Pack" in "more than its
entirety." But only a very real,
very talented individual beneath
the frizzled red hair and sequins
could generate the static
excitement that brought the
crowd into the aisles for a
10-minute standing ovation on
Saturday night.
