# Rare Earth's Hits Provide Entertainment For 'Boppers'
## 
### ROD KOON 
OAKLAND —Rare Earth was
definitely the star attraction at
Friday night's rock concert at the
Oakland Coliseum, considering
the quality of the other acts on
the program, that's not too
surprising. The entire concert
lasted about three hours: it
seemed to drag on much longer.
The problem started with the
first group — the Funkadelics.
Their song lyrics, wnen they could
be ungarbled, were at the same
low level as the songs themselves.
One of their songs, "I Call My
Baby Pussy," would probably be
X-rated if it was a film.
For "The Cosmic Slop," they
wanted the audience to join in
clapping. But few people were
listening. Many were at the
concession stand buying hot dogs.
And the hot dogs were very good,
especially when compared to the
Funkadelics.
Ready For Anything
Although the Coliseum was
nearly three fourths empty, the
sparse crowd did begin to come to
life when Buddy Miles appeared,

and yelled, "Are you ready for
some good rock and roll?!" After
suffering through the Funkedelics,
the crowd was ready for anything.
Miles did manage to pour forth
some good rock and roll from his
TTirone of Drums, but none of it
was really noteworthy. His entire
set was hampered by a bad sound
system which made him sound
like Muddy Miles.
The crowd kept yelling
between songs for "Changes,"
until Miles, a tired performer a
little upset with the impatient
mob, oaid, "Yeah, yeah, we'll get
to that." When he finally did play
"Them Changes" as his final song,
the crowd loved it.
More "Changes" Needed
It was by far the best song he
played that night. But for Miles, it
has been a long time since that
song was big, and a little of the
lustre from the past is gone.
As the night wore on, the
substantial portion of a
teenybopper crowd roamed
through the Coliseum, impressing
the world by chewing gum and
smoking cigarettes at the same

time. Not until Rare Earth finally
appeared did the boppers really
get excited about the music.
Rare Earth started right out
with one of their most recent big
hits, "Big Brother," (a LSJUMB
trademark) which well exemplifies
the group's unique sound. But the
originality of the sound was lost
as they ploughed through some of
their other hits, such as "(I Know)
I'm Losing You," and"I Just
Want to Celebrate."
This was partially due to the
fact that many songs were much
too long, as the lead guitarist tried
to wah-wah his way into
everybody's heart. During
instrumental sections of some of
their songs it got to the point
where you weren't sure if you
were listening to "I Just Want to
Celebrate" or "(I Know) I'm
Losing You." If they had played
shorter, tighter versions of their
songs, everyone would have been
better off.
Rare Earth did receive a
standing ovation though, perhaps
because they sounded so good in
comparison to previous acts. For
their encore they performed their
first really big hit "Get Ready."
After that, the lights in the
Coliseum came on, and the crowd
left for home — a little happier, a
little disappointed, but mostly
tired.
