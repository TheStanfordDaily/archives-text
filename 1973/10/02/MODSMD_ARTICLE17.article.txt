# Rolling Stones Release Weak Album

THE ROLLING STONES:
Goat's Head Soup
Rolling Stone LOCS9WI 0598
The new Rolling Stones album,
Goat's Head Soup, finally has
been released. It was recorded
over six months ago in Jamaica,
and it is obvious why they were so
hesitant to release it; this is one of
the weakest albums the Stones
have ever recorded.

Don't get me wrong, Goat's
Head Soup is a good album. It's
just that one expects so much
more from the Stones, and
regrettably this record won't
make many people's 'Best of the
Year' list.
The album opens with
"Dancing with Mr. D." which, as
Creem Magazine puts it, "stands
for exactly what you hope it
doesn't."

On this cut many problems
which plague the entire album
become apparent. The sound
quality is poor.
Mick Jagger's vocal is buried,
the general sound is muddled, the
instruments are indistinct.
Because it is a slow, mysterious,
voodoo-like song that tries to
evoke the image of a graveyard, it
stands in great contrast to
previous Stones album openers,

which traditionally have been
non-stop rockers ("Brown Sugar,"
for example).
If you don't like "Angie"
you'll hate "Going Down," a slow
number which drones on and on
and clocks in at a far-too-long six
minutes. After this "Doo Doo
Doo (Heartbreaker)" sounds
especially good. It's one of the
highlights of the record. Billy
Preston is featured on clavicle and
also arranged the song. This
arrangement is the best on the
albrum.
"Angie," which closes side one,
has already caused much
controversy among Stones fans.
With its strings and whisperings it
is certainly the most
middle-of-the-road song they've
ever done (you might even
wonder if this is the same group
that did "Satisfaction").
But this reviewer thinks
"Angie" is also the most beautiful
song the Rolling Stones have ever
recorded and is the record's most
memorable track.
"Silver Train" which opens
side two, is the closest thing on the
album to a full-blown rocker. It's
a good song but the sound is
cluttered and the arrangement is
poor.
You may recognize this tune,
as Johnny Winter did it on his
Still Alive and Well album a few
months back. Winter's version is
far better, which says a lot about
this album.
"Can You Hear the Music?"
may be the Stone's attempt at
reggae. It's nice to see them trying
new things, even if they don't

quite come off.
You'll hear a lot about "Star
Star," because it has a very
naughty word in it, though
Jagger's vocal is so indistinct you
may have trouble picking it out.
The rest of the songs are
generally mid-tempo and quite
nice, if not always too
memorable. On keyboards, Nicky
Hopkins' eloquent piano is
featured on about half the cuts,
generally the slower ones like
"Angie." Billy Preston is featured
on the quicker-paced cuts.
The Stones were on TV
Saturday night doing three songs
from Goat's Head Soup. Both
Jagger and Keith Richards, looked
a bit like zombies, but they
sounded great. In fact the songs
sounded much better live. The
broadcast reinstilled this
reviewer's faith in the Stones.
After a taste of Goat's Head
Soup it is possible to detect a
decline in the overall quality of
the Stones performance. But even
the worst of the Stones is better
than the best of most rock bands
and after awhile even Goat's Head
Soup becomes quite appetizing.

STONE 'ZOMBlE'—Guitarist Keith Richards may have looked like a
zombie in the Rolling Stones' TV appearance last Saturday night, but
the group continues to hold onto its spot at the top of the rock-pile
However, the Stones' new album, "Goat's Head Soup," may leave a
bad taste in the mouths of more than a few Rolling Stones fans.
