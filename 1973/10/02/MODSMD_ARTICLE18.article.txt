# Friday Night At Homer's
## Blues Keeps Crowd Jumping 
### BRADLEY DICKINSON 
Authentic blues from two great
performers kept an enthusiastic
crowd jumping until the early
morning on Friday night at
Homer's Warehouse.
The music of Sonny Terry and
Brownie McGhee spans the range
of what might be called
folk-country-blues, from songs
like "Rock Island Line" to
"Walking My Blues Away."
The first set was dominated by
Terry's harp and voice. Terry has
performed with such all-time
greats as Woody Guthrie and
Leadbelly, and he certainly hasn't
forgotten any of his tricks.
Terry's technique is a bit
unorthodox; he holds his harp
upside down, with low notes on
the right, and he uses his left hand
for cupping and for a fantastic

hand show during solo runs.
He is also a blues shouter of
the first magnitude. Starting in
with "Roll Me Baby" and
progressing through such classics
as "My Baby Chained the Lock on
the Door," he built up a great
rapport with the audience.
Towards the end of their first
set and throughout the second set,
the talent of Brownie McGhee
came to the fore. Playing an
electrified acoutstic guitar,
McGhee sometimes plays with the
force of four, combining intricate
runs with steady driving rhythms.
McGhee's deep and mellow
voice is the perfect complement
to Terry's. His rendition of "C.C.
Rider" and "Ballin' the Jack"
were particularly likeable.
Both Terry and McGhee can
provide the plaintive and melodic

backups that are absolutely
essential for small-group blues
work. It is this rare combination
of two talents that makes their
version of blues classics like "Key
to the Highway" outstanding and
memorable.
Second on the bill Friday night
was John Buckley, a former Palo
Alt an who was having a
homecoming of sorts. An intense
balladeer, Buckley was a bit
bothered by an inattentive
audience of blues fans, but he did
a creditable job with some fine
original material.
Blue grass fans will be interested
in the schedule at Homer's this
week which includes Old and In
the Way, with Jerry Garcia, on
Wednesday, and the Phantoms of
the Opry on Saturday.
Keep in mind that you'll
probably have to sit on a dirty
warehouse floor when you decide
what to wear.
