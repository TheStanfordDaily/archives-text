# Pointless Plot Exploits Burt Reynolds' Body
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
If nothing else, Burt Reynold's
latest film puts an end to an old
scientific question; lightning does
strike twice in the same place —
and in this case it's Burt Reynolds
who is getting burned.
The main problem with White
Lightning is a wandering,
sometimes pointless plot. A poor
plot sabotaged The Man Who
Loved Cat Dancing, Reynold's last
release, but at least those who
went to gawk at Reynold's
physique (clothed and unclothed)
saw enough in that flick to feel
they got their money's worth.
Even that's not true in White
Lightning.
The film casts "dirty Burtie" as
a gum-chomping, twice-convicted
Arkansas moonshine runner
named Gator McClusky whose
brother has been murdered by
Sheriff J.C. Connors, played by
Ned Beatty.
Gator's brother, the only one
in the family ever to go to college,
leads an anti-war protest march
through the sheriffs county,so
Connors drowns him to restore
law and order to the county.
Seems the sheriff don't rightly
cotton to no "damn long-haired
hippies" causin' trouble in his
parish.
Gator, serving time for hauling
bootleg liquor, turns state's
evidence to nail Connors, who the
Feds suspect is milking the liquor
business for all the kickbacks he
can get. Next, Gator gets a
souped-up Ford Galaxy and is set
free to play stool pigeon.

Several high-speed car chases
later, he ends up out-maneuvering
Connors, who drives his car into a
lake and drowns, ironically, like
the younger McUlusky.
Well, so much for the plot. The
acting is good, though. Arkansas
redneck images are especially well
portrayed by R.G. Armstrong, a
bootleg bottler; Bo Hopkins,
another "white lightning" runner;
and Louise Latham, the sheriffs
secretary.
Ned Beatty does not match his
fine performance in Deliverance
(another film featuring Reynolds)
with an equally credible
characterization in this film.
Most of Reynold's acting,
however, consists of him twirling
around his Ford's steering wheel
while laughing and making faces
to make the car chases seem more
interesting. After a while, even
they get dull — a monotony of
fast cars screeching around slow
curves. And there's not much else
to the film.
Reynolds can act well. Even
when he played a half-breed
blacksmith in television's
Gunsmoke (a relatively minor
part), he was worth watching.
But Burt's last two films have
failed to do him justice as an
actor. He comes off as a celluloid
image, only a bit more human
than his Cosmopolitan fold-out.
What White Lightning lacks is
direction, purpose, theme and
plot. What Burt Reynolds lacks is
a good script that showcases his
acting talent, not his body.
