# Campus Housing Pinch Causes Some Crowding
## 
### BILL ROSS 
Overcrowding in University
dormitories is a problem, despite the
fact that few student names still
appear on housing office waiting lists,
according to Larry Horton, associate
dean of student affairs.
"While there is no crisis, we do have
a problem of considerable magnitude,"
Horton said. "Although only a few
undergraduates are still actively
seeking immediate housing, I suspect
that many students who have found
accommodations off campus and have
removed their names from waiting lists
would much prefer to live at
Stanford."
Horton said many students who
have obtained temporary housing off
campus have already signed waiting
lists for the winter quarter.
Only 20 undergraduates and 30
graduate students, all men, are now
actively pursuing University housing
assignments, according to Susan
Espinosa, superintendent of the
housing office.
At the start of September, more
than 500 names appeared on the
waiting list, she said. While many have
been placed, some merely failed to
reapply for University housing after
the Sept. 25 expiration of the original
waiting list, Espinosa said.
Transfers Difficult
The placement of transfer students
was an especially difficult procedure,

according to Espinosa. Approximately
350 transfer students entered Stanford
this autumn, she said. Of these, about
three/fourths requested University
housing and approximately 80 of
those who requested Stanford housing
were offered places, Espinosa said.
"Some transfer students were
placed in unfilled rooms which were
assigned to continuing students in the
housing draw last spring," Espinosa
said. "Some continuing students
accepted assignments but didn't show
up to take them while other students
withdrew from the University. Losing
the $50 deposit did not seem to
bother them."
Another reason for the successful
placement of transfer students was the
practice of doubling and quadding,
Espinosa said. Single rooms were
converted into double rooms in
Lagunita and suites in Roble and
Branner that were formerly occupied
by three students were assigned to
four students," she said.
"This practice has deleterious social
consequences," Horton said.
"Crowoing tends to make students
irritable, and it certainly is not
conducive to study. It also deprives
people of their right to a modest
amount of privacy."
Financial Help
Students who have been forced to
live in crowded rooms are given
financial compensation, Espionsa said.

In Lagunita, for example, students
occupying double rooms designed for
single occupancy have had their rents
reduced 25 percent, from $214 to
$160, she commented.
Horton said that he has
encountered more on-campus housing
problems this autumn than at any time
in his four years at the housing office.
"We do not pretend to know the
reasons for the problem," Horton said.
"But we are studying the dilemma and
hope to have data available soon."
Part of the problem is the increased
demand for University housing,
Horton said.
"Students are finding that it is
pleasant to live with their peers," he
noted. "There is little advantage to
living off campus. The pulse of the
University is felt in the residences.
"Students sometimes tell me it is
hard to meet people in class or at
Tresidder. Stanford is a residence
University," he pointed out.
New Report
The housing office and the
provost's office are now compiling a
joint report on the housing situation,
said Horton. The report will comment
on the possibility of constructing new
housing on campus.
Horton said that a special effort
was made this year to accommodate
transfer students. Although transfer
students in the past have been given
low priority in housing assignments,
they were favored in relation to
continuing students this year, he said.
Most of the students who are still
waiting for housing have had their
requests delayed because they have
been unwilling to accept certain types
of housing, especially double rooms,
Espinosa said.
Thankful
At Lagunita, where there are 388
students living in a complex designed
for 296 residents, many students are
glad to have found any housing at all,
according to Bernadette Benjamin,
administrative assistant for Lagunita.
Transfer students were given special
preference in room allocations, with
60 places being set aside for them as
compared to a previous average of six
places, she said.
