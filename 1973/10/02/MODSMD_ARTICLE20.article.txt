Meir Appeals To Austria
VIENNA, Austria — Premier Golda Meir of Israel
prepared yesterday to visit here in a personal appeal
for reversal of Austria's pledge to close down a
transit camp for emigrating Soviet Jews.
Chancellor Bruno Kreisky said he would explain
the Austrian stand — "which she seems not to know
exactly." But he gave no indication he would
change his mind because of Meir's plans for the
unusual appeal.
The 75-year-old Israeli leader declared in a
speech to the parliamentary assembly of the Council
of Europe in Strasbourg, France, that the Austrian
decision represented "a great victory" for
Palestinian terrorism and must be changed.
Informants in Strasbourg, where Meir is spending
two days at the assembly, said she will travel here
this moming in an effort to use her persuasive
powers on Kreisky.
But Kreisky reaffirmed that the pledge was
necessary and said it was "improbable" that he
would go back on it.
"Threatened human lives have to be saved first,"
he said. "Only then come the others."
Kreisky, himself a Jew, made the pledge after
two Palestinian guerrillas kidnaped an Austrian
border guard Friday along with three Soviet Jews on
the way to Israel. The four hostages were freed
unharmed after the Austrian leader gave his word.
Kreisky subsequently said emigrating Soviet Jews
will still get individual Austrian transit visas, but the
transit facility at Schoenau Castle 70 miles south of
Vienna will have to halt operations.
The facility, operated by the Jewish Agency, has
been handling about 2650 Soviet Jews a month
since Moscow relaxed immigration restrictions two
years ago.
Jewish Agency representatives in Vienna said
emigrating Jews were still arriving from the Soviet
Union at the regular rate of 40-120 a day. They
claimed they had no plans to shut down the camp.
Gas Price Pressure Continues
LAS VEGAS — Relaxed Phase 4 controls already
have increased the cost of gasoline for motorists in
many areas, but rising wholesale prices may quickly
generate pressure for a new round of retail hikes.
Independent operators of branded service
stations in nine states met over the weekend here
and called for an indefinite, nationwide shutdown
of 200,000 stations until all retail price controls are
lifted.
In Southern California, two dealers' associations
said they would urge a shutdown of their
3000-member stations for at least a week beginning
Friday.
The dealers will be asked at a meeting in Los
Angeles Wednesday night to lock their pumps until
the council lifts Phase 4 price ceilings, said an
attorney for one group.
"You've got a bunch of angry dealers," said one
operator. "They're fed up and they're not going to
take any more."
A spokesman for a station operators' association
in Northern California its members were "livid
with rage" over the council's increases to
consumers.
The council, in new rules issued Friday, relaxed
its regulations to change the base date for ceiling
prices from last Jan. 10 to May 15 and allowed
dealers to pass along all wholesale increases to Sept.
28. This allowed increases of as much as IVi cents a
gallon.
But three major companies announced wholesale
price increases of from two-tenths of a cent to lVi
cents a gallon over the weekend and these hikes
must be absorbed by the dealers.

Senate Refuses Weapon Cut
WASHINGTON — The Senate reversed itself on
two votes yesterday, refusing finally to make an
overall $500 million cut in a $21 billion weapons
authorization bill.
Voting on the same issue twice, the Senate first
accepted 51 to 47 a $500 million reduction in place
of a $750 million cut proposal, then turned down
the $500 million cut 51 to 47.
The bill was then passed by a 91 to 7 vote,
sending the measure to a House-Senate conference
to adjust differences.
The Senate bill would require withdrawal of
110,000 land based U.S. troops from overseas
stations by Dec. 31, 1975, including 40,000 by June
30, 1974. It also would require a reduction of
156,100 in the overall active duty strength of the
Army, Navy and Air Force by next June 30.
Voting against the $500 million cut in the end
were 15 Democrats and 36 Republicans. Voting for
it were 42 Democrats and five Republicans.
Segretti Pleads Guilty
WASHINGTON — Political saboteur Donald H.
Segretti pleaded guilty yesterday to violating federal
election laws during last year's Democratic
presidential primary in Florida.
In Senate testimony, Segretti was identified as
receiving between $30,000 and $40,000 from a
fund raiser for President Nixon's campaign.
Segretti's guilty plea was to three charges,
including conspiracy and distributing political
literature which did not identify the persons
responsible for distributing it.
A letter outlining the cooperation Segretti agreed
to give prosecutors in exchange for immunity from
further grand jury prosecution was sealed by the
court at the request of Segretti's attorney and
federal prosecutors. No reason was given for keeping
the letter secret.
Segretti had been indicted by a federal grand jury
in Tampa, Fla., on four counts, but prosecutors
agreed to drop one of them.
Among items Segretti was accused of distributing
was a letter on Sen. Edmund S. Muskie's campaign
stationery accusing two other Democratic
candidates, Sens. Hubert H. Humphrey of
Minnesota and Henry Jackson of Washington, of
sexual misconduct.
Segretti, 32, a Los Angeles attorney, entered his
plea before U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard A.
Gesell who deferred sentencing on the three
misdemeanor charges. Each carries a maximum
penalty of one year in jail and a $1,000 fine.
Vietnam Fighting Flares
SAIGON — Communists and government troops
fought the biggest battle since the Vietnam
cease-fire 40 miles northwest of Saigon over the
weekend, the Saigon command said yesterday.
President Nguyen Van Thieu declared the
Communists had taken "the initial step to ignite a
new offensive."
Waves of North Vietnamese and Viet Cong
infantry attacked two government strongpoints near
the Cambodia-South Vietnam border in 24 hours of
savage fighting ending Sunday afternoon leaving
more than 300 soldiers from both sides dead,
wounded or missing, the command announced.
Military spokesman Lt. Col. Le Trung Hien
claimed 183 Communist bodies were counted
around the two positions, the biggest body count
for a single day's fighting since Jan. 28.
Government casualties were put at nine killed
and more than 100 wounded and missing.

Colson Raised 'Plumber* Funds
LOS ANGELES — Former presidential counsel
Charles W. Colson has testified that at John
Ehrlichman's request he raised $5000 for the head
of the "plumbers squad," possibly just before the
break-in at the office of Daniel Ellsberg's
psychiatrist.
Colson's testimony about the financial
transactions was contained in the transcript of grand
jury hearings which was made public Monday.
Ehrlichman, who has been indicted with three
other former presidential advisers in the 1971
break-in, has denied he knew about the break-in in
advance.
Colson said Ehrlichman, formerly President
Nixon's chief domestic adviser, called him in either
late August or early September 1971 — possibly
before the Labor Day weekend break-in.
"Mr. Ehrlichman asked me if I could obtain
$5,000 for Mr. Krogh and he indicated that the
money was needed rather quickly," Colson testified.
Egil Krogh Jr., a former White House aide, has
been indicted and has acknowledged he was the
supervisor of the undercover White House
"plumbers squad" which carried out the burglary.
"I obtained it [the money]" Colson said, "from
Mr. Joseph Baroody who was at the time ... a
partner in the public relations firm that was
organizing the Committee for New Prosperity ..."
Colson said the committee was a private group
formed to "generate public support for the
President's new economic policy."
Chinatown Gambling Probed
SAN FRANCISCO - U.S. Atty. James L.
Browning Jr. today confirmed that a federal grand
jury is investigating allegations that San Francisco
police officers are "receiving money or other items
of value from gambling establishments in
Chinatown."
Browning said the probe also is aimed at
operators of such gambling houses.
"We believe the investigation will necessitate
hearings through the month of October," Browning
said.
He said the federal government can check into
such gambling under two statutes. One provides
federal intervention when a gambling ring involves
five or more persons, operates 30 consecutive days
or has $2000 revenue per day.
The other is a statute making it unlawful for two
or more persons to conspire to obstruct
enforcement of any criminal laws of a state with the
intent to facilitate an illegal gambling business.

The victory clinched the Mets' first divisional
title since 1969 when they went on to win the
World Series.
