# County Porno Law Enforcement Unaffected By 'Community Standards' Court Decision
## 
### KEVIN SMITH 
Despite the Supreme Court decision
on obscenity this summer, the Santa
Clara County district attorney's office
claims there has been no change in
enforcement of pornography laws.
The Court's decision, considered a
major victory for anti-pornography
groups, permits "community
standards" to dictate the regulation of
sexual material.
Although Asst. Dist. Atty. A 1
Fabris "definitely" felt there was a
better chance for conviction since the
decision, he denied that the number of
pornography-related arrests was
increasing.
Fabris said he didn't know of any
alleged pornography dealer in the
county who had not been prosecuted
at least once, and Deputy Dist. Atty.
George Kennedy said that raids on
sexually oriented establishments have
resulted in 23 convictions since Dec.
29, 1971.
'Own Pace'
According to Fabris, the actions of
other communities against exhibitors
of sexually oriented material had no
effect on the number of busts by his
department. "We went at our own
pace, and we did what we thought was
right," he said.
Despite the denials from the district
attorney's office, Gerald Halligan, legal

counsel in President Richard Lyman's
office, painted a different picture of
the situation.
Last November, several students
wanted to show skin flicks in Roble
Hall. Halligan said he held a meeting at
that time with Sheriffs Lt. Michael
Miller and Undersheriff Thomas Rosa
and said he received assurance the skin
flicks could be shown without any
problem.
"We were assured," Halligan
contended, "that the cop on the
beat.. . would be expressly instructed
that even if there were complaints
about the films, he was to take no
action." The films were eventually
shown without incident.
'Green Door' Unopened
This year, ASSU Sunday Flicks
Manager Bob Sisson cancelled a
planned showing of the X-rated movie
Behind the Green Door after being
told by Halligan that legal action
might be taken against the film.
Halligan, acting on Sisson's behalf, had
gone to Miller seeking similar
assurances to those he said he received
last year.
Miller then checked with Kennedy
and reported, according to Halligan,
that "as a result of the cases he
[Miller] saw . . . the Sheriff's office
would be forced to take action" such
as confiscation of the film and arrest

of the projectionist and the manager.
Miller denied that he or Rosa ever
made any commitments to Halligan
during their meeting last year. "I can't
say that I ever gave him any
assurance," Miller stated. Halligan
would not comment on Miller's
version of the meeting except to say
that the discussion of those assurances
"was, as I recall, the purpose of our
going down there."

The "raiding fever" has even
infected Palo Alto recently. Eleven
days ago, the Palo Alto Police
Department raided the Paris Theater
on University Avenue and seized the
X-rated film The Devil in Miss Jones
which had been playing there for
several weeks. The theater has been
showing a second copy of the film
since then.
