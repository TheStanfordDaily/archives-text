# Urban Studies Program Fills Curriculum Gap; Independent Major Status Seen By Next Year
## 
### JOHN FREED 
"Urban Studies is not dead." In
feet, it fills a vital current gap in the
curriculum here, the program's new
director claimed yesterday.
Fred Stout, program co-ordinator
for Urban Studies, added that unlike
SCIRE and SWOPSI, two other
innovative programs, Urban Studies
covers a specific hole in Stanford's
educational field.
"Unlike SCIRE and SWOPSI,
Urban Studies has a definite
curriculum. SWOPSI is there for a
whole variety of topics — which is
good. What we hope to do is fill the
curricular gap which exists in studies

here," Stout observed.
He emphasized that he and the
Urban Studies policy committee must
come up with a solid, comprehensive
program in a relatively short span of
time.
'Top Flight'
"We have to offer a top-flight,
internally coherent curriculum. We
have one quarter to get an
experimental program into shape for
winter and spring quarters.
"Our goal is that, by next fall,
Urban Studies will be a full
undergraduate major program," Stout
said.

Another idea Stout is working on is
a speaker's series to generate
campus-wide interest.
"We hope to have an impact on the
Stanford community by bringing in
good, controversial speakers on
city-related topics," he said.
Stout, who began work here
yesterday, is a Stanford graduate who
participated in dissident student
activities in the late 60s.
He observed that the
student-initiated Urban Studies
program should stay that way.
"At this transitional time, it would
be very easy for Urban Studies to
become a 'department,' like the
English department. That, in my
opinion, would be a disaster. Urban
Studies was student-initiated, and
should continue to be so. It should
respond to student needs, not
departmental ones," Stout said.
He hopes the new US program will
make it easier for students to select
urban studies as a major.

"Next year, hopefully, there will be
no problem with an interdepartmental
major through this office. At this
point, if you want to major in urban
studies, you have to put together a
major of your own — an independent
major," Stout noted.
The program's policy board, which
now consists of eight faculty members
and three as yet unnamed students,
compared similar existing programs
throughout the country before
formulating their own program,
according to Stout.
"Some urban studies programs look
very narrowly at urban problems and
how to solve them. Others look at
cultures in urban life. We have people
in political science, architecture, urban
planning, and other fields, so we hope
to have a program that can look at
man in an urban world," he
concluded.
Stout noted that several major
decisions have yet to be made by the
policy committee.
