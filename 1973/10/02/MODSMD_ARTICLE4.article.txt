# Urban Studies Program Fills Curriculum Gap; Independent Major Status Seen By Next Year
## 
### JOHN FREED 
"Urban Studies is not dead." In
feet, it fills a vital current gap in the
curriculum here, the program's new
director claimed yesterday.
Fred Stout, program co-ordinator
for Urban Studies, added that unlike
SCIRE and SWOPSI, two other
innovative programs, Urban Studies
covers a specific hole in Stanford's
educational field.
"Unlike SCIRE and SWOPSI,
Urban Studies has a definite
curriculum. SWOPSI is there for a
whole variety of topics — which is
good. What we hope to do is fill the
curricular gap which exists in studies

here," Stout observed.
He emphasized that he and the
Urban Studies policy committee must
come up with a solid, comprehensive
program in a relatively short span of
time.
'Top Flight'
"We have to offer a top-flight,
internally coherent curriculum. We
have one quarter to get an
experimental program into shape for
winter and spring quarters.
"Our goal is that, by next fall,
Urban Studies will be a full
undergraduate major program," Stout
said.
