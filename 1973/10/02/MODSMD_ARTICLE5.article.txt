# Stop Signs Baffle Motorists
## 
### KITTY PATTERSON 
If one of the 175 stop signs cluttering the
campus hasn't tripped you up already, or if a
limited-time parking zone made you bolt from the
classroom a few minutes early, chances are good, if
you own a car, that your turn is next.
For the student motorist, paying his way through
college means covering far more than just tuition
and board. He's apt to have to find his way through
a maze of parking tickets and moving violations as
well.
Last year officers issued over 16,000 citations on
campus. This figure averages out to about one ticket
for every person who parks his car on campus at any
given time.
Four parking enforcement officers employed by
Stanford and deputized by Santa Clara County give
citations to those who park overtime, park without
an authorization sticker or block a crosswalk. Fines
range from $2 to $5.
Reserved
Most parking lots are reserved for cars with
special permits. For example, a student living in
Stem Hall should buy a $10 sticker authorizing him
to park in the Stem Hall lot. Even if he lives closer
to Crothers lot, he must still park at Stem — or run
the risk of receiving a ticket for not having a
Crothers sticker.
Parking areas generally have time limits posted.
As the officer patrols, he marks each car's tires with
white chalk, and if the car is still there when he
makes his next rounds, he issues a $2 ticket.

Parking officer Ted Hopgood said he issues most
of his tickets to staff members and off-campus
students. He takes a hard-nosed line: "If they're in a
hurry to get to work on time or to get to a class,
they'll park anywhere. TTiey know the lot is
reserved, but they'll still take the chance."
According to Hopgood, a student will learn after
two or three tickets to come earlier and find a safe
place to park. But some staff members are slower,
he said.
Higher
He cited one woman for about $50 worth of
tickets within several weeks. She admitted she knew
she was parked illegally, but said she was going to
continue until she ran up as big a bill as her husband
had: $284.
Occasionally, an irate driver tries to keep a
patrolman from writing up a ticket. Hopgood
explained, "The main gripe is they don't think it's
fair — that the area shouldn't be reserved."
He sympathizes with waylaid drivers: "There is
just not enough space to go around," he said.
The little space there is goes to the biggest
people. Captain William Wullschuleger explained,
"Those people most important to the University get
priority." For example, there are some areas
specifically reserved for senior faculty members, and
even assistant professors may not park there.
Flexible
Officers claim they allow parkers a great deal of
flexibility. Wullschleger said, "We try not to cut it
too close with the overtime parking. If it's a two
hour zone, the officer mav not come back until

three hours after he first marks the cars."
Their leniency is not entirely intentional. In fact,
there are not enough officers to issue as many
tickets as there are violations.
"We check for stickers in areas near the
bookstore, like Storey and Delta Upsilon.
Otherwise, we check out a dorm lot only if the RAs
from that dorm complain to us," Hopgood
explained.
For the last few years, only one man on the
force, the "contract officer," could issue moving
violations; he patrols the campus in a green and
white car, 88 hours a month. He belongs to the
Santa Clara County Sheriffs office, and Stanford
pays the county an hourly fee for his services.
Speeding, Stop Signs
Last year, he issued 1083 moving violation
tickets. Almost all of them were for speeding or
running stop signs.
Perry Hackett, manager of campus roads and
grounds, estimates there are 175 stop signs on
campus, with up to six signs posted at a single
intersection. Some are placed so close together that
it is easy to stop at the first one and run the next.
Bicyclists are also expected to obey traffic signs,
and the contract officer can issue them moving
violation tickets. Several small stop signs mark every
bike crossing.
As the profusion of stop signs on campus drives
motorists to occasionally ignore them, and the
dearth of parking space forces them to scramble for
any spaces they can find, the officers' job is to sort
out the confusion.

grounds, estimates there are 175 stop signs on
campus, with up to six signs posted at a single
intersection. Some are placed so close together that
it is easy to stop at the first one and run the next.
Bicyclists are also expected to obey traffic signs,
and the contract officer can issue them moving
violation tickets. Several small stop signs mark every
bike crossing.
As the profusion of stop signs on campus drives
motorists to occasionally ignore them, and the
dearth of parking space forces them to scramble for
any spaces they can find, the officers' job is to sort
out the confusion.

ARRRGH! — Have you ever had that sinking feeling as you leave a class, rushing
to make lunch, and see a pretty piece of yellow paper fluttering on your
windshield? Meet the man who makes it all possible, Public Safety Officer
Joseph Lubrickas, shown here doing his thing.
If one of the 175 stop signs cluttering the
campus hasn't tripped you up already, or if a
limited-time parking zone made you bolt from the
classroom a few minutes early, chances are good, if
you own a car, that your turn is next.
For the student motorist, paying his way through
college means covering far more than just tuition
and board. He's apt to have to find his way through
a maze of parking tickets and moving violations as
well.
Last year officers issued over 16,000 citations on
campus. This figure averages out to about one ticket
for every person who parks his car on campus at any
given time.
Four parking enforcement officers employed by
Stanford and deputized by Santa Clara County give
citations to those who park overtime, park without
an authorization sticker or block a crosswalk. Fines
range from $2 to $5.
Reserved
Most parking lots are reserved for cars with
special permits. For example, a student living in
Stem Hall should buy a $10 sticker authorizing him
to park in the Stem Hall lot. Even if he lives closer
to Crothers lot, he must still park at Stem — or run
the risk of receiving a ticket for not having a
Crothers sticker.
Parking areas generally have time limits posted.
As the officer patrols, he marks each car's tires with
white chalk, and if the car is still there when he
makes his next rounds, he issues a $2 ticket.

Parking officer Ted Hopgood said he issues most
of his tickets to staff members and off-campus
students. He takes a hard-nosed line: "If they're in a
hurry to get to work on time or to get to a class,
they'll park anywhere. TTiey know the lot is
reserved, but they'll still take the chance."
According to Hopgood, a student will learn after
two or three tickets to come earlier and find a safe
place to park. But some staff members are slower,
he said.
Higher
He cited one woman for about $50 worth of
tickets within several weeks. She admitted she knew
she was parked illegally, but said she was going to
continue until she ran up as big a bill as her husband
had: $284.
Occasionally, an irate driver tries to keep a
patrolman from writing up a ticket. Hopgood
explained, "The main gripe is they don't think it's
fair — that the area shouldn't be reserved."
He sympathizes with waylaid drivers: "There is
just not enough space to go around," he said.
The little space there is goes to the biggest
people. Captain William Wullschuleger explained,
"Those people most important to the University get
priority." For example, there are some areas
specifically reserved for senior faculty members, and
even assistant professors may not park there.
Flexible
Officers claim they allow parkers a great deal of
flexibility. Wullschleger said, "We try not to cut it
too close with the overtime parking. If it's a two
hour zone, the officer mav not come back until

three hours after he first marks the cars."
Their leniency is not entirely intentional. In fact,
there are not enough officers to issue as many
tickets as there are violations.
"We check for stickers in areas near the
bookstore, like Storey and Delta Upsilon.
Otherwise, we check out a dorm lot only if the RAs
from that dorm complain to us," Hopgood
explained.
For the last few years, only one man on the
force, the "contract officer," could issue moving
violations; he patrols the campus in a green and
white car, 88 hours a month. He belongs to the
Santa Clara County Sheriffs office, and Stanford
pays the county an hourly fee for his services.
Speeding, Stop Signs
Last year, he issued 1083 moving violation
tickets. Almost all of them were for speeding or
running stop signs.

grounds, estimates there are 175 stop signs on
campus, with up to six signs posted at a single
intersection. Some are placed so close together that
it is easy to stop at the first one and run the next.

Their leniency is not entirely intentional. In fact,
there are not enough officers to issue as many
tickets as there are violations.
"We check for stickers in areas near the
bookstore, like Storey and Delta Upsilon.
Otherwise, we check out a dorm lot only if the RAs
from that dorm complain to us," Hopgood
explained.
For the last few years, only one man on the
force, the "contract officer," could issue moving
violations; he patrols the campus in a green and
white car, 88 hours a month. He belongs to the
Santa Clara County Sheriffs office, and Stanford
pays the county an hourly fee for his services.
Speeding, Stop Signs
Last year, he issued 1083 moving violation
tickets. Almost all of them were for speeding or
running stop signs.
Perry Hackett, manager of campus roads and
grounds, estimates there are 175 stop signs on
campus, with up to six signs posted at a single
intersection. Some are placed so close together that
it is easy to stop at the first one and run the next.
Bicyclists are also expected to obey traffic signs,
and the contract officer can issue them moving
violation tickets. Several small stop signs mark every
bike crossing.
As the profusion of stop signs on campus drives
motorists to occasionally ignore them, and the
dearth of parking space forces them to scramble for
any spaces they can find, the officers' job is to sort
out the confusion.
