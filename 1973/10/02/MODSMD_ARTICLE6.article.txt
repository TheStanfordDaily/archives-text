# Don't let Alegria Down
## Tragedy Continues In Chile 
### 
* Larry Diamond

Day after day, relentlessly, the
horror stories continue to spill
onto the pages of even the San
Francisco Chronicle as a military
junta ushers in fascism to Chile by
special delivery and digs in for a
long stay.
Leftist leaders are hunted
down and murdered, or
imprisoned and tortured. A
former leftist governor is executed
after a summary court martial
while thirty of the murdered
President's closest aides are jailed
on a remote island. The national
soccer stadium becomes,
overnight, a mass political prison.
Books are bumed — anything
that offends the military's
reactionary notions of how a
society and an economy should be
organized. A great poet and
national hero, Pablo Neruda, dies
of a broken heart. His literary
testament is sacked and butchered
by the new regime.
Intellectual dissent is
abolished. Newspapers, magazines
and radio stations controlled by
political parties of Allende's
coalition are "cancelled forever,"
in the words of one junta
member.
Abolishment
Political dissent is abolished,
and one of the longest democratic
traditions in Latin America is
forcibly ended in an instant. The
Congress is suspended
indefinitely.
The existing Constitution is
abolished, to be replaced by one
that will, for the first time,
authorize a direct military role in
the governing of the nation.
Marxist political parties are
outlawed. Non-marxist parties,
the government announces, will
be placed in indefinite recess;
"there will be no further need for
political reunions or party
gatherings."
The heads of all seven
campuses of the University of
Chile are dismissed, to be replaced
for the first time by rectors
appointed by the government.
Another cherished Chilean
tradition is abruptly halted by
force.
Prevalent Fear
Allende supporters not yet i.
prison, in graves, or in rebellion
recoil in fear of the state police,
nursing their own private horrors
and nightmares: bodies floating
dow-n the Mapacho river; local
radio alerts announcing the names
of those wanted by the army;
shaven heads of Allende
supporters, young and old alike;
doors bursting open in the middle
of the night and loved ones carted
away without explanation; the
Presidential palace, La Moneda,
the seat and symbol of more than
a century of Chilean governments,
reduced to a bumed out shell by
the planes and tanks of the
people's own armed forces.
With a thoroughness and
savagery uncommon even for
Latin American coups, the
national military makes Chile
"free from the yoke of Marxism,"
free, too, from the yoke of
freedom, free from all the
uncertainties of democracy, free
to celebrate the 163 rd anniversary
of Chilean independence under a
dictatorship as brutal and rigid
and determined to stay as any
that has arrived on the world
scene in quite some time.
Back from the horror in Chile,
probably lucky to be alive, a brave
and eloquent associate of
Allende's pleads to a packed
auditorium of Stanford students
to help him save his country. We
who are there are enormously
moved by the courage and
undaunted optimism of Fernando
Alegria, and we applaud him.
But applause dies quickly, and
even the most urgent and
eloquent of appeals can fade too
soon in the delirium of sun and

beer and football at Stanford. So
now that we finally have a victory
behind us, maybe we should pause
for a minute in between our
physics and pizza and ask
ourselves what we are going to do
about Chile.
It is a question we had better
ask ourselves, because we here in
this country have a very big stake
in what happens in Chile.
For one, we have a certain
moral responsibility in this. It was
our government that sabotaged
the Chilean economy by blocking
badly needed loans and aid. It was
our government that trained and
supplied the armed forces that
now run the country. Even if we
shared no direct role in the coup,
our indirect role in toppling
Allende's democratically elected
government is inescapable.
Selfish Interest
Even more importantly, we
have a certain selfish interest in
this. Democracy is not so old and
enduring a phenomenon in the
history of the world that it can
survive repeated extermination in
other lands without being
threatened in our own.
We are marching rapidly
toward a world order so close to
the Orwellian vision it is
terrifying. Nations with varying
degrees of freedom are
succumbing to dictatorships that
give no indication of planning any
restoration of basic liberties:
Greece and Uruguay, the
Phillipines and Brazil, and on and
on through the developing and
underdeveloped world.
The Chilean democracy was
among the best that was left, and
it is not clear that it is
permanently laid to rest. Perhaps
there is hope that the military can
be forced to relinquish power, or
at least ease its reign of terror.
Certainly there is hope that we
can save the lives of those 7,000
prisoners in the soccer stadium,
and the thousands more in similar
make-shift prisons throughout the
country.
Raise Your Voices
Even if there is hope that one
life can be saved by it, we must do
the little that we can: pick up our
pens and write, raise our voices
and speak, demanding that our
congress take a stand for the
people of Chile, urging it to:
1) Withhold all military,
economic and police aid to the
military junta or any illegal
government it might install,
2) Take immediate steps to
prevent the killing and repression
of political prisoners, members of
the opposition, and foreign exiles,
and
3) Investigate the role of our
government and certain of our
corporations in the coup.
Among the people we should
contact fast are Sen. Edward
Kennedy, Sen. William Fulbright,
Sen. Gale McGee, Cong. Donald
Frazier, Cong. Dante Fascell, and
our own Sen. Alan Cranston, Sen.
John Tunney, and Cong. Paul
McCloskey. The Senate Office
Building is in Washington D.C.
20510; the House Office Building
is in Washington D.C. 20515.
In addition to our flooding the
Congress with these messages, we
must pressure the press and
important professional
associations to issue the same
outraged call for a full scale
economic and political campaign
against the junta.
Stanford is an opinion-making
community in this country, as are
most college communities. It was
on college campuses like this one
that the first cries against our
involvement in Vietnam were
expressed. It was students like
ourselves that helped begin the
anti-war movement.
If I were Fernando Alegria I
would also think that any
movement in this country to save

Chile would probably have to
begin on the campuses — "with
you, the youth" — and so I also
would make the appeal that he
did to us to help him save Chile.
Alegria spoke to us as a patriot,
anguished but undefeated,
wounded but full of hope. His was
perhaps the most moving and
direct appeal I've ever heard on
this campus, and even if we only
write some letters, send some
telegrams, and pressure our own
leaders and spokesmen on campus
to add to the sense of outrage
with their official voices, I hope
we at least do that.
I hope and pray that we don't
let Fernando Alegria down.

of those wanted by the army;
shaven heads of Allende
supporters, young and old alike;
doors bursting open in the middle
of the night and loved ones carted
away without explanation; the
Presidential palace, La Moneda,
the seat and symbol of more than
a century of Chilean governments,
reduced to a bumed out shell by
the planes and tanks of the
people's own armed forces.
With a thoroughness and
savagery uncommon even for
Latin American coups, the
national military makes Chile
"free from the yoke of Marxism,"
free, too, from the yoke of
freedom, free from all the
uncertainties of democracy, free
to celebrate the 163 rd anniversary
of Chilean independence under a
dictatorship as brutal and rigid
and determined to stay as any
that has arrived on the world
scene in quite some time.
Back from the horror in Chile,
probably lucky to be alive, a brave
and eloquent associate of
Allende's pleads to a packed
auditorium of Stanford students
to help him save his country. We
who are there are enormously
moved by the courage and
undaunted optimism of Fernando
Alegria, and we applaud him.
But applause dies quickly, and
even the most urgent and
eloquent of appeals can fade too
soon in the delirium of sun and

beer and football at Stanford. So
now that we finally have a victory
behind us, maybe we should pause
for a minute in between our
physics and pizza and ask
ourselves what we are going to do
about Chile.
It is a question we had better
ask ourselves, because we here in
this country have a very big stake
in what happens in Chile.
For one, we have a certain
moral responsibility in this. It was
our government that sabotaged
the Chilean economy by blocking
badly needed loans and aid. It was
our government that trained and
supplied the armed forces that
now run the country. Even if we
shared no direct role in the coup,
our indirect role in toppling
Allende's democratically elected
government is inescapable.
Selfish Interest
Even more importantly, we
have a certain selfish interest in
this. Democracy is not so old and
enduring a phenomenon in the
history of the world that it can
survive repeated extermination in
other lands without being
threatened in our own.
We are marching rapidly
toward a world order so close to
the Orwellian vision it is
terrifying. Nations with varying
degrees of freedom are
succumbing to dictatorships that
give no indication of planning any
restoration of basic liberties:
Greece and Uruguay, the
Phillipines and Brazil, and on and
on through the developing and
underdeveloped world.
The Chilean democracy was
among the best that was left, and
it is not clear that it is
permanently laid to rest. Perhaps
there is hope that the military can
be forced to relinquish power, or
at least ease its reign of terror.
Certainly there is hope that we
can save the lives of those 7,000
prisoners in the soccer stadium,
and the thousands more in similar
make-shift prisons throughout the
country.
Raise Your Voices
Even if there is hope that one
life can be saved by it, we must do
the little that we can: pick up our
pens and write, raise our voices
and speak, demanding that our
congress take a stand for the
people of Chile, urging it to:
1) Withhold all military,
economic and police aid to the
military junta or any illegal
government it might install,
2) Take immediate steps to
prevent the killing and repression
of political prisoners, members of
the opposition, and foreign exiles,
and
3) Investigate the role of our
government and certain of our
corporations in the coup.
Among the people we should
contact fast are Sen. Edward
Kennedy, Sen. William Fulbright,
Sen. Gale McGee, Cong. Donald
Frazier, Cong. Dante Fascell, and
our own Sen. Alan Cranston, Sen.
John Tunney, and Cong. Paul
McCloskey. The Senate Office
Building is in Washington D.C.
20510; the House Office Building
is in Washington D.C. 20515.
In addition to our flooding the
Congress with these messages, we
must pressure the press and
important professional
associations to issue the same
outraged call for a full scale
economic and political campaign
against the junta.
Stanford is an opinion-making
community in this country, as are
most college communities. It was
on college campuses like this one
that the first cries against our
involvement in Vietnam were
expressed. It was students like
ourselves that helped begin the
anti-war movement.
If I were Fernando Alegria I
would also think that any
movement in this country to save

Chile would probably have to
begin on the campuses — "with
you, the youth" — and so I also
would make the appeal that he
did to us to help him save Chile.
Alegria spoke to us as a patriot,
anguished but undefeated,
wounded but full of hope. His was
perhaps the most moving and
direct appeal I've ever heard on
this campus, and even if we only
write some letters, send some
telegrams, and pressure our own
leaders and spokesmen on campus
to add to the sense of outrage
with their official voices, I hope
we at least do that.
I hope and pray that we don't
let Fernando Alegria down.

Day after day, relentlessly, the
horror stories continue to spill
onto the pages of even the San
Francisco Chronicle as a military
junta ushers in fascism to Chile by
special delivery and digs in for a
long stay.
Leftist leaders are hunted
down and murdered, or
imprisoned and tortured. A
former leftist governor is executed
after a summary court martial
while thirty of the murdered
President's closest aides are jailed
on a remote island. The national
soccer stadium becomes,
overnight, a mass political prison.
Books are bumed — anything
that offends the military's
reactionary notions of how a
society and an economy should be
organized. A great poet and
national hero, Pablo Neruda, dies
of a broken heart. His literary
testament is sacked and butchered
by the new regime.
Intellectual dissent is
abolished. Newspapers, magazines
and radio stations controlled by
political parties of Allende's
coalition are "cancelled forever,"
in the words of one junta
member.
Abolishment
Political dissent is abolished,
and one of the longest democratic
traditions in Latin America is
forcibly ended in an instant. The
Congress is suspended
indefinitely.
The existing Constitution is
abolished, to be replaced by one
that will, for the first time,
authorize a direct military role in
the governing of the nation.
Marxist political parties are
outlawed. Non-marxist parties,
the government announces, will
be placed in indefinite recess;
"there will be no further need for
political reunions or party
gatherings."
The heads of all seven
campuses of the University of
Chile are dismissed, to be replaced
for the first time by rectors
appointed by the government.
Another cherished Chilean
tradition is abruptly halted by
force.
Prevalent Fear
Allende supporters not yet i.
prison, in graves, or in rebellion
recoil in fear of the state police,

Even more importantly, we
have a certain selfish interest in
this. Democracy is not so old and
enduring a phenomenon in the
history of the world that it can
survive repeated extermination in
other lands without being
threatened in our own.
We are marching rapidly
toward a world order so close to
the Orwellian vision it is
terrifying. Nations with varying
degrees of freedom are
succumbing to dictatorships that
give no indication of planning any
restoration of basic liberties:
Greece and Uruguay, the
Phillipines and Brazil, and on and
on through the developing and
underdeveloped world.
The Chilean democracy was
among the best that was left, and
it is not clear that it is
permanently laid to rest. Perhaps
there is hope that the military can
be forced to relinquish power, or
at least ease its reign of terror.
Certainly there is hope that we
can save the lives of those 7,000
prisoners in the soccer stadium,
and the thousands more in similar
make-shift prisons throughout the
country.
Raise Your Voices
Even if there is hope that one
life can be saved by it, we must do
the little that we can: pick up our
pens and write, raise our voices
and speak, demanding that our
congress take a stand for the
people of Chile, urging it to:
1) Withhold all military,
economic and police aid to the
military junta or any illegal
government it might install,
2) Take immediate steps to
prevent the killing and repression
of political prisoners, members of
the opposition, and foreign exiles,
and
3) Investigate the role of our
government and certain of our
corporations in the coup.
Among the people we should
contact fast are Sen. Edward
Kennedy, Sen. William Fulbright,
Sen. Gale McGee, Cong. Donald
Frazier, Cong. Dante Fascell, and
our own Sen. Alan Cranston, Sen.
John Tunney, and Cong. Paul
McCloskey. The Senate Office
Building is in Washington D.C.
20510; the House Office Building
is in Washington D.C. 20515.
In addition to our flooding the
Congress with these messages, we
must pressure the press and
important professional
associations to issue the same
outraged call for a full scale
economic and political campaign
against the junta.
Stanford is an opinion-making
community in this country, as are
most college communities. It was
on college campuses like this one
that the first cries against our
involvement in Vietnam were
expressed. It was students like
ourselves that helped begin the
anti-war movement.
If I were Fernando Alegria I
would also think that any
movement in this country to save

Chile would probably have to
begin on the campuses — "with
you, the youth" — and so I also
would make the appeal that he
did to us to help him save Chile.
Alegria spoke to us as a patriot,
anguished but undefeated,
wounded but full of hope. His was
perhaps the most moving and
direct appeal I've ever heard on
this campus, and even if we only
write some letters, send some
telegrams, and pressure our own
leaders and spokesmen on campus
to add to the sense of outrage
with their official voices, I hope
we at least do that.
I hope and pray that we don't
let Fernando Alegria down.

Day after day, relentlessly, the
horror stories continue to spill
onto the pages of even the San
Francisco Chronicle as a military
junta ushers in fascism to Chile by
special delivery and digs in for a
long stay.
Leftist leaders are hunted
down and murdered, or
imprisoned and tortured. A
former leftist governor is executed
after a summary court martial
while thirty of the murdered
President's closest aides are jailed
on a remote island. The national
soccer stadium becomes,
overnight, a mass political prison.
Books are bumed — anything
that offends the military's
reactionary notions of how a
society and an economy should be
organized. A great poet and
national hero, Pablo Neruda, dies
of a broken heart. His literary
testament is sacked and butchered
by the new regime.
Intellectual dissent is
abolished. Newspapers, magazines
and radio stations controlled by
political parties of Allende's
coalition are "cancelled forever,"
in the words of one junta
member.
Abolishment
Political dissent is abolished,
and one of the longest democratic
traditions in Latin America is
forcibly ended in an instant. The
Congress is suspended
indefinitely.
The existing Constitution is
abolished, to be replaced by one
that will, for the first time,
authorize a direct military role in
the governing of the nation.
Marxist political parties are
outlawed. Non-marxist parties,
the government announces, will
be placed in indefinite recess;
"there will be no further need for
political reunions or party
gatherings."
The heads of all seven
campuses of the University of
Chile are dismissed, to be replaced
for the first time by rectors
appointed by the government.
Another cherished Chilean
tradition is abruptly halted by
force.
Prevalent Fear
Allende supporters not yet i.
prison, in graves, or in rebellion
recoil in fear of the state police,
nursing their own private horrors
and nightmares: bodies floating
dow-n the Mapacho river; local
radio alerts announcing the names
of those wanted by the army;
shaven heads of Allende
supporters, young and old alike;
doors bursting open in the middle
of the night and loved ones carted
away without explanation; the
Presidential palace, La Moneda,
the seat and symbol of more than
a century of Chilean governments,
reduced to a bumed out shell by
the planes and tanks of the
people's own armed forces.
With a thoroughness and
savagery uncommon even for
Latin American coups, the
national military makes Chile
"free from the yoke of Marxism,"
free, too, from the yoke of
freedom, free from all the
uncertainties of democracy, free
to celebrate the 163 rd anniversary
of Chilean independence under a
dictatorship as brutal and rigid
and determined to stay as any
that has arrived on the world
scene in quite some time.
Back from the horror in Chile,
probably lucky to be alive, a brave
and eloquent associate of
Allende's pleads to a packed
auditorium of Stanford students
to help him save his country. We
who are there are enormously
moved by the courage and
undaunted optimism of Fernando
Alegria, and we applaud him.
But applause dies quickly, and
even the most urgent and
eloquent of appeals can fade too
soon in the delirium of sun and

beer and football at Stanford. So
now that we finally have a victory
behind us, maybe we should pause
for a minute in between our
physics and pizza and ask
ourselves what we are going to do
about Chile.
It is a question we had better
ask ourselves, because we here in
this country have a very big stake
in what happens in Chile.
For one, we have a certain
moral responsibility in this. It was
our government that sabotaged
the Chilean economy by blocking
badly needed loans and aid. It was
our government that trained and
supplied the armed forces that
now run the country. Even if we
shared no direct role in the coup,
our indirect role in toppling
Allende's democratically elected
government is inescapable.

If I were Fernando Alegria I

Alegria spoke to us as a patriot,
anguished but undefeated,
wounded but full of hope. His was
perhaps the most moving and
direct appeal I've ever heard on
this campus, and even if we only
write some letters, send some
telegrams, and pressure our own
leaders and spokesmen on campus
to add to the sense of outrage
with their official voices, I hope
we at least do that.
I hope and pray that we don't
let Fernando Alegria down.

Day after day, relentlessly, the
horror stories continue to spill
onto the pages of even the San
Francisco Chronicle as a military
junta ushers in fascism to Chile by
special delivery and digs in for a
long stay.
Leftist leaders are hunted
down and murdered, or
imprisoned and tortured. A
former leftist governor is executed
after a summary court martial
while thirty of the murdered
President's closest aides are jailed
on a remote island. The national
soccer stadium becomes,
overnight, a mass political prison.
Books are bumed — anything
that offends the military's
reactionary notions of how a
society and an economy should be
organized. A great poet and
national hero, Pablo Neruda, dies
of a broken heart. His literary
testament is sacked and butchered
by the new regime.
Intellectual dissent is
abolished. Newspapers, magazines
and radio stations controlled by
political parties of Allende's
coalition are "cancelled forever,"
in the words of one junta
member.
Abolishment
Political dissent is abolished,
and one of the longest democratic
traditions in Latin America is
forcibly ended in an instant. The
Congress is suspended
indefinitely.
The existing Constitution is
abolished, to be replaced by one
that will, for the first time,
authorize a direct military role in
the governing of the nation.
Marxist political parties are
outlawed. Non-marxist parties,
the government announces, will
be placed in indefinite recess;
"there will be no further need for
political reunions or party
gatherings."
The heads of all seven
campuses of the University of
Chile are dismissed, to be replaced
for the first time by rectors
appointed by the government.
Another cherished Chilean
tradition is abruptly halted by
force.
Prevalent Fear
Allende supporters not yet i.
prison, in graves, or in rebellion
recoil in fear of the state police,
nursing their own private horrors
and nightmares: bodies floating
dow-n the Mapacho river; local
radio alerts announcing the names
of those wanted by the army;
shaven heads of Allende
supporters, young and old alike;
doors bursting open in the middle
of the night and loved ones carted
away without explanation; the
Presidential palace, La Moneda,
the seat and symbol of more than
a century of Chilean governments,
reduced to a bumed out shell by
the planes and tanks of the
people's own armed forces.
With a thoroughness and
savagery uncommon even for
Latin American coups, the
national military makes Chile
"free from the yoke of Marxism,"
free, too, from the yoke of
freedom, free from all the
uncertainties of democracy, free
to celebrate the 163 rd anniversary
of Chilean independence under a
dictatorship as brutal and rigid
and determined to stay as any
that has arrived on the world
scene in quite some time.
Back from the horror in Chile,
probably lucky to be alive, a brave
and eloquent associate of
Allende's pleads to a packed
auditorium of Stanford students
to help him save his country. We
who are there are enormously
moved by the courage and
undaunted optimism of Fernando
Alegria, and we applaud him.
But applause dies quickly, and
even the most urgent and
eloquent of appeals can fade too
soon in the delirium of sun and

beer and football at Stanford. So
now that we finally have a victory
behind us, maybe we should pause
for a minute in between our
physics and pizza and ask
ourselves what we are going to do
about Chile.
It is a question we had better
ask ourselves, because we here in
this country have a very big stake
in what happens in Chile.
For one, we have a certain
moral responsibility in this. It was
our government that sabotaged
the Chilean economy by blocking
badly needed loans and aid. It was
our government that trained and
supplied the armed forces that
now run the country. Even if we
shared no direct role in the coup,
our indirect role in toppling
Allende's democratically elected
government is inescapable.
Selfish Interest
Even more importantly, we
have a certain selfish interest in
this. Democracy is not so old and
enduring a phenomenon in the
history of the world that it can
survive repeated extermination in
other lands without being
threatened in our own.
We are marching rapidly
toward a world order so close to
the Orwellian vision it is
terrifying. Nations with varying
degrees of freedom are
succumbing to dictatorships that
give no indication of planning any
restoration of basic liberties:
Greece and Uruguay, the
Phillipines and Brazil, and on and
on through the developing and
underdeveloped world.
The Chilean democracy was
among the best that was left, and
it is not clear that it is
permanently laid to rest. Perhaps
there is hope that the military can
be forced to relinquish power, or
at least ease its reign of terror.
Certainly there is hope that we
can save the lives of those 7,000
prisoners in the soccer stadium,
and the thousands more in similar
make-shift prisons throughout the
country.
Raise Your Voices
Even if there is hope that one
life can be saved by it, we must do
the little that we can: pick up our
pens and write, raise our voices
and speak, demanding that our
congress take a stand for the
people of Chile, urging it to:
1) Withhold all military,
economic and police aid to the
military junta or any illegal
government it might install,
2) Take immediate steps to
prevent the killing and repression
of political prisoners, members of
the opposition, and foreign exiles,
and
3) Investigate the role of our
government and certain of our
corporations in the coup.
Among the people we should
contact fast are Sen. Edward
Kennedy, Sen. William Fulbright,
Sen. Gale McGee, Cong. Donald
Frazier, Cong. Dante Fascell, and
our own Sen. Alan Cranston, Sen.
John Tunney, and Cong. Paul
McCloskey. The Senate Office
Building is in Washington D.C.
20510; the House Office Building
is in Washington D.C. 20515.
In addition to our flooding the
Congress with these messages, we
must pressure the press and
important professional
associations to issue the same
outraged call for a full scale
economic and political campaign
against the junta.
