## Injured Capitalism Fosters Fascism

(This is the first of a series of
articles appearing on this page
during this week.)
We are all affected in our daily
lives by the politics of this
country, whether we're students,
workers, or faculty. Be it in terms
of rising food and gas
prices, community control,
freedom of speech, or the quality
of our work, none of us escapes it.
And one of the most important
things now being discussed about
our political situation is the rise of
fascism. This article includes some
preliminary thoughts on what
fascism is, where it comes from,
and how it is manifested.
First, what is fascism? Very
generally, it's the oppressive
control of the masses of people in
a specific capitalist country by that
smeill number of people who have
access to and control capital. (An
owner of capital is one who owns

the means by which goods are
produced for purchase and
consumption.) Fascism usually
includes glorification of a nation
or race and demand for strong
state power in a constant attempt
to gloss over conflicts existing
between and within social classes.
There are, of course,
differences among the forms of
fascism as it has existed in
different countries. For example,
the power of the mass media and
the emphasis on consuming in the
U.S. give oppressive political
control here a unique character.
How Fascism Grows
What then gives rise to fascism
in the U.S.? While it is by no
means inevitable, fascism is
generally the result of a natural
situation where capitalism is
severely injured but not destroyed
in one country. What we have to
see is that this weakening comes

from the core of our system — the
necessity to place production for
profit above production for the
needs of most people.
The U.S. economic system has
been weakened by two major
conflicts: between U.S. and
foreign business, and between
U.S. business and large numbers
of American working people.
The conflicts between U.S. and
foreign capital can best be seen
through the worsening US. balance
of payments situations. The core
factor is U.S. overseas military
activity and aid which has gone on
for so many years. ($77 billion
since WWII beside Korea and
Vietnam expenditures.) These
expenditures have resulted in the
U.S. owing a lot of money on a
short term basis. The problem is
that U.S. assets overseas are long
term investments, so the money
to pay our short term debts isn't

available. And we can't make up
the difference by selling U.S.
goods abroad since we're not
really competitive — we've spent
all our funds and energies on
defending foreign investment
overseas.
Government Support
Thus the government supports
development of jet bombers and
not manufacturer of a low coast,
clean running automobile. So
countries like Japan and Germany
are taking our markets, and more
money goes out than comes in.
We're bankrupt. The result is
government supported efforts to
tell Americans it's the Japanese
we should be angry at, and not
our own employers and
government.
How does this fit into the
second condition, i.e. pressure
from working people? Even
before the balance of payments
problem became acute, corporate
businessmen were getting worried
about their declining profit rate
and the larger share going to
employees. Strikes were
increasing. The result was
Nixonomics with its phases and its
laying the blame for inflation on
to worker's demands for decent
wages. In fact, inflation comes
from investment decisions by
business and government
themselves.
Now, pushed by the balance of
payments deficit, the government
and corporate business circles
found a solution which puts even
more pressure on most
Americans: selling of U.S.
agricultural goods overseas for
foreign currency to pay off U.S.
debts. So prices go up because of
shortages, and also because U.S.
exporters can jack up prices
through speculation. The problem
will continue even if domestic
production rises since Secretary of
Agriculture Butz has stated U.S.
intentions to raise overseas sales
of U.S. farm products to $11
billion from a 1970 total of $3.5
billion.
Inflation
The inflation resulting from all
this has affected smaller
businesses since investment
money and savings are harder to
come by. The result is more small
business people becoming workers
for someone else and the
intensified extension of corporate
power.
The growing crisis in the U.S.
political order is far more than
spiraling inflation and economic
decisions which result in hunger
for many. Growing economic and
political pressure has resulted in
an undermining of traditional
democratic rights, and attempts to
legitimize what may previously
have been illegitimate political
procedures. This is not a process
of 'seizure of state power.'
It is often accomplished
through a manipulation of
people's democratic liberties, and
experimentation with the limits of
people's tolerance in having those
liberties undermined in the name
of law and order. (Democratic
processes in fact are used in
legitimizing political control at
the top.) Thus, the Nixon and
Reagan crime bills, more stringent
drug laws like those recently
passed in New York, and Nixon's
very claims of executive privilege,
don't openly violate the
"democratic process."
On a national level,

experimentation with the
consolidation or power has relied
to a large degree on the assertions
that such tactics have been
employed in the past. Thus,
Nixon's defense of Watergate on
the grounds that previous
administrations have also used
similar tactics. Likewise, John
Mitchell in promoting the theory
that the executive has the
exclusive and inherent power to
wiretap any citizen if the person is
thought by the President to
present a threat to domestic
tranquility.
As has been publicly revealed,
the executive has been bugging
and burglarizing for decades. The
Nixon people, however, desire to
legitimize the practice, thereby
setting the stage for even greater
assertions of executive authority.
The executive privilege argument
is the most concrete statement of
this: that no one in any executive
department is answerable to
anyone but the President, and
Nixon himself is answerable to no
one. The significant thing here is
the formalization of absolute
executive privilege.
Incredible Speed
Repressive institutions and
legal procedures are surfacing and
expanding with incredible speed.
The Internal Security Division of
the Justice which has
been largely dormant since the
McCarthy era, was enlarged from
a staff of six attorneys in the
spring of 1969 to a force of over
sixty by the end of that year. Jury
harassment of the Left is also
growing rapidly. For the most
part, lacking evidence, the Grand
Juries have been used for
harassment of and information
gathering on the more prominent
individuals and organizations of
the Left.
Police Activities
New police activities, often
borrowing heavily from military
tactics first developed in Vietnam,
are being funded by state and
national governments. A large part
of the money for the domestic
pacification program has been
channeled through the Law
Enforcement Assistance
Administration (LEAA). Created
by an obscure passage in the 1968
Omnibus Crime Bill, LEAA has
burgeoned under Nixon auspices
into a major government agency,
pumping millions of dollars into
local police forces.
Under the guise of modernizing
the police departments, this
money is being used to arm police
with M-16's, armored personnel
carriers, helicopters and other
assorted military devices. LEAA is
also bringing the psychological
operations of Vietnam into our
lives. LEAA funds are being used
for a wide variety of behavior
modification schemes." Ranging
from drug research to
psychosurgery, these techniques
are now being tested on prisoners
and mental patients with the
purported aim of turning them
into "normal and useful" (or
homogenized) human beings. The
California Council on Criminal
Justice, which is 90 percent
funded by LEAA, has recently
approved such a program to be
operated out of UCLA with
experimentation done at various
prisons around the state.
The important thing is that all
of these are being formalized and
legitimized; they are becoming
part of the natural order in our
country. What we have to see next
is the position of the Stanford
community in all this.
