The 750 Four.
If power corrupts, you'll love being corrupted by the Honda 750
Four. It's sheer power beautifully put together in a streamlined
package. The four-cylinder overhead cam, transversely mounted
engine makes other manufacturers green with envy. It delivers
enough horses for a fantastic top speed. And quick off the line? Just
don't blink or you'll miss it. There are four carbs and four tuned
pipes to go with the four cylinders. And those carbs are positive
control racing type. They use a cable throttle system which makes
them more responsive, better for performance. The famous
hydraulic disc brake on the front wheel has been improved.
