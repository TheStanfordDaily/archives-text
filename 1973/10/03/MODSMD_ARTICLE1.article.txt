# Federal Fund Release Revives Frenchman's Terrace Project
## 
### GLENN KRAMON 
The Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) has listed
Frenchman's Terrace, a 225-unit,
low-to-moderate income housing
project on University land, as a project
likely to receive funding in the wake
of President Nixon's recent
expenditure authorization for 200,000

units of new and existing housing.
HUD's San Francisco office had
held in abeyance the project's
"application for feasibility," a vital
step in securing the federal funds,
since Nixon's moratorium on new
housing began Jan. 5.
Alan Maremont, housing
coordinator for the Stanford

Mid-Peninsula Urban Coalition, which
is sponsoring the Frenchman's Terrace
project, said he received word of the
HUD move last Friday in a
Washington, D.C. meeting with
Department official Daniel Kearney.
"Back To Life'
The HUD decision "brings the
project back to life" by permitting the
renewal of the Frenchman's Terrace
application for $5,000,000 in federal
funds, Maremont said.
Frenchman's Terrace, located on 20
acres of hilly land at the comer of
Peter Coutts and Page Mill Roads just
above the College Terrace residential
area, would be composed of 40
percent middle income, 40 percent
moderate income, and 20 percent low
income housing under federal income
guidelines. Priority for half of the
units will be given to employees of the
University or of firms on University
land.
Land values in the area are
sufficiently high that any low-income
housing must be subsidized by the
federal government.
University Vice President Robert R.
Augsburger, one of several University
officials involved both in the drive to
reobtain funding and in the project's
design, said "We're pleased to hear the
news and hope the Coalition will be
able to proceed with the project
soon."
Still Questions
He noted that "Several important
questions remain to be resolved,
however." One such problem is "the
financial viability of the project in the
face of inflated building costs."
Maremont observed that the delay
caused by the funding moratorium
"could mean as much as a seven-10
percent increase in construction
costs." But he added that he believes
HUD has taken into account that the
cost per unit will be higher than nine
months ago, and will provide the
difference.
Another unresolved question — the
annexation of the site by the City of
Palo Alto — "should be resolved fairly

quickly," according to Palo Alto
Mayor Kirke Comstock.
Comstock said that a major
stumbling block for annexation, the
issue of traffic congestion at the
intersection of Stanford Avenue and
Bowdoin Street, had been resolved by
the Finance and Public Works
Committee of the Palo Alto City
Council.
The committee has suggested
barriers and detours to ease the impact
of traffic which the City Council
approved on Sept. 4.
Both University officials and the
Palo Alto City Council must petition
again for annexation, because the City
Council indefinitely postponed the
proposal last Jan. 29, because of the
federal funding freeze.

yesterday that it would reapply for five million dollars in federal funds in order

news and hope the Coalition will be
able to proceed with the project
soon."
Still Questions
He noted that "Several important
questions remain to be resolved,
however." One such problem is "the
financial viability of the project in the
face of inflated building costs."
Maremont observed that the delay
caused by the funding moratorium
"could mean as much as a seven-10
percent increase in construction
costs." But he added that he believes
HUD has taken into account that the
cost per unit will be higher than nine
months ago, and will provide the
difference.
Another unresolved question — the
annexation of the site by the City of
Palo Alto — "should be resolved fairly

quickly," according to Palo Alto
Mayor Kirke Comstock.
Comstock said that a major
stumbling block for annexation, the
issue of traffic congestion at the
intersection of Stanford Avenue and
Bowdoin Street, had been resolved by
the Finance and Public Works
Committee of the Palo Alto City
Council.
The committee has suggested
barriers and detours to ease the impact
of traffic which the City Council
approved on Sept. 4.
Both University officials and the
Palo Alto City Council must petition
again for annexation, because the City
Council indefinitely postponed the
proposal last Jan. 29, because of the
federal funding freeze.


PROPOSED SITE Hie Stanford Mid-Peninsula Urban Coalition announced
yesterday that it would reapply for five million dollars in federal funds in order
to begin construction on the 225-unit mixed income Frenchman's Terrace
housing project, shown above in the area labeled 'Establish P-C District."
The Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD) has listed
Frenchman's Terrace, a 225-unit,
low-to-moderate income housing
project on University land, as a project
likely to receive funding in the wake
of President Nixon's recent
expenditure authorization for 200,000

units of new and existing housing.
HUD's San Francisco office had
held in abeyance the project's
"application for feasibility," a vital
step in securing the federal funds,
since Nixon's moratorium on new
housing began Jan. 5.
Alan Maremont, housing
coordinator for the Stanford

Mid-Peninsula Urban Coalition, which
is sponsoring the Frenchman's Terrace
project, said he received word of the
HUD move last Friday in a
Washington, D.C. meeting with
Department official Daniel Kearney.
"Back To Life'
The HUD decision "brings the
project back to life" by permitting the
renewal of the Frenchman's Terrace
application for $5,000,000 in federal
funds, Maremont said.
Frenchman's Terrace, located on 20
acres of hilly land at the comer of
Peter Coutts and Page Mill Roads just
above the College Terrace residential
area, would be composed of 40
percent middle income, 40 percent
moderate income, and 20 percent low
income housing under federal income
guidelines. Priority for half of the
units will be given to employees of the
University or of firms on University
land.
Land values in the area are
sufficiently high that any low-income
housing must be subsidized by the
federal government.
University Vice President Robert R.
Augsburger, one of several University
officials involved both in the drive to
reobtain funding and in the project's
design, said "We're pleased to hear the
news and hope the Coalition will be
able to proceed with the project
soon."
