## Legal Threats To Press Freedom 
### 
a bill everÂ«

Two recent threats to liberty
of the press show what a frail reed
the First Amendment is, as it is
now interpreted by the courts.
The Pittsburgh Press case and the
Miami Herald case demonstrate
that the only effective shield of
free publication is an absolutist
interpretation of the First
Amendment coupled with a
general defense of a society based
on voluntary arrangements.
The U.S. Supreme Court
decided the case of Pittsburgh
Press Company v. The Pittsburgh
Commision on Human Relations
last June. The majority of the

court held that governmental
policy could rightly tell a
newspaper how to organize the
information it published, in this
instance, by forbidding "male"
and "female" groupings in the
paper's want-ads.
The dissenting justices took
vigorously libertarian positions.
William O. Douglas wrote that
"there can be no valid law
censoring the press or punishing it
for publishing its views or the
views of subscribers or customers
who express their ideas in letters
to the editor or in want ads or in
other commercial space." Douglas
stated flatly that he believed that
commercial materials in
newspapers have full First
Amendment protection.
Potter Stewart's dissent took a
strong stance in favor of freedom
of the press: "So far as I know,
this is the first case in this or any
other American court that permits
a government agency to enter a
composing room of a newspaper
and dictate to the publisher the
layout and makeiip of the
newspaper's pages."
Stewart went on to affirm an
absolutist interpretation of the
First Amendment and to denounce
the , "balancing" view which
subordinates First Amendment
rights to the desires of the
government. "So long as members
of this court view the First
Amendment as no more than a set
of 'values' to be balanced against
other 'values,' that Amendment
will remain in grave jeopardy. . . .
"After this decision, I see no
reason why the government
cannot force a newspaper
publisher to conform in the same
way in order to achieve other
goals thought socially desirable.
And if the government can dictate
the layout of a newspaper's
classified advertising pages today,
what is there to prevent it from
dictating the layout of the news
pages tomorrow?"
In July, the Florida Supreme
Court upheld, in a case involving

the Miami Herald, a Florida law
requiring newspapers to give equal
rebuttal space and billing to
political <scandidates whom the
newspapers criticize or whom
others criticize in the papers' news
or editorial columns. The
government would, in effect,
become the newspaper's managing
editor for political news.
As Thomas Emerson of the
Yale Law School put it,"It means
the government can tell the
newspapers that the newspapers
can be forced to print material
they don't want to print."
Criticizing a similar rebuttal
plan, Supreme Court Justice
Douglas wrote: "The sturdy
people who fashioned the First
Amendment would be shocked at
that intrusion of government into
a field which in this nation has
been reserved for individuals."
Of course, what the Florida
Supreme Court was attempting to
do was to extend the government's
powers over the broadcasting
media to the relatively
uncontrolled print media.
Broadcasters and listeners have
long been victims of a rebuttal
plan, the outrageously
anti-libertarian "fairness doctrine"
regulating radio and TV.
This fairness doctrine was most
recently used to silence a radio
station run by fundamentalist
minister Carl Mclntire, who favors
total victory over godless
communism. The gagging of
Mclntire was denounced at the
time in a dissent by liberal Judge
David Bazelon and subsequently
by radical journalist Nat Hentoff
in the pages of the magazine of
the American Civil Liberties
Union. Mclntire has now set up an
unregulated and unlicensed radio
station, broadcasting from
international waters off the coast
of New Jersey.
The problem in the Miami
Herald case and the problem with
the fairness doctrine is the same.
As Congress's foremost civil
libertarian Sen. Sam Ervin argues,

"forcing people to broadcast or
print things they don't believe in"
violates the First Amendment.
The ultimate solution is to get
the government totallly out. The
newspaper publisher has his
printing press and ink and paper.
The newspaper reader has his
fifteen cents. They barter fair and
square. It's none of the
government's business how
obscene or ideologically
subversive the printed material is.
Similarly, the broadcaster has
his equipment. He is operating on
a certain airwave frequency. The
listener has his receiving set. As
Michael Gartner has eloquently
argued in the March 1972 Juris
Doctor, whether the broadcast
material is advertisements for
cigarettes or rock music
drug use, it is none of
the government's business.
We need to get back, as Justice
Douglas suggests, to the doctrines
of liberty and natural rights. A
newspaper publisher must have a
clear and free entitlement to
publish; a broadcaster must have a
similar property right on his
specific frequency.
The First Amendment
prohibition of governmental
control of the media must be
considered an absolute
prohibition and must be joined to
a general restoration of the
inalienable rights to life, liberty
and the pursuit of happiness. The
only alternative is tyranny.
