Concern For Chile
Editor:
(This is a copy of the letter sent
to all Northern California
Congressmen and Senators
expressing our feelings on the
matter.)
College students were among
the first to recognize the nature of
U.S. involvement in Indochina.
Now, we again look in dismay at
another tragic venture of U.S.
foreign policy: the policies which
culminated in the overthrow and
death of Salvador Allende. Even if
the conflict in Chile does not lead
to the involvement of 500,000
American ground troops, we are
concerned.
We are sad that a popular
government aimed at improving
the living conditions of Chile's
poor has been snuffed out. We are
distressed that the military junta
seems to be emulating the
extremely repressive Brazilian
government in its treatment of the
political opposition. We are angry
that our government and
multinational corporations based
in the United States seem to have
played a key role in creating the
conditions which made a coup
possible, if not inevitable.
We call upon you to undertake
three things. First, to fully
investigate U.S. policy — and the
activities of U.S. corporations —
in Chile. Whether or not the CIA
was active in the actual coup is
not important. What is important

is that the U.S. seems to have
built up Allende's opposition and
strangled the Chilean economy
with the goal of undermining, if
not overthrowing, Allende.
Furthermore, U.S. foreign
economic policy, over many
decades, created a situation in
which Chile was addicated to
economic inputs from the United
States.
Second, to cut off aid to the
Chilean junta. Over the years the
U.S. has designed its military and
police assistance to build up a
leadership friendly to the interests
of the U.S.-based multinational
corporations. Now, unless
prevented by Congress, that aid
will aid those people in
maintaining power, brutally and
unconstitutionally.
Third, to pursue whatever
avenues possible to discourage the
killing and imprisonment of the
Chilean supporters of the Allende
government and refugees from
other military dictatorships who
are now in Chile.
We look forward to receiving
your response.

Incompetence
Editor:
I was glad to read that FCC did
not behave, at least for the time
being, as irresponsibly as the
KZSU disc jockeys wanted it to.

(Sept. 26 Daily).
As an ex-radio amateur, I can
understand why these people
want to increase their power,
(first by a factor of 300, and now
a modest 50 times), but what I do
not understand is why should
they run their experiment on a
public institution and fight
another student run public station
in the meanwhile. What about
changing their frequency and
going to court against KCBS? Or
maybe this is a new way of
conserving energy and air waves!
According to KZSU, which
admits the present interference
problem but cannot figure out
how much more there will be, a
significant part of the Stanford
community cannot be reached by
the present 6 mile radius. Not
including the overseas campuses
or the Stanford Alumni in the east
coast, can they figure out how
significant this lucky portion of
our community is, and how many
of thom are missing KZSU with
deep regret?
Let somebody in the
administration have enough
courage to admit that something
went wront somewhere, before
the $40,000 fee was collected.

F.S. What about boosting KZSU's
programming from a teenage rock
station to a more meaningful
format! After all, it does not
require FCC's permission and will
not interfere with anybody.
