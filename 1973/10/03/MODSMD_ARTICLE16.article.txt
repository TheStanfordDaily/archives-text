# Baez Provides Music For A Sunny Afternoon
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Frost Amphitheater was
transformed into a sea of 10,000
faces as a capacity crowd gathered
Sunday for an afternoon of
sunshine and the musical politics
of Joan Baez.

Baez provided an enjoyable
afternoon of music, liberally
spiced with her political views.
But she neglected to sing many of
the folk and protest songs for
which she is well-known.
Politically, however, she

covered all the bases. Between
songs she offered brief comments
on such issues as the farmworkers'
struggle, the recent military
takeover in Chile, freedom for
political prisoners, and the impact
of the Vietnam War on the
philosophy of non-violence.
However, Baez's audience expects
political threads to be heavily
interwoven with the fabric of her
music.
Her appearance in a long
purple halter dress may have
surprised some fans who recall her
"tomboy" days. "It's my new
Veronica Lake image," she
explained, shedding the white
shirt-jacket that set off her
bronzed face and dark hair. "I'll
try to keep my clothes on this
time — that's for the newcomers."
Baez's entrance brought the
crowd to its feet, and she
launched immediately into "Ain't
Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me
Around" in a vibrant, full-bodied
voice that required only the
rhythmic clapping of the audience
for accompaniment.
Baez, who attended high
school in Palo Alto, reminisced
about her ninth grade days "400
years ago" by singing "Earth
Angel" and "Honey Love," the
first songs she ever sang to a large
audience at a high school
assembly.
Baez relaxed with the
audience, sparking laughter with
uncanny imitations of Edith and

Archie Bunker. She mimicked
Bob Dylan's voice on "Ride Me
High," and carried on both ends
of a conversation between a
chauvinistic husband and his
unliberated wife as she talk-sang
through "Where are you Going,
My Honey My Lamb?".
In keeping with her preference
for "loose" concerts, Baez
answered a few requests from the
audience and selected songs at
random without adhering to a
pre-arranged program. She spent a
lot of time tuning her guitar,
occasionally enlisting the aid of
those in the audience with
"perfect pitch."
The crowd reserved its most
enthusiastic reactions for such
golden folk oldies as "Kumbaya"
and"I Shall Be Released."
"Blessed Are" and "Sweet Sir
Gallahad" received a warm
welcome.
But the "mellow" mob was
just beginning to come to life
when Baez abruptly left the stage.
She returned to the mike to end
the concert on a spiritual note
with an encore of "Amazing
Grace."
Throughout the concert, Baez
attempted to awaken the political
consciousness of her audience.
She sang several songs in Spanish,
dedicating various numbers to the
farmworkers, a Chilean poet, and
members of the Chile junta who
are "horrified by what they're

doing and unable to stop it."
She told the audience that
religion can be "very dangerous
like any heavy drug," but
delivered "Oh Happy Day" with
intense spirituality.
She plugged the Institute for
Non- Violence and Amnesty
International, telling "those who
get bored with school in the first
week" that "we have lots of work
for you to do."
As Baez sings "Help Us Raze
the Prisons to the Ground" or
commemorates slain farmworker
Juan De La Cruz in song, one
senses a real committment behind
her pure, expressive voice.
But did Baez's political
convictions reach a lethargic
audience that seemed primarily
bent on enjoying a fine afternoon
of music and sunshine? Baez
herself remarked, "We have been
so brutalized by the Vietnam war
that we can look at a picture of
anything and not see it or feel it."
The audience reacted to Baez
as if looking at a picture, largely
without feeling the political
intensity she tried desperately to
transmit.
Yet it was an idyllic afternoon
in Frost Amphitheater, despite
the intrusion of a low-flying jet
overhead. "I hope it's one of
ours," shouted a voice from the
audience.
"I hope it's not one of ours,"
Baez replied.

HELPING HANDS — Two girls who assisted Joan Baez by holding up
a sheet of lyrics were the only persons to share the stage with her at
Sunday's concert. Although it was rumored that singer Mimi Farinr
would join her sister briefly on stage she did not appear at the
concert.

INTENSE COMMITMENT — The pacifistic attitude of Joar. Baez
extended to her Sunday afternoon audience in Frost Amphitheater.
According to ASSU Special Events manager Dan Scher, there wac
some pressure from gatecrashers at the sellout concert, but there were
none of the problems evident at last year's Miles Davis disaster.
