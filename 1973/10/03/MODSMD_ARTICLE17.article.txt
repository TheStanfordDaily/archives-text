## Out Of Position? 
### Stan Wilson 
Any Stanford football fan who has followed the career of
injury-prone running back John Winesberry over the past three
seasons must have asked himself whether or not Winesberry should
have been playing running back at all this fall.
The talented athlete from Tulsa, Oklahoma, has split his time
between the doctor's office and the playing field during his
abbreviated three-year career. This fall I found myself cringing each
time the slender senior was jarred by a 250 pound defensive lineman,
wondering when the blow would come that would end his collegiate
football career.
That blow came last Saturday against San Jose State, in what may
or may not have been a "cheap shot," and when the smoke had
cleared, Wines lay injured with torn ligaments. "I've never been in so
much pain in my life," Wines said while recovering from knee surgery
in his hospital bed Monday afternoon. Dr. Fred Behling, who
performed the operation, explained that it went well and would not
affect John's ability to play professional football, if he chooses to do
so. That career would almost certainly be as a wide receiver.
Wines' qualifications as a wide receiver are indisputable — he
combines 9.7 speed with good quickness and sure hands. As a
sophomore flanker he made 45 receptions, including eight in the Rose
Bowl win over Michigan, and averaged over 14 yards each time he
touched the ball.
Last season he was moved to running back, because as coach Jack
Christiansen explained, "We want to get him the ball as often as
possible, and we expect a better percentage completing handoffs than

passes."
Winesberry concurred in the
coaches' decision, explaining that
"I played flanker as a sophomore
with the understanding that I
would move back to running back
as a junior." He refused to
"second guess" about how his
collegiate career might have gone
had he stayed at the wide receiver
position, explaining that most of
his mishaps were non-contact
injuries.
"I carried the ball 29 times
against West Virginia last year —
n.y only injury came when I got a
cleat caught while blocking," he
said. Besides this ankle injury,
Wines suffered a knee injury his
sophomore season, and suffered a
broken bone in his hand during a
practice session this fall.
The question arises over
whether or not Wines would still
be healthy today had he stayed at
the flanker spot. Should Wines'
injuries (whether or not they were
"hard-luck" occurrences) have
been taken into consideration by
the coaching staff when the
decision was made to play him at
running back.
"You can second guess
yourself, but I made the decision
and I'll just have to live with it,"
Wines said. The fleet-footed
Winesberry averaged nearly
four-and-a-half yards per carry as
a running back.
It seems, then, that when
Winesberry's talents in relation to
the fortunes of the Stanford
football team are considered, the
decision was a sound one; but
when we stop to consider John
Winesberry as an individual and
his football future, we may come
up with a different answer.

with the understanding that I
would move back to running back
as a junior." He refused to
"second guess" about how his
collegiate career might have gone
had he stayed at the wide receiver
position, explaining that most of
his mishaps were non-contact
injuries.
"I carried the ball 29 times
against West Virginia last year —
n.y only injury came when I got a
cleat caught while blocking," he
said. Besides this ankle injury,
Wines suffered a knee injury his
sophomore season, and suffered a
broken bone in his hand during a
practice session this fall.
The question arises over
whether or not Wines would still
be healthy today had he stayed at
the flanker spot. Should Wines'
injuries (whether or not they were
"hard-luck" occurrences) have
been taken into consideration by
the coaching staff when the
decision was made to play him at
running back.
"You can second guess
yourself, but I made the decision
and I'll just have to live with it,"
Wines said. The fleet-footed
Winesberry averaged nearly
four-and-a-half yards per carry as
a running back.
It seems, then, that when
Winesberry's talents in relation to
the fortunes of the Stanford
football team are considered, the
decision was a sound one; but
when we stop to consider John
Winesberry as an individual and
his football future, we may come
up with a different answer.
Any Stanford football fan who has followed the career of
injury-prone running back John Winesberry over the past three
seasons must have asked himself whether or not Winesberry should
have been playing running back at all this fall.
The talented athlete from Tulsa, Oklahoma, has split his time
between the doctor's office and the playing field during his
abbreviated three-year career. This fall I found myself cringing each
time the slender senior was jarred by a 250 pound defensive lineman,
wondering when the blow would come that would end his collegiate
football career.
That blow came last Saturday against San Jose State, in what may
or may not have been a "cheap shot," and when the smoke had
cleared, Wines lay injured with torn ligaments. "I've never been in so
much pain in my life," Wines said while recovering from knee surgery
in his hospital bed Monday afternoon. Dr. Fred Behling, who
performed the operation, explained that it went well and would not
affect John's ability to play professional football, if he chooses to do
so. That career would almost certainly be as a wide receiver.
Wines' qualifications as a wide receiver are indisputable — he
combines 9.7 speed with good quickness and sure hands. As a
sophomore flanker he made 45 receptions, including eight in the Rose
Bowl win over Michigan, and averaged over 14 yards each time he
touched the ball.
Last season he was moved to running back, because as coach Jack
Christiansen explained, "We want to get him the ball as often as
possible, and we expect a better percentage completing handoffs than

passes."
Winesberry concurred in the
coaches' decision, explaining that
"I played flanker as a sophomore

would move back to running back
