# Jena Will Replace Wines; Blanchard Doubtful For Illini
## 
### 
Doug Jena, a 6-1, 190 pound
9enior from Inglewood, will
replace injured John Winesberry
in the Stanford back field
Saturday when the Cards meet
Dlinois in a regionally televised
game at Champaign, 111.
Jena played mostly as a backup
man to Winesberry last year but
gained valuable experience when
Wines missed several games due to
an ankle injury. Jena averaged 4.2
yards on 36 carries, caught nine
passes and threw a 24-yard pass to
Don Alvarado in 1972.
Sophomore Sig Ostrom and
freshman Ron Inge may also see
some action at running back
Saturday. "We'd like to get
Ostrom and Inge in the game at
some time," Stanford coach Jack
Christiansen said yesterday. "You
never know about injuries and
we'd like to give them some
experience."

Jena, who has gained 31 yards
on six carries so far this year, will
join an old high school adversary
in the Card backfield. Fullback
Scott Laidlaw played against
Jena's Inglewood team when he
was at Hawthorne High School in
Inglewood.
* * *
Saturday's game will be
televised both on the Pacific Coast
and in the Midwest. Game time is
2:50 p.m. CDT (12:50 p.m. PDT).
The unusually late starting time
represents an effort to avoid
television conflict with the major
league baseball playoffs.
* * *
Other than Winesberry, free
safety Doc Blanchard is the only
starter on the Cardinal injury list.
Blanchard suffered a dislocated
toe Saturday against San Jose
State and missed practice Monday
and Tuesday. Christiansen

indicated that he might be back in
pads today and was a "possible"
starter against Illinois. Craig
Zaltosky will start at free safety if
Blanchard isn't ready.

Christiansen has named Glen
Stone, Roger Stillwell and
Zaltosky as Saturday's game
captains.
