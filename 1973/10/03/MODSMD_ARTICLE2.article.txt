# Stanford, P.A. Meet In Liaison Committee
## 
### BOB LOWE 
Touching upon such varied topics
as recreation programs, public
transportation, personnel exchanges
and public meetings, the new
Stanford-Palo Alto liaison committee
met for the first time yesterday
afternoon in a session closed to the
public.
The committee is composed of top
level officials of the University and the
City of Palo Alto. University Vice
President Robert Augsburger, Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons and
Director of Facilities and Property
James Nelson, all Stanford members of
the committee.
City Manager George Sipel and
Assistant Managers Warren Deverel and
Charles Walker are the Palo Alto
committeemen.
According to Augsburger, the
overall "thrust of the committee is
finding areas of cooperation." He said
that the committee is a much needed
avenue of communication and that "in
the hustle and bustle of day-to-day
business, we [Stanford and Palo Alto]
sometimes forget about
communicating."
In yesterday's meeting, according
to Sipel, the committee decided that it
would meet at least once a month. The
location will alternate between the
University and the city and the
chairmanship will alternate between

Sipel and Augsburger.
Sipel said that the committee also
agreed to publish minutes, which will
be available the day following the
meeting. (The minutes of the first
meeting, however, will not be available
until next Monday.) But, he added, "A
few items might be left out if they are
confidential."
The possibility of opening some
meetings to the public was also
discussed. Sipel said that there may be
occasions for public meetings, but that
the decision would be made on a "case
by case basis."
The University and the city
discussed a number of present and
future projects. Among the projects
were Frenchman's Terrace (see article
on this page), the city's comprehensive
plan, and College Terrace traffic
control.
Employees Exchanged
"We would explore where each of
us has needs in which the other might
appropriately be involved," he said.
Employees from one institution with a
certain type of skill would be loaned
to the other for help in that area.
In the past several years, plans for
liaison committees have been blocked,
mainly due to Stanford's insistence on
secrecy in the meetings.
The Brown Act, California's
anti-secrecy law, prohibits Palo Alto
City councilmen from assemblying
together in any non-public meeting.
Accordingly, the city had been forced
to turn down University proposals for
liaison committees.
Last May, Palo Alto Mayor Kirke
W. Comstock initiated meetings with
University President Richard Lyman
to discuss the feasibility of a liaison
committee. In July they announced
the plan for the present committee
which is composed of staff members,
thus avoiding the restriction of the
Brown Act.
Secrecy Necessary
Augsburger said that the University
is concerned over the secrecy of
discussions centering on the "kind of
thing where it is sensitive and effects
third parties." Specifically, he said
that secrecy is necessary when it is the
"third party who might get hurt."
Augsburger said that situations such
as an organization seeking to locate in
the Stanford community, which
wanted it's intentions unpublicized,
might be a reason for secrecy.
He added that in matters which
have an effect on Stanford or city
employees, it would be to no one's
interest for "exploratory
sessions... to be out in the public
domain."

There will be an important
staff lunch today at noon. Photos
for press cards will be taken.

committeemen.
According to Augsburger, the
overall "thrust of the committee is
finding areas of cooperation." He said
that the committee is a much needed
avenue of communication and that "in
the hustle and bustle of day-to-day
business, we [Stanford and Palo Alto]
sometimes forget about
communicating."
In yesterday's meeting, according
to Sipel, the committee decided that it
would meet at least once a month. The
location will alternate between the
University and the city and the
chairmanship will alternate between

Sipel and Augsburger.
Sipel said that the committee also
agreed to publish minutes, which will
be available the day following the
meeting. (The minutes of the first
meeting, however, will not be available
until next Monday.) But, he added, "A
few items might be left out if they are
confidential."
The possibility of opening some
meetings to the public was also
discussed. Sipel said that there may be
occasions for public meetings, but that
the decision would be made on a "case
by case basis."
The University and the city
discussed a number of present and
future projects. Among the projects
were Frenchman's Terrace (see article
on this page), the city's comprehensive
plan, and College Terrace traffic
control.
Employees Exchanged
"We would explore where each of
us has needs in which the other might
appropriately be involved," he said.
Employees from one institution with a
certain type of skill would be loaned
to the other for help in that area.
In the past several years, plans for
liaison committees have been blocked,
mainly due to Stanford's insistence on
secrecy in the meetings.
The Brown Act, California's
anti-secrecy law, prohibits Palo Alto
City councilmen from assemblying
together in any non-public meeting.
Accordingly, the city had been forced
to turn down University proposals for
liaison committees.
Last May, Palo Alto Mayor Kirke
W. Comstock initiated meetings with
University President Richard Lyman
to discuss the feasibility of a liaison
committee. In July they announced
the plan for the present committee
which is composed of staff members,
thus avoiding the restriction of the
Brown Act.
Secrecy Necessary
Augsburger said that the University
is concerned over the secrecy of
discussions centering on the "kind of
thing where it is sensitive and effects
third parties." Specifically, he said
that secrecy is necessary when it is the
"third party who might get hurt."
Augsburger said that situations such
as an organization seeking to locate in
the Stanford community, which
wanted it's intentions unpublicized,
might be a reason for secrecy.
He added that in matters which
have an effect on Stanford or city
employees, it would be to no one's
interest for "exploratory
sessions... to be out in the public
domain."

There will be an important
staff lunch today at noon. Photos
for press cards will be taken.
Touching upon such varied topics
as recreation programs, public
transportation, personnel exchanges
and public meetings, the new
Stanford-Palo Alto liaison committee
met for the first time yesterday
afternoon in a session closed to the
public.
The committee is composed of top
level officials of the University and the
City of Palo Alto. University Vice
President Robert Augsburger, Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons and
Director of Facilities and Property
James Nelson, all Stanford members of
the committee.
City Manager George Sipel and
Assistant Managers Warren Deverel and
Charles Walker are the Palo Alto
committeemen.
