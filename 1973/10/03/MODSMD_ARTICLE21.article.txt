## Mustachioed A's Will Win The Series 
### Don Tollefson 
In case you didn't realize it, all males with
long hair are sissies. This long-overdue
proclamation was made earlier this year by a
Texas high school football coach who should
be named the winner of the H.R. Haldeman
Pruning Shears Award for service to his
country.
Unfortunately, there are countless athletes
more successful than this builder of men
whose hair lengths belie his rule of thumb.
Perhaps he has spent the last five years living
in a desert rat's hole, because there's no other
reasonable explanation for overlooking the
invasion of long hairs into big time athletics.
One need look no farther than Stanford's
two successive Rose Bowl championship
teams to realize that long hair and athletic
success are certainly compatible. And almost
every other major sport has had long-haired
stars in recent years and this year's AAU
Weightlifting Championship included at least
one pony-tailed champion.
Yet for many years, one sport seemed to
be successfully fighting off the long-haired
aliens. Baseball, the biggest competition
Sominex has ever had, seemed to be the last
sanctuary of short hair. And then last year,
the unmentionable happened.

The mustachioed curly locks from Oakland
not only beat Billy Martin's battling Marines
from Detroit for the American League
pennant, but also went on to stun the
Cincinnati Reds in the World Series. Many a
Hall-of-Famer must have turned over in his
grave.
A's owner Charlie Finley, the insurance
millionaire and sports freak who has been
frequently chastised for turning the grand old
game into a circus, could thumb his nose at
the old guard. With their mule mascot and
their multi-colored uniforms, the A's had
proven that a team can win the World Series
without quasi-military discipline. All you need
is talent.
This year, the A's will get a chance to
prove that last year wasn't a fluke and their
opposition will most likely again come from
Cincinnati's Big Red Machine. Both teams
have to get through their league playoffs
again, but I'm willing to stick my long
hair-covered neck out again and predict that
both will.
The Reds should have an easy time of it
against the New York Mets, who went from
last place in late August to win the National
League East pennant on Monday. The Mets
have Rusty Staub, Cleon Jones, Jerry Grote

and Tom Seaver, but not much else. The two
teams should be evenly matched if half the
Reds get mugged when they visit the Big City.
Picking the A's over Baltimore is a bit
riskier, but I've always believed in being
adventuresome. Any team that has Brooks
Robinson at third base can cause trouble and
with help from Mark Belanger, a revitalized
Tommy Davis and pitchers Jim Palmer, Dave
McNally and Mike Cuellar, the Orioles ended
their season with a better record than the A's.
But I will again contend that the A's have
the best man-for-man lineup in baseball and
when the A's throw three successive twenty
game winners at the Orioles, they should have
a decided edge. Centerfielder Billy North, who
was hitting .289 with 53 stolen bases, is out of
the playoffs and perhaps the World Series
with an ankle injury, but remember that the
A's won the Series last year without superstar
Reggie Jackson.
Even if the A's don't win again this year,
their contribution to the game will live on.
This season you could see a little more color
in uniforms and a few more strands of hair
sneaking out from under caps. Let's thank the
A's for enlivening a game which was coming
dangerously close to a state of rigormortis.

when the A's throw three successive twenty
game winners at the Orioles, they should have
a decided edge. Centerfielder Billy North, who
was hitting .289 with 53 stolen bases, is out of
the playoffs and perhaps the World Series
with an ankle injury, but remember that the
A's won the Series last year without superstar
Reggie Jackson.
Even if the A's don't win again this year,
their contribution to the game will live on.
This season you could see a little more color
in uniforms and a few more strands of hair
sneaking out from under caps. Let's thank the
A's for enlivening a game which was coming
dangerously close to a state of rigormortis.
In case you didn't realize it, all males with
long hair are sissies. This long-overdue
proclamation was made earlier this year by a
Texas high school football coach who should
be named the winner of the H.R. Haldeman
Pruning Shears Award for service to his
country.
Unfortunately, there are countless athletes
more successful than this builder of men
whose hair lengths belie his rule of thumb.
Perhaps he has spent the last five years living
in a desert rat's hole, because there's no other
reasonable explanation for overlooking the
invasion of long hairs into big time athletics.
One need look no farther than Stanford's
two successive Rose Bowl championship
teams to realize that long hair and athletic
success are certainly compatible. And almost
every other major sport has had long-haired
stars in recent years and this year's AAU
Weightlifting Championship included at least
one pony-tailed champion.
Yet for many years, one sport seemed to
be successfully fighting off the long-haired
aliens. Baseball, the biggest competition
Sominex has ever had, seemed to be the last
sanctuary of short hair. And then last year,
the unmentionable happened.

The mustachioed curly locks from Oakland
not only beat Billy Martin's battling Marines
from Detroit for the American League
pennant, but also went on to stun the
Cincinnati Reds in the World Series. Many a
Hall-of-Famer must have turned over in his
grave.
A's owner Charlie Finley, the insurance
millionaire and sports freak who has been
frequently chastised for turning the grand old
game into a circus, could thumb his nose at
the old guard. With their mule mascot and
their multi-colored uniforms, the A's had
proven that a team can win the World Series
without quasi-military discipline. All you need
is talent.
This year, the A's will get a chance to
prove that last year wasn't a fluke and their
opposition will most likely again come from
Cincinnati's Big Red Machine. Both teams
have to get through their league playoffs
again, but I'm willing to stick my long
hair-covered neck out again and predict that
both will.
The Reds should have an easy time of it
against the New York Mets, who went from
last place in late August to win the National
League East pennant on Monday. The Mets
have Rusty Staub, Cleon Jones, Jerry Grote

and Tom Seaver, but not much else. The two
teams should be evenly matched if half the
Reds get mugged when they visit the Big City.
Picking the A's over Baltimore is a bit
riskier, but I've always believed in being
adventuresome. Any team that has Brooks
Robinson at third base can cause trouble and
with help from Mark Belanger, a revitalized
Tommy Davis and pitchers Jim Palmer, Dave
McNally and Mike Cuellar, the Orioles ended
their season with a better record than the A's.
But I will again contend that the A's have
the best man-for-man lineup in baseball and
when the A's throw three successive twenty
game winners at the Orioles, they should have
a decided edge. Centerfielder Billy North, who
was hitting .289 with 53 stolen bases, is out of
the playoffs and perhaps the World Series
