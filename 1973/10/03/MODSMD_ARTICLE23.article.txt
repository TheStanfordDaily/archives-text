Austria Rejects Meir Appeal
VIENNA — Chancellor Bruno Kreisky turned down a
dramatic personal appeal yesterday from Israeli Premier
Golda Meir that he reverse his decision to close group
transit facilities for Soviet Jewish emigrants.
Kreisky told newsmen after a IVi-hour meeting with
Meir that he had proposed as an alternative that the
United Nations be asked to assume responsibility for the
nearby Schoenau Castle transit camp for Soviet Jews en
route to Israel.
The Austrian government agreed last Saturday to close
the camp in return for the release of four hostages held by
two Palestinian terrorists. The decision prompted strong
protests from Israel and the sudden visit by Meir.
The Israeli premier, looking tired and grim last night at
Tel Aviv's Lod Airport after returning to Israel, said she
was"very sad" about the kidnap affair and its aftermath,
but added that the Austrian decision to close the camp
would not affect relations between the two countries.
"Israel does not believe in solving problems by
breaking relations. We will find another way," she said.
Vice Mayor Leads Atlanta Election
ATLANTA — Vice Mayor Maynard Jackson, seeking to
become this Southern city's first black mayor, swept to a
first place finish last night but faces a runoff against
incumbent Sam Massell later this month.
With all of the city's 193 precincts reporting, Jackson
had 47,041 votes for 47 percent. Massell trailed far behind
with 19,760 or 19.7 percent. Former Democratic
congressman Charles Weltner finished third with 18,946
for 18.9 percent.
The runoff will be held Oct. 16.
Officials estimated that less than half the city's
206,000 registered voters turned out to cast ballots in the
first citywide election since the blacks became the ethnic
majority in the city. About 51 per cent of the city is
black.
Jackson, 35, was the first black to win the No. 2 spot
in city government. He was Massell's running mate four
years ago when Massell became the city's first Jewish
mayor.
Weltner, the only Southern congressman to vote for
the Civil Rights Act of 1966, resigned from Congress in
1966.
Andrew Young, a black, was elected last year to
represent Weltner's former district which includes Atlanta.
Senate Passes Aid Measure
WASHINGTON — The Senate passed a $1.2 billion
foreign economic aid authorization bill yesterday after
refusing twice to make substantial cuts.
By a one-vote margin, the Senate turned down 47-46
an amendment by Sen. Frank Church, D-Idaho, to impose
a $1.1 billion limit on authorizations for the fiscal year

ending next June 30.
Rejected 67-23 was an amendment by Sen. J. W.
Fulbright, D-Ark., to cut the total authorization to $1
billion.
The 54 to 42 vote on final passage sends the bill to a
conference with the House, which included $1.6 billion in
economic aid in a combined $2.8 billion
military-economic aid package.
Nixon Sets Energy Controls
WASHINGTON — The Nixon administration imposed
government control yesterday on the distribution of
propane gas and reluctantly promised similar controls on
home heating oil within a few weeks.
John A. Love, director of the White House Energy
Policy Office, said imposition of "mandatory allocation"
may not avert fuel shortages this winter, butwould at least
distribute available supplies fairly.
He said the programs are needed "to ensure that no
home or hospital goes without adequate heat and no farm
is without adequate propane."
Heating oil is needed especially in the Northeast and
Upper Midwest where winters are severe, while propane is
vitally needed by farmers to dry crops and by residents of
many isolated or mobile homes.
The mandatory allocation programs are designed to
work primarily on the whole sale level, requiring fuel
distribution to past customers in proportion to what they
received last year.
Murder Suspects Captured
WASHINGTON — Two men sought in connection with
the mass slaying here last January to seven Hanafi
Moslems were arrested yesterday in Jacksonville, Fla., the
FBI said.
The suspects were identified as John Wesley Griffin,
28, and William Christian, 29, both formerly of
Philadelphia.
The men were among seven persons indicted by a
Washington grand jury in August in connection with the
slayings.
Griffin and Christian also were wanted in Philadelphia
on charges of armed bank robbery and kidnapping, the
FBI said.
Four of the suspects indicted by the grand jury in
connection with the Washington slaying already were in
custody.
They are Jerome Sinclair, 23; Theodore Moody, 20 and
John Willie Clark, 30, all of Philadelphia.
Today's Weather
Fair and warmer through tomorrow. Lows today in
mid 40s to low 50s. Highs today from 60s near coast to
the 70s inland and tomorrow from upper 60s to low 70s
near coast to mid to upper 80s inland. West to northwest

refusing twice to make substantial cuts.
By a one-vote margin, the Senate turned down 47-46
an amendment by Sen. Frank Church, D-Idaho, to impose
a $1.1 billion limit on authorizations for the fiscal year

ending next June 30.
Rejected 67-23 was an amendment by Sen. J. W.
Fulbright, D-Ark., to cut the total authorization to $1
billion.
The 54 to 42 vote on final passage sends the bill to a
conference with the House, which included $1.6 billion in
economic aid in a combined $2.8 billion
military-economic aid package.
Nixon Sets Energy Controls
WASHINGTON — The Nixon administration imposed
government control yesterday on the distribution of
propane gas and reluctantly promised similar controls on
home heating oil within a few weeks.
John A. Love, director of the White House Energy
Policy Office, said imposition of "mandatory allocation"
may not avert fuel shortages this winter, butwould at least
distribute available supplies fairly.
He said the programs are needed "to ensure that no
home or hospital goes without adequate heat and no farm
is without adequate propane."
Heating oil is needed especially in the Northeast and
Upper Midwest where winters are severe, while propane is
vitally needed by farmers to dry crops and by residents of
many isolated or mobile homes.
The mandatory allocation programs are designed to
work primarily on the whole sale level, requiring fuel
distribution to past customers in proportion to what they
received last year.
Murder Suspects Captured
WASHINGTON — Two men sought in connection with
the mass slaying here last January to seven Hanafi
Moslems were arrested yesterday in Jacksonville, Fla., the
FBI said.
The suspects were identified as John Wesley Griffin,
28, and William Christian, 29, both formerly of
Philadelphia.
The men were among seven persons indicted by a
Washington grand jury in August in connection with the
slayings.
Griffin and Christian also were wanted in Philadelphia
on charges of armed bank robbery and kidnapping, the
FBI said.
Four of the suspects indicted by the grand jury in
connection with the Washington slaying already were in
custody.
They are Jerome Sinclair, 23; Theodore Moody, 20 and
John Willie Clark, 30, all of Philadelphia.
Today's Weather
Fair and warmer through tomorrow. Lows today in
mid 40s to low 50s. Highs today from 60s near coast to
the 70s inland and tomorrow from upper 60s to low 70s
near coast to mid to upper 80s inland. West to northwest
wind 10 to 20 mph afternoons.
Austria Rejects Meir Appeal
VIENNA — Chancellor Bruno Kreisky turned down a
dramatic personal appeal yesterday from Israeli Premier
Golda Meir that he reverse his decision to close group
transit facilities for Soviet Jewish emigrants.
Kreisky told newsmen after a IVi-hour meeting with
Meir that he had proposed as an alternative that the
United Nations be asked to assume responsibility for the
nearby Schoenau Castle transit camp for Soviet Jews en
route to Israel.
The Austrian government agreed last Saturday to close
the camp in return for the release of four hostages held by
two Palestinian terrorists. The decision prompted strong
protests from Israel and the sudden visit by Meir.
The Israeli premier, looking tired and grim last night at
Tel Aviv's Lod Airport after returning to Israel, said she
was"very sad" about the kidnap affair and its aftermath,
but added that the Austrian decision to close the camp
would not affect relations between the two countries.
"Israel does not believe in solving problems by
breaking relations. We will find another way," she said.
Vice Mayor Leads Atlanta Election
ATLANTA — Vice Mayor Maynard Jackson, seeking to
become this Southern city's first black mayor, swept to a
first place finish last night but faces a runoff against
incumbent Sam Massell later this month.
With all of the city's 193 precincts reporting, Jackson
had 47,041 votes for 47 percent. Massell trailed far behind
with 19,760 or 19.7 percent. Former Democratic
congressman Charles Weltner finished third with 18,946
for 18.9 percent.
The runoff will be held Oct. 16.
Officials estimated that less than half the city's
206,000 registered voters turned out to cast ballots in the
first citywide election since the blacks became the ethnic
majority in the city. About 51 per cent of the city is
black.
Jackson, 35, was the first black to win the No. 2 spot
in city government. He was Massell's running mate four
years ago when Massell became the city's first Jewish
mayor.
Weltner, the only Southern congressman to vote for
the Civil Rights Act of 1966, resigned from Congress in
1966.
Andrew Young, a black, was elected last year to
represent Weltner's former district which includes Atlanta.

Austria Rejects Meir Appeal
VIENNA — Chancellor Bruno Kreisky turned down a
dramatic personal appeal yesterday from Israeli Premier
Golda Meir that he reverse his decision to close group
transit facilities for Soviet Jewish emigrants.
Kreisky told newsmen after a IVi-hour meeting with
Meir that he had proposed as an alternative that the
United Nations be asked to assume responsibility for the
nearby Schoenau Castle transit camp for Soviet Jews en
route to Israel.
The Austrian government agreed last Saturday to close
the camp in return for the release of four hostages held by
two Palestinian terrorists. The decision prompted strong
protests from Israel and the sudden visit by Meir.
The Israeli premier, looking tired and grim last night at
Tel Aviv's Lod Airport after returning to Israel, said she
was"very sad" about the kidnap affair and its aftermath,
but added that the Austrian decision to close the camp
would not affect relations between the two countries.
"Israel does not believe in solving problems by
breaking relations. We will find another way," she said.
Vice Mayor Leads Atlanta Election
ATLANTA — Vice Mayor Maynard Jackson, seeking to
become this Southern city's first black mayor, swept to a
first place finish last night but faces a runoff against
incumbent Sam Massell later this month.
With all of the city's 193 precincts reporting, Jackson
had 47,041 votes for 47 percent. Massell trailed far behind
with 19,760 or 19.7 percent. Former Democratic
congressman Charles Weltner finished third with 18,946
for 18.9 percent.
The runoff will be held Oct. 16.
Officials estimated that less than half the city's
206,000 registered voters turned out to cast ballots in the
first citywide election since the blacks became the ethnic
majority in the city. About 51 per cent of the city is
black.
Jackson, 35, was the first black to win the No. 2 spot
in city government. He was Massell's running mate four
years ago when Massell became the city's first Jewish
mayor.
Weltner, the only Southern congressman to vote for
the Civil Rights Act of 1966, resigned from Congress in
1966.
Andrew Young, a black, was elected last year to
represent Weltner's former district which includes Atlanta.
Senate Passes Aid Measure
WASHINGTON — The Senate passed a $1.2 billion
foreign economic aid authorization bill yesterday after
refusing twice to make substantial cuts.
By a one-vote margin, the Senate turned down 47-46
an amendment by Sen. Frank Church, D-Idaho, to impose
a $1.1 billion limit on authorizations for the fiscal year

ending next June 30.
Rejected 67-23 was an amendment by Sen. J. W.
Fulbright, D-Ark., to cut the total authorization to $1
billion.
The 54 to 42 vote on final passage sends the bill to a
conference with the House, which included $1.6 billion in
economic aid in a combined $2.8 billion
military-economic aid package.
Nixon Sets Energy Controls
WASHINGTON — The Nixon administration imposed
government control yesterday on the distribution of
propane gas and reluctantly promised similar controls on
home heating oil within a few weeks.
John A. Love, director of the White House Energy
Policy Office, said imposition of "mandatory allocation"
may not avert fuel shortages this winter, butwould at least
distribute available supplies fairly.
He said the programs are needed "to ensure that no
home or hospital goes without adequate heat and no farm
is without adequate propane."
Heating oil is needed especially in the Northeast and
Upper Midwest where winters are severe, while propane is
vitally needed by farmers to dry crops and by residents of
many isolated or mobile homes.
The mandatory allocation programs are designed to
work primarily on the whole sale level, requiring fuel
distribution to past customers in proportion to what they
received last year.
Murder Suspects Captured
WASHINGTON — Two men sought in connection with
the mass slaying here last January to seven Hanafi
Moslems were arrested yesterday in Jacksonville, Fla., the
FBI said.
The suspects were identified as John Wesley Griffin,
28, and William Christian, 29, both formerly of
Philadelphia.
The men were among seven persons indicted by a
Washington grand jury in August in connection with the
slayings.
Griffin and Christian also were wanted in Philadelphia
on charges of armed bank robbery and kidnapping, the
FBI said.
Four of the suspects indicted by the grand jury in
connection with the Washington slaying already were in
custody.
They are Jerome Sinclair, 23; Theodore Moody, 20 and
John Willie Clark, 30, all of Philadelphia.
