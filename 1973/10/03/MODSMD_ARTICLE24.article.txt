# Fire Department Modernizing
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
The Stanford Fire Department is
currently in the process of
modernizing and adding equipment,
but steps are occuring at irregular
intervals.
The department has just obtained a
Hurst rescue tool, is awaiting delivery
of two new pumpers, is hoping to
secure permission to purchase a new
light rescue unit and may eventually
take part in a Trauma Van program.
According to Chief Frank Jurian,
the department is now drawing up
specifications for the new recsue unit,
an easily maneuverable vehicle which
would carry "a resuscitator, first aid,
and a few fire fighting tools such as
extinguishers."
A previous request for a similar
vehicle was denied by Daniel

De Young, Plant Services director.
However, the department's existing
rescue vehicle, which has travelled over
79,000 miles, is now being repaired
and Juhan believes a new vehicle is
necessary.
The department also hopes to
convert one of their pumpers into
what Jurian calls a "heavy rescue
unit." This unit would carry such
items as saws, the Hurst tool, and
bottles of oxygen.
Jurian said the Hurst rescue tool,
which arrived last week, has been
nicknamed "the jaws of life." The tool
allows crews to bend car frames to
remove persons trapped in
automobiles after accidents much
more quickly than had previously been
possible.
All crews have now been trained to
use the tool, Jurian said.
Unfortunately, he added this was not
the case last Saturday, when two
persons were killed in an auto accident
near the intersection of Foothill Rd.
and Santa Maria Ave.
"The shift on duty was unfamiliar
with the use of the tool," Jurian said,
"so we had to rely on neighboring
departments."
The fire department will be able to
convert one pumper into the heavy
rescue unit when the new pumpers
arrive in late February or March.
The twin pumpers, which must be
custom made, take about one year to

be built. They cost $60,000 apiece and
will be able to pump 2000 gallons of
water per minute.
The fire department also may
participate in the Trauma Van
Program now in the planning stages.
Dr. Harry Kaplan of the Medical
Center presented his ideas for such a
van to a meeting of the Stanford, Palo
Alto, Woodside, Mountain View, and
Los Altos fire departments last week,
but, according to Jurian, no final plans
to go ahead with such a unit have yet
been made.

Los Altos fire departments last week,
but, according to Jurian, no final plans
to go ahead with such a unit have yet
been made.
The Stanford Fire Department is
currently in the process of
modernizing and adding equipment,
but steps are occuring at irregular
intervals.
The department has just obtained a
Hurst rescue tool, is awaiting delivery
of two new pumpers, is hoping to
secure permission to purchase a new
light rescue unit and may eventually
take part in a Trauma Van program.
According to Chief Frank Jurian,
the department is now drawing up
specifications for the new recsue unit,
an easily maneuverable vehicle which
would carry "a resuscitator, first aid,
and a few fire fighting tools such as
extinguishers."
A previous request for a similar
vehicle was denied by Daniel

De Young, Plant Services director.
However, the department's existing
rescue vehicle, which has travelled over
79,000 miles, is now being repaired
and Juhan believes a new vehicle is
necessary.
The department also hopes to
convert one of their pumpers into
what Jurian calls a "heavy rescue
unit." This unit would carry such
items as saws, the Hurst tool, and
bottles of oxygen.
Jurian said the Hurst rescue tool,
which arrived last week, has been
nicknamed "the jaws of life." The tool
allows crews to bend car frames to
remove persons trapped in
automobiles after accidents much
more quickly than had previously been
possible.
All crews have now been trained to
use the tool, Jurian said.
Unfortunately, he added this was not
the case last Saturday, when two
persons were killed in an auto accident
near the intersection of Foothill Rd.
and Santa Maria Ave.
"The shift on duty was unfamiliar
with the use of the tool," Jurian said,
"so we had to rely on neighboring
departments."
The fire department will be able to
convert one pumper into the heavy
rescue unit when the new pumpers
arrive in late February or March.
The twin pumpers, which must be
custom made, take about one year to

be built. They cost $60,000 apiece and
will be able to pump 2000 gallons of
water per minute.
The fire department also may
participate in the Trauma Van
Program now in the planning stages.
Dr. Harry Kaplan of the Medical
Center presented his ideas for such a
van to a meeting of the Stanford, Palo
Alto, Woodside, Mountain View, and
Los Altos fire departments last week,
but, according to Jurian, no final plans
to go ahead with such a unit have yet
been made.
