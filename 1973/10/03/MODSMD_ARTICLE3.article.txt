# Lyman Endorses Proposal For New Student Judicial System
## 
### 
President Richard Lyman last night endorsed the
Committee of 15 (C-15) proposal for a student majority
judicial system for the first time.
"Compromises satisfy no one completely, but I believe
this is as good a compromise as we can arrive at. I would
like to see the C-15 recommendation approved," Lyman
stated on Campus Conference, a KZSU Public Affairs
program.
Students will vote on the proposal in an October 10-11
referendum. ASSU President Kevin O'Grady and others
have opposed it because Lyman or a two-thirds vote of
the Faculty Senate could remove the one-student
majority.
The new system will supersede the current Campus
Judicial Panel (CJP) only if the student referendum,
Faculty Senate, and administration all approve it. Lyman
created the CJP two years ago, using his emergency
powers when other judicial machinery collapsed.
Cautious Support
The president had previously expressed cautious
support for the C-15 proposal but reserved final judgment
pending comment from students and faculty members.
The new system resembles the interim CJP in most
respects, employing an outside hearing officer to decide
factual issues and a student-faculty panel to hear legal
arguments and set penalties.

Responding to reporters' questions, Lyman generally
supported student evaluation of both junior and senior
faculty members and annual meetings between all
professors and their department chairmen.
C-AAA
The Committee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement (C-AAA) has recommended that
departments evaluate the teaching effectiveness of
professors seeking tenure, promotion, or salary increases
in these ways.
The C-AAA proposal ignited fierce debate last week in
the Faculty Senate, which will eventually pass on the
recommendations.
Lyman last night said "it wouldn't do any harm" to
require senior faculty members to meet with their
department heads annually, even if tenured professors do
not always need intensive review.
Such consultation is "essential" for junior faculty, who
cannot "work in a vacuum," Lyman feels.
The president also endorsed suggestions by James
Gibbs, Dean of Undergraduate Studies, that the senate
require several different methods of faculty evaluation,
rather than relying on one or two.
Lyman defended his call for increased tuition at public
universities and colleges, arguing that low public tuition
could price private institutions out of existence.
