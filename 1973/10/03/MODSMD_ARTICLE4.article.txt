# Skyrocketing Tuition Squeezes Student Hopes For Federal Aid
## 
### JANET SANDERS 
As the cost of living and college
tuition skyrocket, more and more
middle-income students are seeking
financial aid, but unfortunately
finding very little available for them
out of federal funds.
Students from families with
incomes beyond the $12,000 to
$15,000 range are almost entirely
excluded from four of the five
programs under the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare. Only
one program, Guaranteed Student
Loans (GSL), professes to be open to
all income groups.
The GSL program, however, now
has needs-analysis formulas to
determine who gets interest-subsidized
loans. The formulas, effective last
March, "tend to overstate what
middle-income parents can provide"
for their child's education, said Frank
Newman, Director of University
Relations.

According to financial director
Robert Huff, Stanford is using the
"most sensitive" of the three formulas
approved by the Office of Education.
"And we're taking steps to make it
more realistic in the future for
middle-income families," he added.
But in the meantime, "aid to
middle-income students is clearly a
problem," Huff said.
Nothing New
The federal government's failure to
provide for the middle-income student
is not new. But the oversight did not
seriously affect many students until
recently, when educational costs began
to squeeze those who had not
previously needed financial aid.
In the past year, Stanford's tuition
went up $285. Room and board for
dormitories jumped from $1,345 to
$1,425.
Although Congress has not cut
student aid and has even added a new
program called Basic Equal
Opportunity Grants (BEOG), "it
hasn't increased the funds along with
educational costs," said Huff.
Less Money
In fact, Stanford this year is
receiving less money for two of the
programs, Supplementary Equal
Opportunity Grants (SEOG) and
National Direct Student Loans
(NDSL).
Although both programs are funded
at the same level as last year, more
universities are receiving the money.
"The money pie is being spread
thinner," said Huff.
The University was given $100,000
less this year for SEOG and $300,000
less for NDSL. According to Huff, the
latter sum may be reduced as
repayments on old loans come in.
Since the financial aids office starts
with the neediest and works up the
income scale, those needy students at
the top of the scale will be the ones to
feel these reductions.
Not Enough
NDSL will not have enough funds
this year to provide for Stanford
students from families earning an
annual income over $12,000. SEOG
and College Work-Study will be
limited to those income groups under
$10,000 per year.
Huff hopes that the
newly-instituted BEOG program will
partially make up for the University's

loss of some SEOG funds.
But BEOG is only open to full-time
freshmen and does not have enough
money to grant more than $452 to a
student for a year.
Furthermore, the first BEO Grants
will not be received until January,
although Huff said University financial
aid is being advanced to those students
awaiting the federal grants in the
meantime..
Admissions Director Fred Hargadon
pointed out that the high price of a
Stanford education has not kept
accepted students from coming.
Seventy-five percent of those
students who turned us down went to
colleges just as expensive, he said. "Of
course, we can't yet determine how
many people didn't even apply
because of the costs."
"I don't think students choose
colleges on the basis of money as
much as people think," Hargadon said.

hasn't increased the funds along with
educational costs," said Huff.
Less Money
In fact, Stanford this year is
receiving less money for two of the
programs, Supplementary Equal
Opportunity Grants (SEOG) and
National Direct Student Loans
(NDSL).
Although both programs are funded
at the same level as last year, more
universities are receiving the money.
"The money pie is being spread
thinner," said Huff.
The University was given $100,000
less this year for SEOG and $300,000
less for NDSL. According to Huff, the
latter sum may be reduced as
repayments on old loans come in.
Since the financial aids office starts
with the neediest and works up the
income scale, those needy students at
the top of the scale will be the ones to
feel these reductions.
Not Enough
NDSL will not have enough funds
this year to provide for Stanford
students from families earning an
annual income over $12,000. SEOG
and College Work-Study will be
limited to those income groups under
$10,000 per year.
Huff hopes that the
newly-instituted BEOG program will
partially make up for the University's

loss of some SEOG funds.
But BEOG is only open to full-time
freshmen and does not have enough
money to grant more than $452 to a
student for a year.
Furthermore, the first BEO Grants
will not be received until January,
although Huff said University financial
aid is being advanced to those students
awaiting the federal grants in the
meantime..
Admissions Director Fred Hargadon
pointed out that the high price of a
Stanford education has not kept
accepted students from coming.
Seventy-five percent of those
students who turned us down went to
colleges just as expensive, he said. "Of
course, we can't yet determine how
many people didn't even apply
because of the costs."
"I don't think students choose
colleges on the basis of money as
much as people think," Hargadon said.
As the cost of living and college
tuition skyrocket, more and more
middle-income students are seeking
financial aid, but unfortunately
finding very little available for them
out of federal funds.
Students from families with
incomes beyond the $12,000 to
$15,000 range are almost entirely
excluded from four of the five
programs under the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare. Only
one program, Guaranteed Student
Loans (GSL), professes to be open to
all income groups.
The GSL program, however, now
has needs-analysis formulas to
determine who gets interest-subsidized
loans. The formulas, effective last
March, "tend to overstate what
middle-income parents can provide"
for their child's education, said Frank
Newman, Director of University
Relations.

According to financial director
Robert Huff, Stanford is using the
"most sensitive" of the three formulas
approved by the Office of Education.
"And we're taking steps to make it
more realistic in the future for
middle-income families," he added.
But in the meantime, "aid to
middle-income students is clearly a
problem," Huff said.
Nothing New
The federal government's failure to
provide for the middle-income student
is not new. But the oversight did not
seriously affect many students until
recently, when educational costs began
to squeeze those who had not
previously needed financial aid.
In the past year, Stanford's tuition
went up $285. Room and board for
dormitories jumped from $1,345 to
$1,425.
Although Congress has not cut
student aid and has even added a new
program called Basic Equal
Opportunity Grants (BEOG), "it
hasn't increased the funds along with
educational costs," said Huff.
