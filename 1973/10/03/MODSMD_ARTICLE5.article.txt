# McCloskey Requests Probe Of Charges Against Agnew
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
Rep. Paul N. McGoskey Jr.,
R-Menlo Park, yesterday introduced a
resolution asking the House Judiciary
Committee to "conduct a full and
complete investigation" of criminal
allegations against Vice President Spiro
T. Agnew.
A special federal grand jury in
Baltimore is considering possible
charges of bribery, extortion and
conspiracy against the Vice President.
In an effort to speed its deliberations,
the grand jury is planning two working
sessions this week beginning today.
In introducing his resolution before
the House yesterday, McCloskey asked
his colleagues to reverse Speaker Carl
Albert's decision last Wednesday to
delay action on Agnew's own request
for an investigation of the charges.
McCloskey said "the issue is a

constitutional matter for careful
deliberation and decision by the whole
House, not a political matter for quick
determination by the leadership of
either political party."
Albert had said that Agnew's
request related "to matters before the
courts. In view of that fact, I, as
Speaker, will not take any action on
the letter [from Agnew] at this time."
However, McCloskey pointed out
that "there is nothing whatsoever in
our law which prevents a congressional
investigation at the same time as
criminal proceedings are in progress,"
and cited the Ervin Committee
hearings as an example.
'Lesser Position'
The maverick Republican said that
an official such as Agnew would be "in
a lesser position to complain" about
prejudicial pre-trial publicity becuase
this publicity inevitably "adheres to

the operation" of high office.
McCloskey told the House
yesterday that "our primary obligation
today is to do everything in our power
to restore, as rapidly as possible, the
faith of our people in our system of
government."
According to McCloskey, the
allegations against Agnew "remain
before the public, understandably
causing concern and apprehension.
The public faith in government
remains skeptical, if not cynical."
'Sword Of Damocles'
McCloskey said a "sword of
Damocles [is] suspended over
[Agnew's] every function," adding
that only "a speedy, comprehensive
and impartial inquiry" by the House
into the allegations against the Vice
President could remove that "sword."
"It is refreshing to have a member
of the Executive Branch come to us
ready to reveal the full facts,
withholding nothing," said McCloskey.
"Under the circumstances, I admire his
courage and hope for the nation's sake
and his own, that he has been guilty of
no misconduct."
Nevertheless, McCloskey repeated
that he believes "that the Constitution
permits the indictment of the Vice
President" before he is impeached by
the House. Agnew and his attorneys
have argued in court that the grand
jury should halt its investigation until
such time as the House impeaches the
Vice President.
First Witness
According to the Associated Press,
the first witness at today's session of
the special grand jury will be William
J. Muth, a former Democratic
Baltimore City Councilman who has
been active in raising funds for
Agnew's 1966 Maryland gubernatorial
campaign and for both of his vice
presidential campaigns.
Muth, who apparently invoked his
Fifth Amendment privilege against
self-incrimination when he appeared
before the grand jury last Thursday,
will reportedly be granted immunity
from prosecution and forced to testify
under threat of being sent to jail.
Muth told newsmen last week, after
leaving the grand jury room, that the
Agnew investigation "is a lot of
bull ."
Since Aug. 23, when it handed up a
39-count indictment against N. Dale
Anderson, the Democrat who
succeeded Agnew as chief executive of
Baltimore County in 1966, the jury
has been in session only three times —
including last Thursday when it
opened its criminal probe of the vice
president on direct orders of Atty.
Gen. Elliot L. Richardson.
A day later Agnew's lawyers moved
to halt the grand jury investigation,
and also to silence all public discussion
about alleged evidence already before
the jury or scheduled to be presented,
if it ever is.
U.S. District Court Judge Walter E.
Hoffman Jr. of Norfolk, assigned
specially to handle the Agnew phase
after all nine federal judges in
Maryland disqualified themselves
because of friendship with the vice
president, has fixed Oct. 12 for a
hearing here.
Until Hoffman acts, though, the
federal prosecutors headed by U.S.
Atty. George Beall of Maryland are
free to pursue their probe.

for an investigation of the charges.
McCloskey said "the issue is a

constitutional matter for careful
deliberation and decision by the whole
House, not a political matter for quick
determination by the leadership of
either political party."
Albert had said that Agnew's
request related "to matters before the
courts. In view of that fact, I, as
Speaker, will not take any action on
the letter [from Agnew] at this time."
However, McCloskey pointed out
that "there is nothing whatsoever in
our law which prevents a congressional
investigation at the same time as
criminal proceedings are in progress,"
and cited the Ervin Committee
hearings as an example.
'Lesser Position'
The maverick Republican said that
an official such as Agnew would be "in
a lesser position to complain" about
prejudicial pre-trial publicity becuase
this publicity inevitably "adheres to

the operation" of high office.
McCloskey told the House
yesterday that "our primary obligation
today is to do everything in our power
to restore, as rapidly as possible, the
faith of our people in our system of
government."
According to McCloskey, the
allegations against Agnew "remain
before the public, understandably
causing concern and apprehension.
The public faith in government
remains skeptical, if not cynical."
'Sword Of Damocles'
McCloskey said a "sword of
Damocles [is] suspended over
[Agnew's] every function," adding
that only "a speedy, comprehensive
and impartial inquiry" by the House
into the allegations against the Vice
President could remove that "sword."
"It is refreshing to have a member
of the Executive Branch come to us
ready to reveal the full facts,
withholding nothing," said McCloskey.
"Under the circumstances, I admire his
courage and hope for the nation's sake
and his own, that he has been guilty of
no misconduct."
Nevertheless, McCloskey repeated
that he believes "that the Constitution
permits the indictment of the Vice
President" before he is impeached by
the House. Agnew and his attorneys
have argued in court that the grand
jury should halt its investigation until
such time as the House impeaches the
Vice President.
First Witness
According to the Associated Press,
the first witness at today's session of
the special grand jury will be William
J. Muth, a former Democratic
Baltimore City Councilman who has
been active in raising funds for
Agnew's 1966 Maryland gubernatorial
campaign and for both of his vice
presidential campaigns.
Muth, who apparently invoked his
Fifth Amendment privilege against
self-incrimination when he appeared
before the grand jury last Thursday,
will reportedly be granted immunity
from prosecution and forced to testify
under threat of being sent to jail.
Muth told newsmen last week, after
leaving the grand jury room, that the
Agnew investigation "is a lot of
bull ."
Since Aug. 23, when it handed up a
39-count indictment against N. Dale
Anderson, the Democrat who
succeeded Agnew as chief executive of
Baltimore County in 1966, the jury
has been in session only three times —
including last Thursday when it
opened its criminal probe of the vice
president on direct orders of Atty.
Gen. Elliot L. Richardson.
A day later Agnew's lawyers moved
to halt the grand jury investigation,
and also to silence all public discussion
about alleged evidence already before
the jury or scheduled to be presented,
if it ever is.
U.S. District Court Judge Walter E.
Hoffman Jr. of Norfolk, assigned
specially to handle the Agnew phase
after all nine federal judges in
Maryland disqualified themselves
because of friendship with the vice
president, has fixed Oct. 12 for a
hearing here.
Until Hoffman acts, though, the
federal prosecutors headed by U.S.
Atty. George Beall of Maryland are
free to pursue their probe.
Rep. Paul N. McGoskey Jr.,
R-Menlo Park, yesterday introduced a
resolution asking the House Judiciary
Committee to "conduct a full and
complete investigation" of criminal
allegations against Vice President Spiro
T. Agnew.
A special federal grand jury in
Baltimore is considering possible
charges of bribery, extortion and
conspiracy against the Vice President.
In an effort to speed its deliberations,
the grand jury is planning two working
sessions this week beginning today.

the House yesterday, McCloskey asked
his colleagues to reverse Speaker Carl
Albert's decision last Wednesday to
