# University Trustees Contributed To Nixon
## 
### 
Two current and one former
member of the University's Board of
Trustees turned up on a list of major
pre-April 7 contributors to President
Nixon's 1972 campaign.
The list, released this week by
California Secretary of State Edmund
G. Brown Jr., names the contributors
as current trustee William R. Hewlett,
president of Hewlett-Packard, the Palo
Alto-based electronics corporation;
current trustee Thomas P. Pike, vice
chairman of the Fluor Corp. of Los
Angeles; and David Packard, a former
trustee who also served as deputy
secretary of defense under Nixon.
The names were included in records
made public last week as part of a legal
battle between Nixon's re-election
committee and Common Cause.
Ironically, Common Cause is headed
by another Stanford trustee, former
HEW Secretary John W. Gardner.
According to the records, Packard
gave some $51,000 to the campaign,
while Hewlett gave $18,000 and Pike
$24,457.

The funds were donated before
April 7, when a new law requiring full
disclosure went into effect.
Brown also announced a probe into
the previously-unknown receipt of
some $250,000 in campaign donations
by Herbert W. Kalmbach, Nixon's
personal attorney. Brown said the
investigation would concentrate on
where the money was used.
During testimony this summer
before the Senate Watergate
Committee, Kalmbach testified that
some funds he raised were used as
support money for the original
Watergate defendants.
He said some $75,000 he received
in July, 1972 from yet another
trustee, industrialist Thomas V. Jones
of Los Angeles, eventually found its
way to the seven defendants.
Jones disputed the $75,000 figure
— saying he gave only $50,000 — and
said he had no idea when he gave the
money that it was not being used for
the re-election campaign.
