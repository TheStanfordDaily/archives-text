## Why Venceremos Disbanded

We live in a country where a small minority own
and control the immense wealth produced by labor.
10 percent owns close to 60 percent of the nation's
wealth. 4 percent control 70 percent of corporate
stocks and bonds. The workers who produce this
wealth get crumbs.
We live in a country where this small minority
"invests" and then extracts immense wealth from
third world countries and communities inside the
U.S. In Latin America alone, with an initial
investment of 7 billion dollars, U-S. corporations
have extracted close to 15 billion over the last
decades.
These countries and communities are
"decapitalized." A fancy word for plundered.
To defend this 86 billion dollars of world-wide
investments, the government maintains history's
largest network of military bases and U.S.
equipped-and-trained foreign troops and police.
These military-political expenses have caused the
major part of an annual balance-of-payment deficit
rate of 23 billion dollars, and this in turn has caused
the economic crisis in our country.
As usual, the little guy gets crunched.
Repression Grows
As the crisis deepens and opposition grows
outside and inside this country, so does repression.
From water-shock interrogation techniques, to
forced psychosurgery on prisoners, from no-knock
laws which legalize police invasions of homes, to 50
armored personnel carriers with machine guns
surrounding Wounded Knee, to outright massacre,
the government shows no limit on the methods it
will use against those who oppose it directly.
To justify these things, the press, owned by the
same minority that owns most of everything else,
distorts the truth so that those who oppose appear
to be the criminals. The real criminals go free.
This minority controls the processes of change —
the major political parties, the courts, much of
trade-union leadership, and the government. These
processes aim only at reform anyway. What is
needed is fundamental change, and that, by
definition, is revolution.
Revolution is a long, hard, complicated, tedious,
dangerous job. No one has ever said it was simple, or
easy, or that it was a tea-party. There are no simple
formulas. It always has many setbacks.
Venceremos, a revolutionary organization, has
disbanded; in many ways this is a setback.
The organization has been active in helping to set

up People's Medical Center in Redwood City, the
drug collective in Palo Alto, the '71 Tresidder Union
boycott to stop layoffs, the Stanford Hospital sit-in
to get a fair hearing for a fired black worker,
childcare centers, anti-war actions, support of
Wounded Knee, and many other things.
It was organized around the principal that there
is no equality as long as a minority owns and
controls, and a majority sells its labor and is
controlled; that workers should control the wealth
they produce; that third world people have a right
to control their own nations and communities and
that women have the right to control their own
lives.
The organization was upfront in its belief that no
"ruling class" surrenders its power and privilege
without a fight, and so the revolutionary must be
armed. Whereas this seemed an obvious principle to
many who live in third world and poor
communities, it was criticized as too blunt by those
who don't have to live with police repression in
their day-to-day lives. The press of course
capitalized on our bluntness and pictured us as
crazies who run up and down University Ave.
tossing bombs here and there. (This image often
made our political work difficult.)
Contradictions
On the other hand, disbanding Venceremos is a
necessary and good thing at this time. We had
contradictions which we did not resolve:
—we were unable to determine clearly how black
and brown and white revolutionaries organize
together;
—we did not deal adequately with growing police
repression and the Chino frame-up;
—we agreed that local organizations must help
form a national communist revolutionary party, but
we differed on how to do this;
and
—we often confused spontaneous rebellion with
revolutionary action.
Because we failed to work out these and other
problems which face the entire "movement," we
were immobilized. Since there is no revolutionary
organization without action, and since there is no
revolutionary organization without a unified
strategy to guide this action, we disbanded.
We have been set back. Moct of us are not going
away. We are trying to deal with things we should
have dealt with a long time ago.
