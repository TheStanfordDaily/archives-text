## Perspectives On The CJP Proposal 
### 
= John milstein

In 1968 the Legislative and
Judicial Charter was approved by
a student referendum, the
Academic Council, and the
President. It established two
committees: a Student Conduct
Legislative Council (SCLC) for the
purpose of making regulations
concerning student conduct, and a
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC)
for the purpose of adjudicating
alleged violations of these
regulations.
While the SCLC and SJC do
have the "primary responsibility''
for making regulations governing
student conduct and adjudicating
violations, the Legislative and
Judicial Charter doesn't limit the
authority of the President to issue
and enforce such regulations. This
authority includes the adoption of
alternative procedures for use in
the event that the SCLC and SJC
cannot enforce regulations
specified by the SCLC.
Impasse
In November of 1971, this
impasse occurred. When the
Student Senate refused to
participate in selecting members
of the SJC because they
contended the Administration
had violated the charter in
fundamental respects. President
Lyman adopted a new judicial
system in accordance with the
Charter. This system, labeled the
Campus Judicial Panel (CJP), will
remain in effect until altered by
the President or until a new
judicial system is approved by the
students, the faculty, and the
administration.
In a Daily opinions-article of
last year, former ASSU President
Brent Appel pointed out three
disadvantages of the CJP when
compared to the SJC conceived in
1968. First, students had the right
to call witnesses before the
Student Judicial Council and to
confront witnesses in front of that
bodv.
Yet students may not call
witnesses before the CJP, but only
before a hearing officer whose
determination of facts are final.
Under the SJC, determinations of

fact were made by a panel
consisting of one-half students. In
the CJP, on the other hand, no
students participate in
determinations of fact.
Secondly, Appel felt that the
"... chairman of the CJP, who is
appointed by the president, has
sweeping, unappealable powers
including the making of "all
rulings related to the conduct of
the hearing before the CJP." The
chairman of the SJC had no such
power.
Finally, Appel pointed out that
members of the SJC could move
to override rulings of the
chairman by a majority vote on
issues of evidence, while no
comparable provision exists under
the CJP.
The only method of amending
the Legislative and Judicial
Charter is through the Committee
of Fifteen (Cl 5), a standing
university-wide committee
composed of six students, six
faculty, and three numbers
appointed by the President.
Proposed amendments must be
ratified by the students, faculty,
and the President. This particular
provision is the c-use for a
referendum on the ASSU ballot
next week.
New Plan
After a Cl 5 proposal was
defeated in an ASSU referendum
almost a year c.go, a re-constituted
Committee cf Fifteen suggested z.
new plan 1 ast spring. Chaired by
former ASSU Senator Jim
Anderson, and assisted by law
professo/ Jack Friedenthal, the
chartei proposed an SJC
composed of four students, three
faculty members, and a chairman
from the Law School.
A stipulation in this charter
spates that "upon determining
that the SJC is impaired by the
composition of that body, the
University President, or two-thirds
of those members of the ASSU
Senate present and voting, or
two-thirds of those members of
the Academic Senate present and
voting may reduce the number of

student positions on the SJC by
one," thus eliminating the student
majority.
In an editorial entitled "C-15:
Kudos," the Daily supported the
proposed new system, pointing
out that the plan not only
provided for a panel with a
majority of student members
(both of the previous two judicial
systems included faculty
majorities), but that the CIS no
longer insisted upon removing the
student body's veto power over
future proposed changes in the
judicial system. "Overall," the
Daily wrote, "the C-15's proposal
merits full consideration and
speedy approval by all three
University constituencies."
Criticism
In a reply to the Editorial,
David Levine (a former AGSU
Senator) et al felt that . . the
student majority exists only so
long as Dick Lyman remains
satisfied the students aren't acting
'irresponsibly.' Whatever you
want to say about this judicial
system, you certainly can't claim
it establishes 'the appearance of
fairness.'
"In every election held so far.
students have indicated they want
their judicial system to conta'n a
student majority. The C! 5
proposal is a clever and slick plan
appearing to satisfy sU'.dent
interests while actually ?
the institutional arrangements the
administration has always
desired."
Cl 5 student committeemen
Tom Flohr ?nd Jim Anderson
urged that the Senate take action
on the proposal last year. They
both felt that the proposal would
be in danger of failing if debate
was postponed until this fall,
when present student members of
the Cl 5 wouldn't be at Stanford

to explain and defend the
proposal.
Brent Appel, however, took
issue with a Student Senate
approval of the plan last spring.
He said, "To suggest that the
Student Senate should pass the
proposal in one night is the most
arrogant thing I've ever heard of.
To suggest that the Student
Senate should pass the proposal in
one week is the second most
arrogant thing I've ever heard of."
Eventually, the ASSU Senate
decided, in a 12 to 11 roll-call
vote, to postpone debate on the
question until this quarter
(paralleling action on the
proposed SJC two years ago).
The newly-elected ASSU
Council of Presidents soundly
condemned the proposed system.
Asserting that "the students lost
on every .. . major issue," they
urged that the student body not
"vote to legitimize a judicial
system as demeaning as the
current Cl 5 report."
The ASSU Presidential Council
specifically rejected the provision
that the faculty senate or the
University President could reduce
the number of student posts on
the Judicial Panel by one,
eliminating the student majority.
They felt that this made the
concept of a student majority
"meaningless."
Cl 5 Chairman Jim Anderson
responded to iheir attack by
answerinp that tfie committee's
plan was a "reasonable
compromise that would work
if ... put into action ... I think
it's the best we couid get for the
lr it several years. If the students
turn tnis down, there's just no
chance as I see it of getting
anything next year."
