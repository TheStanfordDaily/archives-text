I JOIN THREE BIG WAYS |
1. NEWS
News, being the raison d'etre of a newspaper, is what most of the people on The
Stanford Daily staff write. "It is the duty of a newspaper," the Chicago Tribune once
declared, "to print the news and raise hell." Things being as they are, printing the news
and raising hell are often one and the same action. If, that is, a newspaper is aggressive
enough to find the real news. Most newspapers aren't; you can help make the Daily an
exception.
2. SPORTS
The roar of the crowd, the thwonk of racket against ball, the crunch of the
linebacker's infraspinous fossa, the heady (if close) air of the postgame locker room. All
this, and more — free tickets, mainly — can be yours. Daily sports scribes hold the
enviable position of being asked to pontificate on the subject they like most. You could
do worse.
3. REVIEWS
More pontificating; better yet, more free tickets. Writing good reviews demands a fine
sense of style and no small amount of erudition. The Daily publishes reviews of films, ;
plays, concerts, opera, and ballet (free tickets). Also books (free books) and records
(likewise). What more could you ask?
JOIN THE DAILY
A meeting for those interested in joining the staff will he held at the Daily's offices in . r
the Storke Student Publications Building on Lomita Drive between Panama and Santa
Teresa Streets today at 3:15 p.m. You are invited. 11
