# Business Lecturer Scores As Tennis Entrepreneur
## 
### CLAIRE SPIEGEL 
Tennis is as hot on the market as it
is on the courts, and promoters are
making sensational profits off the
game, which most people play just for
points.
Steven C. Brandt, lecturer in
management at the Graduate School
of Business here, landed a big offer last
year to run a private tennis teaching
firm, TennisAmerica, Inc., organized
by Billie Jean King, her husband
Larry, and tennis professional Dennis
Van der Meer. Since catching the
spinning ball, Brandt has sent it
spiraling to the pinnacle of commercial
success.
Tennis America's sales have doubled
every year since 1970, when the tall,
tan tennis pro Dennis Van der Meer
formed the company to market his
unique method of teaching tennis.
This year, sales have boomed past the
$1,000,000 mark, and next year the
company is planning to increase its
tennis camps and workshops from 14
to 50.
The tennis craze has brought
thousands of sportsmen to these
clinics where Van der Meer's specially
trained instructors iron out the kinks
in the Sunday tennis player's strokes.
TennisAmerica spells the death of the
court clutz with his frying-pan-handle
serve.
Land At Tahoe
In addition to organizing
workshops at numerous tennis clubs,
TennisAmerica occasionally contracts
to manage a club's whole show by
moving in the personnel to handle
finances, membership drives and
merchandizing, as well as the
instructors to teach the tennis
workshops. The company also owns
some real estate — a clinic at Incline
Village, Lake Tahoe.
However, TennisAmerica primarily
markets service and personnel. Brandt
laid the issue bare: "Our basic formula
is that we make money on the tennis,
and they make money off the food

and house. Our basic strategy, now, is
that we won't own the facilities. A lot
of people own the courts — schools,
clubs, housing projects. But we have a
special method of instruction to sell."
So far, the formula has sold like
magic, and TennisAmerica has jumped
from rags to riches. The company has
moved its headquarters from its
humble beginnings above a massage
parlor in Berkeley to an executive
suite in Palo Alto, where loose piles of
paper scattered through Brandt's
office indicate that even bigger moves
are underway.
Next IBM?
Somewhere in those reams of
paper, Brandt has figured out dramatic
business maneuvers. "We've got the
game plan to become the IBM of the
tennis industry," he said. "Our plan is
to establish TennisAmerica as the
leading service company in the
industry, with teaching the basis of
it." He estimates that there are 11
million tennis players today, and cites
Fortune magazine's prediction that the
number will double in ten years.
Players between the ages of seven
and 70 are filling Tennis America's
clinics. Brandt concedes, "70 years old
is unusual, but people in their 50s are
not." He estimates that 40 percent of
the 10,000 students trained by the
company's 250 instructors this year
are juniors and 60 percent are adults.
What's common to them all is
eagerness to spend money learning
how to play tennis in concentrated
doses ranging from one weekend to
three weeks.
Some clinics are held in classy
resorts such as the Hilton Head in
South Carolina or the Aspen Racket
Club in Colorado where adults pay
$355 for a week's instruction
(including room). However, Brandt
claims TennisAmerica pays little
attention to the social amenities which
the well-established, exclusive resorts
such as the Tennis Ranch in Ojai,
Calif, usually emphasize.

"They're geared to a different
segment of the market. They're
concerned with the Cadillac class,"
Brandt said. "We cater more to the
Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac people."
Nor is TennisAmerica competing
with the local clubs or pros. Brandt
explained that the unique selling point
of his company's method of
instruction is group interaction.
"This technique produces a great
deal of synergism and stresses practice
experience under normal playing
conditions. We teach people how to
play, instead of just teaching them the
strokes — where they learn the pieces
but never learn how it all fits
together," he said.
With Van der Meer, it's back to the

basics — "the classic form," as Brandt
put it."He subtracts rather than
adding on. Most people have a lot of
screwball things wrong with their
strokes which Dennis strips away to
get down to the basics."
Self-Selling Sport
As intriguing as this approach may
be, the central factor responsible for
Tennis America's success is the
inherent appeal of the sport which
sells itself.
"Tennis has the advantage of being
a sport with easy access at low cost.
It's also good for the environment and
good for you," Brandt said.
"Furthermore, it's a sport that's easy
to relate to."
According to Brandt, Van der Meer

and the Kings approached him last
year when TennisAmerica was
"growing like Topsie." He accepted
their proposition that he become
chairman of their board and chief
executive officer of the company
because TennisAmerica offered "a lot
of pizzaz," growth potential, and
challenge.
One of the biggest challenges comes
from company president Billie Jean
King, and her desire to extend
Tennis America's service down to the
municipal level — the easiest access
and lowest cost point in the
community. A product of the public
courts in Long Beach, Calif., Billie
Jean wants to see the company's
instruction also benefit the youngster

who can't afford camp. For the
businessman, it's a challenge to
provide this service at no financial loss.
The smooth, blond, native South
African Van der Meer, has always
looked forward to profits. He boasted
10 years ago that he'd be a millionaire
before he was 40. Brandt predicted,
"If he's 37 or less right now, I expect
he'll make it; if he's 38 it'll be tight,
and if he's already 40 ... I don't know
how much, if anything, he had saved
away to begin with."
Meanwhile, Brandt, the newcomer
to the booming business with plans for
even bigger boons from the game, is
just now learning how to make a point
with the racket. For most tennis
players, that's what counts.

chairman of their board and chief
executive officer of the company
because TennisAmerica offered "a lot
of pizzaz," growth potential, and
challenge.
One of the biggest challenges comes
from company president Billie Jean
King, and her desire to extend
Tennis America's service down to the
municipal level — the easiest access
and lowest cost point in the
community. A product of the public
courts in Long Beach, Calif., Billie
Jean wants to see the company's
instruction also benefit the youngster

who can't afford camp. For the
businessman, it's a challenge to
provide this service at no financial loss.
The smooth, blond, native South
African Van der Meer, has always
looked forward to profits. He boasted
10 years ago that he'd be a millionaire
before he was 40. Brandt predicted,
"If he's 37 or less right now, I expect
he'll make it; if he's 38 it'll be tight,
and if he's already 40 ... I don't know
how much, if anything, he had saved
away to begin with."
Meanwhile, Brandt, the newcomer
to the booming business with plans for
even bigger boons from the game, is
just now learning how to make a point
with the racket. For most tennis
players, that's what counts.

TENNIS TYCOON — Steven C. Brandt, a lecturer at the Graduate School of
Business here, serves as chairman of the board of TennisAmerica Inc., a booming
business founded by Billie Jean King, her husband Larry, and tennis professional
Dennis Van der Meer.
Tennis is as hot on the market as it
is on the courts, and promoters are
making sensational profits off the
game, which most people play just for
points.
Steven C. Brandt, lecturer in
management at the Graduate School
of Business here, landed a big offer last
year to run a private tennis teaching
firm, TennisAmerica, Inc., organized
by Billie Jean King, her husband
Larry, and tennis professional Dennis
Van der Meer. Since catching the
spinning ball, Brandt has sent it
spiraling to the pinnacle of commercial
success.
Tennis America's sales have doubled
every year since 1970, when the tall,
tan tennis pro Dennis Van der Meer
formed the company to market his
unique method of teaching tennis.
This year, sales have boomed past the
$1,000,000 mark, and next year the
company is planning to increase its
tennis camps and workshops from 14
to 50.
The tennis craze has brought
thousands of sportsmen to these
clinics where Van der Meer's specially
trained instructors iron out the kinks
in the Sunday tennis player's strokes.
TennisAmerica spells the death of the
court clutz with his frying-pan-handle
serve.
Land At Tahoe
In addition to organizing
workshops at numerous tennis clubs,
TennisAmerica occasionally contracts
to manage a club's whole show by
moving in the personnel to handle
finances, membership drives and
merchandizing, as well as the
instructors to teach the tennis
workshops. The company also owns
some real estate — a clinic at Incline
Village, Lake Tahoe.
However, TennisAmerica primarily
markets service and personnel. Brandt
laid the issue bare: "Our basic formula
is that we make money on the tennis,
and they make money off the food

and house. Our basic strategy, now, is
that we won't own the facilities. A lot
of people own the courts — schools,
clubs, housing projects. But we have a
special method of instruction to sell."
So far, the formula has sold like
magic, and TennisAmerica has jumped
from rags to riches. The company has
moved its headquarters from its
humble beginnings above a massage
parlor in Berkeley to an executive
suite in Palo Alto, where loose piles of
paper scattered through Brandt's
office indicate that even bigger moves
are underway.
Next IBM?
Somewhere in those reams of
paper, Brandt has figured out dramatic
business maneuvers. "We've got the
game plan to become the IBM of the
tennis industry," he said. "Our plan is
to establish TennisAmerica as the
leading service company in the
industry, with teaching the basis of
it." He estimates that there are 11
million tennis players today, and cites
Fortune magazine's prediction that the
number will double in ten years.
Players between the ages of seven
and 70 are filling Tennis America's
clinics. Brandt concedes, "70 years old
is unusual, but people in their 50s are
not." He estimates that 40 percent of
the 10,000 students trained by the
company's 250 instructors this year
are juniors and 60 percent are adults.
What's common to them all is
eagerness to spend money learning
how to play tennis in concentrated
doses ranging from one weekend to
three weeks.
Some clinics are held in classy
resorts such as the Hilton Head in
South Carolina or the Aspen Racket
Club in Colorado where adults pay
$355 for a week's instruction
(including room). However, Brandt
claims TennisAmerica pays little
attention to the social amenities which
the well-established, exclusive resorts
such as the Tennis Ranch in Ojai,
Calif, usually emphasize.

"They're geared to a different
segment of the market. They're
concerned with the Cadillac class,"
Brandt said. "We cater more to the
Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac people."
Nor is TennisAmerica competing
with the local clubs or pros. Brandt
explained that the unique selling point
of his company's method of
instruction is group interaction.
"This technique produces a great
deal of synergism and stresses practice
experience under normal playing
conditions. We teach people how to
play, instead of just teaching them the
strokes — where they learn the pieces
but never learn how it all fits
together," he said.
With Van der Meer, it's back to the

basics — "the classic form," as Brandt
put it."He subtracts rather than
adding on. Most people have a lot of
screwball things wrong with their
strokes which Dennis strips away to
get down to the basics."
Self-Selling Sport
As intriguing as this approach may
be, the central factor responsible for
Tennis America's success is the
inherent appeal of the sport which
sells itself.
"Tennis has the advantage of being
a sport with easy access at low cost.
It's also good for the environment and
good for you," Brandt said.
"Furthermore, it's a sport that's easy
to relate to."
According to Brandt, Van der Meer

and the Kings approached him last
year when TennisAmerica was
"growing like Topsie." He accepted
their proposition that he become
chairman of their board and chief
executive officer of the company
because TennisAmerica offered "a lot

attention to the social amenities which
the well-established, exclusive resorts
such as the Tennis Ranch in Ojai,
Calif, usually emphasize.

"They're geared to a different
segment of the market. They're
concerned with the Cadillac class,"
Brandt said. "We cater more to the
Buick, Oldsmobile, Pontiac people."
Nor is TennisAmerica competing
with the local clubs or pros. Brandt
explained that the unique selling point
of his company's method of
instruction is group interaction.
"This technique produces a great
deal of synergism and stresses practice
experience under normal playing
conditions. We teach people how to
play, instead of just teaching them the
strokes — where they learn the pieces
but never learn how it all fits
together," he said.
With Van der Meer, it's back to the

basics — "the classic form," as Brandt
put it."He subtracts rather than
adding on. Most people have a lot of
screwball things wrong with their
strokes which Dennis strips away to
get down to the basics."
Self-Selling Sport
As intriguing as this approach may
be, the central factor responsible for
Tennis America's success is the
inherent appeal of the sport which
sells itself.
"Tennis has the advantage of being
a sport with easy access at low cost.
It's also good for the environment and
good for you," Brandt said.
"Furthermore, it's a sport that's easy
to relate to."
According to Brandt, Van der Meer

and the Kings approached him last
year when TennisAmerica was
"growing like Topsie." He accepted
their proposition that he become
chairman of their board and chief
executive officer of the company
because TennisAmerica offered "a lot
of pizzaz," growth potential, and
challenge.
One of the biggest challenges comes
from company president Billie Jean
King, and her desire to extend
Tennis America's service down to the
municipal level — the easiest access
and lowest cost point in the
community. A product of the public
courts in Long Beach, Calif., Billie
Jean wants to see the company's
instruction also benefit the youngster

who can't afford camp. For the
businessman, it's a challenge to
provide this service at no financial loss.
The smooth, blond, native South
African Van der Meer, has always
looked forward to profits. He boasted
10 years ago that he'd be a millionaire
before he was 40. Brandt predicted,
"If he's 37 or less right now, I expect
he'll make it; if he's 38 it'll be tight,
and if he's already 40 ... I don't know
how much, if anything, he had saved
away to begin with."
Meanwhile, Brandt, the newcomer
to the booming business with plans for
even bigger boons from the game, is
just now learning how to make a point
with the racket. For most tennis
players, that's what counts.

TENNIS TYCOON — Steven C. Brandt, a lecturer at the Graduate School of
Business here, serves as chairman of the board of TennisAmerica Inc., a booming
business founded by Billie Jean King, her husband Larry, and tennis professional
Dennis Van der Meer.
Tennis is as hot on the market as it
is on the courts, and promoters are
making sensational profits off the
game, which most people play just for
points.
Steven C. Brandt, lecturer in
management at the Graduate School
of Business here, landed a big offer last
year to run a private tennis teaching
firm, TennisAmerica, Inc., organized
by Billie Jean King, her husband
Larry, and tennis professional Dennis
Van der Meer. Since catching the
spinning ball, Brandt has sent it
spiraling to the pinnacle of commercial
success.
Tennis America's sales have doubled
every year since 1970, when the tall,
tan tennis pro Dennis Van der Meer
formed the company to market his
unique method of teaching tennis.
This year, sales have boomed past the
$1,000,000 mark, and next year the
company is planning to increase its
tennis camps and workshops from 14
to 50.
The tennis craze has brought
thousands of sportsmen to these
clinics where Van der Meer's specially
trained instructors iron out the kinks
in the Sunday tennis player's strokes.
TennisAmerica spells the death of the
court clutz with his frying-pan-handle
serve.
Land At Tahoe
In addition to organizing
workshops at numerous tennis clubs,
TennisAmerica occasionally contracts
to manage a club's whole show by
moving in the personnel to handle
finances, membership drives and
merchandizing, as well as the
instructors to teach the tennis
workshops. The company also owns
some real estate — a clinic at Incline
Village, Lake Tahoe.
However, TennisAmerica primarily
markets service and personnel. Brandt
laid the issue bare: "Our basic formula
is that we make money on the tennis,
and they make money off the food

and house. Our basic strategy, now, is
that we won't own the facilities. A lot
of people own the courts — schools,
clubs, housing projects. But we have a
special method of instruction to sell."
So far, the formula has sold like
magic, and TennisAmerica has jumped
from rags to riches. The company has
moved its headquarters from its
humble beginnings above a massage
parlor in Berkeley to an executive
suite in Palo Alto, where loose piles of
paper scattered through Brandt's
office indicate that even bigger moves
are underway.
Next IBM?
Somewhere in those reams of
paper, Brandt has figured out dramatic
business maneuvers. "We've got the
game plan to become the IBM of the
tennis industry," he said. "Our plan is
to establish TennisAmerica as the
leading service company in the
industry, with teaching the basis of
it." He estimates that there are 11
million tennis players today, and cites
Fortune magazine's prediction that the
number will double in ten years.
Players between the ages of seven
and 70 are filling Tennis America's
clinics. Brandt concedes, "70 years old
is unusual, but people in their 50s are
not." He estimates that 40 percent of
the 10,000 students trained by the
company's 250 instructors this year
are juniors and 60 percent are adults.
What's common to them all is
eagerness to spend money learning
how to play tennis in concentrated
doses ranging from one weekend to
three weeks.
Some clinics are held in classy
resorts such as the Hilton Head in
South Carolina or the Aspen Racket
Club in Colorado where adults pay
$355 for a week's instruction
(including room). However, Brandt
claims TennisAmerica pays little
attention to the social amenities which
the well-established, exclusive resorts
such as the Tennis Ranch in Ojai,
Calif, usually emphasize.
