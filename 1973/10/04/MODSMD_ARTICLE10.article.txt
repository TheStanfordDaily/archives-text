## The 						Secret To Surviving The Ratio

link hachnadel

This guide has been prepared
for the benefit of freshman
Stanford males who are beginning
to be, or already have been,
psyched-out by the infamous
Ratio. It may also prove beneficial
to those upperclassmen who,
having brushed their teeth with
Ultra-Brite, assaulted their
underarms each morning with
three-day antiperspirant, paid
Pendleton and MacGregor prices
for their clothes, received split
ends courtesy of their hot-air (like
the commercials that market
them) styling brush, and splashed
on Hai-Karate after every meal,

still moan in despair because not
one female on campus finds him
fun for anything but mealtime
conversations.
It is a concise manual of
techniques to try before all else
fails, prepared by a sophomore
with the unwitting assistance of
several cohorts whose frosh years
still lurk dismally in the accessible
regions of their memories, to be
kept on reference at all times.
Important fact to remember:
The Stanford Woman Is
Discriminating. (After all, she
chose the same school you did.)
This knowledge will not only help
you understand her better, but
may also prevent you from
becoming pathological when your
self-esteem goes down the tubes.
Getting Introduced
The first step, getting
introduced, is easy; just ask a
mutual friend to do it. If no
mutual friend is available, do it
yourself. (See "line," paragraph
6.)
If you happen to be a superb
specimen of masculine meat, your
problems are already over, and
you may stop reading at any time.
The rest of you, continue, please.
For those with cars and/or
enough money to take a girl to
the city a few times a month:
expect to get tooled (i.e., used) at
least once or twice. Woman has
been trained from time
immemorable to allow males to
obtain most of her satisfactions
for her, and 20th Century Woman
is no different.
Hie Beginning
Make the first few dates with
your darling cheep, The Flicks (50
cents) or a picnic in the hills
($3.00 for groceries and a bottle
of wine) are ideal but unoriginal.
Don't commit yourself until you
see the Role-Reversal Indicator
(she asks you out, and volunteers
to split the tab). This mostly
indicates she likes you at least as
much as she likes your
checkbook, or possibly, that she
read this manual. P.S. If she wants
to bring "a friend" along, forget
it.
Smile at every girl who strikes
your fancy (whatever that means),
and avoid setting your fancy in
the Miss Universe and runners-up
bracket. Always be ready to make
conversation, and be on the
receiving end at least 50 percent
of the time. Never hesitate to pick
up the ball on a fumble, since
after two or three embarassing
salences you'll both wish you had
never met each other. If you're
not Bert rand Russell, spend your
idle monjtmts inventing amusing
lines, and then don't forget to use
them. If you feel phoney with
such a contrivance, console

yourself with the conviction that
Bertrand probably used them
himself.
Subtle flattery will get you
everywhere — keyword:
subtle. Be Brazen, not
Overbearing — courage
scores points.
Watch her eyes, not her
breasts. That way it's easier to tell
what's on her mind (remember
that she has one, see paragraph 2)
and you're less likely to make her
uncomfortable.
Finally, we come — no double
entendre intended — to
EMERGENCY MEASURES.
Falling Out of Love
If you've fallen in love with the
most beautiful girl on campus,
and she wouldn't speak to you if
she stepped on your foot or she
likes boys with $5000 per year
entertainment budgets, you can
often turn yourself off with the
Dark-Star Maneuver. It's simple.
Think of the oldest woman you've
ever seen, and superimpose those
wrinkles, plus (the killer), one of
your mother's period-ic bad
moods upon the bounteous bod
of your beloved. Viola! The light
of your life is light no longer.
At last resort, after all else has
failed, and things are rapidly
coming to grips (right or left

handed) recall that certain
counties in Nevada will legally
dispense what you need without
prescription. It's not free, but
(after adding up gas, meals,
theatre tickets, ice cream cones at
Ghirardelli's and, assuming
minimum wage, hours invested)
most of the time, it'll cheaper.
Especially if you're going to
Tahoe anyway.
Then get out to a
Stanford-style combination
party/track meet, and enjoy the
company of some of the most
understanding people on the
Peninsula.
