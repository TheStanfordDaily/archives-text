## Smokescreen Disguises True Intent 
### 
andretc leucher

As a young Navy lieutenant
stationed in the South Pacific
during World War 11, Richard
Nixon was looked upon by all his
fellow officers as a naive young
man. Indeed, the cherubic-faced
Quaker from Whittier, California,
lent the impression to everyone he
met. Because his fellow officers
thought he'd be an "easy take,"
they taught him how to play
poker. His ten-thousand-odd
dollar winnings at the game were
exceeded only by his fellow
officers' surprise.
Today, his peers attribute

young Richard's gambling success
to his great "poker face."
Evidently the talent for the bluff
is something which has remained
with Mr. Nixon to this day. The
most recent example of President
Nixon's skill at sham lies in his
self-proclaimed "counter-offensive
on Watergate."
The true nature of the
President's "counter-offensive"
first became apparent in his
August television address. There,
Mr. Nixon chose to compare the
overzealousness of the Watergate
conspirators, acting "in a cause
they believed in," to the civil
disobedience of the peace and
civil rights movements of the
sixties; after all, each was fostered
by an idealistic disregard for the
law. Yet President Nixon chose to
ignore the fundamental
contradicitions in his analogy.
Difference Of Intent
The vast majority of the peace
and civil rights protestors, through
illegal, yet peaceful, protest
activity, and subsequent
submission for punishment,
sought to call attention to their
"causes," and reform the laws of
the system they disrupted.
The same can hardly be said of
the Watergate conspirators;
indeed, quite the contrary. Theirs
was not an attempt to change an

unjust law, merely to bypass an
inconvenient one; hence the
attempts to hide their pious fraud,
with pseudonyms, red wigs, and
phony glasses. And of course,
every attempt has been made to
avoid prosecution.
Such fallacious reasoning is
becoming the rule of, rather than
the exception to, the President's
recent public statements. Perhaps
the most evident "bluff" was
President Nixon's presentation of
his special legislative package to
the Congress.
Dramatic Reversal
In a dramatic reversal of his
1972 campaign stand on domestic
issues ("I don't need a platform, I
can walk on water"), Mr. Nixon
cast himself in the role of the
statesman trying to govern despite
an unruly legislature.
He complained that the
Democratic Congress was
investigating Presidential
campaign practices at the expense
of the "important issues" of the
nation; his statement comes in
seeming ignorance of the fact that
only a fraction of the Senate is at
all involved in the Watergate
inquiry.
Weak Arguments
But the manpower
mathematics of the Watergate
committee are not Mr. Nixon's

primary concern. By re-opening
the familiar Democratic/
Republican chasm between the
White House and Capitol Hill, he
is using labels as his arguments. By
imposing party lines on a
non-partisan issue, President
Nixon hopes to divert full
attention from the national
scandal at hand. For the sake of
obscuring wrongdoing in his own
administration, the President is
reviving that same partisanism
which his famous "bring us
together" slogan tried to
eliminate.
President Nixon's recent
comments and addresses are
merely the latest in a series of
equivocal rebuttals on Watergate.
Insinuations concerning
Communist funding of the
Democratic Party, inuendoes
purporting eavesdropping by
Democratic candidates, allegations
of persecution by the Senate's
Campaign Practices Committee,
and persistent reminders of the
Chappaquidick incident — all are
statements designed to resolve the
Watergate crisis by obscuring it
from public view. Perhaps Mr.
Nixon's self-named
"counter-offensive" is more
correctly termed a smokescreen.

poker. His ten-thousand-odd
dollar winnings at the game were
exceeded only by his fellow
officers' surprise.
Today, his peers attribute

young Richard's gambling success
to his great "poker face."
Evidently the talent for the bluff
is something which has remained
with Mr. Nixon to this day. The
most recent example of President
Nixon's skill at sham lies in his
self-proclaimed "counter-offensive
on Watergate."
The true nature of the
President's "counter-offensive"
first became apparent in his
August television address. There,
Mr. Nixon chose to compare the
overzealousness of the Watergate
conspirators, acting "in a cause
they believed in," to the civil
disobedience of the peace and
civil rights movements of the
sixties; after all, each was fostered
by an idealistic disregard for the
law. Yet President Nixon chose to
ignore the fundamental
contradicitions in his analogy.
Difference Of Intent
The vast majority of the peace
and civil rights protestors, through
illegal, yet peaceful, protest
activity, and subsequent
submission for punishment,
sought to call attention to their
"causes," and reform the laws of
the system they disrupted.
The same can hardly be said of
the Watergate conspirators;
indeed, quite the contrary. Theirs
was not an attempt to change an

unjust law, merely to bypass an
inconvenient one; hence the
attempts to hide their pious fraud,
with pseudonyms, red wigs, and
phony glasses. And of course,
every attempt has been made to
avoid prosecution.
Such fallacious reasoning is
becoming the rule of, rather than
the exception to, the President's
recent public statements. Perhaps
the most evident "bluff" was
President Nixon's presentation of
his special legislative package to
the Congress.
Dramatic Reversal
In a dramatic reversal of his
1972 campaign stand on domestic
issues ("I don't need a platform, I
can walk on water"), Mr. Nixon
cast himself in the role of the
statesman trying to govern despite
an unruly legislature.
He complained that the
Democratic Congress was
investigating Presidential
campaign practices at the expense
of the "important issues" of the
nation; his statement comes in
seeming ignorance of the fact that
only a fraction of the Senate is at
all involved in the Watergate
inquiry.
Weak Arguments
But the manpower
mathematics of the Watergate
committee are not Mr. Nixon's

primary concern. By re-opening
the familiar Democratic/
Republican chasm between the
White House and Capitol Hill, he
is using labels as his arguments. By
imposing party lines on a
non-partisan issue, President
Nixon hopes to divert full
attention from the national
scandal at hand. For the sake of
obscuring wrongdoing in his own
administration, the President is
reviving that same partisanism
which his famous "bring us
together" slogan tried to
eliminate.
President Nixon's recent
comments and addresses are
merely the latest in a series of
equivocal rebuttals on Watergate.
Insinuations concerning
Communist funding of the
Democratic Party, inuendoes
purporting eavesdropping by
Democratic candidates, allegations
of persecution by the Senate's
Campaign Practices Committee,
and persistent reminders of the
Chappaquidick incident — all are
statements designed to resolve the
Watergate crisis by obscuring it
from public view. Perhaps Mr.
Nixon's self-named
"counter-offensive" is more
correctly termed a smokescreen.

As a young Navy lieutenant

Nixon was looked upon by all his
fellow officers as a naive young
