Engineer Admission
Editor:
In response to the article by
Lobsenz and Hemel concerning
preferential admission of
engineers (October 1): admissions
policy is a compromise. Desired
aspects of the Freshman class
include high academic quality,
ethnic, rural/urban and geographic
balance, athletic ability, etc. It is

also desired to use fully the
resources of the University.
The intended virtue of the
statistical favoritism afforded
prospective engineers for the
moment is the utilization of the
Engineering faculty and facilities.
Unlike community colleges,
established scholarly institutions
cannot rapidly change the
composition of their faculty and
maintain its quality.
One solution is to admit by
major (as is done at some
schools). The practice here is to
make adjustments within the
middle group of applicants (all of
quite respectable quality) year by
year as preferences for majors
change. To accept, say, 80 percent
pre-meds overburdens the relevant
faculty and shortchanges the
admittees through large class size,
overcrowded labs, stopgap
faculty, etc. Rest assured that
Engineers would be disfavored
were they applying in excessive
proportion.
It makes some sense to play to
the strength of the University.
The above is the rationale
requested in the Daily.
Trade offs are made. If Messrs.
Lobsenz and Hemel, or any other
reader wishes to propose a single
clear uncompromising standard,
please advance it.
Channels for involvement with
the Committee are: written
request to the Chairman, phone
call or visit with him, written /oral
presentation to the committee
(pages of the Daily optional). No
one was denied access last year.
Implementation of change would
involve Committee approval and
finally a vote by the Senate.

Despite Assemblymen
Vasconcellos, Gonzales and

Brown's appeal to my personal
greed (Letters, Oct. 1), I choose
not to join them in their crusade
for big and bigger government
through the defeat of Proposition
1'
I choose not to because I know
that if "arbitrary limits" are not
placed on state spending over the
next 10 years, no limits will be
placed at all. The assemblymen
complain that the proposition
"radically limits the power of the
Legislature to govern;" in truth,
Prop. 1 restricts the
assemblymen's power to tax.
When the lifeline of the politician
is threatened, the orchestrated
squeals are to be expected.
Californians will have on
November 6 a once-in-a-lifetime
chance to stop the growth of
leviathan-like government in this
state. I'm not going to pass up the
opportunity.

Editor:
It was indeed enlightening to
learn from your diligent
correspondent Linda Crouse, late
of Venceremos, that revolution is
a long, hard, complicated, tedious
(etc.) job. Ms. Crouse greatly
broadens the perspectives of us
moribund and benighted scholars
(ah, barely worthy of that name!)
I was especially taken by her
statement that revolution is "no
tea-party" .. . how pithy and to
the point! It is transcending
originality and analysis like this
that leads me to say a simple
prayer of thanks each morning for
my presence at this great
institution.
