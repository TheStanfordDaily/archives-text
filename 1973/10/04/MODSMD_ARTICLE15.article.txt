# White House Cites Achievement
## Djerassi To Get National Award 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C. - A
48-year-old Chemistry Prof., Carl
Djerassi, is the youngest of 11
scientists who will receive the
nation's highest award for
distinguished achievements in
science, mathematics and
engineering at a White House
presentation ceremony next
Wednesday.
According to a White House
announcement yesterday, Djerassi
will receive the National Medal of
Science "in recognition of his
major contributions to the
elucidation of the complex
chemistry of the steroid
hormones, and to the application
of these compounds to medicinal
chemistry and population control
by means of oral contraceptives."
Besides his renown as a
principal developer of "the pill,"
Djerassi is noted for his work in
the chemistry of natural products
(antibiotics, alkaloids, steroids
and terpenoids), in medicinal
chemistry (antihistimines), in
anti-inflammatory agents, and for
organic chemical measurement
techniques (optical rotatory
dispersion, magnetic circular
dichroism, and mass
spectrometry).

In addition to his teaching and
research here, Djerassi heads the
Zoecon Corp. of Palo Alto, a new
firm developing "natural"
insecticides that fight insect pests
by interfering with their growth
or reproduction. Such compounds
are designed to eliminate insects
selectively without harming
animals, man or the environment.
Earlier he was president of
Syntex Research, a position he
relinquished to become president
and chairman of Zoecon.
Djerassi is the author or
coauthor of six books and nearly
800 research papers in chemistry.
He is a member of the National
Academy of Sciences, the
American Academy of Arts and
Sciences, and of numerous other
U.S. and foreign professional
organizations.
Another recipient of the medal
will be a Stanford alumnus,
President Frederick Seitz, 62, of
the Rockefeller University in New
Yrok. In 1970 another Stanford
faculty member, Wolfgang K.H.
Panofsky, director of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center, also
received the National Medal of
Science.
Other scientists who will

receive the medal next Wednesday
are Daniel I. Arnon, 63, chairman
of the Department of Cell
Physiology at UC—Berkeley's
Agricultural Experiment Station;
Harold E. Edgerton, 70, emeritus
professor of electrical engineering
at MIT; William Maurice Ewing,
67, chief of the Earth and
Planetary Sciences Division of the
University of Texas Marine
Biomedical Institute; Arie Jan
Haagensmit, 72, Caltech
biochemist and smog authority;
Vladimir Haensel, 59, vice
president for science and
technology at Universal Oil
Products Co.; Earl W. Sutherland,
58, 1971 Nobel laureate in
medicine and University of Miami
professor of biochemistry; John
W. Tukey, 58, mathematician at
Princeton and Bell Laboratories;
Richard T. Whitcomb, 51,
aeronautical engineer at
NASA-Langley Research Center;
and Robert R. Wilson, 64,
director of the Natinal
Accelerator Laboratory at
Batavia, 111.
The National Medal of Science
was established in 1959 by
Congress. It is awarded to persons
judged "deserving of special

recognition by reason of their
outstanding contributions to
knowledge in the physical,
biological, mathematical or
engineering sciences."

Djerassi is the author or
coauthor of six books and nearly
800 research papers in chemistry.
He is a member of the National
Academy of Sciences, the
American Academy of Arts and
Sciences, and of numerous other
U.S. and foreign professional
organizations.
Another recipient of the medal
will be a Stanford alumnus,
President Frederick Seitz, 62, of
the Rockefeller University in New
Yrok. In 1970 another Stanford
faculty member, Wolfgang K.H.
Panofsky, director of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center, also
received the National Medal of
Science.
Other scientists who will

receive the medal next Wednesday
are Daniel I. Arnon, 63, chairman
of the Department of Cell
Physiology at UC—Berkeley's
Agricultural Experiment Station;
Harold E. Edgerton, 70, emeritus
professor of electrical engineering
at MIT; William Maurice Ewing,
67, chief of the Earth and
Planetary Sciences Division of the
University of Texas Marine
Biomedical Institute; Arie Jan
Haagensmit, 72, Caltech
biochemist and smog authority;
Vladimir Haensel, 59, vice
president for science and
technology at Universal Oil
Products Co.; Earl W. Sutherland,
58, 1971 Nobel laureate in
medicine and University of Miami
professor of biochemistry; John
W. Tukey, 58, mathematician at
Princeton and Bell Laboratories;
Richard T. Whitcomb, 51,
aeronautical engineer at
NASA-Langley Research Center;
and Robert R. Wilson, 64,
director of the Natinal
Accelerator Laboratory at
Batavia, 111.
The National Medal of Science
was established in 1959 by
Congress. It is awarded to persons
judged "deserving of special

recognition by reason of their
outstanding contributions to
knowledge in the physical,
biological, mathematical or
engineering sciences."


CARL DJERASSI
WASHINGTON, D.C. - A
48-year-old Chemistry Prof., Carl
Djerassi, is the youngest of 11
scientists who will receive the
nation's highest award for
distinguished achievements in
science, mathematics and
engineering at a White House
presentation ceremony next
Wednesday.
According to a White House
announcement yesterday, Djerassi
will receive the National Medal of
Science "in recognition of his
major contributions to the
elucidation of the complex
chemistry of the steroid
hormones, and to the application
of these compounds to medicinal
chemistry and population control
by means of oral contraceptives."
Besides his renown as a
principal developer of "the pill,"
Djerassi is noted for his work in
the chemistry of natural products
(antibiotics, alkaloids, steroids
and terpenoids), in medicinal
chemistry (antihistimines), in
anti-inflammatory agents, and for
organic chemical measurement
techniques (optical rotatory
dispersion, magnetic circular
dichroism, and mass
spectrometry).

In addition to his teaching and
research here, Djerassi heads the
Zoecon Corp. of Palo Alto, a new
firm developing "natural"
insecticides that fight insect pests
by interfering with their growth
or reproduction. Such compounds
are designed to eliminate insects
selectively without harming
animals, man or the environment.
Earlier he was president of
Syntex Research, a position he
relinquished to become president
and chairman of Zoecon.
Djerassi is the author or
coauthor of six books and nearly
800 research papers in chemistry.
He is a member of the National
Academy of Sciences, the
American Academy of Arts and
Sciences, and of numerous other
U.S. and foreign professional
