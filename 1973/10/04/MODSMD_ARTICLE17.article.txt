# Stanford – Berkeley Survey
## Local Voters Disenchanted 
### 
The level of political
disenchantment is higher in the
Bay Area than in the rest of the
country and it started long before
Watergate, a joint
Stanford-University of California
opinion survey revealed last
month.
In a selected sample of 1000
persons in five Bay Area counties,
more than half said they were
"somewhat" or "very dissatisfied"
with the leadership of the
country.
More than half also said there
was a need for "some change" in
the governmental system.
Those polled ranged from
rock-ribbed Republican to far-left
radical, reported Paul M.
Sniderman of Stanford's Institute
for Political Studies, who worked
with UC-Berkeley political
scientists on the 1972-73 survey.
They found many respondents

had become dissatisfied as early as
1964, and more so since 1968
especially among blacks.
'Hostility To President'
"Hostility to the incumbent
President is only a part of it,"
Sniderman said. "Disaffection is
not a passing phenomenon; it's
not related to one's status in
society."
A preliminary report on the
survey was made early last month
at the New Orelans meeting of the
American Political Science
Association by Jack Citrin of UC's
Survey Research Center.
Two others from Berkeley,
Herbert McClosky and J. Merrill
Shanks, worked with Citrin and
Sniderman on the research.
The researchers are now
quizzing a smaller sample of 150
persons, ranging from those most
allegiant to the most alienated
from the government.
Watergate Effects
A special report on their
reactions to the Watergate scandal
is due at the end of this month.
The original survey was made
during 1972-73 in San Francisco,
Alameda, Contra Costa, San
Mateo, and northern Santa Clara
counties.
Fifty-seven percent of those
queried said that "you could trust
the government to do what's
right" only "some" or "none" of
the time.
One-third of the respondents
agreed with the statement that
there was "something very wrong
with the shape of the country."
Previous Studies
Previous national studies had
shown that disaffection related to
the older age brackets, Sniderman
reported. The new study shows
more alienation among the
18-to-21 age group, with
dissatisfaction greatest of all
among blacks.
"We found no blacks of either
sex under 40 who could be classed
as allegiant," the least disaffected
category, he noted.
Persons who once turned away

from politics are now getting into
various forms of protest, the
researchers said. These include
boycotts, peaceful
demonstrations, illegal but
peaceful demonstrations, and
outright violence.
"There seems to be no
correlation between alienation
and the quality of life of the
respondents," Sniderman
observed. The investigators
discovered that 41 percent of
those with incomes of $15,000
per year or more were dissatisfied
with their standard of living,
among other things.
No Correlation
"There was only a weak
relationship between income and
orientation toward the system,"
Sniderman reported.
"We also found that the
'allegedly isolated' — the poor, the
elderly and retired, and those with
no organizational affiliations —
were more likely to defer to
political authority than the
socially integrated."
The less well-educated were
found to be the most allegiant,
the survey indicated.
Remarkably, 44 percent of the
"educated poor" — mainly
nonworking wives of college
students — scored high on the
alienation scale.
Survey Statistics
Asked to pick from a list of
adjectives that best described the
national government, nearly 61
percent of 176 persons classified
as allegiant selected "honest."
Only 4.4 percent of the alienated

selected the word.
Again, more than 70 percent of
the alienated picked "unfair," to
2.3 percent of the allegiant.
Comparable discrepancies
occurred in the selection of such
adjectives as "helpful,"
"dependable," and "democratic."
But more than half of the
allegiants picked "wasteful" as a
descriptive adjective, as did 79
percent of the alienated.
Issue Positions
The 46-page report also went
into respondents' feelings
concerning crime in the streets,
moral standards, and asked them
to name the most important issues
of the day.

the older age brackets, Sniderman
reported. The new study shows
more alienation among the
18-to-21 age group, with
dissatisfaction greatest of all
among blacks.
"We found no blacks of either
sex under 40 who could be classed
as allegiant," the least disaffected
category, he noted.
Persons who once turned away

from politics are now getting into
various forms of protest, the
researchers said. These include
boycotts, peaceful
demonstrations, illegal but
peaceful demonstrations, and
outright violence.
"There seems to be no
correlation between alienation
and the quality of life of the
respondents," Sniderman
observed. The investigators
discovered that 41 percent of
those with incomes of $15,000
per year or more were dissatisfied
with their standard of living,
among other things.
No Correlation
"There was only a weak
relationship between income and
orientation toward the system,"
Sniderman reported.
"We also found that the
'allegedly isolated' — the poor, the
elderly and retired, and those with
no organizational affiliations —
were more likely to defer to
political authority than the
socially integrated."
The less well-educated were
found to be the most allegiant,
the survey indicated.
Remarkably, 44 percent of the
"educated poor" — mainly
nonworking wives of college
students — scored high on the
alienation scale.
Survey Statistics
Asked to pick from a list of
adjectives that best described the
national government, nearly 61
percent of 176 persons classified
as allegiant selected "honest."
Only 4.4 percent of the alienated

selected the word.
Again, more than 70 percent of
the alienated picked "unfair," to
2.3 percent of the allegiant.
Comparable discrepancies
occurred in the selection of such
adjectives as "helpful,"
"dependable," and "democratic."
But more than half of the
allegiants picked "wasteful" as a
descriptive adjective, as did 79
percent of the alienated.
Issue Positions
The 46-page report also went
into respondents' feelings
concerning crime in the streets,
moral standards, and asked them
to name the most important issues
of the day.

SAM'S HIS MAN — Dave Oke, an employee in the General Secretary's office in Encina Hall, helped to
form the Sam Ervin Fan Club this summer. Oke called Ervin "a genuine folk hero . . . basicallv
representing integrity in government." The group issues free membership cards and has "Uncle Sam
T-shirts, buttons and posters available for sale.
The level of political
disenchantment is higher in the
Bay Area than in the rest of the
country and it started long before
Watergate, a joint
Stanford-University of California
opinion survey revealed last
month.
In a selected sample of 1000
persons in five Bay Area counties,
more than half said they were
"somewhat" or "very dissatisfied"
with the leadership of the
country.
More than half also said there
was a need for "some change" in
the governmental system.
Those polled ranged from
rock-ribbed Republican to far-left
radical, reported Paul M.
Sniderman of Stanford's Institute
for Political Studies, who worked
with UC-Berkeley political
scientists on the 1972-73 survey.
They found many respondents

had become dissatisfied as early as
1964, and more so since 1968
especially among blacks.
'Hostility To President'
"Hostility to the incumbent
President is only a part of it,"
Sniderman said. "Disaffection is
not a passing phenomenon; it's
not related to one's status in
society."
A preliminary report on the
survey was made early last month
at the New Orelans meeting of the
American Political Science
Association by Jack Citrin of UC's
Survey Research Center.
Two others from Berkeley,
Herbert McClosky and J. Merrill
Shanks, worked with Citrin and
Sniderman on the research.
The researchers are now
quizzing a smaller sample of 150
persons, ranging from those most
allegiant to the most alienated
from the government.
Watergate Effects
A special report on their
reactions to the Watergate scandal
is due at the end of this month.
The original survey was made
during 1972-73 in San Francisco,
Alameda, Contra Costa, San
Mateo, and northern Santa Clara
counties.
Fifty-seven percent of those
queried said that "you could trust
the government to do what's
right" only "some" or "none" of
the time.
One-third of the respondents
agreed with the statement that
there was "something very wrong
with the shape of the country."

The level of political
disenchantment is higher in the
Bay Area than in the rest of the
country and it started long before
Watergate, a joint
Stanford-University of California
opinion survey revealed last
month.
In a selected sample of 1000
persons in five Bay Area counties,
more than half said they were
"somewhat" or "very dissatisfied"
with the leadership of the
country.
More than half also said there
was a need for "some change" in
the governmental system.
Those polled ranged from
rock-ribbed Republican to far-left
radical, reported Paul M.
Sniderman of Stanford's Institute
for Political Studies, who worked
with UC-Berkeley political
scientists on the 1972-73 survey.
They found many respondents

had become dissatisfied as early as
1964, and more so since 1968
especially among blacks.
'Hostility To President'
"Hostility to the incumbent
President is only a part of it,"
Sniderman said. "Disaffection is
not a passing phenomenon; it's
not related to one's status in
society."
A preliminary report on the
survey was made early last month
at the New Orelans meeting of the
American Political Science
Association by Jack Citrin of UC's
Survey Research Center.
Two others from Berkeley,
Herbert McClosky and J. Merrill
Shanks, worked with Citrin and
Sniderman on the research.
The researchers are now
quizzing a smaller sample of 150
persons, ranging from those most
allegiant to the most alienated
from the government.
Watergate Effects
A special report on their
reactions to the Watergate scandal
is due at the end of this month.
The original survey was made
during 1972-73 in San Francisco,
Alameda, Contra Costa, San
Mateo, and northern Santa Clara
counties.
Fifty-seven percent of those
queried said that "you could trust
the government to do what's
right" only "some" or "none" of
the time.
One-third of the respondents
agreed with the statement that
there was "something very wrong
with the shape of the country."
Previous Studies
Previous national studies had
shown that disaffection related to
the older age brackets, Sniderman
reported. The new study shows
more alienation among the
18-to-21 age group, with
dissatisfaction greatest of all
among blacks.
"We found no blacks of either
sex under 40 who could be classed
as allegiant," the least disaffected
category, he noted.
Persons who once turned away

from politics are now getting into
various forms of protest, the
researchers said. These include
boycotts, peaceful
demonstrations, illegal but
peaceful demonstrations, and
outright violence.
"There seems to be no
correlation between alienation
and the quality of life of the
respondents," Sniderman
observed. The investigators
discovered that 41 percent of
those with incomes of $15,000
per year or more were dissatisfied
with their standard of living,
among other things.
No Correlation
"There was only a weak
relationship between income and
orientation toward the system,"
Sniderman reported.
"We also found that the
'allegedly isolated' — the poor, the
elderly and retired, and those with
no organizational affiliations —
were more likely to defer to
political authority than the
socially integrated."
The less well-educated were
found to be the most allegiant,
the survey indicated.
Remarkably, 44 percent of the
"educated poor" — mainly
nonworking wives of college
students — scored high on the
alienation scale.
Survey Statistics
Asked to pick from a list of
adjectives that best described the
national government, nearly 61
percent of 176 persons classified
as allegiant selected "honest."
Only 4.4 percent of the alienated

selected the word.
Again, more than 70 percent of
the alienated picked "unfair," to
2.3 percent of the allegiant.
Comparable discrepancies
occurred in the selection of such
adjectives as "helpful,"
"dependable," and "democratic."
But more than half of the
allegiants picked "wasteful" as a
descriptive adjective, as did 79
percent of the alienated.
Issue Positions
The 46-page report also went
into respondents' feelings
concerning crime in the streets,
moral standards, and asked them
to name the most important issues
of the day.
