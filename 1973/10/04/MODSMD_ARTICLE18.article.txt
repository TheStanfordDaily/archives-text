SACRAMENTO (AP) ~
Legislation to add a student
member to the board of turstees
of the California State University
and Colleges has been vetoed by
Gov. Ronald Reagan.
In a veto message Tuesday,
Reagan said the bill by Sen.
Milton Marks, D-San Francisco,
"would change the nature of the
board, hindering the trustees'
ability to function as an objective
governing board overseeing the
general direction" of the
institution.
"Faculty and students now are
provided full opportunity to be
heard and to participate in
discussion during trustee
meetings. This bill would limit
opinion to a single representative
to no advantage to students in
general," Reagan wrote.
The bill is SB 1168.
