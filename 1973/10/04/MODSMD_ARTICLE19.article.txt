# Detroit Edison Appeals Damage Suit
## 
### 
DETROIT (AP) â€” The Detroit Edison Co.
yesterday appealed a federal court decision
ordering the company to pay $4 million in
punitive damages for racial discrimination.
U.S. District Court Judge Damon Keith
handed down the ruling Tuesday in a 1971
suit filed by three black Edison employees
against Local 17 of the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
"There's no doubt in my mind that this has
to help minority employees around the
country," said apprentice electrician Willie
Stamps, 33, who initiated the suit. "I'm still
in a state of shock."

Judge Keith said Edison and the union
local had engaged in "systematic
discrimination" in the hiring and promotion
of blacks.
Keith cited testimony that Edison
interviewers, as far back as the 19505, placed a
black dot on the applications of some black
persons.
Testimony indicated "that the black dot
was used to perpetuate and maintain blacks in
low-paying positions," Keith ruled. The
company says it was used as a gauge of
progress in black hiring.
Leon Cohan, Edison vice president, termed

the decision "wrong, just wrong."
"We believe the court decision is wrong on
the facts, wrong on the law, and wrong in the
extreme remedies it has ordered," Cohan said.
He told reporters the black dot is no longer
used by Edison.
Keith ordered Edison, which reported
eamingsof $91 million in the last 12 months,
to set aside $4 million to pay out damages to
blacks who were discriminated against in
hiring or promotions.
The judge is to decide later how the
ultimate damages will be divided among
hundreds of potential claimants, including the
three named in the suit.
