# Tenure Policy Tightening
## Fewer Junior Faculty Promotions Seen 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
Junior faculty here are a little bit
uncomfortable these days — and with
good reason.
The University's promotion and
tenure policies, after two decades of
liberal promotion of assistant
professors, are undergoing a basic
shift.
As a result, promotions — on all
levels — will be a lot harder to come
by for as many as 15 years, as will
teaching positions for thousands of
new Ph.D.'s.
The problem is a surplus of tenured
faculty — professors and most
associate professors — and a
consequent shortage of positions for
nontenured assistant professors to
move into. The reason for this
problem is an end to the University's
years of postwar expansion, during
which, Humanities and Sciences Dean
Halsey Royden freely admitted, "We
promoted more assistant professors
than we should have."
Many of the basic policy decisions
have not yet been made. "We're still
looking into it to see how bad it is,"

Royden said. "I certainly don't want
to wave any red flags. I don't know
what the facts are going to show, but I
do think the apprehensions of some of
the faculty — although I certainly
can't judge what their apprehensions
are — are exaggerated."
Decreased Promotions
But University administrators admit
privately that the problem may be
very bad indeed. While many
institutions suffer from a "middle-level
faculty glut," one high official
suggested, Stanford suffers from a
"high-level faculty glut" — and the
University response may be to
decrease promotions from associate
professor to full professor to almost
zero.
Among leading universities,
Stanford has one of the highest ratios
of tenured to nontenured faculty —
about 70 percent in the School of
Humanities and Sciences, where the
problem may be less acute than in
other schools.
During the 1960'5, roughly half of
all assistant professors who were

reappointed to second three-year
contracts eventually gained tenured
positions.
That high percentage paralleled a
high rate of faculty growth: the
number of Academic Council members
rose 28 percent between 1965 and
1972, while the student population
increased by less than five percent.
'Some Tightening'
Hence, said Royden, there
"probably will be some tightening" of
appointment and promotion
standards. "It's just in the nature of
things," he said.
Nevertheless, the problem
apparently went unnoticed by
administrators until after the current
academic budget crunch began. The
ratio of tenured to nontenured faculty
has not changed appreciably since
1969; the number of professors and
associate professors has actually
declined from 716 to 700 (from 316
to 78 in the School of Humanities and
Sciences alone). At the same time, the
number of nontenured assistant
professors has increased from 279 to

296 (in Humanities and Sciences, from
107 to 120).
Among the new policies under
consideration, administrators said, is
the institution of short, fixed-term
appointments for assistant professors
— without the possibility of tenure.
But junior faculty have cautioned that
such appointments — similar to those
long in use at Harvard — would mean a
basic change in the role of nontenured
faculty.
External Reputation
"If an assistant professor knows
that he will be here for only a short
period of time, he is likely to be
concerned primarily with his external
reputation, and that means the quality
of his research," Ronald Mellor,
assistant professor of classics, said. "If,
however, he expects to be at Stanford
for some time, he will be more
concerned as well with his reputation
inside the University — and that means
a commitment to teaching and to
University service."
Others have cautioned that tighter
promotion policies may make it
difficult to recruit good new teachers,
and difficult to keep the best of those
recruited. Psychology Prof. Albert
Hastorf, Roy den's predecessor as
Humanities and Sciences dean, pqinted
out last year that withholding tenure
can be an uncomfortable policy.
"The better a job Stanford does of
recruiting, the more likely it is that we
won't be able to keep some really
good people. Often this can put
departments in a difficult position in
relation to their students, who may
well ask why some excellent teacher
wasn't kept on," Hastorf said.
But Royden believes diminished
chances for gaining tenure will not
discourage scholars from coming here.
"I don't really see any problem at
all there," he said. "I'm not at all
convinced that we cannot be very
attractive to junior faculty ... as long
as there are decent jobs to go to after
their term is up."

concerned as well with his reputation
inside the University — and that means
a commitment to teaching and to
University service."
Others have cautioned that tighter
promotion policies may make it
difficult to recruit good new teachers,
and difficult to keep the best of those
recruited. Psychology Prof. Albert
Hastorf, Roy den's predecessor as
Humanities and Sciences dean, pqinted
out last year that withholding tenure
can be an uncomfortable policy.
"The better a job Stanford does of
recruiting, the more likely it is that we
won't be able to keep some really
good people. Often this can put
departments in a difficult position in
relation to their students, who may
well ask why some excellent teacher
wasn't kept on," Hastorf said.
But Royden believes diminished
chances for gaining tenure will not
discourage scholars from coming here.
"I don't really see any problem at
all there," he said. "I'm not at all
convinced that we cannot be very
attractive to junior faculty ... as long
as there are decent jobs to go to after
their term is up."
Junior faculty here are a little bit
uncomfortable these days — and with
good reason.
The University's promotion and
tenure policies, after two decades of
liberal promotion of assistant
professors, are undergoing a basic
shift.
As a result, promotions — on all
levels — will be a lot harder to come
by for as many as 15 years, as will
teaching positions for thousands of
new Ph.D.'s.
The problem is a surplus of tenured
faculty — professors and most
associate professors — and a
consequent shortage of positions for
nontenured assistant professors to
move into. The reason for this
problem is an end to the University's
years of postwar expansion, during
which, Humanities and Sciences Dean
Halsey Royden freely admitted, "We
promoted more assistant professors
than we should have."
Many of the basic policy decisions
have not yet been made. "We're still
looking into it to see how bad it is,"

Royden said. "I certainly don't want
to wave any red flags. I don't know
what the facts are going to show, but I
do think the apprehensions of some of
the faculty — although I certainly
can't judge what their apprehensions
are — are exaggerated."
Decreased Promotions
But University administrators admit
privately that the problem may be
very bad indeed. While many
institutions suffer from a "middle-level
faculty glut," one high official
suggested, Stanford suffers from a
"high-level faculty glut" — and the
University response may be to
decrease promotions from associate
professor to full professor to almost
zero.
Among leading universities,
Stanford has one of the highest ratios
of tenured to nontenured faculty —
about 70 percent in the School of
Humanities and Sciences, where the
problem may be less acute than in
other schools.
During the 1960'5, roughly half of
all assistant professors who were

reappointed to second three-year
contracts eventually gained tenured
positions.
That high percentage paralleled a
high rate of faculty growth: the
number of Academic Council members
rose 28 percent between 1965 and
1972, while the student population
increased by less than five percent.
'Some Tightening'
Hence, said Royden, there
"probably will be some tightening" of
appointment and promotion
standards. "It's just in the nature of
things," he said.
Nevertheless, the problem
apparently went unnoticed by
administrators until after the current
academic budget crunch began. The
ratio of tenured to nontenured faculty
has not changed appreciably since
1969; the number of professors and
associate professors has actually
declined from 716 to 700 (from 316
to 78 in the School of Humanities and
Sciences alone). At the same time, the
number of nontenured assistant
professors has increased from 279 to

296 (in Humanities and Sciences, from
107 to 120).
Among the new policies under
consideration, administrators said, is
the institution of short, fixed-term
appointments for assistant professors
— without the possibility of tenure.
But junior faculty have cautioned that
such appointments — similar to those
long in use at Harvard — would mean a
basic change in the role of nontenured
faculty.
External Reputation
"If an assistant professor knows
that he will be here for only a short
period of time, he is likely to be
concerned primarily with his external
reputation, and that means the quality
of his research," Ronald Mellor,
assistant professor of classics, said. "If,
however, he expects to be at Stanford
for some time, he will be more
concerned as well with his reputation
inside the University — and that means
a commitment to teaching and to
University service."

declined from 716 to 700 (from 316
to 78 in the School of Humanities and
Sciences alone). At the same time, the
number of nontenured assistant
professors has increased from 279 to

296 (in Humanities and Sciences, from
107 to 120).
Among the new policies under
consideration, administrators said, is
the institution of short, fixed-term
appointments for assistant professors
— without the possibility of tenure.
But junior faculty have cautioned that
such appointments — similar to those
long in use at Harvard — would mean a
basic change in the role of nontenured
faculty.
External Reputation
"If an assistant professor knows
that he will be here for only a short
period of time, he is likely to be
concerned primarily with his external
reputation, and that means the quality
of his research," Ronald Mellor,
assistant professor of classics, said. "If,
however, he expects to be at Stanford
for some time, he will be more
concerned as well with his reputation
inside the University — and that means
a commitment to teaching and to
University service."
Others have cautioned that tighter
promotion policies may make it
difficult to recruit good new teachers,
and difficult to keep the best of those
recruited. Psychology Prof. Albert
Hastorf, Roy den's predecessor as
Humanities and Sciences dean, pqinted
out last year that withholding tenure
can be an uncomfortable policy.
"The better a job Stanford does of
recruiting, the more likely it is that we
won't be able to keep some really
good people. Often this can put
departments in a difficult position in
relation to their students, who may
well ask why some excellent teacher
wasn't kept on," Hastorf said.
But Royden believes diminished
chances for gaining tenure will not
discourage scholars from coming here.
"I don't really see any problem at
all there," he said. "I'm not at all
convinced that we cannot be very
attractive to junior faculty ... as long
as there are decent jobs to go to after
their term is up."
