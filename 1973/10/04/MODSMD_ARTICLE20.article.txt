# Big Band Swing Kings Resurrect Bygone Era
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO - The Big
Band Cavalcade, an entourage of
favorites of the 40s, appeared at
the Masonic Auditorium last
Saturday night.
Touring under the assumption
that there are still a lot of people
who want to hear Big Band music,
a disappointingly small audience
greeted the Cavalcade in San
Francisco, although it had played
to a sell-out crowd Friday night at
Oakland's refurbished Paramount
Theater.
The show included band
leaders Bob Crosby, Art Mooney,
and Freddy Martin who took
turns conducting a 14-piece band
which included trombonist Buddy
Morrow and clarinetist Peanuts
Hucko. Songstress Margaret
Whiting provided the vocals.
The Cavalcade was originally
Freddy Martin's idea, and he
opened the show. He occasionally
played saxophone, and led the
band through a medley of his
bigger hits.
Martin was once famous for his
Big Band arrangements of classical
pieces, like "Warsaw Concerto,"
"Sabre Dance," and "Bumble
Boogie" ("Flight of the Bumble
Bee"). Martin and the band
members also sang "I've Got A
Lovely Bunch Of Coconuts,"
which was a bit hit for Martin
when his featured vocalist was
Merv Griffin.
Margaret Whiting took the
stage next and was the biggest
success of the evening.
She first sang a medley of hits
of the 40s which included "Time
Goes By," "Don't Sit Under The
Apple Tree," and "Boogie Woogie
Bugle Boy," made popular by the
Andrews Sisters and Bette Midler
thirty years later.
Whiting also sang a medley of
songs written by her father,
Richard Whiting, who wrote
"Ain't We Got Fun," "Louise,"
and "Goodship Lollypop," among
others.
Art Mooney then led the band
(and audience) through his hits
"Baby Face" and "I'm Looking

Over A Four Leaf Clover." Bob
Crosby, younger brother of Bing,
was next. Crosby is famous for his
Dixieland band, The Bobcats.
With Crosby at the helm, the
band gave out some of its best
performances of the night, such as
"Jazz Band Ball," "Sweet Georgia
Brown," "South Rampart Street
Parade," and "Basin Street
Blues," with vocal by Crosby.
"Do You Know What It Means To
Miss New Orleans," featured a
fantastic clarinet solo by Peanuts
Hucko, who used to be the
resident clarinetist on The
Lawrence Welk Show.
To end the show Freddy
Martin conducted the band in a
tribute to some of the great band
leaders, running through numbers
by Paul Whiteman, Clyde McCoy,
Harry James, Benny Goodman,

Glenn Miller, Duke Ellington,
Count Basie, and others.
During the show Bob Crosby
referred to himself and the other
members of the Cavalcade as
"dinosaurs of the Swing Era." The
purpose of the Big Band
Cavalcade is to try to revive
interest and support for Swing
music.
But, while these numbers from
the 40s evoke many memories for
those who were there at the time,
songs like "This Is The Army, Mr.
Jones" have little meaning for
today's younger generation.
Hopefully Big Band jazz will
return. But, for it to do so, more
band leaders will have to follow
the examples set by Duke
Ellington and Count Basie by
continuing to write new, lively
jazz compositions.

MOTT THE WHO? — Mott the Hoople, a hard-rock band with the
dubious distinction of remaining virtually unknown in the U.S. after
releasing six albums, entertained hard-core Bay Area acid rock fans
last weekend at Winterland. If the audience's near failure to call them
back for an encore serves as an indication, the group is destined to
remain obscure.

success of the evening.
She first sang a medley of hits
of the 40s which included "Time
Goes By," "Don't Sit Under The
Apple Tree," and "Boogie Woogie
Bugle Boy," made popular by the
Andrews Sisters and Bette Midler
thirty years later.
Whiting also sang a medley of
songs written by her father,
Richard Whiting, who wrote
"Ain't We Got Fun," "Louise,"
and "Goodship Lollypop," among
others.
Art Mooney then led the band
(and audience) through his hits
"Baby Face" and "I'm Looking

Over A Four Leaf Clover." Bob
Crosby, younger brother of Bing,
was next. Crosby is famous for his
Dixieland band, The Bobcats.
With Crosby at the helm, the
band gave out some of its best
performances of the night, such as
"Jazz Band Ball," "Sweet Georgia
Brown," "South Rampart Street
Parade," and "Basin Street
Blues," with vocal by Crosby.
"Do You Know What It Means To
Miss New Orleans," featured a
fantastic clarinet solo by Peanuts
Hucko, who used to be the
resident clarinetist on The
Lawrence Welk Show.
To end the show Freddy
Martin conducted the band in a
tribute to some of the great band
leaders, running through numbers
by Paul Whiteman, Clyde McCoy,
Harry James, Benny Goodman,

Glenn Miller, Duke Ellington,
Count Basie, and others.
During the show Bob Crosby
referred to himself and the other
members of the Cavalcade as
"dinosaurs of the Swing Era." The
purpose of the Big Band
Cavalcade is to try to revive
interest and support for Swing
music.
But, while these numbers from
the 40s evoke many memories for
those who were there at the time,
songs like "This Is The Army, Mr.
Jones" have little meaning for
today's younger generation.
Hopefully Big Band jazz will
return. But, for it to do so, more
band leaders will have to follow
the examples set by Duke
Ellington and Count Basie by
continuing to write new, lively
jazz compositions.

MOTT THE WHO? — Mott the Hoople, a hard-rock band with the
dubious distinction of remaining virtually unknown in the U.S. after
releasing six albums, entertained hard-core Bay Area acid rock fans
last weekend at Winterland. If the audience's near failure to call them
back for an encore serves as an indication, the group is destined to
remain obscure.
SAN FRANCISCO - The Big
Band Cavalcade, an entourage of
favorites of the 40s, appeared at
the Masonic Auditorium last
Saturday night.
Touring under the assumption
that there are still a lot of people
who want to hear Big Band music,
a disappointingly small audience
greeted the Cavalcade in San
Francisco, although it had played
to a sell-out crowd Friday night at
Oakland's refurbished Paramount
Theater.
The show included band
leaders Bob Crosby, Art Mooney,
and Freddy Martin who took
turns conducting a 14-piece band
which included trombonist Buddy
Morrow and clarinetist Peanuts
Hucko. Songstress Margaret
Whiting provided the vocals.
The Cavalcade was originally
Freddy Martin's idea, and he
opened the show. He occasionally
played saxophone, and led the
band through a medley of his
bigger hits.
Martin was once famous for his
Big Band arrangements of classical
pieces, like "Warsaw Concerto,"
"Sabre Dance," and "Bumble
Boogie" ("Flight of the Bumble
Bee"). Martin and the band
members also sang "I've Got A
Lovely Bunch Of Coconuts,"
which was a bit hit for Martin
when his featured vocalist was
Merv Griffin.
Margaret Whiting took the
stage next and was the biggest
success of the evening.
