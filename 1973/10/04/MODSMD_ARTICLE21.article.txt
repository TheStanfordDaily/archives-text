# Mott The Hoople Invades Winterland
## Obscure Bands Satisfy Acid Rock Fans 
### KEVIN SMITH 
SAN FRANCISCO - Mott the
Hoople? Joe Walsh and the
Barnstormers? The Ronny
Montrose Band? Not exactly
household names, are they?
Yet these three groups treated
last Friday's Winterland audience
to a very satisfying night of good,
hard rock music.
Mott the Hoople (in case your
memory needs refreshing) is the
name of a "heavy" four man
British rock group headed by
pianist lan Hunter.
This group has attained the
remarkable achievement of
remaining virtually unknown in
the United States despite having
recorded six albums since forming
in 1969.
Frankly, the band is good but
not great. Mott was actually
overshadowed by the other two
bands on the bill which are even
less well known.
But Mott still proved to be a

professional, hard-driving band —
especially during what Hunter
called the group's "rock and roll"
songs which got the audience
moving nicely. The group's sound
that is fun to listen to, but not
really innovative or original either.
Mott tried to imitate Led
Zeppelin, and fell predictably
short of the mark.
Hunter continually appeared to
be modeling his every note and
move after Zeppelin's lead singer,
Bobby Plant. Hunter's curly blond
hair and his cavorting with girls in
the audience were reminiscent of
Plant, but that's where the
similarity ended. Hunter doesn't
have either the vocal range or
versatility that Plant does — at
least he didn't exhibit it Friday
night.
Mott the Hoople received less
applause than the other two
bands. It almost looked as if they
wouldn't be back for an encore,
but a persistent bunch of
applauders finally brought them
out to perform one last complete
song, entitled "Walking on the
Mountain."
Best Received
The best-received band of the
night was Joe Walsh and the
Barnstormers, who were
sandwiched in between Roiiny
Montrose and Mott.

This group is currently reaping
the rewards of their Top 40 single
"Rocky Mountain Way" which
sounds like it was sung through an
iron lung.
Walsh, formerly a big man in
the James Gang, has put together
an excellent versatile band. As a
guitarist and singer, Walsh did an
outstanding job with very few
theatrics — just solid musical
talent. The piano player was
superb and the drummer showed
his musical agility by doubling on
the flute.
The band specializes in a
soul-searing, relentless kind of
music characterized by a slow,
persistent beat and repetition of
very engrossing — almost hypnotic
— tunes.
'Rocky Mountain Way'
They did a long, skillful version
of "Rocky Mountain Way," which
brought the audience into a
unified rocking rhythm. Several
other numbers — with
unannounced titles — even
surpassed "Rocky Mountain Way"
(which sounds much better live
than on record) in musical
excellence.
After the band had finished its
set, the crowd gleefully brought
them back for a ten minute
encore which was followed by
such wild cheering that the floor

seemed about ready to
disintegrate under the sustained
enthusiasm of several thousand
foot stompers. The crowd refused
to let up until the band consented
to do a second encore after five
minutes of really frenzied
stomping. The cheering was
well-deserved.
The evening opened with the
Ronny Montrose Band which
turned out to be a very pleasant
surprise. Montrose, who used to
perform in Edgar Winter's White
Trash, did some very strange,
interesting, and innovative things
with his guitar. With the help of
an echo chamber, Montrose
produced an eerie, siren-like
wah-wah effect amidst the
throbbing colored lights of the
Winterland stage.
Chest Fever
The group's lead singer had a
powerful voice — similar to that
of the Who's Roger Daltrey. His
main problem was that he liked to
show off his bare chest too much.
The group displayed interesting
mood shifts mid-song which
helped break up the pace and gave
their show a continual diversity of
changing rhythms and beats.
While constant rhythmic
repetition highlighted Joe Walsh
and the Barnstormers' talents, the
Ronny Montrose Band excelled
by displaying a lot of variation
and innovation with very little
repetition. They, too, were
brought back for an encore.
Music Freaks
The audience itself was as
interesting as the bands. Since
none of the three groups provided
big name drawing power, most of
the 3000 people who attended the
concert were hard core Bay Area
music freaks.
The whole scene turned the
clock back four or five years: it
was an acid rock night with an
acid rock crowd.
The past was all there, from
the acid rock junkies to the unisex
fashions. And listening to the
three bands with their roots in the
acid rock culture, it was hard to
tell the year was 1973.
