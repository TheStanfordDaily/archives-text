# Sumptuous Visual Feast
## Sets Highlight Mozart Opera 
### DOUG SMITH 
SAN FRANCISCO-Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's
1970 production of Cosi Fan Tutte, a feast
for the eye as well as the ear, has returned to
the San Francisco Opera this season. In this
unique interpretation the music and sets blend
to produce an effect of breath-taking
perfection.
Ponnelle's sets, using silhouettes and
perspectives, are all appropriately reminiscent
of the 18th century. They are spare without
being sparse, and they vary in design and
mood to distinguish or interrelate individual
scenes as the plot dictates.
TTie sumptuous final scene, with props and
costumes as rich as a Viennese wedding cake,
is particularly memorable.
This production features a strong, if not
stellar, cast which works together very well.
Since Cosi is the quintessential ensemble
opera, this virtually assures a successful
performance.
Heavenly Precision
John Pritchard, conducting from the
harpsichord, drew admirably precise singing

and playing from the singers and orchestra.
Vocalists and instrumentalists sighed, wept,
and laughed as one in Mozart's heavenly
music.
Evelyn Lear, substituting on short notice
for the indisposed Elizabeth Harwood, sang
the demanding role of Fiordiligi. Although her
mid and low ranges are lovely, Miss Lear's top
range sounds like it is issuing through an
overdriven loudspeaker.
Consequently, her arias, which involve
tremendous leaps and plunges, were uneven.
She managed considerably better in her duets
and in other ensemble work.
Expressive Highlight
Frederica von Stade was outstanding as
Dorabella. She was eminently Mozartian in
her perfect control, her rich tone, her
shimmering top register, and in her elegant
expression. Her duet "II core vi dono" with
Guglielmo in the second act was the highlight
of the evening — an extended, uplifting
moment which approached the divine.
The other female lead, Evelyn Mandac as
the maid Despina, was equally outstanding in

a different way. Her acting was delightful and
her musical characterization of the
mischievous Despina was irresistible.
Baritone Richard Stilwell made a very
auspicious debut in San Francisco with his
role of Guglielmo. He possesses a big, rich,
and solid voice and worked equally well in
solos and ensembles.
Insecure Tenor
Tenor Ryland Davies, on the other hand,
was truly successful only in large ensembles.
In his duets with Fiordiligi he was reasonably
secure, and by "Fra gli amplessi," his final
duet, he had warmed up to the part.
However, he was less than successful in his
solo sections. He strained in his high range,
and he allowed his voice to sob or crack
occasionally, as though he thought he was
singing Donizetti.
Sir Geraint 'Evans rounded out the cast
with his strong portrayal of Don Alfonso.
Although his voice is not what it used to be,
his dramatic conception of the role was
perfect.
Further performances of Cosi Fan Tutte
will take place on Oct. 5,10, and 14.

with his strong portrayal of Don Alfonso.
Although his voice is not what it used to be,
his dramatic conception of the role was
perfect.

SAN FRANCISCO-Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's
1970 production of Cosi Fan Tutte, a feast
for the eye as well as the ear, has returned to
the San Francisco Opera this season. In this
unique interpretation the music and sets blend
to produce an effect of breath-taking
perfection.
Ponnelle's sets, using silhouettes and
perspectives, are all appropriately reminiscent
of the 18th century. They are spare without
being sparse, and they vary in design and
mood to distinguish or interrelate individual
scenes as the plot dictates.
TTie sumptuous final scene, with props and
costumes as rich as a Viennese wedding cake,
is particularly memorable.
This production features a strong, if not
stellar, cast which works together very well.
Since Cosi is the quintessential ensemble
opera, this virtually assures a successful
performance.
Heavenly Precision
John Pritchard, conducting from the
harpsichord, drew admirably precise singing

and playing from the singers and orchestra.
Vocalists and instrumentalists sighed, wept,
and laughed as one in Mozart's heavenly
music.
Evelyn Lear, substituting on short notice
for the indisposed Elizabeth Harwood, sang
the demanding role of Fiordiligi. Although her
mid and low ranges are lovely, Miss Lear's top
range sounds like it is issuing through an
overdriven loudspeaker.
Consequently, her arias, which involve
tremendous leaps and plunges, were uneven.
She managed considerably better in her duets
and in other ensemble work.
Expressive Highlight
Frederica von Stade was outstanding as
Dorabella. She was eminently Mozartian in
her perfect control, her rich tone, her
shimmering top register, and in her elegant
expression. Her duet "II core vi dono" with
Guglielmo in the second act was the highlight
of the evening — an extended, uplifting
moment which approached the divine.
The other female lead, Evelyn Mandac as
the maid Despina, was equally outstanding in

a different way. Her acting was delightful and
her musical characterization of the
mischievous Despina was irresistible.
Baritone Richard Stilwell made a very
auspicious debut in San Francisco with his
role of Guglielmo. He possesses a big, rich,
and solid voice and worked equally well in
solos and ensembles.
Insecure Tenor
Tenor Ryland Davies, on the other hand,
was truly successful only in large ensembles.
In his duets with Fiordiligi he was reasonably
secure, and by "Fra gli amplessi," his final
duet, he had warmed up to the part.
However, he was less than successful in his
solo sections. He strained in his high range,
and he allowed his voice to sob or crack
occasionally, as though he thought he was
singing Donizetti.
Sir Geraint 'Evans rounded out the cast
with his strong portrayal of Don Alfonso.
Although his voice is not what it used to be,
his dramatic conception of the role was
perfect.
Further performances of Cosi Fan Tutte
will take place on Oct. 5,10, and 14.
