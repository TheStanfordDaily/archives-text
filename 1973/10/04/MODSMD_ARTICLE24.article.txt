'Presume Agnew Innocent'- Nixon
WASHINGTON — President Nixon yesterday
acknowledged in a news conference that bribery and
kickback allegations against Vice President Spiro T.
Agnew are "serious and not frivolous" but declared
that the vice president should be presumed
innocent.
Noting the "rather white-hot atmosphere"
swirling around Agnew, Nixon said he hopes Agnew
"will not be tried and convicted in the press and on
television by leaks and innuendoes."
He said he had never asked the vice president to
resign.
Questions about Agnew dominatedthe news
conference. The President, asked whether he
thought a vice president should resign if indicted,
said Agnew's response — that he won't resign — "is
an altogether proper one."
The vice president, Nixon added, "is elected by
all the people. He holds that office in his own right
and the decision as to whether he should resign is
for him to make."
"I have never asked him to resign," the President
said in response to another question.
Nixon said that Agnew "has denied to me
privately on three occasions" that he is guilty of the
allegations leveled against him. And he said he is
"certainly not" doing any contingency planning in
the event Agnew leaves office.
Nixon noted that the allegations "do not relate
in any way to his activities as vice president . ..."
He continued, "There is nothing really that is
more harmful to the rights of an individual than to
be tried and convicted in the press before he has an
opportunity to present his case and I would urge all
of you [the press] ... to make your statements on
the basis of all the evidence . . . and not simply on
the basis of a unilateral charge that is not made
under oath .. ."
Gas Dealers Face Antitrust Suit
SAN FRANCISCO - The U.S. Justice
Department said yesterday it is weighing the
possibility of antitrust action in the face of the
threats of organized shutdowns of independent
service stations.
Mark Anderson, attorney with the department's
antitrust division here said the division is looking
into possible violations of the Sherman Antitrust
Act.
"An agreement to close gas stations may come
under that section," he said. "But the matter is
under investigation only and no action has been
taken."
The statement came while independent service
station operators in California and Nevada were
making final arrangements for what they hope will
be a massive shutdown in protest of Phase 4 ceiling
on retail gasoline prices.
Participating dealers are scheduled to snap the
locks on their pumps at 12:01 a.m. Friday.
They contend they are caught in a profit squeeze
because of inability to pass on to their customers
increases in wholesale prices.
The shutdown may last anywhere from three
days to a week, promoters of the protest said
Wednesday.
But in some areas of California, operators said
they would stay open because they felt that closing
would be ineffective.
Organizations of dealers in Southern California
held a mass meeting in Los Angeles Wednesday

night to coordinate strategy and enlist support of
dealers who hadn't decided to close. Spokesmen
said about 3000 of the 12,000 operators in
Southern California had agreed to close.
Hie California Service Station Dealers
Association was polling dealers in Northern
California to find out whether they would support a
shutdown. Results weren't expected to be known
until Thursday or Friday. Northern California
dealers staged a shutdown from Sept. 21 through
Sept. 24.
San Jose area dealers said they wouldn't close
but would fight in the courts for higher prices.
"We shall continue our service with the hope that
the public will help us in our cause for justice," said
a spokesman for the San Jose chapter of the
National Service Station Dealers Association.
Agnew Jury Warned
BALTIMORE — The Baltimore federal grand
jury investigating Vice President Spiro T. Agnew
was warned by a judge yesterday to disregard news
stories involving the inquiry because they
"frequently are wholly or partially inaccurate."
U.S. District Court Judge Walter E. Hoffman,
specially assigned to handle the Agnew probe,
summoned the jury to an extraordinary public
hearing after meeting privately for an hour and a
half with lawyers for Agnew and the Justice
Department.
At the same time, supporting Agnews efforts to
find the sources of news leaks, Hoffman gave the
vice president's lawyers broad authority to
subpoena Justice Department officials, newsmen
and anyone else they feel could help them get this
information.
The judge's unusual order, noting there appeared
"sufficient cause," said Agnew's counsel "may take
the depositions of such persons as they deem
appropriate and necessary upon at least 48 hours'
notice to the Department of Justice in each
instance."
Hoffman also directed clerks of district courts
anywhere in the United States to "issue such
subpoenas as may be required."
The depositions are to be sealed and not made
part of any public file, Hoffman said, in enjoining
Agnew and the government from disclosing the
names of those subpoenaed or discussing their
testimony.
Small Nixon Tax Payment
PROVIDENCE, R.I. — The Providence
Journal-Bulletin said yesterday that President Nixon
paid $1,670 in federal taxes for 1970 and 1971 and
received $131,503 in federal income tax refunds for
the two-year period.
The Journal-Bulletin said government sources
provided documents showing that President and
Mrs. Nixon paid $792.81 in federal taxes in 1970,
while receiving a $72,614.43 refund. It said the
documents show that in 1971 the Nixons paid
$878.03 in taxes and got a $48,889.41 refund.
The White House has refused to say whether
Nixon paid federal income taxes for 1970 and 1971.
The Baltimore Sun reported on Sept. 11 that
Nixon apparently paid no income tax for the two
years because of his deductions for interest, real
estate taxes and the donation of his vice presidential
papers to the National Archives. These deductions,
the Sun said, exceeded the President's salary of
$200,000 a year.

Nixon issued personal finance statements in
1968, 1969 and 1972. He said at a news conference
last month that his 1970 and 1971 tax returns were
audited by the Internal Revenue Service and no
change was ordered.
The Journal-Bulletin said today, "Taxes paid by
the Nixons in 1970-71 are roughly equivalent to
taxes paid by someone who earns about $7,000 a
year, claims one exemption and does not itemize
deductions, according to tax manuals."
Policeman Shot Before Crash
OAKLAND — Investigation into the Tuesday
night death of two policemen in a helicopter crash
revealed that the pilot was shot in the head
moments before the incident, police said
yesterday.
The pilot, Officer Wendell Troyer, 47, and
Officer David Guider, 26, were found dead after the
fiery crash which occurred during an aerial patrol. A
police spokesman said Troyer's cause of death was
determined by the county coroner.
Police declined to release further details of the
shooting, except to say an investigation was
underway.
The men gave no indication of mechanical
trouble when they radioed headquarters shortly
before the crash, Police Chief Charles Gain said. The
Federal Aviation Administration was called in to
investigate.
The crash occurred in a light commercial area of
East Oakland. No one on the ground was injured,
but the helicopter narrowly missed a restaurant on
its descent and a few autos were damaged by the
crash fire.
'Reagan Fiddles , Energy Burns'
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Ronald Reagan has
subjected California "to brownouts and blackouts
for years to come" with his veto of a power plant
siting bill, the measure's author said yesterday.
Sen. Alfred Alquist, D-San Jose, said the
Republican governor's veto prevents the state from
meeting its energy problem and it perpetuates
conditions in which "much of our energy is wasted
by inefficiency."
Reagan is "fiddling while the state's energy
burns," Alquist said.
The governor said in his veto message Tuesday
that the state needs new ways to hurry construction
of power plants. But he called the Alquist bill "an
unfinished product" which he said would not
"contribute to the solution of the problem."
Alquist's measure would have created a one-stop
system to speed up the site adoption procedure.
Presently there are about 33 different agencies and
steps a utility must go through to get a siting
approved.
At legislative hearings, experts said California
faces brownouts and blackouts in upcoming years
because of past delays in selection of power plant
sites and that unless the system is streamlined that
problem will grow more severe.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow with local patches of
clouds increasing and spreading. Slightly cooler
tomorrow. Today's highs in the low 60s to middle
70s, with inland highs in the 70s to 80s. Lows in the
middle 40s to 50s.

The White House has refused to say whether
Nixon paid federal income taxes for 1970 and 1971.
The Baltimore Sun reported on Sept. 11 that
Nixon apparently paid no income tax for the two
years because of his deductions for interest, real

the Sun said, exceeded the President's salary of
$200,000 a year.

Nixon issued personal finance statements in
1968, 1969 and 1972. He said at a news conference
last month that his 1970 and 1971 tax returns were

Policeman Shot Before Crash
OAKLAND — Investigation into the Tuesday
night death of two policemen in a helicopter crash
revealed that the pilot was shot in the head
moments before the incident, police said
yesterday.
The pilot, Officer Wendell Troyer, 47, and
Officer David Guider, 26, were found dead after the
fiery crash which occurred during an aerial patrol. A
police spokesman said Troyer's cause of death was
determined by the county coroner.
Police declined to release further details of the
shooting, except to say an investigation was
underway.
The men gave no indication of mechanical
trouble when they radioed headquarters shortly
before the crash, Police Chief Charles Gain said. The
Federal Aviation Administration was called in to
investigate.
The crash occurred in a light commercial area of
East Oakland. No one on the ground was injured,
but the helicopter narrowly missed a restaurant on
its descent and a few autos were damaged by the
crash fire.
'Reagan Fiddles , Energy Burns'
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Ronald Reagan has
subjected California "to brownouts and blackouts
for years to come" with his veto of a power plant
siting bill, the measure's author said yesterday.
Sen. Alfred Alquist, D-San Jose, said the
Republican governor's veto prevents the state from
meeting its energy problem and it perpetuates
conditions in which "much of our energy is wasted
by inefficiency."
Reagan is "fiddling while the state's energy
burns," Alquist said.
The governor said in his veto message Tuesday
that the state needs new ways to hurry construction
of power plants. But he called the Alquist bill "an
unfinished product" which he said would not
"contribute to the solution of the problem."
Alquist's measure would have created a one-stop
system to speed up the site adoption procedure.
Presently there are about 33 different agencies and
steps a utility must go through to get a siting
approved.
At legislative hearings, experts said California
faces brownouts and blackouts in upcoming years
because of past delays in selection of power plant
sites and that unless the system is streamlined that
problem will grow more severe.

'Presume Agnew Innocent'- Nixon
WASHINGTON — President Nixon yesterday
acknowledged in a news conference that bribery and
kickback allegations against Vice President Spiro T.
Agnew are "serious and not frivolous" but declared
that the vice president should be presumed
innocent.
Noting the "rather white-hot atmosphere"
swirling around Agnew, Nixon said he hopes Agnew
"will not be tried and convicted in the press and on
television by leaks and innuendoes."
He said he had never asked the vice president to
resign.
Questions about Agnew dominatedthe news
conference. The President, asked whether he
thought a vice president should resign if indicted,
said Agnew's response — that he won't resign — "is
an altogether proper one."
The vice president, Nixon added, "is elected by
all the people. He holds that office in his own right
and the decision as to whether he should resign is
for him to make."
"I have never asked him to resign," the President
said in response to another question.
Nixon said that Agnew "has denied to me
privately on three occasions" that he is guilty of the
allegations leveled against him. And he said he is
"certainly not" doing any contingency planning in
the event Agnew leaves office.
Nixon noted that the allegations "do not relate
in any way to his activities as vice president . ..."
He continued, "There is nothing really that is
more harmful to the rights of an individual than to
be tried and convicted in the press before he has an
opportunity to present his case and I would urge all
of you [the press] ... to make your statements on
the basis of all the evidence . . . and not simply on
the basis of a unilateral charge that is not made
under oath .. ."
Gas Dealers Face Antitrust Suit
SAN FRANCISCO - The U.S. Justice
Department said yesterday it is weighing the
possibility of antitrust action in the face of the
threats of organized shutdowns of independent
service stations.
Mark Anderson, attorney with the department's
antitrust division here said the division is looking
into possible violations of the Sherman Antitrust
Act.
"An agreement to close gas stations may come
under that section," he said. "But the matter is
under investigation only and no action has been
taken."
The statement came while independent service
station operators in California and Nevada were
making final arrangements for what they hope will
be a massive shutdown in protest of Phase 4 ceiling
on retail gasoline prices.
Participating dealers are scheduled to snap the
locks on their pumps at 12:01 a.m. Friday.
They contend they are caught in a profit squeeze
because of inability to pass on to their customers
increases in wholesale prices.
The shutdown may last anywhere from three
days to a week, promoters of the protest said
Wednesday.
But in some areas of California, operators said
they would stay open because they felt that closing
would be ineffective.
Organizations of dealers in Southern California
held a mass meeting in Los Angeles Wednesday

night to coordinate strategy and enlist support of
dealers who hadn't decided to close. Spokesmen
said about 3000 of the 12,000 operators in
Southern California had agreed to close.
Hie California Service Station Dealers
Association was polling dealers in Northern
California to find out whether they would support a
shutdown. Results weren't expected to be known
until Thursday or Friday. Northern California
dealers staged a shutdown from Sept. 21 through
Sept. 24.
San Jose area dealers said they wouldn't close
but would fight in the courts for higher prices.
"We shall continue our service with the hope that
the public will help us in our cause for justice," said
a spokesman for the San Jose chapter of the
National Service Station Dealers Association.
Agnew Jury Warned
BALTIMORE — The Baltimore federal grand
jury investigating Vice President Spiro T. Agnew
was warned by a judge yesterday to disregard news
stories involving the inquiry because they
"frequently are wholly or partially inaccurate."
U.S. District Court Judge Walter E. Hoffman,
specially assigned to handle the Agnew probe,
summoned the jury to an extraordinary public
hearing after meeting privately for an hour and a
half with lawyers for Agnew and the Justice
Department.
At the same time, supporting Agnews efforts to
find the sources of news leaks, Hoffman gave the
vice president's lawyers broad authority to
subpoena Justice Department officials, newsmen
and anyone else they feel could help them get this
information.
The judge's unusual order, noting there appeared
"sufficient cause," said Agnew's counsel "may take
the depositions of such persons as they deem
appropriate and necessary upon at least 48 hours'
notice to the Department of Justice in each
instance."
Hoffman also directed clerks of district courts
anywhere in the United States to "issue such
subpoenas as may be required."
The depositions are to be sealed and not made
part of any public file, Hoffman said, in enjoining
Agnew and the government from disclosing the
names of those subpoenaed or discussing their
testimony.
Small Nixon Tax Payment
PROVIDENCE, R.I. — The Providence
Journal-Bulletin said yesterday that President Nixon
paid $1,670 in federal taxes for 1970 and 1971 and
received $131,503 in federal income tax refunds for
the two-year period.
The Journal-Bulletin said government sources
provided documents showing that President and

Mark Anderson, attorney with the department's
antitrust division here said the division is looking
into possible violations of the Sherman Antitrust
Act.
"An agreement to close gas stations may come

under investigation only and no action has been
taken."
The statement came while independent service
station operators in California and Nevada were
making final arrangements for what they hope will
be a massive shutdown in protest of Phase 4 ceiling
on retail gasoline prices.
Participating dealers are scheduled to snap the
locks on their pumps at 12:01 a.m. Friday.
They contend they are caught in a profit squeeze
because of inability to pass on to their customers
increases in wholesale prices.
The shutdown may last anywhere from three
days to a week, promoters of the protest said
Wednesday.
But in some areas of California, operators said
they would stay open because they felt that closing
would be ineffective.
Organizations of dealers in Southern California
held a mass meeting in Los Angeles Wednesday

night to coordinate strategy and enlist support of
dealers who hadn't decided to close. Spokesmen
said about 3000 of the 12,000 operators in
Southern California had agreed to close.
Hie California Service Station Dealers
Association was polling dealers in Northern
California to find out whether they would support a
shutdown. Results weren't expected to be known
until Thursday or Friday. Northern California
dealers staged a shutdown from Sept. 21 through
Sept. 24.
San Jose area dealers said they wouldn't close
but would fight in the courts for higher prices.
"We shall continue our service with the hope that
the public will help us in our cause for justice," said
a spokesman for the San Jose chapter of the
National Service Station Dealers Association.
Agnew Jury Warned
BALTIMORE — The Baltimore federal grand
jury investigating Vice President Spiro T. Agnew
was warned by a judge yesterday to disregard news
stories involving the inquiry because they
"frequently are wholly or partially inaccurate."
U.S. District Court Judge Walter E. Hoffman,
specially assigned to handle the Agnew probe,
summoned the jury to an extraordinary public
hearing after meeting privately for an hour and a
half with lawyers for Agnew and the Justice
Department.
At the same time, supporting Agnews efforts to
find the sources of news leaks, Hoffman gave the
vice president's lawyers broad authority to
subpoena Justice Department officials, newsmen
and anyone else they feel could help them get this
information.
The judge's unusual order, noting there appeared
"sufficient cause," said Agnew's counsel "may take
the depositions of such persons as they deem
appropriate and necessary upon at least 48 hours'
notice to the Department of Justice in each
instance."
Hoffman also directed clerks of district courts
anywhere in the United States to "issue such
subpoenas as may be required."
The depositions are to be sealed and not made
part of any public file, Hoffman said, in enjoining
Agnew and the government from disclosing the
names of those subpoenaed or discussing their
testimony.
Small Nixon Tax Payment
PROVIDENCE, R.I. — The Providence
Journal-Bulletin said yesterday that President Nixon
paid $1,670 in federal taxes for 1970 and 1971 and
received $131,503 in federal income tax refunds for
the two-year period.
The Journal-Bulletin said government sources
provided documents showing that President and
Mrs. Nixon paid $792.81 in federal taxes in 1970,
while receiving a $72,614.43 refund. It said the
documents show that in 1971 the Nixons paid
$878.03 in taxes and got a $48,889.41 refund.
The White House has refused to say whether
Nixon paid federal income taxes for 1970 and 1971.
The Baltimore Sun reported on Sept. 11 that
Nixon apparently paid no income tax for the two
years because of his deductions for interest, real
estate taxes and the donation of his vice presidential
papers to the National Archives. These deductions,
the Sun said, exceeded the President's salary of
$200,000 a year.

Nixon issued personal finance statements in
1968, 1969 and 1972. He said at a news conference
last month that his 1970 and 1971 tax returns were
audited by the Internal Revenue Service and no
change was ordered.
The Journal-Bulletin said today, "Taxes paid by
the Nixons in 1970-71 are roughly equivalent to
taxes paid by someone who earns about $7,000 a
year, claims one exemption and does not itemize
deductions, according to tax manuals."
Policeman Shot Before Crash
OAKLAND — Investigation into the Tuesday
night death of two policemen in a helicopter crash
revealed that the pilot was shot in the head
moments before the incident, police said
yesterday.
The pilot, Officer Wendell Troyer, 47, and
Officer David Guider, 26, were found dead after the
fiery crash which occurred during an aerial patrol. A
police spokesman said Troyer's cause of death was
determined by the county coroner.
Police declined to release further details of the
shooting, except to say an investigation was
underway.
The men gave no indication of mechanical
trouble when they radioed headquarters shortly
before the crash, Police Chief Charles Gain said. The
Federal Aviation Administration was called in to
investigate.
The crash occurred in a light commercial area of
East Oakland. No one on the ground was injured,
but the helicopter narrowly missed a restaurant on
its descent and a few autos were damaged by the
crash fire.
'Reagan Fiddles , Energy Burns'
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Ronald Reagan has
subjected California "to brownouts and blackouts
for years to come" with his veto of a power plant
siting bill, the measure's author said yesterday.
Sen. Alfred Alquist, D-San Jose, said the
Republican governor's veto prevents the state from
meeting its energy problem and it perpetuates
conditions in which "much of our energy is wasted
by inefficiency."
Reagan is "fiddling while the state's energy
burns," Alquist said.
The governor said in his veto message Tuesday
that the state needs new ways to hurry construction
of power plants. But he called the Alquist bill "an
unfinished product" which he said would not
"contribute to the solution of the problem."
Alquist's measure would have created a one-stop
system to speed up the site adoption procedure.
Presently there are about 33 different agencies and
steps a utility must go through to get a siting
approved.
At legislative hearings, experts said California
faces brownouts and blackouts in upcoming years
because of past delays in selection of power plant
sites and that unless the system is streamlined that
problem will grow more severe.

'Presume Agnew Innocent'- Nixon
WASHINGTON — President Nixon yesterday
acknowledged in a news conference that bribery and
kickback allegations against Vice President Spiro T.
Agnew are "serious and not frivolous" but declared
that the vice president should be presumed
innocent.
Noting the "rather white-hot atmosphere"
swirling around Agnew, Nixon said he hopes Agnew
"will not be tried and convicted in the press and on
television by leaks and innuendoes."
He said he had never asked the vice president to
resign.
Questions about Agnew dominatedthe news
conference. The President, asked whether he
thought a vice president should resign if indicted,
said Agnew's response — that he won't resign — "is
an altogether proper one."
The vice president, Nixon added, "is elected by
all the people. He holds that office in his own right
and the decision as to whether he should resign is
for him to make."
"I have never asked him to resign," the President
said in response to another question.
Nixon said that Agnew "has denied to me
privately on three occasions" that he is guilty of the
allegations leveled against him. And he said he is
"certainly not" doing any contingency planning in
the event Agnew leaves office.
Nixon noted that the allegations "do not relate
in any way to his activities as vice president . ..."
He continued, "There is nothing really that is
more harmful to the rights of an individual than to
be tried and convicted in the press before he has an
opportunity to present his case and I would urge all
of you [the press] ... to make your statements on
the basis of all the evidence . . . and not simply on
the basis of a unilateral charge that is not made
under oath .. ."

'Reagan Fiddles , Energy Burns'
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Ronald Reagan has
subjected California "to brownouts and blackouts
for years to come" with his veto of a power plant
siting bill, the measure's author said yesterday.
Sen. Alfred Alquist, D-San Jose, said the
Republican governor's veto prevents the state from
meeting its energy problem and it perpetuates
conditions in which "much of our energy is wasted
by inefficiency."
Reagan is "fiddling while the state's energy
burns," Alquist said.
The governor said in his veto message Tuesday
that the state needs new ways to hurry construction
of power plants. But he called the Alquist bill "an
unfinished product" which he said would not
"contribute to the solution of the problem."
Alquist's measure would have created a one-stop
system to speed up the site adoption procedure.
Presently there are about 33 different agencies and
steps a utility must go through to get a siting
approved.
At legislative hearings, experts said California
faces brownouts and blackouts in upcoming years
because of past delays in selection of power plant
sites and that unless the system is streamlined that
problem will grow more severe.

'Presume Agnew Innocent'- Nixon
WASHINGTON — President Nixon yesterday
acknowledged in a news conference that bribery and
kickback allegations against Vice President Spiro T.
Agnew are "serious and not frivolous" but declared
that the vice president should be presumed
innocent.
Noting the "rather white-hot atmosphere"
swirling around Agnew, Nixon said he hopes Agnew
"will not be tried and convicted in the press and on
television by leaks and innuendoes."
He said he had never asked the vice president to
resign.
Questions about Agnew dominatedthe news
conference. The President, asked whether he
thought a vice president should resign if indicted,
said Agnew's response — that he won't resign — "is
an altogether proper one."
The vice president, Nixon added, "is elected by
all the people. He holds that office in his own right
and the decision as to whether he should resign is
for him to make."
"I have never asked him to resign," the President
said in response to another question.
Nixon said that Agnew "has denied to me
privately on three occasions" that he is guilty of the
allegations leveled against him. And he said he is
"certainly not" doing any contingency planning in
the event Agnew leaves office.
Nixon noted that the allegations "do not relate
in any way to his activities as vice president . ..."
He continued, "There is nothing really that is
more harmful to the rights of an individual than to
be tried and convicted in the press before he has an
opportunity to present his case and I would urge all
of you [the press] ... to make your statements on
the basis of all the evidence . . . and not simply on
the basis of a unilateral charge that is not made
under oath .. ."
Gas Dealers Face Antitrust Suit
SAN FRANCISCO - The U.S. Justice
Department said yesterday it is weighing the
possibility of antitrust action in the face of the
threats of organized shutdowns of independent
service stations.
Mark Anderson, attorney with the department's
antitrust division here said the division is looking
into possible violations of the Sherman Antitrust
Act.
"An agreement to close gas stations may come
under that section," he said. "But the matter is
under investigation only and no action has been
taken."
The statement came while independent service
station operators in California and Nevada were
making final arrangements for what they hope will
be a massive shutdown in protest of Phase 4 ceiling
on retail gasoline prices.
Participating dealers are scheduled to snap the
locks on their pumps at 12:01 a.m. Friday.
They contend they are caught in a profit squeeze
because of inability to pass on to their customers
increases in wholesale prices.
The shutdown may last anywhere from three
days to a week, promoters of the protest said
Wednesday.
But in some areas of California, operators said
they would stay open because they felt that closing
would be ineffective.
Organizations of dealers in Southern California
held a mass meeting in Los Angeles Wednesday

night to coordinate strategy and enlist support of
dealers who hadn't decided to close. Spokesmen
said about 3000 of the 12,000 operators in
Southern California had agreed to close.
Hie California Service Station Dealers
Association was polling dealers in Northern
California to find out whether they would support a
shutdown. Results weren't expected to be known
until Thursday or Friday. Northern California
dealers staged a shutdown from Sept. 21 through
Sept. 24.
San Jose area dealers said they wouldn't close
but would fight in the courts for higher prices.
"We shall continue our service with the hope that
the public will help us in our cause for justice," said
a spokesman for the San Jose chapter of the
National Service Station Dealers Association.
Agnew Jury Warned
BALTIMORE — The Baltimore federal grand
jury investigating Vice President Spiro T. Agnew
was warned by a judge yesterday to disregard news
stories involving the inquiry because they
"frequently are wholly or partially inaccurate."
U.S. District Court Judge Walter E. Hoffman,
specially assigned to handle the Agnew probe,
summoned the jury to an extraordinary public
hearing after meeting privately for an hour and a
half with lawyers for Agnew and the Justice
Department.
At the same time, supporting Agnews efforts to
find the sources of news leaks, Hoffman gave the
vice president's lawyers broad authority to
subpoena Justice Department officials, newsmen
and anyone else they feel could help them get this
information.
The judge's unusual order, noting there appeared
"sufficient cause," said Agnew's counsel "may take
the depositions of such persons as they deem
appropriate and necessary upon at least 48 hours'
notice to the Department of Justice in each
instance."
Hoffman also directed clerks of district courts
anywhere in the United States to "issue such
subpoenas as may be required."
The depositions are to be sealed and not made
part of any public file, Hoffman said, in enjoining
Agnew and the government from disclosing the
names of those subpoenaed or discussing their
testimony.
Small Nixon Tax Payment
PROVIDENCE, R.I. — The Providence
Journal-Bulletin said yesterday that President Nixon
paid $1,670 in federal taxes for 1970 and 1971 and
received $131,503 in federal income tax refunds for
the two-year period.
The Journal-Bulletin said government sources
provided documents showing that President and
Mrs. Nixon paid $792.81 in federal taxes in 1970,
while receiving a $72,614.43 refund. It said the
documents show that in 1971 the Nixons paid
$878.03 in taxes and got a $48,889.41 refund.
The White House has refused to say whether
Nixon paid federal income taxes for 1970 and 1971.
The Baltimore Sun reported on Sept. 11 that
Nixon apparently paid no income tax for the two
years because of his deductions for interest, real
estate taxes and the donation of his vice presidential
papers to the National Archives. These deductions,
the Sun said, exceeded the President's salary of
$200,000 a year.

Nixon issued personal finance statements in
1968, 1969 and 1972. He said at a news conference
last month that his 1970 and 1971 tax returns were
audited by the Internal Revenue Service and no
change was ordered.
The Journal-Bulletin said today, "Taxes paid by
the Nixons in 1970-71 are roughly equivalent to
taxes paid by someone who earns about $7,000 a
year, claims one exemption and does not itemize
deductions, according to tax manuals."
Policeman Shot Before Crash
OAKLAND — Investigation into the Tuesday
night death of two policemen in a helicopter crash
revealed that the pilot was shot in the head
moments before the incident, police said
yesterday.
The pilot, Officer Wendell Troyer, 47, and
Officer David Guider, 26, were found dead after the
fiery crash which occurred during an aerial patrol. A
police spokesman said Troyer's cause of death was
determined by the county coroner.
Police declined to release further details of the
shooting, except to say an investigation was
underway.
The men gave no indication of mechanical
trouble when they radioed headquarters shortly
before the crash, Police Chief Charles Gain said. The
Federal Aviation Administration was called in to
investigate.
The crash occurred in a light commercial area of
East Oakland. No one on the ground was injured,
but the helicopter narrowly missed a restaurant on
its descent and a few autos were damaged by the
crash fire.
