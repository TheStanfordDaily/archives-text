# Demo Longshot Joins Crowded Governor's Race
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
SAN FRANCISCO - Herb Hafif
kicked off the Northern California
portion of his decidedly underdog
campaign for governor of California
before a capacity crowd of 500 at
Bimbo's last night.
The 43 year-old Democratic
contender from Claremont, Cal. said
that "the people are ready for a guy
whoTl say the same thing in every
place."
The dinner came just one day after
San Francisco's own mayor, Joseph
Alioto, formally announced his own
candidacy.
Hafif, a past president of the
California Trial Lawyers Association,
struck a populist note, telling his
audience that "people will begin to
take part in their own government" if
he is elected.
Hafif pledged that he would
withdraw from the race if he could not
attract at least 7000 people to a
scheduled Long Beach rally by the end
of the month.
Although Hafif stayed away from
specific issues last night, he did call for
what he termed "creative solutions" to
the state's problems.
He suggested construction of
day-care facilities in retirement
communities to be manned by the
elderly, which, he said, would help
alleviate both the shortage of day-care
facilities and problems of the elderly.
Hafifs entry into the race has

further crowded an already-packed
Democratic field. Besides Hafif and
Alioto, five contenders have either
already announced their candidacies or
are approaching a declaration.
Latest polls — still extremely
premature — place Secretary of State
Edmund G. Brown Jr., son of the
former governor, at the head of the
pack. Other candidates include state
Sen. George Moscone of San
Francisco, Rep. Jerome Waldie of
Contra Costa County, Assembly
Speaker Bob Moretti and University of
California regent and millionaire
financier William Matson Roth.
Moscone, the Senate majority
leader will speak tonight at 7 p.m. at a
dinner at St. Mark's Episcopal Church,
600 Colorado Ave. in Palo Alto.
