# Experiment Sparks TV Drama

The ABC television network may soon produce a
dramatic interpretation of an experiment on prison
behavior carried out two years ago by Psych. Prof. Philip
G. Zimbardo and graduate student Craig Haney.
According to Zimbardo, "ABC has approved of a
treatment, and a script-writer is working on it. But at this
point, they still have to pass on the script."
A Stanford alumnus, Joel Rogoson, had seen a report
of the experiment in the Daily and was instrumental in
interesting ABC in the idea. However, Zimbardo
explained, "I haven't dealt with ABC at all, and I don't
know what the treatment will be."
In the 1971 experiment, a group of psychologically
healthy volunteers were placed in various prison roles.
Some "convicts" suffered emotional break-downs and
beatings by the "jailers." These caused an early halt to the
experiment, which was followed by a quick return of the
participants to their normal behavior.

"I think it would be a great idea if they kept the
message intact, which is that prisons are inherently evil
institutions, and illicit, and create pathological behavior in
otherwise healthy and normal people," Zimbardo said.
Zimbardo recently returned from Washington, where
he testified before a Senate committee investigating
juvenile delinquency,on the effects of detention preceding
trial. A slide lecture, developed with co-investigator
Haney, has also been shown to groups of police officers,
sheriff deputies and correctional officers.
"We think we'll be able to reduce the pathology in the
prisons by enabling guards to perceive the extent by
which their behavior and the behavior of the inmates
affects the nature of the prison," Zimbardo said.
Zimbardo, Haney and Chris Samuelson, a graduate
student in communication, are also developing a teaching
film from videotape, film and slides of the prison
experiment as part of an educational program for state
correctional officers.
