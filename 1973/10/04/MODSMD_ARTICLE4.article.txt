# Two SCIRE Vacancies Filled; Reevaluation Of Program Sought
## 
### CHESS ERWIN 
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James Gibbs has appointed Law Prof.
Jack Friendenthal and acting Assistant
Prof. of Anthropology Bridget
O'Laughlin to fill two positions on the
SCIRE Policy Board that have been
vacant since last spring, according to
Assistant Dean of Undergraduate
Studies B. Michael Closson.
The Policy Board consists of five
faculty members and six students.
Three student vacancies on the Board
will be filled by the ASSU in the next
several weeks, according to the Dean
of Undergraduate Studies office.
Closson said that he is "really
optimistic" about SCIRE following
the first meeting of its Policy Board
last Tuesday. The primary purpose of
the meeting, he said was "to start
again" and to renew the relationship
between the Policy Board and the
Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies.
Dana Weigent, the Office Assistant
for SCIRE, will handle the program's
administrative duties until a new
director is appointed, Closson added.
SCIRE's previous director, Ron Jones,
had his dismissal upheld recently by
University grievance procedures.
Acting Director
Closson stated his office had
proposed that an acting director for
SCIRE be appointed during the
summer. The Policy Board opposed
this action because Closson said the

Board felt there was not enough time
for such action.
"Few universities have programs
such as SCIRE and in my view it must
be continued. Now — in the beginning
of the year — is the appropriate time
to discuss SCIRE. Besides accrediting
student projects, other possibilities
need to be studied and discussed as
well," explained Closson.
Before exploring alternative
proposals for SCIRE, Closson
emphasized the need for reopening
lines of communication between the
Dean's Office and the Policy Board.
"Communication or the lack of it is
the key to an effective relationship
between ourselves and the Board," he
said.
Community Role
Among the things to be discussed in
the near future include the role of
SCIRE on the University community
and various proposals on how the
program should be staffed. With these
things in mind, the search for a new
director can get underway, stated
Closson.
"We hope to have a new director by
the middle of the winter quarter,"
explained Closson.
Besides an overall re-examination of
what SCIRE ought to do, Closson
added that he hoped a further study of
other student needs would be initiated
as well. He suggested pre-medical
education as one possible study topic.
"By acting as a kind of information

exchange for all parts of the University
community, SCIRE can perform a
valuable new service. SCIRE has the
flexibility to rejuvenate itself if it can
respond to the changing needs of the
students," Closson concluded.
'So Far Away'
However, SCIRE Policy Board
member Toby Hayes, assistant
professor of applied mechanics, stated
that SCIRE is "far away from its
original intentions." He added that
what happens for SCIRE will depend
on upcoming Policy Board meetings.
"I wonder what will happen in the
future for SCIRE because of the
history of mistrust and double dealings
between the Policy Board and the
Dean's Office," Hayes mused. "But,"
he added, "Mike Closson has done a
great job recently on behalf of Dean

Gibbs' office in his relations with the
Policy Board."
Much Bitterness
Jones let students do whatever they
wanted, Hayes asserted. "By failing to
take a stand on that, the Policy Board
spent most of the year defending
Jones against Dean Gibbs. With so
much power in the Dean's office, the
Policy Board won't be willing to go
against him [Gibbs]. There is a lot of
bitterness because of that," he said.
"The hassles in getting a project
approved by the Policy Board are
unbelievable. We have to ask ourselves
if the Policy Board is really needed
because in my opinion, it has become
monstrously bureaucratic," Hayes
continued.

Three student vacancies on the Board
will be filled by the ASSU in the next
several weeks, according to the Dean
of Undergraduate Studies office.
Closson said that he is "really
optimistic" about SCIRE following
the first meeting of its Policy Board
last Tuesday. The primary purpose of
the meeting, he said was "to start
again" and to renew the relationship
between the Policy Board and the
Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies.
Dana Weigent, the Office Assistant
for SCIRE, will handle the program's
administrative duties until a new
director is appointed, Closson added.
SCIRE's previous director, Ron Jones,
had his dismissal upheld recently by
University grievance procedures.
Acting Director
Closson stated his office had
proposed that an acting director for
SCIRE be appointed during the
summer. The Policy Board opposed
this action because Closson said the

Board felt there was not enough time
for such action.
"Few universities have programs
such as SCIRE and in my view it must
be continued. Now — in the beginning
of the year — is the appropriate time
to discuss SCIRE. Besides accrediting
student projects, other possibilities
need to be studied and discussed as
well," explained Closson.
Before exploring alternative
proposals for SCIRE, Closson
emphasized the need for reopening
lines of communication between the
Dean's Office and the Policy Board.
"Communication or the lack of it is
the key to an effective relationship
between ourselves and the Board," he
said.
Community Role
Among the things to be discussed in
the near future include the role of
SCIRE on the University community
and various proposals on how the
program should be staffed. With these
things in mind, the search for a new
director can get underway, stated
Closson.
"We hope to have a new director by
the middle of the winter quarter,"
explained Closson.
Besides an overall re-examination of
what SCIRE ought to do, Closson
added that he hoped a further study of
other student needs would be initiated
as well. He suggested pre-medical
education as one possible study topic.
"By acting as a kind of information

exchange for all parts of the University
community, SCIRE can perform a
valuable new service. SCIRE has the
flexibility to rejuvenate itself if it can
respond to the changing needs of the
students," Closson concluded.
'So Far Away'
However, SCIRE Policy Board
member Toby Hayes, assistant
professor of applied mechanics, stated
that SCIRE is "far away from its
original intentions." He added that
what happens for SCIRE will depend
on upcoming Policy Board meetings.
"I wonder what will happen in the
future for SCIRE because of the
history of mistrust and double dealings
between the Policy Board and the
Dean's Office," Hayes mused. "But,"
he added, "Mike Closson has done a
great job recently on behalf of Dean

Gibbs' office in his relations with the
Policy Board."
Much Bitterness
Jones let students do whatever they
wanted, Hayes asserted. "By failing to
take a stand on that, the Policy Board
spent most of the year defending
Jones against Dean Gibbs. With so
much power in the Dean's office, the
Policy Board won't be willing to go
against him [Gibbs]. There is a lot of
bitterness because of that," he said.
"The hassles in getting a project
approved by the Policy Board are
unbelievable. We have to ask ourselves
if the Policy Board is really needed
because in my opinion, it has become
monstrously bureaucratic," Hayes
continued.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James Gibbs has appointed Law Prof.
Jack Friendenthal and acting Assistant
Prof. of Anthropology Bridget
O'Laughlin to fill two positions on the
SCIRE Policy Board that have been
vacant since last spring, according to
Assistant Dean of Undergraduate
Studies B. Michael Closson.
The Policy Board consists of five
faculty members and six students.
Three student vacancies on the Board
