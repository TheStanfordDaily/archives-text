# Segretti Tells Of Role In Campaign 'Tricks'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Donald H.
Segretti yesterday catalogued his
inventory of tricks against 1972
Democratic presidential candidates,
apologized and said they have no place
in election campaigns.
"I don't call any of the things I did
at that time pranks," Segretti told the
Senate Watergate committee. "I don't
think there should be pranks or dirty
tricks or whatever you call it in the
political system."
Segretti, a 32-year-old lawyer from
Los Angeles, said he was recruited for
his activities by Dwight L. Chapin,
then President Nixon's appointments
secretary. Segretti said also he kept in
frequent contact with Chapin.
He said he had agents in several
states and personally employed diverse
tactics such as sending letters
containing faked charges, planting a
stink bomb in campaign headquarters,
inserting classified advertisements
under ficticious names, and
distributing signs, bumper stickers and
pamphlets under the names of
non-existent committees.
Large Operation
At one point he said he paid 11
persons, but later agreed the figure was
28. He said his people operated in
Florida, New Hampshire, California,

Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and
Washington, D.C.
"Were you aware it is unlawful to
send salacious and libelous letters?"
asked Sen. Daniel K. Inouye,
D-Hawaii.
"I'm certainly aware of it now,"
said Segretti, who earlier this week
pleaded guilty to three misdemeanor
counts stemming from a false mailing.
Segretti said he told
then-presidential counsel John W.
Dean 111 about his activities last
October when the Washington Post
was preparing to publish a number of
details. After the story was published,
the White House dismissed comment
on the allegations.
Juror's Question
Segretti said the original federal
Watergate prosecutors asked him no
questions about how he was paid when
he appeared before the grand jury,
although they had discussed it briefly
beforehand. A juror brought up the
question, Segretti said.
He corroborated testimony that he
was paid $45,000 in salary and
expenses by Herbert W. Kalmbach,
Nixon's personal lawyer, after being
hired by Chapin and Gordon Strachan,
another White House aide. He had
