## Catastrophes Of Bosco At The Flicks 
###

Sunday night on the Farm and
Bosco Embo, B.A. '74, ventures
from the sanctuary of his frat
house (Rho Rho Rho) to attend
the Flicks. "All others are
studying this first weekend," he
thinks, "or have gone to the early
show; I'll have the balcony to
myself."
»' Parking his sexy European
Capri (with the sunroof, and
Stanford sticker on the rear
window) on Galvez, he is
prevented from turning the corner
by a long line. Surveying the scene
£tom behind his aviator-style gold
wire rims, he notes at least five
other lines leading toward Mem
&ud.
Not wanting to appear
unknowledgeable (he is a senior
and must maintain self-respect),
he moves toward the shortest line
and waits. Fifteen minutes drag
by until Bosco reaches the ticket
seller's booth, where he lays down
50 cents.
J "I'm sorry sir; this is the season
pass purchase line only. You can
get into the regular ticket line —
the one there behind Hoover
Tower — or pay another $5 for a
season pass."
Another Line
! Bosco clutches the precious
pass in his sweaty hand and moves
to yet another linemarked 'final
step.' (He can feel the collar of his
Eagle tape red-fit shirt begin to
'soil, and curses softly.)
"Isn't it ridiculous, this set
up?" says the girl in line next to
Bosco, mistaking the intent of his
hushed profanity.
In the fraction of a second
before he replies, he takes in the
girl's smile, good looks, long hair,
peasant blouse, jeans, and clogs,
and notes the absence of any rings
on her fingers, any pendants
around her neck, and any
interested males in the immediate
vicinity.
What Luck!
Suddenly, the long wait ahead
seems fortunate: here, on the very
first week of his last year, in the
midst of Stanford's 3:5
womian/man ratio, he has

stumbled upon a one-to-one
situation that could just answer all
his daydreams — even the ones his
roommate unexpectedly
interrupted.
"It really is amazing," he
begins but is drowned out:
"Embo baby . .. hey Embo!
Thanks for saving us places. God
what a line! Buzz — you go get
some tickets and we'll stay here
and hold these places. How come
you left the house so early Bosco?
I bet you're tired of standing in
line; why don't you show Buzz
where to get our tickets. Hey
Buzz . . . Buzz, wait up! Embo'll
show you where the ticket line is.
Good boy. And hello sweetheart!
You a freshman? Well how about
coming up to the house for some
beer afterward and. . .."
Why Me?
The voices dim as Bosco buries
himself in another line. Why
couldn't all the jocks on the third
floor have gone to the early show?
Wasn't there IM practice tonight,
or a party at the Goose? No such
luck.
Before we can sink any deeper
into despair, he can't help but

notice the smells around him in
this densely packed new line.
Tabu is to his left, Brut to the
right, and Eau de Stern directly
ahead.
Snatches of conversation
assault his ears, as the crowd-odor
numbs his olifactory:
"Is this History 23?" (A
freshman? thought Bosco.)
"Isn't this the University of
Michigan, or have I made a
terrible mistake?" (Must be a
Bandsman.)
"What is reality?"
"I bet if someone went across
the street and shouted 'Free Sex,'
the line would sure thin out!"
"How much will you pay me if
I do it?" (With a comment like
that, it had to be Stanford, not
Michigan.)
There is a slight commotion up
ahead as a boy pretends to faint in
order to get inside. "Please take
me in and lay me ... down," he
gasps.
This Is Absurd
"Sorry," replies a Flicks
Monitor, "You'll have to go to the
first aid line around the corner."
Finally the crowd moves, until

Bosco finds himself at the door,
handing the crumpled pass to an
usher. "Your ID, kid?" the usher
sneers, brushing aside the offered
pass.
"I'm a senior!" Bosco cries.
"Twenty-one years old. I don't
get carded at bars, at casinos, even
at Moonlight Ranch."
"Hey, hurry up — I want to see
the movie," came a voice from
behind.
Bosco cannot find his wallet.
Could he have lost it in the crowd
below the stairs? All his ID, plus
his Mastercharge card is in it. "I'll
be back in a minute" he calls to
the usher as he rushes against the
mob.
Over by the bicycle racks and
street lamp he crowds into the
line and bends down to look for
the missing billfold. A feminine
"Excuse me" interrupts his
search.
Looking up, he can see —
behind the glare of the streetlight
— the outline of a beautiful blond
head. "Excuse me," this goddess
continues, with a hint of
playfulness in her voice, "but
you're standing in MY place in
line."
