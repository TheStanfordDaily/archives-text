## Register To Vote 
### 
Normally, we don't run an editorial on an off-year election
better than a month before the actual event. But this year is
something special, for an otherwise undistinguished ballot will be
graced by the presence of Proposition 1, Governor Ronald Regan's
hotly-debated tax initiative.
• The merits and faults of Proposition 1 will, of course, be
discussed in these pages in due time.
The deadline for registering to vote in the Nov. 6 election,
however, is Sunday, Oct. 7. So if you've moved, or if you're newly
18, or if you've never registered before, now is the time.
Otherwise, you may find yourself paying — or not paying —
taxes you had no hand in determining.
