The world's lightest production motocrossers
A first for Honda, a first for you when you ride them — the new
Honda two-strokes — the Elsinore TM CR-250M and CR-125M.
Both are the lightest in their respective classes. The 250-214
pounds dry. And the 125—180 pounds. Incredibly powerful — big |
horsepower, super torque. No frills on either, just the latest in
lightweight streamlined design. Their frames are made of j
chrome molybdenum in a semi-double cradle construction.
They're extra strong, light and rigid. The engines also combine
strength with light weight. By a special metallurgical process,
tough cast-iron cylinder liners are bonded to the light aluminum
blocks. The close-ration transmissions are perfect for motocross.
Instant power in every gear. And there's instant, exact response j
to your handling, too. In fact, in every way the new Elsinore j
series two-strokes challenge the competition. In weight — they're I
lighter. In power — they're awesome. In styling — they're j
cleaner. In endurance — they're Honda dependable.
