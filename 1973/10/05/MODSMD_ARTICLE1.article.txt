# Food Prices Drop Six Percent; Nixon Aide Sees Slower Inflation
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Farm, feed
and processed food prices plunged a
record six percent in September to
pace the biggest one-month decline in
wholesale prices in 25 years, the
government said yesterday.
Chairman Herbert Stein of the
President's Council of Economic
Advisers called the drop in wholesale
prices "a welcome sign that the worst
of the big 1973 surge of inflation is

behind us."
But AFL-CIO President George
Meany, noting that wholesale prices
were still 16.6 percent above a year
ago, said there is no evidence this is
the start of a trend.
"It is interesting to note," Meany
said, "that the September decline does
not even begin to compensate for the
whopping 6.2 percent increase in
August."

He predicted this "will prove to be
only a momentary pause and prices
will bounce up again" once the Cost of
Living Council approves price increase
requests.
Market Price Impact
The September drop in wholesale
food prices is expected to begin
showing up on supermarket shelves in
the coming weeks.
However, Stein cautioned, that
consumers should not expect all of the
decrease to be translated into an equal
decline in retail food prices as retailers
move to recover costs frozen during
the mid-summer price freeze.
Nevertheless, he said it would
"contribute to a leveling out of retail
prices in the future."
August Prices Rose
Wholesale prices increased 5.8
percent in August on an unadjusted
basis and 6.2 percent on a seasonally
adjusted basis.
The Labor Department's Wholesale
Price Index showed the over-all decline
in wholesale prices last month was 1.8
percent on an unadjusted basis, the
most in any month since a 1.9 percent
drop in February 1948. Seasonally
adjusted, the decline was 1.5 percent,
matching the February 1948 low on
the same basis.
Last month's drop in wholesale
prices followed the biggest one-month
rise in 27 years, a leap of 5.8 percent
from July to August, the period during
which the administration lifted the
freeze on food prices. During the
freeze in July, prices fell 1.3 percent.
Finished Goods
Consumer finished goods, those
products nearest the retail end of the
wholesale chain, fell seven-tenths of
one percent last month, following a
sharp 3.8 percent increase in August.
Prices of farm products fell 6
percent last month â€” the sharpest

decline in 25 years.
The government said the decline
was chiefly the result of lower prices
for livestock and corn, fresh and dried
vegetables, live poultry and eggs. Raw
cotton and milk prices increased,
however.
Farm Products Up
Despite the big September drop,
farm product prices were still 55.8
percent higher than a year ago, with
grains up 111.4 percent; livestock up
43.1 percent; live poultry 101.7
percent; milk 29.2 percent and eggs
66.7 percent.
Prices of processed foods and feeds,
the next step in the wholesale food
chain, also fell 6 percent last month,
reflecting declines in animal feed, meat
and processed poultry prices.
