A Fantasy?
WASHINGTON, October 31st
(VPI) â€” The Watergate Grand
Jury today in a stunning
development handed down a ten
count indictment against
President Richard Nixon on
charges of "excessive illegal

wiretapping," "obstruction of
justice," and "inciting key aides
to break the law."
Public reaction to the
indictment was swift.
Congressional leaders immediately
issued a communique condemning
it as being "irresponsible."
Ex-Vice President Spiro Agnew
denounced the charges as
"damned lies."
President Nixon held a press
conference to charge that
"Certain members of the judicial
system are out to get me." He
accused the Grand Jury of
"political shammary," saying they
are out to "sabotage my legislative
program."
A Gallup telephone poll
released this afternoon showed
that 57 percent of the public
thought the indictment was
unjustified while 8 percent said it
was justified. 35 percent had no
opinion. Another poll indicated
that 79 percent of the public
wanted the President to stay on.
Hie general feeling is that
indicting a president is wrong
since everyone knows he does not

break the law. Even some of those
who admitted Nixon is probably
guilty of much of the wrong-doing
said his resignation would tarnish
America's global image and cause
undue stress here at home.
Hie Grand Jury voted 22-1 to
indict the President.
Remember McGovern?
I picked up a copy of Time
magazine yesterday dated July 24,
1972. On the cover was a picture
of George McGovern and Tom
Eagleton acknowledging the
adulation of their nominating
convention.
I flipped through the pages,
coming across a misty color
photograph of McGovern
pondering the wording of his
acceptance speech. My eyes teared
a little. I flipped a few more
pages.
George McGovern. This was
the man who held an obscure
little press conference in the
plains of South Dakota to
announce his intent to bring
honesty, integrity, and openness

to our government.
This was the man who
appeared in shirt sleeves to talk
with a group of demonstrators at
his convention, while Nixon stood
at an oval office window ordering
his aides to get rid of a lone
placard-carrying protestor on
Pennyslvania Avenue.
This was the man who so
graciously conceded the election,
finding consolation in having
advanced the cause of peace, if
even just a little. Compare him to
Richard Nixon who can be
gracious only when winning and
whose cause is himself.
McGovem. To this man
national security meant money
for schools, health, cities, and the
environment, not money for
burglaries, wiretaps, and
blackmail.
McGovern Knew
How prophetic this man. Who
could have imagined that the
night George McGovem was
extolling "Come home America,
from secrecy and deception in
high places," that Richard Nixon
and his men were scurrying about
the White House pursuing their
precious cover-up.
It was McGovern who was
pressing for public disclosure of
campaign funds while Richard
Nixon was pumping secret funds
into the Watergate eavesdropping
operation.
Ironically it was those things
which George McGovern
campaigned against which
defeated him. He chose Eagleton.
Nixon chose Agnew. McGovem
was hurt because the truth about
Eagleton emerged before the
election. Nixon benefitted
because the truth about Agnew
did not arrive until afterward. It
seems it is not what one stands
for, but what one keeps secret
which wins elections.
A lime For Regrets
Now we can only lament the
terrible poverty of the spirit
which pervades America today
and from which emanates only
negation. We can only bow our
heads in embarrassment while the
men who led us into this, offer to
lead us out. Nixon is allowed to
carry on in a ratification of the
previous four years of mis-deeds.
At the risk of idolizing him, I
think of how noble and unique a
man McGovern is, strained by
neither the blood of
Chappaquidick nor the criminality
of Watergate. We should have
appreciated far more than we did,
the things McGovern tried to tell
us. We are left waiting for a time
when we can again summon up a
great vision and wash away our
despair over the present with hope
for the future.
