As I understand Mr. Hazeghi's
letter to the Daily (Oct. 3), he has
three complaints about KZSU:
1) Hiat KZSU should pick on
KCBS, not another student
station like KFJC.
2) That we don't say how
many people can receive us, or
how much interference we
would create.
3) you dofi't like the
programming.
First, KZSU is a
non-commercial, educational
radio station. We are relegated to
a portion of the FM dial (below
92.1 MHz) in which we can
compete only with other college
stations. We couldn't compete
with KCBS if we wanted to —
even if we had the $5 or $10
million necessary to buy into the
San Francisco market. Any
interference we cause can only be
to other college radio stations.
The FCC should rejfect any
application that causes significant
interference under the FCC's
rules. The FCC rules say that we
don't interfere with KFJC; KFJC
is asking that the rules be
changed.
Second, KZSU's signal does
not now reach about 50 percent
of the Stanford community.
Surveys on file in the University
Planning Office show that half of
the students live more than about
5 miles from our transmitter; half
of the faculty lives more than
about 6 miles away. Our signal
only goes about 6 miles with any
strength, so that means that about
45 percent of the Stanford
community can not receive us.
The point of our power increase is
not to screw KFJC; it is to reach
that other 45 percent.
Third, KZSU is not "a teenage
rock station." I wonder if you
have listened to KZSU recently.
Had you listened Tuesday night,
you would have heard 3 newscasts
and an interview with President
Lyman. If you listen Friday night,
you will hear a program on Gay
Liberation, and an interview with
some members of the football
team, just as examples. If you
listen on Saturday or Sunday
mornings, youll hear classical
music. If you like folk music,
listen after the church service on
Sunday, or Wednesday moming.
If you want jazz, try Sunday or
Thursday night. Monday night is

almost exclusively devoted to Palo
Alto politics and the City Council.
In short, we are not a "teenage
rock station." We put on as many
Public Affairs shows as we can, as
much local news as we can
manage, and the music is quite
varied, as are the tastes of the
Stanford community. We assume
from the students' continued
willingness to support us that we
must be meeting at least some of
their needs — we certainly try. We
want the power increase so that
we will be able to reach more of
the students. If you have
complaints about our
programming, a letter to me will
be much more effective than a
philippic in the Daily. I hope you
will get in touch with me.

'Ratio' Not Funny
Editor:
The "Ratio" article was pure
rot. Your "Stanford Girl Theory,"
"caginess of females," "markets,"
and "hard bargains" were far from
fair. It may have been funny to
some, but others might actually
believe that "Theory."
It could just as easily be said
that Stanford men are choosy
because they think they are
terrific, dashing, Stanford
intellectuals.
If a girl doesn't care for a dude
or vice versa, it's because of many
circumstances. If the girl thinks
there's somebody better, then let
her go find him and leave the poor
guy alone. It would be better to
lose a companion that thinks
you're inferior; even though the
Daily article describes the single
situation as "inevitable despair"
and "unhappiness."
Do not tell me girls are choosy
and guys are not.
Do not even mention "that
Stanford girls are more interested
in careers than in romance."
I suppose that Pete also thinks
that where the male freshman
comes to Stanford hoping "that at
least half of his mother's fears"
will be realized, the average
Stanford girl is void of any
romantic inclinations. Hogwash!
I hope you had fun writing
that article.

Kung Fu
Editor:
Regarding Paul Fong's Daily
article (Sept. 28) about Kung Fu.
You do have some good points
in your article. It is too bad you
cannot see the good side of it
which has nothing to do with the
image of Asians in the United
States but the difference between
two philosophies: Chinese and
American. The difference goes
much further than just a
"violence-non violence
philosophy." I don't think Caine
is a representative of the Chinese
people but he is the symbol of a
philosophy.
I disagree with you when you
say "He is a loner who rarely
shows emotion." It seems to me
that the actions in the show are
mostly his emotions, and the
emotions of those he encounters.
You say that his image is
counter-revolutionary. I totally
disagree. To teach freedom, you
must be free yourself. To teach
revolution, you must have
self-consciousness. His role in the
show is not at all passive (unless
you want to be blind). On his way
to nowhere, he gives his teaching
to anyone he encounters. It leaves
deeper traces than screaming
"revolution-revolution" and no
one listening!

Regarding Paul Fong's Daily
article (Sept. 28) about Kung Fu.
You do have some good points
in your article. It is too bad you
cannot see the good side of it
which has nothing to do with the
image of Asians in the United
States but the difference between
two philosophies: Chinese and
American. The difference goes
much further than just a
"violence-non violence
philosophy." I don't think Caine
is a representative of the Chinese
people but he is the symbol of a
philosophy.
I disagree with you when you
say "He is a loner who rarely
shows emotion." It seems to me
that the actions in the show are
mostly his emotions, and the
emotions of those he encounters.
You say that his image is
counter-revolutionary. I totally
disagree. To teach freedom, you
must be free yourself. To teach
revolution, you must have
self-consciousness. His role in the
show is not at all passive (unless
you want to be blind). On his way
to nowhere, he gives his teaching
to anyone he encounters. It leaves
deeper traces than screaming
"revolution-revolution" and no
one listening!

As I understand Mr. Hazeghi's
letter to the Daily (Oct. 3), he has
three complaints about KZSU:
1) Hiat KZSU should pick on
KCBS, not another student
station like KFJC.
2) That we don't say how
many people can receive us, or
how much interference we
would create.
3) you dofi't like the
programming.
First, KZSU is a
non-commercial, educational
radio station. We are relegated to
a portion of the FM dial (below
92.1 MHz) in which we can
compete only with other college
stations. We couldn't compete
with KCBS if we wanted to —
even if we had the $5 or $10
million necessary to buy into the
San Francisco market. Any
interference we cause can only be
to other college radio stations.
The FCC should rejfect any
application that causes significant
interference under the FCC's
rules. The FCC rules say that we
don't interfere with KFJC; KFJC
is asking that the rules be
changed.
Second, KZSU's signal does
not now reach about 50 percent
of the Stanford community.
Surveys on file in the University
Planning Office show that half of
the students live more than about
5 miles from our transmitter; half
of the faculty lives more than
about 6 miles away. Our signal
only goes about 6 miles with any
strength, so that means that about
45 percent of the Stanford
community can not receive us.
The point of our power increase is
not to screw KFJC; it is to reach
that other 45 percent.
Third, KZSU is not "a teenage
rock station." I wonder if you
have listened to KZSU recently.
Had you listened Tuesday night,
you would have heard 3 newscasts
and an interview with President
Lyman. If you listen Friday night,
you will hear a program on Gay
Liberation, and an interview with
some members of the football
team, just as examples. If you
listen on Saturday or Sunday
mornings, youll hear classical
music. If you like folk music,
listen after the church service on
Sunday, or Wednesday moming.
If you want jazz, try Sunday or
Thursday night. Monday night is

almost exclusively devoted to Palo
Alto politics and the City Council.
In short, we are not a "teenage
rock station." We put on as many
Public Affairs shows as we can, as
much local news as we can
manage, and the music is quite
varied, as are the tastes of the
Stanford community. We assume
from the students' continued
willingness to support us that we
must be meeting at least some of
their needs — we certainly try. We
want the power increase so that
we will be able to reach more of
the students. If you have
complaints about our
programming, a letter to me will
be much more effective than a
philippic in the Daily. I hope you
will get in touch with me.

The "Ratio" article was pure
rot. Your "Stanford Girl Theory,"
"caginess of females," "markets,"
and "hard bargains" were far from
fair. It may have been funny to
some, but others might actually
believe that "Theory."
It could just as easily be said
that Stanford men are choosy
because they think they are
terrific, dashing, Stanford
intellectuals.
If a girl doesn't care for a dude
or vice versa, it's because of many
circumstances. If the girl thinks
there's somebody better, then let
her go find him and leave the poor
guy alone. It would be better to
lose a companion that thinks
you're inferior; even though the
Daily article describes the single
situation as "inevitable despair"
and "unhappiness."
Do not tell me girls are choosy
and guys are not.
Do not even mention "that

In short, we are not a "teenage
rock station." We put on as many
Public Affairs shows as we can, as
much local news as we can
manage, and the music is quite
varied, as are the tastes of the
Stanford community. We assume
from the students' continued
willingness to support us that we
must be meeting at least some of
their needs — we certainly try. We
want the power increase so that
we will be able to reach more of
the students. If you have
complaints about our
programming, a letter to me will
be much more effective than a
philippic in the Daily. I hope you
will get in touch with me.

'Ratio' Not Funny
Editor:
The "Ratio" article was pure
rot. Your "Stanford Girl Theory,"
"caginess of females," "markets,"
and "hard bargains" were far from
fair. It may have been funny to
some, but others might actually
believe that "Theory."
It could just as easily be said
that Stanford men are choosy
because they think they are
terrific, dashing, Stanford
intellectuals.
If a girl doesn't care for a dude
or vice versa, it's because of many
circumstances. If the girl thinks
there's somebody better, then let
her go find him and leave the poor
guy alone. It would be better to
lose a companion that thinks
you're inferior; even though the
Daily article describes the single
situation as "inevitable despair"
and "unhappiness."
Do not tell me girls are choosy
and guys are not.
Do not even mention "that
Stanford girls are more interested
in careers than in romance."
I suppose that Pete also thinks
that where the male freshman
comes to Stanford hoping "that at
least half of his mother's fears"
will be realized, the average
Stanford girl is void of any
romantic inclinations. Hogwash!
I hope you had fun writing
that article.

Kung Fu

Regarding Paul Fong's Daily
article (Sept. 28) about Kung Fu.
You do have some good points
in your article. It is too bad you
cannot see the good side of it
which has nothing to do with the
image of Asians in the United
States but the difference between
two philosophies: Chinese and
American. The difference goes
much further than just a
"violence-non violence
philosophy." I don't think Caine
is a representative of the Chinese
people but he is the symbol of a
philosophy.
I disagree with you when you
say "He is a loner who rarely
shows emotion." It seems to me
that the actions in the show are
mostly his emotions, and the
emotions of those he encounters.
You say that his image is
counter-revolutionary. I totally
disagree. To teach freedom, you
must be free yourself. To teach
revolution, you must have
self-consciousness. His role in the
show is not at all passive (unless
you want to be blind). On his way
to nowhere, he gives his teaching
to anyone he encounters. It leaves
deeper traces than screaming
"revolution-revolution" and no
one listening!

KZSU Replies
Editor:
As I understand Mr. Hazeghi's
letter to the Daily (Oct. 3), he has
three complaints about KZSU:
1) Hiat KZSU should pick on
KCBS, not another student
station like KFJC.
2) That we don't say how
many people can receive us, or
how much interference we
would create.
3) you dofi't like the
programming.
First, KZSU is a
non-commercial, educational
radio station. We are relegated to
a portion of the FM dial (below
92.1 MHz) in which we can
compete only with other college
stations. We couldn't compete
with KCBS if we wanted to —
even if we had the $5 or $10
million necessary to buy into the
San Francisco market. Any
interference we cause can only be
to other college radio stations.
The FCC should rejfect any
application that causes significant
interference under the FCC's
rules. The FCC rules say that we
don't interfere with KFJC; KFJC
is asking that the rules be
changed.
Second, KZSU's signal does
not now reach about 50 percent
of the Stanford community.
Surveys on file in the University
Planning Office show that half of
the students live more than about
5 miles from our transmitter; half
of the faculty lives more than
about 6 miles away. Our signal
only goes about 6 miles with any
strength, so that means that about
45 percent of the Stanford
community can not receive us.
The point of our power increase is
not to screw KFJC; it is to reach
that other 45 percent.
Third, KZSU is not "a teenage
rock station." I wonder if you
have listened to KZSU recently.
Had you listened Tuesday night,
you would have heard 3 newscasts
and an interview with President
Lyman. If you listen Friday night,
you will hear a program on Gay
Liberation, and an interview with
some members of the football
team, just as examples. If you
listen on Saturday or Sunday
mornings, youll hear classical
music. If you like folk music,
listen after the church service on
Sunday, or Wednesday moming.
If you want jazz, try Sunday or
Thursday night. Monday night is

almost exclusively devoted to Palo
Alto politics and the City Council.
In short, we are not a "teenage
rock station." We put on as many
Public Affairs shows as we can, as
much local news as we can
manage, and the music is quite
varied, as are the tastes of the
Stanford community. We assume
