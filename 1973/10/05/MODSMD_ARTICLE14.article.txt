# Embarcadero Fwy. To Be Torn Down
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -
Federal agreement for joint
planning to tear down the
Embarcadero Freeway and build
an underground freeway link with
the Golden Gate Bridge was
announced yesterday by Mayor
Joseph L. Alioto.
The city has demanded the
overhead freeway structure's
removal and opposed any linking
of its stub with the bridge by a
surface freeway.
He said a busy round of
conferences in Washington
Wednesday also assured a strong
chance for a private industrial
firm to take over the Hunters
Point Naval Shipyard after it is
closed down by the Navy.
Alioto spoke at a news
conference on his fast one-day
Washington mission. He flew to
the nation's capital a day after
formally announcing he seeks the
1974 Democratic nomination for
governor.
He said a strong presentation
was made to James Lynn, Housing
and Urban Development
secretary, for a funding
commitment to complete 800 low
cost housing units in Phase Two
of the Hunters Point housing
redevelopment project. The
project has been halted by the
Nixon administration's freeze on
low cost housing projects.
Alioto said Norbert Tiemann,
head of the Federal Highway
Administration, agreed to support
a joint study to develop a specific

plan for tearing the waterfront
freeway down and determine
costs for an underground freeway
connection with the Golden Gate
bridge.
He said Frank Hawley, the
regional federal highway
administrator here, will work with
John H. Tolan Jr., the city's
development director, on the
study.
No special fund will be needed
for the study, he said. The
available federal and city staffs
will do the design development
and cost figuring work, he said.
