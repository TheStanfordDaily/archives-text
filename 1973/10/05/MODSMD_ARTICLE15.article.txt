James L. Gibbs, Jr., dean of
undergraduate studies and
professor of anthropology has
been appointed a Phi Beta Kappa
Visiting Scholar for 1973-74.
A former fellow of the Center

eight institutions: Rockford

University in November;

University of Arkansas and South

and Mills College in March.
During his two-day stay at each

of formal and informal
encounters, which usually include
classroom discussions, seminars,

topics as: conflict resolution
among the Kpelle of Liberia;
anthropological studies of male
initiation ceremonies; and music
of indigenous Black Africa.
The Phi Beta Kappa Visiting
Scholar Program was begun in
1956 to enable undergraduates to
meet and talk with established
scholars in diverse disciplines.
