# Thought For Food
## Tunney Eats On $1.25 A Day 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Sen.
John V. Tunney, D-Calif., has
spent most of the past two weeks
thinking about food.
That's what happens, he told a
news conference Wednesday,
when you have to eat on $1.25 a
day — as many Americans do.
Tunney began Sept. 21 a
two-week stint of spending only
$1.25 a day for food. The figure
was suggested by an elderly
witness at hearings conducted by
Tunney in California on high food
prices.
Witnesses said that's how much
many retired persons have to
spend on food.
"I learned that I don't like it,"
Tunney said. "You spend almost
all your time thinking about
food."
Tunney, who is 6 feet, 2 inches
tall and weighed 180 pounds
when he began his experiment,
has lost about six pounds since, he
said.
He has kept faithfully to the
$1.25-a-day limit, he said, and
may have a little food left over,
"because I didn't like some of the

food selections chosen by my
press assistant — such as cheese
crackers and onion sticks."
He doesn't care much for rice,
either, Tunney said, "but I'll
probably hit it pretty heavy the
next few days because I feel a
great need for bulk."
The senator, who is separated
from his wife, did his own
cooking, an aide said.
"A couple of times he was
invited out for dinner," the aide
said, "Then either he brought his
own food cm* his hosts had a
special plate for him."
The psychological effect of his
diet has been enormous, Tunney
said.

"My tolerance for upsetting
news has gone way down,"
Tunney said. "I'm irritated most
of the time, whereas I've always
regarded myself as easy-going. My
staff will be very happy when this
is over."
He added: "If Secretary of
Agriculture Earl Butz and some
of these sweet bureaucrats would
take a turn at eating on $1.25 a
day maybe they wouldn't be so
eager to cut back programs like
the school lunch prog, j ,n."
Tunney said he is .ntroducing
legislation that would allow
Congress to restrict food exports
and strengthen the price control
enforcement program.

food."
Tunney, who is 6 feet, 2 inches
tall and weighed 180 pounds
when he began his experiment,
has lost about six pounds since, he
said.
He has kept faithfully to the
$1.25-a-day limit, he said, and
may have a little food left over,
"because I didn't like some of the

food selections chosen by my
press assistant — such as cheese
crackers and onion sticks."
He doesn't care much for rice,
either, Tunney said, "but I'll
probably hit it pretty heavy the
next few days because I feel a
great need for bulk."
The senator, who is separated
from his wife, did his own
cooking, an aide said.
"A couple of times he was
invited out for dinner," the aide
said, "Then either he brought his
own food cm* his hosts had a
special plate for him."
The psychological effect of his
diet has been enormous, Tunney
said.

"My tolerance for upsetting
news has gone way down,"
Tunney said. "I'm irritated most
of the time, whereas I've always
regarded myself as easy-going. My
staff will be very happy when this
is over."
He added: "If Secretary of
Agriculture Earl Butz and some
of these sweet bureaucrats would
take a turn at eating on $1.25 a
day maybe they wouldn't be so
eager to cut back programs like
the school lunch prog, j ,n."
Tunney said he is .ntroducing
legislation that would allow
Congress to restrict food exports
and strengthen the price control
enforcement program.
