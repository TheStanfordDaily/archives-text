# Law Prof Lauds Edison Decision
## 
### 
Law Prof. William Gould
believes Tuesday's court decision
ordering the Detroit Edison Co. to
pay $4 million in damages for
racial discrimination will make
large companies more concerned
with the effects of racial
discrimination.
Gould served as chief counsel
for the plaintiffs, who also were
awarded $250,000 from Local
223 of the Utility Workers of
America. According to Gould, the
U.S. District Court decision will
"serve as a deterrent and
encourage settlement of claims"
now pending in other cases.
One of these cases, involving
Pacific Intermountain Express and
Teamster locals 468 and 70,
makes Detroit Edison "look like
angels," according to Gould.
Although Detroit Edison has
appealed the decision, Gould feels
the decision will make
corporation managers more
concerned about first-line
supervisor-employee relations.
Gould, who became interested
in the case while a professor at
Wayne State University in Detroit,
will receive nothing more than
out-of-pocket expenses. He took
the case on the request of several

black workers.
"I felt that if big corporations
and big unions could defy the law
[Title VII, Civil Rights Act of
1964] smaller employers and
unions would not feel under any
obligation to abide by it.
"Edison is a leader. People
look to them as an example."
