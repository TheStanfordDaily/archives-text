# 'Populist' Hafif Runs For Governor
## Lawyer Launches 'Straight Talk’ Campaign 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
SAN FRANCISCO - What
George McGovern did on a
national level to capture the
Democratic Presidential
nomination last year, Herb Hafif
hopes to do on a statewide level
to become California's next
governor.
The 43-year-old attorney from
Claremont in Los Angeles County
announced his candidacy for the
Democratic nomination — which

he admits, "did not rival the
Magna Charta" in importance —
earlier this week in press
conferences in San Francisco and
Los Angeles.
At an organizational dinner in
San Francisco Wednesday night,
Hafif spent less time on specific
issues than on furthering his image
as an underdog populist, declaring
that "the people are ready for a
guy who'll say the same thing in
every place."
Hafif (pronounced "Haff")
may not be your ordinary
populist, though. As immediate
past president of the California
Trial Lawyers Association and
1972 National Trial Lawyers
Association "consumer advocate
of the year," Hafif has built a
reputation for himself in legal
circles, even if his name is
something less than a household
word elsewhere.
'Straight Talk'
In a brief interview after his
Wednesday night speech, Hafif
told the Daily he's basing his
campaign on the idea of "straight
talk."

"I can win because I'm not
talking morality, I'm taling sense.
I can tell a conservative that it
makes no sense to spend
thousands of dollars on so-called
victimless crimes and he'll listen
to me because I'm not throwing
morals at him, I'm making sense."
Or, as he told the San
Bernardino Sun-Telegram: "If two
guys want to hold hands and skip
off into the sunset, that's their
problem."
Debate
The outspoken Hafif said he
wants to debate the other
Democratic gubernatorial
contenders but says he isn't sure if
they want to debate him.
"[San Francisco major Joseph]
Alioto wants to debate Jerry
Brown [Secretary of State
Edmund G. Brown Jr.). Hell,
everyone wants to debate Jerry
Brown. My kid wants to debate
Jerry Brown, and he's only 11. If
I debate him, I'll eat him alive."
The candidate seems to be
basing much of his campaign on
his own estimation of himself as
an organizer and speaker. He has

pledged that if he can't draw 7000
paying spectators to the Long
Beach Arena ("the worst possible
place for a political rally") on
Oct. 30 "a year before the
election and the Tuesday before
Halloween, the worst possible
time"), he'll withdraw from the
race.
Hafif has somewhat hedged his
bet, though; billing for the rally
puts entertainer Ray Charles'
name above his own.
Hafif said Wednesday he is
opposed to Prop. 1, Gov. Ronald
Reagan's controversial tax
initiative. He called the plan "a
gimmick ... bullshit." He also
opposes reinstatement i of the
death penalty except for inmate
crimes.
His entry brings to seven the
number of announced or active
Democratic candidates. In
addition to Brown and Alioto,
they are Assembly Speaker Bob
Moretti, state Senate Majority
Leader George Moscone, Rep.
Jerome Waldie and University of
California regent William Matson
Roth.
