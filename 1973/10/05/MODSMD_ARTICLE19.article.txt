The Making of the President 1972
by Theodore H. White
Atheneum, 1973. $10.95
Teddy White — the "groupie of
the power elite," according to
Author Jack Newfield — has
issued the fourth thought
provoking volume of his
"narrative histories of American
politics in action," The Making of
the President 1972.
Actually, "history" is possibly
a misleading label. It implies a
collection of facts devoid of
interpretation or analysis. In The
Making of the President 1972,
White has taken his largest steps
into the realm of interpretation,
thus rendering himself vulnerable
to violent disagreement from
those whose interpretations differ
from his own.
But at the same time, he has
stimulated his readers, whether in
agreement or disagreement, more
than in his previous books.
White's central thesis, and the
one most open to dispute, is
simple: he says that even if the
full chronicle of crime, corruption
and "White House horrors" had
been exposed prior to the
election, Nixon still would have
won — albeit by less than historic
proportions. Further, White
contends that "in 1972, given the
moods, emotions and public
issues" neither George McGovern

"nor any other Democrat" could
have won.
Can we accept this?
Post-election polls taken during
the Watergate revelations
rematching the two 1972
nominees showed McGovern
steadily closing the massive gap
between Nixon and himself.
Finally, one poll earlier this year
said that if the election had been
held then rather than in
November, George McGovern
would have been elected.
Of course, for one to say that
he would have voted for
McGovern six months after the
fact, and to actually vote for him,
may be two quite different things.
Implicit in this position is the
view that the American people,
given the choice between an
honest man whose ideas are
considered "radical" and a
dishonest man with "safe" ideas,
will choose the latter.
Such a self-perpetuating debate
can last for years; here, White is
on at least reasonably firm
ground. But to declare flatly that
no Democrat could have defeated
Nixon appears substantially less
tenable; it seems more logical that
had Watergate been revealed, the
right Democrat could have won.
White's reasons for his
declaration are unconvincing. The
author has once again slipped into

a most familiar and unfortunate
characteristic: he is so awed by
the office of the Presidency that
he almost automatically becomes
awed by its inhabitants.
Here we have White, the
long-time liberal, waxing
adulatory over a chief executive
of strikingly dissimilar political
views, a man who has presided
over the most corrupt
administration in U.S. history,
and who is responsible for some
of the most repressive and
frightening actions the U.S. has
ever seen.
One feels that ideology and
action play little or no part in
White's evaluation; he would
praise President Barry Goldwater
as much as President John
Kennedy. White exemplifies a
political application of Vince
Lombardi's axiom that "winning
isn't everything — it's the only
thing."
Well, winning isn't the only
thing. Honor counts for
something too. And honor — not
money or staff or television time
— was in short supply at the top
echelons of Nixon's re-election
campaign.
Luckily, White's Nixon
apologia does not completely
overshadow his genuine insights.
Of particular interest arc the two
chapters White devotes to the

press and to the Watergate scandal
and cover-up.
White writes that Nixon saw
the press as a narrow,
openly-hostile, elitist corps of
self-appointed minions who
interposed themselves between
the President and "his people."
To combat this, Nixon geared his
campaign to circumvent the press
and appeal directly to "out
there."
This strategy worked — much
to the chagrin of a press that
could not get at the candidate.
From the "surrogate" campaign
to the extensive use of radio
campaign speeches to the dearth
of press conferences, Nixon was
less a candidate than an eminence
grise to his own re-election
campaign.
Because of obvious deadline
pressures, White's Watergate

chapter is by necessity a tale
haif-told. However, he still
provides glimpses of some of the
principal figures in the case,
digging behind the 'acades
presented to the public.
Of all the major figures, White
seems most appalled at the
involvement of John D.
Ehrlichman, whom he describes as
a man of genuine humanity.
In the context of his previous
efforts, The Making of the
President 1972 is not as romantic
as the 1960 volume, nor as dry
and straightforward as the 1964
book, nor as tumultuous as the
1968 chronicle. Whether it is his
best effort is open to question;
that it is his most stimulating and
provocative few will deny.
