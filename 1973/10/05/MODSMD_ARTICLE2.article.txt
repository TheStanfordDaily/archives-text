# SJC Vote Includes Membership Shift
## 
### PETER ALESHIRE 
Students will vote next Wednesday
and Thursday on the Committee of 15
(C-15) proposal for a student majority
judicial system.
The C-15 proposed the new system,
known as the Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC), last May after three
months of deliberation. Students
defeated an earlier C-15 proposal by a
sizeable margin in October, 1972.
The student body, the Faculty
Senate and President Richard Lyman
each must approve the SJC before it
takes effect.
The new SJC would be a panel of
four students, three faculty members,
and a chairman from the Law School
who would vote only to break a tie.
Faculty Majority
The current judicial system —
known as the Campus Judicial Panel
(CJP) — has only three student
members, in effect giving the faculty a
one-vote majority.
The student majority could be
ended at any time by the University
president, a two-thirds vote of the
academic Senate, or a two-thirds vote
of the ASSU Senate.
The Academic Senate would
continue to elect faculty members of
the panel, but student selection would
no longer be done on a random basis.
Instead, the Dean of Student
Affairs would compile a random list of
60 students. The first 12 on the list to
agree to serve on the SJC would be
screened by the ASSU president and a
representative of the Academic Senate.
Two Can Veto
Either of the two could veto up to
three of the students on the list, and
the four names at the top after
screening would be appointed to the
SJC.
Fact-finding in cases before the SJC
would be done by independent hearing
officers, just as it is under the current
CJP.
The proposed SJC has stirred
considerable debate among student
leaders. ASSU Senate Chairman Rocky
Barber, who supports the C-15
proposal, said, "The point that should
be made is that it's a first step. I don't
see this as a final step. Trust is starting
to be restored between faculty and
students on the C-15. It was a very
tough compromise and they [the
students] wouldn't get everything
they got this year if they tried it
again."
Presidents Opposed
The ASSU Council of Presidents is
firmly opposed to the proposal. "This
really isn't the best we can do," said

Council member Jim Friend. "If you
look at the trend of the C-15, it is to
examine this thing a little more closely
each year. This particular proposal is
not worthy of the student stamp of
approval."
The present proposal comes in the
wake of over two years of student
refusal to approve the system used in
dealing with infractions of University
rules.
President Lyman adopted the
current Campus Judicial Panel in
November 1971 after the ASSU
Senate refused to appoint the
members of a committee charged with
the selection of the student
membership of the old judicial system.
Earlier, the president and the
Faculty Senate had rejected the ASSU
Senate's demand for a student
majority in the old system.
Proposal Defeated
In May 1972, the C-15 proposed a
new system which also included a
faculty majority. The student body
defeated the proposal by a vote of
1478 to 464 last October.
The ASSU Council of Presidents is
worried about the stability of the
student majority. Council member
Beth Garfield said, "It seems rather a
sham to me that the student majority
can be taken away at any time and
that some of the rights that were given
to students by the old SJC were not in
this. I just hope that students will be
able to see beyond the sham of a
student majority."
Garfield added that "the point is
that this system is going to be with us
for a long time. This new proposal is
no better than the proposal that
already exists. The student majority
doesn't mean enough to make a
difference," she said.
Friend agreed, saying, "In the
crunch it wouldn't make a difference."
He said that the option to remove the
student majority could be used if the
University ever re-entered a period of
student protest.
Barber Disagrees
However, Barber took exception
with the Council, explaining that "I
don't think the student majority is
going to be cut down willfully. It
comes down to whether you think the
administration can be trusted a little
bit. The Council of Presidents think
the administration will clamp down at
the first rock of the boat. I just don't
think they'll be willing to stir up that
much trouble.
"If they were really mad about one
particular case it wouldn't serve their
purposes to throw out the student
majority. I think a better government
can be built on a certain amount of
trust."
Garfield also criticized the different
methods of choosing faculty and
student members of the committee.
"It's an unequal kind of choice. It
means the student has no say on who
is going to represent them while the
faculty can pick whomever they
want."
Barber saw the different selection
methods as a necessary compromise.
"The faculty was adamant that the
students should not be allowed to
chose their members. They don't want
the same thing to happen as happened
in 1969. The student members of the
C-15 saw that and wisely used a
concession on that as a bargaining
point."
"The faculty members are probably

more conservative than they would be
if they were selected by random, but
the present compromise is not
unworkable," he said.
President Lyman also supports the
new proposal. "It was a compromise
proposal and it comes after a very
earnest and industrious effort by the
C-15 last year.
"It's not easy to imagine what
circumstances would lead to the
removal of the student majority. I
think only rather gross and persistent
failure of the system could cause that,
and further, failure that could be
traced directly to a student majority.
4 T think it is going to take quite a
while to come up with another
proposal if this one is rejected. With
the favorable circumstances we had
last year it seems to me unlikely that
we're going to get much better
results," said Lyman.
Students will vote next Wednesday
and Thursday on the Committee of 15
(C-15) proposal for a student majority
judicial system.
The C-15 proposed the new system,

the four names at the top after
screening would be appointed to the
SJC.
Fact-finding in cases before the SJC
would be done by independent hearing
officers, just as it is under the current
CJP.
The proposed SJC has stirred
considerable debate among student

who would vote only to break a tie.
Faculty Majority
The current judicial system —
known as the Campus Judicial Panel
(CJP) — has only three student
members, in effect giving the faculty a
one-vote majority.
The student majority could be
ended at any time by the University
president, a two-thirds vote of the
academic Senate, or a two-thirds vote
of the ASSU Senate.
The Academic Senate would
continue to elect faculty members of
the panel, but student selection would
no longer be done on a random basis.
Instead, the Dean of Student
Affairs would compile a random list of
60 students. The first 12 on the list to
agree to serve on the SJC would be
screened by the ASSU president and a
representative of the Academic Senate.
Two Can Veto
Either of the two could veto up to
three of the students on the list, and
the four names at the top after
screening would be appointed to the
SJC.
Fact-finding in cases before the SJC
would be done by independent hearing
officers, just as it is under the current
CJP.
The proposed SJC has stirred
considerable debate among student
leaders. ASSU Senate Chairman Rocky
Barber, who supports the C-15
proposal, said, "The point that should
be made is that it's a first step. I don't
see this as a final step. Trust is starting
to be restored between faculty and
students on the C-15. It was a very
tough compromise and they [the
students] wouldn't get everything
they got this year if they tried it
again."
Presidents Opposed
The ASSU Council of Presidents is
firmly opposed to the proposal. "This
really isn't the best we can do," said

Council member Jim Friend. "If you
look at the trend of the C-15, it is to
examine this thing a little more closely
each year. This particular proposal is
not worthy of the student stamp of
approval."
The present proposal comes in the
wake of over two years of student
refusal to approve the system used in
dealing with infractions of University
rules.
President Lyman adopted the
current Campus Judicial Panel in
November 1971 after the ASSU
Senate refused to appoint the
members of a committee charged with
the selection of the student
membership of the old judicial system.
Earlier, the president and the
Faculty Senate had rejected the ASSU
Senate's demand for a student
majority in the old system.
Proposal Defeated
In May 1972, the C-15 proposed a
new system which also included a
faculty majority. The student body
defeated the proposal by a vote of
1478 to 464 last October.
The ASSU Council of Presidents is
worried about the stability of the
student majority. Council member
Beth Garfield said, "It seems rather a
sham to me that the student majority
can be taken away at any time and
that some of the rights that were given
to students by the old SJC were not in
this. I just hope that students will be
able to see beyond the sham of a
student majority."
Garfield added that "the point is
that this system is going to be with us
for a long time. This new proposal is
no better than the proposal that
already exists. The student majority
doesn't mean enough to make a
difference," she said.
Friend agreed, saying, "In the
crunch it wouldn't make a difference."
He said that the option to remove the
student majority could be used if the
University ever re-entered a period of
student protest.
Barber Disagrees
However, Barber took exception
with the Council, explaining that "I
don't think the student majority is
going to be cut down willfully. It
comes down to whether you think the
administration can be trusted a little
bit. The Council of Presidents think
the administration will clamp down at
the first rock of the boat. I just don't
think they'll be willing to stir up that
much trouble.
"If they were really mad about one
particular case it wouldn't serve their
purposes to throw out the student
majority. I think a better government
can be built on a certain amount of
trust."
Garfield also criticized the different
methods of choosing faculty and
student members of the committee.
"It's an unequal kind of choice. It
means the student has no say on who
is going to represent them while the
faculty can pick whomever they
want."
Barber saw the different selection
methods as a necessary compromise.
"The faculty was adamant that the
students should not be allowed to
chose their members. They don't want
the same thing to happen as happened
in 1969. The student members of the
C-15 saw that and wisely used a
concession on that as a bargaining
point."
"The faculty members are probably

more conservative than they would be
if they were selected by random, but
the present compromise is not
unworkable," he said.
President Lyman also supports the
new proposal. "It was a compromise
proposal and it comes after a very
earnest and industrious effort by the
C-15 last year.
"It's not easy to imagine what
circumstances would lead to the
removal of the student majority. I
think only rather gross and persistent
failure of the system could cause that,
and further, failure that could be
traced directly to a student majority.
4 T think it is going to take quite a
while to come up with another
proposal if this one is rejected. With
the favorable circumstances we had
last year it seems to me unlikely that
we're going to get much better
results," said Lyman.
Students will vote next Wednesday
and Thursday on the Committee of 15
(C-15) proposal for a student majority
judicial system.
The C-15 proposed the new system,
known as the Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC), last May after three
months of deliberation. Students
defeated an earlier C-15 proposal by a
sizeable margin in October, 1972.
The student body, the Faculty

60 students. The first 12 on the list to
agree to serve on the SJC would be

representative of the Academic Senate.
Two Can Veto
Either of the two could veto up to
three of the students on the list, and
the four names at the top after
screening would be appointed to the
SJC.
Fact-finding in cases before the SJC
would be done by independent hearing
officers, just as it is under the current
CJP.
The proposed SJC has stirred
considerable debate among student

60 students. The first 12 on the list to
agree to serve on the SJC would be
screened by the ASSU president and a
representative of the Academic Senate.
Two Can Veto
Either of the two could veto up to
three of the students on the list, and
the four names at the top after
screening would be appointed to the
SJC.
Fact-finding in cases before the SJC
would be done by independent hearing
officers, just as it is under the current
CJP.
The proposed SJC has stirred
considerable debate among student
leaders. ASSU Senate Chairman Rocky
Barber, who supports the C-15
proposal, said, "The point that should
be made is that it's a first step. I don't
see this as a final step. Trust is starting
to be restored between faculty and
students on the C-15. It was a very
tough compromise and they [the
students] wouldn't get everything
they got this year if they tried it
again."
Presidents Opposed
The ASSU Council of Presidents is
firmly opposed to the proposal. "This
really isn't the best we can do," said

Council member Jim Friend. "If you
look at the trend of the C-15, it is to
examine this thing a little more closely
each year. This particular proposal is
not worthy of the student stamp of
approval."
The present proposal comes in the
wake of over two years of student
refusal to approve the system used in
dealing with infractions of University
rules.
President Lyman adopted the
current Campus Judicial Panel in
November 1971 after the ASSU
Senate refused to appoint the
members of a committee charged with
the selection of the student
membership of the old judicial system.
Earlier, the president and the
Faculty Senate had rejected the ASSU
Senate's demand for a student
majority in the old system.
Proposal Defeated
In May 1972, the C-15 proposed a
new system which also included a
faculty majority. The student body
defeated the proposal by a vote of
1478 to 464 last October.
The ASSU Council of Presidents is
worried about the stability of the
student majority. Council member
Beth Garfield said, "It seems rather a
sham to me that the student majority
can be taken away at any time and
that some of the rights that were given
to students by the old SJC were not in
this. I just hope that students will be
able to see beyond the sham of a
student majority."
Garfield added that "the point is
that this system is going to be with us
for a long time. This new proposal is
no better than the proposal that
already exists. The student majority
doesn't mean enough to make a
difference," she said.
Friend agreed, saying, "In the
crunch it wouldn't make a difference."
He said that the option to remove the
student majority could be used if the
University ever re-entered a period of
student protest.
Barber Disagrees
However, Barber took exception
with the Council, explaining that "I
don't think the student majority is
going to be cut down willfully. It
comes down to whether you think the
administration can be trusted a little
bit. The Council of Presidents think
the administration will clamp down at
the first rock of the boat. I just don't
think they'll be willing to stir up that
much trouble.
"If they were really mad about one
particular case it wouldn't serve their
purposes to throw out the student
majority. I think a better government
can be built on a certain amount of
trust."
Garfield also criticized the different
methods of choosing faculty and
student members of the committee.
"It's an unequal kind of choice. It
means the student has no say on who
is going to represent them while the
faculty can pick whomever they
want."
Barber saw the different selection
methods as a necessary compromise.
"The faculty was adamant that the
students should not be allowed to
chose their members. They don't want
the same thing to happen as happened
in 1969. The student members of the
C-15 saw that and wisely used a
concession on that as a bargaining
point."
"The faculty members are probably

more conservative than they would be
if they were selected by random, but
the present compromise is not
unworkable," he said.
President Lyman also supports the
new proposal. "It was a compromise
proposal and it comes after a very
earnest and industrious effort by the
C-15 last year.
"It's not easy to imagine what
circumstances would lead to the
removal of the student majority. I
think only rather gross and persistent
failure of the system could cause that,
and further, failure that could be
traced directly to a student majority.
4 T think it is going to take quite a
while to come up with another
proposal if this one is rejected. With
the favorable circumstances we had
last year it seems to me unlikely that
we're going to get much better
results," said Lyman.
Students will vote next Wednesday
and Thursday on the Committee of 15
(C-15) proposal for a student majority
judicial system.
The C-15 proposed the new system,
known as the Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC), last May after three
months of deliberation. Students
defeated an earlier C-15 proposal by a
sizeable margin in October, 1972.
The student body, the Faculty
Senate and President Richard Lyman
each must approve the SJC before it
takes effect.
The new SJC would be a panel of
four students, three faculty members,
and a chairman from the Law School
who would vote only to break a tie.
Faculty Majority
The current judicial system —
known as the Campus Judicial Panel
(CJP) — has only three student
members, in effect giving the faculty a
one-vote majority.
The student majority could be
ended at any time by the University
president, a two-thirds vote of the
academic Senate, or a two-thirds vote
of the ASSU Senate.
The Academic Senate would
continue to elect faculty members of
the panel, but student selection would
no longer be done on a random basis.
Instead, the Dean of Student
Affairs would compile a random list of
60 students. The first 12 on the list to
agree to serve on the SJC would be
screened by the ASSU president and a
representative of the Academic Senate.
Two Can Veto
Either of the two could veto up to
three of the students on the list, and
the four names at the top after
screening would be appointed to the
SJC.
Fact-finding in cases before the SJC
would be done by independent hearing
officers, just as it is under the current
CJP.
The proposed SJC has stirred
considerable debate among student
leaders. ASSU Senate Chairman Rocky
Barber, who supports the C-15
proposal, said, "The point that should
