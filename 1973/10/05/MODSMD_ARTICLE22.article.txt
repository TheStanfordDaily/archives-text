# 'The Resurrection Of Eve'
## Tedious Porn Follows 'Green Door' 
### GEORGE POWELL 
The Resurrection of Eve, is the
Mitchell brothers latest hard-core
film effort following the highly
successful Behind the Green Door.
If the Mitchell brothers hadn't
done so well with their last film
The Resurrection of Eve wouldn't
have been so disappointing. But
with the success of Green Door,
one expects the brothers to show
a bit more class. Even a touch of
class was noticably lacking in Eve.
A Few Twists
There are a few twists, though,
that only serve to complicate
things. Three different actresses
play Eve, with Marilyn Chambers
as the third , leaving her out of
the first part of the film.
Since Chambers was the main
attraction of Green Door, her
absence makes Eve much less
erotic, but the action doesn't pick
up much even after she arrives on
the scene.
However, there's never much

of a scene for her to arrive on. In
a confusing series of
flash-forwards and flashbacks,
Eve's "traumatic" sexual
experience as a child is shown,
and then her subsequent affair
with a hip San Francisco disc
jockey.
Can't Cope
The cool jock can't cope with
Eve's friendship with a pro boxer
(Johnnie Keyes), so the jock and
Eve have an argument and Eve
rushes out to have a car accident
which mangles up her face. After
the bandages come off, her new
face looks just like Marilyn
Chambers.
If this sounds silly, it is not
only that, but dull and confusing
to boot. Abrupt jumping forward
and backward in time makes the
first half-hour very disjointed.
The one pearl in all this muck
is the scene between 12 year-old
Eve and her mother's merchant
seaman "friend," who first

demonstrates on a Raggedy Ann
doll, and then on Eve, how they
kiss in France, and what they do
in Italy and Hong Kong, to
conclude a wry and randy sexual
geography lesson.
Lewd Mediocrity
All this lecherous fantasy
happens in the first 10 minutes,
and then Eve and the film slip
rapidly downhill into boredom
and mediocrity.
Eve (Marilyn Chambers) finally
marries the cool S.F. disc jock,
and he introduces his reluctant
wife to a series of swinging
parties. So the Mitchell brothers
get to show a lot of orgies, but
provide very little erotic buildup.
Almost incessantly the
audience is plunged directly into
masses of copulating bodies. Even
though the participants are
wierdly made up, and may vary
things with a little Mazola or
bondage, the orgy scenes are
always presented without any

more subtlety than a cow and bull
doing it down on the farm.
Brief Respite
The only respite from this
mind-numbing succession of
group-fornication sessions comes
when Johnnie Keyes and Eve
meet again at the week's orgy and
dance up a storm before
consummating on the couch.
Their dancing is more interesting
and a bigger turn-on than most of
the sex scenes, which proves you
can't make a sexy movie with just
an unending number of sex acts.
With this film, the Mitchell
Brothers seem to have forgotten
everything that made Green Door
an erotic and artistic success.
Mazola is not enough to oil down
the tired, rusty plot of The
Resurrection of Eve.

first half-hour very disjointed.
The one pearl in all this muck
is the scene between 12 year-old
Eve and her mother's merchant
seaman "friend," who first

demonstrates on a Raggedy Ann
doll, and then on Eve, how they
kiss in France, and what they do
in Italy and Hong Kong, to
conclude a wry and randy sexual
geography lesson.
Lewd Mediocrity
All this lecherous fantasy
happens in the first 10 minutes,
and then Eve and the film slip
rapidly downhill into boredom
and mediocrity.
Eve (Marilyn Chambers) finally
marries the cool S.F. disc jock,
and he introduces his reluctant
wife to a series of swinging
parties. So the Mitchell brothers
get to show a lot of orgies, but
provide very little erotic buildup.
Almost incessantly the
audience is plunged directly into
masses of copulating bodies. Even
though the participants are
wierdly made up, and may vary
things with a little Mazola or
bondage, the orgy scenes are
always presented without any

more subtlety than a cow and bull
doing it down on the farm.
Brief Respite
The only respite from this
mind-numbing succession of
group-fornication sessions comes
when Johnnie Keyes and Eve
meet again at the week's orgy and
dance up a storm before
consummating on the couch.
Their dancing is more interesting
and a bigger turn-on than most of
the sex scenes, which proves you
can't make a sexy movie with just
an unending number of sex acts.
With this film, the Mitchell
Brothers seem to have forgotten
everything that made Green Door
an erotic and artistic success.
Mazola is not enough to oil down
the tired, rusty plot of The
Resurrection of Eve.
The Resurrection of Eve, is the
Mitchell brothers latest hard-core
film effort following the highly
successful Behind the Green Door.
If the Mitchell brothers hadn't
done so well with their last film
The Resurrection of Eve wouldn't
have been so disappointing. But
with the success of Green Door,
one expects the brothers to show
a bit more class. Even a touch of
class was noticably lacking in Eve.
A Few Twists
There are a few twists, though,
that only serve to complicate
things. Three different actresses
play Eve, with Marilyn Chambers
as the third , leaving her out of
the first part of the film.
Since Chambers was the main
attraction of Green Door, her
absence makes Eve much less
erotic, but the action doesn't pick
up much even after she arrives on
the scene.
However, there's never much

of a scene for her to arrive on. In
a confusing series of
flash-forwards and flashbacks,
Eve's "traumatic" sexual
experience as a child is shown,
and then her subsequent affair
with a hip San Francisco disc
jockey.
Can't Cope
The cool jock can't cope with
Eve's friendship with a pro boxer
(Johnnie Keyes), so the jock and
Eve have an argument and Eve
rushes out to have a car accident
which mangles up her face. After
the bandages come off, her new
face looks just like Marilyn
Chambers.
If this sounds silly, it is not
only that, but dull and confusing
to boot. Abrupt jumping forward
and backward in time makes the
first half-hour very disjointed.
