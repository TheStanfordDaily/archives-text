## ‘Hendrix': Biography Of Musical Giant 
### Hendrix by Chris Welch 
Very few rock musicians have
attained a high enough position to
earn an entire book devoted to
them alone. Hendrix, by Chris
Welch, attempts to clear up some
of the confusion and mystery
which surrounds the life and
death of Jimi Hendrix, the
greatest rock guitarist of all time.
The Who's Peter Townsend
said that Hendrix had perhaps an
even greater impact on rock than
(fid the Beatles. Considering that
Hendrix was on the scene a total
of only five years, and only had

three or four singles which
reached even the slightest degree
of success in America, one begins
to realize what a genius the man
must have been.
Welch is the feature editor for
England's pop magazine Melody
Maker. His biography of Hendrix
consists mostly of interviews and
personal observations.
Among those interviewed are:
Henrix's first bass player, Noel
Redding; Chas Chandler, who
discovered Hendrix and took him
to England; Hendrix's two road
managers, Gerry Sickells and Eric
Barrett; and Hendrix himself.
While the book seeks to "tell it

like it was," there is an
unavoidable abundance of
contradictions in the many
opinions and observations of the
late guitarist. Some say he
consciously became heavily
involved with drugs; others say
drugs were forced upon him.
Some say he was very shy and
naive, while others say he was just
playing a game.
The biggest question mark in
the book centers around the cause
of Hendrix's death. According to
the autopsy, Hendrix took several
sleeping pills with wine causing a
poisonous reaction. He died of
inhalation of vomit.

Most of those who were close
to Hendrix rule out the possibility
of suicide. The coroner's report
stated: "insufficient evidence of
circumstances; open verdict."
Jimi Hendrix died on Sept. 18,
1970 at age 27, just before Noel
Redding was to rejoin Hendrix
(replacing Billy Cox) to reunite
the original Experience with
drummer Mitch Mitchell.
Hendrix features a generous
collection of fine photographs of
Hendrix, who was easily the most
photogenic musician in rock
history.
Also included in the book is a
complete Hendrix discography,
including all bootleg albums and
recordings made before James
Marshall Hendrix became Jimi
Hendrix.
His legacy, although small, is
unbelievably impressive, but only
suggests what an amazing musical
giant he really was and might have
continued to be.
