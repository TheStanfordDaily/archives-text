# Cards Wait For Saturday With Friday Night Movies
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Did you ever wonder what in the world Stanford
football players could have been thinking about last
year when they fumbled three times in a tight 10-6
victory over Duke?
No one can say for sure, of course. But the night
before the game, the Cards went to see Woody
Allen's motion picture Everything You Always
Wanted To Know About Sex.
On the other hand: in September, 1971, the
team saw The Big Doll House, which coach Jack
Christiansen says was rated "at least double X." The
next morning the Cards ripped Army, 38-3.
"It was terrible," Christiansen recalls. "I think
everybody got to the point where they were
laughing at it [the movie] ... I don't think there's
any connection between movies and games."
The Friday night movie is a long-established
ritual with Cardinal football teams. Before every
game, the 65 players troop into a theatre to see one
of Hollywood's finest, and then go off to a motel
where they spend the night.
Getting Team Together
"It serves the purpose of getting the team
together," explains student manager Craig Heaps.
"They go to a motel to get their minds off their day
to day problems and onto the game. They go to the
movie so they won't have to sit around and watch
each other grow."
Heaps is the man who selects the movies the
team will see each Friday. He uses a mysterious
process that no one understands, including Craig
Heaps.
"It's mostly just intuitive," he offers. 'The first
thing we do is pick up a paper and see what's
showing close. ... I look for things I think would be
a good movie. I don't pick anything that's
thoroughly and exclusively sex. That isn't what the
coaches want them to see before a game.
"I look for a 'good' movie; by 'good' I mean
something that's entertaining, but not just
entertaining. We saw American Graffiti before the
Penn State game this year. It was entertaining, but it
was good, too. It stayed with you," Heaps said.
He also avoids "think" movies like Last Tango In
Paris or Death In Venice. "They just don't appeal to
me," he observes. "It might appeal to me if I were
taking a girl and could discuss it afterwards . .. but

to keep a player's mind on the movie for too long
after it's over would defeat the purpose."
One of the biggest bombs of recent years —
outside of The Big Doll House was The Last Picture
Show, a "think" movie. "It was just a crummy
movie, and it sort of depressed everyone," Heaps
says."And there were a lot of guys from small
towns who said 'I could go home and see that.' "
One movie that Stanford definitely won't be
seeing anytime soon is Catch-22, which has acquired
a reputation as a jinx among college football teams
since several were upset the morning after viewing
it. "We wont be seeingit this season for sure," Heaps
says, somewhat grimly.
Some teams see movies that are supposed to be
"inspirational" — Patton and Straw Dogs are two
popular choices.
But although Stanford's players watched Straw
Dogs the night before upsetting Michigan 13-12 in
ths 1971 Rose Bowl, and there is some talk of
showing Patton the night before the Southern Cal
game later this month, Heaps doesn't think the
movies produce any noticeable effect in the team's
performance on the field.
'Armchair Psychologists'
"Just armchair psychologists ... the people who
think in those terms rank with the armchair
quarterback who second-guesses coaches Monday
morning," he says scornfully.
"A lot of the players thought Straw Dogs was
too depressing, at least that's what I've heard,"
Heaps adds. He claims that showing Patton in
preparation for the USC game is a "funny
idea.. . you know, the parallel of organized
warfare, that sort of stuff."
The Cards saw Paper Moon before beating San
Jose State last weekend, and hope to see Visions of
Eight (a documentary on the Olympics) next week.
"I do take this somewhat seriously," Heaps says.
"The players have to go to whatever I choose, so I
don't want to get a boring movie. But it's not that
they'll play badly if they see the wrong movie."
Maybe. On the other hand, seeing the right movie
might help. Michigan gave that theory a boost two
weeks ago when the Wolverines spent Friday night
watching movies of the 1972 Rose Bowl, then went
out Saturday and thrashed Stanford 47-10.
Sometimes home movies are the best.

One movie that Stanford definitely won't be
seeing anytime soon is Catch-22, which has acquired
a reputation as a jinx among college football teams
since several were upset the morning after viewing
it. "We wont be seeingit this season for sure," Heaps
says, somewhat grimly.
Some teams see movies that are supposed to be
"inspirational" — Patton and Straw Dogs are two
popular choices.
But although Stanford's players watched Straw
Dogs the night before upsetting Michigan 13-12 in
ths 1971 Rose Bowl, and there is some talk of
showing Patton the night before the Southern Cal
game later this month, Heaps doesn't think the
movies produce any noticeable effect in the team's
performance on the field.
'Armchair Psychologists'
"Just armchair psychologists ... the people who
think in those terms rank with the armchair
quarterback who second-guesses coaches Monday
morning," he says scornfully.
"A lot of the players thought Straw Dogs was
too depressing, at least that's what I've heard,"
Heaps adds. He claims that showing Patton in
preparation for the USC game is a "funny
idea.. . you know, the parallel of organized
warfare, that sort of stuff."
The Cards saw Paper Moon before beating San
Jose State last weekend, and hope to see Visions of
Eight (a documentary on the Olympics) next week.
"I do take this somewhat seriously," Heaps says.
"The players have to go to whatever I choose, so I
don't want to get a boring movie. But it's not that
they'll play badly if they see the wrong movie."
Maybe. On the other hand, seeing the right movie
might help. Michigan gave that theory a boost two
weeks ago when the Wolverines spent Friday night
watching movies of the 1972 Rose Bowl, then went
out Saturday and thrashed Stanford 47-10.
Sometimes home movies are the best.


BOKYLA SAC KED-Quarter back Mike Boryla is sandwiched by two San Jose Stot^defen°ders S bstweek
against the Spartans. Boryla has passed for 524 yards so far this year but has also been caught behind the
line Zb times lor a net loss of 124 yards.
Did you ever wonder what in the world Stanford
football players could have been thinking about last
year when they fumbled three times in a tight 10-6
victory over Duke?
No one can say for sure, of course. But the night
before the game, the Cards went to see Woody
Allen's motion picture Everything You Always
Wanted To Know About Sex.
On the other hand: in September, 1971, the
team saw The Big Doll House, which coach Jack
Christiansen says was rated "at least double X." The
next morning the Cards ripped Army, 38-3.
"It was terrible," Christiansen recalls. "I think
everybody got to the point where they were
laughing at it [the movie] ... I don't think there's
any connection between movies and games."
The Friday night movie is a long-established
ritual with Cardinal football teams. Before every
game, the 65 players troop into a theatre to see one
of Hollywood's finest, and then go off to a motel
where they spend the night.
Getting Team Together
"It serves the purpose of getting the team
together," explains student manager Craig Heaps.
"They go to a motel to get their minds off their day
to day problems and onto the game. They go to the
movie so they won't have to sit around and watch
each other grow."
Heaps is the man who selects the movies the
team will see each Friday. He uses a mysterious
process that no one understands, including Craig
Heaps.
"It's mostly just intuitive," he offers. 'The first
thing we do is pick up a paper and see what's
showing close. ... I look for things I think would be
a good movie. I don't pick anything that's
thoroughly and exclusively sex. That isn't what the
coaches want them to see before a game.
"I look for a 'good' movie; by 'good' I mean
something that's entertaining, but not just
entertaining. We saw American Graffiti before the
Penn State game this year. It was entertaining, but it
was good, too. It stayed with you," Heaps said.
He also avoids "think" movies like Last Tango In
Paris or Death In Venice. "They just don't appeal to
me," he observes. "It might appeal to me if I were
taking a girl and could discuss it afterwards . .. but

to keep a player's mind on the movie for too long
after it's over would defeat the purpose."
One of the biggest bombs of recent years —
outside of The Big Doll House was The Last Picture
Show, a "think" movie. "It was just a crummy
movie, and it sort of depressed everyone," Heaps
says."And there were a lot of guys from small
towns who said 'I could go home and see that.' "

Christiansen says was rated "at least double X." The
next morning the Cards ripped Army, 38-3.
"It was terrible," Christiansen recalls. "I think
everybody got to the point where they were
laughing at it [the movie] ... I don't think there's
any connection between movies and games."
The Friday night movie is a long-established
ritual with Cardinal football teams. Before every
game, the 65 players troop into a theatre to see one
of Hollywood's finest, and then go off to a motel
where they spend the night.
Getting Team Together
"It serves the purpose of getting the team
together," explains student manager Craig Heaps.
"They go to a motel to get their minds off their day
to day problems and onto the game. They go to the
movie so they won't have to sit around and watch
each other grow."
Heaps is the man who selects the movies the
team will see each Friday. He uses a mysterious
process that no one understands, including Craig
Heaps.
"It's mostly just intuitive," he offers. 'The first
thing we do is pick up a paper and see what's
showing close. ... I look for things I think would be
a good movie. I don't pick anything that's
thoroughly and exclusively sex. That isn't what the
coaches want them to see before a game.
"I look for a 'good' movie; by 'good' I mean
something that's entertaining, but not just
entertaining. We saw American Graffiti before the
Penn State game this year. It was entertaining, but it
was good, too. It stayed with you," Heaps said.
He also avoids "think" movies like Last Tango In
Paris or Death In Venice. "They just don't appeal to
me," he observes. "It might appeal to me if I were
taking a girl and could discuss it afterwards . .. but

to keep a player's mind on the movie for too long
after it's over would defeat the purpose."
One of the biggest bombs of recent years —
outside of The Big Doll House was The Last Picture
Show, a "think" movie. "It was just a crummy
movie, and it sort of depressed everyone," Heaps
says."And there were a lot of guys from small
towns who said 'I could go home and see that.' "
One movie that Stanford definitely won't be
seeing anytime soon is Catch-22, which has acquired
a reputation as a jinx among college football teams
since several were upset the morning after viewing
it. "We wont be seeingit this season for sure," Heaps
says, somewhat grimly.
Some teams see movies that are supposed to be
"inspirational" — Patton and Straw Dogs are two
popular choices.
But although Stanford's players watched Straw
Dogs the night before upsetting Michigan 13-12 in
ths 1971 Rose Bowl, and there is some talk of
showing Patton the night before the Southern Cal
game later this month, Heaps doesn't think the
movies produce any noticeable effect in the team's
performance on the field.
'Armchair Psychologists'
"Just armchair psychologists ... the people who
think in those terms rank with the armchair
quarterback who second-guesses coaches Monday
morning," he says scornfully.
"A lot of the players thought Straw Dogs was
too depressing, at least that's what I've heard,"
Heaps adds. He claims that showing Patton in
preparation for the USC game is a "funny
idea.. . you know, the parallel of organized
warfare, that sort of stuff."
The Cards saw Paper Moon before beating San
Jose State last weekend, and hope to see Visions of
Eight (a documentary on the Olympics) next week.
"I do take this somewhat seriously," Heaps says.
"The players have to go to whatever I choose, so I
don't want to get a boring movie. But it's not that
they'll play badly if they see the wrong movie."
Maybe. On the other hand, seeing the right movie
might help. Michigan gave that theory a boost two
weeks ago when the Wolverines spent Friday night
watching movies of the 1972 Rose Bowl, then went
out Saturday and thrashed Stanford 47-10.
Sometimes home movies are the best.
