# Cards Open Season At Fresno Invitational
## Harriers Hope To Survive Gas Shortage 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
The Stanford cross country
team begins its season tomorrow
at the Fresno State Invitational at
Fresno.
Provided, that is, that enough
gas stations remain open in the
southern half of the state to
enable the team to reach its
destination.
"We'll just have to wait and
see," said coach Marshall Clark,
the Cards' distance mentor.
"We're planning to drive down,
but we have to be able to get gas
along the way."
Clark is planning to take along
"as many people as we feel can
run the distance â€” maybe 18-20."
The course at Fresno is six miles
long. It runs through a park over
rolling hills on grass and along dirt
and asphalt roads.
"There will be quite a few

schools there," he continued.
"Fresno State, Nevada, and
Sacramento State are the big ones
we'll have to beat. Westmont
should be strong too. They're a
small school, but they have good
cross country teams." The Cards
will be fielding both varsity and
JV squads for the competition.
Sixth Year
This will be Clark's sixth year
as head coach of the cross country
team and assistant to Pay ton
Jordan on the track team. The
team finished second in the 1968
NCAA cross country
championships his first year here
and through last season Clark has
racked up an outstanding 25-2
dual meet record.
Last year's squad was 6-0 in
dual competition, and soundly
defeated USC, UCLA and
Berkeley in the Pacific Eight

Southern Division meet. The team
managed only fourth in the Pac-8,
however, as three of the northern
squads, led by Washington State,
dominated the race.
Distance running is often
dominated by those with age and
experience, but the majority of
last year's top cross country men
were freshmen. These talented
sophomores should pace the
Cardinal runners in 1973.
"In some ways its kind of
tough on the other guys," said
Clark. "The younger runners feel
there's no room for them. We've
already lost a few freshmen who
decided there was no place for
them on the squad."
Sandoval Leads Sophs
The sophomores are led by
Tony Sandoval. The 5-7, 120
pound standout was a national
junior champion in high school,
and last year ran a 29:15.4
six-mile, good enough to tie him
for second on the Cards' all-time
cross country list.
Other sophomores among the
top 10 returnees form the 1972
squad include Jack Bellah
(30:27), Chris Berka (31:11), Art
Brown (31:42), Doug McLean
(31:54) and Alan Cummings
(32:08). Bruce Wolfe, one of the
Cards' top 880 men last spring, is
another sophomore who should
add strength to the team.
Although most of the team's
depth lies in its sophomores, there
are good runners in the other
classes as well. Junior Mark
McConnell moved to ninth on the
all-time Stanford list with a 29:45
clocking last season. Kurt
Schoenrock ran a 30:27 as well as
being the top steeplechaser on the
track squad. Dave Ingraham
(33:17) will also add to the Cards'
depth.
Impressive Newcomers
Besides the returnees, at least
two newcomers join the team
with impressive credentials from

1972 high school competition.
Steve Crowley was the Central
Coast cross country champion,
and according to Coach Clark
"should improve a lot this year."
Jeff Parietti, another frosh, was
the 1972 Washington State AA
cross country champion.
The squad held time trials last
Saturday on Stanford's grassy 4.2
mile course. Besides the Cards,
Long Beach State, West Valley
and Foothill also ran, along with
several unattached runners.
Stanford would have won the
non-scaring meet if it had been
scored.
Sandoval won the race by
nearly 40 seconds with a 20:09.8
clocking, about 13 seconds slower
than his best of last year.
McConnell and Bellah were fifth
and sixth with times of 20:57 and
21:02 respectively. Crowley was

10th at 21:23.
A block of Stanford runners
took 12th through 15th within
two seconds of each other. J
Cummings and Brown both ran
21:26, a personal best for 1
Cummings. Berka clocked in at
21:27, and Wolfe was timed at
21:28, also a personal best. The !
only other personal best was j
turned in by McLean at 22:05.
The next major meet for the j
squad after Fresno will be i
October 20 at Stanford against j
San Jose, California, West Valley 1
Track Club, and the Santa Barbara j
Athletic Association.
