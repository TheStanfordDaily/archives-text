# Pac-8 Predictions
## 
### 
Four Pacific Eight teams
will begin the race for Roses
and three others will be
scouting possible Big 10
opposition tomorrow as the
Pac-8 swings into its fourth
week of football action.
Washington travels to
California and Oregon State
entertains USC in a pair of
conference openers. Stanford,
Oregon and Washington State,
meanwhile, will be visiting
three unfriendly Big 10
stadiums.
There's not much hope for
the Ducks against Michigan or
the Cougars against Ohio State,
but the Daily predicts a narrow
victory for Stanford at
Memorial Stadium in
Champaign, 111.
Don Reynolds of Oregon,

the league's leading rusher with
391 yards, needs only 39 yards
tomorrow to pass one of
Oregon's most celebrated
alums on the Ducks' career
rushing list. USC coach John
McKay currently ranks 14th on
the all-time Oregon rushing
charts but will probably move
down a notch after this
weekend's action.
The Daily's prognosticator,
who was an impressive 6-1-1
last week (marred only by
USC's tie and Cat's convincing
romp over Army), has issued
the following predictions:
Stanford 27, Illinois 24
USC 35, Oregon State 7
Washington 17, California 13
UCLA 34, Utah 14
Michigan 41, Oregon 7
Ohio State 39, Wash. State 21
