# Stanford Seeks Second Win
## Cards Face Injured Illini 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Stanford's most explosive
offensive player (John
Winesberry) is out for the season
and the Cards' first string free
safety (Doc Blanchard) probably
won't start tomorrow, but Illinois
coach Bob Blackman insists the
Cardinals are in magnificent
physical condition compared to
his Fighting Illini.
"We're definitely hurting,"
Blackman said in a telephone
interview yesterday morning.
"Four starters out of 11 on the
offense are hurt and we have quite
a fewj others who haven't
practiced all week and are kind of
gimpy."
Running backs George
Uremovich and Lonnie Perrin,
tackle Gerry Sullivan and center
Stu Levenick will all be on the
sidelines tomorrow when Illinois
hosts Stanford in a 12:50 p.m.
(PDT) game at Memorial Stadium
in Champaign. The game will be
televised both in the Midwest and
on the Pacific Coast, with
channels 7 and 11 broadcasting
the game live in the Bay Area.
Blackman, who ranks fourth in
total victories among major
college coaches and 10th in
winning percentage (including a
104-37 record at Dartmouth from
1955-70), is especially worried
about the loss of Uremovich, the
team's leading rusher and UPl's
Midwest Back of the Week for his
149-yard performance against Cal
two weeks ago, and Sullivan, a
three-year starter at offensive
tackle.
'Doubly Important'
"The loss of Uremovich has to
hurt," Blackman said, "and
Sullivan is doubly important
because he was the center for
punts, kickoffs and field goals."
Despite the Illinois injuries,
Stanford coach Jack Christiansen
rates the Fighting Illini as
"another strong Big 10 team.
Their defensive ends are quick and
their linebackers active,"
Christiansen said. "On offense
they shift and move around a lot.
They try to get you out of
position by shifting quickly."
Christiansen also
complimented Illinois quarterback
Jeff Hollenbach ("an outstanding
passer"), but Blackman was even
more emphatic in his appraisal of
Card signal-caller Mike Boryla.
"There is no question that Mike
Boryla is the finest passer in the
nation," Blackman said. He failed
to mention, however, that the
Illinois backfield may also be
among the nation's finest, having
intercepted nine passes in three
games so far.
Illinois is 2-1 on the season
with victories over Indiana
(28-14) and California (27-7).
Last week the Fighting Illini lost
17-10 to a West Virginia team
Blackman says "is in the same
class as Penn State."

Stanford, after losing 20-6 to
the Nittany Lions and 47-10
against Michigan, got in win
column last Saturday by defeating
San Jose State 23-12.
In the second half last week,
Stanford finally got its ground
game off the ground, so to speak,
eventually rushing for 73 yards, a
figure that is hardly awesome but
is at least above zero. (The Cards
were held to negative rushing
yardage in their first two games.)
Most critics have credited the
offensive line with Stanford's
impotent ground game.
"One of our alums wrote me to
tell me our offense had no
imagination — I love to get that
fan mail," Christiansen said, "but
until you can block on a dive play
you might as well not run
anything else.
"But I think we're playing
better now, especially in the
offensive line. Remember, we're
playing two freshmen, a
sophomore, a junior and one
senior up there and there are
bound to be mistakes, but I feel
certain we're coming around
now."

Cardinal Notes: Dave Ottmar,
who booted his first punt of the
year 51 yards last week, could
see action at quarterback as well
as punter. Christiansen is taking
Boryla, Ottmar and freshman
Mike Cordova to Illinois and ranks
his quarterbacks in that order.
Fans should watch for a strong
defensive performance from the
Cards in the third quarter
tomorrow. Illinois hasn't scored in
the third period so far this year,
despite impressive outputs of 21,
24 and 20 points in the first,
second and fourth quarters.

Cards in the third quarter
tomorrow. Illinois hasn't scored in
the third period so far this year,
despite impressive outputs of 21,
24 and 20 points in the first,
second and fourth quarters.

OUCH!—San Jose State receiver Ike Mcßee is greeted by Stanford's
Doc Blanchard (29) and an unidentified Cardinal defender. Stanford
won the game, 23-12.
Stanford's most explosive
offensive player (John
Winesberry) is out for the season
and the Cards' first string free
safety (Doc Blanchard) probably
won't start tomorrow, but Illinois
coach Bob Blackman insists the
Cardinals are in magnificent
physical condition compared to
his Fighting Illini.
"We're definitely hurting,"
Blackman said in a telephone
interview yesterday morning.
"Four starters out of 11 on the
offense are hurt and we have quite
a fewj others who haven't
practiced all week and are kind of
gimpy."
Running backs George
Uremovich and Lonnie Perrin,
tackle Gerry Sullivan and center
Stu Levenick will all be on the
sidelines tomorrow when Illinois
hosts Stanford in a 12:50 p.m.
(PDT) game at Memorial Stadium
in Champaign. The game will be
televised both in the Midwest and
on the Pacific Coast, with
channels 7 and 11 broadcasting
the game live in the Bay Area.
Blackman, who ranks fourth in
total victories among major
college coaches and 10th in
winning percentage (including a
104-37 record at Dartmouth from
1955-70), is especially worried
about the loss of Uremovich, the
team's leading rusher and UPl's
Midwest Back of the Week for his
149-yard performance against Cal
two weeks ago, and Sullivan, a
three-year starter at offensive
tackle.
'Doubly Important'
"The loss of Uremovich has to
hurt," Blackman said, "and
Sullivan is doubly important
because he was the center for
punts, kickoffs and field goals."
Despite the Illinois injuries,
Stanford coach Jack Christiansen
rates the Fighting Illini as
"another strong Big 10 team.
Their defensive ends are quick and
their linebackers active,"
Christiansen said. "On offense
they shift and move around a lot.
They try to get you out of
position by shifting quickly."
Christiansen also
complimented Illinois quarterback
Jeff Hollenbach ("an outstanding
passer"), but Blackman was even
more emphatic in his appraisal of
Card signal-caller Mike Boryla.
"There is no question that Mike
Boryla is the finest passer in the
nation," Blackman said. He failed
to mention, however, that the
Illinois backfield may also be
among the nation's finest, having
intercepted nine passes in three
games so far.
Illinois is 2-1 on the season
with victories over Indiana
(28-14) and California (27-7).
Last week the Fighting Illini lost
17-10 to a West Virginia team
Blackman says "is in the same
class as Penn State."

Stanford, after losing 20-6 to
the Nittany Lions and 47-10
against Michigan, got in win
column last Saturday by defeating
San Jose State 23-12.
In the second half last week,
Stanford finally got its ground
game off the ground, so to speak,
eventually rushing for 73 yards, a
figure that is hardly awesome but
is at least above zero. (The Cards
were held to negative rushing
yardage in their first two games.)
Most critics have credited the
offensive line with Stanford's
impotent ground game.
"One of our alums wrote me to
tell me our offense had no
imagination — I love to get that
fan mail," Christiansen said, "but
until you can block on a dive play
you might as well not run
anything else.
"But I think we're playing
better now, especially in the
offensive line. Remember, we're
playing two freshmen, a
sophomore, a junior and one
senior up there and there are
bound to be mistakes, but I feel
certain we're coming around
now."

Cardinal Notes: Dave Ottmar,
who booted his first punt of the
year 51 yards last week, could
see action at quarterback as well
as punter. Christiansen is taking
Boryla, Ottmar and freshman
Mike Cordova to Illinois and ranks
his quarterbacks in that order.
Fans should watch for a strong
defensive performance from the
Cards in the third quarter
tomorrow. Illinois hasn't scored in
the third period so far this year,
despite impressive outputs of 21,
24 and 20 points in the first,

Cardinal Notes: Dave Ottmar,
who booted his first punt of the
year 51 yards last week, could
see action at quarterback as well
as punter. Christiansen is taking
Boryla, Ottmar and freshman
Mike Cordova to Illinois and ranks
his quarterbacks in that order.
Fans should watch for a strong
defensive performance from the
Cards in the third quarter
tomorrow. Illinois hasn't scored in
the third period so far this year,
despite impressive outputs of 21,
24 and 20 points in the first,
second and fourth quarters.

OUCH!—San Jose State receiver Ike Mcßee is greeted by Stanford's
Doc Blanchard (29) and an unidentified Cardinal defender. Stanford
won the game, 23-12.
