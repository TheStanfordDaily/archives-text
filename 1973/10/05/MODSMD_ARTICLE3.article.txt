# Simmons' Departure Sparks Protest
## Lyman Confirms Black Interest 
### BILL ROSS 
Special programs for black students will continue
despite the departure of James Simmons, assistant to the
president for black affairs, President Richard Lyman
affirmed Wednesday.
Lyman responded to complaints from Black Students
Union (BSU) leaders that University concern about black
problems has lessened.
''While there is no likelihood that the office held by
Simmons will be continued in its previous form, this
doesn't imply a diminished concern by the administration
for the problems of blacks," Lyman said in an interview.
"Blacks can make maximum use of Stanford's facilities
only if changes are made in administrative structure. If all
must be retained in its current form, there will be no
progress in the services offered to blacks," Lyman said.
Simmons expressed a similar opinion in a report issued
when he resigned last spring.
Unify Students
"I'm inclined to believe that a start must be made
toward the establishment and recognition of one Stanford
student body and one Stanford faculty-staff," Simmons
wrote. "Now is the time to start.
"Now is not the time to decrease the financial and
human resources available to the University to deal with
continued efforts to incorporate minorities into the full
academic and social life of the University, and help
minorities maintain a 'positive self-image' in a potentially

threatening environment," he said.
The University decided to hire a minority affairs liaison
in the spring of 1968, according to Robert Rosenzweig,
adviser to President Lyman. Simmons arrived in the
autumn of 1968 to serve as "coordinator of intergroup
relations," he said.
At first, Simmons' duties were largely undefined,
Rosenzweig said. A year after his arrival, a special office
was established to advise the president on chicano affairs,
and Simmons' duties became centered entirely on the
black community, according to Rosenzweig.
Special Post
"At first, Simmons helped serve as an intermediary and
troubleshooter between black students and the
administration," Rosenzweig said. "Black enrollment at
Stanford grew rapidly following Simmons' arrival here and
black students felt the need for a special administrative
post to facilitate the development of special black
programs such as Black History Week, the black arts
program and black pre-law and pre-medical advisement."
Yet as the black community developed its own
resources, the need for a liaison became obsolete,
Rosenzweig said.
"Black enrollment at Stanford was approximately 50
in 1968," Rosenzweig said. "Today it is nearly 300.
Blacks no longer need feel threatened by the environment
here. Also, there has been such an increase in black
