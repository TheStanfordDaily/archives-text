# Simmons' Departure Sparks Protest
## Lyman Confirms Black Interest 
### BILL ROSS 
Special programs for black students will continue
despite the departure of James Simmons, assistant to the
president for black affairs, President Richard Lyman
affirmed Wednesday.
Lyman responded to complaints from Black Students
Union (BSU) leaders that University concern about black
problems has lessened.
''While there is no likelihood that the office held by
Simmons will be continued in its previous form, this
doesn't imply a diminished concern by the administration
for the problems of blacks," Lyman said in an interview.
"Blacks can make maximum use of Stanford's facilities
only if changes are made in administrative structure. If all
must be retained in its current form, there will be no
progress in the services offered to blacks," Lyman said.
Simmons expressed a similar opinion in a report issued
when he resigned last spring.
Unify Students
"I'm inclined to believe that a start must be made
toward the establishment and recognition of one Stanford
student body and one Stanford faculty-staff," Simmons
wrote. "Now is the time to start.
"Now is not the time to decrease the financial and
human resources available to the University to deal with
continued efforts to incorporate minorities into the full
academic and social life of the University, and help
minorities maintain a 'positive self-image' in a potentially

threatening environment," he said.
The University decided to hire a minority affairs liaison
in the spring of 1968, according to Robert Rosenzweig,
adviser to President Lyman. Simmons arrived in the
autumn of 1968 to serve as "coordinator of intergroup
relations," he said.
At first, Simmons' duties were largely undefined,
Rosenzweig said. A year after his arrival, a special office
was established to advise the president on chicano affairs,
and Simmons' duties became centered entirely on the
black community, according to Rosenzweig.
Special Post
"At first, Simmons helped serve as an intermediary and
troubleshooter between black students and the
administration," Rosenzweig said. "Black enrollment at
Stanford grew rapidly following Simmons' arrival here and
black students felt the need for a special administrative
post to facilitate the development of special black
programs such as Black History Week, the black arts
program and black pre-law and pre-medical advisement."
Yet as the black community developed its own
resources, the need for a liaison became obsolete,
Rosenzweig said.
"Black enrollment at Stanford was approximately 50
in 1968," Rosenzweig said. "Today it is nearly 300.
Blacks no longer need feel threatened by the environment
here. Also, there has been such an increase in black
oriented programs that we believe they can be conducted
more efficiently in various individualized offices."
Both Lyman and Rosenzweig emphasized that
programs formerly centered in Simmons' office are now
being continued in other parts of the University. For
example, the black advisement program is now conducted
through the office of the dean of student affairs.
More Sensitive
In his report last spring, Simmons wrote, "This year,
there has been a significant decrease in the activities of the
office attributed in part to an increase in other black staff
resources; a black student body less fearful of dealing with
staff who are not black, and perhaps as significant, a
non-black staff and faculty more sensitive and less fearful
of dealing directly with black students and problems and
needs."
Tony Brisco, vice chairman of the BSU, disagrees that
the office has outlived its usefulness.
"We definitely feel that this is a premature phase-out,"
Brisco remarked. "The highest black office on campus has
been wiped away and blacks are left disconnected from
the administration with no liaison to the president."
Brisco said there is no limit to the possibilities for
special black programs, and said that the phase-out would
destroy a major instrument of innovation.

"There is immense room for new directions in black
imporvement," Brisco said. "The refusal of the
administration to appoint a new or interim black affairs
incumbent means that at present there is no avenue for
change."
Brisco said that while black programs have been
transferred to other offices, this change facilitates
administrative manipulation of funds in certain programs.
"Also, the reallocation of black resources has added a
burden to black administrators," he said. "This has
created inefficiency. The administration has made certain
assumptions without knowing the full scope of the
situation."
"We can understand the concerns of black students,"
Lyman responded. "There are ominous signs of a decrease
of civil rights fervor as evidenced by cutbacks in federal
programs for blacks.
"At Stanford, we are not trying to force the melting
pot, but we believe that progress can better be made if
black programs are co-ordinated with the various
University departments," Lyman said.
Final decisions regarding the black affairs program have
not yet been made, he said. The administration and black
leaders will confer later in the autumn to discuss plans for
changes in the structure of black programs management.
