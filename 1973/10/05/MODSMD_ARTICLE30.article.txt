# Sunny Scenes On Saturday Afternoon

### 
In the east and midwest, college football games often mean
blankets, hand warmers, woolen hats and hot chocolate. But last
Saturday at Stanford Stadium, 47,500 fans basked in the sunshine
while watching the Cards and San Jose State.
Stanford won the game, 23-12, and the Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band also scored a convincing victory over San
Jose, taking advantage of the perfect weather conditions to turn in its
finest performance of the season.
The LSJUMB will take a week off while the Cards travel to chilly
Illinois, but Stanford's football and musical squads will return to
Stanford Stadium next week for the UCLA game.
