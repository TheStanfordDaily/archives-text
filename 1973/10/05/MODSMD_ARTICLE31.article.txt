# Nation's Top Teams Entered
## Polomen Face Crucial Tourney 
### CHRIS BAKER 
"This weekend is one of the
most crucial periods of the season
for us," said Stanford water polo
coach Jim Gaughran as he talked
of his teams' chances in the
Northern California Open
tournament.

The tournament, which starts
today at DeAnza and Foothill
Colleges, is a 16-team affair.
California, UC-Irvine and Long
Beach State, the nation's top
three teams, will all be competing.
The Cardinals face DeAnza in
the opening game of the single
elimination tournament this
morning at 11 a.m. at DeAnza. If
victorious, Stanford will play
again at 3 p.m., probably against
Humboldt State.
Gaughran expects the Cards to
survive the opening two rounds
but the major threat to Stanford's
chances would come at 6 p.m. in a
crucial quarterfinal contest against
Long Beach State at Foothill.
"Long Beach State is perhaps

the most important game for us.
If we don't get by Long Beach
then we're out of the
tournament," Gaughran said. "A
victory over Long Beach could
also be important in terms of the
NCAA tournament. We could get
a wild card spot in the NCAA's if
we had beaten Long Beach even if
we don't finish first or second in
the Pac-8."
The semifinals and finals are
scheduled for tomorrow at
DeAnza.
The Cards prepared for the
tournament by defeating Long
Beach City College, 10-6,
Wednesday in a game which at
times bare more likeness to a
practice game than a real contest.

The victory improved Stanford's
record to 4-1.
Long Beach City took an early
3-0 lead in the first quarter by
holding the Card fast break
offense in check. Stanford tied
the score by halftime, however,
on goals by Rick Gebers and Greg
Lointz.
Warden Stars
The Cards got untracked in
the third period with Tom Warden
leading the attack. Warden scored
three times in the period and
Drew McDonald added another
score.
The fourth quarter saw four
Cards contribute to the offense.
Craig Van Zandt, Gebers,
McDonald and Warden all scored
in the final period.
"We played a terrible game,"
Gaughran said afterward. "We let
Long Beach get the momentum
and it's hard for a team to come
back when this happens. It was
also hard for us to play in the old
Encina pool — it's just too narrow
for us. But we can't blame our
play on that."
Stanford's $2.2 million dollar
swimming complex is due to open
on Monday.
