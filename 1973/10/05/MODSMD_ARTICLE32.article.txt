### PETE BHATIA 
Fall intramurals are now in
their first big week of competition
with football, volleyball, golf and
tennis all underway.
In football, the defending
champion Zetes appear to be as
tough as last year. The fraternity
returns virtually all of that
championship team and has added
two players from one of last
year's semi-finalists, the
Over-The-Hill Gang.
They should receive some stiff
competition from some of the
other fraterniteis notably SAE,
Phi Delt, DU and Theta Delts.
There are also some top
independent teams, led by the
Wildmen and Slaughterhouse 7.
Two-player volleyball is also run
in a league format similar to
football. A team must qualify for
the playoffs through regular
league play. This year's top teams
should be Shakey's, JRA, Los
Arcos and Theta Delts.
In contrast to regular six-player
volleyball, the two-player game
doesn't emphasize sheer power.
Passing, dinking, faking and
quickness assume a much more
important role.
There are 145 teams entered in
tennis doubles and your guess is as
good as mine in picking the top
teams. By the way, if you're ever
around the IM office, the guy
with his head in his hands is Ron
Sue, the IM tennis director. Ron's
job is to unravel the maze of
teams.
DU and SAE stand as the early
favorites in the golf tournament.
The DU's have won or been
co-winners in the two-player best
ball tournay for the last two
years. The SAE's have Gene
Littler's nephew Kurt, who could
conceivably win the whole thing
by himself.
