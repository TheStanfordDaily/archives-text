# Card Booters Face Top-Ranked Dons
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Stanford's soccer team ran its
season record to 2-0 Wednesday
by trampling College of Notre
Dame (Belmont) 11-0. Brian
Bershader and Phil Wright led the
scoring binge with two tallies
apiece.
Coach Fred Priddle said the
victory was a "big lift" for his
team and put the Cards in the
right frame of mind for
tomorrow's 1 p.m. game against
the talented University of San
Francisco squad at USF.
USF, coached by Steve
Negesco, was rated as the top
team on the West Coast in a
preseason poll. However, ratings
don't necessarily mean much, as
Stanford proved in its first game,
by defeating the fourth ranked
team on the Coast, San Jose State.
Priddle was quite exuberant
after the Notre Dame game,
although he had predicted an easy

victory. "We controlled the ball
70 to 75 percent of the time," he
said.
Balanced Offense
Bob Geiger, Chico De La
Guardia, Mac Taylor, Jeff Hall,
Walt Harris, Tom Miller and Grant
Heidrick each scored once in
Wednesday's lopsided victory.
Harris, in goal during the first
half, moved to the front line when
the Cards jumped to a 6-0
mid-game lead. Bill Ralston took
over the goalie job in the second
period and perserved the .team's
second shutout in as many games.
Priddle was especially happy
with the way his team controlled
the center of the field. His only
criticism of Stanford's opening
game against San Jose State was
the Cards' mid-field defense. "We
weren't controlling the ball in that
area against the Spartans," he
said.
Passing and Trapping
But after practicing in that area
during the beginning of the week,
the Cards improved to Priddle's
approval. The one-sidedness of the
score allowed the team to polish
up on passing and trapping,
according to Priddle.
Looking ahead to tomorrow's
game, Priddle predicted, "If we
play like we did on Friday night
[against SJS] we won't be
denied."
The game will be played on the
Dons' home field at 1 p.m. The
junior varsity will be looking for
its second victory in the
preliminary game at 11 a.m.
against USF JV's, while the
freshman team will try for its first
win against Vintage High (Napa).
The later game will also be played
in San Francisco.
