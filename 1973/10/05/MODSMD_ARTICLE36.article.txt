Brown Okays New Dope Initiative
SACRAMENTO — A second initiative campaign
to place another marijuana measure on the ballot
was given the green light yesterday by Secretary of
State Edmund G. Brown Jr.
The second initiative is similar to the first one in
permitting personal use of marijuana. It is also
identical to Prop. 19 which was defeated at the polls
in November.
Both must obtain 325,504 valid signatures on
petitions by Dec. 24 in order to qualify for the June
primary. But the second initiative could qualify for
the ballot in November, 1974, by continuing its
signature campaign until Feb. 28, Brown said.
A summary by the attorney general's office says
the second initiative provides that "no person 18
years or older shall be punished criminally or denied
any right or privilege because of his planting,
cultivating, harvesting, drying, processing, otherwise
preparing, transporting, possessing or using
marijuana."
The first initiative contains a similar provision.
But it also allows the governing body of any city or
unincorporated area to prohibit public use of
marijuana, and allows fines of up to $100.
The first initiative specifically states that the sale
or commercial distribution of marijuana would be
illegal.
Vietnam Talks Stop Cold
PARIS — The political talks between the Saigon
government and the Viet Cong were indefinitely
suspended yesterday after Viet Cong State Minister
Nguyen Van Hieu walked out of the 28th session
without waiting for the other side to speak.
Hieu said his walkout marked a protest against
what he termed Saigon's "continuous and flagrant
violation" of the cease-fire signed in Paris more than
eight months ago.
South Vietnamese Deputy Premier Nguyen Luu
Vien said the walkout displayed "a discourteous and
insolent attitude unacceptable among well-educated
people and unacceptable and intolerable among
negotiators seeking a peaceful solution."
Hieu stressed that he was only walking out of the
28th session, and demanded that the stalled
conference should continue Oct. 11 as though
nothing had happened.
Vien angrily rejected the date set by Hieu and
told newsmen the talks would resume only when
the two sides had reached agreement on a date.
Segretti Cohorts Admit Guilt
WASHINGTON - Two admitted political
saboteurs told the Senate Watergate committee
yesterday they tried to disrupt the 1972 Florida

primary campaign of Sen. Edmund S. Muskie and
other Democratic presidential contenders.
Michael Douglas Kelly, 24, of Miami apologized
for dirty tricks which he said ranged from preparing
bogus letters and advertising to paying a girl to run
naked in front of a hotel where the Maine senator
was staying, yelling, "Muskie, I love you."
But Robert M. Benz, 29, yesterday's other
witness, made no apology for his work against
campaigns of Democratic presidential contenders in
the Tampa area. He said he was motivated primarily
by revenge for what he called Democratic dirty
tricks in previous campaigns.
The two Florida Young Republicans, both
accomplices of political trickster Donald H. Segretti,
appeared at the first committee session not televised
live on commercial networks.
Segretti, 32, a California attorney who said he
took his orders from a White House aide, has
pleaded guilty to three federal misdemeanor charges
arising from political sabotage efforts he directed in
the Florida primary.
Galley's Lawyers Appeal
WASHINGTON - Lt. William L. Calley Jr.
believed he was carrying out a legal order at My Lai
and so was guilty of nothing more than an honest
mistake, his lawyers said in court yesterday.
"Lt. Calley harbored no malice," said Army
Lawyer Capt. J. Houston Gordon. "He did not have
the mind of a murderer."
Gordon asked the U.S. Court of Military
Appeals, the final arbiter of American military
courts, to reverse Calley's conviction for murder and
his 20-year sentence at hard labor. No decision from
the three presidentially appointed civilians on the
court is expected for several weeks.
Then the secretary of the Army and President
Nixon will review the decision, Nixon has said he
will look at it personally.
There is some chance that civilian federal courts
might be asked to review the Calley case, but Army
lawyers in the Pentagon said Thursday's hearing is
likely to be the last formal appeal on behalf of the
29-year-old lieutenant.
Calley was convicted March 29, 1971, of
murdering at least 22 Vietnamese civilians and
assault with intent to murder a Vietnamese child.
