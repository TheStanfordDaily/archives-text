# Moscone Blasts Reagan For Mental Health Cuts

### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
Democratic gubernatorial candidate
George Moscone told a Palo Alto
audience last night that the Reagan
administration is at least partially to
blame for a shooting incident in San
Francisco last week that left a KGO
radio sales executive dead.
In a prepared statement issued
earlier in the day, the state Senate
majority leader blamed the incident on
Gov. Ronald Reagan's "policy of
removing patients from state mental
hospitals when it appears they will be
a threat not only to society but to
themselves."
Last night, Moscone told about 55

members of the Palo Alto Democratic
Association and the Los
Altos Mountain View Democratic Club
hat "there should be a great outcry"
over Reagan's veto this week of a bill
that would have required the governor
to seek legislative approval before
closing any state mental hospital.
'Cruel And Tragic'
He said the "cruel and tragic
scenario" — where former mental
patient Lawrence Kwong, 25,
attempted to shoot radio personality
Jim Dunbar, then shot and killed KGO
executive Ben Munson and committed
suicide — was an example of Reagan's
"failure to keep programs for

treatment of the mentally ill at an
adequate level."
Moscone reaffirmed his opposition
to the death penalty, noting that
Kwong "was not going to be stopped
by any death penalty." He promised
that the state would be "a lot safer" if
he is elected.
Although six other Democrats are
running for the gubernatorial
nomination, Moscone reserved most of
his verbal barbs for the Republican
Reagan, who has said he won't run for
re-election. The San Franciscan
accused the governor of putting "false
impressions" in the minds of voters
concerning the death penalty, taxation
and other issues.
'Eliminate Tuition'
During a wide-ranging
question-and-answer session, Moscone
also said he favored the elimination of
tuition at the University of California,
which was enacted during Reagan's
first term.
Tuition, he said, "is in my view
punitive in scope. I think that as it
loses political value, it can be
rescinded."
Moscone claimed his campaign is
"summoning progressive Democrats
out of the closets," and urged voters
not to "sit on their hands .. . and let
another Ronald Reagan, Democratic
or Republican, be elected."
Tax Plan Opposed
Moscone, who noted that for the
second straight year he had "led the
league" in sponsoring bills vetoed by
the governor, also spoke out against
Reagan's controversial tax initiative.
He said that although polls show
the plan, Prop. 1 on the upcoming
Nov. 6 ballot, leading by only a
narrow margin, "I think at this
moment [it] is winning handily."
Moscone also reiterated his support
for decriminalization of marijuana,
although he stressed that "there's a
great deal of difference between
decriminalization and legalization."
And, he predicted, "we're not too
faraway" from decriminalization.
