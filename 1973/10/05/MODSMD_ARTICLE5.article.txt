# Rabbi Familant Directs University Jews
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Tonight at sunset Jewish people
throughout the world will begin the
observance of Yom Kippur, the Day of
Atonement. Running through
tomorrow evening, this quite solemn
holiday is marked by fasting, prayer
and repetence.
The Stanford Jewish community
will observe Yom Kippur with both
traditional and contemporary services
this evening and tomorrow, as it did
last Wednesday and Thursday for Rosh
Hashana, the Jewish New Year.
Behind all this, in a position which
best can be described as the
"professional Jew on campus" is
Rabbi Charles Familant. Working out
of his tiny office in the basement of
The Clubhouse, Familant represents
the nucleus of Stanford's Jewish
community.
Familant, 41, views his job
realistically. "I don't represent all the
Jewish students, and I don't want to
be their echo, but I am a voice,
vis-a-vis the university. When it comes
to getting things done, such as courses
of Jewish interest, they listen."
Lengthy Study
Familant, who is beginning his
eighth year here, was the first rabbi to
represent the Jewish students at

Stanford. This is the only position he
has held as a rabbi, after a lengthy
education which included studying in
Europe and Israel.
The rabbi traditionally has been a
teacher. Familant views his role as a
counselor, spiritual leader and
educator. There is no hierarchy in the
rabbinate, as in other ministries.
Familant received his Bachelor of
Arts degree from the University of
Pennsylvania, where he majored in
sociology and philosophy. His
graduate work began at Hebrew Union
College in Cincinatti, where he
extended a normal five-year
pre-rabbinic program to six in order to
spend an extra year in Israel. After
being ordained as a rabbi, Familant
received a fellowship to study at
Oxford, where he concentrated on
analytic philosophy.
Familant said he was quite pleased
when he learned that a position at
Stanford was available. He applied and
was chosen from a large field of
applicants.
Campus Move
When he arrived here, however, he
found his office to be in Palo Alto,
above a tire store and more than two
miles from campus. He found this
set-up quite undesirable and

immediately began his move to get on
campus.
Familant says a major obstacle lay
in the founding charter of Mrs.Leland
Stanford. The Charter forbade any
religious services outside of Memorial
Church. Familant considered the
option of holding services there, but
found the surroundings unacceptable.
The rabbi was not alone at the time
in his fight for being on campus. Other
clergymen also thought they should be
allowed office space, as representatives
of their various sects. Together they
approached the Board of Trustees,
who reinterpreted the Founding
Charter.
The first official on-campus
Sabbath services were held in May,
1966, although Familant admits that
small "illegal" services had been held
previously. In September the Rabbi
received office space in The
Clubhouse, from where he serves the
Jewish community.
Familant, who is married and has
three children, says he enjoys his
personal freedom that he would not
have serving a congregation. "I don't
have to worry about politics with the
board [of directors]," he said. "I
really didn't want to fight middle class
congregational values that I couldn't
accept."

However, he is not satisfied with
the amount of Jewish studies available
here. There are a few pertinent courses
in the Religious Studies department
and two courses in both Hebrew and
Yiddish, plus a class concerning Jewish
mysticism, given by Familant himself.
In order to get any more Jewish
studies on campus, the students must
show a need and a desire, according to
Familant. Then he and others could
attempt to get substantial
contributions from members of the
community, specifically for Jewish
studies.
"Interest has increased somewhat,"
Familant said, but he feels there is still
quite a way to go. Hillel and Jewish
Students of Stanford University
(JSSU) events have also attracted
many more students. Because of this,
JSSU received this summer a $3100
grant from the Jewish Welfare
Federation.
More Celebrations
Hillel is involved with putting on
the High Holiday services and if
interest remains at a high level,
celebrations for other Jewish festivals
should be a reality, Familant said.
Students are planning to build a
Sukkah (booth) in White Plaza next
week for the holiday of the same name
that celebrates the harvest of crops.
