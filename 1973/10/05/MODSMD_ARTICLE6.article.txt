## Venceremos In Retrospect 
### 
The demise of Venceremos, first reported in
these pages last week, marks the passing from the
Stanford political scene of an organization whose
impact and influence were, to say the least,
profound. Few — even on the Left — will mourn.
The communist revolutionary group was among
the prime movers in the leftist upheavals here from
1969 to the fading of the antiwar movement in
1972. It is surprising, now, to reflect how short its
history really was.
The dissolution came only after a long period of
slow disintegration. Formed in December, 1970,
from a faction of the Bay Area Revolutionary
Union, Venceremos had already split once — in
summer, 1971 — and was no longer active on
campus. The end came in the midst of the internal
disputes over the basic character of the
organization; but those had been preceded by many
setbacks, including the firing of Assoc. English Prof.
H* Bruce Franklin and the prosecution and
conviction of Benton and Andrea Holman Burt.
It is difficult to eulogize Venceremos.
Anti-liberal from the beginning, it moved beyond
mere intolerance to a reliance on physical
intimidation and occasional terrorism to stifle
apposing viewpoints. It deliberately staged street
lights with police, and may have been behind any
of bombings. Systematic window-breaking
|SrJ"trashing," in the parlance of the time — became
jt9 favorite tactic in demonstrations, and never mind
that the tactic's usefulness was always unclear.
Tlie group held a single-minded devotion to the
principle of armed struggle; Mao's aphorism that
"All political power grows out of the barrel of a
gun" was its catchword. Indeed, its praxis was based
so much on the Nietzschean notion that "practice is
primary" that apparent ideological inconsistencies
cropped up. In the 1972 efforts to unionize
University employees, for example, Venceremos
first worked closely with, and later openly
supported, the Teamsters Union — hardly a
revolutionary organization. Its theory, in short, was
weak.

Ironically, the group was always suspected by
police of far more crimes and heinous acts than it
could plausibly have committed. A peculiar form of
'revolutionary egotism' may have been a
contributing factor: Venceremos leaders had a
tendency to applaud almost any terrorist action, a
policy that may have alienated as many followers
and potential supporters as it attracted prosecutors.
Venceremos' willingness to act never quite matched
its inflammatory rhetoric — although it came close
enough for discomfort.
Nevertheless, Venceremos played a major role in
the political evolution and education of the
Stanford community - if only by example.
Its militant efforts against the Indochina war -
which it saw as part of an essentially imperialist
American policy maintained by a
military-industrial-academic complex of which the
University was an integral part - revealed much
about the realities of our involvement in Southeast
Asia.
The University's reaction to Venceremos' tactics
— the creation of a whole apparatus of police,
photographers, videotapes, and judicial machinery
that is with us still - chipped away at the old image
of a wise, temperate, and liberal academy. The
treatment accorded to faculty members who
associated with Venceremos — by their colleagues
who claimed to uphold the sanctity of the 'free
exchange of ideas' — was illiberal at best. And the
fact that, after direct and protracted attack from
Venceremos, the University still stands and is as
secure as ever serves as testimony that this great
institution may not be as fragile a flower as it
claimed when it threw all those Venceremos
members out on their ear.
The organization has disbanded; but its members
remain committed to their causes, and will
apparently continue to work in various radical
groups in the Bay Area. If the dissolution reflects
the members' rejection of a dogmatism that proved
untenable, Venceremos' loss may be the larger left's
gain. So much the better for us all .
