## Women: Numerator Or Denominator?

The columnistic dream has
been realized. I received positive
proof that someone read my
column, not only read it, but was
so stimulated by the blatant and
prejudiced nature of the opinions
as to send me an angry letter. It is
these small tokens which
compensate the columnist.
Christina Hutson's letter
(reproduced on this page) scores
admirably. Much as I appreciate
her marksmanship I must note
that I was set up, by my editor.

An ordinarily gentle person,
I'm certain my editor intended
my precarious reputation no harm
when she omitted the last half of
my Tuesday column due to space
limitations. Unfortunately my
feeble representation of the
female side and some few shreds
of evidence were embedded in the
doomed portion.
I submit it as exhibit A in my
behalf.
With that reservation aside, I
plead guilty. I do indeed have a
most pronounced male bias, and
confess I often do not understand
the female perspective. Being a
well-meaning liberal I do my best
to dilute my prejudices with
generally muddled results.
Nevertheless defenders of the
feminine viewpoint are urged to
castigate me. Better yet, write a
column.
Following is the deleted half of
Tuesday's article. This is offered
partly in the community interest
but mainly because my roommate
made me throw away the column
on room decorating I was working
on last night by threatening to be
sick.
Another Side
There is, however, another side
to this issue. If you're a male try
talking about this column to the

next girl you see, if you're a
female you already know the other
side.
Most Stanford girls agree that
this talk of The Ratio is a male
smokescreen behind which basic
cowardice is hidden. Stanford
females point out that all over
Wilbur there are girls sitting in
their mysterious second floor
rooms night after night. Stanford
guys, many explain, simply do not
try with sufficient determination.
To be a female at Stanford,
certain females at Stanford
contend, is not to be in social
heaven.
This assertion strikes at the
very foundations of the
self-esteem of some Stanford
males and is likely to be resisted
with considerable enerev.
Second Floor Dilemma l
There is no doubt much more
could be said concerning the
female viewpoint in this blatently
one-sided column. But most
discussions grind to a halt with
this assertion of the second floor
dilemma.
Have no fear. You have
not been led willy nilly to this
point only to be abandoned in a
subjective wilderness. In the best
tradition of this citadel of the
Social Scientist this columnist has
taken a survey.
Confessedly these statistics
could not be slipped by a
psychology professor and would
not even be considered a good
effort in Statistics I. But since this
is a humor column and you are
not likely to believe any figures
produced the manner of their
collection seems irrelevent.
A freshman and a fourclass
dorm in Wilbur were sampled. The
freshmen dorm was having a party
attended by 62 males and 20
females during the four minute
period counting was underway.
Hie largest conversational group
at the party was composed of five
males and one female.
Three To Seven
Meanwhile, upstairs, there were
three females willing to answer
the door and, on the third floor,

seven males. One of the girls
requested not to be counted since
she was sick and would have been
out otherwise, I ignored this
request. Another was washing her
hair. Three of the seven males
were studying, the others were
either talking with someone
(non-female) or staring blankly at
the wall.
It should be remembered that
there was another floor of males
not actually surveyed.
Certain sex differences tended
to emerge in collecting this data.
Males apparently feel it is
completely unremarkable that a
stranger should knock on their
door, explain he is taking a survey
to see who is in their rooms, then
walk on down the hall. I assume
this to be the case since only one
of the aforementioned males
questioned the process.
Suspicious
Females, on the other hand,
tended to be highly suspicious of
my inquisitive presence. Each of
them required an explanation.
This I supplied, blushing faintly.
Not wanting to place all the
statistical eggs in one basket a
second dorm was surveyed. In this
dorm four females were
discovered on the second floor,
and eight males on the third. It

was necessary to alter the method
of counting on this dorm and
consider an all male group of six
in one room as being in their
rooms, otherwise the data would
not have adequately supported
the theory.
With this in mind the number
of people in the dorm lounge was
also tallied: ten male, one female.
Some might say this data tends
to support the thesis that a greater
percentage of males sit around in
their rooms on Saturday night
than do females. The data could
also conceivably support the
theory that more males go to
Stanford parties than females.
Try TTie Library!
I will not impose an
interpretation but leave the task
to the reader's imagination and
the drift of this column.
One ingenious interpretation of
the data I received from two
females was that all the girls were
at the library. This thesis received
considerable support from a
certain male at the table as he
explained enthusiastically that he
had spent a pleasant half hour
Saturday night wandering about
the library staring at girls.
TTie Ratio may be in the
process of becoming an historical
oddity. I am informed, by a friend
who has given me no previous
reason to believe him, that the
freshman class has nearly a
fifty-fifty ratio. If this is indeed

the case we can expect a gradual
decline of the cult of The Ratio,
for a movement must be fed on
something more than the
melancholy fumes of its own
dissatisfaction. However, people
being consistant, I would expect
some modification of TTie
Stanford Girl Theory to emerge as
the dominant orthodoxy. After
all, there must be some reason we
don't all have dates, musn't there?
