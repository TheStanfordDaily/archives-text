# Israeli Jets Attack Port Said; Egyptians Claim Civilians Hurt
## 
### Associated Press 
Egypt said Israeli jets bombed Port
Said at the Mediterranean entrance to
the Suez Canal last night, inflicting
civilian casualties in the first attack on
a major city in Egypt since the new
Middle East war began.
The Israeli military command said
its aircraft attacked near the city

throughout the day and that the
targets were missile batteries and
military installations.
"The batteries were damaged and
put out of use and the installations
were heavily damaged," an Israeli
communique said.
Egyptian military communiques
also said Egyptian troops attacked

Israeli-held oil fields in the southern
part of the Sinai Peninsula and
"liberated" from the Israelis El
Qantara, a city on the eastern edge of
the central sector of the 103-mile Suez
Canal.
The Israelis seized the city in the
1967 Arab-Israeli war.
There was no immediate reaction

from the Israelis on these claims and
they could not be verified through
independent sources.
No Ruling From U.N.
Meanwhile, a special session of the
Security Council on the new Middle
East war adjourned without decision
last night after the United States split
with the Soviet Union and China on
how to stop the fighting.
U.S. Ambassador John A. Scali
asked Israel, Egypt and Syria to halt
military operations and "return to the
positions before hostilities broke out."
Urging against debate on who is to
blame for the new war, he said this
would be "the least damaging way" to
move from confrontation to
negotiation.
China Defends Arabs
But China, one of the five members
of the council with the right of veto,
said: "If the council is to adopt any
resolution at all, it must condemn all
acts of aggression by the Israeli
Zionists and demand the immediate
withdrawal by the Israeli Zionists from
all the Arab territory they occupied."
Chinese Ambassador Huang Hua
branded as "preposterous" Scali's
proposal that Egypt and Syria return
to their positions before the outbreak
of fighting on Saturday.
Threatening a possible veto,
Ambassador Jacob Malik of the Soviet
Union said, "Without a clearcut
statement on the part of Israel of its
readiness to withdraw all of its troops
from occupied territories, the Security
Council cannot take any decision in
the present circumstances."
'67 War Unresolved
Unless the issue of Israeli
occupation of Arab lands taken in the
1967 Middle East war is resolved,
Malik added, any Security Council
resoltuion "would be exploited by the
aggressor to continue its occupation
and appropriation of the lands of
others." .. .

U.S. Secretary of State Henry A.

Union to act responsibly in the Middle
East. He said detente could fly apart

Kissinger touched briefly on that

last night after the United States split
with the Soviet Union and China on
how to stop the fighting.
U.S. Ambassador John A. Scali
asked Israel, Egypt and Syria to halt
military operations and "return to the
positions before hostilities broke out."
Urging against debate on who is to
blame for the new war, he said this
would be "the least damaging way" to
move from confrontation to
negotiation.
China Defends Arabs
But China, one of the five members
of the council with the right of veto,
said: "If the council is to adopt any
resolution at all, it must condemn all
acts of aggression by the Israeli
Zionists and demand the immediate
withdrawal by the Israeli Zionists from
all the Arab territory they occupied."
Chinese Ambassador Huang Hua
branded as "preposterous" Scali's
proposal that Egypt and Syria return
to their positions before the outbreak
of fighting on Saturday.
Threatening a possible veto,
Ambassador Jacob Malik of the Soviet
Union said, "Without a clearcut
statement on the part of Israel of its
readiness to withdraw all of its troops
from occupied territories, the Security
Council cannot take any decision in
the present circumstances."
'67 War Unresolved
Unless the issue of Israeli
occupation of Arab lands taken in the
1967 Middle East war is resolved,
Malik added, any Security Council
resoltuion "would be exploited by the
aggressor to continue its occupation
and appropriation of the lands of
others." .. .

BIRTH OF COMEDY — Harvard Classics Prof. Erich Segal addressed about 225
persons at Annenberg Auditorium on "The Birth of Comedy." He noted that
comedy has its roots in primitive orgiastic celebrations.
China praised Egypt and Syria as
having "broken through the situation
of no war, no peace maintained by the
superpowers" in what Huang Hua
called a new awakening of the Arab
countries and Palestinian people."
Kissinger Raps Soviets
U.S. Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger last night urged the Soviet
Union to act responsibly in the Middle
East. He said detente could fly apart
otherwise.
Speaking at the end of a long day
devoted to Middle East diplomacy,
Kissinger touched briefly on that
troubled area of the world, but his
remarks were pointed.

"We shall resist aggressive foreign
policies," he said. "Detente cannot
survive irresponsibility in any area,
including the Middle East."
Nixon Readies Proposal
President Nixon, after exchanging
private messages with Soviet leader
Leonid I. Brezhnev about the Middle
EAst conflict, said yesterday the
United States was preparing a
diplomatic proposal that "we hope
and believe will be effective in
stopping the fighting."
The President and Brezhnev
exchanged personal messages Sunday
through diplomatic channels, White
House Press Secretary Ronald L.
Ziegler announced.
Egypt said Israeli jets bombed Port
Said at the Mediterranean entrance to
the Suez Canal last night, inflicting
civilian casualties in the first attack on
a major city in Egypt since the new
Middle East war began.
The Israeli military command said
its aircraft attacked near the city

throughout the day and that the
targets were missile batteries and
military installations.
"The batteries were damaged and
put out of use and the installations
were heavily damaged," an Israeli
communique said.
Egyptian military communiques
also said Egyptian troops attacked

Israeli-held oil fields in the southern
part of the Sinai Peninsula and
"liberated" from the Israelis El
Qantara, a city on the eastern edge of
the central sector of the 103-mile Suez
Canal.
The Israelis seized the city in the
1967 Arab-Israeli war.
There was no immediate reaction

from the Israelis on these claims and
they could not be verified through
independent sources.
No Ruling From U.N.
Meanwhile, a special session of the
Security Council on the new Middle
East war adjourned without decision
last night after the United States split
