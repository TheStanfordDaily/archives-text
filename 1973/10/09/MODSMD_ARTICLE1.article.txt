# Israeli Jets Attack Port Said; Egyptians Claim Civilians Hurt
## 
### Associated Press 
Egypt said Israeli jets bombed Port
Said at the Mediterranean entrance to
the Suez Canal last night, inflicting
civilian casualties in the first attack on
a major city in Egypt since the new
Middle East war began.
The Israeli military command said
its aircraft attacked near the city

throughout the day and that the
targets were missile batteries and
military installations.
"The batteries were damaged and
put out of use and the installations
were heavily damaged," an Israeli
communique said.
Egyptian military communiques
also said Egyptian troops attacked

Israeli-held oil fields in the southern
part of the Sinai Peninsula and
"liberated" from the Israelis El
Qantara, a city on the eastern edge of
the central sector of the 103-mile Suez
Canal.
The Israelis seized the city in the
1967 Arab-Israeli war.
There was no immediate reaction

from the Israelis on these claims and
they could not be verified through
independent sources.
No Ruling From U.N.
Meanwhile, a special session of the
Security Council on the new Middle
East war adjourned without decision
last night after the United States split
with the Soviet Union and China on
how to stop the fighting.
U.S. Ambassador John A. Scali
asked Israel, Egypt and Syria to halt
military operations and "return to the
positions before hostilities broke out."
Urging against debate on who is to
blame for the new war, he said this
would be "the least damaging way" to
move from confrontation to
negotiation.
China Defends Arabs
But China, one of the five members
of the council with the right of veto,
said: "If the council is to adopt any
resolution at all, it must condemn all
acts of aggression by the Israeli
Zionists and demand the immediate
withdrawal by the Israeli Zionists from
all the Arab territory they occupied."
Chinese Ambassador Huang Hua
branded as "preposterous" Scali's
proposal that Egypt and Syria return
to their positions before the outbreak
of fighting on Saturday.
Threatening a possible veto,
Ambassador Jacob Malik of the Soviet
Union said, "Without a clearcut
statement on the part of Israel of its
readiness to withdraw all of its troops
from occupied territories, the Security
Council cannot take any decision in
the present circumstances."
'67 War Unresolved
Unless the issue of Israeli
occupation of Arab lands taken in the
1967 Middle East war is resolved,
Malik added, any Security Council
resoltuion "would be exploited by the
aggressor to continue its occupation
and appropriation of the lands of
others." .. .
