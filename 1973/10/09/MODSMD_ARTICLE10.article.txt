Pleased With KZSU
Editor:
I am sorry that Mr. Hazeghi
(Daily, Oct. 3) does not find the
programming of KZSU to his
taste. I have been very glad that I
get good reception at my home (5

miles from campus) because it is
one of the few FM stations that I
take time to listen to. Not for the
music so much as the unique
broadcasts of campus events,
occasional classes of unusual
interest, interviews with
important campus figures (such as
President Lyman) and visiting
lecturers (such as the Tuesday
Evening series).
During the days of intense
political activity on campus with
sit-ins and confrontations KZSU
was remarkable in its live coverage
of happenings of concern to the
Stanford (and larger) community.
Many people in this area are
interested in Stanford affairs and
can keep abreast by means of
KZSU. I do not feel that the
modest power increase request is

at all unreasonable, and hope that
the FCC acts favorably on their
application.

Yes On C-15
Editor:
In discussion around campus
and in the Daily articles of the
past week much has been said of
the advantages and disadvantages
of the new C-15 proposal for a
Stanford Judicial Council. But
even the proponents recognize
that the proposal is not a perfect
one. It is the result of two years
of hard work and bargaining of
three different constituencies. As
a result it is not entirely
satisfactory to any one group.
There are problems and
loop-holes, but any system will
have these.
It can only work if there is
some compromise and trust
involved, above and beyond the
letter of the Charter. Also it
should be stressed that C-15 acts
only on instructions from the
constituencies. Last year the
students in an election
overwhelmingly asked the C-15 to
examine the system with an eye
to bringing about a student
majority on the judicial panel.
Hiey have achieved this difficult
task. Opponents stress that the
new proposal does not completely
protect student rights,
confidentiality of proceedings, and
on and on.
C-15 was never asked to

examine these aspects, and so
there is little change in these
sections. To revise the entire
charter in one year is just too big
a job. The new proposal should be
accepted as a big first step to a
fair system. The problems of this
proposal and others in the future
will best be resolved if there is
confidence that the system can
work and some trust between the
groups involved.
Indeed the passage of this
proposal has taken on a larger
dimension than just a judicial
system. It is a sign of a new
beginning for constructive
interaction between students,
faculty and administration. Let's
leave the era of continuing
confrontation and deadlock
behind. Vote "Yes" on the C-15
proposal.

Meredi Wheeler's column
[Daily Oct. 8] contained several
errors of reasoning and of fact.
1. Wheeler contends that there
is a radical dichotomy between
broadcasting and publishing
because, she says, the airwaves are
a limited resource, unlike ink and
newsprint. Not so. In fact ink and
newsprint and land and printing
presses, like airwave frequencies,
are all scarce factors of
production; they are limited in
supply. In terms of economic
analysis, all such resources are
scarce.
2. Wheeler points out that the
airwaves are at present
government-owned. True. But just
because government officials
(specifically, in this case,
Secretary of Commerce Herbert
Hoover in the 19205) have seized
control of something, it does not
mean that continued government
control is either necessary or
desirable.
3. An implication of Wheeler's
presentation is that allocation and
control of airwave frequencies by
a government regulatory
commission is necessary because
of the technical nature of the
electro-magnetic spectrum. Again
not so. In the 19205, the courts
were developing a legal structure
of rights in the electro-magnetic
spectrum based on the first-user,
first-owner principle, analogous to
homesteading as a basis of land
ownership. Furthermore, an
artide in the June 1969 Stanford Law
Review, written by lawyers,
economists, and engineers, affirms
the present-day feasibility of
ending Federal Communications
Commission control of
broadcasting.
4. Wheeler's analysis
subordinates individual rights to
"the public interest" (a vague
touchstone) and the successful
operation of the American
political system. On the contrary,
human rights must be upheld
whether or not standing by them
threatens the American
government. There are no
communist, fascist, anarchist, or
Black Muslim television stations
because the government controls
broadcasting, whereas newspapers
representing these viewpoints do
exist. The needed remedy is an
end to government broadcast
licenses and a reinvigoration of
the First Amendment.

that the proposal is not a perfect
one. It is the result of two years
of hard work and bargaining of
three different constituencies. As
a result it is not entirely
satisfactory to any one group.
There are problems and
loop-holes, but any system will
have these.
It can only work if there is
some compromise and trust
involved, above and beyond the
letter of the Charter. Also it
should be stressed that C-15 acts
only on instructions from the
constituencies. Last year the
students in an election
overwhelmingly asked the C-15 to
examine the system with an eye
to bringing about a student
majority on the judicial panel.
Hiey have achieved this difficult
task. Opponents stress that the
new proposal does not completely
protect student rights,
confidentiality of proceedings, and
on and on.
C-15 was never asked to

examine these aspects, and so
there is little change in these
sections. To revise the entire
charter in one year is just too big
a job. The new proposal should be
accepted as a big first step to a
fair system. The problems of this
proposal and others in the future
will best be resolved if there is
confidence that the system can
work and some trust between the
groups involved.
Indeed the passage of this
proposal has taken on a larger
dimension than just a judicial
system. It is a sign of a new
beginning for constructive
interaction between students,
faculty and administration. Let's
leave the era of continuing
confrontation and deadlock
behind. Vote "Yes" on the C-15

Meredi Wheeler's column
[Daily Oct. 8] contained several
errors of reasoning and of fact.
1. Wheeler contends that there
is a radical dichotomy between
broadcasting and publishing
because, she says, the airwaves are
a limited resource, unlike ink and
newsprint. Not so. In fact ink and
newsprint and land and printing
presses, like airwave frequencies,
are all scarce factors of
production; they are limited in
supply. In terms of economic
analysis, all such resources are
scarce.
2. Wheeler points out that the
airwaves are at present
government-owned. True. But just
because government officials
(specifically, in this case,
Secretary of Commerce Herbert
Hoover in the 19205) have seized
control of something, it does not
mean that continued government
control is either necessary or
desirable.
3. An implication of Wheeler's
presentation is that allocation and
control of airwave frequencies by
a government regulatory
commission is necessary because
of the technical nature of the
electro-magnetic spectrum. Again
not so. In the 19205, the courts
were developing a legal structure
of rights in the electro-magnetic
spectrum based on the first-user,
first-owner principle, analogous to
homesteading as a basis of land
ownership. Furthermore, an
artide in the June 1969 Stanford Law
Review, written by lawyers,
economists, and engineers, affirms
the present-day feasibility of
ending Federal Communications
Commission control of
broadcasting.
4. Wheeler's analysis
subordinates individual rights to
"the public interest" (a vague
touchstone) and the successful
operation of the American
political system. On the contrary,
human rights must be upheld
whether or not standing by them
threatens the American
government. There are no
communist, fascist, anarchist, or
Black Muslim television stations
because the government controls
broadcasting, whereas newspapers
representing these viewpoints do
exist. The needed remedy is an
end to government broadcast
licenses and a reinvigoration of
the First Amendment.

I am sorry that Mr. Hazeghi

programming of KZSU to his

get good reception at my home (5

miles from campus) because it is
one of the few FM stations that I
take time to listen to. Not for the
music so much as the unique
broadcasts of campus events,
occasional classes of unusual
interest, interviews with
important campus figures (such as
President Lyman) and visiting
lecturers (such as the Tuesday
Evening series).
During the days of intense
political activity on campus with
sit-ins and confrontations KZSU
was remarkable in its live coverage
of happenings of concern to the
Stanford (and larger) community.
Many people in this area are
interested in Stanford affairs and
can keep abreast by means of
KZSU. I do not feel that the
modest power increase request is

at all unreasonable, and hope that
the FCC acts favorably on their

Meredi Wheeler's column
[Daily Oct. 8] contained several
errors of reasoning and of fact.
1. Wheeler contends that there
is a radical dichotomy between
broadcasting and publishing
because, she says, the airwaves are
a limited resource, unlike ink and
newsprint. Not so. In fact ink and
newsprint and land and printing
presses, like airwave frequencies,
are all scarce factors of
production; they are limited in
supply. In terms of economic
analysis, all such resources are
scarce.
2. Wheeler points out that the
airwaves are at present
government-owned. True. But just
because government officials
(specifically, in this case,
Secretary of Commerce Herbert
Hoover in the 19205) have seized
control of something, it does not
mean that continued government
control is either necessary or
desirable.
3. An implication of Wheeler's
presentation is that allocation and
control of airwave frequencies by
a government regulatory
commission is necessary because
of the technical nature of the
electro-magnetic spectrum. Again
not so. In the 19205, the courts
were developing a legal structure
of rights in the electro-magnetic
spectrum based on the first-user,
first-owner principle, analogous to
homesteading as a basis of land
ownership. Furthermore, an
artide in the June 1969 Stanford Law
Review, written by lawyers,
economists, and engineers, affirms
the present-day feasibility of
ending Federal Communications
Commission control of
broadcasting.
4. Wheeler's analysis
subordinates individual rights to
"the public interest" (a vague
touchstone) and the successful
operation of the American
political system. On the contrary,
human rights must be upheld
whether or not standing by them
threatens the American
government. There are no
communist, fascist, anarchist, or
Black Muslim television stations
because the government controls
broadcasting, whereas newspapers
representing these viewpoints do
exist. The needed remedy is an
end to government broadcast
licenses and a reinvigoration of
the First Amendment.

Pleased With KZSU
Editor:
I am sorry that Mr. Hazeghi
(Daily, Oct. 3) does not find the
programming of KZSU to his
taste. I have been very glad that I
get good reception at my home (5

miles from campus) because it is
one of the few FM stations that I
take time to listen to. Not for the
music so much as the unique
broadcasts of campus events,
occasional classes of unusual
interest, interviews with
important campus figures (such as
President Lyman) and visiting
lecturers (such as the Tuesday
Evening series).
During the days of intense
political activity on campus with
sit-ins and confrontations KZSU
was remarkable in its live coverage
of happenings of concern to the
Stanford (and larger) community.
Many people in this area are
interested in Stanford affairs and
can keep abreast by means of
KZSU. I do not feel that the
modest power increase request is

at all unreasonable, and hope that
the FCC acts favorably on their
application.

Yes On C-15
Editor:
In discussion around campus
and in the Daily articles of the
past week much has been said of
the advantages and disadvantages
of the new C-15 proposal for a
Stanford Judicial Council. But
even the proponents recognize
that the proposal is not a perfect
one. It is the result of two years
of hard work and bargaining of
three different constituencies. As
a result it is not entirely
satisfactory to any one group.
There are problems and
loop-holes, but any system will
have these.
It can only work if there is
some compromise and trust
involved, above and beyond the
letter of the Charter. Also it
should be stressed that C-15 acts
only on instructions from the
constituencies. Last year the
students in an election
overwhelmingly asked the C-15 to
examine the system with an eye
to bringing about a student
majority on the judicial panel.
Hiey have achieved this difficult
task. Opponents stress that the
new proposal does not completely
protect student rights,
confidentiality of proceedings, and
on and on.
C-15 was never asked to

examine these aspects, and so
there is little change in these
sections. To revise the entire
charter in one year is just too big
a job. The new proposal should be
accepted as a big first step to a
fair system. The problems of this
proposal and others in the future
will best be resolved if there is
confidence that the system can
work and some trust between the
groups involved.
Indeed the passage of this
proposal has taken on a larger
dimension than just a judicial
system. It is a sign of a new
beginning for constructive
interaction between students,
faculty and administration. Let's
leave the era of continuing
confrontation and deadlock
behind. Vote "Yes" on the C-15
proposal.
