# Many Questions Unanswered
## Admissions Policy Unclear 
### 
Eric Hemel, James Lobsenz

Last week in an article entitled "Admissions
Policy Favors Engineers" we unveiled an established
admissions policy of giving preference to
pre-engineers. Dr. Paul B. Green, in reply to our
request for an official explanation, wrote a letter to
the Daily printed last Thursday. While we appreciate
the speediness of Green's reply, we find its contents
unsatisfactory.
We specifically requested an answer to the
question, "What groups besides engineers receive
unpublicized admissions preference?" Dr. Green's
reply contained no answer. The only information he
provided was a concession that "the practice here is
to make adjustments within the middle group of
applicants year by year as preferences by major
change."
We feel that such a practice is not only unjust,
but impractical. Most Stanford students will readily
admit that high school seniors can only guess at the
time of their application to Stanford, as to what
their eventual major will be.
Many freshman and sophmores (and even some
juniors and seniors) participate in a game of
academic leapfrog, changing majors almost as
frequently as Stanford football players fumble. To
use a high school student's guess as to his future
major as a factor in admissions procedure is a folly
equivalent to building a house on a foundation of
shifting sand.
Necessitates Expansion
In his letter, Green also contends that the policy
favoring pre-engineers is designed to insure "the
utilization of the Engineering faculty and facilities."
What he overlooks is the fact that this policy does
more than sustain a static level of usage of existing
facilities; it contributes to the expansion of
Stanford's present engineering commitment. A new
9.2 million dollar engineering center is about to be
built on campus. Would we be building this center
today if the admissions process hadn't artificially
inflated the number of engineers at Stanford?
We believe that the allocation of educational
resources should not be distorted by preferential
policies.
Green assures us that "trade-offs are made," and
that if engineers were "applying in e\c*»ssivp

proportions .. . that Engineers would be
disfavored." Such "assurances" do not appease us in
the least. We believe that the proper admissions
policy is one of accepting the most talented
applicant, regardless of his or her professed
academic interests.
Similar Policies
An informed source told us recently that in
revealing the secret admissions policy favoring
pre-engineers we have touched upon only one of
several similar policies. We object to all such
policies, but if they are not rescinded, they should
at least be made public knowledge.
Furthermore, we are not persuaded by Green's
argument that the admissions office must "play to
the strengths of the university." Students are not
here in order to satisfy Stanford's appetites;
Stanford's function is to satisfy the educational
needs of its students.
Dr. Green invited us to propose a "single clear
uncompromising admissions standard." While we
doubt that anyone could propose such a panacea,
we can hardly contribute to admissions policy
formation if we do not know what the existing
policies are. We do not claim to have cornered the
market on truth. However, we do claim the right to
know what other preferential policies exist.
Omission
We are distressed with Dr. Green's omission of
this information from his reply. We now know that
pre-engineers are favored in the admissions process.
But who else is favored? And of equal importance,
who is disfavored?
Ruth Mayer, Carmen Logan and Quinn Mayer are
presently serving as student members on the
Committee on Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid (CUAFA). We call upon them to aid
us in receiving clear and direct answers to these
questions.
Finally, we invite all members of the Stanford
community to add their voices to the controversy
surrounding the secrecy and biases that exist in the
freshman admissions process.

9.2 million dollar engineering center is about to be
built on campus. Would we be building this center
today if the admissions process hadn't artificially
inflated the number of engineers at Stanford?
We believe that the allocation of educational
resources should not be distorted by preferential
policies.
Green assures us that "trade-offs are made," and
that if engineers were "applying in e\c*»ssivp

proportions .. . that Engineers would be
disfavored." Such "assurances" do not appease us in
the least. We believe that the proper admissions
policy is one of accepting the most talented
applicant, regardless of his or her professed
academic interests.
Similar Policies
An informed source told us recently that in
revealing the secret admissions policy favoring
pre-engineers we have touched upon only one of
several similar policies. We object to all such
policies, but if they are not rescinded, they should
at least be made public knowledge.
Furthermore, we are not persuaded by Green's
argument that the admissions office must "play to
the strengths of the university." Students are not
here in order to satisfy Stanford's appetites;
Stanford's function is to satisfy the educational
needs of its students.
Dr. Green invited us to propose a "single clear
uncompromising admissions standard." While we
doubt that anyone could propose such a panacea,
we can hardly contribute to admissions policy
formation if we do not know what the existing
policies are. We do not claim to have cornered the
market on truth. However, we do claim the right to
know what other preferential policies exist.
Omission
We are distressed with Dr. Green's omission of
this information from his reply. We now know that
pre-engineers are favored in the admissions process.
But who else is favored? And of equal importance,
who is disfavored?
Ruth Mayer, Carmen Logan and Quinn Mayer are
presently serving as student members on the
Committee on Undergraduate Admissions and
Financial Aid (CUAFA). We call upon them to aid
us in receiving clear and direct answers to these
questions.
Finally, we invite all members of the Stanford
community to add their voices to the controversy
surrounding the secrecy and biases that exist in the
freshman admissions process.

Last week in an article entitled "Admissions
Policy Favors Engineers" we unveiled an established
admissions policy of giving preference to
pre-engineers. Dr. Paul B. Green, in reply to our
request for an official explanation, wrote a letter to
the Daily printed last Thursday. While we appreciate
the speediness of Green's reply, we find its contents
unsatisfactory.
We specifically requested an answer to the
question, "What groups besides engineers receive
unpublicized admissions preference?" Dr. Green's
reply contained no answer. The only information he
provided was a concession that "the practice here is
to make adjustments within the middle group of
applicants year by year as preferences by major
change."
We feel that such a practice is not only unjust,
but impractical. Most Stanford students will readily
admit that high school seniors can only guess at the
time of their application to Stanford, as to what
their eventual major will be.
Many freshman and sophmores (and even some
juniors and seniors) participate in a game of
academic leapfrog, changing majors almost as
frequently as Stanford football players fumble. To
use a high school student's guess as to his future
major as a factor in admissions procedure is a folly
equivalent to building a house on a foundation of
shifting sand.
Necessitates Expansion
In his letter, Green also contends that the policy
favoring pre-engineers is designed to insure "the
utilization of the Engineering faculty and facilities."
What he overlooks is the fact that this policy does
more than sustain a static level of usage of existing
facilities; it contributes to the expansion of
Stanford's present engineering commitment. A new
9.2 million dollar engineering center is about to be
built on campus. Would we be building this center
today if the admissions process hadn't artificially
