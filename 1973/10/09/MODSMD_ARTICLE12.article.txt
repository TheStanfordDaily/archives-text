# Employers, Applicants Fill Maples
## Job Fair Attracts Over 2000 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
More than 2000 people looking
for jobs converged on Maples
Pavilion Saturday and Sunday.
They were greeted by 70 Bay
Area employers participating in a
job opportunity fair, co-sponsored
by the University.
Fair co-ordinator Ray Caldera,
temporarily assigned to the
University's Personnel-Employee
Relations office, said the fair

"more than met my expectations.
"I personally feel that the
feedback from the employers has
been very positive," he said.
Best Selection
In announcing the fair last
week Caldera stated its purpose
was to provide employers with the
best selection of technical,
managerial and professional talent
available. He indicated the event
would concentrate on finding jobs

for minorities, veterans and
women.
However, fair registration
director Dale McPherson said that
the applicants at the fair were
"well-rounded. We have seen a
number of people with liberal arts
backgrounds as well as technical
people. A lot of them have
graduate degrees."
Firms such as IBM, Southern
Pacific, Macy's and Kaiser Steel,
as well as the University and the
city of Palo Alto paid $150 to set
up booths at the fair. There was
no charge to job-seekers.
Satisfied
Both the employers and
prospective employees seemed
satisfied with the fair and the job
opportunities provided.
"It gave me a good overview of
the job situation in the Bay
Area," said one woman looking
for part-time secretarial work.
"You can find what you're
looking for."
"The quality of applicants here
is good," IBM representative Joerg
Ebel responded. "We have
established many contacts that
will result in employment."
And some people, at least,
found immediate work. Fair
co-chairman Herb Buckner,
director of civil rights affairs at
Kaiser Steel Corp., said that
Singer Corp. hired 18 new black

and Chicano secretaries at the fair.
However, most of the
employers preferred not to hire
applicants directly from the fair.
Many completed preliminary
interviews with job seekers and
channeled them into further
hiring procedures.
"It's company policy,"
explained Ebel. "We very rarely
hire someone at first sight."
Although the fair seemed to be
a success, officials did not want to
make commitments for another
one in the future.
"I think there has been enough
interest generated for more events
of this kind, but I really can't say
for sure if we will hold another
one," Caldera said.
Interim Report
"Within a week, we will receive
an interim report from the
employers with their reactions,"
Buckner said. "The final report
could take until the end of the
month to compile. We can't be
sure until then how successful the
fair really was."
"But I think there is a need for
another job fair," he continued.
"The response to this one has
been inspired with the total
involvement of both employer
and applicant."
Both Buckner and Caldera
complimented some 30 volunteers
who helped plan and staff the fair.

Many completed preliminary
interviews with job seekers and
channeled them into further
hiring procedures.
"It's company policy,"
explained Ebel. "We very rarely
hire someone at first sight."
Although the fair seemed to be
a success, officials did not want to
make commitments for another
one in the future.
"I think there has been enough
interest generated for more events
of this kind, but I really can't say
for sure if we will hold another
one," Caldera said.
Interim Report
"Within a week, we will receive
an interim report from the
employers with their reactions,"
Buckner said. "The final report
could take until the end of the
month to compile. We can't be
sure until then how successful the
fair really was."
"But I think there is a need for
another job fair," he continued.
"The response to this one has
been inspired with the total
involvement of both employer
and applicant."
Both Buckner and Caldera
complimented some 30 volunteers
who helped plan and staff the fair.

JOB FAIR — Seventy Bay Area employers met with 2000 job-seekers
Saturday and Sunday in Maples Pavilion in a job opportunity fair
sponsored by the University. Career-seekers found information booths
on businesses from IBM to Macy's.
More than 2000 people looking
for jobs converged on Maples
Pavilion Saturday and Sunday.
They were greeted by 70 Bay
Area employers participating in a
job opportunity fair, co-sponsored
by the University.
Fair co-ordinator Ray Caldera,
temporarily assigned to the
University's Personnel-Employee
Relations office, said the fair

"more than met my expectations.
"I personally feel that the
feedback from the employers has
been very positive," he said.
Best Selection
In announcing the fair last
week Caldera stated its purpose
was to provide employers with the
best selection of technical,
managerial and professional talent
available. He indicated the event
would concentrate on finding jobs

for minorities, veterans and
women.
However, fair registration
director Dale McPherson said that
the applicants at the fair were
"well-rounded. We have seen a
number of people with liberal arts
backgrounds as well as technical
people. A lot of them have
graduate degrees."
Firms such as IBM, Southern
Pacific, Macy's and Kaiser Steel,
as well as the University and the
city of Palo Alto paid $150 to set
up booths at the fair. There was
no charge to job-seekers.
Satisfied
Both the employers and
prospective employees seemed
satisfied with the fair and the job
opportunities provided.
"It gave me a good overview of
the job situation in the Bay
Area," said one woman looking
for part-time secretarial work.
"You can find what you're
looking for."
"The quality of applicants here
is good," IBM representative Joerg
Ebel responded. "We have
established many contacts that
will result in employment."
And some people, at least,
found immediate work. Fair
co-chairman Herb Buckner,
director of civil rights affairs at
Kaiser Steel Corp., said that
Singer Corp. hired 18 new black

and Chicano secretaries at the fair.
However, most of the
employers preferred not to hire
applicants directly from the fair.
Many completed preliminary
interviews with job seekers and
channeled them into further
hiring procedures.
"It's company policy,"
explained Ebel. "We very rarely
hire someone at first sight."
Although the fair seemed to be
