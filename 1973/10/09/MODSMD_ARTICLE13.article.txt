Well, fans and foes, Bug is back from an extended vacation .. .
ready to go to work combating evil and righting wrongs — not to
mention answering any and all questions that are sent our way. "Bug
Me" is a twice-weekly column written by Sue King. So, for all of you
novice Bug-readers, if you have questions about the University, the
community, related subjects or unrelated subjects — turn to Bug for
help.

Why is smoking allowed in classrooms? It is an infringement of the
rights of and threat to the health of non-smokers. —S.O.
Smoking is not allowed in classrooms, according to Amy Metcalfe,
assistant to the Provost.
In January, 1967, the Executive Committee of the Academic
Council passed a resolution forbidding smoking in classrooms and
examination rooms.
Metcalfe said that smoking is allowed in offices, seminar rooms
that have ashtrays, lounges, and designated public areas.
She explained that the University "is not trying to get students to
quit smoking, or anything like that. It's just that the old buildings
aren't built to handle smoking."
For example, she said, the wooden floors in the history corner of
the Quad make smoking there a real fire hazard.
Among the tennis courts northwest of the Women's Gym, there is a
fenced area that used to have two courts. It appears that Panama
Street was cut through a corner of the area, obliterating most of one
court and part of the other. One of the original nets remains, but a
game cannot be played there because the new fence cuts off part of
the backcourt.
It is clear that the existing net could be placed in the existing area
in an orientation that would permit the layout of at least one good
court. The two backboards in the area would still be usable if this
were done. What Stanford agency would be responsible for initiating
ths modification? —T.A.C.
Ruth Kaiser, of the Women's Physical Education department,
would be the person to talk to.
Kaiser said that if someone requested that she look into the
possibility of relocating the net, she would have to consult the tennis
instructors, since those courts are used primarily for lessons.
She also mentioned that not only did the construction of Panama
Street cut those two courts into strange and unusual shapes, and force
relocation of the other courts, but it also cut out an area that had
been used for a golf approach.
