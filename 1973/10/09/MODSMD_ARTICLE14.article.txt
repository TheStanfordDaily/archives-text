# High Court Allows Colleges To Bar Campus Disrupters
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -
Persons who disrupt a college or
university campus can be banned
from the campus by school
officials, the California Supreme
Court ruled last week.
The unanimous decision
upholding a 1969 penal code
section drew a line between lawful
peaceful persuasion and violent,
coercive or obstructive acts.
The case stems from a 1970
demonstration at San Francisco
State College by students and
non-students protesting articles in
the college paper as being "racist
and chauvinistic."
The demonstrators were told
by a college official that they no
longer had permission to remain
on campus. They refused to leave
and were arrested.
The demonstrators sought a
writ to stop prosecution, saying
the law was over-broad, vague and
did not provide due process. The
statute was upheld by both the
San Francisco Municipal and
Superior courts.
The high court, on review, said
the purpose of the legislation was
to provide school officials with a
swift remedy that is "often less
onerous than criminal
prosecution."
The decision stressed that the
statute is only compatible with
the constitutional guarantee of
freedom of speech if the statute's
broad reference to all "disruptions
of a campus" were interpreted

narrowly to apply only to
destruction of property,
intimidation of students, faculty
or staff, obstruction of entrances
or exits to school buildings and
other similar conduct "physically
incompatible with the peaceful
functioning of the campus."

The court made clear the
statute cannot apply to
constitutionally protected
activities such as speech-making,
leafletting and peaceful picketing
even though these may sometimes
disturb others because of ideology
or content.
