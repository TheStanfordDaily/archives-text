# Comp Center Reorganizes
## 
### 
"To bring computing to the
people," is how Michael Roberts,
deputy director of Stanford
Center for Information Processing
(SCIP), described the purpose of
the Computation Center's
reorganization.
SCIP, formed last April, is
"moving to consolidate hardware
and software to make computing
available to more people more
reliably," Roberts explained.
The reorganization
"restructures" the upper levels of
computer administration facilities
into a more efficient organization,
he contends.
Previously, there were five
different computers in five
different locations. Co-operation
between computers was limited
and distribution of funds was
difficult because there was no
efficient central computer agency.
SCIP will provide a "single
organization and planning
department for general purpose
computing at the University,"

Roberts stated.
Presently under SCIP, there are
four computers in three locations.
Ultimately, SCIP hopes to have all
computers in two locations. The
program will take about two years
to complete.
SCIP is in the process of
installing a new IBM 370
computer in the basement of
Encina Hall.
"We're about 10 to 15 percent
into the program right now,"
Roberts said.
SCIP hopes to construct a
network of terminals to the
computer processors and files.
"This will make computers more
accessible for administration,
research and students.
Some possible long range plans
include installation of computer
terminals throughout the campus.
Possible locations are Meyer
Undergraduate Library and some
of the larger dorms where
students can have easy access to
the computer.
