# Average College Costs Rise
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) - Rising
costs in everything from tuition to
rents are putting a money squeeze
on California students this fall,
colleges and universities report.
Students living in campus
residents halls at public four-year

institutions must shell out a
nationwide average of $110 more
this school year than last year,
says a copyright study prepared
by the College Scholarship Service
of Princeton, N.J.
The study said the $110 is a six
percent jump over academic
1972-73.
Tuition fees at private
four-year institutions have jumped
nearly seven percent over the past
two years in all parts of the
nation, the study added.
Richard Roullon, 26, and his
wife Cindy are feeling the pinch.
'The Pinch'
He is a fourth-year medical
student at the University of
California's Davis campus, relying
on loans to cover the rising costs.
Last year it was a loan from
the American Medical Association
— this year it's from the federal
government.
Mrs. Roullon, 23, has a
California teaching credential, but
has been unable to find a teaching
job. The Roullons live in a
Sacramento apartment to avoid
the higher rents charged for living
nearer the campus. He drives the
12 miles to campus.
Budget Stretch
Unless she finds a job or they
borrow from their families, the
Roullons say they must stretch
$700 remaining from their current
loan over the next three months.
That gives them a monthly budget
of exactly $233.33 — less than $8
a day — for rent, food and gas.
"We eat a lot of vegetables,"

Mrs. Roullon said in a recent
interview.
What do they splurge on?
"Food!" she replied.
"To go out to dinner, is the
biggest treat around. We go to an
occasional show, but it has to be a
super-rated show for us to go,"
she said.
'Wouldn't Make It'
"Dick's feelings are that if he
had to start now, we wouldn't
make it," she added.
"We're banking on my getting
a job. I'll have to get some kind of
a job," she said.
Students at the University of
California's Los Angeles campus
should have a minimum of $3000
for tuition, food, books and
lodging to get through this
academic year, the university
figures.
Aid Tighter
And while costs go up and up,
student financial aid is getting
tighter and tighter, the university
says.
"Fewer dollars are available for
student aid, and more students
have applied for help, says a
s p o kesman at UC's
29,000-student Berkeley campus.
"For 1972-73, there were 9500
applications to the financial aids
office, which determines student
needs and coordinates funding
from a variety of sources. For
1973-74, the number of
applications has totalled 11,000,"
the university said.
Student enrollment is about
the same this year as last.

the American Medical Association
— this year it's from the federal
government.
Mrs. Roullon, 23, has a
California teaching credential, but
has been unable to find a teaching
job. The Roullons live in a
Sacramento apartment to avoid
the higher rents charged for living
nearer the campus. He drives the
12 miles to campus.
Budget Stretch
Unless she finds a job or they
borrow from their families, the
Roullons say they must stretch
$700 remaining from their current
loan over the next three months.
That gives them a monthly budget
of exactly $233.33 — less than $8
a day — for rent, food and gas.
"We eat a lot of vegetables,"

Mrs. Roullon said in a recent
interview.
What do they splurge on?
"Food!" she replied.
"To go out to dinner, is the
biggest treat around. We go to an
occasional show, but it has to be a
super-rated show for us to go,"
she said.
'Wouldn't Make It'
"Dick's feelings are that if he
had to start now, we wouldn't
make it," she added.
"We're banking on my getting
a job. I'll have to get some kind of
a job," she said.
Students at the University of
California's Los Angeles campus
should have a minimum of $3000
for tuition, food, books and
lodging to get through this
academic year, the university
figures.
Aid Tighter
And while costs go up and up,
student financial aid is getting
tighter and tighter, the university
says.
"Fewer dollars are available for
student aid, and more students
have applied for help, says a
s p o kesman at UC's
29,000-student Berkeley campus.
"For 1972-73, there were 9500
applications to the financial aids
office, which determines student
needs and coordinates funding
from a variety of sources. For
1973-74, the number of
applications has totalled 11,000,"
the university said.
Student enrollment is about
the same this year as last.

SACRAMENTO (AP) - Rising
costs in everything from tuition to
rents are putting a money squeeze
on California students this fall,
colleges and universities report.
Students living in campus
residents halls at public four-year

institutions must shell out a
nationwide average of $110 more
this school year than last year,
says a copyright study prepared
by the College Scholarship Service
of Princeton, N.J.
The study said the $110 is a six
percent jump over academic
1972-73.
Tuition fees at private
four-year institutions have jumped
nearly seven percent over the past
two years in all parts of the
nation, the study added.
Richard Roullon, 26, and his
wife Cindy are feeling the pinch.
'The Pinch'
He is a fourth-year medical
student at the University of
California's Davis campus, relying
on loans to cover the rising costs.
Last year it was a loan from
the American Medical Association
— this year it's from the federal
government.
