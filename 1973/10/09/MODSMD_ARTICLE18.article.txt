# New County Proposed

MENLO PARK (AP) - A new
county should be carved into the
San Francisco Peninsula to
provide more efficient
government at a lower price,
Mayor Ira E. Bonde said Saturday.
The new county would include
parts of both Santa Clara and San
Mateo counties. It would be
bounded by and include Mountain
View on the south and Atherton
on the north.
"We in Menlo Park — a San
Mateo County city — have more
in common with Palo Alto in
Santa Clara County, than we do
with Brisbane in the north of our
own county," Bonde said.
"Yet because a county line
divides us, it is difficult to work
together to solve mutual
problems."
Bonde, who doesn't accept
regional government as the final
answer, favors consolidating
services such as purchasing,
elections processing and ballot
counting.
"We might even consolidate
the fire departments," Bonde said.
"After all, you only want one that
comes when you make the call.
"There should be subregional
governments to operate between
the purely local governmental
units and the regional
government."
Bonde says purely local policy.

such as zoning, should be handled
at the municipal level. Inter-city
and intra-city problems such as
transit should be handled by
subregional bodies made of several
counties with similar interests.

Strictly regional problems such
as air pollution, water quality and
waste disposal, should be handled
by regional government, Bonde
says.
