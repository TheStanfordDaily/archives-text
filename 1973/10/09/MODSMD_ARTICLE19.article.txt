# Pot Initiative Drive Begins
## 
### 
Undaunted by a 1972 electoral
defeat, supporters of the
California Marijuana Initiative
have mounted a drive to place
decriminalization of private
marijuana use before the voters
again.
Similar to Prop. 19, which
failed by a two-to-one margin last
November, the proposed
referendum would abolish all
penalties for personal use,
possession, transportation and
cultivation of marijuana.
It would, however, allow cities
to establish fines of up to $100
for smoking in public, and would
in no way affect federal laws

against sale of marijuana. In the
words of Joyce Wallace, a local
computer scientist who is
northern county coordinator for
the initiative, the proposition
"would not legalize marijuana,
but de-criminalize its use."
CMI is planning to establish
groups at Stanford and almost
every other college in the state.
Last year, the Palo Alto area
results showed 54 percent in favor
of the initiative, and University of
California campuses showed a
convincing 83 percent of voting
students supporting the measure.
The proposition's backers are
again depending on sizable
student support.
