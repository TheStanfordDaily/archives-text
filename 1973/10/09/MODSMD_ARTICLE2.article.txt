# Segal's ‘Love Story’:
## Orgies Spawned Comedy 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Harvard Classics Prof. Erich Segal
lectured last night that comedy was
born of an orgy.
Segal, best known as author of
Love Story, spoke before some 225
persons, mostly humanities students,
at Annenberg Auditorium.
While lecturing seriously, Segal
took "poetic license" in giving three
sexually-oriented roots of the word
"comedy" — "Night song," "orgy,"
and "country," admitting after the
speech that the latter definition was in
part a pun.

According to Segal, today's comedy
is a "sublimation of what people do at
orgies."
Originally, Segal said, comos, a
Green word loosely defined as "orgy,"
was "conceived in fear of a loss of
harvest."
Sun-Earth Marriage
The only way primitive man could
ensure that the soil would be fertile
was to recreate the earth-sun marriage
that he believed created the universe,
Segal explained. The way to do this
was to hold orgies.
Segal, quoting freely from literature

in five languages, cited the Victorian
euphamism for illicit sex — "to redo
the beginning erf the world" — as
evidence for this claim.
Christianity, according to Segal, has
never been able to repress occasional
sacreligious orgies. He noted that on
Christmas Day, 1503, a group of
Romans "went out into the streets
wearing masks .. . which looked like
the male organ — and exhibited
themselves to the Pope."
Segal pointed out that the phallic
symbol has historically been important
in nearly all societies.
Flowering Symbol
"The phallic symbol," he said, "is
an instrument not only for the
continuance of the species but also for
the flowering of fauna," and thus the
phallus has been used in nearly all
fertility rites, both in actuality and
symbolically.
Segal also noted that "invigoration
by invective," has been used to
promote fertility "at both the wedding
and the harvest."
Thus, in the movie The Godfather
the song at the wedding of the
"goddaughter ... was made up of
jokes impugning the sexual capacity of
the groom," Segal said.
Orgies have been the root of
comedy throughout the ages, Segal
hinted, although in spoken comedy
man is a spectator rather than a
participant.
Shakespeare, Too
Shakespearian audiences, he noted,
laughed at such lines as "Jack will have
Jill I and nought will be ill," from
Midsummer Night's Dream.
Today's comedy also has a basically
sexual orientation, but still man has an
occasional need to participate in an
orgy of sex and drink, Segal said.
"Look at New Year's Day, look at
the Mardi Gras in New Orleans, maybe
even the fourth of July," Segal said.
Segal will lecture today in a seminar
on Latin poetry before leaving
campus.

Segal explained. The way to do this
was to hold orgies.
Segal, quoting freely from literature

in five languages, cited the Victorian
euphamism for illicit sex — "to redo
the beginning erf the world" — as
evidence for this claim.
Christianity, according to Segal, has
never been able to repress occasional
sacreligious orgies. He noted that on
Christmas Day, 1503, a group of
Romans "went out into the streets
wearing masks .. . which looked like
the male organ — and exhibited
themselves to the Pope."
Segal pointed out that the phallic
symbol has historically been important
in nearly all societies.
Flowering Symbol
"The phallic symbol," he said, "is
an instrument not only for the
continuance of the species but also for
the flowering of fauna," and thus the
phallus has been used in nearly all
fertility rites, both in actuality and
symbolically.
Segal also noted that "invigoration
by invective," has been used to
promote fertility "at both the wedding
and the harvest."
Thus, in the movie The Godfather
the song at the wedding of the
"goddaughter ... was made up of
jokes impugning the sexual capacity of
the groom," Segal said.
Orgies have been the root of
comedy throughout the ages, Segal
hinted, although in spoken comedy
man is a spectator rather than a
participant.
Shakespeare, Too
Shakespearian audiences, he noted,
laughed at such lines as "Jack will have
Jill I and nought will be ill," from
Midsummer Night's Dream.
Today's comedy also has a basically
sexual orientation, but still man has an
occasional need to participate in an
orgy of sex and drink, Segal said.
"Look at New Year's Day, look at
the Mardi Gras in New Orleans, maybe
even the fourth of July," Segal said.
Segal will lecture today in a seminar
on Latin poetry before leaving
campus.
Harvard Classics Prof. Erich Segal
lectured last night that comedy was
born of an orgy.
Segal, best known as author of
Love Story, spoke before some 225
persons, mostly humanities students,
at Annenberg Auditorium.
While lecturing seriously, Segal
took "poetic license" in giving three
sexually-oriented roots of the word
"comedy" — "Night song," "orgy,"
and "country," admitting after the
speech that the latter definition was in
part a pun.

According to Segal, today's comedy
is a "sublimation of what people do at
orgies."
Originally, Segal said, comos, a
Green word loosely defined as "orgy,"
was "conceived in fear of a loss of
harvest."
Sun-Earth Marriage
The only way primitive man could
ensure that the soil would be fertile
was to recreate the earth-sun marriage
that he believed created the universe,
Segal explained. The way to do this
was to hold orgies.
