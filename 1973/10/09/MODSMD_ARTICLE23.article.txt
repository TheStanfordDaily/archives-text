# ‘To Get Job Done’
## Moscone Joins Statehouse Race 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
State Sen. George Moscone,
D—San Francisco, is giving up his
powerful post as Senate majority
leader to join the legions of
contenders for the 1974
Democratic gubernatorial
nomination. Ask him why he's
willing to yield his Senate seat and
post (his current term expires
next year) for a race that's
uncertain at best, and he leans
back in his chair and smiles.
"The fact is that nobody in the

state legislature has the power and
authority to get the job done,"
Moscone said in an interview with
the Daily last week. "It's the
governor in the last analysis who
determines every policy question,
every dime spent. He sets the
tone."
In Palo Alto Thursday night to
seek support for his bid, Moscone
freely discussed his campaign and
some of the problems and
hardships it's imposed.
For example, Moscone has
been living in Southern California
"five or six days a week" since the
legislature recessed last month,
even though his family remains in
San Francisco. Moscone said he'll
continue that schedule until the
Senate reconvenes in January.
"We talked about this, and
realized that this is just an
adjustment we'll have to make,"
Moscone said.
Even though the bulk of the
state's voters are located in
Southern California, Moscone
denied that Los Angeles-area
residence is now a prerequisite for
a successful statewide candidate.

"It's not so much where you
hale from as it is where you're
known," he said. The purpose of
his living in Los Angeles is to
"become known. I've had
coverage down there in the L.A.
Times and radio and TV, and
people are starting to notice."
Moscone said he sees little
:liance that any of the major
Democratic contenders will drop
out of the race before the June,
1972 primary. "If, say, Joe Alioto
says to me, 'You ought to get out
of the race,' I'd say, 'Joe, I got 72
percent of the vote in San
Francisco [running for the Senate
in 1970] and you got 38 percent
[running for mayor in 1971].'
Why don't you get out?"
Moscone has opposed the
death penalty and supported
decriminalization of marijuana —
both in opposition to stands taken
by California voters in the 1972
election. However, he said he
doesn't think any one particular
issue will provide the cutting edge
in the Democratic primary.
"I think it will basically get
down to who's still got a serious

chance in the weeks leading up to
the election. If Alioto and I end
up head-to-head, well, I think it'll
be a pretty clear-cut choice
between the conservative and the
liberal.
"If it's [Secretary of State]
Jerry Brown, it may be mor<»
difficult to overcome that name
recognition [Brown's father,
Edmund G. Brown Sr., was
governor from 1959-1967].
"If it's [U.S. Rep. Jerome]
Waldie, well, he may be a lot
tougher because he's a lot more
people-oriented than the others.
"If it's [Assembly Speaker]
Bob Moretti, I think people will
choose between a sense of
compassion and an aura of raw
power. I say this, though you
must understand that of those
candidates Moretti is my closest
friend."
It's no accident that all
Moscone's scenarios include
himself as one of the two
remaining candidates. He is, he
said, "committed" to the race.
"I'll see it through to the end," he
declared.

"We talked about this, and
realized that this is just an
adjustment we'll have to make,"
Moscone said.
Even though the bulk of the
state's voters are located in
Southern California, Moscone
denied that Los Angeles-area
residence is now a prerequisite for
a successful statewide candidate.

"It's not so much where you
hale from as it is where you're
known," he said. The purpose of
his living in Los Angeles is to
"become known. I've had
coverage down there in the L.A.
Times and radio and TV, and
people are starting to notice."
Moscone said he sees little
:liance that any of the major
Democratic contenders will drop
out of the race before the June,
1972 primary. "If, say, Joe Alioto
says to me, 'You ought to get out
of the race,' I'd say, 'Joe, I got 72
percent of the vote in San
Francisco [running for the Senate
in 1970] and you got 38 percent
[running for mayor in 1971].'
Why don't you get out?"
Moscone has opposed the
death penalty and supported
decriminalization of marijuana —
both in opposition to stands taken
by California voters in the 1972
election. However, he said he
doesn't think any one particular
issue will provide the cutting edge
in the Democratic primary.
"I think it will basically get
down to who's still got a serious

chance in the weeks leading up to
the election. If Alioto and I end
up head-to-head, well, I think it'll
be a pretty clear-cut choice
between the conservative and the
liberal.
"If it's [Secretary of State]
Jerry Brown, it may be mor<»
difficult to overcome that name
recognition [Brown's father,
Edmund G. Brown Sr., was
governor from 1959-1967].
"If it's [U.S. Rep. Jerome]
Waldie, well, he may be a lot
tougher because he's a lot more
people-oriented than the others.
"If it's [Assembly Speaker]
Bob Moretti, I think people will
choose between a sense of
compassion and an aura of raw
power. I say this, though you
must understand that of those
candidates Moretti is my closest
friend."
It's no accident that all
Moscone's scenarios include
himself as one of the two
remaining candidates. He is, he
said, "committed" to the race.
"I'll see it through to the end," he
declared.


GEORGE MOSCONE
State Sen. George Moscone,
D—San Francisco, is giving up his
powerful post as Senate majority
leader to join the legions of
contenders for the 1974
Democratic gubernatorial
nomination. Ask him why he's
willing to yield his Senate seat and
post (his current term expires
next year) for a race that's
uncertain at best, and he leans
back in his chair and smiles.
"The fact is that nobody in the

state legislature has the power and
authority to get the job done,"
Moscone said in an interview with
the Daily last week. "It's the
governor in the last analysis who
determines every policy question,
every dime spent. He sets the
tone."
In Palo Alto Thursday night to
seek support for his bid, Moscone
freely discussed his campaign and
some of the problems and
hardships it's imposed.
For example, Moscone has
been living in Southern California
"five or six days a week" since the
legislature recessed last month,
even though his family remains in
San Francisco. Moscone said he'll
continue that schedule until the
Senate reconvenes in January.
"We talked about this, and
realized that this is just an

Moscone said.
