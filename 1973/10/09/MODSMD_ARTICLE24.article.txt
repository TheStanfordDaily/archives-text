# SJ Police To Adjust Hiring
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - The
City of San Jose — while
admitting to no discriminatory
practices — last week agreed to a
court-approved plan to hire more
chicanos on its police force.
U.S. District Court Judge
Charles B. Renfrew signed an
order which dismissed a 1972
class action suit and provided for
filling one-half of the available
openings in the police department
with eligible Mexican-Americans.
Under the plan, the city also is
using a new written examination
for prospective policemen,
replacing one alleged to have been
discriminatory.
The judge said no
determination had been made by
the court on whether the city
discriminated against anyone on
the basis of race or national
origin.
The San Jose police
department had 600 policemen,
including 16 chicanos, in May,
1972, and how has 654 members,
52 of them chicano.
The consent order provides
that that officers must be hired
from an eligibility list created
after written, oral and physical
agility tests are given. It must

identify persons who are bilingual
in Spanish and English, and in
addition bicultural in Mexican and
Mexican-American cultures.
The order said the department

"shall first hire for at least one
half of the available positions any
and all individuals" identified as
bilingual and bicultural before any
other persons are hired.
Asst. City Atty. Clarence Shuh
said the eligibility list currently
includes 168 persons and 31 of
these are chicanos.
Of the 31, 23 are bilingual and
bicultural.
Shuh said the increase from
May, 1972, to the present time in
chicano personnel on the force
has been due to an extensive
recruitment program.
The order also provides that
the city, department and their
officials shall not engage in any
act or practice which has the
effect of illegally discriminating
against any person because of
race, color or national origin in
screening prospective police
candidates.
