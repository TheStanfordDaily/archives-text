# Joyful Concert Reunion Foreshadows Crosby, Stills, Nash, And Young Album

SAN FRANCISCO - Steven
Stills provided an evening of
surprises and fine music for the
near seJout crowd at Winterland
last Thursday night — with a little
help from his friends.
He performed with his group
Manassas, and three old friends
dropped in to help out — David
Crosby, Graham Nash, and Neil
Young. It turned out to be a very
special night, with very special
music.
Backed by Manassas, featuring
Fuzzy Samuels on bass, Dallas
Taylor on drums, and Chris
Hillman on guitar and mandolin,
Stills brought the crowd to its feet
with his opening set of rock
music. It included "So You Want
to Be a Rock 4 N' Roll Star,"
written by Hillman and Jim
McGuinn in the days of the Byrds.
The songs were well-received,
but after only 15 minutes of
music, the stage was abruptly
vacated. After a long pause, stage
hands brought out Stills' acoustic
guitar and banjo, presumably for
his solo set. Minutes passed, and
he still hadn't reappeared.
Puzzling Time-Filler
Instead, Hillman came out and
sang two country songs from his
days with the Flying Burrito
Brothers. This seemed to be a
time filler.
During the second song, stage
hands removed Stills' guitar and
banjo. This all made very little
sense until Hillman left, and Stills
finally reappeared. But he was not
alone. Winterland was engulfed in
a rage of wild applause as Graham
Nash and David Crosby came out
to join him.
After the audience excitement
had subdued somewhat, the trio
sang "Helplessly Hoping," with
Stills on guitar. This was followed
by "Wooden Ships," and then
something which is a rarity in
such a concert — they sang a song
not by Crosby, Stills, Nash or
Young. The tribute went to
Lennon and McCartney and the
song was "Blackbird."

Though it had been a long time
since the five had played together
publicly, their harmonies, a
trademark of their original sound,
were as fine as ever. After these
three songs Stills went to the
piano, and Neil Young appeared
on stage. Now the Four Way
Street was complete.
If they had played just their
old material *he night would have
been a great success, but the real
bonus of the evening came when
they introduced new material.
Though they never mentioned
anything about a new album, it
seems reasonable to assume that
one should be coming out soon.
And if the new songs performed
that night are any indication, the
album should be quite good.
One of their new numbers was
a country-western ditty about
"rolling another number for the
road." Another offered a
retrospective view of the
Woodstock era of four years ago:
"I'm not going back to
Woodstock for awhile/ though I
long to hear that lonesome hippy
smile/ I'm a million miles away/
from that helicopter day.
Secure Supergroup
And just as Woodstock had
marked the beginning of Crosby,
Stills, Nash, and Young, this night
seemed to mark a rebirth of that
same supergroup. After all the
changes and new musical areas
which each had explored, they
were reunited, sounding better
than ever. They were relaxed and
happy throughout the
performance, unlike Woodstock
where they admitted to being
"scared shitless."
With Young on harmonica they
did a song about a "Misty
Mountain," and then a new one
about "Living in a Dreamland."
Next Young transferred to the
piano as Nash invited people to
sing along with the next song.
Stills looked puzzled and quipped,
"By the end of the song I might
even learn it."
In an attempt to tune the three
guitars to the piano, Nash gave his

cohorts a piano note. It failed to
match up with the guitars. Crosby
just smiled and said, "That's as
close as we've been all night."
Musical Chairs
The song played next was
smooth and pleasant, and the
crowd found it easy to join in the
chorus: "Everybody knows music
gets you high/ Everybody grows
and so it goes."
The game of musical chairs
continued, and Nash was next to
take a turn at the piano. He
introduced a song he wrote
recently about people in jail. He
said he felt close to the song since
he himself has "been in jail a lot."
With Young on guitar and the
others in harmony, Nash sang lead
and played both piano and
harmonica on this moving song
that could be titled "It's an Open
Door."
'Long Time Gone'
Crosby then explained to the
crowd how the group had
outgrown some of their old songs,
some of their sad ones. But he
added, "Everytime Walter
Cronkite and I get together over
dinner and try to figure out
what's going on, this song seems
to be more appropriate as time
goes on."
The song was, of course, "Long
Time Gone," and sounded quite

different from the original electric
version of it. The lyrics stood out
more in this softer version with
Crosby, Stills and Nash on guitar
and Young on the piano.
For the last song of the set,
Stills returned to the spotlight for
his song "Change Partners," which
was followed by a lengthy
standing ovation.
Stills soon reentered with
Manassas and did some
country-western material. After
what had gone before, this was an
anticlimax. "49 Reasons" and
"For What It's Worth," with Stills
on piano highlighted this set.
Midway through another song he
broke into "Carry On," as Nash,
Crosby, and Young reappeared
smiling and harmonizing.
Following another standing
ovation, Stills returned alone.
Enthusiastic Foot-Stomping
His encore included these lyrics
which might have been addressed
to his three famous companions:
"Today my friends we find
ourselves in a similar kind of
way." For the finale, Manassas
joined Crosby, Stills, Nash, and
Young in "Find the Cost of
Freedom." Even a wild
foot-stomping 15 minute
standing ovation by the
enthusiastic crowd failed to bring
them back. The show was over.
