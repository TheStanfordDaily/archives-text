# Burly Bluesman Captivates Audience
## Taj Displays Diverse Talent Stanford Daily Entertainment 
### VICKI LABRIE 
SAN FRANCISCO—Taj Mahal
is a performer who plays a variety
of instruments. At the
Boarding House last week he
displayed his diverse musical
talents on the fife, banjo, guitar,
and mandolin.
But one of the things that this
burly musician does best is sing
the blues — bending notes,
breaking up the beat, running the
rhythm together and stretching
out the words like a rubber band
ready to snap — and that's what
the capacity crowd of 200 came
to hear.
The set started off with a
couple of instrumentals and
quickly gained momentum. When
Taj began to sing he had the
audience in his hand, tilting his
head coyly and rolling his eyes to

a song called "Make Sweet Love
to My Baby 'Cause I Just Can't
Stand to Let Her Be."
His raw-toned voice, as hoarse
as ever, huskily cast out the lyrics
to a catchy, toe-tapping beat on
"I Got the Blues So Bad It Put My
Face in a Permanent Frown."
The songs he sings are
reflections of the South, often
with a humorous twist. Taj's blues
shout and work songs bare human
emotions and deal with big-legged
women, the trials of the earth,
and the blues.
Taj was accompanied by Eric
Ajaye on electric string bass and
bass guitar, Hoshal Wright on
electric guitar, and John Simon at
the piano. The trio provided a
supportive unending backup to
the leader's gruff voice and
mandolin in "Stealin'
accentuating the rhythmic breaks
and providing a steady beat.
At one point, Taj asked the
crowd to sing along; fortunately
most of the audience sang in tune.
However, the quality of the
performance was considerably
weakened by his insistance on
sharing the spotlight with his
audience.
Taj Mahal's musical
presentations are characterzied by
easy, sometimes obscure, and

noncommercial numbers;
however, opening night's set was
sprinkled with tunes recorded in
his last three albums. After
another annoying sing-along, Taj
Mahal broke into "Good Morning,
Little School Girl" which
provoked the crowd into standing
applause as the group left the
stage.
With little coaxing, the
musicians (minus Simon) returned
to play "Giant Step." This was
perhaps the best number during
the evening. Taj's voice was
particularly delicate, more like
sandpaper, than gravel; Ajaye
bowed his bass with deliberate
agility while Wright's guitar strains
added a limpid accompaniment.
Joan Armatrading shared the
bill singing and playing a blend of
blues and folk that complemented
Taj Mahal's performance.
The Jamaican-born singer ably

accompanied herself on a
steelstring guitar or piano.
She quickly broke down the
barrier between herself and the
audience with friendly chit-chat,
announcing the titles of each of
her songs. Most groups assume
you already know the title or
don't think it is important.
Armatrading's style is
reminiscent of Joni Mitchell's —
she has a limited voice range but
injects falsetto notes intelligently.
After 40 minutes of pleasant
but unobtrusive songs, she broke a
string on her guitar, promptly
wrenched it from the frog, and
made a point of her
unprofessionalism.
All in all, the combined talents
of Taj Mahal and Armatrading
produced a show that was honest,
satisfying, and twice as
comfortable as the Boardinghouse
seats.

A LITTLE HELP FROM HIS FRlENDS—Thursday night was an evening of fine music and surprises at
Winterland as David Crosby, Graham Nash and Neil Young joined Stephen Stills (above) on stage. The
reunited quartet played many of their old hits and introduced much new material, prompting speculation
that a new CSN & Y album is in the offing. Stills also performed with his own backup group, Manassas.
