# Predictable Excellence Marks 'Rigoletto'
## 
### JIM CAMERON 
SAN FRANCISCO—Writing a review of
an opera which has already given its final
performance might be viewed as a frivolous
exercise; one would certainly be hard put
to justify an ex post facto critique of a
mediocre or disappointing production. The
San Francisco Opera's new production of
Verdi's Rigoletto, however, did not
disappoint — in fact, it exhilarated and
inspired. Rigoletto is but a harbinger of
great opera still in the offing, and ample
insurance that the culturally-starved
individual who visits the War Memorial
Opera House before the final performance
of the current season will be exposed to a
superlative eveing of opera.
The beauty of Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's
production lay in its command of all of the
components of opera. Not only did the
cast fill the hall with rich musical tones;
the singers offered fine portrayals of the
story's powerful drama. Ponnelle
surrounded his stars with stunning sets and
a superlative chorus and demonstrated in
his interpretation of the Verdian tragedy
the directorial genius with which he has
achieved world fame.
Traditionally, the curtain rises on the
Duke's court after the orchestra has
performed the somber and forbidding
overture. Ponnelle, however, lifted the
curtain as the overture began and revealed
Rigoletto mourning over the body of his
daughter.
Confrontation
The entire opera thus became a
flashback, Rigoletto's recollection of the
events which led up to Gilda's untimely
death. With the overture's final chord,
Rigoletto spun around and confronted a
stunning tableau of the Duke's court. The
audience was struck by the imagery of the
leering courtiers and tapestries, all in
shades of a vermillion which reeked of
aristocratic decadence.

Ponnelle continued to display his
mastery of visual effect throughout the
opera. In contrast to the ruddiness of the
court, he designed Rigoletto's cottage in
pristine and verdant shades. He juxtaposed
dark, ominous stone and wood with
brilliant lighting effects to create the inn of
the assassin Sparafucile.
As director he manipulated the chorus
to great advantage: courtiers emerged
instantaneously from tapestries and
menaced the Duke with attempts to
glimpse his amorous adventures.
Visual, Musical Delights
These visual delights, however, did not
outshine the musical and dramatic
performances, particularly those of the
three principals.
Giacomo Aragall, in his San Francisco
debut, applied his vocal talents to the role
of the Duke. The young Spanish tenor has
been lauded for his superb high register; in
this production, however, he shied away
from some of the upper reaches of the role
and sang in other ranges with apparent
tension and slightly flawed pitch control.
Nevertheless, his voice is exquisitely
rich, especially in its middle range. His
vocal performance had many beautiful
moments, and he acted comfortably and
with conviction.
Surprising Soprano
The greatest surprise of the evening was
Izabella Nawe, making her American debut
in the role of Gilda. Nawe possesses a light
and clear voice which sparkles in its upper
reaches. She executed the difficult
coloratura passages with impressive
precision.
Except for occasional spurts of heavy
vibrato, the young East German soprano
dazzled with vocal and dramatic brilliance
and gave San Francisco a Gilda to
remember.
But the evening belonged to Rigoletto.
Making his San Francisco debut in the role

with which he capitvated Met audiences
last year, American baritone Sherrill Milnes
gave a perfectly-conceived performance.
Confident Baritone
His voice is rich and certain, capable of
reaching well above the baritone tessitura,
and endowed with a tremendous sustaining
power. His two principal arias, as well as
his duets with Gilda, were models of
musical grace.
Milnes also established himself as a fine
actor, offering a profound and sensitive
portrayal of the cursed hunchback.
These luminaries were surrounded by an
excellent supporting cast, notably Clifford
Grant as the sinister Sparafucile and
Silvana Mazzieri as his sister, Maddalena.
The chorus lent outstanding vocal support,
and Polish maestro Kazimierz Kord
directed masterfully from the pit.
Predictable Perfection
General Director Kurt Herbert Adler has
assembled equally talented performers
from the U.S. and abroad for the remaining
seven productions of the season. Herr
Adler has always been particularly
successful in attracting burgeoning
European talent to his stage: Birgit Nilsson
and Luciano Pavarotti are but two of
opera's great voices that Adler introduced
to American audiences.
The next seven weeks will witness
several American debuts, numerous San
Francisco debuts, and the return of many
stars already known to Bay Area
audiences:
—Wagner's Tannhaeuser stars the
internationally acclaimed sopranos Leonie
Rysanek and Marita Napier, as well as the
mainstays of last year's Ring, Jess Thomas,
Thomas Stewart, and Clifford Grant.
—The cast of Mussorgsky's masterpieces,
Boris Godunou, is headed by Finland's
Martti Talvela, acknowledged by many
critics as the world's greatest bass, and

American soprano Evelyn Lear.
—Ingrid Steger makes her American
debut in the title role of Richard Strauss's
Elektra, and the veteran mezzo Irene Dalis
returns as Klytemnestra.
—Benjamin Britten's Peter Grimes
appears on the Opera House stage for the
first time under the direction of veteran
Mozartean baritone Sir Geraint Evans; Jess
Thomas plays the title role, and British
soprano Ava June debuts as Ellen Orford.
—The perennial favorite, Verdi's La
Traviata, is this year's vehicle for the
ever-dazzling Beverly Sills. Polish tenor
Wieslaw Ochman and Italian baritone
Gianpiero Mastromei join Sills in what will
certainly be a splendid production.
—Another Verdi favorite, Don Carlo,
features England's superlative mezzo,
Josephine Veasey, as Princess Eboli, and
Martti Talvela as Philip 11, the greatest of
the Verdi bass roles.
—Finally, a young, international cast,
headed by Spanish tenor Jose Carreras, will
present the ever-popular La Boheme.
Standing Room Only
While most performances have already
been sold out, there are always standing
room tickets available for every
performance. Standing room is inexpensive
— $3.00 — and, during such fine opera
performances standing for more than three
hours is not at all tiring.
To increase your enjoyment, borrow a
copy of one of the several general works on
opera, such as the Milton Cross or the
Victor book, and read the story.
Recordings of all of these operas are
available at the listening library in UGLY.
Above all, don't allow the months of
October and November to pass without
having attended at least one of these
outstanding productions of the San
Francisco Opera, recognized as one of the
great companies of the world.

Elektra, and the veteran mezzo Irene Dalis
returns as Klytemnestra.
—Benjamin Britten's Peter Grimes
appears on the Opera House stage for the

—The perennial favorite, Verdi's La

Standing Room Only
While most performances have already
been sold out, there are always standing
room tickets available for every
performance. Standing room is inexpensive
— $3.00 — and, during such fine opera
performances standing for more than three
hours is not at all tiring.
To increase your enjoyment, borrow a
copy of one of the several general works on
opera, such as the Milton Cross or the
Victor book, and read the story.
Recordings of all of these operas are
available at the listening library in UGLY.
Above all, don't allow the months of
October and November to pass without
having attended at least one of these
outstanding productions of the San
Francisco Opera, recognized as one of the
great companies of the world.
SAN FRANCISCO—Writing a review of
an opera which has already given its final
performance might be viewed as a frivolous
exercise; one would certainly be hard put
to justify an ex post facto critique of a
mediocre or disappointing production. The
San Francisco Opera's new production of
Verdi's Rigoletto, however, did not
disappoint — in fact, it exhilarated and
inspired. Rigoletto is but a harbinger of
great opera still in the offing, and ample
insurance that the culturally-starved
individual who visits the War Memorial
Opera House before the final performance
of the current season will be exposed to a
superlative eveing of opera.
The beauty of Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's
production lay in its command of all of the
components of opera. Not only did the
cast fill the hall with rich musical tones;
the singers offered fine portrayals of the
story's powerful drama. Ponnelle
surrounded his stars with stunning sets and
a superlative chorus and demonstrated in
his interpretation of the Verdian tragedy
the directorial genius with which he has
achieved world fame.
Traditionally, the curtain rises on the
Duke's court after the orchestra has
performed the somber and forbidding
overture. Ponnelle, however, lifted the
curtain as the overture began and revealed
Rigoletto mourning over the body of his
daughter.
Confrontation
The entire opera thus became a
flashback, Rigoletto's recollection of the
events which led up to Gilda's untimely
death. With the overture's final chord,
Rigoletto spun around and confronted a
stunning tableau of the Duke's court. The
audience was struck by the imagery of the
leering courtiers and tapestries, all in
shades of a vermillion which reeked of
aristocratic decadence.

Ponnelle continued to display his
mastery of visual effect throughout the
opera. In contrast to the ruddiness of the
court, he designed Rigoletto's cottage in
pristine and verdant shades. He juxtaposed
dark, ominous stone and wood with
brilliant lighting effects to create the inn of
the assassin Sparafucile.
As director he manipulated the chorus
to great advantage: courtiers emerged
instantaneously from tapestries and
menaced the Duke with attempts to
glimpse his amorous adventures.
Visual, Musical Delights
These visual delights, however, did not
outshine the musical and dramatic
performances, particularly those of the
three principals.
Giacomo Aragall, in his San Francisco
debut, applied his vocal talents to the role
of the Duke. The young Spanish tenor has
been lauded for his superb high register; in
this production, however, he shied away
from some of the upper reaches of the role
and sang in other ranges with apparent
tension and slightly flawed pitch control.
Nevertheless, his voice is exquisitely
rich, especially in its middle range. His
vocal performance had many beautiful
moments, and he acted comfortably and
with conviction.
Surprising Soprano
The greatest surprise of the evening was
Izabella Nawe, making her American debut
in the role of Gilda. Nawe possesses a light
and clear voice which sparkles in its upper
reaches. She executed the difficult
coloratura passages with impressive
precision.
Except for occasional spurts of heavy
vibrato, the young East German soprano
dazzled with vocal and dramatic brilliance
and gave San Francisco a Gilda to
remember.
But the evening belonged to Rigoletto.
Making his San Francisco debut in the role

with which he capitvated Met audiences
last year, American baritone Sherrill Milnes
gave a perfectly-conceived performance.
Confident Baritone
His voice is rich and certain, capable of
reaching well above the baritone tessitura,
and endowed with a tremendous sustaining
power. His two principal arias, as well as
his duets with Gilda, were models of
musical grace.
Milnes also established himself as a fine
actor, offering a profound and sensitive
portrayal of the cursed hunchback.
These luminaries were surrounded by an
excellent supporting cast, notably Clifford
Grant as the sinister Sparafucile and
Silvana Mazzieri as his sister, Maddalena.
The chorus lent outstanding vocal support,
and Polish maestro Kazimierz Kord
directed masterfully from the pit.
Predictable Perfection
General Director Kurt Herbert Adler has
assembled equally talented performers
from the U.S. and abroad for the remaining
seven productions of the season. Herr
Adler has always been particularly
successful in attracting burgeoning
European talent to his stage: Birgit Nilsson
and Luciano Pavarotti are but two of
opera's great voices that Adler introduced
to American audiences.
The next seven weeks will witness
several American debuts, numerous San
Francisco debuts, and the return of many
stars already known to Bay Area
audiences:
—Wagner's Tannhaeuser stars the
internationally acclaimed sopranos Leonie
Rysanek and Marita Napier, as well as the
mainstays of last year's Ring, Jess Thomas,
Thomas Stewart, and Clifford Grant.
—The cast of Mussorgsky's masterpieces,
Boris Godunou, is headed by Finland's
Martti Talvela, acknowledged by many
critics as the world's greatest bass, and

American soprano Evelyn Lear.
—Ingrid Steger makes her American
debut in the title role of Richard Strauss's
Elektra, and the veteran mezzo Irene Dalis

vibrato, the young East German soprano
dazzled with vocal and dramatic brilliance
and gave San Francisco a Gilda to
remember.
But the evening belonged to Rigoletto.
Making his San Francisco debut in the role

with which he capitvated Met audiences
last year, American baritone Sherrill Milnes
gave a perfectly-conceived performance.
Confident Baritone
His voice is rich and certain, capable of
reaching well above the baritone tessitura,
and endowed with a tremendous sustaining
power. His two principal arias, as well as
his duets with Gilda, were models of
musical grace.
Milnes also established himself as a fine
actor, offering a profound and sensitive
portrayal of the cursed hunchback.
These luminaries were surrounded by an
excellent supporting cast, notably Clifford
Grant as the sinister Sparafucile and
Silvana Mazzieri as his sister, Maddalena.
The chorus lent outstanding vocal support,
and Polish maestro Kazimierz Kord
directed masterfully from the pit.
Predictable Perfection
General Director Kurt Herbert Adler has
assembled equally talented performers
from the U.S. and abroad for the remaining
seven productions of the season. Herr
Adler has always been particularly
successful in attracting burgeoning
European talent to his stage: Birgit Nilsson
and Luciano Pavarotti are but two of
opera's great voices that Adler introduced
to American audiences.
The next seven weeks will witness
several American debuts, numerous San
Francisco debuts, and the return of many
stars already known to Bay Area
audiences:
—Wagner's Tannhaeuser stars the
internationally acclaimed sopranos Leonie
Rysanek and Marita Napier, as well as the
mainstays of last year's Ring, Jess Thomas,
Thomas Stewart, and Clifford Grant.
—The cast of Mussorgsky's masterpieces,
Boris Godunou, is headed by Finland's
Martti Talvela, acknowledged by many
critics as the world's greatest bass, and

American soprano Evelyn Lear.
—Ingrid Steger makes her American
debut in the title role of Richard Strauss's
Elektra, and the veteran mezzo Irene Dalis
returns as Klytemnestra.
—Benjamin Britten's Peter Grimes
appears on the Opera House stage for the
first time under the direction of veteran
Mozartean baritone Sir Geraint Evans; Jess
Thomas plays the title role, and British
soprano Ava June debuts as Ellen Orford.
—The perennial favorite, Verdi's La
Traviata, is this year's vehicle for the
ever-dazzling Beverly Sills. Polish tenor
Wieslaw Ochman and Italian baritone
Gianpiero Mastromei join Sills in what will
certainly be a splendid production.
—Another Verdi favorite, Don Carlo,
features England's superlative mezzo,
Josephine Veasey, as Princess Eboli, and
Martti Talvela as Philip 11, the greatest of
the Verdi bass roles.
—Finally, a young, international cast,
headed by Spanish tenor Jose Carreras, will
present the ever-popular La Boheme.
Standing Room Only
While most performances have already
been sold out, there are always standing
room tickets available for every
performance. Standing room is inexpensive
— $3.00 — and, during such fine opera
performances standing for more than three
hours is not at all tiring.
To increase your enjoyment, borrow a
copy of one of the several general works on
opera, such as the Milton Cross or the
Victor book, and read the story.
Recordings of all of these operas are
available at the listening library in UGLY.
Above all, don't allow the months of
October and November to pass without
having attended at least one of these
outstanding productions of the San
Francisco Opera, recognized as one of the
great companies of the world.
SAN FRANCISCO—Writing a review of
an opera which has already given its final
performance might be viewed as a frivolous
exercise; one would certainly be hard put
to justify an ex post facto critique of a
mediocre or disappointing production. The
San Francisco Opera's new production of
Verdi's Rigoletto, however, did not
disappoint — in fact, it exhilarated and
inspired. Rigoletto is but a harbinger of
great opera still in the offing, and ample
insurance that the culturally-starved
individual who visits the War Memorial
Opera House before the final performance
of the current season will be exposed to a
superlative eveing of opera.
The beauty of Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's
production lay in its command of all of the
components of opera. Not only did the
cast fill the hall with rich musical tones;
the singers offered fine portrayals of the
story's powerful drama. Ponnelle
surrounded his stars with stunning sets and
a superlative chorus and demonstrated in
his interpretation of the Verdian tragedy
the directorial genius with which he has
achieved world fame.
Traditionally, the curtain rises on the
Duke's court after the orchestra has
performed the somber and forbidding
overture. Ponnelle, however, lifted the
curtain as the overture began and revealed
Rigoletto mourning over the body of his
daughter.
Confrontation
The entire opera thus became a
flashback, Rigoletto's recollection of the
events which led up to Gilda's untimely
death. With the overture's final chord,
Rigoletto spun around and confronted a
stunning tableau of the Duke's court. The
audience was struck by the imagery of the
leering courtiers and tapestries, all in
shades of a vermillion which reeked of
aristocratic decadence.

Ponnelle continued to display his
mastery of visual effect throughout the
opera. In contrast to the ruddiness of the
court, he designed Rigoletto's cottage in
pristine and verdant shades. He juxtaposed
dark, ominous stone and wood with
brilliant lighting effects to create the inn of
the assassin Sparafucile.
As director he manipulated the chorus
to great advantage: courtiers emerged
instantaneously from tapestries and
menaced the Duke with attempts to
glimpse his amorous adventures.
Visual, Musical Delights
These visual delights, however, did not
outshine the musical and dramatic
performances, particularly those of the
three principals.
Giacomo Aragall, in his San Francisco
debut, applied his vocal talents to the role
of the Duke. The young Spanish tenor has
been lauded for his superb high register; in
this production, however, he shied away
from some of the upper reaches of the role
and sang in other ranges with apparent
tension and slightly flawed pitch control.
Nevertheless, his voice is exquisitely
rich, especially in its middle range. His
vocal performance had many beautiful
moments, and he acted comfortably and
with conviction.
Surprising Soprano
The greatest surprise of the evening was
Izabella Nawe, making her American debut
in the role of Gilda. Nawe possesses a light
and clear voice which sparkles in its upper
reaches. She executed the difficult
coloratura passages with impressive
precision.
Except for occasional spurts of heavy
vibrato, the young East German soprano
dazzled with vocal and dramatic brilliance
and gave San Francisco a Gilda to
remember.
