# Law Office Provides Free Legal Counseling
## 
### JOHN FREED 
Attorneys and Stanford law
students began offering free legal
advice to students at the Legal
Counseling Office (LCO), which
opened yesterday.
The office, located at 324 Old
Union, is manned by five practicing
attorneys and 10 law school students.
Glen Schofield, the lawyer
co-ordinating the program, says the
LCO will deal in many aspects of the
relationship between students here and
the law.
"Our office is the first step for
anyone with a legal hassle," he
explained. "We will also be working in
preventive law, really a new field for
this type of service."
"Preventive law," he explained, is
an attempt to analyze the possible
consequences of an act, such as signing
a contract, before the student engages
in the act. Schofield added that only
middle-income persons can normally
get such advice.
Barbara Lane, a law student here
and member of the LCO policy board,

said that the program will be flexible,
at least in its initial stages.
"We have to see what the demand is
at the office before the overall policy
is established. A lot depends on who
comes in and what they want done,"
she said.
Schofield said that, while the office
will represent some students in court,
LCO will not take on every case.
"We won't take cases that will
clearly interrupt our ability to offer
counseling or advice," he stated.
He added, however, "that might
change in the future if we find most
people want legal representation."
Unique
Schofield noted that LCO is
probably unique in allowing direct
participation of law students.
"I'm not aware of any university
with a program quite like this one. At
some places, they use law students as a
function of the law school —
education for law school students.
They run it for the law students'
benefit, not for the student body," he
