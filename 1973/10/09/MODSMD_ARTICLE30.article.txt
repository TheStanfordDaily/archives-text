# Art Museum Affords Education And Enjoyment
## 
### BARBARA HEINS 
Although most Stanford
students don't seem to know
where it is, the Stanford
University Museum houses a
collection of beautiful art works.
The museum serves to enrich the
entire Bay Area with its fine
collections and educational
programs as well as acting as an
anthropological laboratory.
The museum, which was
occupied within a year after the
first Stanford classes met in 1891,
was created and supported for a
long time through the personal
income of Jane Lathrop Stanford.
Today it is open on a
year-round basis, averaging over
40,000 visitors a year. With its
adjunct, the Thomas Welton
Stanford Art Gallery, temporary
exhibitions on loan from other
institutions or collectors, and
from the museum's permanent
collection, are shown throughout
the year for periods of about two
months.
The Sarah Love Miedel Room
and Marie Stauffer Sigall gallery
are specifically for exhibition of
temporary shows. Over the last
few years the exhibitions have
been on such varied subjects as
"Twentieth Century Chinese
Painting." "Old Master
Drawings," "Propaganda Posters
for War, Revolution and Peace,"
and "Toulouse-Latrec Prints."
The Sarah Love Miedel Room
presently houses an exhibition on
"The Arts of Venice in the 18th
Century" while the arts of India
are exhibited in the art gallery.
Permanent Collection
The permanent collection of
the museum began with Mrs.
Stanford's purchasing of the
Cesnola Collection of Cypriot

pottery from the Metropolitan
Museum of Art in 1896. This
collection includes 5,000 clay,
bronze and stone objects ranging
from the Early Bronze Age to 2nd
Century A.D., a range of 3,000
years. Much of this collection was
damaged in the 1906 earthquake.
The remaining pieces are kept in
the museum's basement for
purposes of study.
Off the main lobby, the
Stanford room contains various
objects collected by Leland
Stanford Jr. as a child; as well as
characteristic objects of the life of
the Stanfords and San Francisco
at the end of the 19th century.
Historical Treasures
The museum was initially
conceived of by Mrs. Stanford to
house this collection which
reflects the beginning of the
University and the history of the
area.
Adjacent to the Stanford room
is the anthropologic area
containing works from North and
Central America, Oceania, Africa.
New Guinea as well as an
extensive collection of Native
American Indian relics, pottery,
and basketry purchased by Mrs.
Stanford.
This newly opened gallery
contains works by the Hopi, Pina,
Plains and Northern California
Indians ranging from Navajo
blankets from 1850 to Pueblo
pitchers dating from 700 A.D.
Sacred images called "santos"
from New Mexico and Colorado
represent saints, the Holy Family,

and the Crucification painted on
gilded wood. A significant recent
acquisition is a large number of
Indian relics from the
Stanford-Palo Alto area recovered
by the Stanford department of
archaeology which began digging
in 1948.
European Art
Across the lobby is the
European paintings collection.
Begun by Thomas W. Stanford,
brother of Leland, this collection
also contains ikons, ceramics,
sculpture and jewelry. The walls
are hung with many paintings
including fine works by Filippino

Lippi, Felix Maria Dioggs, Henry
Fuseli and William Blake.
The Ikeda Collection of
Oriental art was purchased in
1904 by Mrs. Stanford and, with
the Leventritt Collection, it forms
the base of an extensive collection
of Chinese, Japanese, Korean and
East Indian art. This is one of the
most beautiful collections in the
museum.
The Oriental exhibition covers
several rooms and contains such
objects as the Leventritt and
Marshall Collection of Chinese
bronzes of the Shang and Chou
Dynasties dating from 1523 B.C.

The Marcus Collection of Oriental
Mirrors is one of the finest in
America.
The collection also includes
enamels of the Japanese Edo
Period (1615-1868), Korean
ceramics from the Ist century,
and the reknowned Frank E. Buck
jade collection.
Much of the Egyptian
collection was destroyed in the
earthquake but, according to
Anita Mozley, Museum Registrar
and Curator of Photography, the
museum hopes to set up an
Egyptian exhibition room in the
future. The collection contains a

coffin with a mummy from the
26th Dynasty of Egypt (663-525
8.C.) and various beautiful
limestone reliefs and smaller
sculptures.
The same room houses the
Classical collection, made up of
pieces from the Cesnola
collection, Roman vases dating
from 25,000 8.C., several Attic
calyx kraters (bowls for mixing
wine and water), and marble
sculptures of heads and torsos.
The collection upstairs consists
of a room of contemporary art
including works by Robert
Indiana, Frank Stella and Sam
Francis; and a room of African
masks, weapons and headdresses.
Recent Acquisitions
The museum collections are
constantly supplemented by
bequests, gifts and purchases by
the Committee for Art at
Stanford. Recent accessions have
included English Neo-Classical
paintings by Gavin and Hamilton,
paintings by William Blake and
James Turner, drawings by
Theodore Gericault and Honore
Daumier representing the 18th

and 19th centuries.
Expressionist works by Emil
Nolde, Wassily Kandinsky, Max
Beckmann and Oscar Kokoscha
lead to the contemporary works
of the 20th century by Paul
Jenkins, Jean Weinbaum and
others.
Graphics by Lucas Cranach and
Albrecht Durer, Eugene
Delacroix, Edouard Manet and
Pablo Picasso have been acquired
recently by the museum along
with several documents, Greek
and Roman coins and sculpture,
and African, Melanesian and
North American Indian art.
Educational Programs
In 1970 the Committee for Art
at Stanford sponsored the
Educational Program under the
direction of Educational Curator,
Carol Hay. Trained volunteer

guides (docents), conduct
scheduled tours of the museum.
Since its inception in 1968
roughly 38,000 people have taken
these tours.
Plans are being made to create
room in the museum itself for art
lectures sometime in the future.
The educational program is an
attept to "reach out into ihp
community." Regular docent
tours are offered to the public
each Tuesday at 12:30.
The museum also serves as an
instrument for study. The
basement of the museum is a
virtual laboratory for students of
archaeology, anthropology and art
history. Students, under the
direction of Professor Isabel
Raubitschek, studv, catalog and
piece together broken vases, old
coins, statuary much of which was

damaged during the earthquake
and has to be repaired and made
earthquake proof.
This function of the museum
reaches beyond the Stanford
community. The collections in the
basement are used by many other
universities and scholars and is an
excellent laboratory' for teaching
students through actual
experience with the art works.
The museum also has a loan
system through which it loans
paintings to various departments
of the university.
The Stanford Museum of Art is
a multi-functional,
richly-resourced facility. Unlike
many art museums it is small
enough not to be overwhelming
and its art work is varied and of
fine quality.

Although most Stanford
students don't seem to know
where it is, the Stanford
University Museum houses a
collection of beautiful art works.
The museum serves to enrich the
entire Bay Area with its fine
collections and educational
programs as well as acting as an
anthropological laboratory.
The museum, which was
occupied within a year after the
first Stanford classes met in 1891,
was created and supported for a
long time through the personal
income of Jane Lathrop Stanford.
Today it is open on a
year-round basis, averaging over
40,000 visitors a year. With its
adjunct, the Thomas Welton
Stanford Art Gallery, temporary
exhibitions on loan from other
institutions or collectors, and
from the museum's permanent
collection, are shown throughout
the year for periods of about two
months.
The Sarah Love Miedel Room
and Marie Stauffer Sigall gallery
are specifically for exhibition of
temporary shows. Over the last
few years the exhibitions have
been on such varied subjects as
"Twentieth Century Chinese
Painting." "Old Master
Drawings," "Propaganda Posters
for War, Revolution and Peace,"
and "Toulouse-Latrec Prints."
The Sarah Love Miedel Room
presently houses an exhibition on
"The Arts of Venice in the 18th
Century" while the arts of India
are exhibited in the art gallery.
Permanent Collection
The permanent collection of
the museum began with Mrs.
Stanford's purchasing of the
Cesnola Collection of Cypriot

pottery from the Metropolitan
Museum of Art in 1896. This
collection includes 5,000 clay,
bronze and stone objects ranging
from the Early Bronze Age to 2nd
Century A.D., a range of 3,000
years. Much of this collection was
damaged in the 1906 earthquake.
The remaining pieces are kept in
the museum's basement for
purposes of study.
Off the main lobby, the
Stanford room contains various
objects collected by Leland
Stanford Jr. as a child; as well as
characteristic objects of the life of
the Stanfords and San Francisco
at the end of the 19th century.
Historical Treasures
The museum was initially
conceived of by Mrs. Stanford to
house this collection which
reflects the beginning of the

This newly opened gallery
contains works by the Hopi, Pina,
Plains and Northern California
Indians ranging from Navajo
blankets from 1850 to Pueblo
pitchers dating from 700 A.D.
Sacred images called "santos"
from New Mexico and Colorado
represent saints, the Holy Family,

and the Crucification painted on
gilded wood. A significant recent
acquisition is a large number of
Indian relics from the
Stanford-Palo Alto area recovered
by the Stanford department of
archaeology which began digging
in 1948.
European Art
Across the lobby is the
European paintings collection.
Begun by Thomas W. Stanford,
brother of Leland, this collection
also contains ikons, ceramics,
sculpture and jewelry. The walls
are hung with many paintings
including fine works by Filippino

Lippi, Felix Maria Dioggs, Henry
Fuseli and William Blake.
The Ikeda Collection of
Oriental art was purchased in
1904 by Mrs. Stanford and, with
the Leventritt Collection, it forms
the base of an extensive collection
of Chinese, Japanese, Korean and
East Indian art. This is one of the
most beautiful collections in the
museum.
The Oriental exhibition covers
several rooms and contains such
objects as the Leventritt and
Marshall Collection of Chinese
bronzes of the Shang and Chou
Dynasties dating from 1523 B.C.

The Marcus Collection of Oriental
Mirrors is one of the finest in
America.
The collection also includes
enamels of the Japanese Edo
Period (1615-1868), Korean
ceramics from the Ist century,
and the reknowned Frank E. Buck
jade collection.
Much of the Egyptian
collection was destroyed in the
earthquake but, according to
Anita Mozley, Museum Registrar
and Curator of Photography, the
museum hopes to set up an
Egyptian exhibition room in the
future. The collection contains a

coffin with a mummy from the
26th Dynasty of Egypt (663-525
8.C.) and various beautiful
limestone reliefs and smaller
sculptures.
The same room houses the
Classical collection, made up of
pieces from the Cesnola
collection, Roman vases dating
from 25,000 8.C., several Attic
calyx kraters (bowls for mixing
wine and water), and marble
sculptures of heads and torsos.
The collection upstairs consists
of a room of contemporary art
including works by Robert
Indiana, Frank Stella and Sam
Francis; and a room of African
masks, weapons and headdresses.
Recent Acquisitions
The museum collections are
constantly supplemented by
bequests, gifts and purchases by
the Committee for Art at
Stanford. Recent accessions have
included English Neo-Classical
paintings by Gavin and Hamilton,
paintings by William Blake and
James Turner, drawings by
Theodore Gericault and Honore
Daumier representing the 18th

Expressionist works by Emil
Nolde, Wassily Kandinsky, Max
Beckmann and Oscar Kokoscha
lead to the contemporary works
of the 20th century by Paul
Jenkins, Jean Weinbaum and
others.
Graphics by Lucas Cranach and
Albrecht Durer, Eugene
Delacroix, Edouard Manet and
Pablo Picasso have been acquired
recently by the museum along

North American Indian art.
Educational Programs
In 1970 the Committee for Art

direction of Educational Curator,
Carol Hay. Trained volunteer

guides (docents), conduct
scheduled tours of the museum.
Since its inception in 1968
roughly 38,000 people have taken
these tours.
Plans are being made to create
room in the museum itself for art
lectures sometime in the future.
The educational program is an
attept to "reach out into ihp
community." Regular docent
tours are offered to the public
each Tuesday at 12:30.
The museum also serves as an

Stanford. Recent accessions have
included English Neo-Classical
paintings by Gavin and Hamilton,
paintings by William Blake and
James Turner, drawings by
Theodore Gericault and Honore

Although most Stanford
students don't seem to know
where it is, the Stanford
University Museum houses a
collection of beautiful art works.
The museum serves to enrich the
entire Bay Area with its fine
collections and educational
programs as well as acting as an
anthropological laboratory.
The museum, which was
occupied within a year after the
first Stanford classes met in 1891,
was created and supported for a
long time through the personal
income of Jane Lathrop Stanford.
Today it is open on a
year-round basis, averaging over
40,000 visitors a year. With its
adjunct, the Thomas Welton
Stanford Art Gallery, temporary
exhibitions on loan from other
institutions or collectors, and
from the museum's permanent
collection, are shown throughout
the year for periods of about two
months.
The Sarah Love Miedel Room
and Marie Stauffer Sigall gallery
are specifically for exhibition of
temporary shows. Over the last
few years the exhibitions have
been on such varied subjects as
"Twentieth Century Chinese
Painting." "Old Master
Drawings," "Propaganda Posters
for War, Revolution and Peace,"
and "Toulouse-Latrec Prints."
The Sarah Love Miedel Room

years. Much of this collection was
damaged in the 1906 earthquake.
The remaining pieces are kept in
the museum's basement for
purposes of study.
Off the main lobby, the

the Leventritt Collection, it forms
the base of an extensive collection
of Chinese, Japanese, Korean and
East Indian art. This is one of the

Egyptian exhibition room in the
future. The collection contains a

coffin with a mummy from the
26th Dynasty of Egypt (663-525

the base of an extensive collection
of Chinese, Japanese, Korean and
East Indian art. This is one of the
most beautiful collections in the
museum.
The Oriental exhibition covers
several rooms and contains such

and Curator of Photography, the
museum hopes to set up an
Egyptian exhibition room in the
future. The collection contains a

coffin with a mummy from the
26th Dynasty of Egypt (663-525
8.C.) and various beautiful
limestone reliefs and smaller
sculptures.
The same room houses the
Classical collection, made up of
pieces from the Cesnola
collection, Roman vases dating
from 25,000 8.C., several Attic
calyx kraters (bowls for mixing
wine and water), and marble
sculptures of heads and torsos.
The collection upstairs consists
of a room of contemporary art
including works by Robert
Indiana, Frank Stella and Sam
Francis; and a room of African
masks, weapons and headdresses.
Recent Acquisitions
The museum collections are
constantly supplemented by
bequests, gifts and purchases by
the Committee for Art at
Stanford. Recent accessions have
included English Neo-Classical
paintings by Gavin and Hamilton,
paintings by William Blake and
James Turner, drawings by
Theodore Gericault and Honore
Daumier representing the 18th

and 19th centuries.
Expressionist works by Emil
Nolde, Wassily Kandinsky, Max
Beckmann and Oscar Kokoscha
lead to the contemporary works
of the 20th century by Paul
Jenkins, Jean Weinbaum and
others.
Graphics by Lucas Cranach and
Albrecht Durer, Eugene
Delacroix, Edouard Manet and
Pablo Picasso have been acquired
recently by the museum along
with several documents, Greek
and Roman coins and sculpture,

North American Indian art.
Educational Programs
In 1970 the Committee for Art
at Stanford sponsored the
Educational Program under the
direction of Educational Curator,
Carol Hay. Trained volunteer

guides (docents), conduct
scheduled tours of the museum.
Since its inception in 1968
roughly 38,000 people have taken
these tours.
Plans are being made to create
room in the museum itself for art
lectures sometime in the future.
The educational program is an
attept to "reach out into ihp
community." Regular docent
tours are offered to the public
each Tuesday at 12:30.
The museum also serves as an
instrument for study. The
basement of the museum is a
virtual laboratory for students of
archaeology, anthropology and art
history. Students, under the
direction of Professor Isabel
Raubitschek, studv, catalog and
piece together broken vases, old
coins, statuary much of which was

damaged during the earthquake
and has to be repaired and made
earthquake proof.
This function of the museum
reaches beyond the Stanford
community. The collections in the
basement are used by many other
universities and scholars and is an
excellent laboratory' for teaching
students through actual
experience with the art works.
The museum also has a loan
system through which it loans
paintings to various departments
of the university.
The Stanford Museum of Art is
a multi-functional,
richly-resourced facility. Unlike
many art museums it is small
enough not to be overwhelming
and its art work is varied and of
fine quality.

Although most Stanford
students don't seem to know
where it is, the Stanford
University Museum houses a
collection of beautiful art works.
The museum serves to enrich the
entire Bay Area with its fine
collections and educational
programs as well as acting as an
anthropological laboratory.
The museum, which was
occupied within a year after the
first Stanford classes met in 1891,
was created and supported for a
long time through the personal
income of Jane Lathrop Stanford.
Today it is open on a
year-round basis, averaging over
40,000 visitors a year. With its
adjunct, the Thomas Welton
Stanford Art Gallery, temporary
exhibitions on loan from other
institutions or collectors, and
from the museum's permanent
collection, are shown throughout
the year for periods of about two
months.
The Sarah Love Miedel Room
and Marie Stauffer Sigall gallery
are specifically for exhibition of
temporary shows. Over the last
few years the exhibitions have
been on such varied subjects as
"Twentieth Century Chinese
Painting." "Old Master
Drawings," "Propaganda Posters
for War, Revolution and Peace,"
and "Toulouse-Latrec Prints."
The Sarah Love Miedel Room
presently houses an exhibition on
"The Arts of Venice in the 18th
Century" while the arts of India
are exhibited in the art gallery.
Permanent Collection

Museum of Art in 1896. This
collection includes 5,000 clay,
bronze and stone objects ranging
from the Early Bronze Age to 2nd
Century A.D., a range of 3,000
years. Much of this collection was
damaged in the 1906 earthquake.
The remaining pieces are kept in
the museum's basement for
purposes of study.
Off the main lobby, the
Stanford room contains various
objects collected by Leland
Stanford Jr. as a child; as well as
characteristic objects of the life of
the Stanfords and San Francisco
at the end of the 19th century.
Historical Treasures
The museum was initially
conceived of by Mrs. Stanford to
house this collection which
reflects the beginning of the
University and the history of the
area.
