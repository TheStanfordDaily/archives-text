# Enthusiastic Lamplighters Deliver Delightful 'Mikado'
## 
### MICHAEL SAFFLE 
San Francisco's Lamplighters
opened their 22nd season
Saturday night with a fine, if not
yet fully polished. Mikado at the
Presentation Theatre.
Gilbert and Sullivan's
delightful comic operas have never
been as popular in America as in
England. But Sullivan's music,
reminiscent of Offenbach and
Gounod, is everything it needs to
be and more. A good Mikado
can't help but reap laughs and
applause, and the Lamplighter's
audience responded with
characteristic enthusiasm
Saturday.
A local troupe, operating under
the sponsorship of the Opera West
Foundation, the Lamplighters
deliver G & S with attractive sets
and costumes, a solid (if
sometimes careless) chorus, and a
tolerable orchestra.
The principal players,
volunteers all, are local singers and
actors filled with that enthusiasm
more valuable than cold-blooded
expertise. They get results.
Actors and instrumentalists
improved as they shed their
op. ning-night jitters. Randolph
Hunt led the troupe's orchestra
(lacking two-thirds of the players
the score requires) through a
nerveless and stilted overture; for
a moment this reviewer feared he
might be trapped in the G & S
equivalent of a grade-school
parents' night.
But the curtain rose on a lovely
set Hiroshige might have designed,
the chorus let loose a vigorous
"Gentlemen of Japan," and
everybody began enjoying
themselves.
Gilbert's story of the ancient
east revolves around a wandering
minstrel (Nanki-Poo), his
schoolgirl sweetheart (Yum-Yum),
her lecherous guardian who holds
the title of Lord High Executioner
(Ko-Ko), and assorted nobles,
ingenues, and a regal Mikado
whose son is actually Nanki-Poo is
disguise.
Michael Epstein's Nanki-Poo
was competent, though his tenor
voice lacked the strength

additional performances will
probably help him find. Gilbert
Russak's Ko-Ko, on the other
hand, was a fully-developed
delight; every song and gesture
was hilarious.
The famous "three little
maids" were pretty and
appropriately saccharine. Kristine
Kent's Yum-Yum was sweet if
somewhat inaudible.
But every joke came off (the
first act's stuffed with them!),
including a few topical changes
this reviewer doesn't want to give
away.
The second act featured an
improved orchestra, stronger
singing, and a few numbers that
would have brought down any

house. John Ziaja's Mikado was
full-voiced, uproariously acted,
and magnificently costumed; his
"A More Humane Mikado" was
the musical highlight of the
evening.
Audience response was fervent
after a finale which leaves
everybody happy except Ko-Ko,
Katisha's new (and justly
miserable) husband. The
Lamplighters' show could only be
called a resounding success, in spite
of some minor opening night
problems.
The Mikado will be performed
weekends until Nov. 10. See it
and get a taste of what too many
"sophisticated" Americans are
missing.
