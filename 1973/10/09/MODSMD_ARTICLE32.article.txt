Spies Summoned To Hearings
WASHINGTON — The Senate Watergate hearings
resume today with two Nixon campaign undercover
agents on the witness schedule.
Summoned to testify at the morning session was
Michael W. McMinoway, who has been identified in
news reports as Sedan Chair Two, an agent who
infiltrated the campaign organization of Sen. Hubert
H. Humphrey when the Minnesota Democrat was
seeking his party's presidential nomination in 1972.
The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, which connected
McMinoway with the Sedan Chair codename, said
the 26-year-old Louisville private detective was
hired by President Nixon's re-election committee to
work in Humphrey's Pennsylvania and California
primary campaigns.
The newspaper later reported that McMinoway
posed as a volunteer security agent at the
Democratic National Convention in Miami Beach,
Fla., and overheard Sen. George McGovern's
campaign director discussing the health of Sen.
Thomas F. Eagleton before Eagleton was picked as
McGovern's running mate.
Eagleton was later dropped from the ticket after
his hospitalization for mental problems was
disclosed.
Following McMinoway, the Senate committee
will hear from John Buckley, another private
investigator, who was reported to have infiltrated
Sen. Edmund S. Muskie's campaign headquarters in
Washington.
Watergate conspirator E. Howard Hunt testified
that G. Gordon Liddy sent him to meet a man he
knew as "Fat Jack" who turned over to Hunt
"photographically stolen" documents from Muskie
headquarters.
Hunt identified Buckley as "Fat Jack" and said

he delivered cash to Buckley to pay for the
photographs.
Justice Department Denies Leaks
WASHINGTON — The Justice Department said
yesterday top officials would testify under oath that
the department had not conducted a campaign to
discredit Vice President Spiro T. Agnew by leaking
information about the investigation of the vice
president to newsmen.
The department said it would not contest
attempts by Agnew's attorneys to subpoena
department officials to give sworn depositions about
Agnew's allegations.
In a 17-page brief, department attorneys
objected strongly to subpoenas issued by Agnew's
lawyers to newsmen who have written stories based
on confidential information. The department called
those subpoenas "fishing expeditions" and said they
should not be condoned.
The department said the charges of news leaks
were "legally irrelevant" and provided no basis for
halting the investigation as Agnew has demanded.
The department said it did not feel Agnew's
lawyers were justified in subpoenaing department
officials but said it was willing to make them
available for testimony.
The department has not confirmed or denied
reports that subpoenas were delivered to certain
officials on Friday and it did not do so in the brief
filed with U.S. District Court Judge Walter E.
Hoffman.
Hoffman granted Agnew's lawyers' request for
subpoena power to command testimony from
Justice Department officials and newsmen in a
search for evidence to support the lawyers' charge
that the department engaged "in a steady campaign

of statements to the press" in an effort to prejudice
the grand jury investigation against the vice
president.
Texas Suspects Plead Innocent
HOUSTON, Tex. — Two teenagers pleaded
innocent Monday to murder charges in the Houston
mass murders in which 27 young males were slain.
Elmer Wayne Henley, 17, and David Owen
Brooks, 18, said "not guilty" after each of the six
indictments against Henley and four against Brooks
were read by District Court Judge William Hatten.
Hatten set trial dates of Jan. 14 for Henley and
March 4 for Brooks.
Henley's lawyer, Charles Melder, has not revealed
his plans for defense. Ted Musick, Brooks' lawyer,
indicated he will plead that his client was insane and
will ask for the trial to be moved out of Houston if
his client is found sane.
"I don't believe we can get a fair trial here,"
Musick said, "but then I'm not sure where we can."
The case was given wide publicity as the worst
mass murder in the nation's history.
Brown Challenges Reagan
LOS ANGELES — Gov. Ronald Reagan was
challenged yesterday by former Gov. Edmund G.
Brown to "face-to-face, man-to-man" debates on
Prop. 1, the Reagan-sponsored tax limitation
initiative.
Brown, who was defeated by Reagan in 1966,
said he wanted to debate the issue in a series of
statewide television confrontations.
Prop. 1 would establish a sliding scale ceiling on
the total amount of money which the state
government could collect in taxes in any given year.
Opponents contend the measure would shift more
of the tax burden to local governments with
property taxes being increased.
Brown told Reagan in a telegram that "major
television and radio stations in various parts of the
state have indicated they would, as a public service,
provide facilities for no-holds-barred confrontations
between us."
Edwin Gray, a spokesman for Reagan, said there
would be no immediate reply to Brown's challenge.
"We have not received that telegram as of yet, so
we do not know the specifics of the proposal. Until
we do receive it, we find it hard to have any
reaction to it," said Gray, who is on leave from his
post as Reagan's press secretary.
Mets Win
NEW YORK — Rusty Staub hit two home runs,
leading the New York Mets to a 9-2 triumph over
the Cincinnati Reds yesterday in a wild,
brawl-marred third game of the 1973 National
League baseball playoffs.
The victory gave the Mets a 2-1 lead in the
best-of-five playoffs and left New York one victory
short of earning a World Series berth.
Oakland Rained Out
OAKLAND — Yesterday's third game of the
American League baseball playoffs between the
Baltimore Orioles and Oakland Athletics was
postponed by rain and was rescheduled for today at
6:30 p.m.
The teams are tied with one victory each in the
best-of-five playoffs.
