# UPSE Work Goes On
## 
### BILL CORTES 
The Undergraduate Program of the School of
Education (UPSE) is alive and well, according to
Director Jane Huseby.
The program, which is designed to integrate the
practical and theoretical aspects of education,
involves undergraduates in fieldwork in local
schools.
Students work as teachers and counselors under
the supervision of school administrators and receive
from two to four units of credit.
Four faculty members of the School of
Education, Profs. David Tyack, Fannie Schaftel,
Henry Levin, and Decker Walker, coordinate UPSE
and serve as liaison between Stanford students and
community schools.
In addition, three graduate teaching assistants
participate in the actual direction of individual
projects.
The behind the program is to allow
undergraduates the opportunity to explore those
areas of education that are of the most interest to
them.
Past projects have included teaching photography
and reading classes, counseling children with
psychological problems, and writing an algebra
textbook.

However, future plans for UPSE also include
securing a niche in the intellectual life of the
university. Tyack hopes to develop an
inter-disciplinary "liberal arts approach to
education" that will involve the sociology,
anthropology, history, and other related
departments in a complete undergraduate course of
study on the field.
The program was founded in the spring of 1972
when the Stanford Center for Innovation in
Research and Education proposed the creation of an
undergraduate workshop in education. It was
funded by the University Fellows during the
1972-73 academic year with the support of a Ford
Foundation grant.
The Office of Undergraduate Studies assumed
financial responsibility for UPSE for the current
year and was forced to fund the program at only
half of last year's level. As a result, innovation has
been negligible and the staff has had to maintain a
"holding pattern."
However, the tremendous success of the program
gives them cause to believe that it will be continued.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies James Gibbs
believes UPSE is a "very good" program and would
like to see its permanent incorporation within the
School of Education.
