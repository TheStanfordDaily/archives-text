# Contradictory Mid East Reports Leave Student Opinions Mixed
## 
### JANET SANDERS 
Most Stanford students, befuddled
by conflicting news reports on the
Middle East war, are cautiously shying
away from taking sides until more
information is available.
"I don't know enough about the

situation there yet to be other than
neutral," said graduate student Joen
Greenstein. "Both nations are making
contradictory claims."
"It is like Vietnam," said graduate
student Paul Skagger. "It's hard to
determine who is right."
Besides a handful of foreign
students, however, most of the 40
persons surveyed expressed
moderately pro-Israel leanings,
although some said that their support
for the nation had declined in recent
years.
'Lying'
"I've always been for Israel,
thinking it was the underdog," said
freshman Dave Hawes. "But lately I've
decided that both sides are lying."
"I'm less in sympathy with Israel
than I used to be," said graduate
student Alan Borning. "They're
beginning to look more and more
militarily and economically
imperialistic."
"The Israelis have acted more than
imperialistically," added Farid Nabti, a
strongly pro-Arab graduate student.
"Their actions stem from fascism and
arrogance."
Several students feel that Israel
should give up the land it had won in

the 1967 Six Day War. The two areas,
Golan Heights and Sinai Peninsula,
were the major targets for the Arab
offensive three days ago.
More Land
"It is difficult to view the recent
outbreak as an act of Arab
aggression," said junior Ron Hopkins,
"when the Arabs are just trying to
regain the land they lost five years
ago."
"Although I sympathize with the
Israelis, they should give up some of
the land they have captured,
particularly the Sinai Peninsula," said
Freshman Jeff Little.
Almost all of those surveyed
thought that the United States should
adopt a neutral position because they
feared a superpower confrontation
with Russia or the beginning of
another Vietnam War.
"Let them fight it out themselves,"
said freshman Louie Quintana.
Cut Supplies
"We should stop supplying Israel
with arms," said graduate student
Steven Plouvier, who labelled the
superpowers "the club of killers who
make wars like the Middle East
possible."
