# Faculty, Resident Complaints Effective; University Offers To Finance Signals
## 
### BOB LOWE 
Stanford has offered to help Santa
Clara County pay for one or two signal
lights on Junipero Serra Boulevard
following faculty protests about the
allegedly unsafe road.
In a letter addressed to Natalie
Dickens of the Stanford Campus
Home Owners Association (SCHOA),
University Vi<re President Robert
Augsburger said that he had met with
county Supervisor Victor Calvo and
"discussed the desirability of installing
one or more traffic signals along
Junipero Serra Boulevard."
Augsburger added that if the signals
are approved, "it would take a
minimum of six months for such a
move to be accomplished."
Augsburger noted that other efforts
were being taken to improve the
quality *>112 the present road. Patrols
enforcing the 35 miles per hour speed
limit are being increased and work on
a bicycle path begins this week.
Augsburger indicated that the
University supports the eventual
relocation of Junipero Serra "on an

alignment south of the present
Junipero Serra Boulevard. This would
enable the present road to be
converted into an internal artery
representing the southern portion of
the Campus Drive loop, as set forth in
the University's long-range roadway
plan," he said.
Rejected
The University advocated a similar
position in the early 60s but was
rejected by the county because of
expense.
Augsburger's letter came in
response to concerned residents living
in the vicinity of the Junipero Serra —
Santa Maria Avenue intersection.
Following an accident two weeks
ago which resulted in the deaths of
two 19-year-old Palo Alto men, two
residents' committees were formed.
One is pushing for safety measures on
Junipero Serra and the other concerns
itself with Santa Maria.
The Santa Maria intersection is part
of the three-eighths mile stretch of
Junipero Serra where six people have
died in three and a half years.

Art Prof. Nathan Oliveira has been
at the forefront of the homeowners'
efforts to improve Junipero Serra and
is presently in charge of the Santa
Maria committee. He said he was
pleased by the University's actions and
that "the letter is the first official
recognition of the difficulties on the
boulevard."
'Ridiculous'
"The important thing is that the
University is taking a position," he
said, although he called the six month
time lag for installing the traffic signals
"ridiculous."
The Santa Maria committee is
working to close the Santa Maria
entrance to campus. On Sept. 28, a
letter was sent to 185 residents in the
area, stating that the committee
wished to take the necessary action to
have Santa Maria closed. The letter
requested dissenters to send a reply to
Oliveira by Wednesday.
If there is not too much opposition
among the residents, the SCHOA
board will probably support the plan
at an Oct. 17 meeting.

enable the present road to be
converted into an internal artery
representing the southern portion of
the Campus Drive loop, as set forth in
the University's long-range roadway
plan," he said.
Rejected
The University advocated a similar
position in the early 60s but was
rejected by the county because of
expense.
Augsburger's letter came in
response to concerned residents living
in the vicinity of the Junipero Serra —
Santa Maria Avenue intersection.
Following an accident two weeks
ago which resulted in the deaths of
two 19-year-old Palo Alto men, two
residents' committees were formed.
One is pushing for safety measures on
Junipero Serra and the other concerns
itself with Santa Maria.
The Santa Maria intersection is part
of the three-eighths mile stretch of
Junipero Serra where six people have
died in three and a half years.

Art Prof. Nathan Oliveira has been
at the forefront of the homeowners'
efforts to improve Junipero Serra and
is presently in charge of the Santa
Maria committee. He said he was
pleased by the University's actions and
that "the letter is the first official
recognition of the difficulties on the
boulevard."
'Ridiculous'
"The important thing is that the
University is taking a position," he
said, although he called the six month
time lag for installing the traffic signals
"ridiculous."
The Santa Maria committee is
working to close the Santa Maria
entrance to campus. On Sept. 28, a
letter was sent to 185 residents in the
area, stating that the committee
wished to take the necessary action to
have Santa Maria closed. The letter
requested dissenters to send a reply to
Oliveira by Wednesday.
If there is not too much opposition
among the residents, the SCHOA
board will probably support the plan
at an Oct. 17 meeting.
Stanford has offered to help Santa
Clara County pay for one or two signal
lights on Junipero Serra Boulevard
following faculty protests about the
allegedly unsafe road.
In a letter addressed to Natalie
Dickens of the Stanford Campus
Home Owners Association (SCHOA),
University Vi<re President Robert
Augsburger said that he had met with
county Supervisor Victor Calvo and
"discussed the desirability of installing
one or more traffic signals along
Junipero Serra Boulevard."
Augsburger added that if the signals
are approved, "it would take a
minimum of six months for such a
move to be accomplished."
Augsburger noted that other efforts
were being taken to improve the
quality *>112 the present road. Patrols
enforcing the 35 miles per hour speed
limit are being increased and work on
a bicycle path begins this week.
Augsburger indicated that the
University supports the eventual
relocation of Junipero Serra "on an

alignment south of the present
Junipero Serra Boulevard. This would
enable the present road to be
converted into an internal artery
representing the southern portion of
the Campus Drive loop, as set forth in
the University's long-range roadway
plan," he said.
