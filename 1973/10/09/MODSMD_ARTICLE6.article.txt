# SLAC’s Panofsky: Just Your Basic Atom Smasher
## 
### PHILIP FEDER 
In 1938, Princeton University
graduated two brothers, sons of art
historian Edwin Panofsky. One of the
brothers placed first in his graduating
class; the other placed second. They
became known as the "smart
Panofsky" and the "dumb Panofsky."
Wolfgang Kurt Hermann Panofsky
was the "smart Panofsky." Now 54,
the German-born physicist is the
director of the federally-funded
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC), one of the world's most
powerful machines for research.
Panofsky may not fit the
stereotype of a scientist. At 5-2, gray
hair disappearing, coatless with his
shirttail creeping out in back,
Panofsky is anything but the imposing
figure one expects to find lecturing on
the theory of relativity.
One colleague, Political Science
Prof. Hubert Marshall, concedes,
"Certainly Panofsky is disheveled. He
reputedly buys his clothes at Sears,
and he's totally indifferent to the
usual formalities of his profession. He
just knows more than most people and
he works very, very hard."

Inside SLAC's central laboratory
building, where the director's office is
housed, large filing cabinets scream the
message: U.S. GOVERNMENT
PROPERTY - STANFORD
UNIVERSITY.
The sound of IBM Selectric
typewriters provides an aura of
importance, arousing curiosity about
the research conducted in the
10,000-foot accelerator tube sunk 25
feet under closely compacted soil.
Panofsky shuffles around his office,
taking messages, talking on the phone,
smiling broadly as he greets visitors.
He rests comfortably in a cushioned
swivel chair as he talks about himself.
Loyalty Oath
Coming to Stanford from Berkeley
in 1951, Panofsky brought his own
share of publicity with him. The fears
of the McCarthy era caused
administrators at Berkeley to ask their
professors to sign a loyalty oath
swearing they had no connection with
the Communist Party.
Although he signed the oath,
Panofsky felt it was "a violation of my
civil liberties' 1 and left to become an
associate professor of physics and head

of the High Energy Physics Laboratory
here. Nine years later, he took charge
of SLAC.
Although he is a nuclear physicist,
Panofsky is also an activist for bilateral
disarmament of thermonuclear
weapons.
Opposed ABM
In 1969, Panofsky opposed the
ABM Safeguard missiles, testifying
against their deployment before the
Senate Armed Services Committee. He
also debated the ABM issue with
famous nuclear physicist Edward
Teller on television. "I thought the
ABM would have an escalating effect
on the arms race, plus the fact that the
engineering was poor," Panofsky said.
Teller, he said, has always thought
military affairs are the most important
consideration in foreign policy and
"he [Teller] wanted to sweep the
technical matters [of the ABM] aside.
"I asked my son who won the
debate, and he said, 'You both
sounded like Dr. Strangelove,' " said
Panofsky.
Five Children
Panofsky has five children, none of
whom are involved in physics. In fact.

one of his sons is writing his Ph.D.
dissertation on medieval English
literature and another son plays violin
for a symphony orchestra.
While writing his own dissertation
at Cal Tech on X-rays and natural
constants, Panofsky met Adele
Dumond, his professor's daughter, and
married her in July, 1942.
As an international figure, Panofsky
chaired the 1959 conference banning
nuclear tests in outer space and was a
member of another conference
concerning underground nuclear
testing. "Persona grata with the
Russian scientific community,
Panofsky is respected world-wide,"
commented one of the professors at
SLAC, Robert Mozley.
At Stanford, Panofsky spoke at a
demonstration in the spring of 1970
protesting the U.S. invasion of
Cambodia. "1 told them we are an
intellectual community here, and we
should organize within the system to
have educated people working in the
top levels of government. It's
important that the link between
education and government not be
broken," he says.

Loyalty Oath
Coming to Stanford from Berkeley
in 1951, Panofsky brought his own
share of publicity with him. The fears
of the McCarthy era caused
administrators at Berkeley to ask their
professors to sign a loyalty oath
swearing they had no connection with
the Communist Party.
Although he signed the oath,
Panofsky felt it was "a violation of my
civil liberties' 1 and left to become an
associate professor of physics and head

of the High Energy Physics Laboratory
here. Nine years later, he took charge
of SLAC.
Although he is a nuclear physicist,
Panofsky is also an activist for bilateral
disarmament of thermonuclear
weapons.
Opposed ABM
In 1969, Panofsky opposed the
ABM Safeguard missiles, testifying
against their deployment before the
Senate Armed Services Committee. He
also debated the ABM issue with
famous nuclear physicist Edward
Teller on television. "I thought the
ABM would have an escalating effect
on the arms race, plus the fact that the
engineering was poor," Panofsky said.
Teller, he said, has always thought
military affairs are the most important
consideration in foreign policy and
"he [Teller] wanted to sweep the
technical matters [of the ABM] aside.
"I asked my son who won the
debate, and he said, 'You both
sounded like Dr. Strangelove,' " said
Panofsky.
Five Children
Panofsky has five children, none of
whom are involved in physics. In fact.

one of his sons is writing his Ph.D.
dissertation on medieval English
literature and another son plays violin
for a symphony orchestra.
While writing his own dissertation
at Cal Tech on X-rays and natural
constants, Panofsky met Adele
Dumond, his professor's daughter, and
married her in July, 1942.
As an international figure, Panofsky
chaired the 1959 conference banning
nuclear tests in outer space and was a
member of another conference
concerning underground nuclear
testing. "Persona grata with the
Russian scientific community,
Panofsky is respected world-wide,"
commented one of the professors at
SLAC, Robert Mozley.
At Stanford, Panofsky spoke at a
demonstration in the spring of 1970
protesting the U.S. invasion of
Cambodia. "1 told them we are an
intellectual community here, and we
should organize within the system to
have educated people working in the
top levels of government. It's
important that the link between
education and government not be
broken," he says.

SMILES — It isn't easy being an atom smasher, but SLAC director
Wolfgang Panofsky manages to smile once in a while.
In 1938, Princeton University
graduated two brothers, sons of art
historian Edwin Panofsky. One of the
brothers placed first in his graduating
class; the other placed second. They
became known as the "smart
Panofsky" and the "dumb Panofsky."
Wolfgang Kurt Hermann Panofsky
was the "smart Panofsky." Now 54,
the German-born physicist is the
director of the federally-funded
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC), one of the world's most
powerful machines for research.
Panofsky may not fit the
stereotype of a scientist. At 5-2, gray
hair disappearing, coatless with his
shirttail creeping out in back,
Panofsky is anything but the imposing
figure one expects to find lecturing on
the theory of relativity.
One colleague, Political Science
Prof. Hubert Marshall, concedes,
"Certainly Panofsky is disheveled. He
reputedly buys his clothes at Sears,
and he's totally indifferent to the
usual formalities of his profession. He
just knows more than most people and
he works very, very hard."

Inside SLAC's central laboratory
building, where the director's office is
housed, large filing cabinets scream the
message: U.S. GOVERNMENT
PROPERTY - STANFORD
UNIVERSITY.
The sound of IBM Selectric
typewriters provides an aura of
importance, arousing curiosity about
the research conducted in the
10,000-foot accelerator tube sunk 25
feet under closely compacted soil.
