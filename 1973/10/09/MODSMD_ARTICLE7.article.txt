# Vote No On C-15 Proposal
## 
### 
The Daily recommends a NO vote on the
judicial charter amendments proposed by
the Committee of 15.
The amendments purport to reform the
current student judicial system by replacing
the Campus Judicial Panel (CJP), created by
President Lyman in 1971, with a new
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC).
The CJP is composed of three students
and three faculty members. The SJ(2 would
be composed of four students — one of
whom would be subject to removal by the
President, tin; Faculty Senate, or the ASSIJ
Senate — and three faculty members.
We consider both systems unacceptable.
The SJC, which is the only proposal
students will have the opportunity to
consider, fails to satisfy students' basic right
to judicial self-determination.
It is a matter of principle more than of
practicality. Both CJP and SJC are unjustly
composed. The SJC may, as its supporters
claim, embody certain reforms. But those
reforms are infinitesimal — and pale before
the major inequities in both systems.
We believe students, like any defendants
in judicial or quasi-judicial systems in
communities that claim to be liberal and
democratic, have the right to be judged by a
jury of their peers.
We are prepared to bend principle far
enough to admit some faculty members to a
judicial panel. The problem is not that
faculty members do not act reasonably on
such panels; they do. It is that the faculty
refuses to invite students to sit in faculty
self-discipline proceedings — refuses to
recognize students as its peers. To allow

faculty members to sit in student
disciplinary proceedings may be admitted as
politically necessary; to grant them
disproportionate membership is
unacceptable.
Even if the faculty representation
provided on the SJC were, by some stretch
of Anglo-Saxon principle, accepted, the
student "majority" is one of convenience.
The fourth student member may be
eliminated forever by the President or the
Faculty Senate at the end of any year; the
student majority exists only at the pleasure
of the Administration or the faculty.
Equally unacceptable is the provision
imposing different selection procedures for
faculty and student panel members. That
student members are chosen by random is
only reasonable; it is a method that has
worked long and relatively well in the civil
courts.
That faculty members are appointed by
the Faculty Senate's Committee on
Committees, an inherently political bod\.
renders such appointments subject to all the
subtle pressures the Administration can
apply. Its presence in the proposed charter
is inexplicable — and unacceptable.
In the end. the judicial system remains
something of a fiction: any panel, no matter
how justly-com posed, can be overruled by
the President of the University. So if we are
to put our approval on a fiction, it might as
well be a good one.
We applaud the past efforts of the C-15
toward a more equitable judicial system.
But the current proposal falls far short of
what we have a right to expect. Vote NO.
