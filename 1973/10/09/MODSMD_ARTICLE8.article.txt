# SJC Proposal Offers Improvement
## 
### 
Phil Whistler

In the referendum of October
10-11 the students must vote
either to accept or reject the SJC,
the student judicial system
proposed by last year's
Committee of Fifteen. On the one
hand, we are being exhorted to
vote against the SJC's conditional
student majority and to hold out
for "the real thing." This
argument seems to be based on a
distorted perception of what is
important and what is not. The
student majority allowed for by
the SJC is perfectly sufficient in
practical terms; to pursue the
chimaera of "permanence" is to
misdirect energies which should
instead be used in reforming other
parts of the judicial system.
First, the proposed SJC should
be evaluated in the light of the
current CJP. The CJP is composed
of three students and three
faculty, plus a chairman
appointed by the President from
the faculty of the Law School.
The SJC would contain four
students, three faculty, and a
chairman, again from the Law
School, who would vote only in
case of a tie.
The student majority of the
SJC, however, is qualified by a
provision which authorizes the
ASSU Senate or Faculty Senate,
by 2/3 vote of either body, or the
University President, to remove
the fourth student member upon
determining that the functioning
of the SJC is impaired by its
composition. This removal would
be effective beginning the
following year, at which time the
composition of the SJC would
revert to the faculty majority of
the old CJP.
Improvement
The SJC, in other words,
provides a guaranteed student
majority for a period of one year,
followed by an open-ended period
of student majority. This is
undeniably a significant
improvement over the CJP; in the
unlikely event that the student
majority were terminated, we
would still be no worse off than
under the present system.
Given the fact that acceptance
of the SJC proposal guarantees at
least one year of a student
majority, and very likely an
indefinite period of student
majority afterwards, and given
that rejection of the SJC proposal
means a continuation of the CJP.
faculty majority and all, on what
grounds then is SJC opposed?
Some oppose it on the grounds
that its reforms do not go far

enough. This is only stating the
obvious — clearly, the reforms did
not go as far as the student
members of C-15 would have
liked. It should be born in mind,
though, that this is not the final
and definitive judicial reform,
designed to last through the ages.
It is a first step forward, in a
narrowly circumscribed area, from
a system which has in many areas
besides this one.
Hopeful Sign
The fact that this first step can
be made at all, especially in view
of the impasse which has
paralyzed judicial reform at
Stanford in the last couple of
years, is a hopeful sign. By
approving the SJC proposal,
which represents the fruit of the
first year of real cooperation
among the students, faculty, and
administration of the C-15, the
students can do a great deal
towards establishing a climate of
nominal trust which will facilitate
further reforms.
Finally, there is no guarantee
that if the SJC proposal fails the
students will be able to do better,
or even as well, next year. Even if
one is sanguine enough to assume
that a student majority can be
agreed upon next year, there are
other areas of the system which
stand in greater need of reform.
Tfte difference between a student
majority which is conditional
upon the toleration of the
administration and a "permanent"
majority in a judicial system the
very existence of which is
ultimately conditional upon the
toleration of the administration is,
alas,'negligible.
Be Realistic
The President is not going to
remove the fourth student
member gratuitously; as long as
the mobilizers of campus opinion
maintain a reasonable vigilance,
the student majority should
endure just as long as the SJC.
This is not an especially
heartening fact to consider, but
when push comes to shove, as the
saying goes, the difference
between a "conditional" and a
"permanent" student majority is
mostly form and very little
substance. There have been
"permanent" student majorities,
and even a "permanent"
all-student panel, in the past.
The point I have tried to make
is that to pursue a "permanent"
student majority, given the fact of
the President's residual powers
within the University, is to chase
after rainbows. What remains to

be gained in terms of a student
majority once the SJC is adopted
is insignificant. We should stop
beating the issue of student
majority into the ground and
realize that the majority provided
by the SJC is good enough, and

then get on to other areas of the
judicial system which are in
greater need of reform. Vote yes
on the SJC proposal.

The SJC, in other words,
provides a guaranteed student
majority for a period of one year,
followed by an open-ended period
of student majority. This is
undeniably a significant
improvement over the CJP; in the
unlikely event that the student
majority were terminated, we
would still be no worse off than
under the present system.

of the SJC proposal guarantees at

faculty majority and all, on what
grounds then is SJC opposed?
Some oppose it on the grounds
that its reforms do not go far

enough. This is only stating the
obvious — clearly, the reforms did
not go as far as the student
members of C-15 would have
liked. It should be born in mind,
though, that this is not the final
and definitive judicial reform,
designed to last through the ages.
It is a first step forward, in a
narrowly circumscribed area, from
a system which has in many areas
besides this one.
Hopeful Sign
The fact that this first step can
be made at all, especially in view
of the impasse which has
paralyzed judicial reform at
Stanford in the last couple of
years, is a hopeful sign. By
approving the SJC proposal,
which represents the fruit of the
first year of real cooperation
among the students, faculty, and
administration of the C-15, the
students can do a great deal
towards establishing a climate of
nominal trust which will facilitate
further reforms.
Finally, there is no guarantee
that if the SJC proposal fails the
students will be able to do better,
or even as well, next year. Even if
one is sanguine enough to assume
that a student majority can be
agreed upon next year, there are
other areas of the system which
stand in greater need of reform.
Tfte difference between a student
majority which is conditional
upon the toleration of the
administration and a "permanent"
majority in a judicial system the
very existence of which is
ultimately conditional upon the
toleration of the administration is,
alas,'negligible.
Be Realistic
The President is not going to
remove the fourth student
member gratuitously; as long as
the mobilizers of campus opinion
maintain a reasonable vigilance,
the student majority should
endure just as long as the SJC.
This is not an especially
heartening fact to consider, but
when push comes to shove, as the
saying goes, the difference
between a "conditional" and a
"permanent" student majority is
mostly form and very little
substance. There have been
"permanent" student majorities,
and even a "permanent"
all-student panel, in the past.
The point I have tried to make
is that to pursue a "permanent"
student majority, given the fact of
the President's residual powers
within the University, is to chase
after rainbows. What remains to

be gained in terms of a student
majority once the SJC is adopted
is insignificant. We should stop
beating the issue of student
majority into the ground and
realize that the majority provided
by the SJC is good enough, and

then get on to other areas of the
judicial system which are in
greater need of reform. Vote yes
on the SJC proposal.

In the referendum of October
10-11 the students must vote
either to accept or reject the SJC,
the student judicial system
proposed by last year's
Committee of Fifteen. On the one
hand, we are being exhorted to
vote against the SJC's conditional
student majority and to hold out
for "the real thing." This
argument seems to be based on a
distorted perception of what is
important and what is not. The
student majority allowed for by
the SJC is perfectly sufficient in
practical terms; to pursue the
chimaera of "permanence" is to
misdirect energies which should
instead be used in reforming other
parts of the judicial system.
First, the proposed SJC should
be evaluated in the light of the
current CJP. The CJP is composed
of three students and three
faculty, plus a chairman
appointed by the President from
the faculty of the Law School.
The SJC would contain four
students, three faculty, and a
chairman, again from the Law
School, who would vote only in
case of a tie.
The student majority of the
SJC, however, is qualified by a
provision which authorizes the
ASSU Senate or Faculty Senate,
by 2/3 vote of either body, or the
University President, to remove
the fourth student member upon
determining that the functioning
of the SJC is impaired by its
composition. This removal would
be effective beginning the
following year, at which time the
composition of the SJC would
revert to the faculty majority of
the old CJP.

The President is not going to

the student majority should

student majority, given the fact of
the President's residual powers

is insignificant. We should stop
beating the issue of student
majority into the ground and
realize that the majority provided
by the SJC is good enough, and

judicial system which are in
greater need of reform. Vote yes
on the SJC proposal.

In the referendum of October
10-11 the students must vote
either to accept or reject the SJC,
the student judicial system
proposed by last year's
Committee of Fifteen. On the one
hand, we are being exhorted to
vote against the SJC's conditional
student majority and to hold out
for "the real thing." This
argument seems to be based on a
distorted perception of what is
important and what is not. The
student majority allowed for by
the SJC is perfectly sufficient in
practical terms; to pursue the
chimaera of "permanence" is to
misdirect energies which should
instead be used in reforming other
parts of the judicial system.
First, the proposed SJC should
be evaluated in the light of the
current CJP. The CJP is composed
of three students and three
faculty, plus a chairman
appointed by the President from
the faculty of the Law School.
The SJC would contain four
students, three faculty, and a
chairman, again from the Law
School, who would vote only in
case of a tie.
The student majority of the
SJC, however, is qualified by a
provision which authorizes the
ASSU Senate or Faculty Senate,
by 2/3 vote of either body, or the
University President, to remove
the fourth student member upon
determining that the functioning
of the SJC is impaired by its
composition. This removal would
be effective beginning the
following year, at which time the
composition of the SJC would
revert to the faculty majority of
the old CJP.
Improvement
The SJC, in other words,
provides a guaranteed student
majority for a period of one year,
followed by an open-ended period
of student majority. This is
undeniably a significant
improvement over the CJP; in the
unlikely event that the student
majority were terminated, we
would still be no worse off than
under the present system.
Given the fact that acceptance
of the SJC proposal guarantees at
least one year of a student
majority, and very likely an
indefinite period of student
majority afterwards, and given
that rejection of the SJC proposal
means a continuation of the CJP.
faculty majority and all, on what
grounds then is SJC opposed?
Some oppose it on the grounds
that its reforms do not go far

enough. This is only stating the
obvious — clearly, the reforms did
not go as far as the student
members of C-15 would have
liked. It should be born in mind,
though, that this is not the final
and definitive judicial reform,
designed to last through the ages.
It is a first step forward, in a
narrowly circumscribed area, from
a system which has in many areas
besides this one.
Hopeful Sign
The fact that this first step can
be made at all, especially in view
of the impasse which has
paralyzed judicial reform at
Stanford in the last couple of
years, is a hopeful sign. By
approving the SJC proposal,
which represents the fruit of the
first year of real cooperation
among the students, faculty, and
administration of the C-15, the
students can do a great deal
towards establishing a climate of
nominal trust which will facilitate
further reforms.
Finally, there is no guarantee
that if the SJC proposal fails the
students will be able to do better,
or even as well, next year. Even if
one is sanguine enough to assume
that a student majority can be
agreed upon next year, there are
other areas of the system which
stand in greater need of reform.
