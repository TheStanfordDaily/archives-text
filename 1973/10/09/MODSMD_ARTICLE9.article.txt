# New Proposal Needed
## Co-Presidents Urge Defeat 
### 
> ASSU Council

This Wednesday and Thursday,
students will vote to approve or to
reject the amendments to the
Judicial Charter proposed last
May by the Committee of Fifteen.
Similar proposals have been
overwhelmingly rejected by
students in the past — we urge
students to do the same next
week. Heralded as a
"compromise" judicial proposal,
the C-15 amendments are a thinly
disguised variation on the
inequitable CJP, unilaterally
imposed by President Lyman in
the fall of 1971. We reject the
idea that passage of these
amendments is only the first step
in the process of establishing a
truly equitable judicial syste/n and
we refuse to support a system that
has proven in the past to be
unacceptable to Stanford
students.
The most glaring examples of
inequities in the current C-15
proposal include the following
points:
—The much ballyhooed
provision granting a student
majority is accompanied by a
'Catch 22' provision which grants
both faculty and administration
the right to unilaterally and
without cause revoke the student
majority. To accept such a
provision would fly in the face of
every previous expression of
student sentiment on the
composition of the judicial panel.
To those who doubt that the
power to revoke the student
majority would ever be exercised,
we simply point out the even
more heavy handed action of
President Lyman in granting
contempt powers to the old SJC
Chairman after the C-15 had
refused to do so and in
establishing the CJP.
Need Equal Selection
—The current C-15 proposal
calls for politically appointed
faculty members to the Judicial
Council while the student
members are to be selected at
random. We believe that all
members should be chosen in the
same fashion.
—This proposal also contains
an absurdly vague statement of
the jurisdiction of the judicial
council. It fails to protect a
defendant's right against self
incrimination and it fails to
safeguard against arbitrary
exercise of power by a
Presidentially appointed faculty
chairman.
Possible Impact
To accept this proposal would
lock us into a thoroughly unjust
judicial system for years to come.

To those who would doubt this,
we point out that the "Interim
Judicial Board" of 1965, which
the students agreed to as a
temporary body, lasted three
years and was abolished only after
a massive sit-in at the Old Union
and an extraordinary defeat of the
administration in the Academic
Council.
The only impetus for changing
the current CJP system comes
from the fact that the
administration is in the
embarrassing situation of
operating a student judicial
system that has never been
approved by students. Should
students vote to legitimize a

system which is equally as bad as
the CJP, they will preclude the
possibility of gaining a fair judicial
body in the foreseeable future. It
is far better that the CJP continue
to function in all its illegitimate
glory than that students acquiesce
in legitimizing the arbitrary and
autocratic power wielded over
their lives by the University
administration.
Vote no on the C-15 report
and send the committee back to
work on a just and equitable
student judicial system.

exercise of power by a
Presidentially appointed faculty
chairman.
Possible Impact
To accept this proposal would
lock us into a thoroughly unjust
judicial system for years to come.

To those who would doubt this,
we point out that the "Interim
Judicial Board" of 1965, which
the students agreed to as a
temporary body, lasted three
years and was abolished only after
a massive sit-in at the Old Union
and an extraordinary defeat of the
administration in the Academic
Council.
The only impetus for changing
the current CJP system comes
from the fact that the
administration is in the
embarrassing situation of
operating a student judicial
system that has never been
approved by students. Should
students vote to legitimize a

system which is equally as bad as
the CJP, they will preclude the
possibility of gaining a fair judicial
body in the foreseeable future. It
is far better that the CJP continue
to function in all its illegitimate
glory than that students acquiesce
in legitimizing the arbitrary and
autocratic power wielded over
their lives by the University
administration.
Vote no on the C-15 report
and send the committee back to
work on a just and equitable
student judicial system.

This Wednesday and Thursday,
students will vote to approve or to
reject the amendments to the
Judicial Charter proposed last
May by the Committee of Fifteen.
Similar proposals have been
overwhelmingly rejected by
students in the past — we urge
students to do the same next
week. Heralded as a
"compromise" judicial proposal,
the C-15 amendments are a thinly
disguised variation on the
inequitable CJP, unilaterally
imposed by President Lyman in
the fall of 1971. We reject the
idea that passage of these
amendments is only the first step
in the process of establishing a
truly equitable judicial syste/n and
we refuse to support a system that
has proven in the past to be
unacceptable to Stanford
students.
The most glaring examples of
inequities in the current C-15
proposal include the following
points:
—The much ballyhooed
provision granting a student
majority is accompanied by a
'Catch 22' provision which grants
both faculty and administration
the right to unilaterally and
without cause revoke the student
majority. To accept such a
provision would fly in the face of
every previous expression of
student sentiment on the
composition of the judicial panel.
To those who doubt that the
power to revoke the student
majority would ever be exercised,
we simply point out the even
more heavy handed action of
President Lyman in granting
contempt powers to the old SJC
Chairman after the C-15 had
refused to do so and in
establishing the CJP.
Need Equal Selection
—The current C-15 proposal
calls for politically appointed
faculty members to the Judicial
Council while the student
members are to be selected at
random. We believe that all
members should be chosen in the
same fashion.
—This proposal also contains
an absurdly vague statement of
the jurisdiction of the judicial
council. It fails to protect a
defendant's right against self
incrimination and it fails to
safeguard against arbitrary
exercise of power by a
Presidentially appointed faculty
chairman.
