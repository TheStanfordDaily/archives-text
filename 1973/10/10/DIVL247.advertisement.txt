Coffeehouse. I
To be sure we'll give you a fine
cup of coffee when you ask. Our coffee beans
are a rich French Roast. We'll also hand you |
a dark italian espresso if you like, or
cappucino, mocha royale, italian sodas, or fruit macedonia.
Sandwiches are made to order from a list of roast beef,
corned beef, pastrami, ham, salami, swiss cheese, cream cheese, tuna
salad, egg salad on russian rye, sour dough french, onion roll,
or sweet french. |
For sweet teeth we've delicacies like cheesecake, baklava,
strisel. fruit, greek apple strudel, and halvah.
A coffeehouse is often only as good as its atmosphere. Our
| plant-filled haven has been refashioned with exhibit space as well as
for sittin' n'sippin' n' talkin'. Inside aat! outside under the shady trees. ;|
As always there's music in the air.
