# Israeli Planes Bomb Damascus; Egyptians Gain In Suez Fighting
## 
### Associated Press 
Israeli warplanes attacked the
Syrian capital of Damascus yesterday,
and Egyptian officials at the United
Nations said the Israelis staged a
similar raid on Cairo.
The air raids, which also included
the Syrian city of Homs and military
airfields in Egypt, escalated the
four-day Mideast war to an
international crisis.
The Soviet ambassador to the
United Nations, Jacob Malik, called
the air raid on Damascus a "barbaric,
gangster act" and then walked out of
the U.N. Security Council.
Embassies
Malik cited unofficial reports that
the embassies of 10 nations in
Damascus were destroyed and 30
persons in the Soviet Embassy were
killed. He offered no official word that
the Soviet embassy had been bombed,
as had been noted earlier.
CBS radio news reported, however,
that the Soviet Cultural Center, not
the Soviet Embassy, was hit and the
number of casualties not determined.
Israel depicted the air raids on Syria

as retaliation for Syrian rocket attacks
on Jewish settlements in the occupied
Golan Heights.
A correspondent in Damascus said
he saw three Phantom jets score direct
hits on the Defense Ministry near a
busy square.
Other Bombings
Bombs also hit a diplomatic and
residential complex nearby, totally
destroying at least one four-story
house and damaging many others.
The 10-minute raid came shortly
after noon, when Damascus was
humming with activity. Hundreds of
civilians, soldiers and militiamen were
walking in the square when the
Phantoms struck.
At least one bomb went through
the roof of a radio station and
exploded inside. The Defense Ministry
and the nearby air force headquarters
were similarly damaged.
There was no official casualty
count.
Cairo Raid
The Cairo air raid was reported to
the Security Council by Egypt's U.N.
ambassador, A. Esmat Abdel Meguid.

He said he was informed of the air raid
through a cable from his government.
He told reporters later that the
planes were F4 Phantoms, which are
supplied to Israel by the United States.
He said the message gave no further
details on the raid.
An AP dispatch from Cairo said
two air raid alerts were sounded in the
Egyptian capital during the day, but
that no bombs fell in the city. Loud
explosions could be heard in the
distance, although their cause
remained uncertain, according to the
dispatch.
First Attack
The air raids on the Syrian cities
and the reported raid on Cairo were
the first attacks by Israeli warplanes
on mass population centers since the
war began last Saturday.
Radio Damascus declared that Syria
shot down a "large number" of Israeli
planes in the bombing raids on
Damascus and Homs. The
communique said five Israeli pilots
were taken prisoner and that the
bodies of five others were recovered.
Syria said it shot down a total of 23

Israeli planes yesterday. There were
dogfights over the Golan Heights, a
hilly area northeast of Israel that the
Israelis captured from Syria in the
1967 Mideast war.
Ground Battles
While Israel unleashed powerful
new thrusts from the air, Egyptian and
Syrian tanks slugged it out with Israeli
armor in fierce battles along the Suez
Canal and in the Golan Heights.
In Tel Aviv, an Israeli general
presented less glowing reports than
had been put forth previously
regarding Israel's tactical situation in
the two-front war, which is in its fifth
day.
"It is not going to be a short war,"
said Maj. Gen. Aharon Yarif. He said
Israel had moved its defense line two
to three miles back from the eastern
bank of the Suez Canal and said of the
Golan Heights fighting on the other
front: "It is still too early to say that
we have broken the Syrian army."
In the fighting along the Suez
Canal, a Cairo communique said the
Egyptian army had stabbed nine miles
to the east of the 103-mile waterway.
Egypt claimed its tanks were pushing
Israeli armor eastward.
The communique conflicted with
the report from Israel's Gen. Yarif
who said the Israeli army abandoned
its line of outposts along the canal and
was holding a defense line two to three
miles from the canal.
At the U.N., diplomats said the
Security Council probably would not
offer a cease-fire resolution on the
Middle East war until it appears one
side or the other is winning.
The 15-nation council met late
yesterday, then adjourned Middle East
debate indefinitely because of
irreconcilable disputes.
Diplomats said it was tragic but
realistic that a cease-fire resolution
would come only when the fighting
took a definite turn, indicating that
either the Arabs or Israelis were
winning.
President Nixon has summoned
Republican and Democratic
congressional leaders to the White
House for a morning meeting on the
Middle East crisis.
