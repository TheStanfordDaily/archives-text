# An Extraordinary Vision
## 'We're All Bozos In Here!' 
### 
Jim Regan

AT 11:10 p.m. last Thursday
night an extraordinary event
occurred in the Undergraduate
Library, though it was witnessed
by few persons. A sophomore
male was secluded in a study
carrel near one wall on the fourth
floor. The Greek gods were
amusing him and Plato was
admonishing him, but the present
intruded and drew away -his
attention to the box around him.
And he saw that he was
surrounded on three sides by
smooth walls of dark
wood-grained linoleum, and on
the fourth by cement and
impenetrable windows. Below his
vinyl-covered chair was a carpet of
synthetic fibres, and in the wall
was an electricity outlet. The air
he breathed was carefully
regulated by the heater stationed
along the wall to protect the room
from the environment. Luminous
panels in the ceiling filled the
room with homogenized light.
But whispers of voices and
squeaks of Hi-Liters on textbook
pages told the encased student
that he was not alone, for others
were sitting throughout the
library in their own plastic boxes.
And in his mind for a moment,
the future was at hand: huge
brains, pure intellects, floated in
antiseptic fishbowls, happily
devouring all the knowledge fed
to them by wire? taped to their
cortex and connected to

electronic devices which received
all kinds of information from all
over the universe.
Distraught from his vision, the
student rushed to the balcony
railing and looked all around him
at the faces hovering over their
desks, enraptured with chronicles
of human endeavor or
descriptions of the sub-atomic
world. Could those faces be
touched, touched by a shout?
"Everybody listen to me!
Everybody put down your books
and come over to the railing and
listen to me! Why are we all in
here? What are we doing this for?
When are we going to stop losing
ourselves in thought, and start
finding one another?!"
As 1 said, few people witnessed

this extraordinary event. Most of
the people in the library were sure
they didn't hear a thing, though
some nervously rolled their pens
in their fingers and looked around
to see if it was proper to run to
the railing to see what was
happening. But no one moved, so
neither did the next person. And
those who were sitting near the
subdued student just frowned at
him, while a librarian on the
second floor looked up and shook
his head.
Ask someone who was in the
library Thursday night if they saw
this happen. They'll tell you
you're crazy.

male was secluded in a study
carrel near one wall on the fourth
floor. The Greek gods were
amusing him and Plato was
admonishing him, but the present
intruded and drew away -his
attention to the box around him.
And he saw that he was
surrounded on three sides by
smooth walls of dark
wood-grained linoleum, and on
the fourth by cement and
impenetrable windows. Below his
vinyl-covered chair was a carpet of
synthetic fibres, and in the wall
was an electricity outlet. The air
he breathed was carefully
regulated by the heater stationed
along the wall to protect the room
from the environment. Luminous
panels in the ceiling filled the
room with homogenized light.
But whispers of voices and
squeaks of Hi-Liters on textbook
pages told the encased student
that he was not alone, for others
were sitting throughout the
library in their own plastic boxes.
And in his mind for a moment,
the future was at hand: huge
brains, pure intellects, floated in
antiseptic fishbowls, happily
devouring all the knowledge fed
to them by wire? taped to their
cortex and connected to

electronic devices which received
all kinds of information from all
over the universe.
Distraught from his vision, the
student rushed to the balcony
railing and looked all around him
at the faces hovering over their
desks, enraptured with chronicles
of human endeavor or
descriptions of the sub-atomic
world. Could those faces be
touched, touched by a shout?
"Everybody listen to me!
Everybody put down your books
and come over to the railing and
listen to me! Why are we all in
here? What are we doing this for?
When are we going to stop losing
ourselves in thought, and start
finding one another?!"
As 1 said, few people witnessed

this extraordinary event. Most of
the people in the library were sure
they didn't hear a thing, though
some nervously rolled their pens
in their fingers and looked around
to see if it was proper to run to
the railing to see what was
happening. But no one moved, so
neither did the next person. And
those who were sitting near the
subdued student just frowned at
him, while a librarian on the
second floor looked up and shook
his head.
Ask someone who was in the
library Thursday night if they saw
this happen. They'll tell you
you're crazy.

AT 11:10 p.m. last Thursday
night an extraordinary event
occurred in the Undergraduate
Library, though it was witnessed
by few persons. A sophomore
male was secluded in a study
carrel near one wall on the fourth
floor. The Greek gods were
amusing him and Plato was
admonishing him, but the present
intruded and drew away -his
attention to the box around him.
And he saw that he was
surrounded on three sides by
smooth walls of dark
wood-grained linoleum, and on
the fourth by cement and
impenetrable windows. Below his
vinyl-covered chair was a carpet of
synthetic fibres, and in the wall
was an electricity outlet. The air
he breathed was carefully
regulated by the heater stationed
along the wall to protect the room
from the environment. Luminous
panels in the ceiling filled the
room with homogenized light.
But whispers of voices and
squeaks of Hi-Liters on textbook
pages told the encased student
that he was not alone, for others
were sitting throughout the
library in their own plastic boxes.
And in his mind for a moment,
the future was at hand: huge
brains, pure intellects, floated in
antiseptic fishbowls, happily
devouring all the knowledge fed
