# Boycott Continues
## Farm Workers Need Help 
### 
Doug Rice, Chris Gabbard

The bout between California
farm workers and the grape
growers rages into October. If you
remember a time earlier this year,
the UFW's grape contracts were
doled out by the growers to the
Teamsters Union. To the growers
the arrival of the Teamsters was a
godsend; for the Temo officials
the "below the belt" grape
agreements were a real bargain.
They hoped that this would be
the final knock down punch that
would end permanently the
sparring that had started when the
truck drivers first challenged the
United Farm Workers for the right
to represent field workers. But the
struggle is by no means over, for
the UFW's subtle strategy proved
triumphant in towing the truckers
out of the vineyards.
The UFW jaded the Teamsters
with continual pressure. A steady
stream of telegrams, phone calls
and letters from prominent
religious leaders, senators and
congressmen, labor officials and
the public continued to arrive all
summer on the desk of Teamsters
President Frank Fitzsimmons.
By August 9th, the stress had
become so acute that top Temos
rejected grape contracts inked a
day earlier by organizer Jim Smith
and 29 Delano growers.
Fitzsimmons moved into peace
talks with UFW leader Cesar
Chavez and AFL-CIO chief
George Meany in an effort to
resolve the dispute. The three
concluded an "agreement in
principle" on September 27th.
Truce Terms
According to the truce terms,
all 1970 Teamster contracts will
remain with the truckers until
their expiration in 1975 at which
time they will permanently depart

the farm labor scene. In turn, the
farm workers will postpone the
lettuce boycott. All farm labor
contracts they acquired this year
in grapes and wines are
immediately abandoned. The
UFW is free to continue and
intensify its boycott of grapes and
Gallo wine and henceforth the
UFW will have sole jurisdiction
over farm workers.
George Meany has put his
personal integrity behind the pact,
but Frank Fitzsimmons is
encountering dissension within
Temo ranks. Fitzsimmons has
taken a conciliatory line toward
the campesinos in order to cut the
rug out from under William
Grami, the man responsible for
leading the attack on the UFW.
Grami is a partisan of Jimmy
Hoffa, whose ghostly ambitions
for a new presidential term have
Fitzsimmons worried.
The Hoffa camp, noting that
peace with the UFW would
weaken their comeback ability,
are balking at the agreement. If
the militant Hoffa adherents are
victorious, it will pit the UFW
again against the Teamsters. In
essence, the farm workers are a
political football of internal Temo
jockeying; no agreement has been
signed although Meany will be
personally affronted if the pact is
not completed.
Tragic Halt
In response to the break down
of relations between the Union
and the growers, the picketing
continued through the summer.
Its tragic halt came with the
deaths of two union members.
Nagi Daifullah was slain by an off
duty policeman; Juan de la Cruz,
60, was shot to death the
following day while picketing a

field. The latter's death was the
last straw in a chain of violence
that had been perpetrated against
the union since the strikes broke
out in April. Picket lines were
terminated and 500 workers were
dispatched to cities across the
United States and Canada to beef
up the boycott of grapes, Gallo,
Safeway and A & P.
The boycott, the single most
powerful counter punch the UFW
has to fight the growers, is
working. In 1971 and '72
(non-boycott years) grape profits
sky rocketed as growers picked up
lost ground incurred during the
first grape boycott of 1968-69.
This year, the cost of the
Coachella growers to produce a
lug of Thompson seedless grapes
averaged $8.25, an unusually high
figure due to the strike and poor
weather.
Prices Down
However, the prices the
growers sold their lugs never
topped $7.40 and fell as low as
$4.60. Prices went down because
the growers had to depend on
unskilled workers who picked
poorly and packed badly. Another
consideration is that the demand
for grapes is low due partly to a
slow down of consumer demand,
lack of promotions, and retail
chains not wanting to get involved
with picket lines.
With the Teamsters out of the
fields, the UFW still has much to
be done to get contracts with the
growers. People are needed to
help fill the picket lines at the
Safeway stores here in Palo Alto.
The Gallo boycott should be
highly publicized and
strengthened on campus as a large
percentage of Gallo's sales are to
students. To get all those
interested in helping with the
boycotts together and organized,
there will be a meeting Thursday
night at 9:00 p.m. in Cedro
Lounge to plan the Stanford Gallo
Boycott and to set up car pools to
the Safeways on the week-ends.
Please come only if you can give a
few hours each week. For more
information call Doug Rice
324-1368. Boycott Gallo. Boycott
Grapes. Don't shop Safeway.
