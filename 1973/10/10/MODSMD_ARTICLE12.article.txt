Pornography Distinctions
Editor:
In 1969 the U.S. Supreme
Court decided the leading
pornography case of Stanley v.
Georgia and for the first time
articulated the constitutional
principle that the mere private
possession of obscene material in
one's own residence may not be
proscribed by law. Your article
entitled "County Porno Law
Enforcement Unaffected by
'Community Standards' Court
Decision," published in the Daily
of October 2, 1973, did not
acknowledge the constitutionally
relevant distinctions between
private possession of
pornography, as in the Stanley
case, and a public, commercial
display of similar material. As a
result, the story may have been
confusing to readers.
Your article drew an analogy
between the showing of skin flicks
in Roble Hall last November and
the proposal to show Behind the
Green Door in the Sunday Flicks
program this autumn quarter.
From this analogy your article
inferred that the Sheriff's Office
has changed its position in the
enforcement of obscenity laws. I
submit that the Roble showing
and the Sunday Flicks proposal
are not analogous and therefore
do not necessarily support the
inference that there has been a
change in enforcement policy.
The fact that these two situations
are very different most likely
accounts for the Sheriff's Office
responding differently to inquiries
about each of the two events.
The Roble Hall showing
occurred late one evening in the
second floor library at Roble, was
restricted to Roble residents, was
not advertised to the public, and
was shown free of charge to the
viewers. The two proposed

showings of Behind the Green
Door, on the other hand, were to
have been in Memorial
Auditorium (with a seating
capacity of about 1700),
advertised to the public, and
would have required the payment
of an admission charge.
Last November, a resident of
Roble Hall became concerned
abut the possibility of police
action if the stag films were
shown. That resident initially
contacted the Sheriff's Office and
received the erroneous
information that the directors and
virtually every resident of the
dormitory would be jailed in the
event the films were shown. To
allay the fears of several
dormitory residents and the
resident directors, three
University representatives met
with officials of the Sheriff's
Office. During that meeting it was
obvious that the Sheriff's Office
was satisfied that the proposed
Roble showing would be
protected under the constitutional
right of privacy, as applied in the
Stanley case. Therefore, before
the Roble showing it was clear
that no police action would be
appropriate when and if the
showing occurred.
On behalf of Bob Sisson,
Manager of the Sunday Flicks
program, I again contacted the
Sheriff's Office recently to find
out what it would do if Behind
the Green Door were shown. The
Sheriff's Office responded that it
would probably have to take
action because the showing would
be public and commercial, no
constitutional protections
appeared for such a showing, and
one California court had recently
determined that the film violates
California law against obscenity.
