# Hope To Get International Attention
## MIA Relatives Plan Journey 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) -
Despite admonitions from the
U.S. State Department, 53
relatives of American servicemen
declared missing in Southeast Asia
have embarked on a trip they
hoped will focus international
attention on their plight.
The group left Monday on a
plane to Bangkok, Thailand,
where they planned to make
arrangements for the trip to
Vientiane, capital of Laos. The
State Department had advised
them not to go.
"We feel like we're drowning in
the confusion and coverup we're
getting from the government,"
asserted Paul Miller of Palacios,
Tex. His son Capt. Curtis D. Miller
has been missing since March 29.
About 1250 American
servicemen are listed by the
Pentagon as missing in Southeast
Asia. The status of more than 100
MIAs has been changed to dead
since American prisoners of war
held in Vietnam and Cambodia
were released early this year.
Members of the group —
fathers, mothers, wives, brothers
and sisters of MIAs — are from 20
states. One lives in Germany, and
another was traveling from
Okinawa.
"The lives of our husbands and

sons may be at stake, and we have
chosen to ignore that advice,"
Virginia West of Baltimore, Md.,
said at a news conference before
the group left Los Angeles. She is
national coordinator of the
League of Families of American
Prisoners and Missing in Southeast
Asia.
She said the group would try

to attract the attention of Laotian
and American officials by holding
a one-week vigil in Vietiane.
The group also wants to
account for the dead and help
gain the return of bodies or get
permission for U.S. teams to
explore crash sites or areas where
MIAs were last seen.
