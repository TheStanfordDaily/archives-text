### 
ATLANTA, Ga. (AP) -
Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz
said here yesterday that price
controls on food were "counter
productive" and that he was ready
for an end to food price ceilings.
"I'm ready for Phase 5, which I
call phase-out," said Butz at a
news conference.
He remarked that he thought it
was "terrible to have shown on
television" the drowning of baby
chicks at a time when price
ceilings made it economically
unfeasible to continue raising the
birds.
But he said he thought the

induced slaughter of poultry and
other stock had taught the
American consumer a lesson:
"The best antidote for high
food prices is to get the stuff to
the market and not artificially roll
back the price."
The agriculture secretary said
the consumer today pays 16
percent of his take-home pay for
food. "Never did people pay so
small a share of their take-home
pay as this year," he said.
He said food was not so much
responsible for the current high
cost of living as the "voracious
appetite for luxuries" that
Americans have.
