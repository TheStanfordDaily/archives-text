# Russian Film Series Offers Silent Classics
## 
### STEVEN KOVACS 
A year and a half ago Sheldon
Renan, Director of the Pacific
Film Archives at Berkeley,
received a phone call from a group
of Russian film makers touring
the United States and interested
in finding out about film activites
in the Bay Area. Renan and the
Russians got togetner at Franklin
Ford Coppola's house several days
later to discuss the movie industry
in Russia and America.
After a private screening of
77Â»e Godfather and an inordinate
amount of vodka to accompany
the visual violence, some casual
remarks were made about a
possible exchange of films
between the two countries.
In the following months, Tom
Luddy, programmer of the
Archives, worked out final details
of the first Russian-American film
exchange program. The program
he put together represents a
selection of the finest films made
in the silent era of Soviet film
production.
The films were chosen in
consultation with Jay Leyda, the
leading Western expert on Russian
and Chinese films. His books Kino
and the recently published
Dianying are the authoritative
texts on these two film cultures.
Film Selections
What Leyda and Luddy have
put together is the first and most
comprehensive list of outstanding
films produced in the Soviet
Union in the fifteen years after
the Oct. 1917 Revolution. Out of
a total of 800 movies made during
this period they selected a diverse
and representative lot which is
bound to start any ardent movie
buff salivating in Pavlovian
fashion.
In addition to the well-known

masterpieces of Eisenstein and
Pudovltin Potemkin, Strike, Storm
Over Asia, and The End of St.
Petersburg, comedies,
documentaries, adventure stories,
satire, science fiction, and even
animated movies appear on the
list.
The first chapter of Russian
Revolutionary film series is
currently playing two nights each
week at Memorial Auditorium,

beginning a tour that will take the
film fest to Berkeley, Toronto,
New York, and other major
American cities.
Stanford Screenings
Every Monday at noon, three
canisters containing silent films
arrive here from Berkeley. They
are accompanied by detailed
program notes which are made
available to audiences. In the
evenings a small but enthusiastic
group turns out for the screenings,
and the showings take on the air
of private screenings. A pianist
stands ready to accompany the
action on the screen, matching the
atmosphere of movie palaces
I before the coming of talkies.
The audience includes the
I ardent Russophile, the film
fanatic, and the undergraduate
who doesn't need the weekend as
an excuse to "flick out." In the
aisles Bertram Wolfe, an eminent
historian of the Russian
Revolution reminisces about the
Russian movies he saw when he
lived in Moscow around 1930:
"In those days the movies we
saw were long and boring, many
of them with an all-too-obvious
line. I don't know why, but I just
can't remember seeing any of the
movies on this program. This is a
great opportunity for the entire
University. I'm going to come as
often as I can."

Last Wednesday night's
program included two Georgian
movies on the program; The
Murder of General Gryaznov and
The Bandit Arsen. They were the
first films to be made in the
Republic of Georgia.
Gryaznov deals with the
uprisings of 1905 and the
resistance of a group of
revolutionaries to the authorities.
Hie plot centers around the

assassination of a general in charge
of rounding up the striking
workers. The assassination is
surprisingly moving in this
exciting, fast-paced film. In rapid
succession we see the throwing of
the bomb, the carriage
over-turned, the bleeding face of
the general, the horses galloping
away.
It is astonishing to see such

masterful editing before
Kuleshov's experiments and
Eisenstein's popularization of
rapid, emotion-provoking
montage. Director Ivan
Perestiani's mastery springs from
his sensitivity to the camera.
Russian Robin Hood
The Bandit Arsen tells the
story of a folk hero, a Georgian
Robin Hood. Camerawork and
editing combine to produce a film
of unusual power and exotic
beauty.
Among the up-coming films are
a number of Dziga Vertov's
documentaries which use all the
tricks of the camera to build a
fast-moving, often-comic flow of
images to proclaim the
achievements of the Bolshevik
Revolution; Aelita, an early
imaginative attempt at science
fiction; a fairy tale entitled Father
Frost and a satire on the Western
misconceptions about life in a
Communist state entitled The
Extraordinary Adventures of Mr.
West in the Land of the
Bolsheviks.
The Stanford program has been
rounded out with some of the
later classics of Soviet film
production like Podovkin's
adaptation of Maxim Gorky's
Mother and Eisenstein's Ten Days
That Shook the World and Ivan
the Terrible.
The Russian Revolutionary
Film Series is an experiment in
establishing a cinematheque, here
at Stanford.
The cinematheque aims to

provide the public with a
continuous program of the finest
films of all types and all
nationalities through a constant
rotation of the films. Pacific Film
Archives, with its small but
substantial collection, has begun
to perform a similar function in
Berkeley in the last several years.
The holdings of the Archives
and the traveling series that they
present should create film
programs of general interest to the
entire Stanford community
throughout the academic year.
Such programs would
complement the showings of
all-time film favorites which come
to the campus under the
sponsorship of ASSU, the Law
School, Tresidder, and other
organizations.
With this end in mind, the
Stanford Film Society was
established in the last couple of
weeks. Through their efforts the
experimental Russian
Revolutionary Film Series could
lead the way to a year-round
program of films which are not
available to the public through
general distribution.
The Film Society extends an
invitation to the University
community and the general public
to share in the excitement of
viewing Russian films. The cost is
$1.00 per showing or $10.00 for
the remaining fifteen nights.

professor in the Communication
department.
