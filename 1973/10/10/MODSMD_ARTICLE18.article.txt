# 'The Art Of India' Depicts Ancient Majarajah's World
## 
### BARBARA HEINS 
The Art of India presently on
exhibit at the Stanford art gallery
is one of the most beautiful
collections shown at Stanford in
recent years. The works include
drawings and paintings spanning
the 17 th to 20th centuries,
particularly from the Rajasthen
area in north-west India. The
works are mostly from the
collection of Harriette von Breton
of Santa Barbara.
The miniature (illuminated
manuscript usually bound in
books and painted on paper) is a
very old and painstaking art form.

Although based on rules and
usages reflecting years of artistic
tradition, it allows for personal
expression by the artist and no
two are ever exactly alike.
The Indian exhibition itself is a
miniature of a way of life almost
unknown to the western man. It is
an incredible world inhabited by
aristocratic princes clad in rich
brocades, smoking from hookas,
riding magnificent elephants and
tigers; veiled ladies in diaphanous
silk; austere, shaven Brahmin
priests; god-like figures with many
arms chasing green demons, and
an array of flowers, peacocks,
wild animals and vegetation.
The subject matter ranges from
illustrations of religious epics, to
scenes of daily life,
representations of wars, and
ceremonies of court life. In each
illustration the colors are brilliant,
rich and glowing.
Varied Decoration
TTiere is a great deal of variety
in the works; not in the style of
the painting itself but in the
variations of costume and
decoration. A Maharajah sports a
fan-like pleated dress and
enormous sideburns and he is
matched in style and shape by his
attendants.
The social hierarchy is evident
in the paintings: a Sihk Guru
preparing to ride into battle seems
to float in the air while his
attendants, who are a quarter his
size, walk on the ground beneath

him. The Lord Rama's high rank
is shown both by his size and his
deep royal purple skin color. He is
attended in his exploits by
Hanuman, general of the
notorious monkey forces.
In one musical mode a young
woman is told "obey your
husband and do not offend him."
In another painting Ganesha, the
God of scholars who has an
elephant's head, four arms and an
enormous belly, is pampered by
his two wives.
Traditional Figures
Other gods such as cow-headed
Vishnu, the Serpent king, and
Krishna of the four arms, busily
search out demons and evil men
and preach great wisdoms.
The exhibit also includes many
beautiful ink drawings from the
von Breton collection and an
elaborate silver-inlaid pewter
Hookah (water pipe) from the
18th century that is covered with
processions of elephants, tigers,
Rajas and attendants.
The show is well labeled and
exhibited. It is an impressive
exhibition which fulfills a basic
function of art: it is extremely
enjoyable to view and appreciate
and it illustrates a different
perspective on living.
TTie exhibition will continue
through Nov. 4. Harriett® von
Breton will lecture on "The Art of
India" on Oct. 15 at 8 p.m. in
room 2 of the art building. There
will be no admission charge.
