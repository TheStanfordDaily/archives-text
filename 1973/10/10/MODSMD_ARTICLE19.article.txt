# Bruin Wishbone Fully Recovered
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
The UCLA Wishbone offense
should be running at full speed
Saturday at Stanford Stadium,
despite any contrary evidence you
may have seen on national
television four weeks ago.
"The demise of the Wishbone
at Lincoln, Neb. has been
exaggerated," UCLA sports
information director Vic Kelley
said yesterday at the Northern
California Football Writer's
luncheon. "The Wishbone is
operating well at this point.
"The team has recovered from
the embarrassment at Lincoln
[Nebraska ripped the Bruins,
40-13]," Kelley said while
scanning a sheet of statistics
which proved his point a few
seconds later.
"Kermit Johnson is averaging
8.1 yards a carry, James McAlister
5.4, John Sciarra 5.5 ...
"There's no question that this
is the most talented backfield
UCLA's ever had," Kelley said.
"It may be one of the quickest in
the nation."
The explosive Bruin backfield
has accounted for a mind-boggling
average of 52.6 points per game
since the opening game debacle.
Halfback Johnson and fullback
McAllister, the "Blair pair" from
Blair High School in Pasadena,
lead the UCLA ballcarriers, but
there's plenty of talent behind
them. ,
Russell Charles (14 carries, 114
yards) will start at the other
halfback spot and John Sciarra

(33 carries, 201 yards) will open
at quarterback.
Sciarra has split the
quarterback!ng duties with Mark
Harmon and UCLA coach Pepper
Rodgers has had a difficult time
deciding between the two
signal-callers. "I get a lot of letters
from girls who are mad because
Mark's not starting," Rodgers
said. "Mark's got the girls behind
him."'
Sciarra, however, has the
statistics behind him. Both
quarterbacks have been impressive
on the ground but Sciarra sports a
13-30 passing mark while Harmon
has connected on only four of 14
aerial efforts.
While Kelley was talking about
the Bruin offense, Stanford coach
Jack Christiansen warned the
writers not to forget UCLA's
defensive unit. "You don't hear
much about the UCLA defense,"
Christiansen said, "but they're
doing a very workmanlike job —
they have two good defensive
ends, strong linebackers and a
good secondary."
Christiansen said that Mike
Boryla would be Stanford's
starting quarterback and that the
Cards aren't overly awed by
UCLA's recent statistics. "We'll
certainly be the underdogs," Chris
said, "but we feel we have an
opportunity to win against any of
our Pac-8 opponents."

Cardinal linebacker Gordie
Riegel was named Pac-8 defensive
player of the week for his
performance Saturday during
Stanford's 24-0 victory over
Illinois. Riegel, who made 15
tackles against the Illini, also
earned Northern California
defensive player of the week
honors.

DAVE DOES IT — Senior Dave
Ottmar, previously best known
for his punting skills, played
quarterback for almost three
quarters Saturday against Illinois
and completed 11 of 19 passes for
132 yards. Ottmar was nominated
for Pac-8 offensive player of the
week, but that honor went to
UCLA running back Kermit
Johnson.
