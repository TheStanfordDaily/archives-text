# Carnegie Commission Report
## University Vitality In Danger 
### JIM WASCHER 
The Carnegie Commission on
Higher Education yesterday identified
faculty unionization as one of four
"new shocks" which may challenge
the "endurance, flexibility,
adaptability, and continuing vitality"
of American higher education during
the next 40 years.
The commission, which
summarized its six years of study in a
report released yesterday, said
politicalization of universities and
colleges, the possible future resurgence
of student activism and the slow but
perceptible spread of public control
could also threaten the gains made by
higher education in the 19605.
According to the commission, "The
1970s may belong to faculty activism
as the 1960s did to that of the
students."
Unions Not Here
However, University Vice Provost
Robert M. Rosenzweig believes that
faculty unionization is not imminent
here. "It is probably a fair guess that
we're not going to have it soon," said
Rosenzweig.
The vice provost did predict
dissatisfaction among the increasing
number of junior faculty members
who will not receive tenure now that
faculty expansion here has slowed.
President Richard Lyman said,
"The burden of proof is now heavier
on those recommending promotion"
for junior faculty. He added that the
University wishes to avoid "a rigid
system" cf promotion schedules which
would "make two nations out of the
faculty."
According to Lyman, the Carnegie
Commission's prediction of faculty
activism in the 1970s is "a facile stab
in the dark that probably doesn't have
much basis in fact."
The Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching created the
commission in July, 1967 to make a
systematic appraisal of higher
education and to suggest guidelines for
its development through the rest of
the century.
The commission, chaired by former
University of California President
Clark Kerr, issued 20 reports on
specific topics prior to the summation
released yesterday.
The report urged that "elite"
universities and colleges be protected
and encouraged as a means of
preserving the current quality of
higher education. It recommended
against homogenization of the student
bodies at these institutions.
Pride In Quality
Rosenzweig agreed with the
commission, warning that elitism
should not be considered "a dirty
word" in higher education. According
to Rosenzweig, "the future health of
society depends upon our willingness
to admit that some institutions are
better than others," and that quality is
"something to be proud of."
He added that "genuine
egalitarianism requires that those who
have exceptional abilities have the
opportunity to develop those abilities"
at universities such as Stanford.
The commission report also
recommended that campuses adopt
"Codes of Teaching Responsibility" to
direct more specifically professors'
efforts and to assist student evaluation
of faculty.
Lyman said last night that "the

thrust of the recommendation is
admirable." He added that the Faculty
Senate is currently developing "more
effective and more universally
applicable methods of evaluating
teaching."
Monetary Support
To help retain the current level of
achievement at American universities,
the commission said the undergraduate
divisions at these institutions should
receive monetary support equal to the
funding of the schools' graduate
divisions. According to the Carnegie
report, the ratio now averages about 1
to 1.5.
Lyman said Stanford has "never
divided the budget in such a way that
we could determine what this ratio is
here." He pointed out that faculty
instruction in both divisions made it
difficult to separate the costs of that
teaching into divisions.
Equality By 2000
The commission recommended that
"all remnants of inequality of
education opportunity due to race,
sex, family level of income, and
geographic location should be
overcome substantially by 1980 and as
completely as possible by the year
2000."
According to the commission, more
generous grants and improved
work-study and loan programs would
help eliminate high costs as an obstacle
to more equal educational
opportunity.
The Carnegie report also
encouraged the recruitment of more
women and minority group members
into faculty and administrative
positions. Rosenzweig said Stanford is
"moving about as rapidly as reasonable
people could expect" in this field.
Deferred Entrance
According to the commission,
students should have the option to be

admitted to, but to defer entrance to
college. Lyman said deferred entrance
"has been tried here quietly, with
individual attention to the reasons for
deferring."
However, the president said
entrance deferral on a large scale
would cause "considerable extra
planning problems" for the University.
He suggested that students delay
applying to universities rather than
defer their entrance.
Other recommendations made in
the final Carnegie Commission report
include limiting enrollment at
doctoral-granting institutions such as
Stanford to between 5000 and 20,000
students.

here." He pointed out that faculty
instruction in both divisions made it
difficult to separate the costs of that
teaching into divisions.
Equality By 2000
The commission recommended that
"all remnants of inequality of
education opportunity due to race,
sex, family level of income, and
geographic location should be
overcome substantially by 1980 and as
completely as possible by the year
2000."
According to the commission, more
generous grants and improved
work-study and loan programs would
help eliminate high costs as an obstacle
to more equal educational
opportunity.
The Carnegie report also
encouraged the recruitment of more
women and minority group members
into faculty and administrative
positions. Rosenzweig said Stanford is
"moving about as rapidly as reasonable
people could expect" in this field.
Deferred Entrance
According to the commission,
students should have the option to be

admitted to, but to defer entrance to
college. Lyman said deferred entrance
"has been tried here quietly, with
individual attention to the reasons for
deferring."
However, the president said
entrance deferral on a large scale
would cause "considerable extra
planning problems" for the University.
He suggested that students delay
applying to universities rather than
defer their entrance.
Other recommendations made in
the final Carnegie Commission report
include limiting enrollment at
doctoral-granting institutions such as
Stanford to between 5000 and 20,000
students.
The Carnegie Commission on
Higher Education yesterday identified
faculty unionization as one of four
"new shocks" which may challenge
the "endurance, flexibility,
adaptability, and continuing vitality"
of American higher education during
the next 40 years.
The commission, which
summarized its six years of study in a
report released yesterday, said
politicalization of universities and
colleges, the possible future resurgence
of student activism and the slow but
perceptible spread of public control
could also threaten the gains made by
higher education in the 19605.
According to the commission, "The
1970s may belong to faculty activism
as the 1960s did to that of the
students."
Unions Not Here
However, University Vice Provost
Robert M. Rosenzweig believes that
faculty unionization is not imminent
here. "It is probably a fair guess that
we're not going to have it soon," said
Rosenzweig.
The vice provost did predict
dissatisfaction among the increasing
number of junior faculty members
who will not receive tenure now that
faculty expansion here has slowed.
President Richard Lyman said,
"The burden of proof is now heavier
on those recommending promotion"
for junior faculty. He added that the
University wishes to avoid "a rigid
system" cf promotion schedules which
would "make two nations out of the
faculty."
According to Lyman, the Carnegie
Commission's prediction of faculty
activism in the 1970s is "a facile stab
in the dark that probably doesn't have
much basis in fact."
The Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching created the
commission in July, 1967 to make a
systematic appraisal of higher
education and to suggest guidelines for
its development through the rest of
the century.
The commission, chaired by former
University of California President
Clark Kerr, issued 20 reports on
specific topics prior to the summation
released yesterday.
The report urged that "elite"
universities and colleges be protected
and encouraged as a means of
preserving the current quality of
higher education. It recommended
against homogenization of the student
bodies at these institutions.
Pride In Quality
Rosenzweig agreed with the
commission, warning that elitism
should not be considered "a dirty
word" in higher education. According
to Rosenzweig, "the future health of
society depends upon our willingness
to admit that some institutions are
better than others," and that quality is
"something to be proud of."
He added that "genuine
egalitarianism requires that those who
have exceptional abilities have the
opportunity to develop those abilities"
at universities such as Stanford.
The commission report also
recommended that campuses adopt
"Codes of Teaching Responsibility" to
direct more specifically professors'
efforts and to assist student evaluation
of faculty.
Lyman said last night that "the

thrust of the recommendation is
admirable." He added that the Faculty
Senate is currently developing "more
effective and more universally
applicable methods of evaluating
teaching."
Monetary Support
To help retain the current level of
achievement at American universities,
the commission said the undergraduate
divisions at these institutions should
receive monetary support equal to the
funding of the schools' graduate
divisions. According to the Carnegie
report, the ratio now averages about 1
to 1.5.
Lyman said Stanford has "never
divided the budget in such a way that
we could determine what this ratio is
here." He pointed out that faculty

The report urged that "elite"
universities and colleges be protected
and encouraged as a means of
preserving the current quality of
higher education. It recommended
against homogenization of the student
bodies at these institutions.
Pride In Quality
Rosenzweig agreed with the
commission, warning that elitism
should not be considered "a dirty
word" in higher education. According
to Rosenzweig, "the future health of
society depends upon our willingness
to admit that some institutions are
better than others," and that quality is
"something to be proud of."
He added that "genuine
egalitarianism requires that those who
have exceptional abilities have the
opportunity to develop those abilities"
at universities such as Stanford.
The commission report also
recommended that campuses adopt
"Codes of Teaching Responsibility" to
direct more specifically professors'
efforts and to assist student evaluation
of faculty.
Lyman said last night that "the

thrust of the recommendation is
admirable." He added that the Faculty
Senate is currently developing "more
effective and more universally
applicable methods of evaluating
teaching."
Monetary Support
To help retain the current level of
achievement at American universities,
the commission said the undergraduate
divisions at these institutions should
receive monetary support equal to the
funding of the schools' graduate
divisions. According to the Carnegie
report, the ratio now averages about 1
to 1.5.
Lyman said Stanford has "never
divided the budget in such a way that
we could determine what this ratio is
here." He pointed out that faculty
instruction in both divisions made it
difficult to separate the costs of that
teaching into divisions.
Equality By 2000
The commission recommended that
"all remnants of inequality of
education opportunity due to race,
sex, family level of income, and
geographic location should be
overcome substantially by 1980 and as
completely as possible by the year
2000."
According to the commission, more
generous grants and improved
work-study and loan programs would
help eliminate high costs as an obstacle
to more equal educational
opportunity.
The Carnegie report also
encouraged the recruitment of more
women and minority group members
into faculty and administrative
positions. Rosenzweig said Stanford is
"moving about as rapidly as reasonable
people could expect" in this field.
Deferred Entrance
According to the commission,
students should have the option to be

admitted to, but to defer entrance to
college. Lyman said deferred entrance
"has been tried here quietly, with
individual attention to the reasons for
deferring."
However, the president said
entrance deferral on a large scale
would cause "considerable extra
planning problems" for the University.
He suggested that students delay
applying to universities rather than
defer their entrance.
Other recommendations made in
the final Carnegie Commission report
include limiting enrollment at
doctoral-granting institutions such as
Stanford to between 5000 and 20,000
students.
