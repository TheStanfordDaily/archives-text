## Will TV Ruin NFL Magic? 
### Don Tollefson 
Washington's thrilling come-from-behind victory
over Dallas Monday night proved once again that
the magic is not gone from professional football.
When Dallas running back Walt Garrison was
stopped one yard short of bringing the Cowboys
within an extra point of a tie with only seconds
remaining, it was the climax of a thoroughly
engrossing athletic contest.
In recent weeks, a number of sportswriters have
been whining about how the field goal and the zone
defense have taken all the zip out of the game.
Perhaps nothing short of a game similar to Cal's
54-49 win over Washington last Saturday would
satisfy them, but for me, a good defensive game can
often be more exciting than a free-wheeling
offensive one.
Still, pro football is not without its problems
these days, and one of the biggest comes not from
demonic defensive coaches, but from our dedicated
public servants on Capitol Hill. Realizing that
re-election time is never that far away, the politicos
saw a golden opportunity to pick up votes by lifting
the blackout on televising home football games in
the NFL.
Weekends filled with football games have become
battling points in many households over the past
few years. But picture if you will, 36 consecutive
hours of pro football, beginning at 9 p.m. on Friday
and ending at 9 a.m. on Sunday. All 12 pro games
each weekend could originate from Studio City,
California, so that all the players would be near the
studios where they film their shaving cream,
automobile and anti-drug commercials. Great.
Somehow the idea of all pro football games being
played on a back-lot in Hollywood is a bit
grotesque. But when you consider how much more
television-oriented pro football is today than it was

even five years ago, such a possibility is not all that
remote. Many boxing figures contend that
saturation telecasts of the sport during the 50's was
a major reason for the rapid decline in that sport's
popularity.
Pro football will be very hard to destroy, but in
four weeks of league action, the effect of lifting the
blackout rule is clear. During the first weekend of
the season more than 50,000 fans who had tickets
to sold out games decided to stay home, presumably
to watch the game on TV. This last weekend, the
figure had dropped to 40,000, which is still a
considerable amount.
Considering that 16,097 fans stayed away from
the Miami-New York Jets game Sunday in 80 degree
weather, it is probable that when bad weather
begins to hit most of the country, the figure will rise
dramatically.
Why should people freeze through a game, when
they can sit in their heated living rooms and watch
the game on TV, complete with instant replay, slow
motion and up-to-the-minute scores of other games?
Won't it be fun someday when we can watch pro
football complete with canned applause and boos.
Coaches will be replaced by computers and we'll all
eat synthetic hot dogs while watching the game at
home.
Everyone will be able to live a fully vicarious life
in front of their TV sets. Television has done much
to enhance the enjoyment of athletics, but wouldn't
it be ironic if it ended up destroying a sport like pro
football.
Hopefully the day will never come when it is just
another studio game show, complete with Monty
Hall and Hugh Downs. The game just wouldn't be
the same if you could trade for the linebacker
behind the curtain where Carol is standing.
