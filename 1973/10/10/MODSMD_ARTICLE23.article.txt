Judge Admits ITT Ruling 'Error'
TULSA, Okla. — A federal judge said yesterday
he had made "substantial error" in setting damages
in his antitrust ruling against International Business
Machines Corp. and would decide on amending his
order or granting a new trial next Tuesday.
In the ruling last month, U.S. District Court
Judge A. Sherman Christensen held that IBM,
world's largest computer manufacturer, was
monopolizing the computer accessory field. He
ordered IBM to pay the Telex Corp. $352.5 million.
IBM asked that he either amend the order or
grant a new trial.
"I have concluded that my computation of
antitrust damages against IBM involved substantial
error," Christensen said. "Accordingly, the
defendant's motion to amend findings, conclusions
and judgments, or in the alternative for a new trial
on the issue of damages, is hereby granted."
Saxbe Won't Seek Reelection
WASHINGTON — Republican Senate prospects
for 1974 suffered another blow yesterday when
Sen. William Saxbe of Ohio announced he won't
seek another term and sources said Sen. Marlow
Cook of Kentucky has reached a similar decision.
Saxbe, 57,' whose announcement has been
expected, cited "many reasons, mostly personal"
for the decision he said had been reached a year ago.
He said he held off his announcement in futile
hopes of averting GOP blood-letting in Ohio.
Cook said he would "neither confirm nor deny"
the report he had definitely decided against running
next year.
Paper Reports Beard Subpoena
DENVER — Dita Beard, former lobbyist for the
International Telephone & Telegraph Corp., said she
had been subpoenaed to testify before the special
Watergate grand jury in Washington, The Denver
Post reported yesterday.
Beard said she will try to avoid testifying before
the grand jury because of medical reasons, the

newspaper said in a copyright story.
Beard was reported to be the author of a memo
saying ITT through its Sheraton Hotel chain would
donate $400,000 to help finance the Republican
National Convention in return for the government's
dropping of antitrust actions against the
corporation.
The newspaper said Beard is attempting, through
her attorneys, to have the subpoena quashed. The
subpoena was issued by the special grand jury
investigating Watergate and "dirty tricks" during the
1972 presidential election, the paper said.
Ervin Committee Probes Hughes
WASHINGTON — The Senate Watergate
committee is investigating a secret $100,000
contribution from billionaire Howard Hughes to
President Nixon's friend Charles G. "Bebe" Rebozo,
committee sources said yesterday.
The sources said Rebozo has confirmed receiving
the money in two $50,000 cash installments around
1970, and claims to have returned it to Hughes last
spring.
The panel's investigators had been scheduled
yesterday to interview Chester Davis, a Hughes
lawyer to whom Rebozo said he returned the cash,
the sources said. But Davis canceled the interview,
and is scheduled to be questioned in private today.
Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., R-Conn., said
yesterday he would like to hear public testimony
from Rebozo and from Hughes himself. "The
matter has come up in committee," Weicker told
newsmen.
Weicker would give no details, except to say that
Hughes and Rebozo have been named in connection
with the panel's investigation of campaign finances.
Psychiatrist Calls Kemper Sane
SANTA CRUZ — A Palo Alto psychiatrist says
hulking Edmund Emil Kemper 111 is sane and able
to stand trial on charges of murdering his mother,
her best friend and six college coeds, Dist. Atty.

Kemper, 25, who stands 6-9 and weighs 280

pounds, has pleaded innocent and innocent by
reason of insanity to the mutilation murders of the
eight women and is scheduled to go on trial
Monday.
Santa Cruz County Superior Court Judge Harry
F. Brauer had appointed two psychiatrists to
determine whether Kemper is competent to stand
trial and at a hearing today he received the report
from one, Stanford Psychiatry Prof. Donald Lunde.

told newsmen later he had seen Lunde's report and
it found that Kemper is sane now and capable of
committing premeditated murder.
Judge Brauer continued the hearing until Friday
when the second psychiatric report from Dr. Joel
Fort of San Francisco will be submitted.

Saxbe Won't Seek Reelection
WASHINGTON — Republican Senate prospects
for 1974 suffered another blow yesterday when
Sen. William Saxbe of Ohio announced he won't
seek another term and sources said Sen. Marlow

Saxbe, 57,' whose announcement has been
expected, cited "many reasons, mostly personal"

hopes of averting GOP blood-letting in Ohio.
Cook said he would "neither confirm nor deny"

Paper Reports Beard Subpoena
DENVER — Dita Beard, former lobbyist for the
International Telephone & Telegraph Corp., said she
had been subpoenaed to testify before the special
Watergate grand jury in Washington, The Denver
Post reported yesterday.
Beard said she will try to avoid testifying before
the grand jury because of medical reasons, the

newspaper said in a copyright story.
Beard was reported to be the author of a memo
saying ITT through its Sheraton Hotel chain would
donate $400,000 to help finance the Republican
National Convention in return for the government's
dropping of antitrust actions against the
corporation.
The newspaper said Beard is attempting, through
her attorneys, to have the subpoena quashed. The
subpoena was issued by the special grand jury
investigating Watergate and "dirty tricks" during the
1972 presidential election, the paper said.
Ervin Committee Probes Hughes
WASHINGTON — The Senate Watergate
committee is investigating a secret $100,000
contribution from billionaire Howard Hughes to
President Nixon's friend Charles G. "Bebe" Rebozo,
committee sources said yesterday.
The sources said Rebozo has confirmed receiving
the money in two $50,000 cash installments around
1970, and claims to have returned it to Hughes last
spring.
The panel's investigators had been scheduled
yesterday to interview Chester Davis, a Hughes
lawyer to whom Rebozo said he returned the cash,
the sources said. But Davis canceled the interview,
and is scheduled to be questioned in private today.
Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., R-Conn., said
yesterday he would like to hear public testimony
from Rebozo and from Hughes himself. "The
matter has come up in committee," Weicker told
newsmen.
Weicker would give no details, except to say that
Hughes and Rebozo have been named in connection
with the panel's investigation of campaign finances.

SANTA CRUZ — A Palo Alto psychiatrist says
hulking Edmund Emil Kemper 111 is sane and able
to stand trial on charges of murdering his mother,
her best friend and six college coeds, Dist. Atty.

Kemper, 25, who stands 6-9 and weighs 280

pounds, has pleaded innocent and innocent by
reason of insanity to the mutilation murders of the
eight women and is scheduled to go on trial

for 1974 suffered another blow yesterday when
Sen. William Saxbe of Ohio announced he won't
seek another term and sources said Sen. Marlow
Cook of Kentucky has reached a similar decision.
Saxbe, 57,' whose announcement has been
expected, cited "many reasons, mostly personal"
for the decision he said had been reached a year ago.
He said he held off his announcement in futile
hopes of averting GOP blood-letting in Ohio.
Cook said he would "neither confirm nor deny"
the report he had definitely decided against running
next year.
Paper Reports Beard Subpoena
DENVER — Dita Beard, former lobbyist for the
International Telephone & Telegraph Corp., said she
had been subpoenaed to testify before the special
Watergate grand jury in Washington, The Denver
Post reported yesterday.
Beard said she will try to avoid testifying before
the grand jury because of medical reasons, the

newspaper said in a copyright story.
Beard was reported to be the author of a memo
saying ITT through its Sheraton Hotel chain would
donate $400,000 to help finance the Republican
National Convention in return for the government's
dropping of antitrust actions against the
corporation.
The newspaper said Beard is attempting, through
her attorneys, to have the subpoena quashed. The
subpoena was issued by the special grand jury
investigating Watergate and "dirty tricks" during the
1972 presidential election, the paper said.
Ervin Committee Probes Hughes
WASHINGTON — The Senate Watergate
committee is investigating a secret $100,000
contribution from billionaire Howard Hughes to
President Nixon's friend Charles G. "Bebe" Rebozo,
committee sources said yesterday.
The sources said Rebozo has confirmed receiving
the money in two $50,000 cash installments around
1970, and claims to have returned it to Hughes last
spring.
The panel's investigators had been scheduled
yesterday to interview Chester Davis, a Hughes
lawyer to whom Rebozo said he returned the cash,
the sources said. But Davis canceled the interview,
and is scheduled to be questioned in private today.
Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., R-Conn., said
yesterday he would like to hear public testimony
from Rebozo and from Hughes himself. "The
matter has come up in committee," Weicker told
newsmen.
Weicker would give no details, except to say that
Hughes and Rebozo have been named in connection
with the panel's investigation of campaign finances.
Psychiatrist Calls Kemper Sane
SANTA CRUZ — A Palo Alto psychiatrist says
hulking Edmund Emil Kemper 111 is sane and able
to stand trial on charges of murdering his mother,
her best friend and six college coeds, Dist. Atty.
Peter Chang Jr. revealed yesterday.
Kemper, 25, who stands 6-9 and weighs 280

pounds, has pleaded innocent and innocent by
reason of insanity to the mutilation murders of the
eight women and is scheduled to go on trial
Monday.
Santa Cruz County Superior Court Judge Harry
F. Brauer had appointed two psychiatrists to
determine whether Kemper is competent to stand
trial and at a hearing today he received the report
from one, Stanford Psychiatry Prof. Donald Lunde.
Its contents were not revealed in court but Chang
told newsmen later he had seen Lunde's report and
it found that Kemper is sane now and capable of
committing premeditated murder.
Judge Brauer continued the hearing until Friday
when the second psychiatric report from Dr. Joel
Fort of San Francisco will be submitted.

Judge Admits ITT Ruling 'Error'
TULSA, Okla. — A federal judge said yesterday
he had made "substantial error" in setting damages
in his antitrust ruling against International Business
Machines Corp. and would decide on amending his
order or granting a new trial next Tuesday.
In the ruling last month, U.S. District Court
Judge A. Sherman Christensen held that IBM,
world's largest computer manufacturer, was
monopolizing the computer accessory field. He
ordered IBM to pay the Telex Corp. $352.5 million.
IBM asked that he either amend the order or
grant a new trial.
"I have concluded that my computation of
antitrust damages against IBM involved substantial
error," Christensen said. "Accordingly, the
defendant's motion to amend findings, conclusions
and judgments, or in the alternative for a new trial
on the issue of damages, is hereby granted."
