# Chicano Committee To Replace Sanchez
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
Thirteen chicano students, faculty,
workers and staff selected by their
"respective constituencies" have
formed an interim "executive
committee" to function in place of an
assistant to the president for chicano
affairs, group spokesman Luis Islas
announced at a press conference
yesterday.
Islas, a staff associate in the General
Secretary's Office, said the committee
will work closely with University
administration officials to co-ordinate
chicano affairs on campus until
President Richard Lyman selects a new
chicano affairs adviser.
The committee will fill the void left
by the promotion last week of
Salvador Sanchez from assistant to the
president for chicano affairs to special
assistant to the President.
Sanchez' new role will include work
in general administration as well as
continued work in minority affairs,
according to Lyman.
Islas said he hopes to see a search
committee charged with filling the
chicano affairs adviser's post
appointed by the end of the month.
However, he doubted the University
would find a replacement for Sanchez
until spring quarter.
The executive committee has been
meeting with the administration to
co-ordinate chicano matters since this
summer, Islas said. "We have met
several times with |Vice Provost]
Raymond Bacchetti and [Vice Provost
for Faculty Affairs] Art Bienenstock
over the summer."
Islas also said Lyman gave them a
commitment this summer that the

position of chicano affairs adviser or
its functional equivalent "would still
be around for two or three more
years."
He added that he did not construe
this to mean the duties of, or the need
for, an adviser to the president for
chicano affairs would be eliminated in
two or three years.
"The position shouldn't be phased
out for the next hundred years.
Institutional racism won't be wiped
out at Stanford for the next hundred
years," Islas said.
Islas complimented Lyman for
having "a very good sense of the needs
of the chicano community. We in the
committee will be working to get the
goals of both communities (the
chicanos and the University I fulfilled.
Islas also said the committee will
attempt to expand the chicano affairs
adviser's office, which "might take
more than one person in the office."
As for funds and an office for the
committee, "we still have negotiations
with Bacchetti," Islas said, "but the
details will be worked out by Friday."
Lyman reaffirmed his commitment
to the committee last night saying he
hoped the position, but not its
functions could be eliminated when a
"solid enough, large enough" body of
chicanos became involved in the
campus in all positions.
"I think the matter of a position is
merely one of symbolism," Lyman
told the Daily. The eventual
elimination of a specific adviser for
each minority group does not
"represent a symbolic withdrawal of
our commitment to minority
programs," he stated.

The executive committee has been
meeting with the administration to
co-ordinate chicano matters since this
summer, Islas said. "We have met
several times with |Vice Provost]
Raymond Bacchetti and [Vice Provost
for Faculty Affairs] Art Bienenstock
over the summer."
Islas also said Lyman gave them a
commitment this summer that the

position of chicano affairs adviser or
its functional equivalent "would still
be around for two or three more
years."
He added that he did not construe
this to mean the duties of, or the need
for, an adviser to the president for
chicano affairs would be eliminated in
two or three years.
"The position shouldn't be phased
out for the next hundred years.
Institutional racism won't be wiped
out at Stanford for the next hundred
years," Islas said.
Islas complimented Lyman for
having "a very good sense of the needs
of the chicano community. We in the
committee will be working to get the
goals of both communities (the
chicanos and the University I fulfilled.
Islas also said the committee will
attempt to expand the chicano affairs
adviser's office, which "might take
more than one person in the office."
As for funds and an office for the
committee, "we still have negotiations
with Bacchetti," Islas said, "but the
details will be worked out by Friday."
Lyman reaffirmed his commitment
to the committee last night saying he
hoped the position, but not its
functions could be eliminated when a
"solid enough, large enough" body of
chicanos became involved in the
campus in all positions.
"I think the matter of a position is
merely one of symbolism," Lyman
told the Daily. The eventual
elimination of a specific adviser for
each minority group does not
"represent a symbolic withdrawal of
our commitment to minority
programs," he stated.
Thirteen chicano students, faculty,
workers and staff selected by their
"respective constituencies" have
formed an interim "executive
committee" to function in place of an
assistant to the president for chicano
affairs, group spokesman Luis Islas
announced at a press conference
yesterday.
Islas, a staff associate in the General
Secretary's Office, said the committee
will work closely with University
administration officials to co-ordinate
chicano affairs on campus until
President Richard Lyman selects a new
chicano affairs adviser.
The committee will fill the void left
by the promotion last week of
Salvador Sanchez from assistant to the
president for chicano affairs to special
assistant to the President.
Sanchez' new role will include work
in general administration as well as
continued work in minority affairs,
according to Lyman.
Islas said he hopes to see a search
committee charged with filling the
chicano affairs adviser's post
appointed by the end of the month.
However, he doubted the University
would find a replacement for Sanchez
until spring quarter.
