# ASSU, C-15 Voting Starts Today
## 
### STEPHEN CARTER 
Students vote today and tomorrow whether to accept
the controversial Committee of 15 (C-15) proposal
reforming the judicial system, and to elect a new ASSU
Senate.
The C-15 recommendation, known as the Stanford
Judicial Council (SJC), would provide a student majority
judicial system for the first time. However, the University
president, or a two-thirds vote of the ASSU Senate or
Faculty Senate, may revoke the one-student majority at
any time. Opponents have cited this as a major objection
to the system's approval.
Others, including the ASSU Council of Presidents, have
further criticized the random selection of student
members, pointing out that the Faculty Senate elects
faculty members.
Supporters, including current ASSU Senate chairman
Rocky Barber, have called the C-15 proposal a "first
step," arguing that both sides must compromise.
If approved, the proposal would replace the current
Campus Judicial Panel, which has a one-member faculty
majority, with a council of four students and three faculty
members. Fact finding under the SJC would still be done
by independent hearing officers. The ASSU, the Faculty

Senate and President Richard Lyman must approve the
C-15 recommendation before it can become effective.
Candidates for 20 ASSU Senate seats include 59
undergraduates and 13 graduate students. The new ASSU
Constitution allocates an equal number of seats to each of
the two divisions. Formerly, students voted for candidates
according to schools.
Each student can cast up to ten equally-weighted votes,
and the ten students in each division receiving the greatest
number of votes will be elected. The next ten graduate
and undergraduates become alternate members. Alternates
will rank in order of number of votes received. They will
enjoy all privileges of senators, except the vote, and when
a senator is absent from a meeting, the highest-ranking
alternate in attendance will vote in his place.
Polling places for the election include the history
corner, the Gradute School of Business lounge, the
Physics Tank and the Medical School lounge, all open
from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., and the Post Office and
Engineering Corner, open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Election officials do not plan to release results until
they receive the ballots from overseas campuses early next
week.
