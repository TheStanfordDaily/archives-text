# Overseas Programs To Have Overhaul
##

By DOYLE McMANUS
Overseas Studies Director Mark
Mancall said last night that major
changes can be expected in the
University's overseas programs.
"I don't really know where we're
going to be three, or five, or 10 years
from now," the associate history
professor said.
Speaking on KZSU's Campus
Conference, Mancall said he is pushing
for changes that will make overseas
academic programs more "flexible"
and "pluralistic."
Changes Needed
Mancall echoed the sentiments of
the December 1972 report of the
Presidential Commission for Review of
Overseas Campuses. The commission,
of which Mancall was a member, called
existing foreign studies programs
"unsatisfactory" and recommended
extensive changes.
The report was completed after
dropping enrollment at the then-five
overseas campuses prompted a
re-examination of the program's goals

and performance. The campus in
Vienna, which had suffered most from
declining student interest, closed
permanently at the end of summer
quarter, 1973.
"Maximum flexibility is the goal we
have," Mancall declared.
"Academic priorities," he
continued, "are primary. Where
academics and academic flexibility are
hampered, we will have to revise the
structure of the program."
As part of the drive toward
flexibility, Mancall noted, the Overseas
Campus Program is now called the
Overseas Studies Programs.
And if new programs are
established in new locations, they will
most definitely not be "overseas
campuses."
"No, we are not going to set up
campuses anywhere else," Mancall
responded to a reporter's question.
"Yes, we are beginning to explore the
possibility of 'centers' elsewhere."
Losing Money
Enrollment at the four campuses
continues to fluctuate "wildly,"
Mancall noted, and the program "has
operated for several years at a
loss .... It's heavily subsidized."
But he expects the University will
continue to support the program, and
believes financial considerations will
not prevent moves toward more
flexible programs.
"Cost is always a consideration," he
said. "I'm learning about the
constraints cost can impose on your
imagination."
Other possible changes include
instituting programs for students who
wish to attend classes or tutorials in
native universities, such as Oxford, but
live at the Stanford center; breaking
the pattern of two Stanford faculty
members at each campus; and moving
away from the idea of physical
'campuses' altogether.
"I can envision one time when a
center might have no American faculty
members, another time with as many
as three or four," Mancall said. "One
of our concerns should be to maximize
contacts between students and the
local faculty."
