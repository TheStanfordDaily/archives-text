# Zimbardo Contrasts Future, Present-Oriented Behavior
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER LARRY LITVAK 
Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo
said yesterday that the key to
happiness may be found in combining
immediate gratification with an
orientation toward future goals.
Zimbardo spoke to about 500
persons in Memorial Auditorium in the
first presentation of the Tuesday
Evening Lecture Series.
The lecture, entitled "The Now
Generation Versus The
Here-Tomorrow, Gone-Today
Generation," contrasted opposing
lifestyles — the future-dominated
outlook of the "IBM mentality" and
the restricted perspective of the
ghetto-dweller, who must live in the
present.
"To be involved in the process is to
be involved in the present, to be
involved in the product is to be
involved in the future," Zimbardo
said.
Consequences
Both mentalities, according to
Zimbardo, have positive and negative
consequences. The upper and middle
classes, to different extents "do not

allow gratification of impulses to
interfere with their future," enabling
these people to get ahead.
Although this leads to "success," it
deprives them of many day-to-day
pleasures, he explained.
"The life we lead gets us things but
is boring as hell — we can't enjoy
sex . . . children ... nature .. . our
selves because we can't take time out,"
Zimbardo said.
On the other hand, ghetto-dwellers
are inordinately concerned with the
present, Zimbardo said, because they
have no confidence in the future.
Safer
"The future cannot be afforded by
ghetto-dwellers — given their
environment, it is safer for them not
to trust in the future," he explained.
This results in what is commonly
called "pathological" or "antisocial"
behavior, such as vandalism and the
pursuit of sensually-rewarding
experience such as drinking and sex,
Zimbardo argued.
The advantage of this
present-oriented time-frame is that it
allows a heightened sensitivity to
experience.

During the past year, Zimbardo and
his wife have produced empirical data
demonstrating that future-oriented
Stanford students can have their time
perspective manipulated so that they
become preoccupied with the present.
Concepts Altered
In his experiments, Zimbardo said,
hypnotically-trained subjects had their
normal concepts of past, present and
future altered. With past and future
virtually eliminated and present
expanded, the subjects exhibited a
"love-war" syndrome.
The subjects' behavior became
totally uncontrollable, Zimbardo said,
showing both extreme joy and anger.
"The real danger of expanded
present is that people cannot be
controlled." This, Zimbardo said, has
particularly important implications for
social agencies, which often
ineffectively rely on future-dependent
threats, incentives and rewards.
"One must voluntarily choose his
time orientation appropriate to
context of experience. It doesn't have
to be one or the other (time frame]
and if it is, you lose," Zimbardo
concluded.

ghetto-dweller, who must live in the
present.
"To be involved in the process is to
be involved in the present, to be
involved in the product is to be
involved in the future," Zimbardo
said.
Consequences
Both mentalities, according to
Zimbardo, have positive and negative
consequences. The upper and middle
classes, to different extents "do not

allow gratification of impulses to
interfere with their future," enabling
these people to get ahead.
Although this leads to "success," it
deprives them of many day-to-day
pleasures, he explained.
"The life we lead gets us things but
is boring as hell — we can't enjoy
sex . . . children ... nature .. . our
selves because we can't take time out,"
Zimbardo said.
On the other hand, ghetto-dwellers
are inordinately concerned with the
present, Zimbardo said, because they
have no confidence in the future.
Safer
"The future cannot be afforded by
ghetto-dwellers — given their
environment, it is safer for them not
to trust in the future," he explained.
This results in what is commonly
called "pathological" or "antisocial"
behavior, such as vandalism and the
pursuit of sensually-rewarding
experience such as drinking and sex,
Zimbardo argued.
The advantage of this
present-oriented time-frame is that it
allows a heightened sensitivity to
experience.

During the past year, Zimbardo and
his wife have produced empirical data
demonstrating that future-oriented
Stanford students can have their time
perspective manipulated so that they
become preoccupied with the present.
Concepts Altered
In his experiments, Zimbardo said,
hypnotically-trained subjects had their
normal concepts of past, present and
future altered. With past and future
virtually eliminated and present
expanded, the subjects exhibited a
"love-war" syndrome.
The subjects' behavior became
totally uncontrollable, Zimbardo said,
showing both extreme joy and anger.
"The real danger of expanded
present is that people cannot be
controlled." This, Zimbardo said, has
particularly important implications for
social agencies, which often
ineffectively rely on future-dependent
threats, incentives and rewards.
"One must voluntarily choose his
time orientation appropriate to
context of experience. It doesn't have
to be one or the other (time frame]
and if it is, you lose," Zimbardo
concluded.

TIME FOR THINKING — Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo contrasted
future-directed and present-oriented behavior last night. Zimbardo spoke to
about 500 persons in Memorial Auditorium.
Psychology Prof. Philip Zimbardo
said yesterday that the key to
happiness may be found in combining
immediate gratification with an
orientation toward future goals.
Zimbardo spoke to about 500
persons in Memorial Auditorium in the
first presentation of the Tuesday
Evening Lecture Series.
The lecture, entitled "The Now
Generation Versus The
Here-Tomorrow, Gone-Today
Generation," contrasted opposing
lifestyles — the future-dominated
outlook of the "IBM mentality" and
the restricted perspective of the
ghetto-dweller, who must live in the
present.
"To be involved in the process is to
be involved in the present, to be
involved in the product is to be
