## Background Of Middle East Conflict 
### 
: Bill Evert

Suppose a war breaks out
between Ruritania and Walldavia,
two hypothetical states which we
shjill use for purposes of analysis.
In determining war guilt, it is not
enough to know merely who fired
the first shot or who crossed what
line first.
Instead an in-depth historical
inquiry is necessary. If the
Ruritanians have in the past
Conquered and subdued or
dispossessed half of the
Walldavian people, that does make
a difference when one is trying to
determine war guilt.
The political roots of the
present-day conflict in the Middle
East go back to the World War I
era. At that time, officials of the
British Empire promised in
somewhat vague terms a
homeland in Palestine for
organized Zionism and promised
national independence in the
Middle East to Arab nationalist
leaders.
Without in any way
acknowledging the rightfulness of
British imperialist meddling, we
can distinguish between these
promises by noting that the Arabs
were struggling to throw off the
foreign rule of the Ottoman Turks
and to achieve national
self-determination, whereas the
Zionists were foreigners laying
claim to the land the Arabs were
living on.
Promises Never Kept
In any case, the British never
fulfilled either promise. Britain
and her allies divided up the land
of the old Ottoman Empire, and
Britain took control of Palestine.
Several surveys covering land
tenure in British Palestine in the
late 1940s just before the
formation of the State of Israel
show that Arabs owned 49
percent of the land in Palestine;
Jews, six percent; government
land and land owned in common
by Arab and Jewish villages, six
percent. The rest was desert, some
of which was the regular pasturage
of Bedouin tribes. Included in the
category of government land by
these surveys was territory
claimed by Ottoman sultans and
their successors, but occupied for
generations by thousands of Arab
peasants who claimed the
equivalent of freehold tenure.
Of further importance is the
fact that the Zionist Jews bought
most of their land from feudal

landlords, whose claims to the
land originated in conquest, not in
cultivation.
Large Landowners
A. Granott, an Israeli land
expert whose writings are quoted
by both Palestinians and Zionists,
notes that "no less than 90.6
percent of all [Jewish]
acquisitions were of land which
formerly belonged to large
landowners, while from fellaheen
[Arab farmers] only 9.4 percent
was purchased."
The study "Land Ownership in
Palestine, 1880-1948," published
by the Office of the Premier of
the State of Israel, also states that
"most of the Jewish land
purchases involved large tracts
belonging to absentee-owners."
Thus, an additional question of
justice arises because of the feudal
system in early twentieth-century
Palestine. According to the
libertarian theory of justice, a
feudal landlord is not the
legitimate owner of land; instead,
the land belongs to his bondsman
who has been homesteading it.
Thus the Zionist settlers obtained
a clear and just title only in cases
in which previously unowned land
was homesteaded or in which land
was bought from native
Palestinians.
Justifications
One of the justifications often
given for Israeli seizure of Arab
houses and farmlands after the
formation of the State of Israel is
that the Arabs fled after having
been orderd to leave by the radio
broadcasts of the Arab political
leadership.
However, subsequent scholarly
examination of the monitoring
transcripts kept by the British
Broadcasting Corporation and the
U.S. Central Intelligence Agency
shows no evidence that orders to
leave were broadcast and shows
that some exhortations not to
evacuate were broadcast.
Apparently the confusion of
battle and fear of the terrorism of
some Zionist military organizations
like the Irgun group prompted
departures. Nonetheless, even
if it could be shown beyond a
shadow of a doubt that the Arab
people of Palestine had been
ordered to leave, this does not
alter the legitimacy of their title
to the land.
There is now some increased
consciousness among Israeli

intellectuals of the fact that they
live on stolen land. During the
summer of 1972, members of the
literary intelligentsia argued that
the Israeli government should
permit the Arab inhabitants of the
villages of Ikrit and Berem to
return to the homes from which
25 years before they had been
expelled, in a supposedly
temporary evacuation.
Israeli Premier Golda Meir
told these intellectuals that
restoring the rights of these
pro-Israeli Arabs would set a
dangerous precedent. The New
York Times said the Israeli press

reported her fearing that all sorts
of claims might be put forward,
by hundreds of thousands of
refugees of the 1948 war.
Although the territory
controlled by the Israeli
government has expanded
considerably over the years,
Israel's might does not make her
right. One can only hope that
eventually justice will prevail and
that the Palestinian Arab refugees
will once again be masters in their
own homes.
