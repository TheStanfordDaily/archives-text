# End Selective Meddling
## U.S. Should Not Interfere With Chile 
### 
Chris Hocker

Salvador Allende's government
in Chile bites the dust, and the
Stanford community raises the
standard in his defense.
A double standard.
What is happening now in Chile
is inexcusable. What was
happening before the coup in
Chile was equally inexcusible. Just
as the wave of political executions
and book-burnings is a flagrant
dismissal of basic human rights, so
was the runaway inflation and
forcible resistance to protest that
characterized the Allende regime.
Would you rather starve to
death, or be lined up against a
stadium wall and shot? Would you
rather be tear-gassed by the
military under Allende, or the
military under the new
leadership?
The rate of inflation under
Allende was about 1 percent per
day. That means that a pair of
shoes that cost $10 in early
January cost $20 by mid-April.
Strikes and other forms of
organized protest were
increasingly common in Chile
before the coup. The
demonstrators were from all
phases of Chilean society, with a
large number being middle-class

housewives and small
businessmen. More and more
frequently, when these protests
would occur, Allende would call
out the troops in order to drive
the businessmen back to work and
the housewives back to their
kitchens.
Is this sort of thing preferable
to being rounded up inside a
soccer stadium? Probably. But not
much.
One gets the feeling, however,
that the Stanford community will
condone political and economic
repression when perpetrated by a
Marxist against the middle class,
but not the other way around.
This brings us to the double
standard: Is a middle-class
businessman any less entitled to
political and economic freedom
than a lower-class worker or a
Marxist intellectual? Do human
rights apply selectively, or are
they applicable across the board?
The argument that the United
States' opposition to the Allende
government gave him no choice
but to inflate the economy is
attractive, but it does not hold up.
The willingness
to suspect the United States in the
Allende overthrow is

understandable in light of what
has gone on before in other
countries. But intellectual rigor
requires that assumptions be made
on the basis of fact, not
speculation.
Subjective Interference
Even assuming that the United
States applied some kind of world
pressure that, in a roundabout
way, became a factor in Allende's
demise, the present demand at
Stanford that our government
apply counter-pressure against the
military regime is nothing short of
amazing. If the U.S. is to interfere
in outside affairs on behalf of one
group, why should it not interfere
on behalf of all groups? To
advocates of this sort of selective
meddling, or neo-Kennedyism, the
question merely becomes one of
who they think is the Good Guy
and who is the Bad Guy in the
country in question, and the
decision is totally subjective.
The novelist Tolstoy was once
asked the difference between
revolutionary repression and
reactionary repression. In flawless
Russian he replied: "The
difference between dog-shit and
cat-shit." Stanford students
should realize that Chileans have

only been transferred from one
pile to the other, and that further
interference from the outside will
do nothing to clean up the mess.

The willingness
to suspect the United States in the
Allende overthrow is

understandable in light of what
has gone on before in other
countries. But intellectual rigor
requires that assumptions be made
on the basis of fact, not
speculation.
Subjective Interference
Even assuming that the United
States applied some kind of world
pressure that, in a roundabout
way, became a factor in Allende's
demise, the present demand at
Stanford that our government
apply counter-pressure against the
military regime is nothing short of
amazing. If the U.S. is to interfere
in outside affairs on behalf of one
group, why should it not interfere
on behalf of all groups? To
advocates of this sort of selective
meddling, or neo-Kennedyism, the
question merely becomes one of
who they think is the Good Guy
and who is the Bad Guy in the
country in question, and the
decision is totally subjective.
The novelist Tolstoy was once
asked the difference between
revolutionary repression and
reactionary repression. In flawless
Russian he replied: "The
difference between dog-shit and
cat-shit." Stanford students
should realize that Chileans have

only been transferred from one
pile to the other, and that further
interference from the outside will
do nothing to clean up the mess.

Salvador Allende's government
in Chile bites the dust, and the
Stanford community raises the
standard in his defense.
A double standard.
What is happening now in Chile
is inexcusable. What was
happening before the coup in
Chile was equally inexcusible. Just
as the wave of political executions
and book-burnings is a flagrant
dismissal of basic human rights, so
was the runaway inflation and
forcible resistance to protest that
characterized the Allende regime.
Would you rather starve to
death, or be lined up against a
stadium wall and shot? Would you
rather be tear-gassed by the
military under Allende, or the
military under the new
leadership?
The rate of inflation under
Allende was about 1 percent per
day. That means that a pair of
shoes that cost $10 in early
January cost $20 by mid-April.
Strikes and other forms of
organized protest were
increasingly common in Chile
before the coup. The
demonstrators were from all
phases of Chilean society, with a
large number being middle-class

housewives and small
businessmen. More and more
frequently, when these protests
would occur, Allende would call
out the troops in order to drive
the businessmen back to work and
the housewives back to their
kitchens.
Is this sort of thing preferable
to being rounded up inside a
soccer stadium? Probably. But not
much.
One gets the feeling, however,
that the Stanford community will
condone political and economic
repression when perpetrated by a
Marxist against the middle class,
but not the other way around.
This brings us to the double
standard: Is a middle-class
businessman any less entitled to
political and economic freedom
than a lower-class worker or a
Marxist intellectual? Do human
rights apply selectively, or are
they applicable across the board?
The argument that the United
States' opposition to the Allende
government gave him no choice
but to inflate the economy is
attractive, but it does not hold up.
