# Agnew Resigns, Admits Tax Evasion
## Stanford Experts Foresee Muddled Political Future 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Stanford experts on law and politics
were as surprised as anyone by Vice
President Spiro Agnew's resignation
yesterday, but they still managed to
offer some opinions on what will
happen next.
The 25th Amendment to the
Constitution says the president must
nominate a new vice president
"whenever there is a vacancy in the
office."
The nominee must be approved "by
a majority vote of both houses of
Congress," according to the
amendment. That phrase has stirred
some debate among constitutional
experts as to whether each house must
separately approve the nominee, or
vole in joint session.
But Law Prof. Gerald Gunther, a
nationally recognized constitutional
scholar, says the evidence leaves "the
pretty clear impression that this
[amendment] contemplates separate
votes by each house."
ABA Plan
When the amendment was first
debated in 1966, the American Bar
Association proposed a plan that
"specifically called for a joint session
of Congress to vote," Gunther said.
"The proposal that eventually came
out of Congress dropped the section
that called for a joint session," he said.
But Gunther admitted there will
probably be "a lot of debate" over the
question.
"I see no reason why there
shouldn't be hearings on this
nomination," Gunther added, noting
that other presidential appointments
normally go through the hearing
process. But he said Congress might
choose to hold joint hearings with
separate reports to each house.
While Gunther seemed rather
definite about how the nomination
procedure will work, political science
professors weren't at all sure about the
name that will be submitted to
Congress to fill Agnew's post.
'Really Hard'
"Any speculation on that at this
point is really hard," said Prof. John
Manley, more or less summing up
faculty opinion.
But while they couldn't really come
up with a name, several of the political
science professors did suggest
requirements they felt any nominee
would have to meet.
"It's quite clear that there are going
to be many members of the
Democratic party who are going to
attempt to demand that the nominee
Nixon chooses be apolitical," Manley

said. "Someone who is sufficiently
prestigious and sufficiently impotent
that he is a legitimate contender for
the vice presidency and no threat in
1976.
"Whether or not this group of
Democrats can make that stick is an
open question ... I would guess that
they would not be able to reject the
presidential nominee," Manley said.
Solid Front
He claimed that as long as
congressional Republicans maintain a
solid front, enough Democrats "would
be inclined to go along with the
President on his choice" to force the
nominee through.
But Manley warned that nominating
the wrong man might divide the GOP
and make it impossible for the
appointment to be approved. "Nixon
would be crazy to nominate either
[New York Governor Nelson]
Rockefeller or [Arizona Senator
Barry] Goldwater. While they're
getting older, they still represent the
two different wings of the party," he
pointed out.
Manley also said that John
Connally, former Texas governor who
recently became a Republican, would
cause too much friction within the
party to be a practical choice.
Manley's colleague Richard Brody
disagreed. "I would guess that since
both houses of Congress are controlled
by democrats that they are not going
to set somebody up to have a running
start in 1976," he told the Daily.
Even Goldwater
"But it's very hard to guarantee that
whoever gets to be vice president
won't give it a try in '76," Brody
cautioned. He said even Goldwater,
who took a terrible drubbing in his try
for the presidency in 1964, would be a
potential candidate — "although the
Democrats might like to run against
him."
Both Manley and Brody agreed that
the nominee must above all "be
cleaner than a hound's tooth."
Prof. Hubert Marshall felt that
almost any nominee who was
"qualified and honest" would clear
Congress, although he admitted "It's
impossible to tell what those macaroni
spines in Congress will do."
"Congress will vote for a man if
they think he's qualified and honest,"
Marshall said. "That's where [Supreme
Court nominee G. Harold Carswell]
went down the drain. He just wasn't
qualified."
Curiously, all three professors
mentioned Attorney General Elliot
Richardson, the man who authorized
the investigation of Agnew, as
someone who might fit the profile.
And nearly everyone must agree
with Law Prof. William Cohen, who
observed that "if the President finds
someone who has the support of
Congress, procedures won't matter; if
he doesn't, procedures won't help."

the nominee must above all "be
cleaner than a hound's tooth."
Prof. Hubert Marshall felt that
almost any nominee who was
"qualified and honest" would clear
Congress, although he admitted "It's
impossible to tell what those macaroni
spines in Congress will do."
"Congress will vote for a man if
they think he's qualified and honest,"
Marshall said. "That's where [Supreme
Court nominee G. Harold Carswell]
went down the drain. He just wasn't
qualified."
Curiously, all three professors
mentioned Attorney General Elliot
Richardson, the man who authorized
the investigation of Agnew, as
someone who might fit the profile.
And nearly everyone must agree
with Law Prof. William Cohen, who
observed that "if the President finds
someone who has the support of
Congress, procedures won't matter; if
he doesn't, procedures won't help."
Stanford experts on law and politics
were as surprised as anyone by Vice
President Spiro Agnew's resignation
yesterday, but they still managed to
offer some opinions on what will
happen next.
The 25th Amendment to the
Constitution says the president must
nominate a new vice president
"whenever there is a vacancy in the
office."
The nominee must be approved "by
a majority vote of both houses of
Congress," according to the
amendment. That phrase has stirred
some debate among constitutional
experts as to whether each house must
separately approve the nominee, or
vole in joint session.
But Law Prof. Gerald Gunther, a
nationally recognized constitutional
scholar, says the evidence leaves "the
pretty clear impression that this
[amendment] contemplates separate
votes by each house."
ABA Plan
When the amendment was first
debated in 1966, the American Bar
Association proposed a plan that
"specifically called for a joint session
of Congress to vote," Gunther said.
"The proposal that eventually came
out of Congress dropped the section
that called for a joint session," he said.
But Gunther admitted there will
probably be "a lot of debate" over the
question.
"I see no reason why there
shouldn't be hearings on this
nomination," Gunther added, noting
that other presidential appointments
normally go through the hearing
process. But he said Congress might
choose to hold joint hearings with
separate reports to each house.
While Gunther seemed rather
definite about how the nomination
procedure will work, political science
professors weren't at all sure about the
name that will be submitted to
Congress to fill Agnew's post.
'Really Hard'
"Any speculation on that at this
point is really hard," said Prof. John
Manley, more or less summing up
faculty opinion.
But while they couldn't really come
up with a name, several of the political
science professors did suggest
requirements they felt any nominee
would have to meet.
"It's quite clear that there are going
to be many members of the
Democratic party who are going to
attempt to demand that the nominee
Nixon chooses be apolitical," Manley

said. "Someone who is sufficiently
prestigious and sufficiently impotent
that he is a legitimate contender for
the vice presidency and no threat in
1976.
"Whether or not this group of
Democrats can make that stick is an
open question ... I would guess that
they would not be able to reject the
presidential nominee," Manley said.
Solid Front
He claimed that as long as
congressional Republicans maintain a
solid front, enough Democrats "would
be inclined to go along with the
President on his choice" to force the
nominee through.
But Manley warned that nominating
the wrong man might divide the GOP
and make it impossible for the
appointment to be approved. "Nixon
would be crazy to nominate either
[New York Governor Nelson]
Rockefeller or [Arizona Senator
Barry] Goldwater. While they're
getting older, they still represent the
two different wings of the party," he
pointed out.
Manley also said that John
Connally, former Texas governor who
recently became a Republican, would
cause too much friction within the
party to be a practical choice.
Manley's colleague Richard Brody
disagreed. "I would guess that since
both houses of Congress are controlled
by democrats that they are not going
to set somebody up to have a running
start in 1976," he told the Daily.
Even Goldwater
"But it's very hard to guarantee that
whoever gets to be vice president
won't give it a try in '76," Brody
cautioned. He said even Goldwater,
who took a terrible drubbing in his try
for the presidency in 1964, would be a
potential candidate — "although the
Democrats might like to run against
him."

Manley also said that John
Connally, former Texas governor who
recently became a Republican, would
cause too much friction within the
party to be a practical choice.
Manley's colleague Richard Brody
disagreed. "I would guess that since
both houses of Congress are controlled
by democrats that they are not going
to set somebody up to have a running
start in 1976," he told the Daily.
Even Goldwater
"But it's very hard to guarantee that
whoever gets to be vice president
won't give it a try in '76," Brody
cautioned. He said even Goldwater,
who took a terrible drubbing in his try
for the presidency in 1964, would be a
potential candidate — "although the
Democrats might like to run against
him."
Both Manley and Brody agreed that
the nominee must above all "be
cleaner than a hound's tooth."
Prof. Hubert Marshall felt that
almost any nominee who was
"qualified and honest" would clear
Congress, although he admitted "It's
impossible to tell what those macaroni
spines in Congress will do."
"Congress will vote for a man if
they think he's qualified and honest,"
Marshall said. "That's where [Supreme
Court nominee G. Harold Carswell]
went down the drain. He just wasn't
qualified."
Curiously, all three professors
mentioned Attorney General Elliot
Richardson, the man who authorized
the investigation of Agnew, as
someone who might fit the profile.
And nearly everyone must agree
with Law Prof. William Cohen, who
observed that "if the President finds
someone who has the support of
Congress, procedures won't matter; if
he doesn't, procedures won't help."
