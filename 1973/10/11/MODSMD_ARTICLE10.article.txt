# No Nostalgia For McGovern
## Lacks Basic Understanding 
### 
After reading Mark Weaver's "Watergate Trial,
McGovem Nostalgia," I really could not blame his
impetus for its exposition. After all, it's only human
nature to enjoy being right, and Watergate certainly
9eems to vindicate one's support for McGovern. I
would agree that one should be disgusted at the
motivation that led to Watergate; nevertheless, one
must still make the distinction as to whether, given
this problem and many others, McGovern was the
man to correct them.
At the expense of being ostracized by the
Stanford community, let me state at the outset that
McGovem lacked a basic philosophical
understanding of both the foreign and economic
spheres. Because of limitations of space and the
probability of boring the reader, allow me to
concentrate only on the former.
The accomplishments of the next four years, in
all probability, will affect the course of
international events for the next forty. For instance,
the further development of our new relationship
with China is both a symptom and a basis of the
transformation of a world bipolar — both militarily
anc\7politically into one less bipolar militarily and
certainly multipolar politically. The new diplomatic
contacts with China and China's presence in the
U.N. have not only given the Chinese more of an
interest in the current international structure but
also adds nuance into countries' relationships with
one another.
Pivotal Discussions
Furthermore, after twenty-eight years of flux,
the European Security Conference is finally going to
herald recognition of the changed international
structure wrought by WWII. The SALT Talks on
offensive weapons and Mutual and Balanced Force
Reduction Talks are going to define the form of
international conflict within this new international
structure. While the negotiations are more
protracted and diverse, there is no reason that their
outcome will not have the impact of the 1815
Congress of Vienna rather than that of the 1856
Treaty of Paris or the 1919 Treaty of Versailles. The
question of the predominance of war or peace in
our lives will be decided through the structure that
is created.
McGovern lacked cognizance of the creation of
this newly structured world. For example, his
advocation of unilateral U.S. troop withdrawal from
Europe not only would have destroyed our
bargaining position to force any Soviet withdrawal
and hence reduce tensions but alsoenvincesa lackof

strategic philosophy.
The preponderance of Soviet troops would allow
her to pressure western Europe to acquiesce to her
demands, such as influence in West Berlin, an aim
even the Cuban crisis of 1962 was directed at. (The
U.S.-Soviet detente hardly outdates the problem,
for history has shown its temporary nature once
Soviet needs an 1 satisfied: the Western press has
claimed in almost every decade of Soviet existence
that a new attitude in Soviet policy had ushered the
way for a new period of cooperation and detente,
e.g. the "Spirit of Geneva.")
In the face of Soviet conventional troops, would
the American people risk the mutual destruction
implied in the threat of our nuclear deterrent to
save, say, West Berlin? I suspect no. With nuclear
destruction as our only deterrent, U.S. policy is
helpless, and the Soviet Union, with their huge
armed forces, can achieve limited policy aims by
posing the alternative of U.S. acquiescence or
mutual destruction.
McGovem's frequent comment that the U.S. has
the power to destroy every city in the Soviet Union
four times over also portrays his lack of
understanding. What must be considered is the
delivery system of such power, e.g. missiles or the
SAC, the opposing defenses against them, and the
disproportion in offensive weapons between two
nations which a surprise attack could capitalize
upon. Not to mention that any level of power that
cannot be matched by the U.S. will force her to
acquiesce to Soviet aims or use power highly
disproportionate to the aggression it faces; clearly
an unacceptable choice. If you declare this means
that every gradation of Soviet military technology
necessitates a corresponding U.S. gradation, which
would escalate into unbelievable arms costs, you are
right. That is the reason why the SALT Talks are so
crucial in both the limitation and definition of the
form of confrontation.
All in all, since the U.S. has lost its insular
position the oceans provided her in the nineteenth
century, we cannot believe that our domestic events
can operate with or without a stable international
system. Realizing I have space for only a few
examples, I only hope I have shown that, despite
Watergate, there is another side to the outcome of a
McGovern presidency.

the further development of our new relationship
with China is both a symptom and a basis of the
transformation of a world bipolar — both militarily
anc\7politically into one less bipolar militarily and
certainly multipolar politically. The new diplomatic
contacts with China and China's presence in the
U.N. have not only given the Chinese more of an
interest in the current international structure but
also adds nuance into countries' relationships with
one another.
Pivotal Discussions
Furthermore, after twenty-eight years of flux,
the European Security Conference is finally going to
herald recognition of the changed international
structure wrought by WWII. The SALT Talks on
offensive weapons and Mutual and Balanced Force
Reduction Talks are going to define the form of
international conflict within this new international
structure. While the negotiations are more
protracted and diverse, there is no reason that their
outcome will not have the impact of the 1815
Congress of Vienna rather than that of the 1856
Treaty of Paris or the 1919 Treaty of Versailles. The
question of the predominance of war or peace in
our lives will be decided through the structure that
is created.
McGovern lacked cognizance of the creation of
this newly structured world. For example, his
advocation of unilateral U.S. troop withdrawal from
Europe not only would have destroyed our
bargaining position to force any Soviet withdrawal
and hence reduce tensions but alsoenvincesa lackof

strategic philosophy.
The preponderance of Soviet troops would allow
her to pressure western Europe to acquiesce to her
demands, such as influence in West Berlin, an aim
even the Cuban crisis of 1962 was directed at. (The
U.S.-Soviet detente hardly outdates the problem,
for history has shown its temporary nature once
Soviet needs an 1 satisfied: the Western press has
claimed in almost every decade of Soviet existence
that a new attitude in Soviet policy had ushered the
way for a new period of cooperation and detente,
e.g. the "Spirit of Geneva.")
In the face of Soviet conventional troops, would
the American people risk the mutual destruction
implied in the threat of our nuclear deterrent to
save, say, West Berlin? I suspect no. With nuclear
destruction as our only deterrent, U.S. policy is
helpless, and the Soviet Union, with their huge
armed forces, can achieve limited policy aims by
posing the alternative of U.S. acquiescence or
mutual destruction.
McGovem's frequent comment that the U.S. has
the power to destroy every city in the Soviet Union
four times over also portrays his lack of
understanding. What must be considered is the
delivery system of such power, e.g. missiles or the
SAC, the opposing defenses against them, and the
disproportion in offensive weapons between two
nations which a surprise attack could capitalize
upon. Not to mention that any level of power that
cannot be matched by the U.S. will force her to
acquiesce to Soviet aims or use power highly
disproportionate to the aggression it faces; clearly
an unacceptable choice. If you declare this means
that every gradation of Soviet military technology
necessitates a corresponding U.S. gradation, which
would escalate into unbelievable arms costs, you are
right. That is the reason why the SALT Talks are so
crucial in both the limitation and definition of the
form of confrontation.
All in all, since the U.S. has lost its insular
position the oceans provided her in the nineteenth
century, we cannot believe that our domestic events
can operate with or without a stable international
system. Realizing I have space for only a few
examples, I only hope I have shown that, despite
Watergate, there is another side to the outcome of a
McGovern presidency.

After reading Mark Weaver's "Watergate Trial,
McGovem Nostalgia," I really could not blame his
impetus for its exposition. After all, it's only human
nature to enjoy being right, and Watergate certainly
9eems to vindicate one's support for McGovern. I
would agree that one should be disgusted at the
motivation that led to Watergate; nevertheless, one
must still make the distinction as to whether, given
this problem and many others, McGovern was the
man to correct them.
At the expense of being ostracized by the

McGovem lacked a basic philosophical
