Publishing vs. Broadcasting
Editor:
Bill Evers disputes my criterion
for distinguishing publishing from
broadcasting (i.e. the airwaves,
unlike ink and newsprint, are a
limited natural resource belonging

to the public) because "in terms
of economic analysis, all such
resources are scarce." Obviously
Mr. Evers got in on the first day
of Econ 1. By the same strict
analysis, diamonds and pebbles
are both scarce natural resources.
Relatively speaking, broadcast

frequencies are scarce, thus
precious. Their value cannot be
measured in simple dollars; the
impact of broadcasting on our
opinions, expectations and
behavior is staggering.
Furthermore, Mr. Evers hasn't
grasped the second part of my
distinction — the airwaves belong
to the public. To my
astonishment, he writes: "Wheeler
points out that the airwaves are at
present government-owned.
True." I never asserted such a
gross inaccuracy. The government
regulates the use of the airwaves.
It does not own them. If Mr.
Evers had gotten in on the first
day of Broadcasting 142 he would
recognize the absurdity of his
statement. Since he starts from a
fallacious premise, no wonder his
conclusions are out in left field.
Ideally the FCC champions the
public interest against the
profit-minded broadcast industry.
The pitiful failure of the FCC —
co-opted by the industry it is
supposed to regulate and
pressured by an executive branch
that is dissatisfied with broadcast
journalism — is another sad story.
Mr. Evers informs us that four
years ago the Stanford Law
Review published an article
affirming "the present-day
feasibility of ending FCC control
of broadcasting." No doubt some
other dated and obscure journal
contains an article affirming the
feasibility of reversing the flow of
the Mississippi River too, but
given the gargantuan effort
required, no one is getting their
hopes up.
The rights that I maintain need
protection are those of the
individual — or collectively, the
public. After all, we own the
airwaves, we have a right to
expect quality programming. The
rights that are being
conspicuously paraded are those
of the broadcaster. With the
exception of a handful of
broadcast journalists dedicated to
improving television and radio,
most broadcasters are primarily
dedicated to the dollar sign.
Hopefully the government will
protect us against them.

Bike Ordinance Proposals
Editor:
Late this month or early in
November the Palo Alto City
Engineer will present a report to
the City Council recommending
several changes in the bike-lane
ordinance. One of the suggested
modifications will allow bikes
back into the street on
Middlefield and Embarcadero
Roads. While this is a welcome
and long-overdue change in the
terribly short-sighted ordinance,
other equally important issues,
such as the visibility of lane
markers, rights-of-way at
intersections and the practices of
the city's "bike patrol" police
squad may remain unresolved.
I strongly urge every interested
cyclist who has had occasion to
travel through Palo Alto to be at
the council session when the
report is presented. This may be
the only opportunity we will have
for some time to attempt to make
the ordinance more realistic and
hopefully, make cycling in Palo
Alto a great deal safer than it is
now.

I understand that a new
apartment complex of 100 units is
planned for faculty and staff.
Someone ought to warn the
intended residents to make sure
that neither the Business and
Finance Office nor the Planning
Office has anything to do with the
project. In the past few years
these two offices have produced:
a $1,000,000 cost overrun in
construction (out of $6,000,000),
unimaginative 483-square-foot
apartments which would cost
$210 per month if they weren't
heavily subsidized by other
students, a reserves policy which
screws present residents in order
to make a profit 20 years later,
grounds care and management
cost overruns of at least 20
percent... all just in Escondido
Village apartments. These same
people are responsible for tuition,
student housing, and food
services.
Beware.
