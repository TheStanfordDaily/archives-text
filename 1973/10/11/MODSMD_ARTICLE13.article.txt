# Luce Scholarship Program
## 
### 
The Center for Research in
International Studies at Stanford
is seeking applicants for a new
Luce Scholars Program that will
give a small group of young
Americans a year's experience in
Asia, working in the context of
widely-varied professional
interests.
Stanford is one of 30
participating universities
authorized to submit four
nominations to the sponsor, the
Henry Luce Foundation Inc.
Eligible are graduating seniors,
graduate and professional school
students, and recent graduates.
The program is unique in that
it will exclude Asian specialists or
international affairs experts in
favor of young men and women

whose leadership potential is in
fields unrelated to Asian
specialties.
The purpose is to provide a
greater number of Americans of
leadership potential with a
firsthand familiarity of Asia. The
program is designed for young
Americans who would not
otherwise expect to have such an
opportunity during the normal
course of their careers.
November 15 is the deadline
for submitting completed
applications. Interested persons
should contact Ronald Herring,
associate director, Center for
Research in International Studies
(Building 460, Room 465, ext.
3347).
