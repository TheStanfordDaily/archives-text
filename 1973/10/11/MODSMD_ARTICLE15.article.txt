## Officials: Disbelief 
### Associated Press 
The news of Spiro T. Agnew's resignation as vice president
brought expressions of shock and disbelief from Republican and
Democratic politicans around the country yesterday. Some praised
Agnew, saying he had placed the interests of the country above
personal concerns.
Gov. William Milliken of Michigan, a Republican, said Agnew's
resignation was "a tragic development for the country and certainly
for the vice president.
"It is now clearly in the best interest of the country to quickly
resolve the matter as the vice president is doing."
Gov. Marvin Mandel, a Democrat who was Agnew's successor as
governor of Maryland, said Agnew's decision to resign "must have
been a painful one, but a decision that took courage and
determination. He placed the stability of the nation, the integrity of
the vice presidency and the security of the nation ... above a political
future...
Thomas Potter, chairman of the West Virginia GOP, said his first
reaction was "one of great disappointment and surprise in view of the
statements Agnew made earlier proclaiming his innocence. . .
Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York, a Republican who has
been mentioned as a possible successor to Agnew, said the resignation
was "a great personal tragedy and a tragedy for the nation."
New York Mayor John V. Lindsay, now a Democrat but a former
Republican who seconded Agnew's nomination as vice president at
the 1968 GOP convention, said, "This is a sad story and a setback for
the entire United States."
