# Reagan: 'Saddened'

### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) - Gov.
Ronald Reagan said yesterday he
was "shocked and saddened" by
the resignation of Vice President
Spiro Agnew.
Reagan said he had no advance
notice of the resignation.
Reagan appeared shaken when
he met with newsmen moments
after a briefing on the resignation.
'Shocked and Saddened'
"I'm shocked and saddened,"
the Republican governor told
reporters who crowded into the
Capitol's press conference room.
"Agnew was, and is, a friend of
mine. I can only repeat that I am
shocked and saddened, just as I'm
sure most Americans are."
Reagan was observed wiping his
eyes just before he emerged from
an office adjoining the press
room.
No Comment
He has declined to comment in
the past on any event surrounding
an Agnew resignation.
He has been a staunch defender
of the vice president's throughout
his ordeal.
Today, asked if he thought
Agnew had done the right thing in
stepping down, Reagan said "I
would have preferred" that the
entire incident never ' had
occurred.
Into Hie Forefront?
Agnew's resignation and the
apparent end of his national
political career could catapult
Reagan into the forefront of the
1976 presidential contest, unless
Nixon should choose former
Texas Gov. John Connally to be
Agnew's successor.
The Republican governor was
videotaping a television program
in the news conference room with
a group of businessmen at the
time the announcement was
made.
He was not aware of it until
the taping was completed, at
about 12:05 p.m.
Wary Glances
But he cast wary glances from
time to time at the crowd of
reporters and Reagan aides who
had collected in the room while
the taping was in progress.
Assistants whisked him into
the adjoining room to tell Reagan
the news.
Reagan, his face now grave,
then emerged to talk with
reporters.
No Comment
Reagan's v/oice was subdued
and broken with emotion.
Asked if he would be available

for the nomination, Reagan said,
"I don't have any comment on
that at this particular time."
Reagan has been considered a
potential candidate for the White
House in 1976. His major
potential opponent in the public
opinion polls had been Agnew.
There were reports Reagan was
going to go to Washington, but he
said early Wednesday afternoon
he had no such plans.
The Agnew resignation
apparently caught Reagan and
other California political leaders
totally by surprise.
Visibly Shaken
Reagan was visibly shaken
when he emerged from a briefing
by his top aides and, at one point,
he could be seen rubbing his eyes.
The San Diego County GOP
chairman, Leslie Gehres, said
Reagan is his first choice to be the
new vice president. But Gehres
doubted that Reagan would take
the job.
Upstairs in- the Capitol, Lt.
Gov. Ed Reinecke, who would
succeed Reagan as California chief
executive should political lighting
strike, told a newsman, "I think it
is a tragedy." Reinecke echoed
the comment of several leading
California Republicans: that
Nixon should move quickly to
name a successor.
"The nation should not be
without a vice president any
longer than it is absolutely
necessary," said Reinecke, a
declared candidate for governor.
Republican State Chairman
Gordon C. Luce said, "I am
confident the President will
quickly appoint a successor, who,
like Vice President Agnew, can
ably assist him in coping with the
urgent issues that must be
resolved in the years ahead."
No Names
Former Cabinet officer Robert
H. Finch, who turned down the
vice presidential nomination in
1968 before Nixon chose Agnew,
declined to mention any names
publicly.
Former White House
communications director Herbert
G. Klein also refused to disclose
his recommendations.
Finch, considering a race for
governor, said the Agnew
successor should have these
qualifications: Someone who
wants to be President, someone
who can be confirmed by both
houses of Congress and "mostly
importantly, he has to be
qualified to serve as President."
