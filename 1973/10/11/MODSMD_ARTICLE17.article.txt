# Lyman To Appear On TV
## Higher Education Expanding 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO—Higher education will serve
more diverse student needs in the future, but basic
demand and public support for colleges remains
strong, according to University President Richard
Lyman and the presidents of the University of
California and Johns Hopkins.
Lyman, Charles Hitch, and Steven Muller outline
their views in a rare joint appearance on a 30-minute
tape recorded program, "Is Higher Education
Necessary?" scheduled for broadcast by KRON-TV
(Channel 4) at 3 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 27.
Muller conceded that universities do not have a
good track record of predicting job demand five
years or more in the future.
But he added, "I'm leery of the idea of a federal
or state policy of setting [manpower) goals,"
indicating these also could be erroneous and might
dampen individual choices.
Solid Education
"We've got to equip people" with a solid
education and "let them return" for more classes as
their interests and society's needs shift, the Johns
Hopkins leader added.
Hitch noted that UC now has 300,000 students
in continuing education programs. He conceded that
"we were slow" in offering serious degree programs
for this group.
Lyman said major private universities were "not
likely" to move as far or as fast as public universities
in this direction, but indicated resistance to this
change probably will diminish in the future.
All three agreed that post-secondary education
was "more necessary than ever," indicating this
need could best be met by a strong, diverse set of
institutions.
Lyman warned that attempts to standardize

education were "likely to be fatal." Hitch said UC
was "moving toward more specialization" at its nine
campuses. Muller looked for "far more
specialization" including post-secondary institutions
other than colleges and universities.
Questioned about the job prospects for college
graduates, Hitch noted a recent UC study showing
99 percent of those receiving PhD's between 1969
and 1971 were employed. He said 72 percpnt were
employed by academic institutions, with 17 percent
in government and industry.
Muller said Johns Hopkins graduates haven't
experienced difficulty getting jobs. Lyman said
finding work could be a challenge for liberal arts
undergraduates "who haven't begun to think of the
problem soon enough," especially since fewer
planned to attend graduate school than in the pst.
Demand Fluctuations
Despite short-term fluctuations in demand for
teachers, engineers, and doctors, Muller said society
will always need these skills. There will be
"inexactitudes" between what individuals want to
do, what academic institutions offer, and what jobs
are available, he admitted, but American colleges
have done "an adequate but not perfect" job of
responding to individual and social needs.
All three indicated public support for higher
education is on the upswing. Colleges "have never
paid more attention to good management" than
now, Lyman noted. The University has experienced
"good success" in its record-setting $300 million
fund-raising campaign.
In a similar vein Hitch noted that a bond issue
lor UC health sciences construction had been
"decisively beaten" three years ago, but passed
every county in California in 1972.

Road cutoff near the Medical Center. Quarry was diverted at this
point to make way for Medical Center expansion, and to improve
auto, pedestrian, and bicycle circulation between main campus and
Stanford Shopping Center, at a cost of $90,000. It was finished ahead
of schedule.
