# Nader Cautions: 'Radiation Risks'

SAN DIEGO (AP) - Ralph
Nader urges delaying a
$1.5-billion expansion of the San
Onofre Nuclear Power Plant near
the Western White House "while
radiation risks remain."
The consumer advocate spoke
at a news conference Tuesday.
The San Diego Coast Regional
Commission approved the
construction Sept. 7, but it must
be authorized by the U.S. Atomic
Energy Commission and the
California Coastal Zone
Conservation Commission.
A spokesman for San Diego
Gas & Electric Co., which jointly
owns the San Onofre plant with
Southern California Edison Co.,
said "Nader's comments have
been discredited by the nation's
foremost scientists.
Later Nader spoke to 1,000
doctors, dentists and lawyers,
urging them to forego fees
periodically for public service
work and study.
