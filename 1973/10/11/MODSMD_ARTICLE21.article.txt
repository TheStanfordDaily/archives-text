Today at noon a meeting in
memory of David Levine will
be held in Memorial Church.
David, a Stanford junior who
was majoring in physics, was
slain on the campus just prior
to the beginning of the
academic quarter.
The service will be
patterned after a Friends
Meeting. The Francesco Trio
will play selections from
Schubert, Haydn, Bach, and
Stravinski. All who wish to
participate are invited to do so.
Diane Kenney will officiate.
