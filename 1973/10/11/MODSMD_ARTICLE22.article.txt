## Homer's Features Fine Bluegrass Bands 
### 
Homer's Warehouse in Palo
Alto has recently hosted a varied
concert of country music, from
Asleep at the Wheel's western
swing to traditional bluegrass.
Saturday night, Homer's featured
two of the finest bluegrass bands
in the area, High Country and the
Phantoms of the Opry.
Publicity foulups centering
around a show earlier in the week
prevented the general
announcement of the show, so the
sparse audience consisted of
regulars and those who heard
about the show by word of
mouth. But the small house in no

way diminished either band's
performance.
High Country, a Marin-based
outfit, started the show. Fiddler
Ed Neff, one of the founders of
the band, took the spotlight first
with "Old Joe Clark," an old
Appalachian fiddle tune. Neff's
playing was always skillful and
tasteful,especially on"Uncle Pen"
and the perennial fiddler's finale,
"Orange Blossom Special."
Poker-Faced Band
The band proceeded,
poker-faced, through a number of
standard tunes. Most of the vocals
were by guitarist Chris Boutwell,

with mandolinist Butch Waller
singing the rest. Boutwell can
handle several singing styles, and
was especially good on "Sittin' On
Top of the World" and Merle
Haggard's "Workingman Blues."
Waller sang most of the band's
"on the road" songs, including
"Hello City Limits" and "Truck
Drivin' Man," a tune no country
band can leave Homer's without
playing. Boutwell and Neff sang
several well-polished three-part
choruses.
Larry Cohea's banjo picking is
another of the band's major
strengths. He is not a showoff,

just good and fast. When he took
off on "Cripple Creek," one
wondered if he would make it to
the end at the speed he was going.
He did.
Cohea closed the first,,set and
opened the third with a couple of
Earl Scruggs tunes, "Foggy
Mountain Breakdown" and
"Earl's Breakdown."
Bluegrass Haunts
Led by their stocky guitarist
and lead singer, Pat Enright, the
Phantoms of the Opry played the
second and fourth sets. This band
has singlehandedly increased the
reputation of West Coast bluegrass
by winning the band competition
at last summer's Bean blossom
(Ind.) festival, the premier
bluegrass gathering in the country.
Enright, who grew up in
Indiana and heard country music
all his life, has an ideal bluegrass
voice: strong, with a wide range,
and a pronounced down-home
sound.
Among the best examples of
his voice were Jimmie Rogers'
"Muleskinner Blues," his own
"You Know It," "Foggy River,"
and "T For Texas."
Save The Guitar
The last song contains lyrics
that any musician can understand
— "If my house catches fire and
there ain't no water around/
Throw my guitar out the window,
let that ol' house burn down."
There is much more to the
Phantoms than Enright, however.
Joe Zumwalt, "the Arizona
wildman," played some fine
mandolin, especially on "Theme
.ime." Robbie McDonald added
several good banjo solos, including
"Turkey Nob."
Enright's guitar, Zumwalt's
mandolin, and parts of
McDonald's banjo were hand-built
by Gryphon Stringed Instruments,
a Palo Alto shop catering to
bluegrass and old-time musicians
in the area.
Phantom fiddler Paul Shelasky
has a strong background in
bluegrass and fiddle tunes, but is
also known as the perpetrator of
"The Rutabaga Boogie." In this
song, Shelasky lists some curious

Jay Harlow

and inventive uses for this
much-maligned vegetable.
Musically, it falls somewhere
between bluegrass and "Jailhouse
Rock" and the Masked Marauders.
Gene Tortora, a down-home
boy from New York City, is the
newest member of the band on
dobro. His smooth slide work
never fails to be a crowd plearer.
The Phantoms' finale was an
instrumental called "Rawhide,"
with a string of nice solos on
mandolin, banjo, and fiddle.
A good criterion for judging a
band or a style of music is how
well it bears repetition. After
hearing most bluegrass tunes
umpteen times by several
different bands, one might expect
to get tired of them. Neither High
Country nor the Phantoms of the
Opry has bored this reviewer yet.
