# American Brass Quintet
## Horns Provide 'Tasty' Music 
### MICHAEL SAFFLE 
Two hours of brass music can be a bit hard to
take. But the American Brass Quintet offered a
tasty musical banquet at Dinkelspiel Auditorium
last Sunday afternoon, and the audience ate it up.
Consisting of two trumpeters, a French horn
player, and two trombonists, the American Brass
Quintet is a well-known chamber group based in
Manhattan. Since brass quintets are capable of
considerable volume and sonority, they often
overwhelm listeners with loud, impressive military
music, but frequently fail in sweeter, softer
passages.
Fancies
The American Quintet, however, demonstrated
that even a Flugelhom, one of several alternate
instruments the group used in their opening pair of
"Fancies" by Renaissance composer Giovanni
Coperario, can produce beautiful melodies. Rich,
omate pieces, the "Fancies" were originally written
for mixed ensembles of strings, brasses, and organ.
Smooth tone, excellent tuning, and the use of
Flugelhorns, piccolo trumpets, and improvised
ornamentation brought the Quintet's performances
to vivid life.
The concert's modem works included "Relais"
by contemporary French composer Gilbert Amy,
and a skillful, nicely executed "Divertimento" for
solo trumpet, horn, and trombone by New York
music-maker Alvin Brehm. Amy's radical score calls
for considerable virtuosity in handling six "folios"
(or movements) filled with difficulties and
improvisational passages.
Unconventional sounds — such as blowing into
the horns without making a musical tone, just a hiss

or burp — amused listeners, but the final "folio"
was too long, a bit dull despite a nice performance.
Finest Offering
Perhaps the afternoon's finest musical offering
was Victor Ewald's B-flat minor Quintet. A
little-known nineteenth-century composer, Ewald
wrote warm, gracious music reminiscent of
Rimsky-Korsakoff. The American Brass Quintet's
reading, featuring varied tempos and dynamics, was
as lovely and sensitive as any audience could wish.
Two additional potpourris — a suite of
Elizabethan dances by Anthony Holborne, and a
"Battle Suite" by Samuel Scheidt — received
brilliant, accurate performances. The
"Contrapunctus XII" from Bach's Art of Fugue,
however, seemingly baffled the players.
Light Touch
Bach's subtle, intellectual fugue needs a light
touch, clear phrasing, and careful ensemble
co-ordination. The Quintet played the piece with
little expression, and almost fell apart near the end
of the final section.
Intonation, always a problem for brass groups,
also plagued them. Omitting Gerard Schwarz's
arrangement of Bach's score from future programs
might be a good idea.
For an encore the Quintet sailed through the
"Intermezzo" from Ingolf Dahl's Quintet for Brass.
A Hollywood composer who wrote war-time movie
music, Dahl's pleasant score is partly based on
telephone numbers and other humorous trivia. The
"Intermezzo" brought a serious concert to a
lighthearted, enjoyable ending.
If your ears can take two hours of brass music,
catch the American Brass Quintet's next concert.
You might be pleasantly surprised.

little-known nineteenth-century composer, Ewald
wrote warm, gracious music reminiscent of
Rimsky-Korsakoff. The American Brass Quintet's
reading, featuring varied tempos and dynamics, was
as lovely and sensitive as any audience could wish.
Two additional potpourris — a suite of
Elizabethan dances by Anthony Holborne, and a
"Battle Suite" by Samuel Scheidt — received
brilliant, accurate performances. The
"Contrapunctus XII" from Bach's Art of Fugue,
however, seemingly baffled the players.
Light Touch
Bach's subtle, intellectual fugue needs a light
touch, clear phrasing, and careful ensemble
co-ordination. The Quintet played the piece with
little expression, and almost fell apart near the end
of the final section.
Intonation, always a problem for brass groups,
also plagued them. Omitting Gerard Schwarz's
arrangement of Bach's score from future programs
might be a good idea.
For an encore the Quintet sailed through the
"Intermezzo" from Ingolf Dahl's Quintet for Brass.
A Hollywood composer who wrote war-time movie
music, Dahl's pleasant score is partly based on
telephone numbers and other humorous trivia. The
"Intermezzo" brought a serious concert to a
lighthearted, enjoyable ending.
If your ears can take two hours of brass music,
catch the American Brass Quintet's next concert.
You might be pleasantly surprised.
Two hours of brass music can be a bit hard to
take. But the American Brass Quintet offered a
tasty musical banquet at Dinkelspiel Auditorium
last Sunday afternoon, and the audience ate it up.
Consisting of two trumpeters, a French horn
player, and two trombonists, the American Brass
Quintet is a well-known chamber group based in
Manhattan. Since brass quintets are capable of
considerable volume and sonority, they often
overwhelm listeners with loud, impressive military
music, but frequently fail in sweeter, softer
passages.
Fancies
The American Quintet, however, demonstrated
that even a Flugelhom, one of several alternate
instruments the group used in their opening pair of
"Fancies" by Renaissance composer Giovanni
Coperario, can produce beautiful melodies. Rich,
omate pieces, the "Fancies" were originally written
for mixed ensembles of strings, brasses, and organ.
Smooth tone, excellent tuning, and the use of
Flugelhorns, piccolo trumpets, and improvised
ornamentation brought the Quintet's performances
to vivid life.
The concert's modem works included "Relais"
by contemporary French composer Gilbert Amy,
and a skillful, nicely executed "Divertimento" for
solo trumpet, horn, and trombone by New York
music-maker Alvin Brehm. Amy's radical score calls
for considerable virtuosity in handling six "folios"
(or movements) filled with difficulties and
improvisational passages.
Unconventional sounds — such as blowing into
the horns without making a musical tone, just a hiss

or burp — amused listeners, but the final "folio"
was too long, a bit dull despite a nice performance.
Finest Offering
Perhaps the afternoon's finest musical offering
was Victor Ewald's B-flat minor Quintet. A
little-known nineteenth-century composer, Ewald
wrote warm, gracious music reminiscent of
Rimsky-Korsakoff. The American Brass Quintet's
reading, featuring varied tempos and dynamics, was
as lovely and sensitive as any audience could wish.
