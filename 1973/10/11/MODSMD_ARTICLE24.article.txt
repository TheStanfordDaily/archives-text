# Vulgar Comedy Cheapens 'El Grande De Coca Cola'
## 
### LAURA PULA 
SAN FRANCISCO—"Coca
Cola-a-a," she screeches, pursing
her voluptuous lips, "Coca
Cola-a-a." Seeing a buyer for her
wares, she undulates seductively
toward him with a melting "come
hither" stare. He takes the Coke
and flips a well-aimed quarter into
the cup tucked in her
cleavage... .
That, ladies and gentlemen, is
the portentous beginning of an
unpredictable and highly unusual
musical comedy, the Low Moan
Spectacular Production of El
Grande de Coca Cola.
At the cabaret-style
Montgomery Playhouse, 622
Broadway in San Francisco, this
piece has the appropriately
chintzy set, complete with fake
palm trees and a six-foot tall
plastic Coke bottle, to befit its
i background.
Senor Don Pepe Hernandez, a
third-rate Latin American version
of Ed Sullivan, has persuaded his
uncle, the manager of the local
Coca Cola bottling plant in
Trujillo, Honduras, to lend him
enough money to rent a sleazy
nightclub for one month.
Hernandez intends — or so he
, boasts — to bring an international

"Parade of Stars" to Trujillo.
Evidently, however, the
budding impresario 's plans do not
succeed; he brings us instead a
half-baked revue of relatives who
fervently, if amateurishly,
impersonate the absent celebrities,
and this is where El Grande de
Coca Cola begins.
There is a Spanish dancing duo
who mainly slap themselves and
each other, and Senor Blind Joe
Jackson who is deaf, cannot find
the audience or his guitar strings,
and eventually falls off the stage.
An unctuous team of Italian
gigolos, a cough-prompted seeress
who victimized an elderly man in
the front row, a female singing
trio whose repertoire consisted of
"la-la-la's," and a farce on
Toulouse-Lautrec's love life,
round out the cast of assembled
amateurs.
Fly-by-Night Humor
Each act was deliberately
contrived to spoof fly-by-night
productions by their mistakes and
embarrassing lack of talent and
originality. Unfortunately, several
of the situations were far from
humorous.
One of the more disgusting
examples concerned Blind Joe
Jackson defecating on the stage,
suggested by much exaggerated

nose holding and retching. At this
point, even those who had
guffawed throughout the show
were appalled.
Another low point was the
longwinded, vulgar piece on
Toulouse-Lautrec, performed in
pidgin French. One representative
example: A girl, after hearing the
small-statured artists' declaration
of love protests, "Mais vous etes
un midget!" He replies, "Oui,
mais j'ai (quelque chose)
enorme."
Vulgar Content
Two of the actors were the
originators of El Grande de Coca
Cola: Ron House as Pepe
Hernandez and Diz White as his
angular, squeaky step-daughter.
On the whole, the acting bubbled
with considerable vitality,
considering the content of work.
TTie star, of course, was a
determinedly smiling Ron House,
emcee-ing in fractured Spanglish
and adjudging everything to be
"absolumente fantastico."
Despite its long run in London,
New York, and now in San
Francisco, there is little in El
Grande de Coca Cola to justify its
popularity. Perhaps with some
judicious editing and some toning
down of the more vulgar scenes, it
could be improved. Until then,
however, the most fortunate
aspect of the show is that the
entire performance lasts for only
one hour.

Cola: Ron House as Pepe
Hernandez and Diz White as his
angular, squeaky step-daughter.
On the whole, the acting bubbled
with considerable vitality,
considering the content of work.
TTie star, of course, was a
determinedly smiling Ron House,
emcee-ing in fractured Spanglish
and adjudging everything to be
"absolumente fantastico."
Despite its long run in London,
New York, and now in San
Francisco, there is little in El
Grande de Coca Cola to justify its
popularity. Perhaps with some
judicious editing and some toning
down of the more vulgar scenes, it
could be improved. Until then,
however, the most fortunate
aspect of the show is that the
entire performance lasts for only
one hour.
SAN FRANCISCO—"Coca
Cola-a-a," she screeches, pursing
her voluptuous lips, "Coca
Cola-a-a." Seeing a buyer for her
wares, she undulates seductively
toward him with a melting "come
hither" stare. He takes the Coke
and flips a well-aimed quarter into
the cup tucked in her
cleavage... .
That, ladies and gentlemen, is
the portentous beginning of an
unpredictable and highly unusual
musical comedy, the Low Moan
Spectacular Production of El
Grande de Coca Cola.
At the cabaret-style
Montgomery Playhouse, 622
Broadway in San Francisco, this
piece has the appropriately
chintzy set, complete with fake
palm trees and a six-foot tall
plastic Coke bottle, to befit its
i background.
Senor Don Pepe Hernandez, a
third-rate Latin American version
of Ed Sullivan, has persuaded his
uncle, the manager of the local
Coca Cola bottling plant in
Trujillo, Honduras, to lend him
enough money to rent a sleazy
nightclub for one month.
Hernandez intends — or so he
, boasts — to bring an international

"Parade of Stars" to Trujillo.
Evidently, however, the
budding impresario 's plans do not
succeed; he brings us instead a
half-baked revue of relatives who
fervently, if amateurishly,
impersonate the absent celebrities,
and this is where El Grande de
Coca Cola begins.
There is a Spanish dancing duo
who mainly slap themselves and
each other, and Senor Blind Joe
Jackson who is deaf, cannot find
the audience or his guitar strings,
and eventually falls off the stage.
An unctuous team of Italian
gigolos, a cough-prompted seeress
who victimized an elderly man in
the front row, a female singing
trio whose repertoire consisted of
"la-la-la's," and a farce on
Toulouse-Lautrec's love life,
round out the cast of assembled
amateurs.
Fly-by-Night Humor
Each act was deliberately
contrived to spoof fly-by-night
productions by their mistakes and
embarrassing lack of talent and
originality. Unfortunately, several
of the situations were far from
humorous.
One of the more disgusting
examples concerned Blind Joe
Jackson defecating on the stage,
suggested by much exaggerated

nose holding and retching. At this
point, even those who had
guffawed throughout the show
were appalled.
Another low point was the
longwinded, vulgar piece on
Toulouse-Lautrec, performed in
pidgin French. One representative
example: A girl, after hearing the
small-statured artists' declaration
of love protests, "Mais vous etes
un midget!" He replies, "Oui,
mais j'ai (quelque chose)
enorme."
