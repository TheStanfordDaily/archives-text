# Comedian Klein Joins Vocalist
## Reddy Renders Professional Show 
### KEVIN SMITH 
SAN CARLOS - Helen Reddy
is a professional.
She has been singing
professionally for 26 of her 30
years and all that experience
certainly showed through during
her performance at the Circle Star
Hieater last Friday night. Popular
New York comedian Robert Klein
performed with Reddy.
The suit and skirt, cocktail
crowd which the Circle Star
inevitably attracts filled the
theater to capacity. This is
indicative of Reddy's current
popularity and explains why
promoters added a fourth show to
the three originally scheduled
weekend performances.
The Australian-born vocalist
dispalyed a good deal of natural
British charm during her
performance. Her stage style was
obviously well cultivated, yet did

not seem phony.
Starting with her hit
"Peaceful" — a predictable crowd
pleaser — Reddy moved through a
couple of other numbers before
doing a beautiful version of Leon
Russell's haunting "Masquerade."
Introducing her first big hit, "I
Don't Know How to Love Him,"
as one of her least favorite songs,
Reddy described it apologetically
as the kind of "garbage" she was
recording in 1971.
To the delight of the crowd,
she sang it anyway, and her
rendition of this much-recorded
song from Jesus Christ Superstar
is one of the best.
Reddy also writes music
herself. Unfortunately, not all of
it is as good as one terribly trite
selection entitled "I Am a Best
Friend to Myself." v
She made a valiant attempt to

get the slightly smashed,
overdressed crowd to sing along
with her on "Delta Dawn" — her
latest million-dollar — but the
effort was in vain.
Anticipated Homecoming
Expressing apprehension about
going back to Australia for the
first time in seven and one-half
years, Reddy quipped, "You get
back again and you discover why
you left."
One of the worst songs she
performed was a version of
Creedence Clearwater's old
stalwart, "Travelin' Band," which
definitely is not suited to the
voice of a solo female singer.
The show ended with the
inevitable "I Am Woman" which
won Reddy last year's Grammy
Award for Best Female Vocal
Performance. This song has
become the anthem of the
women's movement and has
transferred Reddy into the
heroine of countless women
around the world. In this light, it
was intriguing to hear Reddy
spout out statements during the
concert such as, "I just like to
putter around my kitchen" while
at home, which must be complete
anathema to many of her fans.
Women Lead Applause
Reddy performed well and the
audience gave her a standing
ovation — naturally led by the
women — but her show is open to
criticism in some respects.
Most important, her gyrations
on stage have got to go! She
seemed to feel that she somehow
needs to keep the audience
entertained during musical
interludes in the middle of her
songs by engaging in
ridiculous-looking antics.
Helen, in her flashy, bright
pink pants suit, appeared
ludicrous as she attempted
rhythmic, jazzy dance
movements. If it's true that
Bobby Riggs walks like a duck,
then he may have some new
competition in the "Reddy
Strut."
Reddy was also a bit too cute.
Her sweet, polished manner
sometimes became irritating.
Obnoxious Pitches
Finally she and her promoters
can be accused of an
overly-obnoxious hard sell. She
plugged her TV show, which ran
on NBC this past summer, and
made a not-so-subtle pitch to the
audience to put her back on the
air in February.
Despite these drawbacks,
however, Reddy's performance
was a success. Partial credit must
go to her competent band (or

"orchestra," as she called it)
which stayed out of her way, yet
made its sound noticeable just the
same. Special mention goes to
pianist Dick Horn who did a great
job on the song "Time."
Super-comedian Robert Klein
shared the bill with Reddy.
Although his routine was not
quite up to its usual high
standard, a below-par Robert
Klein is still better than 95
percent of the comedians around.
Klein, who has hosted the Dick
Cavett, Johnny Carson and David
Frost shows, performed an
entertaining set which touched on
every subject from commercials to
entertainers to New York City
where he grew up.
Klein lamented what he called
'the biggest problem in New York
City . .. dogshit." He claimed that
dogshit used to be welcome
because it was "good for the soil.
It's now 1973, and it is the soil."
"Everything's tough in New
York," Klein bragged. "The
pigeons sit in the middle of the
road waiting for you to hit 'em."
Desperate Tactics
Klein instructed the audience
on the entertainment world.

"Sometimes you can tell a real
insecure singer," he said. "You
can tell they're bombing if they
ask you to clap along.. . . You
know they're desperate if they ask
you to clap on 'You'll Never Walk
Alone.' "
Hre reminisced about his high
school band in New York City,
admitting, "We were terrible. ...
When we played the National
Anthem, people from every
country stood."
In a more serious vein, Klein
called Jimmy the Greek's five to
two odds against Billie Jean King
in her tennis match with Bobby
Riggs "the biggest evidence of the
[inferior woman] myth I've
seen." Much to the delight of the
audience, Klein declared,
"Howard Cosell obviously read a
tennis manual five minutes before
the match."
No comedian, however, can
adequately be represented in
newsprint, and Klein's vast
assortment of noises and motions
which cannot be described in
writing confirm his standing as
one of the very best American
comedians around — even on an
off night.

become the anthem of the
women's movement and has
transferred Reddy into the
heroine of countless women
around the world. In this light, it
was intriguing to hear Reddy
spout out statements during the
concert such as, "I just like to
putter around my kitchen" while
at home, which must be complete
anathema to many of her fans.
Women Lead Applause
Reddy performed well and the
audience gave her a standing
ovation — naturally led by the
women — but her show is open to
criticism in some respects.
Most important, her gyrations
on stage have got to go! She
seemed to feel that she somehow
needs to keep the audience
entertained during musical
interludes in the middle of her
songs by engaging in
ridiculous-looking antics.
Helen, in her flashy, bright
pink pants suit, appeared
ludicrous as she attempted
rhythmic, jazzy dance
movements. If it's true that
Bobby Riggs walks like a duck,
then he may have some new
competition in the "Reddy
Strut."
Reddy was also a bit too cute.
Her sweet, polished manner
sometimes became irritating.
Obnoxious Pitches
Finally she and her promoters
can be accused of an
overly-obnoxious hard sell. She
plugged her TV show, which ran
on NBC this past summer, and
made a not-so-subtle pitch to the
audience to put her back on the
air in February.
Despite these drawbacks,
however, Reddy's performance
was a success. Partial credit must
go to her competent band (or

"orchestra," as she called it)
which stayed out of her way, yet
made its sound noticeable just the
same. Special mention goes to
pianist Dick Horn who did a great
job on the song "Time."
Super-comedian Robert Klein
shared the bill with Reddy.
Although his routine was not
quite up to its usual high
standard, a below-par Robert
Klein is still better than 95
percent of the comedians around.
Klein, who has hosted the Dick
Cavett, Johnny Carson and David
Frost shows, performed an
entertaining set which touched on
every subject from commercials to
entertainers to New York City
where he grew up.
Klein lamented what he called
'the biggest problem in New York
City . .. dogshit." He claimed that
dogshit used to be welcome
because it was "good for the soil.
It's now 1973, and it is the soil."
"Everything's tough in New
York," Klein bragged. "The
pigeons sit in the middle of the
road waiting for you to hit 'em."
Desperate Tactics
Klein instructed the audience
on the entertainment world.

"Sometimes you can tell a real
insecure singer," he said. "You
can tell they're bombing if they
ask you to clap along.. . . You
know they're desperate if they ask
you to clap on 'You'll Never Walk
Alone.' "
Hre reminisced about his high
school band in New York City,
admitting, "We were terrible. ...
When we played the National
Anthem, people from every
country stood."
In a more serious vein, Klein
called Jimmy the Greek's five to
two odds against Billie Jean King
in her tennis match with Bobby
Riggs "the biggest evidence of the
[inferior woman] myth I've
seen." Much to the delight of the
audience, Klein declared,
"Howard Cosell obviously read a
tennis manual five minutes before
the match."
No comedian, however, can
adequately be represented in
newsprint, and Klein's vast
assortment of noises and motions
which cannot be described in
writing confirm his standing as
one of the very best American
comedians around — even on an
off night.
SAN CARLOS - Helen Reddy
is a professional.
She has been singing
professionally for 26 of her 30
years and all that experience
certainly showed through during
her performance at the Circle Star
Hieater last Friday night. Popular
New York comedian Robert Klein
performed with Reddy.
The suit and skirt, cocktail
crowd which the Circle Star
inevitably attracts filled the
theater to capacity. This is
indicative of Reddy's current
popularity and explains why
promoters added a fourth show to
the three originally scheduled
weekend performances.
The Australian-born vocalist
dispalyed a good deal of natural
British charm during her
performance. Her stage style was
obviously well cultivated, yet did

not seem phony.
Starting with her hit
"Peaceful" — a predictable crowd
pleaser — Reddy moved through a
couple of other numbers before
doing a beautiful version of Leon
Russell's haunting "Masquerade."
Introducing her first big hit, "I
Don't Know How to Love Him,"
as one of her least favorite songs,
Reddy described it apologetically
as the kind of "garbage" she was
recording in 1971.
To the delight of the crowd,
she sang it anyway, and her
rendition of this much-recorded
song from Jesus Christ Superstar
is one of the best.
Reddy also writes music
herself. Unfortunately, not all of
it is as good as one terribly trite
selection entitled "I Am a Best
Friend to Myself." v
She made a valiant attempt to

get the slightly smashed,
overdressed crowd to sing along
with her on "Delta Dawn" — her
latest million-dollar — but the
effort was in vain.
Anticipated Homecoming
Expressing apprehension about
going back to Australia for the
first time in seven and one-half
years, Reddy quipped, "You get
back again and you discover why
you left."
One of the worst songs she
performed was a version of
Creedence Clearwater's old
stalwart, "Travelin' Band," which
definitely is not suited to the
voice of a solo female singer.
The show ended with the
inevitable "I Am Woman" which
won Reddy last year's Grammy
Award for Best Female Vocal
Performance. This song has
become the anthem of the
women's movement and has
transferred Reddy into the
heroine of countless women
around the world. In this light, it

'the biggest problem in New York
City . .. dogshit." He claimed that
dogshit used to be welcome
because it was "good for the soil.
It's now 1973, and it is the soil."
"Everything's tough in New
York," Klein bragged. "The
pigeons sit in the middle of the
road waiting for you to hit 'em."
Desperate Tactics
Klein instructed the audience
on the entertainment world.

"Sometimes you can tell a real
insecure singer," he said. "You
can tell they're bombing if they
ask you to clap along.. . . You
know they're desperate if they ask
you to clap on 'You'll Never Walk
Alone.' "
Hre reminisced about his high
school band in New York City,
admitting, "We were terrible. ...
When we played the National
Anthem, people from every
country stood."
In a more serious vein, Klein
called Jimmy the Greek's five to
two odds against Billie Jean King
in her tennis match with Bobby
Riggs "the biggest evidence of the
[inferior woman] myth I've
seen." Much to the delight of the
audience, Klein declared,
"Howard Cosell obviously read a
tennis manual five minutes before
the match."
No comedian, however, can
adequately be represented in
newsprint, and Klein's vast
assortment of noises and motions
which cannot be described in
writing confirm his standing as
one of the very best American
comedians around — even on an
off night.
SAN CARLOS - Helen Reddy
is a professional.
She has been singing
professionally for 26 of her 30
years and all that experience
certainly showed through during
her performance at the Circle Star
Hieater last Friday night. Popular
New York comedian Robert Klein
performed with Reddy.
The suit and skirt, cocktail
crowd which the Circle Star
inevitably attracts filled the
theater to capacity. This is
indicative of Reddy's current
popularity and explains why
promoters added a fourth show to
the three originally scheduled
weekend performances.
The Australian-born vocalist
dispalyed a good deal of natural
British charm during her
performance. Her stage style was
obviously well cultivated, yet did

not seem phony.
Starting with her hit
"Peaceful" — a predictable crowd
pleaser — Reddy moved through a
couple of other numbers before
doing a beautiful version of Leon
Russell's haunting "Masquerade."
Introducing her first big hit, "I
Don't Know How to Love Him,"
as one of her least favorite songs,
Reddy described it apologetically
as the kind of "garbage" she was
recording in 1971.
To the delight of the crowd,
she sang it anyway, and her
rendition of this much-recorded
song from Jesus Christ Superstar
is one of the best.
Reddy also writes music
herself. Unfortunately, not all of
it is as good as one terribly trite
selection entitled "I Am a Best
Friend to Myself." v
She made a valiant attempt to

get the slightly smashed,
overdressed crowd to sing along
with her on "Delta Dawn" — her
latest million-dollar — but the
effort was in vain.
Anticipated Homecoming
Expressing apprehension about
going back to Australia for the
first time in seven and one-half
years, Reddy quipped, "You get
back again and you discover why
you left."
One of the worst songs she
performed was a version of
Creedence Clearwater's old
stalwart, "Travelin' Band," which
definitely is not suited to the
voice of a solo female singer.
The show ended with the
inevitable "I Am Woman" which
won Reddy last year's Grammy
Award for Best Female Vocal
Performance. This song has
become the anthem of the
women's movement and has
transferred Reddy into the
heroine of countless women
around the world. In this light, it
was intriguing to hear Reddy
spout out statements during the
concert such as, "I just like to
putter around my kitchen" while
at home, which must be complete
anathema to many of her fans.
Women Lead Applause
Reddy performed well and the
audience gave her a standing
ovation — naturally led by the
women — but her show is open to
criticism in some respects.
Most important, her gyrations
on stage have got to go! She
seemed to feel that she somehow
needs to keep the audience
entertained during musical
interludes in the middle of her
songs by engaging in
ridiculous-looking antics.
Helen, in her flashy, bright
pink pants suit, appeared
ludicrous as she attempted
rhythmic, jazzy dance
movements. If it's true that
Bobby Riggs walks like a duck,
then he may have some new
competition in the "Reddy
Strut."
Reddy was also a bit too cute.
Her sweet, polished manner
sometimes became irritating.
Obnoxious Pitches
Finally she and her promoters
can be accused of an
overly-obnoxious hard sell. She
plugged her TV show, which ran
on NBC this past summer, and
made a not-so-subtle pitch to the
audience to put her back on the
air in February.
Despite these drawbacks,
however, Reddy's performance
was a success. Partial credit must
go to her competent band (or

"orchestra," as she called it)
which stayed out of her way, yet
made its sound noticeable just the
same. Special mention goes to
pianist Dick Horn who did a great
job on the song "Time."
Super-comedian Robert Klein
shared the bill with Reddy.
Although his routine was not
quite up to its usual high
standard, a below-par Robert
Klein is still better than 95
percent of the comedians around.
Klein, who has hosted the Dick
Cavett, Johnny Carson and David
Frost shows, performed an
entertaining set which touched on
every subject from commercials to
entertainers to New York City
where he grew up.
Klein lamented what he called
'the biggest problem in New York
City . .. dogshit." He claimed that
dogshit used to be welcome
because it was "good for the soil.
It's now 1973, and it is the soil."
