Israel Airlifts U.S. Arms
VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. - At least two Israeli planes
have picked up bombs and missiles at Oceana Naval Air
Station since Sunday, according to eyewitnesses
interviewed by the Norfolk Pilot.
One of the aircraft, a blue and white Boeing 707 with
its tail markings obliterated, was photographed as it left
the air station about 1:20 p.m. yesterday, the paper said.
It said sources saw Israeli markings on the aft tail end. The
markings were covered with paper and paint before the
plane departed, the newspaper said.
The Riot story reported that:
Witnesses said the plane was at least partly loaded with
Sparrow and Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. These weapons
are commonly used on F4 Phantom II jet fighters, which
the United States in the past has supplied to Israel in large
numbers.
There also were reports that a C-141 of the U
Military Airlift Command landed at Oceana yesterday and
parked near the Israeli 707. Sources said 250-pound
bombs were taken from the U.S. plane by forklift and
transferred to the 707.
The C-141 left Oceana minutes after the 707.
Earlier reports indicated that an Israeli 707 landed
bombs at Oceana as early as 2:30 a.m. Sunday. That plane
apparently slipped in and out of Virginia under the cover
of darkness.
Navy spokesmen both here and in Washington refused
to comment on the reports.
'Sedan Chair 2' Testifies
WASHINGTON — A paid spy for the Nixon campaign
yesterday defended the political espionage work that took
him inside three Democratic campaigns and into friendly
contact with Sen. George McGovern, D-S.D.
"To me there's a difference between breaking law and
breaking someone's confidence," Michael W. McMinoway
told the Senate Watergate committee. "I believe it's
impossible to run a successful campaign without knowing
what the other side is doing."
McMinoway, a 27-year-old private detective from
Louisville, Ky., said his success as a spy culminated when
he was appointed to McGovern's security staff at the
Democratic National Convention.
McMinoway said he chatted with McGovern several
times and that the candidate once invited him into his
room to watch on television a key convention vote.
McMinoway testified under oath he was told that the
persons hiring him and receiving his reports were
unidentified "concerned citizens." He said they paid him
$5,808.10.
Previous testimony has established that McMinoway's
reports were received by officials of the Committee for
the Re-election of the President and that he was referred
to by the code name Sedan Chair 2.

McMinoway said he was successful also in getting
information from the primary campaigns of Sens.
Edmund S. Muskie, D-Maine, and Hubert Humphrey,
D-Minn., because he made sure he was the best volunteer
worker they ever had.
GOP Budget Recovering
WASHINGTON — With its big money contributors
scared off by the Watergate scandals, the Republican
party says it now is recovering from financial crisis with
an army of small donors.
Little more than a month ago party officials were
lamenting publicly that the two-party system was in
danger because the sources of Republican operating funds
were drying up.
Now, GOP National Chairman George Bush says a
direct mail campaign has overcome the setback and the
party will end 1972 in the black and still outspend the
Democrats three to one.
What's more, Bush says, most of the money by far is
coming from the rank and file. So far this year 85 percent
of the contributors have given less than $100 each with an
average gift of $22.35.
Mets Take NL Pennant
NEW YORK — Yogi Berra stood under a delightful
champagne shower, enjoying every drop. For a manager
who supposedly was being fired in July, he'd come an
awfully long way.
"Let me savor this victory," he said, wiping the bubbly
from his eyes after New York's Cinderella Mets had won
the National League championship with a 7-2 victory over
the Cincinnati Reds in the fifth and deciding game of the
championship playoffs.
"You gotta believe!" shouted Tom Seaver, repeating
the catch-phrase the Mets rode all the way to the top. "We
made it and I believe!"
Seaver pitched yesterday's clincher and beat the Reds
with ninth-inning help from ace reliever Tug McGraw after
the Mets had put together a wild four-run rally to snap a
tie in the fifth inning.
Orioles Win, 5-4
OAKLAND — The Baltimore Orioles, after tailing
Oakland 4-0 and appearing helpless against the pitching of
Vida Blue, beat the A's 5-4 yesterday on late home runs
by Andy Etchebarren and Bobby Grich to send the
American League playoffs to the fifth game.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow but with patchy early morning
fog and some high cloudiness this morning. Low tonight
in the 40s to low 50s. Highs today and tomorrow in mid
60s to mid 70s. West to northwest wind 5 to 15 mph
locally to 20 mph in afternoons.

WASHINGTON — A paid spy for the Nixon campaign
yesterday defended the political espionage work that took
him inside three Democratic campaigns and into friendly
contact with Sen. George McGovern, D-S.D.
"To me there's a difference between breaking law and
breaking someone's confidence," Michael W. McMinoway
told the Senate Watergate committee. "I believe it's
impossible to run a successful campaign without knowing
what the other side is doing."
McMinoway, a 27-year-old private detective from
Louisville, Ky., said his success as a spy culminated when
he was appointed to McGovern's security staff at the
Democratic National Convention.
McMinoway said he chatted with McGovern several
times and that the candidate once invited him into his
room to watch on television a key convention vote.
McMinoway testified under oath he was told that the
persons hiring him and receiving his reports were
unidentified "concerned citizens." He said they paid him
$5,808.10.
Previous testimony has established that McMinoway's
reports were received by officials of the Committee for
the Re-election of the President and that he was referred
to by the code name Sedan Chair 2.

McMinoway said he was successful also in getting
information from the primary campaigns of Sens.
Edmund S. Muskie, D-Maine, and Hubert Humphrey,
D-Minn., because he made sure he was the best volunteer
worker they ever had.
GOP Budget Recovering
WASHINGTON — With its big money contributors
scared off by the Watergate scandals, the Republican
party says it now is recovering from financial crisis with
an army of small donors.
Little more than a month ago party officials were
lamenting publicly that the two-party system was in
danger because the sources of Republican operating funds
were drying up.
Now, GOP National Chairman George Bush says a
direct mail campaign has overcome the setback and the
party will end 1972 in the black and still outspend the
Democrats three to one.
What's more, Bush says, most of the money by far is
coming from the rank and file. So far this year 85 percent
of the contributors have given less than $100 each with an
average gift of $22.35.
Mets Take NL Pennant
NEW YORK — Yogi Berra stood under a delightful
champagne shower, enjoying every drop. For a manager
who supposedly was being fired in July, he'd come an
awfully long way.
"Let me savor this victory," he said, wiping the bubbly
from his eyes after New York's Cinderella Mets had won
the National League championship with a 7-2 victory over
the Cincinnati Reds in the fifth and deciding game of the
championship playoffs.
"You gotta believe!" shouted Tom Seaver, repeating
the catch-phrase the Mets rode all the way to the top. "We
made it and I believe!"
Seaver pitched yesterday's clincher and beat the Reds
with ninth-inning help from ace reliever Tug McGraw after
the Mets had put together a wild four-run rally to snap a
tie in the fifth inning.
Orioles Win, 5-4
OAKLAND — The Baltimore Orioles, after tailing
Oakland 4-0 and appearing helpless against the pitching of
Vida Blue, beat the A's 5-4 yesterday on late home runs
by Andy Etchebarren and Bobby Grich to send the
American League playoffs to the fifth game.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow but with patchy early morning
fog and some high cloudiness this morning. Low tonight
in the 40s to low 50s. Highs today and tomorrow in mid
60s to mid 70s. West to northwest wind 5 to 15 mph
locally to 20 mph in afternoons.
Israel Airlifts U.S. Arms
VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. - At least two Israeli planes
have picked up bombs and missiles at Oceana Naval Air
Station since Sunday, according to eyewitnesses
interviewed by the Norfolk Pilot.
One of the aircraft, a blue and white Boeing 707 with
its tail markings obliterated, was photographed as it left
the air station about 1:20 p.m. yesterday, the paper said.
It said sources saw Israeli markings on the aft tail end. The
markings were covered with paper and paint before the
plane departed, the newspaper said.
The Riot story reported that:
Witnesses said the plane was at least partly loaded with
Sparrow and Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. These weapons
are commonly used on F4 Phantom II jet fighters, which
the United States in the past has supplied to Israel in large
numbers.
There also were reports that a C-141 of the U
Military Airlift Command landed at Oceana yesterday and
parked near the Israeli 707. Sources said 250-pound
bombs were taken from the U.S. plane by forklift and
transferred to the 707.
The C-141 left Oceana minutes after the 707.
Earlier reports indicated that an Israeli 707 landed
bombs at Oceana as early as 2:30 a.m. Sunday. That plane
apparently slipped in and out of Virginia under the cover
of darkness.
Navy spokesmen both here and in Washington refused
to comment on the reports.

party says it now is recovering from financial crisis with
an army of small donors.
Little more than a month ago party officials were
lamenting publicly that the two-party system was in
danger because the sources of Republican operating funds
were drying up.
Now, GOP National Chairman George Bush says a
direct mail campaign has overcome the setback and the
party will end 1972 in the black and still outspend the
Democrats three to one.
What's more, Bush says, most of the money by far is
coming from the rank and file. So far this year 85 percent
of the contributors have given less than $100 each with an
average gift of $22.35.
Mets Take NL Pennant
NEW YORK — Yogi Berra stood under a delightful
champagne shower, enjoying every drop. For a manager
who supposedly was being fired in July, he'd come an
awfully long way.
"Let me savor this victory," he said, wiping the bubbly
from his eyes after New York's Cinderella Mets had won
the National League championship with a 7-2 victory over
the Cincinnati Reds in the fifth and deciding game of the
championship playoffs.
"You gotta believe!" shouted Tom Seaver, repeating
the catch-phrase the Mets rode all the way to the top. "We
made it and I believe!"
Seaver pitched yesterday's clincher and beat the Reds
with ninth-inning help from ace reliever Tug McGraw after
the Mets had put together a wild four-run rally to snap a
tie in the fifth inning.
Orioles Win, 5-4
OAKLAND — The Baltimore Orioles, after tailing
Oakland 4-0 and appearing helpless against the pitching of
Vida Blue, beat the A's 5-4 yesterday on late home runs
by Andy Etchebarren and Bobby Grich to send the
American League playoffs to the fifth game.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow but with patchy early morning
fog and some high cloudiness this morning. Low tonight
in the 40s to low 50s. Highs today and tomorrow in mid
60s to mid 70s. West to northwest wind 5 to 15 mph
locally to 20 mph in afternoons.
Israel Airlifts U.S. Arms
VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. - At least two Israeli planes
have picked up bombs and missiles at Oceana Naval Air
Station since Sunday, according to eyewitnesses
interviewed by the Norfolk Pilot.
One of the aircraft, a blue and white Boeing 707 with
its tail markings obliterated, was photographed as it left
the air station about 1:20 p.m. yesterday, the paper said.
It said sources saw Israeli markings on the aft tail end. The
markings were covered with paper and paint before the
plane departed, the newspaper said.
The Riot story reported that:
Witnesses said the plane was at least partly loaded with
Sparrow and Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. These weapons
are commonly used on F4 Phantom II jet fighters, which
the United States in the past has supplied to Israel in large
numbers.
There also were reports that a C-141 of the U
Military Airlift Command landed at Oceana yesterday and
parked near the Israeli 707. Sources said 250-pound
bombs were taken from the U.S. plane by forklift and
transferred to the 707.
The C-141 left Oceana minutes after the 707.
Earlier reports indicated that an Israeli 707 landed
bombs at Oceana as early as 2:30 a.m. Sunday. That plane
apparently slipped in and out of Virginia under the cover
of darkness.
Navy spokesmen both here and in Washington refused
to comment on the reports.
'Sedan Chair 2' Testifies
WASHINGTON — A paid spy for the Nixon campaign
yesterday defended the political espionage work that took
him inside three Democratic campaigns and into friendly
contact with Sen. George McGovern, D-S.D.
"To me there's a difference between breaking law and
breaking someone's confidence," Michael W. McMinoway
told the Senate Watergate committee. "I believe it's
impossible to run a successful campaign without knowing
what the other side is doing."
McMinoway, a 27-year-old private detective from
Louisville, Ky., said his success as a spy culminated when
he was appointed to McGovern's security staff at the
Democratic National Convention.
McMinoway said he chatted with McGovern several
times and that the candidate once invited him into his
room to watch on television a key convention vote.
McMinoway testified under oath he was told that the
persons hiring him and receiving his reports were
unidentified "concerned citizens." He said they paid him
$5,808.10.
Previous testimony has established that McMinoway's
reports were received by officials of the Committee for
the Re-election of the President and that he was referred
to by the code name Sedan Chair 2.

McMinoway said he was successful also in getting
information from the primary campaigns of Sens.
Edmund S. Muskie, D-Maine, and Hubert Humphrey,
D-Minn., because he made sure he was the best volunteer
worker they ever had.
