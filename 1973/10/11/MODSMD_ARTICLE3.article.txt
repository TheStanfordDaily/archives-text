# Suicide Problem: Not All Grades
## 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
A student studying on the fourth
floor of Meyer Undergraduate Library
walks out onto the roof terrace. In the
darkness he climbs over the small
fence separating the terrace from the
red tile roof. Once on the other side of
the fence, he reconsiders and climbs
back to return to his studies.
Although there are no statistics
reporting how many students
contemplate suicide, one or two
students here actually kill themselves
during a typical year. According to Dr.
David Dorosin, director of Cowell
Student Health Center's Department *
of Counseling and Psychological
Services, the reasons behind student
suicides are seldom well defined.
"It's an occupation hazard of
growing up. not necessarily of
students. I don't think anyone kills
themself [sic] because they get a B in
a course, or because they didn't get
into med school." Dorosin believes
that while academic problems may be
a factor in student suicides, emotional
problems probably offer a stronger
motivation.
Dr. James Paulsen, also of Cowell,
explains that "suicide is an
emotional-behavioral matter, not an
intellectual matter. My opinion is that
young people today are too smart to
do it for intellectual reasons."

Nationally, approximately 250
college students commit suicide each
year. The suicide rate among the
young is reported by some authorities
to be nearly twice that of the
population in general. However, both
Dorosin and Paulsen believe that the
campus suicide rate is probably lower
than the national youth average.
Paulsen cites 17 or 18 suicides
during his 13 years with the health
service, and believes the rate has
decreased. He feels a "liberalization of
attitudes toward despair," may
account for this decrease.
For people who Dorosin describes
as "silent sufferers," a suicide attempt
— rather than an actual suicide —
offers a form of communication.
Paulsen describes such actions as
"attempts to stir up the environment,
get a reaction."
Typical Attempts
Typical among attempts are
situations where a student takes "20
aspirin or 10 benadryls" after what
Paulsen cites as the most common
cause of attempts — romantic
breakups.
Mentally depressed students are
counseled through the health center.
The 12 counselors there handled
approximately 1100 cases last year.
In addition, the Bridge, a student
run drop-in center, provides

student-to-student counseling in
various crisis situations. The Bridge
switchboard is manned 24 hours a day,
but few suicide calls come in and most
of those received are from
non-students.
According to Dr. Vincent D'Andrea,
Cowell psychiatrist and liaison to the
Bridge, "a lot of people may be
desperately suicidal but just not
mention it."
Bridge counselors mainly try to "get
suicides to calm down and think about
other alternatives." D'Andrea thinks
many potential suicides may choose to
discuss their problems with resident
associates, advisers or other students.
Counseling
Perhaps four of the 17 or 18
suicides which Paulsen recalls had
some form of professional counseling.
One student, according to Paulsen,
"had seen everyone," yet still
committed suicide. Although there is
no way to predict suicides or to
distinguish those who will attempt
from those who will succeed, Paulsen
thinks that "the person seriously
intent |on it) does L "
Paulsen regards suicide as a
fundamental "right," particularly for
"someone, often middle aged or over,
whose life is constant agony and
despair," or the terminally ill.
"Some people just aren't happy
living," he explains. "Society would
like to think things can work out.
Suicide is not acceptable to the
American middle class."
Paulsen calls the proposed Golden
Gate Bridge suicide barrier "an
understandable overreaction," and
wonders if some suicides may choose a
traffic accident as an alternative, thus

endangering innocent motorists.
Dorosin says, "If somebody wants
to kill himself, I as a psychiatrist and
as a human being can't stop him." Yet
Dorosin sees youth suicide as
"particularly tragic, the making of
irreversible decisions at a time when
things are certainly reversible." He
expresses the hope that "anyone
seriously thinking about suicide would
at least come in and talk to someone."
