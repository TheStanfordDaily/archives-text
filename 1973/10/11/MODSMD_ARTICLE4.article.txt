# Iraq Enters War
## Israeli Commandos Cross Suez Canal 
### Associated Press 
Israeli commandos crossed the Suez
Canal early this morning for the first
time in the new Middle East war and
made a hit-and-run attack on Egyptian
convoys, the Israeli command said at
dawn.
The Israelis said the commandos
returned safely across the
200-foot-wide canal after attacking
"convoys and rear echelons of the
enemy" in the canal's southern sector.
Earlier in the night, Israel had reported
"very little activity on both the Suez
front and the Golan Heights."
Israel said its gunboats shelled
Syrian oil installations during the night
at Latakia, Banias and Tartous on the
Mediterranean coast more than 300
miles from the Egyptian canal front. A
communique said "large flames could
be seen."
The Israelis claimed they sank two
Syrian missile boats; the Syrians
claimed they sank "three enemy
boats" and said a Greek ship, the
Murghot, also was sunk during the

attack.
Israel claimed yesterday that it
recaptured the Golan Heights from
Syria and its forces were pushing back
the Egyptian army along the Suez
Canal.
Iraq Enters
Iraq announced that its air and
ground forces have joined the war and
Jordan called up its reserves in what
could herald another escalation of the
five-day-old struggle.
Israeli Premier Golda Meir, who
announced that Israel had retaken the
heights, also said the Soviet Union was
pouring in new arms to fuel the Arab
onslaught.
Meanwhile, Israeli jets carried the
war. into Egypt and Syria for the
second consecutive day.
At the United Nations, Syrian
Deputy Foreign Minister Mohamed
Zakaria Ismail threatened air
retaliation against Israeli cities unless
the United Nations forces Israeli
planes to stop hitting civilian areas in
Syria. Ismail spoke to newsmen.
While the Security Council did not
convene yesterday, seventy nonaligned
nations at the United Nations pledged
support for the Arabs.
Jordan Uncommitted
Jordan fought with Syria and Egypt
against Israel in the 1967 war, but so
far has not committed forces to the
current fighting.
President Nixon said the United
States was "trying its best" to mediate
the "very dangerous situation" in the
Middle East.
A Pentagon spokesman declined

comment when asked about U.S. aid
to Israel, but there was no indication
that the United States was cutting
back its arms sales to Tel Aviv.
Syria and Egypt countered the
Israeli claims of victory in skies, and
reported shooting down 24 Israeli
warplanes. Israel claimed it shot down
20 Syrian and Egyptian fighter planes.
Neither side gave its own losses.
Lsraeli Claims
Israel had claimed once before that
its forces had pushed the Egyptians
back to the canal and had cleared the
Golan Heights of Syrian forces, but on
Tuesday an Israeli general said this was
not so.
Tel Aviv and Damascus reported
savage air clashes over the Golan
Heights battleground and during the
Israeli raids on targets in the Syrian

heartland. Each side claimed the other
suffered heavy losses.
President Nixon met with
congressional leaders in Washington
and won their support for his efforts
to halt the war. Nixon's peacemaking
proposal to the U.N. Security Council
remained stalled, however, over
conditions for a possible ceasefire.
Senate Majority Leader Mike
Mansfield of Montana said after thp
White House session that the question
of U.S. arms for Israel is "always
under advisement" but that it did not
arise in his talk with Nixon.
Soviet Arms
U.S. officials said the Soviet Union
was delivering "very large tonnages" of
military equipment to resupply Egypt
and Syria. They declined to say what

amounts were involved.
Other sources said big Russian
AN22 transports, which can carry
more than 50 tons, and other military
cargo planes from Russia had flown
"scores of sorties across the
Mediterranean" in the past two days.
The AN22 is capable of carrying
vehicles as big as surface-to-air missiles
which reportedly have been a major
target of Israeli air strikes in the Golan
Heights of Syrian and along the Suez
Canal.
Meanwhile, Nixon administration
authorities were reported debating
possible increased U.S. arms to Israel
to replace heavy combat losses in the
new Middle East fighting.
Emergency Aid
There were signs the Israelis were
urging such emergency aid, at least a
speed up in shipment of fighter planes
under present contracts.
However, Pentagon sources said two
net F4 phantom jets which were due

to leave for Israel this week under
existing agreements were not sent.
Some U.S. supplies may already be
on the way. Witnesses reported that a
Boeing 707 transport-type plane
bearing Israeli markings loaded bombs
and air-to-air sidewinder and sparrow
missiles at the Oceana Naval Air
Station near Norfolk, Va.
The Iraqi announcement that its air
and land forces were fighting on both
fronts made it the third major Arab
country to enter the fight against the
Israelis in the fourth broad Arab-Israeli
conflict since 1948.
Arab Unity
Other Arab countries have pledged
support to Egypt and Syria and some
have sent token contingents.
The Beirut newspaper An Nahar
reported Iraq has committed 18,000
troops and 100 tanks along with an
undisclosed amount of air power to
back Syria on the Golan front and
Egypt in the Sinai battle.
The Israeli military command
claimed its raiding jets inflicted

"considerable damage" on the
French-built Damascus airport and
also blasted Syrian naval headquarters
on the Mediterranean and other
strategic targets in Syria and Egypt.
Air War
But Syria claimed its air defenses
rose to meet the four jets attacking
over Damascus and blasted three of
them out of the sky before they could
get near the airport. The fourth Israeli
jet fled with Syrian MIGs in hot
pursuit and was downed before it
could reach safety in Israeli skies,
Damascus said.
The Israeli command said that jets
hit Egyptian air bases at Khusna and
Abu Hammad on an arc in the Nile
Delta only 27 miles from Cairo in
addition to a radar station on Egypt's
Mediterranean coast about 60 miles
east of Alexandria.
Foreign correspondents were barred
from both fronts and unable to make
independent checks on the conflicting
claims.

jet fled with Syrian MIGs in hot
pursuit and was downed before it
could reach safety in Israeli skies,
Damascus said.
The Israeli command said that jets
hit Egyptian air bases at Khusna and
Abu Hammad on an arc in the Nile
Delta only 27 miles from Cairo in
addition to a radar station on Egypt's
Mediterranean coast about 60 miles
east of Alexandria.
Foreign correspondents were barred
from both fronts and unable to make
independent checks on the conflicting
claims.
Israeli commandos crossed the Suez
Canal early this morning for the first
time in the new Middle East war and
made a hit-and-run attack on Egyptian
convoys, the Israeli command said at
dawn.
The Israelis said the commandos
returned safely across the
200-foot-wide canal after attacking
"convoys and rear echelons of the
enemy" in the canal's southern sector.
Earlier in the night, Israel had reported
"very little activity on both the Suez
front and the Golan Heights."
Israel said its gunboats shelled
Syrian oil installations during the night
at Latakia, Banias and Tartous on the
Mediterranean coast more than 300
miles from the Egyptian canal front. A
communique said "large flames could
be seen."
The Israelis claimed they sank two
Syrian missile boats; the Syrians
claimed they sank "three enemy
boats" and said a Greek ship, the
Murghot, also was sunk during the

attack.
Israel claimed yesterday that it
recaptured the Golan Heights from
Syria and its forces were pushing back
the Egyptian army along the Suez
Canal.
Iraq Enters
Iraq announced that its air and
ground forces have joined the war and
Jordan called up its reserves in what
could herald another escalation of the
five-day-old struggle.
Israeli Premier Golda Meir, who
announced that Israel had retaken the
heights, also said the Soviet Union was
pouring in new arms to fuel the Arab
onslaught.
Meanwhile, Israeli jets carried the
war. into Egypt and Syria for the
second consecutive day.
At the United Nations, Syrian
Deputy Foreign Minister Mohamed
Zakaria Ismail threatened air
retaliation against Israeli cities unless
the United Nations forces Israeli
planes to stop hitting civilian areas in
Syria. Ismail spoke to newsmen.
While the Security Council did not
convene yesterday, seventy nonaligned
nations at the United Nations pledged
support for the Arabs.
Jordan Uncommitted
Jordan fought with Syria and Egypt
against Israel in the 1967 war, but so
far has not committed forces to the
current fighting.
President Nixon said the United
States was "trying its best" to mediate
the "very dangerous situation" in the
Middle East.
A Pentagon spokesman declined

comment when asked about U.S. aid
to Israel, but there was no indication
that the United States was cutting
back its arms sales to Tel Aviv.
Syria and Egypt countered the
Israeli claims of victory in skies, and
reported shooting down 24 Israeli
warplanes. Israel claimed it shot down
20 Syrian and Egyptian fighter planes.
Neither side gave its own losses.
Lsraeli Claims
Israel had claimed once before that
its forces had pushed the Egyptians
back to the canal and had cleared the
Golan Heights of Syrian forces, but on
Tuesday an Israeli general said this was
not so.
Tel Aviv and Damascus reported
savage air clashes over the Golan
Heights battleground and during the
Israeli raids on targets in the Syrian

heartland. Each side claimed the other
suffered heavy losses.
President Nixon met with
congressional leaders in Washington
and won their support for his efforts
to halt the war. Nixon's peacemaking
proposal to the U.N. Security Council
remained stalled, however, over
conditions for a possible ceasefire.
Senate Majority Leader Mike
Mansfield of Montana said after thp
White House session that the question
of U.S. arms for Israel is "always
under advisement" but that it did not
arise in his talk with Nixon.
Soviet Arms
U.S. officials said the Soviet Union
was delivering "very large tonnages" of
military equipment to resupply Egypt

Other sources said big Russian
AN22 transports, which can carry
more than 50 tons, and other military
cargo planes from Russia had flown
"scores of sorties across the
Mediterranean" in the past two days.
The AN22 is capable of carrying
vehicles as big as surface-to-air missiles
which reportedly have been a major
target of Israeli air strikes in the Golan
Heights of Syrian and along the Suez
Canal.
Meanwhile, Nixon administration
authorities were reported debating
possible increased U.S. arms to Israel
to replace heavy combat losses in the
new Middle East fighting.
Emergency Aid
There were signs the Israelis were
urging such emergency aid, at least a
speed up in shipment of fighter planes
under present contracts.
However, Pentagon sources said two
net F4 phantom jets which were due

to leave for Israel this week under
existing agreements were not sent.
Some U.S. supplies may already be
on the way. Witnesses reported that a
Boeing 707 transport-type plane
bearing Israeli markings loaded bombs
and air-to-air sidewinder and sparrow
missiles at the Oceana Naval Air
Station near Norfolk, Va.
The Iraqi announcement that its air
and land forces were fighting on both
fronts made it the third major Arab
country to enter the fight against the
Israelis in the fourth broad Arab-Israeli
conflict since 1948.
Arab Unity
Other Arab countries have pledged
support to Egypt and Syria and some
have sent token contingents.
The Beirut newspaper An Nahar
reported Iraq has committed 18,000
troops and 100 tanks along with an
undisclosed amount of air power to
back Syria on the Golan front and
Egypt in the Sinai battle.
The Israeli military command
claimed its raiding jets inflicted

"considerable damage" on the
French-built Damascus airport and
also blasted Syrian naval headquarters
on the Mediterranean and other
strategic targets in Syria and Egypt.
Air War
But Syria claimed its air defenses
rose to meet the four jets attacking
over Damascus and blasted three of
them out of the sky before they could
get near the airport. The fourth Israeli
jet fled with Syrian MIGs in hot

undisclosed amount of air power to
back Syria on the Golan front and
Egypt in the Sinai battle.
The Israeli military command
claimed its raiding jets inflicted

"considerable damage" on the
French-built Damascus airport and
also blasted Syrian naval headquarters
on the Mediterranean and other
strategic targets in Syria and Egypt.
Air War
But Syria claimed its air defenses
rose to meet the four jets attacking
over Damascus and blasted three of
them out of the sky before they could
get near the airport. The fourth Israeli
jet fled with Syrian MIGs in hot
pursuit and was downed before it
could reach safety in Israeli skies,
Damascus said.
The Israeli command said that jets
hit Egyptian air bases at Khusna and
Abu Hammad on an arc in the Nile
Delta only 27 miles from Cairo in
addition to a radar station on Egypt's
Mediterranean coast about 60 miles
east of Alexandria.
Foreign correspondents were barred
from both fronts and unable to make
independent checks on the conflicting
claims.
Israeli commandos crossed the Suez
Canal early this morning for the first
time in the new Middle East war and
made a hit-and-run attack on Egyptian
convoys, the Israeli command said at
dawn.
The Israelis said the commandos
returned safely across the
200-foot-wide canal after attacking
"convoys and rear echelons of the
enemy" in the canal's southern sector.
Earlier in the night, Israel had reported
"very little activity on both the Suez
front and the Golan Heights."
Israel said its gunboats shelled
Syrian oil installations during the night
at Latakia, Banias and Tartous on the
Mediterranean coast more than 300
miles from the Egyptian canal front. A
communique said "large flames could
be seen."
The Israelis claimed they sank two
Syrian missile boats; the Syrians
claimed they sank "three enemy
boats" and said a Greek ship, the
Murghot, also was sunk during the

attack.
Israel claimed yesterday that it
recaptured the Golan Heights from
Syria and its forces were pushing back
the Egyptian army along the Suez
Canal.
Iraq Enters
Iraq announced that its air and
ground forces have joined the war and
Jordan called up its reserves in what
could herald another escalation of the
five-day-old struggle.
Israeli Premier Golda Meir, who
announced that Israel had retaken the
heights, also said the Soviet Union was
pouring in new arms to fuel the Arab
onslaught.
Meanwhile, Israeli jets carried the
war. into Egypt and Syria for the
second consecutive day.
At the United Nations, Syrian
Deputy Foreign Minister Mohamed
Zakaria Ismail threatened air
retaliation against Israeli cities unless
the United Nations forces Israeli
planes to stop hitting civilian areas in
Syria. Ismail spoke to newsmen.
While the Security Council did not
convene yesterday, seventy nonaligned
nations at the United Nations pledged
support for the Arabs.
Jordan Uncommitted
Jordan fought with Syria and Egypt
against Israel in the 1967 war, but so
far has not committed forces to the
current fighting.
President Nixon said the United
States was "trying its best" to mediate
the "very dangerous situation" in the
Middle East.
A Pentagon spokesman declined

comment when asked about U.S. aid
to Israel, but there was no indication
that the United States was cutting
back its arms sales to Tel Aviv.
Syria and Egypt countered the
Israeli claims of victory in skies, and
reported shooting down 24 Israeli
warplanes. Israel claimed it shot down
20 Syrian and Egyptian fighter planes.
Neither side gave its own losses.
Lsraeli Claims
Israel had claimed once before that
its forces had pushed the Egyptians
back to the canal and had cleared the
Golan Heights of Syrian forces, but on
Tuesday an Israeli general said this was
not so.
Tel Aviv and Damascus reported
savage air clashes over the Golan
Heights battleground and during the
Israeli raids on targets in the Syrian

heartland. Each side claimed the other
suffered heavy losses.
President Nixon met with
congressional leaders in Washington
and won their support for his efforts
to halt the war. Nixon's peacemaking
proposal to the U.N. Security Council
remained stalled, however, over
conditions for a possible ceasefire.
Senate Majority Leader Mike
Mansfield of Montana said after thp
White House session that the question
of U.S. arms for Israel is "always
under advisement" but that it did not
arise in his talk with Nixon.
Soviet Arms
U.S. officials said the Soviet Union
was delivering "very large tonnages" of
military equipment to resupply Egypt
and Syria. They declined to say what

Other sources said big Russian
AN22 transports, which can carry
more than 50 tons, and other military
cargo planes from Russia had flown
"scores of sorties across the
Mediterranean" in the past two days.
The AN22 is capable of carrying
vehicles as big as surface-to-air missiles
which reportedly have been a major
target of Israeli air strikes in the Golan
Heights of Syrian and along the Suez
Canal.
Meanwhile, Nixon administration
authorities were reported debating
possible increased U.S. arms to Israel
to replace heavy combat losses in the
new Middle East fighting.
Emergency Aid
There were signs the Israelis were
urging such emergency aid, at least a
speed up in shipment of fighter planes
under present contracts.
However, Pentagon sources said two
net F4 phantom jets which were due

to leave for Israel this week under
existing agreements were not sent.
Some U.S. supplies may already be
on the way. Witnesses reported that a
Boeing 707 transport-type plane
bearing Israeli markings loaded bombs
and air-to-air sidewinder and sparrow
missiles at the Oceana Naval Air
Station near Norfolk, Va.
The Iraqi announcement that its air
and land forces were fighting on both
fronts made it the third major Arab
country to enter the fight against the
Israelis in the fourth broad Arab-Israeli
conflict since 1948.
Arab Unity
Other Arab countries have pledged
support to Egypt and Syria and some
have sent token contingents.
