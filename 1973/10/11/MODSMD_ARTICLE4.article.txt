# Iraq Enters War
## Israeli Commandos Cross Suez Canal 
### Associated Press 
Israeli commandos crossed the Suez
Canal early this morning for the first
time in the new Middle East war and
made a hit-and-run attack on Egyptian
convoys, the Israeli command said at
dawn.
The Israelis said the commandos
returned safely across the
200-foot-wide canal after attacking
"convoys and rear echelons of the
enemy" in the canal's southern sector.
Earlier in the night, Israel had reported
"very little activity on both the Suez
front and the Golan Heights."
Israel said its gunboats shelled
Syrian oil installations during the night
at Latakia, Banias and Tartous on the
Mediterranean coast more than 300
miles from the Egyptian canal front. A
communique said "large flames could
be seen."
The Israelis claimed they sank two
Syrian missile boats; the Syrians
claimed they sank "three enemy
boats" and said a Greek ship, the
Murghot, also was sunk during the

attack.
Israel claimed yesterday that it
recaptured the Golan Heights from
Syria and its forces were pushing back
the Egyptian army along the Suez
Canal.
Iraq Enters
Iraq announced that its air and
ground forces have joined the war and
Jordan called up its reserves in what
could herald another escalation of the
five-day-old struggle.
Israeli Premier Golda Meir, who
announced that Israel had retaken the
heights, also said the Soviet Union was
pouring in new arms to fuel the Arab
onslaught.
Meanwhile, Israeli jets carried the
war. into Egypt and Syria for the
second consecutive day.
At the United Nations, Syrian
Deputy Foreign Minister Mohamed
Zakaria Ismail threatened air
retaliation against Israeli cities unless
the United Nations forces Israeli
planes to stop hitting civilian areas in
Syria. Ismail spoke to newsmen.
While the Security Council did not
convene yesterday, seventy nonaligned
nations at the United Nations pledged
support for the Arabs.
Jordan Uncommitted
Jordan fought with Syria and Egypt
against Israel in the 1967 war, but so
far has not committed forces to the
current fighting.
President Nixon said the United
States was "trying its best" to mediate
the "very dangerous situation" in the
Middle East.
A Pentagon spokesman declined

comment when asked about U.S. aid
to Israel, but there was no indication
that the United States was cutting
back its arms sales to Tel Aviv.
Syria and Egypt countered the
Israeli claims of victory in skies, and
reported shooting down 24 Israeli
warplanes. Israel claimed it shot down
20 Syrian and Egyptian fighter planes.
Neither side gave its own losses.
Lsraeli Claims
Israel had claimed once before that
its forces had pushed the Egyptians
back to the canal and had cleared the
Golan Heights of Syrian forces, but on
Tuesday an Israeli general said this was
not so.
Tel Aviv and Damascus reported
savage air clashes over the Golan
Heights battleground and during the
Israeli raids on targets in the Syrian

heartland. Each side claimed the other
suffered heavy losses.
President Nixon met with
congressional leaders in Washington
and won their support for his efforts
to halt the war. Nixon's peacemaking
proposal to the U.N. Security Council
remained stalled, however, over
conditions for a possible ceasefire.
Senate Majority Leader Mike
Mansfield of Montana said after thp
White House session that the question
of U.S. arms for Israel is "always
under advisement" but that it did not
arise in his talk with Nixon.
Soviet Arms
U.S. officials said the Soviet Union
was delivering "very large tonnages" of
military equipment to resupply Egypt
and Syria. They declined to say what
