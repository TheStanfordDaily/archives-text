# Vice President Sentenced: $10,000 Fine, Probation
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Vice
President Spiro T. Agnew abruptly
resigned from office yesterday and
pleaded no contest to a charge of
federal income tax evasion. A judge
sentenced him to a $10,000 fine and
three years' probation.
President Nixon, expressing "a sense
of deep personal loss" over the
stunning development, met separately
with Democratic and Republican
congressional leaders at the White
House to discuss "procedural
questions" on the selection of a
successor.
The 25th amendment to the
Constitution gives the President the
power to appoint a new vice president
whenever a vacancy occurs. However,
the appointment must be confirmed
by both houses of Congress.
Agnew's resignation was part of an
agreement struck by his attorneys with
the Justice Department that allowed
him to plead no contest to a 1967 tax
fraud charge and have all other
allegations facing him dropped.
'Substantial Cash Payments'
Richardson, appearing with Agnew
in federal court in Baltimore, declared
that the corruption investigation
involving the vice president had
"established a pattern of substantial

cash payments" to him by contractors
when he was Baltimore county
executive, governor and as vice
president.
These payments continued from the
early 1960s into 1971, and one
engineer doing business with the state
made payoffs up to and including last
December, Richardson said.
Although the Justice Department
agreed to drop the charges of bribery,
extortion and conspiracy that Agnew
also faced, these were detailed in a
40-page document released through
the court. Agnew, while not contesting
the tax evasion charge, denied all the
others.
Leniency Justified
Richardson, who two weeks ago
ordered the evidence against Agnew to
be submitted to a federal grand jury in
Baltimore, outlined the plea bargaining
which took place between the Justice
Department and Agnew's own lawyers,
and then said he felt leniency in
Agnew's case was justified.
He asked U.S. District Court Judge
Walter E. Hoffman, in passing
sentence, to consider Agnew's service
as vice president.
Hoffman read a statement in which
he said he considered Agnew's plea as
"the full equivalent of a plea of
guilty," and noted that such pleas
often are accepted in tax cases.
Terming it "a most serious charge,"
he said it has been his practice in cases
involving lawyers, tax accountants or
businessmen, to impose fines and two
to five months of actual imprisonment
as a deterrent.
'National Interests'
"But for the strong
recommendation of the attorney
general in this case I would be inclined
to follow the same procedure,"
Hoffman said. "However, I am
persuaded that the national interests in
this case are so great and so
compelling ... that the ends of justice
would be better served by making an
exception to the general rule."
He then passed the sentence of a
$10,000 fine and three years of
unsupervised probation.
Agnew, his face drawn and hands
unsteady, read his own statement
before Hoffman and stood flanked by
his attorneys as one of them, Jay H.
Topkis, formally entered the plea of
nolo contendere — no contest.
Possible successors to Agnew
include former Treasury Secretary
John B. Connally Jr., a former Texas
Democrat turned Republican; Gov.
Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York;
Gov. Ronald Reagan of California;
Atty. Gen. Elliot L. Richardson;
presidential assistant Melvin R. Laird;
Sen. Howard H. Baker Jr., R-Tenn.;
and Republican National Chairman
George Bush.
Observers also consider former
Secretary of State William P. Rogers;
former Pennsylvania Gov. William W.
Scranton; Senate Minority Leader
Hugh Scott, R-Pa.; House Minority
Leader Gerald R. Ford of Michigan
and Sen. Barry M. Goldwater, R-Ariz.
to be in the running.
The thunderbolt disclosure of the
resignation, the second by a vice
president in U.S. history, was almost
casually revealed by a staff secretary
here as Agnew himself appeared in the
courtroom.
'Swift Disposition'
The 55-year-old vice president told
Hoffman that his decision to resign
and plead no contest to the felony
charge "rests on my firm belief that
the public interest requires swift
disposition of the problems which are
facing me."
He said his lawyers had advised him
that a legal battle over the allegations
against him could last for years and
the attending publicity would divert

public attention from other problems,
"to the country's detriment."
Agnew admitted yesterday to
receiving payments in 1967 which
were not reported on his income tax
and also that he was aware of
payments made to others. But he
denied that any payments had ever
influenced his execution of the public
trust as Baltimore county executive,
governor or vice president.
No Accounting
The actual charge against him,
contained in an information filed by
the Justice Department, was that he
failed to account for some $13,551.47
in federal taxes for the year 1967.
In that year, the information said,
he reported income of $26,099 and
taxes of $6416, when in fact his
income had been $55,599 owing
$19,967.47 in taxes.
The resignation was effective at
11:05 a.m. (PDT) yesterday and it
first became publicly known about 20
minutes later.
A staff secretary, Lisa Brown,
responding to an Associated Press
reporter's question about the
Baltimore court appearance, said
simply, "the vice president has
resigned. The Agnew staff aides have
just come from a meeting at which
they were informed he has
resigned . .."
Letter To Kissinger
As Agnew appeared in court, his
letter of resignation was delivered to
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger,
who under the law receives formal
resignations of nationally elected
officials.
Similar letters were dispatched to
President Nixon and Democratic and
Republican leaders of the House and
Senate.
In his letter to Nixon, Agnew said,
"As you are aware, the accusations
against me cannot be resolved without
a long, divisive and debilitating
struggle in the Congress and in the
courts."
Saying that it was "painful" for
himself and his family, Agnew told
Nixon that "it is in the best interest of
the nation that I relinquish the vice
presidency." He added "it has been a
privilege to serve with you."
Nixon's Reply
Nixon, on receipt of Agnew's letter,
immediately drafted a reply in the
Oval Office, where Agnew had
informed Nixon of his decision in a
secret, 40-minute meeting Tuesday
night.
In his reply, Nixon said he was
"deeply saddened by this whole course
of events."
"The most difficult decisions are
often those that are the most personal,
and I know your decision to resign as
vice president has been as difficult as
any facing a man in public life could

be," he told Agnew.
Since the Wall Street Journal first
disclosed Agnew's involvement in the
federal probe on Aug. 7, there have
been persistent reports that Nixon
wanted him to quit and had tried to
force him out with pressure applied by
White House aides through the news
media.
'Personal Decision'
The White House has denied this,
however, and a spokesman said
yesterday that Nixon "played no
direct role in the decision." It was, a
spokesman said, "a personal decision
that only the vice president could
make,"
Agnew left the courthouse
immediately after the 30-minute
hearing.
In a brief statement to newsmen, he
said the Justice Department had not
been fully prosecuting witnesses in his
case and that some had received either
partial or total immunity, a fact which
had been widely reported in the press.
Agnew's resignation was the first
such occurrence since John C. Calhoun
quit on Dec. 28, 1832, to become a
South Carolina senator. Seven vice
presidents have died in office.
Effect On Investigation?
It was not immediately certain what
effect the stunning development
would have on the Baltimore
investigation.
It apparently cut short a court test
on whether a sitting vice president
could be indicted without first being
impeached, but it was not clear
whether it also terminated another test
of the right of newsmen to protect
their confidential sources.
Last week Agnew's lawyers had
gone to court with companion briefs
arguing for an end to the investigation.
Hoffman, meanwhile, had allowed
them to subpoena nine newsmen to
reveal the sources of news leaks that
the vice president claimed were
violating his civil rights. The newsmen
were scheduled to appear before
Hoffman today, but their appearance
was canceled because the case was
considered moot.

letter of resignation was delivered to
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger,
who under the law receives formal
resignations of nationally elected
officials.
Similar letters were dispatched to
President Nixon and Democratic and
Republican leaders of the House and
Senate.
In his letter to Nixon, Agnew said,
"As you are aware, the accusations
against me cannot be resolved without
a long, divisive and debilitating
struggle in the Congress and in the
courts."
Saying that it was "painful" for
himself and his family, Agnew told
Nixon that "it is in the best interest of
the nation that I relinquish the vice
presidency." He added "it has been a
privilege to serve with you."
Nixon's Reply
Nixon, on receipt of Agnew's letter,
immediately drafted a reply in the
Oval Office, where Agnew had
informed Nixon of his decision in a
secret, 40-minute meeting Tuesday
night.
In his reply, Nixon said he was
"deeply saddened by this whole course
of events."
"The most difficult decisions are
often those that are the most personal,
and I know your decision to resign as
vice president has been as difficult as
any facing a man in public life could

be," he told Agnew.
Since the Wall Street Journal first
disclosed Agnew's involvement in the
federal probe on Aug. 7, there have
been persistent reports that Nixon
wanted him to quit and had tried to
force him out with pressure applied by
White House aides through the news
media.
'Personal Decision'
The White House has denied this,
however, and a spokesman said
yesterday that Nixon "played no
direct role in the decision." It was, a
spokesman said, "a personal decision
that only the vice president could
make,"
Agnew left the courthouse
immediately after the 30-minute
hearing.
In a brief statement to newsmen, he
said the Justice Department had not
been fully prosecuting witnesses in his
case and that some had received either
partial or total immunity, a fact which
had been widely reported in the press.
Agnew's resignation was the first
such occurrence since John C. Calhoun
quit on Dec. 28, 1832, to become a
South Carolina senator. Seven vice
presidents have died in office.
Effect On Investigation?
It was not immediately certain what
effect the stunning development
would have on the Baltimore
investigation.
It apparently cut short a court test
on whether a sitting vice president
could be indicted without first being
impeached, but it was not clear
whether it also terminated another test
of the right of newsmen to protect
their confidential sources.
Last week Agnew's lawyers had
gone to court with companion briefs
arguing for an end to the investigation.
Hoffman, meanwhile, had allowed
them to subpoena nine newsmen to
reveal the sources of news leaks that
the vice president claimed were
violating his civil rights. The newsmen
were scheduled to appear before
Hoffman today, but their appearance
was canceled because the case was
considered moot.
WASHINGTON (AP) - Vice
President Spiro T. Agnew abruptly
resigned from office yesterday and
pleaded no contest to a charge of
federal income tax evasion. A judge
sentenced him to a $10,000 fine and
three years' probation.
President Nixon, expressing "a sense
of deep personal loss" over the
stunning development, met separately
with Democratic and Republican
congressional leaders at the White
House to discuss "procedural
questions" on the selection of a
successor.
The 25th amendment to the
Constitution gives the President the
power to appoint a new vice president
whenever a vacancy occurs. However,
the appointment must be confirmed
by both houses of Congress.
Agnew's resignation was part of an
agreement struck by his attorneys with
the Justice Department that allowed
him to plead no contest to a 1967 tax
fraud charge and have all other
allegations facing him dropped.
'Substantial Cash Payments'
Richardson, appearing with Agnew
in federal court in Baltimore, declared
that the corruption investigation
involving the vice president had
"established a pattern of substantial

cash payments" to him by contractors
when he was Baltimore county
executive, governor and as vice
president.
These payments continued from the
early 1960s into 1971, and one
engineer doing business with the state
made payoffs up to and including last
December, Richardson said.
Although the Justice Department
agreed to drop the charges of bribery,
extortion and conspiracy that Agnew
also faced, these were detailed in a
40-page document released through
the court. Agnew, while not contesting
the tax evasion charge, denied all the
others.
Leniency Justified
Richardson, who two weeks ago
ordered the evidence against Agnew to
be submitted to a federal grand jury in
Baltimore, outlined the plea bargaining
which took place between the Justice
Department and Agnew's own lawyers,
and then said he felt leniency in
Agnew's case was justified.
He asked U.S. District Court Judge
Walter E. Hoffman, in passing
sentence, to consider Agnew's service
as vice president.
Hoffman read a statement in which
he said he considered Agnew's plea as
"the full equivalent of a plea of
guilty," and noted that such pleas
often are accepted in tax cases.
Terming it "a most serious charge,"
he said it has been his practice in cases
involving lawyers, tax accountants or
businessmen, to impose fines and two
to five months of actual imprisonment
as a deterrent.
'National Interests'
"But for the strong
recommendation of the attorney
general in this case I would be inclined
to follow the same procedure,"
Hoffman said. "However, I am
persuaded that the national interests in
this case are so great and so
compelling ... that the ends of justice
would be better served by making an
exception to the general rule."
He then passed the sentence of a
$10,000 fine and three years of
unsupervised probation.
Agnew, his face drawn and hands
unsteady, read his own statement
before Hoffman and stood flanked by
his attorneys as one of them, Jay H.
Topkis, formally entered the plea of
nolo contendere — no contest.
Possible successors to Agnew
include former Treasury Secretary
John B. Connally Jr., a former Texas
Democrat turned Republican; Gov.
Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York;
Gov. Ronald Reagan of California;
Atty. Gen. Elliot L. Richardson;
presidential assistant Melvin R. Laird;
Sen. Howard H. Baker Jr., R-Tenn.;
and Republican National Chairman
George Bush.
Observers also consider former
Secretary of State William P. Rogers;
former Pennsylvania Gov. William W.
Scranton; Senate Minority Leader
Hugh Scott, R-Pa.; House Minority
Leader Gerald R. Ford of Michigan
and Sen. Barry M. Goldwater, R-Ariz.
to be in the running.
The thunderbolt disclosure of the
resignation, the second by a vice
president in U.S. history, was almost
casually revealed by a staff secretary
here as Agnew himself appeared in the
courtroom.
'Swift Disposition'
The 55-year-old vice president told
Hoffman that his decision to resign
and plead no contest to the felony
charge "rests on my firm belief that
the public interest requires swift
disposition of the problems which are
facing me."
He said his lawyers had advised him
that a legal battle over the allegations
against him could last for years and
the attending publicity would divert

public attention from other problems,
"to the country's detriment."
Agnew admitted yesterday to
receiving payments in 1967 which
were not reported on his income tax
and also that he was aware of
payments made to others. But he
denied that any payments had ever
influenced his execution of the public
trust as Baltimore county executive,
governor or vice president.
No Accounting
The actual charge against him,
contained in an information filed by
the Justice Department, was that he
failed to account for some $13,551.47
in federal taxes for the year 1967.
In that year, the information said,
he reported income of $26,099 and
taxes of $6416, when in fact his
income had been $55,599 owing
$19,967.47 in taxes.
The resignation was effective at
11:05 a.m. (PDT) yesterday and it
first became publicly known about 20
minutes later.
A staff secretary, Lisa Brown,
responding to an Associated Press
reporter's question about the
Baltimore court appearance, said
simply, "the vice president has
resigned. The Agnew staff aides have
just come from a meeting at which
they were informed he has
resigned . .."

He then passed the sentence of a
$10,000 fine and three years of
unsupervised probation.
Agnew, his face drawn and hands
unsteady, read his own statement
before Hoffman and stood flanked by
his attorneys as one of them, Jay H.
Topkis, formally entered the plea of
nolo contendere — no contest.
Possible successors to Agnew
include former Treasury Secretary
John B. Connally Jr., a former Texas
Democrat turned Republican; Gov.
Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York;
Gov. Ronald Reagan of California;
Atty. Gen. Elliot L. Richardson;
presidential assistant Melvin R. Laird;
Sen. Howard H. Baker Jr., R-Tenn.;
and Republican National Chairman
George Bush.
Observers also consider former
Secretary of State William P. Rogers;
former Pennsylvania Gov. William W.
Scranton; Senate Minority Leader
Hugh Scott, R-Pa.; House Minority
Leader Gerald R. Ford of Michigan
and Sen. Barry M. Goldwater, R-Ariz.
to be in the running.
The thunderbolt disclosure of the
resignation, the second by a vice
president in U.S. history, was almost
casually revealed by a staff secretary
here as Agnew himself appeared in the
courtroom.
'Swift Disposition'
The 55-year-old vice president told
Hoffman that his decision to resign
and plead no contest to the felony
charge "rests on my firm belief that
the public interest requires swift
disposition of the problems which are
facing me."
He said his lawyers had advised him
that a legal battle over the allegations
against him could last for years and
the attending publicity would divert

public attention from other problems,
"to the country's detriment."
Agnew admitted yesterday to
receiving payments in 1967 which
were not reported on his income tax
and also that he was aware of
payments made to others. But he
denied that any payments had ever
influenced his execution of the public
trust as Baltimore county executive,
governor or vice president.
No Accounting
The actual charge against him,
contained in an information filed by
the Justice Department, was that he
failed to account for some $13,551.47
in federal taxes for the year 1967.
In that year, the information said,
he reported income of $26,099 and
taxes of $6416, when in fact his
income had been $55,599 owing
$19,967.47 in taxes.
The resignation was effective at
11:05 a.m. (PDT) yesterday and it
first became publicly known about 20
minutes later.
A staff secretary, Lisa Brown,
responding to an Associated Press
reporter's question about the
Baltimore court appearance, said
simply, "the vice president has
resigned. The Agnew staff aides have
just come from a meeting at which
they were informed he has
resigned . .."
Letter To Kissinger
As Agnew appeared in court, his
letter of resignation was delivered to
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger,
who under the law receives formal
resignations of nationally elected
officials.
Similar letters were dispatched to
President Nixon and Democratic and
Republican leaders of the House and
Senate.
In his letter to Nixon, Agnew said,
"As you are aware, the accusations
against me cannot be resolved without
a long, divisive and debilitating
struggle in the Congress and in the
courts."
Saying that it was "painful" for
himself and his family, Agnew told
Nixon that "it is in the best interest of
the nation that I relinquish the vice
presidency." He added "it has been a
privilege to serve with you."
Nixon's Reply
Nixon, on receipt of Agnew's letter,
immediately drafted a reply in the
Oval Office, where Agnew had
informed Nixon of his decision in a
secret, 40-minute meeting Tuesday
night.
In his reply, Nixon said he was
"deeply saddened by this whole course
of events."
"The most difficult decisions are
often those that are the most personal,
and I know your decision to resign as
vice president has been as difficult as
any facing a man in public life could

be," he told Agnew.
Since the Wall Street Journal first
disclosed Agnew's involvement in the
federal probe on Aug. 7, there have
been persistent reports that Nixon
wanted him to quit and had tried to
force him out with pressure applied by
White House aides through the news
media.
'Personal Decision'
The White House has denied this,
however, and a spokesman said
yesterday that Nixon "played no
direct role in the decision." It was, a
spokesman said, "a personal decision
that only the vice president could
make,"
Agnew left the courthouse
immediately after the 30-minute
hearing.
In a brief statement to newsmen, he
said the Justice Department had not
been fully prosecuting witnesses in his
case and that some had received either
partial or total immunity, a fact which
had been widely reported in the press.
Agnew's resignation was the first
such occurrence since John C. Calhoun
quit on Dec. 28, 1832, to become a
South Carolina senator. Seven vice
presidents have died in office.
Effect On Investigation?
It was not immediately certain what
effect the stunning development
would have on the Baltimore
investigation.
It apparently cut short a court test
on whether a sitting vice president
could be indicted without first being
impeached, but it was not clear
whether it also terminated another test
of the right of newsmen to protect
their confidential sources.
Last week Agnew's lawyers had
gone to court with companion briefs
arguing for an end to the investigation.
Hoffman, meanwhile, had allowed
them to subpoena nine newsmen to
reveal the sources of news leaks that
the vice president claimed were
violating his civil rights. The newsmen
were scheduled to appear before
Hoffman today, but their appearance
was canceled because the case was
considered moot.
WASHINGTON (AP) - Vice
President Spiro T. Agnew abruptly
resigned from office yesterday and
pleaded no contest to a charge of
federal income tax evasion. A judge
sentenced him to a $10,000 fine and
three years' probation.
President Nixon, expressing "a sense
of deep personal loss" over the
stunning development, met separately
with Democratic and Republican
congressional leaders at the White
House to discuss "procedural
questions" on the selection of a
successor.
The 25th amendment to the
Constitution gives the President the
power to appoint a new vice president
whenever a vacancy occurs. However,
the appointment must be confirmed
by both houses of Congress.
Agnew's resignation was part of an
agreement struck by his attorneys with
the Justice Department that allowed
him to plead no contest to a 1967 tax
fraud charge and have all other
allegations facing him dropped.
'Substantial Cash Payments'
Richardson, appearing with Agnew
in federal court in Baltimore, declared
that the corruption investigation
involving the vice president had
"established a pattern of substantial

cash payments" to him by contractors
when he was Baltimore county
executive, governor and as vice
president.
These payments continued from the
early 1960s into 1971, and one
engineer doing business with the state
made payoffs up to and including last
December, Richardson said.
Although the Justice Department
agreed to drop the charges of bribery,
extortion and conspiracy that Agnew
also faced, these were detailed in a
40-page document released through
the court. Agnew, while not contesting
the tax evasion charge, denied all the
others.
Leniency Justified
Richardson, who two weeks ago
ordered the evidence against Agnew to
be submitted to a federal grand jury in
Baltimore, outlined the plea bargaining
which took place between the Justice
Department and Agnew's own lawyers,
and then said he felt leniency in
Agnew's case was justified.
He asked U.S. District Court Judge
Walter E. Hoffman, in passing
sentence, to consider Agnew's service
as vice president.
Hoffman read a statement in which
he said he considered Agnew's plea as
"the full equivalent of a plea of
guilty," and noted that such pleas
often are accepted in tax cases.
Terming it "a most serious charge,"
he said it has been his practice in cases
involving lawyers, tax accountants or
businessmen, to impose fines and two
to five months of actual imprisonment
as a deterrent.
'National Interests'
"But for the strong
recommendation of the attorney
general in this case I would be inclined
to follow the same procedure,"
Hoffman said. "However, I am
persuaded that the national interests in
this case are so great and so
compelling ... that the ends of justice
would be better served by making an
exception to the general rule."
He then passed the sentence of a
$10,000 fine and three years of
unsupervised probation.
Agnew, his face drawn and hands
unsteady, read his own statement
before Hoffman and stood flanked by
his attorneys as one of them, Jay H.
Topkis, formally entered the plea of
nolo contendere — no contest.
Possible successors to Agnew
include former Treasury Secretary
John B. Connally Jr., a former Texas
Democrat turned Republican; Gov.
Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York;
Gov. Ronald Reagan of California;
Atty. Gen. Elliot L. Richardson;
presidential assistant Melvin R. Laird;
Sen. Howard H. Baker Jr., R-Tenn.;
and Republican National Chairman
George Bush.
Observers also consider former
Secretary of State William P. Rogers;
former Pennsylvania Gov. William W.
Scranton; Senate Minority Leader
Hugh Scott, R-Pa.; House Minority

and Sen. Barry M. Goldwater, R-Ariz.
to be in the running.

WASHINGTON (AP) - Vice
President Spiro T. Agnew abruptly
resigned from office yesterday and
pleaded no contest to a charge of
federal income tax evasion. A judge
sentenced him to a $10,000 fine and
three years' probation.
President Nixon, expressing "a sense
of deep personal loss" over the
stunning development, met separately
with Democratic and Republican
congressional leaders at the White
House to discuss "procedural
questions" on the selection of a
successor.
The 25th amendment to the
Constitution gives the President the
power to appoint a new vice president
whenever a vacancy occurs. However,
the appointment must be confirmed
by both houses of Congress.
Agnew's resignation was part of an
agreement struck by his attorneys with
the Justice Department that allowed
him to plead no contest to a 1967 tax
fraud charge and have all other
allegations facing him dropped.
'Substantial Cash Payments'
Richardson, appearing with Agnew
in federal court in Baltimore, declared
that the corruption investigation
involving the vice president had
"established a pattern of substantial

cash payments" to him by contractors
when he was Baltimore county
executive, governor and as vice
president.
These payments continued from the
early 1960s into 1971, and one
engineer doing business with the state
made payoffs up to and including last
December, Richardson said.
Although the Justice Department
agreed to drop the charges of bribery,
extortion and conspiracy that Agnew
also faced, these were detailed in a
40-page document released through
the court. Agnew, while not contesting
the tax evasion charge, denied all the
others.
Leniency Justified
Richardson, who two weeks ago
ordered the evidence against Agnew to
be submitted to a federal grand jury in
Baltimore, outlined the plea bargaining
which took place between the Justice
Department and Agnew's own lawyers,
and then said he felt leniency in
Agnew's case was justified.
He asked U.S. District Court Judge
Walter E. Hoffman, in passing
sentence, to consider Agnew's service
as vice president.
Hoffman read a statement in which
he said he considered Agnew's plea as
"the full equivalent of a plea of
guilty," and noted that such pleas
often are accepted in tax cases.
Terming it "a most serious charge,"
he said it has been his practice in cases
involving lawyers, tax accountants or
businessmen, to impose fines and two
to five months of actual imprisonment
as a deterrent.
'National Interests'
"But for the strong
recommendation of the attorney
general in this case I would be inclined
to follow the same procedure,"
Hoffman said. "However, I am
persuaded that the national interests in
this case are so great and so
compelling ... that the ends of justice
would be better served by making an
exception to the general rule."
He then passed the sentence of a
$10,000 fine and three years of
unsupervised probation.
Agnew, his face drawn and hands
unsteady, read his own statement
before Hoffman and stood flanked by
his attorneys as one of them, Jay H.
Topkis, formally entered the plea of
nolo contendere — no contest.
Possible successors to Agnew
include former Treasury Secretary
John B. Connally Jr., a former Texas
Democrat turned Republican; Gov.
Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York;
Gov. Ronald Reagan of California;
Atty. Gen. Elliot L. Richardson;
presidential assistant Melvin R. Laird;
Sen. Howard H. Baker Jr., R-Tenn.;
and Republican National Chairman
George Bush.
Observers also consider former
Secretary of State William P. Rogers;
former Pennsylvania Gov. William W.
Scranton; Senate Minority Leader
Hugh Scott, R-Pa.; House Minority
Leader Gerald R. Ford of Michigan
and Sen. Barry M. Goldwater, R-Ariz.
to be in the running.
The thunderbolt disclosure of the
resignation, the second by a vice
president in U.S. history, was almost
casually revealed by a staff secretary
here as Agnew himself appeared in the
courtroom.
'Swift Disposition'
The 55-year-old vice president told
Hoffman that his decision to resign
and plead no contest to the felony
charge "rests on my firm belief that
the public interest requires swift
disposition of the problems which are
facing me."
He said his lawyers had advised him
that a legal battle over the allegations
against him could last for years and
the attending publicity would divert

public attention from other problems,
"to the country's detriment."
Agnew admitted yesterday to
receiving payments in 1967 which
were not reported on his income tax
and also that he was aware of
payments made to others. But he
denied that any payments had ever
influenced his execution of the public
trust as Baltimore county executive,
governor or vice president.
No Accounting
The actual charge against him,
contained in an information filed by
the Justice Department, was that he
failed to account for some $13,551.47
in federal taxes for the year 1967.
In that year, the information said,
he reported income of $26,099 and
taxes of $6416, when in fact his
income had been $55,599 owing
$19,967.47 in taxes.
The resignation was effective at
11:05 a.m. (PDT) yesterday and it
first became publicly known about 20
minutes later.
A staff secretary, Lisa Brown,
responding to an Associated Press
reporter's question about the
Baltimore court appearance, said
simply, "the vice president has
resigned. The Agnew staff aides have
just come from a meeting at which
they were informed he has
resigned . .."
Letter To Kissinger
As Agnew appeared in court, his
letter of resignation was delivered to
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger,
who under the law receives formal
resignations of nationally elected
officials.
Similar letters were dispatched to
President Nixon and Democratic and
Republican leaders of the House and
Senate.
In his letter to Nixon, Agnew said,
"As you are aware, the accusations
against me cannot be resolved without
a long, divisive and debilitating
struggle in the Congress and in the
courts."
Saying that it was "painful" for
himself and his family, Agnew told
Nixon that "it is in the best interest of
the nation that I relinquish the vice
presidency." He added "it has been a
privilege to serve with you."
Nixon's Reply
Nixon, on receipt of Agnew's letter,
immediately drafted a reply in the
Oval Office, where Agnew had
informed Nixon of his decision in a
secret, 40-minute meeting Tuesday
night.
In his reply, Nixon said he was
"deeply saddened by this whole course
of events."
"The most difficult decisions are
often those that are the most personal,
and I know your decision to resign as
vice president has been as difficult as
any facing a man in public life could

be," he told Agnew.
Since the Wall Street Journal first
disclosed Agnew's involvement in the
federal probe on Aug. 7, there have
been persistent reports that Nixon
wanted him to quit and had tried to
force him out with pressure applied by
White House aides through the news
media.
'Personal Decision'
The White House has denied this,
however, and a spokesman said
yesterday that Nixon "played no
direct role in the decision." It was, a
spokesman said, "a personal decision
that only the vice president could
make,"
Agnew left the courthouse
immediately after the 30-minute
hearing.
In a brief statement to newsmen, he
said the Justice Department had not
been fully prosecuting witnesses in his
case and that some had received either
partial or total immunity, a fact which
had been widely reported in the press.
Agnew's resignation was the first
such occurrence since John C. Calhoun
quit on Dec. 28, 1832, to become a
South Carolina senator. Seven vice
presidents have died in office.
Effect On Investigation?
It was not immediately certain what
effect the stunning development
would have on the Baltimore
investigation.
It apparently cut short a court test
on whether a sitting vice president
could be indicted without first being
impeached, but it was not clear
whether it also terminated another test
of the right of newsmen to protect
their confidential sources.
Last week Agnew's lawyers had
gone to court with companion briefs
arguing for an end to the investigation.
Hoffman, meanwhile, had allowed
them to subpoena nine newsmen to
reveal the sources of news leaks that
the vice president claimed were
violating his civil rights. The newsmen
were scheduled to appear before
Hoffman today, but their appearance
was canceled because the case was
considered moot.
