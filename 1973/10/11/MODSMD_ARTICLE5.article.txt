# Vice President Sentenced: $10,000 Fine, Probation

WASHINGTON (AP) - Vice
President Spiro T. Agnew abruptly
resigned from office yesterday and
pleaded no contest to a charge of
federal income tax evasion. A judge
sentenced him to a $10,000 fine and
three years' probation.
President Nixon, expressing "a sense
of deep personal loss" over the
stunning development, met separately
with Democratic and Republican
congressional leaders at the White
House to discuss "procedural
questions" on the selection of a
successor.
The 25th amendment to the
Constitution gives the President the
power to appoint a new vice president
whenever a vacancy occurs. However,
the appointment must be confirmed
by both houses of Congress.
Agnew's resignation was part of an
agreement struck by his attorneys with
the Justice Department that allowed
him to plead no contest to a 1967 tax
fraud charge and have all other
allegations facing him dropped.
'Substantial Cash Payments'
Richardson, appearing with Agnew
in federal court in Baltimore, declared
that the corruption investigation
involving the vice president had
"established a pattern of substantial

cash payments" to him by contractors
when he was Baltimore county
executive, governor and as vice
president.
These payments continued from the
early 1960s into 1971, and one
engineer doing business with the state
made payoffs up to and including last
December, Richardson said.
Although the Justice Department
agreed to drop the charges of bribery,
extortion and conspiracy that Agnew
also faced, these were detailed in a
40-page document released through
the court. Agnew, while not contesting
the tax evasion charge, denied all the
others.
Leniency Justified
Richardson, who two weeks ago
ordered the evidence against Agnew to
be submitted to a federal grand jury in
Baltimore, outlined the plea bargaining
which took place between the Justice
Department and Agnew's own lawyers,
and then said he felt leniency in
Agnew's case was justified.
He asked U.S. District Court Judge
Walter E. Hoffman, in passing
sentence, to consider Agnew's service
as vice president.
Hoffman read a statement in which
he said he considered Agnew's plea as
"the full equivalent of a plea of
guilty," and noted that such pleas
often are accepted in tax cases.
Terming it "a most serious charge,"
he said it has been his practice in cases
involving lawyers, tax accountants or
businessmen, to impose fines and two
to five months of actual imprisonment
as a deterrent.
'National Interests'
"But for the strong
recommendation of the attorney
general in this case I would be inclined
to follow the same procedure,"
Hoffman said. "However, I am
persuaded that the national interests in
this case are so great and so
compelling ... that the ends of justice
would be better served by making an
exception to the general rule."
He then passed the sentence of a
$10,000 fine and three years of
unsupervised probation.
Agnew, his face drawn and hands
unsteady, read his own statement
before Hoffman and stood flanked by
his attorneys as one of them, Jay H.
Topkis, formally entered the plea of
