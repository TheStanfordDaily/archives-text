# Rally Held In Support Of Israel
## 
### DAVID SMITH 
A crowd of 300 gathered in White Plaza yesterday
noon to hear speakers affirm their support for Israel in the
current Middle East war.
An Israeli graduate student in economics, Avi
Braverman, made an emotional defense of his homeland,
calling it"the only nation in the world that has to
continually fight for its life — for its very survival."
He continued, "We don't want bloodshed, we want to
live in peace; but first of all we want to live. We know we
must defend ourselves."
Rabbi Charles Familant, leader of the Stanford Jewish
community, also denied that Israel is the aggressor in the
conflict. Familant stated that Israel knew of the
impending Arab attack last week but failed to launch a
pre-emptory attack, "naively" trusting diplomacy to solve
the crisis. He also contended that civilian casualties in
Damascus were an unavoidable consequence of military
attack.

Mitt Mittelman, a Stanford alumnus and leader of the
local Jewish community, described Israel's role in world
affairs, noting, "It is only the Arabs who refuse to
negotiate." He called on the U.S. to commit itself to
aiding Israel.
The rally audience, many wearing buttons proclaiming
"Israel Must Live," also heard ASSU Vice President Jim
Friend welcome supporters of Israel and declare that the
rally's purpose was "most importantly to aid in the search
for a lasting peace" for the war-torn land. Friend was one
of the rally's sponsors, as was the Hillel Foundation, the
Jewish Students of Stanford and the Israeli Students'
Committee.
Volunteers at the rally collected funds for the Israel
Emergency Fund and pledges for future blood donations
to help replenish dwindling supplies in the nation.
The solicitors noted that no money contributed would
go to military aid, but would be used for domestic
expenses in Israel.
