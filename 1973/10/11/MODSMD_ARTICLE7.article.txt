Over the bodies of some
15,000 dead Chilean workers, the
Junta has succeeded in turning the
clock back to 1955. In that year,
President Carlos Ibanez also
invited a team of U.S. economic
"experts" to reorganize an ailing
economy.
Then, as now, the "experts' "
recommendations were easily
predictable: lower workers' wages,
honor the "efficiency" of U.S.
copper companies, allow free
entry of foreign capital, loosen
the "market" from government
constraints. . . .
But then, unlike now, the
"experts" did not have sufficient
firepower mobilized to back up
their "scientific" proposals.
In 1955, the Chilean
government was constrained by
strong democratic institutions.
The Congress, the unions, the
political parties, expressions of
the conflicting sectors of society,
were able to dilute
"tough-minded" policies.
Nevertheless, the U.S. advisers
had cause, in 1955, for hoping
that the then President, Carlos
Ibanez, would display the
necessary force; Ibanez was an
ex-General, and had been Chile's
last real military dictator, in the
late twenties.
General Strike
The Workers Confederation
called a general strike against the
Ibanez and the U.S.-inspired wage
reductions and swelling
unemployment rolls. At first
Ibanez did not disappoint his
advisers. He ordered the arrest of
the union leaders, and smashed
the strike.
But a year later, without
warning, violent street fighting
flared in Santiago. The immediate
cause: a rise in bus fares. The
underlying motivation: the
Chilean workers refused to accept

an economic policy initiated by,
and in the interests of, the Chilean
wealthy and the United States.
This and other political
upheavals proved too much for
ex-General Ibanez, and he refused
to call in his former
comrades-in-arms; the unions, the
Congress, the opposition reduced
the President-General to near
impotency. The U.S. economic
advisers left in disgust.
Close Election
Popular discontent in 1958
nearly resulted in the election of
Salvador Allende, but the
conservative, Jorge Allessandri,
beat him by a mere 30,000 votes.
Once again, the Right looked for a
tough policy, and president
Alessandri did try to salvage the
remains of the U.S.-inspired
economic doctrines. Wages were
lowered even further, foreign
loans, public and private, flowed
in, and a U.S.-styled suburb
blossomed on the outskirts of
Santiago.
But Alessandri, too, proved too
weak. The unions grew in
strength, the Congress was
meddlesome, and political
agitation increased. Some of his
supporters urged Alessandri to
resort to strong-armed rule as a
necessary prerequisite for "sound

economic management."
Jorge Allessandri came from an
old political family; indeed, his
father, Arturo, had been Chile's
greatest populist, the founding
force behind the nation's
Constitution, in effect since 1925,
and the initiator of much of
Chile's social legislation. In the
stormy depression years of the
19305, Alessandri's father had led
the "civilist" forces, which, while
in favor of restoring order, had
opposed military rule.
Sympathetic To U.S.
In his mind, Alessandri [the
younger] believed in the
economics of the U.S. advisers, of
attracting foreign capital by
lowering Chilean workers' wages;
but he hadn't the heart to resort
to the militaristic tactics necessary
to implement them.
Strikes increased under
Alessandri's government, and
political agitation reached new
heights. Alessandri fought the
unions, and many strikes were
smashed by the para-military
police, whose greater efficiency
was a product of emergency
injections of U.S. military and
"public safety" aid.
But President Alessandri
refused to brush aside the 1925
Constitution, was unwilling to

Richard Feinberg

dismantle a system of civil
liberties and social conquests that
Chilean society had constructed
over a period of two generations.
By the end of Alessandri's
term, in 1964, the demand for
reform was so intense that the
conservative nominee candidacy
collapsed; the Rightists rushed to
vote for the lesser of the two evils,
the Christian Democrat, Eduardo
Frei, although Frei, like his only
opponent, Salvador Allende, was
promising the people a
thorough-going social revolution,
distinguished from Allende's only
in that it would be a "revolution
in liberty."

Then, as now, the "experts' "
recommendations were easily
predictable: lower workers' wages,
honor the "efficiency" of U.S.
copper companies, allow free
entry of foreign capital, loosen
the "market" from government
constraints. . . .
But then, unlike now, the
"experts" did not have sufficient
firepower mobilized to back up
their "scientific" proposals.
In 1955, the Chilean
government was constrained by
strong democratic institutions.
The Congress, the unions, the
political parties, expressions of
the conflicting sectors of society,
were able to dilute
"tough-minded" policies.
Nevertheless, the U.S. advisers
had cause, in 1955, for hoping
that the then President, Carlos
Ibanez, would display the
necessary force; Ibanez was an
ex-General, and had been Chile's
last real military dictator, in the
late twenties.
General Strike
The Workers Confederation
called a general strike against the
Ibanez and the U.S.-inspired wage
reductions and swelling
unemployment rolls. At first
Ibanez did not disappoint his
advisers. He ordered the arrest of
the union leaders, and smashed
the strike.
But a year later, without
warning, violent street fighting
flared in Santiago. The immediate
cause: a rise in bus fares. The
underlying motivation: the
Chilean workers refused to accept

an economic policy initiated by,
and in the interests of, the Chilean
wealthy and the United States.
This and other political
upheavals proved too much for
ex-General Ibanez, and he refused
to call in his former
comrades-in-arms; the unions, the
Congress, the opposition reduced
the President-General to near
impotency. The U.S. economic
advisers left in disgust.
Close Election
Popular discontent in 1958
nearly resulted in the election of
Salvador Allende, but the
conservative, Jorge Allessandri,
beat him by a mere 30,000 votes.
Once again, the Right looked for a
tough policy, and president
Alessandri did try to salvage the
remains of the U.S.-inspired
economic doctrines. Wages were
lowered even further, foreign
loans, public and private, flowed
in, and a U.S.-styled suburb
blossomed on the outskirts of
Santiago.
But Alessandri, too, proved too
weak. The unions grew in
strength, the Congress was
meddlesome, and political
agitation increased. Some of his
supporters urged Alessandri to
resort to strong-armed rule as a
necessary prerequisite for "sound

economic management."
Jorge Allessandri came from an
old political family; indeed, his
father, Arturo, had been Chile's
greatest populist, the founding
force behind the nation's
Constitution, in effect since 1925,
and the initiator of much of
Chile's social legislation. In the
stormy depression years of the
19305, Alessandri's father had led
the "civilist" forces, which, while
in favor of restoring order, had
opposed military rule.
Sympathetic To U.S.
In his mind, Alessandri [the
younger] believed in the
economics of the U.S. advisers, of
attracting foreign capital by
lowering Chilean workers' wages;
but he hadn't the heart to resort
to the militaristic tactics necessary
to implement them.
Strikes increased under
Alessandri's government, and
political agitation reached new
heights. Alessandri fought the
unions, and many strikes were
smashed by the para-military
police, whose greater efficiency
was a product of emergency
injections of U.S. military and
"public safety" aid.
But President Alessandri
refused to brush aside the 1925
Constitution, was unwilling to

dismantle a system of civil
liberties and social conquests that
Chilean society had constructed
over a period of two generations.
By the end of Alessandri's
term, in 1964, the demand for
reform was so intense that the
conservative nominee candidacy
collapsed; the Rightists rushed to
vote for the lesser of the two evils,
the Christian Democrat, Eduardo
Frei, although Frei, like his only
opponent, Salvador Allende, was
promising the people a
thorough-going social revolution,
distinguished from Allende's only
in that it would be a "revolution
in liberty."

Ibanez, would display the
necessary force; Ibanez was an
ex-General, and had been Chile's
last real military dictator, in the
late twenties.
General Strike
The Workers Confederation
called a general strike against the
Ibanez and the U.S.-inspired wage
reductions and swelling
unemployment rolls. At first
Ibanez did not disappoint his
advisers. He ordered the arrest of
the union leaders, and smashed
the strike.
But a year later, without
warning, violent street fighting
flared in Santiago. The immediate
cause: a rise in bus fares. The
underlying motivation: the
Chilean workers refused to accept

an economic policy initiated by,
and in the interests of, the Chilean
wealthy and the United States.
This and other political
upheavals proved too much for
ex-General Ibanez, and he refused
to call in his former
comrades-in-arms; the unions, the
Congress, the opposition reduced
the President-General to near
impotency. The U.S. economic
advisers left in disgust.
Close Election
Popular discontent in 1958
nearly resulted in the election of
Salvador Allende, but the
conservative, Jorge Allessandri,
beat him by a mere 30,000 votes.
Once again, the Right looked for a
tough policy, and president
Alessandri did try to salvage the
remains of the U.S.-inspired
economic doctrines. Wages were
lowered even further, foreign
loans, public and private, flowed
in, and a U.S.-styled suburb
blossomed on the outskirts of
Santiago.
But Alessandri, too, proved too
weak. The unions grew in
strength, the Congress was
meddlesome, and political
agitation increased. Some of his
supporters urged Alessandri to
resort to strong-armed rule as a
necessary prerequisite for "sound

economic management."
Jorge Allessandri came from an
old political family; indeed, his
father, Arturo, had been Chile's
greatest populist, the founding
force behind the nation's
Constitution, in effect since 1925,
and the initiator of much of
Chile's social legislation. In the
stormy depression years of the
19305, Alessandri's father had led
the "civilist" forces, which, while
in favor of restoring order, had
opposed military rule.
Sympathetic To U.S.
In his mind, Alessandri [the
younger] believed in the
economics of the U.S. advisers, of
attracting foreign capital by
lowering Chilean workers' wages;
but he hadn't the heart to resort
to the militaristic tactics necessary
to implement them.
Strikes increased under
Alessandri's government, and
political agitation reached new
heights. Alessandri fought the
unions, and many strikes were
smashed by the para-military
police, whose greater efficiency
was a product of emergency
injections of U.S. military and
"public safety" aid.
But President Alessandri
refused to brush aside the 1925
Constitution, was unwilling to

liberties and social conquests that
Chilean society had constructed

By the end of Alessandri's
term, in 1964, the demand for
reform was so intense that the
conservative nominee candidacy
collapsed; the Rightists rushed to
vote for the lesser of the two evils,

opponent, Salvador Allende, was
promising the people a
thorough-going social revolution,

"General Gonzales says
economic plans are being worked
out by a group of U.S.-trained
economists with outstanding
technical and scientific
abilities. . . . The economists
advocate exposing the economy
to free makets and open
competition. ..."
—The Wall Street Journal
Oct. 4, 1973
Over the bodies of some
15,000 dead Chilean workers, the
Junta has succeeded in turning the
clock back to 1955. In that year,
President Carlos Ibanez also
invited a team of U.S. economic
"experts" to reorganize an ailing
economy.
Then, as now, the "experts' "
recommendations were easily
predictable: lower workers' wages,
honor the "efficiency" of U.S.
copper companies, allow free
entry of foreign capital, loosen
the "market" from government
constraints. . . .
But then, unlike now, the
"experts" did not have sufficient
firepower mobilized to back up
their "scientific" proposals.
In 1955, the Chilean
government was constrained by
strong democratic institutions.
The Congress, the unions, the
political parties, expressions of
the conflicting sectors of society,
were able to dilute
"tough-minded" policies.
Nevertheless, the U.S. advisers
had cause, in 1955, for hoping
that the then President, Carlos
Ibanez, would display the
necessary force; Ibanez was an
ex-General, and had been Chile's
last real military dictator, in the
late twenties.
