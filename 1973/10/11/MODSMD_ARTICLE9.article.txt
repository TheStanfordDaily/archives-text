# The 						Double Standard
## Time Out For Writing Those Letters 
### 
Somewhere in the world (the
outside one) there are
undoubtedly thousands of people
(would you believe one?) to
whom you owe a letter.
Unfortunately, for mast people
writing letters is about as much
fun as eating dorm food, taking
finals, or counting the tiles on the
roof of the Quad. For those poor
souls, then, this column is being
written. Henceforthwith are two
(2) prefabricated letters of varying
content.
One allows you to sound
scholarly, erudite, and
educationable to parents,
potential employers, law schools
you like, and your dear Aunt
Martha in Topeka (the one with

all the money). The other
correspondance is to be sent to
those with whom you want to
stress the wilder side of life at
Stanford. Thus you can
communicate to people either side
of your split personality, be it
either fact, fiction, animal,
vegetable or mineral. The second
letter is best received by friends
who really know you, past
employers, graduate schools you
don't like, and your fourth grade
teacher who said you'd never
amount to ANYTHING. Do not
send it to Aunt Martha.
In order to get things rolling all
you have to do is fill in a blank or
two with the fitting person, place,
or thing, cut along the dotted line,
scrounge up an envelope and
stamp, and you're all set. Let the
music begin:
Dear ,
I'm writting this letter during
my study break at the
Undergraduate Library. They say
it's a nice building, but I've got so
many books piled up around me
that I can't really see much of the
place at all. I would have written
9ooner, but things have been quite
hectic getting courses organized
and all. I've already had to read
five books!
Boy, I thought I had to work
hard last year, well last year was
EASY compared to this quarter so
Car. Right now I'm carrying 18
units. I don't know if I'll be able
to make it through the quarter
with all of them, but I'll give it
the old college try.
From what I understand the
weather has been quite sunny
down here, but I can't really say
for sure because I rarely go
outside. It may not be an easy life
here, but it's a worthwhile one. I
really feel like I'm learning how to
think.
A week from Saturday is a big
football game, but I don't think
I'll be going. The library opens at
8:00, and I'm sure I'll have
enough studying to keep me busy
for the whole day.
I hope you're not getting the
idea that I'm not having much of
a social life here at Stanford. Why
just the other day I met a great
in the library, and
before I knew it. we were having a

fantastic discussion on Dalton's
Law of Partial Pressures, and the
Nature of Gas. Later on I found
out that only had a
3.79 grad average, so I don't think
I'll lower mysel f to
again. Oh well, you can't win
them all.
In closing, I would like to leave
you with an inspirational quote
from a book I'm reading: "A
slight rotation of the lowest
dumbell constitutes a torsional
displacement which will be
propagated up the medium with a
finite speed." (College Physics,
Sears and Zemansky, London,
England, 1960, p. 400).
Power to the
Protestant Ethic,
Dear ,
Please excuse the beer stains on
the letter but I'm writing this
from a pub near school. I've got
so many pitchers stacked up all
around me I really don't know
which tavem this is. I would have
written sooner but I've been
partying down here at school for
so long that I haven't been sober
enough to raise a glass, let alone
write a letter.
Boy, I thought I had it EASY
last year, but this year will be NO
PROBLEM because I found some
great mick classes. In fact in all
three classes I have papers I've
used before and will try to recycle
them. I don't know if I'll be able
to make it through the quarter
with all of them, but I'll give it
the old college try.

From what I understand the
professors here at Stanford are
quite good, but I really can't say
for sure since I rarely go to class.
It may not be a worthwhile life,
but it's an easy one. I really feel
like I'm learning to drink.
A week from Saturday there's
a big football game, but I don't
know if I'll be going. Some friends
are having a party and a keg which
opens at 8:00 a.m. I plan to have
enough beer to wipe me out for
the whole day.
I hope you're not getting the
idea that I'm not having much of
an educational life here at
Stanford. Why just the other day I
met a great at a tavern
who started taling about Dalton's
Law of Partial Pressures and the
Nature of Gas. I went to get
an Alka Seltzer,
only to find out I really didn't
understand anything which
had said. Later I
found out I had been talking to a
physics major. Oh well, you can't
win them all.
In closing, I would like to leave
you with an inspirational quote
from a book I'm reading, but I
went through Drink Your Way to
A Better Sex Life and couldn't
find anything quotable. So I will
leave you on this note: "You can
pick your friends, and you can
pick your nose, but you can't pick
your friend's nose."
Pour Beer Slowly,
the Head You Save
May be Your Own...
