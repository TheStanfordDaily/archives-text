"THE HARDER THEY COME is an excitingly violent, deeply appealing picture; it is also a dis
turbing study of a post-colonial society in ruins. Exploitation is the ugly side of beautiful Jamaica."

I remember on the slave ship, how they brutalized my soul
Slave driver, the tables have turned
Catch-a-fire, you're gonna get burned ....

"THE HARDER THEY COME is an excitingly violent, deeply appealing picture; it is also a dis
turbing study of a post-colonial society in ruins. Exploitation is the ugly side of beautiful Jamaica."
—The Nation
Every time I hear the crack of a whip, my blood runs cold,
I remember on the slave ship, how they brutalized my soul
Slave driver, the tables have turned
Catch-a-fire, you're gonna get burned ....
