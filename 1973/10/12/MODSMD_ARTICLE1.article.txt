# New Nixon VP Pick Due Soon?
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Nixon believes he has a free hand in
choosing a new vice president and
need not confine himself to selecting a
"caretaker" without 1976 presidential
ambitions, White House sources
reported yesterday.
They said Nixon hopes to nominate
a successor to Spiro T. Agnew within
the next few days and perhaps by the
end of the week.
The selection process got underway
in earnest yesterday — less than 24
hours after Agnew resigned as vice
president and pleaded no contest to a
tax evasion charge.
Under the 25th amendment to the
Constitution, ratified in 1967, Nixon's
nominee must win majority approval
from the Democratic-controled
Senate and House. That provision has
prompted some Congress members to
suggest they should be the President's
partners in naming a new vice
president.
One Nixon associate emphasized
the President feels he can act "without
parameters" of any kind and is seeking
a "strong man" he would regard as
well-qualified to take over the
presidency in the event of Nixon's
death or disability.

Secretary Gerald L. Warren was asked
if Nixon would forego choosing a
nominee who might prove a strong
contender for the 1976 GOP
presidential nomination, a limitation
urged upon the President by many
Democrats in Congress.
"I would not limit the President's
options in seeking a successor,"
Warren replied, underscoring the
description of Nixon's attitude as
described by other associates.
The President's distaste for
selecting a caretaker candidate came
soon after the reporting of a strong
undercurrent of bipartisan opposition
to John B. Connally, who is regarded
as a leading potential contender for
the 1976 GOP nomination. One
congressional source made a flat
prediction that a Connally nomination
would be rejected by the Senate.
Connally Possible
As described by associates, Nixon's
approach to the search for an Agnew
successor would be wholly consistent
with making Connally his final choice.
The former Democratic governor of
Texas who became a Republican in
May is the only man Nixon has twice
lauded publicly as eminently qualified
to be president.
Nixon, in finding a replacement for
Agnew, had called on Republican
members of Congress, governors and
state party officials to submit
suggested names by the end of the
day. Lists of potential candidates were
being coordinated by Nixon's
assistant, Rose Mary Woods.
Nearly all of the 150-member
Republican National Committee also
had telegrammed their choices, GOP
Chairman George Bush said.
Congressional leaders continued
trying to work out a procedure to act
on Nixon's choice. Senate Majority
Leader Mike Mansfield said senators
favor joint hearings with the House on
a successor to Agnew. Mansfield told
newsmen that House Speaker Carl
Albert "seemed to approva" but
wanted more time to discuss the idea.
In early evening, Nixon flew to
Camp David in Maryland's Catoctin
Mountains to ponder his choice. The
White House, which said his plans for a
return to Washington were not known,
reported that neither aides nor family
members accompanied the President
to the rustic retreat.
At the Justice Department, Atty.
Gen. Elliot L. Richardson told a
televised news conference the White
House played an important role in the
negotiations that led to Agnew's
resignation and his acceptance of a tax
evasion charge.
Richardson disclosed that special
White House counsel J. Fred Buzhardt
was the first to approach him about
possible "plea bargaining" in the case.
The attorney general said Buzhardt,
however, "did not indicate that he was
acting at the President's behest" and
that he had played a role as a
go-between for Agnew's lawyers and
the Justice Department.

with making Connally his final choice.
The former Democratic governor of
Texas who became a Republican in
May is the only man Nixon has twice
lauded publicly as eminently qualified
to be president.
Nixon, in finding a replacement for
Agnew, had called on Republican
members of Congress, governors and
state party officials to submit
suggested names by the end of the
day. Lists of potential candidates were
being coordinated by Nixon's
assistant, Rose Mary Woods.
Nearly all of the 150-member
Republican National Committee also
had telegrammed their choices, GOP
Chairman George Bush said.
Congressional leaders continued
trying to work out a procedure to act
on Nixon's choice. Senate Majority
Leader Mike Mansfield said senators
favor joint hearings with the House on
a successor to Agnew. Mansfield told
newsmen that House Speaker Carl
Albert "seemed to approva" but
wanted more time to discuss the idea.
In early evening, Nixon flew to
Camp David in Maryland's Catoctin
Mountains to ponder his choice. The
White House, which said his plans for a
return to Washington were not known,
reported that neither aides nor family
members accompanied the President
to the rustic retreat.
At the Justice Department, Atty.
Gen. Elliot L. Richardson told a
televised news conference the White
House played an important role in the
negotiations that led to Agnew's
resignation and his acceptance of a tax
evasion charge.
Richardson disclosed that special
White House counsel J. Fred Buzhardt
was the first to approach him about
possible "plea bargaining" in the case.
The attorney general said Buzhardt,
however, "did not indicate that he was
acting at the President's behest" and
that he had played a role as a
go-between for Agnew's lawyers and
the Justice Department.
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Nixon believes he has a free hand in
choosing a new vice president and
need not confine himself to selecting a
"caretaker" without 1976 presidential
ambitions, White House sources
reported yesterday.
They said Nixon hopes to nominate
a successor to Spiro T. Agnew within
the next few days and perhaps by the
end of the week.
The selection process got underway
in earnest yesterday — less than 24
hours after Agnew resigned as vice
president and pleaded no contest to a
tax evasion charge.
Under the 25th amendment to the
Constitution, ratified in 1967, Nixon's
nominee must win majority approval
from the Democratic-controled
Senate and House. That provision has
prompted some Congress members to
suggest they should be the President's
partners in naming a new vice
president.
One Nixon associate emphasized
the President feels he can act "without
parameters" of any kind and is seeking
a "strong man" he would regard as
well-qualified to take over the
presidency in the event of Nixon's
death or disability.

Deputy White House Press
Secretary Gerald L. Warren was asked
if Nixon would forego choosing a
nominee who might prove a strong
contender for the 1976 GOP
presidential nomination, a limitation
urged upon the President by many
Democrats in Congress.
"I would not limit the President's
options in seeking a successor,"
Warren replied, underscoring the
description of Nixon's attitude as
described by other associates.
The President's distaste for
selecting a caretaker candidate came
soon after the reporting of a strong
undercurrent of bipartisan opposition
to John B. Connally, who is regarded
as a leading potential contender for
the 1976 GOP nomination. One
congressional source made a flat
prediction that a Connally nomination
would be rejected by the Senate.
Connally Possible
As described by associates, Nixon's
approach to the search for an Agnew
successor would be wholly consistent
with making Connally his final choice.
