death or disability.

description of Nixon's attitude as
described by other associates.
The President's distaste for
selecting a caretaker candidate came
soon after the reporting of a strong
undercurrent of bipartisan opposition
to John B. Connally, who is regarded
as a leading potential contender for
the 1976 GOP nomination. One
congressional source made a flat
