# Innocent Years Are Over
## Chile Suffers From U.S. Intervention

Frei sought to attract foreign
capital and raise the living
standards of the Chilean workers
and peasants. We can now see the
impossibility of such a
contradictory policy; but 1964
was in the hey-day of the Alliance
for Progress, of support for
democratic governments capable
of liberal reforms and economic
progress. Those were the years of
fear of Castroism — but of official
distaste for right-wing military
regimes. Years of innocence.
While U.S. business found Frei
distasteful, Chilean capitalists
squirmed under new government
regulations, and even ownership,
of major enterprises. Frei felt the
Chilean business community to be
lacking in sufficient initiative and
vigor; he relied on the State
(together with foreign interests)
to construct new industries, to
restore dynamism to the long
stagnant economy.
Chilean capitalists complained
of State intervention, but of
paramount concern was the
ever-rising level of political
awareness. Frei's Christian
Democrats preached social
equality and economic justice,
and even if their demogogy rarely
was concretized into deeds, it was
unglueing respect for traditional
values and structures.
Agrarian Reform
Especially disconcerting was
the agrarian reform, which
directly undermined respect for
private property — even if its
ultimate aim was to prevent much
more drastic peasant revolution.
Towards the end of his term,
Frei began to retreat from his
more radical policies. The Right
pressured him into resorting to
direct repression to halt the
mounting political agitation; but
the glue had come undone, and
strikes, land seizures, and other
forms of worker, peasant and
student mobilization continued.
Election
In the 1970 presidential
elections, the Right viciously
attacked the Christian Democrats.
Its candidate promised a return to
"sanitary" economics, to a "freer
market," more "responsive" to
foreign capital and competition.
Private property must be
respected, and the dangerous
"politicization" halted. The
specter of a Counter Reformation
haunted the campaign.
The Right knew that most
Chileans opposed such policies, so
they ran Alessandri the Younger,
now aged and ailing, hoping that
his personal popularity, derived
from the image of his populist
father, would carry the day.
All essa ndri's campaign
managers played military music to
accompany his radio ads, and
U.S.-made films displayed the
Chilean navy and air force to
theater audiences. But the Chilean
people, in the ballot box, rejected
this solution to their economic
problems.
Allende's major goal was to
break free of U.S. economic
domination, and while the process
was proving painful, it was
succeeding.
Allende had hoped that many
Chilean capitalists would support,
or at least not violently oppose
him, in his fight for national
independence. He was wrong.
Evidently, they saw their interests
too tied to U.S. capital to risk
such a break. Allende sought to
compromise with them; they
sought only to overthrow him.
Under Allende, state
intervention in the economy,
coupled, as always in Chile, with
increasing worker mobilization
and political agitation, advanced
rapidly.
The zeal of the Allende Left
had the effect, predicted by some.

ofcompleting the fascitization of
the Right, a process set in motion
by the Frei reforms. Fatally, the
strong advances made by the
Allendista workers and peasants
frightened the middle classes into
accepting, at least temporarily, an
extreme right-wing position.
The military coup has given
U.S. economic expertise an
opportunity to try again. But this
time, no disappointing Ibanez, no

scrupulous Alessandri, no
contradictory Frei, will stand in
the way. Nor will the Congress,
unions, or political parties be
present to upset the "free"
market and foreign capital flows.
What bitter irony, that the
reforms of the Frei and Allende
periods inadvertently created the
precondition necessary for the
U.S. experts' economic policy:
the destruction of Chilean

democracy. The experts and their
General-employers will not be
molested by legal niceties,
"inefficient" politicians, or "soft"
Presidents. In Chile, as elsewhere,
the "free" market and military
dictatorship will walk hand in
hand, in perfect marriage.

Frei sought to attract foreign
capital and raise the living
standards of the Chilean workers
and peasants. We can now see the
impossibility of such a
contradictory policy; but 1964
was in the hey-day of the Alliance
for Progress, of support for
democratic governments capable
of liberal reforms and economic
progress. Those were the years of
fear of Castroism — but of official
distaste for right-wing military
regimes. Years of innocence.
While U.S. business found Frei
distasteful, Chilean capitalists
squirmed under new government
regulations, and even ownership,
of major enterprises. Frei felt the
Chilean business community to be
lacking in sufficient initiative and
vigor; he relied on the State
(together with foreign interests)
to construct new industries, to
restore dynamism to the long
stagnant economy.
Chilean capitalists complained
of State intervention, but of
paramount concern was the
ever-rising level of political
awareness. Frei's Christian
Democrats preached social
equality and economic justice,
and even if their demogogy rarely
was concretized into deeds, it was
unglueing respect for traditional
values and structures.
Agrarian Reform
Especially disconcerting was
the agrarian reform, which
directly undermined respect for
private property — even if its
ultimate aim was to prevent much
more drastic peasant revolution.
Towards the end of his term,
Frei began to retreat from his
more radical policies. The Right
pressured him into resorting to
direct repression to halt the
mounting political agitation; but
the glue had come undone, and
strikes, land seizures, and other
forms of worker, peasant and
student mobilization continued.
Election
In the 1970 presidential
elections, the Right viciously
attacked the Christian Democrats.
Its candidate promised a return to
"sanitary" economics, to a "freer
market," more "responsive" to
foreign capital and competition.
Private property must be
respected, and the dangerous
"politicization" halted. The
specter of a Counter Reformation
haunted the campaign.
The Right knew that most
Chileans opposed such policies, so
they ran Alessandri the Younger,
now aged and ailing, hoping that
his personal popularity, derived
from the image of his populist
father, would carry the day.
All essa ndri's campaign
managers played military music to
accompany his radio ads, and
U.S.-made films displayed the
Chilean navy and air force to
theater audiences. But the Chilean
people, in the ballot box, rejected
this solution to their economic
problems.
Allende's major goal was to
break free of U.S. economic
domination, and while the process
was proving painful, it was
succeeding.
Allende had hoped that many
Chilean capitalists would support,
or at least not violently oppose
him, in his fight for national
independence. He was wrong.
Evidently, they saw their interests
too tied to U.S. capital to risk
such a break. Allende sought to
compromise with them; they
sought only to overthrow him.
Under Allende, state
intervention in the economy,
coupled, as always in Chile, with
increasing worker mobilization
and political agitation, advanced
rapidly.
The zeal of the Allende Left
had the effect, predicted by some.

ofcompleting the fascitization of
the Right, a process set in motion
by the Frei reforms. Fatally, the
strong advances made by the
Allendista workers and peasants
frightened the middle classes into
accepting, at least temporarily, an
extreme right-wing position.
The military coup has given
U.S. economic expertise an
opportunity to try again. But this
time, no disappointing Ibanez, no

scrupulous Alessandri, no
contradictory Frei, will stand in
the way. Nor will the Congress,
unions, or political parties be
present to upset the "free"
market and foreign capital flows.
What bitter irony, that the
reforms of the Frei and Allende
periods inadvertently created the
precondition necessary for the
U.S. experts' economic policy:
the destruction of Chilean

democracy. The experts and their
General-employers will not be
molested by legal niceties,
"inefficient" politicians, or "soft"
Presidents. In Chile, as elsewhere,
the "free" market and military
dictatorship will walk hand in
hand, in perfect marriage.
