# Little Opposition To Military Rule
## Citizens Support Overthrow 
### 
Bob Ottilie

Monday morning, the students of Stanford were
greeted with the news that October 8 through 14
had been declared the International Week of
Solidarity With Chile. We were told to write letters
to show our solidarity with the Chilean people. It is
for that purpose, that I have chosen to speak out in
favor of the coup d'etat and the elimination of the
Marxist regime. The best conclusions I have been
able to draw from the Chilean situation are that the
military overthrow has the support of the people in
their attempt to maintain democracy in their
nation.
Yet for three weeks, our student controlled
newspaper has printed countless articles opposing
the junta. They base their convictions on the
preservation of democracy and have a tendency to
play on the reader's emotion rather than explain
real motives for opposing the takeover.
No articles have begun to approach a vital
question in any discussion of the crisis. That is,
"What caused the downfall of a popularly elected
government, and why was it met with so little
opposition from the Chilean people?" It is to these
most basic questions that I plan to direct some
answers. Hopefully in the future, more of the
"why" can be supplied by the liberal factions that
write for this paper.
Allende and his Marxist regime came to power
because of the worsening economic situation. Under
production was one of the central problems. Yet,
under Allende, production steadily dropped.
Allende encouraged rebellions and takeovers of
the factories. When the workers found that they
would not reap all the profits from the factories
that they had taken control of, they slowed their
production rate and went on strike. This is a
significant fact when you consider that most of
Allende's support came from the working class.
Allende attempted to give some of the farms to
the peasants and workers. They were given all the
machinery and financial aid necessary to increase
production. With no one to tell them what to do,
their working hours decreased and production
dropped. Much of what was produced was sold on
the Black Market. The situation reached the point
where 35 percent of the Chilean import capacity
was going for food which could have been produced
locally.
The people with the money to invest, and thus
stimulate the economy, held their funds back. They
obviously feared nationalization of investments they
might make.
Allende put communists in charge of hospitals
and health care and the quality of Chilean medical
care decreased.
Allende attempted to nationalize the
transportation system and was met with
overwhelming protest. Transportation workers went
on strike as did shopkeepers, housewives, lawyers
and doctors.
Allende tried to nationalize the farms under
authority of the Agrarian Reform Law. Although
landowners many times tried to cooperate with the
government, they were met with lies, nonpayment

and a government that took more land than the law
provided for.
Inflation may have been Allende's greatest
problem. It went from a rate of 14 percent in 1971,
to 100 percent in 1972, to a record 235 percent in
1973.
This is not enough though, to substantiate the
coup and temporary abandonment of democracy. I
would just as soon have seen Allende, and thus the
political philosophy he stood for, defeated at the
polls. It would have served as an excellent example
to other nations who think that communism may be
the answer to their economic woes. But we must ask
ourselves, "Would the Left have let the democracy
last until the next election?" The military claimed
that they had moved only to prevent a more violent
coup by the Left. Many facts seem to back this up.
Although Allende wanted to make communion
work within a democracy, his followers were sure it
could not. In March, 1972, the Central Committee
let it be known, that they regretted that the
revolutionary process had slowed down and that the
time might soon come when the working class
would have to take "revolutionary and armed
action." This year, workers in 45 factories that they
had taken control of, were forming combat squads
behind locked gates. Add to this the thousands of
aliens that Allende had granted political asylum to.
Much of his support was coming from these
"foreign elements," many of whom were arrested
with stockpiles of Soviet weapons in their
possession as the coup materialized.
It was with all this in mind that the people of
Chile rose up in revolt. If the Chileans were so
opposed to the military taking over, where was this
opposition? And why was it that tens of thousands
of Chileans, that had been on strike, went back to
work immediately? In fact, the only real opposition
was a few snipers, and life surprisingly, returned to
normal quickly.
In order to save their nation and preserve
democracy, the miliary saw that action was needed.
They proclaim that they "will keep the status quo
for some time, and then grant more liberty." The
majority of the people seem to accept this or at
least feel that there is more hope with the new
government than there was with Allende's failing
policies.
I find it almost comical, if not hypocritical, that
the political Left in this country, wants to become
so involved in a problem that is truly one for the
people of Chile to solve. It was just a few short
years ago, that these same individuals sought to end
U.S. intervention in Vietnam on the grounds that
that conflict was one that the people of Vietnam
should solve.
In viewing the concern and consequent actions of
these individuals, we should look at their motives.
Are they truly interested in preserving democracy,
or are their efforts more concerned with advancing
the cause of socialism and communism? This is the
most important role we can play during the week of
October 8 through 14.

with stockpiles of Soviet weapons in their
possession as the coup materialized.
It was with all this in mind that the people of
Chile rose up in revolt. If the Chileans were so
opposed to the military taking over, where was this
opposition? And why was it that tens of thousands
of Chileans, that had been on strike, went back to
work immediately? In fact, the only real opposition
was a few snipers, and life surprisingly, returned to
normal quickly.
In order to save their nation and preserve
democracy, the miliary saw that action was needed.
They proclaim that they "will keep the status quo
for some time, and then grant more liberty." The
majority of the people seem to accept this or at

government than there was with Allende's failing
policies.
I find it almost comical, if not hypocritical, that
the political Left in this country, wants to become
so involved in a problem that is truly one for the
people of Chile to solve. It was just a few short
years ago, that these same individuals sought to end
U.S. intervention in Vietnam on the grounds that
that conflict was one that the people of Vietnam
should solve.
In viewing the concern and consequent actions of
these individuals, we should look at their motives.
Are they truly interested in preserving democracy,
or are their efforts more concerned with advancing
the cause of socialism and communism? This is the
most important role we can play during the week of
October 8 through 14.

"It's a great game — something to look forward to in retirement
Bob Ottilie

Monday morning, the students of Stanford were
greeted with the news that October 8 through 14
had been declared the International Week of
Solidarity With Chile. We were told to write letters
to show our solidarity with the Chilean people. It is
for that purpose, that I have chosen to speak out in
favor of the coup d'etat and the elimination of the
Marxist regime. The best conclusions I have been
able to draw from the Chilean situation are that the
military overthrow has the support of the people in
their attempt to maintain democracy in their
nation.
Yet for three weeks, our student controlled
newspaper has printed countless articles opposing
the junta. They base their convictions on the
preservation of democracy and have a tendency to
play on the reader's emotion rather than explain
real motives for opposing the takeover.
No articles have begun to approach a vital
question in any discussion of the crisis. That is,
"What caused the downfall of a popularly elected
government, and why was it met with so little
opposition from the Chilean people?" It is to these
most basic questions that I plan to direct some
answers. Hopefully in the future, more of the
"why" can be supplied by the liberal factions that
write for this paper.
Allende and his Marxist regime came to power
because of the worsening economic situation. Under
production was one of the central problems. Yet,
under Allende, production steadily dropped.
Allende encouraged rebellions and takeovers of
the factories. When the workers found that they
would not reap all the profits from the factories
that they had taken control of, they slowed their
production rate and went on strike. This is a
significant fact when you consider that most of
Allende's support came from the working class.
Allende attempted to give some of the farms to
the peasants and workers. They were given all the
machinery and financial aid necessary to increase
production. With no one to tell them what to do,
their working hours decreased and production
dropped. Much of what was produced was sold on
the Black Market. The situation reached the point
where 35 percent of the Chilean import capacity
was going for food which could have been produced
locally.
The people with the money to invest, and thus
stimulate the economy, held their funds back. They
obviously feared nationalization of investments they
might make.
Allende put communists in charge of hospitals
and health care and the quality of Chilean medical
care decreased.
Allende attempted to nationalize the
transportation system and was met with
overwhelming protest. Transportation workers went
on strike as did shopkeepers, housewives, lawyers
and doctors.
Allende tried to nationalize the farms under
authority of the Agrarian Reform Law. Although
landowners many times tried to cooperate with the
government, they were met with lies, nonpayment

and a government that took more land than the law
provided for.
Inflation may have been Allende's greatest
problem. It went from a rate of 14 percent in 1971,
to 100 percent in 1972, to a record 235 percent in
1973.
This is not enough though, to substantiate the
coup and temporary abandonment of democracy. I
would just as soon have seen Allende, and thus the
political philosophy he stood for, defeated at the
polls. It would have served as an excellent example
to other nations who think that communism may be
the answer to their economic woes. But we must ask
ourselves, "Would the Left have let the democracy
last until the next election?" The military claimed
that they had moved only to prevent a more violent
coup by the Left. Many facts seem to back this up.
Although Allende wanted to make communion
work within a democracy, his followers were sure it
could not. In March, 1972, the Central Committee
let it be known, that they regretted that the
revolutionary process had slowed down and that the
time might soon come when the working class
would have to take "revolutionary and armed
action." This year, workers in 45 factories that they
had taken control of, were forming combat squads
behind locked gates. Add to this the thousands of
aliens that Allende had granted political asylum to.
Much of his support was coming from these
"foreign elements," many of whom were arrested
with stockpiles of Soviet weapons in their
possession as the coup materialized.

Allende tried to nationalize the farms under
authority of the Agrarian Reform Law. Although
landowners many times tried to cooperate with the
government, they were met with lies, nonpayment

and a government that took more land than the law
provided for.
Inflation may have been Allende's greatest
problem. It went from a rate of 14 percent in 1971,
to 100 percent in 1972, to a record 235 percent in
1973.
This is not enough though, to substantiate the
coup and temporary abandonment of democracy. I
would just as soon have seen Allende, and thus the
political philosophy he stood for, defeated at the
polls. It would have served as an excellent example
to other nations who think that communism may be
the answer to their economic woes. But we must ask
ourselves, "Would the Left have let the democracy
last until the next election?" The military claimed
that they had moved only to prevent a more violent
coup by the Left. Many facts seem to back this up.
Although Allende wanted to make communion
work within a democracy, his followers were sure it
could not. In March, 1972, the Central Committee
let it be known, that they regretted that the
revolutionary process had slowed down and that the
time might soon come when the working class
would have to take "revolutionary and armed
action." This year, workers in 45 factories that they
had taken control of, were forming combat squads
behind locked gates. Add to this the thousands of
aliens that Allende had granted political asylum to.
Much of his support was coming from these
"foreign elements," many of whom were arrested
with stockpiles of Soviet weapons in their
possession as the coup materialized.
It was with all this in mind that the people of
Chile rose up in revolt. If the Chileans were so
opposed to the military taking over, where was this
opposition? And why was it that tens of thousands
of Chileans, that had been on strike, went back to
work immediately? In fact, the only real opposition
was a few snipers, and life surprisingly, returned to
normal quickly.
In order to save their nation and preserve
democracy, the miliary saw that action was needed.
They proclaim that they "will keep the status quo
for some time, and then grant more liberty." The
majority of the people seem to accept this or at
least feel that there is more hope with the new
government than there was with Allende's failing
policies.
I find it almost comical, if not hypocritical, that
the political Left in this country, wants to become
so involved in a problem that is truly one for the
people of Chile to solve. It was just a few short
years ago, that these same individuals sought to end
U.S. intervention in Vietnam on the grounds that
that conflict was one that the people of Vietnam
should solve.
In viewing the concern and consequent actions of
these individuals, we should look at their motives.
Are they truly interested in preserving democracy,
or are their efforts more concerned with advancing
the cause of socialism and communism? This is the
most important role we can play during the week of
October 8 through 14.

"It's a great game — something to look forward to in retirement
Bob Ottilie

Monday morning, the students of Stanford were
greeted with the news that October 8 through 14
had been declared the International Week of
Solidarity With Chile. We were told to write letters
to show our solidarity with the Chilean people. It is
for that purpose, that I have chosen to speak out in
favor of the coup d'etat and the elimination of the
Marxist regime. The best conclusions I have been
able to draw from the Chilean situation are that the
military overthrow has the support of the people in
their attempt to maintain democracy in their
nation.
Yet for three weeks, our student controlled
newspaper has printed countless articles opposing
the junta. They base their convictions on the
preservation of democracy and have a tendency to
play on the reader's emotion rather than explain
real motives for opposing the takeover.
No articles have begun to approach a vital
question in any discussion of the crisis. That is,
"What caused the downfall of a popularly elected
government, and why was it met with so little
opposition from the Chilean people?" It is to these
most basic questions that I plan to direct some
answers. Hopefully in the future, more of the
"why" can be supplied by the liberal factions that
write for this paper.
Allende and his Marxist regime came to power
because of the worsening economic situation. Under
production was one of the central problems. Yet,
under Allende, production steadily dropped.
Allende encouraged rebellions and takeovers of
the factories. When the workers found that they
would not reap all the profits from the factories
that they had taken control of, they slowed their
production rate and went on strike. This is a
significant fact when you consider that most of
Allende's support came from the working class.
Allende attempted to give some of the farms to
the peasants and workers. They were given all the
machinery and financial aid necessary to increase
production. With no one to tell them what to do,
their working hours decreased and production
dropped. Much of what was produced was sold on
the Black Market. The situation reached the point
where 35 percent of the Chilean import capacity
was going for food which could have been produced
locally.
The people with the money to invest, and thus
stimulate the economy, held their funds back. They
obviously feared nationalization of investments they
might make.
Allende put communists in charge of hospitals
and health care and the quality of Chilean medical
care decreased.
Allende attempted to nationalize the
transportation system and was met with
overwhelming protest. Transportation workers went
on strike as did shopkeepers, housewives, lawyers
and doctors.

landowners many times tried to cooperate with the
