Most Stanford motorists are
familiar with the problem of
bicyclists not stopping at stop
signs. Many bicyclists are familiar
with the problems they confront
when they do come to a complete
stop: motorists are often too
impatient to wait while they
remount their bicycles and
wobble across the intersection.
Instead, the motorist may act
as though the bicyclist weren't
there and "steal" the right-of-way
which the cyclist has properly
been waiting for. (I've sometimes
waited at a four-way-stop while
several cars rushed through,
without allowing enough time
between them for me to push off
and get my bicycle moving.)
Furthermore, some bicyclists feel
that a complete stop imposes on
them more than it imposes on a
motorist. It's as if the motorist
were required to turn off his
engine and step out of his car at
each intersection.
I'd like to see a truce between
these two groups: Motorists: if a
bicyclist was already waiting at an
intersection when you arrive,
please give him the extra time he
needs to get moving again.
Bicyclists: Please wait your tum
at stop signs. It is one thing to zip
through a stop sign at 9 a.m. on
Sunday morning when no other
traffic is on the road, and quite
another to rush madly through a
four-way-stop at rush hour.
I suggest coming very nearly to
a complete stop — you can avoid
losing your balance by inching
forward at a speed less than
several feet per minute. You
probably won't have lost your
balance by the time it's your turn
to cross the intersection unless
your drifting forward threatens to
carry you into the intersection
too soon (in which case you
probably didn't slow down
enough soon enough) or unless
the other traffic (motorists and
bicyclists both) is too rude to
yield the right-of-way to you
when your turn comes. Not losing
your balance means its much less
hassle to get back up to speed.
Obviously these same
courtesies can be applied to
interactions between bicyclists
and pedestrians.

Mr. Evers' argument for the
destruction of Israel (Daily Oct.
10, p. 2) rests on shaky ground.
He forgets that Israel is a nation
with a historical basis in that
exact area (Palestine), and that
the Jews underwent forced
evacuation from Palestine
centuries before the Arabs ever
decided to settle the land.
If, therefore, we follow Mr.
Evers' argument that prior
ownership determines the right to
the land of the nation in question,
then that right belongs to the
Jews, who make up the majority
of the citizens of Israel. Mr. Evers'
argument can be altered to serve
any viewpoint, depending upon
how much history he chooses to
ignore. Ownership of land is not
the determinant in war guilt, but
the intention to kill is, and this is
shared by both sides in any war.

Mr. Evers Replies: The
investigation of the legitimacy of
a land title centers on evidence.
Of course, any person (whether
Arab or Jew), who can prove that
he is the heir of some individual
who in the past had a specific
piece of land stolen from him, is
entitled to that piece of land.
Stop Prejudging!

In recent months the Stanford
Daily has been known for a few
blunders which tended to alienate
the Stanford Jewish Community.
However, this most recent outrage
which the Daily has seen fit to
splash over its front page is at best
non-committal, at worst openly
anti-Israeli, hence anti-Semitic.
The headlines on the front
page of the editions of Monday,
Oct. 8 and Tuesday, Oct. 9
definitely point to the
one-sidedness of the Daily's
position. On Monday the headline
accused Israel of attacking the
Arabs. Such an accusation is
ludicrous for a number of reasons.
First, it has been stated by
U.N. observers that the Arabs
started the hostilities. Second, it
would take days of planning to
launch an attack such as the
Egyptians did. And third, it would
be sheer madness for the Israelis
to attack on Yom Kippur, a day
when most Israelis were either in
synagogue or at home with their
families.
In your article of Tuesday,
Oct. 9 you took a "sampling" of
opinion on the conflict. Your
omission of any strong pro-Israeli
views was only less obvious that
your concentration on pro-Arab
sources. The Jews at Stanford will
not stay silent, Israel must live!
And the Stanford Daily must stop
its prejudice!

In recent months the Stanford
Daily has been known for a few
blunders which tended to alienate
the Stanford Jewish Community.
However, this most recent outrage
which the Daily has seen fit to
splash over its front page is at best
non-committal, at worst openly
anti-Israeli, hence anti-Semitic.
The headlines on the front
page of the editions of Monday,
Oct. 8 and Tuesday, Oct. 9
definitely point to the
one-sidedness of the Daily's
position. On Monday the headline
accused Israel of attacking the
Arabs. Such an accusation is
ludicrous for a number of reasons.
First, it has been stated by
U.N. observers that the Arabs
started the hostilities. Second, it
would take days of planning to
launch an attack such as the
Egyptians did. And third, it would
be sheer madness for the Israelis
to attack on Yom Kippur, a day
when most Israelis were either in
synagogue or at home with their
families.
In your article of Tuesday,
Oct. 9 you took a "sampling" of
opinion on the conflict. Your
omission of any strong pro-Israeli
views was only less obvious that
your concentration on pro-Arab
sources. The Jews at Stanford will
not stay silent, Israel must live!
And the Stanford Daily must stop
its prejudice!

Most Stanford motorists are
familiar with the problem of
bicyclists not stopping at stop
signs. Many bicyclists are familiar
with the problems they confront
when they do come to a complete
stop: motorists are often too
impatient to wait while they
remount their bicycles and
wobble across the intersection.
Instead, the motorist may act
as though the bicyclist weren't
there and "steal" the right-of-way
which the cyclist has properly
been waiting for. (I've sometimes
waited at a four-way-stop while
several cars rushed through,
without allowing enough time
between them for me to push off
and get my bicycle moving.)
Furthermore, some bicyclists feel
that a complete stop imposes on
them more than it imposes on a
motorist. It's as if the motorist
were required to turn off his
engine and step out of his car at
each intersection.
I'd like to see a truce between
these two groups: Motorists: if a
bicyclist was already waiting at an
intersection when you arrive,
please give him the extra time he
needs to get moving again.
Bicyclists: Please wait your tum
at stop signs. It is one thing to zip
through a stop sign at 9 a.m. on
Sunday morning when no other
traffic is on the road, and quite
another to rush madly through a
four-way-stop at rush hour.
I suggest coming very nearly to
a complete stop — you can avoid
losing your balance by inching
forward at a speed less than
several feet per minute. You
probably won't have lost your
balance by the time it's your turn
to cross the intersection unless
your drifting forward threatens to
carry you into the intersection
too soon (in which case you
probably didn't slow down
enough soon enough) or unless
the other traffic (motorists and
bicyclists both) is too rude to
yield the right-of-way to you
when your turn comes. Not losing
your balance means its much less
hassle to get back up to speed.
Obviously these same
courtesies can be applied to
interactions between bicyclists
and pedestrians.

Mr. Evers' argument for the
destruction of Israel (Daily Oct.
10, p. 2) rests on shaky ground.
He forgets that Israel is a nation
with a historical basis in that
exact area (Palestine), and that
the Jews underwent forced
evacuation from Palestine
centuries before the Arabs ever
decided to settle the land.
If, therefore, we follow Mr.
Evers' argument that prior
ownership determines the right to
the land of the nation in question,
then that right belongs to the
Jews, who make up the majority
of the citizens of Israel. Mr. Evers'
argument can be altered to serve
any viewpoint, depending upon
how much history he chooses to
ignore. Ownership of land is not
the determinant in war guilt, but
the intention to kill is, and this is
shared by both sides in any war.

forward at a speed less than
several feet per minute. You
probably won't have lost your
balance by the time it's your turn
to cross the intersection unless
your drifting forward threatens to
carry you into the intersection
too soon (in which case you
probably didn't slow down
enough soon enough) or unless
the other traffic (motorists and
bicyclists both) is too rude to
yield the right-of-way to you
when your turn comes. Not losing
your balance means its much less
hassle to get back up to speed.
Obviously these same
courtesies can be applied to
interactions between bicyclists
and pedestrians.

Mr. Evers' argument for the
destruction of Israel (Daily Oct.
10, p. 2) rests on shaky ground.
He forgets that Israel is a nation
with a historical basis in that
exact area (Palestine), and that
the Jews underwent forced
evacuation from Palestine
centuries before the Arabs ever
decided to settle the land.
If, therefore, we follow Mr.
Evers' argument that prior
ownership determines the right to
the land of the nation in question,
then that right belongs to the
Jews, who make up the majority
of the citizens of Israel. Mr. Evers'
argument can be altered to serve
any viewpoint, depending upon
how much history he chooses to
ignore. Ownership of land is not
the determinant in war guilt, but
the intention to kill is, and this is
shared by both sides in any war.

Mr. Evers Replies: The
investigation of the legitimacy of
a land title centers on evidence.
Of course, any person (whether
Arab or Jew), who can prove that
he is the heir of some individual
who in the past had a specific
piece of land stolen from him, is
entitled to that piece of land.
Stop Prejudging!

In recent months the Stanford
Daily has been known for a few
blunders which tended to alienate
the Stanford Jewish Community.
However, this most recent outrage
which the Daily has seen fit to
splash over its front page is at best
non-committal, at worst openly
anti-Israeli, hence anti-Semitic.
The headlines on the front
page of the editions of Monday,
Oct. 8 and Tuesday, Oct. 9
definitely point to the
one-sidedness of the Daily's
position. On Monday the headline
accused Israel of attacking the
Arabs. Such an accusation is
ludicrous for a number of reasons.
First, it has been stated by
U.N. observers that the Arabs
started the hostilities. Second, it
would take days of planning to
launch an attack such as the
Egyptians did. And third, it would
be sheer madness for the Israelis
to attack on Yom Kippur, a day
when most Israelis were either in
synagogue or at home with their
families.
In your article of Tuesday,
Oct. 9 you took a "sampling" of
opinion on the conflict. Your
omission of any strong pro-Israeli
views was only less obvious that
your concentration on pro-Arab
sources. The Jews at Stanford will
not stay silent, Israel must live!
And the Stanford Daily must stop
its prejudice!
