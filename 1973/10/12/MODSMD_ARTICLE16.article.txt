# 'There's No One Bugging Me But You'
## TNT Drama: Boring And Brilliant 
### DAVE THIEMANN 
The strengths and weaknesses
of There's No One Bugging Me
But You, a collection of plays,
poetry, and sketches performed
by The New fheater (TNT), fight
to an uneasy draw.
Fine, sensitive acting by Gerald
Hiken and Paul Richards almost
compensates for weak
performances by their wives, the
inherent limitations of two-person
theater, and two dull,
slow-moving plays.
Worthwhile drama emerges,
but an audience leaves the Palo
Alto Children's Theater frustrated
by the uneven quality of the plays
and actors. TNT will perform at
the theater on Fridays and
Saturdays through October 27.
Of the four major works in the
collection, two plays by Richards,
The Inheritance and For Amber
Grains of Blue, suffer by
comparison to two first-rate
pieces by other modem
playwrights: Doomsday Lunch by
Sheldon Feldner and I Hear

They're Putting a Man on the
Moon by Patty Moore.
A former Stanford
actor-playwright, Feldner set his
comedy in an accountants'
convention plagued by credible
rumors that the world will end at
noon. Hiken, playing a previously
timid accountant, fights with
Richards, a hard-bitten, skeptical
moderator, over three minutes of
time to address the meeting.
Although the plot may look
absurd in print, the two actors
perform with superb realism,
half-persuading the audience of
the situation.
I Hear They're Putting a Man
on the Moon presents a
conversation about lunar
exploration between two old
emigrants.
Although it relies on subtler
acting than Doomsday Lunch,
Moore's play comes off just as
well, with well-done realism and
dryly humorous dialogue.
With extraordinary attention
one could enjoy For Amber

Grains of Blue, but many people
will feel bored or oppressed by
the lack of plot and action
instead.
Within these constraints, both
actors perform well — Richards as
a bartender celebrating the 40th
anniversary of his family saloon,
Hiken as the bartender's cynical
friend.
The Inheritance, a Richards
play paired with Harold Pinter's
Night, does not drag quite as
badly as For Amber Grains, but
suffers from the same defect —
and from a mediocre performance

by Barbara Richards, the
playwright's wife.
She does not act badly, but the
almost-plotless play demands a
stage presence and dramatic skill
which she lacks, especially
opposite her husband.
Along with these plays, the
TNT production (one suspects the
acronym preceded the name)
includes several short, humorous
sketches, and Hiken's excellent
dramatic reading of an excerpt
from W.H. Auden's The Time
Being."

stage presence and dramatic skill
which she lacks, especially
opposite her husband.

TNT production (one suspects the

DESKTOP DRAMA—The life of a drama department chairman isn't
all footlights and applause. Charles Lyons, the drama department
chairman, contends that his administrative experience at UC Berkeley
qualifies him for his new post.
The strengths and weaknesses
of There's No One Bugging Me
But You, a collection of plays,
poetry, and sketches performed
by The New fheater (TNT), fight
to an uneasy draw.
Fine, sensitive acting by Gerald
Hiken and Paul Richards almost
compensates for weak
performances by their wives, the
inherent limitations of two-person
theater, and two dull,
slow-moving plays.
Worthwhile drama emerges,
but an audience leaves the Palo
Alto Children's Theater frustrated
by the uneven quality of the plays
and actors. TNT will perform at
the theater on Fridays and
Saturdays through October 27.
Of the four major works in the
collection, two plays by Richards,
The Inheritance and For Amber
Grains of Blue, suffer by
comparison to two first-rate
pieces by other modem
playwrights: Doomsday Lunch by
Sheldon Feldner and I Hear

They're Putting a Man on the
Moon by Patty Moore.
A former Stanford
actor-playwright, Feldner set his
comedy in an accountants'
convention plagued by credible
rumors that the world will end at
noon. Hiken, playing a previously
timid accountant, fights with
Richards, a hard-bitten, skeptical
moderator, over three minutes of
time to address the meeting.
Although the plot may look
absurd in print, the two actors
perform with superb realism,
half-persuading the audience of
the situation.
I Hear They're Putting a Man
on the Moon presents a
conversation about lunar
exploration between two old
emigrants.
Although it relies on subtler
acting than Doomsday Lunch,
Moore's play comes off just as
well, with well-done realism and
dryly humorous dialogue.
With extraordinary attention
one could enjoy For Amber

Grains of Blue, but many people
will feel bored or oppressed by
the lack of plot and action
instead.
Within these constraints, both
actors perform well — Richards as
a bartender celebrating the 40th
anniversary of his family saloon,
Hiken as the bartender's cynical
friend.
The Inheritance, a Richards
play paired with Harold Pinter's
Night, does not drag quite as
badly as For Amber Grains, but
suffers from the same defect —
and from a mediocre performance

by Barbara Richards, the
playwright's wife.
She does not act badly, but the
almost-plotless play demands a
stage presence and dramatic skill
which she lacks, especially
opposite her husband.
Along with these plays, the
TNT production (one suspects the
acronym preceded the name)
includes several short, humorous
sketches, and Hiken's excellent
dramatic reading of an excerpt
