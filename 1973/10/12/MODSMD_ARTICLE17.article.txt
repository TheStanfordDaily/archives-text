# Drama Department Chairman Plans Innovative Programs
## 
### JEFF GREENWALD 
Charles Lyons, the newly
appointed chairman of the drama
department, plans to bring some
new innovations to the University
theater and to update the drama
department. He was invited last
spring to fill the vacant seat
created when then-chairman Mike
Barry moved to London to join
the Academy of Music and
Dramatic Art.
When asked why he thought he
had been invited to chair the
department, Lyons replied, "I
think the main reason that I was
chosen was because of my
capacity as an administrator and
also because of my past
experience at U.C. Berkeley."
Before coming to the
University, Lyons was a professor
at Berkeley and held the dual
position of acting chairman of
the drama department and
associate dean of the School of
Letters and Sciences.
What new innovations does he
plan for this year's season?
Already in effect are new student
ticket prices to the drama
department productions. All

students may purchase tickets to
any performance for only a dollar.
"While the revenue from ticket
sales represents almost 80 percent
of the department's budget, the
loss in revenue from charging
students less this year is worth the
expense if we can get more
students to see the
performances," Lyons
commented on the lower ticket
prices. "The important thing is
the students and if we can
encourage more people to take an
interest in theater, then our
efforts are more than
compensated."
Lyons forsees a potentially
exciting season of drama on
campus Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern Are Dead will be
staged by director Charles
Hampton. John Chioles will direct
the folk production of Puntila and
His Hired Man.
Another planned drama
department innovation is the
reorganization of the doctorate
program, Lyons pointed out. In
the past, students have been
required to concentrate in one
field of theatrics, either acting or

directing. Under the new system,
students will be involved in a
more comprehensive graduate
study program and will be
required to direct as well as act.
Thus, says Lyons, students will
learn more about the mechanics
of the professional theater.
John Chioles, a veteran
director who last year did The
Architect and The Emperor of
Assyria, said that he had "nothing
but extraordinary praise for
Lyons." Charles Hampton, a
visiting professor from S.F. State,
said that he had been friends with
Lyons "ever since we were in the
doctorate program together in
1963. Lyons is great!"
With a full season ahead of
him, Lyons hopes that more
undergraduates will play a bigger
part in the plays than last year. He
encourages even non-drama
majors to try out for parts.
"It's the people that make a
production. If we can give the
theater to a greater percentage of
people this year, we will no doubt
combine the talent of our staff
with the excellent actors to have a
smashing season." Lyons said of
the upcoming productions.
Lyons lives with his wife,
whose hobby is collecting
lithographs and old art works,
with his two sons, Christopher
and Jamie, and his two
dachshunds.

SOCIAL CONSCIOUSNESS—In this tense scene from the San Francisco Mime Troupe's version of "The
Mother, by Bertolt Brecht, a butcher lends his support to striking farmworkers by ousting two
strikebreakers. The Mime Troupe s original comic skits and radical analysis of contemporary issues have
been both ridiculed and lauded for their artistry and originality. Stanfordites will have an opportunity to
judge the troupe for themselves tomorrow in Dinkelspiel Auditorium at 8 p.m. Tickets are $2.50, $2 for
students at the door.
