# Matrix Promotes Local Rock Talent
## 
### PAUL BREWBAKER 
SAN FRANCISCO—The City is
in many ways to rock music what
Vienna is to opera. Among the
frontrunners of rock music
entertainment in San Francisco is
the recently reopened Matrix, an
original nightclub dedicated to the
popularization of the emerging
local music scene.
Unlike its main competitors,
the Orphanage, the Boarding
House, or Keystone Komer with
their limited scope of presentation
(jazz only, dance bands only, etc.)
the Matrix has no restrictive
criteria for their acts other than
that they are good. Certainly, the
Matrix's record speaks for itself.
Originally opened in 1965, the
Matrix then showcased its
part-owners — the Jefferson
Airplane — as its feature act. The
Airplane steadily increased their
popularity while sharing the bill
with other local unknowns.
Underground Sound
Soon other underground acts
made appearances at the club: Big
Brother and the Holding
Company, the Grateful Dead,
Quicksilver Messenger Service,
Steve Miller, and other rock
groups which emerged to make
history as the "San Francisco
sound." For these groups, the
Matrix served as a springboard
into the music industry.
Before long the original San
Francisco groups were on the road
to national success, and the
Matrix continued to function as a
springboard for a new wave of
local rock groups. San tana and It's
a Beautiful Day both broke into
the music scene via the Matrix, as
did Hot Tuna and an unknown
Texas bluesman named Johnny
Winter.
As the scene continued to
evolve, the ballrooms began to
attract out-of-town talent such as
New York's Blues Project and Los
Angeles' the Doors. These acts
performed at the Matrix as did
Howlin' Wolf, the Chambers
Brothers, and others who had
time to spend in San Francisco.
Folk-Rock-Blues
Until its closing in the summer
of 1971, the Matrix remained the

primary small underground club
in town by presenting such Bay
Area name talent as Elvin Bishop,
Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Sandy Bull,
the Velvet Underground, Charlie
Musselwhite, Tower of Power,
Cold Blood, and other
folk-rock-blues greats.
Now relocated at 412
Broadway, the new Matrix only
recently reopened in August with
Mike Bloom field and Copperhead.
Since then the Matrix has
hosted Box Scaggs, Harvey
Mandel, and most recently Luis

Gasca, and jazz-rock artists
Weather Report in two nights of
concerts last week. Manager Pete
Abrams and his staff hope to
maintain the club's traditional
orientation in their new facilities.
Talent Lineup
Promoter-booker Scott Piering
has an impressive list of talent
lined up for the next month or
two, including Muddy Waters,
Azteca, the Sons of Champlin,
Whalers, John Lee Hooker, and as
a Halloween special, Iggy and the
Stooges.

In addition to the constant
flow of established artists, the
Matrix continues to encourage
local talent by co-billing big-name
performers with local groups as
warmup acts. Wednesday nights
are set aside as "audition nights"
when local bands and artists play,
with no cover charge and free beer
to boot.
Inside, the Matrix's attractive
500-seat interior (the old Matrix
seated 150), houses a well-stocked
bar and a good-sized dance floor.
As far as looks go, "the Matrix
always was a funky place," said
Piering, unlike the classy
Orphanage, "where you generally
don't find hippies" he continued
with a bearded smile.
With the cabaret license, the
Matrix can keep its doors open
after the 2 a.m. liquor curfew to
host jam-oriented artists like Elvin
Bishop. Minors are welcome, and
the cover charge never exceeds
$3.00 for even the best talent.
There's food too, for anyone with
the munchies.
Open at least six nights a week,
with plenty of good music on a
primo sound system, and with
movie shorts or cartoons during
set changes (anyone for Betty
Boop?) the Matrix is, according to
Piering, "one of the top five music
spots in town."

Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Sandy Bull,
the Velvet Underground, Charlie
Musselwhite, Tower of Power,
Cold Blood, and other
folk-rock-blues greats.
Now relocated at 412
Broadway, the new Matrix only
recently reopened in August with
Mike Bloom field and Copperhead.
Since then the Matrix has
hosted Box Scaggs, Harvey
Mandel, and most recently Luis

Gasca, and jazz-rock artists
Weather Report in two nights of
concerts last week. Manager Pete
Abrams and his staff hope to
maintain the club's traditional
orientation in their new facilities.
Talent Lineup
Promoter-booker Scott Piering
has an impressive list of talent
lined up for the next month or
two, including Muddy Waters,
Azteca, the Sons of Champlin,
Whalers, John Lee Hooker, and as
a Halloween special, Iggy and the
Stooges.

In addition to the constant
flow of established artists, the
Matrix continues to encourage
local talent by co-billing big-name
performers with local groups as
warmup acts. Wednesday nights
are set aside as "audition nights"
when local bands and artists play,
with no cover charge and free beer
to boot.
Inside, the Matrix's attractive
500-seat interior (the old Matrix
seated 150), houses a well-stocked
bar and a good-sized dance floor.
As far as looks go, "the Matrix
always was a funky place," said
Piering, unlike the classy
Orphanage, "where you generally
don't find hippies" he continued
with a bearded smile.
With the cabaret license, the
Matrix can keep its doors open
after the 2 a.m. liquor curfew to
host jam-oriented artists like Elvin
Bishop. Minors are welcome, and
the cover charge never exceeds
$3.00 for even the best talent.
There's food too, for anyone with
the munchies.
Open at least six nights a week,
with plenty of good music on a
primo sound system, and with
movie shorts or cartoons during
set changes (anyone for Betty
Boop?) the Matrix is, according to
Piering, "one of the top five music
spots in town."

COMING ON HARD—"The Harder They Come," a full-length Jamaican film produced and directed by
Perry Henzell, stars Jimmy Cliff as a struggling Reggae pop singer in Kingston determined to "get what s
mine." Hie widely acclaimed film will be shown tonight in Mem Aud. at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m. Proceeds
benefit the Law School Prison Law Project.
SAN FRANCISCO—The City is
in many ways to rock music what
Vienna is to opera. Among the
frontrunners of rock music
entertainment in San Francisco is
the recently reopened Matrix, an
original nightclub dedicated to the
popularization of the emerging
local music scene.
Unlike its main competitors,
the Orphanage, the Boarding
House, or Keystone Komer with
their limited scope of presentation
(jazz only, dance bands only, etc.)
the Matrix has no restrictive
criteria for their acts other than
that they are good. Certainly, the
Matrix's record speaks for itself.
Originally opened in 1965, the
Matrix then showcased its
part-owners — the Jefferson
Airplane — as its feature act. The
Airplane steadily increased their
popularity while sharing the bill
with other local unknowns.
Underground Sound
Soon other underground acts
made appearances at the club: Big
Brother and the Holding
Company, the Grateful Dead,
Quicksilver Messenger Service,
Steve Miller, and other rock
groups which emerged to make
history as the "San Francisco
sound." For these groups, the
Matrix served as a springboard
into the music industry.
Before long the original San
Francisco groups were on the road
to national success, and the
Matrix continued to function as a
springboard for a new wave of
local rock groups. San tana and It's
a Beautiful Day both broke into
the music scene via the Matrix, as
did Hot Tuna and an unknown
Texas bluesman named Johnny
Winter.
As the scene continued to
evolve, the ballrooms began to
attract out-of-town talent such as
New York's Blues Project and Los
Angeles' the Doors. These acts
performed at the Matrix as did
Howlin' Wolf, the Chambers
Brothers, and others who had
time to spend in San Francisco.
Folk-Rock-Blues
Until its closing in the summer
of 1971, the Matrix remained the

primary small underground club
in town by presenting such Bay
Area name talent as Elvin Bishop,
Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Sandy Bull,
the Velvet Underground, Charlie
Musselwhite, Tower of Power,
Cold Blood, and other
folk-rock-blues greats.

SAN FRANCISCO—The City is
in many ways to rock music what
Vienna is to opera. Among the
frontrunners of rock music
entertainment in San Francisco is
the recently reopened Matrix, an
original nightclub dedicated to the
popularization of the emerging
local music scene.
Unlike its main competitors,
the Orphanage, the Boarding
House, or Keystone Komer with
their limited scope of presentation
(jazz only, dance bands only, etc.)
the Matrix has no restrictive
criteria for their acts other than
that they are good. Certainly, the
Matrix's record speaks for itself.
Originally opened in 1965, the
Matrix then showcased its
part-owners — the Jefferson
Airplane — as its feature act. The
Airplane steadily increased their
popularity while sharing the bill
with other local unknowns.
Underground Sound
Soon other underground acts
made appearances at the club: Big
Brother and the Holding
Company, the Grateful Dead,
Quicksilver Messenger Service,
Steve Miller, and other rock
groups which emerged to make
history as the "San Francisco
sound." For these groups, the
Matrix served as a springboard
into the music industry.
Before long the original San
Francisco groups were on the road
to national success, and the
Matrix continued to function as a
springboard for a new wave of
local rock groups. San tana and It's
a Beautiful Day both broke into
the music scene via the Matrix, as
did Hot Tuna and an unknown
Texas bluesman named Johnny
Winter.
As the scene continued to
evolve, the ballrooms began to
attract out-of-town talent such as
New York's Blues Project and Los
Angeles' the Doors. These acts
performed at the Matrix as did
Howlin' Wolf, the Chambers
Brothers, and others who had
time to spend in San Francisco.
Folk-Rock-Blues
Until its closing in the summer
of 1971, the Matrix remained the

primary small underground club
in town by presenting such Bay
Area name talent as Elvin Bishop,
Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Sandy Bull,
the Velvet Underground, Charlie
Musselwhite, Tower of Power,
Cold Blood, and other
folk-rock-blues greats.
Now relocated at 412
Broadway, the new Matrix only
recently reopened in August with
Mike Bloom field and Copperhead.
Since then the Matrix has
hosted Box Scaggs, Harvey
Mandel, and most recently Luis

Gasca, and jazz-rock artists
Weather Report in two nights of
concerts last week. Manager Pete
Abrams and his staff hope to
maintain the club's traditional
orientation in their new facilities.
Talent Lineup
Promoter-booker Scott Piering
has an impressive list of talent
lined up for the next month or
two, including Muddy Waters,
Azteca, the Sons of Champlin,
Whalers, John Lee Hooker, and as
a Halloween special, Iggy and the
Stooges.

In addition to the constant
flow of established artists, the
Matrix continues to encourage
local talent by co-billing big-name
performers with local groups as
warmup acts. Wednesday nights
are set aside as "audition nights"
when local bands and artists play,
with no cover charge and free beer
to boot.
Inside, the Matrix's attractive
500-seat interior (the old Matrix
seated 150), houses a well-stocked
bar and a good-sized dance floor.
As far as looks go, "the Matrix
always was a funky place," said
Piering, unlike the classy
Orphanage, "where you generally
don't find hippies" he continued
with a bearded smile.
With the cabaret license, the
Matrix can keep its doors open
after the 2 a.m. liquor curfew to
host jam-oriented artists like Elvin
Bishop. Minors are welcome, and
the cover charge never exceeds
$3.00 for even the best talent.
There's food too, for anyone with
the munchies.
Open at least six nights a week,
with plenty of good music on a
primo sound system, and with
movie shorts or cartoons during
set changes (anyone for Betty
Boop?) the Matrix is, according to
Piering, "one of the top five music
spots in town."
