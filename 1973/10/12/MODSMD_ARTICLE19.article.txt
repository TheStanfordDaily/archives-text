# Guitar Freaks Should Notice Albert Collins
## 
### BROCK DETHIER 
SAN FRANCISCO - A lot of
good concerts for bay area guitar
freaks took place last weekend,
but one of the best — Albert
Collins at the Matrix — went
virtually unnoticed. The crowd
was sparse Saturday night when
Collins was billed with
Copperhead, and so small Sunday
night, when Collins was the only
group, that the show was almost
cancelled.
But the handful of people who
did show up were treated to a
superb, varied, and informal show.
Collins is a unique guitarist.
He plays his telecaster with a D
minor tuning, and picks with his
bare fingers, usually his index
finger. His music is blues,
although he only played one
straight blues number Sunday
night.
The only recognizable titles
from the concerts — "Going
Round in Circles," Sly Stone's
"Higher and Higher," and "Sex
Machine" give a poor idea of what
Collins played.
His band is excellent: Collin's
plays, like many experienced
blues men, with a second lead
guitarist who was exciting and
innovative in his own right. The
rest of the band — drums, organ,
bass — seemed more jazz-oriented,
and supplied respectable solos to
balance Collin's smooth, fast, and
at times even conversational guitar
playing.
When hearing a guitarist of
Collins's ability for the first time,
one is inclined to think of
comparisons with Buddy Guy,
Albert and 8.8. King, or T-Bone
Walker. Collins suffers by none of
these comparisons, he is a classy
showman as well as a guitarist.
Canned Heat's Bob Hite
"discovered" Collins in Texas for
Imperial records. It now apperas
as if somebody needs to do San
Francisco the same favor.
