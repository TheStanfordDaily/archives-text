# At Faculty Senate Meeting
## Teacher Evaluation Debated 
### DIANE NORBURG 
Point-by-point discussion on a proposed teaching
evaluation resolution marked the second fall quarter
meeting of the Faculty Senate yesterday. Debate centered
on amendments to the Senate steering committee's
revision of the teaching evaluation document handed
down from the Committee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement (C-AAA) last May.
The proposal, which was also the principal discussion
topic during the Senate's first meeting Sept. 27, concerns
annual appraisal or evaluation of teaching at all levels of
the University.
Senators tentatively approved the first two of four
sections of the proposal, all of which will be resubmitted
for consideration after each section is individually
debated.
Some members were concerned over the proposal's
failure to offer a definition of teaching, as considered in
the evaluation procedure. Electrical Engineering Prof.
Gordon Kino, who was Chairman of the C-AAA
subcommittee responsible for the plan, said that the
report had been left intentionally flexible to allow
interpretation by each department according to its
individual demands.
Teaching Definition
Physics Prof. J. Dirk Walecka, the Faculty Senate
chairman, suggested that a preamble including a teaching
definition might be attached to the document after the
Senate completes its step-by-step analysis.
An amendment submitted by Anthropology Prof.
Francis A. Cancian, which broadened the proposal to

consider a professor's "contribution to teaching
undergraduate and graduate students in and out of the
classroom," was passed by a voice vote.
Discussion on the second section of the proposal
concerned evaluation of teaching assistants. The report
was again amended to broaden the evaluation
requirements, thereby including students teaching in
special programs, such as SWOPSI.
Further discussion on evaluation procedures was
delayed until the next Senate meeting to avoid what
President Richard W. Lyman called "an anti-nitpicking
vote."
Women Faculty
In other business, Arthur Bienenstock, vice provost for
faculty affairs, delivered the first required annual report
on the Faculty Affirmative Action program. His report
centered on the actual hiring of women and minority
group faculty members during the past year in comparison
to the goals stated by the Senate in a resolution adopted
Feb. 22, 1973.
Bienenstock said that "vigorous searches" had not been
conducted during the 1972-73 school year because most
departments, as well as the schools of law and business,
were not in "an expansionist mood." However, he stated
that the University was seeing a natural flow of women
into the faculty.
The first minority employment concern is the
under-representation of chicanos, Bienenstock said.
Findings revealed that the nine chicanos currently serving
on the faculty were "heavily depended upon" during the
past year by chicano students.

An amendment submitted by Anthropology Prof.
Francis A. Cancian, which broadened the proposal to

consider a professor's "contribution to teaching
undergraduate and graduate students in and out of the
classroom," was passed by a voice vote.
Discussion on the second section of the proposal
concerned evaluation of teaching assistants. The report
was again amended to broaden the evaluation
requirements, thereby including students teaching in
special programs, such as SWOPSI.
Further discussion on evaluation procedures was
delayed until the next Senate meeting to avoid what
President Richard W. Lyman called "an anti-nitpicking
vote."
Women Faculty
In other business, Arthur Bienenstock, vice provost for
faculty affairs, delivered the first required annual report
on the Faculty Affirmative Action program. His report
centered on the actual hiring of women and minority
group faculty members during the past year in comparison
to the goals stated by the Senate in a resolution adopted
Feb. 22, 1973.
Bienenstock said that "vigorous searches" had not been
conducted during the 1972-73 school year because most
departments, as well as the schools of law and business,
were not in "an expansionist mood." However, he stated
that the University was seeing a natural flow of women
into the faculty.
The first minority employment concern is the
under-representation of chicanos, Bienenstock said.
Findings revealed that the nine chicanos currently serving
on the faculty were "heavily depended upon" during the
past year by chicano students.
Point-by-point discussion on a proposed teaching
evaluation resolution marked the second fall quarter
meeting of the Faculty Senate yesterday. Debate centered
on amendments to the Senate steering committee's
revision of the teaching evaluation document handed
down from the Committee on Academic Appraisal and
Achievement (C-AAA) last May.
The proposal, which was also the principal discussion
topic during the Senate's first meeting Sept. 27, concerns
annual appraisal or evaluation of teaching at all levels of
the University.
Senators tentatively approved the first two of four
sections of the proposal, all of which will be resubmitted
for consideration after each section is individually
debated.
Some members were concerned over the proposal's
failure to offer a definition of teaching, as considered in
the evaluation procedure. Electrical Engineering Prof.
Gordon Kino, who was Chairman of the C-AAA
subcommittee responsible for the plan, said that the
report had been left intentionally flexible to allow
interpretation by each department according to its
individual demands.
Teaching Definition
Physics Prof. J. Dirk Walecka, the Faculty Senate
chairman, suggested that a preamble including a teaching
definition might be attached to the document after the
Senate completes its step-by-step analysis.
