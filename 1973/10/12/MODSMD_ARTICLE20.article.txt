# Women's Field Hockey Begins Tomorrow Despite 'Dangers'
## 
### ELAINE MORITA SUSIE LYNN 
Field Hockey? Isn't that
dangerous? Girls play that? Every
fall these types of exclamations
are shouted as Stanford's women's
field hockey team runs itself into
shape. But there is nothing to
fear. As the girls gallantly charge
down the field, they are out to
smash the hockey ball, not their
opponents.
Tomorrow morning the ball
will be smashed for the first time
this season when Stanford travels
to San Jose State for a 9 a.m.
game against the Spartans.
The team has been practicing
four days a week from 3:15 to
5:15 p.m. Coach Shirley Schoof
says that the players now run a
mile around the track, but will
probably be running two miles
later this season. The actual games
run 70 minutes, with only one
short five-minute break between
halves.
It obviously takes a lot of
energy, skill and stamina.
Monday, while most students
sought shelter from the rain, the
dedicated team members were
practicing hard despite the muddy
field.
Several of this year's players
are veterans from last year's team.
Offensive stars Marina Ballantyne
and Cappy Coleman, two
important forces in leading the
squad to a victorious season last
year, have returned with their

winning talents. Along with these
offensive hopes, the equally
powerful defense of Pia Atkinson,
Diane Gates and Susie Schatzman
is back again to aid goalie Betsy
Morris. This year's team also has
some newcomers whose skills will
help to provide even more
strength and spirit.
The 1973 schedule features
games against Sacramento State,
San Jose State, Chico State, UC
Davis, California and archrival
Hay ward State. The first home
game will be played Thursday at
3:30 p.m. against Hay ward.
Several other women's sports
teams are also preparing for their
opening intercollegiate
competitions. The swimming team
opens its season Thursday, the
golf team will host the Stanford
Invitational on Oct. 25-26 and the
fencing season gets underway on
Oct. 20.
