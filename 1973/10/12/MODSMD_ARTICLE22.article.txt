# Defending National Champions
## UCLA Challenges Cardinal Poloists 
### CHRIS BAKER 
UCLA, the defending national
champions of college water polo,
will test the Cardinal poloists
tomorrow at 10 a.m. in the first
Pacific Eight game of the season.
Today the Cards will tune up for
the match by playing Cal
Poly-Pomona at 3 p.m.
Both games will be played at
Stanford, but as late as
Wednesday of this week, Coach
Jim Gaughran wasn't sure whether
the Cards would be competing in
their old or new home. Stanford's
new swimming facility still hasn't
opened because of drainage
problems.
Gaughran was hesitant to
predict the final outcome, but he
offered an interesting analysis of
cmparative scores against common
opponents. "UCLA could be a

really close contest," Gaughran
said. "The Bruins lost to
UC-Irvine in the Irvine
tournament, San Jose State lost to
Irvine in an overtime match and
we beat San Jose last week in
another overtime contest."
Fast Break Offense
The Cards will continue to use
their fast break offense, with
sprinter Dean Anderson leading
the charge. Rick Gebers, who
played extremely well last week,
is expected to pace the Cardinal
scoring attack. It was Gebers'
outstanding play that gave the
Cards their victory over San Jose
State last weekend in the third
place game of the Northern
California Open.
Goalie Tom Cummings will
again be back in the nets to help
stop the explosive Bruins.
"Right now we have 10 players

who can perform very well for
us," Gaughran said. "We would
like to have an offense in which
all of our players contribute to
the scoring. If this happens the
Bruins won't be able to beat us by
defensing just one man."
UCLA is led by Garth Bergeson
and Kurt Krumpholtz, both of
whom were members of the
championship squad last year.
UCLA is ranked third in the
nation this season, behind
California and UC—lrvine. The
Cardinals are ranked fourth with
San Jose State and Long Beach
State rounding out the top six.
Six League Gains
Since only the four California
schools in the Pac-8 (Stanford,
Cal, USC, UCLA) field water polo
teams, there are only six league
games, two against each
conference opponent. To qualify

for the NCAA championships the
Cards must finish first or second
in the league or get an at-large
berth in the tournament on the
basis of an outstanding overall
record.
Last week in the tournament
the Cards were forced to rally late
in the games. This week, however,
Gaughran hopes his team can
build an early lead so that
last-minute heroics won't be
necessary.
The Cards will also be trying
to play a steadier game, with an
attempt to make the scoring more
evenly distributed. Last week
Stanford missed many
opportunities on the fast break as
the Cards fired shots too quickly,
resulting in several muffed
opportunities.
The junior varsity team will
also be in action this weekend,
playing immediately following the
varstiy contests both today and
tomorrow. Homestead High
School and San Jose City College
will be the JV opponents.

problems.
Gaughran was hesitant to
predict the final outcome, but he
offered an interesting analysis of
cmparative scores against common
opponents. "UCLA could be a

really close contest," Gaughran
said. "The Bruins lost to
UC-Irvine in the Irvine
tournament, San Jose State lost to
Irvine in an overtime match and
we beat San Jose last week in
another overtime contest."
Fast Break Offense
The Cards will continue to use
their fast break offense, with
sprinter Dean Anderson leading
the charge. Rick Gebers, who
played extremely well last week,
is expected to pace the Cardinal
scoring attack. It was Gebers'
outstanding play that gave the
Cards their victory over San Jose
State last weekend in the third
place game of the Northern
California Open.
Goalie Tom Cummings will
again be back in the nets to help
stop the explosive Bruins.
"Right now we have 10 players

who can perform very well for
us," Gaughran said. "We would
like to have an offense in which
all of our players contribute to
the scoring. If this happens the
Bruins won't be able to beat us by
defensing just one man."
UCLA is led by Garth Bergeson
and Kurt Krumpholtz, both of
whom were members of the
championship squad last year.
UCLA is ranked third in the
nation this season, behind
California and UC—lrvine. The
Cardinals are ranked fourth with
San Jose State and Long Beach
State rounding out the top six.
Six League Gains
Since only the four California
schools in the Pac-8 (Stanford,
Cal, USC, UCLA) field water polo
teams, there are only six league
games, two against each
conference opponent. To qualify

for the NCAA championships the
Cards must finish first or second
in the league or get an at-large
berth in the tournament on the
basis of an outstanding overall
record.
Last week in the tournament
the Cards were forced to rally late
in the games. This week, however,
Gaughran hopes his team can
build an early lead so that
last-minute heroics won't be
necessary.
The Cards will also be trying
to play a steadier game, with an
attempt to make the scoring more
evenly distributed. Last week
Stanford missed many
opportunities on the fast break as
the Cards fired shots too quickly,
resulting in several muffed
opportunities.
The junior varsity team will
also be in action this weekend,
playing immediately following the
varstiy contests both today and
tomorrow. Homestead High
School and San Jose City College
will be the JV opponents.

BATTLING FOR THE BALL—Stanford's Larry Mann (partially submerged) and a San Jose State
defender fight for the ball during last week's Northern California Open. The Cards, who finished third in
that event, will host defending national champion UCLA tomorrow at 10 a.m.
UCLA, the defending national
champions of college water polo,
will test the Cardinal poloists
tomorrow at 10 a.m. in the first
Pacific Eight game of the season.
Today the Cards will tune up for
the match by playing Cal
Poly-Pomona at 3 p.m.
Both games will be played at
Stanford, but as late as
Wednesday of this week, Coach
Jim Gaughran wasn't sure whether
the Cards would be competing in
their old or new home. Stanford's
new swimming facility still hasn't
opened because of drainage
problems.
