# Card Booters Host Talented Bruins
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Stanford's soccer team takes
on its third nationally ranked
opponent in five games Saturday,
when the Cards face UCLA at
Harry Maloney Field near Sunken
Diamond. Game time is 10 a.m.
The Bruins are rated second on
the West Coast, behind only
University of San Francisco
(USF), which handed Stanford its
first loss of the season, 7-0, last
Saturday.
The Cards should be at full
strength for the Bruin contest as
Marty Glickfeld, who missed the
USF game, and Walter Robb who
has been injured, will both play.
Stanford Coach Fred Priddle
said that when "You're being
pushed for 90 minutes, it's quite a
strain," referring to the USF
game. He is very happy that Robb
and Glickfeld will be back in the
lineup.
Powerful Team
UCLA has a powerful team, as
their 11-0 conquest of USC early
in the season indicates.
The Bruins played USF in a
benefit game last night, and
Priddle hoped to leam something
about UCLA's strengths and
weaknesses by attending the
game. The final score was not
available at press time.
Priddle said that Bruin coach
Dennis Stone has another
outstanding team, and an
"exceptionally good goal-keeper."
This could pose problems for the
Cards because, outside of their
11-0 defeat of out-matched Notre
Dame, they have managed just
two goals.
In their most recent game,
played Wednesday afternoon, the
booters were edged by UC Davis,

2-1, on the victors' field. The loss
evened Stanford's record at 2-2.
Davis scored first about 20
minutes into the game, when a
Card fullback misjudged a pass,
which sailed over his head to a
waiting Aggie. He dribbled in,
one-on-one against goalie Walt
Harris, and scored.
First Goal
Stanford came right back five
minutes later, as Johnny Murao
got his first goal of the season,
assisted by Phil Wright.
With the score tied late in the
second half, Davis was awarded a
penalty shot as a Card player
committed a foul within the
penalty area. Harris could not rise
to the occasion, as he had done
once previously in the game, and
Davis scored and held on for the
victory.
Priddle said the Cards
"dominated the game, but a
couple of silly mistakes," set up
easy shots for Davis. He added
that the ball was in their (Davis')
half of the field most of the game,
but not in their goal enough.
Stanford outshot Davis 14 to 9.
Priddle was pleased that his
team "came down the right side"
when attacking, as opposed to the
left as they had done in their
previous games. He also lauded
the Cards sharp passing,
something that will be necessary if
they are to upset UCLA.
The junior varsity had its
record lowered to 1-2 as they
were topped by the Davis JV's
2-1. Dave Nrobille had the lone
Cardinal score.
The freshmen will try for their
first win of the season Saturday at
10 a.m. as they play Balboa High
(S.F.), here.

"dominated the game, but a
couple of silly mistakes," set up
easy shots for Davis. He added
that the ball was in their (Davis')
half of the field most of the game,
but not in their goal enough.
Stanford outshot Davis 14 to 9.
Priddle was pleased that his
team "came down the right side"
when attacking, as opposed to the
left as they had done in their
previous games. He also lauded
the Cards sharp passing,
something that will be necessary if
they are to upset UCLA.
The junior varsity had its
record lowered to 1-2 as they
were topped by the Davis JV's
2-1. Dave Nrobille had the lone
Cardinal score.
The freshmen will try for their
first win of the season Saturday at
10 a.m. as they play Balboa High
(S.F.), here.
Stanford's soccer team takes
on its third nationally ranked
opponent in five games Saturday,
when the Cards face UCLA at
Harry Maloney Field near Sunken
Diamond. Game time is 10 a.m.
The Bruins are rated second on
the West Coast, behind only
University of San Francisco
(USF), which handed Stanford its
first loss of the season, 7-0, last
Saturday.
The Cards should be at full
strength for the Bruin contest as
Marty Glickfeld, who missed the
USF game, and Walter Robb who
has been injured, will both play.
Stanford Coach Fred Priddle
said that when "You're being
pushed for 90 minutes, it's quite a
strain," referring to the USF
game. He is very happy that Robb
and Glickfeld will be back in the
lineup.
Powerful Team
UCLA has a powerful team, as
their 11-0 conquest of USC early
in the season indicates.
The Bruins played USF in a
benefit game last night, and
Priddle hoped to leam something
about UCLA's strengths and
weaknesses by attending the
game. The final score was not
available at press time.
Priddle said that Bruin coach
Dennis Stone has another
outstanding team, and an
"exceptionally good goal-keeper."
This could pose problems for the
Cards because, outside of their
11-0 defeat of out-matched Notre
Dame, they have managed just
two goals.
In their most recent game,
played Wednesday afternoon, the
booters were edged by UC Davis,

2-1, on the victors' field. The loss
evened Stanford's record at 2-2.
Davis scored first about 20
minutes into the game, when a
Card fullback misjudged a pass,
which sailed over his head to a
waiting Aggie. He dribbled in,
one-on-one against goalie Walt
Harris, and scored.
First Goal
Stanford came right back five
minutes later, as Johnny Murao
got his first goal of the season,
assisted by Phil Wright.
With the score tied late in the
second half, Davis was awarded a
penalty shot as a Card player
committed a foul within the
penalty area. Harris could not rise
to the occasion, as he had done
once previously in the game, and
Davis scored and held on for the
victory.
