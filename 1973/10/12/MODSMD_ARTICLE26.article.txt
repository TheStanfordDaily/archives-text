# IM Roundup
## Deadlines Nearing 
### PETE BHATIA 
The deadline is rapidly
approaching for the first round of
the intramural golf and tennis
tournaments. First round play in
both events must be completed by
Monday. It is absolutely necessary
that all matches are finished by

then if play is to continue
properly. If a match is not
reported to the IM office by
Monday, the winner will be
determined by a coin toss. Any
problems should be addressed to
Ron Sue or Pete Bhatia at the IM
office.

One full week of football play
has been completed and there
have been some surprises. TTie
Wildmen upset the highly touted
Phi Delts 14-6 in the week's
biggest upset.
The defending champion Zetes
had trouble with the
unexpectedly tough Betas before
moving away to a 20-6 win.
In other top games the SAE's
tromped Twain 33-6 and the
Mutants stopped Sigma Chi 12-0.
The Mutants meet the Zetes
tomorrow morning.
In "B" League action, the
Tlieta Delt '"B's" opened their
title defense with a 20-6 victory
over the Engineers.
j|c * * * s):
Basketball Free Throws also
got under way this past week. A
total of 42 teams is entered this
year, including last year's
champions, the Dekes.
Anyone may still enter the IM
Cross Country meet, scheduled
for Nov. 2 at the golf course.
However, that's only three weeks
away so if you're planning to
enter the two-mile "sprint," you
better start getting in shape.
