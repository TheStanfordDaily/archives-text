# Sciarra Will Start At QB
## Explosive Bruins Test Card Defense 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
A few football games can often
cause a head coach to re-evaluate
his position. Before the season
started, UCLA coach Pepper
Rodgers said this about
quarterback Mark Harmon:
"There's not a better man in the
country at operating the
Wishbone."
Well, Rodgers thinks he has
found a better man, and he didn't
have to look very far to find him.
Former Bruin second-stringer
John Sciarra will direct the
Wishbone offense tomorrow when
UCLA (3-1) meets Stanford (2-2)
in a 1:30 p.m. game at Stanford
Stadium. Oddsmakers have listed
the Bruins as 11-15 point favorites
in the Pacific Eight opener for
both teams.
"The way Sciarra's playing he
might be a starter ahead of Tom
Harmon," said one Los Angeles
sportswriter, referring to Mark's
Heisman Trophy-winning father.
Rodgers, however, indicated
that both Sciarra and Harmon
would see action against the
Cards. "Both have done a good
job," he said. "I have so much
confidence in both of them that
it's really just a matter of who we
decide to start, that's all."
No matter who quarterbacks
the Bruins, Stanford will be facing
an offensive team that can only be
termed explosive. Here are a few
highlights from UCLA's
impressive collection of offensive
statistics:
The Bruins can count on 5.6
yards every running play; they are
averaging 42 points per game
(51.7 since their opening game
loss to Nebraska); Sciarra (yes, the
quarterback) is averaging 15.6
yards per punt return; and
halfback Kermit Johnson, who
should be UCLA's first 2000 yard
career rusher before the season
ends, is currently averaging 8.1
yards per carry.
Tfye numbers go on and on, but

statistics, as Cardinal coach Jack
Christiansen likes to point out,
don't win football games. Last
week, for example, Stanford
defeated Illinois 24-0 on the
strength of three touchdown
drives that totaled only 23 yards.
"We got some breaks that were
just unbelievable," said
Christiansen, "but the important
thing was that we were able to
take advantage each time and then
play good defense to prevent
them from coming back."
Christiansen pointed out some
facts from the Illinois game that
were strangely reminiscent of
Stanford's 47-10 loss to Michigan
three weeks ago. "They [Illinois]
fumbled on the 16, the exact spot
where we fumbled against
Michigan, and we scored," Chris
said, shaking his head. "The next
time they had the ball their
punter fumbled the snap from
center and we tackled him at the
six — again, the exact spot
Michigan did that to us.
"But as strange as the Illinois
game was, it gave us momentum
to play a team like UCLA."
The Bruins, ranked 11th
nationally, "have great team
speed," according to Christiansen,
"and their two quarterbacks have
been operating flawlessly. Their
Wishbone offense is a year older
and a year better, and McAlister is
a much bigger threat at fullback
than they had a year ago.
'To stop the Wishbone, it's
just about the same as any other
defense in football — someone has
to defeat a blocker to get to the
ballcarrier. The biggest problem
on defense is that the quarterback
is often overlooked with double
assignments elsewhere, and that's
about the time he keeps the ball
and runs it upfield himself."
Stanford came out of last
week's contest without any major
injuries, but the Bruins weren't as
fortunate. Cal Peterson and Fred
McNeill, a pair of defensive ends

Rodgers calls "the best in the
country," won't play tomorrow.
Peterson, who suffered a
chipped elbow bone in a freak
accident during Monday's
practice, will be lost for at least a
week. McNeill is recovering from
an ankle injury he sustained in last
week's 66-16 victory over Utah.
Partially because of the injuries
and partially because he is a
football coach, Rodgers has tried
to remain apprehensive about
tomorrow's outcome. "Stanford is
an excellent football team — any
team that shuts out an opponent,
any opponent, has to be good,"
Rodgers said. "I know they have
fine players because we tried to
recruit many of them."

Cardinal Notes: UCLA's

66-point outburst against Utah
last week was the highest score in
55 years of Bruin football, topped
only by the school record of 72-0
over Stanford in 1954 and 67-0
over San Diego Naval Training
Center the same year.
Christiansen has named three
captains for tomorrow's game.
Offensive captain Doug Jena,
defensive captain Gordie Riegel
and special teams captain Dave
Ottmar will decide between heads
and tails at midfield prior to
tomorrow's contest.
The game will be broadcast on
KSFO (560 AM) and on KZSU
(90.1 AM). The KSFO broadcast
will feature Don Klein and Bob
Murphy, with Hall Daily and
Charlie Hoffman at the
microphone on KZSU.

KEY TO THE WISHBONE—UCLA halfback Kermit Johnson, an
All-League selection in 1972, is once again making life miserable for
Pacific Eight defenses. Johnson is currently averaging 8.1 yards a carry
from his spot in the Bruin Wishbone.
