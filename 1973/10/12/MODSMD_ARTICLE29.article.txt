# Junior Varsity Season Begins Today As Cardinals Host Powerful Bruins
## 
### TIM FERGUSON 
If a happy coach is any
indication of good fortunes ahead,
then Stanford's junior varsity
football team may not be such an
underdog this afternoon when the
Cards open their JV season against
UCLA. Kickoff is set for 2 p.m. at
Stanford stadium.
First-year head man Gunther
Cunningham had been concerned
about the morale of those
upperclassmen who are to play
with his basically freshman unit,
but after the squad's first practice
together he said, "Fve never been
happier than I was Friday. I've
never seen more enthusiasm than
that JV team had."
And, Cunningham says,"The
enthusiasm part [of football] is
what I'm looking for 1 ."
Contributing to Cunningham's
own ardor is the fact that Mike
Cordova, a freshman who has seen
limited varsity action, will
quarterback his team today.
Cordova was Parade Magazine's
first team high school
Ail-American quarterback last
year.
Because his entire unit has
been practicing together only
since Friday, Cunningham is
relying mainly on his players'
enthusiasm and ability to carry
the squad against a UCLA outfit
which he says has been at work
since August 27. "We haven't had
much time to work on timing and
a kicking game," he cites as
examples.
Bulging Roster
UCLA, Cunningham says, has
approximately the same number
of "quality" recruits [15] as does
Stanford, but the Bruins have a

greater number of lesser talents on
their bulging roster.
Looking beyond Friday's
contest, Cunningham sees USC in
the same "quality not quantity"
mold as Stanford, and California
"in the same boat as we are, with
many two-way players."
Winning football games,
however, is not what Cunningham
9ees as his only goal. He seeks to
provide a "farming system for the
varsity" in case of injury on that
squad, to "make it [football] fun
for them [the players]," and,
above all, to build loyalty to
Stanford among his players.
"We [the coaches] remind the
players that they're not playing
for themselves or for us, but for
Stanford."
Top Prospects
Among those players,
Cunningham spotlights as his top
offensive prospects are Don
Stevenson, 210-pound fullback
("as good as any I've seen"), wide
receiver Ron Himes, running back
Marvin Holmes ("extremely quick
and fast"), center Ken Shropshire,
Ron Goss ("an All-State tackle,
our top offensive line prospect"),
and halfback Tom Oberhelman, a
walk-on from Gunn High who
made the Southern Peninsula
Athletic League's "Team of the
Decade."
Also Cunningham sees Andy
Kolesnikow possibly moving
down from varsity, in which case
Stevenson would shift to
halfback.
On defense, the coach is
impressed by linebacker Roger
Greer, short safety Rich Waters,
free safety Mike Conner, Duncan

McColl ("an outstanding
prospect"), and John Olenchalk, a
walk-on whom Cunningham
describes as a "mean, ornery kid"
at linebacker.
Cunningham expects Greer,
Olenchalk, and Shropshire to play
both offense and defense Friday.
"We've had a lot of walk-ons
[unrecruited players] that I'm
really impressed with," the coach
said, crediting the image of
Stanford's football program for
attracting the unexpected talent.
Tough To Adjust
"It's taken me a long time to
adjust from the high-powered
program I came from,"says
Cunningham, who moved from
Arkansas after previous service at
Oregon.
"At Arkansas it's all football.
Here there's other things. We

don't practice that long — the kids
pick things up faster.
"The student athletes here are
intelligent and easy to coach if
you can communicate. They learn
faster than anyone I've ever
coached."
The big problem, Cunningham
says, is to get the older players to
understand that playing JV is no
degradation, that it allows the
third stringer to get game
experience which prepares him for
varsity ball. "They get pressure
from their peer group and
parents" to play varsity now, he
says.
Becasue a purely-freshman
team, as Stanford had until this
year, is "obsolete," according to
Cunningham, the coach is going to
have instill that cherished
"enthusiasm" in his older players,
too. He gets his first test today.

but after the squad's first practice
together he said, "Fve never been
happier than I was Friday. I've
never seen more enthusiasm than
that JV team had."
And, Cunningham says,"The
enthusiasm part [of football] is
what I'm looking for 1 ."
Contributing to Cunningham's
own ardor is the fact that Mike
Cordova, a freshman who has seen
limited varsity action, will
quarterback his team today.
Cordova was Parade Magazine's
first team high school
Ail-American quarterback last
year.
Because his entire unit has
been practicing together only
since Friday, Cunningham is
relying mainly on his players'
enthusiasm and ability to carry
the squad against a UCLA outfit
which he says has been at work
since August 27. "We haven't had
much time to work on timing and
a kicking game," he cites as
examples.
Bulging Roster
UCLA, Cunningham says, has
approximately the same number
of "quality" recruits [15] as does
Stanford, but the Bruins have a

greater number of lesser talents on
their bulging roster.
Looking beyond Friday's
contest, Cunningham sees USC in
the same "quality not quantity"
mold as Stanford, and California
"in the same boat as we are, with
many two-way players."
Winning football games,
however, is not what Cunningham
9ees as his only goal. He seeks to
provide a "farming system for the
varsity" in case of injury on that
squad, to "make it [football] fun
for them [the players]," and,
above all, to build loyalty to
Stanford among his players.
"We [the coaches] remind the
players that they're not playing
for themselves or for us, but for
Stanford."
Top Prospects
Among those players,
Cunningham spotlights as his top
offensive prospects are Don
Stevenson, 210-pound fullback
("as good as any I've seen"), wide
receiver Ron Himes, running back
Marvin Holmes ("extremely quick
and fast"), center Ken Shropshire,
Ron Goss ("an All-State tackle,
our top offensive line prospect"),
and halfback Tom Oberhelman, a
walk-on from Gunn High who
made the Southern Peninsula
Athletic League's "Team of the
Decade."
Also Cunningham sees Andy
Kolesnikow possibly moving
down from varsity, in which case
Stevenson would shift to
halfback.
On defense, the coach is
impressed by linebacker Roger
Greer, short safety Rich Waters,
free safety Mike Conner, Duncan

McColl ("an outstanding
prospect"), and John Olenchalk, a
walk-on whom Cunningham
describes as a "mean, ornery kid"
at linebacker.
Cunningham expects Greer,
Olenchalk, and Shropshire to play
both offense and defense Friday.
"We've had a lot of walk-ons
[unrecruited players] that I'm
really impressed with," the coach
said, crediting the image of
Stanford's football program for
attracting the unexpected talent.
Tough To Adjust
"It's taken me a long time to
adjust from the high-powered
program I came from,"says
Cunningham, who moved from
Arkansas after previous service at
Oregon.
"At Arkansas it's all football.
Here there's other things. We

don't practice that long — the kids
pick things up faster.
"The student athletes here are
intelligent and easy to coach if
you can communicate. They learn
faster than anyone I've ever
coached."
The big problem, Cunningham
says, is to get the older players to
understand that playing JV is no
degradation, that it allows the
third stringer to get game
experience which prepares him for
varsity ball. "They get pressure
from their peer group and
parents" to play varsity now, he
says.
Becasue a purely-freshman
team, as Stanford had until this
year, is "obsolete," according to
Cunningham, the coach is going to
have instill that cherished
"enthusiasm" in his older players,
too. He gets his first test today.
If a happy coach is any
indication of good fortunes ahead,
then Stanford's junior varsity
football team may not be such an
underdog this afternoon when the
Cards open their JV season against
UCLA. Kickoff is set for 2 p.m. at
Stanford stadium.
First-year head man Gunther
Cunningham had been concerned
about the morale of those
upperclassmen who are to play
with his basically freshman unit,
but after the squad's first practice
together he said, "Fve never been
happier than I was Friday. I've
never seen more enthusiasm than
that JV team had."
And, Cunningham says,"The
