# Overseas Studies Finance Chief Seeks Outside Money Sources

MAIDENHEAD, England - The
financial manager of Stanford's
overseas campuses said here that a
suffering currency exchange rate and
rising prices abroad are forcing the
University to seek outside aid to hold
costs to students at their present
levels.
Don Price, associate director for
overseas program finance and budget
planning, explained that living costs
are so high in Austria, where a new
overseas studies center is planned, that
some kind of governmental or
foundation assistance is imperative.
And he added that the dismal financial
picture in Germany means that more
changes will have to be made if
Stanford is to retain its overseas
campus there.
Price made the comments in an
interview at Stanford in Britain as he

prepared to return to Palo Alto
following consultations in Germany
with the holder of the lease on the
German campus building.
He repeatedly emphasized that he
and Overseas Studies Director Mark
Mancall have "no intention of
changing the amount that students pay
for their room and board overseas."
This room and board bill, called the
overseas fee, is exactly the same as
quarterly room and board costs at the
home campus. "We have no intention
of changing that formula," Price
insisted.
But at no campus abroad does the
overseas fee actually pay for all of a
student's lodging and meals. The gap is
widest in Germany, where the $475
per quarter students pay makes up less
than half of the amount that it costs
to feed and house them.
"The campus program in
Beutelsbach is almost untenably

expensive and beyond Stanford's
means," Price observed. Specifically,
Price said that the German mark has
gone from 3.20 per dollar to 2.40.
That change, coupled with rampant
German inflation, will cost the
University about $100,000 more this
year than last.
The difference is paid by using
some of the money that was budgeted
for the now-disbanded Stanford
campus in Austria. "Next year the
University will use all the budgeted
Austrian money to carry the other
four campuses. Money that used to
pay for five overseas programs will
then cover only four, because of
revaluation and inflation," Price
noted.
"In the long run, we can operate
the German program only if we get
some kind of subsidy from the
German government or a private
foundation." He declined to say
publicly whether or not he was able to
secure lower rent on Stanford in
Germany during his negotiations.
While suggesting that some major
changes there might be imminent, he
would not comment on any plans
currently under discussion. "We are
committed to a program in Germany,"
Price said, while adding that some kind
of debate over its future is ahead.
Vienna Negotiations
In Austria, Price said, negotiations
continue with the government and
officials of the University of Vienna.
The former Stanford in Austria
campus was closed down at the end of
summer quarter, but three
administrators have been retained to
help set up a new study program there.
"We are hoping for some response
from the Ministry of Education saying
whether the government can grant us
student housing at the University of
Vienna," Price said. He explained that
the Austrian unit of money, the
schilling, is "just as expensive as the
German mark," and that subsidy is
vital to keep housing and food costs at
the Stanford level.
If the Education Ministry grants
Stanford's request, Price said, the new
Vienna program may be ready for
students as early as September, 1974.
The idea of government or
foundation subsidies for Stanford's
overseas programs is not new. Price
noted that the French government
pays the University four francs (about
