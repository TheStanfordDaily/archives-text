# Pac-8 Predictions
## 
### 
After compiling an 11-2-1
record during two weeks of
nonconference action (except
for two prematurely scheduled
league games last week), the
Daily's fearless forecaster is
ready to issue his predictions
for the first full slate of Pacific
Eight games.
USC hosts Washington State
and should extend its unbeaten
stnng to 22 games without
much trouble. California meets
win/ess Oregon, and Cat's
explosive (sometimes) offense
should be enough to keep that
zero in the Ducks' win column
intact. However, Cat coach
Mike White warns that Oregon
is "making a crusade out of
this game."
Oregon State meets
Washington in Seattle in a
contest that may outshine last
week's 54-49 circus between
Cat and Washington. Oregon

State quarterback Alvin White
(the league's leading passer) has
already put the ball in the air
179 times in four games and
Washington quarterback Chris
Rowland tied Craig Morton's
Pac-8 record last week with
five touchdown passes. The
Beavers should win a wild one.
Here at Stanford, of course,
the explosive UCLA Wishbone
will test Stanford's stingy
defense. That contest should
be a standoff, but when
Stanford has the ball, the
Bruins will have a definite
advantage. You never know
what will happen when
Stanford is the underdog, but
the Daily picks UCLA to win a
squeaker.
UCLA 24, Stanford 20
USC 28, Washington St 10
Oregon State 38, Washington 35
California 33, Oregon 14
