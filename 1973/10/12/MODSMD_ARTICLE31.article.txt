# Shuffling The Cards
## Race For Roses Begins 
### Dave Robinson 
All the interactional battles, Eastern trips and
television exposure probably didn't prove much
about the upcoming Pacific Eight football season,
but before the conference begins its serious business
tomorrow, it may be possible to draw the following
conclusions from those four weeks of
nonconference action.
1.) The Pac-8 overall is abnormally weak.
2.) A team from Los Angeles will win the 1973
conference championship.
3.) Oregon, Oregon State and Washington should
engage in a thrilling battle for last place.
The Pac-B's prestige has obviously been shattered
by the league's dismal 10-17-1 record against
nonconference opposition, but John McKay's USC
Trojans need only to repeat as Rose Bowl
champions to regain that lost prominence.
USC may do just that. Even though the Trojans
have been relatively inactive offensively while
compiling a 3-0-1 record so far this year, they have
held their opponents to a microscopic average of 5.0
points per game. Even an ignorant fan could
conclude that all USC needs is one Anthony Davis
touchdown to eclipse that figure.
Davis, the shifty Trojan halfback who is probably
the nation's leading Heisman Trophy candidate,
matter of factly assesses his chances to win the
coveted trophy. "Maybe I'll win it,"he says."I sure
hope I don't screw up and blow everything."
It will take considerable screwing up for the
Trojan team to blow the Pac-8 championship.
If USC does blow it somewhere along the way,
UCLA would be league's most likely Rose Bowl
representative. The Bruin Wishbone has accounted
for an average of 342.3 yards per game on the
ground, despite a subpar performance against
Nebraska in UCLA's season-opening loss to the
Cornhuskers.
The Bruins are averaging 51.7 a game since the
disaster in Lincoln, Neb., a figure that prompted
coach Pepper Rodgers to comment to the press last
week, "Gentlemen, we really have a pretty good
football team."
Stanford, with a bruising defense and a

questionable offense, will finish the season
somehwere between first and fifth place — most
likely second or third. But if the Cards can
somehow upset UCLA tomorrow, it might be wise
for Stanford fans to make preliminary reservations
in Pasadena.
About two months ago, just when all the
preseason polls were deciding that Washington State
was one of the top 20 teams in the nation, Cougar
coach Jim Sweeney exclaimed, "We've put together
a superfeeling of togetherness and goal
orientation."
Of course that was before WSU began a brutal
schedule that includes Arizona State tad a
four-week succession of nightmares (Ohio State,
USC, UCLA, and Stanford) which began last week.
Right now the Cougars are 1-3 and struggling, but
they might recover around Nov. 3 in time to record
a few Pac-8 victories.
California, after losing to Alabama 66-0,
defeating Army 51-6 and outlasting Washington
54-49, is ridiculously unpredictable. Fickle Bear
coach Mike White is now bubbling with enthusiasm,
but it's doubtful that Cal will be able to maintain its
offensive momentum long enough to post a winning
conference record.
At the bottom of the standings, Oregon, Oregon
State and Washington will at least thrill their fans
with weekly aerial acrobatics (all three teams prefer
the forward pass). But minor factors like lack of
blocking and defense should keep the weekly results
in the loss column.

representative. The Bruin Wishbone has accounted
for an average of 342.3 yards per game on the
ground, despite a subpar performance against
Nebraska in UCLA's season-opening loss to the
Cornhuskers.
The Bruins are averaging 51.7 a game since the
disaster in Lincoln, Neb., a figure that prompted
coach Pepper Rodgers to comment to the press last
week, "Gentlemen, we really have a pretty good
football team."
Stanford, with a bruising defense and a

questionable offense, will finish the season
somehwere between first and fifth place — most
likely second or third. But if the Cards can
somehow upset UCLA tomorrow, it might be wise
for Stanford fans to make preliminary reservations
in Pasadena.
About two months ago, just when all the
preseason polls were deciding that Washington State
was one of the top 20 teams in the nation, Cougar
coach Jim Sweeney exclaimed, "We've put together
a superfeeling of togetherness and goal
orientation."
Of course that was before WSU began a brutal
schedule that includes Arizona State tad a
four-week succession of nightmares (Ohio State,
USC, UCLA, and Stanford) which began last week.
Right now the Cougars are 1-3 and struggling, but
they might recover around Nov. 3 in time to record
a few Pac-8 victories.
California, after losing to Alabama 66-0,
defeating Army 51-6 and outlasting Washington
54-49, is ridiculously unpredictable. Fickle Bear
coach Mike White is now bubbling with enthusiasm,
but it's doubtful that Cal will be able to maintain its
offensive momentum long enough to post a winning
conference record.
At the bottom of the standings, Oregon, Oregon
State and Washington will at least thrill their fans
with weekly aerial acrobatics (all three teams prefer
the forward pass). But minor factors like lack of
blocking and defense should keep the weekly results
in the loss column.
All the interactional battles, Eastern trips and
television exposure probably didn't prove much
about the upcoming Pacific Eight football season,
but before the conference begins its serious business
tomorrow, it may be possible to draw the following
conclusions from those four weeks of
nonconference action.
1.) The Pac-8 overall is abnormally weak.
2.) A team from Los Angeles will win the 1973
conference championship.
3.) Oregon, Oregon State and Washington should
engage in a thrilling battle for last place.
The Pac-B's prestige has obviously been shattered
by the league's dismal 10-17-1 record against
nonconference opposition, but John McKay's USC
Trojans need only to repeat as Rose Bowl
champions to regain that lost prominence.
USC may do just that. Even though the Trojans
have been relatively inactive offensively while
compiling a 3-0-1 record so far this year, they have
held their opponents to a microscopic average of 5.0
points per game. Even an ignorant fan could
conclude that all USC needs is one Anthony Davis
touchdown to eclipse that figure.
Davis, the shifty Trojan halfback who is probably
the nation's leading Heisman Trophy candidate,
matter of factly assesses his chances to win the
coveted trophy. "Maybe I'll win it,"he says."I sure
hope I don't screw up and blow everything."
It will take considerable screwing up for the
Trojan team to blow the Pac-8 championship.
If USC does blow it somewhere along the way,
UCLA would be league's most likely Rose Bowl
representative. The Bruin Wishbone has accounted
for an average of 342.3 yards per game on the
ground, despite a subpar performance against
Nebraska in UCLA's season-opening loss to the
Cornhuskers.
