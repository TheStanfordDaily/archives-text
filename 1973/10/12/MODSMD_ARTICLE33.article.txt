# Fullback Scott Laidlaw
## Married Cardinal Enjoys Life, Football 
### MARK WHITE 
For some college students, a college career is a study
in asceticism and self-denial. Hedonistic pursuits are
shunned in favor of devotion to academics. Marriage and a
comfortable home are foregone for martial living
quarters and relative isolation from members of the
opposite sex.
Not so in the case of Scott Laidlaw, Stanford's 215
pound junior fullback, who has, you could say, his cake
and eats it too.
Laidlaw doesn't hole himself up in a cement enclave
at Wilbur Hall and he doesn't have a roommate with
whom he can only share chemistry notes. Scott Laidlaw
is married and lives in a comfortable Escondido Village
apartment with his attractive wife, Michele. It is an
enviable situation not many athletes enjoy.
"We are quite happy living here," Scott said. "Since
Stanford gave me a good scholarship package and since
Michele works for the school, we haven't had to face the
financial problems most married college students face.
Marriage has been a great thing for us and it has made
my life more complete."
Scott's comfortable life style at Stanford capped a
successful athletic career at Hawthorne High in
Inglewood. As a former quarterback converted to
running back. Laidlaw gained over 1400 yards in nine
games, scored 14 touchdowns and was named his
league's most valuable player his senior year.
North-South Shrine Game
He also played defensive back in the prestigious 1971
North-South Shrine game with such Pacific Eight
standouts as Pat Haden, J.K. McKay, Anthony Davis and
Forrie Martin. In that game he had 12 tackles and two
interceptions.
Laidlaw's ascent to a starting varsity position was
thwarted by a ripped up knee his freshman year, but he
came off the only major injury of his career to play
behind Reggie Sanderson last season at fullback. His 5.6
yard per carry average in 1972 tabbed him as the leading
fullback candidate for this year.
Offensive backfield coach David Cunrey describes
Laidlaw as "a slashing runner, not an Anthony Davis,
but more along the lines of a Paul Homung.
"He has most improved on his blocking," Currey
points out, "and with that dimension, added to his
excellent balance, good hurdler body lean and speed, he
should be one of Stanford's finest fullbacks."

While Stanford hasn't been able to run effectively this
year, Currey feels this is to be anticipated because of the
Cardinals' dependence on the pass.
Two Basic Methods
"Against teams like USC there are two basic ways
you can play them. One is to run straight at them and
try to better them strength versus strength. To do this
and win, you have to have equal depth and strength
across the board. We don't have that kind of depth, so
we pass, which will maximize our chances of victory.
"Since we spend over 50 percent of our time on

pass-blocking and patterns, it's no wonder our ground
game has developed slowly, especially considering how
young our line is."
Laidlaw agrees. "At first the line was having trouble
with its blocking assignments; they didn't know who to
block, especially on blitzes. Their confidence has grown
enormously in the last two games since they now
pass-block areas instead of men.
"Now, this rise in confidence should lead to a better
inside running attack. As the blocking improves and the
holes get larger, we'll get more yardage."
Laidlaw expects most of this yardage to come on
plays up the middle, since the Stanford line is fairly
stationary and doesn't move a great deal for sweeps.
"Since our offense is geared for straight ahead plays, I
don't think the loss of Johnny Winesberry will hurt our
running game as much as some people think it will. We'll
miss him a lot as an outside pass threat, but not up the
middle.
Winesberry At Marker
"In the first place, I think and a lot of the offensive
team thought, that John should have been used as a
flanker, where he could take advantage of his deceptive
speed and quick moves.
"Running up the middle, as John had to do in our
offense, took away his breakaway abilities. He's just not
built to take the punishment of going straight into the
line — he only weighs 190 pounds.
"And his style of running in heavy traffic around the
line left him vulnerable to leg, ankle and knee injuries.
You have to run straight ahead and be willing to run
over people in order to run up the middle — John just
isn't that type of runner.
"That's why I think Sig Ostrom and Doug Jena will
help make our insde running work. They are both big
and can take that inside punishment."
Can Stanford run, and win, against UCLA's five man
defensive line? Laidlaw thinks so.
"We think UCLA's defensive line is the most
favorable one to us we've seen so far this year and we've
worked real hard this week on running plays designed to
take advantage of the lateral movement and quickness of
their ends.
"I think we can win the league if we get by UCLA.
But first we've got to be able to block our men. If we do
that, we'll be able to run, and if we run, we'll win."

But first we've got to be able to block our men. If we do
that, we'll be able to run, and if we run, we'll win."

LOOKING FOR DAYLIGHT—Stanford fullback Scott
Laidlaw (33) takes the handoff from quarterback Mike
Boryla and heads upfield. Laidlaw leads the Cardinal
ballcarriers with 116 yards in 35 carries.
For some college students, a college career is a study
in asceticism and self-denial. Hedonistic pursuits are
shunned in favor of devotion to academics. Marriage and a
comfortable home are foregone for martial living
quarters and relative isolation from members of the
opposite sex.
Not so in the case of Scott Laidlaw, Stanford's 215
pound junior fullback, who has, you could say, his cake
and eats it too.
Laidlaw doesn't hole himself up in a cement enclave
at Wilbur Hall and he doesn't have a roommate with
whom he can only share chemistry notes. Scott Laidlaw
is married and lives in a comfortable Escondido Village
apartment with his attractive wife, Michele. It is an
enviable situation not many athletes enjoy.
"We are quite happy living here," Scott said. "Since
Stanford gave me a good scholarship package and since
Michele works for the school, we haven't had to face the
financial problems most married college students face.
Marriage has been a great thing for us and it has made
my life more complete."
Scott's comfortable life style at Stanford capped a
successful athletic career at Hawthorne High in
Inglewood. As a former quarterback converted to
running back. Laidlaw gained over 1400 yards in nine
games, scored 14 touchdowns and was named his
league's most valuable player his senior year.
North-South Shrine Game
He also played defensive back in the prestigious 1971
North-South Shrine game with such Pacific Eight
standouts as Pat Haden, J.K. McKay, Anthony Davis and
Forrie Martin. In that game he had 12 tackles and two
interceptions.
Laidlaw's ascent to a starting varsity position was
thwarted by a ripped up knee his freshman year, but he
came off the only major injury of his career to play
behind Reggie Sanderson last season at fullback. His 5.6
yard per carry average in 1972 tabbed him as the leading
fullback candidate for this year.
Offensive backfield coach David Cunrey describes
Laidlaw as "a slashing runner, not an Anthony Davis,
but more along the lines of a Paul Homung.
"He has most improved on his blocking," Currey
points out, "and with that dimension, added to his
excellent balance, good hurdler body lean and speed, he
should be one of Stanford's finest fullbacks."

While Stanford hasn't been able to run effectively this
year, Currey feels this is to be anticipated because of the
Cardinals' dependence on the pass.
Two Basic Methods
"Against teams like USC there are two basic ways
you can play them. One is to run straight at them and
try to better them strength versus strength. To do this
and win, you have to have equal depth and strength
across the board. We don't have that kind of depth, so
we pass, which will maximize our chances of victory.
"Since we spend over 50 percent of our time on

pass-blocking and patterns, it's no wonder our ground
game has developed slowly, especially considering how
young our line is."
Laidlaw agrees. "At first the line was having trouble
with its blocking assignments; they didn't know who to
block, especially on blitzes. Their confidence has grown
enormously in the last two games since they now
pass-block areas instead of men.
"Now, this rise in confidence should lead to a better
inside running attack. As the blocking improves and the
holes get larger, we'll get more yardage."
Laidlaw expects most of this yardage to come on
plays up the middle, since the Stanford line is fairly
stationary and doesn't move a great deal for sweeps.
"Since our offense is geared for straight ahead plays, I
don't think the loss of Johnny Winesberry will hurt our
running game as much as some people think it will. We'll
miss him a lot as an outside pass threat, but not up the
middle.
Winesberry At Marker
"In the first place, I think and a lot of the offensive
team thought, that John should have been used as a
flanker, where he could take advantage of his deceptive
speed and quick moves.
"Running up the middle, as John had to do in our
offense, took away his breakaway abilities. He's just not
built to take the punishment of going straight into the
line — he only weighs 190 pounds.
"And his style of running in heavy traffic around the
line left him vulnerable to leg, ankle and knee injuries.
You have to run straight ahead and be willing to run
over people in order to run up the middle — John just
isn't that type of runner.
"That's why I think Sig Ostrom and Doug Jena will
help make our insde running work. They are both big
and can take that inside punishment."
Can Stanford run, and win, against UCLA's five man
defensive line? Laidlaw thinks so.
"We think UCLA's defensive line is the most
favorable one to us we've seen so far this year and we've
worked real hard this week on running plays designed to
take advantage of the lateral movement and quickness of
their ends.
"I think we can win the league if we get by UCLA.
But first we've got to be able to block our men. If we do
that, we'll be able to run, and if we run, we'll win."

and can take that inside punishment."
Can Stanford run, and win, against UCLA's five man
defensive line? Laidlaw thinks so.
"We think UCLA's defensive line is the most
favorable one to us we've seen so far this year and we've
worked real hard this week on running plays designed to
take advantage of the lateral movement and quickness of
their ends.
"I think we can win the league if we get by UCLA.
But first we've got to be able to block our men. If we do
that, we'll be able to run, and if we run, we'll win."

LOOKING FOR DAYLIGHT—Stanford fullback Scott
Laidlaw (33) takes the handoff from quarterback Mike
Boryla and heads upfield. Laidlaw leads the Cardinal
ballcarriers with 116 yards in 35 carries.
For some college students, a college career is a study
in asceticism and self-denial. Hedonistic pursuits are
shunned in favor of devotion to academics. Marriage and a
comfortable home are foregone for martial living
quarters and relative isolation from members of the
opposite sex.
Not so in the case of Scott Laidlaw, Stanford's 215
pound junior fullback, who has, you could say, his cake
and eats it too.
Laidlaw doesn't hole himself up in a cement enclave
at Wilbur Hall and he doesn't have a roommate with
whom he can only share chemistry notes. Scott Laidlaw
is married and lives in a comfortable Escondido Village
apartment with his attractive wife, Michele. It is an
enviable situation not many athletes enjoy.
"We are quite happy living here," Scott said. "Since
Stanford gave me a good scholarship package and since
Michele works for the school, we haven't had to face the
financial problems most married college students face.
Marriage has been a great thing for us and it has made
my life more complete."
Scott's comfortable life style at Stanford capped a
successful athletic career at Hawthorne High in
Inglewood. As a former quarterback converted to
running back. Laidlaw gained over 1400 yards in nine
games, scored 14 touchdowns and was named his
league's most valuable player his senior year.
North-South Shrine Game
He also played defensive back in the prestigious 1971
North-South Shrine game with such Pacific Eight
standouts as Pat Haden, J.K. McKay, Anthony Davis and
Forrie Martin. In that game he had 12 tackles and two
interceptions.
Laidlaw's ascent to a starting varsity position was
thwarted by a ripped up knee his freshman year, but he
came off the only major injury of his career to play
behind Reggie Sanderson last season at fullback. His 5.6
yard per carry average in 1972 tabbed him as the leading
fullback candidate for this year.
Offensive backfield coach David Cunrey describes
Laidlaw as "a slashing runner, not an Anthony Davis,
but more along the lines of a Paul Homung.
"He has most improved on his blocking," Currey
points out, "and with that dimension, added to his
excellent balance, good hurdler body lean and speed, he
should be one of Stanford's finest fullbacks."

While Stanford hasn't been able to run effectively this
year, Currey feels this is to be anticipated because of the
Cardinals' dependence on the pass.
Two Basic Methods
"Against teams like USC there are two basic ways
you can play them. One is to run straight at them and
try to better them strength versus strength. To do this
and win, you have to have equal depth and strength
across the board. We don't have that kind of depth, so
we pass, which will maximize our chances of victory.
"Since we spend over 50 percent of our time on

pass-blocking and patterns, it's no wonder our ground
game has developed slowly, especially considering how
young our line is."
Laidlaw agrees. "At first the line was having trouble
with its blocking assignments; they didn't know who to
block, especially on blitzes. Their confidence has grown
enormously in the last two games since they now
pass-block areas instead of men.
"Now, this rise in confidence should lead to a better
inside running attack. As the blocking improves and the
holes get larger, we'll get more yardage."
Laidlaw expects most of this yardage to come on
plays up the middle, since the Stanford line is fairly
stationary and doesn't move a great deal for sweeps.
"Since our offense is geared for straight ahead plays, I
don't think the loss of Johnny Winesberry will hurt our
running game as much as some people think it will. We'll
miss him a lot as an outside pass threat, but not up the
middle.
Winesberry At Marker
"In the first place, I think and a lot of the offensive
team thought, that John should have been used as a
flanker, where he could take advantage of his deceptive
speed and quick moves.
"Running up the middle, as John had to do in our
offense, took away his breakaway abilities. He's just not
built to take the punishment of going straight into the
line — he only weighs 190 pounds.
"And his style of running in heavy traffic around the
line left him vulnerable to leg, ankle and knee injuries.
You have to run straight ahead and be willing to run
over people in order to run up the middle — John just
isn't that type of runner.
"That's why I think Sig Ostrom and Doug Jena will
help make our insde running work. They are both big
and can take that inside punishment."
