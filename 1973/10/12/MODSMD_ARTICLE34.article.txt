Three Share Nobel Prize
STOCKHOLM — Three pioneers in research on
behavioral patterns shared the 1973 Nobel Prize for
Medicine or Physiology yesterday. Their studies of birds
and bees helped explain an infant's first smile and sexual
and aggressive drives in animals and humans.
Splitting the $120,000 prize were two retired Austrian
professors who worked in Germany, and a Dutch
zoologist who tested their findings in experiments at
Oxford, England.
The faculty of the Karolinska Medical Institute cited
Viennese-born Profs. Karl Ritter von Frisch, 86, and
Konrad Lorenz, 69, and Dutchman Nikolaas Tinbergen,
66, for "their discoveries concerning organization and
elicitation of individual and social behavior patterns."
They were described by the awarding body as the most
eminent founders of a new science called ethology. Its
name is taken from the Greek word for habit or manner,
and it concerns the comparative study of behavior.
Mitchell, Stans Accused
NEW YORK — The government accused former
cabinet members John Mitchell and Maurice Stans
yesterday of trying to torpedo the conspiracy case against
them by their demand for White House tape recordings.
Asst. U.S. Atty. Thomas Day Edwards argued in
Manhattan federal court against a defense subpoena for
the tapes, accusing the opposing lawyers of seeking to
"rummage at will through the files of government
offices."
'They desperately hope," Edwards told Judge Lee
Gagliardi, "that they can somehow allege enough ... to
cause this court to require the production of some
item... as to which the White House legal staff,
consistent with the position they have taken on the
Watergate grand jury investigation, will feel compelled to
invoke executive privilege."
He said, "Upon the consummation of this ... event,
they then hope to argue that sanctions should be imposed
upon the government in this case, presumably that the
testimony of one or more government witnesses be
stricken or. .. that this prosecution be dismissed."
Mankiewicz Blasts GOP
WASHINGTON — Sen. George McGovern's former
political director testified yesterday that Nixon campaign
dirty tricks contributed to the Democratic party's 1972
wounds.
"What was created by the sabotage effort was an
unparalleled atmosphere of rancor and discord within the
Democratic party," Frank Mankiewicz told the Senate
Watergate committee.
Republican witnesses have claimed that the
anti-Democratic sabotage added little to President Nixon's
landslide victory over McGovern.
But Mankiewicz said Sen. Edmund S. Muskie's backers
told him they blamed McGovern for anti-Muskie sabotage
in the New Hampshire Democratic presidential primary.
He said false leaflets were distributed during the crucial
California primary, leading McGovern and Sen. Hubert H.
Humphrey to suspect each other of a "vicious campaign
of distortion and vilification." He said this may have led
to Humphrey's attempt to claim some California delegates
won by McGovern.
He said a fake, insulting telephone call to AFL-CIO
President George Meany may have contributed to Meany's
decision to withhold the giant labor organization's
backing from McGovern.
Mankiewicz said the purpose of the sabotage seemed to
be to "create within the Democratic party such a strong
sense of resentment among the candidates and their

followers as to make unity of the party impossible once a
nominee was selected."
"At that, the effort seems to have been most
successful," he said in a prepared opening statement.
Nixon Urged To Release Tapes
WASHINGTON — Rep. Jerome R. Waldie of California
said yesterday that Congress should insist that President
Nixon release the Watergate tapes before his nominee for
vice president is approved.
Waldie, who is running for the Democratic nomination
for California governor, said the confirmation of a
nominee to succeed Spiro T. Agnew might be the most
important decision ever made by a member of the House.
"Therefore, we ought not to assume the responsibility
lightly," Waldie said in a brief speech on the House floor.
"I believe that Congress should insist as a condition
precedent to approval of his nominee that President
Nixon reveal the contents of the disputed Watergate
tapes," he said.
"Only then can the Congress and the country be
reassured as to the integrity of the President as well as his
vice president."
Waldie, a member of the House Judiciary Committee,
criticized some of the President's past choices and said:
"The judgment of the President in selecting people to fill
high positions has been demonstrably defective.
"Two of his former cabinet members are under
indictment and a vice president selected by him has
resigned because of criminal activity," he said.
Conferees Approve Arms Bills
WASHINGTON — Senate-House conferees agreed
yesterday on a $21.3 billion weapons procurement bill
without a requirement for overseas troop cuts.
The conference agreed to a 43,000-man reduction in
over-all U.S. armed forces strength in place of the 156,100
reduction voted by the Senate for the coming year.
In place of a 110,000 overseas troop withdrawal by
Dec. 31, 1975, as voted by the Senate, the conferees
agreed on a reduction based on balance of payments
deficit resulting from U.S. force levels in Europe.
The amendment by Sens. Henry M. Jackson, D-Wash.,
and Sam Nunn, D-Ga., included in the compromise bill
would require reductions in U.S. troops in Europe in
proportion to the percentage failure of the NATO allies to
offset a balance of payments deficit amounting to about
$1.5 billion.
Oakland Captures AL Crown
OAKLAND — The Oakland Athletics beat the
Baltimore Orioles 3-0 on the five-hit pitching of Jim
"Catfish" Hunter for the American League pennant
yesterday and will open defense of their World Series title
at home Saturday against the New York Mets.
Hunter, the A's top pitcher the past three seasons,
struck out only one Baltimore batter and walked two in
the decisive fifth game of the playoffs. He didn't allow a
hit until Andy Etchebarren's two-out double in the fifth.
Joe Rudi got the A's off to a 1-0 lead when he drove in
Ray Fosse in the third. The A's other scores came in the
fourth inning off starter Doyle Alexander when Vic
Davillio and Jesus Alou drove in runs, driving Alexander
from the mound in favor of Jim Palmer.

Mitchell, Stans Accused
NEW YORK — The government accused former
cabinet members John Mitchell and Maurice Stans
yesterday of trying to torpedo the conspiracy case against
them by their demand for White House tape recordings.
Asst. U.S. Atty. Thomas Day Edwards argued in
Manhattan federal court against a defense subpoena for
the tapes, accusing the opposing lawyers of seeking to
"rummage at will through the files of government
offices."
'They desperately hope," Edwards told Judge Lee
Gagliardi, "that they can somehow allege enough ... to
cause this court to require the production of some
item... as to which the White House legal staff,
consistent with the position they have taken on the
Watergate grand jury investigation, will feel compelled to
invoke executive privilege."
He said, "Upon the consummation of this ... event,
they then hope to argue that sanctions should be imposed
upon the government in this case, presumably that the
testimony of one or more government witnesses be
stricken or. .. that this prosecution be dismissed."
Mankiewicz Blasts GOP
WASHINGTON — Sen. George McGovern's former
political director testified yesterday that Nixon campaign
dirty tricks contributed to the Democratic party's 1972
wounds.
"What was created by the sabotage effort was an
unparalleled atmosphere of rancor and discord within the
Democratic party," Frank Mankiewicz told the Senate
Watergate committee.
Republican witnesses have claimed that the
anti-Democratic sabotage added little to President Nixon's
landslide victory over McGovern.
But Mankiewicz said Sen. Edmund S. Muskie's backers
told him they blamed McGovern for anti-Muskie sabotage
in the New Hampshire Democratic presidential primary.
He said false leaflets were distributed during the crucial
California primary, leading McGovern and Sen. Hubert H.
Humphrey to suspect each other of a "vicious campaign
of distortion and vilification." He said this may have led
to Humphrey's attempt to claim some California delegates
won by McGovern.
He said a fake, insulting telephone call to AFL-CIO
President George Meany may have contributed to Meany's
decision to withhold the giant labor organization's
backing from McGovern.
Mankiewicz said the purpose of the sabotage seemed to
be to "create within the Democratic party such a strong
sense of resentment among the candidates and their

followers as to make unity of the party impossible once a
nominee was selected."
"At that, the effort seems to have been most
successful," he said in a prepared opening statement.
Nixon Urged To Release Tapes
WASHINGTON — Rep. Jerome R. Waldie of California
said yesterday that Congress should insist that President
Nixon release the Watergate tapes before his nominee for
vice president is approved.
Waldie, who is running for the Democratic nomination
for California governor, said the confirmation of a
nominee to succeed Spiro T. Agnew might be the most
important decision ever made by a member of the House.
"Therefore, we ought not to assume the responsibility
lightly," Waldie said in a brief speech on the House floor.
"I believe that Congress should insist as a condition
precedent to approval of his nominee that President
Nixon reveal the contents of the disputed Watergate
tapes," he said.
"Only then can the Congress and the country be
reassured as to the integrity of the President as well as his
vice president."
Waldie, a member of the House Judiciary Committee,
criticized some of the President's past choices and said:
"The judgment of the President in selecting people to fill
high positions has been demonstrably defective.
"Two of his former cabinet members are under
indictment and a vice president selected by him has
resigned because of criminal activity," he said.
Conferees Approve Arms Bills
WASHINGTON — Senate-House conferees agreed
yesterday on a $21.3 billion weapons procurement bill
without a requirement for overseas troop cuts.
The conference agreed to a 43,000-man reduction in
over-all U.S. armed forces strength in place of the 156,100
reduction voted by the Senate for the coming year.
In place of a 110,000 overseas troop withdrawal by
Dec. 31, 1975, as voted by the Senate, the conferees
agreed on a reduction based on balance of payments
deficit resulting from U.S. force levels in Europe.
The amendment by Sens. Henry M. Jackson, D-Wash.,
and Sam Nunn, D-Ga., included in the compromise bill
would require reductions in U.S. troops in Europe in
proportion to the percentage failure of the NATO allies to
offset a balance of payments deficit amounting to about
$1.5 billion.
Oakland Captures AL Crown
OAKLAND — The Oakland Athletics beat the
Baltimore Orioles 3-0 on the five-hit pitching of Jim
"Catfish" Hunter for the American League pennant
yesterday and will open defense of their World Series title
at home Saturday against the New York Mets.
Hunter, the A's top pitcher the past three seasons,
struck out only one Baltimore batter and walked two in
the decisive fifth game of the playoffs. He didn't allow a
hit until Andy Etchebarren's two-out double in the fifth.
Joe Rudi got the A's off to a 1-0 lead when he drove in
Ray Fosse in the third. The A's other scores came in the
fourth inning off starter Doyle Alexander when Vic
Davillio and Jesus Alou drove in runs, driving Alexander
from the mound in favor of Jim Palmer.

Three Share Nobel Prize
STOCKHOLM — Three pioneers in research on
behavioral patterns shared the 1973 Nobel Prize for
Medicine or Physiology yesterday. Their studies of birds
and bees helped explain an infant's first smile and sexual
and aggressive drives in animals and humans.
Splitting the $120,000 prize were two retired Austrian
professors who worked in Germany, and a Dutch
zoologist who tested their findings in experiments at
Oxford, England.
The faculty of the Karolinska Medical Institute cited
Viennese-born Profs. Karl Ritter von Frisch, 86, and

He said, "Upon the consummation of this ... event,
they then hope to argue that sanctions should be imposed
upon the government in this case, presumably that the
testimony of one or more government witnesses be
stricken or. .. that this prosecution be dismissed."
Mankiewicz Blasts GOP
WASHINGTON — Sen. George McGovern's former
political director testified yesterday that Nixon campaign
dirty tricks contributed to the Democratic party's 1972
wounds.
"What was created by the sabotage effort was an
unparalleled atmosphere of rancor and discord within the
Democratic party," Frank Mankiewicz told the Senate
Watergate committee.
Republican witnesses have claimed that the
anti-Democratic sabotage added little to President Nixon's
landslide victory over McGovern.
But Mankiewicz said Sen. Edmund S. Muskie's backers
told him they blamed McGovern for anti-Muskie sabotage
in the New Hampshire Democratic presidential primary.
He said false leaflets were distributed during the crucial
California primary, leading McGovern and Sen. Hubert H.
Humphrey to suspect each other of a "vicious campaign
of distortion and vilification." He said this may have led
to Humphrey's attempt to claim some California delegates
won by McGovern.
He said a fake, insulting telephone call to AFL-CIO
President George Meany may have contributed to Meany's
decision to withhold the giant labor organization's
backing from McGovern.
Mankiewicz said the purpose of the sabotage seemed to
be to "create within the Democratic party such a strong
sense of resentment among the candidates and their

followers as to make unity of the party impossible once a
nominee was selected."
"At that, the effort seems to have been most
successful," he said in a prepared opening statement.
Nixon Urged To Release Tapes
WASHINGTON — Rep. Jerome R. Waldie of California
said yesterday that Congress should insist that President
Nixon release the Watergate tapes before his nominee for
vice president is approved.
Waldie, who is running for the Democratic nomination
for California governor, said the confirmation of a
nominee to succeed Spiro T. Agnew might be the most
important decision ever made by a member of the House.
"Therefore, we ought not to assume the responsibility
lightly," Waldie said in a brief speech on the House floor.
"I believe that Congress should insist as a condition
precedent to approval of his nominee that President
Nixon reveal the contents of the disputed Watergate
tapes," he said.
"Only then can the Congress and the country be
reassured as to the integrity of the President as well as his
vice president."
Waldie, a member of the House Judiciary Committee,
criticized some of the President's past choices and said:
"The judgment of the President in selecting people to fill
high positions has been demonstrably defective.
"Two of his former cabinet members are under
indictment and a vice president selected by him has
resigned because of criminal activity," he said.
Conferees Approve Arms Bills
WASHINGTON — Senate-House conferees agreed
yesterday on a $21.3 billion weapons procurement bill
without a requirement for overseas troop cuts.
The conference agreed to a 43,000-man reduction in
over-all U.S. armed forces strength in place of the 156,100
reduction voted by the Senate for the coming year.
In place of a 110,000 overseas troop withdrawal by
Dec. 31, 1975, as voted by the Senate, the conferees
agreed on a reduction based on balance of payments
deficit resulting from U.S. force levels in Europe.
The amendment by Sens. Henry M. Jackson, D-Wash.,
and Sam Nunn, D-Ga., included in the compromise bill
would require reductions in U.S. troops in Europe in
proportion to the percentage failure of the NATO allies to
offset a balance of payments deficit amounting to about
$1.5 billion.
Oakland Captures AL Crown
OAKLAND — The Oakland Athletics beat the
Baltimore Orioles 3-0 on the five-hit pitching of Jim
"Catfish" Hunter for the American League pennant
yesterday and will open defense of their World Series title
at home Saturday against the New York Mets.
Hunter, the A's top pitcher the past three seasons,
struck out only one Baltimore batter and walked two in
the decisive fifth game of the playoffs. He didn't allow a
hit until Andy Etchebarren's two-out double in the fifth.
Joe Rudi got the A's off to a 1-0 lead when he drove in
Ray Fosse in the third. The A's other scores came in the
fourth inning off starter Doyle Alexander when Vic
Davillio and Jesus Alou drove in runs, driving Alexander
from the mound in favor of Jim Palmer.
Today's Weather
Fair through tomorrow but patches of early morning
fog. Low tonight 40s to low 50s. High today and

Three Share Nobel Prize
STOCKHOLM — Three pioneers in research on
behavioral patterns shared the 1973 Nobel Prize for
Medicine or Physiology yesterday. Their studies of birds
and bees helped explain an infant's first smile and sexual
and aggressive drives in animals and humans.
Splitting the $120,000 prize were two retired Austrian
professors who worked in Germany, and a Dutch
zoologist who tested their findings in experiments at
Oxford, England.
The faculty of the Karolinska Medical Institute cited
Viennese-born Profs. Karl Ritter von Frisch, 86, and
Konrad Lorenz, 69, and Dutchman Nikolaas Tinbergen,
66, for "their discoveries concerning organization and
elicitation of individual and social behavior patterns."
They were described by the awarding body as the most
eminent founders of a new science called ethology. Its
name is taken from the Greek word for habit or manner,
and it concerns the comparative study of behavior.
Mitchell, Stans Accused
NEW YORK — The government accused former
cabinet members John Mitchell and Maurice Stans
yesterday of trying to torpedo the conspiracy case against
them by their demand for White House tape recordings.
Asst. U.S. Atty. Thomas Day Edwards argued in
Manhattan federal court against a defense subpoena for
the tapes, accusing the opposing lawyers of seeking to
"rummage at will through the files of government
offices."
'They desperately hope," Edwards told Judge Lee
Gagliardi, "that they can somehow allege enough ... to
cause this court to require the production of some
item... as to which the White House legal staff,
consistent with the position they have taken on the
Watergate grand jury investigation, will feel compelled to
invoke executive privilege."
He said, "Upon the consummation of this ... event,
