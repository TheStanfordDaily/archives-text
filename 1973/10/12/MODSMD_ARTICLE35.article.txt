WASHINGTON (AP) - A federal
grand jury yesterday indicted former
White House plumbers' boss Egil
Krogh Jr. on charges he lied about the
activities of two Watergate
conspirators linked to the Ellsberg

break-in.
Krogh, already under indictment in
California on Ellsberg burglary
charges, is alleged in a two-count
indictment of making false statements
on Aug. 28, 1972 to a federal grand
jury investigating the Watergate
break-in.
The indictment charged that Krogh
lied about activities that E. Howard
Hunt and G. Gordon Liddy had been
engaged in while working at the White
House, where Krogh was their
immediate supervisor.
A government memorandum later
disclosed that Hunt and Liddy
directed the September, 1971 break-in
at the Beverly Hills office of a
psychiatrist who once treated
Pentagon Papers figure Daniel Ellsberg.
In January, 1973, they were convicted
in the Watergate break-in trial.
According to yesterday's
indictment, Krogh told the grand jury

he knew of no trips taken by the pair,
other than one to Texas by Hunt. He
testified that Liddy made a trip to
California to inspect "some customs
matters," and that he knew of no
other reason Liddy might have gone
there for the White House, the
indictment said.
Krogh since has sworn that Liddy
and Hunt made two trips to Los
Angeles in August and September,
1971, during which they engineered
the burglary of the office of Dr. Lewis
Fielding.
On May 9, Krogh took full
responsibility for the break-in.
The indictment was the first
returned by a new grand jury
empaneled Aug. 13 at the request of
special Watergate prosecutor Archibald
Cox.
The maximum penalty on each
count is five years in prison and a
$10,000 fine.
