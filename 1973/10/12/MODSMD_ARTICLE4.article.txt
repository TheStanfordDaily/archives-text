# Israelis Claim Victory In Golan Heights Battle
## 
### 
From the Associated Press
The Israeli military command
claimed its tanks blasted their way
through Syrian defenses in the Golan
Heights yesterday and were rumbling
along the road to Damascus. Defense
Minister Moshe Dayan predicted
lightning victory but did not say if the
Syrian capital was the objective.
"I think that by tonight or
overnight this front will be finished off
in our favor," Dayan told his soldiers
in a report broadcast over Israeli
television. Syria ignored the claim of a
breakthrough on the Golan Heights
and said its forces there were holding
firm.
In other developments:
— At the United Nations in New
York, Foreign Minister Mohamed H.
el-Zayyat of Egypt said a communique

to him from Cairo told of 500 persons
being killed in air attacks on Port Said,
Cairo suburbs and Egypt's northern
delta.
— Pentagon sources said the United
States was preparing to rush tons of
ammunition to Israel.
— Cairo radio said Egyptian tanks
punched farther into the Sinai
peninsula to wipe out a fleeing column
of Israeli armor.
— In the naval war, Syria and Israel
reported conflicting versions of a
battle off the Syrian coast. The Greek
Merchant Marine Ministry said an
Israeli gunboat sank one of its ships,
killing two crewmen.
— In the air war, Syrian and
Egyptian communiques claimed more
than 100 Israeli planes shot down
yesterday, and a Tel Aviv communique
said Israel bagged a total of 11 Arab
planes. Pentagon observers believe
both sides have exaggerated their aerial
kill reports.
— Egypt's Middle East News
Agency, in a report immediately
described by the U.S. State
Department as an "outrageous lie,"
said Western diplomatic sources in
Cairo claimed that U.S. carrier-based
warplanes had attacked Egyptian
positions.
Offensive
The Israeli command said it broke
through the Syrians' Golan Heights
defense after an all-day tank and
infantry offensive backed by massive
air support.
The command said Israeli forces
were six miles inside the 1967
cease-fire line along the heights, a hilly
area rich with farmlands seized from
Syria in the 1967 war.
The Israeli state radio quoted
Dayan as telling a newsman that the
Israelis had decided "to teach Syria a
severe lesson."
The state radio said tanks leading
the offensive into Syria bore the
chalked slogan: "Non-stop to
Damascus."
A high-ranking military official told
newsmen yesterday night: "The road
to Damascus is open to us." But the
official indicated Israeli forces would
stop short of entering the Syrian
capital because international protests

would be too strong if Damascus were
taken.
At the United Nations, the
Egyptian foreign minister did not
make clear if the 500 persons he said
were killed in Israeli air raids had been
killed yesterday.
A Cairo war communique said
Egyptian fighters intercepted Israeli
planes over Egypt, shot nine of them
down and forced some to drop their
bombs and flee. Some of the bombs
fell on villages, the communique said.
Casualties were not listed.
Israeli planes had attacked Port
Said twice since the war began, but no
Tel Aviv war communiques yesterday
mentioned attacks on Egyptian
targets.
U.S. Supplies
In Washington, Pentagon sources
said Soviet resupply of Syrian and
Egyptian forces continues, and that
the United States was preparing to
rush tons of artillery shells and
anti-tank ammunition to Israel.
The sources said at least 80 Soviet
AN 12 Cub transport planes loaded
with surface-to-air missiles, antitank
rockets and other war material had
reached Syria within the past day.
Decisions on replacing Israel's
significant aircraft and tank losses
were discussed by the White House,
State and Defense Departments,
officials said.
Israeli Losses
According to latest U.S.
intelligence, Israel lost close to 600
tanks and nearly 75 fighter planes in
the first five days of the war — about
one-third of the tanks and about
one-fourth of the jet fighters Israel
owned before the fighting erupted.
Pentagon intelligence said Syria has
lost 650 tanks, about half the
country's pre-war armor. Syria has lost
85 aircraft, or about one-third of its
strike force, the sources said.
Egypt has lost 200 to 250 tanks out
of a force of 2000, the Pentagon
intelligence sources said. Egypt's
aircraft losses were put at more than
80, but including only 47 fighters.
Egypt started the war with more than
500 fighter planes, the Pentagon
sources said.
