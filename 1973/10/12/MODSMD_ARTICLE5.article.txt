# Med School Doctors Attack Fetal Research Ban
## 
### PHILIP FEDER 
Gov. Ronald Reagan signed a bill last week
barring experiments on live, aborted fetuses
despite repeated protests from the School of
Medicine here, where doctors performed fetal
research in the 19605.
The new law prohibits the use of "any
aborted product of conception other than
fetal remains for scientific or laboratory
research . . . except to protect or preserve the
life and health of the fetus."
Dean Clayton Rich of the Stanford School
of Medicine said the bill will seriously
jeopardize efforts to deliver healthy babies in
the future. "We need new knowledge to insure
the maximum health and well-being of every
pregnant woman and newborn child," Rich
said.
Nevertheless, supporters of the bill testified
before the legislature this summer that
researchers, specifically those at Stanford,
were performing "cruel acts" on live fetuses.

James Babcock, a premedical student at
the University of California at Berkeley,
testified before the Assembly Health
Committee that he saw fetuses kept alive in a
special chamber at Stanford with their rib
cages cut open to observe heart beat.
Babcock, a member of the Student
Pro-Life Federation, an anti-abortion group,
visited Stanford in 1972. However, a
spokesman for the medical school contended,
"The student [Babcock] could not have
witnessed the described procedures at
Stanford because the project (research on
aborted fetuses] had been terminated in
1969."
Dr. Robert Goodlin, an associate professor
of gynecology and obstetrics, performed the
research at Stanford in the 19605. "Our goal
was to keep the fetus alive," Goodlin said.
"I'm at a loss to understand why the Pro-Life
Federation decided to select our group. All
sensible physicians agree the research was

ethical." Cutting the fetus open was
sometimes necessary to observe heart action
and at other times to massage the heart,
Goodlin said.
Research Known
Stanford, along with other medical schools
in the nation, made their research widely
known in a Life magazine article in
September, 1965.
Life stated that Goodlin and other
scientists were "working toward the day when
it would become routine to save prematurely
aborted fetuses at almost any age and carry
them through to 'birth' in artificial wombs."
Funds for further research were halted in
1969 when it was decided that Goodlin and
other scientists were "too far away" from
their goal of keeping the fetus alive outside
the womb, according to Rich.
In a letter to Gov. Reagan last month. Rich
pressed for the formation of a commission
composed of informed laymen, legislators and

scientists to determine the benefits versus the
risks of fetal research, and to recommend
legislation based on "thoughtful
consideration."
Federal Commission
It now appears that such a commission can
be formed only on the federal level, since the
state has banned all research.
The issue of continuing the
experimentation on fetuses is an emotional
one. Many religious organizations and other
groups like the Pro-Life Federation have
continually supported anti-abortion measures
and opposed medical research in related areas.
Some opponents of the current legislation
fear the bill will lead to the outlaw of
therapeutic abortion. For example, Stanford's
Nobel Prize-winning geneticist, Dr. Joshua
Lederberg, is concerned with "the unforeseen
and possibly unintended side effects of the
legislation. It is a remarkable precedent to
take in medical research."

Those directly or indirectly involved in
fetal research here are solidly opposed to the
recent legislative action. In testimony before
the Health Committee, Dr. Philip Sunshine,
pediatrician here, summarized the Medical
School's point of view: "Stanford and other
university premature [infant] centers are
constantly on the forefront of medical
practice to save babies that only yesterday
would have died. We [the School of
Medicine] feel your [the Assembly's]
legislation goes to the very heart of such
research and, in fact, may foreclose it."
In 1965, Life magazine depicted a
10-week-old fetus kept alive in an artificial
womb by Goodlin's team of Stanford
physicians. Goodlin said the objective at all
times was "to preserve life."
For the moment, further fetal research is
doubtful. Researchers are now looking to
federal legislators for possible help.

state has banned all research.
The issue of continuing the
experimentation on fetuses is an emotional
one. Many religious organizations and other
groups like the Pro-Life Federation have
continually supported anti-abortion measures
and opposed medical research in related areas.
Some opponents of the current legislation
fear the bill will lead to the outlaw of
therapeutic abortion. For example, Stanford's
Nobel Prize-winning geneticist, Dr. Joshua
Lederberg, is concerned with "the unforeseen
and possibly unintended side effects of the
legislation. It is a remarkable precedent to
take in medical research."

Those directly or indirectly involved in
fetal research here are solidly opposed to the
recent legislative action. In testimony before
the Health Committee, Dr. Philip Sunshine,
pediatrician here, summarized the Medical
School's point of view: "Stanford and other
university premature [infant] centers are
constantly on the forefront of medical
practice to save babies that only yesterday
would have died. We [the School of
Medicine] feel your [the Assembly's]
legislation goes to the very heart of such
research and, in fact, may foreclose it."
In 1965, Life magazine depicted a
10-week-old fetus kept alive in an artificial
womb by Goodlin's team of Stanford
physicians. Goodlin said the objective at all
times was "to preserve life."
For the moment, further fetal research is
doubtful. Researchers are now looking to
federal legislators for possible help.
Gov. Ronald Reagan signed a bill last week
barring experiments on live, aborted fetuses
despite repeated protests from the School of
Medicine here, where doctors performed fetal
research in the 19605.
The new law prohibits the use of "any
aborted product of conception other than
fetal remains for scientific or laboratory
research . . . except to protect or preserve the
life and health of the fetus."
Dean Clayton Rich of the Stanford School
of Medicine said the bill will seriously
jeopardize efforts to deliver healthy babies in
the future. "We need new knowledge to insure
the maximum health and well-being of every
pregnant woman and newborn child," Rich
said.
Nevertheless, supporters of the bill testified
before the legislature this summer that
researchers, specifically those at Stanford,
were performing "cruel acts" on live fetuses.

James Babcock, a premedical student at
the University of California at Berkeley,
testified before the Assembly Health
Committee that he saw fetuses kept alive in a
special chamber at Stanford with their rib
cages cut open to observe heart beat.
Babcock, a member of the Student
Pro-Life Federation, an anti-abortion group,
visited Stanford in 1972. However, a
spokesman for the medical school contended,
"The student [Babcock] could not have
witnessed the described procedures at
Stanford because the project (research on
aborted fetuses] had been terminated in
1969."
Dr. Robert Goodlin, an associate professor
of gynecology and obstetrics, performed the
research at Stanford in the 19605. "Our goal
was to keep the fetus alive," Goodlin said.
"I'm at a loss to understand why the Pro-Life
Federation decided to select our group. All
sensible physicians agree the research was

ethical." Cutting the fetus open was
sometimes necessary to observe heart action
and at other times to massage the heart,
Goodlin said.
Research Known
Stanford, along with other medical schools
in the nation, made their research widely
known in a Life magazine article in
September, 1965.
Life stated that Goodlin and other
scientists were "working toward the day when
it would become routine to save prematurely
aborted fetuses at almost any age and carry
them through to 'birth' in artificial wombs."
Funds for further research were halted in
1969 when it was decided that Goodlin and
other scientists were "too far away" from
their goal of keeping the fetus alive outside
the womb, according to Rich.
In a letter to Gov. Reagan last month. Rich
pressed for the formation of a commission
composed of informed laymen, legislators and

scientists to determine the benefits versus the
risks of fetal research, and to recommend
legislation based on "thoughtful
consideration."
Federal Commission
It now appears that such a commission can
be formed only on the federal level, since the
state has banned all research.
