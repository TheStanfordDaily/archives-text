## Secret Sessions 
### 
Despite University indications to the contrary last
summer, a KZSU reporter was denied admittance to last
week's meeting of the newly-organized Stanford-Palo Alto
liaison committee. Once again, "confidentiality" has been
used as a cloak to prevent full and open reporting of
University affairs.
The liaison committee considers matters of legitimate
interest to the community-problems of transportation,
traffic, housing and recreation, for example. Yet the
committee has prevented newsmen from serving this public
interest. Instead, it offers an edited set of minutes that,
admits Palo Alto City Manager George Sipel, might not
include "a few items" if they are "confidential." In other
words, the committee releases only what it wants released.
Since organizational work for the committee began last
spring, both the city and the University have engaged in an
elaborate charade, each privately and/or publicly pinning the
desire for secrecy on the other. In fact, as last week's action
demonstrates, the desire is mutual. Stanford's desire is in
keeping with a lengthy tradition of closed Trustees meetings
and committee sessions. The city, for whatever its reasons,
has successfully circumvented the spirit of the Brown Act —
the state's anti-secrecy law — by placing city staffers rather
than elected officials on the committee.
University Vice President Robert Augsburger has
defended the committee's secrecy on the grounds that it
may discuss "sensitive" matters. This statement is in itself
the most powerful argument for opening the meetings.
Discussions of important matters affecting the community
deserve as full and open an airing as possible. Closed-door
proceedings insure little public knowledge of, or input into,
the committee's work.
The University's participation is especially ironic in light
of statements made by some administrators that Stanford is
attempting to foster a more open atmosphere for the free
flow of information. Perhaps the University is putting into
practice the dictum uttered by an official of another
administration. The official said: "Watch what we do, not
what we say."
