# Incomplete Evidence
## Bizarre Analysis 
### 
Chris Elms

The recent column by Doyle
McManus was one of the most
bizarre political analyses this side
of the poll which showed Alf
Landon swamping FDR.
The main headline itself is not
terribly objectionable:
"McGovern Might Run Again."
After all, Dewey, Stassen,
Goldwater, and Humphrey might
also, since they are still living:
However, the thrust of the
article goes far beyond the
headline; McManus purports to
show that McGovem "badly
wants to run again" and that
"preliminary moves are
underway." McManus' evidence
seems to consist of the following:
1. McGovern has amassed
$440,000 for his reelection bid;
the implication being that this is
too much and thus that McGovem
is building a Presidential nestegg.
Only two comments need be
made here: First, McGovern is
going to have a tough time
winning reelection. (McManus
must be blissfully aware that the
Senator failed to carry his home
state in 1972). When I think
about the lengths to which Nixon
went to purge Charles Goodell in
1970, I shudder to think how
hard the President will work to
defeat the man who compared his
bombing to Hitlerian atrocities.
Second, even if there is money
left over after 1974, it will surely
not be over $1 million, hardly a
credible Presidential warchest.
(Note: CREEP has several million
$ surplus; does McManus suppose
Nixon will run again?)
2. The Harris poll recently
showed if the election were held
again it would be too close to call.
I, McManus, and, I suspect, the
Senator reject this poll as being
meaningless for 1976, for reasons
which McManus enunciates
clearly.
3. McGovem shook hands with
the President at a social gathering,
and was caught in the act by the
Post. I have the feeling that if
McGovern had pulled out a stiletto
and slit Nixon's throat McManus
would take this as sure evidence
McGovem harbored further
Presidential ambitions.
4. McGovem wrote an article
in the Post. Does McManus believe
that when one writes a newspaper

column one obviously harbors
political ambitions? (When will
McManus declare his candidacy
for ASSU President?)
5. McGovem observes that it's
hard to run a mistake-free
campaign the first time around.
There are many people who have
noted this fact; including
Theodore White and my
next-door neighbor, neither of
them Presidential aspirants.
6. McGovem supporters
gathered to kick off the Hart for
Senate race. I wonder who
McManus expected to be
there ... Humphrey supporters
perhaps?
7. McGovem stated that he
hasn't made up his mind whether
to run. This quote is evidence that
"McGovem might run again," but
hardly that "preliminary moves"
are being made on his behalf.
As a former newspaper editor I
know well the problems of having
to fill a certain amount of space
every other week. And I also
know crap when I read it.
(Chris Elms is a sophomore in
political science.)
Mr. McManus, who spent his
summer in Washington observing
George McGovern, replies:
Mr. Elms is certainly entitled
to his opinion, however
intemperate, as to the accuracy of
my analysis. It was, after all, an
expression of opinion about
which reasonable persons may
differ.
Nevertheless, J find Mr. Elms'
ferocity surprising. My column
did not attack or uphold Sen.
McGovern's views, nor Mr. Elms\
It merely reported that most
political observers in Washington
were of the opinion that
McGovem, an ambitious man by
anyone's standards, continues to
evince interest in higher office.
To accuse a politician of
ambition is neither novel nor
particularly objectionable.
Mr. Elms may be content to
unit for formal declarations of
candidacy. It is the business of
journalists to discover a
candidate's intentions before that
glorious day.
Mr. Dewey, incidentally, did
die some time ago.

Mr. Elms is certainly entitled

It merely reported that most

To accuse a politician of
ambition is neither novel nor
particularly objectionable.

The recent column by Doyle
McManus was one of the most
bizarre political analyses this side
of the poll which showed Alf
Landon swamping FDR.
The main headline itself is not
terribly objectionable:
"McGovern Might Run Again."
After all, Dewey, Stassen,
Goldwater, and Humphrey might
also, since they are still living:
However, the thrust of the
article goes far beyond the
headline; McManus purports to
show that McGovem "badly
wants to run again" and that
"preliminary moves are
underway." McManus' evidence
seems to consist of the following:
1. McGovern has amassed
$440,000 for his reelection bid;
the implication being that this is
too much and thus that McGovem
is building a Presidential nestegg.
Only two comments need be
made here: First, McGovern is
going to have a tough time
winning reelection. (McManus
must be blissfully aware that the
Senator failed to carry his home
state in 1972). When I think
about the lengths to which Nixon
went to purge Charles Goodell in
1970, I shudder to think how
hard the President will work to
defeat the man who compared his
bombing to Hitlerian atrocities.
Second, even if there is money
left over after 1974, it will surely
not be over $1 million, hardly a
credible Presidential warchest.
(Note: CREEP has several million
$ surplus; does McManus suppose
Nixon will run again?)
2. The Harris poll recently
showed if the election were held
again it would be too close to call.
I, McManus, and, I suspect, the
Senator reject this poll as being
meaningless for 1976, for reasons
which McManus enunciates
clearly.
3. McGovem shook hands with
the President at a social gathering,
and was caught in the act by the
Post. I have the feeling that if
McGovern had pulled out a stiletto
and slit Nixon's throat McManus
would take this as sure evidence
McGovem harbored further
Presidential ambitions.
4. McGovem wrote an article
in the Post. Does McManus believe
that when one writes a newspaper

column one obviously harbors
political ambitions? (When will
McManus declare his candidacy
for ASSU President?)
5. McGovem observes that it's
hard to run a mistake-free
campaign the first time around.
There are many people who have
noted this fact; including
Theodore White and my
next-door neighbor, neither of
them Presidential aspirants.
6. McGovem supporters
gathered to kick off the Hart for
Senate race. I wonder who
McManus expected to be
there ... Humphrey supporters
perhaps?
7. McGovem stated that he
hasn't made up his mind whether
to run. This quote is evidence that
"McGovem might run again," but
hardly that "preliminary moves"
are being made on his behalf.
As a former newspaper editor I
know well the problems of having
to fill a certain amount of space
every other week. And I also
know crap when I read it.
