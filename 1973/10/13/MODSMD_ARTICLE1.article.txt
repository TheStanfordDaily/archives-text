# Cards, UCLA Open Pac-8 Seasons
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Neither Pepper Rodgers nor
Jack Christiansen can afford to
even think of the Rose Bowl yet.
But in a few hours, after today's
game, one of the rival coaches will
find it difficult to keep that
ambrosial smell of roses out of his
head.
The winner of today's game
between UCLA and Stanford,
which begins at 1:30 p.m., will
immediately assume the role of
No. 1 challenger to USC for the
league title and subsequent trip to
Pasadena.
And, unlike last year, the "top
challenger" tab may not be an
empty honor. USC, after four
games, has not managed to
rekindle the offense which last
year blazed a trail to the national
championship.
Of course, its more likely that
Rodgers, who commands the
Bruins' devestating Wishbone
attack, will win. Oddsmakers have
installed UCLA (3-1) as a 11 point
favorite over Stanford (2-2) in the
conference opener for both teams.
Since an embarrassing defeat
by Nebraska, 40-13, the Bruins
have come back strongly, crushing
lowa, Michigan State, and Utah.
The Bruins have thus assumed the
11th spot in the UPI national
rankings.
Big Plays
Stanford has also been
recovering from early-season
losses to Penn State (20-6) and
Michigan (47-10). The Cardinals,
while statistically unimpressive,
made the "big plays" in wins over
San Jose State (22-13), and
Illinois (24-0).
Most of the credit for
Stanford's victories goes to the
defense, which forced turnovers
setting up the winning
touchdowns in both games. The
Cardinals recently switched to the
"50" defense in most situations.
The "50", so named because
five men play close to the line of
scrimmage, uses only three down
linemen—star ends Roger Stillwell
and Pat Donovan—and nose guards
Pete Hanson or Joe Martin.
Outside linebackers Geb
Church and John Snider play
close to the line of scrimmage,
with Forrie Martin and Gordie
Riegel playing the inside
linebacker spots.
The "50" gets its toughest test
to date against the UCLA
Wishbone, led by the powerful
running of James McAlister and
Kermit Johnson, teammates since
high school, both of whom have
outgained the entire Stanford
team.
No Passing Fancy
John Sciarra, who has
apparently won the quarterback
position from Mark Harmon, is
also a top running threat, and has
the ability to pass should the
situation demand. But, as Rodgers
sees it, the situation rarely

demands.
Sciarra and Harmon have
battled for the starting assignment
all year, and, as Rodgers has said,
"Harmon has the girls on his side
but Sciarra has the statistics on his
side."
While most of the "attention
will be focused on the battle
between UCLA's offense and
Stanford's defense, the success of
the comparatively impotent

Cardinal offense against the
crippled Bruin defense may decide
the outcome of the game.
The Cards thus far this year
have netted only 201 yards
rushing, a statistic which looks
like a typographical error when
compared with the Bruins' 1369
yards.
Some Running
Last week, however, the Cards

showed some semblance of
developing a running attack, as
Scott Laidlaw had his finest game
and Doug Jena also did well.
Jena is today's offensive
captain, Riegel the defensive
captain and punter Dave Ottmar
the captain of the special teams.
Quarterback Ottmar hit 11 of
19 passes against Illinois, replacing
Mike Boryla, who suffered a cut
over his eye and did not play since

it would have been difficult for
him to put his helmet back on.
For this effort, he was voted
honorable mention Pac-8
offensive player of the week.
"I think he [Ottmar] is very
happy I made the decision he
should play," Christiansen
quipped. Ottmar wanted to
redshirt the season but was forced
to play because of poor Stanford
punting.
Boryla will start at
quarterback. Last week, Stanford
quarterbacks began throwing
more than usual to their running
backs, and Laidlaw, Jena, and Sig
Ostrom join Bill Singler, Reggie
Ishman and Glen Stone as prime
receivers today.
Mutual Inexperience
One factor in favor of
Stanford's offensive line is that it
will be meeting a similarly
inexperienced UCLA defense, as
injuries have hurt the Bruins,
who recently lost their fine
pair of defensive ends in Cal
Peterson and Fred McNeill.
Entering the game,
Christiansen sounds typically
noncommital: "We feel like we're
a more seasoned team now and
ready to play a team like UCLA."
But he also sounds like he's
one victory away from thoughts
of Pasadena. "USC hasn't really
won like everyone's expected
them to and UCLA showed some
vulnerability against
Nebraska ... I guess that most of
the teams are just like me, feeling
that anything can happen in the
next seven weeks."

pass against San Jose State two weeks ago. Stillwell, along with linebacker Gordie Riegel (55), have thus
far been standouts for the team.
