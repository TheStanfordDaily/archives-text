# Wishbone: A New Package For Old-Fashioned Football
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Remember the turbulent
19605, when college campuses
were protesting the dropping of
bombs in Southeast Asia, college
football coaches advised quarter
backs to drop bombs in the
stadium on Saturday afternoon
and Wishbone was something you
put on your salad?
Well, things have changed. So
far the 70s have been character
ized by quiet campuses and
conservative coaches. The Wish
bone is now a college football
offense, an offense that stresses
the run despite all those passes
that fill the air in NFL stadiums
every Sunday afternoon.
The college game has returned
to the good old days of football —
just old fashioned block hard, run
hard, blood and guts football.
Only the formation has changed.
Who is responsible for this
madness? Why will the estimated
70,000 fans in Stanford Stadium
today see only one team utilize
the forward pass, America's
favorite offensive weapon? What
the hell is this Wishbone, anyway?
Royal Entrance
The Wishbone made its first
appearance on the college football
scene in 1968, when Darrel Royal
of the University of Texas aligned
his backfield in a formation that
someone thought resembled a
Wishbone. Fullback Ted Koy
lined up directly behind
quarterback James Street (about

two yards back), with halfbacks
Steve Worster and Chris Gilbert
on either side of Koy but about a
yard farther from the line of
scrimmage.
"A number of our coahces
contributed to the idea," Royal
says. "We just wanted to run the
triple option with a lead blocker
and the Wishbone allowed us to
fake to the fullback either way
and use the other halfback as the
lead blocker."
The Texas backfield was
ideally suited to Royal's new
offense. Street would either hand
off to Koy up the middle; fake to
Koy and move across the line of
scrimmage before dashing forward
himself; or fake to Koy, move
across the line of scrimmage and
pitch to either Worster or Gilbert
behind him. "It was a good one,"
Royal said of his versatile 1968
backfield.
Texas was 8-1-1 that fall and
defeated Tennessee 36-16 in the
Cotton Bowl. The Longhorns
were ranked in the top five
nationally, and since college
football coaches are "the biggest
copycats in the world" according
to Royal, several more Wishbones
appeared in 1969.
By 1970 Royal says there were
"a whole bunch" of Wishbones
and now "you can hardly find an
area of the country where at least
one team doesn't use the
formation."
On the West Coast, of course,

the most prominent Wishbone is
the UCLA version that will be on
display this afternoon. "Ours is
sort of a vanilla version," says
Bruin coach Pepper Rodgers. "A
pure Wishbone without fancy
flavorings."
"Every play complements
every other play," said UCLA's
Homer Smith, who enjoys the
unique title of Assistant Head
Coach. "And the association of
plays, or the series integrity as we
call it, is made possible by the
unique shape of the formation.
"We prefer option offense for a
reason which goes as far as the
psychological advantage of what is
called positive thinking. Option
offense separates defenders for
purposes of identification and
target assignment.
"The threats which are
presented as the basic play is
being executed — the dive and the
pitch threats with the quarterback
keep and pass threats in between
— force a defense to cover more
square yards of grass than any
other T-formation play," Smith
said.
Stretched Defense
'The defense is stretched;
separated. Offenders can see what
happens to their plays. And when
they can see and correct and plan
for a better play there is a
positiveness in their thinking
which imbues the whole program.
"This is not to argue that the
Wishbone is superior, but rather
to explain what makes it unique
and why we prefer it for our
athletes."
The average fan may get
bogged down in Smith's half
technical, half philosophical
terminology, but anyone can
understand the following

statistics:
UCLA has gained 1369 yards
on the ground in four games this
year (as compared, for example to
Stanford's 201-yard total);
halfback Kermit Johnson is
averaging 8.1 yards per carry,
fullback James McAlister 5.4
yards, quarterback John Sciarra
5.5, quarterback Mark Harmon
4.8, halfback Russell Charles 8.0
and halfback Wendell Tyler 5.6;
and the Bruins are averaging an
awesome 42 points per game.
Here To Stay?
All of which seems to be fairly
convincing evidence for the value
of the Wishbone. But what about
the formation's future? Is it just a
passing fad or is it here to stay?
"There is room for perfecting

within the Wishbone shape, and
we believe that there will be an
evolutionary movement about it
for several years to come," says
Smith, somewhat vaguely.
"I don't think the Wishbone
will ever appear in the pros," said
Royal. "I think it will run its
course like any other offense.
"After all, the formation
doesn't do anything itself. It all
boils down to how hard you block
and run."
So will UCLA's Wishbone
prove superior to Stanford's
"Variable-T" this afternoon? It
probably just depends on who hits
the hardest.
But in that filming room
tomorrow morning, when the
losing coach's head begins to spin
with X's and O's ...
