# Criticism Doesn't Faze Offensive Line
## 
### TIM FERGUSON 
"If you get the job done and
win, no one notices," says
Cardinal center Bill Reid,
discussing the plight of an
offensive lineman. "If you lose,
it's your fault."
Stanford is averaging 1.4 yards
per rush. Mike Boryla has been
sacked for 151 yards in losses.
The Cardinals lost one-sided
games to Penn State and
Michigan. People are noticing.
Many blame the line.
The line blames inexperience.
"It's very obvious what the
problem is," explains line coach
Hudson Houck, pointing out that
only two of his men, Reid and left
tackle Keith Row en, approached
this season with varsity game
experience. "It was the first topic
this spring and all the way
through."

Does Houck, a member of
USC's 1962 national
championship team and in his
second year on the Stanford staff
(he coached the frosh to a 4-0
record last year), feel personal
pressure because of the situation.
Improvement Seen
"If there was not
improvement, I'm sure I would,"
says Houck. "Even though the
stats don't show it, the tackles,
the guards, they're all improving."
Everyone involved agrees.
"We're gettin' better — you
could see that against Illinois,"
says freshman Alex Karakozoff,
now competing for a starting spot
at guard.
Veterans Reid and Rowen
agree. Reid points to the fact that
Boryla, after many sackings by
Penn State and Michigan, was
decked only once by San Jose
State and that no Fighting Illini
reached a Card quarterback.
Rowen says that after the
miserable start the line was "a
little better" against San Jose and
"pretty good" last weekend.
"We got a really good test at
Illinois and had a good practice
Monday," Reid says.
Chris Sold
Head coach Jack Christiansen

is sold, too. "They're [the
offensive linemen] improving,"
says Chris. "The only way you
can mature as an offensive line is
on Saturday — the game
experience has really helped these
guys."
So, after what Houck calls
"extremely hard" work, the line is
apparently improved. But what
caused the initial weakness? The
Stanford line lost nine lettermen
and three starters from 1972,
when Card rushers averaged just
28 yards and Boryla ate it for 295
yards.
Starting right guard Bruce
Blackstone (6-0, 235) played only
sparingly last year, and right
tackle Todd Anderson (6-5, 240)
is starting as a sophomore
(although he was billed the
"Super Frosh" of last spring's
practice).

Houck mentions that Gary
Anderson, a freshman starting at
left guard who was not even
included on the pre-season roster,
was a week late for two-a-day
drills, and that he, Karakozoff and
junior transfer Rob Olson have
been making their share of
mistakes.
Albritton Loss
To add to the Cardinal misery,
expected first-string guard Terry
Albritton decided to quit
Stanford football and concentrate
on his shot-putting instead.
Houck, however, dismissed the
importance of Albritton's
decision. "I don't think that's
been a key factor. We've got a
couple of freshmen who look
pretty good."
By that, of course, he means
Gary Anderson and Karakozoff,

who, for all their mistakes, have
excelled to the point where they
are varsity regulars their first year
at Stanford.
"I've learned a lot," says
Anderson. "The defenses are a
little tougher [than in high
school]."
"It's not that bad physically,"
says Karakozoff, "but mentally
it's tough."
Helping Hand
Reid and Rowen both say they
try to help the younger linemen.
"Whether we live or die is going to
be as a team," Reid says.
Teammate Rowen adds, "We try
to teach 'em a few things, but
they're really good athletes."
"I'm happy we're starting,"
says Gary Anderson, "but I wish
we could do better."
Houck says pass protection has
been the toughest assignment for

his troops thus far. 'That's
something you don't have in high
school."
"It takes a really good athlete
to pass block," says Reid. "More
so than drive blocking."
Problems With Stunts
Rowen says the passer is
difficult to defend because of "so
many stunts by the defense." He
feels, however, that the main task
ahead is to improve "our
cohesiveness as a unit. A feel for
each other — that's the important
thing."
"I don't think there's any
question that they're [offensive
linemen] adequate" for Pacific
Eight play, Houck says.
Can they handle even
powerhouse USC? "Sure ... as
well as they could." Houck points
out that the Trojan offensive line,
though "tremendously physical,"
has also been making mistakes.
"It took me at least one season
to get used to this level [Pac-B],"
says Reid, who came to Stanford
as a junior college transfer from
Long Beach.
Criticism of the line sometimes
gets harsh. Rarely, however, does
it come from Cardinal backs who
find their running and passing
areas crowded.
Communication Gap
"Mike [Boryla] is not that
way," says Reid. And, he adds,
"most of the problems have been
communication breakdowns
between the backs and the line."
Criticism in the press has "not
really" bothered Rowen, but he
says the Fourth Estate "isn't that
understanding that we've got
many young guys."
One of those "young guys,"
Karakozoff, shrugs off the barbs.
"I go to my dorm and get it... I
get it all the time."
If Karakozoff and his fellow
lineman keep improving, he may
not get "it" at all.

FRESHMAN POWER — Alex Karakozoff (67), a freshman guard who is now battling for a starting job,
throws a key block to help Sig Ostrom (39) to a nice gain against San Jose State. Another freshman guard,
Gary Anderson (65) looks on. Stanford's offensive line has, according to its members, come along well
since poor performances which helped cause the Cardinals losses to Penn State and Michigan. Future
success of the Stanford offense is largely dependent on the inexperienced line, which includes only two
veterans from last year's squad.
