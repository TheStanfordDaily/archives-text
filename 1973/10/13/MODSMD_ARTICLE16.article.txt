# UCLA At A Glance
## 
### 
Coaching
Pepper Rodgers, the Bruins' head coach, has
become one of the most respected college
coaches in the nation. Joining UCLA in 1971
after a four-year stay at Kansas, Rodgers had a
poor first season, finishing at 2-7-1. But the
42-year-old coach turned it around last season,
instituting the Wishbone offense en route to 8-3
mark.
Running Game
Maybe the Miami Dolphins have better
runners than UCLA, but even that could be
disputed. Thus far this year, the Bruins have
averaged 342 yards rushing per game, and have
an incredible average of 5.7 yards per carry.
Right halfback Kermit Johnson (185 pounds)
and fullback James McAlister (202) are the
Bruins' top threats. Both have outrushed the
Stanford team, even if Mike Boryla's losses aren't
counted. Left halfback Russel Charles (175)
doesn't carry the ball as much, but is a definite
threat, as are quarterbacks John Sciarra (180)
and Mark Harmon (184). For a complete analysis
on how UCLA makes its Wishbone attack work,
turn to page four.
Passing Game
UCLA has been passing more than usual this
year — nearly 11 times per game so far. Sciarra
has thus far shown himself to be a better passer
than Harmon was last year, and that's part of
why he's won the starting job.
Steve Moynahan, a junior college transfer, is
UCLA's only starting wide receiver. Freshman
Raymond Burks has quickly moved up to start at
tight end.
Offensive Line
UCLA's offensive line is bolstered by size.
Left guard Gene Clark and right tackle A 1 Oliver
both weight at least 275 pounds.
It's not easy to get past right guard Steve
Klosterman (245) or left tackle Kezerian (239)
either, as both are starting for the second straight
year. Converted guard Randy Cross (240) fills
the center spot in the Bruins' mammouth line.
Defensive Line
Pro teams play with four defensive linemen,
Stanford plays much of the game with only
three, UCLA uses five.

The Bruins, until this week, boasted a pair of
defensive ends, Cal Peterson and Fred McNeill,
who rivaled Stanford's Roger Stillwell and Pat
Donovan for "best in the league" honors. But
both players were hurt during practice this week,
and will be replaced by Herschel Ramsey (190),
who once played safety, and Dale Curry (210).
Left tackle Pat Sweetland (240), middle guard
Greg Norfleet (235), and right tackle Bill
Sandifer (285) round out UCLA's line.
Linebackers
If UCLA has a weakness on defense, it's
probably here.
Both starting linebackers were hurt on
successive plays against Michigan State. To
replace them, junior letterman Gene Settles
(221) has had to make a quick recovery from a
shoulder injury, while Fulton Kuykenall (204)
has been shifted from his more-accustomed spot
at left end.
Defensive Secondary
Thus far this season, UCLA's secondary has
picked off 12 passes, tied for first place in the
Pac-8. Left cornerback John Nanoski has three
interceptions to his credit, and safety Jim Bright
has picked off two passes and returned them a
total of 113 yards.
Kent Pearce, also with two interceptions,
starts at the other safety position, with Jimmy
Allen, who intercepted seven passes last season,
at right cornerback.
An interesting statistic — UCLA receivers have
caught only 17 passes; UCLA defenders have
grabbed only five less.
Special Teams
Kicker Efren Herrera has thus far performed
superbly, converting 21 of 23 extra point
attempts and all three field goal tries.
UCLA has been forced to punt fewer times
than any other team in the Pac-8. At press time,
Rodgers was still debating whether to use Mike
Fryer or John Sullivan, as he expressed concern
over the strength of Stanford's punt return.
Bruin quarterback Sciarra doubles as the league's
second-leading punt returner, averaging a
fantastic 15.7 yard per return. Wendell Tyler
averages 19.7 yards as the team's kickoff
returner.

over 90 yards per game.
