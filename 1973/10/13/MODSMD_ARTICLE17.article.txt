# 'Anonymous' Ferguson Plays It Smooth
## 
### MARK WHITE 
If the average fan who watched
last week's Stanford game against
Illinois was asked who James
Ferguson was, unless the fan were
an astute watcher of pre-game
player introductions, chances are
the fan would ask, "James who?"
Ferguson is simply not one of
those players who grabs headlines,
glistens in the spotlight or is
fawned over by adoring
sportswriters after games.
"If you haven't heard from my
side, you can say I've had a pretty
good game" the wizened,
three-year veteran senior defensive
back points out. "Defensive backs
rarely get much publicity, we are
just not in a position to be
publicized. Getting notice in the
papers is just one of those things;
if it happens, it happens; if it
don't, it don't."
Anonymity for Ferguson has
not been strictly a result of his
defensive back positioning; in
fact, anonymity has followed
James around throughout most of
his athletic career.
As a league-leading running
back in his senior year at Kennedy
High in Richmond, James
averaged over nine yards a carry
and yet was passed over in favor
of three other backs in his league's
all-star selection. His talent got
him into the prestigious
North-South Shrine game — the
year a youngster named James
McAlister made headlines by
demolishing the North's defense.
Rose Bowl Infamy
Even though he captained and
led Stanford's freshman team in
1970, James was somehow lost in
the shuffle when other
sophomores played first-string
varsity ball in 1971. Playing as a
punt returner and a second-string
cornerback, James stayed mostly
in the background — until the
1972 Rose Bowl game against
Michigan.
Late in the tight contest, with
the score tied at 10-10, Michigan

attempted a 46-yard field goal.
"I was back deep," explained
James, "because Coach Ralston
thought we could return the
attempt if it was short. When I
took the ball in the endzone, I
had plenty of blockers and only
one man to beat. Unfortunately, I
didn't cut back deep enough and
Ed Shuttlesworth threw me in the
endzone for a safety."
"Even though we won the
game, the safety haunted me for a
while. But I wasn't a nobody
anymore, that's for sure; I was
somebody! In New York, San
Francisco and L.A., there were
clips of James Ferguson and his
safety. In a way it was fun and
crazy. I guess that's the way the
press is; it doesn't make sense, it
just happens."
George Seifert, Ferguson's
defensive backfield coach, thinks
James has long outlived his
moment of infamy.
Great Plays
"I think his TD fumble
recovery against USC and the
fumble-causing tackle on [John]
Cappelletti against Penn State are
more indicative of Ferguson's play
thatn the safety," said Seifert.
"And, in fact, the manner in
which James has handled himself
while others have gotten all the
write-ups has been a source of
leadership for the younger players
I could not be more happy with.
He is and has, playing up to his
potentials with a sense of urgency
and intensity," Seifert said.
Besides playing next to the
highly-touted Randy Poltl, James
tends to be overlooked because of
his style of play. Not a bone
jarring, physically aggressive
player of a Ken Tatum mold,
James employs a smoother,
subtler style of play that is less
conspicuous.
Smooth Style
"Being a skinny 6-1, 180
pounder, I'm in no position to
hurl myself at 250-pound
linemen. I simply wouldn't be

able to take that kind of
punishment. For me to be
effective, I must be smooth and
finesse my man. Consistency is
the goal I shoot for," Ferguson
explained.
"Now once or twice a game
you have to hit your man to let
him know you are there, but
outside of that, knocking down
passes and keeping close to him is
preferable to pounding him into
the ground. In this respect Jimmy
Johnson of the 49'ers is what I
think a defensive back should be:
sweet and smooth as you can be."
Unlike some high school
athletes who know the college
offers will come in, James
anticipated very little recruitment.
As a result, he applied to and was
accepted by several Eastern "Ivy
League" schools based on his
scholastic abilities.
Rejects Royals
"At the time I was a high
school senior" the 21-year-old
anthropology major explained,
"and I felt I had two choices:
either play ball for the Kansas
City Royals, who had offered me
a good contract, or to go to
college. I decided on the latter
and was planning on going to
Cornell when the recruiting
started."
"For 13 or 14 weekends all I
did was visit campuses, and boy
did I have a ball. I eventually
chose Stanford over Cal because
1) Cal was too close to home, 2)

Isaac Curtis had one running back
spot sewed up, and 3) it [Cal]
seemed like a continuation of
high-school with the same bay
area crowd and all."
With a Rose Bowl victory, two
winning seasons and a change of
coaching regimes behind him,
James draws on considerable
experience and predicts a better
Cardinal team in the future.
Chris Versus Ralston
"Right now we are learning
from our mistakes and with every
game we mature. That's one of
the things I like about Coach
Christiansen; his treatment of the
players fosters more
self-fulfillment and pride in one's
play than Coach Ralston's

method.
"Ralston was somewhat of a
hoo rah coach, pleading with
players to play for him.
Christiansen is calm and thinks of
you as a mature man, not as a boy
in his program. Christiansen
develops the pride in us necessary
to play well for ourselves," James
said.
"We can beat UCLA if we give
a maximum effort like we did
against Illinois last week, and if
we don't give away the game like
we did with Michigan. Other than
that, I am going to play it a game
at a time, and if the Rose Bowl
comes, it comes; if it don't, it
don't."

HIGH PRAISE—James Ferguson, shown here trying to block kick in last year's UCLA game, is considered
one of the Cardinals' most outstanding players by his teammates and coaches, although he wins little
public recognition.
