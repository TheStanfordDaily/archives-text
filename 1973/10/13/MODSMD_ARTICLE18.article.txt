When the UCLA Bruins kick off for the first time this
afternoon, you might be well-advised to keep an eye on where
the kicker goes as well as where the kickoff goes.
Any of the 47,000 fans who attended the war last Nov. 4 in
the Los Angeles Coliseum can tell you that the fireworks may
be greatest where you expect them least — between Bruin
kicking specialist Efren Herrera and Stanford's talented if
eccentric linebacker Forrie Martin.
Almost a year ago, on a misty day in a far-away land called
Los Angeles, UCLA defeated Stanford 28-23, but not before
Martin had decked Herrera, and not before Efren had
retaliated with a kick to Forrie's midsection, and not before a
disbelieving referee had slapped Herrera with a fifteen yard
penalty for a personal foul. And in the midst of this chaos
fullback Reggie Sanderson darted 87 yards for a touchdown to
bring the Cardinals back into a game which had looked like a
potential runaway for the Bruins.
In a contest which many LA sportswriters labeled the most
exciting ever held in the Coliseum, the Martin-Herrera duel was
only one of many colorful incidents. It was Wishbone whiz-kid
Mark Harmon and his Blair-pair James McAlister and Kermit
Johnson, versus Mike Boryla's awesome aerial attack, which
netted 316 yards, 26 completions in 50 attempts, and two
touchdowns.
Harmon managed only three completions in that game, but
two of them were for touchdowns. The UCLA backfield
returns intact, and will undoubtedly keep the ball on the
ground again. The Bruin running game netted 313 yards last
year, and quarterback Harmon ran for two TD's to cinch his
offensive player of the game honors.
Harmon will have trouble repeating that performance this
afternoon, however, as sophomore quarterback John Sciarra,
who is averaging 5.5 yards per carry, is slated to start.
But Stanford, like the Bruins, will have a few new faces in
the starting lineup. Gone is defensive back Charles McCloud,
who deflected a Harmon pitchout midway through the fourth
quarter to set up a touchdown and a short-lived 23-21 lead for
the Cards. Also gone is wide receiver Miles Moore who scored
that crucial touchdown after catching a Boryla pass on the
sideline and dancing the final five yards for the score.
