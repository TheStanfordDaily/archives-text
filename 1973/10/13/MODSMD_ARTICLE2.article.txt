# Basketball Tops At UCLA
## Football Team Fights Second Spot 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
"The Bruins, under coach John Wooden,
own college basketball today. They Ve like the
Yankees in Casey Stengel's era, USC track
teams when Dean Cromwell was coach and
the Fighting Irish under Knute Rockne.
"They're the greatest. They have it all.
They 're pure class. .."
—Sid Ziff, Los Angeles Times
WESTWOOD—Nine gold plaques rest on
the first floor of Ackerman Student Union at
UCLA. Encased in glass, for the students to
marvel at, the plaques read "National
Collegiate Basketball Championship —
Champion." Each one represents a year of
hard work, culminated by a national title for
the Bruins — seven straight including 1973,
nine of the past 10.
And each one represents another year in a
dynasty, a dynasty that has transformed
basketball at UCLA into a mania which
engulfs players and students alike. At UCLA
basketball, not football, has that special aura
of being number one.
The basketball team has captured the
NCAA title for seven years in a row. UCLA
hasn't been to the Rose Bowl for seven years in
a row.
The UCLA basketball team plays for

sell-out crowds at each home game. The
crowd at home football games depends mostly
on UCLA's opponent.
And the students seem to sense and
promote the superiority of basketball over
football. Comments like that of one
sophomore coed, "Oh, the football team's all
right, but the basketball team is great," are
not unusual.
Efforts Overshadowed?
How does that attitude make the football
players and coaches feel? Do they think their
efforts have been overshadowed by those nine
gold plaques? What's it like to play football at
a school where basketball is the number one
sport?
"I see the difference [between football and
basketball at UCLA]," says halfback Kermit
Johnson, "but it doesn't bother me. Football
is more exciting anyway."
Nor does basketball's popularity with
UCLA students seem to bother quarterback
Mark Harmon. "I don't look at it that way,"
he says about basketball's position on campus.
"I just get out there to do my best, to pay and
win."
None of the players interviewed said the
popularity of the team in relation to that of
Bruin netmen affected their playing.

And there are those who disagree with the
premise that basketball has double-dribbled its
way into center court of the UCLA sports
fan's heart.
Number One Sport?
"Basketball the number one sport?" Head
coach Pepper Rodgers lifts his eyebrows.
"Well, now that's an opinion. You can believe
that or you can't. I sure don't believe it.
"Basketball is number one ... during
basketball season. And football is number one
during football season," Rodgers answers.
"Basketball will never overtake football,"
concurs placekicker Efren Herrera. "Football
games have a different atmosphere. They're
more exciting. Basketball is a game of nerves."
Team Success
But perhaps the most realistic replies come
from those who consider not the quality or
excitement of the sport, but the success of the
team.
"Basketball grosses money. The only
reason we're not number one is that we're not
national champions. If we won seven straight
championships, we'd be number one too,"
explains fullback James McAlister.
"I think if we go to a couple of Rost
Bowls," theorizes split end Norm Andersen,
"people will come back to watching us."
