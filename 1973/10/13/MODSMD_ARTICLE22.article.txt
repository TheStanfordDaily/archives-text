# Pac-8 Teams Start League Play Today
## 
### 
The Pacific Eight conference
begins its first full week of
conference play today. While the
game you'll see today, Stanford
vs. UCLA, appears to be the most
crucial, three other battles, all of
which also begin at 1:30 p.m. are
highlighted by interesting
contrasts.
Washington State lost to the
nation's top-ranked team Ohio
State, last week, and faces
defending national-champion USC
today.
A tough schedule? Probably so.
When asked where the Cougars
play USC, coach Jim Sweeney
replied "In Los Angeles. Where do
you expect us to play them, in the
Mayo Clinic?".
The Trojans, already back in
their accustomed spot of first
place after a 21-7 win over Oregon
State last week, thus far have
shown incredibly good defense,
allowing opponents an average of
but five points per game.
Actually, USC is not all alone
in first place, as California, which
is ineligible for the Rose Bowl,
beat Washington 54-49 last week.
This week, Cal takes its offense
to Eugene to play Oregon ... and
hopes it doesn't leave its defense
behind again.
The Bears' defense must
improve to stop the Ducks' Don
Reynolds, the conference's
leading rusher after four games.
Reynolds has gained an average of
113 yards per game.
"He has the ability to run into
the hole and then make the
decision as to where to go,"
Oregon coach Dick Enright said of
the runner who passed USC coach
John McKay on the Ducks'
all-time rushing list last week.
Enigmatic Washington, which
was tagged as "good defense-no
offense" before last week's circus
at Berkeley, tries again against
Oregon State.
More than rain will come out

of the Seattle skies, as OSU has
attempted an average of 42 passes
a game thus far this season. Beaver
quarterback Alvin White leads the
conference in total offense.
The Huskies seem to have
discovered a star passer who could
replace Sonny Sixkiller.
Sophomore Chris Rowland tied
Craig Morton's league record last
week by throwing five touchdown
passes.
