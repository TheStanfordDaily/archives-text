# Band Becomes Happily Shaked Up
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
You'll hear them any minute
now. Off in the distance, they'll
sound like a tribe of neurotic
Indians, hammering crazily on
their drums and piercing the air
with off-color war whoops.
They, of course, are the
Incomparables of the Leland
Stanford Junior University Band,
and when they appear on the
horizon, they'll get a standing
ovation from the student rooting
section.
The Band does its level best to
deserve such adulation. "We're
just a group of hard-working
individuals, trying to keep the
customer satisfied," says manager
Doug Peterson, tongue firmly in
cheek.
It is true, however, that the
Band works hard. Besides lying
aware nights trying to devise ways
of slipping obscenities past ABC
television censors, Band leaders
have been busy decorating their
new home, the old ROTC
building.
"I don't know how much it has
cost," Peterson advises. "The
Athletic Department paid for the
main construction, like installing
the doors and putting in a
sprinkler system."
Liquid Payment
Everything else we've done
ourselves, with our own labor,
which fortunately is free. You can
keep these guys going with a case
of beer every once in a while."
The Band moved out of the old
Band Shak, its home for over 50
years, last spring. About 200
students and administrators
turned out for the Shak's last
party, a BYOSH (Bring Your Own
Sledge Hammer) affair. After a
few beers, they tore the place
down, and someone set fire to the
wreckage that night.
Bandsmen are generally happy
with the new Shak. "It has
two-and-a-half times the floor
space of the old one, and we
really needed it because we're so
large," says Peterson. But
converting it from a military
installation to a musical one has
posed some problems.
The roof, some 30 feet from
the floor, was the first major
obstacle. "The sound just sort of
bounced around up there, and it
gave this place the acoustics of the
inside of a cannon barrel,"
Peterson points out. "So we've

tried to lay down a lot of old
carpet to contain the sound."
The long steel plate which used
to sit behind the targets on the
rifle range to catch bullets caused
similar difficulties, but the
Graduate School of Business
donated some large white drapes
which now hang over the plate.
Occupational Hazard
"We sand-blasted all the
walls . .. they were some sort of
blueish color that just looked
terrible," Peterson says. "We only
lost two or three guys to iron
lungs."
Bandsmen have walled off
several areas of the Shak to make
smaller conference rooms and a
lounge, where the entire front
wall of the old Shak hangs from
the ceiling.
"We just thought we ought to
keep it," explains Peterson.
The Band seems to have spent
the biggest chunk of its time
collecting decorations for the new
Shak — which consists almost
entirely of signs "borrowed" from
one place or another.
Different Signs
There's one from the state
prison at San Quentin, and
another advising that it's illegal to
steal road signs. Some signs made
a long journey before finding their
way into the Shak.

"You know, when we went to
Michigan, everyone drove. And
some of the guys took small
detours," Peterson says.
For example, "a few stopped
off in Climax, Mich, [a "Climax
City Limits" sign adorns one wall
of the Shak]."
The University of Michigan
student union is aiso minus at
least one large metal sign, and the
Michigan boosters' club somehow
lost one, too.
"There are a lot of rumors
about the booster club sign,"
muses Peterson. "I don't know
how all these rumors get
started .... Just keep an eye out
for that one. You never know
where something like that will
turn up."
Accurate Symbol
The Band's finest symbol,
though, was actually purchased,
according to Peterson. It's a store
mannequin, rescued from a Palo
Alto garage sale by a couple of
intrepid Incomparables.
"He's what every Bandsmen
wants to be, or is," Peterson says,
"He's just some dummy."
When the Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band
takes the field in a little while,
you'll be able to judge how many
of its members made it.


SIGNS OF THE TIMES — Stanford bandsmen will stop at nothing in
their continual search for signs to put on the wall of the Shak.
Bandsmembers plead "nolo contendere" to the charge that these signs
were procured by illegal means.

tried to lay down a lot of old
carpet to contain the sound."
The long steel plate which used
to sit behind the targets on the
rifle range to catch bullets caused
similar difficulties, but the
Graduate School of Business
donated some large white drapes
which now hang over the plate.
Occupational Hazard
"We sand-blasted all the
walls . .. they were some sort of
blueish color that just looked
terrible," Peterson says. "We only
lost two or three guys to iron
lungs."
Bandsmen have walled off
several areas of the Shak to make
smaller conference rooms and a
lounge, where the entire front
wall of the old Shak hangs from
the ceiling.
"We just thought we ought to
keep it," explains Peterson.
The Band seems to have spent
the biggest chunk of its time
collecting decorations for the new
Shak — which consists almost
entirely of signs "borrowed" from
one place or another.
Different Signs
There's one from the state
prison at San Quentin, and
another advising that it's illegal to
steal road signs. Some signs made
a long journey before finding their
way into the Shak.

"You know, when we went to
Michigan, everyone drove. And
some of the guys took small
detours," Peterson says.
For example, "a few stopped
off in Climax, Mich, [a "Climax
City Limits" sign adorns one wall
of the Shak]."
The University of Michigan
student union is aiso minus at
least one large metal sign, and the
Michigan boosters' club somehow
lost one, too.
"There are a lot of rumors
about the booster club sign,"
muses Peterson. "I don't know
how all these rumors get
started .... Just keep an eye out
for that one. You never know
where something like that will
turn up."
Accurate Symbol
The Band's finest symbol,
though, was actually purchased,
according to Peterson. It's a store
mannequin, rescued from a Palo
Alto garage sale by a couple of
intrepid Incomparables.
"He's what every Bandsmen
wants to be, or is," Peterson says,
"He's just some dummy."
When the Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band
takes the field in a little while,
you'll be able to judge how many
of its members made it.


SIGNS OF THE TIMES — Stanford bandsmen will stop at nothing in
their continual search for signs to put on the wall of the Shak.
Bandsmembers plead "nolo contendere" to the charge that these signs
were procured by illegal means.

HAVING A BLAST—Even the Incomparable Stanford band's tubas
look happy when stored in the new Band Shak on Galvez St. across
from the Men's Gym.
You'll hear them any minute
now. Off in the distance, they'll
sound like a tribe of neurotic
Indians, hammering crazily on
their drums and piercing the air
with off-color war whoops.
They, of course, are the
Incomparables of the Leland
Stanford Junior University Band,
and when they appear on the
horizon, they'll get a standing
ovation from the student rooting
section.
The Band does its level best to
deserve such adulation. "We're
just a group of hard-working
individuals, trying to keep the
customer satisfied," says manager
Doug Peterson, tongue firmly in
cheek.
It is true, however, that the
Band works hard. Besides lying
aware nights trying to devise ways
of slipping obscenities past ABC
television censors, Band leaders
have been busy decorating their
new home, the old ROTC
building.
"I don't know how much it has
cost," Peterson advises. "The
Athletic Department paid for the
main construction, like installing
the doors and putting in a
sprinkler system."
Liquid Payment
Everything else we've done
ourselves, with our own labor,
which fortunately is free. You can
keep these guys going with a case
of beer every once in a while."
The Band moved out of the old
Band Shak, its home for over 50
years, last spring. About 200
students and administrators
turned out for the Shak's last
party, a BYOSH (Bring Your Own
Sledge Hammer) affair. After a
few beers, they tore the place
down, and someone set fire to the
wreckage that night.
Bandsmen are generally happy
with the new Shak. "It has
two-and-a-half times the floor
space of the old one, and we
really needed it because we're so
large," says Peterson. But
converting it from a military
installation to a musical one has
posed some problems.
The roof, some 30 feet from
the floor, was the first major
obstacle. "The sound just sort of
bounced around up there, and it
gave this place the acoustics of the
inside of a cannon barrel,"
Peterson points out. "So we've

takes the field in a little while,
you'll be able to judge how many
of its members made it.


SIGNS OF THE TIMES — Stanford bandsmen will stop at nothing in
their continual search for signs to put on the wall of the Shak.
Bandsmembers plead "nolo contendere" to the charge that these signs
were procured by illegal means.

You'll hear them any minute
now. Off in the distance, they'll
sound like a tribe of neurotic
Indians, hammering crazily on
their drums and piercing the air
with off-color war whoops.
They, of course, are the
Incomparables of the Leland
Stanford Junior University Band,
and when they appear on the
horizon, they'll get a standing
ovation from the student rooting
section.
The Band does its level best to
deserve such adulation. "We're
just a group of hard-working
individuals, trying to keep the
customer satisfied," says manager
Doug Peterson, tongue firmly in
cheek.
It is true, however, that the
Band works hard. Besides lying
aware nights trying to devise ways
of slipping obscenities past ABC
television censors, Band leaders
have been busy decorating their
new home, the old ROTC
building.
"I don't know how much it has
cost," Peterson advises. "The
Athletic Department paid for the
main construction, like installing
the doors and putting in a
sprinkler system."
Liquid Payment
Everything else we've done
ourselves, with our own labor,
which fortunately is free. You can
keep these guys going with a case
of beer every once in a while."
The Band moved out of the old
Band Shak, its home for over 50
years, last spring. About 200
students and administrators
turned out for the Shak's last
party, a BYOSH (Bring Your Own
Sledge Hammer) affair. After a
few beers, they tore the place
down, and someone set fire to the
wreckage that night.
Bandsmen are generally happy
with the new Shak. "It has
two-and-a-half times the floor
space of the old one, and we
really needed it because we're so
large," says Peterson. But
converting it from a military
installation to a musical one has
posed some problems.
The roof, some 30 feet from
the floor, was the first major
obstacle. "The sound just sort of
bounced around up there, and it
gave this place the acoustics of the
inside of a cannon barrel,"
Peterson points out. "So we've

tried to lay down a lot of old
carpet to contain the sound."
The long steel plate which used
to sit behind the targets on the
rifle range to catch bullets caused
similar difficulties, but the
Graduate School of Business
donated some large white drapes
which now hang over the plate.
Occupational Hazard
"We sand-blasted all the
walls . .. they were some sort of
blueish color that just looked
terrible," Peterson says. "We only
lost two or three guys to iron
lungs."
Bandsmen have walled off
several areas of the Shak to make
smaller conference rooms and a
lounge, where the entire front
wall of the old Shak hangs from
the ceiling.
"We just thought we ought to
keep it," explains Peterson.
The Band seems to have spent
the biggest chunk of its time
collecting decorations for the new
Shak — which consists almost
entirely of signs "borrowed" from
one place or another.
Different Signs
There's one from the state
prison at San Quentin, and
another advising that it's illegal to
steal road signs. Some signs made
a long journey before finding their
way into the Shak.

"You know, when we went to
Michigan, everyone drove. And
some of the guys took small
detours," Peterson says.
For example, "a few stopped
off in Climax, Mich, [a "Climax
City Limits" sign adorns one wall
of the Shak]."
The University of Michigan
student union is aiso minus at
least one large metal sign, and the
Michigan boosters' club somehow
lost one, too.
"There are a lot of rumors
about the booster club sign,"
muses Peterson. "I don't know
how all these rumors get
started .... Just keep an eye out
for that one. You never know
where something like that will
turn up."
Accurate Symbol
The Band's finest symbol,
though, was actually purchased,
according to Peterson. It's a store
mannequin, rescued from a Palo
Alto garage sale by a couple of
intrepid Incomparables.
"He's what every Bandsmen
wants to be, or is," Peterson says,
"He's just some dummy."
