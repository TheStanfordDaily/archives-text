ERUPTING VOLCANO? — No, it's just a spectacular fire in a dead end canyon just north of Old Page Mill Road that
sent Stanford, Palo Alto and Los Altos firemen racing to the scene Saturday night. The blaze burned furiously for several
hours on piles of dead tree trunks and hedge clippings from University flora. Stanford fire officials said the fire, which lit
the sky with an orange glow visible from campus, may have been caused by spontaneous combustion.
