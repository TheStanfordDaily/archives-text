## Prison Seeks Administrator 
### 
Ed Kohit

GREENVILLE, Miss., Oct. 7 -
"Wanted — trained prison
administrator, simultaneously
able to satisfy state officials,
inmates, edgy neighbors, U.S.
Justice Dept., federal judges, civil
rights attys. Must also have
agricultural management
experience. House and domestic
help furnished. Salary to $32,500.
Must be ready to assume position
immediately. Apply William L.
Waller, governor, State of
Mississippi."
This help-wanted
advertisement is of course
fictional, but the situation it
portrays is very real. Mississippi
state officials, after ten months of
what they term "good faith
efforts," are unable to find a
competent administrator for the
state's one prison, the Mississippi
State Penitentiary at Parchman.
Parchman, or "The Farm" (as
the prison is generally known), is
a sprawling 22,000-acre farm near
the Delta town of Drew. About
2000 prisoners, most of them
black, are incarcerated there at
any one time.
It is one of the nation's last
prisons that is run for a profit;
one state official recently
established that its farming
operations — aided by a
multi-million-dollar cotton
subsidy — will clear about
$500,000 this year.
Untrained Employees
Until recently, in fact, all of
the prison's superintendents were

farmers or plantation managers.
Many of the guards are
second-generation Parchman
employees — born and raised on
The Farm — despite the 72-hour
workweeks and salaries that only
recently were raised $200 to $700
a month. Few employees are
trained in penology; court records
show that many have been
evaluated as unstable.
But during the past 10 years
(after large numbers of civil rights
demonstrators were incarcerated
there) Parchman has come under
heavy fire from several quarters.
Inmates have filed a dazzling array
of lawsuits against prison officials
and the state penitentiary board.
Every aspect of the prison,
ranging from its segregation of
prisoners to its inadequate
medical facilities to its parole
policies, has been attlteked in
federal court, and the prisoners'
batting average is at least .500.
A U.S. District Court judge
ordered one year ago that the
campus at the prison be
integrated; that another doctor
and a dentist be hired; that the
camp conditions be improved;
that prisoners could not be forced
to work 15-hour workdays; etc.
The judge also ordered the
phasing-out of "armed shooter
trustys" — inmates given guns and
told to shoot at other inmates
who did not follow their orders.
Most of the shooter trustys were
in Parchman for murder, rape or
assault convictions.

The judge has also ordered
state officials to find a trained
superintendent to take over for
the current acting superintendent,
a highway patrolman with
experience on the Senate Internal
Security Committee who later
became a police chief in a town
about 30 miles from the prison.
The judge's orders have
irritated state officials, and the
state attorney general will argue
that they should be reversed in an
appeal court hearing later this
week.
Most state officials connected
with the prison and the
penitentiary board express doubt
that they'll ever find a
superintendent who can satisfy all
of the interested parties — not the
least of whom is the federal judge,
who has hired a part-time
"monitor" to serve as his "eyes
and ears" at the prison and to
report on official compliance with
his orders.
One member of the state
attorney general's staff expressed
a common sentiment in a
conversation with a reporter last
week: "A man would have to be
almost crazy before he'd become
superintendent at Parchman.
There are just too many people
making demands."
