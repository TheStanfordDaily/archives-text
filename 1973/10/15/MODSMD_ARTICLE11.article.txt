On the way to work this
morning I observed a near
accident involving a bicycle and
an automobile.
In the past few years it has
become fashionable to ride a
bicycle. It is so popular that it
often seems as if bicycles
out-number automobiles on

campus. This may be desirable
from one point of view, but many
bike riders do not seem to realize
that they are riding a potentially
dangerous vehicle.
I have narrowly escaped
accident a number of times, both
as a pedestrian and as a driver.
Others have not been as fortunate,
and there have been many
accidents. Some of these were of a
serious nature, and at least one

fatal.
This morning, I spoke to a
representative of the Stanford
Police Department who indicated
that, if bicycle riders would
observe the common rules of the
road, most accidents could be
avoided.
There are four main causes of
bicycle accidents: Failure to
observe stop signs, many of which
have been posted around campus

especially for bicycles; riding on
the wrong side of the road; lack of
or improper equipment; and last,
but not least, CARELESSNESS!
Bicycle registration is already a
fact, but enforcement of the rules
of the road is lax. Under the
circumstances it is just a matter of
time until ....
Our lives are already controlled
too much. BICYCLISTS, PLEASE
RIDE CAREFULLY!

The BART system is modern,
comfortable, fast and offers
frequent service. Unfortunately,
the Mid-Peninsula has no direct
transit link to the BART system.
We need a bus line running
from Stanford and Palo Alto
across the Dumbarton Bridge via
Route 84 to the BART station in
Fremont. Presently, the Santa
Clara County Transit District
provides San Jose with a link to
BART with Line 45, which runs
from downtown north to the
Fremont BART station.
If you have three or four hours
available for a leisurely,
meandering tour of Mountain
View, Sunnyvale, Santa Clara, San
Jose and Milpitas, and you don't
mind making four bus transfers,
then you can use our District's
bus lines to go from Palo Alto to
the Fremont BART station. If
you have even more time and
energy to make a total of five bus
transfers, you can use our
District's bus lines to go from
Stanford (in front of the Quad) to
the Fremont BART station, by
way of Palo Alto, Mountain View,
Sunnyvale, Santa Clara, San Jose,
and Milpitas.
If you want a direct bus link
from Stanford and Palo Alto
across the Dumbarton Bridge to
the Fremont BART station, please
write to the Santa Clara County
Board of Supervisors, 155 Berger
Drive, San Jose, 95112.

Three cheers for Chris Hocker's
column "U.S. Should Not
Interfere With Chile," October 10.
I was shocked to see that several
students thought Allende's
government was doing a good job
and that it is time for us to
intervene. All Allende proved was
that Marxism does not work in a
historically capitalistic society
with a strong, determined
middle-class.
Chile's people were suffering
great hardships under Allende's
government with hundreds of
professional people illegally
leaving the country daily and
inflation soaring. Severe food
shortages forced housewives to
buy groceries on the black market
or go without.
The people of Chile are capable
of pulling through this disaster
and returning to their pre-Allende
system. Let's allow them to do so
without U.S. intervention.

In view of the fact that
undergraduate women now have
the opportunity to participate in a
serious intercollegiate field
hockey conference, I am asking
for the cooperation of all those
who use the hockey fields behind
the Women's Gymnasium. As a
matter of safety, the athletic use
of these fields should be restricted
to the women's field hockey team
for the duration of Fall Quarter.
Field hockey is a very fast
moving game that requires tight
ball control. Torn up turf often
causes a hockey player to trip or a
ball to stop, completely ruining a
play. Another hazard is running
into footballs, jerseys, and
football players who daringly run
for passes during our hockey
practices. A single football
scrimmage on a wet or rainy day
can ruin the fields for the season.
All those who play football,
soccer, or otherwise use the fields
in such a way that threatens the
safety or quality of field hockey
are requested to find other
playing fields for use during
Autumn Quarter. We reject the
idea of fencing in a field that
serves, in a variety of ways, so
many people throughout the year.
Your consideration will be
thoroughly appreciated.

The BART system is modern,
comfortable, fast and offers
frequent service. Unfortunately,
the Mid-Peninsula has no direct
transit link to the BART system.
We need a bus line running
from Stanford and Palo Alto
across the Dumbarton Bridge via
Route 84 to the BART station in
Fremont. Presently, the Santa
Clara County Transit District
provides San Jose with a link to
BART with Line 45, which runs
from downtown north to the
Fremont BART station.
If you have three or four hours
available for a leisurely,
meandering tour of Mountain
View, Sunnyvale, Santa Clara, San
Jose and Milpitas, and you don't
mind making four bus transfers,
then you can use our District's
bus lines to go from Palo Alto to
the Fremont BART station. If
you have even more time and
energy to make a total of five bus
transfers, you can use our
District's bus lines to go from
Stanford (in front of the Quad) to
the Fremont BART station, by
way of Palo Alto, Mountain View,
Sunnyvale, Santa Clara, San Jose,
and Milpitas.
If you want a direct bus link
from Stanford and Palo Alto
across the Dumbarton Bridge to
the Fremont BART station, please
write to the Santa Clara County
Board of Supervisors, 155 Berger
Drive, San Jose, 95112.

Three cheers for Chris Hocker's
column "U.S. Should Not
Interfere With Chile," October 10.
I was shocked to see that several
students thought Allende's
government was doing a good job
and that it is time for us to
intervene. All Allende proved was
that Marxism does not work in a
historically capitalistic society
with a strong, determined
middle-class.
Chile's people were suffering
great hardships under Allende's
government with hundreds of
professional people illegally
leaving the country daily and
inflation soaring. Severe food
shortages forced housewives to
buy groceries on the black market
or go without.
The people of Chile are capable
of pulling through this disaster
and returning to their pre-Allende
system. Let's allow them to do so
without U.S. intervention.

In view of the fact that
undergraduate women now have
the opportunity to participate in a
serious intercollegiate field
hockey conference, I am asking
for the cooperation of all those
who use the hockey fields behind
the Women's Gymnasium. As a
matter of safety, the athletic use
of these fields should be restricted
to the women's field hockey team
for the duration of Fall Quarter.
Field hockey is a very fast
moving game that requires tight
ball control. Torn up turf often
causes a hockey player to trip or a
ball to stop, completely ruining a
play. Another hazard is running
into footballs, jerseys, and
football players who daringly run
for passes during our hockey
practices. A single football
scrimmage on a wet or rainy day
can ruin the fields for the season.
All those who play football,
soccer, or otherwise use the fields
in such a way that threatens the
safety or quality of field hockey
are requested to find other
playing fields for use during
Autumn Quarter. We reject the
idea of fencing in a field that
serves, in a variety of ways, so
many people throughout the year.
Your consideration will be
thoroughly appreciated.

On the way to work this
morning I observed a near
accident involving a bicycle and
an automobile.
In the past few years it has
become fashionable to ride a
bicycle. It is so popular that it
often seems as if bicycles
out-number automobiles on

campus. This may be desirable
from one point of view, but many
bike riders do not seem to realize
that they are riding a potentially
dangerous vehicle.
I have narrowly escaped
accident a number of times, both
as a pedestrian and as a driver.
Others have not been as fortunate,
and there have been many
accidents. Some of these were of a
serious nature, and at least one

fatal.
This morning, I spoke to a
representative of the Stanford
Police Department who indicated
that, if bicycle riders would
observe the common rules of the
road, most accidents could be
avoided.
There are four main causes of
bicycle accidents: Failure to
observe stop signs, many of which
have been posted around campus

especially for bicycles; riding on
the wrong side of the road; lack of
or improper equipment; and last,
but not least, CARELESSNESS!
Bicycle registration is already a
fact, but enforcement of the rules
of the road is lax. Under the
circumstances it is just a matter of

Praise For Hocker
Editor:
Three cheers for Chris Hocker's
column "U.S. Should Not
Interfere With Chile," October 10.
I was shocked to see that several
students thought Allende's
government was doing a good job
and that it is time for us to
intervene. All Allende proved was
that Marxism does not work in a
historically capitalistic society
with a strong, determined
middle-class.
Chile's people were suffering
great hardships under Allende's
government with hundreds of
professional people illegally
leaving the country daily and
inflation soaring. Severe food
shortages forced housewives to
buy groceries on the black market
or go without.
The people of Chile are capable
of pulling through this disaster
and returning to their pre-Allende
system. Let's allow them to do so
without U.S. intervention.

In view of the fact that
undergraduate women now have
the opportunity to participate in a
serious intercollegiate field
hockey conference, I am asking
for the cooperation of all those
who use the hockey fields behind
the Women's Gymnasium. As a
matter of safety, the athletic use
of these fields should be restricted
to the women's field hockey team
for the duration of Fall Quarter.
Field hockey is a very fast
moving game that requires tight
ball control. Torn up turf often
causes a hockey player to trip or a
ball to stop, completely ruining a
play. Another hazard is running
into footballs, jerseys, and
football players who daringly run
for passes during our hockey
practices. A single football
scrimmage on a wet or rainy day
can ruin the fields for the season.
All those who play football,
soccer, or otherwise use the fields
in such a way that threatens the
safety or quality of field hockey
are requested to find other
playing fields for use during
Autumn Quarter. We reject the
idea of fencing in a field that
serves, in a variety of ways, so
many people throughout the year.
Your consideration will be
thoroughly appreciated.

Bicycling Suggestions
Editor:
On the way to work this
morning I observed a near
accident involving a bicycle and
an automobile.
In the past few years it has
become fashionable to ride a
bicycle. It is so popular that it
often seems as if bicycles
out-number automobiles on

campus. This may be desirable
from one point of view, but many
bike riders do not seem to realize
that they are riding a potentially
dangerous vehicle.
I have narrowly escaped
accident a number of times, both
as a pedestrian and as a driver.
Others have not been as fortunate,
and there have been many
accidents. Some of these were of a
serious nature, and at least one

fatal.
This morning, I spoke to a
representative of the Stanford
Police Department who indicated
that, if bicycle riders would
observe the common rules of the
road, most accidents could be
avoided.
There are four main causes of
bicycle accidents: Failure to
observe stop signs, many of which
have been posted around campus

especially for bicycles; riding on
the wrong side of the road; lack of
or improper equipment; and last,
but not least, CARELESSNESS!
Bicycle registration is already a
fact, but enforcement of the rules
of the road is lax. Under the
circumstances it is just a matter of
time until ....
Our lives are already controlled
too much. BICYCLISTS, PLEASE
RIDE CAREFULLY!

We Need.BART
Editor:
The BART system is modern,
comfortable, fast and offers
frequent service. Unfortunately,
the Mid-Peninsula has no direct
transit link to the BART system.
We need a bus line running
from Stanford and Palo Alto
across the Dumbarton Bridge via
Route 84 to the BART station in
Fremont. Presently, the Santa
Clara County Transit District
provides San Jose with a link to
BART with Line 45, which runs
from downtown north to the
Fremont BART station.
If you have three or four hours
available for a leisurely,
meandering tour of Mountain
View, Sunnyvale, Santa Clara, San
Jose and Milpitas, and you don't
mind making four bus transfers,
then you can use our District's
bus lines to go from Palo Alto to
the Fremont BART station. If
you have even more time and
energy to make a total of five bus
transfers, you can use our
District's bus lines to go from
Stanford (in front of the Quad) to
the Fremont BART station, by
way of Palo Alto, Mountain View,
Sunnyvale, Santa Clara, San Jose,
and Milpitas.
If you want a direct bus link
from Stanford and Palo Alto
across the Dumbarton Bridge to
the Fremont BART station, please
write to the Santa Clara County
Board of Supervisors, 155 Berger
Drive, San Jose, 95112.
