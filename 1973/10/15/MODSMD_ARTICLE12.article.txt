# Controversial Tax Initiative
## McCloskey Urges Prop. One Defeat 
### STEPHEN CARTER 
Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr.,
R Menlo Park, urged the defeat of
Prop. 1, the controversial budget
ceiling and income tax initiative,
in a speech at Palo Alto High
School Friday night.
Calling the proposal
"substantially an evil thing,"
McCloskey cited its length and
complexity, and told the crowd of
about 150, "My rule of thumb is,
if you can't understand
something, vote against it." He
expressed concern at "a regressive
tax" hidden in the proposition,
adding he supported some of the
proposal's intents, but not its
methods.
McCloskey spoke on a variety
of subjects, concentrating on
campaign reform legislation and
the "tricks" used by incumbent
congressmen to help assure
reelection. He drew frequent
cheers and applause from the

crowd with examples drawn from
the Agnew case and his criticism
of Congress as "slow-moving" and
chiefly interested in insuring
reelection of its own members.
'Crucial Issue'
Referring to "the crucial issue
this year, the question of whether
we restore the faith of the people
in our political process,"
McCloskey called the influence of
money in campaigns
"all-important."
He noted that 90 percent of
campaign contributions come
from the 10 percent of the people
directly affected by congressional
actions. Only the wealthy,
McCloskey pointed out, can
afford substantial contributions,
and "Congress is naturally
reluctant to pass legislation
changing this."
He claimed this causes "many
young people [to turn] away
from the political process

entirely." McCloskey explained
that Congress will not enact
"meaningful" campaign legislation
"unless there is an informed
public that demands it,"and cited
the Anderson-Udall bill (HR
7612) as the bill "having the most
merit, and mo6t innovative."
Tax Credit
The bill, said McCloskey, offers
a tax credit for small contributors.
Ideally, he added, the donations —
of which one-half can be deducted
from income tax — should have
upper limits of $50. He also
suggested a limit on single
contributions of $25,000 for
presidential elections, $5000 for
senatorial contests and $3000 for
House races.
Calling for "safer, public
contributions," McCloskey also
urged that the public treasury
match for each candidate up to
$10,000 collected in donations of
$50 or less, noting this would
force the candidate to develop "a
sizeable constituency."
McCloskey also suggested a
ceiling on total election spending,
pointing out "the politician
knows that if his name is known,
he'll be elected." He called "name
recognition" an important asset,
because "the apathetic, uncaring,
unknowledgeable elector" still
wants "to think [he's] cast an
educated ballot." Observing that
the public returned 95 percent of
the incumbents to Congress last
year, McCloskey explained all
incumbents will continue to be
reelected unless the public
connects their names "with a
disagreeable gut issue."
Free Time
Finally, McCloskey urged that
challengers be given free television
time, under suitable regulations,
and two free mailings over the
course of a campaign, to
counteract the incumbent's
overwhelming "name recognition"
advantage.
On other matters, McCloskey
said of President Nixon's vice

presidential nominee, Rep. Gerald
Ford, R-Mich., "I almost got
drunk tonight in the joy of
knowing there's finally an honest
man in the White House, Jerry
Ford."
In response to a question, he
expressed doubt that Congress
would move to impeach the
President unless "he refuses a
Supreme Court decision on the
tapes." In any case, he pointed
out, the Congress probably would
take no action one way or the
other until resolution of the
current Middle East conflict.
The League of Women Voters,
which McCloskey accused of
"discrimination on account of
sex," sponsored his appearance.

McCloskey called the influence of
money in campaigns
"all-important."
He noted that 90 percent of
campaign contributions come
from the 10 percent of the people
directly affected by congressional
actions. Only the wealthy,
McCloskey pointed out, can
afford substantial contributions,
and "Congress is naturally
reluctant to pass legislation
changing this."
He claimed this causes "many
young people [to turn] away
from the political process

entirely." McCloskey explained
that Congress will not enact
"meaningful" campaign legislation
"unless there is an informed
public that demands it,"and cited
the Anderson-Udall bill (HR
7612) as the bill "having the most
merit, and mo6t innovative."
Tax Credit
The bill, said McCloskey, offers
a tax credit for small contributors.
Ideally, he added, the donations —
of which one-half can be deducted
from income tax — should have
upper limits of $50. He also
suggested a limit on single
contributions of $25,000 for
presidential elections, $5000 for
senatorial contests and $3000 for
House races.
Calling for "safer, public
contributions," McCloskey also
urged that the public treasury
match for each candidate up to
$10,000 collected in donations of
$50 or less, noting this would
force the candidate to develop "a
sizeable constituency."
McCloskey also suggested a
ceiling on total election spending,
pointing out "the politician
knows that if his name is known,
he'll be elected." He called "name
recognition" an important asset,
because "the apathetic, uncaring,
unknowledgeable elector" still
wants "to think [he's] cast an
educated ballot." Observing that
the public returned 95 percent of
the incumbents to Congress last
year, McCloskey explained all
incumbents will continue to be
reelected unless the public
connects their names "with a
disagreeable gut issue."
Free Time
Finally, McCloskey urged that
challengers be given free television
time, under suitable regulations,
and two free mailings over the
course of a campaign, to
counteract the incumbent's
overwhelming "name recognition"
advantage.
On other matters, McCloskey
said of President Nixon's vice

presidential nominee, Rep. Gerald
Ford, R-Mich., "I almost got
drunk tonight in the joy of
knowing there's finally an honest
man in the White House, Jerry
Ford."
In response to a question, he
expressed doubt that Congress
would move to impeach the
President unless "he refuses a
Supreme Court decision on the
tapes." In any case, he pointed
out, the Congress probably would
take no action one way or the
other until resolution of the
current Middle East conflict.
The League of Women Voters,
which McCloskey accused of
"discrimination on account of
sex," sponsored his appearance.

PAUL N. McCLOSKEY JR
Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr.,
R Menlo Park, urged the defeat of
Prop. 1, the controversial budget
ceiling and income tax initiative,
in a speech at Palo Alto High
School Friday night.
Calling the proposal
"substantially an evil thing,"
McCloskey cited its length and
complexity, and told the crowd of
about 150, "My rule of thumb is,
if you can't understand
something, vote against it." He
expressed concern at "a regressive
tax" hidden in the proposition,
adding he supported some of the
proposal's intents, but not its
methods.
McCloskey spoke on a variety
of subjects, concentrating on
campaign reform legislation and
the "tricks" used by incumbent
congressmen to help assure
reelection. He drew frequent
cheers and applause from the

crowd with examples drawn from
the Agnew case and his criticism
of Congress as "slow-moving" and
chiefly interested in insuring
reelection of its own members.
'Crucial Issue'
Referring to "the crucial issue
this year, the question of whether
we restore the faith of the people
in our political process,"
McCloskey called the influence of
money in campaigns
"all-important."
He noted that 90 percent of
campaign contributions come
from the 10 percent of the people
directly affected by congressional
actions. Only the wealthy,
