# Ford A Safe Choice
## Nixon Opts For 'Middle Course'

WASHINGTON (AP)
President Nixon's choice of Rep.
Gerald R. Ford for vice president
avoids two courses that could
have had major implications
within the Republican party.
The first would have been to
pick one of the major 1976
presidential contenders, John
Connally, Gov. Nelson A.
Rockefeller of New York or Gov.
Ronald Reagan of California.
But resentment of Connally's
switch from Democrat to
Republican and a wariness
towards him among GOP
lawmakers would have caused the
threat of rejection.
If any of the three men became
vice president, he would have
three years to build support
among Republican party leaders
and the public for the 1976
presidential nomination.
To a lesser extent, this would
have been true had Nixon taken a
second course and selected one of
the lesser known, younger
Republicans considered the GOP
hope beyond 1976.
This group includes NATO
Ambassador Donald Rumsfeld,
Republican National Chairman

George Bush, Deputy Atty. Gen.
William Ruckelshaus, Indianapolis
Mayor Richard Lugar and Govs.
Robert Ray of lowa and Daniel
Evans of Washington.
Sen. Howard H. Baker Jr. of
Tennessee and Atty. Gen. Elliot
L. Richardson, both 1976
possibilities could have been
included in the list, but were ruled
out because of their roles in the

Watergate investigation.
By choosing Ford, who says"I
have no intention of being a
candidate for any political office
in 1976," Nixon took the safe
middle course that could have
relatively little impact on the
Republican future.
If Nixon and Ford finish their
terms and retire, the GOP race in
1976 could be wide open for the

first time since 1952, although
two things could change this.
First, as some congressmen are
saying, Ford could be drawn into
a 1976 presidential race by three
successful years in the vice
presidency.
Second, the question of the
White House tape recordings of
Nixon's conversations hangs over
the President.
