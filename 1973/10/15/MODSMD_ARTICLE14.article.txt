# New Computer Center OK'd
## 
### 
A contract for the design of a
new $2.9 million Computation
Center at the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC) has
been signed by the University
with the Palo Alto architectural
firm of Albert Hoover and
Associates.
Stanford operates the research
center and its two-mile linear
electron accelerator under
contract with the U.S. Atomic
Energy Commission.
Construction of the
50,000-square-foot, three-story
building is scheduled to begin
next summer, according to the
announcement by SLAC Deputy

Director Sidney D. Drell. It is
expected to be ready for
occupancy by August 1975.
The new building will be
located just east of the present
SLAC Computation Center which
it will replace. The center's
present IBM 360/91 computer
will be moved into the new
building, together with two new
IBM 370/168 computers due to
be delivered late this year. It will
also contain several smaller
computer systems.
The computers are used in
analyzing results of experiments
in elementary particle physics for
which the accelerator was built.

Approximately 100 scientists and
technicians from SLAC's
Computation Group and the
Stanford Center for Information
Processing will be needed to man
the new computer facility.
The design contract also calls
for three subcontractors: civil
engineers Brian, Kangas, Foulk
and Associates of Redwood City;
structural engineers Pregnoff,
Matheu and Beebe, San Francisco;
and landscape architects
Arutunian and Kinney, Palo Alto.
SLAC personnel will supply
electrical and mechanical
engineering plus technical
management for the project.
