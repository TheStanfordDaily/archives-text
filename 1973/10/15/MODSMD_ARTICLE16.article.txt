# Education Subsidies
## Voucher System Debated 
### PETER ALESHIRE 
"There is a big battle as to
whether we should move toward
the voucher system, and that
battle is really raging," said Frank
Newman, director of University
Relations.
' The voucher system is a
long-discussed proposal to
subsidize higher education by
direct grants, or loans, of public
money to students to be used at
the institution of their choice.
"To an extent it already
happens," said Newman. "In
higher education there is already a
significant amount of vouchering.
Students pay some costs out of
pocket. There are state and
federal programs, private funds
and the GI bill also."
Assoc. Education Prof. Henry
M. Levin explained the voucher
system in a recent article in
Change magazine and in a Daily
interview.
Student Grants
Under a voucher type system,
Levin wrote, "Students would
receive grants and loans that could
be applied to tuition and other
costs of attending either public or
private institutions. The amount
of the grants or loans that
students would be eligible for
would be determined by family
income and assets.
"Public institutions would be
expected to raise their tuitions to
levels that more nearly
approximate their costs, and their
public subsidies would be
provided principally through the
funds made available to students
rather than through institutional
support. Independent and public
institutions would compete for
students on the basis of their cost
and the quality of their
educational offerings."
Four Reasons
Levin cited four reasons for the
increased interest in the system.
First, rising costs have strained
state and federal budgets. "The
low tuitions of the public
institutions mean that the state
subsidizes a high proportion of
the costs of all students who
attend . - Some of the public
burden would be shifted to those
families who can afford to pay as
well as to the college graduates
who would be required to repay
the loan after they started
working," said Levin.

Second, "the financial squeeze
on the independent colleges and
universities must be considered.
As the tuition gap has widened
between public and private
institutions, the independent
colleges and universities have lost
many applicants and enrolees."
Third is the inefficiency of
many educational institutions.
"Competition among institutions
will tend to increase the
responsiveness to student needs
and more efficient resource use,"
wrote Levin.
Fourth, present arrangements
"subsidize the rich more than the
poor." Levin pointed out that
present state subsidies to the UC
campuses amount to $3000 per
year per student. Since the
children of higher income families
are generally the ones who attend
college, they reap the benefits.
"It's the same thing as the public
investing $12,000 in that guy. In
the vouchers, that $12,000 will be
paid for by the guy in the rich
family. Part of the plan is to say
[that] those that can pay will, but
those who can't, get loans and
grants.
Open Door
"The argument in favor of low
tuition is to keep the door open.
You must argue then that it is a
subsidy of the poor. I'm not going
to get as much out of the system
as I put in it. That's my social
responsibility in being rich," said
Levin.
Levin said the vouchers should
not be limited to college expenses.
"People not going to college
should be eligible to invest in a
whole variety of other ventures.
Now what we do is bias this huge
public expenditure in a very
narrow field of training. There are
a lot of people in college that
would rather be in other things."
Levin said the voucher system
could be used for trade schools, or
for initial investments to get
started in a trade. He also
suggested that the voucher would
not have to be used immediately
if a person hadn't decided how
they wanted to use it.
Supports System
Newman also supported the
idea of a voucher system. "I think
it would be a useful thing to move
in that direction, but I don't think
it is Stanford's place to suggest it
to the UC's.

"It is useful to compete. If we
didn't do a good job students
wouldn't come to Stanford. The
trend in the public sector is to
avoid that kind of competition."
Direct Aid
Stanford has taken steps to
increase state and federal direct
aid to the student. The 1972
Education Amendments produced
the Basic Opportunity Grant
program and some Stanford
lobbying.
"Stanford argued for aid to the
student. They put both direct and
institutional aid in, but in fact
they didn't fund the institutional
aid part. Most of the legislators
started behind institutional aid
and swung over to student aid,"
said Newman.
The University had less success
in helping a bill through the state
legislature this year. "The
California Scholarship program is
in part a voucher system, it helps
equalize the cost of tuition. There
was a bill that proposed to go
further. The bill didn't get
through the legislature this year,
but I expect it will be revived next
year and have a good chance,"
said Newman.
Not Faddish
Newman noted that the
voucher system would probably
not completely replace direct
institutional aid. "I do think you
need some institutional aid. You
can't leave everything at the
mercy of the whim of the
moment. You want the university
to be responsive but you don't
want them to be so responsive
they're simply faddish."
Newman also said the voucher
system could make the Stanford
student body more diverse since
lower income groups could meet
costs with the aid of vouchers.
Robert Huff, financial aids
director, was more dubious
concerning a voucher system's
effect here. "I would need to
know more about the specific
system before making any firm
predictions, but I can't see us
being any better off under a
voucher system."
'Good Institution'
On the other hand, Huff didn't
seem to feel the voucher system
would do the University any
harm. "The general assumption is
that Stanford is a good institution
to attend and we would have as
good a chance as any to attract
students."
However, Huff did not feel the
voucher system was an immediate
possibility. "I don't see, on the
basis of my contacts with people
in Sacramento and Washington,
that the voucher system is being
pushed as a system that should be
followed," he said.
