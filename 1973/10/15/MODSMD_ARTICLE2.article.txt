# Staff Wants Choice Of Charity
## Drive Revives Controversy 
### JOHN FREED 
The kickoff of charity drives across
the nation this week pointed up a
continuing controversy over the right
of employees here to give to the
charity of their choice through payroll
deduction plans.
The payroll plans, in which an
employee sets aside a certain amount
per month for a worthy cause, have
funneled money exclusively into the
Santa Clara County United Fund over
the years. Some employees want that
changed, according to the Committee
on Faculty-Staff Affairs (C-FSA).
"The committee . . . perceived
dissatisfactions with present policy
and procedures for solicitation of
charitable contributions from faculty
and staff," according to William
Robertson, C-FSA chairman. Many
employees were upset that they could
not have money set aside for agencies
other than the United Fund.
One such group is the Bay Area
Combined Health Agency Drive
(CHAD), which includes many
agencies not supported by the United
Fund. Their request over a year ago to
be included in a payroll deduction
plan sparked the present controversy.
Rebuffed
CHAD was rebuffed by President
Richard Lyman. William Stone,
assistant to Lyman, explained Lyman's
position.
"We've been pushing the idea that
they [CHAD and the United Fund]
get together in one drive at Stanford.
We're trying to get all the attractive
agencies under one umbrella," Stone
said. But spokesmen for both the
United Fund and CHAD said they had
never heard of such a plan.
Models
Two models exist for implementing
a multi-agency charity drive. The first,
proposed by C-FSA, follows a system
used successfully by Lockheed Corp.
A nine-member committee would
establish how proceeds from a
University-wide fund drive would be
distributed among several different
charities. Lyman rejected this as being
too bureaucratic.

The second plan, modeled after the
Combined Federal Campaign for
federal employees, would allow
options for donating to several
different charities on one pledge card.
This idea is still being "kicked
around," according to Stone.
The C-FSA plan would necessitate
hiring a half-time executive secretary.
Lyman, in a letter addressed to
Robertson, criticized this aspect.
'Additional Burden'
"The cumbersomeness and
additional burden of our trying, in
effect, to set up our own version of

the United Fund within the University
makes me most unenthusiastic about
attempting it," Lyman wrote.
The committee "apparently has
misunderstood" their orders, assuming
Lyman wanted agencies other than the
United Fund included in the Stanford
campaign. In a carefully worded
statement, Robertson expressed his
view of Lyman's position.
"The committee reaffirms its
recommendation, with which you
agreed, that some means be devised for
broadening the number and nature of
the beneficiaries of an annual
solicitation," Robertson wrote Lyman.
Fund Opposed
The United Fund had opposed
inclusion of CHAD in the payroll plan.
William Cuthbertson, a United Fund
spokesman, claimed that "our position
is [that] experience shows that
whenever you have a competing
payroll deduction plan, both agencies
will lose."
(Last year, 51 percent of all
University contributors gave over

$34,000 to the United Fund through
the payroll plan. Those who gave
directly put less than $24,000 in the
Fund's coffers.)
"Obviously, no one is prevented
from giving to CHAD. They would
have to do it on their own, not
through the University," said Stone as
he defended Lyman's decision.
A point of dispute over including
CHAD centered on that charity's
administrative costs. Robert Trefry, a
CHAD spokesman, explained why his
organization's expenses ran over the
typical five percent figure used by the
United Fund.
"Last year, CHAD had pledged
about $64,000, with administrative
costs about $43,000. However, as a
result of conversations with United
Airlines in the spring of 1972, they
agreed to begin an employee payroll
deduction plan. They later decided to
send the funds directly to the agencies
involved, rather than through the
CHAD office, in the amount of about
$123,000," Trefry explained.
Administrative costs were about 22
percent of all charitable giving in the
first year of operation. Trefry expects
that figure to drop to about 12
percent this year and about five
percent within a few years. The
percentage cutback stems from a
sixfold increase in persons solicited
over the last year, according to Trefry.

The payroll plans, in which an
employee sets aside a certain amount
per month for a worthy cause, have
funneled money exclusively into the
Santa Clara County United Fund over
the years. Some employees want that
changed, according to the Committee
on Faculty-Staff Affairs (C-FSA).
"The committee . . . perceived
dissatisfactions with present policy
and procedures for solicitation of
charitable contributions from faculty
and staff," according to William
Robertson, C-FSA chairman. Many
employees were upset that they could
not have money set aside for agencies
other than the United Fund.
One such group is the Bay Area
Combined Health Agency Drive
(CHAD), which includes many
agencies not supported by the United
Fund. Their request over a year ago to
be included in a payroll deduction
plan sparked the present controversy.
Rebuffed
CHAD was rebuffed by President
Richard Lyman. William Stone,
assistant to Lyman, explained Lyman's
position.
"We've been pushing the idea that
they [CHAD and the United Fund]
get together in one drive at Stanford.
We're trying to get all the attractive
agencies under one umbrella," Stone
said. But spokesmen for both the
United Fund and CHAD said they had
never heard of such a plan.
Models
Two models exist for implementing
a multi-agency charity drive. The first,
proposed by C-FSA, follows a system
used successfully by Lockheed Corp.
A nine-member committee would
establish how proceeds from a
University-wide fund drive would be
distributed among several different
charities. Lyman rejected this as being
too bureaucratic.

The second plan, modeled after the
Combined Federal Campaign for
federal employees, would allow
options for donating to several
different charities on one pledge card.
This idea is still being "kicked
around," according to Stone.
The C-FSA plan would necessitate
hiring a half-time executive secretary.
Lyman, in a letter addressed to
Robertson, criticized this aspect.
'Additional Burden'
"The cumbersomeness and
additional burden of our trying, in
effect, to set up our own version of

the United Fund within the University
makes me most unenthusiastic about
attempting it," Lyman wrote.
The committee "apparently has
misunderstood" their orders, assuming
Lyman wanted agencies other than the
United Fund included in the Stanford
campaign. In a carefully worded
statement, Robertson expressed his
view of Lyman's position.
"The committee reaffirms its
recommendation, with which you
agreed, that some means be devised for
broadening the number and nature of
the beneficiaries of an annual
solicitation," Robertson wrote Lyman.
Fund Opposed
The United Fund had opposed
inclusion of CHAD in the payroll plan.
William Cuthbertson, a United Fund
spokesman, claimed that "our position
is [that] experience shows that
whenever you have a competing
payroll deduction plan, both agencies
will lose."
(Last year, 51 percent of all
University contributors gave over

$34,000 to the United Fund through
the payroll plan. Those who gave
directly put less than $24,000 in the
Fund's coffers.)
"Obviously, no one is prevented
from giving to CHAD. They would
have to do it on their own, not
through the University," said Stone as
he defended Lyman's decision.
A point of dispute over including
CHAD centered on that charity's
administrative costs. Robert Trefry, a
CHAD spokesman, explained why his
organization's expenses ran over the
typical five percent figure used by the
United Fund.
"Last year, CHAD had pledged
about $64,000, with administrative
costs about $43,000. However, as a
result of conversations with United
Airlines in the spring of 1972, they
agreed to begin an employee payroll
deduction plan. They later decided to
send the funds directly to the agencies
involved, rather than through the
CHAD office, in the amount of about
$123,000," Trefry explained.
Administrative costs were about 22
percent of all charitable giving in the
first year of operation. Trefry expects
that figure to drop to about 12
percent this year and about five
percent within a few years. The
percentage cutback stems from a
sixfold increase in persons solicited
over the last year, according to Trefry.
The kickoff of charity drives across
the nation this week pointed up a
continuing controversy over the right
of employees here to give to the
charity of their choice through payroll
deduction plans.
