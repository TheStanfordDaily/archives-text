# 621 Yards Rushing
## Bruin Running Attack Overwhelms Cardinals 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
It didn't take anyone very long
to figure out the obvious Saturday
at Stanford Stadium.
Oh, a few fans may have sensed
an upset when the Cards received
the opening kickoff and drove
smoothly downfield to the UCLA
19. Maybe one of Stanford's
patented surprises was in the
offing. Maybe?
It took only two plays to jolt
Stanford's followers back to
reality. Rod Garcia missed a field
goal attempt and Kermit Johnson
scampered 51 yards on UCLA's
first play from scrimmage.
Suddenly everything was perfectly
clear — the Bruins were on their
way to a rout over Stanford's
outmanned Cardinals.
The final score, for those of
you who left the scene early, was
UCLA 59, Stanford 13.
"We expected a good football
team and they showed us one,"
Stanford coach Jack Christiansen
understated after the game. "In
order to stop the Wishbone you've
simply got to defeat their blockers
and tackle their ballcarriers. We
didn't do that today because we
weren't better than them."
Not Many Better
It's doubtful that too many
other teams are "better than
them." Never mind that national
television debacle in Lincoln, Neb.
— the Bruins have proved in the
last four weeks that they can pour
their Wishbone on just about
anybody in the nation.
Saturday UCLA rolled up 621
yards on the ground (90 yards
short of the NCAA record set by
Oklahoma two years ago),
recorded 27 first downs rushing
and gained 650 total yards — all
school records. The Bruins were
hardly dazzling (they completed
only two forward passes), but
overwhelmingly efficient.
Most of the damage was done
by UCLA's "Blair Pair," halfback
Kermit Johnson and fullback
James McAlister. McAlister left
the game with a sprained knee
midway in the second period (the
preliminary prognosis was that
he'll play next week), but he had
already rushed for 117 yards and
three touchdowns on just 14
carries.
Johnson also left the game
early, but not because of an
injury. Bruin coach Pepper
Rodgers decided to let his second
string runners play the final
quarter after Johnson's 168 yards
on 11 carries had propelled UCLA
to a 45-6 lead that even an old
fashioned "never-say-die" coach
would have to call
insurmountable.
First Score
All that scoring started when
Bruin kicker Efren Herrera
culminated a 70-yard, six-play
drive with a 27-yard field goal. On
UCLA's next possession, however,
Stanford stopped the Bruins cold.
The Card defense received an
appreciative ovation when it left
the field, but Stanford was never
able to contain the Bruins
thereafter. "They caught on to
what we were doing defensively
really early," said Card defensive
end Pat Donovan. "When we came
back in after that second series
they had our defense figured
out."
What happened was that
Stanford opened with a defense
that emphasized stopping the
sweep. UCLA then battered the
Cards inside, and when Stanford
finally changed its strategy, the
Bruins started to go outside.
"It's easy to adjust a Wishbone
offense to the kind of defense

you're playing," linebacker Forrie
Martin explained. "It was a lot
harder for us to adjust a defense
that we had worked on for three
weeks — when we tried to change
that quickly we kept
over-adjusting."
The result, of course, was
chaos. UCLA scored at will,
methodically moving the ball
upfield, taking, according to Bruin
coach Pepper Rodgers, "whatever
they were willing to give us."
Stanford, meanwhile, seemed to
have its kickoff return and
punting teams on the field more
than the offense.
"We just didn't make any
mistakes," Rodgers said
afterwards. "It's very difficult to
beat a Wishbone team that doesn't
commit any errors.
"I thought we played a good
game," Rodgers said.
"Great?" someone interjected.
"Well, let's say it was
somewhere between good and
great."
For Stanford, now 2-3 in a
hard to figure out season, it was
somewhere between bad and
awful.

Cardinal Notes: Not too many
fans were left in the stadium to
see it, but the Cards came up with
one thrilling offensive play with
1:36 remaining. Quarterback Dave
Ottmar lofted a high pass from
the UCLA 20 yard line and
Anthony Hill outrebounded a
Bruin defender for the
touchdown.
Rod Garcia ended Stanford's
second quarter scoring drought
with a 53-yard field goal with
only one second remaining in the
half. It was Stanford's first score
in 74:59 of second period action.
Basketball is supposed to be
tops at UCLA, but the Bruin
cagers scored eight points less
than the football team in their last
effort against Stanford. The
basketball Bruins defeated the
Cards 51-45 on March 3.
UCLA's Johnson earned
offensive player of the game
honors for his rushing efforts and
defensive tackle Gerry Roberts
was named defensive player of the
game. Roberts, who was third
string until this week, exemplified
Rodgers' philosophy that "one of
the most important things on a
football team is competition for a
position."

RARE FAILURE — Stanford's Drew Palin (64) grabs the upper half of UCLA halfback Wendell Tyler and
an unidentified Cardinal grabs the lower half during UCLA s victory over the Cards Saturday. The play
was a rare loss for the Bruin Wishbone and a rare highlight in an otherwise dismal Stanford performance.
