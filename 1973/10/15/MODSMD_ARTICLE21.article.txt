# Seeing Red
## Another Gene Washington? 
### Vlae Kershner 
Anthony Hill decided to switch from
quarterback to receiver when he came to Stanford,
and the 17-year-old freshman isn't regretting it.
Although many in the bored crowd of 55,000 at
Saturday's massacre weren't around to see it, Hill
made a leaping touchdown catch in the fourth
quarter, Stanford's lone highlight in an otherwise
dismal afternoon.
The important thing about Hill is that he'll
probably be the Cardinals' star receiver for the next
three-and-a-half seasons. He has the speed to beat
most defenders and the reactions needed to catch
passes which aren't perfectly thrown.
For example, on the TD reception Saturday, Hill
beat his man on a streak pattern and then reached
back to catch Dave Ottmar's underthrown pass.
The interesting thing about Hill is how he got
here. Last year, as a quarterback for Long Beach
Poly High School, Hill broke all passing records set
by Gene Washington, a former Stanford
quarterback-turned-end now starring with the San
Francisco 49ers.
As Hill tells it, Washington talked him into
coming to Stanford and becoming an end. "He told
me there's more future for a black person at end
than at quarterback," especially in professional
football.
The youthful-looking Hill, born on June 23,
1956, hasn't had any second thoughts about his
choices.
"Reggie [Ishman], who plays ahead of me, has
helped me a 10t... and Pete Kettela is a great
coach. The level of instruction here has really been
high," Hill says.
Next year, with Ishman gone, Hill is confident of
starting as a receiver, and also of becoming
Stanford's punt return specialist.
This year, he has returned three kickoffs, his long
gain being 38 yards against UCLA But, he says, "I'd
rather return punts, but we have a pretty good punt
return team right now," led by returner Craig
Zaltosky.
Zaltosky, like Ishman, is a senior, and thus it's
likely Stanford fans will become very familiar with
Number 47 through 1976.

Highlight of the weekend: Marty Glickfeld and
Phil Wright's soccer play against UCLA. Glickfeld
proved he deserves to wear Number 10 (Pele's
number, generally reserved for stars) with his
crowd-pleasing passing and ball control, while
Wright played good defense and scored the Cards'
lone goal.
With a little more offense, Stanford's soccer team
could be one of the best. Until Saturday, the same
could have been said of the Stanford football team.
Stanford's defense obviously wasn't set up to
beat an inside running game, and Kermit Johnson
and James McAlister ran right through Stanford's
"50" defense.
After the game, linebacker coach Ray Handley
admitted, "it was our fault as coaches that we had
three down linemen trying to take on their five
linemen plus one of their running backs ... our
people just couldn't do it."
Stanford eventually adjusted, keeping its
linebackers inside instead of having them follow the
flow of the triple-option, but by then it was too
late.
Even a perfect defense couldn't have stopped
UCLA. As Pepper Rodgers said, "We are a very good
Wishbone team and we didn't make any errors," a
generally unstoppable combination.
Another Rodgers quote which can't be disputed:
"Stanford said we just had an average offensive line,
but if our's is average, there's none better."

Parallel Structure: UCLA's pair from Blair High
School in Pasadena, Johnson and McAlister,
completely decimated Stanford's defense.
Stanford's own Blair pair, linebacker Forrie Martin
and middle guard Pete Hanson, didn't exactly stop
them.
Hanson said of UCLA, "They're the best team I
ever faced, much better than Michigan. They're
faster and their line's bigger.
"I talked to both of them [McAlister and
Johnson] after the game and wished them luck. If
we can't win it [the league title], I hope they do."
Martin said of his former teammates, "They're
great athletes, I always thought so."

could be one of the best. Until Saturday, the same
could have been said of the Stanford football team.
Stanford's defense obviously wasn't set up to
beat an inside running game, and Kermit Johnson
and James McAlister ran right through Stanford's
"50" defense.
After the game, linebacker coach Ray Handley
admitted, "it was our fault as coaches that we had
three down linemen trying to take on their five
linemen plus one of their running backs ... our
people just couldn't do it."
Stanford eventually adjusted, keeping its
linebackers inside instead of having them follow the
flow of the triple-option, but by then it was too
late.
Even a perfect defense couldn't have stopped
UCLA. As Pepper Rodgers said, "We are a very good
Wishbone team and we didn't make any errors," a
generally unstoppable combination.
Another Rodgers quote which can't be disputed:
"Stanford said we just had an average offensive line,
but if our's is average, there's none better."

Parallel Structure: UCLA's pair from Blair High
School in Pasadena, Johnson and McAlister,
completely decimated Stanford's defense.
Stanford's own Blair pair, linebacker Forrie Martin
and middle guard Pete Hanson, didn't exactly stop
them.
Hanson said of UCLA, "They're the best team I
ever faced, much better than Michigan. They're
faster and their line's bigger.
"I talked to both of them [McAlister and
Johnson] after the game and wished them luck. If
we can't win it [the league title], I hope they do."
Martin said of his former teammates, "They're
great athletes, I always thought so."
Anthony Hill decided to switch from
quarterback to receiver when he came to Stanford,
and the 17-year-old freshman isn't regretting it.
Although many in the bored crowd of 55,000 at
Saturday's massacre weren't around to see it, Hill
made a leaping touchdown catch in the fourth
quarter, Stanford's lone highlight in an otherwise
dismal afternoon.
The important thing about Hill is that he'll
probably be the Cardinals' star receiver for the next
three-and-a-half seasons. He has the speed to beat
most defenders and the reactions needed to catch
passes which aren't perfectly thrown.
For example, on the TD reception Saturday, Hill
beat his man on a streak pattern and then reached
back to catch Dave Ottmar's underthrown pass.
The interesting thing about Hill is how he got
here. Last year, as a quarterback for Long Beach
Poly High School, Hill broke all passing records set
by Gene Washington, a former Stanford
quarterback-turned-end now starring with the San
Francisco 49ers.
As Hill tells it, Washington talked him into
coming to Stanford and becoming an end. "He told
me there's more future for a black person at end
than at quarterback," especially in professional
football.
The youthful-looking Hill, born on June 23,
1956, hasn't had any second thoughts about his
choices.
"Reggie [Ishman], who plays ahead of me, has
helped me a 10t... and Pete Kettela is a great
coach. The level of instruction here has really been
high," Hill says.
Next year, with Ishman gone, Hill is confident of
starting as a receiver, and also of becoming
Stanford's punt return specialist.
This year, he has returned three kickoffs, his long
gain being 38 yards against UCLA But, he says, "I'd
rather return punts, but we have a pretty good punt
return team right now," led by returner Craig
Zaltosky.
Zaltosky, like Ishman, is a senior, and thus it's
likely Stanford fans will become very familiar with
Number 47 through 1976.

Highlight of the weekend: Marty Glickfeld and
Phil Wright's soccer play against UCLA. Glickfeld
proved he deserves to wear Number 10 (Pele's
number, generally reserved for stars) with his
crowd-pleasing passing and ball control, while
Wright played good defense and scored the Cards'
lone goal.
With a little more offense, Stanford's soccer team
could be one of the best. Until Saturday, the same
