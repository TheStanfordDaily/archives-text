## Trojans Squeak Past Stubborn Cougars 
### 
While there wasn't much
excitement in Stanford Stadium
Saturday — except for masochists
— the Coliseum in Los Angeles
was a pretty noisy place.
USC finally overcame
Washington State, 46-35, but it
took four touchdown passes by
Pat Haden before the Trojans
could pull away.
Haden hit 15 of 24 for 245
yards to stave off the upset.
Anthony Davis ran 14 yards for
the come-from-behind touchdown
in the third period.
The Trojans, now 4-0-1 and
ranked fourth in the nation,
extended their unbeaten streak to
22 games.
Meanwhile, California's
on-again, off-again offense went
off again as the Golden Bears
absorbed a 41-10 mauling by
Oregon.
Actually, Cal rolled up 487
yards in total offense, but
couldn't move the ball into the
end zone. Oregon's problem was
just the opposite: they couldn't
keep the ball out of the end zone.
A Cal secondary with huge
holes in it gave Duck quarterbacks

plenty of opportunity to throw,
and they did: for 224 yards and
three touchdowns. Berkeley's air
war didn't go anyplace, though, as
Oregon picked off four passes.
In Seattle, Oregon State and
Washington turned over the ball
15 times on fumbles and pass
interceptions. Washington won
the turnover battle, 9-6, but
Oregon State took the game, 31-7,
on the strength of a deadly
rushing game that rolled up 236
yards.
