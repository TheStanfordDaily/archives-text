## Bruins Hit Hardest 
### Stan Wilson 
"Stanford hit harder than any team we've played yet," said UCLA
quarterback John Sciarra Saturday afternoon in the Bruin locker
room, as a jubilant UCLA team celebrated its whitewash over
Stanford.
Maybe the Cards hit harder, but they must've been hitting the
wrong people, as Stanford suffered its worst defeat since 1954 when
the Bruins trounced them 72-0. Perhaps Stanford Coach Jack
Christiansen's analysis was a bit more appropriate. "In order to defeat
the Wishbone you have to defeat the blocker and make the tackle in
the open field. But we didn't do that... we didn't tackle well."
Before the afternoon was over 55,000 disbelieving fans had seen 10
Bruin runners wishbone their way around and through a confused
Stanford defense for a school record 621 yards, including 168 yards
by Offensive Player of the Game Kermit Johnson, who averaged over
15 yards every time he touched the pigskin.
Early in the game the Cards tried futilely to shut off Johnson and
the Bruins' wide attack, but UCLA exploited the resulting weaknesses
with counters to fullback James McAlister, who gained 117 yards and
scored three touchdowns before leaving the game in the second
quarter with a sprained knee.

"We went inside in our ground
game because that's what
Stanford gave us," said UCLA
coach Pepper Rodgers.
Sciarra concurred. "Their
linebackers were flowing outside,"
analyzed the sophomore
signal-caller. Now that Rodgers
has moved McAlister to a fullback
position, the Bruins have a "real
tough fullback game this year," he
said.
Much of the success of the
Bruins' rushing attack must go to
their underrated offensive line.
"The line blew their defense out,"
Sciarra said. "The offensive line
hasn't gotten enough credit."
Steve Klosterman, an offensive
guard and one of those linemen
responsible for "busting Kermit
open," explained the Bruins
conspicuous enthusiasm, which in
part was responsible for UCLA's
success. "Next to USC, Stanford's
the biggest rival for me. We were
really up for this game.
"We're a better offense this
year, and our defense really
surprised the public. We're
thinking about SC, and we're
hungry for the Rose Bowl."
Sciarra, who split playing time
with incumbent quarterback Mark
Harmon, is another Bruin who is
viewing the season through
Rose-colored glasses. "To me it
makes no difference who starts,"
he said. "I'm just trying to help us
get to the Rose Bowl. When
Mark's in there I'm rooting for
him — I hope he's doing the same
fo; me."
Apparently he is, but Harmon's
enthusiasm is perhaps a bit more
restrained. "It's the coach's
decision" to shuffle the
quarterbacks, said Harmon. Does
it interfere with the teams
offensive continuity? "If it does,
it's not noticeable," Harmon
answered, pointing to the Bruins'
59-point total against the Cards.
Both quarterbacks would like
to throw more, but the Bruins'
anemic air attack is more than
compensated for by their
awesome ground game. "I like to
throw the ball but why take
chances?" said Sciarra. "When
you rush for over 600 yards you
can't complain."
"The passing is there this year
— we've got it if we need it,"
Harmon pointed out. "We're a
stronger team this year and our
offense and defense are working
together real well."
UCLA has now won four
one-sidod contests since being
overwhelmed by Nebraska 40-13
in the season opener. "Nebraska
embarrassed us," explained
Klosterman. If embarrassment is
as inspiring for Stanford as it has
been for the Bruins, the Cards
should have little trouble winning
the rest of their games.

Before the afternoon was over 55,000 disbelieving fans had seen 10
Bruin runners wishbone their way around and through a confused
Stanford defense for a school record 621 yards, including 168 yards
by Offensive Player of the Game Kermit Johnson, who averaged over
15 yards every time he touched the pigskin.
Early in the game the Cards tried futilely to shut off Johnson and
the Bruins' wide attack, but UCLA exploited the resulting weaknesses
with counters to fullback James McAlister, who gained 117 yards and
scored three touchdowns before leaving the game in the second
quarter with a sprained knee.

"We went inside in our ground
game because that's what
Stanford gave us," said UCLA
coach Pepper Rodgers.
Sciarra concurred. "Their
linebackers were flowing outside,"
analyzed the sophomore
signal-caller. Now that Rodgers
has moved McAlister to a fullback
position, the Bruins have a "real
tough fullback game this year," he
said.
Much of the success of the
Bruins' rushing attack must go to
their underrated offensive line.
"The line blew their defense out,"
Sciarra said. "The offensive line
hasn't gotten enough credit."
Steve Klosterman, an offensive
guard and one of those linemen
responsible for "busting Kermit
open," explained the Bruins
conspicuous enthusiasm, which in
part was responsible for UCLA's
success. "Next to USC, Stanford's
the biggest rival for me. We were
really up for this game.
"We're a better offense this
year, and our defense really
surprised the public. We're
thinking about SC, and we're
hungry for the Rose Bowl."
Sciarra, who split playing time
with incumbent quarterback Mark
Harmon, is another Bruin who is
viewing the season through
Rose-colored glasses. "To me it
makes no difference who starts,"
he said. "I'm just trying to help us
get to the Rose Bowl. When
Mark's in there I'm rooting for
him — I hope he's doing the same
fo; me."
Apparently he is, but Harmon's
enthusiasm is perhaps a bit more
restrained. "It's the coach's
decision" to shuffle the
quarterbacks, said Harmon. Does
it interfere with the teams
offensive continuity? "If it does,
it's not noticeable," Harmon
answered, pointing to the Bruins'
59-point total against the Cards.
Both quarterbacks would like
to throw more, but the Bruins'
anemic air attack is more than
compensated for by their
awesome ground game. "I like to
throw the ball but why take
chances?" said Sciarra. "When
you rush for over 600 yards you
can't complain."
"The passing is there this year
— we've got it if we need it,"
Harmon pointed out. "We're a
stronger team this year and our
offense and defense are working
together real well."
UCLA has now won four
one-sidod contests since being
overwhelmed by Nebraska 40-13
in the season opener. "Nebraska
embarrassed us," explained
Klosterman. If embarrassment is
as inspiring for Stanford as it has
been for the Bruins, the Cards
should have little trouble winning
the rest of their games.
"Stanford hit harder than any team we've played yet," said UCLA
quarterback John Sciarra Saturday afternoon in the Bruin locker
room, as a jubilant UCLA team celebrated its whitewash over
Stanford.
Maybe the Cards hit harder, but they must've been hitting the
wrong people, as Stanford suffered its worst defeat since 1954 when
the Bruins trounced them 72-0. Perhaps Stanford Coach Jack
Christiansen's analysis was a bit more appropriate. "In order to defeat
the Wishbone you have to defeat the blocker and make the tackle in
the open field. But we didn't do that... we didn't tackle well."
