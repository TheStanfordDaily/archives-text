# Brubabes Top Cards, 24—13
## Opportunistic Wishbone Jolts JV 
### TIM FERGUSON 
UCLA's Wishbone opened up
when opportunity knocked
Friday to win a game dominated
by Mike Cordova's passing as the
Bruin JV handed the Stanford
junior varsity a 24-13 setback in
its opener at Stanford Stadium.
Cordova, a freshman dropping
down temporarily from the
varsity, completed 14 of 36 passes
for an amazing 280 yards to lead a
Stanford offense which moved
with ease all afternoon but was
stopped repeatedly while
attempting to score.
UCLA's total offense for the
game fell far short of that of the
Cardinals (279-434 yards), but the
Bruins were able to capitalize on
four of five scoring chances while
Stanford seized only two of seven.
"We should've won," Cardinal
coach Gunther Cunningham said
afterward, and he pinpointed
turnovers as the cause of his
team's downfall. Cordova was
intercepted three times and tossed
an errant pitch on his own 11, the
recovery of which led to UCLA's
first touchdown two plays later.
No Turnovers
The Bruins' Wishbone offense,
although sputtering to meager
totals, did not commit a turnover.
Also a major part of the Bruin
victory was the punting of Steven

Bianchi. He averaged 46.3 yards
on seven boots (compared to
Cardinal Tom Lynn's 33.7 in
three attempts), and put Stanford
deep in its own territory at the
start of every drive.
Cordova, however, marched
the Cards 87 and 82 yards to their
two scores, the second of which,
together with Chip Underwood's
kick, put Stanford ahead 13-12
late in the third quarter.
Cunningham described
Cordova's performance as
"super," and UCLA middle
linebacker Richard Dischner said
of the fabulous freshman, "That
guy's the greatest we've seen."
Cordova saved 196 of his
passing yards for the second half
as Cunningham chose the first
moiety to display a surprise
option offense which proved only
mildly successful.
"I was afraid to throw in the
first half," said Cunningham. "I
was worried about the protection.
He's [Cordova] too good of a kid
to get the shit kicked out of him."
Called Plays
The coach turned Cordova
loose in the second half, and said
the quarterback even called all the
plays in Stanford's next-to-last
drive, a 71-yard advance which
ended with Cordova being
intercepted in the end zone.

JV Summary
UCLA 6 6 0 12 — 24
Stanford 0 6 7 0— 13
UCLA — Bartholomew 1 run (PAT
snap fumbled)
UCLA — Deans 13 pass from
Acosta (kick blocked)
Stan — Bruzzone 62 pass from
Cordova (kick failed)
Stan — Jenke 26 pass from
Cordova (Underwood
kick)
UCLA — Counter 33 pass from
□elaney (pass failed)
UCLA — Rollins 29 run (pass
failed)

But Cordova's passing heroics
were not enough to overcome
UCLA's opportunistic Wishbone.
The Bruins got their first score
near the end of the first quarter
by punching 11 yards in two plays
after a Stanford fumble.
UCLA scored again midway
through the second quarter as
quarterback Bob Acosta, from
Western High of Anaheim and
along with Cordova a Parade
Magazine high school
All-American, hit tight end James
Deans for a 13-yard score.
Stanford rebounded just prior
to intermission as Cordova found
Dave Bruzzone in the right corner

for a 62-yard touchdown bomb.
Underwood's kick was deflected
wide, and the Cards trailed, 12-6,
at the break.
Stanford's defense tightened in
the third quarter, allowing the
Cardinals to take the lead after
Cordova hit flanker Jim Jenke, his
favorite receiver for the day
(seven receptions for 135 yards),
for a 26-yard tally. Underwood
boomed through the go-ahead
point.
The lead lasted only
four-and-one-half minutes. New
UCLA quarterback Bill Delaney
finally got the Bruin option
working, and capped an 11-play
drive by hitting Michael Coulter,
33 yards away in the corner of the
Stanford end zone.
Downhill Course
From that point, the game's
course was downhill for the
Cardinals, who managed only
three late aerial rallies. UCLA
scored once more, when Edwill
Rollins bolted 29 yards
untouched through the center of
the Stanford line.
Cunningham praised his
defense after the game, saying
"They all played well." He said he
was "really impressed" with
linebacker John Olenchalk, who
played both ways after offensive
guard Kent Lightfoot was hurt
early in the second half.
Cunningham said Friday that
the injury Lightfoot sustained to
his right knee "could be really
bad."
The solemnity of the Cardinal
locker room afterward was one of
determination, not despair.
Cunningham was genuinely
pleased with his team's showing,
saying "to almost beat UCLA"
was a "case in point" of the effect
of "enthusiasm" on the gridiron.
"If we'd [coaches] done a
better ; job of preparation, we'd
have won," said Cunningham.
"But we're young coaches."
He did go on to credit his staff
of Ron Hancock, Don Frease,
Steve Murray and Dennis
Peterson. 'The only reason we did
as well as we did was because of
the great job they did. All I do is
yell at them."

WHO'S GOT THE BALL — Stanford's Johnny Murao and an unidentified UCLA player run on opposite
sides of the ball during Saturday's game. UCLA, the second ranked team on the West Coast, defeated the
Cardinals, 2-1.
UCLA's Wishbone opened up
when opportunity knocked
Friday to win a game dominated
by Mike Cordova's passing as the
Bruin JV handed the Stanford
junior varsity a 24-13 setback in
its opener at Stanford Stadium.
Cordova, a freshman dropping
down temporarily from the
varsity, completed 14 of 36 passes
for an amazing 280 yards to lead a
Stanford offense which moved
with ease all afternoon but was
stopped repeatedly while
attempting to score.
UCLA's total offense for the
game fell far short of that of the
Cardinals (279-434 yards), but the
Bruins were able to capitalize on
four of five scoring chances while
Stanford seized only two of seven.
"We should've won," Cardinal
coach Gunther Cunningham said
afterward, and he pinpointed
turnovers as the cause of his
team's downfall. Cordova was
intercepted three times and tossed
an errant pitch on his own 11, the
recovery of which led to UCLA's
first touchdown two plays later.
No Turnovers
The Bruins' Wishbone offense,
although sputtering to meager
totals, did not commit a turnover.
Also a major part of the Bruin
victory was the punting of Steven

Bianchi. He averaged 46.3 yards
on seven boots (compared to
Cardinal Tom Lynn's 33.7 in
three attempts), and put Stanford
deep in its own territory at the
start of every drive.
Cordova, however, marched
the Cards 87 and 82 yards to their
two scores, the second of which,
together with Chip Underwood's
kick, put Stanford ahead 13-12
late in the third quarter.
Cunningham described
Cordova's performance as
"super," and UCLA middle
linebacker Richard Dischner said
of the fabulous freshman, "That
guy's the greatest we've seen."
Cordova saved 196 of his
passing yards for the second half
as Cunningham chose the first
moiety to display a surprise
option offense which proved only
mildly successful.
"I was afraid to throw in the
first half," said Cunningham. "I
was worried about the protection.
He's [Cordova] too good of a kid
to get the shit kicked out of him."
Called Plays
The coach turned Cordova
loose in the second half, and said
the quarterback even called all the
plays in Stanford's next-to-last
drive, a 71-yard advance which
ended with Cordova being
intercepted in the end zone.

JV Summary
UCLA 6 6 0 12 — 24
Stanford 0 6 7 0— 13
UCLA — Bartholomew 1 run (PAT
snap fumbled)
UCLA — Deans 13 pass from
Acosta (kick blocked)
Stan — Bruzzone 62 pass from
Cordova (kick failed)
Stan — Jenke 26 pass from
Cordova (Underwood
kick)
UCLA — Counter 33 pass from
□elaney (pass failed)
UCLA — Rollins 29 run (pass
failed)

But Cordova's passing heroics
were not enough to overcome
UCLA's opportunistic Wishbone.
The Bruins got their first score
near the end of the first quarter
by punching 11 yards in two plays
after a Stanford fumble.
UCLA scored again midway
through the second quarter as
quarterback Bob Acosta, from
Western High of Anaheim and
along with Cordova a Parade
Magazine high school
All-American, hit tight end James
Deans for a 13-yard score.
Stanford rebounded just prior
to intermission as Cordova found
Dave Bruzzone in the right corner

for a 62-yard touchdown bomb.
Underwood's kick was deflected
wide, and the Cards trailed, 12-6,
at the break.
Stanford's defense tightened in
the third quarter, allowing the
Cardinals to take the lead after
Cordova hit flanker Jim Jenke, his
favorite receiver for the day
(seven receptions for 135 yards),
for a 26-yard tally. Underwood
boomed through the go-ahead
point.
The lead lasted only
four-and-one-half minutes. New
UCLA quarterback Bill Delaney
finally got the Bruin option
working, and capped an 11-play
drive by hitting Michael Coulter,
33 yards away in the corner of the
Stanford end zone.
Downhill Course
From that point, the game's
course was downhill for the
Cardinals, who managed only
three late aerial rallies. UCLA
scored once more, when Edwill
Rollins bolted 29 yards
untouched through the center of
the Stanford line.
Cunningham praised his
defense after the game, saying
"They all played well." He said he
was "really impressed" with
linebacker John Olenchalk, who
played both ways after offensive
guard Kent Lightfoot was hurt
early in the second half.
Cunningham said Friday that
the injury Lightfoot sustained to
his right knee "could be really
bad."
The solemnity of the Cardinal
locker room afterward was one of
determination, not despair.
Cunningham was genuinely
pleased with his team's showing,
saying "to almost beat UCLA"
was a "case in point" of the effect
of "enthusiasm" on the gridiron.
"If we'd [coaches] done a
better ; job of preparation, we'd
have won," said Cunningham.
"But we're young coaches."

finally got the Bruin option
working, and capped an 11-play

From that point, the game's
course was downhill for the
Cardinals, who managed only
three late aerial rallies. UCLA
scored once more, when Edwill
Rollins bolted 29 yards
untouched through the center of
the Stanford line.
Cunningham praised his
defense after the game, saying
"They all played well." He said he
was "really impressed" with
linebacker John Olenchalk, who
played both ways after offensive
guard Kent Lightfoot was hurt
early in the second half.
Cunningham said Friday that
the injury Lightfoot sustained to
his right knee "could be really
bad."
The solemnity of the Cardinal
locker room afterward was one of
determination, not despair.
Cunningham was genuinely
pleased with his team's showing,
saying "to almost beat UCLA"
was a "case in point" of the effect
of "enthusiasm" on the gridiron.
"If we'd [coaches] done a
better ; job of preparation, we'd
have won," said Cunningham.
"But we're young coaches."
He did go on to credit his staff
of Ron Hancock, Don Frease,
Steve Murray and Dennis
Peterson. 'The only reason we did
as well as we did was because of
the great job they did. All I do is
yell at them."

WHO'S GOT THE BALL — Stanford's Johnny Murao and an unidentified UCLA player run on opposite
sides of the ball during Saturday's game. UCLA, the second ranked team on the West Coast, defeated the
Cardinals, 2-1.
UCLA's Wishbone opened up
when opportunity knocked
Friday to win a game dominated
by Mike Cordova's passing as the
Bruin JV handed the Stanford
junior varsity a 24-13 setback in
its opener at Stanford Stadium.
Cordova, a freshman dropping
down temporarily from the
varsity, completed 14 of 36 passes
for an amazing 280 yards to lead a
Stanford offense which moved
with ease all afternoon but was
stopped repeatedly while
attempting to score.
UCLA's total offense for the
game fell far short of that of the
Cardinals (279-434 yards), but the
Bruins were able to capitalize on
four of five scoring chances while
Stanford seized only two of seven.
"We should've won," Cardinal
coach Gunther Cunningham said
afterward, and he pinpointed
turnovers as the cause of his
team's downfall. Cordova was
intercepted three times and tossed
an errant pitch on his own 11, the
recovery of which led to UCLA's
first touchdown two plays later.
No Turnovers
The Bruins' Wishbone offense,
although sputtering to meager
totals, did not commit a turnover.
Also a major part of the Bruin
victory was the punting of Steven

Bianchi. He averaged 46.3 yards
on seven boots (compared to
Cardinal Tom Lynn's 33.7 in
three attempts), and put Stanford
deep in its own territory at the
start of every drive.
Cordova, however, marched
the Cards 87 and 82 yards to their
two scores, the second of which,
together with Chip Underwood's
kick, put Stanford ahead 13-12
late in the third quarter.
Cunningham described
Cordova's performance as
"super," and UCLA middle
linebacker Richard Dischner said
of the fabulous freshman, "That
guy's the greatest we've seen."
Cordova saved 196 of his
passing yards for the second half
as Cunningham chose the first
moiety to display a surprise
option offense which proved only
mildly successful.
"I was afraid to throw in the
first half," said Cunningham. "I
was worried about the protection.
He's [Cordova] too good of a kid
to get the shit kicked out of him."
Called Plays
The coach turned Cordova
loose in the second half, and said
the quarterback even called all the
plays in Stanford's next-to-last
drive, a 71-yard advance which
ended with Cordova being
intercepted in the end zone.

JV Summary
UCLA 6 6 0 12 — 24
Stanford 0 6 7 0— 13
UCLA — Bartholomew 1 run (PAT
snap fumbled)
UCLA — Deans 13 pass from

Cordova (kick failed)
Stan — Jenke 26 pass from

kick)
UCLA — Counter 33 pass from

UCLA — Rollins 29 run (pass

But Cordova's passing heroics
were not enough to overcome
UCLA's opportunistic Wishbone.
The Bruins got their first score
near the end of the first quarter
by punching 11 yards in two plays
after a Stanford fumble.
UCLA scored again midway
through the second quarter as
quarterback Bob Acosta, from
Western High of Anaheim and
along with Cordova a Parade
Magazine high school
All-American, hit tight end James
Deans for a 13-yard score.
Stanford rebounded just prior
to intermission as Cordova found
Dave Bruzzone in the right corner

for a 62-yard touchdown bomb.
Underwood's kick was deflected
wide, and the Cards trailed, 12-6,
at the break.
Stanford's defense tightened in
the third quarter, allowing the
Cardinals to take the lead after
Cordova hit flanker Jim Jenke, his
favorite receiver for the day
(seven receptions for 135 yards),
for a 26-yard tally. Underwood
boomed through the go-ahead
