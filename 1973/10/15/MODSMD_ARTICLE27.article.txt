# Cards Open Cage Drills
## 
### 
The opening game is still six
weeks away, but Stanford's
1973-74 basketball team will
swing into action this afternoon as
head coach Howie Dallmar and
assistants Bub Bowling and Billy
Jones welcome 18 candidates to
the first official practice of the
season.
The Cards, whose 14-11 record
last year represented Stanford's
first winning basketball season
since 1967, have nine veterans
returning from last year's club.
All-League center Rich Kelley
heads an impressive list of
returnees that also includes Mike
Mann, Tim Patterson, Mark
Gilberg, Mel Arterberry, Dave
Frost, Scott Trobbe, Jim
Montague and Archie Dean.
The Card roster will be further
bolstered by the addition of Ed
Schweitzer, the leading scorer on
last year's junior varsity team, and
redshirts Mike Simons and Ben
Bluitt.
Mann, who underwent knee
surgery just three weeks ago, says
he'll be on the floor shooting, if
not running, this afternoon. The
6-9 forward-center is a two-year
starter.
This season marks Dallmar's
20th year as Stanford's head
coach. Dallmar, who played on
Stanford's 1942 NCAA
champions, ranks among the
nation's winningest coaches with a
career record of 335-287.
