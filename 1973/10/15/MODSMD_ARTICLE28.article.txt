# Early Lead Decisive
## UCLA Trips Cardinal Poloists 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Defending national champion UCLA
suffered its second loss of the season Friday
against California, but bounced back on
Saturday to defeat Stanford, 7-4, in a water
polo match at Foothill College.
The Bruins, with Garth Bergeson and Kurt
Krumpolz leading the scoring, jumped off to a
3-0 first period advantage. But the Cards
responded with goals by Dean Anderson and
Rick Gebers to make the count 3-2. Bergeson
added a score in the second period, and
Stanford trailed at the half, 4-2.
After the intermission the Bruins added
three goals with Bergeson, Krumpolz and
Hestor each contributing a score. Goals by
Stanford's John-Paul Roberts and Anderson
couldn't offset the Bruins' advantage, as the
Cards dropped the contest, 7-4.
"We had planned on stopping Bergeson by
either sloughing on him or fouling him," said
Stanford coach Jim Gaughran. "We weren't
successful with this and he scored four goals.

"We were successful in stopping all of their
extra-man scoring attempts, but the fact that
we couldn't stop Bergeson hurt our game
plan," Gaughran added.
The Cards turned in a creditable
performance in the second half, according to
Gaughran. "If we hadn't let the Bruins get
such an early lead, we might have been able to
play them on even terms," he said.
"We have to learn to drive the goal harder
and with more consistency." The Cards had
no particular standouts, and Gaughran noted
that "we had the opportunity to slough on
Bergeson but didn't."
On Friday the Cards defeated Cal Poly 9-7
in "one of the dirtiest games I've ever seen,"
according to one Cal Poly player. The two
teams were whistled for 52 fouls in the
contest.
Gebers paced Stanford with five goals in
the game. Roberts, Drew McDonald, Peter
Snyder and Anderson rounded out the Cards'
scoring.

In a game with no bearing on the Pac-8
race the Stanford Cardinals defeated the
Stanford Indians, an alumni team, 11-8
yesterday afternoon.
The junior varsity defeated San Jose City
College 9-4 on Saturday.
How did the weekend affect the Cardinals'
chances for a berth in the NCAA tournament?
"We still have to play UCLA again," explained
Gaughran, "and we could improve and beat
'em next time. We also still have the
possibility of getting an at-large berth in the
tournament."
California, the nation's top-ranked team
and the current Pac-8 leader, will be
Stanford's next opponent when the Cards
travel to Harmon pool in Berkeley on Friday.
The Bears have already defeated Stanford
twice this season, routing the Cards 11-1 in
the finals of the California Invitational and
handing Stanford an 11-7 semifinal setback in
the Northern California Open.

polo match at Foothill College.
The Bruins, with Garth Bergeson and Kurt
Krumpolz leading the scoring, jumped off to a
3-0 first period advantage. But the Cards
responded with goals by Dean Anderson and
Rick Gebers to make the count 3-2. Bergeson
added a score in the second period, and
Stanford trailed at the half, 4-2.
After the intermission the Bruins added
three goals with Bergeson, Krumpolz and
Hestor each contributing a score. Goals by
Stanford's John-Paul Roberts and Anderson
couldn't offset the Bruins' advantage, as the
Cards dropped the contest, 7-4.
"We had planned on stopping Bergeson by
either sloughing on him or fouling him," said
Stanford coach Jim Gaughran. "We weren't
successful with this and he scored four goals.

"We were successful in stopping all of their
extra-man scoring attempts, but the fact that
we couldn't stop Bergeson hurt our game
plan," Gaughran added.
The Cards turned in a creditable
performance in the second half, according to
Gaughran. "If we hadn't let the Bruins get
such an early lead, we might have been able to
play them on even terms," he said.
"We have to learn to drive the goal harder
and with more consistency." The Cards had
no particular standouts, and Gaughran noted
that "we had the opportunity to slough on
Bergeson but didn't."
On Friday the Cards defeated Cal Poly 9-7
in "one of the dirtiest games I've ever seen,"
according to one Cal Poly player. The two
teams were whistled for 52 fouls in the
contest.
Gebers paced Stanford with five goals in
the game. Roberts, Drew McDonald, Peter
Snyder and Anderson rounded out the Cards'
scoring.

In a game with no bearing on the Pac-8
race the Stanford Cardinals defeated the
Stanford Indians, an alumni team, 11-8

The junior varsity defeated San Jose City
College 9-4 on Saturday.
How did the weekend affect the Cardinals'
chances for a berth in the NCAA tournament?
"We still have to play UCLA again," explained
Gaughran, "and we could improve and beat
'em next time. We also still have the
possibility of getting an at-large berth in the
tournament."
California, the nation's top-ranked team
and the current Pac-8 leader, will be
Stanford's next opponent when the Cards
