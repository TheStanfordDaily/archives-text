# Bruin Booters Edge Cards Despite Solid Stanford Effort
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Stanford's soccer team turned
in an impressive performance
Saturday, but the Cards couldn't
match UCLA's passing and ball
handling, as the Bruins squeaked
out a 2-1 victory before a
larger-than-normal crowd at Harry
Maloney Field.
Stanford was ranked 10th on
the West Coast before the game,
while the Bruins held down the
second spot.
UCLA kicked off and took the
initiative immediately, but a stout
defense and an offside call turned
back their early efforts. The
Bruins got a break when one of
their players was fouled near the
goal. He was awarded a
one-on-one shot against Goalie
Walt Harris, and drilled it into the
corner of the net for a 1-0 lead.
The score remained 1-0 for
most of the game, but although
goals were infrequent, the action

was not. Harris made some good
saves, but it was the defense's play
deep in Stanford territory which
made his job a lot easier.
The Bruins moved the ball
quite well, but couldn't maneuver
for many close range shots.
Stanford had a few scoring
opportunities late in the first half
and early in the second, but
UCLA's defense forced rushed
shots. The Cards almost got a
break when a shot by Brian
Bershader got past the Bruin
goalie, but it rolled wide of the
net.
Traded Spurts
The teams traded offensive
spurts in the second half, but both
goalies rose to the occasion, until,
with less than ten minutes in the
game, a UCLA shot rebounded off
the goalpost in front of the net,
where a Bruin knocked it in for a
2-0 lead.
Stanford, desperate with time
running out, moved the ball
downfield, and Phil Wright
knocked in a free kick, past a wall
of UCLA players and a
disbelieving Bruin goalie.
It was Wright's third score of
the season, but it was not enough,
as the Bruins held off one final
Cardinal surge for a 2-1 victory.
The teams played contrasting
styles of offense. UCLA played
ball-control, using precision
passing and expert dribbling to
move the ball from one end of the

field to the other. They seemed to
favor starting the ball up the
center of the field, then hitting
the open man on either side.
Long Passes
Stanford used more long
passes, getting the ball out of their
territory, but often into the
Bruins' possession. These passes
almost paid off, as Johnny Murao
twice had half a step on the Bruin
defender, but couldn't beat both
him and UCLA's goalie at the
same time. The Cards seemed to
favor bringing the ball down on
the left side to set the offense.
At one point, with UCLA
leading 1-0 in the second half,
Stanford's long passes provoked
Wright to yell, "On the ground
red. We've got to start a control
game."
Wright was definitely the
standout for the Cards. Besides his
goal, he played great defense,
outjumping the Bruins to head the
ball away from the goal numerous
times.
Harris also played well, twice
coming out of goal on a Bruin
corner kick and two-fisting the
ball away from the waiting UCLA
attackers.
Despite winning, the closeness
of the score may have hurt
UCLA's chances of getting to the
NCAA playoffs. The Bruins tied
University of San Francisco 3-3
Thursday, but USF beat the Cards
7-0 early in the season.
