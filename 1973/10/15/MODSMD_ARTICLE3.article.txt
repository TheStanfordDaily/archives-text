# Egyptians Attack In Sinai; Israelis Near Damascus
## 
### Associated Press 
Egyptian tanks launched a broad
day-long attack on Israel's Sinai forces
yesterday and Israeli tanks pushing
toward Damascus were reported
slowed by heavy Syrian artillery fire.
The Cairo military command said
its armored columns seized new areas
of land in the occupied Sinai peninsula
in savage desert fighting. But the
Israeli command said the assault was
beaten back to a line three or four
miles from the Suez Canal and the
Egyptians lost more than 200 tanks.
The command in Tel Aviv said that
656 Israeli soldiers were killed in the
first eight days of Middle East fighting,
including the commander of Israeli
tank forces in the Sinai. The new
conflict, the fourth Arab-Israeli war
since 1948, broke out Oct. 6.
In Tel Aviv, the state radio said
about 2000 Israeli soldiers, wounded
on the Syrian and Egyptian fronts,
were hospitalized.
Some diplomatic sources in Cairo
viewed the new Egyptian offensive in
the Sinai as an attempt to divert Israeli
energy from the hard-pressed Arab
forces in Syria.
Tanks Approach Damascus
The Israeli tanks punching into
Syria moved up to the town of Sasa
about 21 miles southwest of Damascus
and the Tel Aviv command said its
advance artillery was shelling the
suburbs of the Syrian capital.
Officers told newsmen some
spearhead units had probed to within
16 miles of Damascus on Saturday.
But Associated Press photographer
Spartaco podini said the main Israeli
column trying to seize control of Sasa
ran into tough resistance from Syrian
snipers.
AP special correspondent Hugh A.
Mulligan said the advance also was
slowed by the Syrian shelling.
Israelis Slowed
"Keeping the Israeli spearhead

going is difficult because of murderous
Syrian artillery fire," Mulligan said
from the Syrian front. "The Israelis
are not having much success in
knocking out these long-range Soviet
guns firing from the front and the
flanks."
Residents of the Syrian capital said
in telephone calls to Beirut, Lebanon,
that they heard no explosions near the
city. A Syrian government newspaper
published a special edition to deny the
Israeli shelling claims.
There was no word of effective aid
from Jordan, which announced its
entry into the war Saturday. But a
spokesman in Damascus reported the
Syrian lines were bolstered by Iraqis
and Moroccans and called the defenses
"good and strong."
Communiques from Damascus said

Israeli jets were attacking air fields in
Syria and claimed shooting down
several of them. The Egyptian military
command claimed 24 Israeli warplanes
were shot down in dogfights swirling
over the Sinai tank battles.
Cairo claimed its armor struck out
against the Israeli defenders at dawn
and recaptured more of the occupied
peninsula behind Egyptian warplanes
bombing Israeli positions all along the
front.
"Fighting is still raging with heavy
violence and savagery all along the
front inside Sinai between our
armored and mechanized forces
advancing east and the enemy forces
trying to stop them," an Egyptian
communique said.
Tel Aviv claimed its jets and tanks
Kaplan said. "But it cannot be
selective ... it [cannot be] a sword as
well as a shield.
"A prima facie showing has been
made, with direct relevance to the
tapes, that somebody has committed
perjury."
Great Cases, Bad Law
The President's Kaplan reminded
the court that great cases make bad
law and said the framers of the
Constitution "provided that there
should be but one check on the
powers of the office, and that check
should be impeachment."
The confidentiality of
conversations, this Kaplan declared, is
"committed to the President's
discretion."
"If such a privilege existed," Judge
Renfrew asked, "hasn't it been
waived?"
Replied the erstwhile narrower of
privilege: "No, your honor."
The house roared.
"The Constitutional basis, the
reason for confidentiality, is so the
President can use information as he

wishes," Kaplan continued. "The
President himself determines whether
information given to him should stay
confidential and in what way it should
be released."
Imposed Silence
By forcing the President to give up
the tapes, Kaplan said, "you're forcing
the President to say nothing about the
tapes to anybody, or at least in

public."
"Isn't that what's meant by
confidentiality?" asked Justice Mosk.
The prosecutor's Kaplan waived
rebuttal against the President's Kaplan
— "I don't think anything my brother
has said has changed anything," he
noted — and so John Kaplan
concluded his case, confident that for
once both sides had been ably argued.

of land in the occupied Sinai peninsula
in savage desert fighting. But the
Israeli command said the assault was
beaten back to a line three or four
miles from the Suez Canal and the
Egyptians lost more than 200 tanks.
The command in Tel Aviv said that
656 Israeli soldiers were killed in the
first eight days of Middle East fighting,
including the commander of Israeli
tank forces in the Sinai. The new
conflict, the fourth Arab-Israeli war
since 1948, broke out Oct. 6.
In Tel Aviv, the state radio said
about 2000 Israeli soldiers, wounded
on the Syrian and Egyptian fronts,
were hospitalized.
Some diplomatic sources in Cairo
viewed the new Egyptian offensive in
the Sinai as an attempt to divert Israeli
energy from the hard-pressed Arab
forces in Syria.
Tanks Approach Damascus
The Israeli tanks punching into
Syria moved up to the town of Sasa
about 21 miles southwest of Damascus
and the Tel Aviv command said its
advance artillery was shelling the
suburbs of the Syrian capital.
Officers told newsmen some
spearhead units had probed to within
16 miles of Damascus on Saturday.
But Associated Press photographer
Spartaco podini said the main Israeli
column trying to seize control of Sasa
ran into tough resistance from Syrian
snipers.
AP special correspondent Hugh A.
Mulligan said the advance also was
slowed by the Syrian shelling.
Israelis Slowed
"Keeping the Israeli spearhead

going is difficult because of murderous
Syrian artillery fire," Mulligan said
from the Syrian front. "The Israelis
are not having much success in
knocking out these long-range Soviet
guns firing from the front and the
flanks."
Residents of the Syrian capital said
in telephone calls to Beirut, Lebanon,
that they heard no explosions near the
city. A Syrian government newspaper
published a special edition to deny the
Israeli shelling claims.
There was no word of effective aid
from Jordan, which announced its
entry into the war Saturday. But a
spokesman in Damascus reported the
Syrian lines were bolstered by Iraqis
and Moroccans and called the defenses
"good and strong."
Communiques from Damascus said

Israeli jets were attacking air fields in
Syria and claimed shooting down
several of them. The Egyptian military
command claimed 24 Israeli warplanes
were shot down in dogfights swirling
over the Sinai tank battles.
Cairo claimed its armor struck out
against the Israeli defenders at dawn
and recaptured more of the occupied
peninsula behind Egyptian warplanes
bombing Israeli positions all along the
front.
"Fighting is still raging with heavy
violence and savagery all along the
front inside Sinai between our
armored and mechanized forces
advancing east and the enemy forces
trying to stop them," an Egyptian
communique said.
Tel Aviv claimed its jets and tanks
Kaplan said. "But it cannot be
selective ... it [cannot be] a sword as
well as a shield.
"A prima facie showing has been
made, with direct relevance to the
tapes, that somebody has committed
perjury."
Great Cases, Bad Law
The President's Kaplan reminded
the court that great cases make bad
law and said the framers of the
Constitution "provided that there
should be but one check on the
powers of the office, and that check
should be impeachment."
The confidentiality of
conversations, this Kaplan declared, is
"committed to the President's
discretion."
"If such a privilege existed," Judge
Renfrew asked, "hasn't it been
waived?"
Replied the erstwhile narrower of
privilege: "No, your honor."
The house roared.
"The Constitutional basis, the
reason for confidentiality, is so the
President can use information as he

wishes," Kaplan continued. "The
President himself determines whether
information given to him should stay
confidential and in what way it should
be released."
Imposed Silence
By forcing the President to give up
the tapes, Kaplan said, "you're forcing
the President to say nothing about the
tapes to anybody, or at least in

public."
"Isn't that what's meant by
confidentiality?" asked Justice Mosk.
The prosecutor's Kaplan waived
rebuttal against the President's Kaplan
— "I don't think anything my brother
has said has changed anything," he
noted — and so John Kaplan
concluded his case, confident that for
once both sides had been ably argued.
