# Daily Humiliates Outmanned Daily Bruin
## 
### 
The Stanford Daily Thunderturkeys unveiled
a new offensive formation and a few unfamiliar
names to defeat the UCLA Daily Bruin squad,
19-6, in a touch football game Saturday behind
Maples Pavilion.
Reserve quarterback Stan ("The Man") Wilson
tossed three touchdown passes to pace the
Thunderturkey attack, while a stingy defense
kept the DB in its own territory for much of the
game.
Wilson devised a modified fishbone
formation in the first Thunderturkey Buddie of
the game, unruffled by the fact that the team
had never used it in practice. The formation
never worked correctly — but the Turkeys didn't
need it to exploit gaps in the Bruin defense.
The Bruins were bolstered by the loan of
Turkeys Rich Cortez and Don "Cheap Shot"
Tollefson. Tollefson, playing both offense and
defense, lived up his nickname by taking several
cheap shots at his own erstwhile teammates.
The Turkeys drew blood the first time they
got their hands on the ball, when, on a broken
play, Wilson hit little Dave "Chip Shot"
Robinson, a 5-9, 160-pound junior from St.
Louis, for the game's first score. The extra-point
conversion failed, leaving the Daily ahead 6 0.
Buz Battle, who had an outstanding day on

both offense and defense, stopped a Bruin drive
cold by intercepting a pass to set up the next
Daily score, which came on Wilson's second TD
pass, this one to Randy Livingston on a broken
play.
With the score 12-0, the Turkeys scored for
the last time when Battle snared a Wilson
desperation pass on another broken play. Wilson
again found the Buzzer in the end zone for the
conversion, giving the Daily a 19-0 lead.
Turncoat Tollefson set up the only BruinJ
score when he caught a Bruin pass deep in Daily<
territory. Two plays later, the Bruins ran it in forj
the touchdown. i
The Turkeys were playing without three of<
their top offensive performers, quarterback Hall]

On defense, the Turkeys' non-sexist <
three-person rush — consisting for most of the (
game of player-coach Jim "Woody" Wascher,'
Andy Bridges and Lynn Mumby — kept constant,
pressure on the harried Bruin passer. <
Defensive player of the game honors went to a (

nearly out of the game and out of this life. <
