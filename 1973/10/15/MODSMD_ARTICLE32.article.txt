# Women Stop SJS In Field Hockey Opener
## 
### ELAINE MORITA 
It looks like the preseason
enthusiasm for Stanford's
women's field hockey team was
justified. Saturday morning the
team left at 7:30 a.m. for its first
game of the season against San
Jose State. They returned at noon
with wins for both the varsity and
junior varsity teams.
The Stanford women charged
enthusiastically down the field
despite the morning heat,
displaying the determination
which coach Shirley Schoof hopes
will carry the team to a victorious
season. The varsity rallied behind
the alert goal tending of Betsy
Morris to record a 5-0 victory
while the JV's edged the Spartans,
3-0.
Lyse Stranad scored the first
varsity goal early in the first half
and Marina Ballintyne and
freshman Kathy Levinson each
added two goals before halftime.
In the second half the two teams
played to a 0-0 standoff, safely
preserving Stanford's five-goal
lead.

Ann Wacker led the JV scoring
with two goals, with Nancy Schie
adding the third Stanford score.
Both teams escaped without
any serious injuries, although a
few bumps and bruises resulted
from minor collisions.
One JV player, Lorrie Duval,
pointed to the varsity's experience
as a major factor in its victory.
Several of the varsity starters are
returning veterans from last
season, and Stanford obviously
benefitted from the fact that
many of the players were familiar
with their teammates' style of
play.
Schoof hopes that later in the
season Stanford will be able to
employ even more advanced
strategy because of the team's
experience.
Stanford's next game is
Thursday, when the varsity meets
Cal State Hay ward at 3:30 p.m.
on the Women's Field. The junior
varsity will also be in action here
Thursday as the JV battles West
Vallev College.
