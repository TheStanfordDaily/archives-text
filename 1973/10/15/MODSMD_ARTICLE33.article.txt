Military Solution Needed—Ford
WASHINGTON — Vice President-designate Gerald R.
Ford expressed hope yesterday "we get a military solution
quickly" in the Middle East war.
"You can't get a diplomatic solution until you have a
military solution," Ford told newsmen who questioned
him following White House worship services.
The veteran congressman nominated to succeed Spiro
T. Agnew in the nation's second highest office was briefed
on the Middle East Saturday by President Nixon and
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger.
Asked about U.S. aid to Israel, Ford said "we are
certainly fully meeting all of our commitments in the
ongoing program," which he described as "very
substantial."
When asked whether he saw hope that the fighting
would end soon, Ford responded that it is "a possibility —
I hope so. I hope we get a military solution quickly and
then we can work on a diplomatic solution."
The improptu session with reporters proceeded Ford's
departure on a long-scheduled trip to the western United
States.
Thai Premier Resigns
BANGKOK, Thailand — The head of the military
government resigned yesterday in the wake of violent
street clashes between authorities and thousands of
demonstrators. He was replaced with the first civilian
premier since 1953.
Dr. Sanya Thammasak, rector of the university where
most of the demonstrations were organized, was named
by the king to succeed Premier Thanom Kittikachom.
The new premier announced on radio and television
yesterday that there would be a new constitution within
six months, with general elections to follow as soon as
possible.
Agnew Addresses Nation Tonight
WASHINGTON — Former Vice President Spiro T.
Agnew addresses a television audience tonight and sources
indicated the farewell speech may be an instruction on
avoiding the problems that ruined his political career.
The approximately 15-minute speech is to be televised
live at 4:30 p.m. PDT by NBC and CBS.
Agnew resigned Wednesday and pleaded no contest to
a federal charge of income tax evasion.
He spent much of the weekend working on the speech,
without the help of his speechwriters.
"Lessons learned and some recommended
improvements" might be included in the speech, touching

on a description, from Agnew's view, of the hazards of a
system that encourages corrupt activities by politicians, a
source said.
Mays Is The Key To Mets' Win
OAKLAND — Aging Willie Mays, in his final days as a
major league baseball player, delivered a 12th-inning single
to key New York's four-run rally yesterday and the Mets
defeated Oakland 10-7 in the second game of the 1973
World Series.
The Mets' victory, in a game which required more time
than any previous one in World Series history, tied the
best-of-seven series at 1-1. The teams move to New York
for Game 3 tomorrow night.
Oakland scored one more run in a 12th-inning rally
keyed by Reggie Jackson's triple, but Mets' relief pitcher
George Stone put out the fire with the bases loaded.
Bud Harrelson, thrown out at the plate on a
controversial call two innings earlier, doubled to open the
Mets' 12th and scored when the 42-year-old Mays
bounced a two-out single through the middle of the
diamond.
Then two errors by A's second baseman Mike Andrews
allowed three more Met runs before the rally ended.
The Mets thought they had a run in the 10th when
Harrelson tried to score from third on Felix Millan's fly to
Joe Rudi in left. But plate umpire Augie Donatelli called
the runner out, touching off a raging argument.
Numerous television replays, from several camera
angles, indicated that A's catcher Ray Fosse missed the
tag on Harrelson.

Thai Premier Resigns
BANGKOK, Thailand — The head of the military
government resigned yesterday in the wake of violent
street clashes between authorities and thousands of
demonstrators. He was replaced with the first civilian
premier since 1953.
Dr. Sanya Thammasak, rector of the university where
most of the demonstrations were organized, was named
by the king to succeed Premier Thanom Kittikachom.
The new premier announced on radio and television
yesterday that there would be a new constitution within
six months, with general elections to follow as soon as
possible.
Agnew Addresses Nation Tonight
WASHINGTON — Former Vice President Spiro T.
Agnew addresses a television audience tonight and sources
indicated the farewell speech may be an instruction on
avoiding the problems that ruined his political career.
The approximately 15-minute speech is to be televised
live at 4:30 p.m. PDT by NBC and CBS.
Agnew resigned Wednesday and pleaded no contest to
a federal charge of income tax evasion.
He spent much of the weekend working on the speech,
without the help of his speechwriters.
"Lessons learned and some recommended
improvements" might be included in the speech, touching

on a description, from Agnew's view, of the hazards of a
system that encourages corrupt activities by politicians, a
source said.
Mays Is The Key To Mets' Win
OAKLAND — Aging Willie Mays, in his final days as a
major league baseball player, delivered a 12th-inning single
to key New York's four-run rally yesterday and the Mets
defeated Oakland 10-7 in the second game of the 1973
World Series.
The Mets' victory, in a game which required more time
than any previous one in World Series history, tied the
best-of-seven series at 1-1. The teams move to New York
for Game 3 tomorrow night.
Oakland scored one more run in a 12th-inning rally
keyed by Reggie Jackson's triple, but Mets' relief pitcher
George Stone put out the fire with the bases loaded.
Bud Harrelson, thrown out at the plate on a
controversial call two innings earlier, doubled to open the
Mets' 12th and scored when the 42-year-old Mays
bounced a two-out single through the middle of the
diamond.
Then two errors by A's second baseman Mike Andrews
allowed three more Met runs before the rally ended.
The Mets thought they had a run in the 10th when
Harrelson tried to score from third on Felix Millan's fly to
Joe Rudi in left. But plate umpire Augie Donatelli called
the runner out, touching off a raging argument.
Numerous television replays, from several camera
angles, indicated that A's catcher Ray Fosse missed the
tag on Harrelson.

Military Solution Needed—Ford
WASHINGTON — Vice President-designate Gerald R.
Ford expressed hope yesterday "we get a military solution
quickly" in the Middle East war.
"You can't get a diplomatic solution until you have a
military solution," Ford told newsmen who questioned

The veteran congressman nominated to succeed Spiro
T. Agnew in the nation's second highest office was briefed
on the Middle East Saturday by President Nixon and

I hope so. I hope we get a military solution quickly and
then we can work on a diplomatic solution."
The improptu session with reporters proceeded Ford's
