# Kaplan Argues Ably--Both Pro And Con
## Moot Court Hears Executive Privilege Case 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
"The only privilege the President
has claimed — confidentiality — has
clearly been waived," argued John
Kaplan, Esq., counsel for Special
Watergate Prosecutor Archibald Cox.
"This is a case," replied John
Kaplan, Esq., counsel for the
President, "where satisfying one's
curiosity can place this court in the
position of dealing a serious blow, not
only to the President, but to the
nation as a whole."
The Law School's moot court and
the audience of 375 in Annenberg Art
Auditorium listened gravely. The issue
was that of Executive Privilege; the
case, whether the President of the
United States should be compelled to
answer a subpoena for nine tape
recordings of conversations with his
advisers.
And the learned counsel — for both
President and prosecutor — was the
ebullient John Kaplan, professor of
Law.
Mock Court
Kaplan argued both sides of the
tapes appeal Friday before a mock
United States Supreme Court
composed of California Supreme
Court Justice Stanley Mosk and

Federal District Court Judges Robert
F. Peckham and Charles B. Renfrew.
His arguments were delivered with
equal facility, equal enthusiasm, and
almost equal conviction. They were
addressed, however, to different
concerns.
The argument on behalf of Cox —
to release the tapes — rested on a
contention that the confidentiality of
Presidential conversations has been
waived by the President's permission
to his former advisers to testify about
the content of those conversations.
Broader Conception
The argument on behalf of the
President — not to release the tapes —
was based on a much broader
conception of Presidential privilege, a
much looser conception of
'confidentiality' and fear of infringing
on the President's constitutional
powers.
The prosecutor's Kaplan declared
that the President's acquiescence to
subpoenas of his former advisers was
like telling Watergate investigators to
"go ahead and find out every thing you
can — until it became clear that there
actually was a way of finding out."
"We concede that privilege,"

BOTH SIDES NOW — Law Prof. John Kaplan argued both sides of the case on
Executive Privilege before the Law School's Moot Court Friday. The case was
heard by California Supreme Court Justice Stanley Mosk and Federal District
Court Judges Robert F. Peckham and Charles B. Renfrew.
"are inflicting heavy losses on the
enemy and his armored forces." Israeli
spokesmen said the Egyptian advance
was stopped short and the Egyptian
tanks were forced to return to their
lines.
"In the south we have entered into
a critical phase of the war," said
Retired Gen. Haim Herzog, the Israeli
state radio's top war commentator.
"But it is not yet clear whether this is
Egypt's major offensive."
Israel protested to France that
French-built Mirage jets were being
used in Egyptian attacks on Israeli
targets. Cairo's air arsenal was
authoritatively reported to contain no

Mirages before the war.
Libya, which has agreed to merge
with Egypt, has purchased a number
of the French jets from Paris. Israel
has complained they might be used
against the Jewish state despite a
French embargo on arms sales to
countries directly involved in the
Middle East conflict.
Syrian communiques reported naval
battles with Israeli boats in the
Mediterranean and said the Syrians
sank two Israeli gunboats. They made
no mention of the Tel Aviv claims that
Israeli's U.S.-built 175 mm cannons
with a 20-mile range blasted targets
near Damascus.
