# Tax Reform Threatens Fund Raising Drive
## 
### GLENN KRAMON 
The five-year Campaign for
Stanford has raised $122 million to
date in gifts and pledges — some 41
percent of its $300 million objective —
President Richard Lyman announced
Friday.
Initiated in April 1972 as the
largest fund-raising campaign ever
undertaken by an American university,
the drive has been carried out by some
2900 University alumni and friends.
Addressing 350 people at the ninth
annual Stanford Volunteer Leadership
Conference at Bowman alumni house
Friday, Lyman warned that "under
the banner of 'tax reform'... a
variety of proposals are being
promoted today that would cut

drastically into the flow of resources
that support the private universities
and colleges, as well as ... other social
and cultural institutions supported by
private giving."
Surrey Proposal
Lyman criticized one such
proposal, by Harvard Prof. Stanley
Surrey, that the government tax the
prospective donor and decide how to
spend such funds, "rather than allow
private donors to decide where the
society can best use some added help."
"I believe we would lose an
essential ingredient in the pluralism
and responsiveness of American
institutions were we to adopt the
seductive notion that only through
government can problems that extend
beyond the individual be tackled
effectively and equitably," he
continued.
Lyman attacked legislation adopted
in 1969 to "correct abuses in the
system of private philanthropy" which
"imposed on the great public
foundations of this country some
burdens that have lessened their
effectiveness, particularly a tax on
them that could only result in fewer
dollars available to the recipients of
foundation grants."
Tax Reform
He urged the fund-raisers to follow
closely tax reform proposals
concerning charitable deduction which
will come before Congress "probably
next January .... It could drastically
affect our capacity to do our job as
supporters of Stanford."
Noting that the campaign "is not a
prelude to a great expansion of the
University," Lyman said that he has
no intention of increasing student
body size.
The University does not "intend to
undercut the strength that a successful
campaign can give us by becoming
over-extended, by launching ourselves
upon new ventures that in the long run
would put us back in the category of
the under-endowed," he continued.
Lyman emphasized the need for
"unrestricted donations" — funds
given to the University without a
binding clause designating that they be
used for a specific purpose.

Surrey, that the government tax the
prospective donor and decide how to
spend such funds, "rather than allow
private donors to decide where the
society can best use some added help."
"I believe we would lose an
essential ingredient in the pluralism
and responsiveness of American
institutions were we to adopt the
seductive notion that only through
government can problems that extend
beyond the individual be tackled
effectively and equitably," he
continued.
Lyman attacked legislation adopted
in 1969 to "correct abuses in the
system of private philanthropy" which
"imposed on the great public
foundations of this country some
burdens that have lessened their
effectiveness, particularly a tax on
them that could only result in fewer
dollars available to the recipients of
foundation grants."
Tax Reform
He urged the fund-raisers to follow
closely tax reform proposals
concerning charitable deduction which
will come before Congress "probably
next January .... It could drastically
affect our capacity to do our job as
supporters of Stanford."
Noting that the campaign "is not a
prelude to a great expansion of the
University," Lyman said that he has
no intention of increasing student
body size.
The University does not "intend to
undercut the strength that a successful
campaign can give us by becoming
over-extended, by launching ourselves
upon new ventures that in the long run
would put us back in the category of
the under-endowed," he continued.
Lyman emphasized the need for
"unrestricted donations" — funds
given to the University without a
binding clause designating that they be
used for a specific purpose.
