# Barnes Provides Arranging Genius For LSJUMB

### KITTY PATTERSON 
Arthur Barnes has a finger in every pie.
When he's not teaching music classes, he's
conducting the Stanford Band. When he's not
transcribing rock songs, he's speculating on
the stock market.
Many students know Barnes solely as
director of the Stanford Band. He took over
the job 10 years ago. If Band members have
their way, he'll keep it at least another 10.
Since the football team has fallen on hard
times, the band has become a crucial drawing
card at games.
Band members say that Barnes is
responsible for much of their musical skill.
Says horn player Steve Beck, "He deserves
most of the credit. If he wasn't so tight about
our playing, we wouldn't be nearly as good."
Barnes has arranged almost every song the
band has played in the last five years — about
300 in all. He transcribes them directly from
records. Although he uses no written scores,
like song books, to help him, he can figure out
an arrangement in about four hours.
Every Monday night, the band practices
Barnes' latest arrangements. As he conducts,
his body sways with the music — until he
hears something wrong. Then he yells out the
beats or notes the band has missed, until each

section has learned its part.
"I listen carefully for arrangement
problems," he says. "If something's wrong, I'll
cover my ears to hear the music in my head.
Then I'll know how to change it."
Born with a good ear and a knack for
arranging music, Barnes said that his talents
still took time to develop. "I had to teach
myself all the specifics — like picking sound
straight off the record and sensing what
combinations sound best."
Band players respect his know-how. Says
one four-year veteran, "He's one of the best
leaders I've ever seen." Barnes has made many
friends among the players. He celebrates with
them on tour and after games. "He's a really
good man. He even treats on drinks if he
knows you well," one said.
Gross Jokes
Unlike some football fans, Barnes is not
put off by the band's gross jokes. "By now,"
he says, "I'm inured to it." He rarely helps
plan the band's marching formations. He
laughs, "I leave that to SMUT [Stanford
Marching Unit Thinkers]," a group of
bandsmen who devise the halftime show.
Barnes attributes the band's popularity to
its close affinity with the Stanford student
body. "What the band guys do," he says,

"reflects who they are and where the student
body is at that point."
Barnes estimates he spends about 10
percent of his time directing the band, but
he's busy every moment. For example, on
Monday morning he corrects the papers he has

to return to his 11 a.m. class. Students and
colleagues drop by his office constantly. He
skips lunch to rehearse with another group he
sponsors, the Stanford Wind Ensemble. At 1
p.m., he holds office hours. At 2 p.m., he
attends a faculty meeting, and by 4 p.m., he
has finished the arrangement of the song he'll
teach the band that evening.
Performer
Barnes was a performer as an
undergraduate at Wichita State University in
the early 19505. As a graduate student he
turned to teaching. "Performance is too
chancy," he explains. 'There's not enough
money and no security. Besides, I prefer
teaching."
Barnes taught at three other colleges before
coming to Stanford to work on a doctorate in
conducting and to lead the band. Now he is a
senior lecturer.
He has a unique talent for teaching. Gerald
Chappell, a master's candidate in choral
conducting, says, "He's the finest teacher in
the Music Department. He communicates
clearly with his students, even on difficult
material, and he just knows so much."
"He doesn't try to act like a professor. He's
one of the few professors you feel
comfortable calling by his first name."

Like most teachers, Barnes has his
favorites. Chappell calls him a ladies' man.
"He really gets along well with the girls. I
guess one reason is that he's used to treating
his wife and daughters like princesses."
Barnes has so little time for his family that
he pampers them whenever he can. However,
they're usually as busy as he. His children
attend school in Palo Alto and play various
musical instruments. His wife freelances as a
French horn player.
The family meets at least once a day."I
insist that we all get together at breakfast,"
says Barnes. "It's the only time I can be sure
we'll all be there."
Barnes keeps busy even on weekends. He
attends every Stanford football game, both at
home and on the road. On Sundays, he leads
the local Unitarian Church choir.
Barnes enjoys variety. Despite his heavy
workload, he welcomes new projects. This
winter, he'll teach a freshman seminar on
arranging band music.
"This is a young man's job," he admits.
"Someday, I know I'll get tired."
Right now, however, Arthur Barnes shows
no signs of slowing down.
