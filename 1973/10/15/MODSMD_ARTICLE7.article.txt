# Repression, Subversion Worsen
## Nixon Favors New Reform 
### 
Webster's Dictionary defines the verb "subvert"
as meaning "to overturn; overthrow; ruin utterly,"
or "to undermine the morals, allegiance, or faith of;
corrupt." By this definition, President Nixon must
be considered our country's most dangerous
subversive. His contempt for Constitutional
principles, evidenced abroad by the secret bombing
of Cambodia and the illegal use of Thai mercenaries
in Laos, has nowhere been more clearly revealed
than in his domestic activities, particularly those
dealing with political dissent and social disorder.
On the domestic scene, his crimes range from
selling government favors to ITT, Vesco, Howard
Hughes, the dairy industry, and others, to the
bribery of Judge Bryne and the Ellsberg break-in
(which he indirectly ordered). Nixon continues to
impound funds appropriated by Congress despite
repeated court orders to the contrary. He has
pursued his Southern Strategy in violation of the
1968 Civil Rights Act which ordered the President
to do everything within his power to execute its
provisions.
His most serious offense, revealed several months
ago, was the authorization of the 1970 "Huston"
plan. This secret plan, which Nixon formally
approved with full knowledge of the illegality of its
contents, provided for a massive campaign of
unchecked wiretapping of political opponents,
surreptitious opening of the mails, expanded use of
police informers and provocateurs, increased
surveillance of American tourists abroad, and other
fundamental violations of civil liberties.
The plan authorized the formation of the
infamous "plumbers" squad to be used alongside a
proposed domestic intelligence apparatus consisting
of elements of the FBI, CIA (legally barred from
such domestic activity), the National Security
Agency, and the Defense Intelligence Agency. The
recent exposure of the plumbers squad, the
wiretapping campaign of the Justice Department
even in the face of adverse Supreme Court rulings,
and the revelations of CIA training of domestic
police forces confirms the contention of most
witnesses that Nixon never in fact revoked the
Huston plan.
Violation Of Fourth Amendment
With the help of such former associates as John
Mitchell, Nixon has also moved through legislative
channels to corrode and subvert this country's Bill
of Rights. His first major attack on civil liberties
took the form of the 1970 "Omnibus" crime
control bill for Washington D.C. The bill established
preventive detention to bypass the bail laws. It
established "no-knock" rules of entry in violation of
the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against
unreasonable searches and seizures.
The recent wave of mistaken but violent house
raids by federal narcotics agents highlights the
danger inherent in this law. The 1970 legislation
established the new category of "use immunity" in
violation of the Fifth Amendment — a prosecutor's
dream which has been turned sharply against the
Administration in the Watergate hearings.
Those who refuse to testify before Grand Juries
after being granted such limited immunity can be
jailed for up to three years — a provision exploited

by federal prosecutors during their frequent "fishing
expeditions" against the Left. The D.C. bill also
legitimized the use of illegally obtained evidence in
some cases, and gave judges the power to impose 30
year jail sentences on anyone they deem a
"dangerous special offender."
Ominous Silence
Since the Watergate revelations, Nixon has
understandably toned down his public "law and
order" campaign. Quietly though, he is moving as
actively as ever to impose restrictions on the rights
of Americans. If all goes according to plan, Nixon
will soon win Congressional approval for his
"Criminal Code Reform Act of 1973," drafted
largely by none other than John Mitchell. It has
something for everyone.
The bill defines as a serious felony any
communication of classified information to an
unauthorized recipient, even if the information is
improperly classified in the first place by any one of
thousands of government security personnel in
Washington. As Senator Muskie has noted, "A
reporter who catches the government in a lie, who
uncovers fraud, who unearths examples of
monumental waste could go to jail — even if he
could show, beyond any question, that the
government had no right to keep the information
secret and that its release could not possibly harm
the national defense." Watch out, Jack Anderson!
Nixon's criminal code "reform" reinstates the
death penalty and eliminates the insanity plea. It
also revives the unconstitutional Smith Act by
providing for up to 15 years in jail for mere
advocacy or membership in an organization that
professes to support revolution.
Repression Expanded
His bill would extend the repressive 1968
Anti-Riot Law, which defines a "riot" as any
"assemblage of five" which "creates a grave danger"
to "property," and would impose jail sentences of
up to three years and a $15,000 fine for the use of
the mails or telephones to promote such a "riot."
Other sections of the Act, vaguely worded for
maximum coverage, could outlaw virtually every
major form of political protest in this country.
Finally, the bill would give Nixon almost
unlimited powers to wiretap those whom he thinks
comprise a "danger to the structure" of the
government. Federal agents could impose 48 hour
wiretaps without any court approval whatsoever and
compel landlords and telephone workers to
cooperate with their surveillance efforts.
Indeed, the Criminal Code Reform Act of 1973
would extend to the entire nation a set of extremely
repressive measures first initiated for Washington
D.C. in 1970. Nixon could use these laws, if upheld
by his own Supreme Court, to cudgel the press and
suppress political opponents, as he attempted to do
most recently (after a long string of such cases) to
the Vietnam Veterans Against the War. But the
measure has not yet passed the Congress. We still
have time to prevent this latest act of subversion
from becoming law.

something for everyone.
The bill defines as a serious felony any
communication of classified information to an
unauthorized recipient, even if the information is
improperly classified in the first place by any one of
thousands of government security personnel in
Washington. As Senator Muskie has noted, "A
reporter who catches the government in a lie, who
uncovers fraud, who unearths examples of
monumental waste could go to jail — even if he
could show, beyond any question, that the
government had no right to keep the information
secret and that its release could not possibly harm
the national defense." Watch out, Jack Anderson!
Nixon's criminal code "reform" reinstates the
death penalty and eliminates the insanity plea. It
also revives the unconstitutional Smith Act by
providing for up to 15 years in jail for mere
advocacy or membership in an organization that
professes to support revolution.
Repression Expanded
His bill would extend the repressive 1968
Anti-Riot Law, which defines a "riot" as any
"assemblage of five" which "creates a grave danger"
to "property," and would impose jail sentences of
up to three years and a $15,000 fine for the use of
the mails or telephones to promote such a "riot."
Other sections of the Act, vaguely worded for
maximum coverage, could outlaw virtually every
major form of political protest in this country.
Finally, the bill would give Nixon almost
unlimited powers to wiretap those whom he thinks
comprise a "danger to the structure" of the
government. Federal agents could impose 48 hour
wiretaps without any court approval whatsoever and
compel landlords and telephone workers to
cooperate with their surveillance efforts.
Indeed, the Criminal Code Reform Act of 1973
would extend to the entire nation a set of extremely
repressive measures first initiated for Washington
D.C. in 1970. Nixon could use these laws, if upheld
by his own Supreme Court, to cudgel the press and
suppress political opponents, as he attempted to do
most recently (after a long string of such cases) to
the Vietnam Veterans Against the War. But the
measure has not yet passed the Congress. We still
have time to prevent this latest act of subversion
from becoming law.

Webster's Dictionary defines the verb "subvert"
as meaning "to overturn; overthrow; ruin utterly,"
or "to undermine the morals, allegiance, or faith of;
corrupt." By this definition, President Nixon must
be considered our country's most dangerous
subversive. His contempt for Constitutional
principles, evidenced abroad by the secret bombing
of Cambodia and the illegal use of Thai mercenaries
in Laos, has nowhere been more clearly revealed
than in his domestic activities, particularly those
dealing with political dissent and social disorder.
On the domestic scene, his crimes range from
selling government favors to ITT, Vesco, Howard
Hughes, the dairy industry, and others, to the
bribery of Judge Bryne and the Ellsberg break-in
(which he indirectly ordered). Nixon continues to
impound funds appropriated by Congress despite
repeated court orders to the contrary. He has
pursued his Southern Strategy in violation of the
1968 Civil Rights Act which ordered the President
to do everything within his power to execute its
provisions.
His most serious offense, revealed several months
ago, was the authorization of the 1970 "Huston"
plan. This secret plan, which Nixon formally
approved with full knowledge of the illegality of its
contents, provided for a massive campaign of
unchecked wiretapping of political opponents,
surreptitious opening of the mails, expanded use of
police informers and provocateurs, increased
surveillance of American tourists abroad, and other
fundamental violations of civil liberties.
The plan authorized the formation of the
infamous "plumbers" squad to be used alongside a
proposed domestic intelligence apparatus consisting
of elements of the FBI, CIA (legally barred from
such domestic activity), the National Security
Agency, and the Defense Intelligence Agency. The
recent exposure of the plumbers squad, the
wiretapping campaign of the Justice Department
even in the face of adverse Supreme Court rulings,
and the revelations of CIA training of domestic
police forces confirms the contention of most
witnesses that Nixon never in fact revoked the
Huston plan.
Violation Of Fourth Amendment
With the help of such former associates as John
Mitchell, Nixon has also moved through legislative
channels to corrode and subvert this country's Bill
of Rights. His first major attack on civil liberties
took the form of the 1970 "Omnibus" crime
control bill for Washington D.C. The bill established
preventive detention to bypass the bail laws. It
established "no-knock" rules of entry in violation of
the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against
unreasonable searches and seizures.
The recent wave of mistaken but violent house
raids by federal narcotics agents highlights the
danger inherent in this law. The 1970 legislation
established the new category of "use immunity" in
violation of the Fifth Amendment — a prosecutor's
dream which has been turned sharply against the
Administration in the Watergate hearings.
Those who refuse to testify before Grand Juries
after being granted such limited immunity can be
jailed for up to three years — a provision exploited

Jonathan Marshall

by federal prosecutors during their frequent "fishing
expeditions" against the Left. The D.C. bill also
legitimized the use of illegally obtained evidence in
some cases, and gave judges the power to impose 30
year jail sentences on anyone they deem a
"dangerous special offender."
Ominous Silence
Since the Watergate revelations, Nixon has
understandably toned down his public "law and
order" campaign. Quietly though, he is moving as
actively as ever to impose restrictions on the rights
of Americans. If all goes according to plan, Nixon
will soon win Congressional approval for his
"Criminal Code Reform Act of 1973," drafted

surreptitious opening of the mails, expanded use of
police informers and provocateurs, increased
surveillance of American tourists abroad, and other
fundamental violations of civil liberties.
The plan authorized the formation of the
infamous "plumbers" squad to be used alongside a
proposed domestic intelligence apparatus consisting
of elements of the FBI, CIA (legally barred from
such domestic activity), the National Security
Agency, and the Defense Intelligence Agency. The
recent exposure of the plumbers squad, the
wiretapping campaign of the Justice Department
even in the face of adverse Supreme Court rulings,
and the revelations of CIA training of domestic
police forces confirms the contention of most
witnesses that Nixon never in fact revoked the
Huston plan.
Violation Of Fourth Amendment
With the help of such former associates as John
Mitchell, Nixon has also moved through legislative
channels to corrode and subvert this country's Bill
of Rights. His first major attack on civil liberties
took the form of the 1970 "Omnibus" crime
control bill for Washington D.C. The bill established
preventive detention to bypass the bail laws. It
established "no-knock" rules of entry in violation of
the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against
unreasonable searches and seizures.
The recent wave of mistaken but violent house
raids by federal narcotics agents highlights the
danger inherent in this law. The 1970 legislation
established the new category of "use immunity" in
violation of the Fifth Amendment — a prosecutor's
dream which has been turned sharply against the
Administration in the Watergate hearings.
Those who refuse to testify before Grand Juries
after being granted such limited immunity can be
jailed for up to three years — a provision exploited

by federal prosecutors during their frequent "fishing
expeditions" against the Left. The D.C. bill also
legitimized the use of illegally obtained evidence in
some cases, and gave judges the power to impose 30
year jail sentences on anyone they deem a
"dangerous special offender."
Ominous Silence
Since the Watergate revelations, Nixon has
understandably toned down his public "law and
order" campaign. Quietly though, he is moving as
actively as ever to impose restrictions on the rights
of Americans. If all goes according to plan, Nixon
will soon win Congressional approval for his
"Criminal Code Reform Act of 1973," drafted
largely by none other than John Mitchell. It has
something for everyone.
The bill defines as a serious felony any
communication of classified information to an
unauthorized recipient, even if the information is
improperly classified in the first place by any one of
thousands of government security personnel in
Washington. As Senator Muskie has noted, "A
reporter who catches the government in a lie, who
uncovers fraud, who unearths examples of
monumental waste could go to jail — even if he
could show, beyond any question, that the
government had no right to keep the information
secret and that its release could not possibly harm
the national defense." Watch out, Jack Anderson!
Nixon's criminal code "reform" reinstates the
death penalty and eliminates the insanity plea. It
also revives the unconstitutional Smith Act by
providing for up to 15 years in jail for mere
advocacy or membership in an organization that
professes to support revolution.
Repression Expanded
His bill would extend the repressive 1968
Anti-Riot Law, which defines a "riot" as any
"assemblage of five" which "creates a grave danger"
to "property," and would impose jail sentences of
up to three years and a $15,000 fine for the use of
the mails or telephones to promote such a "riot."
Other sections of the Act, vaguely worded for
maximum coverage, could outlaw virtually every
major form of political protest in this country.
Finally, the bill would give Nixon almost
unlimited powers to wiretap those whom he thinks
comprise a "danger to the structure" of the
government. Federal agents could impose 48 hour
wiretaps without any court approval whatsoever and
compel landlords and telephone workers to
cooperate with their surveillance efforts.
Indeed, the Criminal Code Reform Act of 1973
would extend to the entire nation a set of extremely
repressive measures first initiated for Washington
D.C. in 1970. Nixon could use these laws, if upheld
by his own Supreme Court, to cudgel the press and
suppress political opponents, as he attempted to do
most recently (after a long string of such cases) to
the Vietnam Veterans Against the War. But the
measure has not yet passed the Congress. We still
have time to prevent this latest act of subversion
from becoming law.

Webster's Dictionary defines the verb "subvert"
as meaning "to overturn; overthrow; ruin utterly,"
or "to undermine the morals, allegiance, or faith of;
corrupt." By this definition, President Nixon must
be considered our country's most dangerous
subversive. His contempt for Constitutional
principles, evidenced abroad by the secret bombing
of Cambodia and the illegal use of Thai mercenaries
in Laos, has nowhere been more clearly revealed
than in his domestic activities, particularly those
dealing with political dissent and social disorder.
On the domestic scene, his crimes range from
selling government favors to ITT, Vesco, Howard
Hughes, the dairy industry, and others, to the
bribery of Judge Bryne and the Ellsberg break-in
(which he indirectly ordered). Nixon continues to
impound funds appropriated by Congress despite
repeated court orders to the contrary. He has
pursued his Southern Strategy in violation of the
1968 Civil Rights Act which ordered the President
to do everything within his power to execute its
provisions.
His most serious offense, revealed several months
ago, was the authorization of the 1970 "Huston"
plan. This secret plan, which Nixon formally
approved with full knowledge of the illegality of its
contents, provided for a massive campaign of
unchecked wiretapping of political opponents,
surreptitious opening of the mails, expanded use of
police informers and provocateurs, increased
surveillance of American tourists abroad, and other
fundamental violations of civil liberties.
