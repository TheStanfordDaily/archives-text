# Silence Is Not Golden
## Disinterest Creates Explosive Mood 
###

Commencement exercises are
often boring and unstimulating
affairs where well-known thinkers
come to deliver a trite and
pedantic message to the
graduating class. But now and
then a very important and
unexpected theme will be
sounded, a theme which may
affront some, inspire some, and
cause others discomfort, but one
which has a directness in its
appeal that insures thought and
reaction in everyone.
Last June that kind of theme
was sounded here at our own
commencement exercises by a
man whom few of the graduates
had ever heard of: John U.
Monro, the Director of Freshman
Studies at Miles College in
Alabama.
His was a moving message for
the graduating class, but,
unfortunately, it was a message at
least as crucial for all of the new
and remaining students here this
year. So as this wonderfully
pleasant and comfortable new
academic year begins perhaps we
can reflect a little bit on what
Monro has to say to us.
Dr. Monro's appeal is simply
this: conditions are not so
pleasant and wonderful elsewhere
in this world, and we who have
some ability to change those
conditions had better not get too
comfortable, lest we find the
world exploding in our children's
faces.
We live in a deeply
revolutionary and trying time,
warns Monro, a time that morally
and practically requires some
response from each of us to what
is happening, some sense of
outrage at the violation of
fundamental human ideals.
There are poor and hungry
people in America — tens of
thousands of them — Monro
reminds us. And there are poor
and hungry people in the
underdeveloped world — tens of
millions of them — doomed to
death or crippling malnutrition by
massive crop failures. "Does it
violate your sense of America,"he
asks us, "that we plan to do very
little about such starvation at
home or abroad, but are even now
planning seriously to spend
millions of dollars abroad to
promote the sale of American
tobacco?"
"Do deep, rat-infested slums
violate your sense of America?

Does the rape and pollution of
our environment for private profit
violate your sense of America?
"Does it trouble you that the
bottom 20 percent of Americans
on the economic ladder receive 3
percent of the national income,
while the top 20 percent receive
46 percent? Does it trouble you
that 5 percent of white workers
are unemployed, but 10 percent
of black workers, and 30 percent
of black teenagers?
"What about a society where
infant mortality for white
children is 19 per thousand, and
for black children 34 per
thousand? Or what about the fact
that some public school districts
in the USA spend 200 to 300
dollars a year per pupil while
others spend over 10,000 dollars?
Does it violate our sense of
America? Do we have any sense of
America, any set of deeply
cherished ideals to be violated?
If we do, then Monro appeals
to us to "get our backs into the
struggle." He reminds us of how
Martin Luther King, fresh out of
divinity school and working his
first pastorate, set aside a
comfortable and respectable
career to take to the streets and
lead a year long bus-strike of the
black community in Montgomery
Alabama.
He recalls the classic
confrontation of racism in
Birmingham in 1963, the struggle
which King led in the face of the
police dogs, fire hoses, brutal
beatings and persistent jailings.
And he emphasizes the results
that were produced by human
risks: beginning with the
desegregation of public facilities,
followed by progress in
desegregating hiring practices, by
a three-fold increase in the
number of black Americans in
college, by dramatic black
political gains all over the
country, and so on.
Because of all those risks,
Birmingham came to terms, says
Monro, and today it is a city of
hope, with black and whites
learning together in the schools
and working together in governing
the community.
It is not a totally cheerful
picture, of course. There are all
the remaining social injustices.
There is the atrophy of our
national political system, which
Monro views with alarm as
drifting rapidly "toward an
elective form of monarchy."

There is the fact that every
struggle involves sacrifice, and
every victory extracts its price —
loss of comfort, wealth, prestige,
even life. But victories do come if
we work and take some risks.
John Monro's own life is
testimony to that. In 1967, at 56,
he quit as the Dean of Harvard
College to build a freshman
studies program at a tiny, all-black
college in the deep South that
lacked even academic
accreditation. In the last six years,
Miles college has not only won
accreditation, but it has become a
strong and vital academic
institution, gaining the respect
and financial support of even the
white community in the city.
There is in Monro the faith
that slowly, painfully, and with
labor, change comes. Barriers are
destroyed, and in their
destruction is generated the
boldness to tackle new obstacles
and injustices.
We ought to learn from that.
We ought to think about it.
Monro addressed his words to a
graduating class being awarded
degrees of a status that will make
it particularly easy for them to

climb the corporate ladder, move
to the comfortable suburbs, and
forget it all.
But Stanford University is
itself a comfortable suburb, and
being a Stanford undergraduate
can be about as easy and
comfortable and secure an
existence as any that an
intellectually well-equipped young
person could come upon.
So I think Monro, if he could
have, would have addressed his
remarks to all of us now at
Stanford as well. I think he would
have quoted to us, as he did to the
graduating class, King's reflection
that 'The ultimate tragedy of
Birmingham was not the brutality
of the bad people, but the silence
of the good people."
If there were also a
commencement exercise for the
beginning of the school year,
Monro, I think, would plead for
us alf this year to read and think
about what is happening in the
world, to talk to each other about
what we stand for, to act on that
stand, and, above all, to not let it
be said of us here that good
people were silent.
