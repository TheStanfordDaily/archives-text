# Rowen Discusses Supply
## War May Boost U.S. Oil Prices 
### JOHN FREED 
Oil prices may rise rapidly and
unpredictably during the next decade
because the United States has no
alternative to Mideast oil, a business
school professor here warned
yesterday.
"Within the next few weeks there
could be really a quite severe energy
crisis," claimed Henry Rowen,
discussing the world energy situation
before 135 people in Jordan Hall.
Rowen said that gasoline prices as
high as $1 per gallon within a few
years are only "about a 10 percent
chance," but noted that it will take
years to develop inexpensive energy
sources that would relieve American
dependence on Arab oil.
"It will take time to develop tar
sands, shale oil, nuclear energy, and
Alaskan oil. In the meantime, oil
prices may rise rapidly," Rowen said.
More Offshore Oil
The former president of the Rand
Corp. said that increased use of
offshore oil will be necessary to
increase American oil independence in
the short term.
"[Within the next decade] we
should diversify as best we can the
sources of energy supplies, reduce the
impediments to energy production at
home . .. expand refineries, build
ports, and expand offshore oil and
Arctic oil drilling," he asserted.
Rowen cited the current
Arab-Israeli conflict as a warning to
the United States that its Mideast oil
supplies could be cut off without
notice. Because the United States has
given Israel military aid, the Arabs
could retaliate by refusing to sell oil to
the Americans.
Hence, the United States must find

a reliable, secure source of energy,
Rowen concluded.
Security Vs. Cost
"I believe the only prudent policy
is one that emphasizes both the
objectives of security of supply and of
low energy costs. In the short term
this is impossible. There is no way in

1973 that we can get security plus low
cost," Rowen argued.
Increases in crude oil costs would
not be passed on directly to the
consumer, because much of the cost of
gasoline and other refined oils results
from taxation. A 100 Dercent increase

tiNfcKUY - lhe energy crisis could become serious according to Henry Rowen
former president of the Rand Corp. Speaking here last night, Rowen cited the
possibility of increased use of offshore oil to offset dependence on foreign
sources in the near future and diversification of energy sources in the next ten
years.
