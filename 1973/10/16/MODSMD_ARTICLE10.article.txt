# Israelis Favor Negotiation
## Arab Attacks Force Israeli Defense

» Arthur Kubersky

Some students interviewed by
the Daily defaulted in taking a
strong moral position of the
current Middle-East conflict by
explaining, "I don't know
enough," "both sides are lying,"
and,"the Arabs are just trying to
regain the land they lost five years
ago." Bill Evers, not one to shrink
from position-taking subsequently
offered us a rationale for Arab
aggression with a "libertarian
theory of justice." The low level
of awareness of the situation in
the Middle-East, coupled with
seeming indifference to the moral
dimensions necessitates further
clarification.
Since the partition of Palestine
in 1948, Arab nations have
committed repeated acts of war
against the people of Israel. The
initial Arab attack on the fledgling
nation was repulsed in 1948, but
created a massive Arab refugee
population. During the 1950s
Egypt continued its aggression by

preventing Israeli passage through
the Suez canal and by promoting
Fedayeen raids in the Negev.
In 1956, Israel was again
forced to defend itself against
Egyptian militarism. Slow to learn
the lessons of the past, Col. Nasser
in 1967 again embarked on a war
path by blockading Israeli passage
through the Straits of Tiran. To
secure their future survival,
pending the establishment of a
negotiated peace, the Israelis
occupied the Sinai Desert, the
West Bank, and the Golan
Heights. Rejecting peace as a
solution to Middle East problems,
Egypt and Syria, with Soviet
backing, have once again
embarked on military conquest.
What is the intention of the
current Arab invasion? It is argued
by some Arab spokesman that
they merely seek to regain
territory which was lost during
the Six Days War. This would be
more believable if the Arab record

did not betray a pattern of
violence against Israel even when
they had possession of this
territory. If the Arab intention
had been peace they could have
gotten it a long time ago.
Israel repeatedly asked Arab
diplomats to negotiate a lasting
peace in the Middle East. Just a
few weeks ago, Abba Eban, the
Israeli foreign minister expressed
hopes for joint economic
development in the area. The
Arabs have rejected these
overtures on every occasion
because their goal has been and
remains the destruction of Israel.
The unwillingness of Arab
governments to arrange peace
with Israel is ostensibly predicated
on a deep humanitarian concern
for the Palestinian refugees. Yet,
ironically, it was the initial Arab
invasion of Israel which gave rise
to the present plight of the
refugees and prevented them from
living in peace with the Jews in

Israel.
Despite the flowery rhetoric
about justice, the display of
concern for refugees by Arab
governments, is nothing more
than a pretext for driving the
Israelis into the sea. If Arab
governments felt such deep
compassion for the refugees why
did they not use their oil revenues
to improve their standards of
living, and offer them the right to
become citizens? The answer is
fairly clear. The Arab refugee
problem has become a ploy for
Arab militarism.
This Arab militarism is
sometimes justified on grounds
that Israel is not a legitimate state.
Bill Evers implies that the Israelis
are not the real owners of the land
since they purchased it from,
"feudal landlords." If this is true,
one may also ask who the real
owners of the United States, of
Mexico, of Peru, of England, of
Russia .. . are. In these and many
other nations, few settlers indeed
had the decency to purchase land,
but took it instead by force.
Yet, not surprisingly, we hear
few people calling for the national
suicide of these nations because
the legitimacy of their origins may
be open to question. This exactly
is being advocated for Israel,
however, when it is stated that the
Palestinians should be "masters of
their own house." Without any
guarantees of peace, the return of
some 1,000,000 Palestinians
trained in hate and vengeance will
surely mean neither liberty nor
justice for Israel.

Mr. Evers replies: There are
several logical and factual errors in
Arthur Kubersky's column.
1. Kubersky speaks of an Arab
invasion of Israel as having created
the refugee problem. This is
historically inaccurate.
In April of 1948, there was
fighting between the loosely
co-ordinated Zionist military
organizations and some elements
of the native Palestinian Arab
population. The refugees fled in
the wake of this fighting.
The Arab countries which
bordered on Palestine generally
discouraged the Palestinian Arabs
from coming into these
neighboring countries. A few
weeks into May, when the
neighboring Arab countries
decided to attack Israel, the flow
of refugees from Palestine
temporarily halted because the
Palestinian Arabs ' hoped for
military success by the Arab
nations.
It was not the May invasion by
the neighboring Arab powers
which caused the refugee
problem, but rather the earlier
intercommunal fighting between
Zionists and Palestinian Arabs,
especially the terrorism practiced
by some Zionist armed groups like
the Irgun.
2. It is correctly pointed out
by Kubersky that other countries
besides Israel have been the site of
massive land theft. One should
not shrink from calling for land
reform in these countries as well.
There is, of course, the
problem of assembling the proof
to back up a claim.. Where it can
be shown what land was taken
from whom, it should be
returned. For instance,
Japanese-Americans were
dispossessed in California after
ftarl Harbor, in New Mexico certain
Mexican-Americans still have the
deeds to the land that was taken
from their ancestors, in Chile until
recently the feudal landholding
system set up by the conquering
Spaniards was still intact, and in
Palestine many Arabs fled in fear
or were expelled from their lands
In these and other situations,
justice in land titles can be
achieved through restitution of
the stolen land.

Mr. Evers replies: There are
several logical and factual errors in
Arthur Kubersky's column.
1. Kubersky speaks of an Arab
invasion of Israel as having created
the refugee problem. This is
historically inaccurate.
In April of 1948, there was
fighting between the loosely
co-ordinated Zionist military
organizations and some elements
of the native Palestinian Arab
population. The refugees fled in
the wake of this fighting.
The Arab countries which
bordered on Palestine generally
discouraged the Palestinian Arabs
from coming into these
neighboring countries. A few
weeks into May, when the
neighboring Arab countries
decided to attack Israel, the flow
of refugees from Palestine
temporarily halted because the
Palestinian Arabs ' hoped for
military success by the Arab
nations.
It was not the May invasion by
the neighboring Arab powers
which caused the refugee
problem, but rather the earlier
intercommunal fighting between
Zionists and Palestinian Arabs,
especially the terrorism practiced
by some Zionist armed groups like
the Irgun.
2. It is correctly pointed out
by Kubersky that other countries
besides Israel have been the site of
massive land theft. One should
not shrink from calling for land
reform in these countries as well.
There is, of course, the
problem of assembling the proof
to back up a claim.. Where it can
be shown what land was taken
from whom, it should be
returned. For instance,
Japanese-Americans were
dispossessed in California after
ftarl Harbor, in New Mexico certain
Mexican-Americans still have the
deeds to the land that was taken
from their ancestors, in Chile until
recently the feudal landholding
system set up by the conquering
Spaniards was still intact, and in
Palestine many Arabs fled in fear
or were expelled from their lands
In these and other situations,
justice in land titles can be
achieved through restitution of
the stolen land.

Some students interviewed by
the Daily defaulted in taking a
strong moral position of the
current Middle-East conflict by
explaining, "I don't know
enough," "both sides are lying,"
and,"the Arabs are just trying to
regain the land they lost five years
ago." Bill Evers, not one to shrink
from position-taking subsequently
offered us a rationale for Arab
aggression with a "libertarian
theory of justice." The low level
of awareness of the situation in
the Middle-East, coupled with
seeming indifference to the moral
dimensions necessitates further
clarification.
Since the partition of Palestine
in 1948, Arab nations have
committed repeated acts of war
against the people of Israel. The
initial Arab attack on the fledgling
nation was repulsed in 1948, but
created a massive Arab refugee
population. During the 1950s
Egypt continued its aggression by

preventing Israeli passage through
the Suez canal and by promoting
Fedayeen raids in the Negev.
In 1956, Israel was again
forced to defend itself against
Egyptian militarism. Slow to learn
the lessons of the past, Col. Nasser
in 1967 again embarked on a war
path by blockading Israeli passage
through the Straits of Tiran. To
secure their future survival,
pending the establishment of a
negotiated peace, the Israelis
occupied the Sinai Desert, the
West Bank, and the Golan
Heights. Rejecting peace as a
solution to Middle East problems,
Egypt and Syria, with Soviet
backing, have once again
embarked on military conquest.
What is the intention of the
current Arab invasion? It is argued
by some Arab spokesman that
they merely seek to regain
territory which was lost during
the Six Days War. This would be
more believable if the Arab record

did not betray a pattern of
violence against Israel even when
they had possession of this
territory. If the Arab intention
had been peace they could have

Mr. Evers replies: There are
several logical and factual errors in
Arthur Kubersky's column.
1. Kubersky speaks of an Arab
invasion of Israel as having created
the refugee problem. This is
historically inaccurate.
In April of 1948, there was
fighting between the loosely
co-ordinated Zionist military
organizations and some elements
of the native Palestinian Arab
population. The refugees fled in
the wake of this fighting.
The Arab countries which
bordered on Palestine generally
discouraged the Palestinian Arabs
from coming into these
neighboring countries. A few
weeks into May, when the
neighboring Arab countries
decided to attack Israel, the flow
of refugees from Palestine
temporarily halted because the
Palestinian Arabs ' hoped for
military success by the Arab
nations.
It was not the May invasion by
the neighboring Arab powers
which caused the refugee
problem, but rather the earlier
intercommunal fighting between
Zionists and Palestinian Arabs,
especially the terrorism practiced
by some Zionist armed groups like
the Irgun.
2. It is correctly pointed out
by Kubersky that other countries
besides Israel have been the site of
massive land theft. One should
not shrink from calling for land
reform in these countries as well.
There is, of course, the
problem of assembling the proof
to back up a claim.. Where it can
be shown what land was taken
from whom, it should be
returned. For instance,
Japanese-Americans were
dispossessed in California after
ftarl Harbor, in New Mexico certain
Mexican-Americans still have the
deeds to the land that was taken
from their ancestors, in Chile until
recently the feudal landholding
system set up by the conquering
Spaniards was still intact, and in
Palestine many Arabs fled in fear
or were expelled from their lands
In these and other situations,
justice in land titles can be
achieved through restitution of
the stolen land.

Some students interviewed by
the Daily defaulted in taking a
strong moral position of the
current Middle-East conflict by
explaining, "I don't know
enough," "both sides are lying,"
and,"the Arabs are just trying to
regain the land they lost five years
ago." Bill Evers, not one to shrink
from position-taking subsequently
offered us a rationale for Arab
aggression with a "libertarian
theory of justice." The low level
of awareness of the situation in
the Middle-East, coupled with
seeming indifference to the moral
dimensions necessitates further
clarification.
Since the partition of Palestine
in 1948, Arab nations have
committed repeated acts of war
against the people of Israel. The
initial Arab attack on the fledgling
nation was repulsed in 1948, but
created a massive Arab refugee
population. During the 1950s
Egypt continued its aggression by

preventing Israeli passage through
the Suez canal and by promoting
Fedayeen raids in the Negev.
In 1956, Israel was again
forced to defend itself against
Egyptian militarism. Slow to learn
the lessons of the past, Col. Nasser
in 1967 again embarked on a war
path by blockading Israeli passage
through the Straits of Tiran. To
secure their future survival,
pending the establishment of a
negotiated peace, the Israelis
occupied the Sinai Desert, the
West Bank, and the Golan
Heights. Rejecting peace as a
solution to Middle East problems,
Egypt and Syria, with Soviet
backing, have once again
embarked on military conquest.
What is the intention of the
current Arab invasion? It is argued
by some Arab spokesman that
they merely seek to regain
territory which was lost during
the Six Days War. This would be
more believable if the Arab record

did not betray a pattern of
violence against Israel even when
they had possession of this
territory. If the Arab intention
had been peace they could have
gotten it a long time ago.
Israel repeatedly asked Arab
diplomats to negotiate a lasting
peace in the Middle East. Just a
few weeks ago, Abba Eban, the
Israeli foreign minister expressed
hopes for joint economic
development in the area. The
Arabs have rejected these
overtures on every occasion
because their goal has been and
remains the destruction of Israel.
The unwillingness of Arab
governments to arrange peace
with Israel is ostensibly predicated
on a deep humanitarian concern
for the Palestinian refugees. Yet,
ironically, it was the initial Arab
invasion of Israel which gave rise
to the present plight of the
refugees and prevented them from
living in peace with the Jews in

Israel.
Despite the flowery rhetoric
about justice, the display of
concern for refugees by Arab
governments, is nothing more
than a pretext for driving the
Israelis into the sea. If Arab
governments felt such deep
compassion for the refugees why
did they not use their oil revenues
to improve their standards of
living, and offer them the right to
become citizens? The answer is
fairly clear. The Arab refugee
problem has become a ploy for
Arab militarism.
This Arab militarism is
sometimes justified on grounds
that Israel is not a legitimate state.
Bill Evers implies that the Israelis
are not the real owners of the land
since they purchased it from,
"feudal landlords." If this is true,
one may also ask who the real
owners of the United States, of
Mexico, of Peru, of England, of
Russia .. . are. In these and many
other nations, few settlers indeed
had the decency to purchase land,
but took it instead by force.
Yet, not surprisingly, we hear
few people calling for the national
suicide of these nations because
the legitimacy of their origins may
be open to question. This exactly
is being advocated for Israel,
however, when it is stated that the
Palestinians should be "masters of
their own house." Without any
guarantees of peace, the return of
some 1,000,000 Palestinians
trained in hate and vengeance will
surely mean neither liberty nor
justice for Israel.
