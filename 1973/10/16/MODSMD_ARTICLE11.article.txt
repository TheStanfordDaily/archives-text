Another Perspective
Editor:
The Middle East crisis is indeed
an unfortunate one, however
there are many facts that must be
put in their proper perspective.
Firstly, during the week of Oct. 1
to Oct. 5, the countries of Egypt
and Syria had been massing troops
along the borders near El Quneitra
(the Golan Heights) and near Port
Said (the Suez Canal) and
Ismailiya.
The Israeli military did not
respond as quickly as she could
have in the hopes that she could
avert any possible conflicts during
the week end of Yom Kippur, the
holiest of the Jewish holidays.
After the attempts to forestall the
growing conflict and after the
joint attack by Syria and Egypt
on the morning of Oct. 6, Israel
responded by sending 93,000
army regulars into combat.
Egypt and Syria have a total of
41 million people, Israel has three
million inhabitants. Egypt and
Syria have 380,000 regular
soldiers, Israel has 93,000. Egypt
and Syria have 3400 tanks. Israel
has 1700.
These figures do not include
the supplies of pilots and advisers
that Russia, India, Algeria, Libya,
and Saudi Arabia are giving these
two countries. The Arab states are
using napalm. Israel is at the
mercy of hypocritical world
opinion who condemned the
shooting down of a Libyian
airliner but not the killings of
athletes in Munich, nor the
shootings of people in Lod
Airport early last year.
The worst crime of the war is
the inability of the world to
remember. Was it not six years
ago that the Arabs attacked and
attempted to, in the words of
Nasser, "wipe the Israelis off the
map?" It was only two weeks ago
that Arab terrorists kidnapped
and attacked Jewish Soviet
immigrants leaving Russia for
Austria. It was only 30 years ago
that over six million Jews were
exterminated.
We, the Jews of the Stanford
Community, and the Jews of the
World, will not bow to the
inhumane morals of the Arab
world who lack spiritual decency
and respect for people.
The lies that are heard over the
radio of attacks on women and
children by Israelis are just that â€”
odious lies. Syrians have placed
ammunition dumps in schools,
hospitals, and consulates. War for
Israel is her fight for existence,

and her reaction to a world that is
unreconstructedly anti-semitic
because of the pressure that oil,
greed, and ignorance breeds.
The Arabs have never
suffered. A Jew, because of what
he has lived through, knows
suffering. The Arabs must be
taught a lesson this time and
know that no more blackmail,
terrorism, war, or massacres will
be tolerated. To Damascus! To
Cairo! NEVER AGAIN!

Superficial Reactions
Editor:
I am quite disappointed with
the apparent superficiality of
many Stanford students as
reflected in the Daily article on
the Middle East situation. I
wonder if the freshman who
supported Israel because it was
the "underdog" would use the
same logic in supporting Cuba if it
attacked the United States. A
graduate student correctly stated
that Israel "is beginning to look
more militarily and economically
imperialistic." But appearances
often have little to do with what
is indeed the case.
A country that was threatened
with being "driven into the sea"
must rely on its defenses. Many
students agreed that Israel should
give up all or much of the Sinai
Peninsula and the Golan Heights.
To maintain these areas is a great
burden on Israel, both
economically and politically. Her
apparent obstinacy arises from her
need for a buffer zone to reduce
the effect of attacks like the
present one.
A problem definitely exists
with Palestinian refugees, but to
state that Israel's "actions steam
from arrogance and fascism" is to
exhibit a shallow understanding of
the issues that crate the problem,
and a faulty view of the world
political spectrum. Upon
examining the choices open to the
Arab inhabitants of Israeli land,
one sees that their lot is not at all
as bad as propaganda would make
it seem. (Space limitations prevent
my treating the subject in depth
here.)
I do not in the least intend to
attack those who were
interviewed. Quite possibly the
necessities of newspaper reporting
make it difficult to avoid taking

remarks out of context. For
example, in the same issue of the
Daily the headline reads "Israeli
Jets Attack Port Said; Egyptians
Claim Civilians Hurt." The
continuation of the story on the
last page is entitled "Israelis
Attack Port; Many Civilians
Hurt," an entirely different
matter, considering that none of
the claims had been substantiated.
This latter is certainly not a
documented analysis of the issues.
It is a call for an in-depth
examination of facts before
conclusions are reached. Perhaps
those who want the Israelis to
turn over the occupied territories
would also like to see them fight
for their lives in the streets of Tel
Aviv.

Inconsistent Theory
Editor:
A new theory of justice.
Libertarian Evers writes [Daily,
Oct. 10]: "According to the
libertarian theory of justice, a
feudal landlord is not the
legitimate owner of the land;
instead, the land belongs to his
bondsman who has been
homesteading it. Thus the Zionist
settlers obtained a clear and just
title only in cases in which
previously unowned land was
homesteaded or in which land was
bought from native Palestinians."
Well then, Mr. Evers should
move out from wherever he lives.
Surely the people from whom he
bought or rents are not
homesteaders of previously
unowned land. He should also
return his car and his bicycle to
their rightful owners. He may
have bought them from dealers or
previous owners, but that does
not count: He should have bought
them from the serfs who worked
on them.
And why does he apply his
cute theory to Zionists and not to
American landowners?
If Mr. Evers' theory of justice
is correct he is a thief. If it is not
correct he is a fool or a
demagogue.
H.O. Fuchs
Professor Emeritus
Mr. Evers Replies: The legal
aspects of the libertarian theory
of justice on stolen goods can be
illustrated with the example of a
stolen coat. A steak B's coat. If B

is still alive and the coat is found,
in the possession of A or of some
party C, who has received the coat
as a donation or as a purchase
from A or at some futher remove,
then B is entitled to his coat.
If B is dead, his heirs are
entitled to B's coat. If B is dead
and heirless and the coat is found
in A s possession, the coat should
be taken from him since he
committed the crime and awarded
on a "finders, keepers" basis. If B
is dead and heirless and the coat is
found in possession of C, who
bought it or received it as a gift,
then that person should keep it,
being already in a "finders,
keepers" position. I would call
upon those who have written in to
the Daily and criticized the
libertarian theory of justice to
offer their own alternative theory
of justice to the readers for
consideration.
I am puzzled by the several
defenses of the legitimacy of
feudalism that have been sent in
to the Daily. I would like to press
these feudalists to the logical
conclusion of their position. If a
person purchases a slave from
someone, is the slaveholder
entitled to keep the slave?
Arab Aggression
Editor:
In the Daily article on student
opinions of the Mideast war, it
seems that a large number of
students believe that Israel should
have withdrawn from the
territories occupied in the '67
war. Such an opinion can only
rest on a misunderstanding of the
facts.
Ever since the '67 war, Israel
has repeatedly announced its
desire to return all of the captured
territories except for those that
are absolutely necessary for
Israel's security. Israel's condition
was only this: that the return be
part of a settlement directly
negotiated between Israel and the
Arab states.
The Arabs, however, have
demanded that these territories be
returned before any negotiations
could begin. To give in to this
demand would leave Israel in no
position whatever to obtain the
guarantees of national security
which are Israel's main desire.
To attempt to take by force
that which you were unwilling to
try to get by negotiation can only
be considered aggression.
