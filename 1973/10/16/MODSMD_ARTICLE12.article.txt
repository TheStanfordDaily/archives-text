# First Observatory Project
## Comet Interest Flares 
### 
When a bright comet flashes across the sky this
winter, Stanford students at the new undergraduate
observatory will be among those watching around
the world.
Ever since Lubos Kohoutec, a German
astronomer, discovered the comet on March 7 of
this year, professional and amateur skywatchers
alike have been making preparations. They have
rarely had this much time to gather special
equipment and plan for the coming event. They
have reason to be excited: Kohoutec is expected to
be the brightest comet seen in recent years (an
estimated -5 to -10 on a magnitude scale which rates
Venus at -4 and a full moon at -12.5).
Seniors Michael Kast and Nicholas Suntzeff, the
originators and principal builders of the Stanford
Observatory, and physics grad Doug Post all
recently returned from "Operation Kohoutec
Planning Workshop," a conference held at the
University of New Mexico.
The three are now involved in planning the role
of Stanford facilities in the national effort to study
the comet. Operation Kohoutec is the first project
undertaken by the new observatory since its
dedication last Tuesday.
Kast and Huntzeff are coordinating a project
with Senior Research Associate H. Taylor Howard
to study solar wind, a continuous stream of atomic
particles ejected by the sun into space. Since solar
wind is most easily examined when comets are
nearest the earth, Howard wants to confirm findings
gathered by Stanford's radio telescope and Pioneer
8 through the visual observations of the
observatory's 16 inch telescope.
Research will also examine the physical makeup

of comets. The most popular current theory
suggests that comets are condensed gas clouds
orbiting around the sun.
Doug Post, instructor of Astronomy 102 Lab,
says that the students in his new course will have
individual projects to do when Kohoutec appears.
At their disposal will be the brand-new telescope,
complete photographic facilities and other
equipment.
"The observatory is all student from the ground
up," said Post. "It was built with almost no
professional help. It will be run and cared for in the
same way — by students. We don't have the money
for anything else."
Before the new equipment was installed,
undergraduates were forced to rely on the smaller
telescopes of the Physical Sciences Department.
These telescopes were often not available for use,
Post said.
Interest in undergraduate astronomy has picked
up since then. Last spring, 40 students competed for
18 places in Post's class this fall. Judging from the
estimated 200 people who showed up for the
observatory's open house last Tuesday, Post expects
a far greater number of applicants next quarter.
A student in the astronomy lab is trained in the
use of the telescope, camera and other equipment.
For his class project, he will have at least eight
viewing sessions per quarter. For longer projects
(such as Kohoutec), a student can continue taking
the course through winter and spring quarters.
Photographic survey of the planets, nebulae and
galaxies, and measurement of the speed of light
using Jupiter's moons are a few of the projects that
Post hopes his students will work on in the future.

For his class project, he will have at least eight
viewing sessions per quarter. For longer projects
(such as Kohoutec), a student can continue taking
the course through winter and spring quarters.
Photographic survey of the planets, nebulae and
galaxies, and measurement of the speed of light
using Jupiter's moons are a few of the projects that
Post hopes his students will work on in the future.

STANFORD OBSERVATORY — Stanford students will be able to
watch the progress of the Kohoutec comet from the new
undergraduate observatory. The observatory, designed and built by
Seniors Michael Kast and Nicholas Suntzeff, will also be manned by
students.
When a bright comet flashes across the sky this
winter, Stanford students at the new undergraduate
observatory will be among those watching around
the world.
Ever since Lubos Kohoutec, a German
astronomer, discovered the comet on March 7 of
this year, professional and amateur skywatchers
alike have been making preparations. They have
rarely had this much time to gather special
equipment and plan for the coming event. They
have reason to be excited: Kohoutec is expected to
be the brightest comet seen in recent years (an
estimated -5 to -10 on a magnitude scale which rates
Venus at -4 and a full moon at -12.5).
Seniors Michael Kast and Nicholas Suntzeff, the
originators and principal builders of the Stanford
Observatory, and physics grad Doug Post all
recently returned from "Operation Kohoutec
Planning Workshop," a conference held at the
University of New Mexico.
The three are now involved in planning the role
of Stanford facilities in the national effort to study
the comet. Operation Kohoutec is the first project
undertaken by the new observatory since its
dedication last Tuesday.
Kast and Huntzeff are coordinating a project
with Senior Research Associate H. Taylor Howard
to study solar wind, a continuous stream of atomic
particles ejected by the sun into space. Since solar
wind is most easily examined when comets are
nearest the earth, Howard wants to confirm findings
gathered by Stanford's radio telescope and Pioneer
8 through the visual observations of the
observatory's 16 inch telescope.
Research will also examine the physical makeup

of comets. The most popular current theory
suggests that comets are condensed gas clouds
orbiting around the sun.
Doug Post, instructor of Astronomy 102 Lab,
says that the students in his new course will have
individual projects to do when Kohoutec appears.
At their disposal will be the brand-new telescope,
complete photographic facilities and other
equipment.
"The observatory is all student from the ground
up," said Post. "It was built with almost no
professional help. It will be run and cared for in the
same way — by students. We don't have the money
for anything else."
Before the new equipment was installed,
undergraduates were forced to rely on the smaller
telescopes of the Physical Sciences Department.
These telescopes were often not available for use,
Post said.
Interest in undergraduate astronomy has picked
up since then. Last spring, 40 students competed for
18 places in Post's class this fall. Judging from the
estimated 200 people who showed up for the
observatory's open house last Tuesday, Post expects
a far greater number of applicants next quarter.

use of the telescope, camera and other equipment.
