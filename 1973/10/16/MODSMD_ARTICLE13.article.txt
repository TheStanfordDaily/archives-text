# Marchers Protest Allende Overthrow
## 
### EZRA GREENHOUSE 
On a hot Saturday afternoon
given over to the World Series and
college football, about 200
people, many of them Stanford
students, marched on unoccupied
ITT offices in San Jose to
denounce alleged CIA and ITT
involvement in the recent Chilean
coup.
Organized by the ad hoc San
Jose Committee to Preserve
Democracy in Chile, the protest
climaxed a week of activities
sponsored by Concerned Latin
American Scholars at Stanford
(CLASS).
The CLASS presentation, an
expression of sympathy and
international solidarity with Chile,
commenced with a film program
Monday, Oct. 8, and concluded
last night with a Chile colloquium
for Bay Area faculty in Tresidder
Union. Encompassing the social
and cultural aspects of the
Allende revolutionary movement
as well as the political
ramifications of the coup, the
program attemped to distill and
capture the essence of a
portentuous, if endangered,
movement in Latin America. It
was a gesture of acknowledgement

as well as of support.
Documentary Films
Political Science Prof. Richard
Fagen, who recently returned
from Chile, included in his
opening night introduction to two
documentary films a dedication to
Frank Teruggi, an American killed
in the wake of the coup.
Eulogizing the slain student
before a group of about 150 in
Cubberley Auditorium, Fagen
hailed Teruggi's journalistic
efforts to counter "unremitting
U.S. hostility to the Chilean
experiment."
Stressing the need for
collective action, Fagen spoke of
the recent Senate amendment to
the Foreign Aid Bill, which calls
for the withholding of military
and ecnomic aid to the junta until
the United States is assured that
human rights are being protected.
He asked that students "sensitize
Congress to the depth of public
opinion" by urging the adoption
of the amendment into law.
Change of Focus
"Pablo Neruda and Chile"
provided a change of pace and
focus. English Prof. John
Felstiner, integrating Chilean folk
songs and poetry into his
presentation before 40 students
Wednesday afternoon in Bolivar
House, described poet Neruda's
development as an artist and
politician â€” the vision and
sensitivity of the former evolving
into the dedication and
perseverence of the latter.
Other highlights of the week
were a Wednesday evening of
satire and speeches concerning
Chile and the farmworkers given
by the Los Topos Theater Group,
and a Thursday night slide show
in Tresidder Union on the Chilean
workers' movement as seen
through the eyes of two returning
American students from San
Francisco. Sunday Memorial
services for Allende, Neruda, and
Teruggi were held in several area
churches, including Memorial
Church.
Beyond the immediate
Stanford campaigns to petition
Congress and raise funds for
Chilean refugees, CLASS member
Prof. Fagen looks to continuing
"public education" as essential in
keeping Chile in the consciousness
of Americans.
Perhaps, as one student said
resignedly opening night, "The
people who need to be reached
aren't here." CLASS is still trying
to reach them.
