# U.S. Volunteers To Man Farms
## 
### 
TEL AVIV (AP)—Thousands
of Americans who have
volunteered to go to Israel to help
the war effort will be picking fruit
instead of fighting the Arabs when
they arrive, Israeli officials say.
Reprots by Israeli
correspondents in the United
States say 30,000 Americans have
volunteered to go to Israel. Most
have offered to fill the jobs of
Israeli reservists called to the
front.
"Volunteers will not be
allowed to join the army, even to
serve in the rear," an Israeli
military spokesman said. "As a
principle, we never take
volunteers into the army."
This would include American
Vietnam war veterans if any
showed up, he said. Reports said a
group of such veterans was
heading for Israel under contract
with the Israeli government.
Israeli officials deny the reports.
"There is no involvement in
the fighting by U.S. forces or
personnel," a spokesman for the
U.S. embassy in Israel said
Sunday, after Syria claimed
American involvement in a
bombing raid on Damascus.
Most of the American
volunteers will be shuttled to
kibbutz collective farms, whose
ranks of field workers have been

drafted for the war, officials said.
The kibbutz movement union,
a loose organization for the more
than 300 kibbutzim, said 30,000
volunteers from all countries had
offered to work on the farms for
the autumn harvest. Many had
scheduled trips before the war
broke out on Oct. 6.
So far, few volunteers have
arrived. Nearly every commercial
plane landing in Israel has been
filled with returning Israelis, many
of them soldiers rejoining their
units.
Israel's front-line soldiers
include some men holding dual
Israeli-American citizenship and
immigrants who abandoned their
American citizenship when they
arrived in Israel.
"I came soon after the 1967
war," said a former Chicago
resident and a former Vietnam
war veteran, who declined to give
his name. "I tried to get here to
fight then but the State
Department wouldn't let us go."
During the current war, he was
working as a medic at a base near
the Suez Canal.
