Now that the roadway to the Post Office parking lot has been
rehabilitated, what can be done about replacing the bike ramp to the
rear of the Post Office? I would strongly urge that a ramp for cyclists
be built, but not at the same location as was previously used, due to a
hazardous bike-auto conflict at the mouth of the lot. A more sensible
spot would be at the end of the sidewalk that runs behind the
bookstore and immediately next to the parking lot. —R.E.C. & M.A.
Roads and Grounds Manager Perry Hackett spoke with one of the
two students who proposed the new location for a bike ramp, and he
has said that the ramp will probably be finished by the end of the
week.
The ramp will lead directly to the new portion of the sidewalk,
halfway between the Bookstore and the Post Office. It will be about
five feet wide, and will slope into the parking lot in such a way that
bicycle riders won't have to swing out to go up the ramp.
Say, how do those urinals in Tresidder work, anyhow? They seem
to follow some asynchronous, non-repeating flush pattern
undecipherable by logic as we know it. The result is that some retain a
familiar hue for hours. —1.A.C., Y.
The urinals in Tresidder are hooked up to a timing device that
flushes them every 45 seconds to one minute, said Tresidder's
Building Engineer Ollie Slayton.
He mentioned that all the urinals don't flush at once because that
would lower the water pressure too much. This might be what makes
the flush pattern seem asynchronous — different urinals flushing at
intervals of 45 seconds to a minute.
I suppose that if one stayed in the men's bathroom long enough a
pattern might emerge, but then there must be better things to do on
campus.
Slayton said that as far as he knows there is nothing wrong, but he
is concerned about problems that might crop up so if indeed the
urinals "retain a familiar hue for hours," let him know about it.
