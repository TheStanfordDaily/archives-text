# 'The Mother' Evokes Revolutionary Thought
## Mime Troupe Confronts Issues 
### TERRI YAVITZ 
The San Francisco Mime
Troupe, performed Bertolt
Brecht's controversial play, The
Mother for a near-capacity
audience in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium last Saturday evening.
The Mother is a "learning"
play and its content explores
criticisms of capitalism, the

process of revolutionary action,
and the possibilities for
establishing a Marxist society.
It is difficult to assert whether
or not the Troupe succeeded in
transmitting their convictions to
the audience. The
thought-provoking play discusses
capitalistic inadequacies and
pro-Marxist ideas beginning with

Czarist Russia in the early 1900s.
It is based on the miserable
treatment of the peasants and
views the situation through the
mother's thoughts and actions.
She accepts low wages in the first
scene insisting that "Nothing
helps. I see nothing to be done."
But she progresses to a point
where she takes part in her son's
revolutionary projects by passing
out leaflets to encourage the
worker's cooperation in striking
for better wages. (She naively
believes the police would never do
anything to prevent them from
peacefully demonstrating.) She
becomes more deeply involved in
the revolutionary movement as
the play progresses, and finds
herself singing "Communism is
Good" in the sixth of 14 scenes.
Parallels Nixon
The mother returns in the
second half to live with a
"neutral" teacher for her own
safekeeping. He blends his
philosophies into the remainder of
the play by repetitiously
confirming that the Americans are
the true revolutionists of all time.
But then, his sister (another
comrade) informs us to take him
lightly for he's a "lousy politician,
but has a good heart." (It's
interesting to note that his speech
pattern parallels that of President
Nixon.)
The mother reaches a climatic
point in her career as she is
confronted in a religious debate,
espousing that "the fate of man is
man" and the idea is "not to fear
death so much, but rather the
inadequate life."
Revolutionary Action
Putting her words into
immediate action, Anya
demonstrates her leadership
potential in a final rally, as she
secures a red flag from a dying
comrade. She shouts, "The Czars
are murderers," and "Victims of
today will be the victors of
tomorrow and never is changed
into today." Thus, we see the
makings of a fine revolutionary
and a women's libber, to boot.
The Mime Troupe chose to
perform this play because they
believe it relates to the present
labor/management crisis in
America. Additional issues
including welfare, childcare,
amnesty, the media and Agnew
were briefly presented. A special
emphasis was placed in the form
of a request for the audience to
support the Farm Workers Union

and not to recognize the newly
established military regime in
Chile.
The troupe members came
fully prepared with their own
three-piece stage band, a portable
printing press, and a backdrop of
a steel mill; simple, but effective.
Multiple Characters
The actors played multiple
character roles through the use of
comical masks and frequent quick
change of costumes. The variety
of dialogue, song, and pantomime
was exciting and enhanced the
swift and smooth production.
Aesthetically, the Mime
Troupe is deserving of an
excellent appraisal. However, the
effectiveness of their
propagandizing is open to
question.
