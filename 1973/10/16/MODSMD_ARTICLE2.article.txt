# Agnew Address Praises Ford

### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” Spiro T. Agnew bade farewell
to public life Monday night with praise for vice
president-designate Gerald R. Ford and a call for political
and judicial reforms as a result of "my nightmare come
true."
Agnew, who resigned Wednesday and did not contest a
charge of federal income tax evasion, vowed that his final
moments on the national stage would not be spent in "a
paroxysm of bitterness."
And, while the words were emotional, his
nationally-televised farewell address was delivered in calm,
unimpassioned tones.
Agnew repeated his denial of bribery and extortion
accusations, and noted that his tax conviction stemmed
from a plea of no contest, not a guilty plea. He was fined
$10,000 and sentenced to three years of unsupervised
probation.
Agnew departed with words of praise for President
Nixon, who had personally approved major decisions
made by government prosecutors in the bargain that led
to his resignation and conviction on the one tax charge.
He said he had been proud to serve 57 months with "a
great President" who had advanced the cause of world
peace.
Agnew said that despite his personal sorrow, he sees
only good ahead for the nation.
Agnew said Nixon made "a wise nomination" in
choosing Ford to succeed him as vice president.
The nomination of Ford, now House Republican
leader, has been sent to Congress, which is expected to
confirm the choice.

"He'll make an excellent vice president and he is
clearly qualified to undertake the highest office should
the occasion require," Agnew said.
Agnew complained that leaked accounts of the federal
criminal investigation into his activities as governor of
Maryland and as vice president had prejudiced his civil
rights and put him in an impossible situation.
He said he had been confident that millions of
Americans supported him in his time of trouble.
"However, after hard deliberation and much prayer, I
concluded several days ago that the public interest and the
interest of those who mean the most to me would best be
served by my stepping down," he said.
He thanked President Nixon for handling his case with
strength and compassion, and denied that their meetings
on the accusations against him were vitriolic or
unfriendly.
Agnew said he had once considered resigning his office
and fighting the charges in court, but decided, with the
advice of his lawyers, that it would be impossible to get a
fair trial that way.
Agnew said he hopes the trauma of his case will "form
the crucible out of which a new system of campaign
financing is forged," to avoid even the appearance of
wrongdoing by public officials in raising political funds.
Agnew urged an overhaul of political finance laws, to
provide public financing for every candidate for office.
"The government at Washington does live, it lives in
the pages of our Constitution and in the hearts of
citizens," the resigned vice president said. "Thank you,
goodnight and farewell."
