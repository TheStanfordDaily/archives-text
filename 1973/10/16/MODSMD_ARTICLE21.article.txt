# B.B. King, Gladys Knight Do It Right
## 
### KEITH COPELAND 
"Ladies and gentlemen, the
Circle Star Theater is proud to
present the 8.8. King, Gladys
Knight Show. . .." The lights dim
and the same voice in a more
subdued tone announces, "Sonny
Freeman and the Unusuals." The
crowd snickers at the name as the
eight member, predominantly
black group takes its place.
The Unusuals immediately
rebound from the reaction as the
stage starts to revolved and their
funky, low-profile, jazz starts to
relax the two-thirds capacity
audience. The band picks up the
tempo a bit as their baritone
player moves to the microphone
and says, "Ladies and
gentlemen ... , The Chairman of
the Board, The Crowned King of
the Blues, Mr. 8.8. KING!"
The crowd applauds politely as
8.8. King strides down the ramp,
hands clasped as if in prayer, to
the cylindrical stage. Scattered
shouts of encouragement come
from the crowd as King begins,
"Everday I Have the Blues."
More shouts come from the
audience as 8.8. shows how he
earned his title, "King of the
Blues." Those CBM's
(Conscientious Blues Men) in our
readership already know how the
"Man from Mississippi" struggled
for some 25 years playing in
obscure places to make it to the
tOD.
Next, King overwhelmed the

audience with "I've Been Lonely
Ever Since the Day We Met," and
"Life Ain't Nothin' But The
Blues." The crowd ate up every
word as King rendered feeling as
no one else could.
King followed in rapid
succession with a group of songs
that included "Cryin' Won't Help
You Baby," "I'm Tired of
Sneakin' Around With You," "I'm
A Poor Man," "Ain't Nobody's
Business But My Own," and"I
Need My Baby." King
charismaticly induced the
audience into a clapping-guitar
dual which ended with a pleasant
intertwining of both.
King, showing his adaptability,
put a new string on his guitar as
he introduced the Unusuals.
Nearing the end of his portion of
the show, he gave the crowd a
chuckle with a slip of the tongue,
by referring to Gladys Knight's
group as, "Glady Knight and the
Pimps."
Up Tempo
Keeping up the tempo, 8.8.
ended with "The Thrill is Gone,"
and "Someone Who Really
Cares."
An hour of the best blues this
reviewer has heard since the last
time he had seen 8.8. King, had
just ended. The crowd stood and
applauded in reverence as "The
Man from Mississippi" exited.
The audience, wondering how
Gladys Knight could top 8.8.
King's performance, sat back and

watched as Knight's 17-piece
orchestra took its place. The
introduction was a nicely arranged
medley of some of the Pips'
greatest hits.
Choreographed Entrance
Knight entered the theater
singing as she came down the
ramp to center stage. The
immaculately groomed,
high-heeled, uniformed Pips
followed quickly in a neatly
choreographed dash on stage.
The fast paced,
make-you-wanna-dance music,
filled the room as Ms. Knight's
melodic tones were complimented
by a dazzling array of fancy
footwork by the Pips.
The Pips, after accompanying
Knight in an emotion-filled
version of "Let Me Take You
Where Peaceful Waters Flow," and
an old hit entitled "Friendship
Train," left Knight alone on stage.
In a most convincing style, she
rendered the most moving version
ever heard by this reviewer of the
Kris Kristofferson work, "Help
Me Make It Through The Night."
Coming of Age
It became apparent to this
reviewer that Ms. Knight has finally
come of age. She is not longer the
inexperienced Gladys Knight who
recorded "Whistle My Love,"
back in Detroit in 1955. She has
become an extremely
professional, talented, and
seasoned performer.
The Pips returned to the stage

to trip the light fantastic as they
and Knight sang, "Daddy Could
Swear (I Declare,) and "Midnight
Train to Georgia."
After some amusing chatter
and playfulness on stage led by
"Bubba" (one of the Pips), the
group ended the concert with
"Neither One of Us" and"I Heard
It Through The Grapevine."
Again, the receptive crowd
stood and applauded. The ecstatic
enthusiasm of the ovation
provided a fitting nightcap for a
memorable evening of blues and
soul music.

and "Someone Who Really
Cares."
An hour of the best blues this
reviewer has heard since the last
time he had seen 8.8. King, had
just ended. The crowd stood and
applauded in reverence as "The
Man from Mississippi" exited.
The audience, wondering how
Gladys Knight could top 8.8.
King's performance, sat back and

watched as Knight's 17-piece
orchestra took its place. The
introduction was a nicely arranged
medley of some of the Pips'
greatest hits.
Choreographed Entrance
Knight entered the theater
singing as she came down the
ramp to center stage. The
immaculately groomed,
high-heeled, uniformed Pips
followed quickly in a neatly
choreographed dash on stage.
The fast paced,
make-you-wanna-dance music,
filled the room as Ms. Knight's
melodic tones were complimented
by a dazzling array of fancy
footwork by the Pips.
The Pips, after accompanying
Knight in an emotion-filled
version of "Let Me Take You
Where Peaceful Waters Flow," and
an old hit entitled "Friendship
Train," left Knight alone on stage.
In a most convincing style, she
rendered the most moving version
ever heard by this reviewer of the
Kris Kristofferson work, "Help
Me Make It Through The Night."
Coming of Age
It became apparent to this
reviewer that Ms. Knight has finally
come of age. She is not longer the
inexperienced Gladys Knight who
recorded "Whistle My Love,"
back in Detroit in 1955. She has
become an extremely
professional, talented, and
seasoned performer.
The Pips returned to the stage

to trip the light fantastic as they
and Knight sang, "Daddy Could
Swear (I Declare,) and "Midnight
Train to Georgia."
After some amusing chatter
and playfulness on stage led by
"Bubba" (one of the Pips), the
group ended the concert with
"Neither One of Us" and"I Heard
It Through The Grapevine."
Again, the receptive crowd
stood and applauded. The ecstatic
enthusiasm of the ovation
provided a fitting nightcap for a
memorable evening of blues and
soul music.

VIVA LA HUELGA—A member of the San Francisco Mime Troupe exemplifies the group's political
orientation by waving a flag in support of the farmworkers' struggle. The mime troupe presented Bertolt
Brecht's "The Mother" here last weekend.
"Ladies and gentlemen, the
Circle Star Theater is proud to
present the 8.8. King, Gladys
Knight Show. . .." The lights dim
and the same voice in a more
subdued tone announces, "Sonny
Freeman and the Unusuals." The
crowd snickers at the name as the
eight member, predominantly
black group takes its place.
The Unusuals immediately
rebound from the reaction as the
stage starts to revolved and their
funky, low-profile, jazz starts to
relax the two-thirds capacity
audience. The band picks up the
tempo a bit as their baritone
player moves to the microphone
and says, "Ladies and
gentlemen ... , The Chairman of
the Board, The Crowned King of
the Blues, Mr. 8.8. KING!"
The crowd applauds politely as
8.8. King strides down the ramp,
hands clasped as if in prayer, to
the cylindrical stage. Scattered
shouts of encouragement come
from the crowd as King begins,
"Everday I Have the Blues."
More shouts come from the
audience as 8.8. shows how he
earned his title, "King of the
Blues." Those CBM's
(Conscientious Blues Men) in our
readership already know how the
"Man from Mississippi" struggled
for some 25 years playing in
obscure places to make it to the
tOD.
Next, King overwhelmed the

audience with "I've Been Lonely
Ever Since the Day We Met," and
"Life Ain't Nothin' But The
Blues." The crowd ate up every
word as King rendered feeling as
no one else could.
King followed in rapid
succession with a group of songs
that included "Cryin' Won't Help
You Baby," "I'm Tired of
Sneakin' Around With You," "I'm
A Poor Man," "Ain't Nobody's
Business But My Own," and"I
Need My Baby." King
charismaticly induced the
audience into a clapping-guitar
dual which ended with a pleasant
intertwining of both.
King, showing his adaptability,
put a new string on his guitar as
he introduced the Unusuals.
Nearing the end of his portion of
the show, he gave the crowd a
chuckle with a slip of the tongue,
by referring to Gladys Knight's
group as, "Glady Knight and the
Pimps."

"Ladies and gentlemen, the
Circle Star Theater is proud to
present the 8.8. King, Gladys
Knight Show. . .." The lights dim
and the same voice in a more
subdued tone announces, "Sonny
Freeman and the Unusuals." The
crowd snickers at the name as the
eight member, predominantly
black group takes its place.
The Unusuals immediately
rebound from the reaction as the
stage starts to revolved and their
funky, low-profile, jazz starts to
relax the two-thirds capacity
audience. The band picks up the
tempo a bit as their baritone
player moves to the microphone
and says, "Ladies and
gentlemen ... , The Chairman of
the Board, The Crowned King of
the Blues, Mr. 8.8. KING!"
The crowd applauds politely as
8.8. King strides down the ramp,
hands clasped as if in prayer, to
the cylindrical stage. Scattered
shouts of encouragement come
from the crowd as King begins,
"Everday I Have the Blues."
More shouts come from the
audience as 8.8. shows how he
earned his title, "King of the
Blues." Those CBM's
(Conscientious Blues Men) in our
readership already know how the
"Man from Mississippi" struggled
for some 25 years playing in
obscure places to make it to the
tOD.
Next, King overwhelmed the

audience with "I've Been Lonely
Ever Since the Day We Met," and
"Life Ain't Nothin' But The
Blues." The crowd ate up every
word as King rendered feeling as
no one else could.
King followed in rapid
succession with a group of songs
that included "Cryin' Won't Help
You Baby," "I'm Tired of
Sneakin' Around With You," "I'm
A Poor Man," "Ain't Nobody's
Business But My Own," and"I
Need My Baby." King
charismaticly induced the
audience into a clapping-guitar
dual which ended with a pleasant
intertwining of both.
King, showing his adaptability,
put a new string on his guitar as
he introduced the Unusuals.
Nearing the end of his portion of
the show, he gave the crowd a
chuckle with a slip of the tongue,
by referring to Gladys Knight's
group as, "Glady Knight and the
Pimps."
Up Tempo
Keeping up the tempo, 8.8.
ended with "The Thrill is Gone,"
and "Someone Who Really
Cares."
An hour of the best blues this
reviewer has heard since the last
time he had seen 8.8. King, had
just ended. The crowd stood and
applauded in reverence as "The
Man from Mississippi" exited.
The audience, wondering how
Gladys Knight could top 8.8.
King's performance, sat back and

watched as Knight's 17-piece
orchestra took its place. The
introduction was a nicely arranged
medley of some of the Pips'
greatest hits.
Choreographed Entrance
Knight entered the theater
singing as she came down the
ramp to center stage. The
immaculately groomed,
high-heeled, uniformed Pips
followed quickly in a neatly
choreographed dash on stage.
The fast paced,
make-you-wanna-dance music,
filled the room as Ms. Knight's
melodic tones were complimented
by a dazzling array of fancy
footwork by the Pips.
The Pips, after accompanying
Knight in an emotion-filled
version of "Let Me Take You
Where Peaceful Waters Flow," and
an old hit entitled "Friendship
Train," left Knight alone on stage.
In a most convincing style, she
rendered the most moving version
ever heard by this reviewer of the
Kris Kristofferson work, "Help
Me Make It Through The Night."
Coming of Age
It became apparent to this
reviewer that Ms. Knight has finally
come of age. She is not longer the
inexperienced Gladys Knight who
recorded "Whistle My Love,"
back in Detroit in 1955. She has
become an extremely
professional, talented, and
seasoned performer.
The Pips returned to the stage

to trip the light fantastic as they
and Knight sang, "Daddy Could
Swear (I Declare,) and "Midnight
Train to Georgia."
After some amusing chatter
and playfulness on stage led by
"Bubba" (one of the Pips), the
group ended the concert with
"Neither One of Us" and"I Heard
It Through The Grapevine."
Again, the receptive crowd
stood and applauded. The ecstatic
enthusiasm of the ovation
provided a fitting nightcap for a
memorable evening of blues and
soul music.
