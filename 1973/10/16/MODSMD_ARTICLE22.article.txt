Drastic Auto Cutbacks Ordered
LOS ANGELES — The Environmental Protection
Agency yesterday ordered drastic restrictions on
motor vehicle operations in five California areas to
purge the air of pollution.
But the controls won't be as extreme, at least for
the time being, as originally proposed.
The California areas affected are Los Angeles,
San Francisco, San Diego, the Sacramento Valley
and the San Joaquin Valley.
The clean air program was announced at news
conferences by EPA administrator Russell E. Train
in Washington and regional EPA administrator Paul
de Falco in Los Angeles.
Compliance with federal clean air standards by
California was extended from May 31, 1975 to
1977.
To meet these regulations, Los Angeles would
have to eliminate its vehicle travel completely, San
Francisco would have to reduce it by 97 percent,
Sacramento by 59 percent, San Diego by 53 percent
and the San Joaquin Valley by 39 percent.
Train called these cutbacks unrealistic and said
Congress would be asked to provide relief.
EPA said gasoline rationing would be resorted to
only as a last resort. But unless Congress eases the
deadline, Los Angeles would face a 57 percent
reduction in its gasoline and diesel supplies for the
summer months of 1977; San Francisco 65 percent;
Sacramento 37 percent; San Diego 25.8 percent,
and the San Joaquin Valley 26 percent.
LBJ Feared Phone Tap
WASHINGTON — The late President Lyndon B.
Johnson confided during his White House tenure
that he believed "that even his phone was tapped,"
Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas said
Monday.
Douglas, in an attack on what he called the
"dirty business" of wiretapping, also said he was
"morally certain" that the Supreme Court's
conference room was bugged. The most secret
deliberations of the justices on pending cases take
place in the room.
"We who live in the District of Columbia know
that electronic surveillance is commonplace," wrote
Douglas in a Court opinion. "I am indeed morally
certain that the conference room has been 'bugged'
and President Johnson during his term in the White

House asserted to me that even his phone was
tapped."
Douglas gave no additional information and his
office responded to inquiries by saying there would
be no more comment.
Ford Seeks Peacemaker Role
PORTLAND — Seeking to establish himself as a
peacemaker between the White House and Congress,
Vice President-designate Gerald R. Ford said
yesterday he will try to "solve the problems of the
future" without concern for difficulties of the past.
Ford, nominated by President Nixon to replace
Spiro P. Agnew, was in Portland to address a
druggists' convention,
"My whole attitude is that every day is a day
that we can start anew in seeking a solution to
whatever the problem may be in the next 24
hours," Ford said. "And that is the attitude I think
we as Americans must have."
Without referring specifically to either the
Agnew case or Watergate, Ford conceded that there
has been a lot of bad news out of Washington and
said "no one is sadder about it than I."
"Those who have been guilty of the misdeeds
certainly ought to be penalized," he said. "But I
don't think we should let those sad days hamper or
hinder our efforts to work on what we have ahead."
Thai Leaders Flee Country
BANGKOK — Three of Thailand's most powerful
military leaders, including the ex-premier, left the
country on Monday after two days of bloody
demonstrations in the capital against military rule,
the government radio said.
The announcement over Radio Thailand, coupled
with a declaration by the new civilian premier, Dr.
Sanya Thammasak, that he had reached a
compromise agreement with student demonstration
leaders, appeared to ease the explosive situation in
Bangkok.
The radio announced that the leaders — former
Premier Thanom Kittikachorn, Deputy Premier and
Field Marshal Praphas Charusathien, and Col.
Narong Kittikachorn — flew to an undisclosed
destination in a move to restore peace.
Praphas was considered the most powerful man
in the military ruling group. Narong was the deputy
chief of national security.
During the day, the city's main police

headquarters was stormed and burned by an armed
mob in one of numerous clashes with authorities.
Several other police stations also were attacked.
Complete casualty figures were not available, but
a report on the police radio communications
network said many police were killed in one
skirmish.
Nixon Unaware Of Contributions
WASHINGTON — The White House said
yesterday President Nixon was unaware of the
$100,000 in campaign contributions reportedly
given to his personal friend Charles G. (Bebe)
Rebozo by billionaire Howard Hughes.
The denial of presidential knowledge was made
by Deputy Press Secretary Gerald L. Warren, who
had conferred with Nixon after being questioned
sharply by reporters at a midday news briefing.
Warren said he did not know specifically when
the President became aware of the reported
contributions. He said he assumed it was when news
reports about the transactions were first published.
Conspiracy Charges Dismissed
DETROIT — A federal judge dismissed bomb
conspiracy charges yesterday against 15 radicals
after the government said it could not give the
defendants certain information because of national
security reasons.
U.S. Atty. Ralph B. Guy Jr. requested dismissal
of the charges, saying he could not comply with an
order issued by U.S. District Court Judge Damon
Keith to reveal all investigations of the defendants
by the government.
Race Looms In Atlanta Election
ATLANTA — Race looms as the biggest issue in
Tuesday's runoff mayoral election between
incumbent Jewish Mayor Sam Massell and popular
black Vice Mayor Maynard Jackson.
Ironically, Massell, who rode to victory four
years ago as a liberal with overwhelming black
support, is the candidate accused of injecting racism
into the campaign.
Massell, who barely made the runoff in the Oct.
2 general election, has sought to tie Jackson with
Hosea Williams, a black activist candidate in the
runoff for president of City Council.
Although candidates for the two top offices in
city government do not run as a team, Massell has
constantly linked the polished, 35-year-old Jackson
with Williams, a bearded civil rights campaigner and
local leader of Southern Christian Leadership
Conference.
Miami Police Investigate Slaying
MIAMI — Police here are investigating a voodoo
cult in the Latin community following the slaying
of a man who reportedly threatened to use the head
of his attacker in a sacrificial ritual.
Police said yesterday they were sifting through
the belongings of Juan Olivier Hernandez, 36, for
information about the cult and clues to the identity
of his killer. One officer said they found a "lot of
weird stuff" in his room.
Hernandez was killed Saturday night when he
was shot three times by an attacker who witnesses
said had chased him through Miami's Little Havana
section.
Police said witnesses told them Hernandez had
earlier told the killer — described as a male in his
30s — that he intended to use his head in a
sacrificial rite.
Today's Weather
Fair through Wednesday but local late night and
morning fog and low clouds. Low both nights upper
40s and 50s. High Tuesday and Wednesday 70s to
lower 80s. Northwest wind to 15 mph afternoons.

TOPLESS — It got pretty hot in the stands at Saturday's UCLA-Stanford massacre. Of course, some might
argue that it was hotter on the field, where the Bruins were kicking the daylights out of The Farm.
