# Decision On Encina Coming Next Month
## 
### BOB LOWE 
Stanford will decide in the next
month whether to spend $2.7 million
to rehabilitate the east wing of Encina
Hall, which suffered extensive damage
during a fire in June, 1972.
If the University decides to go
ahead with the project, construction
would probably begin in a year and
might take another year and a half
before completion.
Gene Kershner of the Planning
Office said that if the east wing is
rebuilt, the entire inside will first be
"gutted."
Concrete will be sprayed on the
insides of the walls to strengthen the
structure. The interior of the east wing
must then be completely rebuilt,
including the floors, roof, and the
mechanical, electrical, and plumbing
systems.
Kershner noted that when the fire
occurred, the east wing was
"substantially as built in 1891." The
reconstruction will improve upon the
old building and bring the east wing up
to present structural codes. In
addition, a sprinkler system will be

installed.
The center section of Encina Hall
was rehabilitated last year at a cost of
$274,000, but the damage was
relatively light. The roof was
destroyed and the top floor was
damaged by water. The roof, attic
ventilation system, and most of the
carpeting were replaced.
Stanford employees who worked in
the east wing were relocated in the Old
Pavilion, which was previously an
athletic facility.
According to Kershner, it was
necessary to adopt a floor plan called
"open office landscaping," with most
offices in one large, open area and
partitions are set up to create rooms.
Kershner said that there was initial
"resistence" from employees involved
in the shift. But he added that most
had adjusted to the change in facilities.
He said that there are some
advantages to open office landscaping
such as "across the room
communication." But Kershner
pointed out disadvantages, too,
including lack of privacy and higher
noise level.
