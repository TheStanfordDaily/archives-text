# Oil Cutoffs Feared

in crude oil costs, which Rowen sees as
likely, would mean a 10 to 20 percent
increase in costs at the pump.
The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) is
responsible for the price increases,
Rowen says. This multi-national group
has a virtual monopoly on supplies in
the oil-rich Arab nations. But the
cartel may weaken of its own accord,
Rowen claimed.
"If they [individual Arab
countries] yield to the temptation of
displacing [the cartel], then the
situation may become a good deal
more competitive and the cartel's price
structure will probably weaken.
Cartels, historically, have a habit of
getting unstuck," Rowen noted.
Urges Cooperation
He called for cooperation among
oil-importing countries, to counter
OPEC.
"A significant reduction in total oil
flow from producing countries has
impact on all consuming countries in
the form of at least increased price'-

and perhaps actual shortages. If, for
example, the Arab countries reduce
supplies in reaction to U.S. support of
Israel, then Europe and Japan will feel
the effects.
"The case for cooperation goes
further than coordinating supplies in a
crisis and assuring supplies over the
longer term; it should include
developing a common policy on
dealing with the OPEC countries,"
Rowen contended.
Rowen cited evidence that some
large oil-producing countries, such as
Saudi Arabia, may not want to up
their oil exports as world demand
increases. A consuming countries'
organization could then exert pressure,
Rowen hypothesized.
Rowen claimed that
implementation of his ideas would
hold U.S. dependence on Arab oil
down to about 20 percent of all its
energy needs. At present rates, the
percentage of imported energy will rise
from the present rate of 10 to around
30 percent within 10 years, he said.
