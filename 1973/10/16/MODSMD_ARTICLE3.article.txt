# Soviets Pledge To Assist Arabs; Tanks Clash On Two Fronts

By The Associated Press
The Soviet Union declared today its
"determination to assist in every way"
the Arab effort to liberate territories
occupied by Israel, Tass reported.
Meanwhile, Egypt claimed its tanks
dug in along new lines in the Sinai
Monday and Israel reported routing an
Iraqi tank column on the Syrian front
as the Middle East war raged through

its 10th day.
The Tel Aviv command said Israeli
warplanes bombed and strafed targets
near Cairo and Damascus after seizing
control of the skies over both fronts.
But Cairo said it shot down nine
Israeli planes attacking Egyptian air
bases and staged a dawn commando
raid in the desert behind Israel's Sinai
lines.

The State Department announced
in Washington that the United States
has begun to resupply Israel with
military equipment, citing what it
called a massive Soviet airlift to
replenish Arab arsenals.
The Soviet Union pledged a
"determination to assist in every way"
the Arab battle to liberate lands
captured by Israel in 1967.

The official Soviet news agency said
the promise was made during talks
between Soviet Communist party
leader Leonid I. Brezhnev and
President Houari Boumedienne of
Algeria on "Israel's imperialist
aggression."
The announcement of open U.S.
arms deliveries to Israel could fuel
more anti-American sentiment in the
Arab world, already angered by earlier
reports of U.S. arms being sent to the
Jewish state.
Cargo Planes
Portuguese sources in Lisbon said
U.S. military cargo planes and
Phantom jets were passing rapidly
through an American base in the
Azores, heading east.
President Richard Nixon said at a
Medal of Honor ceremony at the
White House that U.S. policy is
directed at "the right of every nation
in the Middle East to maintain its
independence and security." He did
not comment on the arms deliveries.
The United Arab Emirates, which
include two Persian Gulf oil countries,
told Nixon through the U.S. Embassy
in Abu Dhabi of their "deep concern"
over the arms shipments.
Similar sentiments have been voiced
in stronger language by Egypt, Syria,
Iruq, Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Libya
since the conflict erupted Oct. 6.
Oil Cutoff?
There has been much talk in Arab
capitals of an oil cutoff, such as the
three-month shutdown in 1967 and
oil-producing Arab countries meet
Tuesday in Kuwait to discuss oil's role
in the war.
But the U.S. government released
figures in Washington purporting to
show that the United States could get
along at least for the time being even if
the Arab oil spigots were screwed shut.
The Israeli push into Syria was
reported slowed by heavy Syrian tank
and artillery fire about 21 miles from
Damascus, near the town of Sasa.
Associated Press correspondent
John Vinocur said from the front that
Syria's Soviet-built cannons were
blasting Israeli positions all along the
some 19 miles of road leading from
the 1967 Golan Heights cease-fire
lines.
Armored Battle
But the Israeli command claimed
later in Tel Aviv that Israeli tanks
crashed through Iraqi armor on the
central Syrian front and advanced into
more Arab-held territory.
Israeli tank crews in the column
battling up the road to Damascus told
Vinocur they destroyed about 25 Arab
tanks in duels that lasted most of the
day.
"Tank battles are still raging in the
northern sector of the front," a Syrian
communique said.
Syria charged that Israeli air strikes
included bombing of civilian targets at
Latakia and Tartus, Mediterranean
ports with major oil installations.
The Tel Aviv command said Israeli
jets over the ports were bombing fuel
depots. It said the Israeli warplanes
also attacked the Syrian tanks
defending the road to Damascus and
pounded Egyptian missile batteries
and air bases 53 and 36 miles from
Cairo.
Air raid sirens howled over the
Egyptian capital for the fourth time
since the conflict broke out. Residents
reported hearing faint explosions but
no damage was seen and the all-clear

sounded 55 minutes later.
The Syrian Embassy in Athens
released a statement claiming that
Syrians have captured American pilots
from planes shot down during air raids
on Syrian towns.
"Among the planes shot down by
the Syrian air defense were also
American Phantoms, bearing no
markings of the Israeli air force,
piloted by American pilots who have
been captured by our forces," it said
