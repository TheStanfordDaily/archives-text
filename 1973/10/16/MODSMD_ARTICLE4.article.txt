# Students Massively Reject SJC, Tentative Election Results Show
## 
### STEPHEN CARTER 
Students voted overwhelmingly on
Wednesday and Thursday to reject the
controversial Committee of 15 (C-15)
proposal to reform the student judicial
system, according to tentative results
released yesterday by ASSU Elections
Commissioner Rick Haskell.

He also disclosed final returns on
the race for graduate seats on the
ASSU Senate, and tentative results on
the race for undergraduate seats. Final
results await the return of overseas
campus ballots, expected sometime
today.
The students rejected the C-15
recommendation by a margin of 1555
to 527, or 74.6 percent. Officials
expect overseas campus ballots to
change this percentage only slightly.
Had the proposal been adopted and
ratified by President Richard Lyman
and the Faculty Senate, it would have
replaced the Campus Judicial Panel
with a student-majority system, the
Stanford Judicial Council.
Some student groups had expressed
opposition to the plan, because only
student members would be chosen
randomly, and either the University
president or a two-thirds vote of the

Academic Senate or the ASSU Senate
could remove the one-student majority
at any time.
All 13 graduate students running
for the ASSU Senate became either
senators or alternates. The 10 graduate
division senators are Michael Amylon,
Rocky Barber, Bill Faught, Dave
Harris, Eric Hemel, Rosemary Killam,
Tim Moyer, Gene Michael O'Grady,
Randy Smith, and Leslie Ann Waleigh.
The three alternates are Faruq
Ahmad, Bob Barker and Len Mackey.
The undergraduate Senate seats and
alternate positions remain unfilled,
pending the return of the overseas
ballots. The top 10 vote getters, who
will become the senators unless
overseas ballots alter the results, are:
800 Bacon, Rosemary Esparaza, John
Gonzales, Mike Herman, Quinn Mayer,
John Milstein, Frank Ramirez, Bruce
Smyth, Derek L. Toliver and Chip
Underwood.
The next 10, currently the leaders
for the alternate positions, are Lucy
Acevedo, Pam Barnes, Tony Brisco,
Ann Carter, Keith Copeland and Maria
Echaveste, Miguel A. Martinez, Cary
Ellen Ridder, Rob Switzer and Linda
Lorna Swain.
Haskell emphasized these results
"are extremely tentative," noting that
"the overseas people tend to vote in
blocks." Final results will be released
as soon as the overseas ballots become
available.
