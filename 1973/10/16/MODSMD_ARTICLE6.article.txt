# Peninsula School Holds 'Ecstatic' Learning Fair
## 
### JANET SANDERS 
Menlo Park's Peninsula School, one
of the oldest "free schools" in the
country, goes by the often-voiced but
rarely-heeded truism that participation
is the key to learning. So when it
decided to hold a learning festival two
years ago, the event had to be more
than a collection of booths to feed the
senses of nonchalant passersby.
Last weekend, the alternative
school lived up to its educational
philosophy with its second
"super-ecstatic, completely credible"
learning fair. All who entered the
six-acre school site could become as
involved, and perhaps as dirty, as they
desired.
Kids smudged each other's faces
with paint at the makeup booth and
then crossed over to the pottery
wheels for some red clay. To add to
their somewhat bedraggled
appearances, some wore snakes, which
they had acquired from snake breeder
Marty Marcus, a former science
teacher at Peninsula School.
For the more fastidious older set,
there were weaving and dancing classes
in the upstairs wing of the rambling
Victorian mansion which houses the
school. Organic food refreshed the
weary fair-goers who paused to hear
offbeat musical groups on the
makeshift outdoor stage.

For an entrance fee of $2.50 which
went to the school's scholarship fund,
one could participate in a smorgasbord
of creative workshops ranging from
yoga and computer games to Gestalt
dreamwork and hypnosis. People came
from all over the Bay Area to set up
50 projects for the expected crowd of
2000 fairgoers.
The idea for a learning fair
originated with Bob Albrecht, a
Peninsula School parent and member
of the People's Computer Company in
Palo Alto.
"I was tired of professional
conferences," he said. "The fair was a
way for those interested in new styles
of education to get together, to let the
public know about what was going on,
to make money for the school, and to
have fun."
Learning Experiences
Albrecht's idea met with the
approval of Peninsula School Director
Barney Young. He envisioned a fair
which would incorporate the school's
philosophy of "involving people in all
kinds of learning experiences.
"For education to flow naturally,
the motivation must come from the
child, not the teacher," Young said at
the fair. As he talked, children darted
from one place to another under the
oak trees, not exactly sure what they
were learning about but certainly

having a good time in the process of
finding out.
Of course, involvement sometimes
leads to chaos, as was dramatically
illustrated Sunday in a children's
rendition of the play, St. George and
the Dragon.
Play
John Brebner and Phillip Sheridan,
two members of the Bay Area
Renaissance Center Cultural
Foundation, had a trunkful of
medieval clothing but no actors.
Informal auditions were held on the
spot, and 10 minutes later, the
youthful cast, almost all under the age
of 12, presented the play.
But the audience, and most of all
the young actors, probably liked the
amateur production far more than
they would have a professional one.
Not far from the stage was a
building called a "tactile sensorium."
Only those with blindfolds could
enter, then feeling their way along
tables full of wet noodles, ice, banana
peels, and other tactile nightmares.
Other workshops involved more
participation than just touching.
A "boffer booth" provided the
aggressive fairgoer with a way to
release his pent-up frustrations by
supplying him with huge foam rubber
swords. Two people could then get
together and "boff" each other to

their hearts' content.
Inside the school house, people
writhed on the floor, strings of yarn
stretched between their hands and
feet. Moving to background music,
they formed living string sculptures
while a dancing teacher watched and
sometimes offered suggestions.
Historic Building
The mansion, full of other
workshops besides the dance class, was
an exhibit in itself. Officially
recognized as an historic building, it
has radically changed from its 19th
century days.
Brightly colored murals have been
painted on the walls, and children's
craft exhibits line the corridors. The
wide Victorian staircases add a
peculiar touch of history to the
contemporary decorating.
The school, approaching its 50th
anniversary, has expanded beyond the
mansion, however. Enrollment has
steadily increased, according to
Young, and reached a peak this year of
230 children.
Tuition rages from $625 per year
for nursery school children to $1175
per year for junior high ages. "About
20 percent of our students are getting
scholarship money," added Young.
This year's learning fair director,
Pat English, hoped that the two day
event would boost the scholarship
fund by more than $1800.

originated with Bob Albrecht, a
Peninsula School parent and member
of the People's Computer Company in
Palo Alto.
"I was tired of professional
conferences," he said. "The fair was a
way for those interested in new styles
of education to get together, to let the
public know about what was going on,
to make money for the school, and to
have fun."
Learning Experiences
Albrecht's idea met with the
approval of Peninsula School Director
Barney Young. He envisioned a fair
which would incorporate the school's
philosophy of "involving people in all
kinds of learning experiences.
"For education to flow naturally,
the motivation must come from the
child, not the teacher," Young said at
the fair. As he talked, children darted
from one place to another under the
oak trees, not exactly sure what they
were learning about but certainly

having a good time in the process of
finding out.
Of course, involvement sometimes
leads to chaos, as was dramatically
illustrated Sunday in a children's
rendition of the play, St. George and
the Dragon.
Play
John Brebner and Phillip Sheridan,
two members of the Bay Area
Renaissance Center Cultural
Foundation, had a trunkful of
medieval clothing but no actors.
Informal auditions were held on the
spot, and 10 minutes later, the
youthful cast, almost all under the age
of 12, presented the play.
But the audience, and most of all
the young actors, probably liked the
amateur production far more than
they would have a professional one.
Not far from the stage was a
building called a "tactile sensorium."
Only those with blindfolds could
enter, then feeling their way along
tables full of wet noodles, ice, banana
peels, and other tactile nightmares.
Other workshops involved more
participation than just touching.
A "boffer booth" provided the
aggressive fairgoer with a way to
release his pent-up frustrations by
supplying him with huge foam rubber
swords. Two people could then get
together and "boff" each other to

their hearts' content.
Inside the school house, people
writhed on the floor, strings of yarn
stretched between their hands and
feet. Moving to background music,
they formed living string sculptures
while a dancing teacher watched and
sometimes offered suggestions.
Historic Building
The mansion, full of other
workshops besides the dance class, was
an exhibit in itself. Officially
recognized as an historic building, it
has radically changed from its 19th
century days.
Brightly colored murals have been
painted on the walls, and children's
craft exhibits line the corridors. The
wide Victorian staircases add a
peculiar touch of history to the
contemporary decorating.
The school, approaching its 50th
anniversary, has expanded beyond the
mansion, however. Enrollment has
steadily increased, according to
Young, and reached a peak this year of
230 children.
Tuition rages from $625 per year
for nursery school children to $1175
per year for junior high ages. "About
20 percent of our students are getting
scholarship money," added Young.
This year's learning fair director,
Pat English, hoped that the two day
event would boost the scholarship
fund by more than $1800.

BOFFERS - Two participants in last weekend's Peninsula School
learning fair vent their aggressions with foam plastic boffing swords.
Other attractions included pottery, yoga, and a "tactile sensorium."
Menlo Park's Peninsula School, one
of the oldest "free schools" in the
country, goes by the often-voiced but
rarely-heeded truism that participation
is the key to learning. So when it
decided to hold a learning festival two
years ago, the event had to be more
than a collection of booths to feed the
senses of nonchalant passersby.
Last weekend, the alternative
school lived up to its educational
philosophy with its second
"super-ecstatic, completely credible"
learning fair. All who entered the
six-acre school site could become as
involved, and perhaps as dirty, as they
desired.
Kids smudged each other's faces
with paint at the makeup booth and
then crossed over to the pottery
wheels for some red clay. To add to
their somewhat bedraggled
appearances, some wore snakes, which
they had acquired from snake breeder
Marty Marcus, a former science
teacher at Peninsula School.
For the more fastidious older set,
there were weaving and dancing classes
in the upstairs wing of the rambling
Victorian mansion which houses the
school. Organic food refreshed the
weary fair-goers who paused to hear
offbeat musical groups on the
makeshift outdoor stage.

For an entrance fee of $2.50 which
went to the school's scholarship fund,
one could participate in a smorgasbord
of creative workshops ranging from
yoga and computer games to Gestalt
dreamwork and hypnosis. People came
from all over the Bay Area to set up
50 projects for the expected crowd of
2000 fairgoers.

Only those with blindfolds could
enter, then feeling their way along
tables full of wet noodles, ice, banana
peels, and other tactile nightmares.
Other workshops involved more
participation than just touching.
A "boffer booth" provided the
aggressive fairgoer with a way to
release his pent-up frustrations by
supplying him with huge foam rubber
swords. Two people could then get
together and "boff" each other to

their hearts' content.
Inside the school house, people
writhed on the floor, strings of yarn
stretched between their hands and
feet. Moving to background music,
they formed living string sculptures
while a dancing teacher watched and
sometimes offered suggestions.
Historic Building
The mansion, full of other
workshops besides the dance class, was
an exhibit in itself. Officially
recognized as an historic building, it
has radically changed from its 19th
century days.
Brightly colored murals have been
painted on the walls, and children's
craft exhibits line the corridors. The
wide Victorian staircases add a
peculiar touch of history to the
contemporary decorating.
The school, approaching its 50th
anniversary, has expanded beyond the
mansion, however. Enrollment has
steadily increased, according to
Young, and reached a peak this year of
230 children.
Tuition rages from $625 per year
for nursery school children to $1175
per year for junior high ages. "About
20 percent of our students are getting
scholarship money," added Young.
This year's learning fair director,
Pat English, hoped that the two day
event would boost the scholarship
fund by more than $1800.

BOFFERS - Two participants in last weekend's Peninsula School
learning fair vent their aggressions with foam plastic boffing swords.
Other attractions included pottery, yoga, and a "tactile sensorium."
Menlo Park's Peninsula School, one
of the oldest "free schools" in the
country, goes by the often-voiced but
rarely-heeded truism that participation
is the key to learning. So when it
decided to hold a learning festival two
years ago, the event had to be more
than a collection of booths to feed the
senses of nonchalant passersby.
Last weekend, the alternative
school lived up to its educational
philosophy with its second
"super-ecstatic, completely credible"
learning fair. All who entered the
six-acre school site could become as
involved, and perhaps as dirty, as they
desired.
Kids smudged each other's faces
with paint at the makeup booth and
then crossed over to the pottery
wheels for some red clay. To add to
their somewhat bedraggled
appearances, some wore snakes, which
they had acquired from snake breeder
Marty Marcus, a former science
teacher at Peninsula School.
For the more fastidious older set,
there were weaving and dancing classes
in the upstairs wing of the rambling
Victorian mansion which houses the
school. Organic food refreshed the
weary fair-goers who paused to hear
offbeat musical groups on the
makeshift outdoor stage.

For an entrance fee of $2.50 which
went to the school's scholarship fund,
one could participate in a smorgasbord
of creative workshops ranging from
yoga and computer games to Gestalt
dreamwork and hypnosis. People came
from all over the Bay Area to set up
50 projects for the expected crowd of
2000 fairgoers.
The idea for a learning fair
originated with Bob Albrecht, a
Peninsula School parent and member
of the People's Computer Company in
Palo Alto.
"I was tired of professional
conferences," he said. "The fair was a
way for those interested in new styles
of education to get together, to let the
public know about what was going on,
to make money for the school, and to
have fun."
Learning Experiences
Albrecht's idea met with the
approval of Peninsula School Director
Barney Young. He envisioned a fair
which would incorporate the school's
philosophy of "involving people in all
kinds of learning experiences.
"For education to flow naturally,
the motivation must come from the
child, not the teacher," Young said at
the fair. As he talked, children darted
from one place to another under the
oak trees, not exactly sure what they
were learning about but certainly

having a good time in the process of
finding out.
Of course, involvement sometimes
leads to chaos, as was dramatically
illustrated Sunday in a children's
rendition of the play, St. George and
the Dragon.
Play
John Brebner and Phillip Sheridan,
two members of the Bay Area
Renaissance Center Cultural
Foundation, had a trunkful of
medieval clothing but no actors.
Informal auditions were held on the
spot, and 10 minutes later, the
youthful cast, almost all under the age
of 12, presented the play.
But the audience, and most of all
the young actors, probably liked the
amateur production far more than
they would have a professional one.
Not far from the stage was a
building called a "tactile sensorium."
Only those with blindfolds could
enter, then feeling their way along
tables full of wet noodles, ice, banana
