# Moral Law Dictates Ownership
## Jews Own Mideast Land 
### 
Andrew Leuchter

"/n the land of Israel the Jewish
people came into being. In this
land was shaped their spiritual,
religious, and national character.
Here they lived in sovereign
independence. Here they created a
culture of national and universal
import, and gave unto the world
the eternal Book of Books."
- The State of Israel's
Declaration of Independence
May 14,1948
It is not the purpose of this
article to debate the legitimacy of
the Old Testament; a subject
which has for so long been
bandied around the pulpit could
not be treated fully here. But a
belief in the promises of the Old
Testament is not a prerequisite for
acceptance of Zionist claims to
Palestine. The Jewish claim to the
lands of Israel is based upon
fundamental moral law, which Bill
Evers' preoccupation with
feudalism prevents him from
recognizing (Daily, Oct. 10).
Mr. Evers claims that the roots
of the Middle-Eastern conflict
reach back to World War I, and
what he terms the "Arab struggle
for national self-determination."
He is obviously not a historian.
Arab interest in Palestinian land
did not develop until the 19205.
The "struggle to throw off foreign
rule" which Mr. Evers cites never
even took place; indeed, to
persuade the desert tribesmen to
rebel against their Ottoman
overlords, the British had to bribe
them with five million dollars in
gold.
The surge of Arab nationalism
was largely a postwar
phenomenon. It blossomed with
the influx of Jewish refugees who
were fleeing persecution in
Europe. The Arabs were bitter
and suspicious of what they
thought was yet another intrusion
on their land. Yet this
immigration was no intrusion: it
was instead a homecoming. For
the Jewish claim to a Palestinian
state antedates this Arab
nationalism by more than 3000
years.
In some 1500 years of
pre-Christian settlement, history
establishes nine centuries of
complete Jewish sovereignty in
the Holy Land, and five of
self-government. Since the last of
the Judaic rulers, seven empires
ruled Palestine, and with them
came 1800 years of property
shuffling. The only constant
factor in these centuries of claims
and counter-claims to Palestine
has been the continued attempt of
the Jewish people to resettle their
homeland.
Today's realization of the State
of Israel is a Jewish birthright
from deep in tradition, and a
fulfillment of centuries of
nationalistic efforts. Mr. Evers'
libertarian theories of justice have
little relevance to a
Middle-Eastern setting to begin
with; they have even less relevance
when weighed against the moral
law of tradition.
Both Jews and Arabs have
rights to a Palestinian homeland;
Mr. Evers cites violations of the
Arabs' land rights as provocation
for aggression. He views the Arab
armies as Palestinian refugees,
fighting to regain their homes and
farmlands. But the Arab armies
existed long before there were
Palestinian refugees. These armies
aggressed before a displacement of
tenant farmers took place. Indeed,
the land of the 587,000 refugees
of 1948 would never have been
seized had Arab armies not
aggressed, and made such seizure a
military necessity.
Palestinian refugees are not the
cause of the Mid-Eastern crisis;
they are one of its most
unfortunate side-effects. The

causes of the crisis are much more
complex: Jewish trade union
which excluded Arab workers
from commerce and industry;
resentment incurred by the first
Jewish immigrants' patronizing
attitude towards their Arab
neighbors; fear of a Bolshevik
invasion by the Russian Jewish
immigrants; perhaps most
important were the broken
promises of the French and
British. But the trigger in this
potentially explosive situation was
Arab impatience and ignorance.
Economically and socially
unsophisticated, and light-years
behind the Zionists in the
development of a coherent
nationalism, the twentieth
century Arabs achieved nation
sovereignty for the first time in
almost 2000 years.

Their responses to the
pressures and new-found freedoms
of self-determination have been
simple and unyielding; they have
refused every compromise offered
them; they have developed a
reactionary nationalism; organized
by fanatic leaders, they have seen
violence as their only recourse.
Bloodshed started with murders
and lootings in Jerusalem's Jewish
quarter in the spring of 1920; it
attracted world-wide attention
with the Arab attack on the
newly-formed State of Israel in
1948; the violence has culminated
in last weeks' aggression by Egypt

East

and Syria.
The blame for the
Middle-Eastern political crisis
cannot be placed on any one
party involved. But contrary to
Mr. Evers' opinion, it is very
simple to place the blame for war
squarely on the Arabs. It is always
very easy to place the blame for
war in cases such as this: the
responsibility plainly rests with
the side that first left the
conference table for the
battlefield.
(Andrew Leuchter is a
sophomore.)
Mr. Evers replies: I disagree with
Andrew Leuchter on several
points.
1. Leuchter does not
accurately characterize Arab
nationalism when he maintains
that the Arabs did not struggle to
throw off the rule of the
Ottomans. While the British did
provide some technical and
financial aid via men like
Lawrence of Arabia, the initiative
came from the activists of Arab
nationalism. The first move was
made by the son of the Sherif of
Mecca in approaching Lord
Kitchener for machine guns.
2. Leuchter invokes the "moral
law of tradition" in opposition to
the libertarian theory of justice.
Tradition per se is an inadequate
basis for ethics. In the history of
Western civilization, for example,
there exist the conflicting
traditions of affirming the
legitimacy of slavery and of
abolitionism. Within the terms of

tradition alone, there is no way to
resolve such conflicts. In contrast,
the libertarian theory of justice is
a rationalist one, yielding
principles capable of universal
application.
3. In the creation of the
refugee problem, precisely the
reverse of what Leuchter describes
as the order of events was what
actually occurred. A major
displacement of the Palestinian
Arab population took place just
before the armies of the
neighboring Arab states entered
Palestine in 1948.
4. Leuchter is correct in
pointing out that the regular
armed forces of the Arab states
are not the same thing as the
Palestinian refugees. As an
opponent of international war, I
would prefer that Israel and the
Arab states cease fighting, and I
would prefer that the Palestinians
carry on a guerrilla war to regain
their lands. I oppose warfare
between states in part because the
modern technology with which
conventional war is conducted
inherently involves the massacre
of civilians.
Guerrilla warfare, on the other
hand, at least can be directed
against the voluntary participants
in the conflict (even though past
practitioners of guerrilla warfare
have not always done this). I do
believe, however, that the aid the
Arab states are giving to their
fellow Arabs the Palestinians is
not a great evil and is analogous to
the aid the Indian government
gave to the Bengalis. Of a
different nature is the
involvement of the great imperial
powers Russia and the United
States; both should immediately
halt their intervention and their
attempts to impose a solution.
As a final matter, I condemn
with full vigor all of the numerous
injustices committed by the Arabs
over years. Yet the fact remains
that on balance more guilt should
be assigned to the Israelis than to
the Arabs for the Middle East
conflict, for Israelis have stolen
the homes, shops, and farms of
many Palestinian Arabs.
