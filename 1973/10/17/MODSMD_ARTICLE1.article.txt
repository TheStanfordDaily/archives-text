# Colorful Tailgaters Enliven Football Saturdays
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
You can see them out in force five
or six Saturdays each fall. They come
large and small, clean and dirty, rich
and comparatively poor, cultured and
crude.
They drink Coors and champagne,
schnapps and Kool-Aid; they eat caviar
and cupcakes, steak and bologna,
crackers and cheese. They drive
Cadillacs and Volkswagens, Porsches
and pickups, and in at least one case a
fire engine.
They're known as tailgaters to the
Stanford athletic department; to
anyone trying to park near the
stadium for a football game, they're
known by several unprintable names
because they foul up traffic.
Defy Categorization
The tailgaters, who show up several
hundred strong for each game, really
defy any categorization. Many of them
are Stanford alumni, but then many of
them aren't. Some are Palo Alto
football fans who have no connection
with the University at all, although
they think it makes a nice picnic spot.
And some are even students.
Tailgating is really pretty easy. You
just buy something to eat or drink —
anything — and show up anywhere
from three hours to 15 minutes before
a football game. Then eat or drink

whatever it was you bought.
Some tailgaters do just that — put
down the tailgate of their car and use
it as a table. Others set up small card
tables, complete with tablecloths and
candle sticks. Some opt for picnic
style — a blanket on the ground. But it
doesn't really matter: tailgating styles,
like the food and drink, are wildly
diverse.
The outer parking lots, filled with
non-season ticket holders (translated:
students, Palo Altans, and alumni who
haven't picked up their first million
yet) tend to have a less expensive look.
Coors
There you can find a iot of Coors,
oceans of cheap wine, and a lot of
people drinking inexpensive
champagne from plastic glasses.
Crackers and cheese abound, and
there's even an occasional grill topped
with hot dogs.
One area of the outer parking
seemed to be the headquarters of th~-
class of '49 last Saturday. Five card
tables, laden with potato salad, fried
chicken, sandwiches and various other
goodies dotted the section, as alumni
held a pre-game victory celebration
with bloody marys and champagne.
Several chairs were labeled 49, as
were a couple of the cars. "I guess you
could say we're a pretty active group,"

one pot-bellied alum confided. "At
least, you could say we're pretty active
drinkers."
While adults can have a pretty good
time just getting smashed, it's pretty
hard for children to figure out how to
amuse themselves until the game
starts. A lot of them just huddle off to
the side, drinking their soda pop and
developing boredom into a fine art.
Some of them play football, or just
run around and collect four-letter
words from motorists who have to
dodge them.
TV
One, 12-year old Christy Stokes,
found a novel way of spending the
time: she watched the
Texas-Oklahoma game on a portable
television. "We always come party like
this," she observed philosoDhicallv.
Christy proved to be a more
talented football prognosticator than
her parents, who were discussing ways
of stopping the UCLA wishbone
offense. Asked who would win, she
replied: "I hope Stanford does, but
they're doing so lousy they probably
will lose." She also picked Oklahoma
to beat Texas for a perfect record.
Tailgating, while not unique to
Stanford, is comparatively rare
elsewhere. "Stanford is really good for
tailgates," said UCLA coed Leslie

Avery, who drove up for the game.
Not At UCLA
UCLA doesn't approve of tailgates,
so when anyone from Los Angeles gets
a chance to do it, they do it big. "Ask
my father for a beer," Avery said.
"There's barely any left. .. We've
gone through about three kegs. I sent
out flyers for this party." She
estimated there were 100 UCLA
students clustered around the station
wagon strung with blue balloons.
The inner parking lot, for season
ticket holders, was a bit more
dignified. Expensive French wine and
an occasional steak barbecue
highlighted the quieter, more elegant
reserved parking.
"We do the same thing in here that
they do out there," one alumni told a
reporter. "We just do it with a little
more class." A little more money, too
— several tailgates featured portable
bars and caviar.
"No more," one alum admonished
another who was pouring gin. "We had
the 30th class reunion last night, and I
still haven't dried out. . . well, maybe
just a little. I have to be in shape for
the game."
And right now he's probably
getting in shape for next week's round
of tailgating — Stanford's number one
participant sport.
