# Censorship And Individual Rights
## Sex Or Violence: Which Is More Obscene?

■ Mark Weaver

I opened the door and there it
; was filling every last nook and
cranny of the motion picture
; screen, ten times as big as life. It
was "Deep Throat" and it was
gross. So gross I felt like
■ wretching during the first five
• minutes of lurid activity and for
' the next two days I was morally
; ashamed and disgusted with
I myself for having seen such a
thing. Now, however, I can deal
i with it in a more rational
perspective.
i "Deep Throat" is
; professionally done. The shots are
; in focus, the soundtrack is clear
' and the lab did a reasonably good
job processing it. The film is still
; trash. The soundtrack does not
I complement the visual and the
acting is simply lousy. The
cinematography is dull and

uncreative. One wonders why,
considering how difficult it is to
sustain a single basic action
throughout an entire film. The
plot is as shallow as a salt lake
and the theme is non-existent. In
short it requires an awful, awful
lot of hard thinking to discover its
"socially redeeming value."
Realizing this some ten
minutes into the film, my friend,
who is inclined to oppose
censorship, started elbowing me
saying, "I think I'm for
censorship now! God they should
censor this!"
This made me recall a similar
occasion not long ago when I
found myself in an emotional
frenzy ranting these same words.
That time the film was "Dirty
Harry" with Clint Eastwood.
The film is about a demented

Charles Manson type who goes
around killing people for the
sadistic joy of it, if for any reason
at all. Meanwhile the film glorifies
tough cop Eastwood as he tracks
down this maniac despite being
restrained by those horrible
constitutional guarantees of
human rights. Finally Clint
corners his prey in a football
stadium and in a sadistic,
revengeful ritual beats him to a
bloody pulp, continuing even
after the man is helpless. In a
sickening role-reversal, cop
becomes the demented sadist
subverting not only all morality
but the criminal processes he is
supposed to represent.
But by far the most appalling
thing was not the image on the
screen but the audience around
me. It was cheering, applauding
and yelling "Kill him! Kill him!
Kill him!" I was scared. I turned
around to see scores of fiery eyes
and faces gloated with revenge
and hate. This film had
deliberately worked its audience
into cheering the bloody sadistic
destruction of one human being
by another. Never have I
witnessed anything as chilling.
The scene could easily have been
Germany in the thirties and that
man on the screen a Jew. It could
have been a Weatherman rally in
1970 and that man a cop. And so
I left the theater raving about the
"disgusting, fascist film."

So I feel that however
sickening "Deep Throat" may be,
"Dirty Harry" is far more perverse
a film. Which is more detrimental
to the public welfare — the
debasing sexual joys of two
people, seen by limited audiences,
or the inciting of hate and
physical brutality witnessed by
millions?
In viewing these two films in
this way I am setting up a certain
friction in which the issues of
censorship appear, even for me, in
a new light. Why is "Deep
Throat" subject to obscenity laws
when "Dirty Harry" drifts freely
by? Why do we censor what we
do?
The main argument for
suppressing "Deep Throat" is that
it might lead some people to
debase themselves and others and
so lower public morals. One can
argue, however, that the film is a
safety-valve for the harmless
release of perverse sexual fantasy
and in this way contributes to the
public welfare.
But disregarding this, the basic
determinant of what is to be
censored is the prevailing moral
climate which "Deep Throat" of
course violates and "Dirty Harry"
does not. Nonetheless, "Dirty
Harry" goes far beyond "Deep
TTiroat" in offending my own
morals and sense of the public
good. My inclination is that it

should be censored, even though
one can argue that it serves as a
safety-valve for the harmless
release of pent up feelings of guilt
and hostility.
As much as I hope the time
will come when Americans get
more upset over wanton human
cruelty than unusual sex acts I
cannot sanction censorship as a
means of accomplishing this. To
advocate suppression of "Dirty
Harry" would put me in the
untenable position of claiming a
kind of moral superiority neither I
nor anyone can pretend to. Such
an attempt by the society as a
whole is just as pretentious. The
public's uncritical acceptance of
"Dirty Harry" demonstrates that
a society has no more of a
monopoly on moral knowledge
than its individual members do.
Censorship is not borne of a
concern for the public welfare as
much as it reflects a society's
desire to enforce the prevailing
moral climate upon all of its
members. True, it purports to
protect the public good, but a
definition of the public good is
derived from one's moral
conceptions. Morality is in the eye
of the beholder. Let us not
tamper with it until it directly
infringes on another's rights.
