Boycott Gallo
Editor:
I am both appalled and
outraged by the continuing
promotion of Gallo wines in your
paper. The Gallo advertisements
of Oct. 4 and 11 in the Daily truly
make hypocrites of the Daily. The
Daily has already thrown its
support behind the United
Farmworkers Union boycotts of
grapes. Lettuce and Safeway
stores. This past and present
support is commendable and
much appreciated, as public
support of the boycotts is the
major key to success for the
thousands of farmworkers
struggling for unionization in

California agriculture.
This summer the Gallo wineries
refused to renegotiate their
contract with the UFW. They told
the UFW that as long as the UFW
demanded that the pesticide
protection and hiring hall
provisions again be included in the
contract, they Gallo would not
sign again with the UFW. Instead
the growers signed a sweetheart
contract with the Teamsters union
with no hiring hall and no
pesticide protections included.
The infamous labor contractor
system was again utilized. After
the Gallo-Teamster pact was
signed, Gallo held an election in
which they claimed that the
Teamsters had won. The fact is

that the majority of the
farmworkers were on the picket
lines striking Gallo and were thus
not included in the election.
Gallo, himself, admitted that had
all the farmworkers been allowed
to vote, the UFW would have
overwhelmingly won.
Within the last few weeks the
UFW and the Teamsters have
come to a jurisdictional agreement
and when it is signed, the
Teamsters will immediately give
up the Gallo contract (as well as
the grape contracts with the other
growers). This leaves Gallo
workers still unrepresented and
the boycott is thus needed to get
Gallo to again sign with the union
of the farmworkers' choice, the
UFW. Thus the Gallo boycott is
on and on strong! A large
percentage of Gallo's sales are on
college campuses and it is
important that students
understand the situation and
support the boycott.
Gallo's ads in your paper are
trying to thwart the boycott. Too
much is at stake for the Gallo
farmworkers for the Daily to
continue promoting this scab
wine. Say no to Gallo. People who
want more information are invited
to come to the next Farmworker
Support Committee meeting next
Thursday night at 9 p.m. in the
Cedro Lounge. Boycott Grapes.
Boycott Gallo! Don't Shop
Safeway!

iVledia Regulation
Editor:
The recent exchange between
Meredi Wheeler and Bill Evers on
the regulation of broadcast
content [Daily, Oct. 3, 8, 9, and
11] is entirely typical of the
wider public policy debate on this
issue. There are those who,
rightly, believe that the radio
spectrum can be sold in a free
market, and ought to be, because
government regulation of the mass
media is inconsistent with
freedom of expression. And there
are those who believe, strangely,
that government regulation is

necessary to protect the public
from the consequences of
freedom of expression and
competition in the marketplace of
ideas.
As Mr. Evers says, it is true
that the spectrum could be
allocated by the market (indeed,
radio and TV stations are bought
and sold every day). The spectrum
presently allocated to the
broadcast services is "limited"
only by the FCC's policies.
Technically, there could be lots
more radio and TV stations than
there are. The scarcity of the
spectrum as a whole does not
distinguish it in any meaningful
way from other economic
resources, such as paper and ink.
If there is any role for the
government in mass
communication, it is to ensure
that there are lots of competitors,
each free of government
interference and private restraint.
This is essentially an antitrust
problem. Surely the job of the
government, under the
Amendment, is not to create
concentration in the broadcast
media, through its spectrum
allocation policies, and then to
use that concentration as a
rationale for regulation of those
who would speak.
Indeed, the bankruptcy of the
Fairness Doctrine and the corpus
of legal theories upon which it
stands is now almost universally
recognized among those who are
responsible for its enforcement.
The Chairman of the FCC, the
Chief Judge of the D.C. Court of
Appeals, and the Director of the
Office of Telecommunications
Policy have all suggested a
reexamination of the Doctrine
and its premises.
It comes down to the fact that
those who believe in government
regulation of broadcast content
are illogical, at least, if they do
not accept government regulation
of newspapers and magazines.
And if they believe in the latter,
they do not believe in the First
Amendment. Bruce M. Owen
