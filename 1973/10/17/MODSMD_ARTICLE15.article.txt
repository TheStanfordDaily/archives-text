# Rod Stewart In A Rut
## Maggie Mae Misses Mark 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
SAN FRANCISCO—Rod
Stewart brought his unmistakable
cement mixer voice back to San
Francisco last Tuesday night and
alternately bored and thrilled a
Cow Palace crowd which was
heavily sprinkled with a wide
variety of female and male
groupies.
Stewart wasted much of his
time on his second-rate Mick
Jagger impersonations which are
boring at best. Maybe Rod keeps
it up because the groupies love to
jump up on stage when he's doing
them, only to be thrown off
seconds later by Bill Graham's
long-haired security freaks.
Rod and the Faces are
undeniably capable of some very
fine rock and roll. He was in fine
form on a superb "I'm Losing
You," "Twistin'" and the
MCP-approved "Stay With Me."
On all these numbers, Rod's vocal
power overshadowed his annoying
screechy quality and the Faces
displayed powerful, although
somewhat simplistic musicianship.
But Rod and the Faces have an
extremely limited musical range
and their performance often
bordered on monotony. Rod loves
to prance back and forth across
stage and jump up and down,
much to the screaming approval
of his most avid fans. Maybe he
should devote more of his energy
to his music.
Only on "I Wish It Would
Rain," did Stewart exhibit an

ability to vary his style. On
"Rain," Rod displayed a relatively
harmonious voice and the song
even included a very warm and
sincere tribute to Paul Williams.
But moments later he slipped
back into his old rut on "Every
Picture Tells A Story," which
preceded the eminently
forgettable "Wear It Well" and an
unfortunately condensed "Maggie
Mae."
It was somehow appropriate
for Stewart to appear in a hall
known primarily as a livestock
and horse exhibition site.
Stewart's voice has often been
compared with those of many
animals, including that of a frog in
heat.
Unfortunately his songs all
seem to melt into one another
after awhile and any dose of more
than an hour might be near
unbearable. Perhaps he should try
gargling with Listerine instead of
glass.
The epitome of inconsistency
provided by Stewart was preceded
by a better-than-average set
featuring Rory Gallagher, and a
worse-than-average one featuring
Earth, Wind and Fire.
Gallagher and his four
musicians played some good blues
and some nice, moderate rockers
which were reminiscent of the old
Paul Butterfield Band. Gallagher is
an extremely articulate vocalist
and very competent guitarist who
provided a fine opening for the
evening's show.
All of his somewhat lengthy
numbers were enjoyable, but the
best were "Learned My Lesson,"
and his finale, "Wake-Up
Bullfrog," which featured a

phenomenal bass riff. Gallagher is
talented enough to overshadow
his group, but unlike many rock
performers, he keeps his ego
controlled enough so that all his
musicians get to display their
individual abilities.
It is frustrating to listen to a
group such as Earth, Wind and
Fire because the real talent there
is being covered up. The group
occasionally gets into some
outstanding jazz/rock which is
similar to the Crusaders' best, but
most of the time they fool around
in a way which detracts from their
music.
During their set, various
members of the group did
calisthenics, played paddy-cake
and ring-around-the-rosie and
jumped up and down like human
pogo sticks. These activities have
their place, but they don't help a
musician who is trying to play a
musical instrument and/or sing.
When added to the usual inane
pap about how much love there is
in the audience plus forced
clapping and the übiquitous "do
you feel it?,"it is easy to forget
what musical talent they did have.
Gimmicks and meaningless
cliches have unfortunately begun
to become more and more
frequent in rock music in recent
months. Rock has always been a
center for fads, most of which
have thankfully been short lived.
Hopefully more and more
musicians will realize that
gimmickery and phony
showmanship only detract from
musical talent. That is a lesson
which neither Rod Stewart nor
Earth, Wind and Fire has yet
learned.

best were "Learned My Lesson,"
and his finale, "Wake-Up
Bullfrog," which featured a

phenomenal bass riff. Gallagher is
talented enough to overshadow
his group, but unlike many rock
performers, he keeps his ego
controlled enough so that all his
musicians get to display their
individual abilities.
It is frustrating to listen to a
group such as Earth, Wind and
Fire because the real talent there
is being covered up. The group
occasionally gets into some
outstanding jazz/rock which is
similar to the Crusaders' best, but
most of the time they fool around
in a way which detracts from their
music.
During their set, various
members of the group did
calisthenics, played paddy-cake
and ring-around-the-rosie and
jumped up and down like human
pogo sticks. These activities have
their place, but they don't help a
musician who is trying to play a
musical instrument and/or sing.
When added to the usual inane
pap about how much love there is
in the audience plus forced
clapping and the übiquitous "do
you feel it?,"it is easy to forget
what musical talent they did have.
Gimmicks and meaningless
cliches have unfortunately begun
to become more and more
frequent in rock music in recent
months. Rock has always been a
center for fads, most of which
have thankfully been short lived.
Hopefully more and more
musicians will realize that
gimmickery and phony
showmanship only detract from
musical talent. That is a lesson
which neither Rod Stewart nor
Earth, Wind and Fire has yet
learned.
SAN FRANCISCO—Rod
Stewart brought his unmistakable
cement mixer voice back to San
Francisco last Tuesday night and
alternately bored and thrilled a
Cow Palace crowd which was
heavily sprinkled with a wide
variety of female and male
groupies.
Stewart wasted much of his
time on his second-rate Mick
Jagger impersonations which are
boring at best. Maybe Rod keeps
it up because the groupies love to
jump up on stage when he's doing
them, only to be thrown off
seconds later by Bill Graham's
long-haired security freaks.
Rod and the Faces are
undeniably capable of some very
fine rock and roll. He was in fine
form on a superb "I'm Losing
You," "Twistin'" and the
MCP-approved "Stay With Me."
On all these numbers, Rod's vocal
power overshadowed his annoying
screechy quality and the Faces
displayed powerful, although
somewhat simplistic musicianship.
But Rod and the Faces have an
extremely limited musical range
and their performance often
bordered on monotony. Rod loves
to prance back and forth across
stage and jump up and down,
much to the screaming approval
of his most avid fans. Maybe he
should devote more of his energy
to his music.
Only on "I Wish It Would
Rain," did Stewart exhibit an

ability to vary his style. On
"Rain," Rod displayed a relatively
harmonious voice and the song
even included a very warm and
sincere tribute to Paul Williams.
But moments later he slipped
back into his old rut on "Every
Picture Tells A Story," which
preceded the eminently
forgettable "Wear It Well" and an
unfortunately condensed "Maggie
Mae."
It was somehow appropriate
for Stewart to appear in a hall
known primarily as a livestock
and horse exhibition site.
Stewart's voice has often been
compared with those of many
animals, including that of a frog in
heat.
Unfortunately his songs all
seem to melt into one another
after awhile and any dose of more
than an hour might be near
unbearable. Perhaps he should try
gargling with Listerine instead of
glass.
The epitome of inconsistency
provided by Stewart was preceded
by a better-than-average set
featuring Rory Gallagher, and a
worse-than-average one featuring
Earth, Wind and Fire.
Gallagher and his four
musicians played some good blues
and some nice, moderate rockers
which were reminiscent of the old
Paul Butterfield Band. Gallagher is
an extremely articulate vocalist
and very competent guitarist who
provided a fine opening for the
evening's show.
All of his somewhat lengthy
numbers were enjoyable, but the
best were "Learned My Lesson,"
and his finale, "Wake-Up
Bullfrog," which featured a

phenomenal bass riff. Gallagher is
talented enough to overshadow
