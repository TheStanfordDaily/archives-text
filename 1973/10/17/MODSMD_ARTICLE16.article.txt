# New Faces Brighten Outlook
## Women Open Swim Season 
### MARCY O'KEEFE 
A few very talented new faces
and a general overall enthusiasm
mark this fall's women's varsity
swimming team, as Coach Betsy
Weeks predicts a '"winning
season."
The team's first meet will be
held tomorrow at 2:30 p.m. at
Lagunita Pool with Pacific, San
Francisco State and San Jose
State providing teh opposition.
"I believe this year's team will
have even more depth than last
year's," Weeks said. "Just from
watching practice I would guess
that we'll have all strokes covered
by experienced swimmers."
About 16 of this year's 29 women
swimmers competed on Stanford's
undefeated team last year.
Heading the 1973 swimming
talent are freshman Vickie Haynes

and juniors Vickie King and Mei
Ong.
Haynes, whose specialty is the
200-meter breaststroke, competed
this summer in the first "World
Championships of Aquatic
Sports" held in Belgrade,
Yugoslavia. In order to qualify for
that event Vickie placed second in
the Amateur Athletic Union
Nationals held in April of this
year.
International Competition
"I really enjoyed being on the
U.S. team and taking part in
international competition," she
said.
Haynes hopes to compete in
the Women's Nationals at Penn
State next spring.
This fall also marks junior
Vickie King's first appearance on
the women's varsity team. King

attended the 1968 Olympic games
held in Mexico City as an
alternate on the United States
women's swim team and in 1969
held the national record in the
women's 500-meter free style.
"The Olympics were really
exciting for me," Vicki said.
"Being in the Olympics is very
difficult because of the extreme
pressure everyone feels, but it
wasn't too bad for me as an
alternate. It's as if we're not just
competing in sports for sports
sake, but rather as country against
country."
Malaysian Olympian
King will probably swim
distance or 200-meter freestyle in
the women's meets.
Junior Mei Ong from Malaysia
will also compete in Stanford's
varsity swim meets this year. Mei
participated in the 1972 Munich
Olympics as a member of the
Malaysian women's swim team —
training for the event as a
freshman with the Stanford men's
varsity team.
"It was a great thrill to be part
of the Olympics," Mei remarked,
"even though I didn't place it was
a real treat, and good experience."
Mei was chosen Malaysian
Woman Athlete of the Year in
1970. Her strongest events are the
100 and 200-meter backstroke
and the 200 and 400-meter
individual medley.

swimmers competed on Stanford's
undefeated team last year.
Heading the 1973 swimming
talent are freshman Vickie Haynes

and juniors Vickie King and Mei
Ong.
Haynes, whose specialty is the
200-meter breaststroke, competed
this summer in the first "World
Championships of Aquatic
Sports" held in Belgrade,
Yugoslavia. In order to qualify for
that event Vickie placed second in
the Amateur Athletic Union
Nationals held in April of this
year.
International Competition
"I really enjoyed being on the
U.S. team and taking part in
international competition," she
said.
Haynes hopes to compete in
the Women's Nationals at Penn
State next spring.
This fall also marks junior
Vickie King's first appearance on
the women's varsity team. King

attended the 1968 Olympic games
held in Mexico City as an
alternate on the United States
women's swim team and in 1969
held the national record in the
women's 500-meter free style.
"The Olympics were really
exciting for me," Vicki said.
"Being in the Olympics is very
difficult because of the extreme
pressure everyone feels, but it
wasn't too bad for me as an
alternate. It's as if we're not just
competing in sports for sports
sake, but rather as country against
country."
Malaysian Olympian
King will probably swim
distance or 200-meter freestyle in
the women's meets.
Junior Mei Ong from Malaysia
will also compete in Stanford's
varsity swim meets this year. Mei
participated in the 1972 Munich
Olympics as a member of the
Malaysian women's swim team —
training for the event as a
freshman with the Stanford men's
varsity team.
"It was a great thrill to be part
of the Olympics," Mei remarked,
"even though I didn't place it was
a real treat, and good experience."
Mei was chosen Malaysian
Woman Athlete of the Year in
1970. Her strongest events are the
100 and 200-meter backstroke
and the 200 and 400-meter
individual medley.
A few very talented new faces
and a general overall enthusiasm
mark this fall's women's varsity
swimming team, as Coach Betsy
Weeks predicts a '"winning
season."
The team's first meet will be
held tomorrow at 2:30 p.m. at
Lagunita Pool with Pacific, San
Francisco State and San Jose
State providing teh opposition.
"I believe this year's team will
have even more depth than last
year's," Weeks said. "Just from
watching practice I would guess
that we'll have all strokes covered
by experienced swimmers."
About 16 of this year's 29 women
swimmers competed on Stanford's
undefeated team last year.
