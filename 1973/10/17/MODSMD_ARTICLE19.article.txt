# Chris Finds Solace In Texas Disaster
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
It took three days, but
Stanford coach Jack Christiansen
finally found some consolation in
Saturday's 59-13 loss to UCLA.
"I guess getting beat by the
Wishbone isn't that bad,"
Christiansen said yesterday. "I'd
feel a heck of a lot worse if I'd
invented it and then got beat by
it."
Chris was referring to
Saturday's Southwest Conference
mauling in Dallas, Texas, where
Texas coach Darrell Royal had to
watch in disgust as Oklahoma
used his own invention to
embarrass the Longhorns, 52-13.
This week, though, stopping
the Wishbone will be Washington
State's problem as the Cougars
host the Bruins in Pullman. "I
wonder why Jim Sweeney [WSU
coach] hasn't called for any
advice on how to stop 'em,"
Christiansen said, laughing at his
joke but still suffering from
Saturday's debacle.
"Any time linemen can sustain
blocks so long and backs can run
so fast..Chris said, shaking
his head.
Now, of course, only Sweeney
has to worry about such things.
Christiansen is trying to forget
the Bruins and concentrate on
reversing Stanford's fortunes
against lowly Washington in
Seattle this Saturday.
"They're young like we are,"

he said of a Husky team that has
won only once in five outings.
"They lost 31 seniors last year
and 30 out of their current 50 on
the traveling squad are
sophomores or freshmen —
they're obviously making a lot of
mistakes."
Chris warned, however, that
Washington can't be taken lightly,
especially by a Cardinal team that
has been suffering from similar
spells of ineptness. "After all,"
Chris said, "they scored more
points against Cal [49] than we
have in any two of our games.
"We haven't been scoring
because we haven't made any big
plays. Our longest gains are 38
yards in the air and 25 on the
ground.
"It's getting to be just like the
pros. We've seen so many zone
defenses that it's hard to complete
passes for much yardage — it's
easy to complete the short ones,
but we haven't been able to get by
the safeties for any long gains."
Washington, which has made
occasional long gains but hasn't
moved the ball with any
consistency, should be stronger on
the ground this week. Seniors Pete
Taggares and Glen Bonner, the
Huskies' leading rushers in 1972,
are expected to start in the same
backfield for the first time this
year on Saturday. Both have
missed considerable action in
1973 because of injuries.
