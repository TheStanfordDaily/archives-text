# Beutelsbach Campus May Be Shifted
## 
### GLENN KRAMON 
Stanford may have to move its
overseas campus in Germany by
December 1974 due to "extraordinary
costs," Overseas Campuses Director
Mark Mancall announced yesterday.
However, the program will remain
in Germany, possibly moving to West
Berlin, KZSU News reported.
Stanford-In-Germany is located in
Beutelsbach, a small town of 5000,
and has suffered financially for two
major reasons, according to Mancall.
"First, the great devaluation of the
dollar in relation to the [German]
mark has sharply increased the costs of
our program. Second, the decline in
student enrollment, which is especially
sharp for two quarters per year, brings
into question the validity" of the
program itself, Mancall said.
This quarter there are only 27
students at the Beutelsbach campus.
The campus, which holds 80 students,
needs 65 in order to avoid paying
penalties, Overseas Campus Financial
Manager Don Price told KZSU News
yesterday.
$20,000
Such penalties for room and board
payments which must be made for
places even if there are no students
filling them, will amount to $20,000
this quarter alone, Price said.
Noting that the program "cannot
afford another two years of
horrendous losses," Price observed
that the Beutelsbach campus could
only exist with a subsidy from the
German government or a private grant.
Mancall commented that "in order
for us to stay in Beutelsbach, a

significant shift in the mark/dollar
ratio would be required, or the
University would have to be prepared
to cover extraordinary costs for two
more years."
Doubting both possibilities, he
pointed to a renegotiation of the
Beutelsbach contract in order to allow
the University "some freedom of
maneuverability."
'One Year's Notice'
The settlement permits the
University to cancel its contract with
Beutelsbach "with one year's notice as
of any December." The University
thus must maintain the German
campus for two more years unless it
cancels the contract by the end of this
December.
Discussion of a possible move to a
large city focuses on West Berlin.
Financial Manager Price did confirm
with KZSU that he had made tentative
contacts during a recent trip to Berlin.
"I laid some of the groundwork just in
case we did decide to move the
program there," Price said.
He noted that no such plans had
been made for other potential sites
such as Munich and Stuttgart.
Price said he believes he may be
able to get the German government to
subsidize a program in which Stanford
students live in German universities.
However, he ruled out such a

possibility for Beutelsbach.
Relocation
A special presidential commission
report on the program released in late
December of last year had
recommended the relocation of the
German Overseas Campus in either
Berlin or Munich.
Mancall also questioned the nature
of a new German program, suggesting
that a more informal program
comparable to that proposed for
Vienna might be more popular.
Since the closing of
Stanford-in-Austria at the end of
summer quarter, Austrian educational
authorities have been formulating a
program open for 30-40 students to
live and study at the University of
Vienna.
The Committee on Foreign Studies
Programs will meet with Mancall and
Price tomorrow, and later with the
German Department faculty, in an
attempt to outline a desirable
academic program for the site in
Germany.
Mancall emphasized the urgency of
deciding before December whether
and where to move the German
campus. "We welcome a
community-wide discussion of this
problem over the next two months
and hope faculty and students will
express themselves to us in a
thoughtful fashion," he said.

This quarter there are only 27
students at the Beutelsbach campus.
The campus, which holds 80 students,
needs 65 in order to avoid paying

yesterday.
$20,000
Such penalties for room and board
payments which must be made for
places even if there are no students
filling them, will amount to $20,000
this quarter alone, Price said.
Noting that the program "cannot
afford another two years of
horrendous losses," Price observed
that the Beutelsbach campus could
only exist with a subsidy from the
German government or a private grant.
Mancall commented that "in order

significant shift in the mark/dollar
ratio would be required, or the
University would have to be prepared
to cover extraordinary costs for two
more years."
Doubting both possibilities, he
pointed to a renegotiation of the
Beutelsbach contract in order to allow
the University "some freedom of
maneuverability."
'One Year's Notice'
The settlement permits the
University to cancel its contract with
Beutelsbach "with one year's notice as
of any December." The University
thus must maintain the German
campus for two more years unless it
cancels the contract by the end of this
December.
Discussion of a possible move to a
large city focuses on West Berlin.
Financial Manager Price did confirm
with KZSU that he had made tentative
contacts during a recent trip to Berlin.
"I laid some of the groundwork just in
case we did decide to move the
program there," Price said.
He noted that no such plans had
been made for other potential sites
such as Munich and Stuttgart.
Price said he believes he may be
able to get the German government to
subsidize a program in which Stanford
students live in German universities.
However, he ruled out such a

possibility for Beutelsbach.
Relocation
A special presidential commission
report on the program released in late
December of last year had
recommended the relocation of the
German Overseas Campus in either
Berlin or Munich.
Mancall also questioned the nature
of a new German program, suggesting
that a more informal program
comparable to that proposed for
Vienna might be more popular.
Since the closing of
Stanford-in-Austria at the end of
summer quarter, Austrian educational
authorities have been formulating a
program open for 30-40 students to
live and study at the University of
Vienna.
The Committee on Foreign Studies
Programs will meet with Mancall and
Price tomorrow, and later with the
German Department faculty, in an
attempt to outline a desirable
academic program for the site in
Germany.
Mancall emphasized the urgency of
deciding before December whether
and where to move the German
campus. "We welcome a
community-wide discussion of this
problem over the next two months
and hope faculty and students will
express themselves to us in a
thoughtful fashion," he said.
Stanford may have to move its
overseas campus in Germany by
December 1974 due to "extraordinary
costs," Overseas Campuses Director
Mark Mancall announced yesterday.
However, the program will remain
in Germany, possibly moving to West
Berlin, KZSU News reported.
Stanford-In-Germany is located in
Beutelsbach, a small town of 5000,
and has suffered financially for two
major reasons, according to Mancall.
