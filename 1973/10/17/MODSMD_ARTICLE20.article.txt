# Sophomore Gains National Prominence In Championship Bicycle Racing
## 
### JAY HARLOW 
Among the many nationally
recognized sports figures at
Stanford, there is one athlete
whose name and achievements are
nearly unknown. He is Dave 8011,
and he competes in championship
bicycle racing, a sport that rarely
receives mention on sports pages
but is rapidly gaining popularity
in the United States.
8011, a sophomore from
Rumson, New Jersey, has only
been racing since 1972, but has
already made his mark as a cyclist.
This summer, his first complete
season, he won the New Jersey
amateur road racing
championship, while picking up a
fourth place in the track events.
He explains the difference
between the two events as
follows: Road races are run on
open roads or city streets, over
distances of 25 to as much as 175
miles, while track races are held
on specially built banked oval
tracks.
Road events include mass-start
distance races, time trials (one
rider against the clock) and
criterium. The latter type of race

is run on a short course through
city streets, and is widespread in
Europe. Criterium racing has
become increasingly popular in
this country in recent years.
Track races include sprints,
races of less than ten miles; time
trials of various distances; and
"pursuit." In a pursuit, two riders
start on opposite sides of the
track and race for a set period of
time, each trying to catch up with
the other.
Road and track events call for
different bicycles as well. For
road racing, 801 l rides a ten-speed
Cinelli, which differs from a
normal touring bike in several
ways.
The frame is made of
lightweight, high-strength
chromemolybdenum tubing,
which makes the 20-pound bike
several pounds lighter than a
touring bike. The bike is almost
complete handcrafted, and made
to much stricter tolerances than
mass-production machines. This
primarily accounts for the prices
of racing bikes, which range from
$350 for a "decent" bike to $800
for "a few of the very best."

Track bikes are generally even
lighter. Some top international
racers are currently riding
titanium-alloy frames, some of
which run as light as 12 pounds. A
track bike is single-speed,
brakeless, and fixed-gear (no
casting), with a more upright
frame. Everything on the bike is
designed for going flat out over
relatively short distances.
801 l began racing during the
1972 season, but missed a good
part of the season due to a knee
injury. Bike racing is nearly
accident-free, but according to
Dave, "the most dangerous thing
about racing is training on the
road." He rides every day on
roads and streets in the Stanford
area, and has had several close
calls with automobiles.
"Drivers just have no idea how
fast a bike can go," he says, citing
the recurring example of being
knocked down by right-turning
cars whose drivers misjudged his
speed.
Training Essential
Regular training, however, is
essential. In order to maintain
speeds of 25 miles per hour in

road races and 30 miles per hour
on the track, Dave rides every
day, all year long as weather
permits.
The California racing season
lasts from April to October, and
Dave races at least once a week
throughout the season. Often
there are several races in a given
week in the immediate area.
Among these is a weekly
"twilight" criterium series of
evening races in an industrial area
of Mountain View.
Currently, Dave races for the
Century Racing Club of America,
the nation's largest bike club.
Dave is one of 17 individual state
champions in the club, which also
includes a three-time national
champ and three 1972 Olumpic
team members.
Riders who place in the state
championships, like Dave, qualify
for the U.S. Olympic and Pan
American Games trials. Asked
about his prospects of making the
teams in 1975 and 1976, he
replied, "I think I have a chance."
He added that he is not content
with the present emphasis on
nationalism in the Olympics, "but
I'd certainly like to go."

EASY RIDER — Stanford sophomore Dave 801 l (foreground) cruises along a local street during the Palo
Alto criterium last May. 8011, who won the New Jersey Road Racing Championships this summer, has
gained national prominence in cycling even though he has competed only one full season.
Among the many nationally
recognized sports figures at
Stanford, there is one athlete
whose name and achievements are
nearly unknown. He is Dave 8011,
and he competes in championship
bicycle racing, a sport that rarely
receives mention on sports pages
but is rapidly gaining popularity
in the United States.
8011, a sophomore from
Rumson, New Jersey, has only
been racing since 1972, but has
already made his mark as a cyclist.
This summer, his first complete
season, he won the New Jersey
amateur road racing
championship, while picking up a
fourth place in the track events.
He explains the difference
between the two events as
follows: Road races are run on
open roads or city streets, over
distances of 25 to as much as 175
miles, while track races are held
on specially built banked oval
tracks.
Road events include mass-start
distance races, time trials (one
rider against the clock) and
criterium. The latter type of race

is run on a short course through
city streets, and is widespread in
Europe. Criterium racing has
become increasingly popular in
this country in recent years.
Track races include sprints,
races of less than ten miles; time
trials of various distances; and
"pursuit." In a pursuit, two riders
start on opposite sides of the
track and race for a set period of
time, each trying to catch up with
the other.
Road and track events call for
different bicycles as well. For
road racing, 801 l rides a ten-speed
Cinelli, which differs from a
normal touring bike in several
ways.
The frame is made of
lightweight, high-strength
chromemolybdenum tubing,
which makes the 20-pound bike
several pounds lighter than a
touring bike. The bike is almost
complete handcrafted, and made
to much stricter tolerances than
mass-production machines. This
primarily accounts for the prices
of racing bikes, which range from
$350 for a "decent" bike to $800
for "a few of the very best."

Track bikes are generally even
lighter. Some top international
racers are currently riding
titanium-alloy frames, some of
which run as light as 12 pounds. A
track bike is single-speed,
brakeless, and fixed-gear (no
casting), with a more upright
frame. Everything on the bike is
designed for going flat out over
relatively short distances.
801 l began racing during the
1972 season, but missed a good
part of the season due to a knee
injury. Bike racing is nearly
accident-free, but according to
Dave, "the most dangerous thing
about racing is training on the
road." He rides every day on
roads and streets in the Stanford
area, and has had several close
calls with automobiles.
"Drivers just have no idea how
fast a bike can go," he says, citing
the recurring example of being
knocked down by right-turning
cars whose drivers misjudged his
speed.
Training Essential
Regular training, however, is
essential. In order to maintain
speeds of 25 miles per hour in

road races and 30 miles per hour
on the track, Dave rides every
day, all year long as weather
permits.
The California racing season
lasts from April to October, and
Dave races at least once a week
throughout the season. Often
there are several races in a given
week in the immediate area.
Among these is a weekly
"twilight" criterium series of
evening races in an industrial area
of Mountain View.
Currently, Dave races for the
Century Racing Club of America,
the nation's largest bike club.
Dave is one of 17 individual state
champions in the club, which also
includes a three-time national
champ and three 1972 Olumpic
team members.
Riders who place in the state
championships, like Dave, qualify
for the U.S. Olympic and Pan
American Games trials. Asked
about his prospects of making the
teams in 1975 and 1976, he
replied, "I think I have a chance."
He added that he is not content
with the present emphasis on
nationalism in the Olympics, "but
I'd certainly like to go."
