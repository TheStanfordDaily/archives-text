## Annoying Fans Watch Inept Seals 
### Don Tollefson 
Feeling in a somewhat masochistic mood
last Friday night, I decided to forego a round
of pre-UCLA parties in favor of enduring a
California Seals hockey game. For the
uninitiated, the Seals are the team which
Oakland A's owner Charlie Finley really
deserves. In recent seasons, Finley's
incompetent icemen have been the butt of
most National Hockey League jokes.
With the Chicago Black Hawks providing
the opposition, Friday night's game promised
to be more of a rout than Saturday's football
follies in Stanford Stadium turned out to be.
In fact, if I'd had a few more beers before
face-off, I probably would have been willing
to bet on the Hawks and give 59 goals.
I should have known something was wrong
when Finley, that sports tyrant par
excellence, was noticeably absent from the
evening's festivities. But as with the A's, the
farther Finley gets away, the better his Seals
perform. With Finley home in bed dreaming
of bigger and better ways to screw his
frank-mouthed baseballers, the Seals went out
and did the unmentionable. They played a
competent hockey game and held off the
slow-starting Hawks for a shocking 3-2 win.
But it was not this completely unexpected
outcome which was the most interesting facet
of the night's events. As it turned out, much
of my attention during the game was focused
off the ice and into the stands. For among the
sparse crowd attending the contest was an
incredibly wide variety of sports fan types. It
was a sport sociologist's dream.
Undivided Attention
Being an avid sports fan seems to be almost
a prerequisite for citizenship in our society.
Ours is an incredibly diverse and pluralistic
society, constantly embroiled in controversy
and conflict. But as if they were religious

holidays, every World Series or Super Bowl
commands the undivided attention of untold
millions who universally put aside their cares
and concerns for a few hours. A brilliant
military strategist would pass up a Christmas
Day attack on this country in favor of one on
"Super Bow! Sunday.
Given the pervasiveness of sports fans in
our society, we sometimes forget that all
sports fans are not alike. The stereotype of
the pot-bellied fan who balances his six-pack
on his stomach while sitting in front of the
TV all weekend long is unfortunately accurate
all too often. But these weekend worshippers
are nowhere near as obnoxious or offensive as
some of the people in attendance at that Seals
game.
Perhaps the worst kind of sports fan is the
loud-mouthed prankster who backs up his
words with imbecile actions. These are the
ones who thrive on throwing things at players
and who are constantly trying to provoke a
major brawl. A good half dozen of this variety
sat in front of me at the Seals game.
More than one hockey player has died as a
result of slipping on foreign objects on the ice,
but this fact did not at all dissuade the
morons in front of me who were trying to
impress the assembled females in the audiece
by blowing small sticks and other debris onto
the ice through a lead pipe. I hope they found
some little old ladies to mug on the way
home.
Injure and Impress
Less dangerous, but more frequent and
almost as obnoxious are the fans who never
shut their mouths, but who at least stop short
of trying to injure athletes they are obviously
jealous of. These types are usually trying to
impress some newfound companion or
because they are without one, are trying to

annoy someone who has one. These fans
usually have a four word, monosyllabic
vocabulary and they never violate the cardinal
rule against uttering more than two
non-obscenities in a row.
Obviously these fan categories overlap to
some degree and many fans move from
category to category during a game as their
alcoholic intake climbs. But there is one type
of fan, found in all categories, who has always
truck me as an incredible paradox. I am
talking about the obese sports fan.
I am always amazed at the fatties who
know every fact and figure about teams and
players, but who are the complete antithesis
of much of what an athlete stands for. I am
bewildered at how they can sit through
athletic events day in and day out and watch
physically fit athletes while stuffing their
faces. These fans are the ultimate
personification of a spectator-crazy society
obsessed with vicarious thrills.
Athletics are fun to watch, but I will
always contend they are more fun to
participate in. True sports fans will almost
always pass up an athletic event if they can
participate in a good touch football game
instead. Watching athletic events should
constantly renew a person's belief in the value
of participating in athletics.
True sports fans appreciate a good
performance, irregardless of whose it is. True
sports fans enjoy good hard-fought,
competitive contests, but they abhor actions
designed to purposely injure other human
beings. True sports fans believe that sports
must be kept in perspective in a society which
is still too full of suffering and injustice. But
sometimes I wonder if true sports fans are in
an unfortunately small minority. Friday's
Seals game did little to dispel that doubt.

the pot-bellied fan who balances his six-pack
on his stomach while sitting in front of the
TV all weekend long is unfortunately accurate
all too often. But these weekend worshippers
are nowhere near as obnoxious or offensive as
some of the people in attendance at that Seals
game.
Perhaps the worst kind of sports fan is the
loud-mouthed prankster who backs up his
words with imbecile actions. These are the
ones who thrive on throwing things at players
and who are constantly trying to provoke a
major brawl. A good half dozen of this variety
sat in front of me at the Seals game.
More than one hockey player has died as a
result of slipping on foreign objects on the ice,
but this fact did not at all dissuade the
morons in front of me who were trying to
impress the assembled females in the audiece
by blowing small sticks and other debris onto
the ice through a lead pipe. I hope they found
some little old ladies to mug on the way
home.
Injure and Impress
Less dangerous, but more frequent and
almost as obnoxious are the fans who never
shut their mouths, but who at least stop short
of trying to injure athletes they are obviously
jealous of. These types are usually trying to
impress some newfound companion or
because they are without one, are trying to

annoy someone who has one. These fans
usually have a four word, monosyllabic
vocabulary and they never violate the cardinal
rule against uttering more than two
non-obscenities in a row.
Obviously these fan categories overlap to
some degree and many fans move from
category to category during a game as their
alcoholic intake climbs. But there is one type
of fan, found in all categories, who has always
truck me as an incredible paradox. I am
talking about the obese sports fan.
I am always amazed at the fatties who
know every fact and figure about teams and
players, but who are the complete antithesis
of much of what an athlete stands for. I am
bewildered at how they can sit through
athletic events day in and day out and watch
physically fit athletes while stuffing their
faces. These fans are the ultimate
personification of a spectator-crazy society
obsessed with vicarious thrills.
Athletics are fun to watch, but I will
always contend they are more fun to
participate in. True sports fans will almost
always pass up an athletic event if they can
participate in a good touch football game
instead. Watching athletic events should
constantly renew a person's belief in the value
of participating in athletics.
True sports fans appreciate a good
performance, irregardless of whose it is. True
sports fans enjoy good hard-fought,
competitive contests, but they abhor actions
designed to purposely injure other human
beings. True sports fans believe that sports
must be kept in perspective in a society which
is still too full of suffering and injustice. But
sometimes I wonder if true sports fans are in
an unfortunately small minority. Friday's
Seals game did little to dispel that doubt.
Feeling in a somewhat masochistic mood
last Friday night, I decided to forego a round
of pre-UCLA parties in favor of enduring a
California Seals hockey game. For the
uninitiated, the Seals are the team which
Oakland A's owner Charlie Finley really
deserves. In recent seasons, Finley's
incompetent icemen have been the butt of
most National Hockey League jokes.
With the Chicago Black Hawks providing
the opposition, Friday night's game promised
to be more of a rout than Saturday's football
follies in Stanford Stadium turned out to be.
In fact, if I'd had a few more beers before
face-off, I probably would have been willing
to bet on the Hawks and give 59 goals.
I should have known something was wrong
when Finley, that sports tyrant par
excellence, was noticeably absent from the
evening's festivities. But as with the A's, the
farther Finley gets away, the better his Seals
perform. With Finley home in bed dreaming
of bigger and better ways to screw his
frank-mouthed baseballers, the Seals went out
and did the unmentionable. They played a
competent hockey game and held off the
slow-starting Hawks for a shocking 3-2 win.
But it was not this completely unexpected
outcome which was the most interesting facet
of the night's events. As it turned out, much
of my attention during the game was focused
off the ice and into the stands. For among the
sparse crowd attending the contest was an
incredibly wide variety of sports fan types. It
was a sport sociologist's dream.
Undivided Attention
Being an avid sports fan seems to be almost
a prerequisite for citizenship in our society.
Ours is an incredibly diverse and pluralistic
society, constantly embroiled in controversy
and conflict. But as if they were religious

holidays, every World Series or Super Bowl
commands the undivided attention of untold
millions who universally put aside their cares
and concerns for a few hours. A brilliant
military strategist would pass up a Christmas
Day attack on this country in favor of one on
"Super Bow! Sunday.

always contend they are more fun to
participate in. True sports fans will almost
always pass up an athletic event if they can
participate in a good touch football game
instead. Watching athletic events should
constantly renew a person's belief in the value
of participating in athletics.
True sports fans appreciate a good
performance, irregardless of whose it is. True
sports fans enjoy good hard-fought,
competitive contests, but they abhor actions
designed to purposely injure other human
beings. True sports fans believe that sports
must be kept in perspective in a society which
is still too full of suffering and injustice. But
sometimes I wonder if true sports fans are in
an unfortunately small minority. Friday's
Seals game did little to dispel that doubt.
Feeling in a somewhat masochistic mood
last Friday night, I decided to forego a round
of pre-UCLA parties in favor of enduring a
California Seals hockey game. For the
uninitiated, the Seals are the team which
Oakland A's owner Charlie Finley really
deserves. In recent seasons, Finley's
incompetent icemen have been the butt of
most National Hockey League jokes.
With the Chicago Black Hawks providing
the opposition, Friday night's game promised
to be more of a rout than Saturday's football
follies in Stanford Stadium turned out to be.
In fact, if I'd had a few more beers before
face-off, I probably would have been willing
to bet on the Hawks and give 59 goals.
I should have known something was wrong
when Finley, that sports tyrant par
excellence, was noticeably absent from the
evening's festivities. But as with the A's, the
farther Finley gets away, the better his Seals
perform. With Finley home in bed dreaming
of bigger and better ways to screw his
frank-mouthed baseballers, the Seals went out
and did the unmentionable. They played a
competent hockey game and held off the
slow-starting Hawks for a shocking 3-2 win.
But it was not this completely unexpected
outcome which was the most interesting facet
of the night's events. As it turned out, much
of my attention during the game was focused
off the ice and into the stands. For among the
sparse crowd attending the contest was an
incredibly wide variety of sports fan types. It
was a sport sociologist's dream.
Undivided Attention
Being an avid sports fan seems to be almost
a prerequisite for citizenship in our society.
Ours is an incredibly diverse and pluralistic
society, constantly embroiled in controversy
and conflict. But as if they were religious

holidays, every World Series or Super Bowl
commands the undivided attention of untold
millions who universally put aside their cares
and concerns for a few hours. A brilliant
military strategist would pass up a Christmas
Day attack on this country in favor of one on
"Super Bow! Sunday.
Given the pervasiveness of sports fans in
our society, we sometimes forget that all
sports fans are not alike. The stereotype of
the pot-bellied fan who balances his six-pack
on his stomach while sitting in front of the
TV all weekend long is unfortunately accurate
all too often. But these weekend worshippers
are nowhere near as obnoxious or offensive as
some of the people in attendance at that Seals
game.
Perhaps the worst kind of sports fan is the
loud-mouthed prankster who backs up his
words with imbecile actions. These are the
ones who thrive on throwing things at players
and who are constantly trying to provoke a
major brawl. A good half dozen of this variety
sat in front of me at the Seals game.
More than one hockey player has died as a
result of slipping on foreign objects on the ice,
but this fact did not at all dissuade the
morons in front of me who were trying to
impress the assembled females in the audiece
by blowing small sticks and other debris onto
the ice through a lead pipe. I hope they found
some little old ladies to mug on the way
home.
Injure and Impress
Less dangerous, but more frequent and
almost as obnoxious are the fans who never
shut their mouths, but who at least stop short
of trying to injure athletes they are obviously
jealous of. These types are usually trying to
impress some newfound companion or
because they are without one, are trying to

annoy someone who has one. These fans
usually have a four word, monosyllabic
vocabulary and they never violate the cardinal
rule against uttering more than two
non-obscenities in a row.
Obviously these fan categories overlap to
some degree and many fans move from
category to category during a game as their
alcoholic intake climbs. But there is one type
of fan, found in all categories, who has always
truck me as an incredible paradox. I am
talking about the obese sports fan.
I am always amazed at the fatties who
know every fact and figure about teams and
players, but who are the complete antithesis
of much of what an athlete stands for. I am
bewildered at how they can sit through
athletic events day in and day out and watch
physically fit athletes while stuffing their
faces. These fans are the ultimate
personification of a spectator-crazy society
obsessed with vicarious thrills.
Athletics are fun to watch, but I will
always contend they are more fun to
participate in. True sports fans will almost
always pass up an athletic event if they can
participate in a good touch football game
instead. Watching athletic events should
constantly renew a person's belief in the value
