Atlanta Elects Black Mayor
ATLANTA, Ga. — Black challenger Maynard Jackson
won a bitterly contested mayoral runoff election against
incumbent Sam Massell yesterday to become the first
black mayor of a major southern city in modern times.
Jackson, elected vice mayor four years ago, had been
the favorite since he swamped 10 other candidates in the
general election Oct. 2 but fell just short of the majority
needed for election.
Unofficial returns from all of the city's 193 precincts
gave Jackson 73,603 votes and Massell 49,300. Some
2600 absentee ballots remained to be tabulated.
In the race for president of the city council, white
moderate Wyche Fowler easily defeated black civil rights
activist Hosea Williams 75,799 to 43,693.
Not only will the city's top leadership be biracial, it
also will be one of the youngest in history. Jackson is 35
and Fowler is 33.
Fowler will preside over a predominantly black city
council. Blacks won 13 of the 18 seats. Blacks also
captured at least five seats on trie nine-member school
board.
Most Americans Support Israel
PRINCETON, N.J. - A Gallup Poll on the Middle East
conflict indicates that 47 percent of all Americans support
Israel and 6 percent favor the Arab cause.
Another 22 percent back neither side while 25 percent
expressed no opinion, the poll showed.
A spokesman said it was unusual to have such a large
number of persons with no opinion, and he expressed the
belief that the figure may reflect a reluctance on the part
of many Americans to see the United States become
embroiled in another war.
Judge Withdraws IBM-Telex Decision
TULSA, Okla. — U.S. District Court Judge A. Sherman
Christensen yesterday withdrew his $352.5 million
antitrust judgment against International Business
Machines Corp.
Christensen said he plans to set a lower figure later. He
said the record of the lengthy trial earlier this year
provided insufficient information on which to set a new
damage total to be awarded the Telex Corp., which had
charged IBM with monopolistic practices.
Last week Christensen had said the large judgment for
Telex that he issued last month had substantial errors.
Offshore Drilling May Begin In Gulf
WASHINGTON — Faced with a growing energy crisis,
the United States is preparing to open the eastern Gulf of
Mexico to oil exploration to boost domestic production.
The Interior Department plans to permit offshore
drilling despite environmentalists' warnings that oil spills
could ruin beaches that attract tourists and fears that
discovery of oil could force military base closings.
The beaches and bases provide important revenue for

local communities along the eastern Gulf.
The U.S. Geological Survey believes the area has
between two billion and three billion barrels of oil and
production potential of up to 590,000 barrels daily. That
is about half as much oil as is being pumped off the
Louisiana and Texas Coasts.
The Interior Department has indicated it will accept oil
company bids in December for drilling rights on more
than 800,000 acres of the Gulf off the Florida, Mississippi
and Alabama coasts.
Gene Krupa Dies
YONKERS, N.Y. — Gene Krupa, king of hot jazz
drummers, died yesterday at his home here. He was 64.
He had been released a week ago from Yonkers General
Hospital, where he was treated for leukemia.
A 1959 movie called 'The Gene Krupa Story," starring
Sal Mineo as Krupa, told of Krupa's career from his
Chicago beginnings around 1927 to 1943, when he made a
comeback after serving a prison term for possession of
marijuana.
Senate Asks IRS For Ford Audit
WASHINGTON — The Senate Rules Committee
yesterday asked for an Internal Revenue Service audit of
Vice President-designate Gerald R. Ford's income tax
returns.
Chairman Howard W. Cannon, D-Nev., said the
committee also is seeking access to Ford's tax returns for
the last seven years, a period coinciding with his service as
House Republican leader.
Cannon told newsmen these are part of the background
material the committee wants for its public hearings on
Ford's nomination to replace Spiro T. Agnew, who
resigned as vice president last week.
No date was set for the start of the hearings, but
Cannon said his guess is that they would begin about Oct.
30 or 31.
Ford already has said he would make his tax returns
available, along with a statement of his financial affairs.
He has said he owns no stocks or bonds other than $9000
of debentures in a business that was family owned.

won a bitterly contested mayoral runoff election against
incumbent Sam Massell yesterday to become the first
black mayor of a major southern city in modern times.
Jackson, elected vice mayor four years ago, had been
the favorite since he swamped 10 other candidates in the
general election Oct. 2 but fell just short of the majority
needed for election.
Unofficial returns from all of the city's 193 precincts
gave Jackson 73,603 votes and Massell 49,300. Some
2600 absentee ballots remained to be tabulated.
In the race for president of the city council, white
moderate Wyche Fowler easily defeated black civil rights
activist Hosea Williams 75,799 to 43,693.
Not only will the city's top leadership be biracial, it
also will be one of the youngest in history. Jackson is 35
and Fowler is 33.
Fowler will preside over a predominantly black city
council. Blacks won 13 of the 18 seats. Blacks also
captured at least five seats on trie nine-member school
board.
Most Americans Support Israel
PRINCETON, N.J. - A Gallup Poll on the Middle East
conflict indicates that 47 percent of all Americans support
Israel and 6 percent favor the Arab cause.
Another 22 percent back neither side while 25 percent
expressed no opinion, the poll showed.
A spokesman said it was unusual to have such a large
number of persons with no opinion, and he expressed the
belief that the figure may reflect a reluctance on the part
of many Americans to see the United States become
embroiled in another war.
Judge Withdraws IBM-Telex Decision
TULSA, Okla. — U.S. District Court Judge A. Sherman
Christensen yesterday withdrew his $352.5 million
antitrust judgment against International Business
Machines Corp.
Christensen said he plans to set a lower figure later. He
said the record of the lengthy trial earlier this year
provided insufficient information on which to set a new
damage total to be awarded the Telex Corp., which had
charged IBM with monopolistic practices.
Last week Christensen had said the large judgment for
Telex that he issued last month had substantial errors.
Offshore Drilling May Begin In Gulf
WASHINGTON — Faced with a growing energy crisis,
the United States is preparing to open the eastern Gulf of
Mexico to oil exploration to boost domestic production.
The Interior Department plans to permit offshore
drilling despite environmentalists' warnings that oil spills
could ruin beaches that attract tourists and fears that
discovery of oil could force military base closings.
The beaches and bases provide important revenue for

local communities along the eastern Gulf.
The U.S. Geological Survey believes the area has
between two billion and three billion barrels of oil and
production potential of up to 590,000 barrels daily. That
is about half as much oil as is being pumped off the
Louisiana and Texas Coasts.
The Interior Department has indicated it will accept oil
company bids in December for drilling rights on more
than 800,000 acres of the Gulf off the Florida, Mississippi
and Alabama coasts.
Gene Krupa Dies
YONKERS, N.Y. — Gene Krupa, king of hot jazz
drummers, died yesterday at his home here. He was 64.
He had been released a week ago from Yonkers General
Hospital, where he was treated for leukemia.
A 1959 movie called 'The Gene Krupa Story," starring
Sal Mineo as Krupa, told of Krupa's career from his
Chicago beginnings around 1927 to 1943, when he made a
comeback after serving a prison term for possession of
marijuana.
Senate Asks IRS For Ford Audit
WASHINGTON — The Senate Rules Committee
yesterday asked for an Internal Revenue Service audit of
Vice President-designate Gerald R. Ford's income tax
returns.
Chairman Howard W. Cannon, D-Nev., said the
committee also is seeking access to Ford's tax returns for
the last seven years, a period coinciding with his service as
House Republican leader.
Cannon told newsmen these are part of the background
material the committee wants for its public hearings on
Ford's nomination to replace Spiro T. Agnew, who
resigned as vice president last week.
No date was set for the start of the hearings, but
Cannon said his guess is that they would begin about Oct.
30 or 31.
Ford already has said he would make his tax returns
available, along with a statement of his financial affairs.
He has said he owns no stocks or bonds other than $9000
of debentures in a business that was family owned.

black mayor of a major southern city in modern times.
Jackson, elected vice mayor four years ago, had been
the favorite since he swamped 10 other candidates in the
general election Oct. 2 but fell just short of the majority
needed for election.
Unofficial returns from all of the city's 193 precincts
gave Jackson 73,603 votes and Massell 49,300. Some
2600 absentee ballots remained to be tabulated.
In the race for president of the city council, white
moderate Wyche Fowler easily defeated black civil rights
activist Hosea Williams 75,799 to 43,693.
Not only will the city's top leadership be biracial, it
also will be one of the youngest in history. Jackson is 35
and Fowler is 33.
Fowler will preside over a predominantly black city
council. Blacks won 13 of the 18 seats. Blacks also
captured at least five seats on trie nine-member school
board.
Most Americans Support Israel
PRINCETON, N.J. - A Gallup Poll on the Middle East
conflict indicates that 47 percent of all Americans support
Israel and 6 percent favor the Arab cause.
Another 22 percent back neither side while 25 percent
expressed no opinion, the poll showed.
A spokesman said it was unusual to have such a large
number of persons with no opinion, and he expressed the
belief that the figure may reflect a reluctance on the part
of many Americans to see the United States become
embroiled in another war.
Judge Withdraws IBM-Telex Decision
TULSA, Okla. — U.S. District Court Judge A. Sherman
Christensen yesterday withdrew his $352.5 million
antitrust judgment against International Business
Machines Corp.
Christensen said he plans to set a lower figure later. He
said the record of the lengthy trial earlier this year
provided insufficient information on which to set a new
damage total to be awarded the Telex Corp., which had
charged IBM with monopolistic practices.
Last week Christensen had said the large judgment for
Telex that he issued last month had substantial errors.
Offshore Drilling May Begin In Gulf
WASHINGTON — Faced with a growing energy crisis,
the United States is preparing to open the eastern Gulf of
Mexico to oil exploration to boost domestic production.
The Interior Department plans to permit offshore
drilling despite environmentalists' warnings that oil spills
could ruin beaches that attract tourists and fears that
discovery of oil could force military base closings.
The beaches and bases provide important revenue for

local communities along the eastern Gulf.
The U.S. Geological Survey believes the area has
between two billion and three billion barrels of oil and
production potential of up to 590,000 barrels daily. That
is about half as much oil as is being pumped off the
Louisiana and Texas Coasts.
The Interior Department has indicated it will accept oil
company bids in December for drilling rights on more
than 800,000 acres of the Gulf off the Florida, Mississippi
and Alabama coasts.
Gene Krupa Dies
YONKERS, N.Y. — Gene Krupa, king of hot jazz
drummers, died yesterday at his home here. He was 64.
He had been released a week ago from Yonkers General
Hospital, where he was treated for leukemia.
A 1959 movie called 'The Gene Krupa Story," starring
Sal Mineo as Krupa, told of Krupa's career from his
Chicago beginnings around 1927 to 1943, when he made a
comeback after serving a prison term for possession of
marijuana.
Senate Asks IRS For Ford Audit
WASHINGTON — The Senate Rules Committee
yesterday asked for an Internal Revenue Service audit of
Vice President-designate Gerald R. Ford's income tax
returns.
Chairman Howard W. Cannon, D-Nev., said the
committee also is seeking access to Ford's tax returns for
the last seven years, a period coinciding with his service as
House Republican leader.
Cannon told newsmen these are part of the background
material the committee wants for its public hearings on
Ford's nomination to replace Spiro T. Agnew, who
resigned as vice president last week.
No date was set for the start of the hearings, but
Cannon said his guess is that they would begin about Oct.
30 or 31.
Ford already has said he would make his tax returns
available, along with a statement of his financial affairs.
He has said he owns no stocks or bonds other than $9000
of debentures in a business that was family owned.
