# University Officials Study Fate Of On-Campus Pub
## 
### BILL WEINSTEIN 
Little Inland's Pub may become a
reality, provided that its backers can
convince Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons, President Richard
Lyman, the Board of Trustees and the
California Alcoholic Beverage Control
Commission (ABC) that it is a good
idea.
A campaign promise of the present
ASSU officers, the restaurant would
serve "hamburgers, hot dogs, hot
sandwiches, submarines, ice cream and
perhaps some kind of pizza," at the
renovated Encina Snack Bar, according
to ASSU vice president Jim Friend.
Initially no alcoholic beverages
would be sold at the pub, but Friend
hopes to procure a beer and wine
license from ABC. As Skip Mclntyre,
president of Tout de Suite Inc., which
will operate the pub said, "The pub
would be much more viable with beer
than without it."
Lyons Approval
The pub's existence rests in large
part on the approval of it by Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons. Lyons
said that before permission was
granted to go ahead with the project,
however, "a plan and study had to be
made of the whole pub idea, including
alternatives" and that plan had to be
submitted to him.
The proposal also needs to stipulate
the costs involved in the project, a

market analysis of the demand for the
restaurant and whether a beer license
was essential to the success of the pub,
Lyons added.
"So far I've seen a lot of studies
[on the restaurant] but no hard
analytical thinking yet," Lyons stated.
Questioned as to whether an actual
proposal had been submitted to
Lyons, Friend responded "We are in
the process of putting together a
packet which will be submitted to the
dean in a week or week and a half."
In Encina
The plan will recommend that the
pub be located in the Encina Snack
bar which will be refurbished at an
estimated cost of $25,000. The
restaurant would be staffed by
students with the possible exception
of a non-student manager. Friend said
that while the proposal's name was
Little Leland's Pub the actual name
had not yet been decided on.
The financial success and ultimately
the existence of the pub itself
apparently hinges on the acquisition of
a beer and wine license. Lyons
summarized the issue when he said,
"socially and economically you cannot
have a pub without beer."
Acknowledging the problem,
Friend said "the difficulty is whether
we can convince the ABC of the
necessary controls to keep minors out
of the part of the restaurant that will
serve wine or alcohol."
Friend, however, did not anticipate
any objections to a beer and wine
license from the University. Lyons
tended to agree by saying "the beer
issue is not the key issue, it is whether
the pub is economically feasible."
Assuming that Lyons approves
Friend's report, the Pub would still
have to be approved by President
Lyman and then the Board of
Trustees. But James Siena, special
counsel to the president, expressed the
feeling that the pub would probably
be approved explaining that "we don't
need the Board of Trustees' approval
of minor operational changes."
Neither Friend, Lyons, Siena nor
Mclntyre would predict if and when
the pub would become a realty, but as
Siena stated, "If there are valid
economic and social considerations,
and no legal problems, it [the pub]
should go ahead."

Little Leland's Pub the actual name
had not yet been decided on.
The financial success and ultimately
the existence of the pub itself
apparently hinges on the acquisition of
a beer and wine license. Lyons
summarized the issue when he said,
"socially and economically you cannot
have a pub without beer."
Acknowledging the problem,
Friend said "the difficulty is whether
we can convince the ABC of the
necessary controls to keep minors out
of the part of the restaurant that will
serve wine or alcohol."
Friend, however, did not anticipate
any objections to a beer and wine
license from the University. Lyons
tended to agree by saying "the beer
issue is not the key issue, it is whether
the pub is economically feasible."
Assuming that Lyons approves
Friend's report, the Pub would still
have to be approved by President
Lyman and then the Board of
Trustees. But James Siena, special
counsel to the president, expressed the
feeling that the pub would probably
be approved explaining that "we don't
need the Board of Trustees' approval
of minor operational changes."
Neither Friend, Lyons, Siena nor
Mclntyre would predict if and when
the pub would become a realty, but as
Siena stated, "If there are valid
economic and social considerations,
and no legal problems, it [the pub]
should go ahead."
Little Inland's Pub may become a
reality, provided that its backers can
convince Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons, President Richard
Lyman, the Board of Trustees and the
California Alcoholic Beverage Control
Commission (ABC) that it is a good
idea.
A campaign promise of the present
ASSU officers, the restaurant would
serve "hamburgers, hot dogs, hot
sandwiches, submarines, ice cream and
perhaps some kind of pizza," at the
renovated Encina Snack Bar, according
to ASSU vice president Jim Friend.
Initially no alcoholic beverages
would be sold at the pub, but Friend
hopes to procure a beer and wine
license from ABC. As Skip Mclntyre,
president of Tout de Suite Inc., which
will operate the pub said, "The pub
would be much more viable with beer
than without it."
Lyons Approval
The pub's existence rests in large
part on the approval of it by Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons. Lyons
said that before permission was
granted to go ahead with the project,
however, "a plan and study had to be
made of the whole pub idea, including
alternatives" and that plan had to be
submitted to him.
The proposal also needs to stipulate
the costs involved in the project, a

market analysis of the demand for the
restaurant and whether a beer license
was essential to the success of the pub,
Lyons added.
"So far I've seen a lot of studies
[on the restaurant] but no hard
analytical thinking yet," Lyons stated.
Questioned as to whether an actual
proposal had been submitted to
Lyons, Friend responded "We are in
the process of putting together a
packet which will be submitted to the
dean in a week or week and a half."
In Encina
The plan will recommend that the
pub be located in the Encina Snack
bar which will be refurbished at an
estimated cost of $25,000. The
restaurant would be staffed by
students with the possible exception
of a non-student manager. Friend said
that while the proposal's name was

had not yet been decided on.
