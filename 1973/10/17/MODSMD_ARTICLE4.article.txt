## Lyman: CJP Revision Unlikely 
### JOHN FREED 
Revision of the Campus Judicial
Panel (CJP) is unlikely, according to
Pres. Richard Lyman, following a
crushing defeat by students of a
proposed alternative judicial system.
Lyman, responding to questions
from Daily and KZSU newsmen, said
that general agreement on a new
judicial setup is improbable.
"We're not likely, under present
circumstances, to reach a consensus
that will be approved by all the
constituencies," specifically, students.

faculty and administration. He sees
another year of study on the topic by
the Committee of 15 as unfruitful.
"The work in each case has
produced, inevitably, a very
complicated compromise which is
easily attacked .. . because it's
complicated," Lyman observed. "I
don't think that another year of
deliberations by the Committee of 15,
followed by another referendum, is
going to produce a different result."
Nevertheless, Lyman may institute
changes in the present CJP, though he
says he has nothing definite planned.
"I don't contemplate any changes
in the sense that I've got a list of
changes. I'm not averse to thinking
about the subject now," Lyman
concluded.
"I think it would be logical to take
a fresh look at it (the CJP)," he said
Lyman, speaking on KZSU's
Campus Conference, broadcast
yesterday, touched on other current
issues including tax reform laws,
expanding payroll deductions to
charities for employees, and the
Stanford-Palo Alto Liaison
Committee.
Lyman said that certain tax reform
proposals would financially cripple
Stanford and other private universities.
He drew a distinction between valid
tax reform and the arbitrary
elimination of charitable donation
deductions.
"I think ... there's a lot of
confusion between tax
loopholes .. . and the charitable
deduction provisions," Lyman
claimed.
Lyman said the administration has
contacted the Santa Clara County
United Fund and the Bay Area
Combined Health Agencies Drive
(CHAD) in efforts to make a joint
effort to solicit Stanford employees.
"We thought it was very important
to try to preserve the basic idea behind
the United Fund, which is a single
campaign, rather than a multiplication
of campaigns," Lyman asserted.
He hotly denied a report in
Monday's Daily that spokesmen from
CHAD and the United Fund had never
hoard of a plan to unify their

Stanford-oriented campaigns.
"They have heard of it to the
extent it exists .... We hoped they
would find ways of getting together.
We have written them this and we have
told them that," Lyman protested.
Secrecy of meetings of the
Stanford-Palo Alto Liaison Committee
has been still another source of
controversy. Lyman said that Vice
President Robert Augsburger is
"discussing" a possible compromise
which would make the committee's
meetings more open.
