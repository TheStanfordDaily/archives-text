# State Department Foresees No Middle East Combat Role
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The State
Department said yesterday the United
States does not intend to send
American combat forces to the Middle
East.
However, Marines in full battle gear
boarded the U.S. helicopter carrier
Iwo Jima yesterday and the vessel
sailed for the Mediterranean to join
the Navy's 6th Fleet.
The carrier departed at 3:10 p.m.
(PDT) after boarding troops through
much of the day.
It was also learned, the ongoing
U.S. shipment of jet airplanes, tanks
and other weapons to Israel may
eventually equal the massive Soviet
shipments to Egypt and Syria or even
exceed them.
"We will be guided by what Israel's
military needs are," said Robert J.
McCloskey, the State Department

spokesman, in regard to Washington's
resupply plans.
Officials said Moscow has ferried
some 5000 tons of equipment to
Egypt and Syria in 300 flights during
one week. The U.S. airlift amounted in
its first two days, to about one-tenth
that amount.
Nixon Meeting
Meanwhile, President Nixon agreed
to receive four Arab foreign ministers
at the White House today.
They are Abdel Aziz Bouteflika of
Algeria, Sabah al-Sabah of Kuwait,
Ahmed Taibi Benhima of Morocco and
Umar al-Saqqaf of Saudi Arabia.
An Arab spokesman discouraged
speculation that they asked to see
Nixon, to discuss oil shipments to the
United States.
"They want only to take up the
U.S. involvement in the war," the
spokesman said.
Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger was reported to have said
Monday night at a White House dinner
that "we have no intention of sending
troops to the Middle East, but if the
Russians send troops it will be a
different matter."
Israeli Thrusts
Meanwhile, the Cairo command
reported two Israeli thrusts yesterday
at the Suez Canal. Tel Aviv said an
Israeli task force penetrated Egyptian
territory on the west bank of the canal
and was making commando-style
strikes less than 100 miles from the
Egyptian capital.
President Anwar Sadat of Egypt
warned that he might unleash a missile
war against Israeli cities.
Tanks continued to slug it out in
major battles in Syria, and the Syrian

command said the fighting continued
into the night.
The Israeli command had no
immediate comment on the reported
battles.
'Desperate Attempt'
Seven Israeli tanks made a
"desperate attempt" to cross to the
west bank of the canal in the area of
Great Bitter Lake, about 75 miles
from Cairo, the Cairo command said,
but three of the tanks were destroyed
and the others fled.
The command said Egyptian air
power turned the tide in the Israeli
assault on the beachhead.
The planes "strafed enemy
positions, forcing the enemy to
withdraw, leaving his tanks behind on
fire," the Cairo command said.
Aerial encounters over the
battleground resulted in the shooting
down of 11 Israeli planes and two
Egyptian planes, the Cairo
communique claimed.
Israel Striking
Israel claimed its task force on the
west bank of the canal was striking at
Egyptian antiaircraft missile batteries
and artillery. No point along the canal
is more than 100 miles from the
Egyptian capital.
In another development, Melvin R.
Laird, Nixon's domestic adviser, was
reported to have told a group of
newsmen at a breakfast that "the
actions of the Soviet Union have been
disruptive, as far as the opportunities
to achieve a cease-fire and an
immediate settlement," are concerned.
He said the Sixth Fleet was being
reinforced and that the Soviet Union
has already taken a similar step with
its ships in the Mediterranean.
