OSLO, Norway (AP) — Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger and Le Due Tho of North Vietnam were
awarded the 1973 Nobel Peace Prize yesterday for
fashioning the cease-fire which officially ended the
Vietnam war.
Mrs. Aase Lionaes, chairwoman of the Nobel
committee, announced the award would be shared equally
by the architects of the truce, who conducted 42 months
of onand-off, tough negotiations in Paris before reaching
agreement in January.
In a brief statement, Mrs. Lionaes said the prize
winners "had acted in accord with Alfred Nobel's
idea... that conflicts should be solved through
negotiations and not by war."
Kissinger, 50, and Tho, 62, a member of the North
Vietnamese Politburo and the first ranking member of a
Communist government to win the prize, will each receive
255,000 Swedish crowns, or about $60,000. the Nobel
medal and the peace prize diploma.
Winners Notified
The presentations will be made in a formal ceremony
at the University of Oslo Dec. 10. Mrs. Lionaes said she
hoped both winners would attend. She said both had been
notified immediately before the public announcement at
the Nobel Institute.
Kissinger was attending a White House meeting on the
Middle East when he received the word. He was beaming
as he left to drive to the State Department, saying, "I'm
very pleased." No comment was available from Tho.
President Nixon said, "By jointly citing Dr. Kissinger
and Le Due Tho, the Nobel Committee has also given
deserved recognition to the art of negotiation," which
Nixon said "will be more essential than ever as we seek to
build and maintain a structure of peace in the world."
Pauling Comments
Chemistry Prof. Linus Pauling, holder of two Nobel
prizes including the 1962 Peace Prize, believes the Nobel
Committee's choice of U.S. Secretary of State Henry

Kissinger and North Vietnam's Le Due Tho to receive the
1973 Nobel Prize for Peace was "justified."
"It seems to me the war between the U.S. and North
Vietnam was the cause of so much human suffering that
ending it was imperative. Though this was not one of the
reasons for awarding the Peace Prize set down in Nobel's
will 78 years ago, conditions change and so do the
reasons."
Nobel stipulated the Peace Prize should be given for (1)
the best work for fraternity among nations, (2) for the
reduction or abolition of standing armies, or (3) for
initiating or holding peace congresses, Pauling said.
"Working out a peace between nations is a step toward
international fraternity, of course," he added.
Kissinger, who was Nixon's chief national security
adviser when he negotiated the cease-fire, is the 16th
American to win the peace prize. Tho is the first Asian to
be so honored.
Kissinger and Tho earned their prize the hard way — in
hundreds of hours of tense and exhausting secret talks
that often looked virtually hopeless.
Secret Meetings
Their meetings began in 1969, in such secrecy that
Kissinger sometimes traveled to them by subway to avoid
attracting the attention of newsmen.
When they ended in a blaze of news and television
coverage in January , they were still nominally secret. But
Kissinger and Tho found themselves followed wherever
they went in Paris by scores of newsmen and
photographers.
Details of how Kissinger and Tho arrived at their
break-through after dozens of months of bargaining are
likely to remain secret for years.
Kissinger has said Tho made the crucial concession at
an Oct. 8, 1972 meeting, when he finally agreed to
separate military and political issues. Tho has remained
silent about the bargaining.
