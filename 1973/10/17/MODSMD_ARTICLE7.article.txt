# Beware Of Proposition One
## Tax Initiative Aids Wealthy 
### 
James Lobsenz

On November 6th Californians
will go to the polls to pass
judgement on Proposition One,
the Tax and Expenditure
Limitation Initiative.
If approved the initiative will
become a part of the State
Constitution.
Basically, the proposition
provides for a plan of tax
reduction, which, on the surface,
appears to ease the financial
burdens of all.
First, it is proposed that all
state spending be geared to the
total personal income of all state
citizens, and that state spending
be reduced by 0.1 percent each
year. At present California state
expenditures equal about 8.3
percent of the estimated total
personal income of California.
The initiative would reduce
expenditures gradually until they
reach an amount equal to 7
percent of total personal income
in 1987, at which time the
Legislature would be permitted to
halt further spending reductions
by a two-thirds vote of both
houses.
The expenditures reduction
would be accompanied by an
annual decrease of 7.5 percent of
every taxpayer's state income tax.
It is further proposed that all single
persons with less than $4,000
income and all married couples
with less than $8,000 be
exempted from paying any state
income tax. Some special taxes on
capital gains and depletion
allowances would also be
eliminated.
Proponents of the proposition
point proudly to the eased tax
burden on low income persons
and families, but fail to mention
that a single person earning
$4,000 pays at the very most only
$15 of state taxes a year, and that
a married couple earning $8,000
pays a maximum of $14.
In fact, the average California
family of four earning $13,000,
under the terms of the proposed
initiative, would save only $12.60.
Thus the savings for the
overwhelming majority of
Californians would be minimal, to
say the least.
Those that would really profit
would be the rich, for they would
be greatly benefited by reductions
in personal income taxes.
With tax revenues decreasing,
the pinch would be felt first in
state funded social services. While
the initiative's authors maintain
that such a cutback in state social
services would not be necessary,
they base their claim on two false
assumptions.
First, they foresee on annual
inflation rate of 3 percent per
year, where the actual figure is
much closer to 5 percent. And
second, an overly optimistic
growth rate of 8 percent is
assumed, instead of a more
realistic 6 percent.
Legislative analyst A. Alan Post
estimates the combined effect of
these two errors would be to
produce a situation where
California would fall $620 million
short of the revenue needed to
maintain the state social service
programs presently in existence.
This deficit would grow,
according to Post, to $1.37 billion
in three years.
Should the initiative become
law, a repeal or retraction of it
would be an extremely difficult
measure to accomplish, for if
approved at the polls, the
proposition becomes a part of the
state constitution. The only way
it could be scrapped then would
be with the aid of another
statewide initiative ballot.
While the bill does provide that
an "emergency situation" can be
declared which would allow for
tax increases, such an emergency
can only be declared by the
Governor. A unanimous
legislature would be powerless to
grant relief to California citizens
should one stubborn Governor
oppose them.
While the initiative proposes to
gear state expenditures to the
total personal income of the state,

it says little as to how a figure for
total personal income is to be
arrived at. This task is simply
handed over to a body to be
called, logically enough, the
Economics Estimates
Commission, to be composed of
three persons: a legislative
appointee, a governor appointee,
and the state controller. Thus
only one member of the troika
will be an elected official.
The Commission is directed to
produce its total personal income
estimate by April Ist of each
fiscal year despite the fact that
complete figures on personal
incomes are not available until
mid-July. In the interim the state
of California is to resort to a
guessing game called
"Extrapolation Taxation."
Should the Commission's
estimate prove incorrect, none in
the entire state of California
would be empowered to correct
it, (not even the Governor!). A
mistake by the Commission could
cost California up to 0.5 billion
dollars.
Proposition One could justly
be called a legislator's nightmare.
There are probably more things
wrong with it than there are
cavities in the group that didn't
brush with Crest.
Apparently the initiative's
authors were aware themselves of
the measure's slipshod and faulty
construction, for they took the
precaution of adding to it a rather
unique form of a "saving clause,"
which provides that in the event
that one portion of the bill is held
unconstitutional in the courts, the
rest of the measure shall remain
law.
Perhaps the most devilish
feature of the proposition is its
built in gradualism. By eroding
the state expenditure level at the
creepingly slow rate of 0.1
percent per year the state is
allowed to slip into financial
chaos almost imperceptibly.
Should the proposition pass, it

might well draw a favorable
response from the public during
the first few years of its existence.
A shower of praise could be
expected to fall upon the
initiative's chief flag bearer,
Governor Reagan.
But when the more
"extraneous" state programs had
all been trimmed down to their
bare essentials or shelved entirely,
then the crunch would really
begin to be felt.
But by then of course, the
initiative's most prominent
proponent might be far away,
sheltered from the financial
storms of California by the secure
protection afforded him by a
Pennsylvania Avenue address.
