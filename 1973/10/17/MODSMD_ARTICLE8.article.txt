# Ruling Class Freedom
## Racist Sanction Continues 
### 
Jacques Depelchin

In reporting on the election of
F.E. Terman to the Presidency of
the Society of the Sigma Xi
[Daily, Oct. 11] one is told that
Dr. F.E. Terman is the son of
"famed psychologist Lewis M.
Terman of Stanford, whose studies
of gifted children are still being
carried on long after his death."
The description ought to have
read "ignominously famous
psychologist" for Lewis M.
Terman did more than simply
study gifted children, he was also
one of the most rabbidly stubborn
theoritician-supporter of IQ tests.
Purportly meant to measure
intelligence, these tests were used
then, and have been used since to
propagate a nazi-type ideology
proclaiming the superiority of
whites over Indians, Mexicans and
Blacks.
In his book — The
Measurement of Intelligence; An
explanation of and a Complete
Guide for the Use of the Stanford
Revision and Extension of the
Binet-Simon Intelligence Scale —
L.M. Terman commented on the
low IQ scored by two boys from a
Portuguese family:
"Their dullness seems to be
racial, or at least inherent in
the family stocks from
which they come. The fact
that one meets this type
with such extraordinary
frequency among Indians,
Mexicans, and negroes
suggests quite forcibly that
the whole question of racial
differences in mental traits
will have to be taken anew
and by experimental
methods. The writer
predicts that when this is
done there will be
discovered enormously
significant racial differences

in general intelligence,
differences which cannot be
wiped out by any scheme of
mental culture." (pp. 91-92)
The purpose of this note is not
to indict F.E. Terman for the
racist views of his father, but
rather point out the historical role
that Stanford University has
played by providing "famed"
psychologists, engineers and
others with a prestigious forum
for expounding their racist
theories.
It had been assumed that the
horrors of nazi-Germany had dealt
an irreparable blow to
pseudo-scientific racism, but the
publicity, the financial and
academic support given to such
neo-nazi characters as Shockley,
Jensen, Herrnstein and Eysenck
proved the contrary. It is not pure
coincidence that Terman taught at
Stanford and that "famed"
Nobel-prize winner Shockley is
allowed to use this institution as
his basis of operations. Not only
does Shockley share L.M.
Terman's racism, but he also uses
L.M. Terman's work to argue his
case for sterilizing dark skin
people.
It is more important, however,
to bear in mind that Stanford
University is not an institution
where all ideas are allowed to
flourish. Financed by the
wealthiest members of the ruling
class of the U.S., it is meant to
serve their interests and no one
else's. Trustees Hewlett, Packard
and Company are not interested
in wiping out racism or furthering
the interests of the working class.
If they were, they would have
kicked out Shockley and not the
students who disrupted his class
last year. Instead, they have
allowed racism to be propagated
under the cloak of academic
freedom — i.e. freedom of the
ruling class.
In order to preserve their
interests, they will make such
accommodations as setting up
token black studies programs or
inviting black scholars to spend a
year on campus. Such, for
example, is the policy of the
curator and co-curator of the
African Collection at the Hoover
Institution. In order to conceal
their overt and covert racism — as
exemplified in their most
infamous racist tract White
Settlers in Tropical Africa — L.
Gann and P. Duignan persuaded
the Institution that naming black
scholars as National Fellows
would give them a better image
than the one they deserve.
Interestingly, the ruling
class-owned media always chooses
to refer to these blatant racists as
i "famed" psychologists, "famed"
[ Nobel-prize winner, "famed"
1 professors. That is not surprising.

To the classes and races against
whom they are working they are
infamous. All progressive forces
must unite in order to put an end
to their slanders against workers
and peoples of color.

the whole question of racial
differences in mental traits
will have to be taken anew
and by experimental
methods. The writer
predicts that when this is
done there will be

significant racial differences

in general intelligence,
differences which cannot be
wiped out by any scheme of

The purpose of this note is not
to indict F.E. Terman for the
racist views of his father, but
rather point out the historical role
that Stanford University has
played by providing "famed"
psychologists, engineers and
others with a prestigious forum
for expounding their racist
theories.
It had been assumed that the
horrors of nazi-Germany had dealt
an irreparable blow to
pseudo-scientific racism, but the
publicity, the financial and
academic support given to such
neo-nazi characters as Shockley,
Jensen, Herrnstein and Eysenck
proved the contrary. It is not pure
coincidence that Terman taught at
Stanford and that "famed"
Nobel-prize winner Shockley is
allowed to use this institution as
his basis of operations. Not only
does Shockley share L.M.
Terman's racism, but he also uses
L.M. Terman's work to argue his
case for sterilizing dark skin
people.
It is more important, however,
to bear in mind that Stanford
University is not an institution
where all ideas are allowed to
flourish. Financed by the
wealthiest members of the ruling
class of the U.S., it is meant to
serve their interests and no one
else's. Trustees Hewlett, Packard
and Company are not interested
in wiping out racism or furthering
the interests of the working class.
If they were, they would have
kicked out Shockley and not the
students who disrupted his class
last year. Instead, they have
allowed racism to be propagated
under the cloak of academic
freedom — i.e. freedom of the
ruling class.
In order to preserve their
interests, they will make such
accommodations as setting up
token black studies programs or
inviting black scholars to spend a
year on campus. Such, for
example, is the policy of the
curator and co-curator of the
African Collection at the Hoover
Institution. In order to conceal
their overt and covert racism — as
exemplified in their most
infamous racist tract White
Settlers in Tropical Africa — L.
Gann and P. Duignan persuaded
the Institution that naming black
scholars as National Fellows
would give them a better image
than the one they deserve.
Interestingly, the ruling
class-owned media always chooses
to refer to these blatant racists as
i "famed" psychologists, "famed"
[ Nobel-prize winner, "famed"
1 professors. That is not surprising.

To the classes and races against
whom they are working they are
infamous. All progressive forces
must unite in order to put an end
to their slanders against workers
and peoples of color.

study gifted children, he was also

the family stocks from

that one meets this type
