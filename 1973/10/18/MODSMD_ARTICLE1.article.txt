# Gynecology Care Limited As Cowell Staffer Quits
## 
### CLAIRE SPIEGEL 
Stanford women making
appointments with the Cowell Health
Center gynecologist are in for a long
wait and a discouraging surprise. The
popular Dr. Sue Ellen Massey left her
post as part-time gynecologist
Monday, and the health services
director, Dr. James McClenahan, has
not found a replacement.
"This was unanticipated and is
being worked on," McClenahan said.
Although he acknowledges the need
for a gynecologist, he has turned down
suggestions that a full-time doctor be
hired, and asserts that part-time
consultation will be sufficient.
On the other hand, patients,
receptionists and even Massey say

full-time help is needed. Massey said
on her last day of work, "A full-time
gynecologist could be utilized to a
great extent in both routine
contraceptive care and more medically
problematic cases."
Head receptionist Esther Lang
agrees. "There is a need for a more
than part-time gynecologist. If there
were a full-time doctor, her schedule
could be filled."
As one frustrated patient put it,
"You can't see a gynecologist just
because you'd feel more comfortable.
And when you do finally see her, you
feel guilty for taking up her time."
There is a problem of perspective,
according to McClenahan. A woman
says she specifically wants to see the

gynecologist and claims her problem is
pressing. "There's a different between
what the physician and the student
think is urgent."
Example
He cited a typical example. A
woman wants an I.U.D. inserted and
complains that three weeks is too long
to wait. "Medically, that's not too
long, although it fiiay be more urgent
from the social point of view," he said.
In such cases and other
complications which require the
gynecologist's advice — though not
immediately — there is presently a
backlog, which is attributed to the fall
"rush." According to McClenahan,
"The question is, how unreasonable is
this? Do we hire an extra doctor just
to cut the waiting time from three
weeks to one?"
Women with medical emergencies
have no wait, he emphasized. They are
given immediate care and top priority.
Furthermore, he estimated 80 to 90
percent of the gynecological problems
can be handled promptly by Cowell's
staff doctors. Massey estimated a more
conservative 50 percent.
Staff Qualified
"Many girls don't understand that
any staff doctor is qualified to deal
with routine contraceptive care and
common infections," receptionist
Lang said.
Internist Dr. David Torin explained,
"Routine care is not any more
complicated than treating T.B. or
diabetes. It's relatively routine. The
facts are clear-cut, and the literature is
available."
'Screening Process'
Receptionists initially route
patients through staff doctors, who
then refer complicated cases to the
gynecologist. In theory, it's an
expedient "screening process," Lang
said, which keeps the gynecologist
available <to women who need her
most. In practice, however, some
patients claim the screen is too fine.
"I've become fussy about whom I
see," one graduate student confided,
and recited a pack of horror stories
about women who weren't as choosy.
One senior described a disagreeable
experience she had. A general
practitioner (who has since left the
health center) diagnosed her cancerous
tumors of the ovary as gonorrhea. She
was treated with penicillun when she
should have been scheduled for
surgery. After one long painful month,
she consulted, on her own initiative, a
gynecologist at the Palo Alto Clinic.
Although she is now sterile, she
doesn't blame it on Cowell, because
her condition was probably beyond
medical control. However, she does
criticize their alleged insensitivity and
the callous treatment receptionists
gave her.
Another complaint comes from a
co-ed who had been referred to Massey
by a general practitioner, who told her
she had an enlarged ovary but that her
case was not urgent.
Schedule Book
"She told me not to be concerned,
but I was, and I wanted to see Dr.
Massey right away, not four weeks
from then. At Cowell their schedule
book comes first, and our mental state
doesn't make much difference to
them."
She charged the Health Center was
reluctant to refer patients to free
clinics and to the Palo Alto Clinic. "I
had to know about the referral service
before I could find out about it from
them," she said.
McClenahan emphasized that the
health service prefers to take care of
their own problems, and only refers
cases which can't wait or ones the staff
can't cope with.
Now that Massey has left,
complicated gynecological cases will
be referred to the Palo Alto Clinic,
where one gynecologist is already
booked up through December.
Trained
In the meantime, Dr. Serita
Johnson, a general practitioner, has
been trained to take over part of
Massey's practice, and a nurse will
soon take on gynecological care
full-time.

from the social point of view," he said.
In such cases and other
complications which require the
gynecologist's advice — though not
immediately — there is presently a
backlog, which is attributed to the fall
"rush." According to McClenahan,
"The question is, how unreasonable is
this? Do we hire an extra doctor just
to cut the waiting time from three
weeks to one?"
Women with medical emergencies
have no wait, he emphasized. They are
given immediate care and top priority.
Furthermore, he estimated 80 to 90
percent of the gynecological problems
can be handled promptly by Cowell's
staff doctors. Massey estimated a more
conservative 50 percent.
Staff Qualified
"Many girls don't understand that
any staff doctor is qualified to deal
with routine contraceptive care and
common infections," receptionist
Lang said.
Internist Dr. David Torin explained,
"Routine care is not any more
complicated than treating T.B. or
diabetes. It's relatively routine. The
facts are clear-cut, and the literature is
available."
'Screening Process'
Receptionists initially route
patients through staff doctors, who
then refer complicated cases to the
gynecologist. In theory, it's an
expedient "screening process," Lang
said, which keeps the gynecologist
available <to women who need her
most. In practice, however, some
patients claim the screen is too fine.
"I've become fussy about whom I
see," one graduate student confided,
and recited a pack of horror stories
about women who weren't as choosy.
One senior described a disagreeable
experience she had. A general
practitioner (who has since left the
health center) diagnosed her cancerous
tumors of the ovary as gonorrhea. She
was treated with penicillun when she
should have been scheduled for
surgery. After one long painful month,
she consulted, on her own initiative, a
gynecologist at the Palo Alto Clinic.
Although she is now sterile, she
doesn't blame it on Cowell, because
her condition was probably beyond
medical control. However, she does
criticize their alleged insensitivity and
the callous treatment receptionists
gave her.
Another complaint comes from a
co-ed who had been referred to Massey
by a general practitioner, who told her
she had an enlarged ovary but that her
case was not urgent.
Schedule Book
"She told me not to be concerned,
but I was, and I wanted to see Dr.
Massey right away, not four weeks
from then. At Cowell their schedule
book comes first, and our mental state
doesn't make much difference to
them."
She charged the Health Center was
reluctant to refer patients to free
clinics and to the Palo Alto Clinic. "I
had to know about the referral service
before I could find out about it from
them," she said.
McClenahan emphasized that the
health service prefers to take care of
their own problems, and only refers
cases which can't wait or ones the staff
can't cope with.
Now that Massey has left,
complicated gynecological cases will
be referred to the Palo Alto Clinic,
where one gynecologist is already
booked up through December.
Trained
In the meantime, Dr. Serita
Johnson, a general practitioner, has
been trained to take over part of
Massey's practice, and a nurse will
soon take on gynecological care
full-time.
Stanford women making
appointments with the Cowell Health
Center gynecologist are in for a long
wait and a discouraging surprise. The
popular Dr. Sue Ellen Massey left her
post as part-time gynecologist
Monday, and the health services
director, Dr. James McClenahan, has
not found a replacement.
"This was unanticipated and is
being worked on," McClenahan said.
Although he acknowledges the need
for a gynecologist, he has turned down
suggestions that a full-time doctor be
hired, and asserts that part-time
consultation will be sufficient.
On the other hand, patients,
receptionists and even Massey say

full-time help is needed. Massey said
on her last day of work, "A full-time
gynecologist could be utilized to a
great extent in both routine
contraceptive care and more medically
problematic cases."
Head receptionist Esther Lang
agrees. "There is a need for a more
than part-time gynecologist. If there
were a full-time doctor, her schedule
could be filled."
As one frustrated patient put it,
"You can't see a gynecologist just
because you'd feel more comfortable.
And when you do finally see her, you
feel guilty for taking up her time."
There is a problem of perspective,
according to McClenahan. A woman
says she specifically wants to see the

gynecologist and claims her problem is
pressing. "There's a different between
what the physician and the student
think is urgent."
Example
He cited a typical example. A
woman wants an I.U.D. inserted and
complains that three weeks is too long
to wait. "Medically, that's not too
long, although it fiiay be more urgent
from the social point of view," he said.

tumors of the ovary as gonorrhea. She
was treated with penicillun when she
should have been scheduled for
surgery. After one long painful month,
she consulted, on her own initiative, a
gynecologist at the Palo Alto Clinic.
Although she is now sterile, she
doesn't blame it on Cowell, because
her condition was probably beyond
medical control. However, she does
criticize their alleged insensitivity and
the callous treatment receptionists
gave her.
Another complaint comes from a
co-ed who had been referred to Massey
by a general practitioner, who told her
she had an enlarged ovary but that her
case was not urgent.
Schedule Book
"She told me not to be concerned,
but I was, and I wanted to see Dr.
Massey right away, not four weeks
from then. At Cowell their schedule
book comes first, and our mental state
doesn't make much difference to
them."
She charged the Health Center was
reluctant to refer patients to free
clinics and to the Palo Alto Clinic. "I
had to know about the referral service
before I could find out about it from
them," she said.
McClenahan emphasized that the
health service prefers to take care of
their own problems, and only refers
cases which can't wait or ones the staff
can't cope with.
Now that Massey has left,
complicated gynecological cases will
be referred to the Palo Alto Clinic,
where one gynecologist is already
booked up through December.
Trained
In the meantime, Dr. Serita
Johnson, a general practitioner, has
been trained to take over part of
Massey's practice, and a nurse will
soon take on gynecological care
full-time.
Stanford women making
appointments with the Cowell Health
Center gynecologist are in for a long
wait and a discouraging surprise. The
popular Dr. Sue Ellen Massey left her
post as part-time gynecologist
Monday, and the health services
director, Dr. James McClenahan, has
not found a replacement.
"This was unanticipated and is
being worked on," McClenahan said.
Although he acknowledges the need
for a gynecologist, he has turned down
suggestions that a full-time doctor be
hired, and asserts that part-time
consultation will be sufficient.
On the other hand, patients,
receptionists and even Massey say

full-time help is needed. Massey said
on her last day of work, "A full-time
gynecologist could be utilized to a
great extent in both routine
contraceptive care and more medically
problematic cases."
Head receptionist Esther Lang
agrees. "There is a need for a more
than part-time gynecologist. If there
were a full-time doctor, her schedule
could be filled."
As one frustrated patient put it,
"You can't see a gynecologist just
because you'd feel more comfortable.
And when you do finally see her, you
feel guilty for taking up her time."
There is a problem of perspective,
according to McClenahan. A woman
says she specifically wants to see the

gynecologist and claims her problem is
pressing. "There's a different between
what the physician and the student
think is urgent."
Example
He cited a typical example. A
woman wants an I.U.D. inserted and
complains that three weeks is too long
to wait. "Medically, that's not too
long, although it fiiay be more urgent
from the social point of view," he said.
In such cases and other
complications which require the
gynecologist's advice — though not
immediately — there is presently a
backlog, which is attributed to the fall
"rush." According to McClenahan,
"The question is, how unreasonable is
this? Do we hire an extra doctor just
to cut the waiting time from three
weeks to one?"
Women with medical emergencies
have no wait, he emphasized. They are
given immediate care and top priority.
Furthermore, he estimated 80 to 90
percent of the gynecological problems
can be handled promptly by Cowell's
staff doctors. Massey estimated a more
conservative 50 percent.
Staff Qualified
"Many girls don't understand that
any staff doctor is qualified to deal
with routine contraceptive care and
common infections," receptionist
Lang said.
Internist Dr. David Torin explained,
"Routine care is not any more
complicated than treating T.B. or
diabetes. It's relatively routine. The
facts are clear-cut, and the literature is
available."
'Screening Process'
Receptionists initially route
patients through staff doctors, who
then refer complicated cases to the
gynecologist. In theory, it's an
expedient "screening process," Lang
said, which keeps the gynecologist
available <to women who need her
most. In practice, however, some
patients claim the screen is too fine.
"I've become fussy about whom I
see," one graduate student confided,
and recited a pack of horror stories
about women who weren't as choosy.
One senior described a disagreeable
experience she had. A general
practitioner (who has since left the
health center) diagnosed her cancerous
tumors of the ovary as gonorrhea. She
was treated with penicillun when she
should have been scheduled for
surgery. After one long painful month,
she consulted, on her own initiative, a
gynecologist at the Palo Alto Clinic.

doesn't blame it on Cowell, because
