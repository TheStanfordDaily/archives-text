# Lyman Leaves Many Gaps
## Campus Concerns Need Clarification 
### 
Stan Baker

In a series of statements on
student interests, university
President Richard Lyman recently
discussed such urgent and wide
ranging issues as student financial
aid, faculty evaluation polls,
promotion and tenure policies,
and the black student interest at
Stanford. These developments,
although at first appearing to give
a clearer focus of his position on
certain issues have instead
muddied the water in certain
areas, but do serve as a signpost of
future administrative directions.
In a follow-up to the released
statement of the Committee for
Economic Development, Lyman
called for the increase of
governmental support to students
via grants and loans.
Financial aid has been a double
edged sword for both
governmental agencies and school

officials, as students have been
left high and dry in assuming a
greater portion of the burden of
educational costs at a greater cost
to them in light of skyrocketing
interest rates.
Chaotic Effect
The Nixon administration has
had a remarkable effect in
deterring the productivity of the
academic community via its
topsyturvy economic and political
priorities, but the university
system must not throw up its
hands at a time when student
enrollment cutbacks accompany
an ever increasing need for
scholarly progress and technical
competency.
What is needed is for the
universities, and Stanford in
particular, to help absorb the
"crunch" with serious
economizing at faculty and

administrative levpl*
Lyman's insight on the
problem of the growing gap in
tuition charges between state and
private institutions is well taken.
The narrowing of that gap cannot
and should not be accomplished
by emergency and rather
simplistic measures aimed at
penalizing the students; rather a
sharing of the added burdens
seems wiser, while a long term
look at the role governmental and
university support will have in the
future is analyzed.
On the other side of the
university budgetary cutback
problem lies the brilliant but
hapless young educator, who as a
member of the limited-contract
group of faculty, finds his
position increasingly marginal.
Stanford has traditionally had a
liberal tenure and promotion
policy, but faced with a growing
percentage of tenured faculty and
an accompanying inflexibility, the
university has tightened up on its
promotions.
This policy is unfortunately
making itself felt most obviously
at the junior faculty level where
the benefits of the incubation
process that a generous umbrella
of protection provides are most
needed.
Of course the tradition of
tenure is one of academia's most
sacred cows, but a more equitable
solution might lie in thoroughly
reviewing the progress of senior
faculty as well as that of their
junior colleagues and in dispensing
with the automatic hatcheting of
"good but young" faculty.
As a method to achieving this
end the student evaluation of
both junior and senior faculty
seems a valuable part, either in its
present or a revised form. Here,
Lyman scores well in generally
supporting evaluation of the
faculty by the students, but
especially critical will be his
strong stand in the future for
review of senior faculty.
The departure of James
Simmons as assistant to the
president for black affairs drew
fire from the Black Students
Union as an indication of
administrative unconcern towards
black problems on campus, but
here president Lyman took a
rather "Reagan-like" posture on
the problem, commenting that the
move "doesn't imply a diminished
concern by the administration,"
but is instead a reflection of the
change in the black scene at
Stanford which accompanies
administrative restructuring, to
avoid obsolescence and overlap of
functions ... blah, blah.
The indications that the black
and other minority groups have
achieved a "positive self image,"
have achieved acceptable
enrollment levels, or have
accomplished the solidarity that
outstrips the need for effective
liaison and coordination seem

either totally unjustified or
unexplained. The politics behind
the decision not to rehire
someone for this position would
be interesting to discover. There is
a definite need for more
explanation here.
In all fairness to President
Lyman and the administration, it
is impossible to speak definitively
on issues where all the facts are
not yet known, and this
encompasses a great many
problems discussed here and
elsewhere. But for the benefit of
every one concerned, the
administration has a responsibility
to maintain an open forum to all
issues, and to help clarify the facts
so intelligent solutions can be
found.
