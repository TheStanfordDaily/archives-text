Crucial Decisions
Editor:
While protesting the "secrecy
of the newly formed Palo
Alto-Stanford Liaison Committee,
the Stanford Daily has failed to
report on, perhaps even cover,
two recent public meetings of the
Palo Alto Planning Commission
which could have a far greater
impact upon , the future of
Stanford University as an
independent, self-determining
academic institution. Last
Thursday this Planning
Commission recommended
county legislation whose effect
would be to give Palo Alto
ultimate control over the design
and construction of future
teaching, research, student and
faculty housing facilities.
In other words, if the
governing bodies of Palo Alto
decide in their greater wisdom
that Stanford University should
not build a new law complex or
library addition, they could deny
it. Such decisions would, in effect,
determine the academic direction
of Stanford. More importantly,
they would be made by officials
who have no political
responsibility to Stanford
students, faculty and trustees,
subverting the University's
governance processes.
Personally I accept the Daily's
criticisms carried in last Friday's
editorial. While the editorial tends
to confuse the administrative
process with the governance
process, it does call for
improvements which deserve
consideration and response.
In the meantime, if the Daily is
to serve the Stanford community
responsibly, it should give more
attention to what's going on at
city hall and the county seat. As
John Adams asked in the musical,
"1776," "Is anybody there? Does
anybody care?"
