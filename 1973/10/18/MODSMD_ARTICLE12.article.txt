# Concerned, Community?
## Many Desire Help 
### 
Don Tollefson

No one in the Stanford
community is devoid of personal
problems. We all face difficulties
of widely varying degrees
involving jobs, family life,
personal relationships, finances,
future plans.. .. But somehow
these problems seem miniscule
when compared to those of
countless other people.
In an affluent community such
as ours, it is terribly easy to forget
about those less fortunate than
ourselves. Mentally retarded
children, teenagers strung out on
hard drugs, and adults who have
been crippled since birth all seem
remote to many people in this
community. Yet despite their
busy schedules and heavy
commitments, most people here
are sincerely concerned about
these people.
But as with so many concerns,
it is often hard to determine what
one individual can do. For years,
many people at Stanford were
concerned about stopping a war
they didn't believe in, but they
were frustrated as to how to do
that. Finding ways to help others
less fortunate than ourselves can
also be a frustrating experience,
especially for people with limited
time.
Right now, there is a way that
all members of this community
can concretely and immediately
aid thousands of people in Palo
Alto and throughout the Bay
Area. The Santa Clara County
United Fund, which supports 113
agencies aiding over 250,000
people, is currently in the final
days of its Stanford drive and
needs the help of all concerned
members of the community.

Rarely does a day pass on this
campus when someone doesn't
solicit funds for a cause in which
they deeply believe. Many of
these causes are legitimate and
worthwhile, but it is sometimes
very difficult to weigh the relative
merits of each program. We feel
that because the United Fund
supports so many diverse
programs, it is especially worthy
of support.
United Fund supported
programs range from the Family
Law Center to the United
Cerebral Palsy Association; from
the Pathway Drug Abuse Council
to Mexican-American Community
Services; from the National Urban
League to the Home for Retarded
Adults and Children.
Here at Stanford, the Santa
Clara County United Fund
supports four extremely
worthwhile programs: the
Children's Center of the Stanford
Community, the Stanford Medical
Center's outpatient program for
indigent patients, the YWCA, and
the Youth Opportunities Program,
which provides work experience
for disadvantaged high school
youths. During the last year, these
four programs received a total of
nearly $30,000 from the United
Fund.
Growing Needs
Last year, 1981 Stanford
employees contributed $57,883
to the United Fund. This was a
laudatory effort, but this year the
needs of disadvantaged people are
even greater. Cutbacks in federal
programs have been only one
cause of a worsening situation for
many disadvantaged people in this
county and throughout the
nation. These people need help
and now is your chance to give
them that help.
This year, the Stanford United
Fund drive hopes to raise $70,000
as part of a countywide goal of
$4,466,679. Thousands of
volunteers are working long,
selfless hours towards the
achievement of these goals, but
theirs is not an easy task. Their
efforts will go for naught unless
there is widespread,
compassionate cooperation from
people in this community and
throughout the county.
Stop for a moment and
consider how fortunate you are.
Few, if any, of you need to worry
about a roof over your head, or
food on your table or health care.
There are many people in this
county who aren't so lucky. The
United Fund is working hard to
provide help for those people, but
we need your help. Please give
your fair share to this year's
United Fund.

IOO YEARS."
Don Tollefson

No one in the Stanford
community is devoid of personal
problems. We all face difficulties
of widely varying degrees
involving jobs, family life,
personal relationships, finances,
future plans.. .. But somehow
these problems seem miniscule
when compared to those of
countless other people.
In an affluent community such
as ours, it is terribly easy to forget
about those less fortunate than
ourselves. Mentally retarded
children, teenagers strung out on
hard drugs, and adults who have
been crippled since birth all seem
remote to many people in this
community. Yet despite their
busy schedules and heavy
commitments, most people here
are sincerely concerned about
these people.
But as with so many concerns,
it is often hard to determine what
one individual can do. For years,
many people at Stanford were
concerned about stopping a war
they didn't believe in, but they
were frustrated as to how to do
that. Finding ways to help others
less fortunate than ourselves can
also be a frustrating experience,
especially for people with limited
time.
Right now, there is a way that
all members of this community
can concretely and immediately
aid thousands of people in Palo
Alto and throughout the Bay
Area. The Santa Clara County
United Fund, which supports 113
agencies aiding over 250,000
people, is currently in the final
days of its Stanford drive and
needs the help of all concerned
members of the community.

Rarely does a day pass on this
campus when someone doesn't
solicit funds for a cause in which
they deeply believe. Many of
these causes are legitimate and
worthwhile, but it is sometimes
very difficult to weigh the relative
merits of each program. We feel
that because the United Fund
supports so many diverse
programs, it is especially worthy
of support.
United Fund supported
programs range from the Family
Law Center to the United
Cerebral Palsy Association; from
the Pathway Drug Abuse Council
to Mexican-American Community
Services; from the National Urban
League to the Home for Retarded
Adults and Children.
Here at Stanford, the Santa
Clara County United Fund
supports four extremely
worthwhile programs: the
Children's Center of the Stanford
Community, the Stanford Medical
Center's outpatient program for
indigent patients, the YWCA, and
the Youth Opportunities Program,
which provides work experience
for disadvantaged high school
youths. During the last year, these
four programs received a total of
nearly $30,000 from the United
Fund.
Growing Needs
Last year, 1981 Stanford
employees contributed $57,883
to the United Fund. This was a
laudatory effort, but this year the
needs of disadvantaged people are
even greater. Cutbacks in federal
programs have been only one
cause of a worsening situation for
many disadvantaged people in this
county and throughout the
nation. These people need help
and now is your chance to give
them that help.
This year, the Stanford United
Fund drive hopes to raise $70,000
as part of a countywide goal of
$4,466,679. Thousands of
volunteers are working long,
selfless hours towards the
achievement of these goals, but
theirs is not an easy task. Their
efforts will go for naught unless
there is widespread,
compassionate cooperation from
people in this community and
throughout the county.
Stop for a moment and
consider how fortunate you are.
Few, if any, of you need to worry
about a roof over your head, or
food on your table or health care.
There are many people in this
county who aren't so lucky. The
United Fund is working hard to
provide help for those people, but
we need your help. Please give
your fair share to this year's
United Fund.
