# Waldie Questions Ford's 'Ideology'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - A
member of the House Judiciary
Committee which will hold
hearings on the nomination of the
Vice President-designate said
Tuesday that the"club attitude"
that brought a ground-swell of
congressional support for Gerald
Ford is quickly changing.
Rep. Jerome R. Waldie,
D—Calif., said he has received
assurances from House Speaker
Carl Albert, D—Okla., and
Majority Leader Thomas B.
O'Neill, D—Mass., that a hard look
will be taken at the qualifications
of President Nixon's choice for
vice president.
Personally, Waldie said, he
strongly opposes the Michigan
Republican "because Jerry Ford
flunks the ideological test."
"I have no questions about his
honesty," Waldie stated at a news
conference. "But I have a great
deal of questions about his
ideological capabilities." Waldie
gave three reasons for his
opposition:
—The AFL-CIO said in a report
to Waldie that Ford has a 94
percent anti-labor voting record.
Ford's attempts to impeach
Supreme Court Justice William O.
Douglas, he said, shows an
insensitivity toward civil rights
and the separation of powers in
government.
—Ford's civil rights record;
although he ultimately voted for
civil rights legislation, Waldie said,
"in the interim processes Ford
voted to gut the proposals."
"Jerry Ford does not deserve
to become vice president," said
Waldie, who is seeking the

Democratic nomination in the
California gubernatorial race.
Waldie said that he wants to
question Ford on where he stands
on such issues as the Watergate
tapes, the bugging of the offices
of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist,
the White House "plumbers," and
the Vietnam war.
The congressman also
reiterated his belief that Congress
should not act on the nomination
until the controversy over the
Watergate tapes has been resolved
in the courts.
Waldie said he is "personally
confident that as the country
becomes aware of Jerry Ford's
inadequacies" there will be a
movement to hold up the
nomination in Congress.
"The club attitude in Congress
is very strong," said Waldie.
"They say, 'gold oP Jerry — he's
part of the club." But Waldie said
he foresees a lessening of that
general belief very soon.

Carl Albert, D—Okla., and
Majority Leader Thomas B.
O'Neill, D—Mass., that a hard look
will be taken at the qualifications
of President Nixon's choice for
vice president.
Personally, Waldie said, he
strongly opposes the Michigan
Republican "because Jerry Ford
flunks the ideological test."
"I have no questions about his
honesty," Waldie stated at a news
conference. "But I have a great
deal of questions about his
ideological capabilities." Waldie
gave three reasons for his
opposition:
—The AFL-CIO said in a report
to Waldie that Ford has a 94
percent anti-labor voting record.
Ford's attempts to impeach
Supreme Court Justice William O.
Douglas, he said, shows an
insensitivity toward civil rights
and the separation of powers in
government.
—Ford's civil rights record;
although he ultimately voted for
civil rights legislation, Waldie said,
"in the interim processes Ford
voted to gut the proposals."
"Jerry Ford does not deserve
to become vice president," said
Waldie, who is seeking the

Democratic nomination in the
California gubernatorial race.
Waldie said that he wants to
question Ford on where he stands
on such issues as the Watergate
tapes, the bugging of the offices
of Daniel Ellsberg's psychiatrist,
the White House "plumbers," and
the Vietnam war.
The congressman also
reiterated his belief that Congress
should not act on the nomination
until the controversy over the
Watergate tapes has been resolved
in the courts.
Waldie said he is "personally
confident that as the country
becomes aware of Jerry Ford's
inadequacies" there will be a
movement to hold up the
nomination in Congress.
"The club attitude in Congress
is very strong," said Waldie.
"They say, 'gold oP Jerry — he's
part of the club." But Waldie said
he foresees a lessening of that
general belief very soon.

WASHINGTON (AP) - A
member of the House Judiciary
Committee which will hold
hearings on the nomination of the
Vice President-designate said
Tuesday that the"club attitude"
that brought a ground-swell of
congressional support for Gerald
Ford is quickly changing.
Rep. Jerome R. Waldie,
D—Calif., said he has received
assurances from House Speaker
Carl Albert, D—Okla., and
Majority Leader Thomas B.
O'Neill, D—Mass., that a hard look
will be taken at the qualifications
of President Nixon's choice for
vice president.
