# New History Courses Offer 'Strong' Background
## 
### BILL ROSS 
A sequence of history courses
started here this autumn attempts
to provide the general student
with a strong, coherent
background in western
civilization, according to Lewis
Spitz, professor of history.
"We are offering courses which
include mainline information and
basic sources regarding the
cultural monuments of western
man," Spitz said. "The history
department is giving general

students a chance to receive the
basic knowledge and depth of
understanding that should be
expected of an educated person."
Spitz explained that the return
of comprehensive courses in the
( history department is part of a
trend away from unstructured
i courses.
I In the late 19605, Stanford and
! many other universities abolished
i freshman history requirements,
' Spitz said. While the department
1 formerly had offered a series of

western civilization courses, these
were largely eliminated in favor of
more specialized courses, he said.
Strong Backgrounds
At the same time, the rising
academic credentials of Stanford
students caused many University
officials to believe that entering
students had strong backgrounds
in history and didn't need an
introductory series of courses,
according to Spitz.
"As a result, many freshmen
and sophomores took a series of
undirected courses with a strong
contemporary emphasis. When the
students reached the upper level
courses, many professors
discovered to their horror that
students lacked a fundamental
knowledge of history because of
the obvious deficiencies of
training provided by the
secondary schools," Spitz said.
"Many faculty members who
helped abolish the western
civilization courses have begun to
see the error of free floating
education arranged at the
discretion of inexperienced
students and encouraged by the
indifference of parochial and
views of some of the advisers."
Spitz added that the University
should encourage students to take
advantage of basic courses.
'Balanced Diet'
"Students should realize that
education is not a tray full of hors
d' oeuvres but rather a balanced
diet aimed at producing
intellectual stamina," Spitz said.
"This is the department's attempt
to move to a more structured
program. Experienced professors

are contributing their knowledge
to freshmen and sophomores
rather than have the vital first
courses taught by beginning
instructors."
Although he emphasized that
history is a necessary subject for
all students, Spitz said he is
satisfied that the new history
series need not be required.
"There is no reason to impose
this sequence of courses on
everyone, especially if a student
wants to take a more advanced
class," he said.
Renaissance To Enlightenment
The course sequence includes
history from the Renaissance to
the Enlightenment in the first
quarter, the Enlightenment to the
19th century in the second
quarter, and the 20th century in
the third quarter.
Of the more than 400 students
who signed up for the first
quarter, only about 250 were
placed, Spitz stated.
"This was a matter of finances.
We set the course in an ideal
fashion with a low student faculty

ratio, especially in the discussion
sections. We chose five teaching
fellows out of 125 applicants for
the sections, so we made a
successful effort to obtain quality
personnel."
Spitz said the department
currently is trying to get
additional funds, and hopes to
accomodate more students next
quarter.
Freshman Reacts
"I was lucky to get in," said
Mike Elliot, a freshman in the
program. "The Renaissance is a
period that isn't covered very well
in high school. Since I'm
interested in theater I especially
wanted to study the culture of
Europe."
"The lectures are good, but
there is so much material to cover
that it's good to have the
discussion sections to clear up
certain points that can't fully be
explained in the lectures," said
Darrah Davis, another student in
the course.

students lacked a fundamental
knowledge of history because of
the obvious deficiencies of
training provided by the
secondary schools," Spitz said.
"Many faculty members who
helped abolish the western
civilization courses have begun to
see the error of free floating
education arranged at the
discretion of inexperienced
students and encouraged by the
indifference of parochial and
views of some of the advisers."
Spitz added that the University
should encourage students to take
advantage of basic courses.
'Balanced Diet'
"Students should realize that
education is not a tray full of hors
d' oeuvres but rather a balanced
diet aimed at producing
intellectual stamina," Spitz said.
"This is the department's attempt
to move to a more structured
program. Experienced professors

are contributing their knowledge
to freshmen and sophomores
rather than have the vital first
courses taught by beginning
instructors."
Although he emphasized that
history is a necessary subject for
all students, Spitz said he is
satisfied that the new history
series need not be required.
"There is no reason to impose
this sequence of courses on
everyone, especially if a student
wants to take a more advanced
class," he said.
Renaissance To Enlightenment
The course sequence includes
history from the Renaissance to
the Enlightenment in the first
quarter, the Enlightenment to the
19th century in the second
quarter, and the 20th century in
the third quarter.
Of the more than 400 students
who signed up for the first
quarter, only about 250 were
placed, Spitz stated.
"This was a matter of finances.
We set the course in an ideal
fashion with a low student faculty

ratio, especially in the discussion
sections. We chose five teaching
fellows out of 125 applicants for
the sections, so we made a
successful effort to obtain quality
personnel."
Spitz said the department
currently is trying to get
additional funds, and hopes to
accomodate more students next
quarter.
Freshman Reacts
"I was lucky to get in," said
Mike Elliot, a freshman in the
program. "The Renaissance is a
period that isn't covered very well
in high school. Since I'm
interested in theater I especially
wanted to study the culture of
Europe."
"The lectures are good, but
there is so much material to cover
that it's good to have the
discussion sections to clear up
certain points that can't fully be
explained in the lectures," said
Darrah Davis, another student in
the course.
A sequence of history courses
started here this autumn attempts
to provide the general student
with a strong, coherent
background in western
civilization, according to Lewis
Spitz, professor of history.
"We are offering courses which
include mainline information and
basic sources regarding the
cultural monuments of western
man," Spitz said. "The history
department is giving general

students a chance to receive the
basic knowledge and depth of
understanding that should be
expected of an educated person."
Spitz explained that the return
of comprehensive courses in the
( history department is part of a
trend away from unstructured
i courses.
I In the late 19605, Stanford and
! many other universities abolished
i freshman history requirements,
' Spitz said. While the department
1 formerly had offered a series of

western civilization courses, these
were largely eliminated in favor of
more specialized courses, he said.
Strong Backgrounds
At the same time, the rising
academic credentials of Stanford
students caused many University
officials to believe that entering
students had strong backgrounds
in history and didn't need an
introductory series of courses,
according to Spitz.
"As a result, many freshmen
and sophomores took a series of
undirected courses with a strong
contemporary emphasis. When the
students reached the upper level
courses, many professors
discovered to their horror that
students lacked a fundamental
knowledge of history because of
the obvious deficiencies of
training provided by the
secondary schools," Spitz said.
