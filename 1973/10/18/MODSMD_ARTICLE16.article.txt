# Ford Confirms He Aided Liddy

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice
President-designate Gerald R.
Ford confirmed Tuesday that he
helped get Watergate conspirator
G. Gordon Liddy a job in
government as a political favor for
another congressman.
But Ford denied another story,
published in a book last year, that
he underwent psychiatric
treatment for a year. He called it a
"categorical inaccuracy."
The House Republican leader
said he called the Treasury
Department to help get Liddy a
job there in 1967 or 1968 at the
request of Rep. Hamilton Fish Jr.,
R-N.Y.
Ford told newsmen: "I said,
'Ham, he's not my constituent,
he's yours. It's your
responsibility. But I'll make a
phone call.' "
Ford said he called the
assistant secretary for trade, and
Liddy subsequently got a job in
the Treasury Department.

Liddy later joined the White
House "plumbers unit" and
became counsel for President
Nixon's re-election finance
committee.
Liddy was convicted of
conspiring to burgle and wiretap
the Democrats' Watergate
national headquarters while he
worked for the Nixon committee.
The allegation that Ford had
psychiatric treatment for a year
from a Dr. Arnold Hutschnecker
in New York City was published
by Washington lobbyist Robert N.
Winter-Berger in his book The
Washington Pay-Off.
Ford told newsmen he visited
Hutschnecker for 15 minutes one
time to meet him â€” not for
treatment.
Hutschnecker said in a
telephone interview from his New
York office that the book's
allegation is untrue.
"He [Ford] never came here as
a patient in the first place,"
Hutschnecker said. "This is sheer
fantasy."
Hutschnecker said Ford did
visit him briefly one day but said
he could not recall why.
Ford said Winter-Berger had
urged him repeatedly to visit
Hutschnecker and he did so while
in New York for a speech.
"He [Winter-Berger] extolled
Hutschnecker's virtues as an
eminent doctor and said I should
meet him," Ford said.
Asked how Winter-Berger had
gotten close enough to Ford to
make such suggestions, Ford said
the lobbyist was originally
introduced to him by longtime
friends.
