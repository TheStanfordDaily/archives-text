# Arabs May Punish U.S.
## Oil Prices May Climb 
### WILLIAM L. RYAN News Analysis 
The new Arab-Israel war can
mean a delayed but painful jolt to
the American consumer and
perhaps even to his West
European and Japanese
counterparts.
The war's impact on an already
worrisome energy situation
depends on whether — and how
much — the Arab oil producers
want to punish Washington for
supporting Israel.
Current figures show that Arab
oil accounts for about 1.1 million
barrels a day of U.S. imports, or
only about six percent of the U.S.
daily consumption. It is highly
unlikely that the Arab nations
ever would act in unison to cut
off all of that. But even what
might seem a relatively small
cutback would hurt in today's
circumstances.
Oil Need Growing
Western thirst for oil rises so
sharply and rapidly that available
statistics tend to fall behind the
actual situation.
But it could easily happen that
measures to conserve energy
would require rapid and
burdensome rationing for the U.S.
public, say industry experts.
Several days ago William E.
Simon, chairman of the
President's Oil Policy Committee,

said that if the United States was
willing to make an all-out
conservation effort it could cut
consumption by as much as three
million barrels a day.
'Severe Rationing?'
"That could be achieved, but
not without very severe
rationing," says John Lichtblau,
an oil economist with the
Petroleum Industry Research
Foundation.
A petroleum planner who
asked to remain anonymous said
that without stringent rationing
the best that might be
accomplished would be a cut of
half that much.
As of this month the United
States was importing 6.4 million
barrels of crude and refinery
products daily, a large chunk of a
daily U.S. consumption estimated
anywhere between 13 and 17
million barrels. The sources of
these imports are Iran, Nigeria,
Canada, Latin America and the
Arab producing countries.
Complicated Story
The oil story is complicated. In
the 1967 Arab-Israel war, the
Arabs declared an embargo, but it
had little impact because the
United States didn't need Arab oil
then.
Today there is no spare
production capacity in the United
States to speak of, or almost any

place else.
Arab producers don't want to
shut off their oil incomes. Even a
temporary shutdown would hurt
and could even damage the Arab
war effort that their contributions
help finance. A selective embargo
seeking to shut off exports to the
United States wouldn't work,
either, because trans-shipment
deals could get the oil to America
anyway.
The most likely action lies in
slowdown of production or
refusal to step it up to meet
ever-growing needs. Japan would
feel the impact quickly, relying as
it does on Middle East imports. So
would Western Europe, market
for 80 percent of Arab oil. In
turn, pressures would increase on
available non-Arab oil supplies.

help finance. A selective embargo
seeking to shut off exports to the
United States wouldn't work,
either, because trans-shipment
deals could get the oil to America
anyway.
The most likely action lies in
slowdown of production or
refusal to step it up to meet
ever-growing needs. Japan would
feel the impact quickly, relying as
it does on Middle East imports. So
would Western Europe, market
for 80 percent of Arab oil. In
turn, pressures would increase on
available non-Arab oil supplies.
The new Arab-Israel war can
mean a delayed but painful jolt to
the American consumer and
perhaps even to his West
European and Japanese
counterparts.
The war's impact on an already
worrisome energy situation
depends on whether — and how
much — the Arab oil producers
want to punish Washington for
supporting Israel.
Current figures show that Arab
oil accounts for about 1.1 million
barrels a day of U.S. imports, or
only about six percent of the U.S.
daily consumption. It is highly
unlikely that the Arab nations
ever would act in unison to cut
off all of that. But even what
might seem a relatively small
cutback would hurt in today's
circumstances.
Oil Need Growing
Western thirst for oil rises so
sharply and rapidly that available
statistics tend to fall behind the
actual situation.
But it could easily happen that
measures to conserve energy
would require rapid and
burdensome rationing for the U.S.
public, say industry experts.
Several days ago William E.
Simon, chairman of the
President's Oil Policy Committee,

said that if the United States was
willing to make an all-out
conservation effort it could cut
consumption by as much as three
million barrels a day.
'Severe Rationing?'
"That could be achieved, but
not without very severe
rationing," says John Lichtblau,
an oil economist with the
Petroleum Industry Research
Foundation.
A petroleum planner who
asked to remain anonymous said
that without stringent rationing
the best that might be
accomplished would be a cut of
half that much.
As of this month the United
States was importing 6.4 million
barrels of crude and refinery
products daily, a large chunk of a
daily U.S. consumption estimated
anywhere between 13 and 17
million barrels. The sources of
these imports are Iran, Nigeria,
Canada, Latin America and the
Arab producing countries.
Complicated Story
The oil story is complicated. In
the 1967 Arab-Israel war, the
Arabs declared an embargo, but it
had little impact because the
United States didn't need Arab oil
then.
Today there is no spare
production capacity in the United
States to speak of, or almost any

place else.
Arab producers don't want to
shut off their oil incomes. Even a
temporary shutdown would hurt
and could even damage the Arab
war effort that their contributions
help finance. A selective embargo

deals could get the oil to America
