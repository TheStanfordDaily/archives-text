# Three Candidates Vie For USE Presidency
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
Three candidates, Jim Berk, Dennis
Davie, and Keith Doty, each of whom
claim to best represent the individual
member, are running for president of
United Stanford Employees (USE).
Ballots for the annual union
election have been distributed this
week and must be returned by next
Wednesday's membership meeting,
when they will be counted.
USE, affiliated with the Service
Employees International Union
(SEIU) of the AFL-CIO, represents
some 1550 University employees.
However, all three candidates for the
top office say they will try to organize
as many other University staffers as
possible.
Davie labels himself and Doty as
"reformist candidates," as opposed to
Berk, who he feels represents the
current leadership of the union. Berk,
a past president, is also the husband of
outgoing USE President Glenda Jones.
According to Davie, "Jim Berk has
been meticulously comprising an
organization in the last few months.
It's starting to be a bureaucracy.
"The danger to USE," Davie said,
"is that a few individuals can create a
bureaucracy that can tend to
perpetuate itself . .. and tend to lead
us away from democracy."
Don't Raise Dues
To counter this, Davie, chairman of
the USE contract demands committee,
has stated, "union dues should not be
raised just to pay a large staff of local
organizers."
While Davie looks upon Doty as
representing a similar position, he said
"I have better possibilities because of
more experience and
knowledge . .. he's not aware of all
the things that go on on campus."
Both Doty and Berk work at
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC), while Davie, formerly a SLAC
employee, now works at the Durant
Aeronautics and Astronautics
Building.
Blue Collar Candidate
Doty differentiates himself from
both Davie and Berk, saying "I'm a
blue collar worker who feels more for
the working people," than his
opponents, who he considers oriented
toward "professional people."
Doty is basing his campaign on the
premise that "the power should be
given back to the people and the union
should be run less by a clique."
As an example, Doty cited the last
membership meeting at which the
members voted to allow photographs
of candidates to appear in the USE
newspaper, Employees Organize.
However, subsequently, the paper's
editorial board voted not to print
photos.
"It's little things like that that show
the vote of the people isn't worth a
darn," Doty said.
Doty added that the only paid
employees of the union should be "a
fulltime secretary and maybe one
organizer."
Berk, put somewhat on the

defensive by his opponents, does not
believe a bureaucracy is developing.
Beginning next week, Berk said, "we
will only have one fulltime employee,
a person in the office [Jones]."
Other than that, Berk says, the
union will have only SEIU organizer
Kit Taylor and about seven area
organizers on the payroll.
The area organizers only work for
USE "about 10 percent of the time,"
and Taylor, "hired for an undefined
temporary period .. . will work
part-time."
'No Danger'
"The way our constitution is
structured," Berk added, "the union is
in no danger of becoming that way
[run by a small group]. The power is
in the hands of the membership. The
decisions are made by the membership
and carried out by the Executive
Committee."
Berk also stresses "unifying as
much support as possible to force the
Trustees to meet our pressing needs,
instead of "changing USE into a 'unit'
union."
While USE represents only the
group of 1550 technical, maintenance
and service employees, including Davie
and Doty, many other union members,
including Berk, do not belong to that
unit, which the National Labor
Relations Board (NLRB) recognizes as
official.

TRYSTING PLACE — A far cry from the Physics Tank, yet the Stanford family
mausoleum is just as much a part of the campus atmosphere and is a favorite
spot of many Stanford students.
