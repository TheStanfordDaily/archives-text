# Augsburger Blasts Limit On Building
## 
### 
A Palo Alto Planning Commission move to gain veto power over all
future buildings at the University has been sharply criticized by
Robert R. Augsburger, University vice-president for business and
finance.
The commission last week recommended an amendment to a
proposed Santa Clara County ordinance originally designed to curb
urban growth in unincorporated areas of the county where municipal
services are needed. Expressing "deep distress" at the Planning
Commission's recommendation, Augsburger pointed out that
"Stanford provides its own municipal services and it has a record of
sound planning since the founding of the institution.
"The evil that the ordinance is intended to correct does not exist
on the campus.
"In effect, the amendment would give Palo Alto the power to
determine the future academic direction of the University. More
importantly, those decisions would be made by officials who have no
political responsibility to Stanford students, faculty, or trustees.
"While the city would have the power to approve or disapprove all
projects by Stanford on the central campus, at the same time the city
would have no obligation to provide municipal services if it did not
wish to annex the project in question."
The proposed ordinance would require buildings in unincorporated
areas to be approved by and annexed to the city in whose urban
service area the lands lie.
All University lands in Santa Clara County are in Palo Alto's
"sphere of influence" and all University property south of Junipero
Serra is within the city's urban service area.
According to Augsburger, the city seeks through the ordinance to
exercise control over the development of all future teaching, research,
and housing facilities on the academic campus.
The University presently holds a use permit from the county under
which academiclaly-related projects are built. The proposed
amendment would pose "an enormous burden" of additional
government steps, Augsburger said.
The proposed amendment is scheduled to be heard by the City
Council Oct. 29 before being forwarded to the County Planning
Commission.
