# Women Qualify For Police Patrol Posts
## 
### CAROL KENDRICK 
The attractive brunette walking
down the corridors of the
Stanford Police Services building
greets several uniformed officers,
who react with appreciative
glances and almost adolescent
confusion. They aren't aware of
what she's really doing here.
The quiet young woman sitting
in the staff room of the station
might be a secretary or officer's
wife, but actually she's just one of
the guys.
The next time you run afoul of
the law at Stanford, you may find
yourself facing the irresistible
charm and the irresistible
authority of Kristin Henderson or
Debbie Whittemore, the first two
female deputy sheriff reserve
officers on the campus police
force.
Henderson and Whittemore
realize the uniqueness of their
situation. In a ten-week course at
the Regional Criminal Justice
Training Center at Modesto

Community College, they are
learning first-aid, firearms, rules of
evidence, and defensive tactics
which they will put to use when
they return to Stanford.
Men 'Coming Around'
According to Whittemore,
when she first began the course in
a class of 94 men and 4 women,
the predominant male attitude
was: "I wouldn't want you to
back me up." But as their
classmates get used to working
with women, they seem to be
coming around.
Henderson said, "We'll have to
go out there and something is
going to happen and we'll have to
prove ourselves." Both look like
they can handle themselves. And
Stanford Police Captain Frank
Benederet is enthusiastic in his
evaluation of the new recruits.
Benederet, a member of the
interviewing board, said that
Whittemore and Henderson
ranked high on the list of those
most qualified of the 150

applicants in their interview
group. "They weren't hired
because they are women, but
because they are qualified," he
said.
Qualified Applicants
Benederet explained that
women have been until recently
excluded from the law
enforcement profession, and that
as the field opens up, the most
highly qualified women are
rushing to apply.
Whittemore, 21, a political
science major at San Jose State
University, said police work was
"always something I wanted to
do." She formerly worked as a
cadet and a desk officer for the
Palo Alto police department.
"The more you get into it, the
more exciting it gets," she said.
Henderson, 23, a former
counselor at Girls' Ranch, a
correctional facility near Gilroy,
looks forward to dealing with a
broad range of people as a police
officer. She said, "I felt that law
enforcement as a woman would
be a unique thing to do."
Discrimination Suit
Henderson sued the city of San
Jose for discriminating against her
when she applied for a job with
the San Jose police department.
Although no formal action came
of the suit, the case stirred enough
publicity that the next applicant
pool had 20 percent women.
Whittemore, on the other
hand, commented, "I'm just doing
it because I want to. I've never
thought of myself as a women's
libber," she said.
Although they're scoring

several points for equal
employment of women, that's not
what concerns them now. "I
didn't come into this work
conscious of the women's
movement," said Henderson.
"If you come off as a real
tough broad, people will react to
you that way. I don't think we'll
have any problems dealing with
people."
Softening Influence
They agreed that women are
good influences on their male
colleagues, who are often
un sensitive to personal
relationships. "Policemen tend to
become hard," said Whittemore.
Neither experts the demands
of police work to raise personal
problems in their lives. Both
women said that their fathers are
nervous about the potential
dangers of their jobs. But
Whittemore's boyfriend, a police
officer, has encouraged her
ambitions, and Henderson's
husband, a teacher, "has a lot of
confidence" in her.
When they return to Stanford
from training, they will be regular
sworn officers, empowered to
carry firearms and make arrests.
They will wear modified versions
of the regulation uniform, with
flared trousers and tailored shirts.
While most police departments
still keep women in the station
behind a desk, Stanford's
expanded police services will soon
give students and residents the
unique opporunity to be arrested
by women. They will certainly be
just as hard to talk out of a traffic
ticket, but at least until the
novelty of the "lady cops" wears
off, this may make the experience
more interesting.
