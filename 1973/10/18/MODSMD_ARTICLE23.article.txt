# Classes Teach Rape Escape Tactics

### SANDY WHITE 
A pair of muscular arms grabs
Debbie suddenly and pins her
from behind. Her assailant thinks
she is helpless, but Debbie is well
prepared. With one loud yell,
"Oiss!" she throws the startled
attacker to the ground.
This scene is a session of a
popular Women's P.E. class,
Self-Defense for Women, and it
could be repeated anytime —
when a girl is walking alone at
night along Campus Drive or
showering in her dorm.
Many Stanford women would
like to be as prepared as Debbie
against assault and rape, and
enrollment is up for self-defense
classes in both the men's and the
women's P.E. departments this
fall. Although Stanford police
statistics show no increase in
sexual assault, fear of its
occurence appears to be growing
on campus.
There is now a long waiting list
for the women's class, but each
class still averages about 12-15
students. One woman currently
enrolled has tried to get in for
several quarters.
Defense Skills
The class is more than a
traditional karate class. Instead of
breaking boards and bricks, the
women learn specifically how to
defend themselves against attack.
Instructor Ronald Blankenhorn,
with a fourth-degree black belt in
Karate, first teaches the women
basic stances, kicks, and blocks,
and then adds Aikido avoidance
techniques. He also uses Judo,
Jujitsu, Yawara, and Kung-fu to
help each woman develop her own
defensive style.
The men's P.E. department
sponsors student-run clubs,
including Shotokan Karate, Tae
Kwon Do, Aikido, Judo, and
Kenpo Karate. Begun only six
years ago, they range in size from
30-140 people, and approximately
one-third of the members are
women.
Why is self-defense so suddenly
important for Stanford women?
Oriental culture holds a new
fascination for some, but most are
more concerned with gaining
independence and self-confidence.
Stanford 'Safe'
Santa Clara County statistics
reflect the nationwide crime
increase: from 1960 to 1970
forcible rape jumped 627 percent.
The number of reported rapes
and rape attempts at Stanford,
however, has remained stable in
the past three academic years.
Police captain Frank Benaderet
said the campus may be "the
safest place for a woman to be
walking alone at night in the
entire Peninsula."
However, not many Stanford
women share Benaderet's view.
The local chapter of Women
Against Rape (WAR) visited
several campus residences last year
to break the silence surrounding
the subject of rape. They heard
many women describe threats and
frightening incidents which were
never reported to the police.
Opportunity for Assault
Long weekends and
between-quarter breaks, which are
notorious for rip-offs, also bring
ready opportunity for sexual
assault. One Stanford woman,
accosted in the shower, convinced
her assailant to wait for her in her
room. Then she ran screaming
into the hall, and he disappeared.
Other women, routinely calling
to a knock, "Come in," found
themselves trapped by unwelcome
visitors. It often takes such an
experience to convince a woman
to sign up for a self-defense class.
Two years ago June (not her
real name) was raped twice in her
home by the same mail. Last year
she took Blankenhorn's class. Her
story illustrates many reasons why
rape is a frightening
and humiliating experience.
'June's' Story
June did not report the first
rape to the police. "1 felt

somehow dirty and low — as if I
were the guilty one," she said. She
remembered an old boyfriend
warning her that if she were ever
raped, she'd be cheapened. But
after the second rape, to which
she submitted under threat, she
notified police.
The rape victim, already,
perhaps, feeling embarrassment
and guilt, faces painful questions
from authorities. A traditional
prejudice blames women for
seducing or provoking their
rapists. This prejudice emerges in
questions from officers like, "Did
you enjoy it?"
And in court she encourters a
real grilling about her sexual past.
Her chastity or promiscuity,
instead of her attacker's record,
may be used to prove or disprove
the rape charge.
Few Convictions
Few rape suspects are
convicted. In San Francisco in
1970, 621 rapes were reported. Of
those, only 59 cases reached
Superior Court, and only 27 were
convicted by the end of that year.
The rape victim seldom gains
more than trouble and
humiliation from reporting a rape.
The communiation gap
between police and community is
one part of the rape problem. The
Palo Alto police department now
lias a woman officer on 24-hour
call, and the Stanford Police are
preparing a rape prevention
presentation.
Another change will place
patrols on foot, on bicycles and
three-wheelers, and in Cushman
carts, as well as in squad cars.
WAR has worked with the police
to build the sensitivity needed for
rape investigation.
Emotional Support
The rape victim may be
accompanied by a friend through
all phases of the investigation.
Rape advocates are also available
to lend emotional support.
Criminologists estimate that
only 5-20 percent of all rapes are
ever reported, and that up to half
a million women are raped each
year.
Rape prevention involves
common sense — realizing one's
own limitations. Many women do
not know how to fight and are
afraid to be aggressive. For
example, Blankenhorn finds that
the "kiai," or yell, is difficult to
teach because the women are too
inhibited to scream in front of
others. Self-defense classes can
build confidence and
self-assurance.
Potential Danger
Although the woman who
knows self-defense is probably the
safest, every woman should be

aware of potential dangers. Most
rapes occur between 8 p.m. and 2
a.m. On campus, the unlighted
streets and Quad provide little
protection from attack. Bike
racks, parking lots, the entrance
to the coffee house, and the long
walk home from the flicks, can all
hide trouble.
In an area where she is positive
she can be heard, a woman's best
bet may be to "scream, scratch,
and run" as Dr. Wesley Ruff,

men's physical education director,
put it.
However, that formula is not
so useful in isolated areas or
deserted dorms. Blankenhorn
teaches a wide variety of possible
escape tactics. He applies basic
techniques to practical situations,
like how to fight off an attacker
in bed. Women who know
self-defense do not look for
trouble — they try to avoid it. But

when that is impossible, they
know how to deal with their
assailant.
(Local rape advocates are available
through: Women Against Rape,
San Jose (408) 287-3000, and
Berkeley 841-0370; The Bridge,
starting in November, 321-2300,
ext. 3392 or ext. 3393, the
Women's Center, ext. 3114, or the
Palo Alto YWCA. The San Jose
group also operates a rap-line.)

USEFUL TACTICS — Self-defense instructor Ronald Blankenhorn
and one of his students demonstrate a practical technique a woman
can use to fight off a would-be assailant. The increasing popularity of
self-defense classes perhaps indicates that many women don't share
Stanford Police Captain Frank Benederet's view that the campus may
be "the safest place for a woman to be walking alone at night on the
entire Peninsula."
