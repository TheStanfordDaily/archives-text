# Anne Loftis Offers Lecture Series
## State Historian Examines Racial Oppression 
### JULIE FAGAN 
Equipped with a journalism degree from
Smith College, and an insatiable interest in
California history, Anne Loftis recently
published her second book California — Where
the Twain Did Meet, a story of oppressed
nationalities and races in California.
Loftis, wife of English Prof. John Loftis, is
giving a series of four lectures focusing on the
highlights of her research, on alternate
Tuesdays, at the Bechtel International Center.
Each presentation concentrates on the
plight of a particular ethnic group from
among California's four major minorities:
native Americans, Mexican-Americans,
Asian-Americans, and black Americans. A
panel of representatives from each division
supplements Loftis' addresses.
She gave the first talk Oct. 9, and, with the
aid of Chris Peters, a Yurock Indian with a
degree in Indian Affairs from UC Davis,
delivered a fascinating but morbid tale of the
treatment of native Americans in California.
Their oppression, which began with their
missionization by Franciscan padres,
continued with the white man's invasions, and
still encumbers California's 91,000 Indians.
Inhumane Treatment
An overflow crowd of more than fifty

persons listened to Loftis, who described the
Franciscans' treatment of the Indians as
slightly despotic, but mild when compared
with that of the white man, which she
characterized as "little more than genocide."
Her evidence, substantiated by Peters'
statistics, demonstrated that the American
settlers who arrived in 1846 devastated Indian
culture.
They disturbed the native Americans' living
arrangements by prohibiting traditional
food-gathering customs.
By forcing the Indians to move from
established locations, their ancestors' burial
grounds, the white men threw the Indians into
emotional turmoil.
Burtal Stereotype
When the Indians finally retaliated, the
whites revived the "fearsome Indian" stories
that had circulated through the eastern United
States, and depicted native Americans as a
brutal, savage group.
Such violent treatment led to a rapid
decline in California's native American
population, from 300,000 to 15,000 in half a
century.
Loftis contends, however, that the Indians'
lot has greatly improved, as they become
assimilated into our political system. Her

statistics show that only about 10 percent of
California's Indians inhabit the state's 84
reservations, the majority of them having
settled in urban centers.
However, she pointed out that native
Americans are not exactly flourishing; they
have the lowest average incomes and the
highest unemployment and suicide rates
among California's racial groups.
Speaker's Aims
Loftis said that Americans must realize and
end the deplorable treatment of fellow human
beings.
She also hopes that eventually the contents
of America — Where the Twain Did Meet will
supplement current history texts in the
California schools.
Loftis will hold her next lecture at 4:15
p.m. at the International Center on Oct. 23,
when Suzy Cabrera and Gary Cavasos will
discuss the history of Mexican-Americans in
California. On Nov. 6, Asian-American
development will be featured. And on Nov.
20, the lecture will focus on black
Americans.
Asked her opinion on women as an
oppressed minority, Loftis replied. "Frankly,
I think of people as people and not in terms
of sexes."
