# Sandwich Series Speakers Discuss Changing Sex Roles
## 
### CAROL KENDRICK 
Sex roles, stereotypes, and potential crisis in
newly liberated relationships are all topics to be
explored and debated by women of the Stanford
community.
Attempting to fill the need for discussion of
changes in modern sex roles, the Stanford YWCA's
Tuesday Sandwich Series demonstrated a new
perspective and an unexpected popularity with its
opening program last week.
Barbara Kline, moderator and organizer of the
series, and a member of the Y-Board, was surprised
by a turn-out of nearly 100 on Oct. 9 as Sandra
Bern, assistant professor of psychology, lectured on
"Masculinity, Feminity, or Androgyny."
Not intended as strictly a "women's liberation"
group, but rather an examination of potentials for
change in sex roles, this year the sandwich series will
cover such topics as marriage and careers, the limits
of affirmative action, discrimination, and changing
lifestyles.
Expanded Scope
Last year's series focused on the changing roles
of women. This year the emphasis will encompass
the changing roles of both males and females in
society.
"This is a general period of re-examining roles,"
said Kline. "Individuals have never had a better
opportunity to choose the kind of life they want to
develop."
Bern's lecture drew an overflow crowd to the
Clubhouse's third floor lounge. The popular

professor described her research on sex role
development to a well-mixed audience of older and
younger women, as well as a scattering of men.
Sex Role Study
Bern explained her studies based on sex role tests
of Stanford undergraduates. She is researching
androgyny — the extent to which individuals
combine both masculine qualities like aggression
and independence with feminine attributes like
warmth and nurturance.
According to Bern, 30 percent of both males and
females score as androgynous on her test. She
characterized masculinity and femininity as
"restriction to one domain of behavior" and
suggested that both extremes may have serious costs
for the individual.
At the second meeting, on Oct. 16, the male
point of view was sampled in a panel discussion title
"What Price Liberation?" The guests were Norma
Davies, Anita Fisher and Mel Deardorf — the first
male speaker in the series.
Effect of Liberation
A group of 50 predominantly older women
attended the noon meeting. An open discussion
explored the effects of female and male liberation
on goals, expectations, and relationships.
The panel considered the options which
liberation opens for both men and women. Fisher
asked, "We think we're so free, but are we really?"
"We don't really know what the effects [of
liberation] are going to be," she concluded. "We're
creating a new kind of woman."

change in sex roles, this year the sandwich series will
cover such topics as marriage and careers, the limits
of affirmative action, discrimination, and changing
lifestyles.
Expanded Scope
Last year's series focused on the changing roles
of women. This year the emphasis will encompass
the changing roles of both males and females in
society.
"This is a general period of re-examining roles,"
said Kline. "Individuals have never had a better
opportunity to choose the kind of life they want to
develop."
Bern's lecture drew an overflow crowd to the
Clubhouse's third floor lounge. The popular

professor described her research on sex role
development to a well-mixed audience of older and
younger women, as well as a scattering of men.
Sex Role Study
Bern explained her studies based on sex role tests
of Stanford undergraduates. She is researching
androgyny — the extent to which individuals
combine both masculine qualities like aggression
and independence with feminine attributes like
warmth and nurturance.
According to Bern, 30 percent of both males and
females score as androgynous on her test. She
characterized masculinity and femininity as
"restriction to one domain of behavior" and
suggested that both extremes may have serious costs
for the individual.
At the second meeting, on Oct. 16, the male
point of view was sampled in a panel discussion title
"What Price Liberation?" The guests were Norma
Davies, Anita Fisher and Mel Deardorf — the first
male speaker in the series.
Effect of Liberation
A group of 50 predominantly older women
attended the noon meeting. An open discussion
explored the effects of female and male liberation
on goals, expectations, and relationships.
The panel considered the options which
liberation opens for both men and women. Fisher
asked, "We think we're so free, but are we really?"
"We don't really know what the effects [of
liberation] are going to be," she concluded. "We're
creating a new kind of woman."
Sex roles, stereotypes, and potential crisis in
newly liberated relationships are all topics to be
explored and debated by women of the Stanford
community.
Attempting to fill the need for discussion of
changes in modern sex roles, the Stanford YWCA's
Tuesday Sandwich Series demonstrated a new
perspective and an unexpected popularity with its
opening program last week.
Barbara Kline, moderator and organizer of the
series, and a member of the Y-Board, was surprised
by a turn-out of nearly 100 on Oct. 9 as Sandra
Bern, assistant professor of psychology, lectured on
"Masculinity, Feminity, or Androgyny."
Not intended as strictly a "women's liberation"
group, but rather an examination of potentials for
change in sex roles, this year the sandwich series will
cover such topics as marriage and careers, the limits
of affirmative action, discrimination, and changing
lifestyles.
