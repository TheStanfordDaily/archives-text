# Women's Committee Seeks 'Central Focus'
## 
### TERRY ANZUR 
Responding to a growing need
for a "central focus for women"
in the University community,
several campus women's groups
have agreed to pool their efforts
through a Women's Coordinating
Committee.
Committee members will
outline plans for collective and
individual group action tonight in
Toyon Lounge at a 6 p.m. potluck
dinner. Gail Thain Parker,
president of Bennington College,
will discuss the concerns of

women in a university
community, in a speech scheduled
for 8 p.m.
The annual potluck
traditionally provides the catalyst
for women's activities throughout
the academic year at Stanford.
After dinner women discuss
upcoming projects, while the men
operate child care facilities.
Ellen Woods, coordinator of
the Women's Center, explained,
"People want to get involved in
activites, but don't know where to
turn. At the potluck they discover

a common interest with everyone
else there."
The "common interest" of
diverse women's groups on
campus will find unified
expression through the efforts of
the coordinating committee.
Committee member Barbara
Brown, who represents Women's
Study Groups, the Committee for
the Education and Employment
of Women (CEEW), and women
residence staffers, emphasizes the
need for women to "present a
united front to the University and

make demands representing every
women's group on campus.
The Women's Center, located
on the third floor of the
Clubhouse, will provide office
services for the committee and its
member groups, and serve as a
clearinghouse for women's
activities on campus.
Brief descriptions of all campus
women's groups and their
activities will be filed at the
women's center. The center will
also serve as a resource center for
information on childcare,
abortion, legal aid, and other
issues of special interest to
women.
ASSU Vice-President Beth
Garfield spearheaded efforts to
create the coordinating committee
last spring in a proposal for an
"Every Woman's Center." At a
recent planning meeting,
prospective board members agreed
to set up the coordination center,
but insisted that the title be
changed to "Women's
Coordinating Committee" to
avoid confusion with the present
Women's Center.
Garfield's original proposal
asserted, "Problems in the past
stemmed from the lack of a
coordinating body from which
[women's] groups can operate,
exchange information, and

discover needs, and recruit new
members."
The committee will combat
this problem by fostering
communication between women's
groups, discovering the general
needs of faculty, student, and
staff women, setting up a
coalition of women who can make
collective demands of the
University, and encouraging
organizations to aid each other in
various group projects.
The board is composed of
representatives of the Women's
Study Groups, the Women's
Recreational Association,
American Indian and Asian
groups, the Black Students Union,
the Gay Women's Union, Law
School Women, and Women in
Science and Engineering.
Other groups on the committee
include the Center for Research
on Women, Bechtel International
Center, the YWCA, the Escondido
Village Council, MeCHA, the
ASSU, and Child Care
Coordinators.
Committee member Linda
Clever will represent the Board of
Trustees, and faculty and staff
women will also participate in
board meetings. Jing Lyman has
been asked to represent University
staff wives.
