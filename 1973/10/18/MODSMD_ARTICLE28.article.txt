## Azteca: Latin Rock Matures 
### JOAN E. HINMAN 
SAN FRANCISCO - Saturday
night at The Matrix, Azteca
clearly demonstrated how far
Latin rock has evolved since the
days of "you've got to change
your evil ways, baby."
The 13-member band
presented cuts from their new
album, Pyramid of the Moon,
blending a machine-gun
percussion section with solidly
explosive brass. Unlike some Latin
groups, Azteca betters a good
thing by adding excellent vocal
talent to a strong instrumental
base.
Wendy Haas provided the
smooth but powerful lead for
"Find Love Today," with Errol
Knowles adding a strong soul taste
to the vocal blend. The flute and
vocal introduction to this piece
was masterful.
Distinctive Guitar
Lead guitarist Bill Courtial was
good throughout the set, showing
particular style on the high
melodic riffs of "Someday We'll
Get By." Courtial's style is
distinctive and not a duplicate of
the Santana-Schon tradition. His
harmony with trumpeter Tom
Harrell on "Whatcha Gonna Do"
was certainly as pleasing as Neil
Schon's guest solo work on the
album.
Early in the set, Azteca
suffered from a lack of
coordination in the percussion
section. As they warmed up, this
one problem smoothed out and

the syncopation of percussion
teamed with short blasts from the
horns became overpowering.
Azteca provided a fine dance
beat, and although The Matrix
was far from being packed, the
sizeable crowd squeezed onto the
small dance floor at the foot of
the stage and boogied throughout
the set.
English Pianist-Singer
Backing up Azteca was Philip
Goodhand-Tait, a pianist from
England performing his own vocal
material. Tait could be likened to
Elton John without handsprings
and headstands off the keyboards.
Tait began his set with a simple
ballad called "Only a Love Song,"
and then switched to the more
rocking "What a Night It Is." Tait
continued to alternate between
quiet ballads and a boogie piano
style.
"Leon," a Tait song which
could have been excellent, was
destroyed first by sound
problems, and then by Tait's own
band. The instrumental
accompaniment became far too
powerful for Tait's voice, and the
lyrics of the song were lost.
Inconsistent Band
Also on the bill was Delta
Wires, a group with good
instrumental talent that was not
always as together as it could have
been. The horns didn't seem solid,
and the harmonica player was
better at throwing his hair around

and doing Joe Cocker's moves
than he was at playing the harp.
In addition, the harmonica
man did most of the lead vocals
and his tenor voice couldn't cut
through the brass decisively. The
lead guitarist on the other hand
was the true vocal talent of the
group, yet he only sang two songs.
Generally, Delta Wires put
together a good boogie style, but
to succeed they'll have to be more
cohesive.
