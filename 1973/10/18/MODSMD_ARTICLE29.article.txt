# 'The Day After The Fair' Displays Theatrical Talents Of Deborah Kerr
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
SAN FRANCISCOâ€”7?ze Day After The
Fair is a pleasant and intelligent theatrical
vehicle for the outstanding acting talents of
Deborah Kerr. Adapted by Frank Harvey
from a Thomas Hardy tale, the play is
enjoying an 11-day run at the Curran Theatre
ending this Saturday.
The play is Kerr's from start to finish.
Playing a frustrated wife of a prominent
brewer in Hardy's Wessex countryside, Kerr
takes her illiterate servant girl Anna under her
wing. The girl meets a gentleman from
London at the local fair and falls quite in love.
When the gentleman, Charles Bradford,
returns to London he sends Anna letters
expressing his love. Anna implores her
mistress to write Bradford back and Ken
becomes enmeshed in a romantic tangle.
Ignored by her husband, Kerr gives way to her
hidden desires for expression and fervently
answers Bradford's letters.
The play becomes quite contrived at times

but it does not really ask to be believed. The
play is much like Hardy's writing. It consists
of witty and engaging characters spinning
through a series of whimsically improbable
events.
Competing For Lover
The plot takes a turn when Anna reveals
that she is lumbered (an appropriate Hardy
term for pregnant). The two women fight over
their separate claims to the handsome
Londoner. He is enamored of Anna's body
but has been communicating mind and soul
with Kerr. This unlikely situation provides the
theme for the remainder of the play.
The supporting cast is solid, managing to
make an impression despite the tremendous
stage presence of Kerr.
Vickery Turner gives an excellent
performance as Anna, the naive, illiterate
servant girl defiantly standing on her claim to
a man worlds apart from her. Some of the
best scenes in the play take place between

Turner and Kerr, and the young actress holds
her own very well.
Key Supporting Role
The only other supporting actor with a
highly dramatic impact is Michael Shannon as
Bradford. He is not seen in the play until the
second act when he attempts to unravel the
romantic entanglement he unexpectedly finds
himself in. Shannon does an admirable job of
portraying a naive young barrister trying to
get ahead in the world.
The play is to be seen for Miss Kerr
however. Her theatre and movie credits are
impeccable and it is a delight to see her work
on stage. She is a thorough professional. The
play builds in intensity so that at the curtain
calls, Kerr was trembling noticeably from the
emotional peak she attained in the final scene.
She pays complete attention to every
nuance of her portrayal on stage. It is worth
the trip to the city to see an actress of Kerr's
caliber give so complete a performance in a
play that proves engaging.
