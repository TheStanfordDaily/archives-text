# 'Fierce Battles' Rage In Sinai; Arab Nations Cut Oil Production
## 
### Associated Press 
The Israeli command claimed
destruction of at least 90 Egyptian
tanks yesterday along the Suez Canal,
and its top military man declared "we
are now calling the tune."
The Egyptian command reported
"fierce battles" along the central and
souther Sinai front and claimed Israeli
forces suffered "heavy losses in tanks
and armored cars."
On the Syrian front, Syrian artillery
barrages crashed down on Israelis
stalled on the road to Damascus.
In Kuwait, an organization of Arab
oil-producing countries announced it
has decided to cut oil production by
not less than 5 percent immediately
and an additional 5 percent each
succeeding month until Israel
withdraws from occupied Arab lands
and Palestinian refugees' rights are

restored.
Israel's chief of staff, Lt. Gen.
David Elazar, the head of Tel Aviv's
armies, said Israel's main effort was
not concentrated against the
Egyptians, and "we are now initiating
the attacks on both sides of the Suez
Canal."
The Israeli state radio's top
commentator, former army
intelligence chief Maj. Gen. Haim
Herzog, called the Suez battle "the
biggest armored clash in our military
history."
The Israeli command said
"large-scale armored battles" raged in
the central area along the canal.
West Bank Crossed
Elazar did not indicate if assaults
by Tel Aviv forces on the west bank
involved an Israeli task force that the
command said Tuesday had crossed
the waterway to operate in Egypt
proper.
Another military spokesman said
yesterday that the task force, whose
size has not been specified, "continues
to operate in Egypt proper."
"It had encountered rear command
posts," said a military spokesman. "It
has tried to destroy them and has
succeeded."
White House Meeting
President Nixon met at the White
House with four Arab foreign
ministers dispatched to Washington
from U.N. duty to discuss American
military aid to Israel.
Nixon acknowledged afterward that
the four — from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia,
Morocco and Algeria — had
"differences" with American policy in
the Middle East. But he expressed
confidence "a fair and just and
peaceful settlement" can end the war,
now 12 days old.
King Hussein
King Hussein of Jordan said the
future of the Middle East will be
shaped by the outcome of the conflict,
the fourth major Arab-Israeli war since
the birth of Israel in 1948.
"We may still be very far from
peace . .. Yet we may be very close to
it,"he told newsmen in Amman in his

first public statements since fighting
broke out. "I believe very strongly
that Israel is now in a position to make
up her mind, and should do so."
The 37-year-old monarch, who lost
much of his kingdom including East
Jerusalem in the 1967 war, is reported
to have come under heavy pressure
from other Arab nations to enter the
war full-scale and turn his 250-mile
border with Israel into a third front,
draining Israeli energies from Syria and
the Sinai.
Syrian Front
The Israeli push into Syria
remained blocked for the fourth day
on the approaches to Sasa, a town
about 21 miles southwest of Damascus
and about 19 miles beyond the
cease-fire lines drawn when Israel
seized the Golan Heights from Syria in
1967.
Syrian artillery rained shells on the
battle-scarred road to Damascus.
Associated Press photographer Horst
Faas said from the front that dust

swirling up from explosions was so
thick it clouded the view of Mt.
Hermon looking down on the
battleground.
Counterattack
Syria said its armor also resumed a
counterattack against the Israeli forces
that have punched into Syria along a
jagged 20-mile wide front.
The Syrians said Israeli planes also
attacked Syria's two main
Mediterranean ports of Latakia and
Tartus for at least the third time in
war. The ports are said to be funnels
for Soviet military aid reported
pouring into Syria and Egypt.
Arab oil ministers met in Kuwait to
discuss using their oil as a weapon
against Israel and those who support
the Israelis.
The U.S. officials in Washington
said the Soviets are bringing in supplies
for the Arab side about as fast as the
Americans are bringin them in for the
Israelis. The Soviet effort also includes
tanks and fighter planes, they added.
