# 'Beard' Still Shocks Audiences
## 
### SHERIDAN CRAWFORD 
SAN FRANCISCO—A man and
a woman, a stage, and all of
eternity. He is Billy the Kid and
she Jean Harlow. The stage is one
part of a functional little theater,
the Firehouse Theatre on
California Street in San Francisco.
All of eternity is the time span of
Michael McClure's The Beard,
having currently been revived by
the Magic Theatre of Berkeley.
Eight years ago when The
Beard was first presented in play
form to audiences, the collective
gasp and shudder prevailed. It was
busted for its explosive sexual
scene at the end. People walked
out. McClure's language hit blow
after gut-thudding blow, but even
now in the year of the blase
theatergoer, the impact is still felt.
Most of the riveting force of
this heated man-woman encounter
is to be attributed to Cecily

Yahya as Jean Harlow, and Joel
Brooks as Billy the Kid. The two
give powerful performances which
raise these two stars from the
dead, and make them seem eons
away from burning out.
The actual form of The Beard
— the staging, dialogue, movement
on stage — is a creative product of
the Magic Theatre under the
direction of John Lion.
First published in the shape of
a prose poem, this current
production retains much of the
original rhyming and pacing of the
poem as it surges back and forth
between Billy and Jean.
Neither Jean or Billy remain in
one palce. They are always
moving ahead, switching roles.
Man becomes woman, woman
becomes man, the traps are set,
and one after another they are set
off. The audience sees a man and a
woman with all of eternity trying

to become one.
The Beard was preceded by
another play, Spider Rabbit. Scott
Paulin plays the lead role as a
deranged Captain Kangaroo made
socially conscious. His
many-faceted role leads him down
the dark by-ways to the odd and
dreary life of multi-schizos.
He is also crazy. Even though

Spider Rabbit can turn around
and turn into just about anything
he comes upon, he is not Man.
But he might be.
Neither The Beard nor Spider
Rabbit will neatly resolve any of
its crucial issues, but both can go
a long way in the mind of the
viewer. Their San Francisco run is
nearing an end, and it is urgent
that they be seen immediately.
