# 'Bread' Veteran Gates Shines On Solo Album
## 
### 
David Gates: First
Elektra EKS 75066
David Gates' First album
fulfills the appetites of any Bread
lover. Gates, the former lead
singer of Bread, recently spun out
(or whatever) taking with him his
distinctive, suave, melodic voice
to create ten separate satin sounds
— gently gathering them into a
powerful album.
After listening to First a
second time, it seems that Gates
succeeds in superceding Bread's
sound. His selections are an
extension of the elements which
have made Bread so popular.
No one has ever accused Gates
of producing a classical sound, but
besides having a voice with the
range of a piano, he produces an
amazing amount of contrasting
sound intensity. His music is the
type that can tingle your nerves,
even if you're not really listening.
All compositions are superb,
especially "Lorilee" and the
medley of "Clouds" and "Rain."
The variety of cuts were written,
produced, and arranged by the
soloist with occasional help from
his friends, including ex-Bread
colleague, Larry Knechtel.
"Do You Believe He's
Comin' "... Well he's here and
he'll "Sail You Around The
World" with his polished "Sight
and Sound" productions.

New Riders of the Purple Sage:
The Adventures of Panama Red
Columbia KC 32450
The New Riders have added

one more to their impressive
string of psychedelic cowboy rock
albums. Panama Red is every bit
as good as its predecessors, and
reaches into some areas new to
the band.
Two of my favorite tracks on
the album, the title song and
"Lonesome L.A. Cowboy," were
written by Peter Rowan of the
Rowan Brothers, another Bay
Area-based country band. Both
have fairly simple and obvious
drug-related lyrics, as in the
chorus of "L.A. Cowboy": "And
I'm smokin' dope, snortin' coke,
tryin' to write a song/ Forgettin'
everything I know 'til the next
line comes along."
One new feature on Panama
Red is the addition of brass, in the
form of the Memphis Homs. This
free-lance group has been widely
featured on albums by lots of
artists, and its versatility really
complements the NRPS sound.
Of course, the basic band is
still as good as ever. Dave Torbert
and John Dawson provide most of
the singing and songwriting, and
Buddy Cage's pedal steel is up
there with lie best of Nashville.
One of the most interesting
rock tunes is "Thank the Day,"
with some nice harmonica work.
The Memphis Homs provide
the extra punch in "Important
Exportin' Man," another solid
rocker.
As usual, the album contains
its special "thought-provoking"
number, this time "Cement, Clay,
and Glass." This anti-urban-sprawl
message seems especially effective
coming from a "countr," Dand.
In all, Panama Red is a good
addition to anybody's NRPS
collection. It has all of the
strengths of their past albums
without being repetitive, plus a
few new touches.
