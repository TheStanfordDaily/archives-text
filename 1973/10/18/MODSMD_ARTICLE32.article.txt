# Male Roles Dominate Wagner Opera
## 'Tannhaueser' Lacks Balance 
### DOUG SMITH 
SAN FRANCISCO—Despite
the fact that many of the
principals are famous for their
roles, having performed them at
Bayreuth and on recordings, this
season's San Francisco Opera
production of Tannhaeuser is a
vocally uneven one, weighted in
favor of the men.
The perceptive audience at the
War Memorial Opera House
Friday night reserved its greatest
applause for the conductor,
Otmar Suitner.
The hand of the master was
revealed already in the overture.
Maestro Suitzer gave an
exceptionally spirited, articulate
rendering, which was marred only
by rough intonation on the part
of a few violinists. The brasses
played well all evening.
The curtain rose to reveal an
orgiastic ballet, with members of
the San Francisco Opera Ballet
writhing and entwining like a can
full of worms.
Jess Thomas is presently the

world's reigning Wagnerian heroic
tenor, but was nonetheless not
completely satisfactory in the role
of Tannhaeuser. He has a slow,
wide wobble in his voice, and it
seemed at any given point in the
opera that his line was just about
to get away from him.
On the positive side, he
certainly looks the part, his voice
is powerful, and his diction is very
good, except for a comical
tendency to rrrrroll his rrrrr's.
Marita Napier was competent,
if not outstanding, as Venus. She
was outshone by Leonie Rysanek
as Elizabeth, who made a strong
impression from her first
entrance. However, even Miss
Rysanek's performance was
uneven.
Best In High Range
She was best at the very top of
her range, the radiant high B in
"Dich, teure Halle," and in piano
passages. Miss Rysanek showed
less of the traditional Wagnerian
declamatory singing than some of
the rest of the cast, but her tone

in her middle range was rather
strident.
Thomas Stewart, like Jess
Thomas on American who became
famous at Bayreuth, was very fine
in the role of Wolfram von
Eschenbach. By the end of the
evening, in his aria "O du mein
holder Abendstern," he was in
rare form, producing wonderful
clarity in both vocal tones and
diction.
However, the singer who won
Friday's Sanger krieg auf der
Wartburg was Clifford Grant in his
portrayal of Landgraf Hermann.
The Landgraf is a sympathetic
role, and Grant's bass voice is so
beautiful that he could make the
audience weep with a C scale.
Unlike Jess Thomas and the
women, Grant was at all times in
perfect control of his part.
Good Supporting Roles
William Neill, Hafry Dworchak,
James AtherttflT and Philip Booth
were strong in their supporting
roles.
Another helpful supporting
role was that of Stanford's Bill
Benjamin, playing the offstage
English horn solo in scene two.
Wolfram Skalicki's scenery was
very effective, especially the scene
change in the first act, where a
cavernous Venusberg was
suddenly transformed into an
idyllic forest glade merely with
the use of lights.
In all it was a good, but not
stellar performance of a good, but
not stellar opera.
