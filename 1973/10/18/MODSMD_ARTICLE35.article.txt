WASHINGTON — The United States and the
Soviet Union have engaged in extensive discussions
in the last few days in efforts to find a solution to
the Middle East conflict, it was learned yesterday.
U.S. officials are known to feel that the
discussions have not reached the point of specific
language for a solution. But they believe there has
been a change in the diplomatic situation. 1
The talks apparently have taken place between
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and Anatoly
Dobrynin, the Soviet ambassador to the United
States.
Sources at the United Nations indicate,
meanwhile, that there have been little, if any,
meaningful discussions in New York on the matter.
Among the possibilities coming from the
U.S.-Soviet discussions are a cease-fire in place or a
return to the boundaries existing before the Arab
attack nearly two weeks ago.
The talks with the Soviet Union are understood
to go beyond a cease-fire itself to cover an over-all
settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
In a related matter, State Department spokesman
Robert J. McCloskey said yesterday an American
route has been established for the air delivery of
arms and other military equipment to Israel.
McCloskey declined to outline the delivery route,
but the United States has an agreement with
Portugal allowing American military aircraft to land
and refuel in the Azores in the Middle Atlantic.
Arabs Cut Oil Production
KUWAIT — A group of Arab oil-producing
countries announced yesterday they would cut oil
production by a minimum of five percent
immediately and an additional five percent each
succeeding month until Israel withdraws from
occupied Arab territory and restores Palestinian
refugees' rights.
The Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting
Countries took the action at a meeting held in
Kuwait to determine how to use oil resources as a
weapon against Israel and its supporters in the
Middle East war.
Oil production cutbacks also were an underlying
concern as President Nixon met in Washington with
the foreign ministers of Algeria, Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait and Morocco for 50 minutes.
Nixon said afterward that while there were
differences between the Arabs and the United States
he believes "a fair and just and peaceful settlement"
can be reached in the war.
The U.S. House of Representatives, meanwhile,
passed an across-the-board mandatory fuel
allocation bill that would go beyond the Nixon
administration's limited program.
The bill, opposed by the administration, would
not solve the energy crisis but would spread the
expected shortage of petroleum fuels evenly, its
supporters said.
The Washington action came amid reports of
increased fighting in the Middle East, accelerating
U.S. efforts to resupply Israel and growing concern
about the effects of an Arab production cutback.
Although the United States imports only about 6
percent of its crude oil from the Arab countries,
administration planners are counting on imports of
refined heating oil from Europe to avert a shortage
this winter.
Most of the Persian Gulf crude goes to Western

Europe and Japan. If there was a shortage there
would be little chance of getting the refined
products that the planners anticipate importing.
Suit Against Nixon Dismissed
WASHINGTON — A federal judge ruled
yesterday that the Senate Watergate committee has
no authority to sue President Nixon in an effort to
obtain White House tapes of presidential
conversations.
U.S. District Court Judge John J. Sirica's
dismissal of the committee's civil suit marked the
first legal victory for the President in his battle to
withhold the tapes from the committee and special
Watergate prosecutor.
Two court decisions have affirmed the special
prosecutor's argument that the President must give
the tapes to a federal grand jury investigating the
scandal.
But Sirica said the committee had failed to get
congressional authority to sue the President.
A committee spokesman said the decision would
probably be appealed.
Meanwhile, three corporations which admitted
making illegal contributions to President Nixon's
re-election campaign pleaded guilty to misdemeanor
violations of federal law.
In a brief order, Sirica said the court lacked
jurisdiction in the tapes suit, an argument made by
the White House in its opposition to the
committee's civil action.
"No jurisdictional statute known to the court,
including the four which plaintiffs name, warrants
an assumption of jurisdiction, and the court is
therefore left with no alternative here but to dismiss
the action," Sirica said.
Sirica's decision followed by less than a week the
U.S. Court of Appeals ruling upholding his earlier
order in the case involving nine tapes subpoenaed by
special Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox.
In that case Sirica ordered the President to give
him the tapes to hear in private so that he could
determine if Nixon's claim that they must be kept
secret was valid.
The President is expected to carry his appeal in
that case to the Supreme Court. He has until
tomorrow to ask the Supreme Court to review the
case.
The three companies charged yesterday with
misdemeanors over campaign contributions are
American Airlines, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co.,
and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co.
Charges were also filed against the board chairmen
of Goodyear and Minnesota Mining.
Goodyear and its board chairman, Russell
deYoung, pleaded guilty in federal court in
Cleveland. The company was fined $5000 and
deYoung $1000, the maximum fines for each.
After entering guilty pleas in federal court in St.
Paul, Minn., Minnesota Mining was fined $3000 and
its board chairman and chief executive officer,
Harry Heltzer, $500.
American Airlines entered a guilty plea and was
fined $5000.
The companies and their executives were charged
with violating federal law which prohibits campaign
contributions from corporate funds.
Jackson New Atlanta Mayor
ATLANTA, Ga. — Gov. Jimmy Carter said
yesterday that the election of a black as mayor of
Atlanta and a white as city council president

showed "that there has been no polarization" in
Atlanta.
Maynard Jackson, 35, won the mayoral post
from incumbent Sam Massed with 20 percent of the
votes in white precincts as well as overwhelming
support from black areas in a runoff election
Tuesday.
He gained 59.2 percent of the total vote in the
election. At the same time, Wyche Fowler, a
moderate white, defeated Hosea Williams, a black
civil rights activist, by a three-to-one margin for the
city council presidency.
The racial issue was a key one in the mayoral
runoff and Carter said, "I am very grateful that the
outcome does not indicate any racial division in the
city. The simultaneous election of Maynard Jackson
and Wyche Fowler ... is a fine indication that there
has been no polarization in the capital city."
Jackson, who will take office next Jan. 7 as the
first black chief executive of a major city in the
South, said after his victory: "Sam's tactics
backfired on him ... I never lost faith in this city."
World Series Deadlocked
NEW YORK — Rusty Staub drove in five runs,
three of them with a first-inning home run as the
New York Mets took a 6-1 lead over the Oakland
A's last night after four innings of their fourth
World Series game.
The Mets knocked out Oakland starter Ken
Holtzman in the first. Leadoff Batter Wayne Garrett
singled and Felix Millan beat out a bunt down the
third-base line for a single before Staub lined his
home run over the left-center field wall.
John "Blue Moon" Odom took over for Oakland
and Don Hahn grounded into an inning-ending
double play on Odom's first pitch.
Mets pitcher John Matlack held the A's hitless
until the fourth inning. Sal Bando was safe on
Garrett's fielding error, Reggie Jackson singled to
right-center to send Bando to third and he scored as
Gene Tenace grounded out.
In the bottom of the fourth, Hahn and Bud
Harrelson singled and Darold Knowles replaced
Odom on the mound for Oakland. He struck out
Matlack but hit Garrett with a pitch to load the
bases.
Then Millan grounded to second — and Dick
Green bobbled the ball. Hahn scored and the bases
remained loaded. Staub followed with a two-run
ground single to right, scoring Harrelson and
Garrett.
Knowles then walked Cleon Jones to load the
bases again. But Milner grounded into a
pitcher-to-home-to-first double play to end the
uprising.
The victory deadlocked the best-of-seven series at
two games apiece with Game Five scheduled for
tonight in New York. The teams return to Oakland
for the sixth game Saturday afternoon.

World Series Deadlocked
NEW YORK — Rusty Staub drove in five runs,
three of them with a first-inning home run as the
New York Mets took a 6-1 lead over the Oakland
A's last night after four innings of their fourth
World Series game.
The Mets knocked out Oakland starter Ken
Holtzman in the first. Leadoff Batter Wayne Garrett
singled and Felix Millan beat out a bunt down the
third-base line for a single before Staub lined his
home run over the left-center field wall.
John "Blue Moon" Odom took over for Oakland
and Don Hahn grounded into an inning-ending
double play on Odom's first pitch.
Mets pitcher John Matlack held the A's hitless
until the fourth inning. Sal Bando was safe on
Garrett's fielding error, Reggie Jackson singled to
right-center to send Bando to third and he scored as
Gene Tenace grounded out.
In the bottom of the fourth, Hahn and Bud
Harrelson singled and Darold Knowles replaced
Odom on the mound for Oakland. He struck out
Matlack but hit Garrett with a pitch to load the
bases.
Then Millan grounded to second — and Dick
Green bobbled the ball. Hahn scored and the bases
remained loaded. Staub followed with a two-run
ground single to right, scoring Harrelson and
Garrett.
Knowles then walked Cleon Jones to load the
bases again. But Milner grounded into a
pitcher-to-home-to-first double play to end the
uprising.
The victory deadlocked the best-of-seven series at
two games apiece with Game Five scheduled for
tonight in New York. The teams return to Oakland
for the sixth game Saturday afternoon.

UJS., Russia Discuss
WASHINGTON — The United States and the
Soviet Union have engaged in extensive discussions
in the last few days in efforts to find a solution to
the Middle East conflict, it was learned yesterday.
U.S. officials are known to feel that the
discussions have not reached the point of specific
language for a solution. But they believe there has
been a change in the diplomatic situation. 1
The talks apparently have taken place between
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and Anatoly
Dobrynin, the Soviet ambassador to the United
States.
Sources at the United Nations indicate,
meanwhile, that there have been little, if any,
meaningful discussions in New York on the matter.
Among the possibilities coming from the
U.S.-Soviet discussions are a cease-fire in place or a
return to the boundaries existing before the Arab
attack nearly two weeks ago.
The talks with the Soviet Union are understood
to go beyond a cease-fire itself to cover an over-all
settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
In a related matter, State Department spokesman
Robert J. McCloskey said yesterday an American
route has been established for the air delivery of
arms and other military equipment to Israel.
McCloskey declined to outline the delivery route,
but the United States has an agreement with
Portugal allowing American military aircraft to land
and refuel in the Azores in the Middle Atlantic.
Arabs Cut Oil Production
KUWAIT — A group of Arab oil-producing
countries announced yesterday they would cut oil
production by a minimum of five percent
immediately and an additional five percent each
succeeding month until Israel withdraws from
occupied Arab territory and restores Palestinian
refugees' rights.
The Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting
Countries took the action at a meeting held in
Kuwait to determine how to use oil resources as a
weapon against Israel and its supporters in the
Middle East war.
Oil production cutbacks also were an underlying
concern as President Nixon met in Washington with
the foreign ministers of Algeria, Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait and Morocco for 50 minutes.
Nixon said afterward that while there were
differences between the Arabs and the United States
he believes "a fair and just and peaceful settlement"
can be reached in the war.
The U.S. House of Representatives, meanwhile,
passed an across-the-board mandatory fuel
allocation bill that would go beyond the Nixon
administration's limited program.
The bill, opposed by the administration, would
not solve the energy crisis but would spread the
expected shortage of petroleum fuels evenly, its
supporters said.
The Washington action came amid reports of
increased fighting in the Middle East, accelerating
U.S. efforts to resupply Israel and growing concern
about the effects of an Arab production cutback.
Although the United States imports only about 6
percent of its crude oil from the Arab countries,
administration planners are counting on imports of
refined heating oil from Europe to avert a shortage
this winter.
Most of the Persian Gulf crude goes to Western

Europe and Japan. If there was a shortage there
would be little chance of getting the refined
products that the planners anticipate importing.
Suit Against Nixon Dismissed
WASHINGTON — A federal judge ruled
yesterday that the Senate Watergate committee has
no authority to sue President Nixon in an effort to
obtain White House tapes of presidential
conversations.
U.S. District Court Judge John J. Sirica's
dismissal of the committee's civil suit marked the
first legal victory for the President in his battle to
withhold the tapes from the committee and special
Watergate prosecutor.
Two court decisions have affirmed the special
prosecutor's argument that the President must give
the tapes to a federal grand jury investigating the
scandal.
But Sirica said the committee had failed to get
congressional authority to sue the President.
A committee spokesman said the decision would
probably be appealed.
Meanwhile, three corporations which admitted
making illegal contributions to President Nixon's
re-election campaign pleaded guilty to misdemeanor
violations of federal law.
In a brief order, Sirica said the court lacked
jurisdiction in the tapes suit, an argument made by
the White House in its opposition to the
committee's civil action.
"No jurisdictional statute known to the court,
including the four which plaintiffs name, warrants
an assumption of jurisdiction, and the court is
therefore left with no alternative here but to dismiss
the action," Sirica said.
Sirica's decision followed by less than a week the
U.S. Court of Appeals ruling upholding his earlier
order in the case involving nine tapes subpoenaed by
special Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox.
In that case Sirica ordered the President to give
him the tapes to hear in private so that he could
determine if Nixon's claim that they must be kept
secret was valid.
The President is expected to carry his appeal in
that case to the Supreme Court. He has until
tomorrow to ask the Supreme Court to review the
case.
The three companies charged yesterday with
misdemeanors over campaign contributions are
American Airlines, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co.,
and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co.
Charges were also filed against the board chairmen
of Goodyear and Minnesota Mining.
Goodyear and its board chairman, Russell
deYoung, pleaded guilty in federal court in
Cleveland. The company was fined $5000 and
deYoung $1000, the maximum fines for each.
After entering guilty pleas in federal court in St.
Paul, Minn., Minnesota Mining was fined $3000 and
its board chairman and chief executive officer,
Harry Heltzer, $500.
American Airlines entered a guilty plea and was
fined $5000.
The companies and their executives were charged
with violating federal law which prohibits campaign
contributions from corporate funds.
Jackson New Atlanta Mayor
ATLANTA, Ga. — Gov. Jimmy Carter said
yesterday that the election of a black as mayor of
Atlanta and a white as city council president

from incumbent Sam Massed with 20 percent of the
votes in white precincts as well as overwhelming
support from black areas in a runoff election
Tuesday.
He gained 59.2 percent of the total vote in the

no authority to sue President Nixon in an effort to
obtain White House tapes of presidential
conversations.
U.S. District Court Judge John J. Sirica's
dismissal of the committee's civil suit marked the
first legal victory for the President in his battle to
withhold the tapes from the committee and special
Watergate prosecutor.
Two court decisions have affirmed the special
prosecutor's argument that the President must give
the tapes to a federal grand jury investigating the
scandal.
But Sirica said the committee had failed to get
congressional authority to sue the President.
A committee spokesman said the decision would
probably be appealed.
Meanwhile, three corporations which admitted
making illegal contributions to President Nixon's
re-election campaign pleaded guilty to misdemeanor
violations of federal law.
In a brief order, Sirica said the court lacked
jurisdiction in the tapes suit, an argument made by
the White House in its opposition to the
committee's civil action.
"No jurisdictional statute known to the court,
including the four which plaintiffs name, warrants
an assumption of jurisdiction, and the court is
therefore left with no alternative here but to dismiss
the action," Sirica said.
Sirica's decision followed by less than a week the
U.S. Court of Appeals ruling upholding his earlier
order in the case involving nine tapes subpoenaed by
special Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox.
In that case Sirica ordered the President to give
him the tapes to hear in private so that he could
determine if Nixon's claim that they must be kept
secret was valid.
The President is expected to carry his appeal in
that case to the Supreme Court. He has until
tomorrow to ask the Supreme Court to review the
case.
The three companies charged yesterday with
misdemeanors over campaign contributions are
American Airlines, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co.,
and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co.
Charges were also filed against the board chairmen
of Goodyear and Minnesota Mining.
Goodyear and its board chairman, Russell
deYoung, pleaded guilty in federal court in
Cleveland. The company was fined $5000 and
deYoung $1000, the maximum fines for each.
After entering guilty pleas in federal court in St.
Paul, Minn., Minnesota Mining was fined $3000 and
its board chairman and chief executive officer,
Harry Heltzer, $500.
American Airlines entered a guilty plea and was
fined $5000.
The companies and their executives were charged
with violating federal law which prohibits campaign
contributions from corporate funds.
Jackson New Atlanta Mayor
ATLANTA, Ga. — Gov. Jimmy Carter said
yesterday that the election of a black as mayor of
Atlanta and a white as city council president

showed "that there has been no polarization" in
Atlanta.
Maynard Jackson, 35, won the mayoral post
from incumbent Sam Massed with 20 percent of the
votes in white precincts as well as overwhelming
support from black areas in a runoff election
Tuesday.
He gained 59.2 percent of the total vote in the
election. At the same time, Wyche Fowler, a
moderate white, defeated Hosea Williams, a black
civil rights activist, by a three-to-one margin for the
city council presidency.
The racial issue was a key one in the mayoral
runoff and Carter said, "I am very grateful that the
outcome does not indicate any racial division in the
city. The simultaneous election of Maynard Jackson
and Wyche Fowler ... is a fine indication that there
has been no polarization in the capital city."
Jackson, who will take office next Jan. 7 as the
first black chief executive of a major city in the
South, said after his victory: "Sam's tactics
backfired on him ... I never lost faith in this city."
World Series Deadlocked
NEW YORK — Rusty Staub drove in five runs,
three of them with a first-inning home run as the
New York Mets took a 6-1 lead over the Oakland
A's last night after four innings of their fourth
World Series game.
The Mets knocked out Oakland starter Ken
Holtzman in the first. Leadoff Batter Wayne Garrett
singled and Felix Millan beat out a bunt down the
third-base line for a single before Staub lined his
home run over the left-center field wall.
John "Blue Moon" Odom took over for Oakland
and Don Hahn grounded into an inning-ending
double play on Odom's first pitch.
Mets pitcher John Matlack held the A's hitless
until the fourth inning. Sal Bando was safe on
Garrett's fielding error, Reggie Jackson singled to
right-center to send Bando to third and he scored as
Gene Tenace grounded out.
In the bottom of the fourth, Hahn and Bud
Harrelson singled and Darold Knowles replaced
Odom on the mound for Oakland. He struck out
Matlack but hit Garrett with a pitch to load the
bases.
Then Millan grounded to second — and Dick
Green bobbled the ball. Hahn scored and the bases
remained loaded. Staub followed with a two-run
ground single to right, scoring Harrelson and
Garrett.
Knowles then walked Cleon Jones to load the
bases again. But Milner grounded into a
pitcher-to-home-to-first double play to end the
uprising.
The victory deadlocked the best-of-seven series at
two games apiece with Game Five scheduled for
tonight in New York. The teams return to Oakland
for the sixth game Saturday afternoon.

UJS., Russia Discuss
WASHINGTON — The United States and the
Soviet Union have engaged in extensive discussions
in the last few days in efforts to find a solution to
the Middle East conflict, it was learned yesterday.
U.S. officials are known to feel that the
discussions have not reached the point of specific
language for a solution. But they believe there has
been a change in the diplomatic situation. 1
The talks apparently have taken place between
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and Anatoly
Dobrynin, the Soviet ambassador to the United
States.
Sources at the United Nations indicate,
meanwhile, that there have been little, if any,
meaningful discussions in New York on the matter.
Among the possibilities coming from the
U.S.-Soviet discussions are a cease-fire in place or a
return to the boundaries existing before the Arab
attack nearly two weeks ago.
The talks with the Soviet Union are understood
to go beyond a cease-fire itself to cover an over-all
settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
In a related matter, State Department spokesman
Robert J. McCloskey said yesterday an American
route has been established for the air delivery of
arms and other military equipment to Israel.
McCloskey declined to outline the delivery route,
but the United States has an agreement with
Portugal allowing American military aircraft to land
and refuel in the Azores in the Middle Atlantic.
Arabs Cut Oil Production
KUWAIT — A group of Arab oil-producing
countries announced yesterday they would cut oil
production by a minimum of five percent
immediately and an additional five percent each
succeeding month until Israel withdraws from
occupied Arab territory and restores Palestinian
refugees' rights.
The Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting
Countries took the action at a meeting held in
Kuwait to determine how to use oil resources as a
weapon against Israel and its supporters in the
Middle East war.
Oil production cutbacks also were an underlying
concern as President Nixon met in Washington with
the foreign ministers of Algeria, Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait and Morocco for 50 minutes.
Nixon said afterward that while there were
differences between the Arabs and the United States
he believes "a fair and just and peaceful settlement"
can be reached in the war.
The U.S. House of Representatives, meanwhile,
passed an across-the-board mandatory fuel
allocation bill that would go beyond the Nixon
administration's limited program.
The bill, opposed by the administration, would
not solve the energy crisis but would spread the
expected shortage of petroleum fuels evenly, its
supporters said.
The Washington action came amid reports of
increased fighting in the Middle East, accelerating
U.S. efforts to resupply Israel and growing concern
about the effects of an Arab production cutback.
Although the United States imports only about 6
percent of its crude oil from the Arab countries,
administration planners are counting on imports of
refined heating oil from Europe to avert a shortage
this winter.
Most of the Persian Gulf crude goes to Western

Europe and Japan. If there was a shortage there
would be little chance of getting the refined
products that the planners anticipate importing.

U.S. officials are known to feel that the
discussions have not reached the point of specific
language for a solution. But they believe there has
been a change in the diplomatic situation. 1
The talks apparently have taken place between
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and Anatoly
Dobrynin, the Soviet ambassador to the United
States.
Sources at the United Nations indicate,
meanwhile, that there have been little, if any,
meaningful discussions in New York on the matter.
Among the possibilities coming from the
U.S.-Soviet discussions are a cease-fire in place or a
return to the boundaries existing before the Arab
attack nearly two weeks ago.
The talks with the Soviet Union are understood
to go beyond a cease-fire itself to cover an over-all
settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
In a related matter, State Department spokesman
Robert J. McCloskey said yesterday an American
route has been established for the air delivery of
arms and other military equipment to Israel.
McCloskey declined to outline the delivery route,
but the United States has an agreement with
Portugal allowing American military aircraft to land
and refuel in the Azores in the Middle Atlantic.
Arabs Cut Oil Production
KUWAIT — A group of Arab oil-producing
countries announced yesterday they would cut oil
production by a minimum of five percent
immediately and an additional five percent each
succeeding month until Israel withdraws from
occupied Arab territory and restores Palestinian
refugees' rights.
The Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting
Countries took the action at a meeting held in
Kuwait to determine how to use oil resources as a
weapon against Israel and its supporters in the
Middle East war.
Oil production cutbacks also were an underlying
concern as President Nixon met in Washington with
the foreign ministers of Algeria, Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait and Morocco for 50 minutes.
Nixon said afterward that while there were
differences between the Arabs and the United States
he believes "a fair and just and peaceful settlement"
can be reached in the war.
The U.S. House of Representatives, meanwhile,
passed an across-the-board mandatory fuel
allocation bill that would go beyond the Nixon
administration's limited program.
The bill, opposed by the administration, would
not solve the energy crisis but would spread the
expected shortage of petroleum fuels evenly, its
supporters said.
The Washington action came amid reports of
increased fighting in the Middle East, accelerating
U.S. efforts to resupply Israel and growing concern
about the effects of an Arab production cutback.
Although the United States imports only about 6
percent of its crude oil from the Arab countries,
administration planners are counting on imports of
refined heating oil from Europe to avert a shortage
this winter.
Most of the Persian Gulf crude goes to Western

Europe and Japan. If there was a shortage there
would be little chance of getting the refined
products that the planners anticipate importing.
Suit Against Nixon Dismissed
WASHINGTON — A federal judge ruled
yesterday that the Senate Watergate committee has
no authority to sue President Nixon in an effort to
obtain White House tapes of presidential
conversations.
U.S. District Court Judge John J. Sirica's
dismissal of the committee's civil suit marked the
first legal victory for the President in his battle to
withhold the tapes from the committee and special
Watergate prosecutor.
Two court decisions have affirmed the special
prosecutor's argument that the President must give
the tapes to a federal grand jury investigating the
scandal.
But Sirica said the committee had failed to get
congressional authority to sue the President.
A committee spokesman said the decision would
probably be appealed.
Meanwhile, three corporations which admitted
making illegal contributions to President Nixon's
re-election campaign pleaded guilty to misdemeanor
violations of federal law.
In a brief order, Sirica said the court lacked
jurisdiction in the tapes suit, an argument made by
the White House in its opposition to the
committee's civil action.
"No jurisdictional statute known to the court,
including the four which plaintiffs name, warrants
an assumption of jurisdiction, and the court is
therefore left with no alternative here but to dismiss
the action," Sirica said.
Sirica's decision followed by less than a week the
U.S. Court of Appeals ruling upholding his earlier
order in the case involving nine tapes subpoenaed by
special Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox.
In that case Sirica ordered the President to give
him the tapes to hear in private so that he could
determine if Nixon's claim that they must be kept
secret was valid.
The President is expected to carry his appeal in
that case to the Supreme Court. He has until
tomorrow to ask the Supreme Court to review the
case.
The three companies charged yesterday with
misdemeanors over campaign contributions are
American Airlines, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co.,
and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Co.
Charges were also filed against the board chairmen
of Goodyear and Minnesota Mining.
Goodyear and its board chairman, Russell
deYoung, pleaded guilty in federal court in
Cleveland. The company was fined $5000 and
deYoung $1000, the maximum fines for each.
After entering guilty pleas in federal court in St.
Paul, Minn., Minnesota Mining was fined $3000 and
its board chairman and chief executive officer,
Harry Heltzer, $500.
American Airlines entered a guilty plea and was
fined $5000.
The companies and their executives were charged
with violating federal law which prohibits campaign
contributions from corporate funds.
Jackson New Atlanta Mayor
ATLANTA, Ga. — Gov. Jimmy Carter said
yesterday that the election of a black as mayor of
Atlanta and a white as city council president

showed "that there has been no polarization" in
Atlanta.
Maynard Jackson, 35, won the mayoral post
from incumbent Sam Massed with 20 percent of the
votes in white precincts as well as overwhelming
support from black areas in a runoff election
Tuesday.
He gained 59.2 percent of the total vote in the
election. At the same time, Wyche Fowler, a
moderate white, defeated Hosea Williams, a black
civil rights activist, by a three-to-one margin for the
city council presidency.
The racial issue was a key one in the mayoral
runoff and Carter said, "I am very grateful that the
outcome does not indicate any racial division in the
city. The simultaneous election of Maynard Jackson
and Wyche Fowler ... is a fine indication that there
has been no polarization in the capital city."
Jackson, who will take office next Jan. 7 as the
first black chief executive of a major city in the
South, said after his victory: "Sam's tactics
backfired on him ... I never lost faith in this city."
World Series Deadlocked
NEW YORK — Rusty Staub drove in five runs,
three of them with a first-inning home run as the
New York Mets took a 6-1 lead over the Oakland
A's last night after four innings of their fourth
World Series game.
The Mets knocked out Oakland starter Ken
Holtzman in the first. Leadoff Batter Wayne Garrett
singled and Felix Millan beat out a bunt down the
third-base line for a single before Staub lined his
home run over the left-center field wall.
John "Blue Moon" Odom took over for Oakland
and Don Hahn grounded into an inning-ending
double play on Odom's first pitch.
Mets pitcher John Matlack held the A's hitless
until the fourth inning. Sal Bando was safe on
Garrett's fielding error, Reggie Jackson singled to
right-center to send Bando to third and he scored as
Gene Tenace grounded out.
In the bottom of the fourth, Hahn and Bud
Harrelson singled and Darold Knowles replaced
Odom on the mound for Oakland. He struck out
Matlack but hit Garrett with a pitch to load the
bases.
Then Millan grounded to second — and Dick
Green bobbled the ball. Hahn scored and the bases
remained loaded. Staub followed with a two-run
ground single to right, scoring Harrelson and
Garrett.
Knowles then walked Cleon Jones to load the
bases again. But Milner grounded into a
pitcher-to-home-to-first double play to end the
uprising.
The victory deadlocked the best-of-seven series at
two games apiece with Game Five scheduled for
tonight in New York. The teams return to Oakland
for the sixth game Saturday afternoon.
