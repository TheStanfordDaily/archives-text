# Mononucleosis Strikes Students
## 'Kissing Disease' Hits 
### PHILIP FEDER 
A kiss: the anatomical
juxtaposition of two orbicularous oris
muscles in a state of contraction.
A kiss: a major cause of infectious
mononucleosis, which doctors predict
could infect up to 40 percent of the
Stanford student body this year.
Mononucleosis germs causing the
"kissing disease" are everywhere —
gripping to water spigots, clinging to
glasses, languishing in the mouth and
sticking inside the nose.
Last year, nearly 300 students
contracted the virus; close to a dozen
were forced to miss an entire quarter.
According to Cowell Student Health
Center officials, "mono" continues to
be a problem this year.

When a student shows the usual
symptoms — a sore throat and swollen
glands — and his blood test indicates
the virus has taken over, doctors
prescribe bed rest, and in some cases,
hospitalization.
Delirious
Sophomore Rick Wheat, delirious
with fever, was hit with a particularly
severe case last year. He spent 11 days
in the infirmary while his temperature
fluctuated between 100 and 102
degrees.
"I had mono during late
November," he said. "I remember
listening to the Big Game on radio. My
ticket was in my pants, hanging in the
closet."
Wheat's case was so severe, he was
fed intraveneously. When he resumed
normal eating, "even the Cowell food
was good," he said. "When the nurses
brought in the ice cream and popsicles,
I really felt great again."
Gordon Firestein, a junior, was
finishing Albert Camus' novel, The
Plague as he was coming down with
mono. "In one scene of the book," he
explained, "a person dies when his
lymph nodes expand. I could feel mine
expanding, so I thought I had the
bubonic plague."
'Very Tired'
During Firestein's bout with mono,
he was confined to bed for three
weeks. "I was just very, very tired," he
said. "It seemed like I was asleep the
whole time."
Neither Wheat nor Firestein knew
where they caught the mono germ.
However, other students felt fairly
certain of the cause of their disease.
One girl blamed "wild living" for
the cause of her illness. "I wasn't
taking care of myself," said
sophomore Nancy Postero. "My throat
was so red and sore, all I could eat was
Cowell's cream of cardboard soup."
She added, "I was treated really
well at Cowell. One night a nurse
talked with me for an hour and spared
me from total boredom."

Cowell's assistant director, Dr.
David Torin, said, "mononucleosis is
transmitted through the nose and
mouth. Close contact of any kind
seems to spread the disease.
Unfortunately, the germ cannot be
grown in the laboratory, so our
knowledge of it is limited."

"kissing disease" are everywhere —
gripping to water spigots, clinging to
glasses, languishing in the mouth and
sticking inside the nose.
Last year, nearly 300 students
contracted the virus; close to a dozen
were forced to miss an entire quarter.
According to Cowell Student Health
Center officials, "mono" continues to
be a problem this year.

When a student shows the usual
symptoms — a sore throat and swollen
glands — and his blood test indicates
the virus has taken over, doctors
prescribe bed rest, and in some cases,
hospitalization.
Delirious
Sophomore Rick Wheat, delirious
with fever, was hit with a particularly
severe case last year. He spent 11 days
in the infirmary while his temperature
fluctuated between 100 and 102
degrees.
"I had mono during late
November," he said. "I remember
listening to the Big Game on radio. My
ticket was in my pants, hanging in the
closet."
Wheat's case was so severe, he was
fed intraveneously. When he resumed
normal eating, "even the Cowell food
was good," he said. "When the nurses
brought in the ice cream and popsicles,
I really felt great again."
Gordon Firestein, a junior, was
finishing Albert Camus' novel, The
Plague as he was coming down with
mono. "In one scene of the book," he
explained, "a person dies when his
lymph nodes expand. I could feel mine
expanding, so I thought I had the
bubonic plague."
'Very Tired'
During Firestein's bout with mono,
he was confined to bed for three
weeks. "I was just very, very tired," he
said. "It seemed like I was asleep the
whole time."
Neither Wheat nor Firestein knew
where they caught the mono germ.
However, other students felt fairly
certain of the cause of their disease.
One girl blamed "wild living" for
the cause of her illness. "I wasn't
taking care of myself," said
sophomore Nancy Postero. "My throat
was so red and sore, all I could eat was
Cowell's cream of cardboard soup."
She added, "I was treated really
well at Cowell. One night a nurse
talked with me for an hour and spared
me from total boredom."
Knowledge Limited
Cowell's assistant director, Dr.
David Torin, said, "mononucleosis is
transmitted through the nose and
mouth. Close contact of any kind
seems to spread the disease.
Unfortunately, the germ cannot be
grown in the laboratory, so our
knowledge of it is limited."
A kiss: the anatomical
juxtaposition of two orbicularous oris
muscles in a state of contraction.
A kiss: a major cause of infectious
mononucleosis, which doctors predict
could infect up to 40 percent of the
Stanford student body this year.
