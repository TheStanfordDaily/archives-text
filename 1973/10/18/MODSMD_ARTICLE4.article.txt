# UC Endowment Policies Questioned
## Regents Deny Investment Inquiry 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â€” A key regents committee
Wednesday slammed the door on a move to scrutinize
more closely the social implications of the University of
California's investments in private business.
The proposal by UC President Charles Hitch would
have set up machinery in the regents' Investment
Committee to review companies' attitudes toward such
issues as minority hiring, pollution, or investments in
countries with dictatorial regimes.
Some students have objected to the university's
investments in companies that maintain operations in
South Africa because they object to the racial policies of
the South African government.
(Since April 1971, Stanford has had a Commission on
Investment Responsibility, which attempts to assess the
consensus of community opinion on specific University
investments and then recommends action to Vice
President for Business and Finance Robert R.
Augsburger.)
Under Hitch's proposal for the University of California,
committee members could recommend the university
withdraw its money from companies practicing policies
regents didn't like.
Policy Changes
"Somewhere, sometime, we have to put our foot down
and say, 'Look, this is wrong.' I think the university can
make a contribution and change the policies or
corporations for the better," said Lee Altshuler, president
of the UC Berkeley student body and chairman of the UC
Student Body Presidents' Council.
The university has nearly $550 million invested in
common stock, most of it in an endowment fund and
retirement fund, both managed by regents, UC
spokeswoman Sara Molla said.
Regents' President Dean Watkins said the social

responsibility or attitudes of private firms weren't the
university's business.
Social Questions
"What right do we have as trustees over these funds to
take into account anything other than financial
considerations?" Watkins asked. "We don't have the right
to allow social questions to enter into the consideration of
investments," he added.
Regent William M. Roth asked what the university's
reaction would be if it discovered it had an investment in
a firm that was making excellent profits from a string of
brothels.
After Hitch's proposed review plan lost on a voice vote
by the regents' Special Committee on Reorganization,
Roth said he would bring investment questions on some
companies before the full board.
Regents Meeting
He said that could lead to some Saturday regents
meetings.
Regents normally meet on Thursday and Friday of
each month.
On another subject, Roth said in an interview, he
would suggest Thursday that regents oppose Gov. Ronald
Reagan's controversial tax reform program, Proposition 1
on the special Nov. 6 ballot.
Roth, a candidate for the Democratic nomination for
governor, said he would attempt to get his
anti-Proposition 1 proposal through the regent's finance
committee, then to the full board.
Asked if he thought he would be successful, Roth
replied, "hell, no."
Reagan's plan would clamp a gradually descending
ceiling on the percentage of personal income tax the state
could take. It would also allow a permanent seven and
one-half percent cut in state personal income taxes.
