# Ombudsman Combats Red Tape
## 
### BILL ROSS 
Aggrieved members of the Stanford
community have used the
ombudsman's office extensively during
the â€¢ past year, according to
Ombudsman Harvey Hall.
"Any student, faculty or staff
member who believes he is being
unfairly treated or stalled by the
University is encouraged to use the
office," Hall said. "Last year, 392
people brought their grievances to us
and the large majority of complainants
were students."
The office of ombudsman was
established here in 1969 partly as a
result of student unrest and activism,
Hall said. A large number of other
universities set up similar offices
during the same era, he said.
"Although the ombudsman can't
deal with the roots of problems, he
can help on an individual level," Hall
explained. "It is important for people
to know they have a place where they
can go to get redresses for wrong;
which occur in a complex bureaucratic
organization."
Student complaints during the past
year have often focused on housing
problems or financial aid. Hall said.
"Most disputes between students
and faculty members result from
misunderstanding rather than from
bad faith," Hall explained. "For
example, many students have been
denied refunds for late registration

from the registrar's office. In those
cases, I went to the registrar and had
no problem getting the refund if the
student had a right to it."
Hall said he has had less success
dealing with students who have had
complaints concerning grades, except
in those cases where a factual error has
been made in grading.
Faculty Visits
Twenty-two faculty members
visited the ombudsman's office last
year, Hall said. Some of these were
resident assistants who had not been
given the customary $50 to entertain
freshmen and in such cases the
grievances easily were solved, he
noted.
Hall explained he had less success
with faculty members who complained
about lack of promotion.
"About all we were able to do was
to refer them to the promotion review
committee," Hall said. "Also, I went
to the dean of the appropriate college.
I always prefer to deal with people
face to face rather than through
letters."
Hall, a former registrar' remarked
that while he likes his job, he
sometimes is frustrated because not
everything works out.
Satisfaction
"But sometimes I'm satisfied just to
know that we tried," he said. "I took
this position because I had been at
Stanford for 22 years and believed
that I knew as well as anyone the

appropriate buttons to push and tne
right telephones to ring to get things
done within the University hierarchy."
Not everyone who seeks assistance
at the ombudsman's office has a
complaint, Hall said. Some merely
come in for direction in handling their
own problems.
"In cases where people need
direction, I do more than just give
them a map and tell them where to
go," Hall remarked. "I try to assist
them as much as possible and open
doors in advance for them."
The office is completely
independent and all consultations are
confidential, Hall explained.
"When I became ombudsman last
year. President Lyman made it clear
that the office is unrestricted," Hall
said. "The only limits on its activities
are self-imposed."
Hall explained that he refuses to
help people who seek assistance
through anonymous letters or
telephone calls.
"Nor do I attempt to involve the
office in legal matters," he stated. "I
don't believe I should dabble in an
area in which I am not an expert.
There is a new legal counseling service
on campus however, and I hope that
the ombudsman's office will be able to
work with them.
"Anyone who has a reasonable
problem should stop in," Hall said.
"The ombudsman's office is a useful
tool and it is here to stay."
