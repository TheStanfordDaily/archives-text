# Shameful Justice
## 
### 
The treatment of former Vice President Agnew by the
Nixon Administration and its Justice Department is but one
more example of the peculiarities of American justice.
Forty pages of Justice Department particulars charged
the Vice President with direction of bribery and extortion
schemes. Yet the Justice Department has decided not to
prosecute further in exchange for the resignation, and as a
result the details of Agnew's alleged corruption may never
come to light.
The shame of the plea-bargain by which Agnew was
convicted of only a single charge of tax evasion is not only
that the man who campaigned against "welfare chiselers"
was a chiseler himself. It is not only that the man who called
for harsher criminal penalties was let off easy while lesser
thieves languish in overcrowded prisons.
There is more than that.
There is the ongoing shame that the Nixon
Administration decided once again, as it has so many times
before, to cover up. Because of the plea bargain which was
offered initially by the Attorney General, not sought out by
Agnew â€” we may never know how deep into the
Administration this current scandal plumbed.
The blame goes not to Agnew. He did what any
defendant would have done; he acted simply to save his own
skin.
There is another shame, though, and that is Agnew's: the
use, once again, of "the national interest" as an excuse for
everything from wiretapping to burglary to avoidance of
prosecution.
Agnew's resignation was an explicit part of the deal by
which he was freed from prosecution. But in his
sanctimonious speech Monday night, the former Vice
President dragged in "the national interest" as the 'real'
reason.
Moreover, Agnew steadfastly maintained his innocence of
the Justice Department's charges ~ but refused to submit his
innocence to the criminal courts. The American judicial
system, he said, was incapable of granting a fair trial to a
man in his position. The irony of the contention, last heard
in connection with the trials of Bobby Seale and Angela
Davis, was matched only by its absurdity.
The Administration and Agnew both claim they have
served the national interest They have not. The Republic has
already withstood the shock of learning the Vice President
was a crook; it can easily afford to find out what kind of
crook, and just how much he stole.
