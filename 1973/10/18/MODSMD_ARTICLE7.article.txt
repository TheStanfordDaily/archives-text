# On The Lighter Side
## Bosco Encounters 'Deep Grapefruit' 
###

Two weeks ago in this column
(hah! Thought you'd gotten rid of
me, didn't you? It's every other
week now.), Bosco Embo paid a
fateful visit to the Sunday flicks.
Our hero's pride was deflated, but
other than that, he was no worse
for wear. Not so for Bosco this
week; come join our
post-pubescent flickophile in his
latest adventure — his first visit to
a porno movie.
It all began last Sunday evening
when Bosco left the Felta Thigh
house for Mem Aud. Steve "the
Hulk," "8.A.," Banducci, and
"Little Jeff" rushed after him and
offered him a ride to the flicks in
Hulk's '63 chevy.
Bosco never suspected any foul
play; not even when the car sped
onto northbound U.S. 101. When
the chloroform had finally worn
off, he found himself looking at
the Transamerica Pyramid .. .
from the building's ground floor.
"Where the hell is Market
Street?" shouted Hulk, breaking
the trance the city lights were
having on Bosco.
"I never been in a city this
big," whispered Little Jeff to
Godlike John who had gone along
for the ride.
"Get your rears in gear!"
ordered B.A. "The Pussycat
Theater's this way."
The Tenderloin
The chevy ground into reverse,
hit a parked car, then bounced off

toward the alluring marquee lights
of the Tenderloin. Bosco shivered
when they reached their
destination: a dark and
not-too-clean building on an even
darker side-street.
A neon sign in a window
advertised "Adult Books, Art
Films, French Novelties," and
provided enough light to read a
poster tacked up on the building's
side, "Now playing: 'Vegetable
Lust,' and sexciting co-hit, 'Deep
Grapefruit.'
"See the most carnal acts of sin
and desire between a woman and
her organic truck farm ever
depicted on film!," the poster
continued. "Banned by the
U.S.D.A. in nearly all rural areas,
'Vegetable Lust' is a landmark in
the battle to expand our First
Amendment rights!
"The tender and poignant
co-hit, 'Deep Grapefruit,' reveals
the poignant struggles of a tender
young woman, as she struggles to
find a grapefruit in the market
stalls that is tender enough for her
satisfaction!"
Breakfast Food
Bosco felt a twinge of irony at
reading the poster, for his favorite
breakfast treat had always been
grapefruit. Now he feared that the
screen debut of that noble citrus,
coupled with the immoral
obscenities the film purported to
show, would have an effect on his
tastes similar to that of Beethoven
and Malcolm McDowell in "A

Clockwork Orange."
"Boy, this is gonna be some
hot flick!" B.A. slobbered. "Get a
load of the montogenous
cabobatures on that tomato!"
"Man, you'd suffocate!" piped
in Little Jeff, contemplating an
act of BBrßrbrowski.
Bosco, despite his inhibitions,
his years of Sunday School, and
the stern warnings of his piano
teacher, began to get caught up in
the prevailing emotion of the
evening. Bursting past the last
filmsy barriers his superego had
set up, Bosco let his mind wander
on the poster characters: what
would they look like undressed?
and the grapefruit without its
peel?
"Let's go in or we'll miss some
of it," prompted Godlike John.
"You may know all about field
goals, Johnny boy," replied Hulk;
"but you sure are dumb when it
comes to porno movies. You can't
just go in; you have to case the
joint. Check the street to make
sure no old ladies are around
who'd see you and call your
mother."
"Old ladies in this
neighborhood?" queried Little
Jeff.
"One can never be too sure,"
Hulk answered. "And anyway, we
have to take extra precautions
'cause this is Bosco's first time.
B.A. — you take the near corner,
and Jeff the far one. When you
see nobody coming up the street,
run back and we'll go inside the
theater."
Hiding Out
Bosco and Hulk waited in the
shadows of the building, carefully
examining their fingernails and
the cracks in the sidewalk, as they
waited for the scouts' return.
Godlike John scanned the
windows across the street for any
sign of activity.
After what seemed like a finals
week, B.A. and Little Jeff scurried
back with the 'All Clear' sign. The
gang of Felta Thighs rushed for
the door, with B.A. reaching it
first.
"It's stuck— won't open!" he
whispered loudly. "What do we
do?"
"Why not pay your admission
first, boys, then come in," came a
strange voice that materialized
from a glass booth next to the
door. "Tickets are usually $6, but
since you came in such a big
group I'll give you a special rate of
$5."
"Gee, thanks," Hulk said;
"here — let me in quick!"
The Spies Arrive!
But he spoke too late, for just
as the boys lined up to pay, a
Number 18 Market Street bus
stopped at the comer right next
to the theater. And the bus was

filled with leering old ladies who
began to jot down the boys'
descriptions in a hundred
notebooks!
"If my mom hears about
this. . .B.A. began as the last of
the group finally paid their $5.
"Mom, hell!" added Hulk: "If
the Dean of Students gets wind
... or our R.A.!"
"You think the CJP could get a
rap on us?" ventured Little Jeff.
"You're all pussies!" Bosco
said — his first words of the
evening. "We came up to be
entertained, so let's get some
action instead of standing here
worrying."
Back At The Farm
Two hours 'ater, five
white-faced youths slouched out
of a Market Street theater and, in
another hour were back at the
frat, having regained most of their
normal color.
"Where have you guys been?"
— it was 'Toenails Nelson,' the
R.A., or Senior House Associate
as he liked to be called.
"Flicks and then pizza run,"
mumbled Hulk over his shoulder
as they raced up the staira and to
the safety of their rooms.
All were asleep, with the
night's adventures safely behind
them, in a short time. All, except
Bosco who waited for the house
to be absolutely quiet and dark
before he crept into his closet and
pulled out the grapefruit rind
hidden in his laundry bag.
"You exquisite mistress," he
cooed; "send me to Nirvana!"
Miles away, Mrs. Embo tossed in
her sleep.
