# Harvard Forum Axes Shockley IQ Debate

The Harvard Law School Forum
Wednesday night canceled a planned
Oct. 26 debate between controversial
Stanford Electrical Engineering Prof.
William Shockley and Roy Innis,
national director of the Congress of
Racial Equality (CORE).
An attempt by U.S. Rep. Paul N.
McCloskey Jr., R-Menlo Park, to
reschedule the debate in Washington at
Shockley's request failed last night
when a CORE spokesman said Innis
would be unable to attend.
Instead, Shockley and three other
educators will present their views in an
unused House of Representatives
meeting room early next week.
Shockley, the Nobel laureate who
has theorized that blacks are
genetically less intelligent than whites,
was notified of the Harvard
cancellation while debating Stanford
geneticist L.L. Cavalli-Sforza in San
Jose.
Disruption Feared
Howard Brod Brownstein, president
of the Forum, told the Harvard
Crimson, that the Cambridge, Mass.
debate was canceled because of fear of
possible disruption and "expressions
of displeasure within segments of the
Harvard community."
The Law Forum's executive board
issued a statement saying it "regrets
that conditions are such at Harvard
that a free and open debate cannot be
called on any subject, no matter how
irrational and pernicious that subject
appears."
Shockley had originally asked
McCloskey to arrange the Washington
forum for a joint presentation
including himself, UC-Berkeley Prof.
Arthur Jensen and University of
Georgia Profs. Travis Osborne and
David Suddick. All are having papers
presented at the National Academy of
Sciences meeting there Monday
relating to race and intelligence.
Move Sought
After the Harvard debate was
canceled, Shockley sought to move the
debate to Washington, but a CORE
aide told him last night that Innis'
schedule would not permit him to
attend.
Shockley said he would continue
trying to rearrange the debate with
Innis, and would challenge Harvard
Biology Prof. George Wald, a Nobel
laureate who has been critical of
Shockley, to arrange another forum at
Harvard.
In the meantime, he will tell
McCloskey today to arrange the
Capitol presentation.
'Entitled To Be Heard'
"I disagree with his [Shockley's]
views, but I value any man's right to
express his views," McCloskey told the
Daily yesterday. "He's entitled to be
heard."
McCloskey said he would invite
members of the House Black Caucus,

other minority congressmen, and
"whoever else in the House who wants
to come." He stressed that the use of a
House committee room for such a
presentation is "not unusual."
'Defeat'
Both Shockley and Innis blasted
the Harvard debate cancellation. Innis
told the Crimson that the cancellation
was "a defeat for academic freedom, a
defeat for protection of the First
Amendment, a defeat for free speech,
and I suppose a coup de grace for
hypocrisy in the academic community
of Harvard."
Innis singled out Harvard Law Prof.
Derrick Bell and Sociology Prof.
Orlando Patterson -- both blacks â€”
and the Harvard Black Law Students
Association for special criticism. He
accused Patterson of furthering
"elitist, vicious and undemocratic"
views.
Free Speech
"I disagree with Shockley 100
percent, but I believe he has a right to
free speech," said Innis, who is also
black. "The way to combat him is
through ideas, not censorship."
Shockley called the cancellation
"typical of the disrespect for the
power of the intellectual process and
for the value of freedom of speech in
finding truth through the open combat
of ideas."
He also said he might inform the
American Civil Liberties Union of the
debate cancellation for the purpose of
"documenting the kind of taboos that
exist" against discussion of his
controversial theories.
