Comments on Chile
Editor:
How reassuring to know that,
even though Latin American
dictatorships and U.S.
Vice-Presidents may "bite the
dust," we at Stanford can still rely
on Chris Hocker to remain
steadfastly rooted amid the
swirling waters of change, an
unswerving beacon of
rationalization. We are indeed
fortunate to be treated to the
penetrating wit of this
self-appointed suppository [sic]
of scatological Russian wisdom.
However, the Stanford
community is rendered a
fundamental disservice by certain
inaccuracies in Mr. Hocker's
[Daily, Oct. 10] article, and these
should be rectified.
The protest by Mr. Hocker
against possible U.S.
"interference" in Chilean affairs,
so eagerly echoed by Mr. Ottilie
[Daily, Oct. 12] and Ms. Norris
[Daily, Oct. 15], is outrageous on
two counts. First of all, it is too
late to begin worrying now about
U.S. "interference" in Chile, when
such interference played a key
role in generating the pre-coup
economic chaos so roundly
deplored by these three
champions of Chilean liberty.
But what is really inexcusable
about these sanctimonious
broadsides is their distortion of
the aims of those appealing to
U.S. citizens to bestir themselves
on behalf of Chile. If these three
people had bothered to read the
suggestions offered for the
time-honored letters to
Congressmen, they would find

three: to help safeguard the rights
of current detainees, to support a
fact-finding investigation of U.S.
involvement during the Allende
regime, and to back the Kennedy
amendment to the Foreign Aid
Bill, prohibiting the resumption of
aid to Chile during the suspension
of democratic processes there.
How anyone can brand as
"interference" the withholding of
aid from the force-fed junta, when
this is exactly how our
government treated its
constitutionally-elected
predecessor, strains one's semantic
sense almost as severely as it pains
one's moral sensitivity.

USE Elections
Editor:
United Stanford Employees is
electing officers and
representatives now for the
coming year. I believe that all of
us should carefully consider the
qualifications and be sure we get a
representative group. I am also
deeply concerned that the union
retain a democratic form and
content. In the past, I have
witnessed many unions change
with growth. We must guard
against the centralization and
concentration of power in the
hands of a few. TTiis eventually
leads to the development of a
union bureaucracy which retains
itself in power by eliminating
dissent and opposition. Some of
these trends are already in
evidence now.
Union strength comes from the
working together of many diverse

groups and classificaitons of
workers. A strong union is
achieved through understanding,
tolerance, and equal participation
of all union members. Only the
voting membership can protect
itself for the future. Better pay,
security, equality of opportunity,
health care, etc., can best be won
by assuring equal and active
participation of all workers within
a democratic, non-bureaucratic
union framework.
Bureaucracies may be more
efficient. But I would be willing
to risk short-term efficiency for
real union democracy.

Campus Pub
Editor:
The story on the campus pub
[Daily, Oct. 17] notes that the
matter will, if approved by
President Lyman, have to be
taken to the Board of Trustees. It
goes on to say that I "expressed
the feeling that the pub would
probably be approved [by the
Board of Trustees] explaining
that 'we don't need the Board of
Trustees approval of minor
operational changes.'" Aside
from the non-sequitur, I did not
say that which was attributed to
me in quotation. I have no idea at
the moment of the form in which
the proposal will be presented to
the Board. But it will not be,
because it is not, as a minor
operational change.
