Why can't the student gate to
the football stadium be opened
earlier to minimize the bad
feelings resulting from prolonged
waiting in line and cutting?
I realize the Athletic
Department would have to pay a
guard for the extra hours
required, but I hardly think that
the cost would be prohibitive
(after all, they built the stadium
tunnels for the alumni's
convenience). —S.K.
Associate Director of Athletics
Bob Young apologized for not
anticipating the large crowd at last
Saturday's game against UCLA.
He said that the number of tickets
sold during the week before the
game should have alerted the
Athletic Department to the
possibility that a crowd might
form at the gate early. Young said
that the gates would have been
opened sooner if he had known
how many people were going to
show up early.
He went on to say that the
gates would open at the normal
time, noon, for the Oregon and
Washington State games because
he doesn't anticipate many early
arrivals at the student gate for
those games.

However, the gates will be
opened early for the Cal game.
Young said that the exact time
would be announced later on in
the season.
Young said that it would cost
between $450 and $500 to open
the student gate an hour early
because all of the security
personnel would have to be at
their stations for the extra hour.
(That's 90 people at $5 an hour,
the personnel and salary used at
the UCLA game.)

Will there be any lockers
available in either the new or old
men's gym complexes? If the
answer is no, who could I see in
the Athletic Department about
making some lockers available for
women? —J.L.
Assuming that by the "new"
you mean the swimming-squash
handball complex, and by the
"old you mean Encina, the answer
is no, according to Associate
Director of Athletics Bob Young.
He said that the main problem
was one of space. Encina has a
shortage of locker space and there
will be so many people using the
new complex that there won't be

lockers at all. Instead, a "bag
system" (similar to a hat-or
coat-check) will be available to
anyone using the facilities.
Young mentioned that the
next phase of the master plan calls
for a new gym complex that will
have lockers for men and women,
but he emphasized that the new
gym is "quite a ways down the
road."

you mean the swimming-squash
handball complex, and by the
"old you mean Encina, the answer
is no, according to Associate
Director of Athletics Bob Young.
He said that the main problem
was one of space. Encina has a
shortage of locker space and there
will be so many people using the
new complex that there won't be

lockers at all. Instead, a "bag
system" (similar to a hat-or
coat-check) will be available to
anyone using the facilities.
Young mentioned that the
next phase of the master plan calls
for a new gym complex that will
have lockers for men and women,
but he emphasized that the new
gym is "quite a ways down the
road."
Why can't the student gate to
the football stadium be opened
earlier to minimize the bad
feelings resulting from prolonged
waiting in line and cutting?
I realize the Athletic
Department would have to pay a
guard for the extra hours
required, but I hardly think that
the cost would be prohibitive
(after all, they built the stadium
tunnels for the alumni's
convenience). —S.K.
Associate Director of Athletics
Bob Young apologized for not
anticipating the large crowd at last
Saturday's game against UCLA.
He said that the number of tickets
sold during the week before the
game should have alerted the
Athletic Department to the
possibility that a crowd might
form at the gate early. Young said
that the gates would have been
opened sooner if he had known
how many people were going to
show up early.
He went on to say that the
gates would open at the normal
time, noon, for the Oregon and
Washington State games because
he doesn't anticipate many early
arrivals at the student gate for
those games.

However, the gates will be
opened early for the Cal game.
Young said that the exact time
would be announced later on in
the season.
Young said that it would cost
between $450 and $500 to open
the student gate an hour early
because all of the security
personnel would have to be at
their stations for the extra hour.
(That's 90 people at $5 an hour,
the personnel and salary used at
the UCLA game.)

Will there be any lockers
available in either the new or old
men's gym complexes? If the
answer is no, who could I see in
the Athletic Department about
making some lockers available for
women? —J.L.
