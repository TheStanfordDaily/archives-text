# Old Testament Text Examined
## Engineer Probes Biblical UFO 
### 
HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) -
An engineer who helped develop
the Skylab, space shuttle and
Saturn 5 rocket says he believes
beings from outer space landed on
earth 2,600 years ago using
equipment more advanced than
anything man can have within the
next 20 years.
During 18 months of working
in his spare time, Josef F.

Blumrich said he applied space
technology to the Old Testament
text Ezekiel, and came up with
engineering drawings of what a
craft described by the Hebrew
prophet looked like and how it
moved about.
"It all started in the fall of
1970 when I got a German version
of Erich Von Daniken's "Chariot
of the Gods," and was convinced

it was the same old nonsense," he
said.
"When I came to the passages
about Gzekiel I put Von
Daniken's book away and took
one of my Bibles. I told my wife,
'I will show you where he is
wrong.'"
Passages Made Sense
But, to my surprise, Blumrich
—chief of the Systems Layout
Branch of the Marshall Space
Flight Center — saw things that
made sense to him:
"In chapter one, Ezekiel speaks
at length about the structure. It
just so happens that I have myself
designed such things here."
From a modern English
translation of the Bible, here is
part of the passage to which he
refers:
Craft Described
"One day late in June when I
was 30 ... the heavens were
suddenly opened to me. ... I saw
in this vision, a great storm
coming toward me from the
north, driving before it a huge
cloud glowing with fire, with a
mass of fire inside that flashed
continually; and in the fire there
was something that shone like
polished brass.
"Then, from the center of the

cloud, four strange forms
appeared that looked like men
except that each had four faces
and two pairs of wings. ... And
beneath their wings I could see
human hands."
Blumrich has been with the
National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) since
1959, when he came from Austria
to join the space program.
'Spinning Top*
He said that by using
mathematical formulas, he was
able to determine the craft was
similar to a child's spinning top,
concave on the bottom with a
crew compartment above.
The ship was 55 feet in
diameter, and the length of the
rotor blades was 35-36 feet,
Blumrich figured.
"The thrust of the engine
would be about 280,000 pounds,
not much by our standards when
you consider the Saturn goes into
the millions," he said.
He believes it was used as a
shuttle vehicle between the earth
and an orbiting mother ship — the
same technique used by the U.S.
moon visitors who left their craft
in orbit and touched down in a
lunar lander.

appeared that looked like men
except that each had four faces
and two pairs of wings. ... And
beneath their wings I could see
human hands."
Blumrich has been with the
National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) since
1959, when he came from Austria
to join the space program.
'Spinning Top*
He said that by using
mathematical formulas, he was
able to determine the craft was
similar to a child's spinning top,
concave on the bottom with a
crew compartment above.
The ship was 55 feet in
diameter, and the length of the
rotor blades was 35-36 feet,
Blumrich figured.
"The thrust of the engine
would be about 280,000 pounds,
not much by our standards when
you consider the Saturn goes into
the millions," he said.
He believes it was used as a
shuttle vehicle between the earth
and an orbiting mother ship — the
same technique used by the U.S.
moon visitors who left their craft
in orbit and touched down in a
lunar lander.


SAN FORD DORNBUSCH
HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) -
An engineer who helped develop
the Skylab, space shuttle and
Saturn 5 rocket says he believes
beings from outer space landed on
earth 2,600 years ago using
equipment more advanced than
anything man can have within the
next 20 years.
During 18 months of working
in his spare time, Josef F.

Blumrich said he applied space
technology to the Old Testament
text Ezekiel, and came up with
engineering drawings of what a
craft described by the Hebrew
prophet looked like and how it
moved about.
"It all started in the fall of
1970 when I got a German version
of Erich Von Daniken's "Chariot
of the Gods," and was convinced

it was the same old nonsense," he
said.
"When I came to the passages
about Gzekiel I put Von
Daniken's book away and took
one of my Bibles. I told my wife,
'I will show you where he is
wrong.'"
Passages Made Sense
But, to my surprise, Blumrich
—chief of the Systems Layout
Branch of the Marshall Space
Flight Center — saw things that
made sense to him:
"In chapter one, Ezekiel speaks
at length about the structure. It
just so happens that I have myself
designed such things here."
From a modern English
translation of the Bible, here is
part of the passage to which he
refers:
Craft Described
"One day late in June when I
was 30 ... the heavens were
suddenly opened to me. ... I saw
in this vision, a great storm
coming toward me from the
north, driving before it a huge
cloud glowing with fire, with a
mass of fire inside that flashed
continually; and in the fire there
was something that shone like
polished brass.
"Then, from the center of the

cloud, four strange forms
appeared that looked like men
except that each had four faces
and two pairs of wings. ... And
beneath their wings I could see
human hands."
