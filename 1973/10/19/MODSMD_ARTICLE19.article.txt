# University's Fiscal Clout
## UC Regents Kill Proposal 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — A move to use the
University of California's fiscal clout to make
private corporations more socially aware has been
junked by a key regents committee.
UC President Charles Hitch's proposal would
have set up machinery in the regents' Investment
Committee to review companies' attitudes toward
such issues as minority hiring, pollution, or
investments in countries with dictatorial regimes.
For example, students and state lawmakers who
disapprove of the racial policies of the South
African government have objected to the
university's investments in companies which
maintain operations in South Africa.
Committee Recommendations
Under Hitch's proposal, committee members
could recommend the university withdraw its
money from companies practicing policies regents
didn't like.
Under current procedures, regents could
withdraw investments from companies who
followed policies they considered objectionable.
Hitch's plan would have set up formal machinery
for reviews of company policies.
The proposal was rejected Wednesday by a voice
vote on the regents Special Reorganization
Committee.

The vote came after a plea for the proposal from
Lee Altshuler, president of the UC Berkeley student
body and chairman of the UC Student Body
President's Council.
"Somewhere, sometime, we have to put our foot
down and say, 'Look, this is wrong.' I think the
university can make a contribution and change the
policies of corporations for the better," he said.
The university has nsarly $550 million invested
in common stock, most of it in an endowment fund
and retirement fund, both managed by regents, UC
spokeswoman Sara Molla said.
Dean Watkins Reacts
Regents' President Dean Watkins said the social
responsibility or attitudes of private firms weren't
the university's business.
"What right do we have as trustees over these
funds to take into account anything other than
financial considerations?" Watkins asked. "We don't
have the right to allow social questions to enter into
the consideration of investments," he added.
Regent William M. Roth asked what the
university's reaction would be if it discovered it had
an investment in a firm that was making excellent
profits from a string of brothels.
After the vote, Roth said he would bring
investment questions on some companies before the
full board, bypassing the Investments Committee.
