# Arab States Threaten Possible Oil Cutoffs
## 
### Associated Press 
Arab oil became a weapon in the
Middle East war yesterday, with
producing nations threatening major
cutoffs of supplies as winter
approaches users in Europe, Japan and
to some extent the United States.
Price increases by Persian Gulf
countries and threats from 10 Arab
nations for monthly five percent
cutbacks in production were followed
yesterday by an announcement by
Saudi Arabia that it was curtailing
production by 10 percent.
Saudi Arabia is the third largest
supplier of oil to the United States
behind Canada and Venezuela.
But the United States' over-all use
of Middle East oil amounts to about
six percent.
The tiny sheikdom of Abu Dhabi
announced it is shutting off all oil
exports to the United States. Its
supplies to U.S. ports are minimal.
Saudi Arabia ships 19,794,000
barrels a mo nth to the United States.

While working for an end to the
fighting, the United States is facing
increased pressure from the Arab
nations to pull back from its support
of Israel.
American oil specialists have said
that the United States could get by
without Arab oil imp orts if necessary
by reducing its con sumption.
But one U.S. oil expert noted that a
reduction in Arab output could
seriously affect the international
operations of such major companies as
Texaco, Exxon, Mobil, Royal Dutch
Shell and Standard Oil of California.
A Nixon Administration spokesman
expressed confidence yesterday it
could handle any cutbacks in the oil
supply.
The Arabs want Israel to withdraw
from all Arab territories it has
occupied since the 1967 Middle East
war and to assure that the rights of
more than a million Palestinian
refugees are restored.
