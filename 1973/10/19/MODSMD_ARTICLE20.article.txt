# Prop. 1 May Require Court Ruling
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) - Gov.
Ronald Reagan claimed a major
victory Thursday from an
attorney general's opinion which
Reagan says proves he was right
all along about how his tax
limitation plan will trim
government without drastic cuts.
But the 17-page legal opinion
said the only way Prop. 1 can be

made to work the way Reagan
promises is if the courts or a new
economic estimates commission
rules that the state is not bound
by a literal reading of the
measure.
Critics again accused Reagan of
distorting issues and claimed that
Atty. Gen. Evelle Younger's
opinion really supported their

claim that Prop. 1 may cause
disasterous cuts in state programs
and a shift of costs to cities and
counties.
Younger's opinion said there is
ample legal precedent for
deviating from literal
interpretations of statutes if it can
be shown that a literal
interpretation violates the intent
of the measure. On that basis a
court "could uphold" Reagan's
position, Younger wrote.
Reagan said that settled the
legal question. Since nobody
wants the more drastic cuts
opponents have warned might
occur, the fact that a nonliteral
interpretation is possible
"removes all doubt" about how
the plan will work, he said.
"Clearly, the slender reed upon
which the principal opponents
have contrived their case against
Prop. 1 has now been removed,"
Reagan said.
"Every local official — city,
school or county — who has been
concerned about the fiscal effects
of Prop. 1 can now have complete
confidence in the solid financial
foundation on which Prop. 1 is
based.
"Allegations made by some
that Prop. 1 would cause a
reduction in current state services
and programs essential for the
public good are now shown to be
incorrect," Reagan added.
Critics have said that because
of the way the measure is drafted,
it could force a cut of up to $620
million in state programs next
year.
That is based on an opinion of
legislative counsel that a carryover
surplus from the 1972-73 fiscal
year cannot be counted as
1973-74 revenues in the
calculating of a state revenue base.
The initiative makes revenues
in the 1973-74 fiscal year the
starting point for calculating
future ceilings. But since the time
it was placed on the ballot, a $721
million tax relief measure was
enacted to use up the 1972-73
surplus.

that Prop. 1 would cause a
reduction in current state services
and programs essential for the
public good are now shown to be
incorrect," Reagan added.
Critics have said that because
of the way the measure is drafted,
it could force a cut of up to $620
million in state programs next
year.
That is based on an opinion of
legislative counsel that a carryover
surplus from the 1972-73 fiscal
year cannot be counted as
1973-74 revenues in the
calculating of a state revenue base.
The initiative makes revenues
in the 1973-74 fiscal year the
starting point for calculating
future ceilings. But since the time
it was placed on the ballot, a $721
million tax relief measure was
enacted to use up the 1972-73
surplus.
SACRAMENTO (AP) - Gov.
Ronald Reagan claimed a major
victory Thursday from an
attorney general's opinion which
Reagan says proves he was right
all along about how his tax
limitation plan will trim
government without drastic cuts.
But the 17-page legal opinion
said the only way Prop. 1 can be

made to work the way Reagan
promises is if the courts or a new
economic estimates commission
rules that the state is not bound
by a literal reading of the
measure.
Critics again accused Reagan of
distorting issues and claimed that
Atty. Gen. Evelle Younger's
opinion really supported their

claim that Prop. 1 may cause
disasterous cuts in state programs
and a shift of costs to cities and
counties.
Younger's opinion said there is
ample legal precedent for
deviating from literal
interpretations of statutes if it can
be shown that a literal
interpretation violates the intent
of the measure. On that basis a
court "could uphold" Reagan's
position, Younger wrote.
Reagan said that settled the
legal question. Since nobody
wants the more drastic cuts
opponents have warned might
occur, the fact that a nonliteral
interpretation is possible
"removes all doubt" about how
the plan will work, he said.
"Clearly, the slender reed upon
which the principal opponents
have contrived their case against
Prop. 1 has now been removed,"
Reagan said.
"Every local official — city,
school or county — who has been
concerned about the fiscal effects
of Prop. 1 can now have complete
confidence in the solid financial
foundation on which Prop. 1 is
based.
"Allegations made by some
that Prop. 1 would cause a
reduction in current state services
and programs essential for the
public good are now shown to be
incorrect," Reagan added.
