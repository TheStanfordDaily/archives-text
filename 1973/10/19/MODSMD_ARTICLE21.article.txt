# Tournament Slated For Trivia Buffs
## 
### CHRIS KENRICK 
Trivia buffs of Stanford, unite
and prepare yourselves. The San
Francisco Trivia Society has
announced California's first Grand
Trivia Tournament, to begin next
month.
"What is the name of the
groundskeeper at Candlestick
Park? Who wrote the 'Warsaw
Concert?' Who was in the on deck
circle when Bobbie Thompson hit
his 'shot heard round the world'
in the 1951 National League
Penant Race?" These questions,
and many more like them will be
challenged.
"Trivia is the art of knowing
about insignificant things," says
society president Ron Meyer.
"This is a very important event
that's been lacking in San Francisco
social affairs. The present
Administration has caused a need
for people to take their minds off
what's really going on, and we
hope to fill that void."
Meyer, owner of the Cargo
West Bar and Restaurant where
the contest will be held, insists
that in the field of trivia, "some
people have it and some people
don't."
The best training ground for
aspiring trivialists is a bar, he
claims. "One of the rules of trivia
is that you must be drinking at all
times."
The contest, which will run
from November 12 through

January, will pit teams from such
arch-rivals as Avis and Hertz; and
Shell and Standard oil companies.
At a press conference this week.
Meyer also proposed a match
between the Stanford and Cal
bands the night before the Nov.
24 football game.
Trivia teams consist of four
members plus two alternates, and
are best composed of nostalgia
specialists â€” one member strong
in sports; one in movies, TV and
radio; one in arts, sciences and
music; and one in news events and
history, according to Meyer.
Each trivia contest lasts 30
minutes with a 20 second time
limit per question.
Meyer is offering a one-week
trip to Mexico City to the winning
team, but requires an entrance fee
of $10 per team member entering
the contest.
