# Officials Discuss Ideas For Forced Fuel Conservation

WASHINGTON (AP)
Administration officials say they
are discussing ideas for forced
energy conservation if necessary
to stave off the threat of all-out
fuel rationing.
But they say mandatory
conservation is just in the talking
stage and there has been no move
to start drafting any standby
regulations.
Faced with the prospect of
tight fuel supplies this winter, the
administration launched a public
appeal for voluntary energy
conservation on Oct. 9, and
imposed distribution controls at
the wholesale level on home
heating oil, diesel fuel, jet fuel and
propane gas.
Limited Actions Insufficient
It hoped to get through the
winter with those limited actions,
but it may not be able to hold
that line.
The administration's campaign
stresses such measures as turning
down the home thermostat three
or four degrees.
Charles J. Dißona, deputy
director of the White House
Energy Policy Office, said in an
interview that mandatory
conservation — rather than
requiring individual actions by the
public — would seek to cut back
energy-consuming activities that
can be isolated and controlled.
Speed Reductions
Gasoline could be saved by
reducing highway speed limits.
The Interstate Commerce
Commission could alter the
traditional regulations that force
many trucks to drive hundreds of
miles out of their way to touch
base in "gateway cities" before
going on to their real destinations.
The Civil Aeronautics Board
could consolidate airline routes
and reduce the number of flights
which duplicate the service of

other airlines.
Dißona also suggested that the
operating hours of large
commercial establishments and
electric signs could be curtailed.
Homeowners and businesses with
outdoor gas lamps could be
required to shut them off.
Television Time Cuts
Energy could be saved by
reducing television broadcasting
by one hour daily, Dißona said.
The House passed Wednesday a
bill to require mandatory
wholesale allocation of all types
of petroleum products; the Senate
has passed a similar bill.
Enactment would extend the
present wholesale allocation
program to include the products
that affect every American —
gasoline and crude oil itself.
Adding to the squeeze is the
announcement by Arab oil states
that they plan to reduce their
production every month until
they wil political concessions
from Israel.
