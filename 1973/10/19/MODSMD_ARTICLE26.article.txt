# Getting 'Comfy' Back Home
## Pointers 'Relax' At Boarding House 
### SHERIDAN CRAWFORD 
SAN FRANCISCO - The
Pointer Sisters, singing and lettin'
loose at the Boarding House this
week, have come most of the way
home. Mom and Dad are
preaching right across the bay in

Oakland and The Sisters — Ruth,
Anita, Bonnie, and June — have
dressed down instead of up.
They were dressed "Comfy,"
as Bonnie put it Tuesday evening
to the opening-night audience.
Comfy meant blue jeans and old

Hawaiian baggy prints, a huge red
organdy rose behind Ruth's ear,
bangles, and close-fitting spangled
bodices.
Their music took all shapes and
forms Tuesday night, all the way
from country to rhythm and blues
("those shaky flat blues") to the
jazzy "scat" arrangements of the
forties.
They communicate perfectly in
any style, passing the lead from
one to the other, or everyone
going at once. It's fun music," as
they say, but they'll take you
right down with them if they
want to.
If the first six rows of seated
statues had shook just a little
Tuesday night, it might have been
a little more fun. The Pointer
Sisters have got to have the
feedback; they've got to be able
to see it and hear it and feel it
because they did not come out on
that stage to sing to the walls.
Audience Help Needed
A feverish pitch does not
automatically take flight the
moment they appear, as many
people expected Tuesday night. It
was up to everyone to work at it,
but the Sisters bore most of the
labor.
Handkerchiefs clutched in
hand, they opened with an
enthusiastic renditionof "Take a
Look At Me Baby, Take A Look."
They followed with a song written
and sung by Anita in country
twang (It's a parody," she
warned) about the yearnings of a
woman wanting to move on.
A few numbers later they hit a
real hot spot with "Salt Peanuts,"
Ruth blowing a gym coach's silver

whistle, driving her sisters on with
her precise though shrill timing.
Hieir back-up band consisting of
guitar, drums (he couldn't drive
'em like Ruth could) and a good
jazz/blues piano, sang the last riff
— "Salt peanuts, salt peanuts!"
Waiters T-Shirts
Next came "It's a Hit!" and
they broke wide open into "I
Know We Can Make It, Yes We
Can, Can." All the waiters wore
T-shirts which flashed the
message, "Yes We Can, Can." The
Sisters reached everybody with
that one.
Powered by hand-clapping,
they launched into smiles and
laughter with "Ride, Pony, Ride."
the whole stage lit with gold, and
it wasn't just the flashing of
sequins in their hair. The song was
punctuated by dark stage
interludes, the girls making wild
percussive sounds, calling to each
other and across the blackness to
the audience.
Alex Harvey, preceded the
firesome foursome. He was, of
course, more low-keyed, but
sincere, though he verged on a few
saccharine rhyme schemes here
and there (onlyness/loneliness).
His best songs were his own
compositions made famous by
Bette Midler, Helen Reddy, and
others (for example, "Delta
Dawn").
Harvey set a ievivalist tone,
and the stage became his pulpit.
The audience sang along on the
last few choruses of "He's gonna
take me to that mansion in the
sky." Harvey is also known for
having written "Ring, Ring" and
"Tell it All, Brothers and Sisters."
