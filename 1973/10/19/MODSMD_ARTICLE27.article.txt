# Steve Miller Band Disappoints
## 
### KEVIN SMITH 
SAN FRANCISCO - At times,
it seemed like last Friday's
concert at Winterland should have
been entitled "The Decline and
Fall of the Steve Miller Band."
Although the band displayed
flashes of brilliance, the overall
result was disappointing.
Sharing the bill with King
Crimson, and Dalton and
Dubarry, the Steve Miller Band
opened with a version of its
popular hit "Space Cowboy"
which was by no means as good as
the recorded version.
This was followed by a new
song with the inspirational title
"Your Cash Ain't Nothin' But
Trash." Although it had a good
beat, the song's lyrics were about
as good as the title would
indicate.
When Miller and friends then

played a monstrous version of
"Gangster of Love" which
butchered the song beyond
recognition, it began to look like a
good night to go home early.
'Star Spangled Banner'
But things began to pick up a
little. They played an interesting
arrangement of the "Star
Spangled Banner," appropriately
dedicated to Spiro T.
Miller has always been an
exceptional guitarist, and Friday
night's show didn't dispute this.
At one point in the show,
Miller sent the rest of the band
away, and performed by himself
with an acoustic guitar. His own
considerable singing and playing
talents came through well in this
format.
His solo of the pretty song
"Kow Kow" deserves special
mention for the strong feeling he

put into it, providing a more
powerful redition than the one on
the "Brave New World" album.
New Title Cut
Miller also soloed through the
title cut of the band's new album,
"The Joker," which started out
softly and built to a forceful,
effective conclusion.
When the rest of the band
returned to the stage, they
launched into a really infectious,
hypnotic tune entitled
"Something to Believe In," easily
their best song of the night.
However, just as things were
looking bright, the band lost its
temporary touch of brilliance. It
played some inconsequential blues
material, apparently trying to live
up to its reputation as a good
blues band.
Miller and his group then
returned to the depths of infamy

with a ridiculous song called
"Shoo-Ba-Da-Doo-Ma-Ma-Ma."
TTie title speaks for itself.
In fairness to the band, the
crowd of 4500, composed largely
of hard core Steve Miller freaks,
cheered it back for a double
encore and genuinely seemed to
enjoy the concert.
With the exception of
"Something to Believe In," the
two encores — "Lovin' Cup" and
"Sugar Babe" — were better than
anything the group played all
night and indicated there was still
a little fire left.
King Crimson Unique
King Crimson is a very unique
British group which has been
around for several years. It has
great potential just as it has
always had great potential. The
band also has one major flaw: it
becomes boring very quickly.
King Crimson's performance
consists of really different musical
pieces — that's the only word for
them, since they cannot be
classified as "songs" or "tunes."
Landmark Album
The group's best album, "The
Court of the Crimson King,"
released in 1969, was a genuine
landmark made under the
guidance of one of the group's
founders, Greg Lake, now of
Emerson, Lake and Palmer.
Lake, however, departed after
that album, and the group's other
albums have faded into obscurity.
Only guitarist Robert Fripp
remains of the original members.
The individuals in the band are
unquestionably good musicians.
Electric violinist David Cross, who
occasionally doubled on
mellotron, displayed terrific
talent.
Strong Singing
The lead singers — formerly
Greg Lake and now John Wetton
— have always had great voices
and King Crimson's lyrics —
unlike Steve Miller's — have
always been notably outstanding.
The problem remains that the
singing and lyrics are simply not a
major part of the show. If the
group relied more on singing and
lyrics to flavor its musical
irtricacy, King Crimson would be
a much greater force in the music
world.
Dalton and Dubarry were
noteworthy only for a damned
good organ and piano player, and
for an interesting looking
character who resembled Fidel
Castro with a beret and silver
earrings.
"Fidel" did a great job of
banging two tambourines together
and of exciting the crowd to new
levels of frenzy by singing, "I take
a little dope. You take a little
dope. Everybody takes a little
dope." Well, it's not quite up to
Mark Spitz's plug for milk, but
the crowd loved it just the same.

The group's best album, "The
Court of the Crimson King,"
released in 1969, was a genuine
landmark made under the
guidance of one of the group's
founders, Greg Lake, now of
Emerson, Lake and Palmer.
Lake, however, departed after
that album, and the group's other
albums have faded into obscurity.
Only guitarist Robert Fripp
remains of the original members.
The individuals in the band are
unquestionably good musicians.
Electric violinist David Cross, who
occasionally doubled on
mellotron, displayed terrific
talent.
Strong Singing
The lead singers — formerly
Greg Lake and now John Wetton
— have always had great voices
and King Crimson's lyrics —
unlike Steve Miller's — have
always been notably outstanding.
The problem remains that the
singing and lyrics are simply not a
major part of the show. If the
group relied more on singing and
lyrics to flavor its musical
irtricacy, King Crimson would be
a much greater force in the music
world.
Dalton and Dubarry were
noteworthy only for a damned
good organ and piano player, and
for an interesting looking
character who resembled Fidel
Castro with a beret and silver
earrings.
"Fidel" did a great job of
banging two tambourines together
and of exciting the crowd to new
levels of frenzy by singing, "I take
a little dope. You take a little
dope. Everybody takes a little
dope." Well, it's not quite up to
Mark Spitz's plug for milk, but
the crowd loved it just the same.
SAN FRANCISCO - At times,
it seemed like last Friday's
concert at Winterland should have
been entitled "The Decline and
Fall of the Steve Miller Band."
Although the band displayed
flashes of brilliance, the overall
result was disappointing.
Sharing the bill with King
Crimson, and Dalton and
Dubarry, the Steve Miller Band
opened with a version of its
popular hit "Space Cowboy"
which was by no means as good as
the recorded version.
This was followed by a new
song with the inspirational title
"Your Cash Ain't Nothin' But
Trash." Although it had a good
beat, the song's lyrics were about
as good as the title would
indicate.
When Miller and friends then

played a monstrous version of
"Gangster of Love" which
butchered the song beyond
recognition, it began to look like a
good night to go home early.
'Star Spangled Banner'
But things began to pick up a
little. They played an interesting
arrangement of the "Star
Spangled Banner," appropriately
dedicated to Spiro T.
Miller has always been an
exceptional guitarist, and Friday
night's show didn't dispute this.
At one point in the show,
Miller sent the rest of the band
away, and performed by himself
with an acoustic guitar. His own
considerable singing and playing
talents came through well in this
format.
His solo of the pretty song
"Kow Kow" deserves special
mention for the strong feeling he

put into it, providing a more
powerful redition than the one on
the "Brave New World" album.
New Title Cut
Miller also soloed through the
title cut of the band's new album,
"The Joker," which started out
softly and built to a forceful,
effective conclusion.
When the rest of the band
returned to the stage, they
launched into a really infectious,
hypnotic tune entitled
"Something to Believe In," easily
their best song of the night.
However, just as things were
looking bright, the band lost its
temporary touch of brilliance. It
played some inconsequential blues
material, apparently trying to live
up to its reputation as a good
blues band.
Miller and his group then
returned to the depths of infamy

with a ridiculous song called
"Shoo-Ba-Da-Doo-Ma-Ma-Ma."
TTie title speaks for itself.
In fairness to the band, the
crowd of 4500, composed largely
of hard core Steve Miller freaks,
cheered it back for a double
encore and genuinely seemed to
enjoy the concert.
With the exception of
"Something to Believe In," the
two encores — "Lovin' Cup" and
"Sugar Babe" — were better than
anything the group played all
night and indicated there was still
a little fire left.
King Crimson Unique
King Crimson is a very unique
British group which has been
around for several years. It has
great potential just as it has
always had great potential. The
band also has one major flaw: it
becomes boring very quickly.
King Crimson's performance
consists of really different musical
pieces — that's the only word for
them, since they cannot be
classified as "songs" or "tunes."

"The Joker," which started out
softly and built to a forceful,
effective conclusion.
When the rest of the band
returned to the stage, they
launched into a really infectious,
hypnotic tune entitled
"Something to Believe In," easily
their best song of the night.
However, just as things were
looking bright, the band lost its
temporary touch of brilliance. It
played some inconsequential blues
material, apparently trying to live
up to its reputation as a good
blues band.
Miller and his group then
returned to the depths of infamy

with a ridiculous song called
"Shoo-Ba-Da-Doo-Ma-Ma-Ma."
TTie title speaks for itself.
In fairness to the band, the
crowd of 4500, composed largely
of hard core Steve Miller freaks,
cheered it back for a double
encore and genuinely seemed to
enjoy the concert.
With the exception of
"Something to Believe In," the
two encores — "Lovin' Cup" and
"Sugar Babe" — were better than
anything the group played all
night and indicated there was still
a little fire left.
King Crimson Unique
King Crimson is a very unique
British group which has been
around for several years. It has
great potential just as it has
always had great potential. The
band also has one major flaw: it
becomes boring very quickly.
King Crimson's performance
consists of really different musical
pieces — that's the only word for
them, since they cannot be
classified as "songs" or "tunes."
Landmark Album
The group's best album, "The
Court of the Crimson King,"
released in 1969, was a genuine
landmark made under the
guidance of one of the group's
founders, Greg Lake, now of
Emerson, Lake and Palmer.
Lake, however, departed after
that album, and the group's other
albums have faded into obscurity.
Only guitarist Robert Fripp
remains of the original members.
The individuals in the band are
unquestionably good musicians.
Electric violinist David Cross, who
occasionally doubled on
mellotron, displayed terrific
talent.
Strong Singing
The lead singers — formerly
Greg Lake and now John Wetton
— have always had great voices
and King Crimson's lyrics —
unlike Steve Miller's — have
always been notably outstanding.
The problem remains that the
singing and lyrics are simply not a
major part of the show. If the
group relied more on singing and
lyrics to flavor its musical
irtricacy, King Crimson would be
a much greater force in the music
world.
Dalton and Dubarry were
noteworthy only for a damned
good organ and piano player, and
for an interesting looking
character who resembled Fidel
Castro with a beret and silver
earrings.
"Fidel" did a great job of
banging two tambourines together
and of exciting the crowd to new
levels of frenzy by singing, "I take
a little dope. You take a little
dope. Everybody takes a little
dope." Well, it's not quite up to
Mark Spitz's plug for milk, but
the crowd loved it just the same.
