# Lack Of Spirit, Moderation Mars Performance Of Cleveland Quartet
## 
### MICHAEL SAFFLE 
Some concerts are good
concerts, but not great concerts.
The musicians play well, but not
really beautifully or sensitively or
even artistically. When a group as
skilled as the Cleveland Quartet
gives such a concert, as they did
last Tuesday in Dinkelspiel, one
can't help feeling cheated.
Relatively new on the musical
scene, the Cleveland Quartet's
four young members are all
distinguished prize-winners and
diploma-holders. Organized in
1969, the quartet presently holds
the position of Ensemble-in-
Residence at the State University
of New York at Buffalo, replacing
the renowned Budapest Quartet.
Each player boasts excellent
technique, more than a little
musical mastery, and a
satisfactory flair for chamber
playing. Why, then, wasn't their
concert fully first-rate? It
certainly wasn't bad, and the
capacity audience at Dinkelspiel
enjoyed it hugely.
But while the group never
flopped, they rarely played like a
great quarter either — save as
technicians. A string quartet needs
more than skill; its members must
share a sense of community and
joint artistic goals.
First Violin Dominates
Haydn's "Lark" Quartet
opened the program. Brilliant and
beautiful, this work demands
absolutely clear and graceful
execution, a real test for any
ensemble. The Cleveland Quartet
set nice tempi, and their attacks
and phrasing were fully adequate.
But first violinist Donald
Weilerstein dominated the
performance from first to last,
playing too loudly, too
romantically (he even slurped
from note to note occasionally),
and much too intensely.
Violist Martha Katz, whose
warm tone and exquisite artistry
improved things immensely, was
too rarely heard. Her husband,
Paul Katz, fought valiantly against
muffled sound and intonation
problems in extreme registers.
And second violinist Peter Salaff,
competent though he was, simply
failed to shine through much of
the time.
Subtleties Lost
While the Haydn minuet was
appropriately robust, the second
movement was too rigid, and the
loveliest subtleties in the finale
were hurried over, producing an
effect of superficial brilliance and
co-ordination without content.
Charles Ives' String Quartet
No. 2 received the evening's most
satisfactory performance. The
Cleveland Quartet ripped through
this awesomely difficult work
with ease, and with improved
pitch and stylistic co-operation. A
group that plays pieces this
difficult can't be too bad.
Why, then, did almost every
measure of Ives suffer from such
loud, tense playing? Why were the
national anthems, the spiritual
tunes, the musical jokes so stilted
and overplayed? Ives called his
second movement "Arguments."
The performers ignored contrast
and jocularity, but certainly
captured the tension and
arrogance of an argument in their
performance.
Opening Remarks
And why couldn't Donald
Weilerstein have shortened his
preliminary remarks by five or ten
minutes? A Dinkelspiel concert
isn't a Young Audiences
presentation, and a quarter-hour's
lecture, complete with musical
illustrations (which gave away
many of the best effects too
soon), is going too far.
Beethoven's Quartet in F
Minor, Op. 95 — generally known
as the "Serioso" Quartet —
brought the evening to its
less-than-idyllic conclusion. From
the opening measures the
Cleveland Quartet attacked the
music almost furiously. Even a
heavy, moody work like the
"Serioso" needs some lightness of
touch, which was missing from all
but the second movement.

For an encore the group
romped through the Scherzo from
Mendelssohn's E Minor Quartet
with skill if not sufficient charm.
Ironicaily, they ended the piece
with lovely, extremely soft
chords. Would we had had more
of the same all evening long!
Technique alone isn't enough; a
great ensemble needs variety and
relaxed grace too.

Years will tell whether the
Cleveland Quartet continues to
grow musically. Four performers
this well trained and this
mechanically versatile should
steadily improve their already
satisfactory musicianship. I, for
one, hope they do — that they
become the truly fine ensemble
some of their audience mistakenly
believes they already are.


WELCOME GUESTS — The Preservation Hall Jazz Band, which has given over fifty summer performances
at Stanford over the past seven years, will be making an unusual October appearance next Friday in Mem
Aud. Nearly all of the band's past shows have been before wildly enthusiastic sellout crowds, making
Stanford almost a second home for the band. Their music is originally New Orleans jazz, "the happiest
music in America."

Stanford almost a second home for the band. Their music is originally New Orleans jazz, "the happiest
music in America."
Some concerts are good
concerts, but not great concerts.
The musicians play well, but not
really beautifully or sensitively or
even artistically. When a group as
skilled as the Cleveland Quartet
gives such a concert, as they did
last Tuesday in Dinkelspiel, one
can't help feeling cheated.
Relatively new on the musical
scene, the Cleveland Quartet's
four young members are all
distinguished prize-winners and
diploma-holders. Organized in
1969, the quartet presently holds
the position of Ensemble-in-
Residence at the State University
of New York at Buffalo, replacing
the renowned Budapest Quartet.
Each player boasts excellent
technique, more than a little
musical mastery, and a
satisfactory flair for chamber
playing. Why, then, wasn't their
concert fully first-rate? It
certainly wasn't bad, and the
capacity audience at Dinkelspiel
enjoyed it hugely.
But while the group never
flopped, they rarely played like a
great quarter either — save as
technicians. A string quartet needs
more than skill; its members must
share a sense of community and
joint artistic goals.
First Violin Dominates
Haydn's "Lark" Quartet
opened the program. Brilliant and
beautiful, this work demands
absolutely clear and graceful
execution, a real test for any
ensemble. The Cleveland Quartet
set nice tempi, and their attacks
and phrasing were fully adequate.
But first violinist Donald
Weilerstein dominated the
performance from first to last,
playing too loudly, too
romantically (he even slurped
from note to note occasionally),
and much too intensely.
Violist Martha Katz, whose
warm tone and exquisite artistry
improved things immensely, was
too rarely heard. Her husband,
Paul Katz, fought valiantly against
muffled sound and intonation
problems in extreme registers.
And second violinist Peter Salaff,
competent though he was, simply
failed to shine through much of
the time.
Subtleties Lost
While the Haydn minuet was
appropriately robust, the second
movement was too rigid, and the
loveliest subtleties in the finale
were hurried over, producing an
effect of superficial brilliance and
co-ordination without content.
Charles Ives' String Quartet
No. 2 received the evening's most
satisfactory performance. The
Cleveland Quartet ripped through
this awesomely difficult work
with ease, and with improved
pitch and stylistic co-operation. A
group that plays pieces this
difficult can't be too bad.
Why, then, did almost every
measure of Ives suffer from such
loud, tense playing? Why were the
national anthems, the spiritual
tunes, the musical jokes so stilted
and overplayed? Ives called his
second movement "Arguments."
The performers ignored contrast
and jocularity, but certainly
captured the tension and
arrogance of an argument in their
performance.
Opening Remarks
And why couldn't Donald
Weilerstein have shortened his
preliminary remarks by five or ten
minutes? A Dinkelspiel concert
isn't a Young Audiences
presentation, and a quarter-hour's
lecture, complete with musical
illustrations (which gave away
many of the best effects too
soon), is going too far.
Beethoven's Quartet in F
Minor, Op. 95 — generally known
as the "Serioso" Quartet —
brought the evening to its
less-than-idyllic conclusion. From
the opening measures the
Cleveland Quartet attacked the
music almost furiously. Even a
heavy, moody work like the
"Serioso" needs some lightness of
touch, which was missing from all
but the second movement.

For an encore the group
romped through the Scherzo from
Mendelssohn's E Minor Quartet
with skill if not sufficient charm.
Ironicaily, they ended the piece
with lovely, extremely soft
chords. Would we had had more
of the same all evening long!
Technique alone isn't enough; a
great ensemble needs variety and
relaxed grace too.

Years will tell whether the
Cleveland Quartet continues to
grow musically. Four performers
this well trained and this
mechanically versatile should
steadily improve their already
satisfactory musicianship. I, for
one, hope they do — that they
become the truly fine ensemble
some of their audience mistakenly
believes they already are.

at Stanford over the past seven years, will be making an unusual October appearance next Friday in Mem
Aud. Nearly all of the band's past shows have been before wildly enthusiastic sellout crowds, making
Stanford almost a second home for the band. Their music is originally New Orleans jazz, "the happiest
music in America."
