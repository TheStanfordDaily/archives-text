## Feliciano Saves Mixed Show 
### VICKI LaBRIE 
BERKELEY - The Jose
Feliciano show at the Berkeley
Community Theatre last Saturday
night suffered greats f.om poor
programming and careless sound
technicians. Two ear-solitting,
heart-throbbing groups prided
the talented musician render: an
incongruous and bewildering
combination.
Hoo Doo, a 7-piece local
group, is led by a black conga
player and "medicine man" with
half his face painted white,
sporting a top hat and tails with
bare feet and a vest of beads.
They began the concert with a
cacophonous, surrealistic
introduction.
Then they settled into 50
minutes of music dominated by
tribal rhythmic conga playing and
elementary guitar patterns. Their
music relied on aimless riffs with
little variation, making them a
good dance band but not
imaginative enough to sustain
interest.
Dakila, no bigger but much
louder than Hoo Doo, punctuated
their Latin rock performance with
assorted jungle calls, cries, and
whoops. Their set was generally
too loud, distorting much of the
music and alienating many
listeners. During their last few
numbers, however, they
approached the finesse exhibited
by Malo.

The last number worked up to
a frenzy as they recklessly threw
bamboo sticks to the audience as
an invitation to join in. The crowd
ate it up but showed little
enthusiasm when the MC
unwittingly asked Dakila to return
for an encore.
Accompanied by electric bass,
organ and drums, Jose Feliciano
accomplished with his first song
what the other groups failed to do
in two hours. Singing "The
Letter," he had the audience in a
state of suspended excitement
with his powerful strumming and
stringent but compelling voice as
he hurried the beat and inserted
lyrical improvisation in an image
of his sweeping guitar runs.
Feliciano demonstrated his
astounding proficiency and
virtuosity throughout, especially
on "Take Five" and the Flamenco
classic, "Malaguena." His versions
were seasoned with runs, trills,
technical precision, and he
frequently broke into Spanish
verses, which added humor and a
personal touch.
Warm And Versatile
This small (around s')
performer is hard to categorize.
He switched from electric to
acoustic guitar and featured songs
made popular by the Rolling
Stones, Santana, and Stevie
Wonder, never sticking to any
particular style, but injecting
those songs he performed with

humor, warmth, and emotion.
Feliciano shared the stage with
Meheran, his Persian friend, and
they performed three
"home-made," inconsequential
songs before Jose regained the
spotlight and proceeded with
"Oye Como Va."
Feliciano's "California
Dreaming" received a standing
ovation from the crowd of 1500.
He then performed a sensitive
rendition of "Me and Mrs.
Jones," including a sensuous
monologue accompanied by
guitar. Feliciano satisfied the
crowd's desire to hear "Light My
Fire," and retired from the stage
while his group continued playing,
leaving the audience on its feet
applauding.
