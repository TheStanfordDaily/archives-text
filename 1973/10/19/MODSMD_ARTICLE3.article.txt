# Cites Leniency Given Agnew
## McCloskey Offers Amnesty Bills 
### 
Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr.,
R-Menlo Park, introduced two bills in
Congress Wednesday calling for
amnesty for Vietnam draft resisters.
One bill would offer amnesty for
resisters willing to undertake two years
of "humanitarian service." The other,
which McCloskey said was inspired by
the judicial leniency granted former
Vice President Spiro Agnew, calls for
unconditional amnesty.
The maverick legislator, a former
Marine Corps colonel in the Korean
War, said he had been working on the

first bill for several months.
He told the Daily yesterday that he
felt alternate service should be
required "out of respect to those who
did serve."
However, he said, he changed his
mind after witnessing the light
sentences of Agnew and of former
Rep. Cornelius Gallagher, D-N.J.
Agnew, who pleaded no contest to a
charge of income tax evasion, was
fined $10,000 and sentenced to three
years informal probation; Gallagher
admitted mail fraud and obstruction
of justice, and was fined $11,000 and
sentenced to three years probation.
Freedom
In a statement released by his
Washington office, McCloskey
declared: "If justice includes freedom
for public officials who are tax evaders
and obstructors of justice, it should
include freedom for draft evaders as

well. On the eve of Veterans Day,
1973, we might well accept the
principle that Justice for All should
mean Amnesty for All."
McCloskey emphasized that "I do
not condone the refusal to obey the
law by those who went to Canada or
deserted between March, 1965 and
January, 1973."
However, he said, their crimes were
"of no greater degree" than Agnew's
or Gallagher's.
'Justice For All'
"Justice for all is our most precious
possession as a nation," McCloskey
said. "It remains an elusive goal, yet
our constant and continuing quest for
equal justice is among the most
important efforts we can pursue at a
time when we are assiduously seeking
to restore public faith in the fairness
of our system of government and law."
