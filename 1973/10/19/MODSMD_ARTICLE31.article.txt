# Poloists Meet Cal
## Cards Face Nation's Best 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Most college teams would feel fortunate if they
had just one All-American, but the number
one-ranked California Golden Bear water polo squad
boasts five. Coach Jim Gaughran's Stanford team
faces the problem of defensing the Bears today, as
the Cards travel to Harmon Pool in Berkeley for a 3
p.m. game.
The Cards have met the Bears twice this season
and both times it has been a losing effort for
Stanford. The first loss came in the opening
tournament of the season, the Bears winning by a
lopsided score of 11-1. The Cards closed the margin
to 11-7 when the two clubs met in the Northern
California Open tournament.
In assessing his teams chances against the nation's
top team, coach Gaughran said, "Certainly they
haven't gotten any worse. We improved when we
played them the second time and we're going to give
them a better ball game today."
California Depth
The Bears have so much depth that a returning
first team All-American, Peter Schnugg, sometimes
doesn't start. Coach Pete Cutino rotates 13 players
into the lineup. Schnugg was a starter on the U.S.
National team this summer at the world
championships in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. He also
competed against the Russians in their American

tour last year.
Doug Arth and Jon Svendsen were also in
Belgrade, making Cal the only school to have three
players on the national team. Tom Belfanti and
Doug Healy participated at the World Student
Games this year in Moscow.
"We won't be able to concentrate on just one
man," said Gaughran. "We'll have to play a
hard-driving game and move the ball on them."
The Bears also have a height advantage over the
Cards. While Arth, the player who "quarterbacks"
the Bears offense, stands just 5-7, Svendsen is 6-4
and still growing.
Redshirts
All of the Bears' key players redshirted either last
year or 1971 while Cal was on NCAA probation,
thus saving their eligibility.
Going into last weekend, the Bears had outscored
their opponents 162-30. Cal's record is 15-0.
The Cards have two contests on tap for
tomorrow. The Cards will face Humboldt State
College at 11 a.m. UC-Davis will take on the Cards
in the afternoon game of the doubleheader at 3 p.m.
Both contests will be played at Encina pool.
Stanford defeated both teams in tournament
action earlier this year. The score of that Humboldt
contest was 11-4 and Davis provided a closer contest
for the Cards, as the score was 10-6.

The Bears have so much depth that a returning
first team All-American, Peter Schnugg, sometimes
doesn't start. Coach Pete Cutino rotates 13 players
into the lineup. Schnugg was a starter on the U.S.
National team this summer at the world
championships in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. He also
competed against the Russians in their American

tour last year.
Doug Arth and Jon Svendsen were also in
Belgrade, making Cal the only school to have three
players on the national team. Tom Belfanti and
Doug Healy participated at the World Student
Games this year in Moscow.
"We won't be able to concentrate on just one
man," said Gaughran. "We'll have to play a
hard-driving game and move the ball on them."
The Bears also have a height advantage over the
Cards. While Arth, the player who "quarterbacks"
the Bears offense, stands just 5-7, Svendsen is 6-4
and still growing.
Redshirts
All of the Bears' key players redshirted either last
year or 1971 while Cal was on NCAA probation,
thus saving their eligibility.
Going into last weekend, the Bears had outscored
their opponents 162-30. Cal's record is 15-0.
The Cards have two contests on tap for
tomorrow. The Cards will face Humboldt State
College at 11 a.m. UC-Davis will take on the Cards
in the afternoon game of the doubleheader at 3 p.m.
Both contests will be played at Encina pool.
Stanford defeated both teams in tournament
action earlier this year. The score of that Humboldt
contest was 11-4 and Davis provided a closer contest
for the Cards, as the score was 10-6.

WOMEN S TEAMS WIN — Stanford's women's hockey and swimming
teams were both victorious yesterday in competitions here. The
hockey team (above) defeated Hayward State 6-0 behind a three-goal
performance by Marina Ballintyne while the swimmers recorded a
point total in their victor y over San Jose State (367V4), Pacific
(282) and San Francisco State (177). The junior varsity hockey team
tied West Valley College, 1-1.
Most college teams would feel fortunate if they
had just one All-American, but the number
one-ranked California Golden Bear water polo squad
boasts five. Coach Jim Gaughran's Stanford team
faces the problem of defensing the Bears today, as
the Cards travel to Harmon Pool in Berkeley for a 3
p.m. game.
The Cards have met the Bears twice this season
and both times it has been a losing effort for
Stanford. The first loss came in the opening
tournament of the season, the Bears winning by a
lopsided score of 11-1. The Cards closed the margin
to 11-7 when the two clubs met in the Northern
California Open tournament.
In assessing his teams chances against the nation's
top team, coach Gaughran said, "Certainly they
haven't gotten any worse. We improved when we
played them the second time and we're going to give
them a better ball game today."
