# Cards Risk 3-3 Record
## Booters Face Tough Foes 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Stanford's soccer team puts its
3-3 record on the line against two
tough opponents this weekend.
Chico State takes on the Cards
today at 2 p.m. and Menlo College
provides the opposition tomorrow
in a 1:30 p.m. contest. Both
games will be at Harry Maloney
Field, near Sunken Diamond.
Stanford Coach Fred Priddle
described Chico, the fifth ranked
team on the coast, as "fast, tough
and rough." He saw them play
earlier in the season, and predicts
a good game.
Menlo College comes off a 6-0
beating of St. Mary's last
weekend. Priddle commented that
there is "a lot of rivalry" between
the two schools [Stanford and

Menlo] due to their proximity
and the fact that some of
Stanford's players formerly
played for Menlo.
The Cards' Mike Grasty also
has a brother who plays for
Menlo, which should make the
game quite a significant battle.
Stanford evened its record
Wednesday, as the Cards tipped
Canada College 1-0. Tom Miller
knocked in a penalty shot in the
first half for his second score of
the season.
It was Stanford's second 1-0
victory and third shutout of the
year. Walt Harris was goalie for
both one-point victories and half
of the 10-0 rout of College of
Notre Dame.
The Card defense made Harris'

job fairly easy as Stanford allowed
visiting Canada only 11 shots. The
Cards, on the other hand, fired 25
shots at the Canada goal, but only
one made it into the net.
"We dominated the game, but
couldn't push it through,"
commented Priddle. He added
that the Cards may have taken it
too easy against a small but quick
Canada squad.
Stanford seemed to be
concentrating on working the ball
up the field with short accurate
passes, and managed to keep the
ball in Canada's half of the field
most of the game.

into action tomorrow with a 1:30
