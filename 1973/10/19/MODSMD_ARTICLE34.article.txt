# Harriers Compete In First Home Meet
## 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
Stanford's cross country team
faces three strong area opponents
in its first home meet of the
season on the golf course at 10
a.m. tomorrow.
The Cardinals will be facing a
much-improved California squad
as well as teams from San Jose
State and the West Valley Track
Club. The grassy six-mile course
will be new to many of the
opposing runners, and this should
give the Cards an added
advantage.
"Obviously the fact that we're
on home ground is going to help,"
said coach Marshall Clark, "but
the stronger team is still the one
that's going to win. Right now
we're having a little trouble
keeping people healthy."
Stanford does seem to have
more than its share of sickness
and injury. Jeff Parietti has been
down with the flu, and several
others have been feeling some of
the symptoms.
Steve Crowley came back from
a toe injury to run a 26:29
five-mile in last week's junior
varsity meet at Sacramento, but is
still not quite up to full strength.
Chris Berka is coming back from
an injury also, and is expected to
give the Cards some help.
Co-captain Mark McConnell has
been plagued with knee problems
and will probably be running
below par Saturday, if at all.
Sandoval Near Record
Though the team is below
strength, the Cards are still a force
to be reckoned with. Tony
Sandoval has proved himself a
threat to any field of runners. His
29:15.4 last year was less than
eight seconds behind the Stanford
record for six miles. Jack Bellah,

like Sandoval only in his second
year, is expected to improve on
his 30:27 of last year.
Behind them, Kurt
Schoenrock, Art Brown and Alan
Cummings are expected to finish
high for the Cards. Doug McLean,
George Koch and Frank Boutin
are also possible point scorers for
the team.
"We'll be running everyone in a
single group, so anyone has a
chance to score," Clark explained.
The top five runners on each team
score a point for each place, so
even though the sixth man doesn't
score for his own team, he can
still force another team's man
back a place.
Trouble From Cal
"We're expecting a lot of
trouble from Cal this year," said
Clark, "so this will give us a
chance to see how we can do
against them before the division
meet. We know they're a lot
stronger than last year. Brian
Maxwell beat Tony [Sandoval]
last season and he's only their
number three man now."
Cal has a special reason for
wanting to win this meet. The
Bears were humiliated by the
Cards in last year's 4-way, taking
third with 82 points just ahead of
San Jose with 86. Stanford won
last year with 28 and West Valley
was runner-up with 32.
As last year's score would
indicate, West Valley is also a
strong team. They took second in
the Sacramento State Invitational
last week with 40 points, more
than 80 ahead of either Stanford's
or Cal's JV teams. They were also
competing without Jim Dare, the
1972 NCAA steeplechase
champion who is expected to run
this week.

year, is expected to improve on
his 30:27 of last year.
Behind them, Kurt
Schoenrock, Art Brown and Alan
Cummings are expected to finish
high for the Cards. Doug McLean,
George Koch and Frank Boutin
are also possible point scorers for
the team.
"We'll be running everyone in a
single group, so anyone has a
chance to score," Clark explained.
The top five runners on each team
score a point for each place, so
even though the sixth man doesn't
score for his own team, he can
still force another team's man
back a place.
Trouble From Cal
"We're expecting a lot of
trouble from Cal this year," said
Clark, "so this will give us a
chance to see how we can do
against them before the division
meet. We know they're a lot
stronger than last year. Brian
Maxwell beat Tony [Sandoval]
last season and he's only their
number three man now."
Cal has a special reason for
wanting to win this meet. The
Bears were humiliated by the
Cards in last year's 4-way, taking
third with 82 points just ahead of
San Jose with 86. Stanford won
last year with 28 and West Valley
was runner-up with 32.
As last year's score would
indicate, West Valley is also a
strong team. They took second in
the Sacramento State Invitational
last week with 40 points, more
than 80 ahead of either Stanford's
or Cal's JV teams. They were also
competing without Jim Dare, the
1972 NCAA steeplechase
champion who is expected to run
this week.
Stanford's cross country team
faces three strong area opponents
in its first home meet of the
season on the golf course at 10
a.m. tomorrow.
The Cardinals will be facing a
much-improved California squad
as well as teams from San Jose
State and the West Valley Track
Club. The grassy six-mile course
will be new to many of the
opposing runners, and this should
give the Cards an added
advantage.
"Obviously the fact that we're
on home ground is going to help,"
said coach Marshall Clark, "but
the stronger team is still the one
that's going to win. Right now
we're having a little trouble
keeping people healthy."
Stanford does seem to have
more than its share of sickness
and injury. Jeff Parietti has been
down with the flu, and several
others have been feeling some of
the symptoms.
Steve Crowley came back from
a toe injury to run a 26:29
five-mile in last week's junior
varsity meet at Sacramento, but is
still not quite up to full strength.
Chris Berka is coming back from
an injury also, and is expected to
give the Cards some help.
Co-captain Mark McConnell has
been plagued with knee problems
and will probably be running
below par Saturday, if at all.
Sandoval Near Record
Though the team is below
strength, the Cards are still a force
to be reckoned with. Tony
Sandoval has proved himself a
threat to any field of runners. His
29:15.4 last year was less than
eight seconds behind the Stanford
record for six miles. Jack Bellah,

like Sandoval only in his second
year, is expected to improve on
his 30:27 of last year.
