# IM Roundup
## Biz Teams Triumph 
### PETE BHATIA 
In intramural football, Biz
School teams dominated the past
week's action. The three Biz
teams that played last week
scored a combined 141 points to
their opposition's 12.
Biz I "A" destroyed ZAP
64-12, Biz II "A" rolled over
Larkin 31-0 and Biz II "B"
stomped Mirlo 46-0. Considering
that there is only 20 minutes
playing time in an entire IM game,
those margins are even more
impressive.
In other games, the SAE's
remained undefeated by blanking
Burbank 19-0. The Zetes also
maintained a perfect record with a
41-0 whitewash of the Mutants.
The Bad Guys upset the
perennially tough KA's 13-6.
However, the game must be
replayed since a KA protest was
upheld. The protest came after an
official had ruled a KA pass play

incomplete because two offensive
receivers touched the ball
consecutively.
However, the rule prohibiting
this applies only to pro football.
Thus, even though the KA's went
in and scored immediately
following the incorrect call, the
protest stands and the game will
be replayed.

IM Free Throws are now in
their second week and most first
round matches have been
completed. The tourney is double
elimination and shooting is held
every Monday and Wednesday
nights at Maples Pavilion.

Monday, October 22 is the
second round deadline for IM
Golf and Tennis. Any match not
completed by then will be decided
by a coin flip.
IM Billiards begins next week
and the Cross Country meet is
only two weeks from today.
