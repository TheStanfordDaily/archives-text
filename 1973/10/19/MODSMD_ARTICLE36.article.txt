# Ice Hockey Begins Tomorrow As Cardinals Meet Sacto Saints
## 
### QUIGLEY S. PETERSON 
Buried beneath all the recent playoff and World
Series news was the beginning of the National
Hockey League season. Believe it or not, the
Oakland Seals even won two games in a row last
week.
Well, true enough to form, Stanford's skating
Cardinals began working out the first week of
classes and they open their 1973-74 campaign
tomorrow night in Sacramento at 8 p.m. Their
opponents are the newly formed Sacramento Saints.
The two squads will clash again Sunday afternoon at
2 p.m.
Coach Pat Baldwin says that Stanford doesn't
know what to expect from the Saints, since they are
a new team. But he has definite ideas about
prospects for this year's Stanford team. He is
optimistic despite the setbacks of last winter
quarter.
Senior Chris Counihan, the team captain, is
returning as head of the defensive corps along with
sophomore John Harriss. Harriss sat out last winter
and was sorely missed.
Solid Lines
Centers Tom Bradford and Eddie Leonard are
both back. They will hopefully head up solid lines,
which undoubtedly will include graduate student
Louis Lefond. Henry Koslowski and Tim Peterson
have returned and freshmen Dan Schley and Donny

Stuart have been impressive in practice.
Another new graduate student is forward Tom
Hecklin, who should also help bolster the lineup.
Graduate students are allowed to play because the
team revolves around the Stanford Ice Hockey Club.
Club teams allow graduate students by definition.
Stanford is skating in the same league as last
year. The conference includes teams from Belmont,
San Francisco and California. They will play an
18-20 game schedule, including two definite trips to
Sacramento. The exact number is not known
because details are still being worked out for dates
at San Diego State, UCLA and possibly California at
Squaw Valley.
Best In Three Years?
It is this reporter's opinion that Stanford has the
talent for its best team in three years. As of now,
there are no set lines so it is hard to tell who will be
playing with whom. The defense remains to be
tested past Counihan and Harriss. Returning goalie
Rick Bragdon is a three-year veteran. There are a lot
of new faces and only two starters have been lost
from last year's squad.
Most of the new players were recruited through
friends or the table set up at Maple's on Registration
Day. The club, which works out Sunday nights at
Belmont Iceland, has more members than the team.
Anyone interested in joining can contact president
Chris Counihan at Lasuen House.

Oakland Seals even won two games in a row last
week.
Well, true enough to form, Stanford's skating
Cardinals began working out the first week of
classes and they open their 1973-74 campaign
tomorrow night in Sacramento at 8 p.m. Their
opponents are the newly formed Sacramento Saints.
The two squads will clash again Sunday afternoon at
2 p.m.
Coach Pat Baldwin says that Stanford doesn't
know what to expect from the Saints, since they are
a new team. But he has definite ideas about
prospects for this year's Stanford team. He is
optimistic despite the setbacks of last winter
quarter.
Senior Chris Counihan, the team captain, is
returning as head of the defensive corps along with
sophomore John Harriss. Harriss sat out last winter
and was sorely missed.
Solid Lines
Centers Tom Bradford and Eddie Leonard are
both back. They will hopefully head up solid lines,
which undoubtedly will include graduate student
Louis Lefond. Henry Koslowski and Tim Peterson
have returned and freshmen Dan Schley and Donny

Stuart have been impressive in practice.
Another new graduate student is forward Tom
Hecklin, who should also help bolster the lineup.
Graduate students are allowed to play because the
team revolves around the Stanford Ice Hockey Club.
Club teams allow graduate students by definition.
Stanford is skating in the same league as last
year. The conference includes teams from Belmont,
San Francisco and California. They will play an
18-20 game schedule, including two definite trips to
Sacramento. The exact number is not known
because details are still being worked out for dates
at San Diego State, UCLA and possibly California at
Squaw Valley.
Best In Three Years?
It is this reporter's opinion that Stanford has the
talent for its best team in three years. As of now,
there are no set lines so it is hard to tell who will be
playing with whom. The defense remains to be
tested past Counihan and Harriss. Returning goalie
Rick Bragdon is a three-year veteran. There are a lot
of new faces and only two starters have been lost
from last year's squad.
Most of the new players were recruited through
friends or the table set up at Maple's on Registration
Day. The club, which works out Sunday nights at
Belmont Iceland, has more members than the team.
Anyone interested in joining can contact president
Chris Counihan at Lasuen House.
