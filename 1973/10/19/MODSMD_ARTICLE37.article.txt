# 'Seething' Coach Directs JV In Second Outing Tomorrow
## 
### TIM FERGUSON 
Junior varsity football coach Gunther
Cunningham was exultant Friday after his squad
had dominated UCLA but lost, 24-13. Now he's
seething.
After looking at the game films, Cunningham
says, "There's no question in my mind — we should
have beaten them. Everything was there except the
final score. That's what really pisses me off."
And, despite the Brubabes' 3-0 record (including
a 10-3 win over College of the Canyons, the
lOth-ranked JC in the nation), Cunningham is
convinced that "we're a better football team than
they are." Four turnovers and 85 yards in penalties,
Cunningham says, resulted in his team being 0-1.
The Cardinals get a chance to even their record
today at Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo. The Mustang JV
dropped a 31-10 decision to the same UCLA team,
but Cunningham says Cal Poly had two touchdowns
called back and hence he refuses to install Stanford
as the favorite.
Mike Cordova, who passed for 280 yards against
the Bruins, is accompanying the varsity to
Washington and will not play for the JV. Ron
Himes, a freshman from Diamond Bar, will
quarterback the team.
Quicker Than Cordova
Cunningham says Himes threw 28 touchdown
passes during his last season in high school, and is
quicker than Cordova. Himes can throw from a
drop-back or sprint-out, Cunningham said.
The coach announced Tuesday that Don
Stevenson, who gained 52 yards in nine carries from
the halfback spot against UCLA, will alternate with
Andy Kolesnikow at fullback. Cunningham made
the move to allow Greg Smith, Tom Oberhelman
and Marvin Holmes to fill the two deep-back slots.

The coach planned work this week to develop a
"tougher running game" to allow the Cards to do
what they often failed to do last week: "punch it
in" inside the 20.
Cunningham also announced that Rich Waters
would move to free safety, replacing Mike Conner,
who was burned for a touchdown by UCLA.
Conner, Cunningham said, is "more of a tackling
person" and would be moved to short safety.
Kent Lightfoot, hurt in the UCLA game, is
expected to be out until next week, so John
Olenchalk will take over his offensive guard spot.
Drew Nosworthy will assume Olenchalk's
line backing post.
Cal Poly has a "real good running back,"
Cunningham says, but promises, "We're gonna play
'em emotionally." His team won't suffer a letdown
from the UCLA loss because "I'm not going to give
'em a chance."
Individual Highlights
Despite his rancor over the UCLA loss,
Cunningham was pleased with some individual
performances. Defensive tackle Art Estrada made 21
tackles and was named most valuable defensive
player. Receivers Dave Bruzzone and Jim Jenke
"found out they could catch," and Bruzzone also
"found out he could block," the coach said.
Another result of the Bruin game, Cunningham
says, is that "I feel so much more confidence in the
offensive line."
"We were unsure against UCLA," Cunningham
said. "We've got confidence now."
Only one drawback detracts from Cunningham's
confidence. "We don't have enough time to
practice." The JV practices alone only "15-20
minutes a day," Cunningham says,"and that
requires a great job of adjusting."

halfback Kermit Johnson from behind last week against the Bruins. Tomorrow the Cards hope to get back
in the win column when they face Washington in a 1:30 p.m. game at Seattle.
