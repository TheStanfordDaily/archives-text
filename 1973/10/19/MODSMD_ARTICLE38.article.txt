# Slumping Teams Meet In Seattle
## Cards Challenge Young Huskies Five-Game Stanford Statistics 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
It's been a long rebuilding
season at Wasnington thus far.
Thirteen of the Huskies' 22
starters are freshman or
sophomore puppies. The team
owns a 1-4 record which includes
losses to relatively weak teams
like Oregon State (31-7) and
Hawaii (10-7). If many fans have
their way, Jim Owens' 17-year
coaching career will soon come to
an abrupt halt.
Yet, despite all Washington's
problems, Stanford is only a
two-point favorite going into
tomorrow's 1:30 p.m. game at
Seattle. The last time Stanford
visited Husky Stadium, a Rose
Bowl bid was at stake. This time,
the only thing that will be settled
in the question of which of the
two powers has fallen on harder
times.
The Cardinals, 2-3 after
Saturday's UCLA debacle, are
seeking their seventh straight win
over Washington. Last season,
Stanford rebounded from the
team's loss to USC to down the
Sonny Sixkiller-led Huskies 24-0,
in one of only three losses
Washington suffered that season.
This year, with Sixkiller gone,
Washington has been playing both
junior Dennis Fitzpatrick and
sophomore Chris Rowland at
quarterback, with Fitzpatrick
starting tomorrow.
"Fitzpatrick has shown he can

read the defensive assignments,"
Ownes said, explaining why he
chose to start the quarterback
who is only the second best passer
on the team. Rowland tied a
league record by throwing five
touchdown passes in the Huskies'
54-49 loss to California two weeks
ago.
"I think he [Fitzpatrick] runs
the ball a little better than the

other QB. If they need throwing,
they'll probably go to Rowland,"
Stanford coach Jack Christiansen
said.
For the first time this season
Washington will start senior
fullback Pete Taggares, who has
been hobbled with injuries.
Taggares joins Glen Bonner, a
senior averaging 4.4 yards per
carry, in the backfield.
Like Stanford, Washington has
had to completely rebuild its
offensive line this season, with
three sophomores and a freshman
starting at interior line positions.
And, reminiscent of the Cardinal
mentors, Washington coaches are
saying that the line is playing
increasingly well.
Cohesiveness
According to line coach Tony
Kopay, "Their drive blocking and
(rap blocking has been excellent,
and the whole line has shown
great hustle and cohesiveness."
While the Huskies may keep
the ball cm the artificial turf,
Stanford may alter its game plan
somewhat and throw longer passes
against Washington's man-to-man
defense.
Thus far this season, the Cards
have seen mostly zone defenses
which have not allowed Stanford
receivers to gain more than 38
yards on any one play.
According to Christiansen, "We
expect to see man-to-man
coverage, but we've also drilled
against the zone. Their secondary
coverage has been 'deep
conscious,' playing it loose, but
still, we'll change our emphasis

Five Interceptions
Washington's defensive
backfield is keyed by left
cornerback Roberto Jourdan, who
leads the Pacific Eight conference
with five interceptions.
Up front, the Huskies big star
is left tackle Dave Pear, who has
recovered four fumbles and leads
the team with 88 tackles and

The Huskies, like UCLA, have
had trouble with injuries to

Longview, Wash., as offensive

Freshman quarterback Mike
Cordova, a MoOntlake Terrace,

The Cardinals have relatively
few injury problems going into

season at Wasnington thus far.
Thirteen of the Huskies' 22
starters are freshman or
sophomore puppies. The team
owns a 1-4 record which includes
losses to relatively weak teams
like Oregon State (31-7) and
Hawaii (10-7). If many fans have
their way, Jim Owens' 17-year
coaching career will soon come to
an abrupt halt.
Yet, despite all Washington's
problems, Stanford is only a
two-point favorite going into
tomorrow's 1:30 p.m. game at
Seattle. The last time Stanford
visited Husky Stadium, a Rose
Bowl bid was at stake. This time,
the only thing that will be settled
in the question of which of the
two powers has fallen on harder
times.
The Cardinals, 2-3 after
Saturday's UCLA debacle, are
seeking their seventh straight win
over Washington. Last season,
Stanford rebounded from the
team's loss to USC to down the
Sonny Sixkiller-led Huskies 24-0,
in one of only three losses
Washington suffered that season.
This year, with Sixkiller gone,
Washington has been playing both
junior Dennis Fitzpatrick and
sophomore Chris Rowland at
quarterback, with Fitzpatrick
starting tomorrow.
"Fitzpatrick has shown he can

read the defensive assignments,"
Ownes said, explaining why he
chose to start the quarterback
who is only the second best passer
on the team. Rowland tied a
league record by throwing five
touchdown passes in the Huskies'
54-49 loss to California two weeks
ago.
"I think he [Fitzpatrick] runs
the ball a little better than the

other QB. If they need throwing,
they'll probably go to Rowland,"
Stanford coach Jack Christiansen
said.
For the first time this season
Washington will start senior
fullback Pete Taggares, who has
been hobbled with injuries.
Taggares joins Glen Bonner, a
senior averaging 4.4 yards per
carry, in the backfield.
Like Stanford, Washington has
had to completely rebuild its
offensive line this season, with
three sophomores and a freshman
starting at interior line positions.
And, reminiscent of the Cardinal
mentors, Washington coaches are
saying that the line is playing
increasingly well.
Cohesiveness
According to line coach Tony
Kopay, "Their drive blocking and
(rap blocking has been excellent,
and the whole line has shown
great hustle and cohesiveness."
While the Huskies may keep
the ball cm the artificial turf,
Stanford may alter its game plan
somewhat and throw longer passes
against Washington's man-to-man
defense.
Thus far this season, the Cards
have seen mostly zone defenses
which have not allowed Stanford
receivers to gain more than 38
yards on any one play.
According to Christiansen, "We
expect to see man-to-man
coverage, but we've also drilled
against the zone. Their secondary
coverage has been 'deep
conscious,' playing it loose, but
still, we'll change our emphasis

owns a 1-4 record which includes
losses to relatively weak teams
like Oregon State (31-7) and
Hawaii (10-7). If many fans have
their way, Jim Owens' 17-year
coaching career will soon come to
an abrupt halt.
Yet, despite all Washington's
problems, Stanford is only a
two-point favorite going into
tomorrow's 1:30 p.m. game at
Seattle. The last time Stanford
visited Husky Stadium, a Rose
Bowl bid was at stake. This time,
the only thing that will be settled
in the question of which of the
two powers has fallen on harder
times.
The Cardinals, 2-3 after
Saturday's UCLA debacle, are
seeking their seventh straight win
over Washington. Last season,
Stanford rebounded from the
team's loss to USC to down the
Sonny Sixkiller-led Huskies 24-0,
in one of only three losses
Washington suffered that season.
This year, with Sixkiller gone,
Washington has been playing both
junior Dennis Fitzpatrick and
sophomore Chris Rowland at
quarterback, with Fitzpatrick
starting tomorrow.
"Fitzpatrick has shown he can

read the defensive assignments,"
Ownes said, explaining why he
chose to start the quarterback
who is only the second best passer
on the team. Rowland tied a
league record by throwing five
touchdown passes in the Huskies'
54-49 loss to California two weeks
ago.
"I think he [Fitzpatrick] runs
the ball a little better than the

other QB. If they need throwing,
they'll probably go to Rowland,"
Stanford coach Jack Christiansen
said.
For the first time this season
Washington will start senior
fullback Pete Taggares, who has
been hobbled with injuries.
Taggares joins Glen Bonner, a
senior averaging 4.4 yards per
carry, in the backfield.
Like Stanford, Washington has
had to completely rebuild its
offensive line this season, with
three sophomores and a freshman
starting at interior line positions.
And, reminiscent of the Cardinal
mentors, Washington coaches are
saying that the line is playing
increasingly well.
Cohesiveness
According to line coach Tony
Kopay, "Their drive blocking and
(rap blocking has been excellent,
and the whole line has shown
great hustle and cohesiveness."
While the Huskies may keep
the ball cm the artificial turf,
Stanford may alter its game plan
somewhat and throw longer passes
against Washington's man-to-man
defense.
Thus far this season, the Cards
have seen mostly zone defenses
which have not allowed Stanford
receivers to gain more than 38
yards on any one play.
According to Christiansen, "We
expect to see man-to-man
coverage, but we've also drilled
against the zone. Their secondary
coverage has been 'deep
conscious,' playing it loose, but
still, we'll change our emphasis

Five Interceptions
Washington's defensive
backfield is keyed by left
cornerback Roberto Jourdan, who
leads the Pacific Eight conference
with five interceptions.
Up front, the Huskies big star
is left tackle Dave Pear, who has
recovered four fumbles and leads
the team with 88 tackles and

had trouble with injuries to
defensive starters, especially* on

Cardinal Notes: Christiansen
has named guard Bruce
Blackstone, who hails from
Longview, Wash., as offensive
captain this week. Star defensive
back Randy Poltl has been named
defensive captain, with Drew Palin
leading the special teams.
Freshman quarterback Mike
Cordova, a MoOntlake Terrace,
Wash, native who played on the
junior varsity team last week, will
make the trip along with Mike

The Cardinals have relatively
few injury problems going into
the game. Linebacker Gordie

tight end Brad Williams a sore
shoulder, but only linebacker Dan
Francis, also with a sore
shoulder, is doubtful for
Saturday.
It's been a long rebuilding
season at Wasnington thus far.

starters are freshman or
