# Pac-8 Predictions
## 
### 
The Daily's prognosticator
is now 14-3-1 on the season,
but last week he decided that
even an imbecile could
predict the outcome of
Pacific Eight games with 75
percent accuracy.
Feeling somewhat proud
about his 3-1 record for the
first week of conference
action, our fearless forecaster
took a closer look at his
predictions, discovering, of
course, that in a four-game
schedule that includes USC
and UCLA games, only two
contests are up for grabs. So
last week the Daily was 3-1,
which really means 1-1,
which is exactly the same
outcome you would expect
from a coin toss.
Still, the predictions
continue, if only so the Daily

can at least once correctly
predict the outcome of a
game in vol ving Cat if orn ia's
wondrous Bears. So far the
Daily is 0-3. This week Cal
hosts Oregon State in a game
that should be marked by
countless Alvin White and
Vince Ferragamo passes. The
Bears will prevail (maybe).
In Los Angeles, USC
should waltz past Oregon.
UCLA may have trouble with
Washington State, but the
Bruin Wishbone will be
victorious in the end.
And in Seattle, Stanford
should get back in the win
column against Washington's
inept Huskies.
Stanford 31, Washington 14
USC 42, Oregon 10
UCLA 34, Washington St. 22
California 28, Oregon St. 24
