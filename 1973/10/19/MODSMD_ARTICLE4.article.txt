# Tanks Battle In Sinai; Kosygin Meets Arabs
## 
### Associated Press 
Israeli and Egyptian forces fought
fierce tank battles in Sinai Thursday
and Israel said it had floated tanks
across the Suez Canal to reinforce a
bridgehead on the western side of the
waterway.
The Egyptians claimed they had the
Israeli invaders encircled and facing
destruction.
Soviet Premier Alexei N. Kosygin
held "three long meetings" in Cairo
with President Anwar Sadat of Egypt,
the official Middle East News Agency
of Cairo said yesterday. The dispatch
did not say why Kosygin was in Cairo.

Britain's foreign secretary, Sir Alec
Douglas-Home, said earlier in London
he believed Kosygin was there "on a
mission of peace."
Meanwhile in Washington the
United States kept up its "diplomatic
initiative" seeking help from the
Soviet Union to end the Middle East
fighting, but officials said a
breakthrough was not imminent.
"I can't with any confidence tell
you that we're in a position where we
see the outcome at this time," said
Robert J. McCloskey, the State
Department spokesman in reporting
continued discussions yesterday

between Secretary Henry A. Kissinger
and Soviet Ambassador Anatoly F.
Dobrynin.
U.S. officials said Washington and
Moscow have not narrowed their
differences to the point where the two
countries were considering a specific
proposal to be put before the U.N.
Security Council.
Position Reached
These officials said Israel's Arab
foes evidently have reached a uniform
position regarding a negotiated
settlement.
But an Arab source at the United
Nations in New York said Nixon and
Kissinger left the impression with Arab
diplomats with whom they talked
Wednesday that the United States
would delay a Middle East peace move
until it built up Israel's military
strength. The source said he expected
this resupplying process to take at
least two weeks.
Pentagon analysts who have studied
reports from American representatives
in Israel and Egypt said the 13-day-old
war may be approaching the decisive
point in tank battles in the Sinai
Desert. Other officials said it is not
clear whether Israel or Egypt had
gained an advantage.
Sinai Battle Rages
Fighting on the Sinai front raged on
land and sea and in the air yesterday, a
day after Israeli Chief of Staff David
Elazar said the Israeli concentration
had shifted from Syria to the Sinai.
Barring of newsmen from the Sinai
fighting made it difficult to determine
who had the upper hand on the 13th
day of the war. Neither side said how
many tanks were involved.
The Egyptian command said its
forces had "encircled the enemy and
served an ultimatum on him to
surrender or face destruction."
A later communique late last night
said: "Our forces are evicting
penetrating enemy forces which have
been encircled in scattered locations."
Ferocious Fighting
The Cairo command claimed the
Sinai fighting was "the most ferocious
of all since the war began."
An Israeli military spokesman said
that in addition to splitting the
Egyptian army on the eastern bank of
the canal, Israeli tanks were floated on
rafts across the canal in daylight to
help an Israeli task force.
The relief armor sent to the task
force squeezed through the wedge,
which extended north from the Great
Bitter Lake, the spokesman said.
An Egyptian general said
Wednesday night that the Israeli task
force on the west bank of the canal
had been destroyed.
