# Trainer, Equipment Manager Keep Cards Fit
## Doc Marvin Watches Equipment And Interprets Stanford Mood Stereotyped Image Doesn't Fit Card Trainer Dave Blanchard 
### DAVE ROBINSON MARK WHITE 
Palo Alto Times sports editor Dave Wik
was sitting in a bar two weeks ago in
Champaign, 111., discussing, of course, the
following day's game between Stanford and
the Fighting Dlini.
"We're going to win tomorrow," Wik said
emphatically.
"How come you're so sure?" someone
asked.
"Doc Marvin said we're going to win,"
Wik replied, "and when Doc Marvin feels
good on Friday night, I know we're going to
win on Saturday afternoon."
Virgil (Doc) Marvin has been Stanford's
equipment manager for the past 20 years
and he takes pride in his inside knowledge of
Cardinal football. "I know things about the
players that the coaches don't know,"he
says.
"I get certain vibes from the teamaround
game time. I knew we were going to beat
Illinois. I can usually tell by Friday how
we're going to do the next day."
$200,000 Worth
It was only Wednesday, so Doc wasn't
sure of the outcome of tomorrow's game
against Washington, but he had plenty to say
about other topics as he walked through his
neatly organized equipment room containing
"at least $200,000 worth" of athletic
supplies.
"I do a little bit of everything around
here," Doc said while fixing a pair of
football down markers. "It keeps you
jumping."
Doc orders equipment for all sports,
prepares for road trips ("We have a ton of
baggage on every trip, and you know who
loads it on the bus and plane"), keeps the
equipment sorted and organized, checks
helmets and pads, sends uniforms to the
laundry....
"I'd hate to think what this place would
be like if Doc wasn't running it,"says A 1
Chock, a student manager who often helps
Doc in the equipment room. "This place is
more organized than most pro teams."
"You've just got to get your mind
organized," Doc explains. "Once you get
everything figured out it's not too hard."
Pharmacist's Mate
Doc's mind and the Stanford equipment
room have been efficiently organized since
Nov. 15, 1954, when he took the job at

Stanford only two weeks after retiring from
a 20-year stint in the Navy (he was a
pharmacist's mate in the service, hence the
nickname ""Doc").
"I've hac* a lot of fun around here," he
says, "but it's not as much fun now as it was
around 15 years ago. Football's getting too
serious — it's a big business now. I remember
when we'd suit up 29 men and they'd go
both ways.
"I remember a guy named Don Carswell
who got so mad when he didn't play all 60
minutes one game that he busted his helmet
clear through the training room wall [his
head was inside the helmet at the time]. We
used to keep three helmets for Carswell —
one on his head, one on the sidelines and
one in the equipment room.
"It was different then. Players used to
sit around here all day and talk — they never
went to classes."
Doc is quick to point out, however, that
the recent years haven't been void of
personal rewards and humorous anecdotes.
Shockley A Favorite
"[Hillary] Shockley was one of my
favorites," he said. "He left for home a few
days before the 1972 Rose Bowl and told
me he was just fed up and wasn't going to
play. So when Mike White [then Stanford
offensive coach] found out Shockley was
missing, he stormed through the hotel and
asked 'Do you know where the hell
Shockley is?' "
"Yeh," Doc replied, "Don't you?"
Pete Lazetich was another recipient of
Doc's friendship and philosophical guidance.
Lazetich, like Doc, is from Montana, and
Doc was extremely disturbed when he saw
Laz whining and crying a lot as a freshman.
"I just took him aside and told him that
when I was in Montana, 'Men were men and
women were glad of it and kids played
tiddlywinks on the manholes — no babies
came out of that place,' " Doc recalls.
Now a picture of Lazetich adorns the
equipment room wall. "To Doc, the man
who made me a man — Pete Lazetich," the
signature reads.
There are countless other mementoes on
the walls — pictures, sideline ribbons from
different games, even a jock strap
commemorating the 1972 Rose Bowl — all
rewards for his 20 years as a fixture in
Stanford's equipment room.

If one were to search for Stanford's head
trainer armed only with stereotypical
expectations of how a trainer should behave
or what one looks like, chances are he would
never find Dave Blanchard.
For some reason the American film and
television industry has portrayed athletic
trainers in a manner whcih would lead you
to believe that they encompassed only a
limited range of human qualities.
One popular model portrays the trainer as
someone approaching a maternalistic lackey
— a skinny little man with hom rimmed
glasses wearing a worried expression, as if he
feared his supply of gauze was running out.
Or there is an alternate model — the
oversized, underbrained sloven bulging under
a sweaty tee-shirt whose specialty is a thick
handed massage.
Dave Blanchard is none of these things. A
graduate of Stanford's school of physical
therapy, Blanchard has nine years experience
as head trainer at San Jose State, with the
San Francisco 49'ers and at Stanford. As a
result he has a quiet, level air about him
which somehow simultaneously instills
confidence and respect in Stanford athletes.
He is a professional — nothing like the
Hollywood archetype chiropractic shcool
washout.
Full-Time Job
Blanchard, his fulltime assistant Stan
Scott (known as Scottie, also a licensed
physical therapist) and two student
assistants are responsible for the prevention
and care of athletic injuries incurred by all
of Stanford's intercollegiate teams. It is a
full-time job, as anyone who has been near
training quarters around 1 p.m. any weekday
can tell you.
Dave accompanies the teams on trips, and
in addition to taping ankles and planning
menus, he goes to the games — but not to
watch in the manner most fans do.
"During most of the game," Dave said, "I
watch the field closely, usually keeping my
eyes peeled on the ground for injuries. Some
players are skilled at masking it when they
are hurt, so I may get the word from other
players."
When a football injury does occur, Dave
is usually the first one out on the field. "The
first thing I try to do is to find out where he
is injured, then we try to relax and reassure

him. Once we've assessed the magnitude of
the injury, we try to get him off the field on
his own power, and if that's not possible,
we'll use the stretcher.
Doctor Has Last Say
"As soon as we get him to the sidelines,
we'll have the team physician look at him.
The doctor always has the last say as to
whether or not the player can continue. If
it's a minor injury, like a bruised limb, the
player usually returns.
"However, any major injury, especially
those concerned with the head, like
concussions, will most certainly keep the
player out of the game."
Dave's professional expertise culminated
in one of the highest honors a trainer can be
bestowed with in 1971, when he was chosen
as one of the 10 national district trainers to
accompany the American team to the
Munich Olympics.
"It was really great — a hell of an
experience," Dave recalls.
Minimum Drug Usage
Contrary to some press reports, Dave
feels drug usage at Munich was held to a
minimum. "With the comprehensive drug
tests the officials gave, I'd have to say the
Games were fairly dry and that drug usage
wasn't a factor in the outcome."
The drug situation in the U.S. is not so
pristine, however. "Athletic drug usage
across the nation is declining, but it still
varies from school to school. At Stanford
there is minimal use of drugs — the basic
consensus between the doctors and trainers
is that drugs just don't help that much.
Although there once was unauthorized,
clandestine usage by some players, now
there is none."
As a trainer facing high rates of injuries
among players, Blanchard was asked if there
were any equipment or rule changes that
could reduce rates of injury.
"Basically not. Although they might put
more padding on shoulder pads so they
weren't so hard, theequipmentin general has
been refined to a high level. The same goes
for the rules; you could not change enough
rules to make the game injury-free without
changing the entire makeup of football.
Whenever you have bodies colliding at full
speed, you're going to have injuries. As
equipment and rules stand now, those
injuries should be minimized."

For some reason the American film and
television industry has portrayed athletic
trainers in a manner whcih would lead you
to believe that they encompassed only a
limited range of human qualities.
One popular model portrays the trainer as
someone approaching a maternalistic lackey
— a skinny little man with hom rimmed
glasses wearing a worried expression, as if he
feared his supply of gauze was running out.
Or there is an alternate model — the
oversized, underbrained sloven bulging under
a sweaty tee-shirt whose specialty is a thick
handed massage.
Dave Blanchard is none of these things. A
graduate of Stanford's school of physical
therapy, Blanchard has nine years experience
as head trainer at San Jose State, with the
San Francisco 49'ers and at Stanford. As a
result he has a quiet, level air about him
which somehow simultaneously instills
confidence and respect in Stanford athletes.
He is a professional — nothing like the
Hollywood archetype chiropractic shcool
washout.
Full-Time Job
Blanchard, his fulltime assistant Stan
Scott (known as Scottie, also a licensed
physical therapist) and two student
assistants are responsible for the prevention
and care of athletic injuries incurred by all
of Stanford's intercollegiate teams. It is a
full-time job, as anyone who has been near
training quarters around 1 p.m. any weekday
can tell you.
Dave accompanies the teams on trips, and
in addition to taping ankles and planning
menus, he goes to the games — but not to
watch in the manner most fans do.
"During most of the game," Dave said, "I
watch the field closely, usually keeping my
eyes peeled on the ground for injuries. Some
players are skilled at masking it when they
are hurt, so I may get the word from other
players."
When a football injury does occur, Dave
is usually the first one out on the field. "The
first thing I try to do is to find out where he
is injured, then we try to relax and reassure

him. Once we've assessed the magnitude of
the injury, we try to get him off the field on
his own power, and if that's not possible,
we'll use the stretcher.
Doctor Has Last Say
"As soon as we get him to the sidelines,
we'll have the team physician look at him.
The doctor always has the last say as to
whether or not the player can continue. If
it's a minor injury, like a bruised limb, the
player usually returns.
"However, any major injury, especially
those concerned with the head, like
concussions, will most certainly keep the
player out of the game."
Dave's professional expertise culminated
in one of the highest honors a trainer can be
bestowed with in 1971, when he was chosen
as one of the 10 national district trainers to
accompany the American team to the
Munich Olympics.
"It was really great — a hell of an
experience," Dave recalls.
Minimum Drug Usage
Contrary to some press reports, Dave
feels drug usage at Munich was held to a
minimum. "With the comprehensive drug
tests the officials gave, I'd have to say the
Games were fairly dry and that drug usage
wasn't a factor in the outcome."
The drug situation in the U.S. is not so
pristine, however. "Athletic drug usage
across the nation is declining, but it still
varies from school to school. At Stanford
there is minimal use of drugs — the basic
consensus between the doctors and trainers
is that drugs just don't help that much.
Although there once was unauthorized,
clandestine usage by some players, now
there is none."
As a trainer facing high rates of injuries
among players, Blanchard was asked if there
were any equipment or rule changes that
could reduce rates of injury.
"Basically not. Although they might put
more padding on shoulder pads so they
weren't so hard, theequipmentin general has
been refined to a high level. The same goes
for the rules; you could not change enough
rules to make the game injury-free without
changing the entire makeup of football.
Whenever you have bodies colliding at full
speed, you're going to have injuries. As
equipment and rules stand now, those
injuries should be minimized."

Equipment Manager Doc Marvin


Trainer Dave Blanchard
Palo Alto Times sports editor Dave Wik
was sitting in a bar two weeks ago in
Champaign, 111., discussing, of course, the
following day's game between Stanford and
the Fighting Dlini.
"We're going to win tomorrow," Wik said
emphatically.
"How come you're so sure?" someone
asked.
"Doc Marvin said we're going to win,"
Wik replied, "and when Doc Marvin feels
good on Friday night, I know we're going to
win on Saturday afternoon."
Virgil (Doc) Marvin has been Stanford's
equipment manager for the past 20 years
and he takes pride in his inside knowledge of
Cardinal football. "I know things about the
players that the coaches don't know,"he
says.
"I get certain vibes from the teamaround
game time. I knew we were going to beat
Illinois. I can usually tell by Friday how
we're going to do the next day."
$200,000 Worth
It was only Wednesday, so Doc wasn't
sure of the outcome of tomorrow's game
against Washington, but he had plenty to say
about other topics as he walked through his
neatly organized equipment room containing
"at least $200,000 worth" of athletic
supplies.
"I do a little bit of everything around
here," Doc said while fixing a pair of
football down markers. "It keeps you
jumping."
Doc orders equipment for all sports,
prepares for road trips ("We have a ton of
baggage on every trip, and you know who
loads it on the bus and plane"), keeps the
equipment sorted and organized, checks
helmets and pads, sends uniforms to the
laundry....
"I'd hate to think what this place would
be like if Doc wasn't running it,"says A 1
Chock, a student manager who often helps
Doc in the equipment room. "This place is
more organized than most pro teams."
"You've just got to get your mind
organized," Doc explains. "Once you get
everything figured out it's not too hard."
Pharmacist's Mate
Doc's mind and the Stanford equipment
room have been efficiently organized since
Nov. 15, 1954, when he took the job at

Stanford only two weeks after retiring from
a 20-year stint in the Navy (he was a
pharmacist's mate in the service, hence the
nickname ""Doc").
"I've hac* a lot of fun around here," he
says, "but it's not as much fun now as it was
around 15 years ago. Football's getting too
serious — it's a big business now. I remember
when we'd suit up 29 men and they'd go
both ways.
"I remember a guy named Don Carswell
who got so mad when he didn't play all 60
minutes one game that he busted his helmet
clear through the training room wall [his
head was inside the helmet at the time]. We
used to keep three helmets for Carswell —
one on his head, one on the sidelines and
one in the equipment room.
"It was different then. Players used to
sit around here all day and talk — they never
went to classes."
Doc is quick to point out, however, that
the recent years haven't been void of
personal rewards and humorous anecdotes.
Shockley A Favorite
"[Hillary] Shockley was one of my
favorites," he said. "He left for home a few
days before the 1972 Rose Bowl and told
me he was just fed up and wasn't going to
play. So when Mike White [then Stanford
offensive coach] found out Shockley was
missing, he stormed through the hotel and
asked 'Do you know where the hell
Shockley is?' "
"Yeh," Doc replied, "Don't you?"
Pete Lazetich was another recipient of
Doc's friendship and philosophical guidance.
Lazetich, like Doc, is from Montana, and
Doc was extremely disturbed when he saw
Laz whining and crying a lot as a freshman.
"I just took him aside and told him that
when I was in Montana, 'Men were men and
women were glad of it and kids played
tiddlywinks on the manholes — no babies
came out of that place,' " Doc recalls.
Now a picture of Lazetich adorns the
equipment room wall. "To Doc, the man
who made me a man — Pete Lazetich," the
signature reads.
There are countless other mementoes on
the walls — pictures, sideline ribbons from
different games, even a jock strap
commemorating the 1972 Rose Bowl — all
rewards for his 20 years as a fixture in
Stanford's equipment room.

If one were to search for Stanford's head
trainer armed only with stereotypical
expectations of how a trainer should behave
or what one looks like, chances are he would
never find Dave Blanchard.
For some reason the American film and

says.
"I get certain vibes from the teamaround
game time. I knew we were going to beat
Illinois. I can usually tell by Friday how
we're going to do the next day."
$200,000 Worth
It was only Wednesday, so Doc wasn't
sure of the outcome of tomorrow's game
against Washington, but he had plenty to say
about other topics as he walked through his
neatly organized equipment room containing
"at least $200,000 worth" of athletic
supplies.
"I do a little bit of everything around
here," Doc said while fixing a pair of
football down markers. "It keeps you
jumping."
Doc orders equipment for all sports,
prepares for road trips ("We have a ton of
baggage on every trip, and you know who
loads it on the bus and plane"), keeps the
equipment sorted and organized, checks
helmets and pads, sends uniforms to the
laundry....
"I'd hate to think what this place would
be like if Doc wasn't running it,"says A 1
Chock, a student manager who often helps
Doc in the equipment room. "This place is
more organized than most pro teams."
"You've just got to get your mind
organized," Doc explains. "Once you get
everything figured out it's not too hard."
Pharmacist's Mate
Doc's mind and the Stanford equipment
room have been efficiently organized since
Nov. 15, 1954, when he took the job at

Stanford only two weeks after retiring from
a 20-year stint in the Navy (he was a
pharmacist's mate in the service, hence the
nickname ""Doc").
"I've hac* a lot of fun around here," he
says, "but it's not as much fun now as it was
around 15 years ago. Football's getting too
serious — it's a big business now. I remember
when we'd suit up 29 men and they'd go
both ways.
"I remember a guy named Don Carswell
who got so mad when he didn't play all 60
minutes one game that he busted his helmet
clear through the training room wall [his
head was inside the helmet at the time]. We
used to keep three helmets for Carswell —
one on his head, one on the sidelines and
one in the equipment room.
"It was different then. Players used to
sit around here all day and talk — they never
went to classes."
Doc is quick to point out, however, that
the recent years haven't been void of
personal rewards and humorous anecdotes.
Shockley A Favorite
"[Hillary] Shockley was one of my
favorites," he said. "He left for home a few
days before the 1972 Rose Bowl and told
me he was just fed up and wasn't going to
play. So when Mike White [then Stanford
offensive coach] found out Shockley was
missing, he stormed through the hotel and
asked 'Do you know where the hell
Shockley is?' "
"Yeh," Doc replied, "Don't you?"
Pete Lazetich was another recipient of
Doc's friendship and philosophical guidance.
Lazetich, like Doc, is from Montana, and
Doc was extremely disturbed when he saw
Laz whining and crying a lot as a freshman.
"I just took him aside and told him that
when I was in Montana, 'Men were men and
women were glad of it and kids played
tiddlywinks on the manholes — no babies
came out of that place,' " Doc recalls.
Now a picture of Lazetich adorns the
equipment room wall. "To Doc, the man
who made me a man — Pete Lazetich," the
signature reads.
There are countless other mementoes on
the walls — pictures, sideline ribbons from
different games, even a jock strap
commemorating the 1972 Rose Bowl — all
rewards for his 20 years as a fixture in
Stanford's equipment room.

If one were to search for Stanford's head
trainer armed only with stereotypical
expectations of how a trainer should behave
or what one looks like, chances are he would
never find Dave Blanchard.
For some reason the American film and
television industry has portrayed athletic
trainers in a manner whcih would lead you
to believe that they encompassed only a
limited range of human qualities.
One popular model portrays the trainer as
someone approaching a maternalistic lackey
— a skinny little man with hom rimmed
glasses wearing a worried expression, as if he
feared his supply of gauze was running out.
Or there is an alternate model — the
oversized, underbrained sloven bulging under
a sweaty tee-shirt whose specialty is a thick
handed massage.
Dave Blanchard is none of these things. A
graduate of Stanford's school of physical
therapy, Blanchard has nine years experience
as head trainer at San Jose State, with the
San Francisco 49'ers and at Stanford. As a
result he has a quiet, level air about him
which somehow simultaneously instills
confidence and respect in Stanford athletes.
He is a professional — nothing like the
Hollywood archetype chiropractic shcool
washout.
Full-Time Job
Blanchard, his fulltime assistant Stan
Scott (known as Scottie, also a licensed
physical therapist) and two student
assistants are responsible for the prevention
and care of athletic injuries incurred by all
of Stanford's intercollegiate teams. It is a
full-time job, as anyone who has been near
training quarters around 1 p.m. any weekday
can tell you.
Dave accompanies the teams on trips, and
in addition to taping ankles and planning
menus, he goes to the games — but not to
watch in the manner most fans do.
"During most of the game," Dave said, "I
watch the field closely, usually keeping my
eyes peeled on the ground for injuries. Some
players are skilled at masking it when they
are hurt, so I may get the word from other
players."
When a football injury does occur, Dave
is usually the first one out on the field. "The
first thing I try to do is to find out where he
is injured, then we try to relax and reassure

him. Once we've assessed the magnitude of
the injury, we try to get him off the field on
his own power, and if that's not possible,
we'll use the stretcher.
Doctor Has Last Say
"As soon as we get him to the sidelines,
we'll have the team physician look at him.
The doctor always has the last say as to
whether or not the player can continue. If
it's a minor injury, like a bruised limb, the
player usually returns.
"However, any major injury, especially
those concerned with the head, like
concussions, will most certainly keep the
player out of the game."
Dave's professional expertise culminated
in one of the highest honors a trainer can be
bestowed with in 1971, when he was chosen
as one of the 10 national district trainers to
accompany the American team to the
Munich Olympics.
"It was really great — a hell of an
experience," Dave recalls.
Minimum Drug Usage
Contrary to some press reports, Dave
feels drug usage at Munich was held to a
minimum. "With the comprehensive drug
tests the officials gave, I'd have to say the
Games were fairly dry and that drug usage
wasn't a factor in the outcome."
The drug situation in the U.S. is not so
pristine, however. "Athletic drug usage
across the nation is declining, but it still
varies from school to school. At Stanford
there is minimal use of drugs — the basic
consensus between the doctors and trainers
is that drugs just don't help that much.
Although there once was unauthorized,
clandestine usage by some players, now
there is none."
As a trainer facing high rates of injuries
among players, Blanchard was asked if there
were any equipment or rule changes that
could reduce rates of injury.
"Basically not. Although they might put
more padding on shoulder pads so they
weren't so hard, theequipmentin general has
been refined to a high level. The same goes
for the rules; you could not change enough
rules to make the game injury-free without
changing the entire makeup of football.
Whenever you have bodies colliding at full
speed, you're going to have injuries. As
equipment and rules stand now, those
injuries should be minimized."

Equipment Manager Doc Marvin


Trainer Dave Blanchard
Palo Alto Times sports editor Dave Wik
was sitting in a bar two weeks ago in
Champaign, 111., discussing, of course, the
following day's game between Stanford and
the Fighting Dlini.
"We're going to win tomorrow," Wik said
emphatically.

Wik replied, "and when Doc Marvin feels

confidence and respect in Stanford athletes.
He is a professional — nothing like the
Hollywood archetype chiropractic shcool
washout.
Full-Time Job
Blanchard, his fulltime assistant Stan
Scott (known as Scottie, also a licensed
physical therapist) and two student
assistants are responsible for the prevention
and care of athletic injuries incurred by all
of Stanford's intercollegiate teams. It is a
full-time job, as anyone who has been near
training quarters around 1 p.m. any weekday
can tell you.
Dave accompanies the teams on trips, and
in addition to taping ankles and planning
menus, he goes to the games — but not to
watch in the manner most fans do.
"During most of the game," Dave said, "I
watch the field closely, usually keeping my
eyes peeled on the ground for injuries. Some
players are skilled at masking it when they
are hurt, so I may get the word from other
players."
When a football injury does occur, Dave
is usually the first one out on the field. "The
first thing I try to do is to find out where he
is injured, then we try to relax and reassure

him. Once we've assessed the magnitude of
the injury, we try to get him off the field on
his own power, and if that's not possible,
we'll use the stretcher.
Doctor Has Last Say
"As soon as we get him to the sidelines,
we'll have the team physician look at him.
The doctor always has the last say as to
whether or not the player can continue. If
it's a minor injury, like a bruised limb, the
player usually returns.
"However, any major injury, especially
those concerned with the head, like
concussions, will most certainly keep the
player out of the game."
Dave's professional expertise culminated
in one of the highest honors a trainer can be
bestowed with in 1971, when he was chosen
as one of the 10 national district trainers to
accompany the American team to the
Munich Olympics.
"It was really great — a hell of an
experience," Dave recalls.
Minimum Drug Usage
Contrary to some press reports, Dave
feels drug usage at Munich was held to a
minimum. "With the comprehensive drug
tests the officials gave, I'd have to say the
Games were fairly dry and that drug usage
wasn't a factor in the outcome."
The drug situation in the U.S. is not so
pristine, however. "Athletic drug usage
across the nation is declining, but it still
varies from school to school. At Stanford
there is minimal use of drugs — the basic
consensus between the doctors and trainers
is that drugs just don't help that much.
Although there once was unauthorized,
clandestine usage by some players, now
there is none."
As a trainer facing high rates of injuries
among players, Blanchard was asked if there
were any equipment or rule changes that
could reduce rates of injury.
"Basically not. Although they might put
more padding on shoulder pads so they
weren't so hard, theequipmentin general has
been refined to a high level. The same goes
for the rules; you could not change enough
rules to make the game injury-free without
changing the entire makeup of football.
Whenever you have bodies colliding at full
speed, you're going to have injuries. As
equipment and rules stand now, those
injuries should be minimized."

Equipment Manager Doc Marvin


Trainer Dave Blanchard
Palo Alto Times sports editor Dave Wik
was sitting in a bar two weeks ago in
Champaign, 111., discussing, of course, the
following day's game between Stanford and
the Fighting Dlini.
"We're going to win tomorrow," Wik said
emphatically.
"How come you're so sure?" someone
asked.
"Doc Marvin said we're going to win,"
Wik replied, "and when Doc Marvin feels
good on Friday night, I know we're going to
win on Saturday afternoon."
Virgil (Doc) Marvin has been Stanford's
equipment manager for the past 20 years
and he takes pride in his inside knowledge of
Cardinal football. "I know things about the
players that the coaches don't know,"he
says.
"I get certain vibes from the teamaround
game time. I knew we were going to beat
Illinois. I can usually tell by Friday how
we're going to do the next day."
$200,000 Worth
It was only Wednesday, so Doc wasn't
sure of the outcome of tomorrow's game
against Washington, but he had plenty to say
about other topics as he walked through his
neatly organized equipment room containing
"at least $200,000 worth" of athletic
supplies.
"I do a little bit of everything around
here," Doc said while fixing a pair of
football down markers. "It keeps you
jumping."
Doc orders equipment for all sports,
prepares for road trips ("We have a ton of
baggage on every trip, and you know who
loads it on the bus and plane"), keeps the
equipment sorted and organized, checks
helmets and pads, sends uniforms to the
laundry....
"I'd hate to think what this place would
be like if Doc wasn't running it,"says A 1
Chock, a student manager who often helps
Doc in the equipment room. "This place is
more organized than most pro teams."
"You've just got to get your mind
organized," Doc explains. "Once you get
everything figured out it's not too hard."
Pharmacist's Mate
Doc's mind and the Stanford equipment
room have been efficiently organized since
Nov. 15, 1954, when he took the job at

Stanford only two weeks after retiring from
a 20-year stint in the Navy (he was a
pharmacist's mate in the service, hence the
nickname ""Doc").
"I've hac* a lot of fun around here," he
says, "but it's not as much fun now as it was
around 15 years ago. Football's getting too
serious — it's a big business now. I remember
when we'd suit up 29 men and they'd go
both ways.
"I remember a guy named Don Carswell
who got so mad when he didn't play all 60
minutes one game that he busted his helmet
clear through the training room wall [his
head was inside the helmet at the time]. We
used to keep three helmets for Carswell —
one on his head, one on the sidelines and
one in the equipment room.
"It was different then. Players used to
sit around here all day and talk — they never
went to classes."
Doc is quick to point out, however, that
the recent years haven't been void of
personal rewards and humorous anecdotes.
Shockley A Favorite
"[Hillary] Shockley was one of my
favorites," he said. "He left for home a few
days before the 1972 Rose Bowl and told
me he was just fed up and wasn't going to
play. So when Mike White [then Stanford
offensive coach] found out Shockley was
missing, he stormed through the hotel and
asked 'Do you know where the hell
Shockley is?' "
"Yeh," Doc replied, "Don't you?"
Pete Lazetich was another recipient of
Doc's friendship and philosophical guidance.
Lazetich, like Doc, is from Montana, and
Doc was extremely disturbed when he saw
Laz whining and crying a lot as a freshman.
"I just took him aside and told him that
when I was in Montana, 'Men were men and
women were glad of it and kids played
tiddlywinks on the manholes — no babies
came out of that place,' " Doc recalls.
Now a picture of Lazetich adorns the
equipment room wall. "To Doc, the man
who made me a man — Pete Lazetich," the
signature reads.
There are countless other mementoes on
the walls — pictures, sideline ribbons from
different games, even a jock strap
commemorating the 1972 Rose Bowl — all
rewards for his 20 years as a fixture in
Stanford's equipment room.

If one were to search for Stanford's head
trainer armed only with stereotypical
expectations of how a trainer should behave
or what one looks like, chances are he would
never find Dave Blanchard.
For some reason the American film and
television industry has portrayed athletic
trainers in a manner whcih would lead you
to believe that they encompassed only a
limited range of human qualities.
One popular model portrays the trainer as
someone approaching a maternalistic lackey
— a skinny little man with hom rimmed
glasses wearing a worried expression, as if he
feared his supply of gauze was running out.
Or there is an alternate model — the
oversized, underbrained sloven bulging under
a sweaty tee-shirt whose specialty is a thick
handed massage.
Dave Blanchard is none of these things. A
graduate of Stanford's school of physical
therapy, Blanchard has nine years experience
as head trainer at San Jose State, with the
San Francisco 49'ers and at Stanford. As a
result he has a quiet, level air about him
which somehow simultaneously instills
confidence and respect in Stanford athletes.
