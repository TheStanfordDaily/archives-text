Arab Gunmen Capture Bank
BEIRUT — The Algerian ambassador to Lebanon has
abandoned mediation efforts with masked Arab gunmen
holding 66 Bank of America employees hostage in the
bank's offices.
But a second deadline set by the terrorists passed this
morning without their carrying out a threat to kill the 64
Lebanese and two Japanese hostages and to blow up the
seven-story bank building.
The five men demanded $10 million from the Bank of
America to support the Palestinian guerrilla movement
and the Arab war against Israel, release of Palestinian
guerrillas in Lebanese jails and a plane to take them to
Algeria or South Yemen.
Algerian Ambassador Mohammed Yazid, who was
acting as mediator between the gunmen and Lebanese
Interior Minister Bahi Takieddin, made a final appeal to
the terrorists late last night to reduce their demands. The
gunmen refused, and Yazid said he was abandoning his
efforts.
Wearing masks, the terrorists stormed into the building
at noon yesterday and seized the Bank of America's
offices on the third and fourth floors. The building also
houses the local branches of the Manufacturers Hanover
Trust Co. and the Chemical Bank of New York, as well as
a West German and a Lebanese bank.
After two gun battles with police and troops in which a
policeman was killed and at least seven persons wounded,
the terrorists threw two notes listing their demands out of
a window.
They first set a 6 p.m. deadline and then changed it to
6 a.m.
As the 6 a.m. deadline passed, police said the gunmen
had broken into the building's cafeteria and had food for
several days.
The terrorists said they were members of the Lebanese
Socialist Revolutionary Movement. Police said their leader
was Morshed Shibbo, also known as Jamil, the country's
most-wanted fugitive. He led a series of bombings and
bank robberies in Beirut last year.
The men were armed with automatic weapons and
grenades.
Justice Dept. Overhauled
WASHINGTON — Atty. Gen. Elliot L. Richardson
announced yesterday a major overhaul designed to tighten
the control he and top aides exercise over the huge Justice
Department.
He said his predecessors too often ignored
administrative duties and said his reorganization will
answer "a real need for putting the pieces together to
assure that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts."
One feature of the overhaul, which takes effect
Tuesday, is the establishment of an "executive
Secretariat" as Richardson's constant monitor of work
going on in the department, especially on projected policy

changes.
The reorganization reflects Richardson's desire for a
system that allows him to learn instantly the status of a
particular project without having to ask a dozen people in
as many separate units.
Economy, Inflation Boom
WASHINGTON — The country's economic growth
during the third quarter of the year was just about what
the Nixon administration wanted but inflation continued
at a disappointingly high rate, the government reported
yesterday.
The Commerce Department's third-quarter report on
the Gross National Product included both good news — a
favorable 3.6 percent annual rate of real economic growth
— and bad news, an inflation rate of 6.7 percent. The
overall increase in GNP — which is the value of the
nation's output of goods and services — was listed as up
$32 billion, or 10.4 percent, to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $1.3 trillion.
The high rate of inflation was not a surprise. It had
been clearly indicated by earlier government indexes on
consumer and wholesale prices.
But the Nixon administration seemed sure to be
satisfied with the 3.6 percent increase in real economic
growth, which followed the explosive 8.7 percent growth
rate of the first quarter and the low rate of 2.4 percent in
the second quarter.
Woman Spikes Orange Juice
LAKELAND, Fla. — Police are searching for a woman
they believe handed out free orange juice drinks spiked
with drugs.
said 15 persons in Lakeland, St.
Petersburg, Orlando and Daytona Beach, Fla., were
hospitalized after sampling the juice Tuesday and
Wednesday.
Lakeland police identified the drug as belladonna, an
antispasmodic used for intestinal ailments. St. Petersburg
officials identified it as atropine, a derivative of
belladonna used to slow the pulse of heart patients.

nation's output of goods and services — was listed as up
$32 billion, or 10.4 percent, to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $1.3 trillion.
The high rate of inflation was not a surprise. It had
been clearly indicated by earlier government indexes on
consumer and wholesale prices.
But the Nixon administration seemed sure to be
satisfied with the 3.6 percent increase in real economic
growth, which followed the explosive 8.7 percent growth
rate of the first quarter and the low rate of 2.4 percent in
the second quarter.

A's in the pivotal fifth game of the 1973 World Series.
The victory gave the Mets a 3-2 edge in the
best-of-seven Series, which moves back to Oakland for
Game 6 tomorrow at 1 p.m., PDT.
Today's Weather

Arab Gunmen Capture Bank
BEIRUT — The Algerian ambassador to Lebanon has
abandoned mediation efforts with masked Arab gunmen
holding 66 Bank of America employees hostage in the
bank's offices.
But a second deadline set by the terrorists passed this
morning without their carrying out a threat to kill the 64
Lebanese and two Japanese hostages and to blow up the
seven-story bank building.
The five men demanded $10 million from the Bank of
America to support the Palestinian guerrilla movement
and the Arab war against Israel, release of Palestinian
guerrillas in Lebanese jails and a plane to take them to
Algeria or South Yemen.
Algerian Ambassador Mohammed Yazid, who was
acting as mediator between the gunmen and Lebanese
Interior Minister Bahi Takieddin, made a final appeal to
the terrorists late last night to reduce their demands. The
gunmen refused, and Yazid said he was abandoning his
efforts.
Wearing masks, the terrorists stormed into the building
at noon yesterday and seized the Bank of America's
offices on the third and fourth floors. The building also
houses the local branches of the Manufacturers Hanover
Trust Co. and the Chemical Bank of New York, as well as
a West German and a Lebanese bank.
After two gun battles with police and troops in which a
policeman was killed and at least seven persons wounded,
the terrorists threw two notes listing their demands out of
a window.
They first set a 6 p.m. deadline and then changed it to
6 a.m.
As the 6 a.m. deadline passed, police said the gunmen
had broken into the building's cafeteria and had food for
several days.
The terrorists said they were members of the Lebanese
Socialist Revolutionary Movement. Police said their leader
was Morshed Shibbo, also known as Jamil, the country's
most-wanted fugitive. He led a series of bombings and
bank robberies in Beirut last year.
The men were armed with automatic weapons and
grenades.
Justice Dept. Overhauled
WASHINGTON — Atty. Gen. Elliot L. Richardson
announced yesterday a major overhaul designed to tighten
the control he and top aides exercise over the huge Justice
Department.
He said his predecessors too often ignored
administrative duties and said his reorganization will
answer "a real need for putting the pieces together to
assure that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts."
One feature of the overhaul, which takes effect
Tuesday, is the establishment of an "executive
Secretariat" as Richardson's constant monitor of work
going on in the department, especially on projected policy

changes.
The reorganization reflects Richardson's desire for a
system that allows him to learn instantly the status of a
particular project without having to ask a dozen people in
as many separate units.
Economy, Inflation Boom
WASHINGTON — The country's economic growth
during the third quarter of the year was just about what
the Nixon administration wanted but inflation continued
at a disappointingly high rate, the government reported
yesterday.
The Commerce Department's third-quarter report on
the Gross National Product included both good news — a
favorable 3.6 percent annual rate of real economic growth
— and bad news, an inflation rate of 6.7 percent. The
overall increase in GNP — which is the value of the
nation's output of goods and services — was listed as up

the terrorists threw two notes listing their demands out of
a window.
They first set a 6 p.m. deadline and then changed it to
6 a.m.
As the 6 a.m. deadline passed, police said the gunmen
had broken into the building's cafeteria and had food for
several days.
The terrorists said they were members of the Lebanese
Socialist Revolutionary Movement. Police said their leader
was Morshed Shibbo, also known as Jamil, the country's
most-wanted fugitive. He led a series of bombings and
bank robberies in Beirut last year.
The men were armed with automatic weapons and
grenades.
Justice Dept. Overhauled
WASHINGTON — Atty. Gen. Elliot L. Richardson
announced yesterday a major overhaul designed to tighten
the control he and top aides exercise over the huge Justice
Department.
He said his predecessors too often ignored
administrative duties and said his reorganization will
answer "a real need for putting the pieces together to
assure that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts."
One feature of the overhaul, which takes effect
Tuesday, is the establishment of an "executive
Secretariat" as Richardson's constant monitor of work
going on in the department, especially on projected policy

changes.
The reorganization reflects Richardson's desire for a
system that allows him to learn instantly the status of a
particular project without having to ask a dozen people in
as many separate units.
Economy, Inflation Boom
WASHINGTON — The country's economic growth
during the third quarter of the year was just about what
the Nixon administration wanted but inflation continued
at a disappointingly high rate, the government reported
yesterday.
The Commerce Department's third-quarter report on
the Gross National Product included both good news — a
favorable 3.6 percent annual rate of real economic growth
— and bad news, an inflation rate of 6.7 percent. The
overall increase in GNP — which is the value of the
nation's output of goods and services — was listed as up
$32 billion, or 10.4 percent, to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $1.3 trillion.
The high rate of inflation was not a surprise. It had
been clearly indicated by earlier government indexes on
consumer and wholesale prices.
But the Nixon administration seemed sure to be
satisfied with the 3.6 percent increase in real economic
growth, which followed the explosive 8.7 percent growth
rate of the first quarter and the low rate of 2.4 percent in
the second quarter.

belladonna used to slow the pulse of heart patients.
