# Student Senate Begins Session, Ratifies ASSU Election Results
## 
### BILL ROSS 
The ASSU Senate at its first
meeting last night certified the results
of last week's ASSU election, but
postponed election of officers until its
next meeting.
ASSU Elections Commissioner Rick
Haskell announced he will consider
changing the bylaws of the ASSU
Constitution in order to speed the
return of overseas ballots by sending
them abroad earlier than in the past.
The confirmation of election results
was delayed this week because of slow
election returns from overseas
campuses, he said.

The Senate voted 11-7 against
providing a loan to Serra House for the
purchase of a color television.
Proponents of the measure argued that
Larry Horton, associate dean of
University housing, had guaranteed the
loan, which would have been paid
back with five and one-half percent
interest.
They said it was unfair for Serra
residents to bear the cost of a
television set which would remain in
the house following their departure.
Opponents of the proposal said the
loan would set a precedent for other
residences.

Rocky Barber, chairman of the
Senate, announced a vacancy on the
nominations committee and declared
that any student interested in the
position should apply.
A proposal was submitted by
Charles Ogletree, ASSU vice president,
which called for the establishment of
the Action Research Liaison Office
(ARLO). This program would provide
an opportunity for students to
conduct research dealing with actual
problems through community
agencies. Senators will , study the
proposal during the coming week.
