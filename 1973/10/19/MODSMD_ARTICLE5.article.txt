# Whitman House Fights Intellectual Loneliness
## 
### CHRISTINE DOUGLAS 
Members of Whitman House, a new student-organized
living group, have rebelled against the intellectual
loneliness of the lecture hall and its separation from
dormitory life. Instead, they try to live and learn in a
single, unified environment.
Accordin to Bruce Bach, one of Whitman's organizers,
the house lets people "approach each other as equals, as
seekers. True education is a two-way interaction."
House residents have already organized three kinds of
activities to improve teacher-student and inter-student
communication: dinner and discussion visits by faculty
members two or three times a week; house seminars,
organized within Whitman for academic credit; and house

cultural activities.
In the three weeks since registration seven professors
have visited Whitman, including Philosophy Prof. John
Mothershead, Art Prof. Lorenz Eitner and English Prof.
John Felstiner. Topics have varied from abortion to
Utopian communities and the Chilean coup.
The visits are "a lot deeper than a secondary
lecture ... what we're talking about is sharing interests
and ideas," Bach theorizes.
"Everyone has a professor or speaker they [sic] want
to invite," according to Tom Graham, a Whitman resident.
Autumn Plans
Tentative plans for fall quarter include visits by a BBC
film director, the curator of Hoover Institution's Middle

Eastern division and Italian film director Roberto
Rossalini, and a reception for the Guaneri String Quartet.
House organizers hope to begin a guest-in-residence
program winter quarter, with week-long visits by people
outside the Stanford community. Whitman members have
already invited historian William Appleman Williams, poet
Allen Ginsberg and educational innovator Ivan Illich.
Any Stanford student may attend house lectures and
discussions, listed in a weekly newsletter distributed
through the housing office.
House Seminars
House seminars are also open to all students; almost
half the students in two current seminars do not live at
Whitman.
According to faculty resident Jim Lethcoe, seminars
are a "focal point for people getting together in the
house." During an academic year, residents must
participate in at least one quarter-long seminar.
The University has granted five units of Political
Science credit to one seminar and Undergraduate Special
status to the other two.
Heavy Workload
Students in the seminars have accepted difficult
workloads. Lethcoe, who teaches a Whitman seminar on
"Psychology and Literature," observes that his students
have demonstrated "total participation" and a "high level
of maturity. One person doesn't dominate."
Bach, a senior in biology, teaches an Undergraduate
Special on "Scientific Methodology" to 12 people,
including graduate students in communication and
physics.
Prof. Nancy Keohane leads a smaller Whitman seminar
on "Freedom and Equality," accredited by the Political
Science department.
Encouraged by its present successes, Whitman plans to
sponsor two more seminars next quarter. Students from
the house will choose subjects for, organize, and in some
cases lead discussion in the winter seminars.
For instance, Reese Newman, a senior in philosophy, is
preparing to teach a seminar on "Literature and
Alienation." Gerald Torres plans to help Political Science
Prof. Charles Drekmeier lead a seminar on "Meaning,
Intention, and Action," while Naomi Smith will help
teach a course on "Structuralism," part of the Modern
Thought and Literature program.

Whitman will also sponsor courses on "Methods and
Applications of Humanistic Psychology" and "Moral and
Religious Issues In Literature."
Informal Activities
House activities extend beyond the seminars into less
structured enterprises. Compared to the dorms, "there's a
lot more going on outside of class" at Whitman, according
to sophomore Tom Graham.
Before registration, about 25 residents camped
together in the Point Reyes National Seashore for three
days. "We had more interesting discussions on the
camping trip than we had all last year" in the dorms,
sophomore Mark Davis observed.
Last Sunday afternoon, 12 students gathered on the
floor of the Lethcoe's room to read and listen to poetry,
some composed by the readers themselves. Several people
read French, German, Spanish and Latin poems in the
original.
The house has also obtained tickets for nine American
Conservatory Theater productions and the San Francisco
Symphony season.
Creative Interior
House members keep Whitman neater and cleaner than
the three houses around it (ATO, ZAP, and Terra), and
have furnished its lounge, dining room, and hallways
creatively. A seven-foot-tall free-form painting of Walt
Whitman, reproduced from a photograph by Dave
Andrews, a house resident, dominates the lounge.
Specially-printed black-and-white photographs of the
Sierra Nevada, by Robert Duryea, line the walls of the
dining room and lounge. Scale drawings of three
"ecosystems," designed by house member Harry
Chandler, hang in the second floor hallway.
To coordinate activities and plan for the future,
Whitman's original seven-member steering committee has
divided its responsibilities among six other committees.
Decision Making
The steering committee tried to "involve everyone in
decision-making somewhere along the line" with the
committee system, Lethcoe said. House organizers head
four of the six committees, easing Whitman's transition
from one center of responsibility to six.
The recreation, food and menus, academic, and special
events committees plan house activities, while the

languages.
grievances and evaluation committees handle immediate
and long-range problems, respectively.
This fall, some members disagreed over standards for
admission to the house.
One person on the waiting list complained that
organizer Bach passed over students at the top of the list
to let his friends in. At a house meeting during the second
week of the quarter, residents decided to rely without
discretion on the waiting list, and the controversy died.
The evaluation committee is now trying to create a
"new selection procedure that avoids favoritism" and

avoids confusion and bitterness, according to its leader,
Reese Newman.
Lethcoe, who in Whitman's unstructured
administration learned of the problem only when the
house meeting was called, observed that "people didn't
want to operate according to hard and fast rules, and they
learned that if you don't, someone is always unhappy."
The evaluation committee will also try to decide
Whitman's role in Stanford's educational system, either as
"an aid or a real alternative to the University," in
Newman's words.
