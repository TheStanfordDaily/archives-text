# Restore Freedom In Chile
## Encourage Respect Of Human Rights 
### 
The majority of the Stanford
Community has spoken out
against the brutal fascist coup in
Chile. In two recent opinions in
the Daily, however, this group was
accused of hypocricy and selective
meddling. What is the position of
those, who oppose the Chilean
Military Junta?
First, we demand that the U.S.
in no way intervene in support of
the Chilean Military Junta. We
demand that the U.S. provide no
economic nor military assistance
to the rightist dictatorship. Such
support would only sustain
military actions to suppress
dissent in Chile. We are thus
opposed to any form of U.S.
intervention in the internal
struggle in Chile.
At the level of international
law, however, the U.S. should
support the reestablishment of
basic human rights and, as every
nation is obliged to, should use
every possible means, short of
direct intervention, to encourage
the junta to respect these basic
human rights: specifically the
right of political exiles to be
deported only to countries where
they will not be subject to
immediate execution. Moreover,
the U.S. should open its borders
to the thousands of persons who
are being persecuted for their
political beliefs.
Finally, we demand that the
massive violations of human rights
in Chile be publicized, that
freedom of expression and
information be respected, and
that the pressures of international
public opinion be exercised on
behalf of those currently being
persecuted and summarily
executed.
There is little doubt that those
who oppose these demands and
speak in favour of the coup are in
fact encouraging the
extermination of an entire sector
of the Chilean people. It must not
be forgotten that under Allende in
no circumstance were opponents
of the UP ever exterminated or
even imprisoned for their political
beliefs.
No Preservation
The principal argument of
those who wrote in support of the
coup was a total non sequitur: in
order to "preserve democracy"
the military needed first to
destroy that democracy; to
outlaw all leftist political parties
and to suspend the activities of
the liberal and conservative
parties; to outlaw the trade union
organizations; to throw out every
locally elected mayor and install a
military appointee; to remove
every university president in favor

of a military administrator.
The crucial question definitely
is "What caused the downfall of a
popularly elected government,
and why was it met with so little
obvious opposition from the
Chilean people?" The answer to
the first part of the question can
be summed up by the original
"ITT plan": Create economic
chaos to such an extent that the
military is finally forced into
intervention.
Brutality
The answer to the second part
of the question is also very
simple: through tremendous
brutality, undiscriminating
suppression, and an enormous
over-kill the military effectively
eliminated any kind of open
resistance. (Conservative estimates
inside Santiago spoke of 20,000
people killed within the first few
days after the coup, and
Newsweek of Oct. 8 reported
2,796 bodies in one of the
Santiago morgues alone.)
It seems necessary to say a few
more words on how the economic

chaos was created. First of all, the
U.S. economic blockade, which
coincided with a fall in the price
of copper (Chile's main export)
and a rise in the prices of
foodstuff (one of Chile's main
imports), led to a shortage of
foreign exchange with extremely
damaging effects on Chile's
dependent economy.
The Oct. 1972 and July to
Sept. 1973 workstops of the
truckowners paralyzed the
economy and accounted for many
of the commodity shortages that
developed particularly in 1973.
These workstops started out with
an economic motivation,
primarily based on the
unavailability of spare parts,
which in turn was due to the lack
of foreign exchange.
But after the government met
all economic demands of the
truckowners the political
motivation of these workstops
became obvious. In the end the
truckowners openly demanded
the resignation of Allende and his
government before they would

Christiansen & Girling

return to work. In Chile it was
generally known (and even
publicized by a Christian
Democratic Senator) that the CIA
was financially supporting these
workstops. The allegations that
Allende attempted to nationalize
the transportation system and
that the transportation workers
went on strike are totally
unfounded, and only due to the
distorted news reporting in the
U.S. establishment press.
To argue, as one of the Daily
opinions recently did, that the
quality of Chilean medical care
decreased because communists
were put in charge of hospitals
and health care, reflects the
utterly simplistic reasoning of the
cold-war period. It is clear that a
popular front government has
different ideas about medical care
than the ruling class. Therefore,
there was a considerable attempt
in Chile during the past three
years to increase the quality and
quantity of the medical care in
the countryside and for the
working class.
The shortages in the supply of
certain imported medical
equipment that did exist were due
to the lack of foreign exchange.
These are the underlying reasons
rather than the alleged stupidity
of communists.
How then, did the coup come
about and why was it met with so
little obvious resistance? In the
March 1973 by-elections for the
first time in Chilean history the
incumbent President Allende
actually increased his electoral
support (Allende won 36 percent
of the votes in 1970, the leftist
coalition of the UP won 44
percent in March 1973). The
Right clearly realized that it
would not be able to regain power
through the electoral process.
The extreme neo-Nazi
organization "Patria y Libertad"
stepped up its terrorist acts. And
the Right in general increased its
pressure upon the military to take
power through a military coup.
These actions finally led to the
resignation of the
commander-in-chief of the army,
General Carlos Prats, who had
tried to keep the army out of the
political battle. His resignation
cleared the way for the coup and
the brutal elimination of
democracy.
Why is it that the workers now
report faithfully to the factories
each day? The answer is very
simple. If they don't, they will be
shot. It is now a crime to be idle.
And it is a crime to strike. The
military has raided most of the
poblaciones, in which the workers
live, and it has actually leveled
some shanty towns. Through
continuing extensive and brutal
repression, and continuing
undiscriminating executions it has
created such fear that what is
remarkable is not the lack of
opposition, but rather its
continuing existence.

the resignation of Allende and his
government before they would

Christiansen & Girling

return to work. In Chile it was
generally known (and even
publicized by a Christian
Democratic Senator) that the CIA
was financially supporting these
workstops. The allegations that
Allende attempted to nationalize
the transportation system and
that the transportation workers
went on strike are totally
unfounded, and only due to the
distorted news reporting in the
U.S. establishment press.
To argue, as one of the Daily
opinions recently did, that the
quality of Chilean medical care
decreased because communists
were put in charge of hospitals
and health care, reflects the
utterly simplistic reasoning of the
cold-war period. It is clear that a
popular front government has
different ideas about medical care
than the ruling class. Therefore,
there was a considerable attempt
in Chile during the past three
years to increase the quality and
quantity of the medical care in
the countryside and for the
working class.
The shortages in the supply of
certain imported medical
equipment that did exist were due
to the lack of foreign exchange.
These are the underlying reasons
rather than the alleged stupidity
of communists.
How then, did the coup come
about and why was it met with so
little obvious resistance? In the
March 1973 by-elections for the
first time in Chilean history the
incumbent President Allende
actually increased his electoral
support (Allende won 36 percent
of the votes in 1970, the leftist
coalition of the UP won 44
percent in March 1973). The
Right clearly realized that it
would not be able to regain power
through the electoral process.
The extreme neo-Nazi
organization "Patria y Libertad"
stepped up its terrorist acts. And
the Right in general increased its
pressure upon the military to take
power through a military coup.
These actions finally led to the
resignation of the
commander-in-chief of the army,
General Carlos Prats, who had
tried to keep the army out of the
political battle. His resignation
cleared the way for the coup and
the brutal elimination of
democracy.
Why is it that the workers now
report faithfully to the factories
each day? The answer is very
simple. If they don't, they will be
shot. It is now a crime to be idle.
And it is a crime to strike. The
military has raided most of the
poblaciones, in which the workers
live, and it has actually leveled
some shanty towns. Through
continuing extensive and brutal
repression, and continuing
undiscriminating executions it has
created such fear that what is
remarkable is not the lack of
opposition, but rather its
continuing existence.

'HALF!!'
The majority of the Stanford
Community has spoken out
against the brutal fascist coup in
Chile. In two recent opinions in
the Daily, however, this group was
accused of hypocricy and selective
meddling. What is the position of
those, who oppose the Chilean
Military Junta?
First, we demand that the U.S.
in no way intervene in support of
the Chilean Military Junta. We
demand that the U.S. provide no
economic nor military assistance
to the rightist dictatorship. Such
support would only sustain
military actions to suppress
dissent in Chile. We are thus
opposed to any form of U.S.
intervention in the internal
struggle in Chile.
At the level of international
law, however, the U.S. should
support the reestablishment of
basic human rights and, as every
nation is obliged to, should use
every possible means, short of
direct intervention, to encourage
the junta to respect these basic
human rights: specifically the
right of political exiles to be
deported only to countries where
they will not be subject to
immediate execution. Moreover,
the U.S. should open its borders
to the thousands of persons who
are being persecuted for their
political beliefs.
Finally, we demand that the
massive violations of human rights
in Chile be publicized, that
freedom of expression and
information be respected, and
that the pressures of international
public opinion be exercised on
behalf of those currently being
persecuted and summarily
executed.
There is little doubt that those
who oppose these demands and
speak in favour of the coup are in
fact encouraging the
extermination of an entire sector
of the Chilean people. It must not
be forgotten that under Allende in
no circumstance were opponents
of the UP ever exterminated or
even imprisoned for their political
beliefs.
No Preservation
The principal argument of
those who wrote in support of the
coup was a total non sequitur: in
order to "preserve democracy"
the military needed first to
destroy that democracy; to
outlaw all leftist political parties
and to suspend the activities of
the liberal and conservative
parties; to outlaw the trade union
organizations; to throw out every
locally elected mayor and install a
military appointee; to remove
every university president in favor

of a military administrator.
The crucial question definitely
is "What caused the downfall of a
popularly elected government,
and why was it met with so little
obvious opposition from the
Chilean people?" The answer to
the first part of the question can
be summed up by the original
"ITT plan": Create economic
chaos to such an extent that the
military is finally forced into
intervention.
Brutality
The answer to the second part
of the question is also very
simple: through tremendous
brutality, undiscriminating
suppression, and an enormous
over-kill the military effectively
eliminated any kind of open
resistance. (Conservative estimates
inside Santiago spoke of 20,000
people killed within the first few
days after the coup, and
Newsweek of Oct. 8 reported
2,796 bodies in one of the
Santiago morgues alone.)
It seems necessary to say a few
more words on how the economic

chaos was created. First of all, the
U.S. economic blockade, which
coincided with a fall in the price
of copper (Chile's main export)
and a rise in the prices of
foodstuff (one of Chile's main
imports), led to a shortage of
foreign exchange with extremely
damaging effects on Chile's
dependent economy.
The Oct. 1972 and July to
Sept. 1973 workstops of the
truckowners paralyzed the
economy and accounted for many
of the commodity shortages that
developed particularly in 1973.
These workstops started out with
an economic motivation,
primarily based on the
unavailability of spare parts,
which in turn was due to the lack
of foreign exchange.
But after the government met
all economic demands of the
truckowners the political
motivation of these workstops
became obvious. In the end the
truckowners openly demanded
the resignation of Allende and his
government before they would

are being persecuted for their
political beliefs.
Finally, we demand that the
massive violations of human rights
in Chile be publicized, that
freedom of expression and
information be respected, and
that the pressures of international
public opinion be exercised on
behalf of those currently being
persecuted and summarily
executed.
There is little doubt that those
who oppose these demands and
speak in favour of the coup are in
fact encouraging the
extermination of an entire sector
of the Chilean people. It must not
be forgotten that under Allende in
no circumstance were opponents
of the UP ever exterminated or
even imprisoned for their political
beliefs.
No Preservation
The principal argument of
those who wrote in support of the
coup was a total non sequitur: in
order to "preserve democracy"
the military needed first to
destroy that democracy; to
outlaw all leftist political parties
and to suspend the activities of
the liberal and conservative
parties; to outlaw the trade union
organizations; to throw out every
locally elected mayor and install a
military appointee; to remove
every university president in favor

of a military administrator.
The crucial question definitely
is "What caused the downfall of a
popularly elected government,
and why was it met with so little
obvious opposition from the
Chilean people?" The answer to
the first part of the question can
be summed up by the original
"ITT plan": Create economic
chaos to such an extent that the
military is finally forced into
intervention.
Brutality
The answer to the second part
of the question is also very
simple: through tremendous
brutality, undiscriminating
suppression, and an enormous
over-kill the military effectively
eliminated any kind of open
resistance. (Conservative estimates
inside Santiago spoke of 20,000
people killed within the first few
days after the coup, and
Newsweek of Oct. 8 reported
2,796 bodies in one of the
Santiago morgues alone.)
It seems necessary to say a few
more words on how the economic

chaos was created. First of all, the
U.S. economic blockade, which
coincided with a fall in the price
of copper (Chile's main export)
and a rise in the prices of
foodstuff (one of Chile's main
imports), led to a shortage of
foreign exchange with extremely
damaging effects on Chile's
dependent economy.
The Oct. 1972 and July to
Sept. 1973 workstops of the
truckowners paralyzed the
economy and accounted for many
of the commodity shortages that
developed particularly in 1973.
These workstops started out with
an economic motivation,
primarily based on the
unavailability of spare parts,
which in turn was due to the lack
of foreign exchange.
But after the government met
all economic demands of the
truckowners the political
motivation of these workstops
became obvious. In the end the
truckowners openly demanded
the resignation of Allende and his
government before they would

Christiansen & Girling

return to work. In Chile it was
generally known (and even
publicized by a Christian
Democratic Senator) that the CIA
was financially supporting these
workstops. The allegations that
Allende attempted to nationalize
the transportation system and
that the transportation workers
went on strike are totally
unfounded, and only due to the
distorted news reporting in the
U.S. establishment press.
To argue, as one of the Daily
opinions recently did, that the
quality of Chilean medical care
decreased because communists
were put in charge of hospitals
and health care, reflects the
utterly simplistic reasoning of the
cold-war period. It is clear that a
popular front government has
different ideas about medical care
than the ruling class. Therefore,
there was a considerable attempt
in Chile during the past three
years to increase the quality and
quantity of the medical care in
the countryside and for the
working class.
The shortages in the supply of
certain imported medical
equipment that did exist were due
to the lack of foreign exchange.
These are the underlying reasons
rather than the alleged stupidity
of communists.
How then, did the coup come
about and why was it met with so
little obvious resistance? In the
March 1973 by-elections for the
first time in Chilean history the
incumbent President Allende
actually increased his electoral
support (Allende won 36 percent
of the votes in 1970, the leftist
coalition of the UP won 44
percent in March 1973). The
Right clearly realized that it
would not be able to regain power
through the electoral process.
The extreme neo-Nazi
organization "Patria y Libertad"
stepped up its terrorist acts. And
the Right in general increased its
pressure upon the military to take
power through a military coup.
These actions finally led to the
resignation of the
commander-in-chief of the army,
General Carlos Prats, who had
tried to keep the army out of the
political battle. His resignation
cleared the way for the coup and
the brutal elimination of
democracy.
Why is it that the workers now
report faithfully to the factories
each day? The answer is very
simple. If they don't, they will be
shot. It is now a crime to be idle.
And it is a crime to strike. The
military has raided most of the
poblaciones, in which the workers
live, and it has actually leveled
some shanty towns. Through
continuing extensive and brutal
repression, and continuing
undiscriminating executions it has
created such fear that what is
remarkable is not the lack of
opposition, but rather its
continuing existence.

'HALF!!'
The majority of the Stanford
Community has spoken out
against the brutal fascist coup in
Chile. In two recent opinions in
the Daily, however, this group was
accused of hypocricy and selective
meddling. What is the position of
those, who oppose the Chilean
Military Junta?
First, we demand that the U.S.
in no way intervene in support of
the Chilean Military Junta. We
demand that the U.S. provide no
economic nor military assistance
to the rightist dictatorship. Such
support would only sustain
military actions to suppress
dissent in Chile. We are thus
opposed to any form of U.S.
intervention in the internal
struggle in Chile.
At the level of international
law, however, the U.S. should
support the reestablishment of
basic human rights and, as every
nation is obliged to, should use
every possible means, short of
direct intervention, to encourage
the junta to respect these basic
human rights: specifically the
right of political exiles to be
deported only to countries where
they will not be subject to
immediate execution. Moreover,
the U.S. should open its borders
to the thousands of persons who
are being persecuted for their
political beliefs.
Finally, we demand that the
massive violations of human rights
in Chile be publicized, that
freedom of expression and

How then, did the coup come
about and why was it met with so
little obvious resistance? In the
March 1973 by-elections for the
first time in Chilean history the
incumbent President Allende
actually increased his electoral
support (Allende won 36 percent
of the votes in 1970, the leftist
coalition of the UP won 44
percent in March 1973). The
Right clearly realized that it
would not be able to regain power
through the electoral process.
The extreme neo-Nazi
organization "Patria y Libertad"
stepped up its terrorist acts. And
the Right in general increased its
pressure upon the military to take
power through a military coup.
These actions finally led to the
resignation of the
commander-in-chief of the army,
General Carlos Prats, who had
tried to keep the army out of the
political battle. His resignation
cleared the way for the coup and
the brutal elimination of
democracy.
Why is it that the workers now
report faithfully to the factories
each day? The answer is very
simple. If they don't, they will be
shot. It is now a crime to be idle.
And it is a crime to strike. The
military has raided most of the
poblaciones, in which the workers
live, and it has actually leveled
some shanty towns. Through
continuing extensive and brutal
repression, and continuing
undiscriminating executions it has
created such fear that what is
remarkable is not the lack of
opposition, but rather its
continuing existence.
