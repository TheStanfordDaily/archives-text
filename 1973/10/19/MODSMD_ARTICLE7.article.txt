# Mideast Troubles
## Accuracy Needed 
### 
The level of discussion of the
Middle East situation encountered
on this campus and exemplified in
the editorials and letters in the
Daily is clear indication of the
need for a Middle East Studies
Program here.
The true history of this region
is so complex as to confuse and
discourage the serious scholar. Yet
one positive result emerges from
that study — a profound
sympathy for Arabs and Israelis
alike and a profound respect for
the contribution of both of these
great cultures to international
civilization.
This perspective is tragically
lacking in the racial and ethnic
slander and historical inaccuracies
being dredged up by both sides to
bolster their support on this
campus. Emotional appeals of the
lowest sort have no place in a
community dedicated to the
pursuit of truth and justice. In
particular I cite the Israeli rally
last week in White Plaza.
As examples of the
inaccuracies bandied about in the
Daily allow me to cite:
Andrew Leuchter:
"Arab interest in Palestinian

land did not develop until the
19205" — Did the Arabs ever
abandon Palestine over the
hundreds of years of foreign
domination?
"This immigration was no
intrusion, it was a homecoming."
— Does this imply that every
voluntary immigration of peoples
is reversable regardless of the
political and social rights of those
who remain behind or come
afterwards to the area?
"Economically and socially
unsophisticated, and light-years
behind the Zionists. ..." —
Historically, Zionism as a political
movement and Arab Nationalism
first surfaced among intellectuals
in the last half of the nineteenth
century. The entire history of the
Arab Empires is blythely ignored
in this passage as well.
Jeffrey Greenwald:
"It was only 30 years ago that
over six million Jews were
exterminated" — Should the
ghastly tragedy of Nazi Germany
be compensated by the colonized,
and underdeveloped Palestinians?
"War for Israel is her fight for
existence and her reaction to a
world that is unreconstructedly
anti-semitic...." — Anti-semitism
can hardly determine one's
position on this struggle between
Semitic Jews and Semitic Arabs.
To raise the spector of
Anti-Semitism can only confuse
the issues and introduce the worst
motives of men, racial and ethnic
prejudice. (The battle being waged
at present inside Syria and inside
Egypt has not from its beginning
and does not appear to threaten
Israel itself. Rather it threatens
Israel's objective of annexing and
developing the occupied
territories as expressed in the
Labour party platform passed in
their party congress last month.)
"The Arabs have never
suffered. ..." — I recommend a
visit to a Palestinian refugee camp.
I also ask Mr. Greenwald whether
he feels that his standard of living
is inferior to that of most Arabs.
The cause of world peace and
justice is ill served by intellectuals
who pander to the worst motives
of men and freely manipulate
events to suit their own purposes.
We must all regret that a
historic opportunity for the
establishment of peace in this area
following the '67 War was missed.
