# Perils Of Mediocrity
## Stanford Smothers Smoodla 
### 
Norman Smoodla is
transferring.
An era is passing.
Somehow nothing will be the
same without Norman's
improvised face gracing the ring of
conversation around the dinner
table. It is not Norman's
uniqueness which will be missed,
but rather his extraordinary
mediocrity. Norman was the sort
°112 guy you pass every day on your
way to class without seeing. He is
one of the black faceless
umbrellas which pick their way
through puddles every winter.
Norman is average.
He also boarders on paranoia.
Attention must be paid.
You see, Norman is convinced
that the University is out to get
him.
Norman thinks President
Lyman has his name, written in
pencil, tacked on his wall.
The history of Norman's
delusions begins with his freshman
year and culminates in this year's
registration ceremony.
High School
Norman was a Very Important
Person in high school.
Unfortunately no one told the
freshman orientation staff this
crucial piece of information and
as a consequence his baggage was
color coded v/ith the wrong dorm
color and eventually ended up at
Berkeley where sundry indignities
were committed upon it when its
Stanford origins were discovered.
Norman also couldn't get any
books for the first half of the
quarter. This is mainly because he
was lost for two days the first
time he tried to find the
bookstore, and then spent
another three days in Cowell after
getting caught in a Stanford
T-Shirt Clearance sale in the
Bookstore. This constituted
freshman orientation.
Norman spent the first few
days of the quarter in lines. First
he spent two hours in line waiting
to open an account at the bank.
He then spent three hours getting
the remnants of the required
books for his classes, and two
hours returning his books when he
suddenly discovered he didn't
want to go to Med School (this
occurred when reviewing his notes
for the second lecture of Chem.
31).

Ail of this is nothing unusual.
Norman did not feel himself
signaled out as fate's special
plaything. The events of his
freshman year only formed a
pattern as he looked back.
In his first housing draw,
Norman was assigned to a house
that didn't exist. As it later turned
out it did exist, which is a another
whole story.
In the course of his sophomore
year Norman switched majors three
times. However, no matter what
he did, he was designated as a
biology major on his transcript.
Norman never received his second
quarter grades. He received a B in
a P.E. course he never attended.
The computer steadfastly refused
to acknowledge the difference
between his hypothetical advance
registration program and the real
schedule which developed during
the quarter. This resulted in a
succession of incompletes.
During the summer he drew a
draft number of 19. This was
shortly after the termination of
student deferments.
Bike Troubles
He bought an old bike so it
wouldn't be attractive to thieves,
which was immediately stolen. He
then bought a new bike which was
promptly stolen by the police and
held for a one dollar ransom.
Shortly after retrieving his new
bike he ran into a motorcycle
which was stopped at a crosswalk.
Norman and his bike were quickly
parted. According to Norman's
own account, as he lay on the
asphalt attempting to start
breathing again his principle
concern was whether or not he
would still be able to get a seat in
biology.
This incident added
considerably to Norman's
insecurity since his friends
laughed continuously at him for
three days after he told them he
had broken his bike by running
into a parked motorcycle.
In Norman's second experience
with the housing draw he drew
number 6,081 and was placed in a
dorm at Cal. (He managed to get
on campus by rooming in the
broom closet of a fraternity.)
Academic Probation
Over the next summer Norman
received a notice that he was
being placed on academic

Pete Alethire

probation, and a $16 bill for his
room key which he had turned in.
He also received a form letter
asking alumni for contributions to
Stanford.
But still, Norman maintained a
positive attitude. Whatever may
be said about Norman Smoodla,
he is not a quitter.
However, this year he finally
reached the end of this time
schedule. Being an old hand,
Smoodla felt no qualms when he
first entered Maples for
registration. He promptly fell into
line under the card marked
"Tuition, Board, Room,
deferments, loans." After half an
hour he reached the front of the
line.
He discovered the bill this year
was over $1,500. Since Norman
only brought $1,500, as was his
custom, he was forced to defer
payments.
He was directed to the defer
payment desk.
Enough Is Enough!
An hour later, armed with his
deferment form, Norman was
again ready to pay. However, he
then noticed he was being charged
a $23 new student fee. Since he
was not a new student he
protested.
He was directed to the new
student fee correction desk.
An hour and a half later he
paid his fee.
He went to the final step desk.
They asked him if he was a
freshman. He told them he wasn't.
Hiey said he must be, and pointed
to a box on his permit to register
which contained the letters; frosh.
Norman had a horrible vision
of the last three years being
played back. He saw his life as a
home movie. In that moment,
Norman was a broken man. He
wandered from Maples with
bewildered tears standing silently
in his eyes.
Norman is packed now, and
ready to leave.
He wants to go to San Jose
State because he likes their
football team.
I don't have the heart to tell
him that at San Jose State they
wait overnight in line to register,
as if Rose Bowl tickets were on
sale.

was lost for two days the first
time he tried to find the
bookstore, and then spent
another three days in Cowell after
getting caught in a Stanford
T-Shirt Clearance sale in the
Bookstore. This constituted
freshman orientation.
Norman spent the first few
days of the quarter in lines. First
he spent two hours in line waiting
to open an account at the bank.
He then spent three hours getting
the remnants of the required
books for his classes, and two
hours returning his books when he
suddenly discovered he didn't
want to go to Med School (this
occurred when reviewing his notes
for the second lecture of Chem.
31).

Ail of this is nothing unusual.
Norman did not feel himself
signaled out as fate's special
plaything. The events of his
freshman year only formed a
pattern as he looked back.
In his first housing draw,
Norman was assigned to a house
that didn't exist. As it later turned
out it did exist, which is a another
whole story.
In the course of his sophomore
year Norman switched majors three
times. However, no matter what
he did, he was designated as a
biology major on his transcript.
Norman never received his second
quarter grades. He received a B in
a P.E. course he never attended.
The computer steadfastly refused
to acknowledge the difference
between his hypothetical advance
registration program and the real
schedule which developed during
the quarter. This resulted in a
succession of incompletes.
During the summer he drew a
draft number of 19. This was
shortly after the termination of
student deferments.
Bike Troubles
He bought an old bike so it
wouldn't be attractive to thieves,
which was immediately stolen. He
then bought a new bike which was
promptly stolen by the police and
held for a one dollar ransom.
Shortly after retrieving his new
bike he ran into a motorcycle
which was stopped at a crosswalk.
Norman and his bike were quickly
parted. According to Norman's
own account, as he lay on the
asphalt attempting to start
breathing again his principle
concern was whether or not he
would still be able to get a seat in
biology.
This incident added
considerably to Norman's
insecurity since his friends
laughed continuously at him for
three days after he told them he
had broken his bike by running
into a parked motorcycle.
In Norman's second experience
with the housing draw he drew
number 6,081 and was placed in a
dorm at Cal. (He managed to get
on campus by rooming in the
broom closet of a fraternity.)
Academic Probation
Over the next summer Norman
received a notice that he was
being placed on academic

Pete Alethire

probation, and a $16 bill for his
room key which he had turned in.
He also received a form letter
asking alumni for contributions to
Stanford.
But still, Norman maintained a
positive attitude. Whatever may
be said about Norman Smoodla,
he is not a quitter.
However, this year he finally
reached the end of this time
schedule. Being an old hand,
Smoodla felt no qualms when he
first entered Maples for
registration. He promptly fell into
line under the card marked
"Tuition, Board, Room,
deferments, loans." After half an
hour he reached the front of the
line.
He discovered the bill this year
was over $1,500. Since Norman
only brought $1,500, as was his
custom, he was forced to defer
payments.
He was directed to the defer
payment desk.
Enough Is Enough!
An hour later, armed with his
deferment form, Norman was
again ready to pay. However, he
then noticed he was being charged
a $23 new student fee. Since he
was not a new student he
protested.
He was directed to the new
student fee correction desk.
An hour and a half later he
paid his fee.
He went to the final step desk.
They asked him if he was a
freshman. He told them he wasn't.
Hiey said he must be, and pointed
to a box on his permit to register
which contained the letters; frosh.
Norman had a horrible vision
of the last three years being
played back. He saw his life as a
home movie. In that moment,
Norman was a broken man. He
wandered from Maples with
bewildered tears standing silently
in his eyes.
Norman is packed now, and
ready to leave.
He wants to go to San Jose
State because he likes their
football team.
I don't have the heart to tell
him that at San Jose State they
wait overnight in line to register,
as if Rose Bowl tickets were on
sale.
(Pete Aleshire is a regular Daily
columnist.)
Norman Smoodla is
transferring.
An era is passing.
Somehow nothing will be the
same without Norman's
improvised face gracing the ring of
conversation around the dinner
table. It is not Norman's
uniqueness which will be missed,
but rather his extraordinary
mediocrity. Norman was the sort
°112 guy you pass every day on your
way to class without seeing. He is
one of the black faceless
umbrellas which pick their way
through puddles every winter.
Norman is average.
He also boarders on paranoia.
Attention must be paid.
You see, Norman is convinced
that the University is out to get
him.
Norman thinks President
Lyman has his name, written in
pencil, tacked on his wall.
The history of Norman's
delusions begins with his freshman
year and culminates in this year's
registration ceremony.
High School
Norman was a Very Important
Person in high school.
Unfortunately no one told the
freshman orientation staff this
crucial piece of information and
as a consequence his baggage was
color coded v/ith the wrong dorm
color and eventually ended up at
Berkeley where sundry indignities
were committed upon it when its
Stanford origins were discovered.
Norman also couldn't get any
books for the first half of the
quarter. This is mainly because he
was lost for two days the first

between his hypothetical advance
registration program and the real
schedule which developed during
the quarter. This resulted in a
succession of incompletes.
During the summer he drew a
draft number of 19. This was
shortly after the termination of
student deferments.
Bike Troubles
He bought an old bike so it
wouldn't be attractive to thieves,
which was immediately stolen. He
then bought a new bike which was
promptly stolen by the police and
held for a one dollar ransom.
Shortly after retrieving his new
bike he ran into a motorcycle
which was stopped at a crosswalk.
Norman and his bike were quickly
parted. According to Norman's
own account, as he lay on the
asphalt attempting to start
breathing again his principle
concern was whether or not he
would still be able to get a seat in
biology.
This incident added
considerably to Norman's
insecurity since his friends
laughed continuously at him for
three days after he told them he
had broken his bike by running
into a parked motorcycle.
In Norman's second experience
with the housing draw he drew
number 6,081 and was placed in a
dorm at Cal. (He managed to get
on campus by rooming in the
broom closet of a fraternity.)
Academic Probation
Over the next summer Norman
received a notice that he was
being placed on academic

Pete Alethire

probation, and a $16 bill for his
room key which he had turned in.
He also received a form letter
asking alumni for contributions to
Stanford.
But still, Norman maintained a
positive attitude. Whatever may
be said about Norman Smoodla,
he is not a quitter.
However, this year he finally
reached the end of this time
schedule. Being an old hand,
Smoodla felt no qualms when he
first entered Maples for
registration. He promptly fell into
line under the card marked
"Tuition, Board, Room,
deferments, loans." After half an
hour he reached the front of the
line.
He discovered the bill this year
was over $1,500. Since Norman
only brought $1,500, as was his
custom, he was forced to defer
payments.
He was directed to the defer
payment desk.
Enough Is Enough!
An hour later, armed with his
deferment form, Norman was
again ready to pay. However, he
then noticed he was being charged
a $23 new student fee. Since he
was not a new student he
protested.
He was directed to the new
student fee correction desk.
An hour and a half later he
paid his fee.
He went to the final step desk.
They asked him if he was a
freshman. He told them he wasn't.
Hiey said he must be, and pointed
to a box on his permit to register
which contained the letters; frosh.
Norman had a horrible vision
of the last three years being
played back. He saw his life as a
home movie. In that moment,
Norman was a broken man. He
wandered from Maples with
bewildered tears standing silently
in his eyes.
Norman is packed now, and
ready to leave.
He wants to go to San Jose
State because he likes their
football team.
I don't have the heart to tell
him that at San Jose State they
wait overnight in line to register,
as if Rose Bowl tickets were on
sale.
(Pete Aleshire is a regular Daily
columnist.)
Norman Smoodla is
transferring.
An era is passing.
Somehow nothing will be the
same without Norman's
improvised face gracing the ring of
conversation around the dinner
table. It is not Norman's
uniqueness which will be missed,
but rather his extraordinary
mediocrity. Norman was the sort
°112 guy you pass every day on your
way to class without seeing. He is
one of the black faceless
umbrellas which pick their way
through puddles every winter.
Norman is average.
He also boarders on paranoia.
Attention must be paid.
You see, Norman is convinced
that the University is out to get
him.
Norman thinks President
Lyman has his name, written in
pencil, tacked on his wall.
The history of Norman's
delusions begins with his freshman
year and culminates in this year's
registration ceremony.
High School
Norman was a Very Important
Person in high school.
Unfortunately no one told the
freshman orientation staff this
crucial piece of information and
as a consequence his baggage was
color coded v/ith the wrong dorm
color and eventually ended up at
Berkeley where sundry indignities
were committed upon it when its
Stanford origins were discovered.
Norman also couldn't get any
books for the first half of the
quarter. This is mainly because he
was lost for two days the first
time he tried to find the
bookstore, and then spent
another three days in Cowell after
getting caught in a Stanford
T-Shirt Clearance sale in the
Bookstore. This constituted
freshman orientation.
Norman spent the first few
days of the quarter in lines. First
he spent two hours in line waiting
to open an account at the bank.
He then spent three hours getting
the remnants of the required
books for his classes, and two
hours returning his books when he
suddenly discovered he didn't
want to go to Med School (this
occurred when reviewing his notes
for the second lecture of Chem.
31).

Ail of this is nothing unusual.
Norman did not feel himself
signaled out as fate's special
plaything. The events of his
freshman year only formed a
pattern as he looked back.
In his first housing draw,
Norman was assigned to a house
that didn't exist. As it later turned
out it did exist, which is a another
whole story.
In the course of his sophomore
year Norman switched majors three
times. However, no matter what
he did, he was designated as a
biology major on his transcript.
Norman never received his second
quarter grades. He received a B in
a P.E. course he never attended.
The computer steadfastly refused
to acknowledge the difference
between his hypothetical advance
registration program and the real
schedule which developed during
the quarter. This resulted in a
