From The Associated Press
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. - The
United Nations Security Council last
night approved a stand-still cease-fire
in the Arab-Israeli war to take effect
today. Both Israel and Egypt indicated
they would abide by the resolution.
The resolution, presented jointly by
the U.S. and the Soviet Union, passed
by a 14-0 vote. China abstained on the
grounds that the resolution was being
imposed on the council by the
superpowers.
The resolution calls for an in-place
cease-fire at 12:52 p.m. EDT today
(9:52 a.m. PDT), 12 hours after the
resolution was passed.
The Israeli government announced
from Tel Aviv that it would observe
the resolution, but said it would insist
on an exchange of prisoners.
CBS News also reported that the
Israelis wanted to insure that the
resolution applied to Arab guerrillas as
well as to all regular troops.
No Syrian Response
There was no immediate response
to the resolution from Syria, the third
major participant in the war. However,
it was assumed at the U.N. that it
would follow Egypt's lead.
The peace plan was worked out
during intensive weekend negotiations
in Moscow between Secretary of State
Henry A. Kissinger and Soviet
Communist Party leader Leonid I.
Brezhnev.
The President asked Kissinger to
stop in Israel on his way home from
talks in Moscow on the Middle East

situation, Gerald L. Warren, deputy
White House press secretary said.
Warren released a one-sentence
statement saying Nixon asked
Kissinger to fly to Israel "in
connection with the current efforts to
end the hostilities and to hasten the
full implementation of the Security
Council resolution submitted by the
United States and the Soviet Union "
The resolution also calls on the
Arabs and Israelis to start carrying out
terms of the Nov. 22, 1967 Security
Council resolution calling for Israeli
withdrawal from occupied territory
and for Arab recognition of the Jewish
state.
A third point in the plan calls for
Arab-Israeli negotiations for a "just
and durable peace" under
"appropriate auspices." This
presumably indicates U.N.
involvement.
United States Ambassador John A.
Scali, who introduced the cease-fire
resolution along with Soviet
Ambassador Jacob Malik, said, "We
believe this is an historic moment for
the council."
Battles Continue
While the diplomats voted at the
U.N., Egypt and Israel clashed in big
tank and aerial battles along the
embattled Suez Canal.
The resolution came as Israel
claimed it held 300 square miles of
Syrian territory and that it had taken a
19-mile by 25-mile section of Egyptian
land west of the Suez.
In the Sinai fighting, Egypt

apparently tried to cut off and trap an
Israeli armor operation on the west
bank of the Suez Canal, touching off
major battles.
On the Suez front, both sides
claimed success. An Egyptian
spokesman said the west bank
operation by the Israelis was
"completely besieged." The Israeli
command acknowledged it had come
under ground and air attacks but said
its forces pressed on in a drive over an
area 19 miles deep and 25 miles wide
on the west side of the Suez.
A Cairo military spokesman said
Egypt was knocking out three Israeli
pontoon bridges over the Suez each
time they were repaired.

A report from the Sinai by
Associated Press correspondent Hugh
A. Mulligan indicated Egyptian armor
on the east bank was assaulting the
canal doorway Israel has opened for its
thrust into Egypt.
'Great Tank Battle'
"A great tank battle is raging on the
east bank," Mulligan reported from a
captured Egyptian bunker on the west
bank after crossing the canal in a
halftrack.
"Tanks are burning all over the
place," he said. "Israeli guns on
Egypt's side of the canal are firing on
Egyptian forces deploying" on the east
bank. He said Israeli guns were "just
picking off tanks all over."

On the west bank, where U.S.
intelligence says Israel has 300 tanks
and 12,000 men, the Egyptians were
"fighting and falling back, fighting and
falling back," Mulligan said in a
telephone dispatch from a bunker
seven miles south of Ismailia.
Meanwhile, Kuwait and Qatar
became the latest Arab nations to
announce a ban on all oil shipments to
the United States, taking the action
yesterday in continued Arab
retaliation for U.S. support of Israel.
In another development, Iraq said
Sunday that Arab countries should
nationalize all U.S. economic interests
— including oil companies — which are

operating within their boundaries.
The tiny sheikdom of Bahrain also
officially announced it was cutting off
oil exports to the United States, but
oil sources in Beirut said Bahrain sends
all its daily oil production of 68,000
barrels to Europe and Japan.
Other Arab oil producers which had
already said they would stop
shipments to the United States are
Libya, Abu Dhabi, Algeria and Saudi
Arabia, the largest U.S. oil supplier in
the Arab world.
The United States received about
35 million barrels a month from the
Arab nations before the oil boycott
began. It imports about 175 million
barrels a month over-all.
