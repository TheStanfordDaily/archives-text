# Arab Leaders Ordered Migration
## Israelis Cultivated Palestinian Land 
### 
Shapiro & Braun

In response to Mr. Evers'
closely - reasoned and
well-researched article and
subsequent replies, certain points
require some clarification with
reference to the refugee issue and
the ownership of Palestinian land
in general:
(1) The land bought by the
Jewish immigrants in Palestine
was not land that was being
worked by Arab farmers. In
general, the land sold by the rich
Arab "feudal lords" was worthless
swamp or desert land, not land
that was being utilized.
For example, the entire Jezreel
Valley was empty swampland
until the Jews came along, bought
it from the "legal owners" (the
quotes are used in deference to

Mr. Evers' contention that these
wealthy Arabs were not owners
because they did not work the
land) drained the swamps, set up
the orange groves, and otherwise
made it the agricultural area it is
today. Since the land reclaimed
by the Jews had not been worked
for centuries, and since no farmer
had claimed ownership, the fact
that the Jews worked the land
made them the legal landowners
even according to Mr. Evers'
definition of land-ownership.
Refugee Dilemma
(2) In reference to the flight of
Arabs at the time of the 1948
War, the Research Group for
European Migration Problems, in
its REMP Bulletin of
January/March 1957, makes the

following points:
.. as early as the first
months of 1948 the Arab
League issued orders exhorting
the [Palestinian Arab] people
to seek temporary refuge in
neighboring countries, later to
return to their abodes in the
wake of the victorious Arab
armies and obtain their share
of the abandoned Jewish
property."
Furthermore, "On 6
September, 1948, Emile Ghoury,
Secretary of the Palestinian Arab
Higher Committee, stated in an
interview with the Beirut
Telegraph:
'The fact that there are these
refugees is the direct
consequence of the act of the
Arab States in opposing
partition and the Jewish State.
The Arab States agreed upon
this policy unanimously and
they must share in the solution
of the problem.'
The Arab Governments told us:
'Get out so that we can get in.' We
got out but they did not get in."
(3) After the War of
Independence there was much
abandoned property left by the
fleeing Palestinians. This land was
leased to the new immigrants who
came into Israel, many of whom
fled from Arab countries, leaving
behind all of their property. The
rents collected by the Israeli
Government were placed into a
special fund. This fund, which still
exists, is accompanied by a
detailed list of the Arab
landowners who abandoned the
land, what land they owned, and
how much rent is owed them.
Annexation
After the Six Day War, when
East Jerusalem was annexed, the
Jerusalem Arabs who had left land
on the western side of the city
were offered monetary
compensation by the Israeli
Government for their property.
They refused, so the Government
decided that recompensation
and/or resettlement would have to
wait and become part of a

complete peace settlement.
It is interesting to note that the
possessions abandoned by the
fleeing Jewish refugees from the
Arab countries, possessions which
were expropriated outright, would
have been enough to settle all of
the refugees in the Gaza Strip and
West Bank very comfortably. But
instead of allowing them to settle
there, refugee camps were set up.
In fact, Gaza Strip refugees were
even denied entrance into Egypt
for nineteen years, 1948-1967.
U.N. Partition
(4) As far as the creation of a
Palestinian state it should be
noted that such a state was called
for in the U.N. Partition of 1947.
And what happened to that land,
specifically allotted to the
Palestinians? It was annexed after
the War of Independence by
Jordan (the West Bank) and Egypt
(the Gaza Strip).
It is admittedly well-advised to
study the background of a
conflict to better understand the
problems that underlie it, and the
Middle East conflict is no
exception; that has been the point
of these clarifications. Ultimately,
however, the point of studying
any conflict, particularly one in
which human lives are lost, is in
the hope of resolving it.
To resolve the Middle East
conflict by throwing three million
Jews out of a land they have built
up and live in is certainly
unrealistic. To continue to allow
the refugee problem to fester is
also unrealistic. The resolution,
then, has to be one of
compromise. Israel has expressed
its willingness to compromise.
Certain Arabs also are interested
in such a course, but the majority,
particularly in Egypt and Syria,
do not appear to be interested in
this means of resolution. Until
they do, there does not seem to
be much of a chance for a realistic
resolution of the Middle East
conflict.
