Because of the diversity of
Jewish sentiment on the Middle
East crisis, I would like to clarify
my letter which appeared in the
Daily on October 16, 1973, in
'Letters to the Editor.' The
viewpoint that I explained was
not necessarily representative of
any Jewish organization or group
on campus. It was my personal
view on how I perceived the
Middle East crisis to be.

Tenure Problem
Editor:
Your recent article on "Fewer
Junior Faculty Promotions Seen"
had several surprises for me. They
mostly arise from my experiences
over the past two years as a
trustee of Stonehill College, a
small four-year private school in
the Boston area.
Mainly, I was surprised that the
tenure problem surfaces here at
such a late date. This happened a
year ago at Stonehill, and we
found at that time that many
schools had even then begun to
feel a tenure crunch. At present
there is already a surplus of young
college teachers with impressive
records at distinguished schools
that were unable to offer them
tenure after a few years and had
to dismiss them. In this light,
Dean Royden's blithe assumption
about decent jobs for people to go
to at the end of a few years'
teaching here is a surprise, too.
Another surprise is that your
account failed to raise the basic
issues which the tenure problem
suggests. Fixed appointments are
at best a stopgap measure to buy
time for some basic thinking that
is critical for the continued
development of any quality
school, large or small.
Precisely how, on the practical
level, does tenure relate to
academic freedom? What form of
job security is proper for
academicians? What
responsibilities — to students, to
the school and to society — fall to
those who enjoy a rather generous
measure of academic freedom?
Are there better and more direct
means of assuring academic
freedom for the entire faculty,
whether tenured or not?
Such questions now need to be
approached at Stanford in the
face of severe economic and
cultural restraints. Your light
treatment of these was a further
surprise to me. Rising pressures
and diminishing resources raise
questions even more basic than
those mentioned above about
tenure.
Solutions will come only from
vigorous joint efforts by students,
faculty, administrators and
alumni(ae). This is already going
on at Stanford in the key area of
evaluating and improving the
quality of teaching. Your article
points to a crying need for much
more.

Mainly, I was surprised that the
tenure problem surfaces here at
such a late date. This happened a
year ago at Stonehill, and we
found at that time that many
schools had even then begun to
feel a tenure crunch. At present
there is already a surplus of young
college teachers with impressive
records at distinguished schools
that were unable to offer them
tenure after a few years and had
to dismiss them. In this light,
Dean Royden's blithe assumption
about decent jobs for people to go
to at the end of a few years'
teaching here is a surprise, too.
Another surprise is that your
account failed to raise the basic
issues which the tenure problem
suggests. Fixed appointments are
at best a stopgap measure to buy
time for some basic thinking that
is critical for the continued
development of any quality
school, large or small.
Precisely how, on the practical
level, does tenure relate to
academic freedom? What form of
job security is proper for
academicians? What
responsibilities — to students, to
the school and to society — fall to
those who enjoy a rather generous
measure of academic freedom?
Are there better and more direct
means of assuring academic
freedom for the entire faculty,
whether tenured or not?
Such questions now need to be
approached at Stanford in the
face of severe economic and
cultural restraints. Your light
treatment of these was a further
surprise to me. Rising pressures
and diminishing resources raise
questions even more basic than
those mentioned above about
tenure.
Solutions will come only from
vigorous joint efforts by students,
faculty, administrators and
alumni(ae). This is already going
on at Stanford in the key area of
evaluating and improving the
quality of teaching. Your article
points to a crying need for much
more.

Clarification
Editor:
Because of the diversity of
Jewish sentiment on the Middle
East crisis, I would like to clarify
my letter which appeared in the
Daily on October 16, 1973, in
'Letters to the Editor.' The
viewpoint that I explained was
not necessarily representative of
any Jewish organization or group
on campus. It was my personal
view on how I perceived the
Middle East crisis to be.

Tenure Problem
Editor:
Your recent article on "Fewer
Junior Faculty Promotions Seen"
had several surprises for me. They
mostly arise from my experiences
over the past two years as a
trustee of Stonehill College, a
small four-year private school in
the Boston area.
