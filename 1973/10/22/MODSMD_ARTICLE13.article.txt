# Administration Policy Unclear
## Tenure Needs Evaluation 
### 
■Robert D. Simoni

The trend toward establishment of a more
restrictive tenure policy has been obvious for the
past few years. The substance of this trend,
however, has been difficult to evaluate due to the
lack of definitive administrative comment. It is even
more difficult since in recent times administrative
policy decisions are often preceded by trial
balloons. In the event that recent discussions in the
Daily and elsewhere have been for this purpose, I
feel obligated to respond.
The reason for restrictive tenure promotions has
often been stated as maintenance of faculty vitality
during the transition from rapid faculty growth to a
steady state situation. If vitality is taken as
combined excellence in research, teaching and
university service, the turnover of junior faculty
(regardless of mechanism) is self-defeating, ignores
the basic problem and will not yield an effective
steady state. Clearly, individuals placed in such a
situation will emphasize research productivity with
neglect of teaching and service. This seems
inconsistent with apparent attitudes toward
teaching excellence.
Competition
In addition, and more serious, is the inevitable
competition for limited departmental tenure slots
that will result. While a degree of competition may
be stimulating, an excess will destroy an essential
element of vitality, collaborative teaching and
research. The more remote the promotional
opportunities, the more severe the competition.
That such changes will occur is clearly demonstrated
by existing conditions at institutions like Harvard
and Yale.
In my case, and that of several of my colleagues,
the decision to come to Stanford was in some
measure due to tenure potential but most
importantly to the cooperative and productive
departmental atmosphere that accompanies a
reasonable promotion system. Thus it seems clear

that the proposed changes will have a profound
effect on both existing junior faculty and new
appointments. It is a most serious error to assume
that tenureless contracts will be acceptable as long
as decent jobs are available. The day of the
Harvard assistant professor" moving to a tenured
position at a first rank institution has clearly passed.
Inadequate
At a more basic level, the preoccupation with
turnover of junior faculty as a means of maintaining
vitality ignores the real problem which is simply the
inadequacy of the tenure system itself to deal with
the current situation. In the natural sciences, I
suspect that the most vital, productive period occurs
between 5 and 20 years after appointment. It takes
the initial 2-3 years to establish distinctive research
and teaching programs and arbitrary termination at
5 years is not a viable solution. The real solution
must therefore be found in a total re-evaluation of
tenure at all levels.
Possibly substitution of a graded appointment
schedule will solve some of the problems.
Reappointment for varied terms of 3, 5, 10 or 15
years would provide a mechanism with sufficient
flexibility to maximize vitality and establish a
steady state characterized by balanced input and
output at both ends of the vital years. On the more
human side, it seems no more callous to deny a
ten-year reappointment to a 55 year old professor
with waning productivity than to terminate a 30
year old assistant professor just approaching his
productive potential.
Whatever the solution, it is imperative that
current administrative policy be clearly defined. The
effect of indecision and trial balloons that portend
severe tenure restrictions will have the same effect
as the decision itself and that is not in the best
interest of this university.

output at both ends of the vital years. On the more
human side, it seems no more callous to deny a
ten-year reappointment to a 55 year old professor
with waning productivity than to terminate a 30
year old assistant professor just approaching his
productive potential.
Whatever the solution, it is imperative that
current administrative policy be clearly defined. The
effect of indecision and trial balloons that portend
severe tenure restrictions will have the same effect
as the decision itself and that is not in the best
interest of this university.

The trend toward establishment of a more
restrictive tenure policy has been obvious for the
past few years. The substance of this trend,
however, has been difficult to evaluate due to the
lack of definitive administrative comment. It is even
more difficult since in recent times administrative
policy decisions are often preceded by trial
balloons. In the event that recent discussions in the
Daily and elsewhere have been for this purpose, I
feel obligated to respond.
The reason for restrictive tenure promotions has
often been stated as maintenance of faculty vitality
during the transition from rapid faculty growth to a
steady state situation. If vitality is taken as
combined excellence in research, teaching and
university service, the turnover of junior faculty
(regardless of mechanism) is self-defeating, ignores
the basic problem and will not yield an effective
steady state. Clearly, individuals placed in such a
situation will emphasize research productivity with
neglect of teaching and service. This seems
inconsistent with apparent attitudes toward
teaching excellence.
Competition
In addition, and more serious, is the inevitable
competition for limited departmental tenure slots
that will result. While a degree of competition may
be stimulating, an excess will destroy an essential
element of vitality, collaborative teaching and
research. The more remote the promotional
opportunities, the more severe the competition.
That such changes will occur is clearly demonstrated
by existing conditions at institutions like Harvard
and Yale.
In my case, and that of several of my colleagues,
the decision to come to Stanford was in some
measure due to tenure potential but most
importantly to the cooperative and productive
departmental atmosphere that accompanies a
reasonable promotion system. Thus it seems clear

that the proposed changes will have a profound
effect on both existing junior faculty and new
appointments. It is a most serious error to assume
that tenureless contracts will be acceptable as long
as decent jobs are available. The day of the
Harvard assistant professor" moving to a tenured
position at a first rank institution has clearly passed.
Inadequate
At a more basic level, the preoccupation with
turnover of junior faculty as a means of maintaining
vitality ignores the real problem which is simply the
inadequacy of the tenure system itself to deal with
the current situation. In the natural sciences, I
suspect that the most vital, productive period occurs
between 5 and 20 years after appointment. It takes
the initial 2-3 years to establish distinctive research
and teaching programs and arbitrary termination at
5 years is not a viable solution. The real solution
must therefore be found in a total re-evaluation of
tenure at all levels.
Possibly substitution of a graded appointment
schedule will solve some of the problems.
Reappointment for varied terms of 3, 5, 10 or 15
years would provide a mechanism with sufficient
flexibility to maximize vitality and establish a
steady state characterized by balanced input and
output at both ends of the vital years. On the more
human side, it seems no more callous to deny a
ten-year reappointment to a 55 year old professor
with waning productivity than to terminate a 30
year old assistant professor just approaching his
productive potential.
