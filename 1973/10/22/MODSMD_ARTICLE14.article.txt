# UC Threatened By Prop. One?
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -
Passage of Gov. Ronald Reagan's
controversial tax control plan
could mean up to a $500 a year
increase in tuition charges at the
University of California, UC
President Charles Hitch said
Friday.
But with Reagan listening
impassively, Hitch told UC regents
the plan is so complex it is hard to
estimate exactly what it will mean
to the university.
UC regents declined Friday to
take a stand either for or against
the tax plan, which goes before
voters Nov. 6 as Prop. 1.
On a split voice vote, the board
approved a motion from Regent
Elinor Heller to table the issue
until the regents' November
meeting — which takes place after
the election.
No Interference
Reagan said he favored keeping
the board out of the Prop. 1 issue.
"My only concern was that the
regents not take part in
politicizing the university. We've
had enough of that in the past,"
Reagan told reporters after the
meeting.
In a report to the board, Hitch
said passage of the initiative
would mean the university would
have to "pursue one or more of
the following courses of action:
"To continue to trim and
squeeze faculty-student ratios,
maintenance costs, library support
and other expenditures as we have
done for the past six years, and on
top of what we have done for the
past six years.
"To eliminate academic

programs.
"To increase tuition."
Fee Boost
That increase, given the most
pessimistic outlook, could mean a
$500 yearly increase in the
university's "educational fee" —
tuition, Hitch said at a news
conference after the regents'
meeting. UC students presently
pay $100 a quarter in tuition.
Reagan's plan would cut state
income taxes permanently by 7V2
percent. It would clamp a
gradually descending lid on the
percentage of state personal
income taxes the state could take.
Reagan says the state now
takes about 8.75 percent and that
would drop to about seven
percent over the next 15 years.
Too Complicated
"Over the past month, I have
had to become something of an
expert on the initiative, but its
complexities are such that I still
don't fully understand many of its
aspects, and I suspect that a
substantial number of other
people are similarly lacking in full
comprehension of its
ramifications," Hitch said in his
27-page report to regents.
Earlier, regents approved a
record $1.1 billion budget for
next year. The spending plan asks
for nearly $500 million in state
support for fiscal 1974-75, a
$47.3 million jump over the
state's current contribution to the
university.
The final budget is determined
by the legislature and the
governor.

But with Reagan listening
impassively, Hitch told UC regents
the plan is so complex it is hard to
estimate exactly what it will mean
to the university.
UC regents declined Friday to
take a stand either for or against
the tax plan, which goes before
voters Nov. 6 as Prop. 1.
On a split voice vote, the board
approved a motion from Regent
Elinor Heller to table the issue
until the regents' November
meeting — which takes place after
the election.
No Interference
Reagan said he favored keeping
the board out of the Prop. 1 issue.
"My only concern was that the
regents not take part in
politicizing the university. We've
had enough of that in the past,"
Reagan told reporters after the
meeting.
In a report to the board, Hitch
said passage of the initiative
would mean the university would
have to "pursue one or more of
the following courses of action:
"To continue to trim and
squeeze faculty-student ratios,
maintenance costs, library support
and other expenditures as we have
done for the past six years, and on
top of what we have done for the
past six years.
"To eliminate academic

programs.
"To increase tuition."
Fee Boost
That increase, given the most
pessimistic outlook, could mean a
$500 yearly increase in the
university's "educational fee" —
tuition, Hitch said at a news
conference after the regents'
meeting. UC students presently
pay $100 a quarter in tuition.
Reagan's plan would cut state
income taxes permanently by 7V2
percent. It would clamp a
gradually descending lid on the
percentage of state personal
income taxes the state could take.
Reagan says the state now
takes about 8.75 percent and that
would drop to about seven
percent over the next 15 years.
Too Complicated
"Over the past month, I have
had to become something of an
expert on the initiative, but its
complexities are such that I still
don't fully understand many of its
aspects, and I suspect that a
substantial number of other
people are similarly lacking in full
comprehension of its
ramifications," Hitch said in his
27-page report to regents.
Earlier, regents approved a
record $1.1 billion budget for
next year. The spending plan asks
for nearly $500 million in state
support for fiscal 1974-75, a
$47.3 million jump over the
state's current contribution to the
university.
The final budget is determined
by the legislature and the
governor.
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -
Passage of Gov. Ronald Reagan's
controversial tax control plan
could mean up to a $500 a year
increase in tuition charges at the
University of California, UC
President Charles Hitch said
Friday.
