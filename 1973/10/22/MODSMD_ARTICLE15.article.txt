# Alquist Defends Gay Rights
## 
### CHESS ERWIN 
State Sen. Alfred Alquist,
D-San Jose, said last Thursday
that gay people have "a long way
to go in overcoming public
prejudice toward homosexuality."
Speaking to 30 people at a
forum sponsored by the Stanford
Gay People's Union, Alquist
stressed the importance of
problems facing gay people. He
pointed out that frank discussion
of gay life was unpopular. "My
appearance here this evening is a
political liability not an asset," he
asserted.
The major obstacle, he
continued, is overcoming public
misconceptions about
homosexuality. "You people have
a responsibility to correct public
impressions about
homosexuality," he declared.
Know The Issues
Alquist stated that gays should
strive to improve communication
with legislators. Staying abreast of
other major public problems is
vital as well, he continued. By
seeking a broader base of support
through concern for other issues,
gays can help their own cause,
Alquist said.
"Being directly interested in
many issues, you will be far more
influential with the legislature,"
he noted. In so doing, gays can

convince legislators of their issues
and other issues facing the
community too, he said.
Alquist pointed out that the
legislature does listen to the
people but he emphasized that
"they won't respond unless they
think it is politically advantageous
to do so." Gay rights discussions
aren't advantageous at this time,
he reiterated.
Change The Name
"I just don't know exactly how
to influence legislators to help
homosexuals," Alquist admitted.
However, he suggested that the
homosexual movement rid itself
of the "gay people" epithet
because of its repugnance to the
public. By calling itself the
Society for Individual Rights, the
name of one prominent
homosexual group, the movement
will help to change its image, he
asserted.
Alquist, a member of the
American Civil Liberties Union,
conceded that gays "could be a
political asset" if they are well
organized. He stipulated that such
organization is critical in order to
mobilize and change public
opinion.
Repression of homosexuals and
their lifestyles is the result of
adverse public opinion, Alquist
noted. "When you get a legislator

to stand up and admit that he is a
homosexual, then you will get
your laws and reforms passed," he
declared.
New Laws
Reform of laws governing
homosexuals and others are
needed, Alquist suggested,
because there is "far too much
time and money wasted on
victimless crime." He suggested
the repeal of adultery and other
sexual conduct laws as possible
reform targets.
"The state or the law has no
business in the bedroom," Alquist
affirmed. "Sex of any kind should
be conducted in a private place,"
to avoid difficulties, he added.
"I am a pragmatist," said
Alquist, "and it is obvious to me
that reform legislation such as
that proposed by [Assemblyman]
Willie Brown [D-San Francisco] is
impossible now." However, "I
admire Brown's courage and that
of the Stanford Gay People's
Union in helping to bring these
issues to the attention of the
public."

GAY RIGHTS — State Sen. Alfred Alquist spoke last Thursday on
prejudice, judicial repression and other problems facing homosexuals.
Alquist suggested actions to meet these problems might include
creation of a new public image, better organization of gay people, and
improved communication with legislators.
