# 'Give Me Courage, Hope'
## Baez Praises Political Prisoners 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
"The greatest fear of any
political prisoner is that he or she
will be forgotten by the outside
world," folksinger Joan Baez told
an audience of over 175 persons
Saturday night in Memorial
Church.
Baez, one of three featured
speakers in the final night of
Amnesty International's "Prisoner
of Conscience" week, urged the
audience to become involved in
the group's struggle to free
political prisoners across the
world.
UC Berkeley Law Prof. Frank
Newman and Amnesty
International West Coast
coordinator Ginetta Sagan joined
Baez in assessing the plight of the
world's political prisoners.
Baez related stories of the
torturing of political prisoners in
Chile in gory detail and stressed
that "coming close to that agony
is hard for all of us."
Bravery, Stamina
Baez commended these
prisoners as a group for their
"bravery and stamina. These
people give me courage and
hope," she said.
"Working with Amnesty
International helps me come face

to face with myself," Baez said. "I
must feel I'm doing something
worthwhile, something more than
'band-aid work.' "
World-wide chapters of
Amnesty International, groups of

citizens from different nations,
have worked together to free
more than 7000 political prisoners
in Greece and elsewhere, Baez
said.
International Censure
Newman also praised Amnesty
International for its work in
bringing international censure
against nations who refuse to
release political enemies from jail.
He said that "20,000 to 30,000
angry letters from foreigners"
work effectively as a "campaign
of embarrassment" to shame
governments into releasing
prisoners.
No government, especially
ours, likes criticism from other
countries, he said.
Ameliorate Conditions
Sagan said that if international
concern does not free prisoners, it
at least works to ameliorate their
conditions. Governments often
stop torturing prisoners who
receive attention, she said.
"And if someone outside is
making efforts [to free
prisoners]," Sagan said, "the
prisoners find out."
Newman applauded the United
Nations (U.N.) for adopting legal
procedures in the last five years
which allow individuals or groups

to complain directly to a "world
court" about their governments.
U.N. Charter
He read passages from the
United Nations charter and
stressed the importance of the
U.N. declaration of human rights
which outlaws "cruel and
degrading treatment" of prisoners
by governments.
"Now, by treaty, all nations
have pledged not to violate human
rights," Newman said. "And any
lawyer who disputes it ought to
be disbarred."
Newman said he hoped the
United Nations would take strong
action in condemning the
governments of Brazil, Indonesia,
Iran, Tanzania, Greece and others
who torture prisoners according
to Newman. U.N. action would
provide "a ringing declaration
against old fashioned fascism"
throughout the world, he said.
Newman characterized recent
Nobel prize winner Dr. Henry
Kissinger, secretary of state, as a
man who "really doesn't care
about human rights."
He criticized Kissinger for
seeking peace in Vietnam without
regard to "how many thousands
were killed or how long it took."
