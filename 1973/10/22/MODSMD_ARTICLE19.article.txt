# Garcia's Boots Even Cardinal Record At 3-3
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
SEATTLE — Stanford showed
Saturday it was a much better
football team than Washington,
and that's why the Cardinals won
the game 23-14.
Stanford also showed an
inability to make the big play
needed for touchdowns, and that's
why the Cards could easily have
lost the game when the Huskies
made a brilliant fourth quarter
charge.
As it turned out, the only thing
that evened Stanford's record at
3-3 was Rod Garcia's field goal
kicking. Garcia booted 37, 38 and
47-yard field goals, which,
combined with a 10-yard
touchdown pass from Mike Boryla
to Eric Test, was all the scoring
Stanford got until the closing
seconds, when the outcome of the
Seattle battle was no longer in
doubt.
After three quarters, it seemed
as if Stanford's 16-0 lead would
hold up and the Cardinals would
win one of the most boring games
in football history. Washington
could mount no semblance of an
offensive attack. The Huskies
were so bad they couldn't even
complete a forward pass until late
in the third quarter, when Chris
Rowland entered the game at
quarterback.
With Rowland in the game, the
Huskies game storming back, and
the wet crowd of 51,500
responded with thunderous cheers
which inspired the host team still
more.
Touchdown Pass
Early in the quarter, Rowland
flipped a 46-yard touchdown pass
to Scott Phillips streaking down
the right sideline. Safety Craig
Zaltosky barely missed deflecting
the throw which made the score
16-7.
Stanford couldn't move the
ball on the next series and was
forced to punt. Rowland took
over again, throwing a 42-yard
pass to Mark McDonald, who took
the ball away from the snakebit
Zaltosky at the 12 yard line.
From there, Washington easily
pushed the ball across the goal
line, scoring on a one-yard run by
Rowland. Skip Boyd spiraled the
extra point to make it 16-14.
On the ensuing kickoff, Ron
Inge fumbled and Washington's
Mark Kreutz recovered at the
Stanford 19 as the Husky team
and crowd practically exploded
with excitement.
Thing; fooled down a bit when
Doc Blanchard fell on a fumble on
the next play caused, according to
Washington coach Jim Owens,
"by overanxiousness." But then
Boryla was intercepted on a fluke
play on the next series, and
Washington had another chance to
take the lead.
Drive Stalled
Rowland fired the team up
once more, driving the Huskies
downfield with a 14-yard run
around right end. The Washington
drive got down to the five yard
line before stalling. Boyd came in
to kick the field goal which would
have given Washington a 17-16
lead. But Boyd muffed the kick
and the Huskies never really
threatened again.
Previously, Boyd's punting
heroics had been a highlight of the
game. Boyd, the nation's leading
punter going into the game with a
44.4 average, kicked for an
average of 45.3 yards during the
contest.
That average could have been
higher had Boyd not deliberately
kicked a 29-yarder to pin

Stanford near its goal line. But the
junior star's greatest contribution
was in punting 46 yards on the
run after a bad snap.
Despite being the best punter
this side of Ray Guy, however,
Boyd is not a field goal kicker, as
Washington sadly learned
Saturday. The Huskies' regular
kicker was hurt last week.
After Boyd's miss, Boryla
directed a 13-play drive that all
but eliminated Washington's
chances. Key plays that kept this
drive going were passes from
Boryla to Reggie Ishman and Bill
Singler.
"We could have played it safe
and run three times and punted,"
Boryla said. "But I didn't want to
do that to our defense. I came out
there and thought 'this is a
challenge: right now we're going
to find out how good we
are .. . I'm going to find out how
good I am.' "
Stanford's drive finally stalled
with 1:20 to play in the game.
But Rowland could manage no
more magic, and Stanford took
the ball over on downs at the
Washington eight with 54 seconds
to play. It took Scott Laidlaw
I four seconds to run over left end
for the final touchdown.
Inept Passing
Defensively, Stanford had no
trouble at all stopping the inept
"Quick-T" offense until the
fourth quarter. Husky
quarterbacks Dennis Fitzpatrick
and Rowland, who roll out on
every play, couldn't throw while
running, and completed only
three of 17 passes.
Stanford's secondary generally
blanketed Washington's ends.
Cornerback Jim Kaffen, who
intercepted a pass late in the
game, covered especially closely
and admitted after the game, "the
referees were giving the defensive
backs on both sides a great deal of
leeway," in not calling pass
interference.
Other defensive stars included
linebacker Gordie Riegel, who
once again led the team with 13
tackles and assists and linebacker
Terry Pape, who played his best
game of the year, making 12
stops. Pat Donovan once again

anchored the defensive line,
making several key plays from his
right end position.
But while the Cardinal defense
generally played well, the offense
once again had trouble making the
big plays. Boryla's 30-yard pass to
Singler was the longest play of the
game, and Garcia's field goals
took place because Stanford could
not complete key passes on third
down situations in Washington
territory.

Cardinal Notes: Stanford
alumni making the trip to Seattle
seemed interested in only one
thing besides a Stanford victory —
Garcia's race against time to set
the NCAA career field goal
record. With his three kicks
Saturday, Garcia now needs only
six field goals in his remaining five
games to break the record of 37
set by Bob Jacobs of Wyoming
during the 1968-70 seasons.
Stanford's basketball team will
be playing on a strange floor when
the Cards travel to Seattle to meet
the Huskies on Feb. 18.
Washington has replaced the
Tartan floor in Edmonson
Pavilion with a traditional wood
surface.

GARCIA NEARS RECORD — Rod Garcia, shown here kicking a field
goal against San Jose State earlier this season, is now only five kicks
short of the all-time NCAA field goal record. Garcia, who already
holds the Pac-8 field goal and kick-scoring records, led Stanford to a
23-14 victory over Washington Saturday with three field goals and
now has 32 career three-pointers.
