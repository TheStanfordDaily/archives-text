# Reagan Urges Spending Limit
## Tax Plan Controversy Rages 
### BILL EVERS News Analysis 
The level of government services,
the incomes of taxpayers, and the
futures of aspiring politicians all hinge
on the outcome of the Nov. 6 vote on
Proposition One, Gov. Ronald
Reagpn's tax initiative.
Public response to Reagan's
controversial plan to place a
constitutional constraint on state taxes
and expenditures reveals significant
disagreements over the proper size of
the tax burden, over the possibility
and desirability of cuts in the
projected levels of government
expenditures for the years ahead, and
over the desirability of having what
opponents call a "strait-jacket" on
government spending "frozen" into
the state constitution.
In brief, the Reagan tax proposal
seeks to:
— Limit state government spending
to a diminishing percentage of
California's total personal income,
beginning at the present 8.75 percent
rate and declining in gradual steps to
7.25 percent in 1989. Assuming a
rising personal income, the proposal
would still permit the state to triple its
expenditures over 15 years, according
to the proposal's proponents.
Surpluses
— Require that any future state
surpluses be applied to tax refunds or
reductions, unless used to meet
specific emergencies declared by the
governor. Gov. Reagan predicts that
this provision will result in an
aggregate tax cut of 20 percent over
the cause of 15 years.
— Prevent the legislature from
approving any new taxes, except by a
two-thirds vote. Any such on-going
increase in the state tax burden would
have to be approved in a state-wide
referendum.
In general, the proposal's political
opponents agree that not enough
personal income is channeled into the
governmental sector of the economy.
Opponent Richard Musgrave,
economics professor at Harvard, argues
that "a balanced use of resources and
distribution of incomes in our society
would call for a larger [rather] than a
smaller public-sector share than now
exists."
In response, proponents J.
Clayburn LaForce, chairman of the
economics department at UCLA; W.
Craig Stubblebine, professor of
economics at Claremont; Martin
Anderson, senior fellow at the Hoover
Institution; and William A. Niskanen,
public policy professor at UC Berkeley
contend that Musgrave, Tobin, and
other leading opponents have
"ideological preferences for bigger
government and the higher taxes
necessary to feed that growth."
Loopholes
A report issued by the state
Assembly's office of research argues
that instead of focusing solely on "the
magnitude of the total tax burden,"
tax reform should also focus on "the
kinds of taxes levied and the

distribution of these taxes among
taxpaying groups."
Replies Milton Friedman,
economics professor at the University
of Chicago and a proponent of
Reagan's plan: "(The plan) doesn't do
a thing about tax loopholes — that's
completely independent, whether you
have this program or not. The closing
of loopholes depends on action by the
legislature. That can be done without
this program, that can be done with it.
This program does nothing about
measles, either."
Instead, Friedman maintains that
the initiative is the strategic answer to
a specific problem: how to keep down
the total amount of spending. "We
know for certain," he says, "that
trying to cut down particular projects
doesn't work .... When you take one
program by itself, all of the people
who have a special interest in that
program land in Sacramento like a ton
of bricks. It's worth their while to
spend a great deal of energy on it.
Interest
"On the other hand, the public
interest in having that program is
diffused. Each one of us saves a few

cents, but for the special interests,
these cents accumulate into a great
many dollars. As a result, whenever
you try to take off one special
program at a time, the special interests
win every time and the general interest
is suppressed."
The opponents of the Reagan plan
want to keep full powers on fiscal
matters in the hands of the legislature.
The state Assembly's office of research
states "the proper balance between
government benefits and costs is
determined collectively by citizens
through their elected representatives,
who vote on measures relating to
public and private spending and
government services and programs."
A major concern of the opponents
of the proposal is the possibility and
desirability of reductions in what are
now the projected levels of
government spending for the years
ahead.
Projections
The claims of these opponents are
based on hypothetical annual average
growth rates of the costs of existing
government programs. Opponents
believe that their projections are
grounded in the history of the rising
costs of such programs. The
Assembly's research office notes that
the index of government costs has in
the past "risen much faster than the
consumer price index."
For this reason, A. Alan Post, the
state legislature's budget analyst,
argues in his critique of Reagan's plan
that cutbacks on projected future calls
on government services would be
necessary.
Post's estimate of $12.32 billion for
1977-78 state expenditures, based on
workload projections, indicates that
only a 5.5 percent reduction would be
required to reach the projected limit
for that year of $11.65 billion.
Pressure
But in the short run, according to
Post, the fact that a major portion of
total expenditures consists of
constitutionally- and
statutorily-mandated programs will
place pressure on discretionary
expenditures for health, higher
education, local schools, and transfers
to local governments in general.
The campaign group supporting the
tax initiative, an organization called
Californians for Lower Taxes,
counters: "The plan doesn't encourage
or discourage particular program cuts.
The limitation on revenue proposed by
this [constitutional] amendment
would slow down the growth of
state-funded programs, not eliminate
them or even cut them back. It would
be up to the legislature to determine
whether to cut programs, which
programs to cut back and to what
extent."
Aside from suggesting that it is time
for the legislature to set priorities, the
supporters of Reagan's proposal have
their own hypothetical projections of
government costs. They say that
spending will recede in the face of
budgetary constraints.
Amendment
The form that Reagan's tax
proposal takes, a firmly implanted
constitutional amendment, has
provoked negative reactions from
some.
Economist Joseph A. Pechman

opposes such a constitutional
limitation: "I do not believe that it
would be in the interest of good
government in any state to limit
expenditures either in absolute or
relative terms by constitution .... A
constitutional limitation on state
government expenditures would
reflect a basic distrust of the electorate
and of the people they choose to
represent them in the legislature."
But proponent James Buchanan,
economics professor at Virginia
Polytechnic Institute, believes that a
constitutional amendment is the
appropriate format for tax reform.
Bureaucracy
"Unfortunately," says Buchanan,
"evidence accumulates that legislatures
respond largely to the pressures of the
entrenched government bureaucracy.

rather than to the public at large. Until
the legislature is forced by
constitutional restriction to face up to
the conflicts between the interest of
the citizens and the bureaucracy, they
will continue to take the road of least
resistance. This has been, until now,
that of allowing government budgets
and taxes to continue to grow."
The fate of the tax proposal will
certainly affect the political future of
Gov. Reagan. "If it passes, it will be an
enormous plus if he runs for
President," says Robert Finch, former
Secretary of Health, Education, and
Welfare. "But it won't be much of a
minus, nationally, if it loses." In
addition, Assembly speaker Robert
Moretti of Van Nuys has closely
attached his bid for the California
gubernatorial nomination to his early

and especially strong opposition to
Reagan's proposal.
Proponents promise an end to the
legislature's "blank check authority
over taxes." Opponents declare that
Proposition One "will mean
deteriorating public services." Michael
Boskin, economics professor at
Stanford, feels there is too much
hysteria on both sides. He points out
the numerous ways to get around the
tax limitation by substitution of
taxing and spending at local and
national levels and by a governor
redefining what is a user tax and what
is an expenditure.
Whatever happens on Nov. 6,
however, will be taken as symbolically
indicative of voter attitudes toward
tax reform and may well have
nation-wide ramifications.
