# Reagan Urges Spending Limit
## Tax Plan Controversy Rages 
### BILL EVERS News Analysis 
The level of government services,
the incomes of taxpayers, and the
futures of aspiring politicians all hinge
on the outcome of the Nov. 6 vote on
Proposition One, Gov. Ronald
Reagpn's tax initiative.
Public response to Reagan's
controversial plan to place a
constitutional constraint on state taxes
and expenditures reveals significant
disagreements over the proper size of
the tax burden, over the possibility
and desirability of cuts in the
projected levels of government
expenditures for the years ahead, and
over the desirability of having what
opponents call a "strait-jacket" on
government spending "frozen" into
the state constitution.
In brief, the Reagan tax proposal
seeks to:
— Limit state government spending
to a diminishing percentage of
California's total personal income,
beginning at the present 8.75 percent
rate and declining in gradual steps to
7.25 percent in 1989. Assuming a
rising personal income, the proposal
would still permit the state to triple its
expenditures over 15 years, according
to the proposal's proponents.
Surpluses
— Require that any future state
surpluses be applied to tax refunds or
reductions, unless used to meet
specific emergencies declared by the
governor. Gov. Reagan predicts that
this provision will result in an
aggregate tax cut of 20 percent over
the cause of 15 years.
— Prevent the legislature from
approving any new taxes, except by a
two-thirds vote. Any such on-going
increase in the state tax burden would
have to be approved in a state-wide
referendum.
In general, the proposal's political
opponents agree that not enough
personal income is channeled into the
governmental sector of the economy.
Opponent Richard Musgrave,
economics professor at Harvard, argues
that "a balanced use of resources and
distribution of incomes in our society
would call for a larger [rather] than a
smaller public-sector share than now
exists."
In response, proponents J.
Clayburn LaForce, chairman of the
economics department at UCLA; W.
Craig Stubblebine, professor of
economics at Claremont; Martin
Anderson, senior fellow at the Hoover
Institution; and William A. Niskanen,
public policy professor at UC Berkeley
contend that Musgrave, Tobin, and
other leading opponents have
"ideological preferences for bigger
government and the higher taxes
necessary to feed that growth."
Loopholes
A report issued by the state
Assembly's office of research argues
that instead of focusing solely on "the
magnitude of the total tax burden,"
tax reform should also focus on "the
kinds of taxes levied and the

distribution of these taxes among
taxpaying groups."
Replies Milton Friedman,
economics professor at the University
of Chicago and a proponent of
Reagan's plan: "(The plan) doesn't do
a thing about tax loopholes — that's
completely independent, whether you
have this program or not. The closing
of loopholes depends on action by the
legislature. That can be done without
this program, that can be done with it.
This program does nothing about
measles, either."
Instead, Friedman maintains that
the initiative is the strategic answer to
a specific problem: how to keep down
the total amount of spending. "We
know for certain," he says, "that
trying to cut down particular projects
doesn't work .... When you take one
program by itself, all of the people
who have a special interest in that
program land in Sacramento like a ton
of bricks. It's worth their while to
spend a great deal of energy on it.
Interest
"On the other hand, the public
interest in having that program is
diffused. Each one of us saves a few

cents, but for the special interests,
these cents accumulate into a great
many dollars. As a result, whenever
you try to take off one special
program at a time, the special interests
win every time and the general interest
is suppressed."
The opponents of the Reagan plan
want to keep full powers on fiscal
matters in the hands of the legislature.
The state Assembly's office of research
states "the proper balance between
government benefits and costs is
determined collectively by citizens
through their elected representatives,
who vote on measures relating to
public and private spending and
government services and programs."
A major concern of the opponents
of the proposal is the possibility and
desirability of reductions in what are
now the projected levels of
government spending for the years
ahead.
Projections
The claims of these opponents are
based on hypothetical annual average
growth rates of the costs of existing
government programs. Opponents
