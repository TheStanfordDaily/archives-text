## Frustrated Cougars Scare UCLA 
### 
For a while Saturday in
Spokane, Wash., coach Jim
Sweeney and his Washington State
Cougars thought they might
finally be reaping the benefits of a
treacherous early season schedule.
The Cougars sported an
undistinguished 1-4 record going
into Saturday's game against
UCLA, having lost to a very
distinguished group of opponents
(Kansas, Arizona State, Ohio
State, USC). But in the early
going Saturday at Joe Albi
Stadium, it looked like all that
suffering might have been
worthwhile.
The Cougars held the Bruins
scoreless in the first period and
yielded only an Efren Herrera
field goal during the first half,
escaping to the locker room
trailing only 3-0. But three Bruin
touchdowns in the third period

ruined WSU's upset hopes, as
UCLA improved its record to 5-1
with a 24-13 victory.
The frustrated Cougars, now
1-5, will be looking for their first
Pac-8 win at Stanford Stadium
this Saturday.
In Los Angeles, USC's
sixth-ranked Trojans extended
their unbeaten streak to 23 games
with a 31-10 romp over Oregon.
Pat Haden threw two touchdown
passes (one to Lynn Swann and
one to J.K. McKay) and ran for
another score to pace the Trojan
attack.
California added a new twist to
its attack against Oregon STate
Saturday in Berkeley. The Bears
decided to play defense, and the
decision paid off as Cal
embarrassed Pac-8 passing leader
Alvin White by intercepting five
of his passes. Cal won the game,
24-14.
