## The 						Seattle Boos 
### Vlae Kershner 
SEATTLE — The Washington Huskies are treated as Seattle's pro
football team. Fans turn out in great numbers (50,000 minimum) for
games, the team is financed by a huge budget and the papers never
cease to discuss the fortunes of the team that plays the only game of
football in town.
So when the faithful have a lousy team, as is true this year, they
react as pro football fans would — by booing.
Target of the jeers is Jim Owens, head coach for 17 years. Early in
that tenure, Owens took the Huskies to the Rose Bowl three times,
then, after some bad years, developed a great team around Sonny
Sixkiller.
But mostly because of Stanford, Sixkiller never played in Pasadena,
and now Washington fans don't even have happy memories.
So when it was announced Saturday that Owens would narrate
highlights of the Stanford game, the crowd responded with
thunderous boos.
And there are other signs. An attractive "Husky Honey," waiting
to distribute Washington's mo6t Delicious apples to the Stanford
team, said that someone was trying to hire a skywriter to appear over
Husky Stadium during the game to write "Fire Owens."
Feels The Pressure
The Washington Daily has hinted in an editorial that Owens must
go. And the coaching staff nervously feels the pressure.
An assistant coach, wearing a beat-up straw hat, told observers,
"I'm going to wear this hat until we win, which might be a long time
from now ... I may need to keep it though, the big fellow [Owens]
and I may both be looking for work pretty soon."
All this isn't too extraordinary. Professional college football
coaches are fired if they don't win.
Owens has committed several real-or-imagined sins while in charge
of the Washington Huskies, Inc. One complaint is that "he doesn't
communicate with his players," a problem which got him into trouble
with black members of his squad several years ago.
Another complaint — "he starts the wrong quarterback." Against
Stanford, that was apparently true, as the Huskies didn't even
complete a forward pass until Chris Rowland entered the game in the
second half.
Rowland, a sophomore who starred against California, throwing
five touchdown passes, immediately fired up the team. "What Owens
doesn't realize is that the team needs a leader on the field ... he
doesn't think it makes any difference who he puts at quarterback," a
local sportswriter commented.
Sailing Away
Owens lives across Union Bay from the Stadium, and speculation is
that he'll sail away for the last time fairly soon.
The next head coach? It looks like Washington will attempt to lure
Jim Sweeney away from Washington State. Sweeney's a good coach,
winning despite the fact that his school has few of the advantages its
Seattle rival has.
For example, Washington gives away more scholarships than any
other Pacific Eight school, is located on a beautiful campus in a major
city, is one of only three schools in the Pac-8 which draws a lot of
fans (the others are USC and Stanford), and is a good school
academically.
Whoever is coach, he'll probably use these advantages to build good
football teams. Washington has a fine sophomore class right now that
will be tough to stop in a year or two.
And when the team is good again, the Husky fans will react as they
did when Stanford played here two years ago ... students arriving
early in the morning to battle for a seat, everyone screaming louder
than seems possible anywhere else on the Coast, the entire town of
Seattle going nuts.
But then, when the Huskies are back down, you can bet that
whoever is head coach will be hearing loud choruses of boos.
