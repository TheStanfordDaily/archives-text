# Cards Note 1-1
## Injuries Mar JV Win 
### TIM FERGUSON 
Relying on a ground game after
their starting quarterback was
racked up for the season,
Stanford's junior varsity
footballers rolled to a 26-6
decision Friday at Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo.
Ron Himes suffered a broken
collarbone while tackling a
Mustang who had recovered a
Stanford fumble late in the third
quarter.
Larry McGovern directed the
Cardinal attack for the remainder
of a game which had its
second-half quarters reduced to
12 minutes apiece at the behest of
Cal Poly officials who feared that
continued injuries would decimate
their team.
In a reversal of form from last
week's loss to UCLA, Stanford
used the rush to dominate the
statistics (327 total yards for the
Cards, 52 for Cal Poly). Stanford
runners piled up 255 yards, led by
Tom Oberhelman's 110 yards in

22 carries.
Additional injury casualties for
the Cardinals were Marvin
Holmes, who rushed for 75 yards
in 11 carries before leaving with a
hip-pointer midway through the
second quarter, and tight end
Dave Buzzone, who injured his
knee on what coach Gunther
Cunningham called "a tremendous
block — they [the Mustangs]
carried their guy off, too."
Bruzzone Questionable
Cunningham said Sunday that
Holmes' injury was not serious,
but that Buzzone's condition was
unknown. "I hope it's not really
serious."
Aside from the injuries,
Cunningham was happy with the
game's result. "We had a couple of
things we wanted to iron out, and
we did." He mentioned the
amount of Stanford turnovers (2,
half of last week's total), and the
kicking game (Tom Lynn averaged
46.9 yards in three punts,
compared with 33.7 against

UCLA).
Cunningham was particularly
impressed with his defense. "They
played super," he said, singling
out lineman Art Estrada and Greg
Dowson and back Duncan McColl.
The Card defenders used gang
tackling effectively, Cunningham
said. "They just played like a
bunch of wild men."
Stanford got two
opening-quarter scores on field
goals of 44 and 43 yards by Chip
Underwood. The running attack
then went to work, as the Cards
did what they had failed to do the
week before: "punch it in" from
inside the 20.
First Score
Marvin Holmes got the first
Stanford touchdown on a 15-yard
pitch-out in the second quarter.
The PAT snap was fumbled and
the Underwood's kick missed.
Later in the period, Himes hit
Ray Anderson for a 16-yard
touchdown. Himes completed
seven of 14 for 72 yards before
his injury.
But Himes' season has now
ended after just one game, and
Cunningham is trying to get
varsity coach Jack Christiansen to
allow Mike Cordova, star of the
UCLA game, to play again for the
JV. If Cunningham fails, he will
play McGovern, who failed to
complete a pass and threw one
interception Friday.
"If Cordova stays with the
varsity," the coach said, "we'll
just have McGovern hand the ball
off" all season, not such a
tragedy, he thinks, because of the
potent running attack the Cards
displayed Friday.
One of those backs,
Oberhelman, scored the Cards'
final touchdown on a one-yard
run in the third quarter to cap a
12-play, 63-yard drive in which he
carried the ball on every down.

"If Cordova stays with the
varsity," the coach said, "we'll
just have McGovern hand the ball
off" all season, not such a
tragedy, he thinks, because of the
potent running attack the Cards
displayed Friday.
One of those backs,
Oberhelman, scored the Cards'
final touchdown on a one-yard
run in the third quarter to cap a
12-play, 63-yard drive in which he
carried the ball on every down.
Relying on a ground game after
their starting quarterback was
racked up for the season,
Stanford's junior varsity
footballers rolled to a 26-6
decision Friday at Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo.
Ron Himes suffered a broken
collarbone while tackling a
Mustang who had recovered a
Stanford fumble late in the third
quarter.
Larry McGovern directed the
Cardinal attack for the remainder
of a game which had its
second-half quarters reduced to
12 minutes apiece at the behest of
Cal Poly officials who feared that
continued injuries would decimate
their team.
In a reversal of form from last
week's loss to UCLA, Stanford
used the rush to dominate the
statistics (327 total yards for the
Cards, 52 for Cal Poly). Stanford
runners piled up 255 yards, led by
Tom Oberhelman's 110 yards in

22 carries.
Additional injury casualties for
the Cardinals were Marvin
Holmes, who rushed for 75 yards
in 11 carries before leaving with a
hip-pointer midway through the
second quarter, and tight end
Dave Buzzone, who injured his
knee on what coach Gunther
Cunningham called "a tremendous
block — they [the Mustangs]
carried their guy off, too."
Bruzzone Questionable
Cunningham said Sunday that
Holmes' injury was not serious,
but that Buzzone's condition was
unknown. "I hope it's not really
serious."
Aside from the injuries,
Cunningham was happy with the
game's result. "We had a couple of
things we wanted to iron out, and
we did." He mentioned the
amount of Stanford turnovers (2,
half of last week's total), and the
kicking game (Tom Lynn averaged
46.9 yards in three punts,
compared with 33.7 against

UCLA).
Cunningham was particularly
impressed with his defense. "They
played super," he said, singling
out lineman Art Estrada and Greg
Dowson and back Duncan McColl.
The Card defenders used gang
tackling effectively, Cunningham
said. "They just played like a
bunch of wild men."
Stanford got two
opening-quarter scores on field
goals of 44 and 43 yards by Chip
Underwood. The running attack
then went to work, as the Cards
did what they had failed to do the
week before: "punch it in" from
inside the 20.
First Score
Marvin Holmes got the first
Stanford touchdown on a 15-yard
pitch-out in the second quarter.
The PAT snap was fumbled and
the Underwood's kick missed.
Later in the period, Himes hit
Ray Anderson for a 16-yard
touchdown. Himes completed
seven of 14 for 72 yards before
his injury.
But Himes' season has now
ended after just one game, and
Cunningham is trying to get
varsity coach Jack Christiansen to
allow Mike Cordova, star of the
UCLA game, to play again for the
JV. If Cunningham fails, he will
play McGovern, who failed to
complete a pass and threw one
interception Friday.
