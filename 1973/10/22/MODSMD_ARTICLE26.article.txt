# Sandoval Sets Cross Country Mark
## 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
Tony Sandoval clipped five
seconds off the Stanford six-mile
record, but the team as a whole
was unable to overcome a
determined onslaught by
California as the Cards dropped
their first home cross country
meet to Cal 38-51.
The West Valley Track Club
was third with 54 points and San
Jose State fourth with 67 in the
four-way competition held
Saturday morning at the Stanford
golf course.
Sandoval's 29:03 eclipsed the
former record of 29:08 set by
Greg Brock in 1969. The 5-7, 120
pound sophomore brought his
time down from last season's best
of 29:15.4, which had put him
third on Stanford's all-time list.

"We weren't really expecting a
record," said Coach Marshall
Clark. "You can't go into a meet
expecting a performance like
that." The cross country mentor
went on to explain that
Sandoval's time would probably
have been three to five seconds
faster if he hadn't missed one of
the course markers as he was
coming in. "If he'd noticed the
flag a little earlier, he might have
broken 29:00."
Sandoval's time, besides being
a new Stanford record, was the
fifth fastest time ever run on the
course. He crossed the finish line
30 seconds ahead of the
runner-up, Kerry Hagan of West
Valley. Brian Maxwell led the
victorious Cal squad, taking third
in 29:35.

Sandoval was not the only
standout performer for the Cards
Saturday. Jack Bellah, also a
sophomore, knocked over half a
minute off his personal best as he
came in fourth behind Maxwell.
Bellah's 29:40 was fast enough to
move him to eighth on the
Stanford all-time list.
The gap between Bellah and
the Cards' next placer, Mark
McConnell (12th — 30:24) gave
Cal the points it needed. Two
frosh runners, Steve Crowley
(30:44) and Frank Boutin
(30:59), turned in fine
performances to complete
Stanford's scoring.
In the final analysis, it was
Cal's strength more than
Stanford's weakness that gave the
Bears victory. Cal has been

dominated by the Cards in recent
years, but has managed to build
up a considerably stronger squad
this season.
"You're never satisfied when
you lose, but we had some good
times," Clark said. "We have some
guys out with sickness and
injuries, but I don't think they
would have affected the score
enough to change the result even
if they'd been healthy. Cal's just a
much more impressive team this
year."
The Cards will have their
chance for revenge next Saturday
as they face the Bears again on the
same course along with USC and
UCLA in the Pac-8 Southern
Division championship.
The junior varsity competition
was run at the same time as the
varsity, for a field of 59 runners in
all. The sixth through 12th place
runners on each team scored for
the JV's. Stanford won at the JV
level with 172 points. San Jose
was second with 182, West Valley
third with 196 and Cal fourth
with 208.

Stanford all-time list.
The gap between Bellah and
the Cards' next placer, Mark
McConnell (12th — 30:24) gave
Cal the points it needed. Two
frosh runners, Steve Crowley
(30:44) and Frank Boutin
(30:59), turned in fine
performances to complete
Stanford's scoring.
In the final analysis, it was
Cal's strength more than
Stanford's weakness that gave the
Bears victory. Cal has been

dominated by the Cards in recent
years, but has managed to build
up a considerably stronger squad
this season.
"You're never satisfied when
you lose, but we had some good
times," Clark said. "We have some
guys out with sickness and
injuries, but I don't think they
would have affected the score
enough to change the result even
if they'd been healthy. Cal's just a
much more impressive team this
year."
The Cards will have their
chance for revenge next Saturday
as they face the Bears again on the
same course along with USC and
UCLA in the Pac-8 Southern
Division championship.
The junior varsity competition
was run at the same time as the
varsity, for a field of 59 runners in
all. The sixth through 12th place
runners on each team scored for
the JV's. Stanford won at the JV
level with 172 points. San Jose
was second with 182, West Valley
third with 196 and Cal fourth
with 208.

NEW RECORD HOLDER — Sophomore Tony Sandoval (left) runs on
the Stanford golf course Saturday en route to his school record cross
country time of 29:03. Sandoval won the six-mile race by 30 seconds,
but California edged the Cards 38-51 for first place in the
quadrangular team competition.
Tony Sandoval clipped five
seconds off the Stanford six-mile
record, but the team as a whole
was unable to overcome a
determined onslaught by
California as the Cards dropped
their first home cross country
meet to Cal 38-51.
The West Valley Track Club
was third with 54 points and San
Jose State fourth with 67 in the
four-way competition held
Saturday morning at the Stanford
golf course.
Sandoval's 29:03 eclipsed the
former record of 29:08 set by
Greg Brock in 1969. The 5-7, 120
pound sophomore brought his
time down from last season's best
of 29:15.4, which had put him
third on Stanford's all-time list.

"We weren't really expecting a
record," said Coach Marshall
Clark. "You can't go into a meet
expecting a performance like
that." The cross country mentor
went on to explain that
Sandoval's time would probably
have been three to five seconds
faster if he hadn't missed one of
the course markers as he was
coming in. "If he'd noticed the
flag a little earlier, he might have
broken 29:00."
Sandoval's time, besides being
a new Stanford record, was the
fifth fastest time ever run on the
course. He crossed the finish line
30 seconds ahead of the
runner-up, Kerry Hagan of West
Valley. Brian Maxwell led the
victorious Cal squad, taking third
in 29:35.

Sandoval was not the only
standout performer for the Cards
Saturday. Jack Bellah, also a
sophomore, knocked over half a
minute off his personal best as he
came in fourth behind Maxwell.
Bellah's 29:40 was fast enough to
move him to eighth on the
Stanford all-time list.
