# Soccer Team Trips Menlo, Chico State
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
It took two goals by Menlo
College to convince Stanford's
Cardinals that they were playing a
soccer game Saturday afternoon.
Once the Cards found out,
however, they turned in an
excellent performance on both
offense and defense, beating the
visitors 4-2. It was Stanford's
second win in as many days, as
Chico State fell to the stingy
Cards, 1-0, Friday afternoon in
another home game.
The rivalry between the
neighboring schools was evident
early, as underdog Menlo took the
initiative and applied the pressure
during the opening 25 minutes of
the game.
The Stanford offense was
unable to generate much of an
attack and the defense failed to
clear the ball from the area in
front of the Cards' net.
Early Lead
As a result of the latter
inefficiency, Menlo was able to
put two shots by Goalie Walt
Harris for an early lead.
Stanford came right back after
Menlo took a 2-0 lead, as Brian
Bershader put the Cards on the
scoreboard, hitting his third goal
of the season.

Stanford continued to put on
the pressure during the rest of the
first half and Bobby Geiger kicked
home his first of two goals to
knot the score at 2-2.
The second half was all
Stanford. Ricky Caldwell put the
Cards in the lead, as he took a
perfect pass from Bershader and
kicked it towards the goal.
Menlo's goalkeeper appeared to
have the shot stopped, but it
rolled under him and into the net.
Geiger hit his fourth goal of
the season later in the half to give
the Cards a comfortable margin.
He took a pass from Phil Wright
and dribbled between two
defenders, before punching the
ball by the Menlo goalie.
Superb Defense
While the Menlo victory had to
be one of the best offensive
displays of the season, the Chico
win was highlighted by a superb
defensive effort.
Harris recorded his fourth
shutout of the season, but it was a
combined effort of all the players
that allowed the Cards to upset
Chico.
Johnny Murao got the only
goal of the game early in the first
half, as he kicked in a rebound
shot.
