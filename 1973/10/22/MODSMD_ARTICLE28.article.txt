# Injuries Plague Early Basketball Practices
## 
### 
Stanford's opening week of
basketball drills was marked by a
rash of injuries and sickness, as
four key players and even
assistant coach Bub Bowling
missed workouts due to various
ailments.
Center-forward Mike Mann, a
6-9 two-year veteran, is making
"remarkable progress" from knee
surgery according to head coach
Howie Dallmar, but Mann won't
be able to participate in full drills
for at least two weeks. Dallmar is
"hoping that Mike will be ready"
for Stanford's opener against
Nevada-Reno on Nov. 30.
Senior forward Dave Frost,
who has been bothered by a
recurring series of back injuries
during his two years here, suffered
a muscle spasm in his back during
Tuesday's practice and was unable
to participate the remainder of
the week. Dallmar said yesterday
that he wasn't sure when Frost
would return to action.
Sophomore forward Ed
Schweitzer is recovering from a
bout with mononucleosis and

should begin working out in about
two weeks. Senior guard Jim
Montague missed Friday and
Saturday's drills when he hurt his
spleen in Thursday's practice, but
he should be 100 percent when
the Cards return to Maples this
afternoon.
Bowling, one of Stanford's two
energetic assistant coaches, made ;
Billy Jones' work twice as hard by '
missing practices on Friday and
Saturday due to the flu. Bowling
is expected to return shortly,
however, and right now is the
least of Dallmar's worries.
