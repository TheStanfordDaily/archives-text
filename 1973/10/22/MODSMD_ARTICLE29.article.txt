# Stanford Loses Two Of Three
## Trends Betray Card Poloists 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Stanford's water polo team will
now stop playing the game of
comparing scores to predict future
outcomes. The poloists had
played California two times,
closing the margin of defeat each
time. Thus it was expected that
they would again close the gap on
Friday.
But the Bears didn't cooperate
as they downed Stanford 13-6 at
Harmon Pool in Berkeley.
Saturday the Cards split a
doubleheader at Encina Pool as
they beat Humboldt State 13-5,
and lost a close match to
UC-Davis, 8-7.
Cal is thought by many to be
the best team ever assembled in
the history of college water polo
and Friday the Bears showed why
they deserve the title. The Bears
jumped off to a 6-1 halftime lead.
In the final half the Bears scored 7
points to the Cards five to win the
game, 13-6.
Tom Cummings led the Cards
with two goals. Craig Van Zandt,
Stan Johnson, Roberts and Gebers
scored one goal apiece.
The Cards had beaten Davis
earlier this year in the Northern
California Open tournament.
However it was an improved Davis
team that the Cards met Saturday.
Davis took advantage of several
breakdowns in the Cardinal
defense to defeat the Cards,
scoring the winning goal with just
30 seconds remaining in the game.
Lead Changed Hands
It appeared as if no one wanted
to win the game as the lead
changed hands four times. The
score was tied at the end of the
first half 4-4. Davis then ran off
two straight points at the
beginning of the third period.
Tom Warden rallied the Cards in
the final three minutes of the
period by scoring two goals. Dean
Anderson also contributed one to
give the Cards a 7-6 lead at the
end of the third period.
Davis scored two goals in the
final period and shut out the
Cards in the quarter to record the

victory. Davis accomplished this
with most of its first team sitting
on the bench. Five of Davis'
starting players fouled out of the
contest.
Leading scorers for the Cards
in the game were Anderson with
three goals, and Warden with two.
Rick Gebers and Drew McDonald
contributed one goal each.
One Solid Effort
The Humboldt match was the
only solid Cardinal effort of the
weekend. The Cards were always
in command of the match as they
took a 5-0 first quarter lead and
never looked back. The Cards
added one in the second period.

The third period was the biggest
offensive production of the season
as the Cards scored six goals.
Stanford added one goal in the
final period of play, to make the
final score 13-5.
Leading scorers for the Cards
in the game were John-Paul
Roberts with three goals and
Larry Mann and Warden with two
goals apiece. Rick Gebers, Peter
Snyder, Ton Purcell, Drew
McDonald and Glenn Procter
scored one goal each in the effort.
"We just didn't play well
enough this weekend," said Coach
Jim Gaughran.
