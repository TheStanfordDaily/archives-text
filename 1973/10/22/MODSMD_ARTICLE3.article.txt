# Cox Ouster Sparks Local Debate
## 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
More than 400 people assembled in
Memorial Church last night to hear a
panel call for the impeachment of
President Nixon and to discuss
possible responses to the firing of
Watergate Prosecutor Archibald Cox.
Memorial Chapel Dean Robert
Hamerton-Kelly said impeachment is
necessary "in defense of the

Republic." The President "is no longer
fulfilling his oath to defend the
Constitution," Hamerton-Kelly
declared, "but rather seems to be
subverting it."
Political Science Prof. Hubert
Marshall accused Nixon of
"attempting to aggrandize the powers
of his office at the expense of the
people, and at the expense of Congress

and the judiciary."
"We must face a concerted effort,
conscious effort by the Administration
to deceive us," Palo Alto attorney
John Montgomery warned.
Montgomery, a self-described
"conservative," said he had heard that
at a gathering of prominent attorneys,
superior court judges had declared
themselves for impeachment "to a

man."
ASSU President Kevin O'Grady
announced a rally, to be held in White
Plaza at noon today. Students from
Whitman House circulated a petition
calling for the President's
impeachment. Law student Frederick
Baron, who organized a highly
successful nationwide campaign
against the Indochina war among law
students and faculty across the nation,
announced the opening of a similar
campaign to press for impeachment.
Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr.
(R.-Menlo Park), speaking by
telephone from Washington,
announced his intention to introduce
in the House of Representatives
Tuesday resolutions to require Acting
Atty. Gen. Robert Bork to turn the
records of former Prosecutor Cox,
now under FBI guard, over to the
House and to impeach the President.
McCloskey said his impeachment
resolution would be "limited to four
legal crimes the President has
admitted" — authorization of the
1970 Tom Charles Huston plan to step
up illegal domestic security searches
and wiretaps; the withholding of
evidence from the defense of Daniel
Ellsberg; obstruction of justice in the
instructions to then-Presidential aides
John D. Ehrlichman and H.R.
Haldeman to keep secret the actions of
"plumbers" G. Gordon Liddy and E.
Howard Hunt; and"the gravest of all,"
the withholding of the tapes contrary
to court order.
McCloskey called for "an early,
immediate, and thorough education of
the public and expression of public
opinion."
