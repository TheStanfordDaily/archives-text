Spanish Flood Toll Increasing
MADRID — More than 190 persons are known to have died in flash flooding
in southern Spain and another 300 to 400 are feared either buried under tons of
debris or swept out to sea, police said yesterday.
Some officials said the disaster was greater than in 1962 when 600 persons
were killed in flooding in the Barcelona area.
"Weeks will pass before a definite appraisal of crops and property damage can
be made," one official said. "When all the facts are put together, it will really be
shocking."
Puerto Lumbreras, 55 miles southwest of Murcia, with a population of 8000,
and La Rabita, a fishing village of 2000 in Granada Province, account for
practically all the victims in the flooding.
Chile To Return Industry?
SANTIAGO — Chile's military junta, seeking to overcome the country's
economic paralysis, is preparing to return to private companies a majority of
their firms seized by the former leftist government.
During the three-year regime of Marxist President Salvador Allende, some 200
major foreign and Chilean companies were purchased, requisitioned or seized
outright. Another 300 medium-sized firms fell under government control.
The armed forces ousted Allende in a coup Sept. 11 and the president
committed suicide, according to police. One reason given by the generals for
their action was what they termed the "economic crisis" with inflation
exceeding 300 percent and a critical shortage of food supplies.
At least 40 businesses once controlled or partly owned by U.S. firms were
among the firms taken over by the Allende government.
Before Allende's election in 1970, U.S. investors had a major share of foreign
business activities here. Some 100 American companies had investments
amounting to nearly $650 million with another $350 million held by British,
German, Italian, French and other foreign firms.
A's Capture Second Series
OAKLAND — Bert Campaneris and Reggie Jackson finally unlocked
Oakland's powder keg with a pair of booming two-run homers yesterday, leading
the A's to a 5-2 victory over the New York Mets and winning the World Series
for owner Charles 0. Finley's turbulent team.
Operating with a lame-duck manager — Dick Williams, who formally
announced his resignation minutes after the final out — the A's overcame their
own internal strife and became the first team since the New York Yankees of
1961-62 to win two straight world championships.
The A's infielders tumbled into a joyous pile in front of the mound as the
game ended and thousands of young fans poured onto the field to celebrate.
