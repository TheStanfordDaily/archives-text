# Watergate Special Prosecutors Vow To Continue Investigation
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Members of
the special Watergate prosecution
force remained determined yesterday
to carry on their investigation of the
Watergate scandal despite a
presidential order abolishing their
office.
Nearly all the attorneys are
expected to stay on with the Justice
Department, a prosecution spokesman

said.
"We are here and we are a criminal
prosecution force and we have reason
to believe serious crimes have been
committed and we are going to
prosecute," James S. Doyle,
spokesman for the office, told
newsmen.
The President announced Saturday
night that he had fired special
Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox
and abolished his office's standing as
an entity virtually independent of the
Justice Department.
Within 30 minutes of the White
House announcement FBI agents
appeared at the prosecution force
offices and prohibited the staff from
removing any documents, including
personal papers, from their files.
FBI Withdrawn
The agents were withdrawn at
mid-day yesterday and security was
returned to government guards. But
the restrictions on removal of
documents continued.
Doyle said the staff met late last
night and agreed unanimously to
appear for work next week, when they
would be Justice Department
employees.
Doyle said he had talked by
telephone with Cox and that the
former special prosecutor was in
excellent spirits.
He said he knew of no one other
than Cox who had been fired but
added that "some people higher up
will have some difficult decisions to
make."
Transition Seen
And at the White House a
spokesman said he assumed "there
would be a period of transition" but
that whether all the employees of the
former prosecution force would be
kept on at the Justice Department
would have to be decided by

department officials.
Earlier, in an interview, deputy
special prosecutor Henry Ruth said he
thought the Watergate prosecution
would be pursued vigorously in the
Justice Department by Assistant Atty.
Gen. Henry E. Petersen.
"I happen to think Henry Petersen
would proceed vigorously if he is
allowed to do so," said Ruth.
But it was clear Ruth doubted
Petersen would be in a position to
press the White House for evidence in
its files the way Cox had done.
Bork Waits
Further, Acting Atty. Gen. Robert
H. Bork will announce his decision
tomorrow on the future course of the
Watergate investigation, the Justice
Department said yesterday.
