# Watergate Special Prosecutors Vow To Continue Investigation
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Members of
the special Watergate prosecution
force remained determined yesterday
to carry on their investigation of the
Watergate scandal despite a
presidential order abolishing their
office.
Nearly all the attorneys are
expected to stay on with the Justice
Department, a prosecution spokesman

said.
"We are here and we are a criminal
prosecution force and we have reason
to believe serious crimes have been
committed and we are going to
prosecute," James S. Doyle,
spokesman for the office, told
newsmen.
The President announced Saturday
night that he had fired special
Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox
and abolished his office's standing as
an entity virtually independent of the
Justice Department.
Within 30 minutes of the White
House announcement FBI agents
appeared at the prosecution force
offices and prohibited the staff from
removing any documents, including
personal papers, from their files.
FBI Withdrawn
The agents were withdrawn at
mid-day yesterday and security was
returned to government guards. But
the restrictions on removal of
documents continued.
Doyle said the staff met late last
night and agreed unanimously to
appear for work next week, when they
would be Justice Department
employees.
Doyle said he had talked by
telephone with Cox and that the
former special prosecutor was in
excellent spirits.
He said he knew of no one other
than Cox who had been fired but
added that "some people higher up
will have some difficult decisions to
make."
Transition Seen
And at the White House a
spokesman said he assumed "there
would be a period of transition" but
that whether all the employees of the
former prosecution force would be
kept on at the Justice Department
would have to be decided by

department officials.
Earlier, in an interview, deputy
special prosecutor Henry Ruth said he
thought the Watergate prosecution
would be pursued vigorously in the
Justice Department by Assistant Atty.
Gen. Henry E. Petersen.
"I happen to think Henry Petersen
would proceed vigorously if he is
allowed to do so," said Ruth.
But it was clear Ruth doubted
Petersen would be in a position to
press the White House for evidence in
its files the way Cox had done.
Bork Waits
Further, Acting Atty. Gen. Robert
H. Bork will announce his decision
tomorrow on the future course of the
Watergate investigation, the Justice
Department said yesterday.


ELLIOT RICHARDSON
Bork reached his decision after
meeting with top department officials,
including Assistant Atty. Gen. Henry
E. Petersen, a day after taking
command of a shaken department.
Petersen To Quit?
A knowledgeable source reported
that Petersen himself may consider
resigning, a move he contemplated
earlier this year before Richardson
became attorney general.
Sources reported that a number of
others were weighing the possibility as
a demonstration of support for Elliot
L. Richardson, who resigned Saturday
night rather than bow to Nixon's
command to fire special Watergate
prosecutor Archibald Cox. William D.
Ruckelshaus was fired as deputy
attorney general after refusing the
same order.
Solicitor General Bork then became
acting attorney general and carried out
Nixon's order.
Advisers Resign
Eight top advisers to Richardson
and Ruckelshaus already have
resigned. Other top officials are
reported to have told Richardson they
intend to do so though he has urged
them to stay.

The discussions with Petersen were
believed to involve the future course
of the Watergate investigation,
returned to the Justice Department
after Nixon disbanded Cox's special
prosecution force.
Other Firings Soon?
One knowledgeable source said it
seemed likely that Bork, political
conservative and long-time Nixon
supporter, would fire a number of the
more liberal department officials.
Richardson prepared for a news
conference tomorrow to discuss why
he felt that firing Cox would have
violated his promise to Congress to
guarantee the prosecutor a free hand.

Recent Watergate developments
have precipitated angry reactions from
local political figures. Palo Alto Mayor
Kirk Comstock called President Nixon
a "cheapshot artist," and
Representative Jerome Waldie declared
that Nixon left him "no choice" but
to introduce an impeachment move
when Congress reconvenes on
Tuesday.
Law Prof. John Kaplan stated that
the President's dismissal of Cox does
not terminate legal proceedings to
obtain the Watergate tapes, and he

described a possible scenario. District
Court Judge John Sirica could appoiri
an attorney to represent the grand
jury, in effect, a "new special
prosecutor." This would allow the
grand jury to seek a contempt citation
against the President if he failed to
turn over the tapes.
Acting Atty. Gen. Robert Bork
could then argue that the compromise
reached with the Senate Watergate
Committee had fulfilled the original
dictates of the court.
Sirica would then have to decide
whether to withdraw the request for a
new subpoena or find the President in
contempt. Or, Judge Sirica could
decide that he is "just a judge" and
not appoint a new prosecutor at all.
Outlining possible congressional
action, Kaplan said that there was
ample legal precedent for the
"creation by a new independent
prosecutor" who could proceed with
Cox's investigation.
In either case, Kaplan believes a
"constitutional confrontation" is
likely. Dramatic as the events of the
past few days have been, they may be
only a prelude to a final test of
strength between the President, the
Congress and the courts, he said.

strength between the President, the
Congress and the courts, he said.
WASHINGTON (AP) — Members of
the special Watergate prosecution
force remained determined yesterday
to carry on their investigation of the
Watergate scandal despite a
presidential order abolishing their
office.
Nearly all the attorneys are
expected to stay on with the Justice
Department, a prosecution spokesman

said.
"We are here and we are a criminal
prosecution force and we have reason
to believe serious crimes have been
committed and we are going to
prosecute," James S. Doyle,
spokesman for the office, told
newsmen.
The President announced Saturday
night that he had fired special
Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox
and abolished his office's standing as
an entity virtually independent of the
Justice Department.
Within 30 minutes of the White
House announcement FBI agents
appeared at the prosecution force
offices and prohibited the staff from
removing any documents, including
personal papers, from their files.
FBI Withdrawn
The agents were withdrawn at
mid-day yesterday and security was
returned to government guards. But
the restrictions on removal of
documents continued.
Doyle said the staff met late last
night and agreed unanimously to
appear for work next week, when they
would be Justice Department
employees.
Doyle said he had talked by
telephone with Cox and that the
former special prosecutor was in
excellent spirits.
He said he knew of no one other
than Cox who had been fired but
added that "some people higher up
will have some difficult decisions to
make."
Transition Seen
And at the White House a
spokesman said he assumed "there
would be a period of transition" but
that whether all the employees of the
former prosecution force would be
kept on at the Justice Department
would have to be decided by

department officials.
Earlier, in an interview, deputy
special prosecutor Henry Ruth said he
thought the Watergate prosecution
would be pursued vigorously in the
Justice Department by Assistant Atty.
Gen. Henry E. Petersen.
"I happen to think Henry Petersen
would proceed vigorously if he is
allowed to do so," said Ruth.
But it was clear Ruth doubted
Petersen would be in a position to
press the White House for evidence in
its files the way Cox had done.
Bork Waits
Further, Acting Atty. Gen. Robert
H. Bork will announce his decision
tomorrow on the future course of the
Watergate investigation, the Justice
Department said yesterday.


ELLIOT RICHARDSON
Bork reached his decision after
meeting with top department officials,
including Assistant Atty. Gen. Henry
E. Petersen, a day after taking
command of a shaken department.
Petersen To Quit?
A knowledgeable source reported
that Petersen himself may consider
resigning, a move he contemplated
earlier this year before Richardson
became attorney general.
Sources reported that a number of
others were weighing the possibility as
a demonstration of support for Elliot
L. Richardson, who resigned Saturday
night rather than bow to Nixon's
command to fire special Watergate
prosecutor Archibald Cox. William D.
Ruckelshaus was fired as deputy
attorney general after refusing the
same order.
Solicitor General Bork then became
acting attorney general and carried out
Nixon's order.
Advisers Resign
Eight top advisers to Richardson
and Ruckelshaus already have
resigned. Other top officials are
reported to have told Richardson they
intend to do so though he has urged
them to stay.

The discussions with Petersen were
believed to involve the future course
of the Watergate investigation,
returned to the Justice Department
after Nixon disbanded Cox's special
prosecution force.
Other Firings Soon?
One knowledgeable source said it
seemed likely that Bork, political
conservative and long-time Nixon
supporter, would fire a number of the
more liberal department officials.
Richardson prepared for a news
conference tomorrow to discuss why
he felt that firing Cox would have
violated his promise to Congress to
guarantee the prosecutor a free hand.
* * *
Recent Watergate developments
have precipitated angry reactions from
local political figures. Palo Alto Mayor
Kirk Comstock called President Nixon
a "cheapshot artist," and
Representative Jerome Waldie declared
that Nixon left him "no choice" but
to introduce an impeachment move
when Congress reconvenes on
Tuesday.
Law Prof. John Kaplan stated that
the President's dismissal of Cox does
not terminate legal proceedings to
obtain the Watergate tapes, and he

described a possible scenario. District
Court Judge John Sirica could appoiri
an attorney to represent the grand
jury, in effect, a "new special
prosecutor." This would allow the
grand jury to seek a contempt citation
against the President if he failed to
turn over the tapes.
Acting Atty. Gen. Robert Bork
could then argue that the compromise
reached with the Senate Watergate
Committee had fulfilled the original
dictates of the court.
Sirica would then have to decide
whether to withdraw the request for a
new subpoena or find the President in
contempt. Or, Judge Sirica could
decide that he is "just a judge" and
not appoint a new prosecutor at all.
Outlining possible congressional
action, Kaplan said that there was
ample legal precedent for the
"creation by a new independent
prosecutor" who could proceed with
Cox's investigation.
In either case, Kaplan believes a
"constitutional confrontation" is
likely. Dramatic as the events of the
past few days have been, they may be
only a prelude to a final test of
strength between the President, the
Congress and the courts, he said.

past few days have been, they may be
only a prelude to a final test of
strength between the President, the
Congress and the courts, he said.
WASHINGTON (AP) — Members of
the special Watergate prosecution
force remained determined yesterday
to carry on their investigation of the
Watergate scandal despite a
presidential order abolishing their
office.
Nearly all the attorneys are
expected to stay on with the Justice
Department, a prosecution spokesman

said.
"We are here and we are a criminal
prosecution force and we have reason
to believe serious crimes have been
committed and we are going to
prosecute," James S. Doyle,
spokesman for the office, told
newsmen.
The President announced Saturday
night that he had fired special
Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox
and abolished his office's standing as
an entity virtually independent of the
Justice Department.
Within 30 minutes of the White
House announcement FBI agents
appeared at the prosecution force
offices and prohibited the staff from
removing any documents, including
personal papers, from their files.
FBI Withdrawn
The agents were withdrawn at
mid-day yesterday and security was
returned to government guards. But
the restrictions on removal of
documents continued.
Doyle said the staff met late last
night and agreed unanimously to
appear for work next week, when they
would be Justice Department
employees.
Doyle said he had talked by
telephone with Cox and that the
former special prosecutor was in
excellent spirits.
He said he knew of no one other
than Cox who had been fired but
added that "some people higher up
will have some difficult decisions to
make."
Transition Seen
And at the White House a
spokesman said he assumed "there
would be a period of transition" but
that whether all the employees of the
former prosecution force would be
kept on at the Justice Department
would have to be decided by

department officials.
Earlier, in an interview, deputy
special prosecutor Henry Ruth said he
thought the Watergate prosecution
would be pursued vigorously in the
Justice Department by Assistant Atty.
Gen. Henry E. Petersen.
"I happen to think Henry Petersen
would proceed vigorously if he is
allowed to do so," said Ruth.
But it was clear Ruth doubted
Petersen would be in a position to
press the White House for evidence in
its files the way Cox had done.
Bork Waits
Further, Acting Atty. Gen. Robert
H. Bork will announce his decision
tomorrow on the future course of the
Watergate investigation, the Justice
Department said yesterday.


ELLIOT RICHARDSON
Bork reached his decision after
meeting with top department officials,
including Assistant Atty. Gen. Henry
E. Petersen, a day after taking
command of a shaken department.
Petersen To Quit?
A knowledgeable source reported
that Petersen himself may consider
resigning, a move he contemplated
earlier this year before Richardson
became attorney general.
Sources reported that a number of
others were weighing the possibility as
a demonstration of support for Elliot
L. Richardson, who resigned Saturday
night rather than bow to Nixon's
command to fire special Watergate
prosecutor Archibald Cox. William D.
Ruckelshaus was fired as deputy
attorney general after refusing the
same order.
Solicitor General Bork then became
acting attorney general and carried out
Nixon's order.
Advisers Resign
Eight top advisers to Richardson
and Ruckelshaus already have
resigned. Other top officials are
reported to have told Richardson they
intend to do so though he has urged
them to stay.

The discussions with Petersen were
believed to involve the future course
of the Watergate investigation,
returned to the Justice Department
after Nixon disbanded Cox's special
prosecution force.
Other Firings Soon?
One knowledgeable source said it
seemed likely that Bork, political
conservative and long-time Nixon
supporter, would fire a number of the
more liberal department officials.
Richardson prepared for a news
conference tomorrow to discuss why
he felt that firing Cox would have
violated his promise to Congress to
guarantee the prosecutor a free hand.

Recent Watergate developments
have precipitated angry reactions from
local political figures. Palo Alto Mayor
Kirk Comstock called President Nixon
a "cheapshot artist," and
Representative Jerome Waldie declared
that Nixon left him "no choice" but
to introduce an impeachment move
when Congress reconvenes on
Tuesday.
Law Prof. John Kaplan stated that
the President's dismissal of Cox does
not terminate legal proceedings to
obtain the Watergate tapes, and he

described a possible scenario. District
Court Judge John Sirica could appoiri
an attorney to represent the grand
jury, in effect, a "new special
prosecutor." This would allow the
grand jury to seek a contempt citation
against the President if he failed to
turn over the tapes.
Acting Atty. Gen. Robert Bork
could then argue that the compromise
reached with the Senate Watergate
Committee had fulfilled the original
dictates of the court.
Sirica would then have to decide
whether to withdraw the request for a
new subpoena or find the President in
contempt. Or, Judge Sirica could
decide that he is "just a judge" and
not appoint a new prosecutor at all.
Outlining possible congressional
action, Kaplan said that there was
ample legal precedent for the
"creation by a new independent
prosecutor" who could proceed with
Cox's investigation.
In either case, Kaplan believes a
"constitutional confrontation" is
likely. Dramatic as the events of the
past few days have been, they may be
only a prelude to a final test of
strength between the President, the
