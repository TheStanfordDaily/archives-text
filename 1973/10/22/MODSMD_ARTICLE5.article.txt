# Democrats Consider Impeachment Effort
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)—The chairman of
the powerful House Rules Committee,
Rep. Ray J. Madden, D-Ind., said the
situation has become so serious that
congressional action is necessary, but
he stopped short of recommending
impeachment.
At least five Democrats on the
36-member House Judiciary
Committee said they would support a
move toward impeachment. They
include Rep. Robert F. Drinan of
Massachusetts, who already has
introduced an impeachment
resolution.
"The first question before the
committee is the impeachability of the
President," said Rep. Charles B.

Rangel, D-N.Y. Reps. Don Edwards,
D-Calif., Elizabeth Holtzman, D-N.Y.,
and John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., also
backed their panel's consideration of
the issue.
Rep. John J. McFall of California,
the House Democratic whip, said: "I
suppose we'll have to take a serious
look at impeachment tomorrow,"
when Congress returns from its
Veterans' Day holiday.
Rep. Ogden R. Reid, D-N.Y., a
former Republican who switched
parties a year and a half ago, called for
immediate initiation of impeachment
proceedings, saying: "No president is
above the law," a phrase echoed by
several of Reid's colleagues.
McCloskey Reaction
Meanwhile, Republican
Congressman Paul N. McCloskey said
yesterday that unless President Nixon
resigns, the House of Representatives
will have no choice but to start
impeachment proceedings.
McCloskey said Nixon had violated
the Constitution by ignoring a court
order to turn over the White House
tapes and then firing Special
Prosecutor Archibald Cox, "the only
man who could appeal that refusal."
"He has forced the House either to
bring impeachment proceedings or to
acquiesce in his right to violate a court
order," McCloskey said in a telephone
interview.
Hopes For Resignation
McCloskey, a liberal who opposed
Nixon in the 1972 Republican
primary, said he "hoped Nixon would
resign to spare the country the trauma
of an impeachment.
"But having followed his political
career since he was my congressman in
1946, I haven't seen anything in his
makeup to indicate he would resign as
any honorable man would," he added.
He said Nixon had made a
"masterful political stroke" in acting
during the Middle East crisis. "There
will be a segment of public opinion
that wfll feel the presidency shouldn't
be disturbed at such a critical time,"
he said. "But the importance of
preserving the Constitution is greater."
National Reaction
Also, calls for impeachment
mingled with cries of amazement
yesterday in an emotional outpouring
of reaction from Americans stunned to
learn of the latest government
upheaval in the Watergate tapes
controversy.

scheduled a meeting today to discuss
the possibility of calling for Nixon's
impeachment.

he stopped short of recommending
impeachment.
At least five Democrats on the
36-member House Judiciary
Committee said they would support a
move toward impeachment. They
include Rep. Robert F. Drinan of
Massachusetts, who already has
introduced an impeachment
resolution.
"The first question before the
committee is the impeachability of the
President," said Rep. Charles B.

Rangel, D-N.Y. Reps. Don Edwards,
D-Calif., Elizabeth Holtzman, D-N.Y.,
and John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., also
backed their panel's consideration of
the issue.
Rep. John J. McFall of California,
the House Democratic whip, said: "I
suppose we'll have to take a serious
look at impeachment tomorrow,"
when Congress returns from its
Veterans' Day holiday.
Rep. Ogden R. Reid, D-N.Y., a
former Republican who switched
parties a year and a half ago, called for
immediate initiation of impeachment
proceedings, saying: "No president is
above the law," a phrase echoed by
several of Reid's colleagues.
McCloskey Reaction
Meanwhile, Republican
Congressman Paul N. McCloskey said
yesterday that unless President Nixon
resigns, the House of Representatives
will have no choice but to start
impeachment proceedings.
McCloskey said Nixon had violated
the Constitution by ignoring a court
order to turn over the White House
tapes and then firing Special
Prosecutor Archibald Cox, "the only
man who could appeal that refusal."
"He has forced the House either to
bring impeachment proceedings or to
acquiesce in his right to violate a court
order," McCloskey said in a telephone
interview.
Hopes For Resignation
McCloskey, a liberal who opposed
Nixon in the 1972 Republican
primary, said he "hoped Nixon would
resign to spare the country the trauma
of an impeachment.
"But having followed his political
career since he was my congressman in
1946, I haven't seen anything in his
makeup to indicate he would resign as
any honorable man would," he added.
He said Nixon had made a
"masterful political stroke" in acting
during the Middle East crisis. "There
will be a segment of public opinion
that wfll feel the presidency shouldn't
be disturbed at such a critical time,"
he said. "But the importance of
preserving the Constitution is greater."
National Reaction
Also, calls for impeachment
mingled with cries of amazement
yesterday in an emotional outpouring
of reaction from Americans stunned to
learn of the latest government
upheaval in the Watergate tapes
controversy.
The AFL-CIO executive council
scheduled a meeting today to discuss
the possibility of calling for Nixon's
impeachment.
WASHINGTON (AP)—The chairman of
the powerful House Rules Committee,
Rep. Ray J. Madden, D-Ind., said the
situation has become so serious that
congressional action is necessary, but
he stopped short of recommending
impeachment.
