## Impeachment 
### 
By first refusing to obey a lawful court order, and then
firing Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox and Deputy Atty.
Gen. William Ruckleshaus and forcing the resignation of
Atty. Gen. Elliot Richardson, President Nixon has reached
the limit of our patience.
His actions last week disprove his earlier protestations of
the sanctity of executive privilege, and expose him as
concerned more with his own political interests than with
the survival of the Constitution.
Time and time again, Nixon has attempted to impede
lawful investigations by Cox and the Ervin Committee. On
Friday, he announced that he would ignore a definitive
Appellate Court order to turn the Watergate tape recordings
over to Judge Sirica.
One day later, the President dissolved Cox's special
prosecution force and ordered the scandal-tarnished FBI to
take custody of the force's records.
Nixon has consistently shown little regard for the
integrity of the Constitution he swore in his oath of office
to defend.
He has explicitly and unconstitutionally defied the
judgement of the United States Court of Appeals, arrogating
powers granted to no other citizen or chief executive.
He has implicitly ignored the opinion of the court when
it wrote, "Sovereignty remains at all times with the people
and they do not forfeit through elections the right to have
the law . . . applied to every citizen."
Through both obstruction and inaction, he has subverted
a vitally important criminal investigation.
After pledging to grant Prosecutor Cox nearly complete
independence, he has broken his promise and has halted the
prosecutor's investigation, apparently because it threatened
to draw too close to the source of corruption in this most
corrupt of Administrations.
Congress must act swiftly to uphold the Appellate
Court's finding that the President "is not above the law's
commands." Nixon has shattered his own credibility as a
defender of the Republic. His retention of office jeopardizes
the survival of constitutional government in this nation.
A resolution of impeachment has already been
introduced in the House of Representatives. We call on Rep.
Paul McCloskey to press for its consideration, and we urge
each voter to write his congressman with the same request.
As Archibald Cox said Saturday, "Whether we shall
continue to be a government of laws and not of men is now
for Congress, and ultimately the American people."
