# The 						Constitutional Crisis
## Watergate After Cox: What Next? 
### 
Doyle McManus

"Whether ours shall continue
to be a government of laws and
not of men," Archibald Cox
declared Saturday, "is now for
Congress and ultimately the
American people."
Henry Ruth, one of Cox's staff
attorneys, was more succinct. "If
this were a democracy," Ruth
said, "this wouldn't have
happened."
It is said that the President's
sudden discharge of Watergate
Prosecutor Cox and Attorneys
General Richardson and
Ruckleshaus have plunged the
Republic into a constitutional
crisis. Actually, the crisis, as Cox
implicitly pointed out, is yet to
come.
Tapes
First, of course, are the
infamous tapes. The President has
refused to comply with the
Appeals Court's decision that he
should deliver the tapes to District
Judge Sirica, who would then give
the relevant portions to the grand
jury.
In firing Cox, Mr. Nixon neatly
eliminated the plaintiff who
would have moved for
enforcement of the appellate
judgement. And although Cox's
grand jury has survived him, its
members are unlikely to have the
independence to move for
enforcement themselves.
Instead, the key may lie with
the Senate Select Committee. The
Committee's subpoena was
quashed by the Court of Appeals
on the grounds that its
Congressional mandate was
unclear.
Senators Ervin and Baker
would have little difficulty
obtaining a resolution directing
the Committee to subpoena the
tapes under the present chaotic

circumstances. Whether the
Supreme Court would then agree
to review the Appeals Court
decision against the Committee
remains to be seen.
Compromise
True, Ervin and Baker — after
losing their court appeal — agreed
last week to the President's
proferred compromise of
supplying "summaries" of the
tapes. But circumstances have
changed.
Indeed, there was some
confusion over the precise terms
of the compromise even before
Mr. Nixon's internal coup. "I
suppose we still have an
agreement," Ervin said dubiously,
"but we'll have to see."
Ervin is considering the
establishment of a special
Congressional prosecutor, as was
done during the Teapot Dome
scandal in the twenties.
Alternatively, Congress could
(subject to Presidential veto)
establish a Special Counsel to the
grand jury — a remedy Cox
himself suggested. The counsel, as
an agent of the judiciary, would
be immune to the vicissitudes of
Presidential self-preservation, and
could carry on the grand jury's
investigations as before. There is
precious little precedent for this
sort of thing, but there is precious
little precedent for the whole
monstrous affair.
Impeachment
As usual, there is a lot of talk
of impeachment about. As usual,
it is mostly foolish.
Impeachment will never be a
politically wise course, and the
members of the House are
politicians first, perhaps even unto
the collapse of the Republic.
Impeachment of any President
would require months, perhaps

years.
Impeachment of this
incumbent, who won 60-odd
percent of the vote and who
controls whether the nation is in
crisis or safe, would result sooner
or later in a public backlash
against the impeachers that would
be terrible in its intensity. The
congresspeople know this well;
they may talk big in the next
week, but few will commit
themselves to anything that might
turn out to catch them from
behind.
On these matters, the Congress
has a built-in lack of spine. The
most that will happen is a motion
of censure. More likely is a lot of
noise and indefinite
postponement of the
confirmations of Gerald Ford as
Vice President and — should the
President be dumb enough to
nominate him — our new
Torquemada, the firer of Cox,
Acting Attorney General Robert
H. Bork.
Task Forces
Whatever happens
immediately, Mr. Nixon is in very
deep trouble indeed, and not only
because of the tapes. Archie Cox
had other crusades going on: to
wit, five task forces looking into
the Watergate break-in and
cover-up, the activities of the
übiquitous plumbers, political
espionage, campaign financing
violations, and the still-mysterious
ITT connection.
On Friday, anticipating that
the future might be rough, the
five task force chiefs photocopied
memoranda summarizing the
charges they had planned to bring.
The evidence itself remains in
Cox's office, sealed by the FBI.
But Washington sources say the
copied memos are comparable in

scope to the bill of particulars
that brought former Vice
President Agnew to bay. Cox, in
short, had just begun to fight.
Therein may be a clue to the
violence of the President's
reaction. It seems clear that there
is something on those tapes — Mr.
Nixon is usually more pragmatic
than to expend such energy in
defense of a shaky point of
Executive Privilege for principle's
sake. But it was also in the
President's interest to get
Prosecutor Cox out of the way,
and the tapes provided him an
opportunity.
Ethiop
Cox, of course, has no
intention of staying down. He will
likely deliver his extensive
information to whoever can best
use it. And that, as Mencken
would say, is the Ethiop in the
kindling.
Thus, ironically, we are back
where we were in the spring. The
President is back on the offensive,
and back in trouble too. The
Justice Department, after the fall
of the mad Nixonites Mitchell and
Kleindienst, is back in the hands
of a Rehnquistian ideologue. The
processes of justice are being
fairly stomped.
On the other hand, what
respect Mr. Nixon still
commanded in the spring is now
gone; Congress is likely to be a
good deal less courteous from
now on. For that, at least, we can
stand on tfte sidelines and cheer.

agreement," Ervin said dubiously,
"but we'll have to see."
Ervin is considering the
establishment of a special
Congressional prosecutor, as was
done during the Teapot Dome
scandal in the twenties.
Alternatively, Congress could
(subject to Presidential veto)
establish a Special Counsel to the
grand jury — a remedy Cox
himself suggested. The counsel, as
an agent of the judiciary, would
be immune to the vicissitudes of
Presidential self-preservation, and
could carry on the grand jury's
investigations as before. There is
precious little precedent for this
sort of thing, but there is precious
little precedent for the whole
monstrous affair.
Impeachment
As usual, there is a lot of talk
of impeachment about. As usual,
it is mostly foolish.
Impeachment will never be a
politically wise course, and the
members of the House are
politicians first, perhaps even unto
the collapse of the Republic.
Impeachment of any President
would require months, perhaps

years.
Impeachment of this
incumbent, who won 60-odd
percent of the vote and who
controls whether the nation is in
crisis or safe, would result sooner
or later in a public backlash
against the impeachers that would
be terrible in its intensity. The
congresspeople know this well;
they may talk big in the next
week, but few will commit
themselves to anything that might
turn out to catch them from
behind.
On these matters, the Congress
has a built-in lack of spine. The
most that will happen is a motion
of censure. More likely is a lot of
noise and indefinite
postponement of the
confirmations of Gerald Ford as
Vice President and — should the
President be dumb enough to
nominate him — our new
Torquemada, the firer of Cox,
Acting Attorney General Robert
H. Bork.
Task Forces
Whatever happens
immediately, Mr. Nixon is in very
deep trouble indeed, and not only
because of the tapes. Archie Cox
had other crusades going on: to
wit, five task forces looking into
the Watergate break-in and
cover-up, the activities of the
übiquitous plumbers, political
espionage, campaign financing
violations, and the still-mysterious
ITT connection.
On Friday, anticipating that
the future might be rough, the
five task force chiefs photocopied
memoranda summarizing the
charges they had planned to bring.
The evidence itself remains in
Cox's office, sealed by the FBI.
But Washington sources say the
copied memos are comparable in

scope to the bill of particulars
that brought former Vice
President Agnew to bay. Cox, in
short, had just begun to fight.
Therein may be a clue to the
violence of the President's
reaction. It seems clear that there
is something on those tapes — Mr.
Nixon is usually more pragmatic
than to expend such energy in
defense of a shaky point of
Executive Privilege for principle's
sake. But it was also in the
President's interest to get
Prosecutor Cox out of the way,
and the tapes provided him an
opportunity.
Ethiop
Cox, of course, has no
intention of staying down. He will
likely deliver his extensive
information to whoever can best
use it. And that, as Mencken
would say, is the Ethiop in the
kindling.
Thus, ironically, we are back
where we were in the spring. The
President is back on the offensive,
and back in trouble too. The
Justice Department, after the fall
of the mad Nixonites Mitchell and
Kleindienst, is back in the hands
of a Rehnquistian ideologue. The
processes of justice are being
fairly stomped.
On the other hand, what
respect Mr. Nixon still
commanded in the spring is now
gone; Congress is likely to be a
good deal less courteous from
now on. For that, at least, we can
stand on tfte sidelines and cheer.

"Whether ours shall continue
to be a government of laws and
not of men," Archibald Cox
declared Saturday, "is now for
Congress and ultimately the
American people."
Henry Ruth, one of Cox's staff
attorneys, was more succinct. "If
this were a democracy," Ruth
said, "this wouldn't have
happened."
It is said that the President's
sudden discharge of Watergate
Prosecutor Cox and Attorneys
General Richardson and
Ruckleshaus have plunged the
Republic into a constitutional
crisis. Actually, the crisis, as Cox
implicitly pointed out, is yet to
come.
Tapes
First, of course, are the
infamous tapes. The President has
refused to comply with the
Appeals Court's decision that he
should deliver the tapes to District
Judge Sirica, who would then give
the relevant portions to the grand
jury.
In firing Cox, Mr. Nixon neatly
eliminated the plaintiff who
would have moved for
enforcement of the appellate
judgement. And although Cox's
grand jury has survived him, its
members are unlikely to have the
independence to move for
enforcement themselves.
Instead, the key may lie with
the Senate Select Committee. The
Committee's subpoena was
quashed by the Court of Appeals
on the grounds that its
Congressional mandate was
unclear.
Senators Ervin and Baker
would have little difficulty
obtaining a resolution directing
the Committee to subpoena the
tapes under the present chaotic

circumstances. Whether the
Supreme Court would then agree
to review the Appeals Court
decision against the Committee
remains to be seen.
Compromise
True, Ervin and Baker — after
losing their court appeal — agreed
last week to the President's
proferred compromise of
supplying "summaries" of the
tapes. But circumstances have
changed.
Indeed, there was some
confusion over the precise terms
of the compromise even before
Mr. Nixon's internal coup. "I
suppose we still have an
agreement," Ervin said dubiously,
"but we'll have to see."

had other crusades going on: to
wit, five task forces looking into
the Watergate break-in and
cover-up, the activities of the
übiquitous plumbers, political
espionage, campaign financing
violations, and the still-mysterious
ITT connection.
On Friday, anticipating that
the future might be rough, the
five task force chiefs photocopied
memoranda summarizing the
charges they had planned to bring.
The evidence itself remains in
Cox's office, sealed by the FBI.
But Washington sources say the
copied memos are comparable in

scope to the bill of particulars
that brought former Vice
President Agnew to bay. Cox, in
short, had just begun to fight.
Therein may be a clue to the
violence of the President's
reaction. It seems clear that there
is something on those tapes — Mr.
Nixon is usually more pragmatic
than to expend such energy in
defense of a shaky point of
Executive Privilege for principle's
sake. But it was also in the
President's interest to get
Prosecutor Cox out of the way,
and the tapes provided him an
opportunity.
Ethiop
Cox, of course, has no
intention of staying down. He will
likely deliver his extensive
information to whoever can best
use it. And that, as Mencken
would say, is the Ethiop in the
kindling.
Thus, ironically, we are back
where we were in the spring. The
President is back on the offensive,
and back in trouble too. The
Justice Department, after the fall
of the mad Nixonites Mitchell and
Kleindienst, is back in the hands
of a Rehnquistian ideologue. The
processes of justice are being
fairly stomped.
On the other hand, what
respect Mr. Nixon still
commanded in the spring is now
gone; Congress is likely to be a
good deal less courteous from
now on. For that, at least, we can
stand on tfte sidelines and cheer.

"Whether ours shall continue
to be a government of laws and
not of men," Archibald Cox
declared Saturday, "is now for
Congress and ultimately the
American people."
Henry Ruth, one of Cox's staff
attorneys, was more succinct. "If
this were a democracy," Ruth
said, "this wouldn't have
happened."
It is said that the President's
sudden discharge of Watergate
Prosecutor Cox and Attorneys
General Richardson and
Ruckleshaus have plunged the
Republic into a constitutional
crisis. Actually, the crisis, as Cox
implicitly pointed out, is yet to
come.
Tapes
First, of course, are the
infamous tapes. The President has
refused to comply with the
Appeals Court's decision that he
should deliver the tapes to District
Judge Sirica, who would then give
the relevant portions to the grand
jury.
In firing Cox, Mr. Nixon neatly
eliminated the plaintiff who
would have moved for
enforcement of the appellate
judgement. And although Cox's
grand jury has survived him, its
members are unlikely to have the
independence to move for
enforcement themselves.
Instead, the key may lie with
the Senate Select Committee. The
Committee's subpoena was
quashed by the Court of Appeals
on the grounds that its
Congressional mandate was
unclear.
Senators Ervin and Baker
would have little difficulty
obtaining a resolution directing
the Committee to subpoena the
tapes under the present chaotic

circumstances. Whether the
Supreme Court would then agree
to review the Appeals Court
decision against the Committee
remains to be seen.
Compromise
True, Ervin and Baker — after
losing their court appeal — agreed
last week to the President's
proferred compromise of
supplying "summaries" of the
tapes. But circumstances have
changed.
Indeed, there was some
confusion over the precise terms
of the compromise even before
Mr. Nixon's internal coup. "I
suppose we still have an
agreement," Ervin said dubiously,
"but we'll have to see."
Ervin is considering the
establishment of a special
Congressional prosecutor, as was
done during the Teapot Dome
scandal in the twenties.
Alternatively, Congress could
(subject to Presidential veto)
establish a Special Counsel to the
grand jury — a remedy Cox
himself suggested. The counsel, as
an agent of the judiciary, would
be immune to the vicissitudes of
Presidential self-preservation, and
could carry on the grand jury's
investigations as before. There is
precious little precedent for this
sort of thing, but there is precious
little precedent for the whole
monstrous affair.
Impeachment
As usual, there is a lot of talk
of impeachment about. As usual,
it is mostly foolish.
Impeachment will never be a
politically wise course, and the
members of the House are
politicians first, perhaps even unto
the collapse of the Republic.
Impeachment of any President
would require months, perhaps

years.
Impeachment of this
incumbent, who won 60-odd
percent of the vote and who
controls whether the nation is in
crisis or safe, would result sooner
or later in a public backlash
against the impeachers that would
be terrible in its intensity. The
congresspeople know this well;
they may talk big in the next
week, but few will commit
themselves to anything that might
turn out to catch them from
behind.
On these matters, the Congress
has a built-in lack of spine. The
most that will happen is a motion
of censure. More likely is a lot of
noise and indefinite
postponement of the
confirmations of Gerald Ford as
Vice President and — should the
President be dumb enough to
nominate him — our new
Torquemada, the firer of Cox,
Acting Attorney General Robert
H. Bork.
Task Forces
Whatever happens
immediately, Mr. Nixon is in very
deep trouble indeed, and not only
because of the tapes. Archie Cox
had other crusades going on: to
wit, five task forces looking into
the Watergate break-in and
cover-up, the activities of the
