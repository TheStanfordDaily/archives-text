# Impeachment Rally Draws 400 People
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
About 400 people gathered at
White Plaza yesterday to hear
members of the Palo Alto and
Stanford communities call for the
immediate impeachment of President
Richard Nixon.
ASSU President Kevin o'Grady said
that the purpose of the noon rally was
to "get people working, get people
moving."
The four speakers supplemented
their attacks against Nixon and his
recent handling of the Watergate case
with suggestions of what concerned
citizens could do to assure the
impeachment by the House of
Representatives.
Agnes Robinson, a former Palo
Alto school board member, said that
she was "horrified that I had to say
out loud" that the President should be
impeached. But she said it is a
necessity because Nixon is making a
"shambles" of the democratic process.
'Quite Clear'
Richard Mansfield, president of the
Palo Alto Bar Association, said, "The
President of the United States
has ... made it quite clear to us that
he has decided to set himself above the
law .. . above the people of this
country."
He added that Nixon appears
"amenable" to only one form of
action: impeachment by Congress.
Mansfield said that he is "no longer
willing to settle for less" than a full
and open trial.
Lenny Siegel, director of the Pacific
Studies Center, emphasized the
importance of political pressure.
"Nixon will only be impeached if
enough political power is consolidated
against him."
Siegel suggested that people contact
Stanford Trustee Thomas V. Jones and
Palo Alto industrialist David Packard,
who he claimed have "access to
Richard Nixon." He said that he
hoped these two could be persuaded
to use their influence against the
President.
Telegrams
Siegel urged circulating petitions
and sending lelegrams, and mentioned
rallies and demonstrations as a means
of showing support for impeachment.
Memorial Church Dean Robert
G.H. Kelly outlined potential grounds
for impeachment proceedings, citing
four points raised by Rep. Paul N.
McCloskey Jr., R-Menlo Park, in his
impeachment resolution.
These four points were
authorization of the 1970 Tom
Charles Houston plan to step up illegal
domestic security searches and
wiretaps, the withholding of evidence
from the defense of Daniel Ellsberg,
obstruction of justice, and withholding
the Watergate tapes contrary to court
order.
Following the White Plaza Rally,
committees were formed to help
co-ordinate the impeachment effort,
by methods of mailings, canvassing,
and publicity.
Petitions
Residents of Whitman House said
they have gathered more than 1000
signatures on a petition to the House
Judiciary Committee urging
impeachment.
About 250 people also attended a

Law School meeting to discuss their
response to Nixon's actions.
Participants there urged several steps,
including:
— contacting other law schools in
the rest of the country to get them to
pressure their local congressmen;
— circulating petitions to members
of the local bar association;
— organizing law school protest
demonstrations,
— and working up a legal analysis of
problems that have arisen over the past
weekend.

Studies Center, emphasized the
importance of political pressure.
"Nixon will only be impeached if
enough political power is consolidated
against him."
Siegel suggested that people contact
Stanford Trustee Thomas V. Jones and
Palo Alto industrialist David Packard,
who he claimed have "access to
Richard Nixon." He said that he
hoped these two could be persuaded
to use their influence against the
President.
Telegrams
Siegel urged circulating petitions
and sending lelegrams, and mentioned
rallies and demonstrations as a means
of showing support for impeachment.
Memorial Church Dean Robert
G.H. Kelly outlined potential grounds
for impeachment proceedings, citing
four points raised by Rep. Paul N.
McCloskey Jr., R-Menlo Park, in his
impeachment resolution.
These four points were
authorization of the 1970 Tom
Charles Houston plan to step up illegal
domestic security searches and
wiretaps, the withholding of evidence
from the defense of Daniel Ellsberg,
obstruction of justice, and withholding
the Watergate tapes contrary to court
order.
Following the White Plaza Rally,
committees were formed to help
co-ordinate the impeachment effort,
by methods of mailings, canvassing,
and publicity.
Petitions
Residents of Whitman House said
they have gathered more than 1000
signatures on a petition to the House
Judiciary Committee urging
impeachment.
About 250 people also attended a

Law School meeting to discuss their
response to Nixon's actions.
Participants there urged several steps,
including:
— contacting other law schools in
the rest of the country to get them to
pressure their local congressmen;
— circulating petitions to members
of the local bar association;
— organizing law school protest
demonstrations,
— and working up a legal analysis of
problems that have arisen over the past
weekend.
About 400 people gathered at
White Plaza yesterday to hear
members of the Palo Alto and
Stanford communities call for the
immediate impeachment of President
Richard Nixon.
ASSU President Kevin o'Grady said
that the purpose of the noon rally was
to "get people working, get people
moving."
The four speakers supplemented
their attacks against Nixon and his
recent handling of the Watergate case
with suggestions of what concerned
citizens could do to assure the
impeachment by the House of
Representatives.
Agnes Robinson, a former Palo
Alto school board member, said that
she was "horrified that I had to say
out loud" that the President should be
impeached. But she said it is a
necessity because Nixon is making a
"shambles" of the democratic process.
'Quite Clear'
Richard Mansfield, president of the
Palo Alto Bar Association, said, "The
President of the United States
has ... made it quite clear to us that
he has decided to set himself above the
law .. . above the people of this
country."
He added that Nixon appears
"amenable" to only one form of
action: impeachment by Congress.
Mansfield said that he is "no longer
willing to settle for less" than a full
and open trial.
Lenny Siegel, director of the Pacific
Studies Center, emphasized the
importance of political pressure.
