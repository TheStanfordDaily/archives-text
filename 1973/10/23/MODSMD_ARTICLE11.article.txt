# Keys To Success
## Advice For Nixon 
### 
v Mark Weaver

The following is an excerpt
from a manuscript recently given
to President Nixon by one of his
admirers and which has just come
into my hands. It is marked "Eyes
Only" so J thought I would
publish it for all to see:
Dick,
I have watched your political
career over the years with great
awe and glee, as I too enjoy
controlling the destinies of men.
But I am now despondent over
your Watergate difficulties and so
have undertaken to distill a
number of principles governing
the exercise of power in the hopes
you may profit from them in the
hard days ahead. I know that you
are one of the few people who
will listen to my advice. Or should
I say I am one of the few people
whose advice you will listen to. I
dedicate this book to you.
First and foremost of these
principles and without which all
the others are inoperative, is this:
A president, being concerned with
order and his own survival, is
above ordinary moral rules. This is
the foundation of his power. But
his followers should never be
allowed to know this, for if they
did they would be insulted and
would not follow him.
It is wiser to seem to have
qualities than to actually have
them, for men know only
appearances. And since the nature
of the majority is selfish and
motivated only by its own ego a
president can achieve* his
self-interest by appealing to their
self-interest. Therefore a president
must contrive to make them
believe they are acting in their
own interest when in reality they
are acting in his.
To develop a "Tricky Dicky"
capability a president must find
what the people fear and hate.
Then he can turn it to his own
advantage. Crime is an all-purpose
hate-raiser. Everyone fears crime
and the more you exploit their
fear the more they will think you
have the solution. Fear is easy for
them to understand. They may be
fools, but remember they are your
pawns in the struggle for power.
A president should follow a
course such that his subjects will
always feel the need of his
authority and will therefore
always prove faithful to him.
Remind them only you have all
the facts, so only you are
qualified to decide for them.
You should always demand
that you be called "the President"
instead of Richard Nixon. The

former inspires awe, the latter
does not. Furthermore a president
should strive to display in all his
actions determination, gravity,
courage, and grandeur. I give you
credit for trying, but you know
you do come across as phony.
You'll have to work on that.
Vices leading to ruin are to be
avoided, those which are useful
are to be adopted. In line with
this I applaud your ITT deal, the
Ellsberg burglary, the attempt to
influence Judge Byrne, the
Watergate burglary, the use of the
IRS, FBI, and CIA for political
purposes, the enemies lists, the
fake telegrams supporting the
Haiphong mining, the espionage
against the Democratic
presidential candidates, the secret
bombing of Cambodia, and all
those other things the press did
not find out about.
Unfortunately far too many
tiling got out. A president must
acquire a tight grip on his
underlings. He must lure them
with promotions and raises. He
must make them fear him. When
you have to choose between the
two, it is much more safe to be
feared than to be loved. Love
holds only by a bond of
obligation which is broken on
every occasion when it is in the
interest of the obliged party to
break it. Fear holds the invincible
apprehension of punishment.
With regard to Watergate,
despite all your bumblings you
were astute on the most critical
point — camouflaging your
direction of the cover-up behind
your aides Haldeman, Ehrlichman,
and Mitchell. But you should
never have said anything to Dean
— always confide any information
which can hurt you only in the
two or three men you can trust.
And just keep hoping those three
won't crack if they go to jail.
Power is such that unless you
continue gaining it, you lose it.
Give up the tapes only at the risk
of impeachment.
In short, a president must be
able to assume both that of the
stallion and the snake. He must
appear to be the good white
stallion while in reality he is the
slithering, conniving snake. Only
in this way does he have the best
of both the worlds he needs to lay
claim to the obedience of men. Be
concerned only with the means to
success and failure lest you drown
in the morality that impedes lesser
men.
