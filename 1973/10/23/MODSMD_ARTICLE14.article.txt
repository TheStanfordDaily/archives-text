# On Grounds Of 'Obstructing Justice'
## Waldie Calls For Impeachment 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Rep.
Jerome R. Waldie, D—Calif., said
yesterday that he will introduce a
resolution today to impeach
President Nixon on grounds of
obstructing justice.
Waldie, a member of the House
Judiciary Committee, said he did
not expect an immediate vote on
the resolution, although
technically any member could ask
for such a vote.
He said he understood his
resolution would be referred to
the Judiciary Committee, where
he said he hoped the nomination
of House Minority Leader Gerald
R. Ford for the vice presidency
would be set aside until the
impeachment question is resolved.
Waldie said he had received
more, than 100 telegrams this
mc*ning, all of them asking for
impeachment, and he said there is
"a greater anger in the country
than I have ever seen before in my
public life."
Waldie listed these reasons for
impeachement in his draft
resolution:
—Nixon has defied court orders

to produce tapes and documents
requested by special prosecutor
Archibald Cox relating to the
break-in of the Democratic
headquarters.
—Nixon dismissed Cox and
abolished the office of the special
prosecutor, in violation of the
order which established that
office and contrary to a promise
to the Senate that the prosecutor
would have full authority and
total independence to pursue the

Watergate breakin.
—.. Nixon further has
impeded the administration of
justice by forcing the resignation
of Atty. Gen. Elliot L. Richardson
and by firing Deputy Atty. Gen.
William D. Ruckel&haus because
they refused to participate in the
President's attempts to subvert
the order of the court...
Waldie said he has not taken a
poll of the members of the
Judiciary Committee but said he

expected the majority of them to
go along with an investigation of
the question of impeachment.
"The President is gambling that
the Congress doesn't have the
courage to impeach," Waldie said.
"I think the President will lose
that gamble."
