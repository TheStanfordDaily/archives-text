SACRAMENTO (AP) - Gov. Ronald Reagan
yesterday compared President Nixon's firing of
special prosecutor Archibald Cox with President
Truman's firing of Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur during
the Korean War.
Reagan also urged that the public be patient in
waiting for results of Sen. John Stennis' review of
the President's Watergate tapes.
"I will not comment on the issue of Archibald
Cox being discharged, since it is relatively
unimportant," Reagan siad in a prepared statement.
But the statement continued:
"President Nixon faced the same problem that

confronted President Truman during the Korean
War.
"What is important is that the President has
agreed to make available the pertinent information
contained in the tapes. Now we should all have
patience until the contents of those tapes are made
known," Reagan said in a statement released by his
press office.
Truman relieved Mac Arthur of command during
the Korean War for alleged insubordination, and
Mac Arthur returned to a hero's welcome in the
United States.
