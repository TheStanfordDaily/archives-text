# Johnny Carson At Circle Star
## 'Therapy' Provides Laughs 
### GEORGE DOBBINS 
SAN CARLOS — Call him
Johnny Carson, superstar. Like
mom, apple pie and the flag, he
too ranks as an institution
indigenous to America.
If the age of great performers
truly exists no longer, then
Johnny Carson is an anachronism;
because, although he'll be 48 this
week, his timing, candid quick wit
and poise remain so well tuned
that he could read from a phone
book and make the audience
laugh.
Last Friday night, at San
Carlos' Circle Star Theatre, Carson

didn't quite resort to that, but his
ad libs, pauses and double-takes
were in such top form that
frequently, they made Carson's
ordinary jokes special,
demonstrating to all why Johnny
Carson is this country's most
popular comedian.
Carson has mastered the art of
delivery — he can relax an
audience, put it in the mood to
enjoy and make anything sound
funny. On top of his easygoing
style, he also causes an audience
to identify with his problems,
those being the essential content
of his 60 minute performance.
Carson twice told the audience
during his extended monologue,
"this is great therapy for me,"
later commenting to the press, "I
don't play a role on stage. What
you see there is the real Johnny
Carson."
Perhaps that is the secret of
Carson's success: he makes an
audience believe that what he tells
them is the truth; he is laying it all
on the line. And because he is so
cute, so clever, so devilish, often
so innocent — so much like we all
think of ourselves as being — we
buy every bit of his humor and
even want to learn more about
Carson in the process.
In genius Logistics
The mere logistics of the
Friday night show were in
themselves ingenious. Since 1965,
Carson has been traveling around

the country with "special guest
star" Phyllis McGuire, because she
is a close friend and primarily
because, by going out first, she
can test and get an audience ready
for Carson.
You might think of her as a
filler act, perhaps even a has been
— that is, until you actually listen
to her. Because McGuire, blonde,
clad in a stunning beaded white
dress and appearing very pretty
indeed, really belted out her songs
right on cue and with vigor,
singing Neil Diamond's "Brother
Love's Travelin' Salvation Show"
and Nillson's "Without You"
especially well.
Throughout her part of the
show, not only did she vocalize
well, but she also charmed the
audience with her personality and
sense of humor. And her
performance was just light and
long enough to get everyone
primed for the main attraction.
Main Attraction
Bedecked in an immaculate
tuxedo, meticulously well
groomed and amidst a thousand
screems of "hi-ooo!" durating at
least five minutes, Carson walked
onto the stage, after the familiar
"tonight show" theme announced
his arrival.
"You wonder what I'm going
to do, don't you?" he* asked the
capacity crowd. And they did —
because how could a long
monologue be interesting? But

that ability to hold interest is
what separates the comedians
from the comics, and Carson soon
proved himself an unparalleled
comedian.
Current Events
He decided to fill the audience
in on current events, "just in case
you didn't read the papers."
Carson spoke of Haldeman's new
longer hair ("They finally
removed the bolt from his neck"),
Ehrlichman's ethics ("He looks
like he just sold you aluminum
siding for your house") and
Watergate in general, calling it
"the greatest soap opera ever — as
the White House turns."
While speaking of disaster,
Carson felt compelled to mention
his recent divorce, commenting,
"Some people are good at
marriage and some are good at
making model airplanes. We know
we need you women but there's
not a man here tonight who
understands women." Carson
blamed his lawyer ("I later
discovered he was a lookout at
Pearl Harbor") for having to pay
too much alimony to his last wife:
"She opened a savings and loan
with my first wife."
The Suee
Not only has he been sued for
divorce this year, claimed Carson,
but "this is the year to be sued by
everyone and I is the suee," he
said in his Amos and Andy voice.
In an extremely funny bit,
Carson spoke of three suits
currently pending: The Woodlawn
Mortuary in Nashville, Tenn.,
which recently built a 20 story
high-rise mausoleum with
elevators ("All I said was, how'd
you like to be the elevator
operator calling off the floors and
have somebody tap you on the
shoulder and say, 'down,
please.'"); The Forest Lawn
Cemetery in Los Angeles ("All I
said was I want to die on the
weekend to take advantage of the
special for $39.95. Of course, for
$39.95, they cut out some of the
frills — like a casket — they just
take you to soft ground, stand
you on your tippy toes and drive
you into the ground with a
croquet mallet. And you don't
get a tombstone — they just leave
your hand out -holding a
Bank Americard."); and
Mac Donald's Hamburgers ("All I
said was they have over 12 billion
served — that's quite a remarkable
record — must come to about 50
pounds of meat.")
Upon receiving a standing
ovation, Carson told the audience,
"You make this enjoyable. I don't
even feel like I'm working." But
indeed he was working, making
use of his rare talent that allows
the subtle and complex to appear
obvious and simple.
