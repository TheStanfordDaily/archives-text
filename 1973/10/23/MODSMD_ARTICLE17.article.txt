## Jose's Pizza Is Worth Hunting For 
###

By DAVID THIEMANN
Round Table pizza, which
Stanford students have maligned
and eaten since the early 19605,
has met its match at Jose's Pizza
and Restaurant, an obscure place
at 422 Cambridge Avenue in Palo
Alto.
But in addition to excellent
pizza, Jose's also serves
well-seasoned, carefully-prepared
Mexican, Cuban, and Bolivian
food, as well as good sandwiches.
Jose, the owner and chief cook
as well a$ namesake of the
restaurant, complains often about
people who never explore
anything but his pizza.
Unfortunately, American
diners generally and students
particularly deserve his bad
opinion: they usually order a
single favorite food every time
they eat out, rather than trying
different foods. Don't make this
mistake at Jose's.

But back to the mainstay at
Jose's, pizza. The Round Table
produces medicore pizza for a
profit, with an assembly line
system which would shame Henry
Ford.
Cooking vs. Producing
On the other hand Jose, a
burly Cuban, prepares his own
dough and cooks his pizza. He
shapes a thick, tasty crust, then
adds nicely-seasoned tomato
sauce, a reasonable amount of
cheese (not the Round Table's
elasticized excess), and a surfeit of
goodies on top.
But the price, you ask?
Competitive with the Round
Table, cheaper sometimes.
Slow Service
Service is slow, especially on
pizza orders — don't expect to eat
and run. But Jose offers good
taped and FM music, and
occasional performances by
talented dassical and flamenco

guitarists, especially on Friday
and Saturday nights.
Jose has furnished his
restaurant well, with simple, dark
wood booths and subdue lighting.
Like any beer joint Jose's has a
television .in the corner, but the
owner and patrons have the good
sense to keep it off almost all the
time.
Fine Seasoning
The chili in his tomato sauce
typifies Jose's cooking — he
concentrates on well-blended
seasoning, a neglected art in the
United States.
Sandwiches, as carefully
prepared as the pizza, run from
$.85 to $1.40, but their size and
variety justify the price. If
possible, try the Cuban Bar-B-Q
hamburger.
American Influence
Jose's Mexican and Bolivian
food suffers from a slight

American influence, lacking the
fiery hot seasoning of the real
article. His food tastes good but
not quite authentic, with two
important exceptions: Bolivian
saltenas and stuffed peppers. If
nothing else try these two, which
you probably cannot find
anywhere else.
Jose's is open for lunch on
weekdays, for dinner every night
but Monday — weekdays until 10
p.m., Saturday and Sunday until
midnight.
