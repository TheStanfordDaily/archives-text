# Siegel's 'Charlie Varrick' Proves Better-Than-Average Crime Flick
## 
### GEORGE POWELL 
The cops-and-robbers action
film seems to be the most popular
type of movie being made
nowadays, so every star who
wants to work regularly is going
to end up in one of these sooner
or later.
Even Walter Matthau, who
lately has been more reknown for
his comedic (The Odd Couple)
and dramatic (Pete 'n' Tillie)
roles, has turned bank robber for
"Charlie Varrick."
What makes "Charlie Varrick"
stand out from all the black,
white, private investigator, police,
and Mafia films that have been
flooding the screen is its director,
Don Siegel.
Siegel is the master of the
modern action genre, making
movies like "Madigan" and
"Coogan's Bluff' before crime
movies were big box office. And
who can forget "Dirty Harry,"
which set a high and violent
standard for all action and crime
dramas.
Siegel directed all of these, so
"Charlie Varrick" is simply an
easy run around a familiar track
for him.
Secondary Roles Dominate
Two secondary players do
more for the film than Matthau
does, though, and Siegel realizes it
by giving them nearly equal time
on the screen.
Joe Don Baker is outstanding
as a Mafia hit man, an elegant
sadist whose non-nonsense,
no-compromise interior is masked
by polite Southern gentleman's
exterior. Andy Robinson, the
psychopath from "Dirty Harry,"
is not quite so crazy this time,
playing a Vietnam veteran who
likes to shoot people and has little
use for worrying about tomorrow.
What happens to bring these
two men together with Varrick
and others is a bank robbery,
engineered by Varrick, who is
tired of crop dusting* in New
Mexico for nickels and dimes.
Unexpected Find
But the day Varrick and his
cohorts hit the bank happens to
be the day the bank is being used

as a drop for some of the Mafia's
money. So instead of a few
thousand dollars from the Tres
Cruces bank, Varrick and
company wind up with $750,000.
There are other complications,
too, like Varrick losing his wife
(she drives the get-away car in a
style that would make Evil
Knievel jealous), a bank guard
getting shot, and the
don't-give-a-damn habits of
Varrick's surviving partner
(Robinson).
This basic idea — some robbers
ripping off some Mafia money and
then having both the cops and
Mafia after them — has already
been tried in one movie the past
year, "Across 110 th Street." But
Siegel pulls the competing
elements together more
completely,and builds the suspense
more skillfully.
Personality Lacking
The film's biggest flaw is the
lack of any real personality for
Varrick. Here is a man who plans
and executes a "professional"
robbery on the first try, but loses
his wife, whom he loves dearly, in
the ensuing action. He seems to
stoically accept this much like

Pete in "Pete V Tillie" accepts
the death of his only child.
In fact, Varrick is so super cool
that he gets to roll in the hay with
a corporation secretary simply be
sending her roses and then
bursting into her opulent
apartment.
The most involving thing for
the audience, then, is the action
rather than the main character.
There's plenty of that, but flawed
by the one-dimensional
presentation of local law
enforcement officers as mostly
simple-minded hicks. They trail
along in the wake of Varrick and
Molly, the Mafia hit man, never
getting on top of the case until
the two are already primed for
their showdown, which is
occurring miles away.
Siegel has a tendency to
oversimplify in all his films, but
with the underdevelopment of
Varrick's character, it seemed
more noticeable than in his
previous movies.
But these minor flaws do not
detract significantly from the pace
of film, which for action and
excitement make it one of the
year's best.

the audience, then, is the action
rather than the main character.
There's plenty of that, but flawed
by the one-dimensional
presentation of local law
enforcement officers as mostly
simple-minded hicks. They trail
along in the wake of Varrick and
Molly, the Mafia hit man, never
getting on top of the case until
the two are already primed for
their showdown, which is
occurring miles away.
Siegel has a tendency to
oversimplify in all his films, but
with the underdevelopment of
Varrick's character, it seemed
more noticeable than in his
previous movies.
But these minor flaws do not
detract significantly from the pace
of film, which for action and
excitement make it one of the
year's best.
The cops-and-robbers action
film seems to be the most popular
type of movie being made
nowadays, so every star who
wants to work regularly is going
to end up in one of these sooner
or later.
Even Walter Matthau, who
lately has been more reknown for
his comedic (The Odd Couple)
and dramatic (Pete 'n' Tillie)
roles, has turned bank robber for
"Charlie Varrick."
What makes "Charlie Varrick"
stand out from all the black,
white, private investigator, police,
and Mafia films that have been
flooding the screen is its director,
Don Siegel.
Siegel is the master of the
modern action genre, making
movies like "Madigan" and
"Coogan's Bluff' before crime
movies were big box office. And
who can forget "Dirty Harry,"
which set a high and violent
standard for all action and crime
dramas.
Siegel directed all of these, so
"Charlie Varrick" is simply an
easy run around a familiar track
for him.
Secondary Roles Dominate
Two secondary players do
more for the film than Matthau
does, though, and Siegel realizes it
by giving them nearly equal time
on the screen.
Joe Don Baker is outstanding
as a Mafia hit man, an elegant
sadist whose non-nonsense,
no-compromise interior is masked
by polite Southern gentleman's
exterior. Andy Robinson, the
psychopath from "Dirty Harry,"
is not quite so crazy this time,
playing a Vietnam veteran who
likes to shoot people and has little
use for worrying about tomorrow.
What happens to bring these
two men together with Varrick
and others is a bank robbery,
engineered by Varrick, who is
tired of crop dusting* in New
Mexico for nickels and dimes.
Unexpected Find
But the day Varrick and his
cohorts hit the bank happens to
be the day the bank is being used

as a drop for some of the Mafia's
money. So instead of a few
thousand dollars from the Tres
Cruces bank, Varrick and
company wind up with $750,000.
There are other complications,
too, like Varrick losing his wife
(she drives the get-away car in a
style that would make Evil
Knievel jealous), a bank guard
getting shot, and the
don't-give-a-damn habits of
Varrick's surviving partner
(Robinson).
This basic idea — some robbers
ripping off some Mafia money and
then having both the cops and
Mafia after them — has already
been tried in one movie the past
year, "Across 110 th Street." But
Siegel pulls the competing
elements together more
completely,and builds the suspense
more skillfully.
Personality Lacking
The film's biggest flaw is the
lack of any real personality for
Varrick. Here is a man who plans
and executes a "professional"
robbery on the first try, but loses
his wife, whom he loves dearly, in
the ensuing action. He seems to
stoically accept this much like

Pete in "Pete V Tillie" accepts
the death of his only child.
In fact, Varrick is so super cool
that he gets to roll in the hay with
a corporation secretary simply be
sending her roses and then
bursting into her opulent
apartment.
The most involving thing for
the audience, then, is the action
rather than the main character.
There's plenty of that, but flawed
