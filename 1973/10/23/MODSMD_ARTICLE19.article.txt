# City Center Dance Theater
## Alvin Ailey Troupe Excels 
### CHRIS SHERRY 
The excellent Alvin Ailey City Center Dance
Theater opened its four-night stay at Memorial
Auditorium last Wednesday night and left the
audience on its feet, rocking and cheering. The
dancers were a delight to watch, as they obviously
enjoyed their dancing as much as the audience
enjoyed seeing them.
The program opener, Ailey's Streams, was the
least impressive work of the evening. The music, a
percussive piece by Miloslav Katelac, had a tendency
to be monotonous, and several dance segments,
notably "Lamentoso" and "Aria," dragged in parts.
The piece, a purely technical work without any
story line or message, nonetheless had some brilliant
choreographic ideas. Several parts were
tremendously well-done and innovative, including
Mari rendition of "Recitativo" and the
"Scherzo" of Michichikio Oka and Dudley Williams.
Streams remains a dancer's dance, consisting
primarily of repeated combinations with subtle
variations and relying heavily on spatial patterns.
'Rainbow' A Crowd Pleaser
Donny McKayle's Rainbow Round My Shoulder,
on the other hand, is a super audience pleaser. A
story-drama of men on a chain gang, it is alternately
powerful, funny, and tragic.
Williams as the young dandy and John Parks as
the oppressed worker were both excellent, and Sara
Yaraborough as the Dream was especially good and
versatile. Despite the varied scenes, the dance hangs
together very well, due in large part to the strongly
felt but never blatantly obvious presence of the
male chorus.
It was the old company standard Revelations
that proved to be the highlight of the evening. Done
to traditional spiritual music, it consists of three
segments, each of which illustrate a different quality
of gospel songs. Revelations is one of those
compositions that starts out strong and just gets
better and better.
Each dance has enough interest in itself to stand

alone, and the juxtaposition of the segments is truly
brilliant. Ailey takes us from the dynamic trio
"Didn't My Lord Deliver Daniel" to the
breathtakingly quiet "Fix Me, Jesus," and from the
hypnotizing solo "I Want to Be Ready" to the
thrilling "Sinner Man" which elicits gaps of disbelief
from the audience.
But by far the most memorable part of the work
is "Wading in the Water," due almost entirely to the
magnetic presence of the near-legendary Judith
Jamison. Jamison, who has more vitality and soul in
her little toe than the whole rest of the company
put together, is a constant marvel. She has such a
wonderfully expressive face and her body has such
length and supplcaess that it is hard, almost
impossible to take one's eyes off her.
Choreographically speaking, the program was
good, but it was the spirit of the dancers that
carried the performance. Jamison, Yaraborough,
Williams, and Parks were all outstanding, but several
others merit mention.
Many Strong Dancers
Michichiko Oka is a very hot, very virile
performer, and Estelle Spurlock's energy and
cleanliness of line were admirable. The delicate and
lyric Dana Sapiro, an ex-Joffrey dancer, uses her
musicality and ballet background to full advantage.
The one who stands out most in my mind, however,
is Mari Kajiwara, a very fluid lady whose technical
skill does not overshadow her dramatic talent.
Much of the appeal of Ailey's company lies in
the concept of variety. The dancers have strong
backgrounds in nearly all dance styles and seem to
be able to extract the advantages and beauty of
each. The group is neither a black ballet company
nor a modern nor jazz group but has a quality of its
own: very dynamic, but relaxed, and maybe best of
all, happy.
As a group they can be remarkably tight, both in
technique and feeling. Never afraid of going all out,
they generate and communicate an enthusiasm that
is often lacking in many dance groups.

thrilling "Sinner Man" which elicits gaps of disbelief
from the audience.
But by far the most memorable part of the work
is "Wading in the Water," due almost entirely to the
magnetic presence of the near-legendary Judith
Jamison. Jamison, who has more vitality and soul in
her little toe than the whole rest of the company
put together, is a constant marvel. She has such a
wonderfully expressive face and her body has such
length and supplcaess that it is hard, almost
impossible to take one's eyes off her.
Choreographically speaking, the program was
good, but it was the spirit of the dancers that
carried the performance. Jamison, Yaraborough,
Williams, and Parks were all outstanding, but several
others merit mention.
Many Strong Dancers
Michichiko Oka is a very hot, very virile
performer, and Estelle Spurlock's energy and
cleanliness of line were admirable. The delicate and
lyric Dana Sapiro, an ex-Joffrey dancer, uses her
musicality and ballet background to full advantage.
The one who stands out most in my mind, however,
is Mari Kajiwara, a very fluid lady whose technical
skill does not overshadow her dramatic talent.
Much of the appeal of Ailey's company lies in
the concept of variety. The dancers have strong
backgrounds in nearly all dance styles and seem to
be able to extract the advantages and beauty of
each. The group is neither a black ballet company
nor a modern nor jazz group but has a quality of its
own: very dynamic, but relaxed, and maybe best of
all, happy.
As a group they can be remarkably tight, both in
technique and feeling. Never afraid of going all out,
they generate and communicate an enthusiasm that
is often lacking in many dance groups.
The excellent Alvin Ailey City Center Dance
Theater opened its four-night stay at Memorial
Auditorium last Wednesday night and left the
audience on its feet, rocking and cheering. The
dancers were a delight to watch, as they obviously
enjoyed their dancing as much as the audience
enjoyed seeing them.
The program opener, Ailey's Streams, was the
least impressive work of the evening. The music, a
percussive piece by Miloslav Katelac, had a tendency
to be monotonous, and several dance segments,
notably "Lamentoso" and "Aria," dragged in parts.
The piece, a purely technical work without any
story line or message, nonetheless had some brilliant
choreographic ideas. Several parts were
tremendously well-done and innovative, including
Mari rendition of "Recitativo" and the
"Scherzo" of Michichikio Oka and Dudley Williams.
Streams remains a dancer's dance, consisting
primarily of repeated combinations with subtle
variations and relying heavily on spatial patterns.
'Rainbow' A Crowd Pleaser
Donny McKayle's Rainbow Round My Shoulder,
on the other hand, is a super audience pleaser. A
story-drama of men on a chain gang, it is alternately
powerful, funny, and tragic.
Williams as the young dandy and John Parks as
the oppressed worker were both excellent, and Sara
Yaraborough as the Dream was especially good and
versatile. Despite the varied scenes, the dance hangs
together very well, due in large part to the strongly
felt but never blatantly obvious presence of the
male chorus.
It was the old company standard Revelations
that proved to be the highlight of the evening. Done
to traditional spiritual music, it consists of three
segments, each of which illustrate a different quality
of gospel songs. Revelations is one of those
compositions that starts out strong and just gets
better and better.
Each dance has enough interest in itself to stand

alone, and the juxtaposition of the segments is truly
brilliant. Ailey takes us from the dynamic trio
"Didn't My Lord Deliver Daniel" to the
breathtakingly quiet "Fix Me, Jesus," and from the
hypnotizing solo "I Want to Be Ready" to the
thrilling "Sinner Man" which elicits gaps of disbelief
from the audience.
