# Cease-Fire Into Effect In Sinai; Suez Truce Violations Reported
## 
### 
From The Associated Press
Egypt and Israel ordered their armies to quit shooting
yesterday in compliance with a United Nations Security
Council call for a cease-fire in the 17-day war.
Syria did not respond to the U.N. appeal and fighting
was reported continuing on both fronts hours after the
truce took effect.
Israel charged that Egyptian guns were firing on its
troops at various points along the Suez Canal battle lines
early this morning, six hours after the cease-fire deadline
passed.
Egypt Denies
Egyptian broadcasts denied Israeli claims of violations.
A military spokesman was quoted as saying Egyptian
troops complied with the call for a 6:50 p.m. shooting
halt, and that Israel's charges were "a pretext to violate
the cease-fire."
The latest Israeli communique, issued shortly before 1
a.m. today, said: "The cease-fire is not being observed on
most sectors of the Egyptian theater." Israel accused
Egypt of firing on its forces Monday night, after the
cease-fire deadline.
AP Special Correspondent Hugh A. Mulligan reported
from an Israeli position on the west bank of the Suez
Canal that a great volley of gunfire erupted minutes after
the truce took effect.
Damascus Silent
The Tel Aviv command said Egyptians were using
"various types of weapons." It did not say if Israeli forces
were returning the fire.
Egypt and Israel accepted the Security Council truce
call in the morning hours, but Damascus was keeping
silent on whether Syria would comply.
An Israeli spokesman said: "There is no cease-fire on
the Syrian front," and Israeli and Syrian communiques
said fighting continued.
Earlier, Israel claimed it seized a strategic artillery
position in bloody hand-to-hand fighting on the slopes of
Mt. Hermon, the mountain towering over the Syrian
battleground.
Observers in southern Lebanon, near the area, said the
sounds of fighting on Mt. Hermon died out just before the

cease-fire deadline.
Associated Press correspondent Alex Efty reported in
Damascus that artillery flashes, visible every night of the
war to the south of the Syrian capital, were not observed
last night.
Palestinian guerrillas have said they would not comply
with the U.N. call for a cease-fire.
Iraq, the major Arab nation fighting with the Syrians,
rejected the cease-fire outright and Jordan, with a small
force deployed on the Syrian front, said it would accept
the truce if Syria agreed.
Hinges On Good Faith
In New York, U.N. officials said the success of the
cease-fire and an eventual peace settlement hinged on the
good faith of the Arabs and the Israelis and on further
action by the Security Council.
The truce was jointly proposed by the Soviet Union
and the United States, the superpowers backing the
warring parties. It was voted in the Security Council early
yesterday after an agreement worked out in Moscow over
the weekend by Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and
Soviet Communist party leader Leonid I. Brezhnev.
In addition to the cease-fire in place, it called for Israeli
withdrawal from Jordanian, Egyptian and Syrian land
captured in the six-day war of 1967 and negotiations
aimed at a lasting peace agreement for the Middle East,
site of four wars since the Jewish state was declared in
1948.
Kissinger Arrives
The Syrian delay in accepting the cease-fire, if it
continues, could undermine efforts to carry out the post
cease-fire portions of the agreement.
Kissinger stopped in Israel briefly yesterday on his way
home from Moscow to confer with Premier Golda Meir
and other Israeli leaders, presumably to fill them in on the
subsequent steps intended in his accord with Brezhnev.
The cease-fire came with the Israelis claiming a net gain
of about 1115 square miles of Arab land over the truce
lines settled on at the close of the 1967 Middle East war.
This additional occupation constituted a strong trump
for peace negotiations called for in the Security Council
resolution.
