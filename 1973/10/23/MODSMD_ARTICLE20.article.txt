of the greatest musicians of all time and the greatest
cellist. He was a strong example of humanity at its

Rebozo Files Disappear
WASHINGTON — The FBI reportedly is
investigating the disappearance of a confidential
federal file on the Florida savings and loan
association run by associates of Charles G. "Bebe"
Rebozo.
The Baltimore Sun reported in yesterday's
edition that the documents are missing from the
offices of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and
that the board reported the incident to the FBI.
An FBI spokesman confirmed that an
investigation was under way of missing board
documents. But the spokesman said he did not
know if they related to the savings and loan
association run by Rebozo's associates.
Rebozo is a Key Biscayne neighbor and close
friend of President Nixon.
The Sun quoted a bank board spokesman as
saying one of the documents was a report involving
the application by the association — the Key
Biscayne Savings and Loan Association — for federal
deposit insurance.
The board approved the insurance application
last July 18 after first rejecting it. This turnabout is
currently being investigated by the House Banking
Committee to determine if Rebozo used his

influence with the administration to swing the
approval.

LA PAZ, Bolivia — Four guerrillas who hijacked

Beaty Suspects Indicted
PHOENIX, Ariz. — A conspiracy charge has been
added to indictments returned against three
Arizonans allegedly connected with an escape which
left one California prison guard dead and another

a supplemental indictment returned recently against
Dr. Harry Bishara, 27, his wife, Lorainne, also 27,
and Stanford law school graduate Michael
Goldstein, 30, all of Ft. Defiance, Ariz.
The three will now stand trial here Dec. 11 on
the original charge of harboring a fugitive and the

The three allegedly were connected with the
1972 escape of Ronald W. Beaty from the California
Institution for Men in Chino.
Andrea Holman Burt, daughter of Med Center
Prof. Halsted Holman, and Benton Douglas Burt
were convicted last summer of second-degree
murder, assault with a deadly weapon, and rescuing
a prisoner in the Beaty escape.
Beaty, 35, was later apprehended and sentenced
to life in prison after pleading guilty to murder in
the am bush-escape.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation alleges that
Beaty stayed briefly with the Bisharas after his
escape and that Goldstein knew of his whereabouts.

Gerald R. Ford says he hopes his confirmation
won't be delayed because of congressional
displeasure over President Nixon's firing of special
Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox.
But some members of Congress are calling for
slowing down action on Ford's nomination —
possibly long enough to give Congress a chance to
investigate the possibility of impeaching Nixon.
"I think that action on the confirmation will

po6ed by the ouster of Cox and the resignation of
Atty. Gen. Elliot L. Richardson, said Sen. Edmund

Meany Opts For Agreement
MIAMI BEACH - AFO-CIO President George
Meany expressed hope yesterday of soon bringing to
"final consummation" a tentative agreement for
settling a jurisdictional fight between the Teamsters
and Cesar Chavez's AFL-CIO United Farm Workers.
"At the moment, the matter is in a state of
flux," Meany said in a report to the AFL-CIO
convention.
"I understand the Teamsters executive board is
meeting in a week ... we have been in touch with
their West Coast representative and are hopeful to
bring that agreement to final consummation," he
said.
The tentative peace pact, announced Sept. 28 by
Meany and Teamsters President Frank E.
Fitzsimmons, called for the Teamsters to abrogate
all contracts with California grape growers and to
leave eventual representation of all field hands to
Chavez's union.
The Teamsters would retain jurisdiction over all
other workers, such as those in canneries and
warehouses.
Gale Winds Baiter Bay Area
SAN FRANCISCO — Winds of gale force
battered the San Francisco Bay area last night,
hurtling an AC Transit bus against a Bay Bridge
guard rail, knocking down power lines, and ripping
shingles from a 31-story downtown building.
The California Highway Patrol advised motorists
to stay off both the Golden Gate Bridge and the San
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. An AC Transit bus
on the Bay Bridge was blown into a guard rail but
caused no injuries, officers said.
The CHP and the San Francisco police reported
numerous traffic accidents, inoperative traffic lights
and toppled trees. No injuries were immediately
reported, however.
The National Weather Service at San Francisco
Airport reported winds gusting up to 40 miles per
hour. A spokesman said winds of over 38 miles an
hour are considered of gale force.
The weatherman predicted more rain throughout
Northern California Tuesday, tapering off with
showers and partly cloudy skies. Snow levels are
expected to drop to 6000 feet in the northern Sierra
Nevadas.
A series of storms moving in from the Pacific are
expected to bring intermittent showers to Northern
California later this week, the weather service said.

Arizonans allegedly connected with an escape which
left one California prison guard dead and another
wounded last year.
N. Warner Lee, assistant U.S. attorney here, said
yesterday the federal grand jury added the charge in
a supplemental indictment returned recently against
Dr. Harry Bishara, 27, his wife, Lorainne, also 27,
and Stanford law school graduate Michael
Goldstein, 30, all of Ft. Defiance, Ariz.
The three will now stand trial here Dec. 11 on
the original charge of harboring a fugitive and the
new one of conspiracy to harbor a fugitive.
The three allegedly were connected with the
1972 escape of Ronald W. Beaty from the California
Institution for Men in Chino.
Andrea Holman Burt, daughter of Med Center
Prof. Halsted Holman, and Benton Douglas Burt
were convicted last summer of second-degree
murder, assault with a deadly weapon, and rescuing
a prisoner in the Beaty escape.
Beaty, 35, was later apprehended and sentenced
to life in prison after pleading guilty to murder in
the am bush-escape.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation alleges that
Beaty stayed briefly with the Bisharas after his
escape and that Goldstein knew of his whereabouts.
Billy Graham Voices Concern
MILWAUKEE, Wis. — President Richard Nixon
needs "the help of the Lord" during the current
Watergate crisis, says the Rev. Billy Graham,
evangelist and friend of the President.
"I'm not going to get into that," he said when
asked if he would counsel the President to resign.
"I'm not capable of analyzing such judgments and
constitutional questions."
"Both he and Sen. Sam Ervin are long-time
friends of mine. They need the help of the Lord."
Ervin, D-N.C., is chairman of the Senate
Watergate committee.
Graham said the nation may be in its greatest
crisis since the Civil War. Then, Graham said,
President Lincoln called the nation to prayer.
Gerald Ford Worried
WASHINGTON — Vice president-designate
Gerald R. Ford says he hopes his confirmation
won't be delayed because of congressional
displeasure over President Nixon's firing of special
Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox.
But some members of Congress are calling for
slowing down action on Ford's nomination —
possibly long enough to give Congress a chance to
investigate the possibility of impeaching Nixon.
"I think that action on the confirmation will
understandably be delayed as the Congress and the
country wait the crystalization of the new issues"

* S
po6ed by the ouster of Cox and the resignation of
Atty. Gen. Elliot L. Richardson, said Sen. Edmund
S. Muskie.
Rep. Clarence D. Long, D-Md., said holding up
Ford's nomination "would bitterly divide the
country," since that would mean, if Nixon were
impeached, a Democrat, House Speaker Carl Albert,
would become president.
Meanwhile Ford, through an aide, issued this
statement: "I don't think the two matters are
directly connected."
Meany Opts For Agreement
MIAMI BEACH - AFO-CIO President George
Meany expressed hope yesterday of soon bringing to
"final consummation" a tentative agreement for
settling a jurisdictional fight between the Teamsters
and Cesar Chavez's AFL-CIO United Farm Workers.
"At the moment, the matter is in a state of
flux," Meany said in a report to the AFL-CIO
convention.
"I understand the Teamsters executive board is
meeting in a week ... we have been in touch with
their West Coast representative and are hopeful to
bring that agreement to final consummation," he
said.
The tentative peace pact, announced Sept. 28 by
Meany and Teamsters President Frank E.
Fitzsimmons, called for the Teamsters to abrogate
all contracts with California grape growers and to
leave eventual representation of all field hands to
Chavez's union.
The Teamsters would retain jurisdiction over all
other workers, such as those in canneries and
warehouses.
Gale Winds Baiter Bay Area
SAN FRANCISCO — Winds of gale force
battered the San Francisco Bay area last night,
hurtling an AC Transit bus against a Bay Bridge
guard rail, knocking down power lines, and ripping
shingles from a 31-story downtown building.
The California Highway Patrol advised motorists
to stay off both the Golden Gate Bridge and the San
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. An AC Transit bus
on the Bay Bridge was blown into a guard rail but
caused no injuries, officers said.
The CHP and the San Francisco police reported
numerous traffic accidents, inoperative traffic lights
and toppled trees. No injuries were immediately
reported, however.
The National Weather Service at San Francisco
Airport reported winds gusting up to 40 miles per
hour. A spokesman said winds of over 38 miles an
hour are considered of gale force.
The weatherman predicted more rain throughout
Northern California Tuesday, tapering off with
showers and partly cloudy skies. Snow levels are
expected to drop to 6000 feet in the northern Sierra
Nevadas.
A series of storms moving in from the Pacific are
expected to bring intermittent showers to Northern
California later this week, the weather service said.
Cellist Pablo Casals Dies
SAN JUAN, P.R. — Pablo Casals, the world
renowned cellist who used his musical genius as an
instrument of protest against tyranny, died
yesterday at the age of 96.
His 36-year-old wife Martita was at his bedside.
Casals entered Auxilio Mutuo Hospital three
weeks ago after suffering a heart seizure. Doctors
said he also suffered from chronic bronchitis, a
kidney failure, high fever and circulatory ailments.
The world of music, which had acclaimed him
the greatest cellist of his time, paid tribute to his
memory.
Said Russia's Mstislav Rostropovich, considered
the best cellist since Casals was in his prime: "I have
lost not only a great teacher but a true friend. I feel
a great personal grief."
Eugene Ormandy, music director of the
Philadelphia Orchestra, said: "Pablo Casals was one
of the greatest musicians of all time and the greatest
cellist. He was a strong example of humanity at its
finest and most vital.
"His love of people was probably the reason for
his rich and long life. His passing is a tremendous
loss to the world of music and a great personal loss
to my wife and myself."
UAW Threatens Ford Strike
DEARBORN, Mich. — The United Auto Workers
authorized its 185,000 Ford workers to strike the
auto maker Friday if a new national contract hasn't
been negotiated by 10 a.m. that day.
UAW Vice President Ken Bannon made the
announcement today at Ford headquarters shortly
after he served the nation's second largest auto
maker with the deadline notification.
Union President Leonard Woodcock warned
Ford more than two weeks ago that the imion
would set the deadline if a settlement was not
reached by noon today.
Under the agreement extending the union's old
contract, which expired Sept. 14, the union had to
give Ford three days notice it was canceling the
extension.
Rebozo Files Disappear
WASHINGTON — The FBI reportedly is
investigating the disappearance of a confidential
federal file on the Florida savings and loan
association run by associates of Charles G. "Bebe"
Rebozo.
The Baltimore Sun reported in yesterday's
edition that the documents are missing from the
offices of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and
that the board reported the incident to the FBI.
An FBI spokesman confirmed that an
investigation was under way of missing board
documents. But the spokesman said he did not
know if they related to the savings and loan
association run by Rebozo's associates.
Rebozo is a Key Biscayne neighbor and close
friend of President Nixon.
The Sun quoted a bank board spokesman as
saying one of the documents was a report involving
the application by the association — the Key
Biscayne Savings and Loan Association — for federal
deposit insurance.
The board approved the insurance application
last July 18 after first rejecting it. This turnabout is
currently being investigated by the House Banking
Committee to determine if Rebozo used his

influence with the administration to swing the
approval.
Guerrilla Hijackers Give Up
LA PAZ, Bolivia — Four guerrillas who hijacked
