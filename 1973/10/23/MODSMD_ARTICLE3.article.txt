# Inouye, AFL-CIO Ask For Nixon Resignation Move
## 
### 
From The Associated Press
Delegates to the AFL-CIO
convention approved a resolution
yesterday urging President Nixon to
resign and said Congress should
impeach him if he does not leave
office voluntarily.
Soon after the 2000 delegates
acted, Sen. Daniel K. Inouye,
D-Hawaii, told the group that Nixon
should quit to spare the nation a major
constitutional crisis of impeachment
which "seems imminent."
"Our President openly defies our
courts and he has placed himself above
the law," said Inouye, the first
member of the Senate Watergate
committee to call for Nixon's
resignation.
Fists Pound In Favor
The delegates, some pounding
tables with their fists, shouted their
approval of the resolution presented
by the 32-member executive council
of the 13.4-million-member labor
federation.
Not a single voice of dissent was
heard in the huge meeting room of the
Americana Hotel as the vote was
taken.
The AFL-CIO, which last year
aided in Nixon's re-election by

officially remaining neutral in the
presidential campaign, was the first
major organization with political clout
to call for Nixon's ouster.
'People Have Had Enough'
"Impeachment is not a prospect we
contemplete with pleasure," said
federation President George Meany in
reading the resolution to the
convention. But, he added, "We
believe that the American people have
had enough."
"Justice must be done, the risks of
not doing it being more than a
democracy can safely bear," the
resolution said.

Former attorney General Elliot
Richardson has scheduled a press
conference this morning. The
conference will be carried live on the
major television networks at 8 a.m.
PDT.

In his speech, Inouye said Nixon
should "place our national interest and
welfare above all other concerns" and
resign.
"The people of the United States
have suffered enough," he said. "They
must be spared this new pain and
trauma" that would result from an

impeachment proceeding.
'Nixon Tears Spirit'
The events of the past 48 hours,
Inouye said, show "that our President
is prepared to tear apart the national
spirit and national system to protect
himself and his tapes."
He referred to White House tapes
pertaining to Watergate. The President,
citing executive privilege, has refused
to release the tapes, despite a court
order directing him to turn them over
for judicial review.
The nation is "stunned and
numbed" by the President's actions,
Inouye said, adding: "This numbness
could well progress into dangerous
anger."
Albert President?
The senator suggested that if House
Speaker Carl Albert, next in the line of
succession, should become President
that he appoint as his vice president a
Republican of "high caliber," and
named Richardson or New York Gov.
Nelson Rockefeller as possibilities.
Meanwhile, House Speaker Albert
and other congressional leaders
worked on plans for how to proceed
with impeachment resolutions
promised by angry members in the
wake of Nixon's firing Saturday night
of special Watergate prosecutor
Archibald Cox.
Nixon, first at the White House and
then at his Camp David, Md., retreat,
considered using a televised speech to
present his side of the case to the
nation.
Acting Attorney General Robert H.
Bork said the staff and evidence
assembled by Cox would be used to
pursue the Watergate probe. He put
the investigation under the supervision
of Henry E. Petersen, the assistant
attorney general in charge of the
criminal division.
Bork said he retains "ultimate
authority and responsibility" for the
investigation. When Nixon fired Cox,
he also abolished the office of special
prosecutor, which had handled the
case since May.
While White House aides sought to
mollify critical senators and
congressmen with explanations of
Nixon's action, criticism of the move
continued to pile up — a significant
amount of it from Republicans.

From The Associated Press
Delegates to the AFL-CIO
convention approved a resolution
yesterday urging President Nixon to
resign and said Congress should
impeach him if he does not leave
office voluntarily.
Soon after the 2000 delegates
acted, Sen. Daniel K. Inouye,
D-Hawaii, told the group that Nixon
should quit to spare the nation a major
constitutional crisis of impeachment
which "seems imminent."
"Our President openly defies our
courts and he has placed himself above
the law," said Inouye, the first
member of the Senate Watergate
committee to call for Nixon's
resignation.
Fists Pound In Favor
The delegates, some pounding
tables with their fists, shouted their
approval of the resolution presented
by the 32-member executive council
of the 13.4-million-member labor
federation.
Not a single voice of dissent was
heard in the huge meeting room of the
Americana Hotel as the vote was
taken.
The AFL-CIO, which last year
aided in Nixon's re-election by

officially remaining neutral in the
presidential campaign, was the first
major organization with political clout
to call for Nixon's ouster.
'People Have Had Enough'
"Impeachment is not a prospect we
contemplete with pleasure," said
federation President George Meany in
reading the resolution to the
convention. But, he added, "We
believe that the American people have
had enough."
"Justice must be done, the risks of
not doing it being more than a
democracy can safely bear," the
resolution said.

Former attorney General Elliot
Richardson has scheduled a press
conference this morning. The
conference will be carried live on the
major television networks at 8 a.m.
PDT.

In his speech, Inouye said Nixon
should "place our national interest and
welfare above all other concerns" and
resign.
"The people of the United States
have suffered enough," he said. "They
must be spared this new pain and
trauma" that would result from an

impeachment proceeding.
'Nixon Tears Spirit'
The events of the past 48 hours,
Inouye said, show "that our President
is prepared to tear apart the national
spirit and national system to protect
himself and his tapes."
He referred to White House tapes
pertaining to Watergate. The President,
citing executive privilege, has refused
to release the tapes, despite a court
order directing him to turn them over
for judicial review.
The nation is "stunned and
numbed" by the President's actions,
Inouye said, adding: "This numbness
could well progress into dangerous
anger."
Albert President?
The senator suggested that if House
Speaker Carl Albert, next in the line of
succession, should become President
that he appoint as his vice president a
Republican of "high caliber," and
named Richardson or New York Gov.
Nelson Rockefeller as possibilities.
Meanwhile, House Speaker Albert
and other congressional leaders
worked on plans for how to proceed
