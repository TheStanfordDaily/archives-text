# Engineering Favored
## Report Shows Admission Preference 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
An Academic Planning Office
report confirms that preference in
undergraduate admissions here is given
to applicants in engineering.
The report, completed in June but
never generally released, gives the
fullest publicly available picture of
Stanford's freshman admissions and
financial aids process.
Based on an extensive statistical
study of applicants, 'admittees,' and
'enrollees' for the class that entered in
September 1972, it reveals that:
— Almost 32 percent of all
candidates who complete their
applications are offered admission —
considerably more than generally
believed. Of those admitted, about 62
percent actually enroll.
'Middle-Income Squeeze'
— There is "little trend towards the
exclusion of a middle-income group at
the application stage," but there are
indications of a "middle-income
squeeze" at the point of enrollment.
— The University's "competitive
position vis-a-vis the University of
California is good, despite fears and
rumors to the contrary." Only 15
percent of those accepted here who
enroll elsewhere do so at a UC campus.
— Black applicants are accepted less

often than applicants overall.
Twenty-nine percent of the black
applicants in 1972 were offered
admission, compared to a total figure
of 32 percent.
Hargadon Disputes Figures
Admissions Dean Fred Hargadon
contests the last figure. "We admit
roughly 40 percent of all black
candidates who complete
applications," Hargadon said. "For all
applications, the figure is closer to 25
percent, not 32. I really don't know
where they got those figures."
But Philip Curry of the Provost's
office, who worked on the report,
disputed Hargadon's statistics. "He's
working from an applicant pool of
9000, not the 7617 who actually
completed their applications," Curry
said. "If [the Admissions Office] gets
more than a name and address, they
count it as an application."
The report also details the
following, less surprising, facts:
— There is a conscious and
clearly-articulated policy "of
supporting the undergraduate
engineering programs by giving
preference (other things being equal)
to candiates who evidence a strong
interest in engineering." About 47
percent of such candidates are offered

admission, compared to the overall
figure of 32 percent.
High-Status Backgrounds
— Stanford applicants tend to come
from high-status backgrounds both in
terms of their father's occupations and
their family incomes. Seventy-four
percent of all applicants and enrollees
claim fathers in "professional" or
"managerial" occupations.
— Between 1966 and 1972, the
social class composition of entering
classes changed significantly: enrolling
freshmen with "professional" fathers
increased by 44 percent, while those
whose fathers fell into the more
middle-class "managerial" and
"clerical/sales" categories declined by

almost 25 percent.
— A clear preference, "other things
being equal," is given to applicants
whose parents attended Stanford.
About 44 percent of the candidates
whose fathers attended Stanford are
offered admission, compared with 32
percent of all those who complete
applications.
Lowest-Ranking Admittees
— Admitted applicants with high
academic ratings are less likely to
enroll than those with low ratings.
"While 78 percent of our
lowest-ranking admittees choose to
come," the report states ruefully,
"only 43 percent of thy
highest-ranking likewise do so."
Of those "admittees" who enroll
elsewhere, 13 percent enroll at
Harvard, five percent at Radcliffe; 10
percent at Yale; seven percent at
Princeton; five percent at MIT. Only
25 percent enroU at public colleges
and universities.
Hargadon Critical
Hargadon was mildly critical of the
report. "It's not conclusive," he said.

"This year, we hope to have them
refine the examination of [groups with
low enrollment rates] to include a
geographical breakdown."
Low enrollment rates among
certain middle-income groups "seem
to be a multiple effect — we just can't
get a handle on it None of us can
put a finger on a loss from out student
bodies because of the middle-income
thing."
