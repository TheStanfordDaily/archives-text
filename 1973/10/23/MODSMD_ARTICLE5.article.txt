# L.A. Mayor Blasts Nixon Action; Calls For Defeat Of Tax Drive
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN 
Los Angeles Mayor Thomas Bradley
yesterday blasted President Nixon's
dismissal of special Watergate
prosecutor Archibald Cox and Nixon's
refusal to release the Watergate tapes
as "the gravest kind of arrogance ever
seen in public office."
Speaking at the Cabana Hyatt
House in Palo Alto, Bradley said
Nixon's actions last Saturday would
"in all probability force Congress to
take the action of impeachment"
because "we cannot have any man
believe he stands above the law."
By not releasing the tapes Nixon
has violated a court order preventing
the cover-up of "perjury and high
crimes by high officials in the
government," the mayor said.
Bradley also urged the audience of
about 150 persons to vote against Gov.
Ronald Reagan's controversial tax
initiative Prop. 1, which would place a
constitutional limit on state taxes and
expenditures.
Bradley refused to wholeheartedly
endorse Nixon's impeachment because
of what he called its "traumatic,
almost devastating effect on the
country."
Survive
"We in the nation will survive
[impeachment], but we will not come
out with our colors flying. Our spirits
will be drooping, but overcome it we
must," he said.
Bradley said he "prayed that the
President will come to his senses" and
obey the mandate of the courts to
turn over the Watergate tapes.
"Somehow, the message must get
across to the President that everybody
must be held accountable to the law.
The courts represent the one branch of
government preeminent in laying
down the law of the land," Bradley
said.
Turning to pressing state issues,
Bradley criticized Prop. 1 for being
"so inflexible that it will not meet the
needs of the future." He said that in
return for a small savings on this year's
state tax bill, taxpayers might lose
many vital governmental services.
"If the state is limited" in its taxing

power, "the costs will be shifted down
to the counties, cities and boards of
education," Bradley said.
No Services
This shift would result in the loss of
services such as health care, law
enforcement, education and
employment or would further burden
the property owner who is "already
overburdened with property taxes,"
the mayor claimed.
Bradley said the propositions would
immediately threaten state water
works projects and the state university
and colleges system, "the best program
of higher education in the nation."
He attacked the proposition's
provision of only a $4 rebate to a

family of four with an annual income
of $7500. A similar family with an
income of $50,000 would receive
"some $500" according to Bradley.
He questioned the fairness of "a
proposition that gives a bigger break to
the rich."
$25 Million
Bradley also lashed out at Reagan
who he said is costing the state $25 to
$30 million by requesting the tax
initiative be placed on the Nov. 6
ballot. The state could save that
money if Prop. 1 were included in
either the June or November 1974
elections, he suggested.
Bradley strongly supported control
