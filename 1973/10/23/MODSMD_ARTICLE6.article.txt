# Emotions Cloud Facts
## Relf Crisis Needs Analysis 
### 
1 William Shockley

(This is the first article of a
two-part series.)
Twelve year old Mary Alice
Relf, born with a shortened right
arm and no hand,
men tally-retarded with a speech
impediment, and her allegedly
also retarded fourteen year old
sister Minnie were surgically
sterilized by tubal ligation on
June 14, 1973 in Montgomery,
Alabama. These were the two
youngest of seven children
family that had been on welfare
for more than twenty years.
The eugenic implications
reminded me of my thinking
exercise in the form of a
voluntary sterilization bonus plan
— an exercise that cost me an
honorary Sc.D. in England and
was branded "benevolent
genocide" here. Does "benevolent
genocide" properly describe an
action that prevents bringing
babies into the world with both
heredity and environment stacked
against them?
Twelve days after the
sterilizations, a $1 million damage
suit was filed on behalf of these
minors. The suit depicted the
social agency personnel who
arranged the tubal ligation
operations as deceitful, inhumane
bureaucrats. Furthermore, the suit
demanded that these agencies be
forced to "do everything humanly
and medically possible" to reverse
the sterilizations. Does the phrase
"berserk humanism" properly
describe legal encouragement for
bringing babies into the world
with both heredity and
environment stacked against
them?
Berserk humanism and
benevolent genocide — phrases so
unnerving and emotionally-loaded
as to be, for some surprised
minds, even unthinkable. But to
judge whether either phrase
applies or how best to think about
the two crises encountered in
June by the Relf family does
demand responsible, objective,
humanistic thought — thought
that is not blocked by intellectual
fastidiousness.
Focus on Humanism
Is it right that the tragedy of
the Relfs be nationally publicized
and then forgotten? My answer
and the purpose of this column is
an emphatic "No!" Instead, the
tragedy of the Relfs should be
made to focus discussion so as to
create a climate of realistic
humanism — a climate controlled
by relevant scientific facts about
the biological nature of humanity.
Such is the long range aim of this
column.
On the day after the suit was
filed, Lonnie Relf, the father, told
reporters that "for about a year"
the girls had been getting shots to
keep them from getting pregnant.
The suit claimed that when the
shots were banned because of
health hazards, social workers had
obtained Mrs. Relf's consent to
sterilization while she understood
only that the girls were to be

given "some shots."
This alleged misunderstanding
of the actual situation by Mrs.
Relf was a key item in the suit
and was given national
prominence on July 10, exactly
two weeks after the suit was filed,
in a hearing in Congress called by
Senator Edward Kennedy as
chairman of the Senate Health
Subcommittee. No witnesses for
the social agencies that arranged
the sterilizations testified.
Washington columnist Judity
Randall reported:
Witnesses
"It was Kennedy's original idea
to produce as witnesses the two
sterilized girls, one of whom is
both mentally retarded and
congenitally deformed and neither
of whom has the wit even now to
understand the consequences of
the surgery she underwent at the
behest of a federally funded
agency in Montgomery. The
testimony of these girls would
surely have generated publicity,
but could hardly have assisted
Kennedy's health subcommittee
in drafting legislation to deal with
an issue so legally, morally and
ethically complex."
I disagree with Judith Randall's
position that it was best that the
Relf daughters did not testify —
particularly Mary Alice. The
tragedy of Mary Alice Relf is one
that true — not berserk —
humanists are duty bound to try
to obviate whenever possible ~
even if new legislation is needed
to do so. Her testimony at the
televised hearing might have
underlined the need for the
objective humanism that this
column is intended to encourage. It
might have added some grim
truths to the erroneous
impressions that I heard conveyed
by the TV news reports of
Senator Kennedy's hearing.
One erroneous impression
seemd to support the $1 million
suit. What TV viewers observed
when the Senator queried the
illiterate Mrs. Relf about
authorizing the sterilizations was
this:
"When did. you put an 4 X' on a
piece of paper?"
"Tha was when I ... I went
down to the hols [not clear]."
"When you went to the
hospital?"
"Yeah."
"Do you remember what the
... the nurse asked ybu? ... why
you signed the piece of paper?"
"She tol me they were gonna
take ... they were gonna .. .uh
... uh .. . take some shots."
Erroneous Testimony
I shall subsequently cite
evidence that this testimony is in
error by reporting the first
confirmation for public
consumption by the nurse herself
of how she informed Mrs. Relf
about tubal ligation.
The absence of Mary Alice Relf
from the TV screens prevented
the viewers from judging for
themselves an evaluation expressed

by Senator Kennedy when, with
hesitation, he complimented Mrs.
Relf: "You've got two .. . three
... wonderful daughters that we
met earlier this morning." I shall
not speculate whether courtesy to
a guest, or political expediency or
humanism gone berserk caused
the Senator to reconsider what
must on first impression have
been so obvious and to apply
"wonderful" to the tragic status
of Mary Alice Relf.
The blanket endorsement of all
humans as "wonderful" is the
acme of humanism gone berserk.
This endorsement appears in
surprising places. Specifically, the
Faculty of the Department of
Genetics at Stanford University
accused me of mischief and malice
towards "the whole wonderful
variety of human beings" when in
1965 I raised questions like those
here. Assertion that social
problems, for example the
battered-child syndrome, cannot
be caused by genes and that all
humans are "wonderful" is
humanism gone so berserk as to
threaten our nation's future.

— an exercise that cost me an
honorary Sc.D. in England and
was branded "benevolent
genocide" here. Does "benevolent
genocide" properly describe an
action that prevents bringing
babies into the world with both
heredity and environment stacked
against them?
Twelve days after the
sterilizations, a $1 million damage
suit was filed on behalf of these
minors. The suit depicted the
social agency personnel who
arranged the tubal ligation
operations as deceitful, inhumane
bureaucrats. Furthermore, the suit
demanded that these agencies be
forced to "do everything humanly
and medically possible" to reverse
the sterilizations. Does the phrase
"berserk humanism" properly
describe legal encouragement for
bringing babies into the world
with both heredity and
environment stacked against
them?
Berserk humanism and
benevolent genocide — phrases so
unnerving and emotionally-loaded
as to be, for some surprised
minds, even unthinkable. But to
judge whether either phrase
applies or how best to think about
the two crises encountered in
June by the Relf family does
demand responsible, objective,
humanistic thought — thought
that is not blocked by intellectual
fastidiousness.
Focus on Humanism
Is it right that the tragedy of
the Relfs be nationally publicized
and then forgotten? My answer
and the purpose of this column is
an emphatic "No!" Instead, the
tragedy of the Relfs should be
made to focus discussion so as to
create a climate of realistic
humanism — a climate controlled
by relevant scientific facts about
the biological nature of humanity.
Such is the long range aim of this
column.
On the day after the suit was
filed, Lonnie Relf, the father, told
reporters that "for about a year"
the girls had been getting shots to
keep them from getting pregnant.
The suit claimed that when the
shots were banned because of
health hazards, social workers had
obtained Mrs. Relf's consent to
sterilization while she understood
only that the girls were to be

given "some shots."
This alleged misunderstanding
of the actual situation by Mrs.
Relf was a key item in the suit
and was given national
prominence on July 10, exactly
two weeks after the suit was filed,
in a hearing in Congress called by
Senator Edward Kennedy as
chairman of the Senate Health
Subcommittee. No witnesses for
the social agencies that arranged
the sterilizations testified.
Washington columnist Judity
Randall reported:
Witnesses
"It was Kennedy's original idea
to produce as witnesses the two
sterilized girls, one of whom is
both mentally retarded and
congenitally deformed and neither
of whom has the wit even now to
understand the consequences of
the surgery she underwent at the
behest of a federally funded
agency in Montgomery. The
testimony of these girls would
surely have generated publicity,
but could hardly have assisted
Kennedy's health subcommittee
in drafting legislation to deal with
an issue so legally, morally and
ethically complex."
I disagree with Judith Randall's
position that it was best that the
Relf daughters did not testify —
particularly Mary Alice. The
tragedy of Mary Alice Relf is one
that true — not berserk —
humanists are duty bound to try
to obviate whenever possible ~
even if new legislation is needed
to do so. Her testimony at the
televised hearing might have
underlined the need for the
objective humanism that this
column is intended to encourage. It
might have added some grim
truths to the erroneous
impressions that I heard conveyed
by the TV news reports of
Senator Kennedy's hearing.
One erroneous impression
seemd to support the $1 million
suit. What TV viewers observed
when the Senator queried the
illiterate Mrs. Relf about
authorizing the sterilizations was
this:
"When did. you put an 4 X' on a
piece of paper?"
"Tha was when I ... I went
down to the hols [not clear]."
"When you went to the
hospital?"
"Yeah."
"Do you remember what the
... the nurse asked ybu? ... why
you signed the piece of paper?"
"She tol me they were gonna
take ... they were gonna .. .uh
... uh .. . take some shots."
Erroneous Testimony
I shall subsequently cite
evidence that this testimony is in
error by reporting the first
confirmation for public
consumption by the nurse herself
of how she informed Mrs. Relf
about tubal ligation.
The absence of Mary Alice Relf
from the TV screens prevented
the viewers from judging for
themselves an evaluation expressed

by Senator Kennedy when, with
hesitation, he complimented Mrs.
Relf: "You've got two .. . three
... wonderful daughters that we
met earlier this morning." I shall
not speculate whether courtesy to
a guest, or political expediency or
humanism gone berserk caused
the Senator to reconsider what
must on first impression have
been so obvious and to apply
"wonderful" to the tragic status
of Mary Alice Relf.
The blanket endorsement of all
humans as "wonderful" is the
acme of humanism gone berserk.
This endorsement appears in
surprising places. Specifically, the
Faculty of the Department of
Genetics at Stanford University
accused me of mischief and malice
towards "the whole wonderful
variety of human beings" when in
1965 I raised questions like those
here. Assertion that social
problems, for example the
battered-child syndrome, cannot
be caused by genes and that all
humans are "wonderful" is
humanism gone so berserk as to
threaten our nation's future.

"berserk humanism" properly
describe legal encouragement for
bringing babies into the world
with both heredity and
environment stacked against
them?
Berserk humanism and
benevolent genocide — phrases so
unnerving and emotionally-loaded
as to be, for some surprised
minds, even unthinkable. But to
judge whether either phrase
applies or how best to think about
the two crises encountered in
June by the Relf family does
demand responsible, objective,
humanistic thought — thought
that is not blocked by intellectual
fastidiousness.
Focus on Humanism
Is it right that the tragedy of
the Relfs be nationally publicized
and then forgotten? My answer
and the purpose of this column is
an emphatic "No!" Instead, the
tragedy of the Relfs should be
made to focus discussion so as to
create a climate of realistic
humanism — a climate controlled
by relevant scientific facts about
the biological nature of humanity.
Such is the long range aim of this
column.
On the day after the suit was
filed, Lonnie Relf, the father, told
reporters that "for about a year"
the girls had been getting shots to
keep them from getting pregnant.
The suit claimed that when the
shots were banned because of
health hazards, social workers had
obtained Mrs. Relf's consent to
sterilization while she understood
only that the girls were to be

given "some shots."
This alleged misunderstanding
of the actual situation by Mrs.
Relf was a key item in the suit
and was given national
prominence on July 10, exactly
two weeks after the suit was filed,
in a hearing in Congress called by
Senator Edward Kennedy as
chairman of the Senate Health
Subcommittee. No witnesses for
the social agencies that arranged
the sterilizations testified.
Washington columnist Judity
Randall reported:
Witnesses
"It was Kennedy's original idea
to produce as witnesses the two
sterilized girls, one of whom is
both mentally retarded and
congenitally deformed and neither
of whom has the wit even now to
understand the consequences of
the surgery she underwent at the
behest of a federally funded
agency in Montgomery. The
testimony of these girls would
surely have generated publicity,
but could hardly have assisted
Kennedy's health subcommittee
in drafting legislation to deal with
an issue so legally, morally and
ethically complex."
I disagree with Judith Randall's
position that it was best that the
Relf daughters did not testify —
particularly Mary Alice. The
tragedy of Mary Alice Relf is one
that true — not berserk —
humanists are duty bound to try
to obviate whenever possible ~
even if new legislation is needed
to do so. Her testimony at the
televised hearing might have
underlined the need for the
objective humanism that this
column is intended to encourage. It
might have added some grim
truths to the erroneous
impressions that I heard conveyed
by the TV news reports of
Senator Kennedy's hearing.
One erroneous impression
seemd to support the $1 million
suit. What TV viewers observed
when the Senator queried the
illiterate Mrs. Relf about
authorizing the sterilizations was
this:
"When did. you put an 4 X' on a
piece of paper?"
"Tha was when I ... I went
down to the hols [not clear]."
"When you went to the
hospital?"
"Yeah."
"Do you remember what the
... the nurse asked ybu? ... why
you signed the piece of paper?"
"She tol me they were gonna
take ... they were gonna .. .uh
... uh .. . take some shots."
Erroneous Testimony
I shall subsequently cite
evidence that this testimony is in
error by reporting the first
confirmation for public
consumption by the nurse herself
of how she informed Mrs. Relf
about tubal ligation.
The absence of Mary Alice Relf
from the TV screens prevented
the viewers from judging for
themselves an evaluation expressed

by Senator Kennedy when, with
hesitation, he complimented Mrs.
Relf: "You've got two .. . three
... wonderful daughters that we
met earlier this morning." I shall
not speculate whether courtesy to
a guest, or political expediency or
humanism gone berserk caused
the Senator to reconsider what
must on first impression have
been so obvious and to apply
"wonderful" to the tragic status
of Mary Alice Relf.
The blanket endorsement of all
humans as "wonderful" is the
acme of humanism gone berserk.
This endorsement appears in
surprising places. Specifically, the
Faculty of the Department of
Genetics at Stanford University
accused me of mischief and malice
towards "the whole wonderful
variety of human beings" when in
1965 I raised questions like those
here. Assertion that social
problems, for example the
battered-child syndrome, cannot
be caused by genes and that all
humans are "wonderful" is
humanism gone so berserk as to
threaten our nation's future.

Twelve year old Mary Alice
Relf, born with a shortened right
arm and no hand,
men tally-retarded with a speech
impediment, and her allegedly
also retarded fourteen year old
sister Minnie were surgically
sterilized by tubal ligation on
June 14, 1973 in Montgomery,
Alabama. These were the two
youngest of seven children
family that had been on welfare
for more than twenty years.
The eugenic implications
reminded me of my thinking
exercise in the form of a
voluntary sterilization bonus plan
— an exercise that cost me an
honorary Sc.D. in England and
was branded "benevolent
genocide" here. Does "benevolent
genocide" properly describe an
action that prevents bringing
babies into the world with both
heredity and environment stacked
against them?
Twelve days after the
sterilizations, a $1 million damage
suit was filed on behalf of these
minors. The suit depicted the
social agency personnel who
arranged the tubal ligation
operations as deceitful, inhumane
bureaucrats. Furthermore, the suit
demanded that these agencies be
forced to "do everything humanly
and medically possible" to reverse
the sterilizations. Does the phrase
"berserk humanism" properly
describe legal encouragement for
bringing babies into the world
with both heredity and
