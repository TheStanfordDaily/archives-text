Sexism At Council
Editor:
In response to the article last
week on Cowell Health Center's
gynecological care, we were
angered, but not completely
surprised, by Dr. McClenahan's
condescending attitude toward
women. Schedule books have
always come before the patient
there. No woman has been able to
see the part-time gynecologist in
less than a month's notice unless
she could prove an urgent need
(enlarged ovaries apparently
weren't serious enough to warrant
| immediate care). Now that the
opportunity arises to hire a
.full-time gynecologist,
McClenahan reveals the sexist
attitudes which have been
responsible for Cowell's poor
female medical care.
McClenahan sees any woman
"fussy" (or maybe sensible)
enough to insist on seeing a
gynecologist as a spoiled brat who
doesn't know what an urgent
problem is. Normally, a woman
would not go to a regular doctor
for gynecological care; she insists
on a gynecologist's expertise in

detecting not easily discernible
problems and appreciates the
specialist's concern and sympathy.
The Stanford coed does not
have such an alternative; she has
to be "screened" before she can
see a gynecologist, and
McClenahan's standards to
determine urgent need seem
unreasonably high. (Massy, the
former Cowell gynecologist, says
that only 50 percent of the
gynecological problems should be
handled by other doctors while
McClenahan says 90 percent). The
horror stories in the article show
that some women have suffered
grave harm because of
McClenahan's policies.
There are 4000 women at
Stanford and most either have or
will want contraceptive care.
Congressional hearings this
summer revealed that most forms
of birth control can possibly lead
to serious complications, and as
more and more Stanford women
use contraceptives, the need for
checkups and/or treatment will
significantly increase. Also, the
I.U.D. is becoming a popular form
of birth control, especially among
those who, with good reason, fear
hormone pills.
Because an I.U.D. requires a
gynecologist, however, Cowell has
tried to push the Pill on girls who
don't really want it. If a woman
overcomes the staff's discouraging
words, she must still wait at least
a month to see a part-time
gynecologist, and maybe longer
since she must time the
appointment to coincide with
menstruation.
Pregnancy might occur in the
waiting period, for the sole
reason that Cowell is too stingy to
enlarge its staff.
We all urge that Cowell change
from its unfeeling, uncaring
policies of the past, and give
women the treatment they
deserve. We join with Dr. Massy,
and, indeed, even Cowell's
receptionist who sees the need
every day, in demanding a
full-time gynecologist at the
health center.
