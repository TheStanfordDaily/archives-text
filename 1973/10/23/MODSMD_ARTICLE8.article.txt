## Arab Refugees Expelled From Lands 
### 
Bill EverÂ«

In discussion of the Middle
East, it is always necessary to
focus on the moral dimension of
the dispossession of the
Palestinian Arabs by the Israelis.
This land theft lies at the heart of
the present-day conflicts in the
Middle East.
As Rabbi R. Benjamin, writing
from within Israel, points out:
"We (Israelis) have no moral right
whatever to oppose the return of
the Arab refugees to their
land....
"We had no right to occupy
the house of an Arab if we had
not paid for it at its value. The
same goes for fields, gardens,
stores, and workshops. We had no
right to build a settlement and to
realize the ideal of Zionism with
other people's property. To do
this is robbery."
Further Discussion
Several of the points by Ron
Shapiro and David N. Braun in
their column [Daily, Oct. 22] on
the refugee issue and the
ownership of Palestinian land
deserve further discussion:
1. Shapiro and Braun contend
that the land bought before 1948
by Zionist settlers from feudal
landlords was not land that had
been cultivated. According to
Shapiro and Braun, it was in
general swamp or desert and had
not been worked by Arab farmers.
The points raised by Shapiro
and Braun must be discussed in

terms of the land tenure situation
in Palestine in the late 19405.
Jews owned approximately six
percent of the total area;
ninety-one percent of this had
been acquired as large tracts from
feudal landlords.
Eviction
Jewish purchasers bought these
tracts to settle Zionist colonists
on them. Much of the area of
these estates had long been
cultivated, and when they took
over, the Zionists often evicted
many Palestinian Arab tenant
farmers.
In one instance in 1922, over
40,000 acres, comprising 18
villages were sold, resulting in the
eviction of 688 Arab farm
families. In fact, in the specific
case cited by Shapiro and Braun,
the Jezreel Valley, twenty villages
were uprooted. It is thus incorrect
to describe this valley as having
been "empty."
In response to the contentions
of Shapiro and Braun, the moral
point is not how many were
evicted, but rather that none
should have been evicted from the
land that was rightfully theirs.
Rightful Owners
The land was rightfully theirs
because in the feudal system
original title to the land is derived
from forcible conquest, not from
transforming the land. As the
homesteaders of the land, the
Arab farmers were morally the

rightful owners; the feudal
landlords were usurpers.
Shapiro and Braun are
inaccurate in describing the land
the Zionists obtained from feudal
landlords as mostly desert and
swamp. In fact, Jewish holdings
were generally in the plains, where
the best land in Palestine is found.
Of course, anyone (Arab or
Jew) who homesteaded a
previously unworked area
(including unutilized swamp or
desert) did become, morally
speaking, the rightful proprietor.
2. On the origins of the refugee
problem in the period before
mid-May 1948, Shapiro and Braun
present the official Israeli view
that the Arab political leadership
ordered the Palestinian Arabs to
leave their homes. To back up this
view, Shapiro and Braun cite a
1957 European refugee agency
report and a late 1948 Arab
newspaper account.
Origins
In resolving the questions
around the origins of the refugee
problem, we must be ruthlessly
scientific. Historical questions of
this sort are best resolved by
turning to primary source
material. No primary evidence of
evacuation orders has ever been
produced by the Zionists.
If there were orders, where are
the texts of these orders? If there
were broadcasts, why no names,
dates, and transcripts? In fact, the
monitoring records kept by the
Central Intelligence Agency and
the British Broadcasting
Corporation show neither orders
nor hints about evacuating the
Palestinian Arabs. (Many of the
1948 daily reports of the ClA's
Foreign Broadcast Information
Branch can be found in the
Stanford library system.)
The European refugee
organization report quoted by
Shapiro and Braun mentions the
Arab League as the source of the
evacuation orders. Yet the
resolutions of the Arab League are
available in published form, and,
in fact, no such order is among
them.
No Evidence
A scholarly examination has
been made of the important Arab
newspapers al-Ahram (Egypt),
al-Hayat (Lebanon), and al-Difa
(Palestine) for this period. They
contain no discussion of or hints
about any such evacuation orders.
The burden of proof is always
upon the person who advances a
hypothesis. As of now, historical
evidence has not been presented
which sustains the Zionist
hypothesis that the Arab political
leadership ordered the Palestinian
Arabs to leave.
As a final matter, I would like
to reiterate my belief that
whether or not such orders were
issued does not affect the
legitimacy of the Palestinian
Arabs' titles to their homes.
Compensation
3. Shapiro and Braun present
an inaccurate picture of the policy
of the Israeli government on
compensating the Palestinian
Arabs.
From 1948 to 1950, the Israeli
government refused to discuss
paying for the property left
behind by the fleeing Arabs.
Since then, Israeli leaders have
offered to pay lump-sum
compensation through the UN.
But the Israeli government has

insisted that it would only pay a
negotiated global compensation
and that the area and value of the
confiscated land would not have a
bearing on the lump sum paid.
Arab political leaders have
demanded, correctly, that the
right of the Palestinian Arabs to
be repatriated be recognized and
that those Arabs who did not wish
to return be compensated
individually.
All major Israeli political
groupings oppose repatriation of
the Palestinian Arab refugees.
