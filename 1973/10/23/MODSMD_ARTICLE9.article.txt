# Not Everyone Salvages So Much
## New Political Morality Helps Agnew 
### 
\ Andrew Leuchter

Ambrose Bierce defined
litigation as that process which
"one goes into as a pig and comes
out of as a sausage." Mr. Bierce's
definition was no doubt tailored
to Spiro Agnew's recent, grinding
ordeal within the court system.
For Mr. Agnew has lost in a
month more than all but a few
unfortunates lose in a lifetime: he
has been fined $10,000; he has
resigned from the second highest
elected office in the United
States; most importantly, he has
been stripped of his integrity in
full view of the world.
Despite the strain of
humiliation, Mr. Agnew's incisive

mind functions unimpaired. Both
his tongue and his cunning were
honed to their finest edge last
Monday for an explanation to the
electorate of his recently admitted
felony.
Those expecting an apology
were disappointed, along with
those who anticipated a vitriolic
expose of Machiavellian White
House politics. Mr. Agnew mused
very little over the responsibility
of anyone in the Nixon
administration, including himself,
for his downfall. Instead, the
former Vice-President raised in his
defense the specter of a
falsely-righteous morality, which
created a crime where there was

none — an amorphous
"post-Watergate political
morality."
Unclear Political Ethic
The exact definition of this
new political ethic was unclear;
in fact, Mr. Agnew made direct
reference to it only once. He
conjured the apparition of this
new political ethic when
defending the feeble nature of his
felony. The former Vice-President
claimed that had his merger of
campaign finance and state
business come to light before the
advent of the "post-Watergate
political morality," it would
surely have not been considered
unusual; such corruption of
convenience, according to Mr.
Agnew, is the rule rather than the
exception in government.
By this analysis, his crime
would not have even been a crime
before the post-Water gate moral
ultra-consciousness. There are
only a few recent examples from
the federal system with which to
examine his claim: the bribery
cases involving former federal
judge Otto E. Kerner, and the late
Rep. John Dowdy (D —'Tex.).
Both these men were
prosecuted under the
pre-Watergate political morality;
yet both were subject to the most
vigorous and scathing Justice
Department investigations. These
men were both discovered and
prosecuted before the Watergate
crisis, yet their punishments were
far more severe than Mr. Agnew's:
their private lives, as well as their
political careers, were
permanently scarred.
Lenient Morality
Evidence bears out Mr.
Agnew's claim that a peculiar

"post-Water gate" morality was
responsible for his demise. But
contrary to his belief, the
judgments of this new ethic are
maskedly more lenient than those
meted out under the
pre-Watergate morality. For the
once-sensationalist Watergate
revelations have adopted a
mundane appearance: political
corruption has been robbed ot its
sense of drama, and the American
political system of its sense of
decency.
Indications of Presidential
complicity in high crime have
become everyday occurences. The
pervasiveness of corruption in the
Nixon administration has become
accepted fact. News of this
corruption has been the focal
point of public concern for more
than a year; moral outrage cannot
last forever. Thus it should come
as no surprise that the slow,
tortuous revelations of the Agnew
case held few in suspense, and
shocked none; for the bribery of a
Vice-President is far easier to
accept than the "dirty tricks" of a
President.
Mr. Agnew's anger over his
political demise is unjustified;
many a convicted political felon
would find Mr. Agnew's position
most comfortable. What the
former Vice-President has
successfully managed to do is give
up his skin to save his bones. Had
his bribery and tax evasion been
publicized prior to Watergate, Mr.
Agnew would not have escaped
the political scene with even that
much.

Lenient Morality
Evidence bears out Mr.
Agnew's claim that a peculiar

"post-Water gate" morality was
responsible for his demise. But
contrary to his belief, the
judgments of this new ethic are
maskedly more lenient than those
meted out under the
pre-Watergate morality. For the
once-sensationalist Watergate
revelations have adopted a
mundane appearance: political
corruption has been robbed ot its
sense of drama, and the American
political system of its sense of
decency.
Indications of Presidential
complicity in high crime have
become everyday occurences. The
pervasiveness of corruption in the
Nixon administration has become
accepted fact. News of this
corruption has been the focal
point of public concern for more
than a year; moral outrage cannot
last forever. Thus it should come
as no surprise that the slow,
tortuous revelations of the Agnew
case held few in suspense, and
shocked none; for the bribery of a
Vice-President is far easier to
accept than the "dirty tricks" of a
President.
Mr. Agnew's anger over his
political demise is unjustified;
many a convicted political felon
would find Mr. Agnew's position
most comfortable. What the
former Vice-President has
successfully managed to do is give
up his skin to save his bones. Had
his bribery and tax evasion been
publicized prior to Watergate, Mr.
Agnew would not have escaped
the political scene with even that
much.

Ambrose Bierce defined
litigation as that process which
"one goes into as a pig and comes
out of as a sausage." Mr. Bierce's
definition was no doubt tailored
to Spiro Agnew's recent, grinding
ordeal within the court system.
For Mr. Agnew has lost in a
month more than all but a few
unfortunates lose in a lifetime: he
has been fined $10,000; he has
resigned from the second highest
elected office in the United
States; most importantly, he has
been stripped of his integrity in
full view of the world.
Despite the strain of
humiliation, Mr. Agnew's incisive

mind functions unimpaired. Both
his tongue and his cunning were
honed to their finest edge last
Monday for an explanation to the
electorate of his recently admitted
felony.
Those expecting an apology
were disappointed, along with
those who anticipated a vitriolic
expose of Machiavellian White
House politics. Mr. Agnew mused
very little over the responsibility
of anyone in the Nixon
administration, including himself,
for his downfall. Instead, the
former Vice-President raised in his
defense the specter of a
falsely-righteous morality, which
created a crime where there was

none — an amorphous
"post-Watergate political
morality."
Unclear Political Ethic
The exact definition of this
new political ethic was unclear;
in fact, Mr. Agnew made direct
reference to it only once. He
conjured the apparition of this
new political ethic when
defending the feeble nature of his
felony. The former Vice-President
claimed that had his merger of
campaign finance and state
business come to light before the
advent of the "post-Watergate
political morality," it would
surely have not been considered
unusual; such corruption of
convenience, according to Mr.
Agnew, is the rule rather than the
exception in government.
By this analysis, his crime
would not have even been a crime
before the post-Water gate moral
ultra-consciousness. There are
only a few recent examples from
the federal system with which to
examine his claim: the bribery
cases involving former federal
judge Otto E. Kerner, and the late
Rep. John Dowdy (D —'Tex.).
Both these men were
prosecuted under the
pre-Watergate political morality;
yet both were subject to the most
vigorous and scathing Justice
Department investigations. These
men were both discovered and
prosecuted before the Watergate
crisis, yet their punishments were
far more severe than Mr. Agnew's:
their private lives, as well as their
political careers, were
permanently scarred.

Agnew's claim that a peculiar

"post-Water gate" morality was
