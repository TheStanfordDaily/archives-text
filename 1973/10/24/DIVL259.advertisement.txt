Why new Memorex
sounds better than the
cassette you're probably
using now.
i Thank MRX2 Oxide.
■ Vi I imA * I * MRX2 Oxide makes new Memorex
the best cassette tape you can buy for
on >" equipment. Bar none.
MRX2 are smoother
and more uniform than low-noise or
"energized" particles. So we can pack
more of them on our tape surface to
pick up and play back more sound.
new Memorex with MRX2
Oxide means fidelity.

buy a tape for?
