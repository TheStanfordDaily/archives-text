# President Agrees To Surrender Tapes
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Nixon capitulated yesterday and
agreed to comply with a court order
that he surrender Watergate-related
tapes and documents to a federal
judge.
The abrupt and astounding
turnabout came two hours after the
House of Representatives took the
first formal steps that could lead to
impeachment.
But the President scuttled plans to
give the Senate Watergate committee
an authenticated summary of the
tapes.
House leaders decided yesterday to
go ahead with an inquiry that could
lead to Nixon's impeachment despite
his agreement to release the White
House Watergate tapes to a federal
judge.
Investigation Announced
They had already announced the
start of the investigation before
Nixon's about-face on the tapes, and
said they would continue at least until
the effect of his action becomes clear.
With the controversy over the tapes
apparently stilled, Nixon's critics in
the House said their major concern
was to assure the continuation of an
independent prosecution of the
Watergate case and its many offshoots.

President Nixon will address the
nation on Watergate tonight at 6 p.m.
The three major television networks
will broadcast the message live.

Nixon abolished the special
prosecutor's office when he fired its
director, Archibald Cox, touching off
the uproar that led to the move for
beginning impeachment proceedings.
There seemed little doubt, however,
that Nixon's decision would take some
of the steam out of any impeachment
drive. A chief criticism aimed at him
during an emotional House session was
that he had refused to comply with an
order of the court.
Some key Democratic senators also

said they expect the developments to
defuse talk of impeachment.
However, Democrats such as
Edward M. Kennedy, Philip A. Hart
and Birch Bayh said they will press
ahead with legislation to create a
special Watergate prosecutor not
subject to dismissal by the President.
Richardson Speaks
Former Atty. Gen. Elliot L.
Richardson, who resigned rather than
fire Cox, had just held a nationally
televised news conference and said the
American people must decide whether
impeachment of the President is the
proper course. He declined to pass

judgment on the question.
After the announcement, he issued
a statement saying he hoped Nixon's
decision would "overcome the wave of
protest as a consequence of the firing
of Cox." The latest move, he said, was
a "constructive, statesman-like step."
Meanwhile, the new chief of the
administration's Watergate
investigation, Asst. Atty. Gen. Henry
E. Petersen, met with Cox's
lieutenants to discuss the future of the
case. He said yesterday's events were
reassuring but that he had made no
commitments to the Cox staff and
received no assurances from them that

they wouldn't resign en masse.
Vice President-designate Gerald R.
Ford, who has supported Nixon's
actions repeatedly in recent days, said
the decision to surrender the tapes
rules out any need to rehire Cox or
anyone else as a special Watergate
prosecutor.
"I see no need for that
whatsoever," Ford told a news
conference in Harrisburg, Pa.
Nixon Retreats
Nixon, who spent the morning in
Washington, returned by car to the
seclusion of his Camp David

mountaintop retreat in nearby
Maryland. The White House said he
was unaccompanied by family or
aides.
The technicalities of the tapes
turnover have not been finalized, but
the tapes aren't to be made public for
some time â€” if at all. They will be
delivered to District Court Judge John
Sirica for the judge to listen to in
private and decide what portions to
give to the grand jury, which conducts
its business in secret.
Their contents could eventually
become public if they are introduced
as evidence in future trials.
The Nixon decision and the later
White House announcement that the
Watergate committee will not get the
tapes material may displease panel
members, but other senators were
pleased Nixon planned to give the
tapes to Sirica.
"Thank God," said Sen. Barry
Goldwater, R-Ariz.
Compromise Evaporates
Meanwhile, the President's so-called
compromise plan to give the Senate
Watergate committee an authenticated
summary of the tapes evaporated
when Presidential Assistant Alexander
Haig told newsmen at the White House
that the offer had been withdrawn.
Nixon's agreement with the
committee leaders appeared tenuous at
best almost from the time of its
announcement Friday night. And it
was clouded further yesterday when
committee lawyers appealed Sirica's

decision to throw out their lawsuit
seeking the tapes.
Then the panel's chairman, Sen.
Sam J. Ervin Jr., D-N.C., sent a
telegram to the President saying his
understanding of the proposal, to be
put to the full committee tomorrow,
was far different from that described
by the White House.
Ploy
After Haig announced termination
of the agreement, committee chief
counsel Samuel Dash questioned
whether the President's offer "was
really a ploy."
"Obviously, we will now have to
meet recognizing that this offer was
not made in good faith," Dash said. "I
don't think the President has heard the
last from my committee."
Sen. Howard H. Baker Jr., R-Tenn.,
the committee vice chairman, said he
still hoped some sort of arrangement
could be worked out with Nixon to
obtain the tapes.
Haig and presidential attorney
Charles Alan Wright told a news
conference yesterday that the White
House had miscalculated the public
outcry over the tapes issue.
".. . the President concluded after
very painful and anguishing discussion
with me, with his counsel, that the
circumstances were sufficiently grave"
to reverse himself on the tapes issue,
Haig said.
The President's sudden reversal
took many of the principals by
surprise.
