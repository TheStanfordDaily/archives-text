Insane Logic
Editor,
Perhaps the most discouraging
aspect of the Middle-East war is
the knee-jerk reaction of the
United States and the Soviet
Union. These countries who
profess their intent to usher in a
generation of world peace are
caught in the lie of their own
insane logic. Peace comes through
balanced power, they say, and in
the name of peace they wage their
detente upon the hapless people
of the Middle East, pouring the
machinery of death into the
holocaust. In the hands of men
they place the tools of war, that
the world might be made safe.
While the detente-mongers
continue to trade Pepsi's for
dollars and to spill champagne in
gestures of diplomacy, they rush
their arsenals to the disposal of
embittered men, heedless of the
warning Homer uttered nearly
three milenia ago: "Iron itself can
draw men's hands." The Middle
East war can last indefinitely, so
long as the fighters have unlimited
weapons. Only people will die.
Again and again, Johnny gets
his gun. Over thirty years ago,
Dalton Trumbo (Johnny Got His
Gun) warned the people who plan
for war that the little men of
peace who work and want no
quarrel would turn their guns and
their slogans upon the masters
who push them to war. But his
hopes are yet unrealized, and
today we can still shout in
T rum bo's words: "You — you
who urge us on to battle you who
incite us against ourselves you
who would have one cobbler kill
another cobbler you who would
have one man who works kill
another man who works you who
would have one human being who
wants only to live kill another
human being who wants only to
live — you talk more munitions
and airplanes and battleships and
gases why of course we've got to
have them we can't get along
without them how in the world
could we protect the peace if we
didn't have them? You plan the
wars you masters of men plan the
wars and point the way and we

will point the gun."

Biased Morality
Editor:
, Saturday I talked with Winford
, C. Naylor about his Oct. 19 Daily
article, "Mideast Troubles:
! Accuracy Needed," which, after
! calling for fairness, attacked
exclusively proponents of Israel.
■ Though I found Mr. Naylor
personable, knowledgeable, and
sincere, I came away feeling that
he has real biases.
He assured me Israel's
existence is not in danger, that he
knows Arab threats, never
; disavowed, to extinguish it, are
■ merely an example of the inflated
rhetoric peculiar to Arab history
and politics. He knows more of
the Arab psyche than I do. Still,
whatever the immediate cause of
an attack — the Israeli Labor
resolution, by the way, never
mentions "annexation" — Arab
i governments have consistently
carried out threats to attack
Israel. Jews who have trusted that
i enemy threats were "mere
, rhetoric" have always fallen into
i trouble.
As for his calling the White
" Plaza Israel rally, which I
, attended, an "emotional appeal of
I the lowest sort," I must conclude
i that Mr. Naylor simply cannot
i understand the committed Jew's
emotional attachment to Israel.
After all, his friends, his relatives,
his people and their nation, are
, not in danger. Sensitive as he
i seemed to the justice and
humanity on the Arab side, the
disturbing feeling remains that he
would establish his moral credit at
i our expense.

How Much Longer?
! Editor:
President Nixon, noted for his
self-imposed seclusion in times of
crisis, has again immured himself
in the White House, but this ti.Tie
1 with an unwonted disregard foi

his outer defenses.
Much of his apparent
friendlessness, however, can be
attributed to pre-Watergate
events. Nixon's statesman-like
approach to the 1972 elections
did nothing to ingratiate him with
Republican candidates who
wanted to test his coattails.
In the wake of his landslide
victory, the President's sweeping
demand for letters of resignation
from all Administration officials
certainly did not endear him to
loyal subordinates — men who
believed his zeal for unflinching
support would be repaid in kind.
And now, four attorney
generals, secret bombings, and
innumerable impoundments later,
Nixon must consider himself a
lonely man indeed. Has he any
friends to aid him now? Many are
the subject of criminal
prosecution, painted as sinister
villains by the President's
death-like grip on evidence.
Less has the President sought
men to help him fight his way out
than he has slapped together dikes
to stanch the flood of Watergate.

Good old Gerald Ford, fittingly
rewarded for his slavish support
by the dramatization of his lack
of presidential stature — a silent
warning to Nixon opponents.
Melvin Laird, who had no idea
how tough he would have to be,
when the going got tough ...
Richardson, Ruckelshaus.
Perhaps there is no
ammunition for a
counter-offensive. And as the
casualties mount, one wonders
whether the supreme sacrifice can
be staved off much longer.

Whitman House
Editor:
I am pleased to see an article
about Whitman House on your
front page; it is an exciting project
that deserves to be better known.
For the sake of better
understanding about the sorts of
possibilities it offers, however,
please let me explain a bit more
clearly the status of the seminar I
offer there.

The seminar is not a Whitman
House seminar granted special
accreditation by the Political
Science Department, as yqur
article implied. Instead, it is? a
regularly scheduled Department
seminar for undergraduates whifch
was worked out partly on the
request of Whitman H4>use
members, who kindly offered the
House as a place for our meetings.
We have found this to be a most
congenial setting, and the core bf
four or five Whitman House
members provides a major support
and source of continuity for our
discussions. I would recommend
this sort of arrangement to others.
Also, to set the record straight,
the seminar does not have fewer
than 12 members, as your article
implies, but instead fifteen,
selected from more than thirty
who were originally seeking
admission. For the sake of the
fifteen-plus disappointed potential
members, please do correct this
misimpression.
