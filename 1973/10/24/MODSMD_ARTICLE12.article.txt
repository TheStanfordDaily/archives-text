# 'Search For Self' Ponders Man's Technological World
## 
### JENNIFER RANDISI 
Judging from the first three films of a four week program, "The
Search for Self" promises to be a powerfully moving series geared
toward confronting the individual with his or her role in the societal
destiny of our race. Each film is a projection, based on scientific and
psychic breakthroughs, of the spiritual and ethical fate of humankind.
Unlike many programs, "The Search for Self" emphasizes the
importance of its audience in a very pragmatic way — the alternatives
are presented and you, the viewer, are responsible for the outcome.
The series opened last Wednesday with "Future Shock," a
high-powered forty-minute film dramtically narrated by Orson Welles,
based on the novel by Alvin Toffler. Using split-second sequences of
both the familiar and the bizarre, Welles illustrated the era in which
we live — an era experiencing "the premature arrival of the future."

Alan Watts' presentation of ' 'The Art of Meditation" proved to be
an effective counter to the frantic pace of "Future Shock." Questions
raised by Welles in the first film were deepend in the mind of the
viewer by Watts' thirty-minute introduction to Zen meditation.
The third, and final, film of the trilogy acted as a synthesis of
directions taken in the two preceding films. Thelma Moss narrated this
twenty-five minute visual excursion into the fields of parapsychology,
telepathy, and bio-feedback training through a series of interviews
with pioneers in each discipline. The power of the mind was defined
by the film as the central tool in a kind of mental technology that
would be used to solve many of the enigmatic problems posed by
medicine and psychology.
Continuity of Series
For those who viewed these films, it will be interesting to note how
closely tonight's program adheres to the first in terms of thematic
structure and contrast.
It is toward individual and societal
mental awareness that tonight's program is addressed. How has
technology enabled the individual to cope with his or her psyche? To
what extent are stress and anxiety syptomatic of an American life
style that has become an inborn fact of our existence?
These and other questions will face tonight's viewer, as "The
Search for Self" examines the individual's potential to offset the
technological future that awaits us. As Orson Welles put it,"the
momentum is established, the direction is up to us."


AH, SCARLETT — Gone With The Wind, a new musical stage version
of the classic film, opened this week at the Curran Theatre. The show,
starring Lesley Ann Warren, Pernell Roberts, Terence Monk and
Udana Power, runs thru early December. Call 474-4790 for ticket

toward confronting the individual with his or her role in the societal
destiny of our race. Each film is a projection, based on scientific and
psychic breakthroughs, of the spiritual and ethical fate of humankind.
Unlike many programs, "The Search for Self" emphasizes the
importance of its audience in a very pragmatic way — the alternatives
are presented and you, the viewer, are responsible for the outcome.
The series opened last Wednesday with "Future Shock," a
high-powered forty-minute film dramtically narrated by Orson Welles,
based on the novel by Alvin Toffler. Using split-second sequences of
both the familiar and the bizarre, Welles illustrated the era in which
we live — an era experiencing "the premature arrival of the future."
Zen Alternative
Alan Watts' presentation of ' 'The Art of Meditation" proved to be
an effective counter to the frantic pace of "Future Shock." Questions
raised by Welles in the first film were deepend in the mind of the
viewer by Watts' thirty-minute introduction to Zen meditation.
The third, and final, film of the trilogy acted as a synthesis of
directions taken in the two preceding films. Thelma Moss narrated this
twenty-five minute visual excursion into the fields of parapsychology,
telepathy, and bio-feedback training through a series of interviews
with pioneers in each discipline. The power of the mind was defined
by the film as the central tool in a kind of mental technology that
would be used to solve many of the enigmatic problems posed by
medicine and psychology.
Continuity of Series
For those who viewed these films, it will be interesting to note how
closely tonight's program adheres to the first in terms of thematic
structure and contrast.
It is toward individual and societal
mental awareness that tonight's program is addressed. How has
technology enabled the individual to cope with his or her psyche? To
what extent are stress and anxiety syptomatic of an American life
style that has become an inborn fact of our existence?
These and other questions will face tonight's viewer, as "The
Search for Self" examines the individual's potential to offset the
technological future that awaits us. As Orson Welles put it,"the
momentum is established, the direction is up to us."
