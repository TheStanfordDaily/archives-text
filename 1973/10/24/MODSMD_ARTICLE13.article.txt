# Mostly Old Standbys
## Sly Gives Short? Solid Show 
### RONALD BECK 
One hour and forty minutes
after the announced starting time
at the Santa Clara County
Fairgrounds Exhibition Hall, the
promoter announced, "I notice a
great deal of tension. There's no
need to get excited, Sly is on the
fairgrounds and in five minutes,
we'll have a great rock and roll
show."
Ten minutes later, Sly and the
Family Stone made their entrance
in front of thousands of restless
spectators who had by then
started clapping in unison. Sly
started the concert by claiming
that "We'll play as long as they let
us. We came here to play. Do
what you like, 'cause we're gonna
do exactly as we please — to tell
you the truth — so you do the
same."
Sly laughed a lot as the group
of twelve performers opened their
set with a tight rendition of
"Thank Ya Fallettinme Be
Myself." The crowd, obviously
still upset after having waited
through a poor first act and an
hour long intermission, began to
come alive, dancing and singing
along with the group.
After the group finished "My
Lady," it was clear that this was a
well-rehearsed and polished
performance. The sound was
easily as good as any studio music
and would have made an
outstanding live album.
Sly then pretended to be
taking requests from the audience,
more specifically from one
outspoken spectator who seemed
to really please Sly. He laughed
and asked "What ... what d'ya
want to hear?," and despite a
different answer, the next song
was "I'm the One, You're the
One."
"Thank the Lord" started off
as fine hard rock and then turned
into some nice blues. It broke into
a fantastic version of "Stand" in
between which Sly gave a speech
on "doin' what you want," and
declaring that "I came out here to

party. That ain't no salespitch ...
just sumpthin' that crossed my
mind."
Their latest hit, "If You Want
Me To Stay," followed, and got a
tremendous response from the
crowd as soon as the first bass
guitar notes were played. Sly
made his only mistake here in
singing at the wrong time, but
laughed it right off.
The next two songs were
played like at Woodstock, with
"Dance to the Music" being
combined with "Higher." The

crowd at this point was dancing
frenetically and miming every
movement of Sly. In the middle
of "Higher," after fifty minutes of
very fine playing the whole group
left the stage. They encored about
a half minute later by finishing up
"Higher."
The fact that the concert was
so short in relation to the wait
was clearly underscored by the
realization that Sly had done
exactly what the crowd wanted.
He stuck to old favorites and
played them quite solidly.
