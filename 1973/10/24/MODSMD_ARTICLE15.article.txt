# Schedule Causes Cougar Nightmares
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Before the season started,
Washington State football coach
Jim Sweeney exclaimed, "We've
put together a superfeeling of
togetherness and goal
orientation."
But WSU publicist Mike Wilson
admitted to the Northern
California football writers
yesterday that after a six-week
succession of nightmares, "Super"
Sweeney isn't getting much sleep.
"Sweeney told me he sleeps
like a baby," Wilson said. "He
goes to bed every night, wakes up
in four hours and cries like hell."
Sweeney's tears are the result
of a treacherous early season
schedule that has left the Cougars
with a seemingly disastrous 1-5
record going into Saturday's game
against the Cards at Stanford
Stadium. But Wilson hastily
pointed out that the five losses
came against opponents with a
combined record of 25-3.
Those opponents (Kansas,
Arizona State, Ohio State, USC
and UCLA) are all ranked in the
nation's top 20, but except for
Ohio State and Kansas, all had to
fight for their lives against
Sweeney's stubborn Cougars.
WSU led Arizona State 7-6 late in
the game before losing 20-9, held
a 21-17 advantage over USC at
halftime (the Trojans eventually
prevailed, 46-35) and stymied
UCLA's explosive Wishbone for
two and a half quarters before
bowing to the Bruins, 24-13.
"There's no question that
Washington State is a fine football
team," said Stanford coach Jack
Christiansen, discounting the
Cougars' dismal records. "When
you watch the films you wonder
how they lost any games.
"Sweeney said before the
season that his personnel was as
good as USC's, and I don't think
he's far from wrong," Chris said.
A crowd of approximately
50,000 is expected for Saturday's
1:30 p.m. kickoff.

Cardinal Notes: Junior
defensive end Pat Donovan, who
made 11 tackles, recovered a
fumble and caused another in
Stanford's 23-14 victory over
Washington Saturday, has been
named Pacific Eight defensive
player of the week. Donovan,
center Bill Reid and kicker Rod
Garcia will be Stanford's captains
on Saturday.
Track coach Payton Jordan has
learned that shotputter Terry
Albritton, Stanford's
record-holder in the event with a
61-6V2 toss, won't compete for the
Cards this year. Albritton, who is
not enrolled in school this fall,
wants to build up his strength for
a year before competing again as a
collegian. Albritton's plans center
around the 1976 Olympics in
Montreal.
Jordan also said that the Cards
will lose the services of their best
discus thrower, Jim Howard.
Howard is also expected to return
to Stanford after spending this
year in Arizona.
Stanford freshman Marcy
O'Keefe has been ranked number
one in girls 18 singles in the
listings released this week by the
Northern California Tennis
Association. O'Keefe, who turned
professional last summer, is
ranked eighth nationally.
