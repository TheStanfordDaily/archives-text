# Stanford Invitational
## Women Host Golf Tourney 
### LIZ CHIANG 
Stanford's women's golf team
will face its first competitive test
of the season tomorrow and
Friday when the Cards host the
ninth annual Stanford Invitational
tournament. About 10 college
teams from the Southwest are
entered in the 36-hole, medal play
event.
The invitational is limited to
players who average better than

100 for 18 holes.
Each team will have two
entries, with Pat Cornett and
Chris Browning representing
Stanford. Cornett was the top
individual on last year's Stanford
team, which was the top collegiate
squad in California.
Coach Carol Diaz declined to
predict how Stanford will fare
tomorrow, but she singled out
defending champion Arizona
State, UCLA and Arizona as the
Cards' toughest competition.
Barbara Vetrano of San
Francisco State will defend her
individual title. Among the top
challengers in the individual
competition are Alex Rhinehardt

of New Mexico, Arizona's Paula
Eger, Sheryl Pastore of Hayward
State, Santa Rosa's Pam Palmieri
and Cornett.
A practice match last Friday
pitted Stanford against Hayward
State and Santa Clara, but no
scores were recorded.
"All of the girls were moaning
about how tough the course was,"
Diaz said. The rather long course,
full of creeks and trees, is one of
the most challenging in the
nation. It was ranked among the
100 toughest in the U.S. by Golf
Digest magazine in 1970.
Tee-off times tomorrow will
begin at 10 a.m. with Friday's
final round beginning at 8 a.m.
