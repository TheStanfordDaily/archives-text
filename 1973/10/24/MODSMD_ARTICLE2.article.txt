# Palo Alto To Beautify Downtown Location
## 
### 
Palo Alto's City Council approved a
million-dollar beautification project
last week, culminating 20 years of
effort.
The council members voted
unanimously to implement the overall
plan, though they differed slightly on
some related amendments, especially
those concerning the proposed
re-zoning of commercial land to a new
apartment-rehabilitation zone.
The council hopes to accept a
suitable bid for the improvements by
the first of next year and expects the
four-month construction period to be
completed by spring.
The renovations, financed by
downtown merchants and property
owners, will affect University Avenue
and the cross streets of Hamilton and
Lytton Avenues.
The design calls for replacing
present trees with a species of
sycamore — the London plane tree —
which will spread and produce a
canopy-like effect over the streets.
Ten-foot high mercury vapor lamps

will displace the 24-foot standards
which presently line the streets, and
will be spaced more closely to provide
fewer shadows and greater pedestrian
safety.
Vine-covered benches will line the
expanded sidewalks, which will attach
to the street via new brick strips.
The city will probably hold a
30-day trial soon to test the feasibility
of another change, the removal of
downtown parking meters.
Because the revenue brought by the
meters, $55,000 per year, barely
offsets their $49,000 maintenance
fees, Palo Alto will cover them for a
month, retaining meter monitors to
enforce the one-hour parking limit.
If the plan works, the meters will
be removed, "adding greatly to the
aesthetics," as Crystal Gamage,
executive director of Downtown Palo
Alto, Inc. explained.
Merchants and property owners are
pleased with the proposed changes,
after seeing eight previous plans
rejected in the past 20 years.
