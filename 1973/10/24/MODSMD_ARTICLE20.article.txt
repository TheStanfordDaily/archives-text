## The 						American Dream 
### Don Tollefson 
For most male children in our society, the
American Dream has nothing to do with a house on
Pennsylvania Ave. From the time of their first Little
League hit or first Pop Warner touchdown, most
American boys spend much of their time dreaming
of the Astrodome, Shea Stadium or Madison Square
Garden.
As a kid, you always hope that the overwhelming
percentages working against you apply only to the
other guys, but then you start dropping the routine
pop-ups. And soon it becomes clear that the closest
you'll ever get to home plate at Candlestick Park is
the 50 feet that separates it from the first row of
box seats.
No one should ever dismiss their dreams lightly.
But the road to maturity should include a
continually sharpened sense of the possible. Reach
for the sky, but don't be shocked when you
discover how short your arms are.
Unfortunately, children are only the victims of
an adult world intoxicated with success. Few sights
appal me as much as the frustrated athlete whose
children are little more than puppets designed to
inflate his adolescently bruised ego. I am only
surprised that more kids don't throw out their arms
as nine year old Little Leaguers.
The childish, frustrated man is perhaps
epitomized by the father who recklessly pushes his
own children in seek of personal ego fulfillment, but
there are other, more subtle manifestations of this
syndrome.
One is the entire mythology which surrounds the
pro athletes so many fathers want their sons to
become. Too many fans see athletes as extremely
happy and fulfilled people who are paid extravagant
sums for doing things which they find almost always
enjoyable. The athletes are portrayed as people high
on life, who command respect from all men and
fond glances from all women.
In recent years this dreamy vision of the world of
pro athletes has suffered from a confrontation with
reality. As athletes have become more frank and

outspoken, the sports world's dirty laundry has
begun to escape the hierarchy's washing machine. Is
nothing sacred?
As drugs and drug abuse became a passionate
national concern in the 60s, the use of drugs among
athletes received more and more publicity. But that
was only the start of a long list of developments
which have profoundly altered the Fantasyland
model of pro athletes.
One of the most recent and potentially profound
developments involves increased militancy on the
part of athletes. On their way to winning a second
straight World Series, the Oakland A's came near to
open warfare with their owner, Charlie Finley. But
the A's are not alone in this respect.
Last year there was the baseball player's strike
which centered around the Curt Flood dispute. This
past summer there was the Wimbledon walkout,
which was almost unanimous among male pro tennis
players. Most recently there was a threatened
American Basketball Association players' strike,
which was averted only hours before the league's
season began.
Many sports fans see this increased militancy as
"bad" for athletics, but it is only a logical outcome
of the increasing big business orientation of all
sports. The merits of this increased militancy can be
debated extensively, but it cannot be denied that it
is a vivid reminder that the world of pro sports is
made of more than sugar and spice and everything
nice.
Besides the obvious physical value, there are
many benefits for children which accrue from
athletics. But those benefits can be nullified if a
child has an improper attitude or expectations.
Children should try their hardest, but they should
be taught that center field in the Astrodome is
pretty hard to make. And under no circumstances
should they be pushed by a father whose concern
grows only out of his own frustration at having
never made it past the stands. When those
motivations prevail, everyone loses.
