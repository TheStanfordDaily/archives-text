$2 Million Promised To Nixon
WASHINGTON — The dairy industry promised
President Nixon $2 million in re-election
contributions two weeks before the President
imposed import quotas on ice cream and other dairy
products, it was disclosed yesterday.
The promise was contained in a letter sent to
Nixon Dec. 16, 1970 by Patrick J. Hillings, lawyer
for the Associated Milk Producers, Inc. A copy of
the letter was obtained by The Associated Press.
Public records show the quotas were imposed Dec.
31, 1970 by presidential proclamation.
"This letter discusses a matter of some delicacy
and of significant political impact," Hillings said in
the opening paragraph.
He said the milk producers' group had donated
$135,000 to Republican candidates in the 1970
mid-term elections and said the group was working
to set up "appropriate channels for AMPI to
contribute $2 million for your re-election."
Copies of the letter have been made available to
the Senate Watergate committee and other
investigators.
Cox Stays In Washington
WASHINGTON — Former special Watergate
prosecutor Archibald Cox promised yesterday to
remain in Washington as long as he feels his presence

"will help make clear the very fundamental
questions facing our constitutional system."
Cox issued a brief statement after a nearly
two-hour session yesterday in the special
prosecutor's offices where he said farewell to his
80-member staff who munched cookies and sipped
soft drinks.
A spokesman said there were some tears during
Cox's farewell statement delivered privately to his
staff. The farewell party was described as very
friendly and not at all sad.
"I do intend to be available for as long as I think
my presence will help make clear the very
fundamental questions our constitutional system
faces and the integrity of our government
operations that are before the Congress and the
American people at this time," Cox said.
Tho Refuses Nobel Prize
TOKYO — North Vietnam's Le Due Tho said he
cannot accept the Nobel Peace Prize he shares with
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger because the
Vietnam war has not really ended. A Hanoi
broadcast carried Tho's message.
Aase Lionaes, chairwoman of the Nobel
committee, announced the joint award last week.
Tho and Kissinger were chosen, she said, because
they had settled the Vietnam War through
negotiations and not through further fighting.

Man Claims Sex Discrimination
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court agreed
yesterday to consider for the first time a sex
discrimination case brought by a man. The case
involves Florida tax advantages given only to
widows.
The court will hear arguments this winter on a
challenge by Miami widower Mel Kahn to the state's
$500 real estate tax exemption for widows.
In several decisions last term, the court showed a
sensitivity to women's rights and to discrimination
based on sex.
Florida Atty. Gen. Robert L. Shevin argued that
the state could justify its aid for widows by
demonstrating statistically that women heads of
households suffer greater economic ills than their
male counterparts.
Kahn's attorney countered that as property
owners, widows and widowers should be entitled to
the same treatment.

Tho Refuses Nobel Prize
TOKYO — North Vietnam's Le Due Tho said he
cannot accept the Nobel Peace Prize he shares with
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger because the
Vietnam war has not really ended. A Hanoi
broadcast carried Tho's message.
Aase Lionaes, chairwoman of the Nobel
committee, announced the joint award last week.
Tho and Kissinger were chosen, she said, because
they had settled the Vietnam War through
negotiations and not through further fighting.

Man Claims Sex Discrimination
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court agreed
yesterday to consider for the first time a sex
discrimination case brought by a man. The case
involves Florida tax advantages given only to
widows.
The court will hear arguments this winter on a
challenge by Miami widower Mel Kahn to the state's
$500 real estate tax exemption for widows.
In several decisions last term, the court showed a
sensitivity to women's rights and to discrimination
based on sex.
Florida Atty. Gen. Robert L. Shevin argued that
the state could justify its aid for widows by
demonstrating statistically that women heads of
households suffer greater economic ills than their
male counterparts.
Kahn's attorney countered that as property
owners, widows and widowers should be entitled to
the same treatment.
Today's Weather
Fair this morning but with patchy fog. Increasing
cloudiness today, then partly cloudy tonight and
tomorrow. Warmer days. Lows in the upper 40s to
mid 50s. Highs in the 60s and low 70s. Westerly
winds 10 to 20 mph.
$2 Million Promised To Nixon
WASHINGTON — The dairy industry promised
President Nixon $2 million in re-election
contributions two weeks before the President
imposed import quotas on ice cream and other dairy
products, it was disclosed yesterday.
The promise was contained in a letter sent to
Nixon Dec. 16, 1970 by Patrick J. Hillings, lawyer
for the Associated Milk Producers, Inc. A copy of
the letter was obtained by The Associated Press.
Public records show the quotas were imposed Dec.
31, 1970 by presidential proclamation.
"This letter discusses a matter of some delicacy
and of significant political impact," Hillings said in
the opening paragraph.
He said the milk producers' group had donated
$135,000 to Republican candidates in the 1970
mid-term elections and said the group was working
to set up "appropriate channels for AMPI to
contribute $2 million for your re-election."
Copies of the letter have been made available to
the Senate Watergate committee and other
investigators.
Cox Stays In Washington
WASHINGTON — Former special Watergate
prosecutor Archibald Cox promised yesterday to
remain in Washington as long as he feels his presence

"will help make clear the very fundamental
questions facing our constitutional system."
Cox issued a brief statement after a nearly
two-hour session yesterday in the special
prosecutor's offices where he said farewell to his
80-member staff who munched cookies and sipped
soft drinks.
A spokesman said there were some tears during
Cox's farewell statement delivered privately to his
staff. The farewell party was described as very
friendly and not at all sad.
"I do intend to be available for as long as I think
my presence will help make clear the very
fundamental questions our constitutional system
faces and the integrity of our government
operations that are before the Congress and the
American people at this time," Cox said.
