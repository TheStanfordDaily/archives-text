# Conservationist Speaks
## 
### 
Paul Bruce Smith, former president
of the Committee for Green Foothills,
last night advocated the creation of a
"regional environmental planning
board" to deal with problems that are
beyond the administrative capability
of local government.
In his evening presentation in
Tresidder, sponsored by the Stanford
chapter of the California Republican
League, the Sierra Club member
decried the "growth is good"

shibboleth of land developers and the
"boom" psychology of local
politicians.
Attempting to destroy the theory
that development "necessarily
increases the tax base," the Mountain
View attorney claimed that when
"police, fire, sanitation, and utility
costs" are assessed, "long-term debt"
is generally the result.
Asserting that legislators believe
"the priority of the people is low,"
Smith nevertheless maintained that the
new salience of environmental issues,
and the "power of public opinion"
have made officials more willing to
"resist special interests."
He cautioned however that the
mounting of effective conservation
campaigns required a commitment to
"research on problems" and
"continual political involvement"
from the local level "all the way to
Sacramento."
