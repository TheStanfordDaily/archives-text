# Egypt OKs Israeli Plan For Second Cease-Fire
##

From The Associated Press
An Israeli government spokesman
last night announced that Egypt had
agreed to a second cease-fire in the
Arab-Israeli war, and Israeli forces on
the Egyptian front were ordered to lay
down their arms at 10 p.m. (PDT)
yesterday.
The second cease-fire order came in
response to a renewed appeal from the
U.N. Security Council after the first
truce proclaimed on Monday was
followed by hard fighting on both the
Egyptian and Syrian fronts.
The spokesman said Defense
Minister Moshe Dayan proposed the
new cease-fire hour to Maj. Gen. Ensio
P.H. Siilasvuu, the U.N. truce
supervisor for the Middle East, and he
transmitted it to Egypt. Egypt's
affirmative reply was transmitted
about 75 minutes before the time
suggested by Dayan.
CBS Radio reported last night that
Dayan and Siilasvuu were conferring
about where to place U.N. observers
on the cease-fire line.

There was no immediate word from
Cairo on the Israeli announcement of
the cease-fire.
Earlier Syria had broken its lengthy
silence to accept the council's initial
call for a truce.
Second Resolution
The Security Council's second
cease-fire resolution also called for
U.N. observers in the troubled area,
and it asked the combatants to return
to positions they occupied at
Monday's first truce deadline.
U.N. Secretary-General Kurt
Waldheim told the council last night
that the Syrian government, which had
remained silent since Monday's initial
call for a fighting halt, had accepted
the first appeal.
Waldheim quoted the Damascus
communication as saying the Syrian
government understood the truce "is
based on the complete withdrawal of
Israeli forces from all Syrian
territories" occupied since the six-day
war of June 1967.
Combat Continues
Meanwhile, clashes between
Egyptian and Israeli troops continued
before the cease-fire along the Suez
Canal. The Israeli navy attacked Syrian
oil installations in Banias harbor and
Palestinian guerrillas were active
against Israeli settlements along the
Lebanese border, an Israeli military
spokesman said.
Monday's cease-fire appeal at the
United Nations had called for a start in
activating a Security Council
resolution passed after the 1967 war.
This provided for an Israeli pullback
from occupied Arab territory to
"secure borders" in return for Arab
recognition of the Jewish nation.
Israel has never made clear just how
much of the occupied territory it
wants to retain in order to give itself
defensible frontiers. But it says it
holds more than 1000 additional
square miles of Egyptian and Syrian
territory seized since this latest war
began Oct. 6.
About the same time Waldheim
announced Syria's acceptance, the
Syrian command issued a communique
saying it sank an Israeli gunboat in
countering a helicopter and ship attack
on "civilian targets on the coast at
Latakia and Baniam."
In Washington, Pentagon sources
said the United States had slightly

reduced its more than 20
flights-per-day airlift of weapons to
Israel, but officials cautioned against
inferring any diplomatic message from
that reduction. They described it as a
normal fluctuation and said Moscow
had made a parallel but slightly higher
decline in Soviet airlift of arms'
delivery to Syria and Egypt.
Yesterday's cease-fire resolution
was approved 14-0 in an emergency
session of the 15-member Security
Council.
