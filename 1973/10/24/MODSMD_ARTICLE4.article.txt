# Support For First Amendment
## Press Monitor Asks Public Aid 
### KEVIN SMITH 
National News Council Chairman
Roger Traynor said yesterday,"The
First Amendment is just as much a
concern of the general public as it is of
the news media."
The former California Supreme
Court Chief Justice defended the
National News Council before 150
persons in a communication class and
on KZSU's Campus Conference
program.
The Council, which was established
this year, receives complaints against
national suppliers of news, including
the major television networks, the wire
services, and the syndicated news
services. It has come under criticism
from most news media which consider
the Council harmful to a free and
uncensored press.
Traynor declared it was "utterly
and completely ridiculous" to argue
that the National News Council will
have a chilling effect on the news
media.
"Just as justice is not the sole
prerogative of the courts," Traynor
said, "so the protection of First
Amendment freedoms is not the sole
prerogative of the news media."
Advocates of the Council feel it will
help restore public confidence in the
news media. According to Traynor,
the actions of the Council hopefully
will "raise the percentage of [last
year's] Harris poll" which showed
only 18 percent of the public trusted
the print media, while only 17 percent
trusted television news.
Contesting the charges that the

Council represents the first step
toward government control of news
media, Traynor said he has "a great
fear and horror [of] the government
moving in on the media."
Traynor said the Council has the
duty to "protect and preserve the
freedom of the press ... and to afford
an opportunity for people who have a
grievance to have that grievance
aired."
He admitted that the Council has
no enforcement powers and said that
the Council's major weapon is
publicity of its decisions.

Traynor said a decision in favor of a
complainant would "give the
complainant vindication of his
grievance" and would set "a precedent
for other news media to follow."
The fifteen member Council just
finished moving into its New York
headquarters, and Traynor conceded,
"Not many people are aware of the
News Council as yet."
"We did get one complaint which
said that every time [ABC]
anchorman Harry Reasoner mentions
our President, he has a leer," Traynor
recounted. "I don't think we'll take up
that one."

"Just as justice is not the sole
prerogative of the courts," Traynor
said, "so the protection of First
Amendment freedoms is not the sole
prerogative of the news media."
Advocates of the Council feel it will
help restore public confidence in the
news media. According to Traynor,
the actions of the Council hopefully
will "raise the percentage of [last
year's] Harris poll" which showed
only 18 percent of the public trusted
the print media, while only 17 percent
trusted television news.
Contesting the charges that the

Council represents the first step
toward government control of news
media, Traynor said he has "a great
fear and horror [of] the government
moving in on the media."
Traynor said the Council has the
duty to "protect and preserve the
freedom of the press ... and to afford
an opportunity for people who have a
grievance to have that grievance
aired."
He admitted that the Council has
no enforcement powers and said that
the Council's major weapon is
publicity of its decisions.

Traynor said a decision in favor of a
complainant would "give the
complainant vindication of his
grievance" and would set "a precedent
for other news media to follow."
The fifteen member Council just
finished moving into its New York
headquarters, and Traynor conceded,
"Not many people are aware of the
News Council as yet."
"We did get one complaint which
said that every time [ABC]
anchorman Harry Reasoner mentions
our President, he has a leer," Traynor
recounted. "I don't think we'll take up
that one."

DEFENDS COUNCIL — National News Council Chairman Roger Traynor spoke
yesterday before 150 persons in a communication class and on KZSU's Campus
Conference program. Traynor is a former California Supreme Court Chief
Justice.
National News Council Chairman
Roger Traynor said yesterday,"The
First Amendment is just as much a
concern of the general public as it is of
the news media."
The former California Supreme
Court Chief Justice defended the
National News Council before 150
persons in a communication class and
on KZSU's Campus Conference
program.
The Council, which was established
this year, receives complaints against
national suppliers of news, including
the major television networks, the wire
services, and the syndicated news
services. It has come under criticism
from most news media which consider
the Council harmful to a free and
uncensored press.
Traynor declared it was "utterly
and completely ridiculous" to argue
that the National News Council will
have a chilling effect on the news
media.
"Just as justice is not the sole
prerogative of the courts," Traynor
said, "so the protection of First
Amendment freedoms is not the sole
prerogative of the news media."
Advocates of the Council feel it will
help restore public confidence in the
