# Freaky Airline Offers Low Rates
## 
### JANET SANDERS 
What would a 30-year-old freak do with a million
dollars in an economic system he despises?
It took Kenneth Moss three years of traveling
around the world and a short stay in a La Honda
cowshed before he could make up his mind. Finally,
his girlfriend, 21-year-old Darcy Flynn, suggested
that they "buy a plane to go to Bali," and the
Freelandia air-travel club was born.
The nonprofit corporation, organized "for and
by the people," owns a shocking yellow DCB which
crisscrosses the nation at incredibly cheap rates. For
a $50 annual membership fee, one can hop over to
New York for $69 or down to Los Angeles for
$12.50.
Getting there on the freakiest "airline" in the
world is half the fun.
Occasional Parties
Flights feature rock music, organic food, an
assortment of games and occasional parties thrown
by celebrities such as Stevie Wonder. Stewardesses
in Flash Gordon uniforms circulate through the
plane's four lounges to serve champagne, beer and
freshly squeezed fruit juices.
The three-month-old club is run like a
cooperative, said Moss, who claimed he is not
getting "a damn thing moneywise" out of the
venture. "The members decide where they want to
go, and when we have excess funds, they decide
how to use them," he explained.
The six-person Board of Directors, elected by the
1500 members, recently planned special trips to
Peru to see a comet and to Columbia to view a solar
eclipse. They also approved a benefit flight for the

Connie Stevens Tennis Tournament to raise money
for Vietnamese children's hospitals.
'Hooking Up'
We're just hooking up a community," said Flynn,
adding that Freelandia won't get off the ground
without everyone's participation. "I just hope the
idea isn't too late."
The project was probably just in time for its
founder Moss, who has spent the last 10 years
agonizing over what he wanted to do with his life.
Kicked out of New York's Syracuse University
twice, Moss would "sit on park benches trying to
figure out how I could involve myself in a system I
didn't like." Although he had held down a
stockbroakerage job for only one week, Wall Street,
"the place to get money quick," seemed to be the
answer to his dilemma.
At age 24, Moss had fulfilled his college dream,
to the tune of $1.5 million. A wild, speculative
stock market, his own company and "lucky
hunches" supplied him with an $850-a-month Park
Avenue penthouse where nine telephones constantly
jangled.
'Insane'
"It was insane," Moss recalled. "I became a
human money-making machine — on the telephone
at any hour of the day or night, making deals with
other men I knew only by the sound of their
voices."
When his three-year-old niece told him that "all
you ever do is talk," Moss liquidated his assets and
dropped out of New York's financial whirl with
only an aging Rolls Royce to remind him of those
wildly wealthy days.

After sampling the life of an international
vagabond for three years, Moss returned to New
York where he met Flynn.
"He would wear the same pair of blue jeans for
three months," she remembered. "I didn't know he
was a millionaire until I read about him in Time
magazine."
Cowshed Home
The pair, bored with New York, moved out to La
Honda last year where Moss' sister owns a small
cottage. They industriously set out to convert an
old cowshed into an inhabitable home, furnishing it
withsecond-handarticles and a water bed for the dirt
floor.
"We loved it," said Flynn, that is, until the
autumn rain began to soak the rustic dwelling's
interior as much as it did the pasture outside.
Restless again, Moss thought about what he could
do with his millions.
After vetoing ideas of buying a southern
California date farm and starting an organic food
store chain, the couple decided to buy an airplane.
When a search through the Yellow Pages failed to
yield a seller, they took to the road to find one,
sleeping in the dilapidated Rolls as they traveled
from city to city.
Their efforts were rewarded three months ago
when National Airlines agreed to sell a six-year-old
DCB for $750,000. Freelandia was underway.
Now Moss again has an office, this time in Los
Angeles, although he swears that the operation will
not become like the life he once led at Wall Street.
"You learn from your mistakes," he said
emphatically.

Honda last year where Moss' sister owns a small
cottage. They industriously set out to convert an
old cowshed into an inhabitable home, furnishing it
withsecond-handarticles and a water bed for the dirt
floor.
"We loved it," said Flynn, that is, until the
autumn rain began to soak the rustic dwelling's
interior as much as it did the pasture outside.
Restless again, Moss thought about what he could
do with his millions.
After vetoing ideas of buying a southern
California date farm and starting an organic food
store chain, the couple decided to buy an airplane.
When a search through the Yellow Pages failed to
yield a seller, they took to the road to find one,
sleeping in the dilapidated Rolls as they traveled
from city to city.
Their efforts were rewarded three months ago
when National Airlines agreed to sell a six-year-old
DCB for $750,000. Freelandia was underway.
Now Moss again has an office, this time in Los
Angeles, although he swears that the operation will
not become like the life he once led at Wall Street.
"You learn from your mistakes," he said
emphatically.

UP, UP AND AWAY — Kenneth Moss provided the money and Darcy Flynn the
idea for the Freelandia air-travel club which flies throughout the nation at
incredibly cheap rates.
What would a 30-year-old freak do with a million
dollars in an economic system he despises?
It took Kenneth Moss three years of traveling
around the world and a short stay in a La Honda
cowshed before he could make up his mind. Finally,
his girlfriend, 21-year-old Darcy Flynn, suggested
that they "buy a plane to go to Bali," and the
Freelandia air-travel club was born.
The nonprofit corporation, organized "for and
by the people," owns a shocking yellow DCB which
crisscrosses the nation at incredibly cheap rates. For
a $50 annual membership fee, one can hop over to
New York for $69 or down to Los Angeles for
$12.50.
Getting there on the freakiest "airline" in the
world is half the fun.
Occasional Parties
Flights feature rock music, organic food, an
assortment of games and occasional parties thrown
by celebrities such as Stevie Wonder. Stewardesses
in Flash Gordon uniforms circulate through the
plane's four lounges to serve champagne, beer and
freshly squeezed fruit juices.
The three-month-old club is run like a
cooperative, said Moss, who claimed he is not
getting "a damn thing moneywise" out of the
venture. "The members decide where they want to
go, and when we have excess funds, they decide
how to use them," he explained.
The six-person Board of Directors, elected by the
1500 members, recently planned special trips to
Peru to see a comet and to Columbia to view a solar
eclipse. They also approved a benefit flight for the

Connie Stevens Tennis Tournament to raise money
for Vietnamese children's hospitals.
'Hooking Up'
We're just hooking up a community," said Flynn,
adding that Freelandia won't get off the ground
without everyone's participation. "I just hope the
idea isn't too late."
The project was probably just in time for its
founder Moss, who has spent the last 10 years
agonizing over what he wanted to do with his life.
Kicked out of New York's Syracuse University
twice, Moss would "sit on park benches trying to
figure out how I could involve myself in a system I
didn't like." Although he had held down a
stockbroakerage job for only one week, Wall Street,
"the place to get money quick," seemed to be the
answer to his dilemma.
At age 24, Moss had fulfilled his college dream,
to the tune of $1.5 million. A wild, speculative
stock market, his own company and "lucky
hunches" supplied him with an $850-a-month Park
Avenue penthouse where nine telephones constantly
jangled.
'Insane'
"It was insane," Moss recalled. "I became a
human money-making machine — on the telephone
at any hour of the day or night, making deals with
other men I knew only by the sound of their
voices."
When his three-year-old niece told him that "all
you ever do is talk," Moss liquidated his assets and
dropped out of New York's financial whirl with
only an aging Rolls Royce to remind him of those
wildly wealthy days.

After sampling the life of an international
vagabond for three years, Moss returned to New
York where he met Flynn.
"He would wear the same pair of blue jeans for
three months," she remembered. "I didn't know he
was a millionaire until I read about him in Time
magazine."

figure out how I could involve myself in a system I
didn't like." Although he had held down a
stockbroakerage job for only one week, Wall Street,
"the place to get money quick," seemed to be the
answer to his dilemma.
At age 24, Moss had fulfilled his college dream,
to the tune of $1.5 million. A wild, speculative
stock market, his own company and "lucky
hunches" supplied him with an $850-a-month Park
Avenue penthouse where nine telephones constantly
jangled.
'Insane'
"It was insane," Moss recalled. "I became a
human money-making machine — on the telephone
at any hour of the day or night, making deals with
other men I knew only by the sound of their
voices."
When his three-year-old niece told him that "all
you ever do is talk," Moss liquidated his assets and
dropped out of New York's financial whirl with
only an aging Rolls Royce to remind him of those
wildly wealthy days.

After sampling the life of an international
vagabond for three years, Moss returned to New
York where he met Flynn.
"He would wear the same pair of blue jeans for
three months," she remembered. "I didn't know he
was a millionaire until I read about him in Time
magazine."
Cowshed Home
The pair, bored with New York, moved out to La
Honda last year where Moss' sister owns a small
cottage. They industriously set out to convert an
old cowshed into an inhabitable home, furnishing it
withsecond-handarticles and a water bed for the dirt
floor.
"We loved it," said Flynn, that is, until the
autumn rain began to soak the rustic dwelling's
interior as much as it did the pasture outside.
Restless again, Moss thought about what he could
do with his millions.
After vetoing ideas of buying a southern
California date farm and starting an organic food
store chain, the couple decided to buy an airplane.
When a search through the Yellow Pages failed to
yield a seller, they took to the road to find one,
sleeping in the dilapidated Rolls as they traveled
from city to city.
Their efforts were rewarded three months ago
when National Airlines agreed to sell a six-year-old
DCB for $750,000. Freelandia was underway.
Now Moss again has an office, this time in Los
Angeles, although he swears that the operation will
not become like the life he once led at Wall Street.
"You learn from your mistakes," he said
emphatically.

idea for the Freelandia air-travel club which flies throughout the nation at
incredibly cheap rates.
