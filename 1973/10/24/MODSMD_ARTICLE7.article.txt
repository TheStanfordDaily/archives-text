# Possible Victory In '76
## Kennedy's Chances Look Promising 
### 
Larry Sullivan

Heading everybody's list of
Democratic Presidential hopefuls
is the senior Senator from
Massachusetts, Edward M.
Kennedy. Also-rans like Muskie,
Humphrey and Jackson
acknowledge him to be the
front-runner. The dark horses like
Bayh and Mondale won't move till
his intentions are crystallized. The
Republicans assume he will be
their target, barring assassination
or his refusal to run.
It is not too early to ask the
questions that will determine if
Kennedy will sit in the White
House at the beginning of the
Republic's third century. Is he
qualified to be President? If so,
can he win?
As to the first question, it's
interesting to note how many
Democrats and Independents
restate it: aren't there others in
the Party more qualified, they
ask. While this is an interesting
problem, it may not be relevant in
the Democratic primaries.
Kennedy will have the
advantages of enormous grass-root
support, the love of most of the
old pols and the respect if not the
affection of labor. The polls show
him outdistancing everyone. In
the crucial Wisconsin and
California campaigns, the image of
the exile returning to claim his
kingdom after his brothers' death
will be of considerable importance
in determining the outcome.
Whether McGovern or Mondale
are the "best men" will be
forgotten in the wash.
Qualifications
At first glance Kennedy's
qualifications are a decidedly
mixed bag. On the one hand is his
well-publicized cheating incident
.at Harvard; his lackluster grades in
college and law school; his
enlistment in the Army which
necessitated his father's
intervention to reduce his term
from three to two years (Kennedy
;signed the papers without looking
or, others say, without caring); his
mediocre career as an Assistant
D.A. in Boston and the fact that
not until Chappaquidick did he
show informed, mature judgment,
tested in difficult conditions. It is
said that Kennedy had more
charm than his brothers, but far
less drive and intellect than
Robert, and less political savvy
than John. From all this many
have concluded that Teddy lacks
the ability to perform the duties
of President.
Kennedy has the potential to
be a great President. His
sensitivity to political movements
and his willingness to compromise
are underestimated. He is
educable to a far greater extent
than most of the ideologues who
crowd the scene. Most
importantly, he has grown in the
Senate as a man and as a politician
— far more than anyone expected
when he first took his seat.
If Kennedy makes the run he
will have several assets, not the
least of which will be his
not-so-secret cabinet of New

Frontiersmen. At a drop of the
hat into the proverbial ring,
Teddy can be surrounded by a
stable of advisers, ex-cabinet
officials and speech writers.
Among them in '76 look for
Robert McNamara, Theodore
Sorenson, Sargent Shriver, John
Kenneth Galbraith (and most of
Harvard), Arthur Schlesinger,
George Ball (a likely choice for
Secretary of State in a Kennedy
cabinet), John Tunney and a
thousand others.
I say this group is an asset not
because of their wisdom or special
ability to govern — that is surely
debatable. Rather their worth
lies in their ability to put
Democratic pols and labor leaders
at ease. They are known and
trusted quantities to these men,
who were pushed out of the party
in '72 or scared out by their
nightmares of marijuana crazed
McGovernites in the White House.
The Kennedy people have the
connections to keep the Jackson
right in the party if and when
Teddy wins the nomination.
Keeping Wallace placated will, of
course, be their major task.
Establishment Credentials
At the same time Teddy's men
possess the Establishment
credentials to keep Big Business
and Big Money from freaking out
and launching a do-or-die fight
behind the Republican
standard-bearer. Wall Street will
certainly not go Democratic, but
they may come to view Teddy in
the same light as J.F.K. — an evil
with which they can live.
Kennedys have fought the WASP
Establishment throughout the
family history, and they are
experts on the beast.
Kennedy's other great
advantage is the family money,
estimated variously at 50, 100 or
200 million dollars. A public
financing bill will not effect this
unless it is unusually strict and
well drafted.
His drawbacks are legion.
Chappaquidick could be bad news
if properly managed by
Republican image-makers. None
of the Big Three — Rockefeller,
Reagan and Connally — would be
adverse to a Watergate backlash
strategy. The public in 1976 will
certainly not be adverse to a Mr.
Clean candidacy. Kennedy has
relied on the Nixon strategy of
sitting on the issue until people
get tired of discussing it.
Old Wounds
Whether a campaign would
reopen the old wounds is more
likely than not. Kennedy could
not "get ahead of it" by open
declarations of innocence without
making it a central issue. Nor
could he sit still while his
opponent made insidious
comparisons between bad drivers
and wiretappers. In the end
Chappaquidick would be painful
but not decisive if Kennedy
insisted on a strict discussion of
substantive issues — above all, the
economy.

A second weakness in a
Kennedy campaign is the recent
family history: rumors of drinking
and womanizing; his
"arrangement" with Joan to go
their separate ways every so often;
young Joe Kennedy's use of
drugs. If anything keeps Kennedy
out of the race to begin with, it
will be the loss of all privacy
coupled with the inevitable fear of
assassination.
If one postulates the 1970s as a
time of social retrenchment, then
Kennedy's weakest point may be
his politics. The whole idea of a
New Frontier II or a return to the
progressive 60s with its
concommitant violence and rapid
change may alienate millions of
voters. That the 200 th anniversary
is a perfect time for another "let's
get moving" campaign is a popular
notion in liberal circles. Yet, a
Reagan plea for retroversion or a
Connally-Rockefeller call for
benign neglect may sway the
nation in the final tallies.
As to the opposition, it seems
clear that Reagan, Rockefeller or
Connally will get the Republican
nod. While the Gallup poll showed
Charles Percy as being the only
G.O.P. candidate besting Kennedy

this was in large part a temporary
response to Percy's early criticism
of Nixon on Watergate. Percy,
Baker or Hatfield cannot in all
probability develop the voter
identification, grass-root support
in their party or money to win the
nomination.
The Party is still a combination
of Goldwater-Nixon conservatives
and Wall Street moderates with a
mere sprinkling of Ripon
liberalism.
Kennedy will stand the best
chance against Reagan with his
extremism or Connally with his
connections to the oil and gas
interests (if cars have no fuel in
1976, it is certain that oil men
will not top the Most Admired
list). Only Rockefeller could
establish a moderate, statesmen's
image that could conceivably
deny Kennedy the American
center. It's a good bet that
Rockefeller is the least likely of
the three to be nominated by a
convention certain to be
dominated by Goldwater-Nixon
Republicans. Hence, if Edward
Kennedy choose to run, I believe
he will win the Presidency.

are the "best men" will be

Qualifications
At first glance Kennedy's
qualifications are a decidedly
mixed bag. On the one hand is his
well-publicized cheating incident
.at Harvard; his lackluster grades in
college and law school; his
enlistment in the Army which
necessitated his father's
intervention to reduce his term
from three to two years (Kennedy
;signed the papers without looking
or, others say, without caring); his
mediocre career as an Assistant
D.A. in Boston and the fact that
not until Chappaquidick did he
show informed, mature judgment,
tested in difficult conditions. It is
said that Kennedy had more
charm than his brothers, but far
less drive and intellect than
Robert, and less political savvy
than John. From all this many
have concluded that Teddy lacks
the ability to perform the duties
of President.
Kennedy has the potential to
be a great President. His
sensitivity to political movements
and his willingness to compromise
are underestimated. He is
educable to a far greater extent
than most of the ideologues who
crowd the scene. Most
importantly, he has grown in the
Senate as a man and as a politician
— far more than anyone expected
when he first took his seat.
If Kennedy makes the run he
will have several assets, not the
least of which will be his
not-so-secret cabinet of New

Frontiersmen. At a drop of the
hat into the proverbial ring,
Teddy can be surrounded by a
stable of advisers, ex-cabinet
officials and speech writers.
Among them in '76 look for
Robert McNamara, Theodore
Sorenson, Sargent Shriver, John
Kenneth Galbraith (and most of
Harvard), Arthur Schlesinger,
George Ball (a likely choice for
Secretary of State in a Kennedy
cabinet), John Tunney and a
thousand others.
I say this group is an asset not
because of their wisdom or special
ability to govern — that is surely
debatable. Rather their worth
lies in their ability to put
Democratic pols and labor leaders
at ease. They are known and
trusted quantities to these men,
who were pushed out of the party
in '72 or scared out by their
nightmares of marijuana crazed
McGovernites in the White House.
The Kennedy people have the
connections to keep the Jackson
right in the party if and when
Teddy wins the nomination.
Keeping Wallace placated will, of
course, be their major task.
Establishment Credentials
At the same time Teddy's men
possess the Establishment
credentials to keep Big Business
and Big Money from freaking out
and launching a do-or-die fight
behind the Republican
standard-bearer. Wall Street will
certainly not go Democratic, but
they may come to view Teddy in
the same light as J.F.K. — an evil
with which they can live.
Kennedys have fought the WASP
Establishment throughout the
family history, and they are
experts on the beast.
Kennedy's other great
advantage is the family money,
estimated variously at 50, 100 or
200 million dollars. A public
financing bill will not effect this
unless it is unusually strict and
well drafted.
His drawbacks are legion.
Chappaquidick could be bad news
if properly managed by
Republican image-makers. None
of the Big Three — Rockefeller,
Reagan and Connally — would be
adverse to a Watergate backlash
strategy. The public in 1976 will
certainly not be adverse to a Mr.
Clean candidacy. Kennedy has
relied on the Nixon strategy of
sitting on the issue until people
get tired of discussing it.
Old Wounds
Whether a campaign would
reopen the old wounds is more
likely than not. Kennedy could
not "get ahead of it" by open
declarations of innocence without
making it a central issue. Nor
could he sit still while his
opponent made insidious
comparisons between bad drivers
and wiretappers. In the end
Chappaquidick would be painful
but not decisive if Kennedy
insisted on a strict discussion of
substantive issues — above all, the
economy.

A second weakness in a
Kennedy campaign is the recent
family history: rumors of drinking
and womanizing; his
"arrangement" with Joan to go
their separate ways every so often;
young Joe Kennedy's use of
drugs. If anything keeps Kennedy
out of the race to begin with, it
will be the loss of all privacy
coupled with the inevitable fear of
assassination.
If one postulates the 1970s as a
time of social retrenchment, then
Kennedy's weakest point may be
his politics. The whole idea of a
New Frontier II or a return to the
progressive 60s with its
concommitant violence and rapid
change may alienate millions of
voters. That the 200 th anniversary
is a perfect time for another "let's
get moving" campaign is a popular
notion in liberal circles. Yet, a
Reagan plea for retroversion or a
Connally-Rockefeller call for
benign neglect may sway the
nation in the final tallies.
As to the opposition, it seems
clear that Reagan, Rockefeller or
Connally will get the Republican
nod. While the Gallup poll showed
Charles Percy as being the only
G.O.P. candidate besting Kennedy

this was in large part a temporary
response to Percy's early criticism
of Nixon on Watergate. Percy,
Baker or Hatfield cannot in all
probability develop the voter
identification, grass-root support
in their party or money to win the
nomination.
The Party is still a combination
of Goldwater-Nixon conservatives
and Wall Street moderates with a
mere sprinkling of Ripon
liberalism.
Kennedy will stand the best
chance against Reagan with his
extremism or Connally with his
connections to the oil and gas
interests (if cars have no fuel in
1976, it is certain that oil men
will not top the Most Admired
list). Only Rockefeller could
establish a moderate, statesmen's
image that could conceivably
deny Kennedy the American
center. It's a good bet that
Rockefeller is the least likely of
the three to be nominated by a
convention certain to be
dominated by Goldwater-Nixon
Republicans. Hence, if Edward
Kennedy choose to run, I believe
he will win the Presidency.

will have several assets, not the
least of which will be his
not-so-secret cabinet of New

Frontiersmen. At a drop of the
hat into the proverbial ring,
Teddy can be surrounded by a
stable of advisers, ex-cabinet
officials and speech writers.
Among them in '76 look for
Robert McNamara, Theodore
Sorenson, Sargent Shriver, John
Kenneth Galbraith (and most of
Harvard), Arthur Schlesinger,
George Ball (a likely choice for
Secretary of State in a Kennedy
cabinet), John Tunney and a
thousand others.
I say this group is an asset not
because of their wisdom or special
ability to govern — that is surely
debatable. Rather their worth
lies in their ability to put
Democratic pols and labor leaders
at ease. They are known and
trusted quantities to these men,
who were pushed out of the party
in '72 or scared out by their
nightmares of marijuana crazed
McGovernites in the White House.
The Kennedy people have the
connections to keep the Jackson
right in the party if and when
Teddy wins the nomination.
Keeping Wallace placated will, of
course, be their major task.
Establishment Credentials
At the same time Teddy's men
possess the Establishment
credentials to keep Big Business
and Big Money from freaking out
and launching a do-or-die fight
behind the Republican
standard-bearer. Wall Street will
certainly not go Democratic, but
they may come to view Teddy in
the same light as J.F.K. — an evil
with which they can live.
Kennedys have fought the WASP
Establishment throughout the
family history, and they are
experts on the beast.
Kennedy's other great
advantage is the family money,
estimated variously at 50, 100 or
200 million dollars. A public
financing bill will not effect this
unless it is unusually strict and
well drafted.
His drawbacks are legion.
Chappaquidick could be bad news
if properly managed by
Republican image-makers. None
of the Big Three — Rockefeller,
Reagan and Connally — would be
adverse to a Watergate backlash
strategy. The public in 1976 will
certainly not be adverse to a Mr.
Clean candidacy. Kennedy has
relied on the Nixon strategy of
sitting on the issue until people
get tired of discussing it.
Old Wounds
Whether a campaign would
reopen the old wounds is more
likely than not. Kennedy could
not "get ahead of it" by open
declarations of innocence without
making it a central issue. Nor
could he sit still while his
opponent made insidious
comparisons between bad drivers
and wiretappers. In the end
Chappaquidick would be painful
but not decisive if Kennedy
insisted on a strict discussion of
substantive issues — above all, the
economy.

A second weakness in a
Kennedy campaign is the recent
family history: rumors of drinking
and womanizing; his
"arrangement" with Joan to go
their separate ways every so often;
young Joe Kennedy's use of
drugs. If anything keeps Kennedy
out of the race to begin with, it
will be the loss of all privacy
coupled with the inevitable fear of
assassination.
If one postulates the 1970s as a
time of social retrenchment, then
Kennedy's weakest point may be
his politics. The whole idea of a
New Frontier II or a return to the
progressive 60s with its
concommitant violence and rapid
change may alienate millions of
voters. That the 200 th anniversary
is a perfect time for another "let's
get moving" campaign is a popular
notion in liberal circles. Yet, a
Reagan plea for retroversion or a
Connally-Rockefeller call for
benign neglect may sway the
nation in the final tallies.
As to the opposition, it seems
clear that Reagan, Rockefeller or
Connally will get the Republican
nod. While the Gallup poll showed
Charles Percy as being the only
G.O.P. candidate besting Kennedy

this was in large part a temporary
response to Percy's early criticism
of Nixon on Watergate. Percy,
Baker or Hatfield cannot in all
probability develop the voter
identification, grass-root support
in their party or money to win the
nomination.
The Party is still a combination
of Goldwater-Nixon conservatives
and Wall Street moderates with a
mere sprinkling of Ripon
liberalism.
Kennedy will stand the best
chance against Reagan with his
extremism or Connally with his
connections to the oil and gas
interests (if cars have no fuel in
1976, it is certain that oil men
will not top the Most Admired
list). Only Rockefeller could
establish a moderate, statesmen's
image that could conceivably
deny Kennedy the American
center. It's a good bet that
Rockefeller is the least likely of
the three to be nominated by a
convention certain to be
dominated by Goldwater-Nixon
Republicans. Hence, if Edward
Kennedy choose to run, I believe
he will win the Presidency.

Larry Sullivan

Heading everybody's list of
Democratic Presidential hopefuls
is the senior Senator from
Massachusetts, Edward M.
Kennedy. Also-rans like Muskie,
Humphrey and Jackson
acknowledge him to be the
front-runner. The dark horses like
Bayh and Mondale won't move till
his intentions are crystallized. The
Republicans assume he will be
their target, barring assassination
or his refusal to run.
It is not too early to ask the
questions that will determine if
Kennedy will sit in the White
House at the beginning of the
Republic's third century. Is he
qualified to be President? If so,
can he win?
As to the first question, it's
interesting to note how many
Democrats and Independents
restate it: aren't there others in
the Party more qualified, they
ask. While this is an interesting
problem, it may not be relevant in
the Democratic primaries.
Kennedy will have the
advantages of enormous grass-root
support, the love of most of the
old pols and the respect if not the
affection of labor. The polls show
him outdistancing everyone. In
the crucial Wisconsin and
California campaigns, the image of
the exile returning to claim his
kingdom after his brothers' death
will be of considerable importance
in determining the outcome.
Whether McGovern or Mondale
are the "best men" will be
forgotten in the wash.
Qualifications
At first glance Kennedy's
qualifications are a decidedly
mixed bag. On the one hand is his
well-publicized cheating incident
.at Harvard; his lackluster grades in
college and law school; his
enlistment in the Army which
necessitated his father's
intervention to reduce his term
from three to two years (Kennedy
;signed the papers without looking
or, others say, without caring); his
mediocre career as an Assistant
D.A. in Boston and the fact that
not until Chappaquidick did he
show informed, mature judgment,
tested in difficult conditions. It is
said that Kennedy had more
charm than his brothers, but far
less drive and intellect than
Robert, and less political savvy
than John. From all this many
have concluded that Teddy lacks
the ability to perform the duties
of President.
Kennedy has the potential to
be a great President. His
sensitivity to political movements
and his willingness to compromise
are underestimated. He is
educable to a far greater extent
than most of the ideologues who
crowd the scene. Most
importantly, he has grown in the
Senate as a man and as a politician
— far more than anyone expected
when he first took his seat.

behind the Republican
standard-bearer. Wall Street will
certainly not go Democratic, but
they may come to view Teddy in
the same light as J.F.K. — an evil
with which they can live.
Kennedys have fought the WASP
Establishment throughout the
family history, and they are
experts on the beast.
Kennedy's other great
advantage is the family money,
estimated variously at 50, 100 or
200 million dollars. A public
financing bill will not effect this
unless it is unusually strict and
well drafted.
His drawbacks are legion.
Chappaquidick could be bad news
if properly managed by
Republican image-makers. None
of the Big Three — Rockefeller,
Reagan and Connally — would be
adverse to a Watergate backlash
strategy. The public in 1976 will
certainly not be adverse to a Mr.
Clean candidacy. Kennedy has
relied on the Nixon strategy of
sitting on the issue until people
get tired of discussing it.
Old Wounds
Whether a campaign would
reopen the old wounds is more
likely than not. Kennedy could
not "get ahead of it" by open
declarations of innocence without
making it a central issue. Nor
could he sit still while his
opponent made insidious
comparisons between bad drivers
and wiretappers. In the end
Chappaquidick would be painful
but not decisive if Kennedy
insisted on a strict discussion of
substantive issues — above all, the
economy.

A second weakness in a
Kennedy campaign is the recent
family history: rumors of drinking
and womanizing; his
"arrangement" with Joan to go
their separate ways every so often;
young Joe Kennedy's use of
drugs. If anything keeps Kennedy
out of the race to begin with, it
will be the loss of all privacy
coupled with the inevitable fear of
assassination.
If one postulates the 1970s as a
time of social retrenchment, then
Kennedy's weakest point may be
his politics. The whole idea of a
New Frontier II or a return to the
progressive 60s with its
concommitant violence and rapid
change may alienate millions of
voters. That the 200 th anniversary
is a perfect time for another "let's
get moving" campaign is a popular
notion in liberal circles. Yet, a
Reagan plea for retroversion or a
Connally-Rockefeller call for
benign neglect may sway the
nation in the final tallies.
As to the opposition, it seems
clear that Reagan, Rockefeller or
Connally will get the Republican
nod. While the Gallup poll showed
Charles Percy as being the only
G.O.P. candidate besting Kennedy

this was in large part a temporary
response to Percy's early criticism
of Nixon on Watergate. Percy,
Baker or Hatfield cannot in all
probability develop the voter
identification, grass-root support
in their party or money to win the
nomination.
The Party is still a combination
of Goldwater-Nixon conservatives
and Wall Street moderates with a
mere sprinkling of Ripon
liberalism.
Kennedy will stand the best
chance against Reagan with his
extremism or Connally with his
connections to the oil and gas
interests (if cars have no fuel in
1976, it is certain that oil men
will not top the Most Admired
list). Only Rockefeller could
establish a moderate, statesmen's
image that could conceivably
deny Kennedy the American
center. It's a good bet that
Rockefeller is the least likely of
the three to be nominated by a
convention certain to be
dominated by Goldwater-Nixon
Republicans. Hence, if Edward
Kennedy choose to run, I believe
he will win the Presidency.

Larry Sullivan

Heading everybody's list of
Democratic Presidential hopefuls
is the senior Senator from
Massachusetts, Edward M.
Kennedy. Also-rans like Muskie,
Humphrey and Jackson
acknowledge him to be the
front-runner. The dark horses like
Bayh and Mondale won't move till
his intentions are crystallized. The
Republicans assume he will be
their target, barring assassination
or his refusal to run.
It is not too early to ask the
questions that will determine if
Kennedy will sit in the White
House at the beginning of the
Republic's third century. Is he
qualified to be President? If so,
can he win?
As to the first question, it's
interesting to note how many
Democrats and Independents
restate it: aren't there others in
the Party more qualified, they
ask. While this is an interesting
problem, it may not be relevant in
the Democratic primaries.
Kennedy will have the
advantages of enormous grass-root
support, the love of most of the
old pols and the respect if not the
affection of labor. The polls show
him outdistancing everyone. In
the crucial Wisconsin and
California campaigns, the image of
the exile returning to claim his
kingdom after his brothers' death
will be of considerable importance
in determining the outcome.
Whether McGovern or Mondale
are the "best men" will be
forgotten in the wash.
Qualifications
At first glance Kennedy's
qualifications are a decidedly
mixed bag. On the one hand is his
well-publicized cheating incident
.at Harvard; his lackluster grades in
college and law school; his
enlistment in the Army which
necessitated his father's
intervention to reduce his term
from three to two years (Kennedy
;signed the papers without looking
or, others say, without caring); his
mediocre career as an Assistant
D.A. in Boston and the fact that
not until Chappaquidick did he
show informed, mature judgment,
tested in difficult conditions. It is
said that Kennedy had more
charm than his brothers, but far
less drive and intellect than
Robert, and less political savvy
than John. From all this many
have concluded that Teddy lacks
the ability to perform the duties
of President.
Kennedy has the potential to
be a great President. His
sensitivity to political movements
and his willingness to compromise
are underestimated. He is
educable to a far greater extent
than most of the ideologues who
crowd the scene. Most
importantly, he has grown in the
Senate as a man and as a politician
— far more than anyone expected
when he first took his seat.
If Kennedy makes the run he
will have several assets, not the
least of which will be his
not-so-secret cabinet of New

Frontiersmen. At a drop of the
hat into the proverbial ring,
Teddy can be surrounded by a
stable of advisers, ex-cabinet
officials and speech writers.
Among them in '76 look for
Robert McNamara, Theodore
Sorenson, Sargent Shriver, John
Kenneth Galbraith (and most of
Harvard), Arthur Schlesinger,
George Ball (a likely choice for
Secretary of State in a Kennedy
cabinet), John Tunney and a
thousand others.
I say this group is an asset not
because of their wisdom or special
ability to govern — that is surely
debatable. Rather their worth
lies in their ability to put
Democratic pols and labor leaders
at ease. They are known and
trusted quantities to these men,
who were pushed out of the party
in '72 or scared out by their
nightmares of marijuana crazed
McGovernites in the White House.
The Kennedy people have the
connections to keep the Jackson
right in the party if and when
Teddy wins the nomination.
Keeping Wallace placated will, of
course, be their major task.
Establishment Credentials
At the same time Teddy's men
possess the Establishment
credentials to keep Big Business
and Big Money from freaking out
and launching a do-or-die fight
behind the Republican
standard-bearer. Wall Street will
certainly not go Democratic, but
they may come to view Teddy in
the same light as J.F.K. — an evil
with which they can live.

Establishment throughout the
