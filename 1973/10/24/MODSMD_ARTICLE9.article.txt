## Realism Vital In Relf Crisis

(This is the second half of a two-part series,
continued from yesterday.)
Senator Kennedy's hearing on July 10 on the
sterilization of the two minor Relf daughters bore
on a central issue in the suit brought on their
behalf: Did Mrs. Orelia Dixon's staff of the Family
Planning Clinic in Montgomery, Ala., deceive the
mother, Mrs. Relf, about what she signed or did she
knowingly consent to sterilizations? Very
convincing evidence that she did understand is the
form taken by the dismissal of the suit for $1
million — later $5 million after Attorney Melvin
Belli became involved.
The order issued on July 31 by U.S. District
Judge Robert Varner dismissed the suit "with
prejudice", a legal phrase that meant in this instance
that the Relfs cannot again bring suit against those
defendants covered by this phrase, including in this
case Mrs. Orelia Dixon and her superior, Joseph
Conklin, the Family Planning Clinic and the
Montgomery Community Action Agency that they
respectively directed and also the hospital where the
operations were performed. The fact that the Relfs'
lawyers joined in requesting this form of dismissal
implies that they knew they could not win their
case.
The implication that the Relf's lawyers knew
that they could not support their allegations against
Mrs. Dixon and her nurses becomes even stronger in
the light of the publicly expressed attack on Mrs.
Dixon's group made at the time the suit was filed by
the president of the organization that employed the
lawyers, the Southern Poverty Law Center. Then
the president of the Center, Georgia legislator Julian
Bond, stated: "Sterilization of the retarded had its
precedent in Nazi Germany...Actually, there are
earlier U.S. precedents. In 1927 Justice Oliver
Wendell Holmes in a Supreme Court opinion
supporting such sterilizations in Virginia wrote:
"Three generations of imbeciles are enough."
Knowledgable Consent
While in Alabama at the end of August, I
followed up a clue and found more evidence that
Mrs. Relf did knowingly consent to sterilization of
the girls by tubal ligation. My clue was that the day
after the suit was filed, Joseph Conklin had said that
a notary public "quizzed" the mother about her
awareness of what she had signed before he stamped
the document. Nothing more had been published
about this — indeed the dismissal of the suit had
been almost completely overlooked. The notary, I
discovered, had been Mr. Reginald Nessmith, then
Director of Administration for the Montgomery
Community Action Agency. He had been on
vacation when the news broke and had since been
forgotten by the press.
He told me how he notarized signatures, not in
the hospital as Mrs. Relf recalled, but in his office:
. .as a matter of my personal policy, I also
question the individuals rather than just simply
witness their signature. .. He went on to state
that he always asked the patient if the nurse had
explained to her what she was signing and, in the
presence of both, asked the nurse if she did, in fact,
explain and then notarized the signature only after
he was assured by both that this was the case.
When I questioned the nurse, Mrs. Ware, by

telephone, she verified this procedure. I also asked
her this:
"You explained to Mrs. Relf where the incisions
would be made on the abdomen and how the tubes
would be found and cut off so that permanent
sterilization would result? Is this an accurate
description?"
Mrs. Ware replied "Yes."
Mrs. Orelia Dixon was unwilling to make any
comments. All that I heard and read in the local
paper's files while in Alabama convinced me that
she and her family have been the ones most hurt by
humanism gone legally berserk in Montgomery. But
that is another story.
The publicity generated by the Relf case has
failed to illuminate the central problem. This
problem is lack of a scientifically acceptable
position on the relative importance of genes and
environment in influencing human behavior —
precisely the problem that for more than seven
years I have thrust at The National Academy of
Sciences, the organization created by Abraham
Lincoln to be the scientific intellectual conscience
of our nation. The Academy has side-stepped the
issue. "
Statement Submitted
The Relf hearing by Senator Kennedy as Senate
Health Subcommittee Chairman gave me an
opportunity — not to testify in person as I had
requested — but to submit a statement to him and
also to all committee members. My statement
included a research report entitled: "American
Lysenkoism in The National Academy of Sciences."
I also urged the Subcommittee to ask the Academy
to act on what I have unsuccessfully moved as a
resolution at the last four meetings: To evaluate my
research result that there is only one chance in
2,000 of being significantly wrong in asserting for
typical Caucasian populations that differences in
genes have four times more effect on IQ than do
environmental differences.
On 12 September, having received <no
acknowledgement from Senator Kennedy, I wrtfte
again stating strongly the critical views of tfiis
column about the Senator's 10 July hearing ahd
stressing the exoneration of the maligned
Montgomery Community Action Agency personnel.
I placed a phrase quoted yesterday into
contemporary context thus: The phrase "whole
wonderful variety of human beings" reveals
egalitarian dogmatism bent upon burying genetic
aspects of human-quality problems under a cover-up
that dwarfs Watergate both in scope and in
significance and matches Watergate in
self-justification of the cover-uppers. But my chief
point was to urge the Subcommittee to support my
resolution with the Academy.
If the Senate Health Subcommittee does ask The
National Academy of Sciences to evaluate the
relative importance of genes versus environment on
the important behavioral trait of IQ, it may, at long
last, succeed in correcting the failure that Newsweek
in 1971 described thus: "The Academy, in sh<*t,
has failed to confront a hypothesis, which, howefer
tenuous, will go on ticking away, a potential social
hydrogen bomb, until it is finally disposed of." *
