# Israelis Claim Suez Advantage; Egypt Asks Peace-Keeping Force
## 
### Associated Press 
Israel reported yesterday that its
forces had a stranglehold on a big
Egyptian army along the Suez Canal in
the third day of an elusive cease-fire
and the 19th day of the latest Middle
East war between Jews and Arabs.
Egypt said the United States and
the Soviet Union should send troops
to enforce the truce along the war-torn
canal.
Cairo radio said President Anwar
Sadat of Egypt appealed to President
Nixon and to Soviet Communist leader
Leonid I. Brezhnev to dispatch
American and Russian troops to help
secure the already marred cease-fire
along the Suez front.
In another development, a State

Department spokesman said the
United States has suggested to Moscow
a joint reduction by the two
superpowers in Middle East emergency
arms shipments.
In Washington, a White House
spokesman said no request for U.S.
troops had been received from Sadat.
No U.S. Troops
"The United States has no
intention of sending troops to the
Middle East and we hope no other
outside parties will send troops to the
Middle Eastthe spokesman said.
Both Israel and Egypt reported
heavy fighting in the skies and on the
ground along the southern sector of
the Suez yesterday.
The Israeli command said the guns

fell silent last night. The Cairo
command's communiques after
nightfall told only of continued
fighting.
Egypt's plea for U.S.-Soviet
military assistance in assuring a
cease-fire along the canal zone came
last night at an emergency session of
the U.N. Security Council.
'Egypt Justified'
The Soviet Union said at the
meeting that Egypt was justified under
the U.N. charter in asking for such
help, but it said nothing as to whether
it would send the requested troops.
The idea got a chilly reception from
the United States, which said such big
power intervention at this time would
not be helpful.
Eight nonaligned countries called
yesterday for the creation of a U.N.
military force to enforce the cease-fire
between Israel and Egypt.
The eight submitted the proposal to
the Security Council after Egypt
charged Israel had launched a new war
on the Suez front and asked for joint
U.S.-Soviet military supervision of the
truce.
On the battlefields, Israel said calm
prevailed last night on all fronts after a
day of fighting on the Suez Canal
front's southern sector. The Syrian
front was reported quiet all day after
acceptance by Damascus of the first
U.N. truce appeal.

The Israeli command claimed
yesterday that its armor had
completed a pincer movement that
trapped Egypt's 3rd Army in a
southern pocket of the Sinai front.
Ensuing aerial combat left 15 Egyptian
planes downed, the command said.
A Cairo command communique
issued last night said: "Our forces are
fighting enemy forces west of the Suez
Canal. The enemy suffered serious
losses. Our resistance is ferocious and
we are counterattacking boldly."
The Egyptians claimed eight kills in
the dogfights, and the command said
the 3rd Army's pontoon bridges across
the canal were intact.
Unclear Report
The communique, broadcast by
Cairo radio, did not make it clear if
the battle report was prepared during
the day and broadcast after nightfall,
leaving open the possibility that the
fighting eventually stopped.
Israel's defense minister, Moshe
Dayan, said in a Tel Aviv radio
broadcast that Israel had won the war.
He said he considered the chance of
peace talks much better now than
after the 1967 conflict.
In Cairo, a U.N. spokesman said
truce team representatives sent to the
front to try and ensure that a
cease-fire was kept were having
difficulty telling where the cease-fire
lines were supposed to be in the
central and southern Suez sectors.
