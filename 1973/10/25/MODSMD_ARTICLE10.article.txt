# Insomnia Woes
## Roommate Misery 
### 
Doug Witkin*

More than a month has
transpired since the freshman class
bombarded the Stanford
Community. In retrospect, Joe
Frosh can ponder all of his
pre-conceptions of the "farm"
and evaluate their accuracy. His
thoughts before entering usually
varied between the ever popular:
"What if my roommate's a
goon?", "Gee, I hope the people
are friendly" and "You know,
when I think of going to college,
all I think about are the parties
and stuff; I never think about
studying."
Another item which seldom
pops up in the pre-university
student's head is whether, in fact,
he will be able to sleep in his new
surroundings. This brings us to
this writer's first traumatic
experience at school and the
beginning of his subsequent
neuroses.
One cannot fully appreciate all
the glories of insomnia until one
has had the opportunity to share
rooms with an incurable snorer.
Lars the Rommate was a good guy
during the day. We got along fine,
and everything was hunky-dory
until 10 p.m.
A Big Surprise
The first night, I went to bed
expecting nothing. All of a
sudden, a fog horn shattered the
peaceful silence of the room. My
first thoughts were to wait; surely
the cacophony would go away.
Instead, the volume grew steadily
and before long, 1000 megaton
bombs were exploding in my
eardrums. At this point, near the
brink of suicide — or murder — I
couldn't decide which — I
tactfully decided to employ a
little psychological reasoning.
"Shut up. you +$%/!!" I
exclaimed. He awoke totally
oblivious to my suffering and
simply rolled over. Silence at last.
As I figured it, however, I had
only five minutes to fall asleep
before the next onslaught of
discord penetrated Room 19.
Needless to say, the feat was not
accomplished, and the remainder
of the night was spent wishing I
was on the roof.
The very next day, Lars was
inspired to rearrange our beds into
bunks. Having had no sleep, I was
hardly in the mental state to
contest this decision and so I
vaguely nodded my head in
approval. This was a mistake.
Lars, as fate would have it, is
quite a big guy — somewhere in
the neighborhood of 6'4" and 240
pounds. For some strange reason,
we decided that he should take
the top bunk.
The next night, the snoring was

inconsequential to the
a valance-type sounds emanating
from the bed above.
Unfortunately, the poles used to
secure the upper bed to the lower
bed were considerably less than
sturdy, and the slightest motion
was immediately amplified to
ten-thousand times its original
decibel reading. Thus, whenever
Lars turned over, the bed shook,
the poles rattled and the springs
went wild. This was enough to
wake one up from a sound sleep
screaming, "Wha? Wha? Wha?!!!"
The following day found me in
Cowell Student Health Center
which, incidentally, deserves an
entire article itself. Lying on the
reception desk were forms which
asked, in addition to name, rank
and room number, the "nature of
the problem." There were a
number of blanks to check off
Finding none that aptly suited my
situation, I entered my own
category at the bottom and
handed it to the girl on duty.
Possibly Forgotten
One and a half hours later, and
still sitting in the front waiting
room, I approached the young
lady whose job it was to call
patients into their respective
examination rooms. "Miss," I
began, "Do you think you might
have made a mistake? I mean the
last ten people to be called came
in after me."
Ten minutes later, I was
admitted into the good doctor's
office. He looked very capable
and I was ecstatic to think that
someone would finally help me.
"So you have 'INSOMNIA,'
Douglas?" He questioned, reading
from my form.
I proceeded to explain all the
agonizing details of my trip into
the land of the walking dead. We
both agreed that sleeping pills
were definitely not the answer
and that I would have to change
roommates if there was to be any
hope for my academic success at
school. I shook his hand; he
handed me a prescription for 2
(two) Seconal capsules and sent
me on my way.
Luckily, the seconals worked,
and the next two nights were
spent gloriously dreaming away —
in spite of the fact that I felt like
a zombie during the day. On
Wednesday, I moved out with no
hard feelings and took up
residence in Room 1, where ever
since I have managed to stay clear
of megaton bombs and
avalanches.

the top bunk.
The next night, the snoring was

inconsequential to the
a valance-type sounds emanating
from the bed above.
Unfortunately, the poles used to
secure the upper bed to the lower
bed were considerably less than
sturdy, and the slightest motion
was immediately amplified to
ten-thousand times its original
decibel reading. Thus, whenever
Lars turned over, the bed shook,
the poles rattled and the springs
went wild. This was enough to
wake one up from a sound sleep
screaming, "Wha? Wha? Wha?!!!"
The following day found me in
Cowell Student Health Center
which, incidentally, deserves an
entire article itself. Lying on the
reception desk were forms which
asked, in addition to name, rank
and room number, the "nature of
the problem." There were a
number of blanks to check off
Finding none that aptly suited my
situation, I entered my own
category at the bottom and
handed it to the girl on duty.
Possibly Forgotten
One and a half hours later, and
still sitting in the front waiting
room, I approached the young
lady whose job it was to call
patients into their respective
examination rooms. "Miss," I
began, "Do you think you might
have made a mistake? I mean the
last ten people to be called came
in after me."
Ten minutes later, I was
admitted into the good doctor's
office. He looked very capable
and I was ecstatic to think that
someone would finally help me.
"So you have 'INSOMNIA,'
Douglas?" He questioned, reading
from my form.
I proceeded to explain all the
agonizing details of my trip into
the land of the walking dead. We
both agreed that sleeping pills
were definitely not the answer
and that I would have to change
roommates if there was to be any
hope for my academic success at
school. I shook his hand; he
handed me a prescription for 2
(two) Seconal capsules and sent
me on my way.
Luckily, the seconals worked,
and the next two nights were
spent gloriously dreaming away —
in spite of the fact that I felt like
a zombie during the day. On
Wednesday, I moved out with no
hard feelings and took up
residence in Room 1, where ever
since I have managed to stay clear
of megaton bombs and
avalanches.

More than a month has
transpired since the freshman class
bombarded the Stanford
Community. In retrospect, Joe
Frosh can ponder all of his
pre-conceptions of the "farm"
and evaluate their accuracy. His
thoughts before entering usually
varied between the ever popular:
"What if my roommate's a
goon?", "Gee, I hope the people
are friendly" and "You know,
when I think of going to college,
all I think about are the parties
and stuff; I never think about
studying."
Another item which seldom
pops up in the pre-university
student's head is whether, in fact,
he will be able to sleep in his new
surroundings. This brings us to
this writer's first traumatic
experience at school and the
beginning of his subsequent
neuroses.
One cannot fully appreciate all
the glories of insomnia until one
has had the opportunity to share
rooms with an incurable snorer.
Lars the Rommate was a good guy
during the day. We got along fine,
and everything was hunky-dory
until 10 p.m.
A Big Surprise
The first night, I went to bed
expecting nothing. All of a
sudden, a fog horn shattered the
peaceful silence of the room. My
first thoughts were to wait; surely
the cacophony would go away.
Instead, the volume grew steadily
and before long, 1000 megaton
bombs were exploding in my
eardrums. At this point, near the
brink of suicide — or murder — I
couldn't decide which — I
tactfully decided to employ a
little psychological reasoning.
"Shut up. you +$%/!!" I
exclaimed. He awoke totally
oblivious to my suffering and
simply rolled over. Silence at last.
As I figured it, however, I had
only five minutes to fall asleep
before the next onslaught of
discord penetrated Room 19.
Needless to say, the feat was not
accomplished, and the remainder
of the night was spent wishing I
was on the roof.
The very next day, Lars was
inspired to rearrange our beds into
bunks. Having had no sleep, I was
hardly in the mental state to
contest this decision and so I
vaguely nodded my head in
approval. This was a mistake.
Lars, as fate would have it, is
quite a big guy — somewhere in
the neighborhood of 6'4" and 240
pounds. For some strange reason,
we decided that he should take
the top bunk.

transpired since the freshman class
bombarded the Stanford
Community. In retrospect, Joe
Frosh can ponder all of his
pre-conceptions of the "farm"
and evaluate their accuracy. His
thoughts before entering usually
varied between the ever popular:
"What if my roommate's a
goon?", "Gee, I hope the people
are friendly" and "You know,
when I think of going to college,
all I think about are the parties
and stuff; I never think about
studying."
Another item which seldom
pops up in the pre-university
student's head is whether, in fact,
he will be able to sleep in his new
surroundings. This brings us to
this writer's first traumatic
experience at school and the
beginning of his subsequent
neuroses.
One cannot fully appreciate all
the glories of insomnia until one
has had the opportunity to share
rooms with an incurable snorer.
Lars the Rommate was a good guy
during the day. We got along fine,
and everything was hunky-dory
until 10 p.m.
A Big Surprise
The first night, I went to bed
expecting nothing. All of a
sudden, a fog horn shattered the
peaceful silence of the room. My
first thoughts were to wait; surely
the cacophony would go away.
Instead, the volume grew steadily
and before long, 1000 megaton
bombs were exploding in my
eardrums. At this point, near the
brink of suicide — or murder — I
couldn't decide which — I
tactfully decided to employ a
little psychological reasoning.
"Shut up. you +$%/!!" I
exclaimed. He awoke totally
oblivious to my suffering and
simply rolled over. Silence at last.
As I figured it, however, I had
only five minutes to fall asleep
before the next onslaught of
discord penetrated Room 19.
Needless to say, the feat was not
accomplished, and the remainder
of the night was spent wishing I
was on the roof.
The very next day, Lars was
inspired to rearrange our beds into
bunks. Having had no sleep, I was
hardly in the mental state to
contest this decision and so I
vaguely nodded my head in
approval. This was a mistake.
Lars, as fate would have it, is
quite a big guy — somewhere in
the neighborhood of 6'4" and 240
pounds. For some strange reason,
we decided that he should take
the top bunk.
The next night, the snoring was

inconsequential to the
a valance-type sounds emanating
from the bed above.
Unfortunately, the poles used to
secure the upper bed to the lower
bed were considerably less than
sturdy, and the slightest motion
was immediately amplified to
ten-thousand times its original
decibel reading. Thus, whenever
Lars turned over, the bed shook,
the poles rattled and the springs
went wild. This was enough to
wake one up from a sound sleep
screaming, "Wha? Wha? Wha?!!!"
The following day found me in
Cowell Student Health Center
which, incidentally, deserves an
entire article itself. Lying on the
reception desk were forms which
asked, in addition to name, rank
and room number, the "nature of
the problem." There were a
number of blanks to check off
Finding none that aptly suited my
situation, I entered my own
category at the bottom and
handed it to the girl on duty.
Possibly Forgotten
One and a half hours later, and
still sitting in the front waiting
room, I approached the young
lady whose job it was to call
patients into their respective
examination rooms. "Miss," I
began, "Do you think you might
have made a mistake? I mean the
last ten people to be called came
in after me."
Ten minutes later, I was
admitted into the good doctor's
office. He looked very capable
and I was ecstatic to think that
someone would finally help me.
"So you have 'INSOMNIA,'
Douglas?" He questioned, reading
from my form.
I proceeded to explain all the
agonizing details of my trip into
the land of the walking dead. We
both agreed that sleeping pills
were definitely not the answer
and that I would have to change
roommates if there was to be any
hope for my academic success at
school. I shook his hand; he
handed me a prescription for 2
(two) Seconal capsules and sent
me on my way.
Luckily, the seconals worked,
and the next two nights were
spent gloriously dreaming away —
in spite of the fact that I felt like
a zombie during the day. On
Wednesday, I moved out with no
hard feelings and took up
residence in Room 1, where ever
since I have managed to stay clear
of megaton bombs and
avalanches.
