Proposition One
Editor:
While Proposition One would
purport to reduce taxes by a
constitutional limit of state
expenditures, there has been Mttle
discussion in the media of how
this expenditure limit would
actually be calculated. The
proposition is built around a
complicated formula, the key
element of which is an annual
projection of total California state
personal income. It is very
important to understand how this
crucial projection would be made.
The proposition would
establish a three-man Economic
Estimates Commission composed
of the State Controller, an

appointee of the Governor, and ar
appointee of the Legislature (who
is not himself a legislator). This
Commission must arrive at an
estimate of state personal income
by April 1 of each year, although
only a few months of statistics
would be available on which to
base the projection. There is no
provision in the proposition for
later adjustments to correct major
errors in this projection.
In effect, the proposition
would vest enormous
para-legislative power in a
Commission, two-thirds of whose
members are not elected and not
answerable to the public. This
Commission would effectively
take over the power to set budget
ceilings from the elected

Legislature (and Governor),
without the checks and balances
of our representative system of
government. The Estimates
Commission, together with the
rather grandiose economic
experiment it would oversee,
represents nothing more than a
wild gamble, though supporters of
Proposition One profess to see it
as a form of "fiscal
responsibility." Vote NO on
Proposition One.

The most important thing for

you to do immediately is to
communicate with your
Congressman — by letter, by
telegram, by telephone. The only
way to impeach Richard Nixon is
by a vote of 218 members of the
House of Representatives, and a
flood of mail is by far the most
effective way to demonstrate to
these men that the American
public demands Nixon's removal
from office.
1. Write, wire or call your
hometown Congressman. Use
your home address. (Call the
Chapel at ext. 2563 to find your
Congressman's name.)
His Address:
Hon.
House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515
His telephone: (202) 224-3121
Western Union's number:
323-9421 or (800) 648-5445
2. Write or call your parents,
friends, and relatives — get them
to communicate with their
Congressman.
3. Write additional letters to
the following key members of the
House:
Hon. Carl Albert
Speaker
House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515
Hon. Peter Rodino
Chairman
Committee on the Judiciary
Washington, D.C. 20515
The Congress wants to be rid
of Richard Nixon almost as
as you do, but they won't have
the courage for impeachment
without continuous public
pressure. Tell them you believe
the President has committed
"high crimes and misdemeanors"
which make his impeachment
imperative. KEEP THOSE
CARDS AND LETTERS
COMING — every day!

Editor:
The most important thing for

you to do immediately is to
communicate with your
Congressman — by letter, by
telegram, by telephone. The only
way to impeach Richard Nixon is
by a vote of 218 members of the
House of Representatives, and a
flood of mail is by far the most
effective way to demonstrate to
these men that the American
public demands Nixon's removal
from office.
1. Write, wire or call your
hometown Congressman. Use
your home address. (Call the
Chapel at ext. 2563 to find your
Congressman's name.)
His Address:
Hon.
House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515
His telephone: (202) 224-3121
Western Union's number:
323-9421 or (800) 648-5445
2. Write or call your parents,
friends, and relatives — get them
to communicate with their
Congressman.
3. Write additional letters to
the following key members of the
House:
Hon. Carl Albert
Speaker
House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515
Hon. Peter Rodino
Chairman
Committee on the Judiciary
Washington, D.C. 20515
The Congress wants to be rid
of Richard Nixon almost as
as you do, but they won't have
the courage for impeachment
without continuous public
pressure. Tell them you believe
the President has committed
"high crimes and misdemeanors"
which make his impeachment
imperative. KEEP THOSE
CARDS AND LETTERS
COMING — every day!

Proposition One
Editor:
While Proposition One would
purport to reduce taxes by a
constitutional limit of state
expenditures, there has been Mttle
discussion in the media of how
this expenditure limit would
actually be calculated. The
proposition is built around a
complicated formula, the key
element of which is an annual
projection of total California state
personal income. It is very
important to understand how this
crucial projection would be made.
The proposition would
establish a three-man Economic
Estimates Commission composed
of the State Controller, an

appointee of the Governor, and ar
appointee of the Legislature (who
is not himself a legislator). This
Commission must arrive at an
estimate of state personal income
by April 1 of each year, although
only a few months of statistics
would be available on which to
base the projection. There is no
provision in the proposition for
later adjustments to correct major
errors in this projection.
In effect, the proposition
would vest enormous
para-legislative power in a
Commission, two-thirds of whose
members are not elected and not
answerable to the public. This
Commission would effectively
take over the power to set budget
ceilings from the elected

Legislature (and Governor),
without the checks and balances
of our representative system of
government. The Estimates
Commission, together with the
rather grandiose economic
experiment it would oversee,
represents nothing more than a
wild gamble, though supporters of
Proposition One profess to see it
as a form of "fiscal
responsibility." Vote NO on
Proposition One.
