# Newest Zappa Disc One Of His Finest
## 
### JEFF EHRLICH 
"Rock V roll's ugly
reminder," Frank Zappa is back
again for the 16th time on record
— the 11th under the name "The
Mothers" (formerly "of
Invention") — and are we glad he
is. Over-nite Sensation is not only
one of the best albums to emerge
in this musically dry year, but it
happens to be the nicest Zappa
material since his "200 Motels"
phase of two years ago, recorded
on the 200 Motels soundtrack and
The Mothers' live Fillmore East,
June 1971.
Admittedly, Over-nite isn't
quite as incredible as Frank's
earlier masterpieces Absolutely
Free, We're Only In It For The
Money, Uncle Meat and the
Fillmore East album. But I
seriously doubt that Frank — or
anyone — will ever be THAT
incredible again, judging from the
way most major rock artists
managed to use up their best ideas
almost immediately.
Well, it happens that Frank's
next best ideas are a lot better
than THE best ideas of most
everyone else in rock 'n' roll. So
are his wise use of good
instrumental dexterity and his
exquisite production skills. The
new album is expertly produced.
The playing is very sharp. Plus, for
the first time, Frank handles
nearly all the lead vocals, and he's
a lot of fun to listen to.
Sneaky Poet
As for "concept," Frank is
once again the sneaky poet of
current American culture,
dragging out the bad-ass things on
everyone's mind and making them
embarassingly obvious, just like he
did on the first few Mothers of
Invention albums. Over-nite has
one song about raunchy brainless
rock singers, one superb piece on
government-and-TV, one that
might be a "soul power" take-off,
one about a capitalistic
retirement, and three songs on —

you guessed it — sex.
The basic musical format is
Frank's good oF deliberately
imitation-rock, though updated
somewhat from the old Mothers'
music. Still complete with
speed-altered voices and those
pleasing synthesizer riffs. The
songs are augmented by Frank's
more experimental music, the
jazzo-rock improvisational stuff
found on the Hot Rats album and
on his last two, Wake Jawaka and
Grand Wazoo. This latter type of
Zappa music is hard to really
enjoy, unless you're a jazz-improv
"buff" or a totally devoted Zappa
fanatic.
But using it in combination
with the rockish-stuff-plus-lyrics
for Over-nite turned out to be
very smart. This way the
"experimental" portions can be
appreciated by all; they don't
become grating.
You really notice Jean-Luc
Ponty's violin solo and George
Duke's keyboard (Calliope?) solo
on "Fifty-fifty." And the
vocal-ch or us-used-as-instrument
on "Montana." And Frank's
excellent wah-wah lead guitar
throughout the album — as
always, some of the best lead
guitar in history.
Harsh Vocals
The harsh vocals by the
anonymous "Ricky Lancelotti"
on "Fifty-fifty" and "Zomby
Woof" are a bit hard to take, but
they don't pull down the album
on the whole. "Camarillo Brillo"
is a good gradual album opener,
and "Montana" is a very
interesting closer. "Fm the
Slime," "Dirty Love" and "Dinah
Moe Humm" are simply fantastic.
Tell you what: listen to the
copy of Over-nite Sensation that
your local Zappa freak has no
doubt already bought. Listen
twice if you have the time. You
just might want to get a copy of
your own.
