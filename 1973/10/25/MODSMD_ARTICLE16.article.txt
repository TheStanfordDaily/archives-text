# Strindberg Show Marred By Gray
## 
### DAVE MOYER 
The conception of Oakland's
Company Theatre is bright and
exciting in theory, but its
production of August Strindberg's
The Father is touched with
grayness, literally and figuratively.
The primary strength of The
Company (not to be confused
with Stanford's of the same name)
is its choice of scripts.
This year's offerings include:
Williams' Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,
Aristophanes' The Frogs, Ibsen's
When We Dead Awaken, Macbeth,
and Gorky's The Lower Depths,
as profound and challenging a list
as one can find in all repertory
(although The Company's
redundance on the tragic and the
sombre parallels The American
Conservatory Theatre's emphasis
on a heavily comedic season in
choice of repertoire).
Strindberg's The Father,
playing through November 3rd, is
a landmark of importance in the
history of realism in the theatre.
The play, written in 1887, is
bluntly autobiographical,
revealing the playwright's violent
antipathy to the feminist
campaign.
It is often considered to be
Strindberg's answer to Ibsen's A
Doll's House-, while writing the
play August complained of Ibsen's
"scandalous attacks on the male
sex." The Father's timely theme is
the struggle for power between
the sexes, offering such
revelations as "Love between man
and woman is war."
The Protagonist
The protagonist, the
representation of Strindberg
himself, is impelled to madness by
his wife, who sows the seeds of
doubt in his mind as to the
paternity of their daughter. Man is
viewed to be the more refined and
civilized of the sexes and
therefore also the weaker —
woman, the more primitive,
willing to use any means
necessary, and therefore the more
dominant.
There are also strains of Freud
— the hero can only love his wife
in her role as mother figure. For
today's audience, however, the
didacticism of this profound male
chauvinist pig is less important
than the compelling character
studies and the historical value
that recommend the text.
The historical importance of
the script was not enough to carry
the production, however. The
performance exuded an

impression of enveloping
colorlessness. The stage area was
backdropped in black curtains,
the flimsy walls of the set were a
dingy white, and the furnishings
were gray. The costumes also were
entirely grays and blacks.
Oppressive Environment
All this was to emphasize the
oppressive environment that
surrounded the characters and it
worked quite well to that end,
although complaint must be
found with the amateurish
makeup job that continued the
not-so-subtle theme by streaking
everyone's hair gray and painting
obvious gray lines on faces and
hand indiscriminately.
The primary objection lies in
the fact that the quality of the
overall acting also inhabited an
uneasy area of grayness somewhat
above stark amateurism and below
professional competence.
There were compelling
moments, particularly by the
producing director of The
Company, Jerry Roth, who
played the protagonist captain.
The final mad scene imaginatively
captured the brilliantdialoguethat
is Strindberg's forte. But there
were simply too many dull
moments and poor supporting
actors to maintain interest overall.
Cliched Characterizations
The cliched characterizations
prompted unabashed yawns.
Laura, the captain's wife, is one of
the better women's roles in the
repertoire, but the actress,
embarrassingly a Stanford M.F.A.
grad, played the entire evening on
one note. The lack of inspiration
and/or talent in the lesser roles
was painfully evident.
All in all it is this native
Oaklander's painful duty to admit
that not even the bohemian
romanticism of viewing a play in
the converted fellowship hall of
an inner city church could
compensate for the boredom that
ensued. The Father is an
important work, but unless you
are looking for an artsy-craftsy,
intellectual prelude to a late-night
session in those fantastic Berkeley
coffee-houses, or unless gray is
your favorite color, go to A.C.T.
instead.
