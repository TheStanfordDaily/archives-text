# Preservation Hall Jazz Band Returns
## 
### 
Pictured above are pianist Billie
Pierce and trumpeter DeDe Pierce
of the famed New Orleans
Preservation Hall Jazz Band,
which played to sellout audiences
at Stanford last summer and
returns to play one night only —
tomorrow night, Oct. 26, at 8
p.m. in Memorial Auditorium.
The group will make its 58th
campus appearance and "for the
first time, students will get the
opportunity to stamp their feet,
clap their hands and tap their toes
as local audiences have been
doing," says Tom Bacchetti,
director of the Office of Public
Events.
Retirement age seems to mean
nothing to the men from
Preservation Hall. The youngest
member of the Band was born in

1907 but that doesn't stop them
from presenting a clear melody,
strong beat and good old vivacious
enthusiasm.
The repertoire usually includes
old jazz standards, old pop tunes
and old hyms.
Tickets for this performance
are $4 general, $2 for students.
Bacchetti expects another sell-out
this time around and urges
everyone to buy tickets "as soon
as possible, before they're gone."
