# Alvin Ailey, Another View
## Dancers Miss Mark 
### SHERIDAN CRAWFORD 
Dance naturally defies
description through the written
word and the Alvin Ailey City
Center Dance Theater, performing
at Stanford this past week, is no
exception. The language of dance
— the gesture, the leap, the turn
of the head, the flow of
movement across time and space
— can, at once, be understood;
connections are made and the
dance speaks for itself, bypassing
verbal translation.
Somehow, during last
Thursday night's performance, the
Ailey group failed to make all of
those vital connections, leaving
behind a residue of unresolved
feelings, and even irritation. The
fact that this performance missed
the mark for many can be
attributed to an unlikely
juxtaposition of dance pieces, and
the accompanying dissonance of
the music of Ralph Vaughan
Williams, Donny Hathaway, and
Carl Orff.
Frist Dance
The first dance of the evening,
"The Lark Ascending," played on
the sweet sustained note of a
single violin, began with a single
male dancer, Clive Thompson,
behind a gauze curtain. Other
dancers joined him with added
orchestration in the music of
Ralph Vaughan Williams
miniature violin concerto.
The dancing was as lyrical and
classical as the music and although
predictable in form, it
nevertheless created a poignancy
which permeated the entire piece,
even after the gauze curtain had
lifted. Sara Yarborough was
outstanding, swirling in yellow
and rainbows, and the technical
proficiency of the company was
well established.
Whether or not the proof of
classical ballet ability, commonly
occupying the first slot in the
program of mamy dance
companies, need be demonstrated
by a company of Ailey's caliber is
a question posed time and again.

Undoubtedly, they are better
suited to another, more modern
medium — a sense that was
conveyed implicitly through their
manner of dance.
Tone Changed
The next production, "Love
Songs," a medley sung by Donny
Hathaway ("A Song for You" and
"He Ain't Heavy") and Nina
Simone ("Poppies"), featured
Dudley Thompson in a solo
performance. He completely
changed the tone of the evening as
he responded with a variety of
strong modern movements. He
was glistening after the first song,
extending himself into space and
reaching for the farthest corners
of the stage.
Mr. Thompson exhibited a full
mature interpretation of the
music, even though the song lyrics
set up blocks with their meaning,
and imprisoning him at times
within a phrase. His dancing then
became an attempt to break free
of the words, and he was
sporadically successful, although
in the end, the deliberate beat
seemed to conquer him.
Perhaps it was the excessive
length of the dance; next time,
delete Nina Simone. The "ex post
facto" method of dance, of letting
the music dictate the movement,
is something Dudley Thompson
deserves to be freed from in the
future.
Massive Composition
"Carmina Burana" was the
final fifty minute massive
composition of the night,
choreographed by John Butler to
the music of Carl Orff's Cantiones
profanae. Sung by a booming
choral ensemble in Latin, the
developing theme of both the
dance and the music soon proved
incomprehensible.
The first (and last) figures to
appear on the stage, dressed in
immense black tents, were
presumably members of a
religious order who proceeded to
disrobe.
The intervening dance was

evidently a lustful outpouring of
libidinal energies. The dancing was
generally sloppy; it was obvious
that "Carmina Burana" is a very
recent addition to the company's
repertoire and in need of practice.
Upon talking to a few of the
dancers following this
performance, it became clear that
not many of them understood the
drama or the overtly symbolic
color scheme (costumes in black,
bare, yellow, white, and scarlet)
or the middle action after the
disrobing. (They had learned it by
watching a film.)
The performance w?s
incredibly ambitious, considering
how vague the collective
conception was, and it was
remarkable if the audience could
have caught hold of any strain of
development at all.
