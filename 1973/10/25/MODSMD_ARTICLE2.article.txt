# Trounces Two Other Candidates
## Berk Captures USE Presidency 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
United Stanford Employees (USE)
members last night elected Jim Berk
president of the union for the next
year. Berk takes office immediately.
Berk, a former USE president and
husband of outgoing president Glenda
Jones, garnered 282 votes, to 111 for
Keith Doty and 92 for Dennis Davie,
his opponents.
USE, affiliated with the Service
Employees International Union
(SEIU) of the AFL-CIO, represents
some 1550 University technical,
maintenance and service employees.
However, those persons currently are
not required to become members of
the union.
In other elections, L.A.
Breckinridge was elected assistant
president, polling 312 votes to Keith
Stothers' 126. In the only close
election, Bob Woolston edged Tony
Sanchez for secretary, 239 votes to
231.
Karl Schroeder won the election for
treasurer with 356 votes to 109 for

Carlo Hilton, and Florrie Berger
topped Art Blevins for reporter, 345
to 126.
Smooth Election
After the election, Berk said "the
election went smoothly, quietly. A lot
of people were concerned that the
election would be disunifying, but I
hope and think it hasn't."
While stressing unity, Berk also told
the members of two goals he will
attempt to fulfill as president.
"Our top priority is to negotiate a
contract," for the workers in the
group. "But we also want to branch
out and organize the next piece of the
University — it remains to be seen
where that is," Berk said.
Co-Op Health Plan
In other business at the meeting at
Tresidder Union, attended by about
75 persons, Medicine Prof. Halsted
Hoi man spoke on the merits of
establishing a co-operative health care
plan for Stanford employees in
conjunction with Stanford Hospital.
Holman said this plan might be

more effective in serving the needs of
workers than plans such as Blue Cross
and Kaiser. However, the co-operative
plan which he suggested still must be
formulated, approved, and set up — a
process which could take several years.
In other business, Berk, a member
of the contract demands committee,
announced that USE will try to
hammer out a contract to present to
the University at a meeting of contract
representatives Nov. 1.
"We hope to get the contract
worked out at that meeting so we can
go to the University with our demands
the next Monday [Nov. 5]," Berk
said.
USE also elected group
representatives to the union's
executive committee last night.
Elected were Betty Tucker (group
one), Joan Dible (two), Roland
Finston (three), Kay Callans (five),
Mike Harris (six), Herbert Little
(seven), William Reynolds (eight),
Claus Hubner (nine), Dick Stovel (10),
Linda Crouse and Ann Wechsler (11),

Charles McManus (12), Mack Dillard
(14), and Dan Ibrisimovic and Joe
Sodja (15).
Ties occurred in groups four and
13, and runoff elections will be held in
the near future. Ben Castillo and Steve
Papier tied in group four, and David
Soule and Clyde Kennedy deadlocked
in group 13.
