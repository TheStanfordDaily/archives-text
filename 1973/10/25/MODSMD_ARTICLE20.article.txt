Senate Panel To Probe Cox Firing
WASHINGTON — The Senate Judiciary Committee
agreed yesterday to launch a public investigation into the
ousting of special prosecutor Archibald Cox, with Cox the
leadoff witness next Monday.
Meanwhile, sources disclosed that Senate Republican
leaders protested to the White House President Nixon's
handling of the Watergate tape controversy.
In a phone call to a Nixon aide, the GOP leaders also
called on Nixon to name a new special prosecutor and to
pledge that Watergate and related investigations be pressed
vigorously.
Sources said Senate Republican Leader Hugh Scott
expressed resentment that Nixon had not consulted the
leadership about his moves.
House Republicans were invited to a White House
meeting today, described as a briefing on "the President's
action regarding the tapes and other events of recent
days."
In the Senate Judiciary Committee, strong support was
reported for legislation providing for an independent

special prosecutor, but there was also pressure to reinstate
Cox.
Nixon Vetoes War Powers Bill
WASHINGTON — President Nixon vetoed the war
powers resolution yesterday, saying it was
unconstitutional and "would seriously undermine this
nation's ability to act decisively and convincingly in times
of international crisis."
The measure would have barred the president from
committing U.S. forces to combat for more than 60 days
without specific approval from Congress.
Exercising his ninth veto of the year, Nixon said he
would "welcome the establishment of a nonpartisan
commission on the constitutional roles of the Congress
and the president in the conduct of foreign affairs."
He labeled as constructive a proviso of the vetoed
legislation that calls for consultation with Congress before
and during the involvement of U.S. forces in hostilities
abroad.
Nixon objected, however, that the measure "would
purport to take away, by a mere legislative act, authorities
which the president has properly exercised under the
Constitution for almost 200 years."
"The only way in which the constitutional powers of a
branch of government can be altered is by amending the
Constitution — and any attempt to make such alterations
by legislation alone is clearly without force."
The President said a veto message would be warranted
solely on constitutional grounds but added that "he was
deeply disturbed by the practical consequences of this
resolution."
Cities League Abstains On Prop. 1
SAN FRANCISCO — Delegates to the convention of
the League of California cities voted 138 to 107 yesterday
not to take a stand on Gov. Reagan's controversial tax
initiative, Prop. 1.
The action, on a motion by Seal Beach Councilman
Frank Sales, followed a long and heated discussion.
Reagan, in a luncheon session following the vote
refusing to take a stand, said the initiative would not shift
tax-financed programs to local taxpayers.
"Does it seem likely now that I would be proposing a
plan to reduce taxes by shifting them back to local
government?" he asked.
The governor said the plan includes a provision that the
state must finance any new or expanded programs
mandated on local government.

Small Unemployment Rise Predicted
WASHINGTON — Chairman Herbert F. Stein of the
President's Council of Economic Advisers said yesterday
he expects there may be some increase in unemployment
next year but that the increase will not be great.
Stein also said the rate of increase in food prices should
slow sharply and will not be the major worry of the
American housewife a year from now.
At a news briefing Stein said the economy should
continue to grow next year at a rate that will avoid
recession and create new jobs.
However, he qualified this by saying that employment
cannot continue increasing at the rate of the past 12
months when 2.7 million new jobs were created.
Stein also said 1974 will be a "troublesome year" for
inflation because of "special factors," especially food
costs. He forecast that prices will continue rising at a rate
above five percent into early 1974, then fall below that
rate.
Kemper Mass Murder Trial Opens
SANTA CRUZ — A six-man, six-woman jury trying
Edmund Emil Kemper 111 on mass murder charges listened

yesterday to a tape recording in which the defendant told
police:
"I blew it Saturday and killed my mother. Sunday Sara
came over and I killed her. Then I just packed up and
split."
The 6-foot-9, 280-pound Kemper sat impassively in the
Santa Cruz County Superior courtroom as the prosecution
played tapes of a call he made to police here from a
Pueblo, Colo, phone booth two days after his mother and
her friend Sara Hallett were brutally slain last April.
"I want you to get someone over here," Kemper had
told police. "I'm about two inches right now from doing a
whole lot and there's nothing I can do about it."
Kemper, 25, has pleaded innocent and innocent by
reason of insanity to the mutilation murders of his
mother, Clara Strandberg, 53, of Sara Hallett, 59, and of
six coed hitchhikers beginning in May 1972. Some of the
victims were shot, others strangled, and most of the
bodies were dismembered.
Today's Weather
