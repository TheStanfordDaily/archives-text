# 'Busy' Nixon Delays Broadcast

WASHINGTON (AP) — Saying he was too busy with
the Middle East crisis to write a speech, President Nixon
canceled a planned address to the nation last night on the
Watergate tapes controversy. He promised, instead, to
hold a news conference tonight at 6 p.m. PDT.
The latest presidential surprise in a week of jolting
events came as the House proceeded with an inquiry on
impeachment of Nixon.
The White House announced Nixon's speech
cancellation less than two hours after the President
returned here from a night at the presidential retreat at
Camp David, Md. It was reported Nixon had gone there to
compose a speech keynoted by a plea for national unity.
But yesterday morning Deputy White House Press
Secretary Gerald L. Warren said Nixon's time at Camp

David had been consumed completely by Middle East
developments and Nixon had thus opted instead for the
broadcast news conference tonight.
In addition to Watergate, the news conference would
deal with the Middle East war and other issues, a White
House spokesman said.
Meanwhile, House Speaker Carl Albert said the
preliminary House inquiry on impeachment of Nixon will
proceed. Albert said the inquiry was unaffected by
Nixon's decision Tuesday to comply with a court order to
turn over nine White House tape recordings and assorted
documents which may yield evidence for a Watergate
grand jury.
The tapes initially were subpoenaed for the grand jury
