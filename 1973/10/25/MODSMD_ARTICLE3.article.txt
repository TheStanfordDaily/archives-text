# 'Busy' Nixon Delays Broadcast
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — Saying he was too busy with
the Middle East crisis to write a speech, President Nixon
canceled a planned address to the nation last night on the
Watergate tapes controversy. He promised, instead, to
hold a news conference tonight at 6 p.m. PDT.
The latest presidential surprise in a week of jolting
events came as the House proceeded with an inquiry on
impeachment of Nixon.
The White House announced Nixon's speech
cancellation less than two hours after the President
returned here from a night at the presidential retreat at
Camp David, Md. It was reported Nixon had gone there to
compose a speech keynoted by a plea for national unity.
But yesterday morning Deputy White House Press
Secretary Gerald L. Warren said Nixon's time at Camp

David had been consumed completely by Middle East
developments and Nixon had thus opted instead for the
broadcast news conference tonight.
In addition to Watergate, the news conference would
deal with the Middle East war and other issues, a White
House spokesman said.
Meanwhile, House Speaker Carl Albert said the
preliminary House inquiry on impeachment of Nixon will
proceed. Albert said the inquiry was unaffected by
Nixon's decision Tuesday to comply with a court order to
turn over nine White House tape recordings and assorted
documents which may yield evidence for a Watergate
grand jury.
The tapes initially were subpoenaed for the grand jury
by special Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox whom
Nixon fired last Saturday. It was that firing, coupled with
the resignation of Atty. Gen. Elliot L. Richardson and
dismissal of Asst. Atty. Gen. William D. Ruckelshaus,
which triggered the impeachment inquiry.
"I hope it is expeditious," Albert said of the inquiry,
"and I hope it lays this thing to rest one way or another."
Mandate
Albert noted the House Judiciary Committee had been
mandated to make inquiries into impeachment resolutions
or bring impeachment charges against Nixon.
The committee's chairman, Rep. Peter W. Rodino Jr.,
D-N.J., said it was possible his panel would subpoena
administration records for use in its probe.
Although Nixon attorney Charles Alan Wright told
Sirica the material would be transmitted as soon as
possible, it apparently had not reached the judge by
yesterday afternoon.
In an interview, Sirica said he was very happy with

Nixon's decision to turn over the material.
Even though Sirica will get the tapes, it seemed
apparent that it would be months until the public finds
out what is on them — if the public ever finds out at all.
Sirica will listen to the tapes alone and secretly. If he
deems any material on them to be evidence needed by the
Watergate grand jury, he will give the panel that material.
But since grand jury evidence also is secret, the
contents of the tapes may never become public unless the
material is called into evidence at a public trial resulting
from a grand jury indictment.
Meanwhile, the man who now runs the Justice
Department's Watergate investigation, Asst. Atty. Gen.
Henry E. Petersen, said Nixon's turnabout on the tapes
issue in the face of impeachment means the Watergate
prosecutors may have easier access to vital White House
records.
"The events are reassuring," Petersen said. "It's crystal
clear we want these cases to proceed with dispatch and
integrity. Beyond that, I can't say."

compose a speech keynoted by a plea for national unity.
But yesterday morning Deputy White House Press
Secretary Gerald L. Warren said Nixon's time at Camp

David had been consumed completely by Middle East
developments and Nixon had thus opted instead for the
broadcast news conference tonight.
In addition to Watergate, the news conference would
deal with the Middle East war and other issues, a White
House spokesman said.
Meanwhile, House Speaker Carl Albert said the
preliminary House inquiry on impeachment of Nixon will
proceed. Albert said the inquiry was unaffected by
Nixon's decision Tuesday to comply with a court order to
turn over nine White House tape recordings and assorted
documents which may yield evidence for a Watergate
grand jury.
The tapes initially were subpoenaed for the grand jury
by special Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox whom
Nixon fired last Saturday. It was that firing, coupled with
the resignation of Atty. Gen. Elliot L. Richardson and
dismissal of Asst. Atty. Gen. William D. Ruckelshaus,
which triggered the impeachment inquiry.
"I hope it is expeditious," Albert said of the inquiry,
"and I hope it lays this thing to rest one way or another."
Mandate
Albert noted the House Judiciary Committee had been
mandated to make inquiries into impeachment resolutions
or bring impeachment charges against Nixon.
The committee's chairman, Rep. Peter W. Rodino Jr.,
D-N.J., said it was possible his panel would subpoena
administration records for use in its probe.
Although Nixon attorney Charles Alan Wright told
Sirica the material would be transmitted as soon as
possible, it apparently had not reached the judge by
yesterday afternoon.
In an interview, Sirica said he was very happy with

Nixon's decision to turn over the material.
Even though Sirica will get the tapes, it seemed
apparent that it would be months until the public finds
out what is on them — if the public ever finds out at all.
Sirica will listen to the tapes alone and secretly. If he
deems any material on them to be evidence needed by the
Watergate grand jury, he will give the panel that material.
But since grand jury evidence also is secret, the
contents of the tapes may never become public unless the
material is called into evidence at a public trial resulting
from a grand jury indictment.
Meanwhile, the man who now runs the Justice
Department's Watergate investigation, Asst. Atty. Gen.
Henry E. Petersen, said Nixon's turnabout on the tapes
issue in the face of impeachment means the Watergate
prosecutors may have easier access to vital White House
records.
"The events are reassuring," Petersen said. "It's crystal
clear we want these cases to proceed with dispatch and
integrity. Beyond that, I can't say."
WASHINGTON (AP) — Saying he was too busy with
the Middle East crisis to write a speech, President Nixon
canceled a planned address to the nation last night on the
Watergate tapes controversy. He promised, instead, to
hold a news conference tonight at 6 p.m. PDT.
The latest presidential surprise in a week of jolting
events came as the House proceeded with an inquiry on
impeachment of Nixon.
The White House announced Nixon's speech
cancellation less than two hours after the President
returned here from a night at the presidential retreat at
Camp David, Md. It was reported Nixon had gone there to
compose a speech keynoted by a plea for national unity.
