# Student Debtors Prove Sluggish; Numerous Loans Remain Unpaid

### BILL ROSS 
Delinquencies on loans to students here are a growing
problem, according to Joseph Jedd, student accounting
manager.
"Loan delinquency is increasing at a rate of 19 percent
per year," Jedd said. "Currently, the University has
$800,000 owed to it that should already have been
repaid."
The most distressing part of the dilemma is the growing
number of former students who declare themselves
bankrupt and are thereby relieved of all loan obligations,
Jedd contended.
Last year the University lost $35,000 because of
debtors' bankruptcy proceedings. Repaid loan money is
distributed to current students, so unpaid loans threaten
future loans, Jedd said.
According to National Direct Student Loan (NDSL)
policies, repayments of loans do not begin until nine
months after a student leaves the University. A period of
ten months is allowed for termination of the total debt.
Few Willing
Jedd said few people are willing to forestall a career
and accumulate debts necessary for bankruptcy in order
to avoid repaying the University. But some people acquire
other debts while at the University and then declare
bankruptcy upon graduating.
"Although this is still relatively uncommon, when we
consider that the trend is growing, it's like a hole in the
dike," Jedd stated. "Not long ago, bankruptcy involved

public disgrace and was considered a breach of faith. Now
the morals of society seem to be changing, and many
people are not embarrassed about declaring bankruptcy."
Some people have legitimate reasons for declaring
bankruptcy, Jedd conceded. "If a person has been
burdened by financial reverses or illness, he is entited to
legal protection. But it's indecent for the bankruptcy law
to be used as an excuse for shirking obligations."
Excuses
Jedd added he is not certain how many bankruptcies
involving former students are based on legitimate excuses,
but he said the courts seldom allow for dissolution of loan
contracts on the basis of tenuous arguments.
He cited as an example a case involving a former
student, Rafael Palacio, that came before a Redwood City
municipal court last Friday.
Palacio borrowed approximately $5800 in University
and National Defense loans between 1966 and 1969, Jedd
said. Palacio then refused to repay the loan, arguing that
he was under the age of 21 when he contracted for the
loans and didn't understand the terms of the loan
agreement. After receiving no reply to collection letters,
the University turned the case over to a collection agency,
Jedd said.
The court found Palacio's argument invalid and ruled
against him, Jedd said. Now Palacio must not only repay
his loan, but must pay nearly $500 in court costs and
attorney's fees.
"We try hard to accommodate people," Jedd said. "If a
person seems to be making a real effort to repay the loan,
we are understanding and are willing to wait for the
payments."
Sizable Sum
Although less than one percent of the $29 million
loaned to Stanford students since 1917 has been
uncollectable, this still amounts to a sizable sum of
money, Jedd noted. Even so, Jedd estimated that the
situation here is only about half as bad as it is at other
schools.
To combat the problem, Jedd said Stanford is making
an effort to change the bankruptcy laws to exempt
educational loans from bankruptcy proceedings.
"This is a good time for the universities to try to
influence members of Congress, because revision of
bankruptcy laws is currently under consideration," Jedd
said.
"The sympathies of the taxpayers and the students are
with us," Jedd concluded, "as the current bankruptcy
laws discriminate against people who repay loans and the
laws prevent more students from receiving loans."
