# Coed Bathrooms Offer Unrestricted Movement

Remember Playboy's expose of cohabitation here?
Pictures of coed showers and endless orgies sparked terror
in the hearts of many parents and wild anticipation in the
minds of many freshmen. Stanford life appeared to center
around the john.
But a casual tour of the coed bathrooms on campus is
sure to disappoint the scandal-seeker. Not only are most
students content with the situation, but few use the
bathroom for unusual activities. Mention coed bathrooms
to the typical Stanford student, and the response is more
likely to be a blank stare than a lustful grin.
Even the University Administration takes a laissez-faire
attitude. Larry Horton, associate dean of student affairs,
said, "We [the University] supply restrooms as directed
by the state hotel code. We can't tell students how to use
them."
Many coed houses such as Grove, ZAP, Durand and
Lambda Nu, as well as most co-ops, have some form of
coed facilities. Some houses have certain limitations:
Lambda Nu has a knock-first system and Theta Chi has
single-sex showers. However, in Terra and other houses all
facilities are coed.
Bathroom Vote
Residents in ATO recently put the bathroom issue up
to a vote. Options included: unrestricted coed; coed with
restrictions on showers; coed with restrictions on urinals;
or single-sex bathrooms. Although 27 people voted for
some form of coed bathrooms, the vote was splintered
and 14 opposition votes defeated the proposal.
Some students argue that coed bathrooms are illegal,
but the issue is open to debate. The State Housing Act
lays down the rules: The landlord (the University) must
provide "on each floor for each sex for each 10 guests or
fractional number thereof, at least one water closet and
lavatory and one bath accessible from public
hallway .... Each facility shall be clearly designated for
men or for women."
However, the use of these facilities is up to residents.
The University only intervenes when someone files a
complaint. Official complaints are rare;, however some

students grumble about problems of privacy and modesty.
It's something of a shock to step out of the steamy stall
and find someone of the opposite sex stepping into the
adjacent one!
Peeping Toms
Strangers wandering into a house with coed bathrooms
can create problems, especially for women. Since men and
women share the facilities, no one pays much attention to
who goes in. A student in Lambda Nu was followed into
the shower by two peeping toms last year. Both she and
her roommate prefer the privacy of single-sex bathrooms,
although they've never complained.
But an overwhelming majority of 40 students
interviewed felt that coed bathrooms are convenient and
often an improvement over single-sex facilities.
One student said frivolously that "single-sex bathrooms
give rise to homosexuality." The claim is an extreme one,
but many others do feel that coed bathrooms are healthier
and more natural.
Like Family Home
A woman in ZAP compared it to living in a family
home, where both sexes use the same facilities. She felt
that students are generally more at ease with one another
when they share a bathroom. Another enthusiast
advocated coed bathrooms for "every red-blooded
person," likening them in effect to encounter groups.
In addition, coed bathrooms are simply more
convenient than single-sex ones, say residents. On coed
corridors, residents can use the nearest facility instead of
trudging up or down stairs when an off-limits facility is
right across the hall.
Residents say the bathrooms are favorite gathering
places. They assure the wary, though, that all showers are
curtained and toilets enclosed, so one can have as much
privacy as desired.
In general, students seem to have overcome their
inhibitions quickly. Many say they never felt any
embarrassment and the rest soon grew used to coed
toothbrush sessions. Coed bathrooms have become just a
part of everyday life for many Stanford students.

students of both sexes brush their teeth out in the open, privacy is still available for more discreet activities.

sure to disappoint the scandal-seeker. Not only are most
students content with the situation, but few use the
bathroom for unusual activities. Mention coed bathrooms
to the typical Stanford student, and the response is more
likely to be a blank stare than a lustful grin.
Even the University Administration takes a laissez-faire
attitude. Larry Horton, associate dean of student affairs,
said, "We [the University] supply restrooms as directed
by the state hotel code. We can't tell students how to use
them."
Many coed houses such as Grove, ZAP, Durand and
Lambda Nu, as well as most co-ops, have some form of
coed facilities. Some houses have certain limitations:
Lambda Nu has a knock-first system and Theta Chi has
single-sex showers. However, in Terra and other houses all
facilities are coed.
Bathroom Vote
Residents in ATO recently put the bathroom issue up
to a vote. Options included: unrestricted coed; coed with
restrictions on showers; coed with restrictions on urinals;
or single-sex bathrooms. Although 27 people voted for
some form of coed bathrooms, the vote was splintered
and 14 opposition votes defeated the proposal.
Some students argue that coed bathrooms are illegal,
but the issue is open to debate. The State Housing Act
lays down the rules: The landlord (the University) must
provide "on each floor for each sex for each 10 guests or
fractional number thereof, at least one water closet and
lavatory and one bath accessible from public
hallway .... Each facility shall be clearly designated for
men or for women."
However, the use of these facilities is up to residents.
The University only intervenes when someone files a
complaint. Official complaints are rare;, however some

students grumble about problems of privacy and modesty.
It's something of a shock to step out of the steamy stall
and find someone of the opposite sex stepping into the
adjacent one!
Peeping Toms
Strangers wandering into a house with coed bathrooms
can create problems, especially for women. Since men and
women share the facilities, no one pays much attention to
who goes in. A student in Lambda Nu was followed into
the shower by two peeping toms last year. Both she and
her roommate prefer the privacy of single-sex bathrooms,
although they've never complained.
But an overwhelming majority of 40 students
interviewed felt that coed bathrooms are convenient and
often an improvement over single-sex facilities.
One student said frivolously that "single-sex bathrooms
give rise to homosexuality." The claim is an extreme one,
but many others do feel that coed bathrooms are healthier
and more natural.
Like Family Home
A woman in ZAP compared it to living in a family
home, where both sexes use the same facilities. She felt
that students are generally more at ease with one another
when they share a bathroom. Another enthusiast
advocated coed bathrooms for "every red-blooded
person," likening them in effect to encounter groups.
In addition, coed bathrooms are simply more
convenient than single-sex ones, say residents. On coed
corridors, residents can use the nearest facility instead of
trudging up or down stairs when an off-limits facility is
right across the hall.
Residents say the bathrooms are favorite gathering
places. They assure the wary, though, that all showers are
curtained and toilets enclosed, so one can have as much
privacy as desired.
In general, students seem to have overcome their
inhibitions quickly. Many say they never felt any
embarrassment and the rest soon grew used to coed
toothbrush sessions. Coed bathrooms have become just a
part of everyday life for many Stanford students.

JOLLY JOHNMATES — Coed bathrooms around campus help spice up the drudgery of normal morning rituals. While
students of both sexes brush their teeth out in the open, privacy is still available for more discreet activities.
Remember Playboy's expose of cohabitation here?
Pictures of coed showers and endless orgies sparked terror
in the hearts of many parents and wild anticipation in the
minds of many freshmen. Stanford life appeared to center
around the john.
