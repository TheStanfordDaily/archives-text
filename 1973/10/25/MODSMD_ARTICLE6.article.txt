## Aid Farmworkers 
### 
The long struggle of the United Farmworkers for human
justice in the fields of California continues.
The farmworkers' strike against table grape growers, who
had refused to renew their UFW contracts and instead
formed an unholy alliance with the Teamsters, has been
largely successful; earlier this month, the Teamsters agreed
to move out of the Coachella grape fields.
Nevertheless, the Teamsters have unaccountably delayed
implementing the table grapes pact. And strikes against some
lettuce growers, and against several major wine producers
who signed Teamster contracts this summer, go on.
Consumers can aid the farmworkers in their struggle for
higher wages, better living conditions, and better
educational, medical and sanitary facilities. The ongoing
boycott of nonunion products — and of their major
distributors, like Safeway — is a simple, but effective matter.
A Farmworkers' Support Committee, to help organize
promote the boycott, organize picketing, and support the
union, has been formed on campus and needs your help.
The Daily supports the efforts of the UFW and the
Farmworkers Organizing Committee. We urge you to
boycott lettuce and table grapes unless you see the union
label. We urge you to boycott Safeway stores.
We urge you to boycott nonunion wines and brandies:
Gallo, which includes Red Mountain and Boone's Farm as
well as any wine with "Modesto, California" on the label;
Franzia Brothers; and Guild, which includes Tavola and
Cribari. Connoisseurs will have little trouble finding other
labels that are more than adequate companions to their
dining.
