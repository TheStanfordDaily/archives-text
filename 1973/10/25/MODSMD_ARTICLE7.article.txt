# Palestinians Struggle To Regain Honor
## Arab Traditions And Land Ties Spur Defense 
###

Misunderstanding is the key
word in the Middle East Crisis,
misunderstanding of both the
Arabs and the Israelis. The
conflict has been a lingering and
confusing dispute, full of
paradoxes and ambiguities,
torture and disruption, tragedy
and terror. The Arab-Palestinian
position is least understood in the
West, and a basic outline is here
presented.
Land plays a primary role in
the life of a Palestinian townsman
and villager. Besides serving as a
social index for status, arable land
is the major source of livelihood
in this predominantly agrarian
region. It is a scarce resource and
is "hoarded" by its owners. Arab
marriage patterns and economic
relationships are often structured
to concentrate wealth within the
family because family land and
wealth are most commonly lost
by inheritance and sale.
Ownership of Arab land results
from specific birthright, birthright
through traditional association
and identification of a family with
their property.
Arab land is also associated
with family stability. In the first
place, the patriarchal nature of
Arab society is based on strict
division of labor, particularly in
the fields. Men and women
associate in their work; but play a
reciprocal role to each other, the
labor of one complements the
labor of the other, never truly
intersecting.
Land Ties
In the second place, family
land holdings are often the setting
of kinship gatherings for labor,

ceremony, and entertainment. A
family's security is often
synonymous with the quantity
and quality of their land holdings,
and this socioeconomic bond
within a family acts to strengthen
family unity.
Thirdly, a family's heritage is
directly associated with the family
property and this property
determines the identity of the kin
group. Such a personal
relationship of land to the family
intensifies the Arab's association
with the land and is a root source
of the Arab conviction to regain
Palestine. The war has intensified
existing sectionalist tendencies
and retarded industrial progress.
Pride is a salient characteristic
of the "Arab personality." It
stems from the Bedouin ideal of
the honorable man; one of strong
character, devout faith, and
steadfast loyalty. In general, pride
rests on the personal estimation of
oneself and the degree to which
one's public image agrees. Arab
pride is most closely associated
with one's family name, the
chastity of one's sisters, mothers,
and daughters, and one's own
respectability in public and
private life.
Local and national pride are
also significant. The public or
external aspect of pride is most
important to the Arab, while the
private or internal aspect is more
important in the West. This
becomes important in
understanding Arab reaction to
regional and international insults.
Above all, an Arab feels he must
uphold his public image of pride
and will do so at great expense.

Given this sociological
background, we can begin to
understand the significance land
plays in the life of a Palestinian
Arab. A statistical background
will lend a greater perspective.
Approximately the size of
Vermont, the west bank of the
Jordan River was the richest
portion of the Jordanian
Kingdom. In 1965 this contested
region produced 38 percent of
Jordan's domestic products, and
represented 48 percent of
Jordan's industrial establishments.
Producing 60 percent of Jordan's
fruit and vegetable output and 80
percent of the olive crop, the
west bank was the most fertile area
of the Jordanian/Israeli region.
Rainfall averages are from 24 to
30 inches a year, whereas 20 miles
to the east, annual rainfall varies
from 3 to 8 inches. Palestine is a
fertile "accident" in this dry and
arid region; it is "the land of milk
and honey."
The high quality of Palestinian
land has made it a contested area
throughout history. Canaanites,
Israelites, Persians, Greeks,
Romans, Arabs and Turks have all
conquered and ruled the Jordan
River Valley. When Zionists call
for a "return to the homeland,"
Arabs feel that if such a call be
made, it should be made to all
ancestors of former inhabitants.
They most strongly feel, however,
that the land belongs to the most
recent inhabitants, themselves.
Existence
They are bound by family,
economics, and tradition to
maintain their existence in
Palestine, to maintain this
existence at all costs. To them,
the creation of Israel means the
displacement of Palestine. They
are committed to Palestine, and
therefore, to the dissolution of
the Israeli state.
An important distinction must
here be made. The Arab/Israeli
war is not a religious conflict or
an ethnic dispute. Historically,
Moslems and Jews have been
consistently compatible, and with
rare exception, the Arabs have
never persecuted the Jews. Today,
they are fighting for what they
believe is rightfully theirs. The

war can be better viewed from the
perspective of state versus the
people, a situation where
Palestinians are excluded from
government representation and
participation. To them, the state
of Israel is an aggressive
institution, bent on eradication or
relocation of Palestinians.
To the Palestinians, their
eradication or relocation is not a
simple policy of Israel, but rather,
it is the basic principle and
philosophy on which Israel was
founded. Palestinians haye
considered their options and have
determined to fight for their
beliefs. Resistance in Palestine,
raids on foreign embassies, and
skyjackings throughout the world
all symbolize Palestinian
obstinance. Their perseverance
and determination are fired by
their conviction to regain their
inherited rights. The deep feeling
of injustice, the commitment to
regain the land, and the sense of
persecution constitute the moral

basis for Arab Palestinian action.
Palestinians feel legally and
morally bound to realize their
goals. To do so is to regain their
heritage; to sacrifice, for this
cause, is to regain honor and
respect.
The Palestinians feel innocent
of the slaughter and displacement
of Jews in World War 11. Their
stated goal is to regain Palestine
and to create a democratic and
secular state. Persecution of the
Jews is not an Arab tradition and
it is not their intention. Their goal
is equal representation in
government and renewed
residence in their traditional land.
To understand this crisis, we must
comprehend the Palestinian and
Arab goals and grasp their cultural
perspective.
