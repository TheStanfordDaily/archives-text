# Advertisement Policy
## 
### 
While the Daily supports the struggle of the United
Farmworkers, it also publishes advertisements for Gallo wine.
Many people have questioned this policy of open access to
advertising space as an apparent contradiction.
The Daily Editorial Board urges our readers to boycott Gallo
and all other nonunion wines. At the same time, the Board is
opposed to excluding anyone from access to advertising space for
political reasons, regardless of whether his views are unacceptable
to the Board or unpopular in the Community.
Daily advertising policy is as follows:
The Daily accepts all advertising, regardless of source, except
that judged by the Editorial Board to be libelous, inciting to illegal
acts of violence, or legally obscene.
