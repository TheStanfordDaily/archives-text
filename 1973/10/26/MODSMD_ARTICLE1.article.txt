# Russian Moves In Middle East Provoke Full U.S. Military Alert
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Millions of
American soldiers, sailors and airmen
around the world were put on general
military alert yesterday in an apparent
warning to the Soviet Union to keep
its troops out of the Middle East.
A midnight message from Adm.
Thomas H. Moorer, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, sent all active
U.S. military units into various stages
of readiness to move into action if
needed. But Pentagon officials
emphasized that no troops were
moving within the United States or
overseas.
Meanwhile, denying that the White
House is "playing with the lives of the
American people," Secretary of State
Henry A. Kissinger icily rejected any
suggestion that yesterday's Mideast
developments were staged to obscure

the still-boiling Watergate affair.
President Nixon postponed until
today a news conference for questions
about Watergate, even as new scandal
disclosures surfaced and Republicans
in Congress stepped up pressure for a
new special prosecutor.
The White House said Nixon was
too busy with the Middle East to hold
the news conference planned for last
night.
News Conference
Kissinger, speaking at a State
Department news conference, was
asked whether domestic problems had
prompted Nixon to call yesterday's
early morning military alert.
"We are attempting to conduct the
foreign policy of the United States
with regard for . . . future
generations," he said, adding:

"It is a symptom of what is
happening in this country that it even
could be suggested that the United
States would alert its forces for
domestic reasons."
At another point, he said, "There
has to be a minimum of confidence
that the senior officials of the
American government are not playing
with the lives of the American
people."
Alert 'Precautionary'
President Nixon ordered the alert as
a precautionary measure after
American officials noticed an
"ambiguity in some of the actions and
statements" by the Russians, Secretary
of State Henry A. Kissinger said.
Kissinger declined to give details,
but referred to movement within the
Soviet Union of Russian troops and
statements by Moscow representatives
at the United Nations.
Without saying so directly,
Kissinger had indicated Soviet
agreement to keep out of a
peace-keeping force would lead to the
relaxing of the U.S. military alert.
Intelligence Confirms Moves
Other U.S. government officials
said Kissinger was referring in part to
intelligence reports that the Russians
had alerted some of their airborne
units in Eastern Europe.
Coupled with this information,
sources said, was an unexplained
increase in the Soviet airlift to Egypt,
suggesting the Russians might be flying
troops to Cairo.
"The alert will not last one moment
longer than absolutely necessary and
will be lifted as soon as there is no
threat of unilateral action" by the
Soviets, Kissinger told reporters.
He stressed that the alert "was
precautionary in nature" and that the
chances for peace remain promising.
U.N. Resolution
In another development, the U.N.
Security Council quickly approved a

resolution to dispatch a peace-keeping
farce that will not include American,
Russian or other major power forces.
As an urgent interim step, the council
then authorized immediate dispatch of
some U.N. peace-keeping troops from
their bases on Mediterranean island of
Cyprus to start supervision of the
cease-fire.
The Security Council resolution,
the third such action since the fighting
broke out Oct. 6, provided that none
of the five nations permanently
represented on the council would be
used in any peace-keeping force.
With the United States and Russia
agreeing and China abstaining, the
success of the resolution was
guaranteed.
On the battle front, Egypt said
Israeli invasion tanks tried to storm

MONEY, MONEY, AND MORE MONEY — Instead of the teacher evaluation
statements which have been the topics of earlier meetings, the Faculty Senate
yesterday changed tacks and examined financial aid.
Suez city twice yesterday despite the
Middle East truce. A high Egyptian
official in effect conceded Israeli
claims that a large force of Egyptian
soldiers had been cut off in the Sinai.
Ashraf Ghorbal, a top adviser to
President Anwar Sadat, charged that
Israeli troops blocked U.N. truce
observers from getting to the southern
front near Suez city, turning them
back about 61 miles from Cairo.
That was the first Egyptian
admission that Israel controlled the
vital Cairo-to-Suez supply route. It
indirectly confirmed Israeli claims that
the Egyptian 3rd Army — reported to
include 20,000 soldiers with 200 tanks
— was stranded on the eastern bank of
the canal.
Tanks Destroyed
Ghorbal told newsmen in Cairo
fighting was still going on around Suez
city at the southern end of the Suez
Canal "because of Israeli cease-fire
violations."
