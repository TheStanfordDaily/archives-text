# Moral And Legal Issues
## Grounds For Impeachment Examined 
### 
President Nixon's capitulation
on the tapes should not lessen the
drive for his impeachment. It
remains to be seen what he
understands by this agreement; he
has a notorious history of
procrastinating and reinterpreting
his agreements, as his letter to
Elliott Richardson shows. In it
Mr. Nixon states that he
"regret(ted) the necessity of
intruding ... on the independence
that I promised you (Richardson)
with regard to Watergate when I
announced your appointment"
(New York Times 23 October
1973). Therefore, one should
probably reserve judgment on this

declaration of intention until
Nixon actually hands over the
tapes.
Nevertheless, the issue of the
tapes is but one of many issues
that brought the need for
impeachment to the public
attention in a dramatic way. The
grounds for this action divide
themselves into two classes: legal
grounds for impeachment and
serious questions about the
conduct of the administration
which have not yet emerged as
legal grounds, but have already
damaged the moral authority of
the Executive beyond the point
where he can command the
necessary respect to govern
effectively. Five of the former and
five of the latter come to mind.
Legal Grounds
Actions or decisions by the
President which, if performed by
any other man or women,
constitute a violation of federal
law are here considered legal
grounds for impeachment. At this
time, legal ground for
impeachment would seem to
include: 1. the Tom Huston Plan
which Nixon personally approved
on 25 July 1970, which included
clearance for domestic political
surveillance and espionage — and
such methods as burglary,
wiretapping, eavesdropping, mail
covers, and military spying on
civilians.
2. The President interfered in
the Ellsberg prosecution in a way
that was intended to subvert the
cause of justice; in that case, by
offering Judge Matt Byrne a
federal office while he was sitting
on a case in which the Federal
Government was the protagonist.
3. The President authorized and
maintained a private army of
undercover agents, also known as
the "plumbers," which engaged in
illegal activities to harrass and
undermine political opponents of
the President. They also broke
into the office of Daniel Ellsberg's
psychiatrist in an illegal attempt
to get evidence which would help
to convict Ellsberg.
4. Moreover, the President has
refused to spend billions of dollars
authorized by the Congress for
various domestic programs, using
the device of impoundment. The
Congressional Research Service
records that seventeen billion
dollars — ear-marked for
education, mental health,
neighborhood and youth corps,
library services, veterans aid, rural
and subsidized housing programs,
Indian education, highway funds,
and research in cancer and heart
disease — have been impounded
by the President. Hubert Marshall
suggests that in this case, too,
President Nixon is in violation of
laws duly passed by Congress. He
is not alone: as of 6 August 1973,
the Government had lost 21 of 25

lower court cases in defense of the
President's impoundment actions.
5. Finally, the President
usurped the war-making powers of
Congress by bombing Cambodia
and deliberately concealed the
bombing from the nation by
having military members of this
nation lie to the Congress, falsify
records, and then even defend
such a procedure in public for
Congressional committees.
Additional Charges
The ACLU call for
impeachment would add to these
legal grounds the charges that he
interfered with the administration
of justice by his "effort to limit
the scope" of the FBl's
investigation of Watergate, and
that he "perverted and attempted
to pervert the operation of various
Federal agencies, including the
Department of Justice and the
National Security Council, Secret
Service, State Department,
Defense Department, and the
Central Intelligence Agency, by
engaging in political surveillance
and in the falsification of
information made available to the
Congress and American people."
These charges are, I feel, prima
facie legal grounds for
impeachment at this time.
There are, in addition, at least
five matters that, with the passage
of time could develop into clear
evidence of crime on the part of
this President. 1. First, the
extraordinary amount of money
spent on "security measures" on
his private houses has still not
been satisfactorily explained.
$10,000,000 in security
arrangements seems excessive and
suspicious in the light of the fact
that the admitted amount began
at one tenth of that figure, and it
was only as the press continued its
inquiries that the various agencies
admitted more and more had been
spent. Moreover, it is possible that
the $10,000,000 figure is merely a
stopping place along the way.
2. Secondly, the financial
arrangements involved in the
acquisitions of those house has
also been the subject of inquiry,
as well, as the tax status of the
San Clemente home.
3. It has yet to be explained
why Howard Hughes gave Charles
N. "Bebe" Rebozo $100,000
which was merely held in a safe
deposit box by Rebozo for a
period of three years, and then
returned to Hughes after the
Watergate investigation began to
break. The money was ostensibly
for "campaign activities," but Mr.
Rebozo has never had any
position in the campaign
organization for Richard Nixon.
What was the purpose of that
money?
4. The House Banking
Committee is interested to know
why the Treasury Department

Joseph F. Massey

twice turned back
recommendations of Federal Bank
examiners that a bank be
chartered in Key Biscayne to
compete with a monopoly bank
there, headed by Mr. Rebozo.
Every indication is that such a
refusal by the Treasury
Department of recommendations
of the Federal Examiners is highly
unusual, if not unique.
5. On Monday, 22 October
1973, the news media reported
that the AP had come into
possession of a letter from the
dairy industry to President Nixon
promising his campaign
$2,000,000 and dated two weeks
before the President imposed
import quotes on dairy products,
quotas which were highly
favorable to the dairy industry.
Much more needs to be known
about this transaction.
Due to the apparently illegal
actions of the President, and the
serious questions of conduct that
have been raised, I would urge
people not to give up the effort
begun as a result of the
outrageous disregard of the courts
over the Watergate tapes. Nixon's
admission, implicit in the handing
over of the tapes shows him, at
this time, either to be erratic in
his judgment and activities and to
be seriously out of touch with the
sentiment of the country, or it
indicates that the capitulation was
an act of cold calculation. It is not
an unfair conclusion that here is a
President who is either unable or
unwilling to reflect and represent
the wishes of the people.
The decision of the President
to adhere to Judge Sirica's
decision defers the issues of the
contents of the Watergate tapes. It
does not resolve them. For our
part, it is rather a moment of
reprieve to place the issue of the
tapes back into perspective and
consider the remaining, perhaps
more important, grounds for
impeachment.

undermine political opponents of
the President. They also broke
into the office of Daniel Ellsberg's
psychiatrist in an illegal attempt
to get evidence which would help
to convict Ellsberg.
4. Moreover, the President has
refused to spend billions of dollars
authorized by the Congress for
various domestic programs, using
the device of impoundment. The
Congressional Research Service
records that seventeen billion
dollars — ear-marked for
education, mental health,
neighborhood and youth corps,
library services, veterans aid, rural
and subsidized housing programs,
Indian education, highway funds,
and research in cancer and heart
disease — have been impounded
by the President. Hubert Marshall
suggests that in this case, too,
President Nixon is in violation of
laws duly passed by Congress. He
is not alone: as of 6 August 1973,
the Government had lost 21 of 25

lower court cases in defense of the
President's impoundment actions.
5. Finally, the President
usurped the war-making powers of
Congress by bombing Cambodia
and deliberately concealed the
bombing from the nation by
having military members of this
nation lie to the Congress, falsify
records, and then even defend
such a procedure in public for
Congressional committees.
Additional Charges
The ACLU call for
impeachment would add to these
legal grounds the charges that he
interfered with the administration
of justice by his "effort to limit
the scope" of the FBl's
investigation of Watergate, and
that he "perverted and attempted
to pervert the operation of various
Federal agencies, including the
Department of Justice and the
National Security Council, Secret
Service, State Department,
Defense Department, and the
Central Intelligence Agency, by
engaging in political surveillance
and in the falsification of
information made available to the
Congress and American people."
These charges are, I feel, prima
facie legal grounds for
impeachment at this time.
There are, in addition, at least
five matters that, with the passage
of time could develop into clear
evidence of crime on the part of
this President. 1. First, the
extraordinary amount of money
spent on "security measures" on
his private houses has still not
been satisfactorily explained.
$10,000,000 in security
arrangements seems excessive and
suspicious in the light of the fact
that the admitted amount began
at one tenth of that figure, and it
was only as the press continued its
inquiries that the various agencies
admitted more and more had been
spent. Moreover, it is possible that
the $10,000,000 figure is merely a
stopping place along the way.
2. Secondly, the financial
arrangements involved in the
acquisitions of those house has
also been the subject of inquiry,
as well, as the tax status of the
San Clemente home.
3. It has yet to be explained
why Howard Hughes gave Charles
N. "Bebe" Rebozo $100,000
which was merely held in a safe
deposit box by Rebozo for a
period of three years, and then
returned to Hughes after the
Watergate investigation began to
break. The money was ostensibly
for "campaign activities," but Mr.
Rebozo has never had any
position in the campaign
organization for Richard Nixon.
What was the purpose of that
money?
4. The House Banking
Committee is interested to know
why the Treasury Department

Joseph F. Massey

twice turned back
recommendations of Federal Bank
examiners that a bank be
chartered in Key Biscayne to
compete with a monopoly bank
there, headed by Mr. Rebozo.
Every indication is that such a
refusal by the Treasury
Department of recommendations
of the Federal Examiners is highly
unusual, if not unique.
5. On Monday, 22 October
1973, the news media reported
that the AP had come into
possession of a letter from the
dairy industry to President Nixon
promising his campaign
$2,000,000 and dated two weeks
before the President imposed
import quotes on dairy products,
quotas which were highly
favorable to the dairy industry.
Much more needs to be known
about this transaction.
Due to the apparently illegal
actions of the President, and the
serious questions of conduct that
have been raised, I would urge
people not to give up the effort
begun as a result of the
outrageous disregard of the courts
over the Watergate tapes. Nixon's
admission, implicit in the handing
over of the tapes shows him, at
this time, either to be erratic in
his judgment and activities and to
be seriously out of touch with the
sentiment of the country, or it
indicates that the capitulation was
an act of cold calculation. It is not
an unfair conclusion that here is a
President who is either unable or
unwilling to reflect and represent
the wishes of the people.
The decision of the President
to adhere to Judge Sirica's
decision defers the issues of the
contents of the Watergate tapes. It
does not resolve them. For our
part, it is rather a moment of
reprieve to place the issue of the
tapes back into perspective and
consider the remaining, perhaps
more important, grounds for
impeachment.
(Joseph F. Massey is a Seminary
Intern at Memorial Church.)

President Nixon's capitulation
on the tapes should not lessen the
drive for his impeachment. It
remains to be seen what he
understands by this agreement; he
has a notorious history of
procrastinating and reinterpreting
his agreements, as his letter to
Elliott Richardson shows. In it
Mr. Nixon states that he
"regret(ted) the necessity of
intruding ... on the independence
that I promised you (Richardson)
with regard to Watergate when I
announced your appointment"
(New York Times 23 October
1973). Therefore, one should
probably reserve judgment on this

declaration of intention until
Nixon actually hands over the
tapes.
Nevertheless, the issue of the
tapes is but one of many issues
that brought the need for
impeachment to the public
attention in a dramatic way. The
grounds for this action divide
themselves into two classes: legal
grounds for impeachment and
serious questions about the
conduct of the administration
which have not yet emerged as
legal grounds, but have already
damaged the moral authority of
the Executive beyond the point
where he can command the
necessary respect to govern
effectively. Five of the former and
five of the latter come to mind.
Legal Grounds
Actions or decisions by the
President which, if performed by
any other man or women,
constitute a violation of federal
law are here considered legal
grounds for impeachment. At this
time, legal ground for
impeachment would seem to
include: 1. the Tom Huston Plan
which Nixon personally approved
on 25 July 1970, which included
clearance for domestic political
surveillance and espionage — and
such methods as burglary,
wiretapping, eavesdropping, mail
covers, and military spying on
civilians.
2. The President interfered in
the Ellsberg prosecution in a way
that was intended to subvert the
cause of justice; in that case, by
offering Judge Matt Byrne a
federal office while he was sitting
on a case in which the Federal
Government was the protagonist.
3. The President authorized and
maintained a private army of
undercover agents, also known as
the "plumbers," which engaged in
illegal activities to harrass and
undermine political opponents of
the President. They also broke
into the office of Daniel Ellsberg's
psychiatrist in an illegal attempt
to get evidence which would help
to convict Ellsberg.

his private houses has still not
been satisfactorily explained.
$10,000,000 in security
arrangements seems excessive and
suspicious in the light of the fact
that the admitted amount began
at one tenth of that figure, and it
was only as the press continued its
inquiries that the various agencies
admitted more and more had been
spent. Moreover, it is possible that
the $10,000,000 figure is merely a
stopping place along the way.
2. Secondly, the financial
arrangements involved in the
acquisitions of those house has
also been the subject of inquiry,
as well, as the tax status of the
San Clemente home.
3. It has yet to be explained
why Howard Hughes gave Charles
N. "Bebe" Rebozo $100,000
which was merely held in a safe
deposit box by Rebozo for a
period of three years, and then
returned to Hughes after the
Watergate investigation began to
break. The money was ostensibly
for "campaign activities," but Mr.
Rebozo has never had any
position in the campaign
organization for Richard Nixon.
What was the purpose of that
money?
4. The House Banking
Committee is interested to know
why the Treasury Department

Joseph F. Massey

twice turned back
recommendations of Federal Bank
examiners that a bank be
chartered in Key Biscayne to
compete with a monopoly bank
there, headed by Mr. Rebozo.
Every indication is that such a
refusal by the Treasury
Department of recommendations
of the Federal Examiners is highly
unusual, if not unique.
5. On Monday, 22 October
1973, the news media reported
that the AP had come into
possession of a letter from the
dairy industry to President Nixon
promising his campaign
$2,000,000 and dated two weeks
before the President imposed
import quotes on dairy products,
quotas which were highly
favorable to the dairy industry.
Much more needs to be known
about this transaction.
Due to the apparently illegal
actions of the President, and the
serious questions of conduct that
have been raised, I would urge
people not to give up the effort
begun as a result of the
outrageous disregard of the courts
over the Watergate tapes. Nixon's
admission, implicit in the handing
over of the tapes shows him, at
this time, either to be erratic in
his judgment and activities and to
be seriously out of touch with the
sentiment of the country, or it
indicates that the capitulation was
an act of cold calculation. It is not
an unfair conclusion that here is a
President who is either unable or
unwilling to reflect and represent
the wishes of the people.
The decision of the President
to adhere to Judge Sirica's
decision defers the issues of the
contents of the Watergate tapes. It
does not resolve them. For our
part, it is rather a moment of
reprieve to place the issue of the
tapes back into perspective and
consider the remaining, perhaps
more important, grounds for
impeachment.
(Joseph F. Massey is a Seminary
Intern at Memorial Church.)

President Nixon's capitulation
on the tapes should not lessen the
drive for his impeachment. It
remains to be seen what he
understands by this agreement; he
has a notorious history of
procrastinating and reinterpreting
his agreements, as his letter to
Elliott Richardson shows. In it
Mr. Nixon states that he
"regret(ted) the necessity of
intruding ... on the independence
that I promised you (Richardson)
with regard to Watergate when I
announced your appointment"
(New York Times 23 October
1973). Therefore, one should
probably reserve judgment on this

declaration of intention until
Nixon actually hands over the
tapes.
Nevertheless, the issue of the
tapes is but one of many issues
that brought the need for
impeachment to the public
attention in a dramatic way. The
grounds for this action divide
themselves into two classes: legal
grounds for impeachment and
serious questions about the
conduct of the administration
which have not yet emerged as
legal grounds, but have already
damaged the moral authority of
the Executive beyond the point
where he can command the
necessary respect to govern
effectively. Five of the former and
five of the latter come to mind.
Legal Grounds
Actions or decisions by the
President which, if performed by
any other man or women,
constitute a violation of federal
law are here considered legal
grounds for impeachment. At this
time, legal ground for
impeachment would seem to
include: 1. the Tom Huston Plan
which Nixon personally approved
on 25 July 1970, which included
clearance for domestic political
surveillance and espionage — and
such methods as burglary,
wiretapping, eavesdropping, mail
covers, and military spying on
civilians.
2. The President interfered in
the Ellsberg prosecution in a way
that was intended to subvert the
cause of justice; in that case, by
offering Judge Matt Byrne a
federal office while he was sitting
on a case in which the Federal
Government was the protagonist.
3. The President authorized and
maintained a private army of
undercover agents, also known as
the "plumbers," which engaged in
illegal activities to harrass and
undermine political opponents of
the President. They also broke
into the office of Daniel Ellsberg's
psychiatrist in an illegal attempt
to get evidence which would help
to convict Ellsberg.
4. Moreover, the President has
refused to spend billions of dollars
authorized by the Congress for
various domestic programs, using
the device of impoundment. The
Congressional Research Service
records that seventeen billion
dollars — ear-marked for
education, mental health,
neighborhood and youth corps,
library services, veterans aid, rural
and subsidized housing programs,
Indian education, highway funds,
and research in cancer and heart
disease — have been impounded
by the President. Hubert Marshall
suggests that in this case, too,
President Nixon is in violation of
laws duly passed by Congress. He
is not alone: as of 6 August 1973,
the Government had lost 21 of 25

lower court cases in defense of the
President's impoundment actions.
5. Finally, the President
usurped the war-making powers of
Congress by bombing Cambodia
and deliberately concealed the
bombing from the nation by
having military members of this
nation lie to the Congress, falsify
records, and then even defend
such a procedure in public for
Congressional committees.
Additional Charges
The ACLU call for
impeachment would add to these
legal grounds the charges that he
interfered with the administration
of justice by his "effort to limit
the scope" of the FBl's
investigation of Watergate, and
that he "perverted and attempted
to pervert the operation of various
Federal agencies, including the
Department of Justice and the
National Security Council, Secret
Service, State Department,
Defense Department, and the
Central Intelligence Agency, by
engaging in political surveillance
and in the falsification of
information made available to the
Congress and American people."
These charges are, I feel, prima
facie legal grounds for
impeachment at this time.
There are, in addition, at least
five matters that, with the passage
of time could develop into clear
evidence of crime on the part of
this President. 1. First, the
extraordinary amount of money
spent on "security measures" on
his private houses has still not

people not to give up the effort
begun as a result of the
outrageous disregard of the courts
over the Watergate tapes. Nixon's
admission, implicit in the handing
over of the tapes shows him, at
this time, either to be erratic in
his judgment and activities and to
be seriously out of touch with the
sentiment of the country, or it
indicates that the capitulation was
an act of cold calculation. It is not
an unfair conclusion that here is a
President who is either unable or
unwilling to reflect and represent
the wishes of the people.
The decision of the President
to adhere to Judge Sirica's
decision defers the issues of the
contents of the Watergate tapes. It
does not resolve them. For our
part, it is rather a moment of
reprieve to place the issue of the
tapes back into perspective and
consider the remaining, perhaps
more important, grounds for
impeachment.

President Nixon's capitulation
on the tapes should not lessen the
drive for his impeachment. It
remains to be seen what he
understands by this agreement; he
has a notorious history of
procrastinating and reinterpreting
his agreements, as his letter to
Elliott Richardson shows. In it
Mr. Nixon states that he
"regret(ted) the necessity of
intruding ... on the independence
that I promised you (Richardson)
with regard to Watergate when I
announced your appointment"
(New York Times 23 October
1973). Therefore, one should
probably reserve judgment on this

declaration of intention until
Nixon actually hands over the
tapes.
Nevertheless, the issue of the
tapes is but one of many issues
that brought the need for
impeachment to the public
attention in a dramatic way. The
grounds for this action divide
themselves into two classes: legal
grounds for impeachment and
serious questions about the
conduct of the administration
which have not yet emerged as
legal grounds, but have already
damaged the moral authority of
the Executive beyond the point
where he can command the
necessary respect to govern
effectively. Five of the former and
five of the latter come to mind.
Legal Grounds
Actions or decisions by the
President which, if performed by
any other man or women,
constitute a violation of federal
law are here considered legal
grounds for impeachment. At this
time, legal ground for
impeachment would seem to
include: 1. the Tom Huston Plan
which Nixon personally approved
on 25 July 1970, which included
clearance for domestic political
surveillance and espionage — and
such methods as burglary,
wiretapping, eavesdropping, mail
covers, and military spying on
civilians.
2. The President interfered in
the Ellsberg prosecution in a way
that was intended to subvert the
cause of justice; in that case, by
offering Judge Matt Byrne a
federal office while he was sitting
on a case in which the Federal
Government was the protagonist.
3. The President authorized and
maintained a private army of
undercover agents, also known as
the "plumbers," which engaged in
illegal activities to harrass and
undermine political opponents of
the President. They also broke
into the office of Daniel Ellsberg's
psychiatrist in an illegal attempt
to get evidence which would help
to convict Ellsberg.
4. Moreover, the President has
refused to spend billions of dollars
authorized by the Congress for
various domestic programs, using
the device of impoundment. The
Congressional Research Service
records that seventeen billion
dollars — ear-marked for
education, mental health,
neighborhood and youth corps,
library services, veterans aid, rural
and subsidized housing programs,
Indian education, highway funds,
and research in cancer and heart
disease — have been impounded
by the President. Hubert Marshall
suggests that in this case, too,
President Nixon is in violation of
laws duly passed by Congress. He
is not alone: as of 6 August 1973,
the Government had lost 21 of 25

lower court cases in defense of the
President's impoundment actions.
5. Finally, the President
usurped the war-making powers of
Congress by bombing Cambodia
and deliberately concealed the
bombing from the nation by
having military members of this
nation lie to the Congress, falsify
records, and then even defend
such a procedure in public for
Congressional committees.
Additional Charges
The ACLU call for
impeachment would add to these
legal grounds the charges that he
interfered with the administration
of justice by his "effort to limit
the scope" of the FBl's
investigation of Watergate, and
that he "perverted and attempted
to pervert the operation of various
Federal agencies, including the
Department of Justice and the
National Security Council, Secret
Service, State Department,
Defense Department, and the
Central Intelligence Agency, by
engaging in political surveillance
and in the falsification of
information made available to the
Congress and American people."
These charges are, I feel, prima
facie legal grounds for
impeachment at this time.
There are, in addition, at least
five matters that, with the passage
of time could develop into clear
evidence of crime on the part of
this President. 1. First, the
extraordinary amount of money
spent on "security measures" on
his private houses has still not
been satisfactorily explained.
$10,000,000 in security
arrangements seems excessive and
suspicious in the light of the fact
that the admitted amount began
at one tenth of that figure, and it
was only as the press continued its
inquiries that the various agencies
admitted more and more had been
spent. Moreover, it is possible that
the $10,000,000 figure is merely a
stopping place along the way.
2. Secondly, the financial
arrangements involved in the
acquisitions of those house has
also been the subject of inquiry,
as well, as the tax status of the
San Clemente home.
3. It has yet to be explained
why Howard Hughes gave Charles
N. "Bebe" Rebozo $100,000
which was merely held in a safe
deposit box by Rebozo for a
period of three years, and then
returned to Hughes after the
Watergate investigation began to
break. The money was ostensibly
for "campaign activities," but Mr.
Rebozo has never had any
position in the campaign
organization for Richard Nixon.
What was the purpose of that
money?
4. The House Banking
Committee is interested to know
why the Treasury Department

Joseph F. Massey

twice turned back
recommendations of Federal Bank
examiners that a bank be
chartered in Key Biscayne to
compete with a monopoly bank
there, headed by Mr. Rebozo.
Every indication is that such a
refusal by the Treasury
Department of recommendations
of the Federal Examiners is highly
unusual, if not unique.
5. On Monday, 22 October
1973, the news media reported
that the AP had come into
possession of a letter from the
dairy industry to President Nixon
promising his campaign
$2,000,000 and dated two weeks
before the President imposed
import quotes on dairy products,
quotas which were highly
favorable to the dairy industry.
Much more needs to be known
about this transaction.
Due to the apparently illegal
actions of the President, and the
serious questions of conduct that
have been raised, I would urge
people not to give up the effort
begun as a result of the
outrageous disregard of the courts
over the Watergate tapes. Nixon's
admission, implicit in the handing
over of the tapes shows him, at
this time, either to be erratic in
his judgment and activities and to
be seriously out of touch with the
sentiment of the country, or it
indicates that the capitulation was
an act of cold calculation. It is not
an unfair conclusion that here is a
President who is either unable or
unwilling to reflect and represent
the wishes of the people.
The decision of the President
to adhere to Judge Sirica's
decision defers the issues of the
contents of the Watergate tapes. It
does not resolve them. For our
part, it is rather a moment of
reprieve to place the issue of the
tapes back into perspective and
consider the remaining, perhaps
more important, grounds for
impeachment.
