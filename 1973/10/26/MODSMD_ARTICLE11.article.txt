Justice And Allies
Editor:
Mr. Evers' rationalizations of
his pro-Arab stand are surprisingly
naive. It is really futile to try to
prove, as he does, that the Israelis
were univocally guilty of acts
which led to the Palestinian
exodus. Clearly the matter is
controversial, and probably
insoluble. Can we now achieve
"justice" for the murdered Israeli
women and children one
remembers vividly in the
rotogravures of the 1920'5? Or for
the Arab families gunned down in
wild reprisal?
In this welter of violence and
counter-violence, it goes without
saying that justice should be
sought by all concerned, but
surely a man must be ignorant of
the "reasons of the heart" to base
a partisan stand on the claims of
an elusive justice alone. For the
heart always enters existential
situations of this kind. Even
Sartre, on the grounds of
long-standing friendships, denies
the unhuman purism of a position
like Evers' (his evocation, in the
Esquire interview, of a generation
of Jewish occupancy is in itself
insufficiently persuasive). It is
Polish suffering, as much as or
more than material "justice," that
moved the German borders to the
Oder-Neisse line; the suffering of
an ally.
But, of course, one is always
free to choose one's allies.
