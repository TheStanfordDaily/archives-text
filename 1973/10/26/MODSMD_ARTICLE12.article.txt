# Aid Misuse Clampdown
## 
### DENNIS CUFF 
In the wake of the state
university and college system's
clampdown on misuse of
scholarship funds, Robert Huff,
director of financial aids here, said
that although his department
hasn't had the same problems, it's
doing some checking anyway.
The state system announced
last week that students applying
for loans or financial aid will be
required, along with their parents,
to provide copies of their tax
returns with aid applications,
following disclosures that many
ineligible students at San
Francisco State University and
Sonoma State College received
aid.
Besides reviewing parents
confidential statements, the
Financial Aids Office here has
requested tax returns from
families of 25 percent of the
students on aid. Unfortunately,
Huff said, most of the returns
won't be available until later this
year due to the breakdown of an
Internal Revenue Service
computer.
The University has also
changed its application forms so
that parents of aid recipients are
now expected to inform the
school of any change in their

financial status during the school
year.
The change might effect the
student's financial aid favorably
or unfavorably. However, if the
University determines that
misrepresented or withheld
information would diminish a
student's aid, then the school
reserves the right to bill the
student's family for the amount
beyond its legitimate share.
Huff said financial aid
problems here are very different
from those of the state
universities, since Stanford has a
much smaller proportion of
students on federal grants.
However, he said he's not
ignoring what happened at the
two state schools. "Anytime
something like that happens, we
like to take a look at what we're
doing here."
Huff has also read recently
published studies at M.1.T., Tufts,
U-C San Diego and other
universities, which indicate that
parents are "pessimistic" about
reporting their yearly incomes. "I
wouldn't say they're cheating, just
pessimistic," he observed.
Huff said he expects an
increasing number of schools
around the country, as well as the
California State Scholarship

program, will soon require tax
returns.
One possible reason for the
two state school's troubles is the
high rate of turnover in their
financial aid offices, Huff
suggested. Many built-in checks in
the parents confidential statement
enable a knowledgeable person to
catch "even the ones that try to
cheat," he said.
Huff credited his staff for
avoiding problems. "We have a
pretty experienced staff, that's
doing all it can for students and
also working within the rules,
many of which are complicated
and contradictory."
