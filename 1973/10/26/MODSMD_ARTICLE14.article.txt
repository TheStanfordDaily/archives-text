# Leash Law Enforcement Indicated
## 
### 
University officials have called
on Santa Clara County authorities
to impound all dogs found
running loose on campus and to
warn dog owners that bringing
dogs, leashed or unleashed, into
campus eating areas is a
trespassing violation.
The authorities will thus
resume and intensify the dog law
enforcement which began last
winter. The Santa Clara County
leash law states that all dogs must
be on a leash no longer than six
feet long, and must be
accompanied by an owner at all
times.
According to animal control
officer Bob Borg, county dog
control officials will begin making
visits to the campus at irregular
intervals "as soon as all offenders
have had a chance to become
aware of the regulations,"
probably starting this week. Borg
said that his fellow officers will
impound all dogs captured
unleashed on campus, and issue
warnings to first offenders of the
dog-walking ban. Second
offenders will be summoned to

court on misdemeanor charges.
The dog issue first came to a
head last February, when the
University requested county
authorities to begin enforcing its
regulations. The University action
came in the face of mounting
pressure from Tresidder Memorial
Union officials, who pointed out
that dogs on the dining patios
were a violation of the state's
health code. In addition, 42
reported cases of dog bites on
campus during the preceding
two-year period moved Stanford
officials to control the canine
legions which roamed White Plaza.
This year, however, the influx
of new students has brought the
dog nuisance back, according to
TMU Financial Director Gordon
Starr. He claimed that dogs have
been a significant problem at
Tresidder this year. Starr cited
numerous cases of canine

food-snatching on the outdoor
patios and added, "You really
can't imagine how disturbing it is
to be eating breakfast outside and
to turn around only to discover
that your ham's gone." He also
noted that dogs occasionally get
into TMU food preparation areas
and cause bothersome damage.
Borg described the aesthetic
problems do|p cause: "They've
! spoiled many of the campus's
lawns by defecating on them, and
[ they sometimes interrupt classes
I with loud barking. The law library
i is a good example of an area
, marred by roaming dogs. Many of
: these actually belong to professors
i who should know better than to
i let their dogs run around all day."
i Noting that dogs have long
Â» been forbidden to live in dorms or
t fraternities, Borg concluded, "I
I think most people realize that a
! university is no place for dogp."
