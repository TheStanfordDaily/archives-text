# Shockley Gives Views To Science Academy
## 
### 
Studies of census data show a
clear relationship between family
size and income among various
ethnic groups in America, Nobel
Laureate William Shockey, a
professor here reported in a paper
prepared for delivery to the
National Academy of Sciences in
Washington last Monday.
The Russian ethnic group has
the highest median family income
(almost $14,000 per year in 1971)
and the lowest fertility rate (less
than two children born per
woman age 35-44), he said.
In contrast, blacks and
Mexican-Americans have incomes
of slightly less than $7000 per
year per family, with much higher
fertility rates (4.3 and 3.6
children born per woman 35-44,
respectively).
"A clear trend of decreasing
fertility with increasing income is
seen for the other ethnic groups
reported by the Census Bureau,
including Irish, German, English,
Italian, and Polish," Shockley
said.
"In this context it appears
most likely that the most severely
threatened individual
subpopulation in terms of adverse
effects is that of American
Negroes for which family size
increases most rapidly with falling
occupational and educational
level."
When black and white family
data are viewed by educational

level, he continued, "the income
distribution for Negroes with four
years of college falls almost
exactly upon that of whites with
four years of high school. The
same applies to Negroes with four
years of high school compared to
whites with eight years of
elementary school.
"The first conclusion that this
difference is clear evidence of the
action of prejudice is,
unfortunately, unwarranted. The
actual level of education obtained
is, as is all too well known from
reports of achievement levels in
school systems in many major
portions of the country, not
determined reliably by the
grade-status of the student but
differs typically by several years
between blacks and whites."
In addition to presenting his
paper at the NAS meeting in
Washington, Shockley plans to
appear with Prof. Arthur R.
Jensen of Berkeley and Prof. R.T.
Osborne of the University of
Georgia to discuss their work in a
public session in the Cannon
Building of the House of
Representatives Tuesday
afternoon.
Arrangements for the meeting
were made by Rep. Paul
McCloskey following the Harvard
Law Forum's decision to cancel
an invited appearance by
Shockley and CORE director Roy
Innis in Cambridge Friday, Oct.
26.

Studies of census data show a
clear relationship between family
size and income among various
ethnic groups in America, Nobel
Laureate William Shockey, a
professor here reported in a paper
prepared for delivery to the
National Academy of Sciences in
Washington last Monday.
The Russian ethnic group has
the highest median family income
(almost $14,000 per year in 1971)
and the lowest fertility rate (less
than two children born per
woman age 35-44), he said.
In contrast, blacks and
Mexican-Americans have incomes
of slightly less than $7000 per
year per family, with much higher
fertility rates (4.3 and 3.6
children born per woman 35-44,
respectively).
"A clear trend of decreasing
fertility with increasing income is
seen for the other ethnic groups
reported by the Census Bureau,
including Irish, German, English,
Italian, and Polish," Shockley
said.
"In this context it appears
most likely that the most severely
threatened individual
subpopulation in terms of adverse
effects is that of American
Negroes for which family size
increases most rapidly with falling
occupational and educational
level."
When black and white family
data are viewed by educational

level, he continued, "the income
distribution for Negroes with four
years of college falls almost
exactly upon that of whites with
four years of high school. The
same applies to Negroes with four
years of high school compared to
whites with eight years of
elementary school.
"The first conclusion that this
difference is clear evidence of the
action of prejudice is,
unfortunately, unwarranted. The
actual level of education obtained
is, as is all too well known from
reports of achievement levels in
school systems in many major
portions of the country, not
determined reliably by the
grade-status of the student but
differs typically by several years
between blacks and whites."
In addition to presenting his
paper at the NAS meeting in
Washington, Shockley plans to
appear with Prof. Arthur R.
Jensen of Berkeley and Prof. R.T.
Osborne of the University of
Georgia to discuss their work in a
public session in the Cannon
Building of the House of
Representatives Tuesday
afternoon.
Arrangements for the meeting
were made by Rep. Paul
McCloskey following the Harvard
