# Committee Organizes Students
## Farmworker Support Urged 
### BILL ROSS 
A movement to organize Stanford students
to support migrant labor unionization is
planned by the newly formed Farm Workers
Support Committee, according to Kevin
O'Grady, ASSU co-president and member of
the committee.
"We want to make the boycott of
non-union lettuce and grape products more
visible," O'Grady said. "A lot of people are
sympathetic to the plight of farm workers, so
our job is not so much to win people over as
to remind them of the boycott and instruct
them as to how they can help."
Committee members hope to organize
students in the boycott of Safeway markets,
which sell products produced by non-union
workers, O'Grady said. Also, they plan to
encourage the boycott of all lettuce, grapes
and wines from non-union sources, he said.
In addition to promoting the boycott,
committee members plan to raise money
through bake sales and the sale of pro-union
posters and buttons, according to Doug Rice,
a committee organizer.
"The funds will be spent to raise public
consciousness regarding the boycotts," Rice
said. "We hope to publish leaflets which
explain the farm worker's movement. Also,
we want to print lists of products that should

be boycotted and which name alternative
products."
Registered as a Stanford volunteer
organization, the Farm Workers Support
committee's first act was to distribute
pro-union literature at the Oct. 13 football
game. A game line-up was printed along with
an appeal to support workers in their struggle
for higher wages and better living conditions
and educational, medical and sanitary
facilities, Rice said. The leaflets were printed
at the expense of the San Jose branch of the
United Farm Workers Union, he noted.
"We hope to have students picket Safeway
stores," said Augustin Juarez, a committee
member and representative of MEChA. "A
number of Stanford students have been
picketing the stores independantly since last
January, but the committee plans to increase
student participation in the picketing
activities."
Organizers of the committee said they
don't regard anti-Safeway activities as a
secondary boycott.
"Safeway is a big buyer of wines and
grapes," Juarex emphasized. It definitely is
not a neutral party. By boycotting it, we can
put pressure on the growers to hire UFW
members."
The boycott of Safeway accompanied a

seven percent decline in its sales during the
last financial quarter, Rice said.
Organizers of the committee said they had
encoutered no opposition in their pickets of
Safeway.
"The store managers know we have a legal
right to picket because they are selling scab
grapes," Rice said. "We have had delegations of
faculty members go to Safeway stores in
groups of three and four to discuss the matter
with Safeway store managers. Some of the
managers say they support the unionization
movement, but must take orders from their
superiors at Safeway."
Even if union contracts are signed and farm
workers win improved living conditions, the
work of the committee will not be completed,
according to Jess Dominquez, one of the
committee's organizers.
"Our immediate concern doesn't extend
much beyond the boycott because we don't
expect Safeway or the growers to give in
easily," Dominques said.
"Yet if conditions changed, then our focus
would change. We would then involve
ourselves more directly in the farm laborers'
movement. We would work to eliminate the
poverty and injustice which characterizes life
among the farm workers."

ourselves more directly in the farm laborers'
movement. We would work to eliminate the
poverty and injustice which characterizes life
among the farm workers."

UFW SUPPORTERS — Doug Rice (left, with moustache), an organizer for the Farm Workers Support
Committee here, outlined possible activities to a recent meeting of the group.
A movement to organize Stanford students
to support migrant labor unionization is
planned by the newly formed Farm Workers
Support Committee, according to Kevin
O'Grady, ASSU co-president and member of
the committee.
"We want to make the boycott of
non-union lettuce and grape products more
visible," O'Grady said. "A lot of people are
sympathetic to the plight of farm workers, so
our job is not so much to win people over as
to remind them of the boycott and instruct
them as to how they can help."
Committee members hope to organize
students in the boycott of Safeway markets,
which sell products produced by non-union
workers, O'Grady said. Also, they plan to
encourage the boycott of all lettuce, grapes
and wines from non-union sources, he said.
In addition to promoting the boycott,
committee members plan to raise money
through bake sales and the sale of pro-union
posters and buttons, according to Doug Rice,
a committee organizer.
"The funds will be spent to raise public
consciousness regarding the boycotts," Rice
said. "We hope to publish leaflets which
explain the farm worker's movement. Also,
we want to print lists of products that should

be boycotted and which name alternative
products."
Registered as a Stanford volunteer
organization, the Farm Workers Support
committee's first act was to distribute
pro-union literature at the Oct. 13 football
game. A game line-up was printed along with
an appeal to support workers in their struggle
for higher wages and better living conditions
and educational, medical and sanitary
facilities, Rice said. The leaflets were printed
at the expense of the San Jose branch of the
United Farm Workers Union, he noted.
"We hope to have students picket Safeway
stores," said Augustin Juarez, a committee
member and representative of MEChA. "A
number of Stanford students have been
picketing the stores independantly since last
January, but the committee plans to increase
student participation in the picketing
activities."
Organizers of the committee said they
don't regard anti-Safeway activities as a
secondary boycott.
"Safeway is a big buyer of wines and
grapes," Juarex emphasized. It definitely is
not a neutral party. By boycotting it, we can
put pressure on the growers to hire UFW
members."
The boycott of Safeway accompanied a

seven percent decline in its sales during the
last financial quarter, Rice said.
Organizers of the committee said they had
encoutered no opposition in their pickets of
Safeway.
"The store managers know we have a legal
right to picket because they are selling scab
grapes," Rice said. "We have had delegations of
faculty members go to Safeway stores in
groups of three and four to discuss the matter
with Safeway store managers. Some of the
managers say they support the unionization
movement, but must take orders from their
superiors at Safeway."
Even if union contracts are signed and farm
workers win improved living conditions, the
work of the committee will not be completed,
according to Jess Dominquez, one of the
committee's organizers.
"Our immediate concern doesn't extend
much beyond the boycott because we don't
expect Safeway or the growers to give in
easily," Dominques said.
"Yet if conditions changed, then our focus
would change. We would then involve
ourselves more directly in the farm laborers'
movement. We would work to eliminate the
poverty and injustice which characterizes life
among the farm workers."
