# New Music Dept. Chairman
## 'I'm A Musician First' 
### MICHAEL SAFFLE 
"I consider myself a musician
and colleague first, and an
administrator second," states Dr.
Albert Cohen, the new chairman
of Stanford University's Music
Department.
Replacing Dr. W.L. Crosten,
who retired last spring after
twenty-six years at Stanford, Dr.
Cohen took up the Music
Department's reins only this
September. Formerly a professor
at the University of Michigan for
ten years, he left the chairmanship
at the State University of New
York at Buffalo to come here.
Dr. Cohen was appointed
department head after a year-long
search by a faculty and student
committee. Headed by Prof.
Leonard Ratner, the committee
considered numerous candiates
before inviting Dr. Cohen last
January.
"I was attracted to Stanford by
its programs in performance as
well as by its scholarship," he
confesses happily. "I firmly
believe that a musically balanced
department is a healthy
department. After all, music is an
aural art."
Wide Academic Interests
Known for his work in the
music of the Spanish Renaissance
and French Baroque, Dr. Cohen's
academic interests include the
development of musical
nomenclature, aesthetics, and the
history of music theory and
acoustics. He has also studied and
taught the history of music in
America.
A graduate of Juillard, Dr.
Cohen played the violin
professionally. He took his
master's and doctor's degrees in
musicology from New York
University, and did graduate study
at the Sorbonne.
The influence of science on
musical development holds a
particular fascination for him. "I
am currently investigating the
work of the early French
Academy of Sciences as it applies
to music," he sates. "The
Academy's interest in music as a
branch of mathematics and
physics, and in the structure of
musical instruments as related to
sound, contributes a fascinating
chapter to the history of ideas
during the seventeenth and

eighteenth centuries."
He admits that his interest in
science's influence on music isn't
entirely unexpected. "At an early
stage, I studied engineering and, in
fact, worked as a design-draftsman
for several years in the
transformer industry."
Suggests Areas of Study
Non-Western art music is one
of seveal areas Dr. Cohen would
like to see Stanford's music
department investigate. He would
also like to see more departmental
participation in inter-disciplinary
studies, such as university
medieval and Renaissance

programs, and humanities survey
courses.
This year Dr. Cohen is teaching
courses in Spanish Renaissance
music, a graduate seminar in
analysis, and a survey of
Romantic music for
undergraduates. As chairman, he
has charge of administrative
affairs for the department. "A
prime objective of my first year is
one of self-education," he reports,
stressing his need to familiarize
himself with Stanford and its
cultural setting.
Dr. Cohen resides with his wife
and two children on campus.

stage, I studied engineering and, in
fact, worked as a design-draftsman
for several years in the
transformer industry."
Suggests Areas of Study
Non-Western art music is one
of seveal areas Dr. Cohen would
like to see Stanford's music
department investigate. He would
also like to see more departmental
participation in inter-disciplinary
studies, such as university
medieval and Renaissance

programs, and humanities survey
courses.
This year Dr. Cohen is teaching
courses in Spanish Renaissance
music, a graduate seminar in
analysis, and a survey of
Romantic music for
undergraduates. As chairman, he
has charge of administrative
affairs for the department. "A
prime objective of my first year is
one of self-education," he reports,
stressing his need to familiarize
himself with Stanford and its
cultural setting.
Dr. Cohen resides with his wife
and two children on campus.

"I consider myself a musician
and colleague first, and an
administrator second," states Dr.
Albert Cohen, the new chairman
of Stanford University's Music
Department.
Replacing Dr. W.L. Crosten,
who retired last spring after
twenty-six years at Stanford, Dr.
Cohen took up the Music
Department's reins only this
September. Formerly a professor
at the University of Michigan for
ten years, he left the chairmanship
at the State University of New
York at Buffalo to come here.
Dr. Cohen was appointed
department head after a year-long
search by a faculty and student
committee. Headed by Prof.
Leonard Ratner, the committee
considered numerous candiates
before inviting Dr. Cohen last
January.
"I was attracted to Stanford by
its programs in performance as
well as by its scholarship," he
confesses happily. "I firmly
believe that a musically balanced
department is a healthy
department. After all, music is an
aural art."
Wide Academic Interests
Known for his work in the
music of the Spanish Renaissance
and French Baroque, Dr. Cohen's
academic interests include the
development of musical
nomenclature, aesthetics, and the
history of music theory and
acoustics. He has also studied and
taught the history of music in
America.
A graduate of Juillard, Dr.
Cohen played the violin
professionally. He took his
master's and doctor's degrees in
musicology from New York
University, and did graduate study
at the Sorbonne.
The influence of science on
musical development holds a
particular fascination for him. "I
am currently investigating the
work of the early French
Academy of Sciences as it applies
to music," he sates. "The
Academy's interest in music as a
branch of mathematics and
physics, and in the structure of
musical instruments as related to
sound, contributes a fascinating
chapter to the history of ideas
during the seventeenth and

eighteenth centuries."
He admits that his interest in
science's influence on music isn't
entirely unexpected. "At an early
stage, I studied engineering and, in
fact, worked as a design-draftsman
for several years in the
transformer industry."
