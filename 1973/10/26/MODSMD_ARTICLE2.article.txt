# Ruckleshaus Neutral Toward Impeachment
## 
### 
BERKELEY â€” Former Deputy
Atty. Gen. William Ruckelshaus told
an audience here yesterday he was
"neutral on the subject" of
impeachment of President Nixon.
The crowd of 14,000 persons at the
Hearst Greek Theater booed the
remark, which was directed toward an
"Impeach Nixon" bumper sticker on
the podium.
Rep. Jerome Waldie, D-Antioch,
Berkeley City Councilwoman Ying Lee
Kelley, former Ramparts editor
Robert Scheer, Assemblyman Ken
Meade, D-Oakland, and Berkeley Law
Prof. Paul Mishkin also addressed the
rally.
Ruckelshaus, who received a
standing ovation when he appeared,

said, "I am not a hero. I have followed
the dictates of my conscience."
However, when he asserted a few
minutes later, "I am a Republican" in
defense of his not taking a stand on
impeachment, the audience booed him
again.
Country Of Laws
Ruckelshaus called for creation of
"a new office of independent
investigation," and added, "I believe in
the primacy of laws in this country.
We are a country of laws, not rulers."
Explaining the events of last
Saturday, Ruckelshaus said he refused
to comply with Nixon's order to fire
special Watergate prosecutor Archibald
Cox because he felt the agreement
between Congress and the President
had been violated.
He said former Atty. Gen. Elliot
Richardson would not have been
confirmed by the Senate without
assurances that the special prosecutor
would be completely independent.
'Can't Continue'
Waldie, who introduced an
impeachment resolution in the House
this week, charged, "The President is
tearing America apart and we can no
longer abide his continuation in
office.... The President's moral
authority to govern has diminished to
unacceptable levels.
"The anger and outrage that
compelled the beginning of this

cleansing process will not diminish,"
he predicted. "There is no way the
President can restore confidence."
The congressman said he will
oppose the nomination of House
Minority Leader Gerald Ford to
become vice president because Ford,
according to Waldie, supported the
firing of Cox.
Weak Position
Waldie said the President was in a
very weak position to deal with other
countries during this time of
international crisis. He said he felt it
was necessary to have a strong
President.
Ruckelshaus, asked whether the
Watergate tapes might have been
tampered with, replied that Federal
Judge John Sirica "has requested
electronics engineers and will be able
to determine that."
Commenting on Nixon's plan to let
Sen. John Stennis, D-Miss., listen to
the tapes to insure that White House
summaries of them would be accurate,
Ruckelshaus said he and Richardson
both thought the plan was
"reasonable."

However, he said, he and
Richardson also approved an alternate
plan, submitted by Cox, under which
Nixon and Cox would each appoint a
representative to listen to the tapes.
Asked whether Cox was fired for
any reason other than the tapes
dispute, Ruckelshaus said, "I had no
personal knowledge it was anything
but the tapes themselves."
Cautioning against putting too
much faith in government institutions,
Ruckelshaus said, 'The greatest
successes in America were not when
the federal government had anything
to do with them but when an
individual or community got together
to do something."
