# Private Side Of Film Business Shown In Truffaut's 'La Nuit Americaine'
## 
### ED HARRRIS 
La Nuit Americaine (Day for
Night) is Francois Truffaut's
tribute to film as show business.
Outwardly it is the story of how a
rather tacky melodrama "Meet
Pamela" was made, but in reality
is an attempt to show what film is
like as a profession for all the
actors and technicians who make
their living by it.
Truffaut has stepped away
from the strict creed which
demands that the director be in
total control of his film, the God
of his artistic Creation. In La Nuit
Americaine actors are no longer
conceived of as counters for the
director's imagination or cattle to
be prodded as Hitchcock,
Truffaut's master, believed.
Rather, they are human beings in
their own right whose life
off-stage demands as much
sympathy and understanding as
their performances on-stage, and
who fail only in that they must be
larger than life and do not
understand why their personal
lives do not have the same neat
plots and well-written scripts as
they use in their films.
Truffaut's perception of
himself as a director has changed
radically since L'Enfant Sauvage.
He is no longer the solitary
scientist of human emotions,
pursuing an antiseptic, almost
clinical aesthetic vision under

ideal laboratory conditions,
attempting through sheer will and
patience to impose his intelligence
upon the blank, unwilling
substance of his subject.
Real-Life Director
If L'Enfant Sauvage presented
the director as he should be La
Nuit Americaine reveals the
director as he is: mired in
circumstances, discouraged by
accidents, limited by finances and
bound by schedules and deadlines,
finally forced to improvise and to
compromise his vision in a
constant bargaining with
contingencies. Far from being the
leader of his actors and technical
crew, he is merely the focal point
of all the pressures which
accumulate and threaten to
overwhelm and defeat the
production on the way to the
final editing.
The pace is hurried, frantic;
there is no time to linger and
explore sentiments with any lyric
fullness; events trip over one
another with the frenzy of a
Hawks screwball comedy. When
one of the actors dies in a car
crash, his death is not tragic, only
an unfortunate accident, an
inconvenience for the crew who
must now change the script and
find a double for the dead actor
(he is moumed in a press release.)
The line between public and
private bluts and finally dissolves

in the rush, and confusion and
personal emotions collide head-on
with professional necessities. At
one point Julie (Jacqueline
Bisset), the female lead in Meet
Pamela, consents to sleep with
Alphonse (Jean-Pierre Leaud), the
male lead who is in despair since
his girlfriend has left him for a
photographer.
Inevitable Complications
Julie only intends to console
him as an actor and encourage
him to continue his part in the
film, but Alphonse interprets her
action as a declaration of love and
telephones her husband to inform
him that his wife no longer loves
him. As always happens in small
groups, the word gets around and
Julie is so embarassed and
ashamed that she declares she
will give up acting.
Ferrand (Truffaunt) manages
to patch things up, reminding
everyone of their duty as actors,
but not without chiding Alphonse
for his childishness. I can't help
but wonder how much real life
intrudes into this episode. In
previous films Truffaut has always
been indulgent with the faults of
the characters Leaud has played.
Has Truffaut decided that he has
been too lenient with Leaud,
whose acting has become a stale
parody of the Nouvelle Vague
(Bertolucci saw this and exploited
it in Last Tango, and that his

protege needs a good on-camera
scolding? Has Leaud become a
film brat and is punished by being
made to look ridiculous?
Yet despite all the trials and
tribulations, La Nuit Americaine
is finally a comedy complete with
happy ending. Meet Pamela is
finished and everyone heads in
different directions, almost sad to
see it all over with.

Ferrand (Truffaunt) manages
to patch things up, reminding
everyone of their duty as actors,
but not without chiding Alphonse
for his childishness. I can't help
but wonder how much real life
intrudes into this episode. In
previous films Truffaut has always
been indulgent with the faults of
the characters Leaud has played.
Has Truffaut decided that he has
been too lenient with Leaud,
whose acting has become a stale
parody of the Nouvelle Vague
(Bertolucci saw this and exploited
it in Last Tango, and that his

protege needs a good on-camera
scolding? Has Leaud become a
film brat and is punished by being
made to look ridiculous?
Yet despite all the trials and
tribulations, La Nuit Americaine
is finally a comedy complete with
happy ending. Meet Pamela is
finished and everyone heads in
different directions, almost sad to
see it all over with.
La Nuit Americaine (Day for
Night) is Francois Truffaut's
tribute to film as show business.
Outwardly it is the story of how a
rather tacky melodrama "Meet
Pamela" was made, but in reality
is an attempt to show what film is
like as a profession for all the
actors and technicians who make
their living by it.
Truffaut has stepped away
from the strict creed which
demands that the director be in
total control of his film, the God
of his artistic Creation. In La Nuit
Americaine actors are no longer
conceived of as counters for the
director's imagination or cattle to
be prodded as Hitchcock,
Truffaut's master, believed.
Rather, they are human beings in
their own right whose life
off-stage demands as much
sympathy and understanding as
their performances on-stage, and
who fail only in that they must be
larger than life and do not
understand why their personal
lives do not have the same neat
plots and well-written scripts as
they use in their films.
Truffaut's perception of
himself as a director has changed
radically since L'Enfant Sauvage.
He is no longer the solitary
scientist of human emotions,
pursuing an antiseptic, almost
clinical aesthetic vision under

ideal laboratory conditions,
attempting through sheer will and
patience to impose his intelligence
upon the blank, unwilling
substance of his subject.
Real-Life Director
If L'Enfant Sauvage presented
the director as he should be La
Nuit Americaine reveals the
director as he is: mired in
circumstances, discouraged by
accidents, limited by finances and
bound by schedules and deadlines,
finally forced to improvise and to
compromise his vision in a
constant bargaining with
contingencies. Far from being the
leader of his actors and technical
crew, he is merely the focal point
of all the pressures which
accumulate and threaten to
overwhelm and defeat the
production on the way to the
final editing.
The pace is hurried, frantic;
there is no time to linger and
explore sentiments with any lyric
fullness; events trip over one
another with the frenzy of a
Hawks screwball comedy. When
one of the actors dies in a car
crash, his death is not tragic, only
an unfortunate accident, an
inconvenience for the crew who
must now change the script and
find a double for the dead actor
(he is moumed in a press release.)
The line between public and
private bluts and finally dissolves

in the rush, and confusion and
personal emotions collide head-on
with professional necessities. At
one point Julie (Jacqueline
Bisset), the female lead in Meet
Pamela, consents to sleep with
Alphonse (Jean-Pierre Leaud), the
male lead who is in despair since
his girlfriend has left him for a
photographer.
Inevitable Complications
Julie only intends to console
him as an actor and encourage
him to continue his part in the
film, but Alphonse interprets her
action as a declaration of love and
telephones her husband to inform
him that his wife no longer loves
him. As always happens in small
groups, the word gets around and
Julie is so embarassed and
ashamed that she declares she
will give up acting.
