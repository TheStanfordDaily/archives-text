# 'Follies' Starts Out Slow, Improves In Second Act
## 
### TERRI YAVITZ 
"I'm not gonna make an ass of
myself alone!" spouted one of the
Follies chorus girls. Well put.
The Menlo Players Guild
performed a disastrous first act of
the Broadway musical, Follies last
Saturday night. Note, I said act 1
— like a Jeckyll & Hyde
transformation, act II proved to
be a most exciting and enjoyable
experience, certainly worth the
wait.
Follies portrays the golden era
in show business, the days of the

glorious Ziegfield Follies. The plot
centered itself around two show
biz couples, Buddy & Sally and
Ben & Phyllis.
We witness the foursome's first
(and last) reunion backstage
during a Ziegfield party. In the
midst of frivolous intercourse, we
follow the four characters of
concern, as they relate their
present marital situations to each
other, then digress to events of
their past.
Catchy Tunes
Jim Bradford, portraying the
likeable, spirited husband of
character Sally Plummer, "kept
the juices flowing" by belting out
catchy tunes in the first act like
"Waiting for the Girls Upstairs."
While he was waiting for the
girls, I was waiting for the leading
man, Ben Stone, to loosen up and
begin acting with more cool. He
finally did so after the
intermission, when he
astonishingly came alive and took
control of his role.
Lynda Bergren as Phyllis was
quite talented and really improved
the aesthetics in the first half of
Follies. As soon as she stepped on
stage in her tomato red gown and
belted back to Buddy (Sally's
husband), "Waiting for the Guys
Downstairs," it was clear she
would be the redeeming factor in
act I.
Phyllis' friend, Sally, began in a
spaced-out style of acting, but
eventually pieced herself back
together again as she exploded in
a zippy song, "Don't Look at
Me."
Intermission time arrived, and
apprehension as to the success or
failure of Follies was in the air.
Real, Human Follies
Hot pink clouds and a giant
dreamy heart were placed on stage,
and the plot became more
involved as the folly of the
American Dream was described.
Hie audience relived the past of
the two couples by entering into
scenes from "Loveland."

The show soon exposed many*
real human follies: being young
and wanting to be older, being
older and desiring to be young
once again; foolishly believing
that fame and fortune would
secure happiness, then regretting
life and love, all because of never
having loved or known yourselves.
During the second act, the
actors carried out the themes
quite convincingly and with more
fluidity than before. The musical
selections became more lively,
even zany.
Jean Leslie, in the role of a
play girl, extended the show's
creativity by putting lots of pizzaz
into her number, "But I'm Here"
(in case the audience hadn't
noticed her already!).
Having seen Follies, I have
gained much appreciation for
intermissions. They can definately
be a turning point in any play, as
exampled by the Menlo Player's
opening show. Follies can be seen
the next five weekends at the
Menlo Park Civic Center.

life and love, all because of never
having loved or known yourselves.
During the second act, the
actors carried out the themes
quite convincingly and with more
fluidity than before. The musical
selections became more lively,
even zany.
Jean Leslie, in the role of a
play girl, extended the show's
creativity by putting lots of pizzaz
into her number, "But I'm Here"
(in case the audience hadn't
noticed her already!).
Having seen Follies, I have
gained much appreciation for
intermissions. They can definately
be a turning point in any play, as
exampled by the Menlo Player's
opening show. Follies can be seen
the next five weekends at the
Menlo Park Civic Center.
"I'm not gonna make an ass of
myself alone!" spouted one of the
Follies chorus girls. Well put.
The Menlo Players Guild
performed a disastrous first act of
the Broadway musical, Follies last
Saturday night. Note, I said act 1
— like a Jeckyll & Hyde
transformation, act II proved to
be a most exciting and enjoyable
experience, certainly worth the
wait.
Follies portrays the golden era
in show business, the days of the

glorious Ziegfield Follies. The plot
centered itself around two show
biz couples, Buddy & Sally and
Ben & Phyllis.
We witness the foursome's first
(and last) reunion backstage
during a Ziegfield party. In the
midst of frivolous intercourse, we
follow the four characters of
concern, as they relate their
present marital situations to each
other, then digress to events of
their past.
Catchy Tunes
Jim Bradford, portraying the
likeable, spirited husband of
character Sally Plummer, "kept
the juices flowing" by belting out
catchy tunes in the first act like
"Waiting for the Girls Upstairs."
While he was waiting for the
girls, I was waiting for the leading
man, Ben Stone, to loosen up and
begin acting with more cool. He
finally did so after the
intermission, when he
astonishingly came alive and took
control of his role.
Lynda Bergren as Phyllis was
quite talented and really improved
the aesthetics in the first half of
Follies. As soon as she stepped on
stage in her tomato red gown and
belted back to Buddy (Sally's
husband), "Waiting for the Guys
Downstairs," it was clear she
would be the redeeming factor in
act I.
Phyllis' friend, Sally, began in a
spaced-out style of acting, but
eventually pieced herself back
together again as she exploded in
a zippy song, "Don't Look at
Me."
Intermission time arrived, and
apprehension as to the success or
failure of Follies was in the air.
Real, Human Follies
Hot pink clouds and a giant
dreamy heart were placed on stage,
and the plot became more
involved as the folly of the
American Dream was described.
Hie audience relived the past of
the two couples by entering into
scenes from "Loveland."

The show soon exposed many*
real human follies: being young
and wanting to be older, being
older and desiring to be young
once again; foolishly believing
that fame and fortune would
secure happiness, then regretting
life and love, all because of never
having loved or known yourselves.
