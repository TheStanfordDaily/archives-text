# 'New Games' Tournament Explores Play Alternatives
## 
### K.C. FLYNN 
SAUSALITO — Stewart Brand,
one of Ken Kesey's merry
pranksters from Half Moon Bay,
was playing again last weekend.
Brand, editor of the Whole Earth
Catalog, was having fun with his
friends and about three thousand
other visitors to the "New Games
Tournament" in a wild, rugged

area of Marin County.
The site was an abandoned
farm surround by high hills, in a
section of the Gerbode Preserve
just beyond the Golden Gate
Bridge.
"New games," according to
Brand, are "anything you'd rather
play than old games." Last
Saturday, they ranged from

three-way chess to an immense
tug-of-war.
The games were scheduled for
the entire weekend, but rain
cancelled Sunday's events. Brand
promises "another two days next
weekend," at the same place.
Spending Catalog Royalties
The tournament is a project of
POINT, a non-profit foundation
set up by Brand to spend some of
the estimated $1.5 million in
royalties from the Last Whole
Earth Catalog, which won a

National Book Award in 1971.
About a dozen hang gliders
flew Saturday, brought by Manta
Wings of Oakland. The gliders,
about 18 feet wide, carried fliers
hanging from aluminum bars to
heights of 600 feet above the
tournament.
The fliers climbed the highest
hill, about 700 feet, and ran
straight into the wind until they
reached about 15 miles per hour.
When the sails filled, they were
carried aloft.

Brand analyzed the wind as less
than "soaring wind," that would
carry fliers aloft indefinitely. Mike
Bray of Manta had the longest
flight, about 10 minutes. He
descended with a sweeping 360"
turn that brought him down just
outside the volleyball nets.
Fog rolled in halfway through
the afternoon and obscured the
top of the hill. Some fliers braved
the fog, but became disoriented.
"When I broke out, I didn't know
where I was," said one.
