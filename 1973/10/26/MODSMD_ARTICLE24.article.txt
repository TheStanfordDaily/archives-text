# Papa John's Band Too Loud For Great American Hall
## 
### GEORGE POWELL 
SAN FRANCISCO - Papa
John Creach unveiled his current
musical position last week at the
Great American Music Hall to an
audience that included RCA
record executives and his manager
in the front row.
Any comments they must have
had about the act itself had to be
made after the music stopped,
because it was too loud and
poorly mixed to even attempt to
talk over.
Zulu, Papa John's backup
group of two guitarists, one
keyboard man, a conga player
drummer, seemed to share the
spirit of Papa John's music but

failed in execution.
This was mostly the fault of
the sound system, which was
more suitable for Winterland,
where Papa John made his first
Bay Area appearance with the
Jefferson Airplane nearly three
years ago. At that time, when the
balding, thin old man stepped on
stage with his fiddle, no one knew
what to expect.
Overnight Success
But his soaring riffs on the
violin drew that Winterland crowd
to its feet, and ever since, Papa
John has been a rock musical
success.
He has played with the
Airplane offshoot, Hot Tuna, still
appears with the Airplane, and has

released several albums on his
own.
So it was much to my surprise
that Zulu and Papa John could
put on such a poorly executed
show, with all this experience
behind them.
From the outset, Papa John
knew what was wrong, and kept
promising to "bring it down." But
the sound people could do little
with the loud and echo-prone
system, which even drowned out
Papa John's electric fiddle at the
start of his set.
Too Much Percussion
The thunderous percussion
from the drums and congas in that
small hall made easy or even
critical listening almost
impossible, so I left before the
conclusion of the first set. I hope
the sound system will be a little
more balanced in the group's
ftiture appearances.
The other group on the bill
that evening, the Stuart Little
Band, was much more in tune
with the aural possibilities of the
room, but not as dynamic as Zulu.
The four man group put down a
sound heavily influenced by
Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young,
but every composition was the
group's own.
The Stuart Little Band also had
a new wrinkle, a mime which
performed while the band played.
The whole set was interesting, but
didn't seem to really involve the
audience, which came mainly for
Papa John.

As the hang gliders hovered
overhead, Brand was organizing
"Earth Ball" on the fifty-acre site.
Two teams of about forty players
each tried to push, carry, heave,
or drag the Earth, a huge painted
rubber ball, to a goal.
Brand stood to one side with a
bull hom, coaching. "The Earth is
moving ... make sure you're in
bare feet," he barked. As the
Earth moved, dozens of people
were left on the ground.
Sorry About That, Earth
Obviously worried someone
would get hurt, Brand kept
shouting, "Keep the screaming to
a minimum!" The game was
aborted when the valve popped
out and was lost on the ground.
"Time out to repair the Earth,"
said Brand with relief.
One of the favorite new games
was "Dodo," played on a large
mat set up in the fields. Two
fifty-man teams faced each other
across a lineon the mat.
A member of one team, the
"attacker," ran across the line
saying "Dodo-dodo-dodo" on one
breath, touching as many of the
opposing team as he could, and
eliminating them. The opposing
team was allowed to grab the
attacker and hold him — usually
face-down on the mat — until he
ran out of breath. Then he was
eliminated.
Boffin g Popular
Throughout the day, at the
"Boffin g Booth," dozens of
children and adults slugged it out
with each other, venting
frustrations with styrofoam
swords.
Boffing continued until late in
the day. In the "championship,"
Brand won a fierce duel refereed
by Charles Selberg, organizer of
the boffing and fencing coach at
the University of California at
Santa Cruz.
An Army generator provided
power for the computer games,
including "Pong Doubles,"
"Spacerace," and "Gotcha."
Gotcha is a television-screen
game for two. One player chases
the other through a
constantly-changing labyrinth. "It
takes advantage of things a
computer does well," said Brand,
"things nothing else can do." He
compared Gotcha to the croquet
game in Alice's Wonderland in
which the hoops keep moving.

Three volleyball nets saw
continual use during the day.
Often, players would invent new
rules, or try new swings.
Music, Too
Music, including Banjo picking
and someone playing home-made
Tibetan bells, drifted over the site
for hours.
The Tournament organizers
supplied hundreds of frisbees,
small flutes, huge dice, and lots of
yellow, red, and blue balloons.
Three mimes dressed in bright
blue suits and top hats wandered
among the players.
The games got rougher as the
afternoon went on. Teams raced
to build human pyramids, and to
"Capture the Flag."
In "Slaughter," two teams, one
barefoot, one in socks, tried to
carry their team's ball to the
other's goal — on their knees.
Anyone pushed outside a small
circle was "dead."
A favorite trick of Slaughter
players was to gang up on an
opponent and drag or push him
outside the circle. Dozens of
people squirmed, climbed, and
wrenched their way near the balls,
pulling other players out of the
way and getting crushed in the
process.
Monster Tug-of-War
After Slaughter, Brand
produced an immense rope — a
regular hawser — about a hundred
yards long, and formed a
"LeMans" tug-of-war with a
hundred people at each end of the
rope. The winning team had to
pull the entire rope over a stream.
Many players ended up in the
stream.
Tug-of-war ended the
organized events, which included
"People Parchesi," "Monster
Monopoly," and Indian and
African folk games.
Energy Really High
"The energy was really high,"
said one tired participant.
"Everyone was getting off."
Brand promises more fun this
weekend. Tickets are $2.50
purchased at the gate, in the Fort
Cronkheit reservation outside
Sausalito. Brand said that if
Stanford students — or anyone
else — could organize a new game,
he would "do what I can to help.
If for example, somebody wanted
to stage a pie-throwing contest,
we could get the pies."

compared Gotcha to the croquet
game in Alice's Wonderland in
which the hoops keep moving.

Three volleyball nets saw
continual use during the day.
Often, players would invent new
rules, or try new swings.
Music, Too
Music, including Banjo picking
and someone playing home-made
Tibetan bells, drifted over the site
for hours.
The Tournament organizers
supplied hundreds of frisbees,
small flutes, huge dice, and lots of
yellow, red, and blue balloons.
Three mimes dressed in bright
blue suits and top hats wandered
among the players.
The games got rougher as the
afternoon went on. Teams raced
to build human pyramids, and to
"Capture the Flag."
In "Slaughter," two teams, one
barefoot, one in socks, tried to
carry their team's ball to the
other's goal — on their knees.
Anyone pushed outside a small
circle was "dead."
A favorite trick of Slaughter
players was to gang up on an
opponent and drag or push him
outside the circle. Dozens of
people squirmed, climbed, and
wrenched their way near the balls,
pulling other players out of the
way and getting crushed in the
process.
Monster Tug-of-War
After Slaughter, Brand
produced an immense rope — a
regular hawser — about a hundred
yards long, and formed a
"LeMans" tug-of-war with a
hundred people at each end of the
rope. The winning team had to
pull the entire rope over a stream.
Many players ended up in the
stream.
Tug-of-war ended the
organized events, which included
"People Parchesi," "Monster
Monopoly," and Indian and
African folk games.
Energy Really High
"The energy was really high,"
said one tired participant.
"Everyone was getting off."
Brand promises more fun this
weekend. Tickets are $2.50
purchased at the gate, in the Fort
Cronkheit reservation outside
Sausalito. Brand said that if
Stanford students — or anyone
else — could organize a new game,
he would "do what I can to help.
If for example, somebody wanted
to stage a pie-throwing contest,
we could get the pies."
SAN FRANCISCO - Papa
John Creach unveiled his current
musical position last week at the
Great American Music Hall to an
audience that included RCA
record executives and his manager
in the front row.
Any comments they must have
had about the act itself had to be
made after the music stopped,
because it was too loud and
poorly mixed to even attempt to
talk over.
Zulu, Papa John's backup
group of two guitarists, one
keyboard man, a conga player
drummer, seemed to share the
spirit of Papa John's music but

failed in execution.
This was mostly the fault of
the sound system, which was
more suitable for Winterland,
where Papa John made his first
Bay Area appearance with the
Jefferson Airplane nearly three
years ago. At that time, when the
balding, thin old man stepped on
stage with his fiddle, no one knew
what to expect.
Overnight Success
But his soaring riffs on the
violin drew that Winterland crowd
to its feet, and ever since, Papa
John has been a rock musical
success.
He has played with the
Airplane offshoot, Hot Tuna, still
appears with the Airplane, and has

released several albums on his
own.
So it was much to my surprise
that Zulu and Papa John could
put on such a poorly executed
show, with all this experience
behind them.
From the outset, Papa John
knew what was wrong, and kept
promising to "bring it down." But
the sound people could do little
with the loud and echo-prone
system, which even drowned out
Papa John's electric fiddle at the
start of his set.
Too Much Percussion
The thunderous percussion
from the drums and congas in that
small hall made easy or even
critical listening almost
impossible, so I left before the
conclusion of the first set. I hope
the sound system will be a little
more balanced in the group's
ftiture appearances.
The other group on the bill
that evening, the Stuart Little
Band, was much more in tune
with the aural possibilities of the
room, but not as dynamic as Zulu.
The four man group put down a
sound heavily influenced by
Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young,
but every composition was the
group's own.
The Stuart Little Band also had
a new wrinkle, a mime which
performed while the band played.
The whole set was interesting, but
didn't seem to really involve the
audience, which came mainly for
Papa John.

As the hang gliders hovered
overhead, Brand was organizing
"Earth Ball" on the fifty-acre site.
Two teams of about forty players
each tried to push, carry, heave,
or drag the Earth, a huge painted
rubber ball, to a goal.
Brand stood to one side with a
bull hom, coaching. "The Earth is
moving ... make sure you're in
bare feet," he barked. As the
Earth moved, dozens of people
were left on the ground.
Sorry About That, Earth
Obviously worried someone
would get hurt, Brand kept
shouting, "Keep the screaming to
a minimum!" The game was
aborted when the valve popped
out and was lost on the ground.
"Time out to repair the Earth,"
said Brand with relief.
One of the favorite new games
was "Dodo," played on a large
mat set up in the fields. Two
fifty-man teams faced each other
across a lineon the mat.
A member of one team, the
"attacker," ran across the line
saying "Dodo-dodo-dodo" on one
breath, touching as many of the
opposing team as he could, and
eliminating them. The opposing
team was allowed to grab the
attacker and hold him — usually
face-down on the mat — until he
ran out of breath. Then he was
eliminated.
Boffin g Popular
Throughout the day, at the
"Boffin g Booth," dozens of
children and adults slugged it out
with each other, venting
frustrations with styrofoam
swords.
Boffing continued until late in
the day. In the "championship,"
Brand won a fierce duel refereed
by Charles Selberg, organizer of
the boffing and fencing coach at
the University of California at
Santa Cruz.
An Army generator provided
power for the computer games,
including "Pong Doubles,"
"Spacerace," and "Gotcha."
Gotcha is a television-screen
game for two. One player chases
the other through a
constantly-changing labyrinth. "It
takes advantage of things a
computer does well," said Brand,
"things nothing else can do." He
compared Gotcha to the croquet
game in Alice's Wonderland in
which the hoops keep moving.

didn't seem to really involve the
audience, which came mainly for
Papa John.

As the hang gliders hovered
overhead, Brand was organizing
"Earth Ball" on the fifty-acre site.
Two teams of about forty players
each tried to push, carry, heave,
or drag the Earth, a huge painted
rubber ball, to a goal.
Brand stood to one side with a
bull hom, coaching. "The Earth is
moving ... make sure you're in
bare feet," he barked. As the
Earth moved, dozens of people
were left on the ground.
Sorry About That, Earth
Obviously worried someone
would get hurt, Brand kept
shouting, "Keep the screaming to
a minimum!" The game was
aborted when the valve popped
out and was lost on the ground.
"Time out to repair the Earth,"
said Brand with relief.
One of the favorite new games
was "Dodo," played on a large
mat set up in the fields. Two
fifty-man teams faced each other
across a lineon the mat.
A member of one team, the
"attacker," ran across the line
saying "Dodo-dodo-dodo" on one
breath, touching as many of the
opposing team as he could, and
eliminating them. The opposing
team was allowed to grab the
attacker and hold him — usually
face-down on the mat — until he
ran out of breath. Then he was
eliminated.
Boffin g Popular
Throughout the day, at the
"Boffin g Booth," dozens of
children and adults slugged it out
with each other, venting
frustrations with styrofoam
swords.
Boffing continued until late in
the day. In the "championship,"
Brand won a fierce duel refereed
by Charles Selberg, organizer of
the boffing and fencing coach at
the University of California at
Santa Cruz.
An Army generator provided
power for the computer games,
including "Pong Doubles,"
"Spacerace," and "Gotcha."
Gotcha is a television-screen
game for two. One player chases
the other through a
constantly-changing labyrinth. "It
takes advantage of things a
computer does well," said Brand,
"things nothing else can do." He
compared Gotcha to the croquet
game in Alice's Wonderland in
which the hoops keep moving.

Three volleyball nets saw
continual use during the day.
Often, players would invent new
rules, or try new swings.
Music, Too
Music, including Banjo picking
and someone playing home-made
Tibetan bells, drifted over the site
for hours.
The Tournament organizers
supplied hundreds of frisbees,
small flutes, huge dice, and lots of
yellow, red, and blue balloons.
Three mimes dressed in bright
blue suits and top hats wandered
among the players.
The games got rougher as the
afternoon went on. Teams raced
to build human pyramids, and to
"Capture the Flag."
In "Slaughter," two teams, one
barefoot, one in socks, tried to
carry their team's ball to the
other's goal — on their knees.
Anyone pushed outside a small
circle was "dead."
A favorite trick of Slaughter
players was to gang up on an
opponent and drag or push him
outside the circle. Dozens of
people squirmed, climbed, and
wrenched their way near the balls,
pulling other players out of the
way and getting crushed in the
process.
Monster Tug-of-War
After Slaughter, Brand
produced an immense rope — a
regular hawser — about a hundred
yards long, and formed a
"LeMans" tug-of-war with a
hundred people at each end of the
rope. The winning team had to
pull the entire rope over a stream.
Many players ended up in the
stream.
Tug-of-war ended the
organized events, which included
"People Parchesi," "Monster
Monopoly," and Indian and
African folk games.
Energy Really High
"The energy was really high,"
said one tired participant.
"Everyone was getting off."
Brand promises more fun this
weekend. Tickets are $2.50
purchased at the gate, in the Fort
Cronkheit reservation outside
Sausalito. Brand said that if
Stanford students — or anyone
else — could organize a new game,
he would "do what I can to help.
If for example, somebody wanted
to stage a pie-throwing contest,
we could get the pies."
SAN FRANCISCO - Papa
John Creach unveiled his current
musical position last week at the
Great American Music Hall to an
audience that included RCA
record executives and his manager
in the front row.
Any comments they must have
had about the act itself had to be
made after the music stopped,
because it was too loud and
poorly mixed to even attempt to
talk over.
Zulu, Papa John's backup
group of two guitarists, one
keyboard man, a conga player
drummer, seemed to share the
spirit of Papa John's music but

failed in execution.
This was mostly the fault of
the sound system, which was
more suitable for Winterland,
where Papa John made his first
Bay Area appearance with the
Jefferson Airplane nearly three
years ago. At that time, when the
balding, thin old man stepped on
stage with his fiddle, no one knew
what to expect.
Overnight Success
But his soaring riffs on the
violin drew that Winterland crowd
to its feet, and ever since, Papa
John has been a rock musical
success.
He has played with the
Airplane offshoot, Hot Tuna, still
appears with the Airplane, and has

released several albums on his
own.
So it was much to my surprise
that Zulu and Papa John could
put on such a poorly executed
show, with all this experience
behind them.
From the outset, Papa John
knew what was wrong, and kept
promising to "bring it down." But
the sound people could do little
with the loud and echo-prone
system, which even drowned out
Papa John's electric fiddle at the
start of his set.
Too Much Percussion
The thunderous percussion
from the drums and congas in that
small hall made easy or even
critical listening almost
impossible, so I left before the
conclusion of the first set. I hope
the sound system will be a little
more balanced in the group's
ftiture appearances.
The other group on the bill
that evening, the Stuart Little
Band, was much more in tune
with the aural possibilities of the
room, but not as dynamic as Zulu.
The four man group put down a
sound heavily influenced by
Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young,
but every composition was the
group's own.
The Stuart Little Band also had
a new wrinkle, a mime which
performed while the band played.
The whole set was interesting, but
didn't seem to really involve the
