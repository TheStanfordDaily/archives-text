# Harriers Host Pac-8 Rivals
## 
### PHIL HUBBARD 
Stanford's cross country squad
faces Pacific Eight rivals USC,
UCLA and California on the golf
course here tomorrow at 10 a.m.
in what promises to be one of the
best Southern Division
championships in conference
history.
The four California teams,
which have been dominated by
their northern counterparts in
recent years, seem to be coming
into their own this season. TTie
six-mile course they will be
running, the same one Cal beat
the Cards on two weeks ago, will
also be the site of the Pac-8 meet
on Nov. 10.
Running on its home course is
always an advantage to the host
school, and Stanford will need all
the help it can get if the Cardinal
harriers expect to repeat as
division champions.
Stanford won last year with a
low of 31 points. USC was second
with 53. UCLA scored only 55
last season, but is undefeated so
far in 1973. Cal, although last
with 77 in 1972, showed its
strength in downing the Cards
38-51 two weeks ago.

"No one's out of the running
this year," said Stanford coach
Marshall Clark. "All four teams
have some strong individuals. If
there has to be a favorite, Fd say
Cal is the one to pick. They
showed us how well they can
bunch up." Cal runners took
third, fifth, sixth, and eighth two
weeks ago. That kind of strength
up front is hard to beat.
Clark feels the Cards have
improved since then, though. "We
expect to give Cal a tougher time
tomorrow," he said. "The score
should be a lot closer."
A stronger Mark McConnell
could be one factor in Stanford's
favor this week. The junior from
Santa Cruz was slowed with
tendonitis a couple of weeks ago,
but according to Clark, is in better
shape now and should improve on
the 30:24 he ran against Cal.
The Cards should also be
bolstered by the return of Art
Brown. Brown sat out last week's
competition with a twisted ankle,
but is expected to run in
tomorrow's contest.
Tony Sandoval, Stanford's
newest record holder, will be
looking to better the 29:03

standard he set against the Bears.
Sandoval, though plagued by what
Clark calls "a bunch of little
'ouches,'" still has to be
considered the individual favorite
Saturday. Behind him is Jack
Bellah, who comes into this meet
in the wake of a personal best of
29:40, a mark which puts him
eighth on Stanford's all-time cross
country list.

Clark calls "a bunch of little
'ouches,'" still has to be
considered the individual favorite
Saturday. Behind him is Jack
Bellah, who comes into this meet
in the wake of a personal best of
29:40, a mark which puts him
eighth on Stanford's all-time cross
country list.
Stanford's cross country squad
faces Pacific Eight rivals USC,
UCLA and California on the golf
course here tomorrow at 10 a.m.
in what promises to be one of the
best Southern Division
championships in conference
history.
The four California teams,
which have been dominated by
their northern counterparts in
recent years, seem to be coming
into their own this season. TTie
six-mile course they will be
running, the same one Cal beat
the Cards on two weeks ago, will
also be the site of the Pac-8 meet
on Nov. 10.
Running on its home course is
always an advantage to the host
school, and Stanford will need all
the help it can get if the Cardinal
harriers expect to repeat as
division champions.
Stanford won last year with a
low of 31 points. USC was second
with 53. UCLA scored only 55
last season, but is undefeated so
far in 1973. Cal, although last
with 77 in 1972, showed its
strength in downing the Cards
38-51 two weeks ago.

"No one's out of the running
this year," said Stanford coach
Marshall Clark. "All four teams
have some strong individuals. If
there has to be a favorite, Fd say
Cal is the one to pick. They
showed us how well they can
bunch up." Cal runners took
third, fifth, sixth, and eighth two
weeks ago. That kind of strength
up front is hard to beat.
Clark feels the Cards have
improved since then, though. "We
expect to give Cal a tougher time
tomorrow," he said. "The score
should be a lot closer."
A stronger Mark McConnell
could be one factor in Stanford's
favor this week. The junior from
Santa Cruz was slowed with
tendonitis a couple of weeks ago,
but according to Clark, is in better
shape now and should improve on
the 30:24 he ran against Cal.
The Cards should also be
bolstered by the return of Art
Brown. Brown sat out last week's
competition with a twisted ankle,
but is expected to run in
tomorrow's contest.
Tony Sandoval, Stanford's
newest record holder, will be
looking to better the 29:03

standard he set against the Bears.
Sandoval, though plagued by what
Clark calls "a bunch of little
'ouches,'" still has to be
considered the individual favorite
Saturday. Behind him is Jack
Bellah, who comes into this meet
in the wake of a personal best of
29:40, a mark which puts him
