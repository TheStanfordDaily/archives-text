# Arizona Grabs Golf Lead
## 
### 
Arizona grabbed the early lead yesterday as 11 teams
completed first round play in the Stanford Women's
Invitational golf tournament at the Stanford course.
Arizona, with a 166 total (two-person teams) holds a four
stroke margin over Arizona State going into today's final
round.
Stanford was unable to participate in the team competition
because Chris Browning is sick with strep throat. The Cards'
lone individual entrant, Pat Cornett, fired a creditible 83 and is
five shots off the individual pace set by New Mexico's Alex
Reinhardt.
Barbara Vetrano of San Francisco State is second with 79
and Arizona's Paula Eger and Santa Rosa's Pam Palnieri shot
80's.
In a women's field hockey game yesterday at Stanford, the
Cards and Sacramento State battled to a 0-0 tie.
