# Cards Host Frustrated Cougars
## Mortal Opponent For WSU 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Washington State's Cougars,
anxious to face a mortal opponent
after spending the last six weeks
testing the validity of wire
services' college football polls,
invade Stanford Stadium
tomorrow for a 1:30 p.m. game
against Stanford's unpredictable
Cardinals.
Coach Jim Sweeney's WSU
team has endured a treacherous
early season schedule that has
matched the Cougars against such
national powers as Ohio State,
USC, UCLA, Arizona State and
Kansas. WSU escaped from the
fire with valuable experience and
endless compliments, but with
only one victory (against Idaho)
to show for those six weeks of
suffering.
"We've probably played the
toughest schedule in the Pac-8 —
maybe the toughest in the
country," Sweeney told the Daily.
"So even though I'm deeply
disappointed in this year so far, I
have to temper that
disappointment with realism."
Sweeney is confident that his
Cougars are mentally ready for
the second half of the season
despite the early disappointments.
"It's not easy to take a 1-5
football team and say that 'We're
at the peak of things,' or 'We're
on Cloud Nine,' but on the other
hand this team has a lot of
character. They won't fold at the
tent — they have a lot of pride."
Emotional Coach
Sweeney, a "very emotional
coach" according to Stanford
mentor Jack Christiansen, has a

lot of pride himself. "We haven't
been embarrassed by anyone, but
I want to win — not come close,"
he says.
Oddsmakers have installed the
Cougars as two-point favorites
over the Cards, a reasonable
choice despite the fact that
Stanford is 3-3 and WSU is 1-5.
When the relative performances
against one common opponent
(UCLA) are considered, WSU's
24-13 loss is certainly more
impressive than the 59-13
shellacking suffered by the Cards
two weeks ago.
The Cougar offense revolves
around the "Multiple Veer," a
triple option attack that features
quarterback Chuck Peck, fullback
Andrew Jones and tailback Ken
Grandberry. Jones and
Grandberry currently rank sixth
and seventh on the Pac-8 rushing
charts and Peck has contributed
to the WSU offense both on the
ground (91 net yards) and in the
air (45-85 for 424 yards).
The Multiple Veer has moved
the ball consistently, but WSU's
tendency to fumble in crucial
situations has hampered the
team's scoring potential. The
Cougars have handed the ball to

the opposition 10 times this year,
including costly fumbles on
UCLA's one and 20 yard lines last
week.
On defense, the Cougars "are a
bunch of swarming people who
really go to the ball," according to
Christiansen. Last year WSU
defenders sacked Card
quarterback Mike Boryla 10 times
in what Sweeney called "a great
defensive effort." Tomorrow
Sweeney plans to "put the
pressure on him again, but they'll
be working hard to pick up our
blitzes."
Stanford, after a matter-of-fact
23-14 win over Washington last
week, needs a victory to go over
the .500 mark for the first time
this year.
"We're just going to have to
play our best," Christiansen said.

Cardinal Notes: Mike Boryla is
now only 253 yards short of
overtaking John Brodie on the
Stanford career passing list.
Boryla, with 3342 yards,
currently trails Brodie (3595),
Dick Norman (3737) and Jim
Plunkett (7544).
Linebacker Gordie Riegel
heads the Cardinal defensive

charts with 58 assisted and
unassisted tackles in six games.
Pat Donovan is next with 51,
followed by Roger Stillwell with
42, Geb Church with 41 and

with 40 each.
Tomorrow's game is the 30th
meeting between Stanford and
Washington State. The Cougars,
who defeated the Cards 27-13 last
year in Spokane, hold a 16-12-1
lead in the series.

The Cougar offense revolves
around the "Multiple Veer," a
triple option attack that features
quarterback Chuck Peck, fullback
Andrew Jones and tailback Ken
Grandberry. Jones and
Grandberry currently rank sixth
and seventh on the Pac-8 rushing
charts and Peck has contributed
to the WSU offense both on the
ground (91 net yards) and in the
air (45-85 for 424 yards).
The Multiple Veer has moved
the ball consistently, but WSU's
tendency to fumble in crucial
situations has hampered the
team's scoring potential. The
Cougars have handed the ball to

the opposition 10 times this year,
including costly fumbles on
UCLA's one and 20 yard lines last
week.
On defense, the Cougars "are a
bunch of swarming people who
really go to the ball," according to
Christiansen. Last year WSU
defenders sacked Card
quarterback Mike Boryla 10 times
in what Sweeney called "a great
defensive effort." Tomorrow
Sweeney plans to "put the
pressure on him again, but they'll
be working hard to pick up our
blitzes."
Stanford, after a matter-of-fact
23-14 win over Washington last
week, needs a victory to go over
the .500 mark for the first time
this year.
"We're just going to have to
play our best," Christiansen said.

Cardinal Notes: Mike Boryla is
now only 253 yards short of
overtaking John Brodie on the
Stanford career passing list.
Boryla, with 3342 yards,
currently trails Brodie (3595),
Dick Norman (3737) and Jim
Plunkett (7544).
Linebacker Gordie Riegel
heads the Cardinal defensive

charts with 58 assisted and
unassisted tackles in six games.
Pat Donovan is next with 51,
followed by Roger Stillwell with
42, Geb Church with 41 and
Forrie Martin and Pete Hanson
with 40 each.
Tomorrow's game is the 30th
meeting between Stanford and
Washington State. The Cougars,
who defeated the Cards 27-13 last
year in Spokane, hold a 16-12-1
lead in the series.
Washington State's Cougars,
anxious to face a mortal opponent
after spending the last six weeks
testing the validity of wire
services' college football polls,
invade Stanford Stadium
tomorrow for a 1:30 p.m. game
against Stanford's unpredictable
Cardinals.
Coach Jim Sweeney's WSU
team has endured a treacherous
early season schedule that has
matched the Cougars against such
national powers as Ohio State,
USC, UCLA, Arizona State and
Kansas. WSU escaped from the
fire with valuable experience and
endless compliments, but with
only one victory (against Idaho)
to show for those six weeks of
suffering.
"We've probably played the
toughest schedule in the Pac-8 —
maybe the toughest in the
country," Sweeney told the Daily.
"So even though I'm deeply
disappointed in this year so far, I
have to temper that
disappointment with realism."
Sweeney is confident that his
Cougars are mentally ready for
the second half of the season
despite the early disappointments.
"It's not easy to take a 1-5
football team and say that 'We're
at the peak of things,' or 'We're
on Cloud Nine,' but on the other
hand this team has a lot of
character. They won't fold at the
tent — they have a lot of pride."
Emotional Coach
Sweeney, a "very emotional
coach" according to Stanford
mentor Jack Christiansen, has a

lot of pride himself. "We haven't
been embarrassed by anyone, but
I want to win — not come close,"
he says.
Oddsmakers have installed the
Cougars as two-point favorites
over the Cards, a reasonable
choice despite the fact that
Stanford is 3-3 and WSU is 1-5.
When the relative performances
against one common opponent
(UCLA) are considered, WSU's
24-13 loss is certainly more
impressive than the 59-13
shellacking suffered by the Cards
two weeks ago.
