# Congress Pursues Investigation
## The 						Mechanics Of Impeachment 
### DAVID THIEMANN News Analysis 
The nationwide clamor for
impeachment has diminished, but
grounds for action against President
Nixon may remain. The House
Judiciary Committee still plans to
investigate the impeachment question
— perhaps before it considers the vice
presidential nomination of Gerald
Ford.
The President released the nine
Watergate tapes only after feeling the
impeachment heat, like a shoplifter
who returns merchandise to the shelf
after noticing a store detective
watching. Pragmatic changes like this
do not fool shopkeepers — or
congressmen.
Without case law or precise
constitutional language to guide them,
lawyers and scholars cannot
confidently answer many procedureal
questions about impeachment, but this
outline emerges:
After congressmen introduce
impeachment resolutions or formal
"articles of impeachment," the House
will refer them to the Judiciary
Committee. The committee must
determine whether the evidence of
"treason, bribery or other high crimes
and misdemeanors" warrants
impeachment.
It may return "articles of
impeachment" alleging specific
offenses to the floor for a yes or no
vote, with a simple majority required
to impeach — or accuse — a President.
Senate Trial
If the House impeaches, the entire
Senate sits as a jury to hear the case,
with a two-thirds majority required for
conviction. The Chief Justice of the
Supreme Court presides and the House
prosecutes through an appointed
"committee of managers."
At trial the President possesses the
principal rights of a defendant in a
criminal trial, including benefit of
counsel and compulsory process to
obtain defense witnesses.
However, he probably does not
have Fifth Amendment protection
against self-incrimination, because the
Senate cannot impose a criminal
penalty. It can only remove an official
from office and bar him from future
public office.
Impeachment does not bar
subsequent ariminal prosecution or
constitute double jeopardy in addition
to possible criminal trial.
Trial For What?
Treason and bribery do not require
explanation, but no one can precisely
define "other high crimes and

misdemeanors."
Some constitutional authorities
argue that the phrase refers only to
criminal offenses. Others, like
University of Chicago Political Science
Prof. C. Hermann Pritchett, believe the
phrase covers "any misconduct which
affects the public welfare or indicates
unfitness on the part of the official."
Scholars also do not know whether
the House Judiciary Committee can
subpoena evidence to aid its
deliberations prior to impeachment.
This question may end in the
courts, which the committee must rely
on to enforce its subpoena. It becomes
critically important if the committee
tries to subpoena White House tape

recordings, memoranda or documents.
As the chance of impeachment
decreases, the importance of legal
nuances in the Watergate tapes case
grows.
District Court Judge John Sirica
will now listen to the tapes and decide
whether a "compelling necessity" of
criminal justice requires that
prosecutors and the two federal grand
juries hear all or part of them.
After Sirica rules on what tapes, if
any, the prosecution will receive,
White House attorneys apparently may
appeal, arguing the relevance of
material Sirica included.
The tapes will remain sealed until
appeals are exhausted.
