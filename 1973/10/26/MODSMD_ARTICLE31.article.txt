# Another Plunkett? — Cordova Wishes Fans Would Wait Before Talking
## 
### TIM FERGUSON 
The cardinal number 16 jersey
recalls the era of earlier, more
prosperous days on the gridirons
of TTie Farm. Sideliners note the
resemblances in physical
appearance and quarterbacking
style, and they talk. Mike Cordova
wishes they wouldn't — not yet,
at least.
"I don't like being publicized
before I've done anything," says
the 6-4, 215 pound freshman
from Seattle, Wash. Nothing, of
course, being the fact that
Cordova is playing varsity two
years before many of his peers,
and that in his one junior varsity
outing he threw for 280 yards.
But the uniform is the one Jim
Plunkett wore for three varsity

seasons on his way to the Heisman
Trophy in 1970. "It's just a
number," Cordova says."It
doesn't affect me. I don't think
about it ... I wish it [the
publicity] would wait."
Stanford observers, however,
can be excused if they get a little
anxious. After all, quite a few
college football powers were more
than a little jumpy over the
prospect of recruiting the high
school All-American. How many?
"A lot ... I wasn't counting,"
says Cordova.
Stanford won the battle, as it
does many times, because of its
prestigious academic reputation.
"As long as you're going to get a
free education," Cordova says,
"you might as well get a good

one."
The exposure from playing
major college football, the
opportunity to "throw the ball a
lot," the school's "tradition of
great quarterbacks" and the
impression of the coaches as "all
really nice guys" also influenced
Cordova.
And now that he's here,
Cordova says,"I know I made the
right choice. A lot of schools,
they say, are not what you see
when you visit them. Everything
I've seen here has been the same
as what I was shown, and that
makes me feel comfortable."
Enough so to satisfy even his
Gather, who showed reluctance
toward Stanford because "he felt
it didn't approach football like it
was important ... in too much of
an intellectual way."
Nevertheless, the schooling
part of the University was a factor
in Cordova's choosing it over
other campuses. "It's a different
kind of academics here . .. you're
competing with a very high level"
of student.
Despite popular images to the
contrary, Cordova says, Stanford
gridders do not always put the
classroom ahead of football.
"[College] Presidents put
academics first. I don't think any
football players put it first during
the season. You bring yourself to
the point where you're just going
at everything."
Football does not, however,
interfere too heavily with studies.
At Stanford, Cordova says, "When
you get done with practice, you're
free. There are no meetings at
night." So Cordova, who claims a
3.5 average in high school, does
have time to hit the books,
although he classifies reports of
his planning a physics major "a bit
much."
Jack Christiansen's staff can
claim much of the credit for
landing Cordova. "When I went to
Notre Dame," Cordova says,
"their coaches were cold and
aloof. They had their big
offices. . .. They weren't friendly
to you. Here they talked to you,
said hello to you. ..."
Of Chris himself, Cordova
judges, "He's a very fair man. If

something's bothering you, he'll
sit you down and tell you what he
thinks. He lets you know what
your situation is."
Unlike many of his fellow
freshman on the varsity, Cordova
expected to attain his present
status. "Yeah ... I kinda hoped
for it. I told them [the coaches] I
wanted to try out for varsity. I
felt physically I could handle it."
Controlling The Ball
Despite the one-sided UCLA
victory over Stanford, Cordova
says of the Bruin Wishbone and
the Cardinals passing attack:
"Both have their points and
advantages. The Wishbone can't
play catch-up. We can get ahead
real fast or come back, but we
have a hard time controlling it
[the ball]."
Even after what Cordova
regards as an overzealous build-up,
his future as a starting Stanford
quarterback is clouded by two
competitors, fellow freshman Guy
Benjamin, who will miss most if
not all of the season with an
injury, and sophomore Jerry
Waldvogel, who starred on the
frosh team last year and is red
shirting.

NUMBER 16 RETURNS—Freshman quarterback Mike Cordova,
whose physical appearance, strong throwing arm and number 16
jersey have caused many Stanford fans to compare him to Heisman
Trophy winner Jim Plunkett, unloads a pass during Stanford's junior
varsity opener against UCLA. Cordova is amazingly confident for a
freshman, but he thinks much of the publicity is premature.
