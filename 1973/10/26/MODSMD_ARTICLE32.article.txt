# Pac-8 Predictions
## 
### 
After improving his season
record to 18-3-1 with a perfect
4-0 performance last weekend,
the Daily's prognosticator is
anxious to tackle the most
interesting Pacific Eight
weekend to date.
League leader USC travels
to South Bend, Ind. for a
nationally televised encounter
against Notre Dame. The
Trojans, although lethargic in
their first few outings, have
taken advantage of explosive
performers Anthony Davis,
Lynn Swann and Pat Haden to
reverse their offensive fortunes,
tallying 77 points in their last
two games Playing under the
shadow of the Golden Dome
may be awe-inspiring, but USC
will still win a dose one from
the Fighting Irish.
In Portland, Oregon State
will have to fight to keep
Arizona State's score under
100. The battle may be futile.
UCLA hosts California,
whose coach Mike White seems
to have trouble deciding
whether his Bears are a running
team or a passing team, an
offensive team or a defensive
team or whether Vince
Ferragamo or Steve Bartkowski

holds the key to Cat success.
AH of those problems won't
even matter Saturday. The
Bruin Wishbone should destroy
the Bears.
Washington and Oregon will
match 1-5 records in a battle of
losers in Eugene. The Ducks
have league leading rusher Don
Reynolds and tend to make
fewer mistakes, though, so the
Daily picks Oregon.
Here at Stanford, the Cards
may have trouble con taining a
hungry Washington State team
that has won only once in six
outings The Cougars are
unquestionably solid, despite
the losses, however (all five
came against top 20 teams),
and will be looking forward to
their first game against a
mortal opponent in quite a
while. WSU should win, but
not before the Stanford
Stadium crowd witnesses the
most exciting Cardinal game of
the year.
