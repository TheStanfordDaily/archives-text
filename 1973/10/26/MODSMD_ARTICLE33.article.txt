# Cards Face Two Foes
## Hooters Seek Weekend Wins 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Stanford's soccer team takes its 5-4 record into
two games this weekend against opponents which
Coach Fred Priddle said "shouldn't be very much
trouble."
Tomorrow, the Cards travel to Monterey to take
on the Naval Post Graduate School in a 2 p.m.
contest. Sunday, Cal State â€” Humboldt is the
opposition at 3 p.m. The game, originally scheduled
for this afternoon, will be played at Harry Maloney
Field, Stanford's home surface.
Priddle was quite confident the Cards will have
an easy time this weekend, hoping they can shake
off a 2-1 loss at Santa Clara Wednesday night.
"We took more shots than they did," said
Priddle, but he added that little mistakes made the
difference.
After playing to a scoreless tie in the first half,
the teams traded goals in the first 25 minutes of the
second. Bobby Geiger put in his fifth score of the
season early in the half, for a temporary Cardinal
lead, but Santa Clara came back midway through

the period to knot the score.
Then with 10 minutes left in the game, a Santa
Clara player was awarded a penalty shot for being
fouled near the goal. Goalie Walt Harris managed to
get a hand on the ball, but couldn't deflect it
enough to keep it from going into the net.
The 2-1 defeat marked the sixth time in nine
games that the Cards had been held to only one
score. Fortunately, three of the one-goal
performances held up for shutout victories.
Priddle believes the offense should improve
during the remaining eight games this season, citing
the fact that Ricky Caldwell was back in healthy
condition.
Caldwell, who scored his first goal of the season
last weekend against Menlo college, played about
half of the Santa Clara game, and provided added
offensive punch according to Priddle.
Stanford's junior varsity topped the Santa Clara
JV's 2-1 in a preliminary game Wednesday. John
Gross had both Card scores in the second half to
overcome a 1-0 deficit.
