# Off-Duty Referee Observes Cardinal Water Polo Action
## 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Referees are usually faceless
individuals who appear each
Saturday at the sight of some
game only to disappear until the
next contest, so the stereotype
goes.
That's the way it is in many
sports, but it's not always true
with water polo. Grant Giske has
a face and a personality. He
officiates high school and junior
college water polo matches in
addition to working some of
Stanford's preseason practice
games.
Giske, a 1963 Stanford
alumnus who played water polo
on the 1961 team, has become a
fixture at poolside at Stanford's

water polo games, watching the
actioi every week as they 1973
Cardii lis try to play their way
into t) NCAA tournament.
Th» computer consultant has
observ i many changes on Leland
Stanfo i's Farm since he left 10
years a 1 o.
F rsonal Relationships
"I r nember when a secretary
would ' alk all over the campus if
it wou i benefit a student,"
Griske said. Today I can see the
change. Stanford has many more
professional administrators, with a
resulting loss to personal
relationships."
Griske has also seen this change
in the Department of Athletics. "I
used to run a swimming program,
and occasionally I would go to
Chuck Taylor [Stanford's former
Athletic Director] and ask for the
use of the pools. He would let me
use them provided I supervised
the activity. This summer I
wanted to run a summer league
for water polo and I was turned
down.
"This program would have
helped the team since it would
have given the players the chance
to play together. Cal's team has
the same type of program and
look what they've done. The way
it is now the team starts practicing
in September and it's October
before they learn each others
names."
Doesn't Ref Card Games
Griske doesn't referee official
Stanford contests because he is a
Stanford grad and the Northern
California Acquatic Association
frowns on an alumnus of a school
officiating his own school's
contests.
He doesn't criticize other

referees while they're on the job,
but he has complained about the
tendency of water polo officials
to call defense fouls, overlooking
jnany offensive infractions.
As far as this year's Stanford
team is concerned, Griske has
some definite ideas.
This years team at first worked
on moving the ball instead of
holding it and pump-faking
shots," he said. "Cal's team is one
of the best at doing this. The ball
is always moving and they don't
telegraph their passes. That's why
Cal is number one. We've also got
to do this more consistently."
That's the opinion of Grant
Griske, who's not just another

Cal is number one. We've also got
to do this more consistently."
That's the opinion of Grant
Griske, who's not just another
faceless personality wearing a
striped shirt.
Referees are usually faceless
individuals who appear each
Saturday at the sight of some
game only to disappear until the
next contest, so the stereotype
goes.
That's the way it is in many
sports, but it's not always true
with water polo. Grant Giske has
a face and a personality. He
officiates high school and junior
college water polo matches in
addition to working some of
Stanford's preseason practice
games.
Giske, a 1963 Stanford
alumnus who played water polo
on the 1961 team, has become a
fixture at poolside at Stanford's

water polo games, watching the
actioi every week as they 1973
Cardii lis try to play their way
into t) NCAA tournament.
Th» computer consultant has
observ i many changes on Leland
Stanfo i's Farm since he left 10
years a 1 o.
F rsonal Relationships
"I r nember when a secretary
would ' alk all over the campus if
it wou i benefit a student,"
Griske said. Today I can see the
change. Stanford has many more
professional administrators, with a
resulting loss to personal
relationships."
Griske has also seen this change
in the Department of Athletics. "I
used to run a swimming program,
and occasionally I would go to
Chuck Taylor [Stanford's former
Athletic Director] and ask for the
use of the pools. He would let me
use them provided I supervised
the activity. This summer I
wanted to run a summer league
for water polo and I was turned
down.
"This program would have
helped the team since it would
have given the players the chance
to play together. Cal's team has
the same type of program and
look what they've done. The way
it is now the team starts practicing
in September and it's October
before they learn each others
names."
Doesn't Ref Card Games
Griske doesn't referee official
Stanford contests because he is a
Stanford grad and the Northern
California Acquatic Association
frowns on an alumnus of a school
officiating his own school's
contests.
He doesn't criticize other

referees while they're on the job,
but he has complained about the
tendency of water polo officials
to call defense fouls, overlooking
jnany offensive infractions.
As far as this year's Stanford
team is concerned, Griske has
some definite ideas.
This years team at first worked
on moving the ball instead of
holding it and pump-faking
shots," he said. "Cal's team is one
of the best at doing this. The ball
is always moving and they don't
telegraph their passes. That's why
Cal is number one. We've also got
to do this more consistently."
