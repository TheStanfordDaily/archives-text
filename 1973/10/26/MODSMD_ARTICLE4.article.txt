# Liberated Sex Life Shown On Campus
## 
### CLAIRE SPIEGEL 
Campus sex has shocked some and
thrilled others. Psychiatrist Warren
Miller has conducted a survey to turn
up the hard-hitting facts about what's
really going on.
Almost one-third of this year's
senior classmen answered a 12-page
questionnaire when they entered as
freshmen which probed their personal
experience, morals and knowledge
about sex: Do you approve of having
sex with a casual acquaintance? Do
you rely upon the rhythm method?
Do you engage in oral sex?
Masturbation?
From the responses, Miller has
calculated the pregnancy rate,
correlated sexual behavior with
students' living quarters and compared
women's sexual experiences with
men's.
He conducted the first survey in the
fall of 1970, circulated a follow-up
questionnaire that spring, and plans to
take another reading of the same
students next month to see if their
attitudes have changed after three
years of campus living.
The information he gathered from
the freshman class of 1970-71 also
applies to subsequent freshmen classes,
Miller says.
Ten Year Change
"You'd notice significant changes
in this only over a longer period, like a
decade," he said.
According to his survey of
freshmen in 1970, more women (35
percent) than men (29 percent) were
sexually active in high school. More
women than men continued or began
to have sex, more often, with more

partners and with more pleasure
during the freshman year.
While the number of sexually active
women climbed to 41 percent, the
number of men having sex during their
freshman year dropped 2 percent.
Eighty-eight percent of the women
rated their experiences as giving
"moderate to great pleasure"
compared to 77 percent of the men.
Miller reports that eight percent of
the sexually active women became
pregnant during their freshman year.

"I think the fact that almost half
the men and one-third of the women
acknowledge not using contraceptives
all the time indicates that the
freshmen are not practicing
contraception carefully. I'm quite
concerned that in a period of six
months, there should be an alarming
eight percent pregnancy rate," Miller
said.
Almost one-quarter of the students
surveyed thought withdrawal was an
adequate contraceptive, and 30

percent said rhythm was a good
auxiliary method.
One-quarter of the freshmen
women embarked upon long-term
sexual relationships. Of those, only
two-thirds indicated they were using
contraceptives all the time.
"This percentage is high compared
with high school students, but low
compared to married couples not
wanting to have children," Miller said.
He pointed out that most women
who became pregnant during their
freshman year had been sexually active
in high school, had relied upon the
rhythm method then, and had
continued to depend upon it here.
Abstinence
If no form of contraception were
available, roughly half the women and
three-fourths of the men said they
would probably find it too difficult to
abstain from intercourse.
Sixty percent of the women felt
that females "semi-consiously" want
to become pregnant despite using
contraceptives; 34 percent of the men
felt they might want to impregnante
their partners. Twenty-eight percent of
the students were anxious to establish
their fertility.
Miller has correlated sexual activity
with dorms where the freshmen lived.
Dorm life in no way affected the sex
life of freshman males. On the other
hand, freshman women were more
likely to have sex if they lived in coed
dorms. Only three percent, however,
engaged in sex with multiple partners.
Of the sexually active girls living in
single-sex dorms, 25 percent engaged
in intercourse with more than three

CAMPUS ACTIVISM —Warren Miller, a psychiatrist who conducted a sex survey
on this year's seniors when they were freshmen, found women had more active
sex lives as freshmen than men, and overall campus promiscuity increased.
