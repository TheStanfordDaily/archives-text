# Women Enter Swim Relays
## 
### 
Early tomorrow morning, the
women's varsity swim team will
board a bus heading for Cal State
Hay ward and the Northern
California Intercollegiate Athletic
Conference (NCIAC) Relays.
Stanford will be one of 12
Northern Cah colleges
participating in the all-day event.
Contrary â€¢ to the State
Championships held on Dec. 1,
the annual NCIAC Relays are
tension-free races, the results of
which have little or no bearing on
the team's season performance.
The meet will consist of 12
events, including 100 and 200
yard backstroke, freestyle,
butterfly and breaststroke relays,
and 100, 200 and 400 medley
relays.
Stanford coach Betsy Weeks
said that her team should
probably be considered the
favorite in the event, but that
Sacramento State and UC-Davis
will provide tough competition
for the Cards.
In Stanford's only other
swimming competition this year,
the Cards trimphed over San Jose
State and San Francisco State.
Three Stanford records were
established in that meet, as Vicki
Hayes swam the 100 yard
breaststroke in 1:15.4, the 400
yard medley relay team of Mei
Ong, Hayes, Sue Trupin and
Annette Leuschel recorded a
4:32.7 clocking and the 400
freestyle relay team of Jackie
Brink, Becky Burchell, Diane
Dillon and Kathy Heinze covered
the distance in 4:14.9.
