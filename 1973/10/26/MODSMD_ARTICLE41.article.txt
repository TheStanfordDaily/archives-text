Price Control Lifted
WASHINGTON — The government lifted price controls
yesterday from the fertilizer industry, a move officials
said was necessary to expand food production next year.
The fertilizer industry is the first major field from
which controls have been lifted since the Phase 4
anti-inflation program began in August.
But John T. Dunlop, director of the Cost of Living
Council, said that although controls may be removed from
some industries, he favors continuing the wage-price
control program into 1974.
Dunlop said the decontrol of the fertilizer industry
including mo6t of its wages, would result in substantial
increases in the price of fertilizer, but increased food
production could bring about lower food prices.
The government also exempted nutrient materials used
in the production of fertilizer and explosives and lifted
controls on the sale of ammonia, nitrogen, urea,
phosphate and potash used in making plastics, synthetic
fibers, animal feeds and other products.
The fertilizer industry, supported by the Agriculture
Department, had urged decontrol, saying a fertilizer
shortage next year could reduce food production.
Ford Faces Strike By UAW
DETROIT — Bargainers for Ford and the United Auto
Workers worked into the night Thursday with only the
issue of voluntary overtime reportedly blocking a contract
for 185,000 workers.
A source at Local 600, which has 34,000 members in
the Detroit area, said Ford put a new offer on the table
Thursday.
It was unacceptable only in the area of voluntary
overtime, the source said.
The source did not say how the other key issue of
retirement after 25 years with full pension benefits for
9000 foundry workers had been resolved.
UAW President Leonard Woodcock sent a telegram to
all Ford locals telling workers to stay on the job if there is
a national agreement Friday morning, regardless of
whether local disputes have been settled.
Fighting Increases In Vietnam
PHNOM PENH — North Vietnamese and Viet Cong
troops have crossed from Cambodia into South Vietnam,
massing for possible attacks in the Mekong Delta and
Saigon regions, Western diplomatic sources said yesterday.
The movement, involving four divisions, has been
taking place for the last few weeks and may have a
relation to the stepped-up level of fighting in Vietnam, the
sources in the Cambodian capital said.

Strength of a North Vietnamese division is estimated at
about 6000 to 7000 men.
In South Vietnam, military sources reported that
Communist-led North Vietnamese troops overran a
government base 12 miles west of Pleiku Tuesday. It was
the second large government camp near Pleiku to be
captured in a month.
The sources identified the base as Plei Blang and said it
was assaulted by an estimated 2000 North Vietnamese
troops, backed by tanks and heavy artillery. Intelligence
sources estimate 15,000 to 20,000 North Vietnamese
troops are in the area west of Pleiku.
Major Oil Impact Foretold
NEW YORK — The Arab oil cutback will have a serious
impact on the United States, and it will be felt within the
next few weeks, a major U.S. oil company spokesman said
yesterday.
The cutbacks announced so far by Middle East and
North African countries as a result of the Arab-Israeli war
mean their crude-oil production will be reduced by 4.7
million barrels a day during the rest of October and during
November, the spokesman who asked not to be identified,
said.
While the United States receives only 4 percent of its
crude oil and products from the Middle East, according
to federal figures, the spokesman said one should take
into account the impact of the stringent Arab embargo on
crude oil shipments to offshore refineries outside the
United States that traditionally supply the American
market.
Food Prices Decline Sharply
WASHINGTON — The annual retail cost of a market
basket of farm-produced food declined $24 in September,
the sharpest drop in 17 years, according to government
figures released yesterday.
The price decline, the first of the year, would have
been much greater if middlemen had passed along all the
squeeze absorbed by farmers, the figures indicated.
As computed by the Agriculture Department, the cost
of an entire year's food supply for a theoretical household
of 3.2 persons was $1629 in September, down 1.5 percent
from the record of $1653 in August.
Sunny Afternoons
Late night and morning patchy fog but sunny
afternoons through tomorrow. Lows tonight in the low
40s to low 50s. Highs days in the mid 60s to upper 70s.
North to northwest winds 10 to 20 mph afternoons.
