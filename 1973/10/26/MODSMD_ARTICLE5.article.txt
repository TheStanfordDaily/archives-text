# Faculty Senate Heart Report
## Financial Aid System Studied 
### DIANE NORBURG 
The Faculty Senate yesterday
focused on a report from Robert Huff,
director of the Office of Financial
Aids, which outlined the university's
policies for allocating scholarships,
grants, loans and student employment.
Huff said that approximately 3300
undergraduate and 1600 graduate
students are receiving some type of
financial aid during the 1973-74
school year. The basis for fund
allocation is the student's financial
need, which Huff said is most
effectively determined through the use
of the College Scholarship Service.
Total student expenses for this year
were computed to be $5160. The
scholarship service operates under the
assumption that a family of moderate
income would spend $1100 in nine
months for a student living at home.
The expected contribution from the
family is computed with this in mind,
Huff stated.
Fund Advantages
In comparison to other private
universities with comparable costs,
Huff said that Stanford is in a good
position to offer financial aid. Huff
named the California State
scholarships and a $10.5 million
revolving fund built up in the National
Direct Student Loan Program as two
principal advantages.
Financial aids this year were
distributed with 76 percent in
scholarships and grants (amounting to
$6.7 million); 16.5 percent in
long-term loans ($3.6 million), and 7.5
percent in student employment
($800,000).
The Senate also accepted the
annual report from the Committee on
Undergraduate Admissions and

Financial Aid, presented by Biology
Prof. Paul B. Green, chairman. Green
expressed confidence in the policies of
Dean of Admissions Fred Hargadon.
Green called the admissions policy
a "balance of hurts done rationally"
and gave approval to "the funneling of
30,000 to 40,000 inquiries into 1500
freshmen."
Some Preferences
He said the committee found no
evidence of political or sexual
discrimination, however definite
admission "preferences" were
revealed.
Preferential treatment is apparently
given to faculty-staff children and to
athletes, Green said, and that a
prospective student's indicated major

may "tip the scales in his favor."
Green said that enrollment in
engineering and in the classics
departments are down now, therefore
the admissions policy is in favor of
candidates who express interest in
those fields.
The only major action taken by the
Senate was the acceptance of a policy
statement on leaves of absence taken
by graduate students, presented by
Associate Dean of Graduate Studies J.
Merrill Carlsmith.
Acceptance of the statement means
that written confirmation of a leave by
the chairman of the department or the
professional school dean must be
presented to the student and to the
Dean of Graduate Studies. The new
policy requires that the student take
responsibility for notifying of the
leave, which may be granted for
academic or personal reasons.
No Action
Physics Prof. J. Dirk Walecka,
Senate Chairman, announced that the
Senate Steering Committee decided
not to present the Stanford Judicial
Council proposal from the Committee
of Fifteen for Senate consideration.
Walecka said that the steering
committee felt the student veto of the
proposal made consideration
inappropriate since the proposal would
have to be approved by both the
student body and the Senate to take
