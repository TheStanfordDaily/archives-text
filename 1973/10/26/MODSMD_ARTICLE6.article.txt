# New Group Pushes Classes For Women
## 
### JOAN HINMAN 
The Center for Research on Women
(CROW) met yesterday at Tresidder
Memorial Union to organize what
ASSU Vice President and CROW
steering committee member Beth
Garfield describes as "an umbrella
group of all the women's caucuses in
the different departments."
About 30 undergraduate, graduate
and faculty women discussed plans for
the newly-formed group which hopes
to establish a departmental evaluation
program, a speakers program and
eventually a resource center and
fellows program.
Steering committee member Sue

Heck explained that CROW represents
"women students who have realized
the lack of a women's studies program
at Stanford." However, Garfield and
Heck both stressed that CROW is not
designed as a women's studies
department.
"Our feeling was that we'd like to
be part of the mainstream rather than
separate and apart," commented Heck.
Garfield compared CROW's program
to the existing chicano fellows
program.
Steering Committee
Another member of the steering
committee held open the possibility
that CROW, if successful, might lead
to a women's studies major. "Perhaps
it would be something we could move
toward," stated Cindy Davis.
At present CROW is being directed
by an informal steering committee and
operating out of an office in the Old
Firehouse. Future plans include
formation of a policy board consisting
of an undergraduate student, a
graduate student, a faculty member, a
staff member and one other person
neither teaching at nor attending
Stanford.
Facilities will include a staffed
office and resource center, provided
under the $40,000 program budget.
Heck stated that CROW is "applying
currently for support within the
University, and we have some leads as
to where to go for help outside the
University."
Women's Studies?
"One of the things we feel we have
going for us is the fact that we are not
trying to set up a women's studies
department, but trying to work within
existing departments and programs,"
explained Heck. "People like Carnegie
are interested in proposals like this."
One of CROW's first activities will
be the coordination of a speakers
program similar to one held last spring.
CROW will also serve as a coordinating
organization for persons doing
research on women who previously
have had no means of contacting other
researchers. CROW's research center
will maintain reference lists and
collections of unpublished papers and
periodicals for use by researchers.
CROW plans to have representatives
in each University department who
will investigate course offerings in an
attempt to discover which existing
courses and departments discuss
women. In addition, graduate
admission policies on women will be
examined.

committee held open the possibility
that CROW, if successful, might lead
to a women's studies major. "Perhaps
it would be something we could move
toward," stated Cindy Davis.
At present CROW is being directed
by an informal steering committee and
operating out of an office in the Old
Firehouse. Future plans include
formation of a policy board consisting
of an undergraduate student, a
graduate student, a faculty member, a
staff member and one other person
neither teaching at nor attending
Stanford.
Facilities will include a staffed
office and resource center, provided
under the $40,000 program budget.
Heck stated that CROW is "applying
currently for support within the
University, and we have some leads as
to where to go for help outside the
University."
Women's Studies?
"One of the things we feel we have
going for us is the fact that we are not
trying to set up a women's studies
department, but trying to work within
existing departments and programs,"
explained Heck. "People like Carnegie
are interested in proposals like this."
One of CROW's first activities will
be the coordination of a speakers
program similar to one held last spring.
CROW will also serve as a coordinating
organization for persons doing
research on women who previously
have had no means of contacting other
researchers. CROW's research center
will maintain reference lists and
collections of unpublished papers and
periodicals for use by researchers.
CROW plans to have representatives
in each University department who
will investigate course offerings in an
attempt to discover which existing
courses and departments discuss
women. In addition, graduate
admission policies on women will be
examined.
The Center for Research on Women
(CROW) met yesterday at Tresidder
Memorial Union to organize what
ASSU Vice President and CROW
steering committee member Beth
Garfield describes as "an umbrella
group of all the women's caucuses in
the different departments."
About 30 undergraduate, graduate
and faculty women discussed plans for
the newly-formed group which hopes
to establish a departmental evaluation
program, a speakers program and
eventually a resource center and
fellows program.
Steering committee member Sue

Heck explained that CROW represents
"women students who have realized
the lack of a women's studies program
at Stanford." However, Garfield and
Heck both stressed that CROW is not
designed as a women's studies
department.
"Our feeling was that we'd like to
be part of the mainstream rather than
separate and apart," commented Heck.
Garfield compared CROW's program
to the existing chicano fellows
program.
