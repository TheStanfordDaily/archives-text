# Gubernatorial Candidate
## Alioto: Legal But Not Clean 
### 
We all get headaches, right?
This weekend the migraine was Nixon firing
Ruckelshaus for not firing Cox. It was Nixon
forcing Richardson to resign for not firing Cox. It
was Nixon getting Robert Bork, a red-bearded Yale
law professor who's been with the Justice
Department team for a few weeks, to fire Cox. It
was Cox getting fired. Plus, it was a small reading on
Berkeley's seismograph. ...
But for me, it didn't begin there. Last week I
found myself endorsing a candidate who looked like
a good perker in California politics because, well, he
didn't look too crooked.
He's been to court twice in the past several years,
cleared on both accounts. Sooooooo, if I judge him
by current Watergate standards — assuming that the
good politician is the one with no convictions — he
looks good.
But wait! Not every politician gets a chance to
establish his probity in court. It's not fair. Some
have never even been accused! It only seems right to
say the ideal politician is the one who's been
indicted, brought to trial, and found not guilty,
because we know he's clean. Right?
Clean Candidate
San Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto announced
his candidacy for the California gubernatorial race a
couple weeks ago. I decided I'd probably vote for
him. First, he's a Democrat. Secondly, he's, well,
clean.
His first trial came up in early '70 when Alioto
was charged with illegal fee splitting in Washington
State shenanigans. Trial Two stemmed from bribery
charges connected with said shenanigans. But let me
back up.. ..
Electrical contractors were caught and charged
with bilking the public by monopoly price fixing in
the early '60s. Washington's Attorney General hired
Joe Alioto, one of the top anti-trust lawyers in the
country, to try the case, telling Joe the ceiling on
his fees would be 15 percent of the settlement or a
maximum of $1 million.(It first seemed a little
steep to me, but then I remembered a man must eat,
right?)
Fee Splitting
Anyway, in mid-trial it was learned that 15
percent could total well over $1 million, so secretly
the Attorney General lifted the ceiling on Joe's
retainer. Alioto ended up with $2.3 million and gave
$800,000 of the bundle to (guess who?) the
Attorney General and his colleagues who had given
ancillary assistance to Joe during the trial. Enter the
government charging illegal fee-splitting and

Mike Phillipa

deception....
In the first test of cleanliness there were two
issues involved. First, that the fee-splitting
represented a conflict of interest since the Attorney
General was an employee of the state. Secondly,
that lifting the ceiling secretly was, errrr, at the very
least unethical, and at the very most illegal.
Well that's nowhere, man, because Alioto et al.
can prove they've broken no laws. They document
that a lawyer for the state had been notified that
the ceiling was lifted. Scotch that charge.
Plus in Washington State there was not one law
that could put the bee to Alioto. Absolutely
nothing. Case dismissed.
Another Trial
Trial Two is going to be even quicker. Alioto is
charged with bribery of public officials since
Federal officials interpret the $800,000 largess to
the Attorney General as a bribe — in return for
lifting the ceiling. Federal judges ruled in favor of
Alioto, without even having to hear his defense, the
case of the state was that weak. Dismissed.
Holy Haldeman! This guy looks good. No
convictions though he's been grilled and slurred
twice. Put on the hibache for "two ridiculous, silly,
unsubstantial charges." It was a "contrived case, a
14 carat fake," Alioto claimed.
C'mon Joe, upping your pay when you found
you could get more eggs in the basket! OK, OK, it's
LEGAL. But if you'll pardon my soft approach, it
seems unfair. No, I take that back. It wasn't unfair
— it was thought-provoking.
Still Innocent
A man is innocent until proven guilty, right? And
you were never proven guilty. But in my opinion a
political leader should never get himself into a fix to
test that legal maxim. But of course I'm just
old-fashioned, pre-Watergate logic .. . now don't
you pay no attention to me, y'heah?
It's nothing personal at all and I surely don't
mean to single you out. It's just that San Francisco
is nearer than Washington.
In spite of everything, Joe, I would probably
vote for you because, and I say this sincerely,
because I think you're a much better man than
most, infinitely better than the small collection of
Kukla, Fran, and Ollies who are overstepping their
rights in Washington. Your political record shows
you've done some very fine and humanitarian
things.
It's just that you're not, well, all clean.

steep to me, but then I remembered a man must eat,
right?)
Fee Splitting
Anyway, in mid-trial it was learned that 15
percent could total well over $1 million, so secretly
the Attorney General lifted the ceiling on Joe's
retainer. Alioto ended up with $2.3 million and gave
$800,000 of the bundle to (guess who?) the
Attorney General and his colleagues who had given
ancillary assistance to Joe during the trial. Enter the
government charging illegal fee-splitting and

Mike Phillipa

deception....
In the first test of cleanliness there were two
issues involved. First, that the fee-splitting
represented a conflict of interest since the Attorney
General was an employee of the state. Secondly,
that lifting the ceiling secretly was, errrr, at the very
least unethical, and at the very most illegal.
Well that's nowhere, man, because Alioto et al.
can prove they've broken no laws. They document
that a lawyer for the state had been notified that
the ceiling was lifted. Scotch that charge.
Plus in Washington State there was not one law
that could put the bee to Alioto. Absolutely
nothing. Case dismissed.
Another Trial
Trial Two is going to be even quicker. Alioto is
charged with bribery of public officials since
Federal officials interpret the $800,000 largess to
the Attorney General as a bribe — in return for
lifting the ceiling. Federal judges ruled in favor of
Alioto, without even having to hear his defense, the
case of the state was that weak. Dismissed.
Holy Haldeman! This guy looks good. No
convictions though he's been grilled and slurred
twice. Put on the hibache for "two ridiculous, silly,
unsubstantial charges." It was a "contrived case, a
14 carat fake," Alioto claimed.
C'mon Joe, upping your pay when you found
you could get more eggs in the basket! OK, OK, it's
LEGAL. But if you'll pardon my soft approach, it
seems unfair. No, I take that back. It wasn't unfair
— it was thought-provoking.
Still Innocent
A man is innocent until proven guilty, right? And
you were never proven guilty. But in my opinion a
political leader should never get himself into a fix to
test that legal maxim. But of course I'm just
old-fashioned, pre-Watergate logic .. . now don't
you pay no attention to me, y'heah?
It's nothing personal at all and I surely don't
mean to single you out. It's just that San Francisco
is nearer than Washington.
In spite of everything, Joe, I would probably
vote for you because, and I say this sincerely,
because I think you're a much better man than
most, infinitely better than the small collection of
Kukla, Fran, and Ollies who are overstepping their
rights in Washington. Your political record shows
you've done some very fine and humanitarian
things.
It's just that you're not, well, all clean.

We all get headaches, right?
This weekend the migraine was Nixon firing
Ruckelshaus for not firing Cox. It was Nixon
forcing Richardson to resign for not firing Cox. It
was Nixon getting Robert Bork, a red-bearded Yale
law professor who's been with the Justice
Department team for a few weeks, to fire Cox. It
was Cox getting fired. Plus, it was a small reading on
Berkeley's seismograph. ...
But for me, it didn't begin there. Last week I
found myself endorsing a candidate who looked like
a good perker in California politics because, well, he
didn't look too crooked.
He's been to court twice in the past several years,
cleared on both accounts. Sooooooo, if I judge him
by current Watergate standards — assuming that the
good politician is the one with no convictions — he
looks good.
But wait! Not every politician gets a chance to
establish his probity in court. It's not fair. Some
have never even been accused! It only seems right to
say the ideal politician is the one who's been
indicted, brought to trial, and found not guilty,
because we know he's clean. Right?
Clean Candidate
San Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto announced
his candidacy for the California gubernatorial race a
couple weeks ago. I decided I'd probably vote for
him. First, he's a Democrat. Secondly, he's, well,
clean.
His first trial came up in early '70 when Alioto
was charged with illegal fee splitting in Washington
State shenanigans. Trial Two stemmed from bribery
charges connected with said shenanigans. But let me
back up.. ..
Electrical contractors were caught and charged
with bilking the public by monopoly price fixing in
the early '60s. Washington's Attorney General hired
Joe Alioto, one of the top anti-trust lawyers in the
country, to try the case, telling Joe the ceiling on
his fees would be 15 percent of the settlement or a
maximum of $1 million.(It first seemed a little
steep to me, but then I remembered a man must eat,

LEGAL. But if you'll pardon my soft approach, it
seems unfair. No, I take that back. It wasn't unfair
— it was thought-provoking.
Still Innocent
A man is innocent until proven guilty, right? And
you were never proven guilty. But in my opinion a
political leader should never get himself into a fix to
test that legal maxim. But of course I'm just
old-fashioned, pre-Watergate logic .. . now don't
you pay no attention to me, y'heah?
It's nothing personal at all and I surely don't
mean to single you out. It's just that San Francisco
is nearer than Washington.
In spite of everything, Joe, I would probably
vote for you because, and I say this sincerely,
because I think you're a much better man than
most, infinitely better than the small collection of
Kukla, Fran, and Ollies who are overstepping their
rights in Washington. Your political record shows
you've done some very fine and humanitarian
things.
It's just that you're not, well, all clean.

We all get headaches, right?
This weekend the migraine was Nixon firing
Ruckelshaus for not firing Cox. It was Nixon
forcing Richardson to resign for not firing Cox. It
was Nixon getting Robert Bork, a red-bearded Yale
law professor who's been with the Justice
Department team for a few weeks, to fire Cox. It
was Cox getting fired. Plus, it was a small reading on
Berkeley's seismograph. ...
But for me, it didn't begin there. Last week I
found myself endorsing a candidate who looked like
a good perker in California politics because, well, he
didn't look too crooked.
He's been to court twice in the past several years,
cleared on both accounts. Sooooooo, if I judge him
by current Watergate standards — assuming that the
good politician is the one with no convictions — he
looks good.
But wait! Not every politician gets a chance to
establish his probity in court. It's not fair. Some
have never even been accused! It only seems right to
say the ideal politician is the one who's been
indicted, brought to trial, and found not guilty,
because we know he's clean. Right?
Clean Candidate
San Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto announced
his candidacy for the California gubernatorial race a
couple weeks ago. I decided I'd probably vote for
him. First, he's a Democrat. Secondly, he's, well,
clean.
His first trial came up in early '70 when Alioto
was charged with illegal fee splitting in Washington
State shenanigans. Trial Two stemmed from bribery
charges connected with said shenanigans. But let me
back up.. ..
Electrical contractors were caught and charged
with bilking the public by monopoly price fixing in
the early '60s. Washington's Attorney General hired
Joe Alioto, one of the top anti-trust lawyers in the
country, to try the case, telling Joe the ceiling on
his fees would be 15 percent of the settlement or a
maximum of $1 million.(It first seemed a little
steep to me, but then I remembered a man must eat,
right?)
Fee Splitting
Anyway, in mid-trial it was learned that 15
percent could total well over $1 million, so secretly
the Attorney General lifted the ceiling on Joe's
retainer. Alioto ended up with $2.3 million and gave
$800,000 of the bundle to (guess who?) the
Attorney General and his colleagues who had given
ancillary assistance to Joe during the trial. Enter the
government charging illegal fee-splitting and

deception....
In the first test of cleanliness there were two
issues involved. First, that the fee-splitting
represented a conflict of interest since the Attorney
General was an employee of the state. Secondly,
that lifting the ceiling secretly was, errrr, at the very
least unethical, and at the very most illegal.
Well that's nowhere, man, because Alioto et al.
can prove they've broken no laws. They document
that a lawyer for the state had been notified that
the ceiling was lifted. Scotch that charge.
Plus in Washington State there was not one law
that could put the bee to Alioto. Absolutely
nothing. Case dismissed.
Another Trial
Trial Two is going to be even quicker. Alioto is
charged with bribery of public officials since
Federal officials interpret the $800,000 largess to
the Attorney General as a bribe — in return for
lifting the ceiling. Federal judges ruled in favor of
Alioto, without even having to hear his defense, the
case of the state was that weak. Dismissed.
Holy Haldeman! This guy looks good. No
convictions though he's been grilled and slurred
twice. Put on the hibache for "two ridiculous, silly,
unsubstantial charges." It was a "contrived case, a
14 carat fake," Alioto claimed.
C'mon Joe, upping your pay when you found
you could get more eggs in the basket! OK, OK, it's
LEGAL. But if you'll pardon my soft approach, it
seems unfair. No, I take that back. It wasn't unfair
