# Sensational Newt: Probable?
## Substitute News In Case We Run Out 
### 
This is a wonderful time to be
alive for headline enthusiasts.
Even the most tedious of songs on
the radio can be endured in hopes
of some new disaster being flashed
over the air. Every day is a
negative Christmas as newspapers
are unwrapped and new, bigger
headlines appear.
It is also a somewhat anxious
time for the college student with
journalistic ambitions. For it
seems that we are in danger of
using up all the news. After this
rush of events there is the
possibility of a great gap in
history comparable to the
administration of Millard
Fillmore.
Following are some stories
which would warm the heart of
the mo6t sensational headliner,
and set drooling the most ardent
scoops ter.

WASHINGTON - The White
House tapes have been tampered
with Federal District Court Judge
John Sirica revealed today. The

tapes, after intense public
pressure, were turned over to
Sirica Wednesday in accordance
with an earlier court order.
In a swift reaction to Sirica's
announcement President Nixon
stated; "I take full responsibility
for the tampering with the tapes,
but it wasn't my fault. It seems
that Julie got these tapes mixed
up with some of her music tapes
and recorded a Golddigger's
album on them."
Congressional reactions were
strong. Sen. Hubert Humphrey
called a press conference and said,
"Golly." Sen. George McGovern
commented, "I told you so."
Rep. Pete McCloskey

Watergate Committee Chairman
Sen. Sam Ervin mumbled, "As,
ah, Joshua before the, ah, walls of
Jericho the President has blown
it."

unfortunate but unimportant
accident. Once again I'm afraid

possible light on his actions."

Vice-Presidential nominee who
has been held hostage in a Senate
caucus room for two weeks said:
"Oh my God."
TEL AVIV - An Israeli
commando unit escaped from a
massive Egyptian force through a
gap in the Red Sea, which closed
upon the pursuing Egyptian
forces, Gen. Moyshe Dyan
announced today.
Egyptian spokesman denied

Egyptian troops had thrown the
Red Sea back with heavy losses.
Egyptian spokesmen also asserted
that the Israelis would be
"building pyramids without
stray," if their aggression
continued, and added that Moses
was a bully.
In other Mid-east
developments, King Faisel

supporting Israel Saudi Arabia
would buy the Pentagon.

unmannerly, working class,
California-born President."

"I'm going to get my gun."
Speaker of the House Carl
Albert, next in line for the

of a new vice-president, said

got to be a reason."

WASHINGTON - The Senate
and House voted overwhelmingly
for impeachment today after
turning down a last minute appeal
from the President.
Just before the voting the
President sent a note to both
houses of Congress which said in
part, "I was only kidding," and
offered executive clemency to any
congressmen who had criticized
him.
After the vote the President
sent another note to each house
which said simply, "nuts."
In a 14-page statement released
immediately after the
congressional vote the President
said; "In the interests of national
security and to protect the
historical prerogatives of this
office I must veto the
impeachment resolution. I base
my decision on the firm
constitutional principle of the
separation of powers."
Senate Majority Leader Mike
Mansfield is now acting President,
following the heart attack of
Speaker of the House Carl Albert
immediately after the voting. It is
unclear what the procedure will
be if former President Nixon
refuses to step down.
