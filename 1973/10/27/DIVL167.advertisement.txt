k/ / No "game plan" is complete without plenty of
delicious Round Table pizza, whether you're watching
at home or joining your friends for a victory
at our Castle. Call your own signals from 16
pizza varieties or choose a hamburger, oven-baked
sandwich, frankfurter, or salad. Your favorite beverages,
too. You're always a winner at the Round Table.
