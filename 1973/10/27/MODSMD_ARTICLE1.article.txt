# Stanford, WSU Battle For First Division Slot
## 
### MARK WHITE 
When a team sporting a 3-3
record meets a team that has won
once and lost five times, one
would expect the team winning
half of its games to have the
advantage over one victorious 17
percent of the season.
Not so in the case of
Washington State and Stanford.
Going into today's 1:30 game at
Stanford Stadium, WSU's Cougars
are tagged as two point favorites
to hold off the Cardinals in what
could be described as a battle to
stay in the top half of the Pacific
Eight conference.
WSU's apparent advantage
is grounded in two factors: 1)
their respectable performance
against the teams they have lost to
this season and, 2) the relative
ability of WSU's offense to move
the ball.
Difficult Schedule
Flaying the hardest early
season schedule in their school's
history, the Cougars came close to
beating the nationally ranked
sixth (USC), 11th (Arizona State)
n nd 13th (UCLA) teams, and
made a respectable showing
against the first (Ohio State) and
17th (Kansas) ranked squads.
UCLA is the one team WSU
and Stanford have mutually faced,
and the difference in the scores of
the two games (UCLA 24-WSU 13
and UCLA 59—Stanford 13)
understates the trouble the
Cougars fpve the Bruins. While
Stanford had virtually lost their
game in the first quarter, WSU
trailed the Bruins 3-0 at the half,
and should have led 7-3 had not a
running back fumbled on UCLA's
one yard line.
Fumbles have, to a large
extent, been the demise of the
Cougars. The nine fumbles they
had against UCLA last week
typified WSU's tendency to turn
over the ball following sustained
drives.
Tough Ground Game
But Stanford linebacker
coach Ray Handley feels the
strong Cougar ground game will
be one of the toughest the Cards
will face in 1973.
"If they're not as good as
UCLA's, they certainly have the
league's second best pair of
runners in Ken Grandberry and
Andrew Jones," said Handley.
"The Cougars also have as good a
blocking line as any we'll see this
year, and their guard, Steve
Ostermann is a great one."
Jones, a slashing 218-pound
fullback, is sixth in the Pac-8
rushing race with 416 yards.
Grandberry is right behind his
teammate occupying the seventh
spot with 270 yards and only
needs 61 more yards to become
WSU's all-time rushing leader.
Ostermann was a near

unanimous choice as an all-league
selection last year, and much of
the success the Cougars have had
with their veer-option offense can
be attributed to the 220-pound
guard.
Head To Head Battle
Last week's Pac-8 defensive
player of the week, Stanford
defensive end Pat Donovan, will
be facing Ostermann in what
should be a strong head to head
battle.
In last year's game, Stanford
went to a six-man line during the
second half in an attempt to stop
the now graduated Cougar
running quarterback, Ty Paine.
The WSU quarterback this year,
Chuck Peck, is less of a running
threat and Stanford plans to use
its "50" defense most of the
game.
While WSU probably would
prefer not to throw against a
Cardinal pass defense that leads
the league in fewest yards given
up, Stanford will have little choice
but to rely on Mike Boryla's
passing arm.
Cardinal attempts to run the
ball have been abortive (the
Cardinal average of 1.8 yards per
carry speaks for itself) and the

only way the Cards have been able
to move the ball has been through
the air.
WSU To Press Boryla
Sweeney recently said "We had
a great defensive effort last year
against Stanford, we sacked
Boryla 10 times. We're going to
put a lot of pressure on him again,
but I am sure they'll be working
hard to pick up the blitzes."
Indeed, Stanford's young
offensive line has been working on
protecting Boryla more
effectively.
"With all the stunting and
jumping around their defensive
line does, plus the blitzing of their
excellent linebackers, we're going
to have our hands full," said
Stanford offensive line coach
Hudson Houck. "We worked on
pass blocking a lot this week, but
on blitzes we should be ready to
dump the ball off if necessary."
Stanford coach Jack
Christiansen remarked, "We're
expecting a tough game — WSU
will be awfully hungry for a win."
Unless the Cards can maintain a
good defensive performance and
unless they can throw the ball
well, the volatile Cougars may be
hungry no more.

attempts to turn the corner against UCLA. Inge, a freshman, has been
seeing increasing amounts of varsity action and is the Cardinals' fourth
leading pass receiver with eight receptions for 61 yards.
