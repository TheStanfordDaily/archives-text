# And At Clarinet... Jacki Christiansen
## Coach's Daughter Enjoys Band 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Meet Jacki Christiansen. That's
Jacki, with an i.
The name sounds vaguely
familiar, you say. Well, there are
good reasons why it should. Jacki,
with an i, is the daughter of Jack,
with the Stanford Athletic
Department. Each Saturday
afternoon, while Jack's out there
running his football team, Jacki's
out there running her clarinet.
She's one of the 20 or so
female members of the
incomparably gross Stanford

Band, and proudly says"I love
every minute of it."
"Two years ago, when I first
decided I wanted to go to
Stanford, I told my dad 'I want to
be the first female member of the
Band.' But they opened it to
women just a year too soon,"
Jacki says.
Practical Experience
Two years ago, Jacki was just a
junior in high school, not even
sure she could get into Stanford.
Now she's a pre-nursing freshman,
living in Wilbur Hall. Two weeks

ago she got a chance to see how
nurses work up close when she
fainted on the field during the
halftime show of the UCLA game.
"To tell you the truth, I don't
remember anything from
Saturday at noon to Sunday
morning at eight. It's just a
complete blank," she explains.
"I don't eat anything before
games, because I'm so nervous. I
get really psyched up. And
something happened. The doctor
told my mom it was heat
prostation ... but I'm not going
to quit. I like the Band too
much."
Jacki takes football — and her
father's job — pretty seriously, so
joining the Band has forced her to
make some adjustments.
Bandsmen, who don't go lightly
on anybody, are particularly
tough on Stanford's head coach.
Upset At Comments
"I do get upset at what people
say at games. He's my dad ... At
the San Jose State, some of the

guys were yelling, 'Jack, how's
your golf game?' It made me feel
really bad because I know my
father's dedicated and he just
doesn't play golf during the
football season," she says.
"I think some of the guys I sit
with say less because I'm there,
but the Band isn't really toning it
down just because I'm a part of
the Band," Jacki adds. But she's
quick to point out that "it isn't
everyone in the Band, just some
people. And I've lived with it all
my life, anyway."
Jacki, a rabid football fan
herself, also admits that a certain
amount of armchair
quarterbacking is inevitable. "I
even scream and yell at him
[Jack] myself when I think he's
not doing the right thing," she
points out.
Not Derelicts
Some people claim the Band is
almost too gross for anyone,
much less a coach's daughter, but
Jacki disagrees. "I think all that is

exaggerated. We're not derelicts or
anything. There was a story in the
UCLA newspaper that said all the
guys were horny. But they've
never been like that towards any
of the girls in the Band ... at least
not to me."
Jacki thinks her relations with
the opposite sex have been at least
slightly hampered because of her
father's position. "Football
players all consider me the coach's
daughter, hands off," she says, a
little sorrowfully. "They'll say
'Hi, how are you' but never any
more beyond that. It's off limits.
"I guess they're afraid they
might get into trouble. That's how
it was in Hawaii last year [when
Jacki accompanied her father to
the game]. Mike Cordova
[freshman quarterback] lives in
Arroyo, just across from my
dorm. He comes over, uses my
phone, and we'll sit and talk. But
it's like a big brother.
"That's how it is witn all the
players. I sort of feel like they're
all big brothers. I just hope things
will change," she concludes. So, as
you can see, there's more
difference between Jack and Jacki
than just that i.

"I do get upset at what people
say at games. He's my dad ... At
the San Jose State, some of the

guys were yelling, 'Jack, how's
your golf game?' It made me feel
really bad because I know my
father's dedicated and he just
doesn't play golf during the
football season," she says.
"I think some of the guys I sit
with say less because I'm there,
but the Band isn't really toning it
down just because I'm a part of
the Band," Jacki adds. But she's
quick to point out that "it isn't
everyone in the Band, just some
people. And I've lived with it all
my life, anyway."
Jacki, a rabid football fan
herself, also admits that a certain
amount of armchair
quarterbacking is inevitable. "I
even scream and yell at him
[Jack] myself when I think he's
not doing the right thing," she
points out.
Not Derelicts
Some people claim the Band is
almost too gross for anyone,
much less a coach's daughter, but
Jacki disagrees. "I think all that is

exaggerated. We're not derelicts or
anything. There was a story in the
UCLA newspaper that said all the
guys were horny. But they've
never been like that towards any
of the girls in the Band ... at least
not to me."
Jacki thinks her relations with
the opposite sex have been at least
slightly hampered because of her
father's position. "Football
players all consider me the coach's
daughter, hands off," she says, a
little sorrowfully. "They'll say
'Hi, how are you' but never any
more beyond that. It's off limits.
"I guess they're afraid they
might get into trouble. That's how
it was in Hawaii last year [when
Jacki accompanied her father to
the game]. Mike Cordova
[freshman quarterback] lives in
Arroyo, just across from my
dorm. He comes over, uses my
phone, and we'll sit and talk. But
it's like a big brother.
"That's how it is witn all the
players. I sort of feel like they're
all big brothers. I just hope things
will change," she concludes. So, as
you can see, there's more
difference between Jack and Jacki
than just that i.


Jacki Christiansen
Meet Jacki Christiansen. That's
Jacki, with an i.
The name sounds vaguely
familiar, you say. Well, there are
good reasons why it should. Jacki,
with an i, is the daughter of Jack,
with the Stanford Athletic
Department. Each Saturday
afternoon, while Jack's out there
running his football team, Jacki's
out there running her clarinet.
She's one of the 20 or so
female members of the
incomparably gross Stanford

Band, and proudly says"I love
every minute of it."
"Two years ago, when I first
decided I wanted to go to
Stanford, I told my dad 'I want to
be the first female member of the
Band.' But they opened it to
women just a year too soon,"
Jacki says.
Practical Experience
Two years ago, Jacki was just a
junior in high school, not even
sure she could get into Stanford.
Now she's a pre-nursing freshman,
living in Wilbur Hall. Two weeks

ago she got a chance to see how
nurses work up close when she
fainted on the field during the
halftime show of the UCLA game.
"To tell you the truth, I don't
remember anything from
Saturday at noon to Sunday
morning at eight. It's just a
complete blank," she explains.
"I don't eat anything before
games, because I'm so nervous. I
get really psyched up. And
something happened. The doctor
told my mom it was heat
prostation ... but I'm not going
to quit. I like the Band too
much."
Jacki takes football — and her
father's job — pretty seriously, so
joining the Band has forced her to
make some adjustments.
Bandsmen, who don't go lightly
on anybody, are particularly
tough on Stanford's head coach.
