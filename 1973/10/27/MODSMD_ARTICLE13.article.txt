# Ex-Doormat Washington State Isn't Walked On Anymore
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Sometime last September, a
group of college football writers
and editors assembled in a posh
meeting room at Rockefeller
Center in New York and decided
that Washington State would be
ranked among the nation's top 20
teams in Sports Illustrated's
annual college football issue.
That's right, Washington State.
The same team that Stanford
annihilated 49-0 in 1969 and
63-16 in 1970 — the same
Washington State, in fact, that SI
said "did not belong in tne
Pacific Eight" several years ago.
"WSU was'the Brown of the West,
the VMI of the North, the gimme
on everybody's schedule," the
magazine said.
Washington State is now 1-5
and miles away from anybody's
top 20, but the fact that the
Cougars were even considered in
the preseason polls represents a
major victory for WSU's
revitalized athletic department.
The Cougar coaches and
administrators are determined to
prove that even though Pullman
may still be the doormat of the
West Coast, WSU teams will no
longer be swept aside by the
remainder of the Pac-8
conference.
The Washington State athletic
department is filled with new
faces. Athletic director Ray Nagel,
at 44 one of the youngest athletic
directors in the nation, is in his
third year as WSU's head man.
Football coach Jim Sweeney is in
his sixth season, sports
information director Mike Wilson
is in his fourth year and basketball
coach George Raveling will begin
his second season next month.
Reconstructed
Since those people have
become part of the program,
Cougar sports have literally been
reconstructed. The Clarence D.
Martin football stadium has been
rebuilt, bringing WSU football
back to Pullman after 28 straight
"road games." This year the
Cougar basketball team will be
leaving antiquated Bohler
Gymnasium ("the worst
basketball facility in the Pac-8,"
according to Stanford assistant
coach Bub Bowling) for the new
12,000 seat Performing Arts
Center.
"We used to play all of our
home football games in Spokane,"
Wilson recalled, "and you just
can't have a successful athletic
program without having most of
your events on campus.
The new facilities have
provided the impetus for
revitalized recruiting in all sports,
especially basketball and football.
Raveling, who suffered through a
6-20 season last year, nevertheless
hasn't lost any of his enthusiasm.

"It takes a long time to build a
quality basketball program,"
Raveling said. "We're like a small
child learning to walk — first you
learn to crawl, then walk, and
finally run."
Even though this year's Cougar
cagers won't run over Pac-8 this
year, Raveling has probably
reached at least the jogging stage
in his analogy, simply on the basis
of improved recruiting efforts.
"Our recruiting used to be
based almost entirely on kids
from Oregon and Washington,"
Wilson said, "but George has
brought a completely different
concept to recruiting. He got one
player this year from Yugoslavia,
so I guess you could say we've
expanded from two states to
worldwide recruiting."
Sweeney hasn't yet gone the
international route in search of
football talent, but he says that
Cougar football recruiting has
made tremendous strides in the
past few years. "We definitely
have better football players now
than the ones I inherited,"
Sweeney said.
Winning Some
"We're starting to win some
recruiting wars with Washington
and the other Pac-8 schools now.

We don't win very often, but
we're winning some — people have
realized that there's some stability
in our program."
But is it hard to recruit when
all you have to offer is the
unthriving metropolis of Pullman?
"Actually, there are a lot of
advantages here," Sweeney said,
"A lot of kids seek out a
collegiately oriented setting —
they don't want a metropolitan
atmosphere. And a lot of parents
would rather have their kids go
here than Seattle."
What it all boils down to is that
the prospective college athlete
looks for a place where he can
best develop his talents.
"A kid will go to Multhomah if
he thinks he can play," Sweeney
said.
But Multhomah doesn't have
WSU's new facilities, energetic
coaches, and an old fashioned,
enthusiastic student body: "We
still get 5,000 students for pep
rallies sometimes," Wilson said.
So maybe Pullman will be the
site of an athletic dynasty in the
late 19705.
Or at least the Cougars won't
be "the gimme on everybody's
schedule."

is in his fourth year and basketball
coach George Raveling will begin
his second season next month.
Reconstructed
Since those people have
become part of the program,
Cougar sports have literally been
reconstructed. The Clarence D.
Martin football stadium has been
rebuilt, bringing WSU football
back to Pullman after 28 straight
"road games." This year the
Cougar basketball team will be
leaving antiquated Bohler
Gymnasium ("the worst
basketball facility in the Pac-8,"
according to Stanford assistant
coach Bub Bowling) for the new
12,000 seat Performing Arts
Center.
"We used to play all of our
home football games in Spokane,"
Wilson recalled, "and you just
can't have a successful athletic
program without having most of
your events on campus.
The new facilities have
provided the impetus for
revitalized recruiting in all sports,
especially basketball and football.
Raveling, who suffered through a
6-20 season last year, nevertheless
hasn't lost any of his enthusiasm.

"It takes a long time to build a
quality basketball program,"
Raveling said. "We're like a small
child learning to walk — first you
learn to crawl, then walk, and
finally run."
Even though this year's Cougar
cagers won't run over Pac-8 this
year, Raveling has probably
reached at least the jogging stage
in his analogy, simply on the basis
of improved recruiting efforts.
"Our recruiting used to be
based almost entirely on kids
from Oregon and Washington,"
Wilson said, "but George has
brought a completely different
concept to recruiting. He got one
player this year from Yugoslavia,
so I guess you could say we've
expanded from two states to
worldwide recruiting."
Sweeney hasn't yet gone the
international route in search of
football talent, but he says that
Cougar football recruiting has
made tremendous strides in the
past few years. "We definitely
have better football players now
than the ones I inherited,"
Sweeney said.
Winning Some
"We're starting to win some
recruiting wars with Washington
and the other Pac-8 schools now.

We don't win very often, but
we're winning some — people have
realized that there's some stability
in our program."
But is it hard to recruit when
all you have to offer is the
unthriving metropolis of Pullman?
"Actually, there are a lot of
advantages here," Sweeney said,
"A lot of kids seek out a
collegiately oriented setting —
they don't want a metropolitan
atmosphere. And a lot of parents
would rather have their kids go
here than Seattle."
What it all boils down to is that
the prospective college athlete
looks for a place where he can
best develop his talents.
"A kid will go to Multhomah if
he thinks he can play," Sweeney
said.
But Multhomah doesn't have
WSU's new facilities, energetic
coaches, and an old fashioned,
enthusiastic student body: "We
still get 5,000 students for pep
rallies sometimes," Wilson said.
So maybe Pullman will be the
site of an athletic dynasty in the
late 19705.
Or at least the Cougars won't
be "the gimme on everybody's
schedule."

TOP BERTH AT PULLMAN — Andrew Jones, seventh leading ground
gainer in the Pac-8 going into today's action, provides proof that
talented athletes no longer avoid Washington State. Jones and partner
Ken Grandberry form one of the best running back combinations in
the league.
Sometime last September, a
group of college football writers
and editors assembled in a posh
meeting room at Rockefeller
Center in New York and decided
that Washington State would be
ranked among the nation's top 20
teams in Sports Illustrated's
annual college football issue.
That's right, Washington State.
The same team that Stanford
annihilated 49-0 in 1969 and
63-16 in 1970 — the same
Washington State, in fact, that SI
said "did not belong in tne
Pacific Eight" several years ago.
"WSU was'the Brown of the West,
the VMI of the North, the gimme
on everybody's schedule," the
magazine said.
Washington State is now 1-5
and miles away from anybody's
top 20, but the fact that the
Cougars were even considered in
the preseason polls represents a
major victory for WSU's
revitalized athletic department.
The Cougar coaches and
administrators are determined to
prove that even though Pullman
may still be the doormat of the
West Coast, WSU teams will no
longer be swept aside by the
remainder of the Pac-8
conference.
The Washington State athletic
department is filled with new
faces. Athletic director Ray Nagel,
at 44 one of the youngest athletic
directors in the nation, is in his
third year as WSU's head man.
Football coach Jim Sweeney is in
his sixth season, sports

is in his fourth year and basketball

brought a completely different
concept to recruiting. He got one
player this year from Yugoslavia,
so I guess you could say we've
expanded from two states to
worldwide recruiting."
Sweeney hasn't yet gone the
international route in search of
football talent, but he says that
Cougar football recruiting has
made tremendous strides in the
past few years. "We definitely
have better football players now
than the ones I inherited,"
Sweeney said.
Winning Some
"We're starting to win some
recruiting wars with Washington
and the other Pac-8 schools now.

We don't win very often, but
we're winning some — people have
realized that there's some stability
in our program."
But is it hard to recruit when
all you have to offer is the
unthriving metropolis of Pullman?
"Actually, there are a lot of
advantages here," Sweeney said,
"A lot of kids seek out a
collegiately oriented setting —
they don't want a metropolitan
atmosphere. And a lot of parents
would rather have their kids go
here than Seattle."
What it all boils down to is that
the prospective college athlete
looks for a place where he can
best develop his talents.
"A kid will go to Multhomah if
he thinks he can play," Sweeney
said.
But Multhomah doesn't have
WSU's new facilities, energetic
coaches, and an old fashioned,
enthusiastic student body: "We
still get 5,000 students for pep
rallies sometimes," Wilson said.
So maybe Pullman will be the
site of an athletic dynasty in the
late 19705.
Or at least the Cougars won't
be "the gimme on everybody's
schedule."

TOP BERTH AT PULLMAN — Andrew Jones, seventh leading ground
gainer in the Pac-8 going into today's action, provides proof that
talented athletes no longer avoid Washington State. Jones and partner
Ken Grandberry form one of the best running back combinations in
the league.
Sometime last September, a
group of college football writers
and editors assembled in a posh
meeting room at Rockefeller
Center in New York and decided
that Washington State would be
ranked among the nation's top 20
teams in Sports Illustrated's
annual college football issue.
That's right, Washington State.
The same team that Stanford
annihilated 49-0 in 1969 and
63-16 in 1970 — the same
Washington State, in fact, that SI
said "did not belong in tne
Pacific Eight" several years ago.
"WSU was'the Brown of the West,
the VMI of the North, the gimme
on everybody's schedule," the
magazine said.
Washington State is now 1-5
and miles away from anybody's
top 20, but the fact that the
Cougars were even considered in
the preseason polls represents a
major victory for WSU's
revitalized athletic department.
The Cougar coaches and
administrators are determined to
prove that even though Pullman
may still be the doormat of the
West Coast, WSU teams will no
longer be swept aside by the
remainder of the Pac-8
conference.
The Washington State athletic
department is filled with new
faces. Athletic director Ray Nagel,
at 44 one of the youngest athletic
directors in the nation, is in his
third year as WSU's head man.
Football coach Jim Sweeney is in
his sixth season, sports
information director Mike Wilson
is in his fourth year and basketball
coach George Raveling will begin
his second season next month.
Reconstructed
Since those people have
become part of the program,
Cougar sports have literally been
reconstructed. The Clarence D.
Martin football stadium has been
rebuilt, bringing WSU football
back to Pullman after 28 straight
"road games." This year the
Cougar basketball team will be
leaving antiquated Bohler
Gymnasium ("the worst
basketball facility in the Pac-8,"
according to Stanford assistant
coach Bub Bowling) for the new
12,000 seat Performing Arts
Center.
"We used to play all of our
home football games in Spokane,"
Wilson recalled, "and you just
can't have a successful athletic
program without having most of
your events on campus.
The new facilities have
provided the impetus for
revitalized recruiting in all sports,
especially basketball and football.
Raveling, who suffered through a
6-20 season last year, nevertheless
hasn't lost any of his enthusiasm.

"It takes a long time to build a
quality basketball program,"
Raveling said. "We're like a small
child learning to walk — first you
learn to crawl, then walk, and
finally run."
Even though this year's Cougar
cagers won't run over Pac-8 this
year, Raveling has probably
reached at least the jogging stage
in his analogy, simply on the basis
of improved recruiting efforts.
"Our recruiting used to be
based almost entirely on kids
from Oregon and Washington,"
Wilson said, "but George has
brought a completely different
concept to recruiting. He got one
player this year from Yugoslavia,
so I guess you could say we've
expanded from two states to
worldwide recruiting."
Sweeney hasn't yet gone the
international route in search of
