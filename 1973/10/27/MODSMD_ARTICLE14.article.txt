# Dichotomized Pac-8 Enters Fourth Week
## 
### 
As Pacific Eight teams enter
their fourth week of conference
play, one thing has become clear
â€” that the league is dichotomized
into two groups. The four
"California crushers," USC,
UCLA, Stanford, and California,
have a combined record of 16-7-1.
The four "Northwest nothings,"
Oregon, Oregon State,
Washington, and Washington
State, on the other hand, have a
combined total record of 4-20.
This week, no Northwest team
except Washington State has to
play a California team, and the
Cougars should certainly be able
to avoid being crushed by
Stanford.
In another conference battle,
Cal visits UCLA. "Hie two teams
have similarly potent offenses,
ranking first and second in the
conference.
But the difference between the
teams, and the reason the Bruins
are favored over the Golden Bears
in this battle between two
varieties of the same species, is
that Cal has not shown any
defense.
The Bears have allowed
opponents an average of 33.8
points and 431.5 yards per game,
both statistics being by far the
worst in the conference. UCLA,
meanwhile, trails only USC in
total defense.
In the only other conference
game scheduled, Washington visits
Oregon. Hiis game is of major
importance to the Huskies, as if
they don't win today, they

probably won't win at all during
the conference season, their
remaining league opponents being
USC, UCLA and Washington
State.
In non-conference action, USC
renews its traditional rivalry
against Notre Dame on (almost)
national television. Hie Trojans
are ranked sixth in the nation, the
Fighting Irish eighth, and Troy is
expected to emerge from the
shadow of the Golden Dome
unscathed.
Tonight, Oregon State plays
Arizona State at Portland.
Arizona State's offense is very
good, OSU's defense isn't, and the
Sun Devils are expected to score
enough to win.
