# Christians On Stanford Football Team
## Players Seek To Understand God 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
If you were to write down a list of
characteristics shared by a group of Stanford
football players, it's probably unlikely you'd
include a phrase such as "devotes his life to
Christ."
But in fact, the Christian movement is
stronger on the Stanford football team than at
most other Pacific Eight schools, and also
proportionately stronger than among most
other groups of people on campus and away
from it.
About 15 persons associated with the team
come to the weekly Bible study group led by
Jim Stump, a director of Campus Crusade for
Christ.
The group includes quarterback Mike
Boryla, center Bill Reid, tight ends Brad
Williams and Ted Pappas, linebackers Geb
Church, Terry Pape, Dan Francis and Rich
Merlo, defensive backs Doc Blanchard and
Wayne La√üocque, end Greg Smith, manager
Mike McGovern and assistant JV coach Ted
Bleymaier.
'Share God's Love'
Why have a group? Reid, an articulate
speaker, says "God unites people on earth. We
try to find His love and express it to other
guys on the team."
Pape, who has been attending meetings for
four years, adds "I think for the players in the
group it definitely gives us a spirit of unity."
And Bleymaier, a 1972 graduate who has
been with the group since its inception five
years ago, says "it's only in fellowship that we
can find spiritual growth."
Basically, the so-called "God squad" is
non-denominational, but accepts the

evangelical doctrine as is taught by such
figures as Rev. Billy Graham.
Four Beliefs
According to Pape, this includes the beliefs
that God loves all mankind, that all people are
basically self-centered sinners,.that God sent
Jesus to die on the cross so that man could
approach God and that to have relations with
God one must invite Christ into his life.
The members also generally believe in the
existence of Satan and of a Biblical Heaven
and Hell. However, they do not believe
everyone must hold the same ideas of whether
such thing; as alcohol and marijuana are
permissible.
At recent meetings, such questions such as
whether to take the Bible literally or
symbolically and whether man has a free will
have been calmly discussed.
The weekly meetings, more unstructured
than in the past to encourage open discussion
and attendance, also include prayers for those
acquaintances, both on and off the football
team, who members of the group believe are
being led away from Christ, and are having
doubts because they are being tempted by
Satan.
Personal Problems
Personal problems of members of the
group are also discussed. An example of this
occurred several weeks ago, when Pape was
debating whether to quit football.
"I came really close to quitting. I wasn't
playing much, and I was unsure of whether
God wanted me to play or not," Pape says,
adding that he may have resented the role of
"spiritual leader" of the Christians on the
team he had inherited from Jeff Siemon and

Steve Murray.
"I asked God for direction and my
Christian teammates and I talked about
it... He changed my mind about football,"
at least in part through Pape's teammates
talking to him. The senior is now playing
quite a bit at linebacker and on the punting
team.
In addition to the weekly meetings, prayer
sessions are held before and after each game.
Christians from other teams, such as
Washington State linebacker Tom Poe, are
invited to the postgame sessions.
A recent goal of the group has been to give
spiritual aid and practical advice to Christian
football players from other schools who want
to start groups similar to the one at Stanford.
Recruiting Other Players
The group would like to present its ideas to
the non-Christian members of the team. "We
think we have a real answer to the problems
of the world and we'd like to share it with
everyone," Pape says.
Bleymaier says that the members try to get
players and other coaches interested and make
them become inquisitive about Christianity.
"We try to answer their questions ... they're
sometimes hesitant about coming to our
meetings because they're afraid of being
pushed into something."
Reid, who plans to "teach God's word"
after graduation, feels that the best method of
converting someone is by example. "A lot of
non-Christians snicker at us so-called 'Jesus
freaks.' If someone won't accept your beliefs,
you show him your life, and hell see you and
think 'I'd like to look into it.' n
