# 1971 Rose Bowl Heroes Continue To Succeed
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
One of the few pleasant
occupations of Stanford football
fans these days is to recall the
Rose Bowl years. Looking at the
1973 Cardinals struggle vainly
against top ten powerhouses like
Michigan and Penn State, it is
hard to believe that only three
seasons ago John Ralston
assembled one of the most
talented teams in the annals of
college football.
Ten players from the 1971
Rose Bowl team that upset Ohio
State 27-17 are currently playing
professional football. Most of the
remaining players have found
success in other fields.
Everyone knows that Jim
Plunkett has been the New
England Patriots starting
quarterback since he received the
Heisman Trophy and led Stanford
to the Rose Bowl win. He was
voted Rookie of the Year in the
American Football Conference in
1971 and is acknowledged as one
of the finest quarterbacks in the
game despite playing for the
perennieally weak Patriots.
Plunkett's favorite receiver,
Randy Vataha, was drafted 17th
by the L.A. Rams and was not
given a chance by the experts to
make the pros because of his size.
The Rams sent Vataha packing
with their final cuts and Plunkett
prevailed on the Patriots
management to give Vataha a
tryout. The Plunkett-Vataha
combination worked, and Randy
was the leading receiver in the
AFC his rookie year.
Defensive tackle Dave Tipton
was drafted in the fourth round
by the New York Giants in 1971
and has been starting for them the
last two years.
Tight End Bob Moore was
drafted in the fifth round that
year by the Oakland Raiders and
played behind Raymond Chester
until the trade that sent Chester
to the Colts for Bubba Smith
before the 1973 season. Moore
has starred for the Raiders in his
new starting role.
In Other Occupations
The fifth and last player
drafted in 1971, linebacker Ron
Kadziel, went to the Dallas
Cowboys in the fifth round. He
did not make the team and went
to New England where he signed
as a free agent and played until
the beginning of this season when
he quit and returned to the
Stanford area.
Kadziel is working at Chuck's
Steak House on El Camino in Los
Altos under the manager there
whose name is Jack Schultz. That
name should be familiar, because
Schultz was the co-captain and
starting strong safety for the 1971
Rose Bowl winners.
John Sande, the center who
held off the charges of
All-American linebacker Jim
Stillwagon from Ohio State, has
completed combined law and
business school graduate study at
Harvard.
Benny Barnes, defensive
halfback, was not drafted, but
went to the Cowboys as a free
agent and after two seasons as a
reserve, is starting some Cowboy
games this year. He returned to
Stanford last spring and
completed his undergraduate
studies.
Class Of '72
There were plenty of talented
juniors on that Rose Bowl team
that dumped the Buckeyes who

went on to the pros after
revisiting Pasadena in 1972.
Three Stanford players were
drafted in the first two rounds of
the 1972 pro draft. Greg Sampson
was drafted in the first round by
the Houston Oilers and has started
on their defensive line ever since.
All-American middle
linebacker Jeff Siemon was also
drafted in the first round by the
Minnesota Vikings and began
starting in the middle of his first
season after Lonnie Warwick was
injured. Warwick was traded in
the off-season, and Siemon is
already being mentioned as a
candidate for All-Pro honors.
Pete Lazetich was drafted in
the second round that same year
and is seeing action in the San
Diego Chargers' defensive line that
includes standouts like Deacon
Jones and Coy Bacon.
Two In Grad School
One player who had a good
chance to go into pro football and
turned it down was running back
Jackie Brown. He was drafted in
the seventh round by the Raiders
but chose to attend Stanford Law
School instead. Brown wants his
future to be in the law and has
been active in campus affairs.
Quarterback Don Bunce
starred in the then-Indians' win
over Michigan but could not make
it in the pros. Drafted 12th by the
Redskins, Bunce chose to go to
the Canadian Football League but
wound up playing behind a
Michigan signal caller, Don
Morehead, at Vancouver. Bunce
gave up football and is now
attending Stanford Medical
School.
Defensive guard Larry Butler
was drafted by the Atlanta
Falcons in the 16th round but
could not make it in the pro ranks
either. He is doing well, however,
with Grubb and Ellis, a large
property development firm in San
Jose.

Outside linebacker Mike
Simone did not get drafted but
signed as a free agent with John
Ralston and the Denver Broncos
and is playing there now on the
specialty teams and filling in at
linebacker.
Assistant Coach
Bill Meyers played strong
tackle for Stanford's Rose Bowl
teams, and followed his coaches
after completing his career here.
He did not go to Denver, however.
Meyers was offered an assistant
coaching job at Cal by Mike White
who accepted the head coaching
position at his alma mater after
Ralston left for the Broncos.

There was even a sophomore
on that first Rose Bowl team in
1971. Defensive halfback Charles
McCloud closed out a brilliant
Stanford career last season and is
now pursuing graduate studies
here.
Another player shunned a pro
career and has become more of a
local celebrity than when he was
playing football. Steve Jubb
started at offensive tackle against
Ohio State but chose not to take
advantage of another year of
eligibility. He quit before the '71
season but was still voted
Honorable Mention All-Pacific

Eight Conference honors after the
season. The fact that he was never
on the team that year did not
bother the sportswriters. Jubb
pursued a musical career and his
rock band has become one of the
most popular in the Bay Area.
In one way or another, the
players from the team that beat
Ohio State have found success.
It is some consolation that
Stanford players this year have a
history of success that precedes
them. If they continue to be
unable to find success on the field
this year, rest assured that they
will probably find it off the field.

STILL FLYING HIGH — Jeff Siemon, shown here landing on already-doomed Rex Kern in the 1971 Rose
Bowl, is now starting at linebacker for the Minnesota Vikings. Now in his second season, he is given a good
chance at winning all-Pro honors.
