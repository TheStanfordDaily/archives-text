# Citizens Criticize Nixon At Palo Alto Rally Friday
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
A small crowd of 200 anti-Nixon
demonstrators heard speakers criticize
the President and his handling of the
Watergate case, calling for his
impeachment and removal from
office at a rally in front of the Palo
Alto Civic Center Friday afternoon.
About 150 of the protesters had
begun the demonstration by marching
silently from the Law School to the
Civic Center, where they joined a
smaller group which had made a
similar trek from a downtown office
building.
"This walk and rally in Palo Alto
is simply one example of the unity of
feeling in universities and cities
throughout the country, a feeling of
outrage and humiliation at the
actions of our President," stated
third-year law student Frederick
Baron, one of the march's organizers.
Governmental Process
Palo Alto Mayor Kirke Comstock
said that he was concerned with
governmental process. *'I call upon
you to make that process work," he
said.
Comstock added that the reaction
of vice presidential nominee Gerald
Ford to the firings of Archibald Cox
as special prosecutor and William
Ruckelshaus as deputy attorney
general, and to the resignation of
Elliot Richardson as attorney general,
indicates that Ford's views are not
much different than Nixon's.
Bryant Young, president of the
Stanford Law Students Association

and the rally's chairman, said that the
people must "demand that Congress
take steps necessary to restore a
government of law."
Lisa Giraud, wife of French Prof.
Raymond Giraud, talked about the
"crisis of confidence" that faces the
nation. She mocked this slogan,
agreeing that there was a crisis, but
added that she "never did really have
any confidence" in Nixon.
Lost Trust
Charles Schulz, former president
of the Palo Alto Bar Association, said
"a person who has lost the trust of
the American people" should not be
retained simply because he is an
"international fire-fighter."
Dexter Lehtinen, a Vietnam
veteran and former president of the
Florida Federation of College Young
Republicans, addressed the issue of
working within the system, citing the
fact that many people who disagreed
with the President's Vietnam war
policy used the processes of
government, but now Nixon "claims
a right to opt out of the system
when he doesn't get things his way."
During Lehtinen's speech, two
sign-carrying Nixon supporters
located themselves behind the
speaker's podium and displayed their
placards to the displeasure of the
audience.
The Presidential sympathizers
remained there as former Palo Alto
School Board Member Agnes
Robinson and Palo Alto attorney
Grant Spaeth attacked Nixon and

urged the demonstrators to "flood
Washington" with letters and phone
calls, in Robinson's words.
Equal Time
Young then allowed the Nixon
backers to express their views before
the hostile crowd. Robert Newman of
Menlo Park, a school teacher and
retired Naval officer, said that the
"people who should be prosecuted"
are the "Communists all over the
world."
