# Students Receive Competent Care
## Cowell Assures Satisfactory Service 
### 
Mary Shepard

This is a personal comment on
the letter in last Tuesday's Daily
from the members of Columbae
House. I cannot defend Cowell's
scheduling policy for I
wholeheartedly agree that the
waiting period is totally
unreasonable. But I can't say
whether there should be a full
time gynecologist because I don't
know how many complex female
afflictions Cowell sees. And I
strongly disagree with the

Columbae contention that
screening by other physicians is
unfair. I believe that women
should become aware that
generalists are certainly
competent to provide some
gynecological care.
I am no authority on
gynecological problems, but while
doing volunteer work at Planned
Parenthood in Mountain View,
and Our Health Center in Palo
Alto, I have seen common female

problems such as vaginal
infections, venereal disease, and
birth control handled well by
general practitioners. I don't think
most women have the medical
knowledge that physicians have,
and thus it is reasonable that
Cowell does not let women refer
themselves directly to the
gynecologist.
After all, I once talked with a
woman who was sure that her
lower abdominal pain was being

caused by ovarian cysts. Upon
examination by a generalist it
turned out she had instead a
bladder infection. Probably if she
had been given the opportunity to
see a gynecologist she would have,
and after the diagnosis had been
made and the treatment given, she
would be no better off than if she
had seen a generalist. I feel that
highly skilled professionals should
be used to their utmost, but this
does not mean using a
gynecologist to do something
another less specialized physician
could do as well.
I'm sure many women fear that
non-gynecologists will try to treat
them on their own limited
knowledge and fail to refer
complicated problems to the
gynecologist. This is a fear that is
unfounded. Physicians that are
not gynecologists are well aware
from their training what is normal
and abnormal, and in a prepaid
medical practice such as Cowell
they should have no qualms about
referring cases too specialized for
them. The horror stories are not
pleasant but certainly all
physicians are human and are
expected to make some
judgement errors â€” and
gynecologists are no different.
As far as birth control is
concerned I'm not sure whether it
is the case that Cowell pushes the
pill or that many women just
want it because it is reliable and
easy. There are some horror
stories about lUD's, and lUD's are
also less reliable. But to get back
to the main point, there is no
reason why a non-gynecologist
cannot take care of most birth
control needs. This includes being
knowledgeable of the different
kinds of pills and their side
effects, and having the ability to
fit lUD's and diaphrams. And if a
physician does not possess the
latter two skills, it shouldn't be
hard to train her/him. One does
not have to be a gynecologist to
do a good job in this area, in fact,
in some areas of our country all
these services have been solely
carried out by nurse practitioners
for years.
In conclusion, students at
Stanford should realize before
they become overly critical of
their University's health care
system how much better off they
are than many Americans, and
most other college students. As a
population, our student body is
probably only less better cared for
than wealthy persons with private
physicians and good insurance.
