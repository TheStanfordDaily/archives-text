Apology Required
Editor:
I object strenuously to the Daily's insertion of the heading
"Support Benevolent Genocide" at the top of Dr. William Shockley's
Oct. 24 article. It is one thing to criticize a writer editorially, but
quite another to insert a bit of gratuitous mudslinging into the midst
of his own guest column. Dr. Shockley has not advocated genocide,
benevolent or otherwise, and it is shameful that he must subject
himself to this sort of name-calling in order to present his views to the
Stanford community.
The Daily owes him an apology.

World Bank Questioned
Editor:
Today the World Bank is visiting Stanford for the purpose of
recruiting graduates, mainly in Business Administration, for its
organization. The World Bank originated in the Bretton Woods
monetary conference of 1944. It was designed to provide funds for
the reconstruction of Europe. For some time it has turned its
attention toward the Third World. During fiscal year 1972-73 it
extended over $3.5 billion for 'developmental assistance.' The bulk of
the Bank's loans are for development of "infrastructure," with a
major portion going toward transportation and power facilities.
During 1972 loans were extended for the construction of highways in
South Korea, electric power in Sri Lanka, and for colonization of the
Brazilian Northeast.
In recent years a number of questions have been raised concerning
the nature of the Bank's operations. The most well known critique of
the Bank's operation came from Teresa Hayter formerly of the
Overseas Development Institute at the University of Sussex. Her book
"Aid as Imperialism" was based on a careful study of internal
documents of the World Bank as well as interviews with the Bank's
officials.
Ms. Hayter concluded that the emphasis of the Bank's lending is
upon preserving stability of the political economic structure; i.e., free
enterprise, market mechanisms, respect of private property. The
evidence in the case of Chile seems to indicate that the Bank is
prepared to go to some lengths to discourage nations from pursuing
their own solutions where these conflict with the above principles.
Between 1965 and 1968 Chile received nearly $100 million
annually in loans from the World Bank. During 1972-73 no loans were

extended to Chile because it had elected a socialist government. On
October 4 the Wall Street Journal reported that "The World
Bank ... has said that it will consider loans to Chile now that
Allende's economic policies have ended." Stanford students should
attend the World Bank meeting today at noon in Bishop Aud. and ask
the representative why the World Bank acted in this way.

Kennedy Lacks Judgment
Editor:
In a recent Daily article, "Kennedy's Chances Look Promising," I
was amazed to find a position stating, "not until Chappaquidick did
he (Kennedy) show informed, mature judgment, tested in difficult
conditions."
I do not condemn Kennedy for going the wrong way down a road
in order to get to Edgartown, even though he had grown up in, and is
very familiar with, the area. Nor do I particularly condemn Kennedy
for his bad driving; after all the bridge is quite treacherous. I am not
even greatly concerned (as far as his presidential qualifications go) in
the tragic fact that a young woman who was riding in his car drowned.
However, I am very concerned in his judgment in light of his
actions immediately following the accident. Instead of phoning the
police from the nearest house 100 yards away, he went back to the
house where the party that night had been given and enlisted the help
of two friends in diving off the bridge, trying to get to the car. When
they found they could do nothing, Kennedy's friends drove him to
the Chappaquidick ferry slip.
Yet even the Senator's friends did nothing to inform the police.
Finding that the last ferry had already left. Kennedy swam across the
channel to Edgartown. He walked back to his hotel and at 2 a.m.
called his family lawyer, Burke Marshall, to ask for advice. It was not
until the police found the car the next morning and had traced the
license plates to Kennedy that the Senator showed up at the police
station (freshly showered and in a clean suit) to report the accident.
To me, the Senator's action shows a far greater concern with his
own political reputation than in the chance (even if remote) that a
young woman's life could be saved.
By his actions, Kennedy has shown that in a crisis when he has no
time to call upon his speech writers he values his own political
ambitions more highly than the lives of people he is responsible for.
Kennedy is an outstanding senator but in times of crisis when
immediate decision and action is essential he has shown by his action
at Chappaquidick that he does not possess the necessary qualifications
to be President.
