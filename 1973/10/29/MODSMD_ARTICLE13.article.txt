# Peace Pilgrim's Journey Zigzags Through Palo Alto
## 
### JANET SANDERS 
A little old lady, the
self-advertisement of "25,000
miles on foot for peace"
emblazened on her blue
windbrcaker, walked in and out of
Palo Alto last week.
The campus was only one of
many rest stops as this
self-appointed evangelist for peace
zigzagged the nation for the sixth
time in 20 years.
"I won't stop my walking
pilgrimage until we achieve world
peace," she said. Her journey will
end soon, she reassured everyone,
because "all nations will give up
war in the next 10 years. Then I
will stop walking."
Zealously hiding her
background, the woman, nearing
80 years old, gave up her real
name long ago for the more
appropriate one of "Peace
Pilgrim." And she is as eccentric
as her title and mission.
Divine Mission
It all began Jan. 1, 1953 in Los
Angeles when Peace said she
received something akin to divine
inspiration to begin a walk for
peace. "My friends thought I had
taken leave of my senses," she
smiled.
Leaving behind all "worldly

possessions" except for a pen,
toothbrush and comb, Peace
reached New York the first year,
averaging 25 miles a day. In 1964,
she reached her goal of 25,000
miles, so she stopped counting.
"When I first started, there was
no evidence that peace was
possible," she said, "but now we
have just about learned from our
mistakes."
Nonviolence
"Even stupid people can see
that war solves nothing," Peace
told a small group at Memorial
Church last week. "Peace is
inevitable."
Besides outlining her
nonviolent philosophy, Peace also
recounted some of her pilgrimage
experiences. "I walk until given
shelter and fast until given food,"
she said repeatedly, adding that
she has never had to ask for
anything.
Just like the character in
Pilgrims Progress, Peace said she
underwent several "tests" of her
belief in the "power of human
love." She dramatically told of
her encounter with a disturbed
teenage boy who attacked her,
saying that she not only halted his
blows but completely cured him.
"He has not committed an act of
violence since then," she claimed.

Peace also enumerated the
ways in which world peace could
be achieved.
Establishment of a world
government, world language and a
national peace department to
replace the defense department
are not only possibilities but
probabilities in the next decade,
she said.
"The hardest thing is to make
people believe all this can
happen," she said, anticipating the
incredulity of her listeners.
