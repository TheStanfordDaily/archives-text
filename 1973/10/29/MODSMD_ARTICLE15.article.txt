# Land Development Needs New Controls
## Reed Plugs 'Land Ethic' 
### MIKE PHILLIPS 
A call for a new "land ethic"
was the keynote of an address by
Nathaniel P. Reed, assistant
secretary for fish, wildlife and
parks in the U.S. Department of
the Interior, at Skilling
Auditorium Saturday morning.
Speaking to a nature
conservancy conference hosted by
the Stanford Conservation Club,
Reed said that a change in pub"c
attitudes was necessary to stop
"reckless individualism" in land
development.
"Three million acres succumb
to shopping centers and houses
each year," he said. "Planning and
environmental ethic must come to
the fore."
Reed criticized Congress for
delaying passage of a land use bill
which would establish guidelines
for federal and state officials in
land development programs.
Congress has killed the bill in
committees for the past five years,
Reed charged. However, he
admitted that even if the bill is
passed, it will probably lack the
necessary sanctions to enforce
responsible land development.

"Right now our only means of
preserving the land is through
purchasing," he explained, adding
that by next year there will be a
$400 million backlog of
authorized purchases.
Reed said that effective land
planning requires a knowledge of
his budget for at least five years in
advance, though he must work on
a year to year basis. "Advance
planning would do away with this

crazy quiltwork of park land
buying," he said.
Area members, Reed said,
could best promote a change in
the public attitudes by educating
themselves and informing the
public about irresponsibility by
the government and by individuals
who are unaware of "the
consequences of their actions."
