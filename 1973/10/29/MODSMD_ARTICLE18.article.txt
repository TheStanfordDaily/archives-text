# Boryla, Laidlaw Lift Vengeful Cards Past WSU
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Even the young Stanford
Cardinals, the ones who were still
freshmen or high school students
when the Cards played
Washington State last year,
weren't allowed to forget what
happened in Pullman on Nov. 11,
1972.
''Washington State 27,
Stanford 13" read the big sign in
the Stanford locker room, and
underneath the final score was the
real motivation. "We'd like to
play Stanford every week," was
one quote attributed to WSU
coach Jim Sweeney. "If we could
play Stanford every week I'd be
coach of the year."
"We kicked that final field goal
(with no time remaining in last
year's game) because Stanford
quit. We wanted to show them
how to play football."
Saturday at Stanford Stadium,
it was the Cardinals who showed
WSU how to play football. Mike
Boryla threw five touchdown
passes, Scott Laidlaw ran for 130
yards and the offensive line
contributed its finest effort of the
season as the vengeful Cardinals
overwhelmed WSU's sluggish
Cougars, 45-14.
"The players got themselves
ready to play this week,"
Stanford coach Jack Christiansen
said after the game. "We wanted
to win."
Maybe, though, Christiansen's
enthusiasm overflowed a little too
much on the playing field.
Stanford tried an onside kick in
the fourth quarter (the score at
the time was 42-7) and the Cards
called time-out with three seconds
left so Rod Garcia could attempt
a field goal, all ostensibly in the
cause of revenge.
'Bad Information'
Washington State coach Jim
Sweeney, who heard Christiansen
tell the press about the locker
room signs, denied ever making
any of the statements derogatory
to Stanford. "There is no way I
ever said that if we could play
Stanford every week I'd be coach
of the year. Either he's getting
bad information or is lying, and I
have never known Jack to lie.
"We have great respect for
Stanford. Chris did a super job of
preparing his players, both
physically and psychologically.

"I don't like to get beat and
get into an argument. They did a
great job."
It may be best to forget most
of the post-game comments, but
Sweeney's last statement can't be
disputed. Stanford, now 4-3 on
the season, indeed "did a great
job."
It all started on the Cards' first
possession, when Stanford
executed a methodical six-play
drive that covered 68 yards and
resulted in a Cardinal touchdown.
Laidlaw carried the ball four times
during the series for 38 yards, and
Boryla scrambled 25 yards on
another play from scrimmage. The
only pass play of the series was a
five-yard toss from Boryla to
Laidlaw for the score.
Garcia converted and it was 7-0
before many of the fans in the
student section had even taken
their shirts off.
New Formation
Stanford unveiled a new
offensive formation during the
drive, moving both tackles to the
strong side and moving Laidlaw
farther back from the line of
scrimmage (about six yards). The
formation paid off throughout the
game, especially for Laidlaw, who
said the new setup "gave me more
momentum. I could read the
defense better and either go
outside or cut upfield."
On Stanford's next possession,
which came after the Card defense
had stymied the Cougars on their
first offensive effort, Christiansen
came up with the most
imaginative play of the season.
Flanker Eric Test, a former
quarterback, took a handoff from
Boryla on a reverse and then set
up to pass. His toss was
underthrown, but split end Bill
Singler came back and made a
leaping catch for a 47-yard gain,
Stanford's longest advance from
scrimmage of the season.
"We put in the reverse play
early in the week, but I was
awfully nervous when Mike
[Boryla] called it in the huddle,"
Test said.
Two plays later, Test returned
to his receiver role and caught a
perfectly thrown eight-yard
scoring pass from Boryla. Garcia's
conversion made it 14-0, and
Stanford seemed to have an
insurmountable emotional

advantage, if not an
insurmountable edge on the
scoreboard.
'Emotional Game'
"Football is such an emotional
game," Boryla said afterward.
"That reverse pass really gave us a
psychological advantage."
Boryla kept passing and
Laidlaw kept running throughout
the remainder of the game,
resulting in several outstanding
statistical achievements. Laidlaw's
130-yard rushing total represented
the first time a Stanford runner
had gained over 100 yards since
John Winesberry rushed for 135
yards against West Virginia last
October. Laidlaw's 85-yard
production in the first half was
only three yards less than the
entire Cardinal team gained in its
first three games.
Boryla's five touchdown passes
established a new Stanford record
(Jim Plunkett threw four TD
tosses three times) and also tied
the Pac-8 mark set by California's
Craig Morton and Washington's
Chris Rowland.

But Boryla refused to take any
of the credit. "The offensive line
played very, very well," he said of
a maturing unit that played its
finest game of the season. "They
should get most of the credit for
those five TD passes."

Cardinal Notes: Freshman wide
receiver Tony Hill, who limped
off the field in the second quarter
after catching a seven-yard pass
from Boryla, will probably
undergo knee surgery this week.
The preliminary prognosis is
cartilage damage in his left knee.
Defensive player of the game
honors went to Card linebacker
John Snider, who was in on 13
tackles. Boryla earned the
offensive award on the basis of his
five touchdown tosses.
Boryla, however, felt that the
TD passes were of only minor
significance. "That touchdown
run that was called back [he ran
for 18 yards late in the second
quarter] was the highlight of my
Stanford career."
