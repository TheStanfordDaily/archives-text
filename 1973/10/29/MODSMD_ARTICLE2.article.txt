# USE, University Push For Disability Plan

University and United Stanford
Employees (USE) officials are pressing
hard for the approval of a new
disability plan for faculty and staff.
The new Self-Insured Voluntary
Disability Plan would provide
increased benefits to employees at a
reduced cost. It will replace the State
Disability Insurance (SDI) which
currently covers most employees.
The new plan would not affect
other programs of unemployment
insurance, nor is it expected to
complicate the benefit payments if
employees change jobs.
In order to make the plan
administratively and financially
feasible, 85 percent of the employees
now in SDI must vote to adopt the
Stanford Plan.
USE supports the new plan and has
been urging its members to vote
accordingly.
Advantages
Among the advantages of the plan
cited by the University are: 20 percent
drop in costs to the employee,
increases from $13 to $15 a day in
hospital benefits; utilization of any
surplus funds for the benefit of
employees; and more prompt payment
of disability claims. However, the
employee premium is not deductible
on income tax returns.
"The University felt if a plan could
be provided that cost less than the
particular plan now in use, we just

ought to do it," stated Joe Scroggs,
deputy director of Personnel and
Employee Relations.
"We figured utilization of the state
plan was such that the employee was
spending $2 in tax for only $1 in
benefits."
The state would still receive a small
percentage to cover expenses incurred
when employees leave the Stanford
plan and apply for state plan benefits.
"Some were concerned if they
change jobs that they would have to
be employed for a long time again
before they became eligible for
benefits under the state plan. State
officials have said this would not be
the case," said.
Approval
With "a couple thousand votes in,"
about 90 percent have voiced
approval, Scroggs said. Since the plan
is voluntary, employees may elect to
remain on the state plan even if the
new plan is utilized by 85 percent of
the other employees.
Jim Berk, newly-elected president
of USE, while somewhat doubtful of
the University's motives said he
supports the new plan and has worked
for its approval.
Berk approved of the "local
processing of disability claims, where
we can get a handle on it.
"By transferring the plan to local
control we could have a way of
dispersing the surplus that the state
usually hoards."
