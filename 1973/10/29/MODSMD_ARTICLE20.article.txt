# On The Ball
## Cardinal Emotion Returns 
### Jim Wascher 
For the first time since the
1972 Rose Bowl, emotional
football has returned to Stanford,
and it suits the Cardinals well.
After Saturday's 45-14 rout
over Washington State, linebacker
Forrie Martin explained, "We
changed our style of playing.
Instead of being classy, we
decided to get emotional. When
you decide to start playing like a
wild team, you start winning."
During their first six games, the
Cardinals were anything but wild.
After drubbings at the hands of
Penn State, Michigan and UCLA,
they even had trouble fending off
weak, but troublesome,
Washington one week ago.
Strangely enough, Washington

State coach Jim Sweeney proved
to be the Prince Charming whose
"kiss" awakened Stanford's
sleeping beauties.
Sweeney Quotes
Before Saturday's encounter
with the Cougars, Stanford
coaches had posted a sign in the
team locker room quoting
Sweeney as saying, "If we could
play Stanford every week, I'd be
coach of the year." (After the
game, Sweeney denied ever saying
this.)
Most players mentioned
Sweeney's words as a factor in the
Cardinals' win. Linebacker Gordie
Riegel also recalled last year's
27-13 loss at the hands of the
Cougars, when Sweeney called

time out with three seconds
remaining in the game to kick a
field goal.
Another sign posted in the
locker room quoted Sweeney as
saying, "We kicked that field goal
because Stanford quit. We wanted
to show them how to play
football."
Wide receiver Bill Singler, who
caught two touchdown passes in
Saturday's game, said, "Stuff like
that gets a team fired up." Riegel
said the game was "a matter of
revenge for both the players and
the coaches."
'Best-Coached Game'
According to Riegel, coach
Jack Christiansen had told the
players, " 'Let's put this one
together for a change.' " Riegel
said Saturday's was "the
best-coached game we've had all
year."
Riegel's comment is especially
revealing, in that there had been
considerable dissatisfaction on the
team prior to the Cards' victory.
But Christiansen effectively used
Sweeney's remarks to snap
Stanford out of its self-hypnosis.
The Cardinals have four more
games this season. If they win all
of them, they have an outside
shot at a trip to Pasadena. The
biggest stumbling block, of
course, will be the Trojans of
use.
The emotion for the Nov. 10
contest in the Coliseum has been
building since USC's 30-21 victory
over Stanford last year, after
which Coach John McKay told
reporters that he would have liked
to beat Stanford by 2000 points.
Christiansen and his players
will need every drop of emotion
they can muster in order to beat
USC. On Saturday, they proved to
themselves that they could still
have fun winning an emotional
game.
Forrie Martin predicted that
"if we play with the intensity we
played with today, SC better
vatch out." 2000 points, indeed!

you decide to start playing like a
wild team, you start winning."
During their first six games, the
Cardinals were anything but wild.
After drubbings at the hands of
Penn State, Michigan and UCLA,
they even had trouble fending off
weak, but troublesome,
Washington one week ago.
Strangely enough, Washington

"kiss" awakened Stanford's

Sweeney Quotes
Before Saturday's encounter
with the Cougars, Stanford
coaches had posted a sign in the
team locker room quoting
Sweeney as saying, "If we could
play Stanford every week, I'd be
coach of the year." (After the
game, Sweeney denied ever saying
this.)
Most players mentioned
Sweeney's words as a factor in the
Cardinals' win. Linebacker Gordie
Riegel also recalled last year's
27-13 loss at the hands of the
Cougars, when Sweeney called

time out with three seconds
remaining in the game to kick a
field goal.
Another sign posted in the
locker room quoted Sweeney as
saying, "We kicked that field goal
because Stanford quit. We wanted
to show them how to play
football."
Wide receiver Bill Singler, who
caught two touchdown passes in
Saturday's game, said, "Stuff like
that gets a team fired up." Riegel
said the game was "a matter of
revenge for both the players and
the coaches."
'Best-Coached Game'
According to Riegel, coach
Jack Christiansen had told the
players, " 'Let's put this one
together for a change.' " Riegel
said Saturday's was "the
best-coached game we've had all
year."
Riegel's comment is especially
revealing, in that there had been
considerable dissatisfaction on the
team prior to the Cards' victory.
But Christiansen effectively used
Sweeney's remarks to snap
Stanford out of its self-hypnosis.
The Cardinals have four more
games this season. If they win all
of them, they have an outside
shot at a trip to Pasadena. The
biggest stumbling block, of
course, will be the Trojans of
use.
The emotion for the Nov. 10
contest in the Coliseum has been
building since USC's 30-21 victory
over Stanford last year, after
which Coach John McKay told
reporters that he would have liked
to beat Stanford by 2000 points.
Christiansen and his players
will need every drop of emotion
they can muster in order to beat
USC. On Saturday, they proved to
themselves that they could still
have fun winning an emotional
game.
Forrie Martin predicted that
"if we play with the intensity we
played with today, SC better
vatch out." 2000 points, indeed!
For the first time since the
1972 Rose Bowl, emotional
football has returned to Stanford,
and it suits the Cardinals well.
After Saturday's 45-14 rout
over Washington State, linebacker
Forrie Martin explained, "We
changed our style of playing.
Instead of being classy, we
decided to get emotional. When
you decide to start playing like a
wild team, you start winning."
