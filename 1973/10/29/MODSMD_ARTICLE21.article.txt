## Fighting Irish Snap USC Unbeaten Streak 
### 
Notre Dame avenged six years
of frustration Saturday in South
Bend, Ind., as the Fighting Irish
ended USC's 23-game non-losing
streak with a solid 23-14 win.
The Irish defense was the
dominant factor, holding the
vaunted Trojan running attack to
68 total yards. Notre Dame,
meanwhile, piled up 316 yards on
the ground, including an 85-yard
touchdown dash by Eric Penick
which sewed up the contest in the
third quarter.
Trojan coach John McKay
admitted USC's chances for a
second straight national crown
were "eliminated."
As if its earlier thrashing of
Stanford wasn't enough, UCLA
felt obliged to run California right
out of the 100-degree Los Angeles
Coliseum, 61-21. Cal was
cooperative, turning over the ball
five times, resulting in four Bruin
touchdowns. Coach Mike White
feared his team was "almost in
awe" of UCLA.
Oregon may well have nailed
the coffin on coach Jim Owens'
career at Washington as the Ducks
embarrassed the Huskies, 58-0.
Washington, now last in the
Pacific Eight and 1-6 overall,
failed to get a first down until the
second half.
Oregon State, the nation's 10th
worst team according to one
unofficial poll, went outside the
conference to get routed this
week. The lucky murderer was
llth-ranked Arizona State, which
used fullback Ben Malone's five
touchdowns to rout the hapless
Beavers, 44-14. Oregon State
hosts Stanford Saturday.
