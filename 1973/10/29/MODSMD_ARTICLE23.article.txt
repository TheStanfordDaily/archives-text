# Cardt Win Weekend Garnet
## Poloists Ready For USC 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Stanford's water polo team
tuned up for its upcoming Pacific
Eight match with USC this Friday
by defeating Chico State 11-5 and
UC-Santa Barbara 7-6 over the
weekend at Encina Pool.
The Cards jumped off to a 4-2
first half lead over Chico Friday as
the Card offense moved the ball
effectively. Stanford added two
goals in the third period and five
in the fourth quarter, while Chico
added three in the final quarter to

round out the scoring.
Tom Warden led the Cards
with four goals, Rick Gebers and
Tom Purcell scored two goals and
Dean Anderson, Tom Cummings
and Larry Mann added one goal
each in the effort.
The UC-Santa Barbara Guachos
were in Saturday's game until the
last quarter but the Cards held on
to win 7-6. Stanford jumped off
to a 3-1 lead in the first quarter,
but the Guachos came back in the
second period with two goals
while the Cards could manage
only one, to tie the score 4-4 at
the half.
Santa Barbara took the lead
after half by scoring two goals
while the Cards could manage
only one. However Warden rallied
the Cards in the fourth quarter by
scoring twice, to give the Cards
the win, 7-6.
Santa Barbara had a scoring
opportunity in the last 30 seconds
of the game, as they were in
Cardinal territory with goalie
Cummings coming out of the nets
to retrieve the ball. The Gauchos
got to the ball first but they
misfired on a shot, hitting the
support post of the goal.
Next weekend will be a tough

one for the Cards as they take on
USC on Friday and San Jose State
on Saturday. USC upset California
7-6 on Friday in Los Angeles,
handing the Bears their only loss
of the year. San Jose State was
the NCAA runnerup last year, but
the Cards defeated the Spartans
earlier this year, 5-4.
"This weekend will be very
important to us. We've got a good
chance to beat SC, and we have to
defeat them to have any chance to
go to NCAA's," said Gaughran.
"We would hope that we can
play SC in the new pool. Joe
Ruetz [Stanford Athletic
Director] has not gotten into the
act to try to speed things up,"
said Gaughran.
Today the Cards will play Cal
State Hayward in Encina Pool at
3:30 p.m. "We must play our best
if we are to beat Hayward — we
can't take them for granted. Cal
took SC lightly and the Trojans
beat 'em," said Gaughran.
The junior varsity team
defeated College of San Mateo
Saturday in San Mateo. Steve
Wheeler led the Stanford scoring
with four goals.

Stanford's water polo team
tuned up for its upcoming Pacific
Eight match with USC this Friday
by defeating Chico State 11-5 and
UC-Santa Barbara 7-6 over the
weekend at Encina Pool.
The Cards jumped off to a 4-2
first half lead over Chico Friday as
the Card offense moved the ball
effectively. Stanford added two
goals in the third period and five
in the fourth quarter, while Chico
added three in the final quarter to

round out the scoring.
Tom Warden led the Cards
with four goals, Rick Gebers and
Tom Purcell scored two goals and
Dean Anderson, Tom Cummings
and Larry Mann added one goal
each in the effort.
The UC-Santa Barbara Guachos
were in Saturday's game until the
last quarter but the Cards held on
to win 7-6. Stanford jumped off
to a 3-1 lead in the first quarter,
but the Guachos came back in the
second period with two goals
while the Cards could manage
only one, to tie the score 4-4 at
the half.
Santa Barbara took the lead
after half by scoring two goals
while the Cards could manage
only one. However Warden rallied
the Cards in the fourth quarter by
scoring twice, to give the Cards
the win, 7-6.
Santa Barbara had a scoring
opportunity in the last 30 seconds
of the game, as they were in
Cardinal territory with goalie
Cummings coming out of the nets
to retrieve the ball. The Gauchos
got to the ball first but they
misfired on a shot, hitting the
support post of the goal.
Next weekend will be a tough

one for the Cards as they take on
USC on Friday and San Jose State
on Saturday. USC upset California
7-6 on Friday in Los Angeles,
handing the Bears their only loss
of the year. San Jose State was
the NCAA runnerup last year, but
the Cards defeated the Spartans
earlier this year, 5-4.
"This weekend will be very
important to us. We've got a good
chance to beat SC, and we have to
defeat them to have any chance to
go to NCAA's," said Gaughran.
"We would hope that we can
play SC in the new pool. Joe
Ruetz [Stanford Athletic
Director] has not gotten into the
act to try to speed things up,"
said Gaughran.
Today the Cards will play Cal
State Hayward in Encina Pool at
3:30 p.m. "We must play our best
if we are to beat Hayward — we
can't take them for granted. Cal
took SC lightly and the Trojans
beat 'em," said Gaughran.
The junior varsity team
defeated College of San Mateo
Saturday in San Mateo. Steve
Wheeler led the Stanford scoring
with four goals.
