# NCIAC Women's Relays
## Swim Team Finishes Second 
### MARCY O'KEEFE 
When no bus appeared at 7:30 a.m. Saturday to
take Stanford's women's varsity swim team to
Hayward and the NCIAC relays, it looked as if the
day just might not turn out as expected.
However, with a little ingenuity and mad
scrambling, Stanford's 28 women swimmers
managed to arrive on time at Hayward in private
cars, establish two new records for the season and
place second out of 11 schools, losing to
Sacramento State by only six points.
Stanford's 400-yard medley relay team,
consisting of Kathy Hays, Kathy Heinze, Vicki King
and Mei Ong set an NCIAC record of 4:19.9 and the
200-yard breastroke relay team of Diane Dillon,
Jennifer Eagleston, Vicki Hays and Mei Ong set
another NCIAC mark of 2:19.4.
Total point scores showed Sacramento State,
Stanford and UC-Davis to be this year's three
toughest competitors in the conference with scores
of 124, 118 and 116 points, respectively. Cal State
Hayward placed fourth with 64 points, showing a
definite split between Sacramento, Stanford and
UC-Davis and the other nine schools in the
conference.
Top 10
Out of the 12 events held, Stanford placed either
first, second or third in 10, taking four first places,
three seconds, three thirds, one fourth and one

sixth. The team was divided up into "A" teams and
"B" teams, with all of Stanford's "A" teams making
the finals.
"We were pretty much ahead as far as point
scores during the first half," said Stanford coach
Betsy Weeks, "but Sacramento's strength came
through in the second half. It was so close that by
the end no one was sure who had won and we had
to wait for the scores to be announced.
"I think what made the difference was the fact
that Sacramento's "B" teams placed in two events,
along with their "A" teams' four first places."
School Records
Stanford's 100-yard medley relay team of
Jennifer Eagleston, Laurie Gill, Marge Meek and Sue
Trupin set a new school record, clocking 57.6, and
the 100-yard freestyle relay team of Diane Dillon,
Jennifer Eagleston, Martha Lee and Nanette
Leuschel tied Stanford's record of 51.0.
"The team showed lots of improvement on
individual times," Weeks said, "and I think this
boosted our enthusiasm. Sacramento and UC-Davis
showed that they'll provide stiff competition but I
still think we have a good chance at taking the
Championships in December."
Stanford's team will take on Santa Clara in its
third meet of the season at the Lagunita Pool this
Wednesday at 3 p.m.
