# Sandoval Wins Cross Country Title
## 
### MARK WHITE 
Despite a victorious individual
performance by Tony Sandoval,
Stanford's cross country team
could manage only a third place
finish behind champion Cal and
runner-up UCLA in Saturday's
Pacific-Eight Southern Division
cross country championships held
on Stanford's six-mile course.
Sandoval, a soft-spoken
sophomore from Los Alamos,
New Mexico, took the individual
championship with a solid
29:11.6, only eight seconds
slower than his record time of a
week before. But Jack Bellah was
the only other Cardinal placing in
the top 10 and Cal won the meet
by bunching a 29.39 third place
performance by Greg Hall with
sixth and seventh places by Bears
Brian Maxwell and Brad Duffey.
Those three places in the
middle of the first 10 gave Cal the
championship with 40 points.
UCLA parlayed second, fourth
and tenth places for the runner-up
spot with 53 points, barely edging
Stanford's 55 points for third
place. USC did not officially place
since the Trojans failed to field
the necessary number of
competitors.
Happy Coach
Cal's obviously pleased coach,
Bill Frost, said after the meet,
"We had our best team effort. We
expected Hall, Maxwell and
Duffey to do well, but the real
surprise was the way our

sophomore, Martin Dean,
performed."
Cal's top -unner, Hall, agreed.
"We did the lest we could," said
the junior trtisfer from Fresno.
"Although thit course has a lot of
sharp turns, I lice it and I'm glad
we're going to be running on it in
the league finals two weeks from
now. It will give an edge to our
team and Stanford"
Stanford coach Marshall Clark
was not too disappointed in his
team's showing. "Considering
nearly everyone on the team had
personal bests in last week's meet,
it's understandable that we were
down a little this week â€” two
meets in one week is tough. Cal
stood up well and did a fine job.
UCLA thought they should have
won, and if we hadn't had a few
minor injuries, we might have
done better."
'Top Three Or Four'
While most of the coaches
agreed the team championship
battle in the Nov. 10 meet will be
between Washington State and
Steve Prefontaine-led Oregon,
they also felt Sandoval would do
well individually. Cal's Frost and
the UCLA coach both said
Sandoval should "place in the top
three or four."
"We think Sandy can run
under 29:00," added Clark, "and
anything under 29:00 should put
you near the top. With two weeks
to get over his minor hurts, Sandy
should be in top form."
