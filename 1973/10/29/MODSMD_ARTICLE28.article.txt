# Cards Shut Out Humboldt
## Booters Stomp Two Foes 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
Two impressive victories
highlighted the weekend for
Stanford's soccer team. Saturday,
the Cards traveled to Monterey,
where they downed the Naval
Post Graduate school, 6-2.
Yesterday, Cal State-Humboldt
was the victim, 8-0, on Stanford's
home field.
Brian Bershader and Johnny

Murao got two goals
Saturday to lead the Cardinal
effort. Mac Taylor and Walter
Robb each put one shot by the
goalie to round out the scoring.
Against Humboldt, Stanford
started out fast, scoring twice in
the first 10 minutes of the game.
Phil Wright scored first on a fine
individual effort and Bershader
made the score 2-0, kicking in a
pass from Murao.

Humboldt played tough
throughout the rest of the
opening half, and well into the
second period, but then the roof
fell in. Bershader got his second
goal of the game to start the
Cardinal scoring spree.
Marty Glickfeld and Robb
added one goal apiece, and Ricky
Caldwell scored twice for a
comfortable 7-0 margin.
Goalie Walt Harris, who held
Humboldt scoreless for the first
75 minutes of the game, moved to
forward towards the end, and
knocked in the Cards' final score.
Stanford controlled the ball
well during the game, making
precision passes, both by kicking
and heading. Humboldt passed
poorly, and the Cards' ability to
take advantage of this gave them
the easy win.
Besides the eight shots that got
by two Humboldt goalies, the
Cards missed many chances for
easy goals with rushed shots that
were too high or just wide.
Humboldt had a few chances to
get on the scoreboard, but
Stanford's overall defensive effort
managed to keep the ball away
from the goal on the whole.
Glickfeld and Bobby Geiger
now have five goals apiece, to lead
the scoring for the season. This
shutout marked the fifth time this
year that Stanford was able to
hold its opponent scoreless.
Wednesday, the Cards, now
7-4, travel to San Francisco State
for a 3 p.m. contest.
