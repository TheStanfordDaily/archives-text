# Cagers loaded With Talent

### STAN WILSON 
"We have too much talent this year to go
0-26," quipped Stanford's talented sophomore
post man Tim Patterson during the Cards'
annual Press Day Saturday.
A dozen Bay Area sportswriters gathered at
Maples Pavilion to watch the players pose for
publicity shots and listen to the coaches mix
accolades with carefully-worded skepticisms,
but the consensus of most is that Stanford is
loaded with talent this year.
Coming off their first winning season in six
years, (14-11) the Cards have the height and
the depth to improve on that record.
Seven-foot center Rich Kelley, an
All-Conference selection last year, and"the
only guy ever to step over the Great Wall of
China," according to Sports Information
director Bob Murphy, should lead Stanford to
another winning season.
A winning season if the Cards stay healthy,
that is. Forward Dave Frost, a 6-6 senior, is
suffering recurring back problems, a condition
that cut into his playing time last season.
Senior post man Mike Mann is recovering
quickly from knee surgery, but should be ready
for the Cards' opener against Nevada-Reno on
Nov. 30 at Maples Pavilion.
Frost reported to opening practice 20
pounds lighter this year, while former
toothpicks Kelley and Patterson have gained
weight, which should improve their
effectiveness.
All of Stanford's post men should see plenty
of action. "I like to have Kelley get about five
minutes rest in the first half so he can go as
strong in the second," said head coach Howie
Dallmar, pointing to the Cards' depth and
"flexibility."
Junior Scott Trobbe (6-7) is one versatile
performer capable of playing both offensive
forward and defensive guard. Both Mann and
Patterson may play the offensive post position
as well as defensive forward. Junior Mel
Arterberry (6-3) is capable of playing as both a
guard and a swing man.
The Cards had their first scrimmage Friday,
an effort Dallmar labeled "disappointing."
Kelley scored 29 points and snared 19 rebounds
as Bub Bowling's Red team trounced Billy
Jones' Whites, 102-61.

effectiveness.
All of Stanford's post men should see plenty
of action. "I like to have Kelley get about five
minutes rest in the first half so he can go as
strong in the second," said head coach Howie
Dallmar, pointing to the Cards' depth and
"flexibility."
Junior Scott Trobbe (6-7) is one versatile
performer capable of playing both offensive
forward and defensive guard. Both Mann and
Patterson may play the offensive post position
as well as defensive forward. Junior Mel
Arterberry (6-3) is capable of playing as both a
guard and a swing man.
The Cards had their first scrimmage Friday,
an effort Dallmar labeled "disappointing."
Kelley scored 29 points and snared 19 rebounds
as Bub Bowling's Red team trounced Billy
Jones' Whites, 102-61.
