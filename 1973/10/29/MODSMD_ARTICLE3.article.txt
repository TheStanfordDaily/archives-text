# HEW Task Force Urges Support For Needs Of Individual Students
## 
### BILL ROSS 
Widespread extension of higher
education opportunities necessitates
reevaluation of the values, goals and
methods of university training,
according to an HEW task force
headed by Frank Newman, director of
University Relations here.
The task force report, issued in
Washington Saturday, urged innovative
federal programs that focus attention
on the needs of individual students
rather than on educational institutions
themselves.
"We recommend that, wherever
feasible, federal support for
post-secondary education flow to
students rather than to institutions,"
the report stated. "To the extent
appropriate in each program, the
question, 'who gets what?' should be

determined by student choice rather
than legislative formulas or
administrative decisions."
Outside Classroom
The report also advocated
increasing the exposure of students to
activities of society outside traditional
classroom situations.
It called for federal legislation to
create a "G.I. Bill for Community
Service," designed to permit students
to receive federal aid for participation
in national, regional or local service
programs.
The task force also recommended
reform in graduate school funding. As
an acknowledgement of standards of
excellence in certain departments of
otherwise undistinguished universities,
the report suggested the establishment
of "portable fellowships" allocated
directly to students, along with
companion grants to the schools they
choose to attend.
The growing number of vocational
junior colleges has increased the
number of educated people to the
extent that federal programs must
begin to emphasize the specific
benefits to society that a graduate will
contribute, the report declared. A
general education is not as valuable as
it once was, it said.
Special Skills
Greater emphasis should be placed
on special skills, while grades and
standardized test scores should no
longer be all-important criteria in the
evaluation of individual academic
performance, the report contended.
"Only in the last 20 years, with the
flood of new students, has the concept
of academic selectivity become firmly
established," the report said. "Not

only did Harvard, Yale, Princeton and
Stanford become selective; so did
Michigan, Berkeley and North
Carolina.
"But as society and post-secondary
education become more egalitarian,
the issue is cannot be simply how the
student compares with his peers.
Rather, of increasing importance are
the questions as to the student's
potential, how far he has developed in
terms of his potential, what he wants
to do and how the college can assist
him."
The increase in college enrollment
indicates that while a degree will still
be necessary for upward mobility, a
diploma in itself will not insure entry
into higher paying occupations,
according to the task force report.
College Opportunities
"It is ironic, but inevitable, that
just as college opportunities are finally
within the reach of so many new
students, the colleges are losing their
capacity for occupational placement,"
the report noted.
While there may be a general
underemployment of college graduates
in the next few years, this will become
less of a problem after 1980, when the
low birth rate of the 1960s will result
in a decline in the growth of college
enrollment, the report predicted.
In fact, the adjustment of the job
market to the influx of well educated
people may create brighter
opportunities for college graduates,
the report said. For example, the
growing expertise needed in police
work may require policemen to obtain
college degrees.
Yet the task force warned that
college experience can be preparation

for a future career only if students are
motivated to focus attention on
vocational aspirations. Participation in
special community programs can
facilitate awareness of career
opportunities, and recurrent education
— periodic return to the classroom by
adults — are also important, the report
added.

Central to the goal of improved
utilization of educational resources is
the encouragement of flexibility and
openness in education. Much of the
current red tape and rigid bureaucracy
of higher education must be
eliminated to increase expanded local
autonomy essential to flexibility, the
group contended.
Focus on individual skills,
individual financial aid and student
participation in community programs
should be a major step in this
direction, the report said.
