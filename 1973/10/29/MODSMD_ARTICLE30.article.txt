# Arizona Captures Women's Golf Title
## 
### LIZ CHIANG 
Arizona, with a 329
two-person team total, easily
won the ninth annual Stanford
Women's Invitational golf
tournament held Thursday and
Friday on the Stanford course.
Eleven college teams from the
Southwest competed in the
36-hole, medal play tournament
in which UCLA came in a
surprising second with 343 and
Arizona State shot 346 to place
third.
Alex Rhinehardt of New
Mexico took individual honors
with a six over par 157 total,
edging defending champion
Barbara Vetrano of San
Francisco State by one stroke.
Arizona's Paula Eger came in
third with 162, followed by
Hayward State's Cheryl Pastore
and Pam Palmieri of Santa Rosa
with 164 and 166 respectively.
Arizona's Melanie Schiller and
UCLA's Carl Cinder tied with
167. Pat Cornett, Stanford's lone
entry, placed ninth at 169.
Ginder led the second round
with 78, redeeming her score of
89 from the first mund.
Stanford didn't participate in
team competition since Chris

Browning had strep throat.
Stanford coach Carol Diaz
believed Comett might have done
better if teammate Browning had
played. "Psychologically, it's not
easy to be out there alone," Diaz
said.
Diaz, who has coached at
Stanford since 1955, was pleased
with the results of the
tournament. She said the girls
found the course tough and that
putting seemed to present the
greatest challenge.
Rhinehardt, remarking about
the Stanford course, said, "I had
a hard time concentrating on the
game because of the beautiful
scenery.
"I played kind of sloppy,
steady but sloppy," she said.
Nevertheless, she and Eger
planned to celebrate their
victories with "the best dinner
on the wharf."
Stanford will have a practice
match this Friday against
Hayward State and Santa Clara
at the Spring Valley Country
Club. The Cards will travel to
Arizona State November 28 and
29 to compete in the Sun Devil
Invitational.
