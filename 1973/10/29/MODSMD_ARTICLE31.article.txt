Evidence Remains Says Cox
WASHINGTON — Former Watergate special
prosecutor Archibald Cox said yesterday the
presidential tape recordings over which he was fired
"were clearly only a first step in seeking a great deal
of important evidence from the White House."
Cox said that as part of an investigation of
campaign contributions he would have sought
accounts of a meeting between President Nixon and
former Agriculture secretary Clifford A. Hardin
which dealt with milk pricing.
The White House has refused to make such
material available in connection with a civil court
suit questioning a milk price hike granted by Hardin
soon after dairy interests pledged $2 million for
Nixon's 1972 campaign.
Alexander M. Haig, Jr., Nixon's chief of staff,
would not say whether accounts of the
Hardin-Nixon meeting would be made available to a
new Watergate prosecutor. He said the question was
hypothetical because Cox had never asked for that
material.
Haig said he was "confident with a reasonable
degree of good will that all of the information that
the next special prosecutor will require will be made
available to him in the form that is necessary for
him to conduct his operation."
But Haig added: "Under no circumstances would
we ever be true to the preservation of the powers of
the office of the president to permit any
investigator a fishing, free rein fishing expedition,
into the vital discussions that occur in the
president's office."
Cox appeared on the NBC television show "Meet
the Press." Haig appeared on CBS' "Face the
Nation."
Rep. Ford Loan Allegation Denied
WASHINGTON — A spokesman for Vice
President-designate Gerald R. Ford says a report
that Ford failed to repay a $15,000 loan from a
former lobbyist is a lie.
The charge was contained in an affidavit of
Robert Winter-Berger filed with the Senate Rules
Committee, which must approve Ford's nomination.
Columnist Jack Anderson published an account
in Sunday's newspaper editions based on the
document.
In the affidavit, Winter-Berger said:
"Between 1966 and September of 1969 I
personally loaned Gerlad Ford in the neighborhood
of $15,000. This money was delivered to Ford in
cash to cover an illness and hospitalization of his
wife... This money came from my personal
income and I paid taxes on it. This money was never
repaid. I never asked for repayment and it was never
offered."

Ford's spokesman, Paul Miltich, said the charges
about the loan were "a categorical lie." He said
Ford maintained high-option Blue Cross and Blue
Shield insurance which covered virtually all the
medical expenses.
Convoy Reaches Trapped Army
TEL AVIV — The lead vehicles of a 100-truck
convoy arrived with food, water and medicine
yesterday for the 3rd Egyptian Army choked off in
the hostile Sinai Desert by a ring of Israeli tanks, Tel
Aviv reported.
A second convoy also was allowed to carry
medical supplies to the besieged city of Suez at the
southern end of the Suez Canal, Israeli spokesmen
said.
The first trucks rolled through Israeli lines on the
west bank of the Suez Canal following a face-to-face
predawn meeting between senior Israeli and
Egyptian officers on a bleak stretch of Egyptian
sand, the Israelis said.
The Tel Aviv command claimed Egyptian
holdouts attacked Israeli forces south of the
beleaguered 3rd Army several times and that some
of the 3rd Army troops fired on the convoy as it
pulled into their parched desert trap. Egypt was
warned the convoy would be stopped short if the
firing continued.
Israeli Premier Golda Meir said she was happy the
Israeli-Egyptian meeting took place after years of
mutual isolation. She added:
"But to say that this leads directly to peace
quickly, I can't say that. It's a start that people
begin to talk."
The 1:30 a.m. encounter, about 60 miles from
Cairo near a dry gully called Wadi al-Jandali, marked
the first time Egyptians and Israelis have openly
conferred at such a high official level since Oct. 29,
1956, the Israeli military command said.
Cambodia Fighting Continues
PHNOM PENH — Government forces fought to
clear Phnom Penh's southern approaches of
insurgent troops yesterday, as rebel forces cut
Highway 5, 12 miles northwest of the capital.
At the same time, the U.S. Embassy said Maj.
Vincent Gomez, an assistant defense attache, had
returned to the capital after being lightly wounded
Saturday on the capital's southern front.
Gomez was reportedly observing government
forces in frontline combat when he was hit in the
arm by a bullet.
Field reports said insurgents virtually controlled
a stretch of Highway 5 from Phum Kruos to Prek
Taten, a distance of some 2 x /i miles.
Insurgents have held a 10-mile section of
Highway 5 north of Sala Lek Pram, about 35 miles

northwest of Phnom Penh, since Sept. 6.
Fire Rages Near San Diego
MORENA VILLAGE, Calif. — One thousand fire
fighters continued to fight an uncontrolled blaze
yesterday which destroyed more than 8000 acres
and gutted 12 structures in Cleveland National
Forest.
Authorities said they were uncertain when the
roaring blaze, concentrated in chaparral brush at the
4000-foot level near this lakeside resort community,
could be controlled. The San Diego County sheriff's
office said residents of this 125-population
community were evacuated to a nearby church after
flames roared through the area Saturday night.
Damage was estimated at $250,000.
Kemper Attempts Suicide
REDWOOD CITY - Edmund Emil Kemper 111,
the 6-9, 280 pound man on trial on charges of
killing eight women, tried to commit suicide by
slashing his wrist early yesterday morning, sheriff's
deputies said.
Guards rushed to Kemper's cell in the San Mateo
County Jail in Redwood City about 3:40 a.m. and
found Kemper had slashed his right wrist with a
flattened, sharpened ball point pen, Sgt. Robert
Cancilla said.
Cancilla said Kemper resisted efforts to help him
and had to be handcuffed before he could be put in
the ambulance. Kemper was taken to the Kaiser
Foundation Hospital in Redwood City, where six
stitches were required to close the wound.
On May 28, two days before his scheduled
arraignment, officials said Kemper twice tried to
commit suicide by puncturing an artery in his wrist
with a ball point pen clip.

sand, the Israelis said.
The Tel Aviv command claimed Egyptian
holdouts attacked Israeli forces south of the
beleaguered 3rd Army several times and that some
of the 3rd Army troops fired on the convoy as it
pulled into their parched desert trap. Egypt was
warned the convoy would be stopped short if the
firing continued.
Israeli Premier Golda Meir said she was happy the
Israeli-Egyptian meeting took place after years of
mutual isolation. She added:
"But to say that this leads directly to peace
quickly, I can't say that. It's a start that people
begin to talk."
The 1:30 a.m. encounter, about 60 miles from
Cairo near a dry gully called Wadi al-Jandali, marked
the first time Egyptians and Israelis have openly
conferred at such a high official level since Oct. 29,
1956, the Israeli military command said.
Cambodia Fighting Continues
PHNOM PENH — Government forces fought to
clear Phnom Penh's southern approaches of
insurgent troops yesterday, as rebel forces cut
Highway 5, 12 miles northwest of the capital.
At the same time, the U.S. Embassy said Maj.
Vincent Gomez, an assistant defense attache, had
returned to the capital after being lightly wounded
Saturday on the capital's southern front.
Gomez was reportedly observing government
forces in frontline combat when he was hit in the
arm by a bullet.
Field reports said insurgents virtually controlled
a stretch of Highway 5 from Phum Kruos to Prek
Taten, a distance of some 2 x /i miles.
Insurgents have held a 10-mile section of
Highway 5 north of Sala Lek Pram, about 35 miles

northwest of Phnom Penh, since Sept. 6.
Fire Rages Near San Diego
MORENA VILLAGE, Calif. — One thousand fire
fighters continued to fight an uncontrolled blaze
yesterday which destroyed more than 8000 acres
and gutted 12 structures in Cleveland National
Forest.
Authorities said they were uncertain when the
roaring blaze, concentrated in chaparral brush at the
4000-foot level near this lakeside resort community,
could be controlled. The San Diego County sheriff's
office said residents of this 125-population
community were evacuated to a nearby church after
flames roared through the area Saturday night.
Damage was estimated at $250,000.
Kemper Attempts Suicide
REDWOOD CITY - Edmund Emil Kemper 111,
the 6-9, 280 pound man on trial on charges of
killing eight women, tried to commit suicide by
slashing his wrist early yesterday morning, sheriff's
deputies said.
Guards rushed to Kemper's cell in the San Mateo
County Jail in Redwood City about 3:40 a.m. and
found Kemper had slashed his right wrist with a
flattened, sharpened ball point pen, Sgt. Robert
Cancilla said.
Cancilla said Kemper resisted efforts to help him
and had to be handcuffed before he could be put in
the ambulance. Kemper was taken to the Kaiser
Foundation Hospital in Redwood City, where six
stitches were required to close the wound.
On May 28, two days before his scheduled
arraignment, officials said Kemper twice tried to
commit suicide by puncturing an artery in his wrist
with a ball point pen clip.

Evidence Remains Says Cox
WASHINGTON — Former Watergate special
prosecutor Archibald Cox said yesterday the
presidential tape recordings over which he was fired
"were clearly only a first step in seeking a great deal
of important evidence from the White House."
Cox said that as part of an investigation of
campaign contributions he would have sought
accounts of a meeting between President Nixon and
former Agriculture secretary Clifford A. Hardin
which dealt with milk pricing.
The White House has refused to make such
material available in connection with a civil court
suit questioning a milk price hike granted by Hardin
soon after dairy interests pledged $2 million for
Nixon's 1972 campaign.
Alexander M. Haig, Jr., Nixon's chief of staff,
would not say whether accounts of the
Hardin-Nixon meeting would be made available to a
new Watergate prosecutor. He said the question was
hypothetical because Cox had never asked for that
material.
Haig said he was "confident with a reasonable
degree of good will that all of the information that
the next special prosecutor will require will be made
available to him in the form that is necessary for
him to conduct his operation."
But Haig added: "Under no circumstances would
we ever be true to the preservation of the powers of
the office of the president to permit any
investigator a fishing, free rein fishing expedition,
into the vital discussions that occur in the
president's office."
Cox appeared on the NBC television show "Meet
the Press." Haig appeared on CBS' "Face the
Nation."
Rep. Ford Loan Allegation Denied
WASHINGTON — A spokesman for Vice
President-designate Gerald R. Ford says a report
that Ford failed to repay a $15,000 loan from a
former lobbyist is a lie.
The charge was contained in an affidavit of
Robert Winter-Berger filed with the Senate Rules
Committee, which must approve Ford's nomination.
Columnist Jack Anderson published an account
in Sunday's newspaper editions based on the
document.
In the affidavit, Winter-Berger said:
"Between 1966 and September of 1969 I
personally loaned Gerlad Ford in the neighborhood
of $15,000. This money was delivered to Ford in
cash to cover an illness and hospitalization of his
wife... This money came from my personal
income and I paid taxes on it. This money was never
repaid. I never asked for repayment and it was never
offered."

Ford's spokesman, Paul Miltich, said the charges
about the loan were "a categorical lie." He said
Ford maintained high-option Blue Cross and Blue
Shield insurance which covered virtually all the
medical expenses.
Convoy Reaches Trapped Army
TEL AVIV — The lead vehicles of a 100-truck
convoy arrived with food, water and medicine
yesterday for the 3rd Egyptian Army choked off in
the hostile Sinai Desert by a ring of Israeli tanks, Tel
Aviv reported.
A second convoy also was allowed to carry
medical supplies to the besieged city of Suez at the
southern end of the Suez Canal, Israeli spokesmen
said.
The first trucks rolled through Israeli lines on the
west bank of the Suez Canal following a face-to-face

Evidence Remains Says Cox
WASHINGTON — Former Watergate special
prosecutor Archibald Cox said yesterday the
presidential tape recordings over which he was fired
"were clearly only a first step in seeking a great deal
of important evidence from the White House."
Cox said that as part of an investigation of
campaign contributions he would have sought
accounts of a meeting between President Nixon and
former Agriculture secretary Clifford A. Hardin
which dealt with milk pricing.
The White House has refused to make such
material available in connection with a civil court
suit questioning a milk price hike granted by Hardin
soon after dairy interests pledged $2 million for
Nixon's 1972 campaign.
Alexander M. Haig, Jr., Nixon's chief of staff,
would not say whether accounts of the
Hardin-Nixon meeting would be made available to a
new Watergate prosecutor. He said the question was
hypothetical because Cox had never asked for that
material.
Haig said he was "confident with a reasonable
degree of good will that all of the information that
the next special prosecutor will require will be made
available to him in the form that is necessary for
him to conduct his operation."
But Haig added: "Under no circumstances would
we ever be true to the preservation of the powers of
the office of the president to permit any
investigator a fishing, free rein fishing expedition,
into the vital discussions that occur in the
president's office."
Cox appeared on the NBC television show "Meet
the Press." Haig appeared on CBS' "Face the
Nation."
Rep. Ford Loan Allegation Denied
WASHINGTON — A spokesman for Vice
President-designate Gerald R. Ford says a report
that Ford failed to repay a $15,000 loan from a
former lobbyist is a lie.
The charge was contained in an affidavit of
Robert Winter-Berger filed with the Senate Rules
Committee, which must approve Ford's nomination.
Columnist Jack Anderson published an account
in Sunday's newspaper editions based on the
document.
In the affidavit, Winter-Berger said:
"Between 1966 and September of 1969 I
personally loaned Gerlad Ford in the neighborhood
of $15,000. This money was delivered to Ford in
cash to cover an illness and hospitalization of his
wife... This money came from my personal
income and I paid taxes on it. This money was never
repaid. I never asked for repayment and it was never
offered."

Ford's spokesman, Paul Miltich, said the charges
about the loan were "a categorical lie." He said
Ford maintained high-option Blue Cross and Blue
Shield insurance which covered virtually all the
medical expenses.
Convoy Reaches Trapped Army
TEL AVIV — The lead vehicles of a 100-truck
convoy arrived with food, water and medicine
yesterday for the 3rd Egyptian Army choked off in
the hostile Sinai Desert by a ring of Israeli tanks, Tel
Aviv reported.
A second convoy also was allowed to carry
medical supplies to the besieged city of Suez at the
southern end of the Suez Canal, Israeli spokesmen
said.
The first trucks rolled through Israeli lines on the
west bank of the Suez Canal following a face-to-face
predawn meeting between senior Israeli and
Egyptian officers on a bleak stretch of Egyptian
sand, the Israelis said.
The Tel Aviv command claimed Egyptian
holdouts attacked Israeli forces south of the
beleaguered 3rd Army several times and that some
of the 3rd Army troops fired on the convoy as it
pulled into their parched desert trap. Egypt was
warned the convoy would be stopped short if the
firing continued.
Israeli Premier Golda Meir said she was happy the
Israeli-Egyptian meeting took place after years of
mutual isolation. She added:
"But to say that this leads directly to peace
quickly, I can't say that. It's a start that people
begin to talk."
The 1:30 a.m. encounter, about 60 miles from
Cairo near a dry gully called Wadi al-Jandali, marked
the first time Egyptians and Israelis have openly
conferred at such a high official level since Oct. 29,
1956, the Israeli military command said.
Cambodia Fighting Continues
PHNOM PENH — Government forces fought to
clear Phnom Penh's southern approaches of
insurgent troops yesterday, as rebel forces cut
Highway 5, 12 miles northwest of the capital.
At the same time, the U.S. Embassy said Maj.
Vincent Gomez, an assistant defense attache, had
returned to the capital after being lightly wounded
Saturday on the capital's southern front.
Gomez was reportedly observing government
forces in frontline combat when he was hit in the
arm by a bullet.
Field reports said insurgents virtually controlled
a stretch of Highway 5 from Phum Kruos to Prek
Taten, a distance of some 2 x /i miles.
Insurgents have held a 10-mile section of
Highway 5 north of Sala Lek Pram, about 35 miles

northwest of Phnom Penh, since Sept. 6.
Fire Rages Near San Diego
MORENA VILLAGE, Calif. — One thousand fire
fighters continued to fight an uncontrolled blaze
yesterday which destroyed more than 8000 acres
and gutted 12 structures in Cleveland National
Forest.
Authorities said they were uncertain when the
roaring blaze, concentrated in chaparral brush at the
4000-foot level near this lakeside resort community,
could be controlled. The San Diego County sheriff's
office said residents of this 125-population
community were evacuated to a nearby church after
flames roared through the area Saturday night.
Damage was estimated at $250,000.
Kemper Attempts Suicide
REDWOOD CITY - Edmund Emil Kemper 111,
the 6-9, 280 pound man on trial on charges of
killing eight women, tried to commit suicide by
slashing his wrist early yesterday morning, sheriff's
deputies said.
Guards rushed to Kemper's cell in the San Mateo
County Jail in Redwood City about 3:40 a.m. and
found Kemper had slashed his right wrist with a
flattened, sharpened ball point pen, Sgt. Robert
Cancilla said.
Cancilla said Kemper resisted efforts to help him
and had to be handcuffed before he could be put in
the ambulance. Kemper was taken to the Kaiser
Foundation Hospital in Redwood City, where six
stitches were required to close the wound.
On May 28, two days before his scheduled
arraignment, officials said Kemper twice tried to
commit suicide by puncturing an artery in his wrist
with a ball point pen clip.

personally loaned Gerlad Ford in the neighborhood
of $15,000. This money was delivered to Ford in
cash to cover an illness and hospitalization of his
wife... This money came from my personal
income and I paid taxes on it. This money was never
repaid. I never asked for repayment and it was never
offered."

Ford's spokesman, Paul Miltich, said the charges
about the loan were "a categorical lie." He said
Ford maintained high-option Blue Cross and Blue
Shield insurance which covered virtually all the
medical expenses.
Convoy Reaches Trapped Army
TEL AVIV — The lead vehicles of a 100-truck
convoy arrived with food, water and medicine
yesterday for the 3rd Egyptian Army choked off in
the hostile Sinai Desert by a ring of Israeli tanks, Tel
Aviv reported.
A second convoy also was allowed to carry
medical supplies to the besieged city of Suez at the
southern end of the Suez Canal, Israeli spokesmen
said.
The first trucks rolled through Israeli lines on the
west bank of the Suez Canal following a face-to-face
predawn meeting between senior Israeli and
Egyptian officers on a bleak stretch of Egyptian
sand, the Israelis said.
The Tel Aviv command claimed Egyptian
holdouts attacked Israeli forces south of the
beleaguered 3rd Army several times and that some
of the 3rd Army troops fired on the convoy as it
pulled into their parched desert trap. Egypt was
warned the convoy would be stopped short if the
firing continued.
Israeli Premier Golda Meir said she was happy the
Israeli-Egyptian meeting took place after years of
mutual isolation. She added:
"But to say that this leads directly to peace
quickly, I can't say that. It's a start that people
begin to talk."
The 1:30 a.m. encounter, about 60 miles from
Cairo near a dry gully called Wadi al-Jandali, marked
the first time Egyptians and Israelis have openly
conferred at such a high official level since Oct. 29,
1956, the Israeli military command said.
Cambodia Fighting Continues
PHNOM PENH — Government forces fought to
clear Phnom Penh's southern approaches of
insurgent troops yesterday, as rebel forces cut
Highway 5, 12 miles northwest of the capital.
At the same time, the U.S. Embassy said Maj.
Vincent Gomez, an assistant defense attache, had
returned to the capital after being lightly wounded
Saturday on the capital's southern front.
Gomez was reportedly observing government
forces in frontline combat when he was hit in the
arm by a bullet.
Field reports said insurgents virtually controlled
a stretch of Highway 5 from Phum Kruos to Prek
Taten, a distance of some 2 x /i miles.
Insurgents have held a 10-mile section of
Highway 5 north of Sala Lek Pram, about 35 miles

northwest of Phnom Penh, since Sept. 6.
Fire Rages Near San Diego
MORENA VILLAGE, Calif. — One thousand fire
fighters continued to fight an uncontrolled blaze
yesterday which destroyed more than 8000 acres
and gutted 12 structures in Cleveland National
Forest.
Authorities said they were uncertain when the
roaring blaze, concentrated in chaparral brush at the
4000-foot level near this lakeside resort community,
could be controlled. The San Diego County sheriff's
office said residents of this 125-population
community were evacuated to a nearby church after
flames roared through the area Saturday night.
Damage was estimated at $250,000.
Kemper Attempts Suicide
REDWOOD CITY - Edmund Emil Kemper 111,
the 6-9, 280 pound man on trial on charges of
killing eight women, tried to commit suicide by
slashing his wrist early yesterday morning, sheriff's
deputies said.
Guards rushed to Kemper's cell in the San Mateo
County Jail in Redwood City about 3:40 a.m. and
found Kemper had slashed his right wrist with a
flattened, sharpened ball point pen, Sgt. Robert
Cancilla said.
Cancilla said Kemper resisted efforts to help him
and had to be handcuffed before he could be put in
the ambulance. Kemper was taken to the Kaiser
Foundation Hospital in Redwood City, where six
stitches were required to close the wound.
On May 28, two days before his scheduled
arraignment, officials said Kemper twice tried to
commit suicide by puncturing an artery in his wrist
with a ball point pen clip.
