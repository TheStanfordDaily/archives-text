# Stillman House Renovation Incomplete
## Building Delays Wreak Housing Havoc 
### MARK SIMONIAN Part one of a two-part series 
In a situation described as "a
supreme embarrassment to the
University by Assoc. Dean of Students
Affairs Larry Horton, some 80
students will be unable to move until
Nov. 9 into housing that was promised
to them by Oct. 15.
The students will eventually be
living in the relocated Columbae house
(formerly Stillman-Grove house) and
in the Delta Tau Delta fraternity
house.
Since the beginning of the quarter,
the 37 Columbae residents have been
living in the Delt house, leaving the 43
students assigned to the Delt house in
the housing draw without a house for
the last month and a half.
Frat Misconduct
The original residents of the Delt
house, members of the Delta Tau
Delta fraternity, were forced out of
their house for at least one year last
May following numerous complaints
of misconduct from neighboring
houses.
In suspending the frat for two years
with the possibility of one year off for
"good behavior," the University,
which owns the house, demanded that
it be allowed to use the house as part
of the housing draw, filling it as any
other dorm.
The problem is that Stillman house
still is not ready for occupancy by the
Columbae residents, Horton said.
Uprooted from its foundations on
Lasuen Street this summer, the house
has been transplanted down the block
to the northeast corner of Lasuen and
the existing Campus Drive to make
room for the planned Campus Drive
rerouting.
1896 Relic
During that relocation, Stillman
house, a relic from 1896, was split in
two to facilitate the movers' work.
Construction crews have spent the last
two months laying a new foundation,
piecing the house back together,
remodeling it, repainting it and
installing new wiring and appliances.
Throughout the summer and well
into September, the housing office
expected Columbae residents would be
able to move into Stillman house at
the beginning of fall quarter, Horton
said. In a memo dated Sept. 8, the
Facilities Planning, Construction and
Utilization office told Horton that
Stillman would be ready by Sept. 23.
However, sometime later that week,
the planning office changed the ready
date and assured the housing office
that, "in the worst case," Stillman
house would be ready for "full use"

by Oct. 15, Horton said.
The housing office waited until one
day before registration, Sept. 24, to
fill the Delt House with students still
unassigned in the housing draw
according to Horton.
Latest Oct. 15
At that time, Horton and his
assistants made it clear to students
accepting assignment to the Delt house
that they would have to wait until
"Oct. 15 at the latest" before they
could move in.

However, as the Oct. 15 deadline
neared, it became obvious Stillman
would not be ready and the planning
office postponed the move-in date
until Oct. 23. That date could not be
met either, the planning office later
discovered, so they again shifted
Stillman's ready date — this time to
Nov. 9.
These delays have forced Columbae
residents to live in the Delt house for
two months, after they had been
promised they could move into their

own house in September. They are
now expected to move into Stillman
house during midterms.
Because of that inconvenience and
also because the remodeling of the
Delt house, begun this summer, was
not complete by the beginning of the
quarter, Columbae residents will only
pay one-half the normal room bill for
their interim housing, said Manager of
Residences and Fraternities Alan
Cummings.
