# Stillman House Renovation Incomplete
## Building Delays Wreak Housing Havoc 
### MARK SIMONIAN Part one of a two-part series 
In a situation described as "a
supreme embarrassment to the
University by Assoc. Dean of Students
Affairs Larry Horton, some 80
students will be unable to move until
Nov. 9 into housing that was promised
to them by Oct. 15.
The students will eventually be
living in the relocated Columbae house
(formerly Stillman-Grove house) and
in the Delta Tau Delta fraternity
house.
Since the beginning of the quarter,
the 37 Columbae residents have been
living in the Delt house, leaving the 43
students assigned to the Delt house in
the housing draw without a house for
the last month and a half.
Frat Misconduct
The original residents of the Delt
house, members of the Delta Tau
Delta fraternity, were forced out of
their house for at least one year last
May following numerous complaints
of misconduct from neighboring
houses.
In suspending the frat for two years
with the possibility of one year off for
"good behavior," the University,
which owns the house, demanded that
it be allowed to use the house as part
of the housing draw, filling it as any
other dorm.
The problem is that Stillman house
still is not ready for occupancy by the
Columbae residents, Horton said.
Uprooted from its foundations on
Lasuen Street this summer, the house
has been transplanted down the block
to the northeast corner of Lasuen and
the existing Campus Drive to make
room for the planned Campus Drive
rerouting.
1896 Relic
During that relocation, Stillman
house, a relic from 1896, was split in
two to facilitate the movers' work.
Construction crews have spent the last
two months laying a new foundation,
piecing the house back together,
remodeling it, repainting it and
installing new wiring and appliances.
Throughout the summer and well
into September, the housing office
expected Columbae residents would be
able to move into Stillman house at
the beginning of fall quarter, Horton
said. In a memo dated Sept. 8, the
Facilities Planning, Construction and
Utilization office told Horton that
Stillman would be ready by Sept. 23.
However, sometime later that week,
the planning office changed the ready
date and assured the housing office
that, "in the worst case," Stillman
house would be ready for "full use"

by Oct. 15, Horton said.
The housing office waited until one
day before registration, Sept. 24, to
fill the Delt House with students still
unassigned in the housing draw
according to Horton.
Latest Oct. 15
At that time, Horton and his
assistants made it clear to students
accepting assignment to the Delt house
that they would have to wait until
"Oct. 15 at the latest" before they
could move in.

However, as the Oct. 15 deadline
neared, it became obvious Stillman
would not be ready and the planning
office postponed the move-in date
until Oct. 23. That date could not be
met either, the planning office later
discovered, so they again shifted
Stillman's ready date â€” this time to
Nov. 9.
These delays have forced Columbae
residents to live in the Delt house for
two months, after they had been
promised they could move into their

own house in September. They are
now expected to move into Stillman
house during midterms.
Because of that inconvenience and
also because the remodeling of the
Delt house, begun this summer, was
not complete by the beginning of the
quarter, Columbae residents will only
pay one-half the normal room bill for
their interim housing, said Manager of
Residences and Fraternities Alan
Cummings.
More importantly, the setbacks
have forced Delt house residents to
live off campus or in "substitute
University housing" for an additional
month after they were promised the
Delt house. They too will have to
move in the midst of exams.
And these delays have forced the
University to keep three
administrators tied up working with
the problems of just where to put the
students assigned to the Delt house.
For "substitute housing," the
University has offered several
alternatives at no cost to the students.
Upperclass students assigned to the
Delt house have their choice of living

in Univerfcy guest rooms near each
dormitory,. >r in freshman or graduate
housing, wife willing faculty members
or even in he Tiki Motel just off
campus.
Delt reside ts generally considered
few of these alternatives desirable.
"For one thin;, you have to move
twice," said onenale student. "I think
I'd just rather livtat home."
Others, not brtunate enough to
live close by, ha\e either elected to
accept the Univtrsity's offers and
grumble or continue living off campus
by themselves or witi friends.
The work to readv Stillman house
has continued overtime and on
weekends for the last f .wo weeks, said
Asst. Manager of Facilities Planning,
Construction and Utilization Robert
Kavinoky, the University's supervisor
for the Stillman project.
"I think the root cause of the delay
is the lack of responsiveness on the
part of the contractor and some of his
subcontractors," he said.
Kavinoky said the main contractor,
Atlas Housemovers, had promised to
move Stillman house sometime before
mid-August but failed to finish the
move before Labor Day.
The contractor acted only after the
University threatened to cancel his
contract, Kavinoky said.
He added that even though the
house had been moved late, the
refurbishing job might have been
completed in September or early
October if there had not been "hidden
surprises, inadequacies in the
foundation system that were not
immediately apparent on inspection"
of the 77-year old house.
