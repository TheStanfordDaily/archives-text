# 'Courts Should Appoint Prosecutor'
## Cranston Sees Executive Clash 
### KEVIN SMITH 
Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said
Saturday night that Congress would
continue to seek the appointment of
an independent special prosecutor by
the courts despite President Nixon's
announcement that Acting Atty. Gen.
Robert Bork would appoint a new
prosecutor shortly.
The Palo Alto-born Cranston made
his remarks at a joint press conference

with Sen. Philip Hart, D-Mich., before
he appeared at a "Gala Homecoming
Dinner" held in his honor at Rickey's
Hyatt House in Palo Alto. About 350
persons attended the $100-a-plate
affair.
"The President made a great
miscalculation when he said we would
drop" the attempt to appoint a
prosecutor independent of the Justice
Department, Cranston asserted. "We

are not going to drop it."
According to Cranston, Congress
will probably be able to override the
expected veto of the special
prosecutor bill, which he predicted
would pass Congress overwhelmingly.
"I differ deeply with his [the
President's] proposal to appoint an
independent prosecutor through the
Justice Department," Cranston said. "I
think Mr. Bork has totally disqualified
himself" from selecting a new
prosecutor because his first move as
acting attorney general "was to fire an
honest, able prosecutor," Archibald
Cox.
"No one who would be under
control, or seeming control, of the
Nixon Administration could provide
the American people" with the
assurance that the prosecutor would
be totally independent, Cranston said.
Bill Sponsor
Hart is the main sponsor of the
Senate's special prosecutor bill, which
has been co-sponsored by 51 other
senators. Hart's bill would "authorize
and direct the chief judge of the
District Court of the District of
Columbia [Judge John Sirica] to
appoint a special prosecutor and a
deputy special prosecutor for a period
of two years."
The scope of the new prosecutor's
duties "would be identical with the
charge given Archibald Cox," Hart
said.
Asked whom he would like to see
appointed special prosecutor, Hart
replied he would "start with the tried
and true: Prof. Cox. I think that
would provide a great relief for the
country." Hart also mentioned former
Atty. Gen. Elliot Richardson as a
possible choice.

CRANSTON SPEAKS — Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) spoke at a joint press
conference with Sen. Fiiillip Hart (D.-Mich.) at Rickey's Hyatt House Saturday
night. Cranston stated the Congress will continue to seek the appointment of an
independent special prosecutor by the courts.
Judiciary Committee, of which Hart is
a member, is scheduled to begin
hearings on the bill today with Cox as
the first witness.
Working On Bill
Cranston said he was working on a
bill to establish a permanent special
prosecutor's office which would deal
with misdeeds by the executive branch
and enforcement of election laws. He
said there is "often a feeling that
prosecutors aren't as thorough and
even-handed as they should be" under
the Justice Department.
Neither senator would reveal how
he might vote on the question of
impeachment, because, as Hart put it,
"One of the first things you run into
in the Senate is that you might be a
judge" in an impeachment trial.
However, Hart suggested
impeachment as one way of restoring
confidence in the Presidency. Claiming
"impeachment could have a purifying
effect," Hart said, "If in a trial, we
vote not guilty, then the President is
the President" cleared of wrongdoing.
"If we vote guilty, then we change
leadership."
Cranston reported his California
office has received 13,265 messages
calling for Nixon's impeachment with
only 599 opposed. He added there has
been "no change in that percentage
since the President complied with the
court order last Tuesday."

assurance that the prosecutor would
be totally independent, Cranston said.
Bill Sponsor
Hart is the main sponsor of the
Senate's special prosecutor bill, which
has been co-sponsored by 51 other
senators. Hart's bill would "authorize
and direct the chief judge of the
District Court of the District of
Columbia [Judge John Sirica] to
appoint a special prosecutor and a
deputy special prosecutor for a period
of two years."
The scope of the new prosecutor's
duties "would be identical with the
charge given Archibald Cox," Hart
said.
Asked whom he would like to see
appointed special prosecutor, Hart
replied he would "start with the tried
and true: Prof. Cox. I think that
would provide a great relief for the
country." Hart also mentioned former
Atty. Gen. Elliot Richardson as a
possible choice.
According to Hart, the Senate

CRANSTON SPEAKS — Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.) spoke at a joint press
conference with Sen. Fiiillip Hart (D.-Mich.) at Rickey's Hyatt House Saturday
night. Cranston stated the Congress will continue to seek the appointment of an
independent special prosecutor by the courts.
Judiciary Committee, of which Hart is
a member, is scheduled to begin
hearings on the bill today with Cox as
the first witness.
Working On Bill
Cranston said he was working on a
bill to establish a permanent special
prosecutor's office which would deal
with misdeeds by the executive branch
and enforcement of election laws. He
said there is "often a feeling that
prosecutors aren't as thorough and
even-handed as they should be" under
the Justice Department.
Neither senator would reveal how
he might vote on the question of
impeachment, because, as Hart put it,
"One of the first things you run into
in the Senate is that you might be a
judge" in an impeachment trial.
However, Hart suggested
impeachment as one way of restoring
confidence in the Presidency. Claiming
"impeachment could have a purifying
effect," Hart said, "If in a trial, we
vote not guilty, then the President is
the President" cleared of wrongdoing.
"If we vote guilty, then we change
leadership."
Cranston reported his California
office has received 13,265 messages
calling for Nixon's impeachment with
only 599 opposed. He added there has
been "no change in that percentage
since the President complied with the
court order last Tuesday."
Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said
Saturday night that Congress would
continue to seek the appointment of
an independent special prosecutor by
the courts despite President Nixon's
announcement that Acting Atty. Gen.
Robert Bork would appoint a new
prosecutor shortly.
The Palo Alto-born Cranston made
his remarks at a joint press conference

with Sen. Philip Hart, D-Mich., before
he appeared at a "Gala Homecoming
Dinner" held in his honor at Rickey's
Hyatt House in Palo Alto. About 350
persons attended the $100-a-plate
affair.
"The President made a great
miscalculation when he said we would
drop" the attempt to appoint a
prosecutor independent of the Justice
Department, Cranston asserted. "We

are not going to drop it."
According to Cranston, Congress
will probably be able to override the
expected veto of the special
prosecutor bill, which he predicted
would pass Congress overwhelmingly.
"I differ deeply with his [the
President's] proposal to appoint an
independent prosecutor through the
Justice Department," Cranston said. "I
think Mr. Bork has totally disqualified
himself" from selecting a new
prosecutor because his first move as
acting attorney general "was to fire an
honest, able prosecutor," Archibald
Cox.
"No one who would be under
control, or seeming control, of the
Nixon Administration could provide
the American people" with the
assurance that the prosecutor would
be totally independent, Cranston said.
