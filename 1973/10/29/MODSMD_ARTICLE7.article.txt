# Alternatives To Shockleyism
## Crises Generate Dangerous Reform 
### 
David Amor

We should be grateful to
Professor Shockley for once more
directing our attention (Daily,
Oct. 23,24) to the outrageous
conditions of poverty, illiteracy,
chronic malnutrition and
degradation that are the lot of
millions of oppressed people,
particularly people of color, in the
United States today. Too many,
especially those in authority,
would prefer to forget this
atrocious situation, or wish it
away. The esteemed professor is
not such a liberal idealist: he
would do more than wish it away.
Far too many people, at
Stanford and in the academic
community at large, are prone to
dismiss Shockley and his
proposals as "crack-pot" and
scientifically unsound, and to
refuse to take him seriously. It is
the contention of this writer that
Shockley should be taken very
seriously indeed: he is a very
dangerous man. Today it serves
the interest of the dominant class
in the United States to suppress
public discussion and public
programs concerning the
conditions of urban ghettos and
rural slums, supplementing such
"benign neglect" with
authoritarian police repression
and political persecution. But if
"benign neglect" be here, can
"benevolent genocide" be far
behind?
The term "benevolent
genocide" is a New Speak phrase, a
conscious mystification meant to
conceal analytic content behind
an emotional smokescreen (the
same is true of "berserk
humanism," of which more later).
Shockley uses it to refer to his
proposed policy of "voluntary"
sterilization, in which the
government would take advantage
of the desperation of the
poverty-stricken — itself a product
of economic exploitation — by
offering economic rewards in
exchange for the renunciation of
reproduction. Such is, in essence,
the "thinking exercise" which
Shockley incessantly propounds.
How Marx would rail, were he
here to see this final solution:
Having robbed the laborer of
all save his labor-power, the
capitalist cheats him still
further by exploiting
surplus-value in his sweat-shops
and factories; then, when the
contradictions of the capitalist
system itself threaten his holy

profits, he carelessly casts the
laborer out into the streets,
thereby depriving him of his
only remaining means of
support. Not yet content, the
capitalist adds insult to injury
by setting aside a few pence for
alms, which he distributes
scornfully, all the while
heaping abuse upon the lazy
layabout who prefers to
'sponge upon society's
generosity rather than seeking
out' (non-existant) 'productive
employment'. But all this pales
before the final irony. Greedy
for the last remaining groat,
and fearful, in his heart of
hearts, of the juste vengeance
du peuple, the capitalist
determines that, rather than
shoulder the responsibility for
the chaos and misery he has
created, rather than put
himself further out of pocket
with costly police and policies
of repression, he will
consummate his thievery
through assassination, and rob
the worker of his children,
simultaneously thereby
cheapening the value of
labor-power and taking the
penultimate step in the
transubstantiation of labor into
capital, and eliminating once
and for all the fear of
revolution, through the
eradication of the last vestiges
of the hope and dignity of the
worker.
A more modern economist would
doubtless present a somewhat
different analysis.
Let none counter that this is all
mere hypercritical paranoia. In its
present form, Shockley's proposal
stresses "voluntarism," but the
Eelf case that he himself cites
shows that this term is subject to
an alarmingly wide interpretation.
As the present crisis of American
capitalism continues and worsens,
Shockley's proposals are likely to
get an increasingly sympathetic
hearing among the ruling elite
within this country.
But what alternatives?
Shockley mentions one, which he,
with characteristic objectivity,
terms "berserk humanism." This
term, like "benevolent genocide,"
serves to distort the reality to
which it refers. It is not the
humanism of Senator Kennedy
and his type of liberal reformer
which is at fault, it is the
impotence of their proposals. The

politically and philosophically
correct appreciation of the unique
value and importance of all
human beings becomes diluted by
these "concerned" members of
the middle and upper classes into
the isolated and meaningless
statements about "wonderful
people" that Shockley, with some
justice, derides.
Liberal reforms, by their own
nature, attempt to solve social
problems within the structure and
conditions of the very society
which created those problems. If
the past decade has anything to
teach us, it is the conclusive
demonstration of the failure of
liberal reformism. Liberal reform
programs and proposals like
Shockley's come ultimately from
the same place: from the ruling
classes and their ideologues. With
regard to their implementation,
history shows us an unequivocable
sequence: when liberal policies,
liberal politics, liberal ideologies
show themselves incapable (as
they must) of solving the
deep-rooted social problems
created by the development of the
capitalist system itself, the ruling
classes turn to fascist solutions.
This is the strength and the danger
of William Shockley.
It is part of the ideology of
American academics, that fascist
and liberal alternatives be
presented as the only possible
solutions to the serious problems
that confront us. This is the case
with Shockley's article, but it is
more generally true as well. The
alternative that this
dichotomization suppresses is that
of real structural transformations
that could attack problems of
poverty and oppression at their

source. Such solutions cannot
come from the ruling classes, and
will not come from the
universities. They can come only
from the people themselves,
through the growth of awareness
of their own real interests, and
their own real possibilities. But
these solutions involve us all.
It may yet seem very distant,
very unreal, but the crisis that is
growing in the capitalist system
will not be felt only by the
"surplus population" of the
working-class, but by the wide
range of the middle class as well;
and the solution that will be
required to avert that crisis will be
either radical or fascist. The
horror of the Shocklean solution
is clearest when we see that to kill
the hope of any among us is to
kill the hope of us all.
