"Thus Would Write an Historian in 2001: The
State of Israel Fell in War. Not in a War in Which
She was Defeated, but in a War in Which She was
Victorious. CRY YE BELOVED COUNTRY!" This
title to an article by Uri Avneri, editor of the largest
Hebrew periodical in Israel, reflects the growing
concern of Israeli intellectuals that what gains their
country may win on the battlefield will be
immeasurably outweighed by the social costs of
turning it into a garrison state.
The present Mideast war throws into doubt
Israel's capability for crushing future Arab military
thrusts to regain the occupied territories. But large
numbers of Israelis now realize that even if their
country's military invincibility could be assured, the
costs would be unendurable.
Already, Israeli citizens pay a greater share of
their income in taxes than in almost any other
country in the world; the per capita national debt is
likewise staggering, and most economists agree that
the Israeli economy would collapse without foreign
capital transfers from the United States (and
previously Germany). Because military expenditures
in Israel are so huge, the Israeli government "is
unable to devote its full energies and resources to
the problems whose solutions are the precondition
for making Israel a modern and progressive society,"
Yehoshu Arieli, Professor of History at Hebrew
University, wrote a year ago.
Income Gap
The spreading income gap, the rise in violence
and crime, and waves of new immigrants are a few
examples of the enormous problems facing Israeli
society. According to Arieli, "The government's
preoccupation with security and its inability to deal
adequately with these problems is already obvious
today, and the results of such neglect are already
making themselves felt. Israeli society is gradually
becoming anarchic and wild, showing all the
symptoms of the dangers that threaten the very
existence of urban and technological societies in
other countries."
Golda Meir asks Israeli citizens "to love the
fatherland in such a way that we will become one
nation and one family . .But, living in a society
where military preparedness is the State's primary
end, Israelis find less and less reason to passively
accept the status quo, despite a concerted attempt
by the ruling Labor party to quash dissent by
defining all issues in terms of national security.
Indeed, opposition leaders are often branded
traitors, and leaders on the Left not uncommonly
face the threat of physical attack from rightist
gangs.
Arab leftists when not in jail are generally kept
under house arrest or have their freedom of
movement severely curtailed by administrative

decree. Some Arab onganizations are banned
outright; there was talk ii the Knesset (the Israeli
Parliament) even of outlawing the Jewish Israeli
Socialist Organization (ISC). Strict censorship is
imposed by the govenment on dissident
newspapers, especially these of radical Arab
organizations, the ISO, and tie New Left in Israel.
The government even went so far as to temporarily
ban the showing of the film MASH, it was later
released in heavily censored forn.
Labor Opposition
Wildcat opposition from labor poses a serious
threat to the continued viability of the present
government in Israel. Almost all workers are
members of the Histadrut (a federation of unions
like the AFL-CIO) which exercises centralized
control over labor policies in Israel, and which
operates effectively as an agent of the State. After
the 1967 war the combination of increased taxes,
uncontrolled inflation, and frozen wages caused
major unrest among workers.
Reflecting the policy of the State, the Histadrut
refused to sanction strikes in pursuit of higher
wages. The workers went ahead on their own, until
in 1971 the entire economy was affected by a wave
of wildcat strikes. The Histadrut, feeling its power
undermined, condemned the strikes and supported,
with only minor criticism, anti-labor legislation
passed in the Knesset. Workers were arrested in large
numbers and tried before military courts and special
tribunals. The government was at least temporarily
successful in imposing its will on Israeli labor.
The inequality in Israeli society generates social
pressures even among Jews. Oriental Jews face
discrimination on the basis of race, finding great
difficulties in obtaining either jobs or public
services.
Beginning in 1971, as immigration picked up, the
Black Panthers, a militant organization of Oriental
Jews began to organize a struggle to combat racism
in Israeli society. Its first leaflet listed a few simple
demands, reflecting the enormous frustration of its
members: "Enough of unemployment. Enough of
watching apartments being built for new immigrants
while we have to sleep ten persons in one room.
Enough of government promises that are never kept.
Enough of police brutality. Enough of exploitation.
Enough of discrimination." Their demands were not
met. Israeli police arrested Black Panther leafleters,
broke up demonstrations with force, and made
"preventive arrests" of practically the entire
leadership of the group. Police violence became
habitual when dealing with the Black Panthers, but
the social tensions which created that organization
have not died.
