# Delt Residents Upset By Delays
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN Second of two parts 
While University-contracted
construction workers begin to finish
the Stillman house remodeling and
while University administrators ponder
the problems incurred in moving the
house, students displaced by the
setbacks in Stillman sit and fume.
Angered most by the delays are the
43 students who will eventually move
into the Delta Tau Delta fraternity
house.
Waiting, either off campus or in
"temporary University housing," these
students face moving their belongings
for at least the second time this
quarter. And they will move into a
house they have waited over a month
for.
"I'm pretty disappointed in the
school," said Delt resident Debby
Freeman, "[The delays] took me by
surprise. The housing office people are
trying their hardest, but I think the
administration could have stepped on
it [the construction] earlier.
"If the contractors had come
through, we wouldn't have had to
sweat through all of this," she said.
'Don't Know'
Another resident, Rick Sears
admitted, "I don't know what to
believe. It just seems like whoever was
setting the dates was deliberately lying
to us. They couldn't have know what
they were talking about.

"I went by the house when they
said it would be done in two weeks
and saw that there was no way they
were going to finish. I'm a little bit
mad about it all," he said.
Displaced residents of the Delt
house are understandably upset about
their wait, however they are disturbed
more by the apparent lack of answers
to the questions "why" surrounding
the entire Stillman house imbroglio.
"Why weren't we allowed to move
into our house instead of the
Columbae people?" queried Delt
resident George Dobbins.
'Reasonable'
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Larry Horton explained that he
"wanted very strongly to do what
seems reasonable" — to displace only
the 37 Columbae students instead of
80 students from both Columbae and
the Delt houses.
Horton said he and his staff tried to
move the Columbae people somewhere
other than the Delt house in
mid-September, but could find no
"alternatives" suitable to Columbae
residents. So he placed them in the
then-vacant Delt house with the
understanding that Stillman would be
ready for them to move into by Oct.
15.
"We originally wanted to put
Columbae in the Tiki Motel," but
residents claimed they needed to have
an independent kitchen for their

cooperative, he said.
Women's Clubhouse
"We offered them the kitchen in
the Women's Clubhouse. We offered to
move beds into the Women's
Clubhouse for them," but Columbae
residents refused these offers as well,
he added.
"They finally persuaded us that if
their living group was to have a prayer
of succeeding, they had to have their
own house," Horton said.
Asst. Director of the Row,
Fraternities and Independent Houses
David Bell said simply, "Columbae was
in [University housing] earlier."
Another of the "whys" concerns
the accuracy of the initial occupancy
dates the housing office gave both
Columbae and Delt residents. Why
were they so late and why were they
so far off?
'Understandings'
Horton said the dates he and his
staff relayed to students were "based
on sets of understandings" from the
office of facilities planning,
construction and utilization. They
were established on "the best
information available" to him, he said.
In the instance of the delay from
Oct. 15 to Oct. 23 "we informed
students the same day we found out.
Most were informed within 24 hours,"
according to Horton.
Asst. Manager of Facilities
Planning, Construction and Utilization

Robert Kavinoky said the estimates he
gave the housing office "seemed
reasonable."
Kavinoky faulted the contractor,
Ray Wickett of Atlantic Housemovers,
for making • "promises he had no
intentions of keeping. All along his
estimates seemed reasonable to us. We
waited until there was just enough
time to do the job in early August
before we threatened to cancel his
contract," Kavinoky said.
Late Notification
As for the late notification of
"slippage dates," he replied, "we
waited as long as we thought prudent.
We based our decision of the best
appraisal we had, but the contractor
did not give us accurate estimates."
He added that rushing to change
the project's ready dates would be an
"unnecessary inconvenience" to
students and housing office
administrators. "We wait until we are
sure. We wait up to the moment we
still believe the job can be done," he
said.
But Wickett denied Kavinoky's
claim that the delays were his fault.
"The University wouldn't let me
get in on the job until Aug. 5 because I
didn't have a bond," Wickett said. The
University requires its contractors to
provide labor and materials bonds
from second parties. The bond insures
that the contractor will pay his

workmen and material suppliers.
"The University also added a lot of
extra work that they wanted us to do
that had nothing to do with the
original contract. And they didn't give
us any more time to do it.
Subcontractor Ready?
"Any my subcontractor,
Roadrunner Construction, was not
ready to go," he said. Roadrunner
delayed in "cutting the building in
two, laying the foundation, doing the
beam work, putting in the
porches . .according to Wickett.
Roadrunner construction head
Lavelle Johnson agreed that the

University gave his company and
Atlantic "a lot of extra work with no
extra time," but denied his company
was responsible for Atlantic's delays.
"I got the job really late in August.
It should have been started in June.
But I came right in on time. I was the
first man on the job. The house was
cut two weeks before it was picked
up," he said.
"He [Wickett] was working in San
Jose on more buildings" while
Stillman house sat waiting to be
moved, according to Johnson.
Responsibility
While Roadrunner was responsible
for preparing Stillman house for

moving, the University charged
Atlantic directly with jacking up the
house and moving it down Lasuen
Street, he explained.
"I think [the University has) gone
overboard to help Ray Wickett.
"But everything has delayed the
house. We were late in laying the
foundation because Wickett couldn't
get us the materials. Kavinoky [the
University's representative] asked us
why we weren't starting to lay the
foundation and we told him.
"Kavinoky stepped in and got us
the materials," Johnson said, "but that
delayed the house."
Time Tables
Kavinoky said that Wickett had
accepted the University's extra work
demands and had established
timetables for their completion during
the job. Wickett did not meet these
deadlines, he said.
"He has been totally ineffective as
an administrator of work and men,"
Kavinoky said. "He still doesn't have a
bond, but we gave in on that
requirement, even though it was part
of the contract and he promised us he
would get one."
Stillman is only the first in a series
of houses that will be moved rather
than demolished in the Campus Drive
rerouting, Horton said. The housing
and planning offices already have
planned to move the Delta Upsilon
fraternity house next summer.

administration could have stepped on
it [the construction] earlier.
"If the contractors had come
through, we wouldn't have had to
sweat through all of this," she said.
'Don't Know'
Another resident, Rick Sears
admitted, "I don't know what to
believe. It just seems like whoever was
setting the dates was deliberately lying
to us. They couldn't have know what
they were talking about.

"I went by the house when they
said it would be done in two weeks
and saw that there was no way they
were going to finish. I'm a little bit
mad about it all," he said.
Displaced residents of the Delt
house are understandably upset about
their wait, however they are disturbed
more by the apparent lack of answers
to the questions "why" surrounding
the entire Stillman house imbroglio.
"Why weren't we allowed to move
into our house instead of the
Columbae people?" queried Delt
resident George Dobbins.
'Reasonable'
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Larry Horton explained that he
"wanted very strongly to do what
seems reasonable" — to displace only
the 37 Columbae students instead of
80 students from both Columbae and
the Delt houses.
Horton said he and his staff tried to
move the Columbae people somewhere
other than the Delt house in
mid-September, but could find no
"alternatives" suitable to Columbae
residents. So he placed them in the
then-vacant Delt house with the
understanding that Stillman would be
ready for them to move into by Oct.
15.
"We originally wanted to put
Columbae in the Tiki Motel," but
residents claimed they needed to have
an independent kitchen for their

cooperative, he said.
Women's Clubhouse
"We offered them the kitchen in
the Women's Clubhouse. We offered to
move beds into the Women's
Clubhouse for them," but Columbae
residents refused these offers as well,
he added.
"They finally persuaded us that if
their living group was to have a prayer
of succeeding, they had to have their
own house," Horton said.
Asst. Director of the Row,
Fraternities and Independent Houses
David Bell said simply, "Columbae was
in [University housing] earlier."
Another of the "whys" concerns
the accuracy of the initial occupancy
dates the housing office gave both
Columbae and Delt residents. Why
were they so late and why were they
so far off?
'Understandings'
Horton said the dates he and his
staff relayed to students were "based
on sets of understandings" from the
office of facilities planning,
construction and utilization. They
were established on "the best
information available" to him, he said.
In the instance of the delay from
Oct. 15 to Oct. 23 "we informed
students the same day we found out.
Most were informed within 24 hours,"
according to Horton.
Asst. Manager of Facilities
Planning, Construction and Utilization

Robert Kavinoky said the estimates he
gave the housing office "seemed
reasonable."
Kavinoky faulted the contractor,
Ray Wickett of Atlantic Housemovers,
for making • "promises he had no
intentions of keeping. All along his
estimates seemed reasonable to us. We
waited until there was just enough
time to do the job in early August
before we threatened to cancel his
contract," Kavinoky said.
Late Notification
As for the late notification of
"slippage dates," he replied, "we
waited as long as we thought prudent.
We based our decision of the best
appraisal we had, but the contractor
did not give us accurate estimates."
He added that rushing to change
the project's ready dates would be an
"unnecessary inconvenience" to
students and housing office
administrators. "We wait until we are
sure. We wait up to the moment we
still believe the job can be done," he
said.
But Wickett denied Kavinoky's
claim that the delays were his fault.
"The University wouldn't let me
get in on the job until Aug. 5 because I
didn't have a bond," Wickett said. The
University requires its contractors to
provide labor and materials bonds
from second parties. The bond insures
that the contractor will pay his

workmen and material suppliers.
"The University also added a lot of
extra work that they wanted us to do
that had nothing to do with the
original contract. And they didn't give
us any more time to do it.
Subcontractor Ready?
"Any my subcontractor,
Roadrunner Construction, was not
ready to go," he said. Roadrunner
delayed in "cutting the building in
two, laying the foundation, doing the
beam work, putting in the
porches . .according to Wickett.
Roadrunner construction head
Lavelle Johnson agreed that the

University gave his company and
Atlantic "a lot of extra work with no
extra time," but denied his company
was responsible for Atlantic's delays.
"I got the job really late in August.
It should have been started in June.
But I came right in on time. I was the
first man on the job. The house was
cut two weeks before it was picked
up," he said.
"He [Wickett] was working in San
Jose on more buildings" while
Stillman house sat waiting to be
moved, according to Johnson.
Responsibility
While Roadrunner was responsible
for preparing Stillman house for

moving, the University charged
Atlantic directly with jacking up the
house and moving it down Lasuen
Street, he explained.
"I think [the University has) gone
overboard to help Ray Wickett.
"But everything has delayed the
house. We were late in laying the
foundation because Wickett couldn't
get us the materials. Kavinoky [the
University's representative] asked us
why we weren't starting to lay the
foundation and we told him.
"Kavinoky stepped in and got us
the materials," Johnson said, "but that
delayed the house."
Time Tables
Kavinoky said that Wickett had
accepted the University's extra work
demands and had established
timetables for their completion during
the job. Wickett did not meet these
deadlines, he said.
"He has been totally ineffective as
an administrator of work and men,"
Kavinoky said. "He still doesn't have a
bond, but we gave in on that
requirement, even though it was part
of the contract and he promised us he
would get one."
Stillman is only the first in a series
of houses that will be moved rather
than demolished in the Campus Drive
rerouting, Horton said. The housing
and planning offices already have
planned to move the Delta Upsilon
fraternity house next summer.

to the questions "why" surrounding
the entire Stillman house imbroglio.
"Why weren't we allowed to move
into our house instead of the
Columbae people?" queried Delt
resident George Dobbins.
'Reasonable'
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Larry Horton explained that he
"wanted very strongly to do what
seems reasonable" — to displace only
the 37 Columbae students instead of
80 students from both Columbae and
the Delt houses.
Horton said he and his staff tried to
move the Columbae people somewhere
other than the Delt house in
mid-September, but could find no
"alternatives" suitable to Columbae
residents. So he placed them in the
then-vacant Delt house with the
understanding that Stillman would be
ready for them to move into by Oct.
15.
"We originally wanted to put
Columbae in the Tiki Motel," but
residents claimed they needed to have
an independent kitchen for their

cooperative, he said.
Women's Clubhouse
"We offered them the kitchen in
the Women's Clubhouse. We offered to
move beds into the Women's
Clubhouse for them," but Columbae
residents refused these offers as well,
he added.
"They finally persuaded us that if
their living group was to have a prayer
of succeeding, they had to have their
own house," Horton said.
Asst. Director of the Row,
Fraternities and Independent Houses
David Bell said simply, "Columbae was
in [University housing] earlier."
Another of the "whys" concerns
the accuracy of the initial occupancy
dates the housing office gave both
Columbae and Delt residents. Why
were they so late and why were they
so far off?
'Understandings'
Horton said the dates he and his
staff relayed to students were "based
on sets of understandings" from the
office of facilities planning,
construction and utilization. They
were established on "the best
information available" to him, he said.
In the instance of the delay from
Oct. 15 to Oct. 23 "we informed
students the same day we found out.
Most were informed within 24 hours,"
according to Horton.
Asst. Manager of Facilities
Planning, Construction and Utilization

Robert Kavinoky said the estimates he
gave the housing office "seemed
reasonable."
Kavinoky faulted the contractor,
Ray Wickett of Atlantic Housemovers,
for making • "promises he had no
intentions of keeping. All along his
estimates seemed reasonable to us. We
waited until there was just enough
time to do the job in early August
before we threatened to cancel his
contract," Kavinoky said.
Late Notification
As for the late notification of
"slippage dates," he replied, "we
waited as long as we thought prudent.
We based our decision of the best
appraisal we had, but the contractor
did not give us accurate estimates."
He added that rushing to change
the project's ready dates would be an
"unnecessary inconvenience" to
students and housing office
administrators. "We wait until we are
sure. We wait up to the moment we
still believe the job can be done," he
said.
But Wickett denied Kavinoky's
claim that the delays were his fault.
"The University wouldn't let me
get in on the job until Aug. 5 because I
didn't have a bond," Wickett said. The
University requires its contractors to
provide labor and materials bonds
from second parties. The bond insures
that the contractor will pay his

workmen and material suppliers.
"The University also added a lot of
extra work that they wanted us to do
that had nothing to do with the
original contract. And they didn't give
us any more time to do it.
Subcontractor Ready?
"Any my subcontractor,
Roadrunner Construction, was not
ready to go," he said. Roadrunner
delayed in "cutting the building in
two, laying the foundation, doing the
beam work, putting in the
porches . .according to Wickett.
Roadrunner construction head
Lavelle Johnson agreed that the

University gave his company and
Atlantic "a lot of extra work with no
extra time," but denied his company
was responsible for Atlantic's delays.
"I got the job really late in August.
It should have been started in June.
But I came right in on time. I was the
first man on the job. The house was
cut two weeks before it was picked
up," he said.
"He [Wickett] was working in San
Jose on more buildings" while
Stillman house sat waiting to be
moved, according to Johnson.
Responsibility
While Roadrunner was responsible
for preparing Stillman house for

moving, the University charged
Atlantic directly with jacking up the
house and moving it down Lasuen
Street, he explained.
"I think [the University has) gone
overboard to help Ray Wickett.
"But everything has delayed the
house. We were late in laying the
foundation because Wickett couldn't
get us the materials. Kavinoky [the
University's representative] asked us
why we weren't starting to lay the
foundation and we told him.
"Kavinoky stepped in and got us
the materials," Johnson said, "but that
delayed the house."
Time Tables
Kavinoky said that Wickett had
accepted the University's extra work
demands and had established
timetables for their completion during
the job. Wickett did not meet these
deadlines, he said.
"He has been totally ineffective as
an administrator of work and men,"
Kavinoky said. "He still doesn't have a
bond, but we gave in on that
requirement, even though it was part
of the contract and he promised us he
would get one."
Stillman is only the first in a series
of houses that will be moved rather
than demolished in the Campus Drive
rerouting, Horton said. The housing
and planning offices already have
planned to move the Delta Upsilon
fraternity house next summer.

ready for them to move into by Oct.
15.
"We originally wanted to put
Columbae in the Tiki Motel," but
residents claimed they needed to have
an independent kitchen for their

cooperative, he said.
Women's Clubhouse
"We offered them the kitchen in
the Women's Clubhouse. We offered to
move beds into the Women's
Clubhouse for them," but Columbae
residents refused these offers as well,
he added.
"They finally persuaded us that if
their living group was to have a prayer
of succeeding, they had to have their
own house," Horton said.
Asst. Director of the Row,
Fraternities and Independent Houses
David Bell said simply, "Columbae was
in [University housing] earlier."
Another of the "whys" concerns
the accuracy of the initial occupancy
dates the housing office gave both
Columbae and Delt residents. Why
were they so late and why were they
so far off?
'Understandings'
Horton said the dates he and his
staff relayed to students were "based
on sets of understandings" from the
office of facilities planning,
construction and utilization. They
were established on "the best
information available" to him, he said.
In the instance of the delay from
Oct. 15 to Oct. 23 "we informed
students the same day we found out.
Most were informed within 24 hours,"
according to Horton.
Asst. Manager of Facilities
Planning, Construction and Utilization

Robert Kavinoky said the estimates he
gave the housing office "seemed
reasonable."
Kavinoky faulted the contractor,
Ray Wickett of Atlantic Housemovers,
for making • "promises he had no
intentions of keeping. All along his
estimates seemed reasonable to us. We
waited until there was just enough
time to do the job in early August
before we threatened to cancel his
contract," Kavinoky said.
Late Notification
As for the late notification of
"slippage dates," he replied, "we
waited as long as we thought prudent.
We based our decision of the best
appraisal we had, but the contractor
did not give us accurate estimates."
He added that rushing to change
the project's ready dates would be an
"unnecessary inconvenience" to
students and housing office
administrators. "We wait until we are
sure. We wait up to the moment we
still believe the job can be done," he
said.
But Wickett denied Kavinoky's
claim that the delays were his fault.
"The University wouldn't let me
get in on the job until Aug. 5 because I
didn't have a bond," Wickett said. The
University requires its contractors to
provide labor and materials bonds
from second parties. The bond insures
that the contractor will pay his

workmen and material suppliers.
"The University also added a lot of
extra work that they wanted us to do
that had nothing to do with the
original contract. And they didn't give
us any more time to do it.
Subcontractor Ready?
"Any my subcontractor,
Roadrunner Construction, was not
ready to go," he said. Roadrunner
delayed in "cutting the building in
two, laying the foundation, doing the
beam work, putting in the
porches . .according to Wickett.
Roadrunner construction head
Lavelle Johnson agreed that the

University gave his company and
Atlantic "a lot of extra work with no
extra time," but denied his company
was responsible for Atlantic's delays.
"I got the job really late in August.
It should have been started in June.
But I came right in on time. I was the
first man on the job. The house was
cut two weeks before it was picked
up," he said.
"He [Wickett] was working in San
Jose on more buildings" while
Stillman house sat waiting to be
moved, according to Johnson.
Responsibility
While Roadrunner was responsible
for preparing Stillman house for

moving, the University charged
Atlantic directly with jacking up the
house and moving it down Lasuen
Street, he explained.
"I think [the University has) gone
overboard to help Ray Wickett.
"But everything has delayed the
house. We were late in laying the
foundation because Wickett couldn't
get us the materials. Kavinoky [the
University's representative] asked us
why we weren't starting to lay the
foundation and we told him.
"Kavinoky stepped in and got us
the materials," Johnson said, "but that
delayed the house."
Time Tables
Kavinoky said that Wickett had
accepted the University's extra work
demands and had established
timetables for their completion during
the job. Wickett did not meet these
deadlines, he said.
"He has been totally ineffective as
an administrator of work and men,"
Kavinoky said. "He still doesn't have a
bond, but we gave in on that
requirement, even though it was part
of the contract and he promised us he
would get one."
Stillman is only the first in a series
of houses that will be moved rather
than demolished in the Campus Drive
rerouting, Horton said. The housing
and planning offices already have
planned to move the Delta Upsilon
fraternity house next summer.

While University-contracted
construction workers begin to finish
the Stillman house remodeling and
while University administrators ponder
the problems incurred in moving the
house, students displaced by the
setbacks in Stillman sit and fume.
Angered most by the delays are the
43 students who will eventually move
into the Delta Tau Delta fraternity
house.
Waiting, either off campus or in
"temporary University housing," these
students face moving their belongings
for at least the second time this
quarter. And they will move into a
house they have waited over a month
for.
"I'm pretty disappointed in the
school," said Delt resident Debby
Freeman, "[The delays] took me by
surprise. The housing office people are
trying their hardest, but I think the
administration could have stepped on
it [the construction] earlier.
"If the contractors had come
through, we wouldn't have had to
sweat through all of this," she said.
'Don't Know'
Another resident, Rick Sears
admitted, "I don't know what to
believe. It just seems like whoever was
setting the dates was deliberately lying
to us. They couldn't have know what
they were talking about.

"I went by the house when they
said it would be done in two weeks
and saw that there was no way they
were going to finish. I'm a little bit
mad about it all," he said.
Displaced residents of the Delt
house are understandably upset about
their wait, however they are disturbed
more by the apparent lack of answers
to the questions "why" surrounding
the entire Stillman house imbroglio.
"Why weren't we allowed to move
into our house instead of the
Columbae people?" queried Delt
resident George Dobbins.
'Reasonable'
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Larry Horton explained that he
"wanted very strongly to do what
seems reasonable" — to displace only
the 37 Columbae students instead of
80 students from both Columbae and
the Delt houses.
Horton said he and his staff tried to
move the Columbae people somewhere
other than the Delt house in
mid-September, but could find no
"alternatives" suitable to Columbae
residents. So he placed them in the
then-vacant Delt house with the
understanding that Stillman would be
ready for them to move into by Oct.
15.
"We originally wanted to put
Columbae in the Tiki Motel," but
residents claimed they needed to have
an independent kitchen for their

cooperative, he said.

"We offered them the kitchen in
the Women's Clubhouse. We offered to
