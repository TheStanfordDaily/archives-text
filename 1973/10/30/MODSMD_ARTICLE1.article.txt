# Delt Residents Upset By Delays
## 
### MARK SIMONIAN Second of two parts 
While University-contracted
construction workers begin to finish
the Stillman house remodeling and
while University administrators ponder
the problems incurred in moving the
house, students displaced by the
setbacks in Stillman sit and fume.
Angered most by the delays are the
43 students who will eventually move
into the Delta Tau Delta fraternity
house.
Waiting, either off campus or in
"temporary University housing," these
students face moving their belongings
for at least the second time this
quarter. And they will move into a
house they have waited over a month
for.
"I'm pretty disappointed in the
school," said Delt resident Debby
Freeman, "[The delays] took me by
surprise. The housing office people are
trying their hardest, but I think the
administration could have stepped on
it [the construction] earlier.
"If the contractors had come
through, we wouldn't have had to
sweat through all of this," she said.
'Don't Know'
Another resident, Rick Sears
admitted, "I don't know what to
believe. It just seems like whoever was
setting the dates was deliberately lying
to us. They couldn't have know what
they were talking about.

"I went by the house when they
said it would be done in two weeks
and saw that there was no way they
were going to finish. I'm a little bit
mad about it all," he said.
Displaced residents of the Delt
house are understandably upset about
their wait, however they are disturbed
more by the apparent lack of answers
to the questions "why" surrounding
the entire Stillman house imbroglio.
"Why weren't we allowed to move
into our house instead of the
Columbae people?" queried Delt
resident George Dobbins.
'Reasonable'
Assoc. Dean of Student Affairs
Larry Horton explained that he
"wanted very strongly to do what
seems reasonable" — to displace only
the 37 Columbae students instead of
80 students from both Columbae and
the Delt houses.
Horton said he and his staff tried to
move the Columbae people somewhere
other than the Delt house in
mid-September, but could find no
"alternatives" suitable to Columbae
residents. So he placed them in the
then-vacant Delt house with the
understanding that Stillman would be
ready for them to move into by Oct.
15.
"We originally wanted to put
Columbae in the Tiki Motel," but
residents claimed they needed to have
an independent kitchen for their

cooperative, he said.
Women's Clubhouse
"We offered them the kitchen in
the Women's Clubhouse. We offered to
move beds into the Women's
Clubhouse for them," but Columbae
residents refused these offers as well,
he added.
"They finally persuaded us that if
their living group was to have a prayer
of succeeding, they had to have their
own house," Horton said.
Asst. Director of the Row,
Fraternities and Independent Houses
David Bell said simply, "Columbae was
in [University housing] earlier."
Another of the "whys" concerns
the accuracy of the initial occupancy
dates the housing office gave both
Columbae and Delt residents. Why
were they so late and why were they
so far off?
'Understandings'
Horton said the dates he and his
staff relayed to students were "based
on sets of understandings" from the
office of facilities planning,
construction and utilization. They
were established on "the best
information available" to him, he said.
In the instance of the delay from
Oct. 15 to Oct. 23 "we informed
students the same day we found out.
Most were informed within 24 hours,"
according to Horton.
Asst. Manager of Facilities
Planning, Construction and Utilization

Robert Kavinoky said the estimates he
gave the housing office "seemed
reasonable."
Kavinoky faulted the contractor,
Ray Wickett of Atlantic Housemovers,
for making • "promises he had no
intentions of keeping. All along his
estimates seemed reasonable to us. We
waited until there was just enough
time to do the job in early August
before we threatened to cancel his
contract," Kavinoky said.
Late Notification
As for the late notification of
"slippage dates," he replied, "we
waited as long as we thought prudent.
We based our decision of the best
appraisal we had, but the contractor
did not give us accurate estimates."
He added that rushing to change
the project's ready dates would be an
"unnecessary inconvenience" to
students and housing office
administrators. "We wait until we are
sure. We wait up to the moment we
still believe the job can be done," he
said.
But Wickett denied Kavinoky's
claim that the delays were his fault.
"The University wouldn't let me
get in on the job until Aug. 5 because I
didn't have a bond," Wickett said. The
University requires its contractors to
provide labor and materials bonds
from second parties. The bond insures
that the contractor will pay his

HOUSING PROBLEMS — Stillman House, cut in two and moved to a new
location, still isn't ready for occupancy, and that fact has made some house
residents unhappy.
