# Serious Intent Demands Hard Work
## Impeachment Requires Organization

tomorrow on this page.)
Cambodia, impoundment,
Watergate, the Huston plan, the
Plumbers — the legal justifications
for impeaching the President are
now well known and have been
compellingly documented (see
Joseph Massey's column in the
October 26 Daily).
But the practical consequences
of these many dark episodes need
to be made equally clear. There is
a pattern here that keeps
repeating itself. We have a
President continually disposed
toward crisis and confrontation to
pursue his peculiar objectives, one
who knows no restraint save the
prospect of the total

disintegration or removal of his
authority to govern.
More crises, more defiant
challenges to every other sector of
government, seem certain to occur
as long as Richard Nixon is
President. Court battles over
impoundments will likely drag on
for months, even years, and new
appropriations will be impounded
in the meantime.
Investigations Continue
The investigations, revelations,
indictments and prosecutions of
the Watergate and related illegal
activities will continue throughout
his remaining term of office.
Judging by the previous pattern,
new extraordinary steps will likely
be taken by the President in a
desperate attempt to further
obfuscate the unravelling truth.
Retreats will continue to be
temporary, followed closely by
new constitutional
confrontations.
All questions of abstract
constitutional and moral issues
aside, the nation must ask itself
whether, practially, it can survive
three more years of these repeated
diarrhetic spasms of
confrontation.
The Department of Justice is
now in a shambles again. The
confidence in the President's
ability to govern is shattered, a
majority of the people now
believe he should resign.
Domestically, the President is still
unable to effectively focus on any
issue save his own lingering
personal crisis.
Defensive Need
His public appearances show
him in a mean and defensive
mood, and at war with the
nation's press in a fashion more
bitter and acrimonious than can
be recalled for any President in
our history.
This is a dangerously volatile
situation. The longer the
confrontation lingers and escalates
between the President and the
Congress, the President and the
courts, the President and the

press, and the President and the
people, the closer the nation
approaches to a complete
paralysis of governmental
functions in which nobody
recognizes anyone else's
authority.
Some of the shrewder liberals,
in a macabre sort of way, prefer
this situation to impeachment for
the opportunity it might allow to
cram some progressive legislation
down the throat of a weakened
Richard Nixon who would need

U.S. Constitution, Article 11, Section 4: The President, Vice
President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be
removed from Office on impeachment for, and Conviction
of, Treason, Bribery, or other High Crimes and
Misdemeanors.

to make some critical concessions
to survive. These liberals ought to
know better.
More than the long-range
future of our constitutional
system and its balance of powers,
the immediate future of our
country in the next three years
demands that this cancer be
surgically removed before it
infects and disables the whole
body politic.
Impeachment is the surgical
device that our founding fathers
provided. It is the final check on a
President who would assume the
totalitarian features of the
European kings whose total
powers they fled from, fought
against, and greatly feared.
But as a final check, a last
resort, it is an action of the
gravest implications, and so will
require a political movement more
sophisticated and effectively
organized than anything we have
been accustomed to mounting in
recent years.
Procedures
The realities of impeachment
in this nation today need urgently
to be clarified. The House of
Representatives — even its
Democratic leadership — is always
very cautious in its instincts.
Professor John Manley, Stanford's
most astute and knowledgeable

scholar of the Congressional
process, warns that the House
leadership is particularly reluctant
to make any decisive move on the
issue of impeachment.
The initial investigation by the
Judiciary into whether there
should be an investigation of
impeachment is essentially a
time-buying device, he judges, a
way to appease the more militant
cries for impeachment, not a
serious and determined exercise.

While it goes on, a lot ofsteam,
could go out of the movement for
impeachment.
Manley does not now see any
great internal groundswell in the
House for impeachment, having
just returned from Washington.
While impeachment is an
increasingly open subject of
conversation, it apparently lacks a
majority even within the
democratic caucus. The critical
mass of moderates just isn't ready
to move.
While the House Judiciary
Committee is a liberal domain,
stacked for years with pro-civil
rights votes, it is not clear that
they are the kind of liberals who
can mount a respectable move for
impeachment. It is even less clear
that they mean seriously to try,
unless extraordinary new events
occur or extraordinary new
evidence is uncovered.
What does seem clear is that
unless enormous, sustained, and
devastatingly organized pressure is
brought to bear on strategically
critical members of the House,
Richard Nixon will somehow
weather this crisis as he has
weathered all his others.
