No For Gerald Ford
Editor:
The House of Representatives
and the Senate currently are
setting the procedures for
considering the nomination of
Representative Gerald Ford as
Vice President of the United
States.
When that selection reaches the
floors of both Houses, the votes
might very well be the most
significant ever cast by any
present members of either body.
I do not support Mr. Ford
because, in my view, he lacks the
qualities to be President of the
United States, a consideration
which should be uppermost in the
debate process as his nomination
is considered.
Through the 25th amendment,
Congress has received an
unprecedented opportunity to
certify the qualifications of a Vice
President. I do not view this
merely as a rubber stamp
ratification proceeding.
It is easy to say on the present
record that Mr. Ford is an honest
and decent man and a member of
the"club." Congress, however,
must go far beyond that in
examination of his record. That
record, on even a superficial
examination, reveals Mr. Ford to
be essentially a "yes" man to the
President and one who has
consistently voted against the best
interests of labor, minorities and
the aged and one who has no

recognizable experience in the
conduct or understanding of
foreign affairs.
A vote cast by Mr. Ford against
Medicare is typical of his failure
to understand the needs of the
elderly. His 94 percent anti-labor
voting record over 25 years
expresses his contempt of working
people.
I do not subscribe to the
theory, which is unfortunately
much too prevalent here, that the
selection of a sincere "caretaker"
Vice President, a mediocrity with
no future ambition of his own, is
in the best interest of the country.
I further believe no nominee of
President Nixon should be
confirmed until the cloud of
impeachment hovering over the
President is cleared. That cloud
remains because of his present
refusal to disclose the Watergate
tapes.
If the Supreme Court this
December orders the President to
disclose the tapes and he refuses,
he will be impeached. Surely,
until that issue is decided his
successor ought not to be
confirmed.
There is no urgency in this
matter. Speaker Carl Albert —
now first in line of succession to
the White House - is an able
public servant and more qualified
than Mr. Ford to hold the
Nation's second highest office.

Proposition One
Editor:
We who believe in a fair sharing
of tax burdens are concerned that
Proposition One, which is
advertised as a tax limitation, will
in fact cause a tax shift. The
proposition limits only state
income tax. Deficiencies in state
and local funds resulting from
state income tax limitations will
have to be met from other, less
equitable revenue sources.
Increases in sales and property
taxes and increases in tuition and
license charged are probable

examples. These, unlike the
progressive income tax, place a
heavy burden on middle and low
income people.
Before it's too late, let's realize
that the term "tax limitation" is
misleading and determine the
likely shifts in taxation which
would result from the passing of
this initiative. Vote NO on
Proposition One.

Editor:
With the talk of impeachment

in the air, I would like to suggest
that we impeach Chip
Underwood. Not that I have ever
met Mr. Underwood or know
much about him, but I do know
that he has left his goddamned
campaign posters up on campus,
and that is irresponsible. With the
number of irresponsible people in
our national government (such as
it is), we don't need irresponsible
people in our student government
(such as it is). Impeach Chip
Underwood.

the"club." Congress, however,
must go far beyond that in
examination of his record. That
record, on even a superficial
examination, reveals Mr. Ford to
be essentially a "yes" man to the
President and one who has
consistently voted against the best
interests of labor, minorities and
the aged and one who has no

recognizable experience in the
conduct or understanding of
foreign affairs.
A vote cast by Mr. Ford against
Medicare is typical of his failure
to understand the needs of the
elderly. His 94 percent anti-labor
voting record over 25 years
expresses his contempt of working
people.
I do not subscribe to the
theory, which is unfortunately
much too prevalent here, that the
selection of a sincere "caretaker"
Vice President, a mediocrity with
no future ambition of his own, is
in the best interest of the country.
I further believe no nominee of
President Nixon should be
confirmed until the cloud of
impeachment hovering over the
President is cleared. That cloud
remains because of his present
refusal to disclose the Watergate
tapes.
If the Supreme Court this
December orders the President to
disclose the tapes and he refuses,
he will be impeached. Surely,
until that issue is decided his
successor ought not to be
confirmed.
There is no urgency in this
matter. Speaker Carl Albert —
now first in line of succession to
the White House - is an able
public servant and more qualified
than Mr. Ford to hold the
Nation's second highest office.

Proposition One
Editor:
We who believe in a fair sharing
of tax burdens are concerned that
Proposition One, which is
advertised as a tax limitation, will
in fact cause a tax shift. The
proposition limits only state
income tax. Deficiencies in state
and local funds resulting from
state income tax limitations will
have to be met from other, less
equitable revenue sources.
Increases in sales and property
taxes and increases in tuition and
license charged are probable

examples. These, unlike the
progressive income tax, place a
heavy burden on middle and low
income people.
Before it's too late, let's realize
that the term "tax limitation" is
misleading and determine the
likely shifts in taxation which
would result from the passing of
this initiative. Vote NO on
Proposition One.

Impeach Underwood
Editor:
With the talk of impeachment

in the air, I would like to suggest
that we impeach Chip
Underwood. Not that I have ever
met Mr. Underwood or know
much about him, but I do know
that he has left his goddamned
campaign posters up on campus,
and that is irresponsible. With the
number of irresponsible people in
our national government (such as
it is), we don't need irresponsible
people in our student government
(such as it is). Impeach Chip
Underwood.

No For Gerald Ford
Editor:
The House of Representatives
and the Senate currently are
setting the procedures for
considering the nomination of
Representative Gerald Ford as
Vice President of the United
States.
When that selection reaches the
floors of both Houses, the votes
might very well be the most
significant ever cast by any
present members of either body.
I do not support Mr. Ford
because, in my view, he lacks the
qualities to be President of the
United States, a consideration
which should be uppermost in the
debate process as his nomination
is considered.
Through the 25th amendment,
Congress has received an
unprecedented opportunity to
certify the qualifications of a Vice
President. I do not view this
merely as a rubber stamp
ratification proceeding.
It is easy to say on the present
record that Mr. Ford is an honest
and decent man and a member of
the"club." Congress, however,
must go far beyond that in
examination of his record. That
record, on even a superficial
examination, reveals Mr. Ford to
be essentially a "yes" man to the
