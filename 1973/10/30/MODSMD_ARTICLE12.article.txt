# Bike Insurance Firm Thrives
## 
### WAYNE MILLER 
Bikes are a source of business
for many thieves, but they are
providing even bigger business for
Yosemite Insurance Company, a
San Francisco-based firm. While
427 bikes have been stolen from
the Stanford campus in 1973 at a
reported total value of $33,757,
Yosemite has had more than
15,000 applicants for their bike
insurance plan and grossed a
round sum of $200,000.

The nine-year-old company — a
subsidary of Keene and Company,
an insurance firm based in Los
Angeles — started this unique
policy a year ago. Since then, sales
have jumped by "leaps and
bounds," according to Leslie
Gallager, spokeswoman for the
company. "From a 4 C rating' in
sales, we moved to an 'A rating'
during 1973," she noted.
Presently, Yosemite is the only
company offering a bike policy
plan. Most other companies —

such as All-State, Safeco and State
Farm — cover bicycles under their
comprehensive home owner's
policy. In general, these policies
cover "anything and everything in
the home," said a State Farm
spokesman. However, a $50
deduction makes "only expensive
10-speeds usually worth the
coverage," said a spokeswoman
for Safeco.
Nominal Cost
The cost of Yosemite is
nominal — $12 for $100 coverage,
and $4 for $50 additional
coverage. The policy insures
against partial and total loss of a
bike, but does not insure natural
deterioration of the cycle. The
insurance covers the bike for one
year, and can be renewed. The
only requirement is that the bike
be licensed.
On campus, licensing bicycles
is done through the Department
of Public Safety. A sticker is
placed on the bike frame and a
license number assigned — all for
one dollar. According to officer
Jack Donals, a bicycle license is
also required by a Santa Clara
ordinance.
Police figures show that
through September of this year,
2576 bikes have been registered
here in 1973. This is a relatively
small percentage of the total bike
population on campus, according
to Donals. "With off-campus and
faculty bike users, there's no way
we can find the exact
percentage," he said.

Thieves will steal any bike,
Donal noted. Generally, 10-speeds
disappear in rashes, and no
specific model is most coveted. As
for as insurance is concerned,
Donals is indifferent. "I don't see
it doing much to prevent thefts,"
he said.
Carrying insurance does not
cover all the cyclist's problems.
For example, if his bike is stolen,
the client must wait at least 45
days for a replacement. According
to the company, this gives the
local police a chance to track it
down.
Partial Damage
When a bike is damaged only
partially, $25 is deducted from
the sum the company pays out.
"There are some who would slash
their tires otherwise, and then ask
for money," Kricorian said.
Yosemite admits its making a
fat profit. "We have relatively
small [operational] costs. Since
our system is computerized with
lists of subscribers in the memory
banks, any question concerning a
particular insuree is referred to
the computer to resolve," said
Gallager.
Although no figures were
available, company out-payments
have not offset significantly the
original incoming $200,000. "We
deal with a large mass volume,"
says Gallager. A simple formula:
the company sells as many
policies it can across the U.S., and
the income from that has
exceeded losses so far.

is done through the Department
of Public Safety. A sticker is
placed on the bike frame and a
license number assigned — all for
one dollar. According to officer
Jack Donals, a bicycle license is
also required by a Santa Clara
ordinance.
Police figures show that
through September of this year,
2576 bikes have been registered
here in 1973. This is a relatively
small percentage of the total bike
population on campus, according
to Donals. "With off-campus and
faculty bike users, there's no way
we can find the exact
percentage," he said.

Thieves will steal any bike,
Donal noted. Generally, 10-speeds
disappear in rashes, and no
specific model is most coveted. As
for as insurance is concerned,
Donals is indifferent. "I don't see
it doing much to prevent thefts,"
he said.
Carrying insurance does not
cover all the cyclist's problems.
For example, if his bike is stolen,
the client must wait at least 45
days for a replacement. According
to the company, this gives the
local police a chance to track it
down.
Partial Damage
When a bike is damaged only
partially, $25 is deducted from
the sum the company pays out.
"There are some who would slash
their tires otherwise, and then ask
for money," Kricorian said.
Yosemite admits its making a
fat profit. "We have relatively
small [operational] costs. Since
our system is computerized with
lists of subscribers in the memory
banks, any question concerning a
particular insuree is referred to
the computer to resolve," said
Gallager.
Although no figures were
available, company out-payments
have not offset significantly the
original incoming $200,000. "We
deal with a large mass volume,"
says Gallager. A simple formula:
the company sells as many
policies it can across the U.S., and
the income from that has
exceeded losses so far.
Bikes are a source of business
for many thieves, but they are
providing even bigger business for
Yosemite Insurance Company, a
San Francisco-based firm. While
427 bikes have been stolen from
the Stanford campus in 1973 at a
reported total value of $33,757,
Yosemite has had more than
15,000 applicants for their bike
insurance plan and grossed a
round sum of $200,000.

The nine-year-old company — a
subsidary of Keene and Company,
an insurance firm based in Los
Angeles — started this unique
policy a year ago. Since then, sales
have jumped by "leaps and
bounds," according to Leslie
Gallager, spokeswoman for the
company. "From a 4 C rating' in
sales, we moved to an 'A rating'
during 1973," she noted.
Presently, Yosemite is the only
company offering a bike policy
plan. Most other companies —

such as All-State, Safeco and State
Farm — cover bicycles under their
comprehensive home owner's
policy. In general, these policies
cover "anything and everything in
the home," said a State Farm
spokesman. However, a $50
deduction makes "only expensive
10-speeds usually worth the
coverage," said a spokeswoman
for Safeco.
Nominal Cost
The cost of Yosemite is
nominal — $12 for $100 coverage,
and $4 for $50 additional
coverage. The policy insures
against partial and total loss of a
bike, but does not insure natural
deterioration of the cycle. The
insurance covers the bike for one
year, and can be renewed. The
only requirement is that the bike
be licensed.
