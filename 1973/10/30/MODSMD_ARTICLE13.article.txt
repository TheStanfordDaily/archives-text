# P.A. Voters Laud Stanford Growth
## 
### 
Four out of five Palo Alto voters believethe University'sgrowth has
helped the quality of life in their community and that the University
has been "about right" in its land development policies, preliminary
results of a new survey indicate.
Three out of four said they felt the University had been a "good
neighbor" to the city, while only one in 20 felt it had not. When
asked why they felt this way, half the respondents said the University
simply was "good for Palo Alto," while one in five (21 percent)
mentioned the "good citizenship" or "community participation" of
the University.
Only 11 percent could mention any reason why the University had
not been a good neighbor. Overdomination (5 percent), disagreement
with land use (3 percent), and "bad effect on the character of the
city" because of radicals (2 percent) were mentioned.
The survey was conducted during May and June by students in a
communication class taught by Prof. Nathan Maccoby. Findings were
based on 169 responses from randomly selected registered voters
within 10 randomly selected precincts of the city.
Palo Alto Control
Approximately two-thirds said they felt Palo Alto voters should
have no control or only slight control (47 percent) over decisions
concerning the University's future, while one in four felt voters should
have "quite a bit of control," and two percent favored complete
control.
(The Palo Alto Planning Commission recently moved to gain veto
power over all future buildings on campus, a proposal which has been
sharply criticized by University officials.)
More than a thirdof the respondents reported personal ties with the
University as alumni (10 percent), family connections (9 percent),
students (7 percent), faculty (5 percent), or staff members (5
percent).
Fifty-four percent felt the University had "about the right amount
of power" in its relations with the city, although those who felt the
University had too much power outnumbered those who felt it had
too little (15 percent to 9 percent).
When asked how much "say" the University has about how Palo
Alto is run, 15 percent said "a great deal," 33 percent replied
"some," 28 percent indicated "very little" and 5 percent felt the
University had no influence.
When asked if they felt the University "has developed too much,"
two-thirds said no, while one fourth said yes.
Open Space
Questioned about future development of the University's open
space, a majority (5 percent) gave limited approval, indicating the
University should try to keep open space, while a third favored
maintaining the status quo.
Half the respondents felt the University now has the right amount
of freedom to decide how to use its lands. The proportion feeling the
University should have more freedom in this respect slightly exceeded
those who felt its freedom should be restricted.
When asked how they felt about possible future uses of Stanford
lands, nearly three-fourths rated retention of open land "very
important," while nearly two-thirds placed additions to the hospital in
the same category. (Three-fourths reported that they or members of
their family had been treated at the hospital.)
A clear majority rated construction of low income housing as "very
important."

When asked how much "say" the University has about how Palo
Alto is run, 15 percent said "a great deal," 33 percent replied
"some," 28 percent indicated "very little" and 5 percent felt the
University had no influence.
When asked if they felt the University "has developed too much,"
two-thirds said no, while one fourth said yes.
Open Space
Questioned about future development of the University's open
space, a majority (5 percent) gave limited approval, indicating the
University should try to keep open space, while a third favored
maintaining the status quo.
Half the respondents felt the University now has the right amount
of freedom to decide how to use its lands. The proportion feeling the
University should have more freedom in this respect slightly exceeded
those who felt its freedom should be restricted.
When asked how they felt about possible future uses of Stanford
lands, nearly three-fourths rated retention of open land "very
important," while nearly two-thirds placed additions to the hospital in
the same category. (Three-fourths reported that they or members of
their family had been treated at the hospital.)
A clear majority rated construction of low income housing as "very
important."
Four out of five Palo Alto voters believethe University'sgrowth has
helped the quality of life in their community and that the University
has been "about right" in its land development policies, preliminary
results of a new survey indicate.
Three out of four said they felt the University had been a "good
neighbor" to the city, while only one in 20 felt it had not. When
asked why they felt this way, half the respondents said the University
simply was "good for Palo Alto," while one in five (21 percent)
mentioned the "good citizenship" or "community participation" of
the University.
Only 11 percent could mention any reason why the University had
not been a good neighbor. Overdomination (5 percent), disagreement
with land use (3 percent), and "bad effect on the character of the
city" because of radicals (2 percent) were mentioned.
The survey was conducted during May and June by students in a
communication class taught by Prof. Nathan Maccoby. Findings were
based on 169 responses from randomly selected registered voters
within 10 randomly selected precincts of the city.
Palo Alto Control
Approximately two-thirds said they felt Palo Alto voters should
have no control or only slight control (47 percent) over decisions
concerning the University's future, while one in four felt voters should
have "quite a bit of control," and two percent favored complete
control.
(The Palo Alto Planning Commission recently moved to gain veto
power over all future buildings on campus, a proposal which has been
sharply criticized by University officials.)
More than a thirdof the respondents reported personal ties with the
University as alumni (10 percent), family connections (9 percent),
students (7 percent), faculty (5 percent), or staff members (5
percent).
Fifty-four percent felt the University had "about the right amount
of power" in its relations with the city, although those who felt the
University had too much power outnumbered those who felt it had
too little (15 percent to 9 percent).
