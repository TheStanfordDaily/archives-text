# African Famine Relief
## Chef Leads Aid Program 
### LARRY LITVAK 
"Big Daddy" Dave McCullum,
long a provider of culinary
delights at the Stanford Faculty
Club, begins a more consequential
task this week — helping to
provide food for millions in west
Africa who lost their crops to an
intense drought this year.
Between Nov. 1 and Dec. 15,
McCullum, head chief at the
Faculty Club, hopes to raise
$25,000 for African famine relief
by selling home-cooked meals to
staff, faculty and students in the
Stanford community.

The idea for the project
developed from what McCullum
called "a feeling that this is not
the time to damn those people
and say let them starve."
The price of each meal will be
$2.50 and entrees include
Southern Fried Chicken, Bar-B-Q
Ribs, and Shack Fried Fish, with
french fries and cole slaw a part
of each meal. Orders can be place
by telephone at 322-5794 up to
8:30 each evening and will be
delivered to the front of the
purchaser's residence at any
specified time between 9 p.m. and
midnight.

If any other items, such as
cigarettes or sundries are
requested, McCullum wiil pick
them up and deliver them with
the order.
About 50 cents from each meal
sold will be forwarded to West
Africa via the Bay Area office of
the African Famine Relief Aid
Program, with only the basic cost
of the ingredients, about $1 per
meal, taken out. The eventual aid
will take the form of food and
agricultural assistance.
The African Famine Relief Aid
Program, a national umbrella
group, has been endorsed by such
organizations as the AFL-CIO and
the NAACP, with McCullum's
unique project only one of many
local efforts throughout the
country. Blacl* Students Union
here plans to initiate its own
independent relief work later in
the quarter.
Several thousand dinners must
be purchased and cooked if the
$25,000 figure is to be reached,
but McCullum feels confident that
the Stanford community will
respond to a worthwhile program.
If this phase of the project is a
success, he wants to raise $50,000
in aid during winter quarter.
This will be a family project,
with McCullum's wife Donna and
Gve children helping in the
preparation at his home and the
delivery to residences.
"This program is not being set
up to beg, but we intend to earn
each and every penny of it,"
McCullum emphasized. He said he
thinks the meal will be especially
popular "with trailer and
apartment residents, as well as
dorm groups having parties and
hungry students during finals."

unique project only one of many
local efforts throughout the
country. Blacl* Students Union
here plans to initiate its own
independent relief work later in
the quarter.
Several thousand dinners must
be purchased and cooked if the
$25,000 figure is to be reached,
but McCullum feels confident that
the Stanford community will
respond to a worthwhile program.
If this phase of the project is a
success, he wants to raise $50,000
in aid during winter quarter.
This will be a family project,
with McCullum's wife Donna and
Gve children helping in the
preparation at his home and the
delivery to residences.
"This program is not being set
up to beg, but we intend to earn
each and every penny of it,"
McCullum emphasized. He said he
thinks the meal will be especially
popular "with trailer and
apartment residents, as well as
dorm groups having parties and
hungry students during finals."

OPERATION SENTINEL—Over 800 busses serving the Peninsula, the East Bay, and San Francisco are
now carrying signs pointing out that housing discrimination is illegal. Sponsored by the Stanford
Mid-Peninsula Urban Coalition, the program assists persons who experience racial or religious
discrimination.
"Big Daddy" Dave McCullum,
long a provider of culinary
delights at the Stanford Faculty
Club, begins a more consequential
task this week — helping to
provide food for millions in west
Africa who lost their crops to an
intense drought this year.
Between Nov. 1 and Dec. 15,
McCullum, head chief at the
Faculty Club, hopes to raise
$25,000 for African famine relief
by selling home-cooked meals to
staff, faculty and students in the
Stanford community.

The idea for the project
developed from what McCullum
called "a feeling that this is not
the time to damn those people
and say let them starve."
The price of each meal will be
$2.50 and entrees include
Southern Fried Chicken, Bar-B-Q
Ribs, and Shack Fried Fish, with
french fries and cole slaw a part
of each meal. Orders can be place
by telephone at 322-5794 up to
8:30 each evening and will be
delivered to the front of the
purchaser's residence at any
specified time between 9 p.m. and
midnight.

If any other items, such as
cigarettes or sundries are
requested, McCullum wiil pick
them up and deliver them with
the order.
About 50 cents from each meal
sold will be forwarded to West
Africa via the Bay Area office of
the African Famine Relief Aid
Program, with only the basic cost
of the ingredients, about $1 per
meal, taken out. The eventual aid
will take the form of food and
agricultural assistance.
The African Famine Relief Aid
Program, a national umbrella
group, has been endorsed by such
organizations as the AFL-CIO and
the NAACP, with McCullum's
unique project only one of many
local efforts throughout the
country. Blacl* Students Union
