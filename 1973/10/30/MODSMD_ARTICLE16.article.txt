# Christmas Cutbacks Planned
## 
### 
An Associated Press survey showed that with a little less than two
months to go before Dec. 25, many civic and business groups have
canceled or cut back on plans for Christmas decorations in an effort
to conserve power.
Even Bethlehem, Pa., known as "The Christmas City," is in an
uproar. Mayor H.G. Payrow announced that Christmas decorations
would be cut back by 80 percent, saving 52 million watts of
electricity.
Businessmen and residents objected, however, saying the cutback
would hurt the tourist business and officials are still trying to work
out a compromise.
The problem stems from a general fuel shortage, complicated by
cutbacks in Arab oil production because of the Middle East war.
Officials in Austin, Tex., where shortages of natural gas have
affected electricity production, said Christmas lights will be turned on
as usual on Nov. 21 and will be burned until Nov. 25, but then will be
shut off until Dec. 14 when they'll be relit.
In addition, holiday lighting displays on bridges across the
Colorado River will be eliminated this year and businesses have been
ordered to restrict their holiday spectaculars.
A business association in Pittsburgh announced that because of the
energy crunch, the lighting on 60 downtown buildings, a tradition
since 1960, will be canceled this year.
The Building Owners and Managers Association said that although
the city has enough power, the cancellation was intended "as a
meaningful gesture to the rest of the nation whose energy situation is
far more critical."
