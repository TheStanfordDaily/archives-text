# Nation Ignores TV's Effect
## 
### 
Everybody's concerned about
school teachers, but few people
care about the TV tube when it
comes to influencing what our
children learn, a psychologist here
observes.
"The contrast is striking
between the American public's
preoccupation with governing the
schooling of the nation's children
and their indifference to
governing what these same
children leam from commercial
time," Prof. Alberta Siegel of the
Department of Psychiatry writes
in a preface to Ilie Early Window:
Effects of Television on Children
and Youth.
"We hear few complaints about
truancy from TV, and the TV
dropout is almost unknown," she
notes.
Because children aren't big
spenders, most of what they
watch on TV is programming
intended for older viewers, Siegel
adds. Adults are "most
sophisticated in the ways of the
world, more cognizant of the
difference between fantasy and
reality, more aware of the
purposes of advertising.
"For older viewers, what is
learned on TV is balanced against
what has been learned from
reading, in school, and from life

experience. And the content of
TV is filtered through a more
mature nervous system.
"For the very young viewer, on
the other hand, the content of TV
is so different from anything in
his life experience that he has no
countervailing sources of
information. An illiterate, he
cannot turn to books or
newspapers for other perspectives
on the world. His own intelligence
is still developing and very likely
is unequal to the task of assessing
and evaluating what he sees on
TV."
A member of the Surgeon
General's Committee which
studied the impact of TV on
children, Siegel notes that "by age
three or four the American child
is a regular TV watched.
"The youngster graduating
from high school today has spent
many more hours in front of the
tube than he has in the classroom.
"[Yet] as TV viewers, young
children are essentially intruders,
outsiders, unexpected guests.
They are voyeurs of a scene
intended for other eyes,
eavesdroppers on words meant for
other ears."
The authors of the book are
Robert M. Liebert, John M. Neale,
and Emily S. Davidson, all of the
State University of New York at
Stony Brook.
They conclude that results of
50 different studies, involving
more than 10,000 normal children
and adolescents from every
conceivable background show
"the demonstrated teaching and
instigating effects of aggressive TV
fare upon youth are of sufficient
importance to warrant immediate
remedial action. . . .
"Even aside from its violent
content, U.S. commercial TV for
children appears to be the worst
in the free world. As of July
1P"1 only the U.S. and Finland

did not offer weekday afternoon
programs designed especially for
children."
In addition to an "immediate,
sharp decrease" in the amount of
violence shown," they declare, an
"equally enthusiastic effort"
should be made to increase the
number of programs designed to
teach positive lessons to young
persons.
Quoting former Federal
Communications Commission
member . Nicholas Johnson, they
observe that "all television is
educational television. The only
question is, what is it teaching?"
"Technology has given us a
uniquely potent teacher — and in
a complex society like our own,
effective teachers are much
needed. ... In the past, children
have seen and learned violence on
TV's window. Today they
continue to do so. In the future,
they might, instead, learn
constructive solutions to the
problems they will face.
"Which will it be? The choice
is ours."

In addition to an "immediate,
sharp decrease" in the amount of

"equally enthusiastic effort"
should be made to increase the
number of programs designed to
teach positive lessons to young
persons.
Quoting former Federal
Communications Commission
member . Nicholas Johnson, they
observe that "all television is
educational television. The only
question is, what is it teaching?"
"Technology has given us a
uniquely potent teacher — and in
a complex society like our own,
effective teachers are much
needed. ... In the past, children
have seen and learned violence on
TV's window. Today they
continue to do so. In the future,
they might, instead, learn
constructive solutions to the
problems they will face.
"Which will it be? The choice
is ours."
Everybody's concerned about
school teachers, but few people
care about the TV tube when it
comes to influencing what our
children learn, a psychologist here
observes.
"The contrast is striking
between the American public's
preoccupation with governing the
schooling of the nation's children
and their indifference to
governing what these same
children leam from commercial
time," Prof. Alberta Siegel of the
Department of Psychiatry writes
in a preface to Ilie Early Window:
Effects of Television on Children
and Youth.
"We hear few complaints about
truancy from TV, and the TV
dropout is almost unknown," she
notes.
Because children aren't big
spenders, most of what they
watch on TV is programming
intended for older viewers, Siegel
adds. Adults are "most
sophisticated in the ways of the
world, more cognizant of the
difference between fantasy and
reality, more aware of the
purposes of advertising.
"For older viewers, what is
learned on TV is balanced against
what has been learned from
reading, in school, and from life

experience. And the content of
TV is filtered through a more
mature nervous system.
"For the very young viewer, on
the other hand, the content of TV
is so different from anything in
his life experience that he has no
countervailing sources of
information. An illiterate, he
cannot turn to books or
newspapers for other perspectives
on the world. His own intelligence
is still developing and very likely
is unequal to the task of assessing
and evaluating what he sees on
TV."
A member of the Surgeon
General's Committee which
studied the impact of TV on
children, Siegel notes that "by age
three or four the American child
is a regular TV watched.
"The youngster graduating
from high school today has spent
many more hours in front of the
tube than he has in the classroom.
"[Yet] as TV viewers, young
children are essentially intruders,
outsiders, unexpected guests.
They are voyeurs of a scene
intended for other eyes,
eavesdroppers on words meant for
other ears."
The authors of the book are

and Emily S. Davidson, all of the

They conclude that results of
50 different studies, involving
more than 10,000 normal children
and adolescents from every
conceivable background show
"the demonstrated teaching and
instigating effects of aggressive TV
fare upon youth are of sufficient
importance to warrant immediate
remedial action. . . .
"Even aside from its violent
content, U.S. commercial TV for
children appears to be the worst
in the free world. As of July
