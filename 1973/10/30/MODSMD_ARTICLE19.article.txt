# Internship Program Announced
## 
### 
Two years ago, the Council of
Presidents initiated internship
positions on University
Committees. Freshman and
transfer students at Stanford now

member of a committee, with the
exception that he/she may not

not of great significance since all

consensus, not by vote.
This is an excellent
opportunity for new students to
get • involved with Student
Government here at Stanford.

the ASSU office in Tresidder

are due no later than November 9
