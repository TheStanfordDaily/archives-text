## McCloskey Denounces Nixon 
### MIKE PHILLIPS 
Rep. Paul N. McCloskey, R-Menlo
Park, told a large audience in
Cubberley Auditorium last night that
President Richard Nixon's
impeachment should come as a result
of his "high crimes and
misdemeanors" and not as an
emotional reaction by the public.
McCloskey said that Nixon's

authorization of bugging and illegal
entry to secure information on activist
groups in the early 1970's was "the
parentage and precursor of Watergate
itself."
"The peril that faces the world is
that the public wants to give the
president greater and greater powers to
deal with problems," McCloskey
added.
According to McCloskey, Nixon has
placed himself above the law in seizing
power. The framers of the
constitution, he emphasized, had
intended that the President be
governed by the same statutes as the
American public.
Chides Public
He chided the public, though, for
its "acquiescence" in letting the
executive's power expand.
To some, he said, the President
represents the security of the nation,
and an enlargement of his powers is
beneficial to the country. He added
that executive power has also
expanded as a result of apathy, both
on and off the campus.
"Public opinion will decide whether
or not Nixon is impeached," he said.
"Every group that exerts public
pressure is needed. These organizing
pressures can do more than anything
you can say to me."
Ordinary Law
McCloskey downplayed the
relevance of the invasion of Cambodia
and the dismissal of Archibald Cox,
the former Judicial Prosecutor in the
Watergate case, to impeachment
proceedings. He said that stronger
grounds for the president's removal lay
in the violation of ordinary law.

Citing the delay of an early
investigation into the Watergate affair
last spring, McCloskey said that Nixon
was guilty of abstructing the free flow
of information.
He also claimed executive
impropriety when it was disclosed that
large contributions to the Nixon
campaign by milk producer
cooperative fund closely proceeded
the lifting of milk price supports.
McCloskey discussed the pending
confirmations of Rep. Gerald Ford to
the vice presidency, saying he
expected Ford's appointment in two
to four weeks. "Ford is an honest,
decent man," he said, "Who has the
capacity to bring people together
without rancor after debate."
He expressed hope that if
impeachment proceedings develop,
then Senators and Representatives will
ignore party lines and deal with the
evidence within "a lega, constitutional,
and historical context."
