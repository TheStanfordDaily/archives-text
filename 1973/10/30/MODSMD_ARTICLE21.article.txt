Why does the University
require all students to register
their cars with the Public Safety
Department? What does it do with
the $10 registration fee? How
does it enforce this requirement?
What legal ( force does the
registration requirement have?

Helene Ingelson, department
secretary for Police Services, said
that the main reason the
University wants vehicles
registered is so that in case of an
emergency involving a vehicle the
owner can be contacted or
identified quickly.
She said that the money from
registration goes into a general
fund that is used to pay for
parking lot and road maintenance.
Ingelson said that a car without
a registration sticker parked in a
marked zone would be cited. The
owner then has to pay the fine in
municipal court.
Apparently, if you have
enough money and an urge to
buck the system you can refuse to
register your car. Ingelson cited
the case of one student who paid
about $10 a week in fines for five
years because he did not register
his car.
