# Administration To Submit Oil Plan
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Nixon
administration was reported yesterday to be putting
the finishing touches on a legislative proposal calling
for action to cope with any petroleum supply
emergency.
An Interior Department spokesman said the
proposal was sent yesterday to the White House
Office of Management and Budget, which
coordinates agency comments and acts as the
administration's clearing house for all legislative
proposals.
Last Wednesday Sen. Henry M. Jackson,
D-Wash., who has already proposed petroleum
emergency legislation, said the administration
agreed on the need for such authority and would
submit its own version soon.
No details of the administration proposal were
immediately available, but it was expected to follow
the general lines of Jackson's approach, in which a
petroleum shortage of five percent or more would
touch off a series of federal, state and local actions.
Jackson's approach would require the
preparation of a federal standby fuel rationing

program which could be quickly activated if needed.
It would also require power plants which can do
so to switch from petroleum to coal and it would
require state governments to prepare petroleum
emergency plans for conserving fuel.
Mandatory fuel conservation measures might
include reductions of highway speed limits.
Jackson had expected the administration
proposal by last Friday but that deadline was missed
and the Interior spokesman said the proposal
probably would go to Congress this week.
Jackson, chairman of the Senate Interior
Committee, said last week that representatives of
the White House, the Interior Department, and the
State Department had met with his committee and
that everyone agreed on the need for such
legislation.
But he said the administration had points of its
own which it wanted to emphasize and would
therefore propose its own bill.
Jackson said his Interior committee was prepared
to act quickly on petroleum emergency legislation
and to report a bill to the Senate floor within a
matter of days.
