# New Orleans Jazz Delights Crowd
## 
### DANIEL BRENNER 
In an age when the slick,
extravagant, and pretentious holds
sway of mainstream American
entertainment, it was thoroughly
refreshing to be among the
capacity Memorial Hall crowd
who enjoyed the Preservation Hall
Jazz Band last Friday night. TTie
thunderous applause which
greeted every number showed
once again the love affair between
this band and the Stanford
community.
The directness and simply
integrity that characterizes the
band's work appeals to everyone.
The musicians, all but two in their
60s, 70s, and 80s, seem to have
such an extraordinarily good time
with their music that the spirit is
catching.
Queen of the band is
73-year-old Billie Pierce, who
plays the piano with the verve and
enthusiasm of a woman one-third
her age. Occasionally she would
belt out a few blues lyrics that
sent the crowd clapping and
stomping.
The leading hom men are the
Humphrey brothers, Willie and
Percy. Willie's clarinet playing
received the most enthusiastic
applause as his fingers typed out
the melody at a hundred notes per
minute.
Like A Good Friend
Percy's comet playing and
singing were enthusiastically
applauded. To my mind his
playing was so direct and
uncontrived that it seemed as if I
was just listening to a good friend
play rather than watching a
performance.
Appearing in the place of
regular cometist DeDe Pierce,
Percy also did most of the vocals.
His singing of "When TheSaintsGo
Marchin' In" brought the house to

its feet and eventually onto the
stage — it was that kind of
evening.
The mastermind of the
Preservation Hall Band, as well as
its tuba player, is Allan Jaffe.
Along with his wife Sandra, Jaffe
set out in 1961 to rejuvenate the
real New Orleans jazz and to give
both steady work and proper
praise to the musicians who are
part of this distinctly American
tradition.
Jaffe's tuba sounds were nearly
always energetic. With puffy
enthusiasm he bounced up and
down in the back of the band
with that enormous tuba, always
moving to the sideline when one
of the other band members went
into a solo.
82-Year-Old Trombonist
The trombonist, "Big Jim"
Robinson, was bom in 1890 and
began to play the trombone
during World War I with the Army
Band in France. The show's most
amiable personality, he cavorted
on stage with charm and played
his hom with precision.
It is said New Orleans
musicians are by nature a friendly
lot, that it takes only a minute to

get to know true New Orleans
musicians. This was certainly true
last Friday evening. As members
of the audience joined in the
Saints parade, one middle-aged
gentleman who was cheering and
whooping like a high school
cheerleader turned around and
apologized, "I don't know what it
is, they're just, they're just
incredible. . .
Preservation Hall Jazz Band
maintains the sound and the
feeling of the "good time" music
that was bom in New Orleans just
about the time that the older
members of the band were

growing up. The easy-going,
almost hypnotic rhythm, is
natural to the ear and simple to
comprehend.
Direct Communication
The idea is not to obscure the
sound but to communicate it as
directly, eloquently, and
passionately as can be done. From
the zesty, joyful fast numbers to
the bittersweet, soulful blues, the
band communicated strongly with
the crowd.
Kudos go to Public Events
impresario Tom Bacchetti for
managing to book the
Preservation Hall Jazz Band

during the school year as well as
during last summer, so that
regular students could enjoy their
music as local audiences have for
the past seven summers.
A type of Gresham's law seems
to be replacing directness and
tradition in our society with
deception and pop-living. Fads
quickly replace each other, leaving
only enough of themselves in our
culture so that they may be
recycled as nostalgia a few years
later. It was good indeed to see
the music of this jazz band, so
direct and pure £n American
idiom, be played so well and
received so warmly.

widely applauded soloist in last Friday's Preservation Hall Jazz Band
concert in Mem Aud. Cometist DeDe Pierce, left, did not make this
trip with the band, and was replaced by Humphrey's brother Percy.

summer.
