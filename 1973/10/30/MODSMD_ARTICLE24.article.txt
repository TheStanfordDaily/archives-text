# Audience Becomes The Playwright In Pitschel Players' Improvisation
## 
### JAMES LOBSENZ 
SAN FRANCISCO - Audience
participation, as a theatrical
technique, can be a very
successful way of making a
production more entertaining. It
grabs the passive theatergoer and
thrusts him into a higher gear that

demands something more from
him than occasional clapping.
Improvisational theater takes
this notion of forcing the
audience into an active role one
enchanting step further, and
allows the theatergoer to go
beyond the role of an actor to
that of a playwright. Thus he not
only sees and acts, he creates.
Essentially it boils down to an
exploitation of man's desire to
exercise power. Playwrights are
omniscient, truly godlike figures
as long as they are viewed within
the confines of their fictitious
worlds. Improvisational theater
owes its seductive appeal to this
simple craving for power, for
nothing turns on the theater goer
more than a chance to be, even if
just for a moment, All-Knowing
and All-Powerful.
The Pitschel Players, now
performing at The Intersection on
Friday and Saturday nights, do an
outstanding job of fostering this
feeling of power within the souls
of those who comprise their
evening congregations. I left with
the distinct impression that I
personally had been manipulating
the entire cast all night long; as if
I had spent a few hours in pulling
strings and making puppets dance.
The players stress the fact that
the skits they fabricate

extemporaneously are always
products of the suggestions that
the audience renders them.
Imagine the thrill one rabid
Oakland A's fan got when his
request for a satire on the World
Series was honored with a special
ABC Sports Broadcast featuring
bloodthirsty Mets and Mets fans,
variously engaged in hurling
grenades, firing cannons and
sniping at outfielders.
No doubt all A's fans in the
audience felt that the righteous
had received their due revenge
when Lindsey Nelson gave a
bullet-by-bullet description of a
play initiated by "Never-say-die"
Campenaris, who mercilessly
machine-gunned the entire Mets
team as they lounged in their
dugout, early in the 7th inning.
Campenaris played the entire
game "courageously," shaking off
the pain of a "hamstrung torso"
injury, incurred when he was
"slowed up" by a land mine while
attempting to steal third.
The Walter Cronkite interview
with a UFO space captain,
inspired by a freaky-looking
teenybopper about two seats to
my left, was a tremendous hit.
The good captain obligingly
informed Walter that his trips to
planet earth, undertaken roughly
once every flimrak (equivalent to
about seven earth football
seasons) were actually quite
relaxing little space jaunts. In fact,
they're nothing more than "milk
runs" — routine deliveries of
shiploads of mungos, a kind of
inter-galactic space banana.
Fantasies
Just before intermission, the
audience was questioned as to
what their favorite fantasies were.
A stately, white-haired gentleman

in the front row voiced his
lifelong aspiration of achieving
human flight. Before the night
was over he obtained his wish
when he flew, well, fell at any
rate, a full fifteen feet into the
receptive and collective arms of
the cast.
Some spectators were
somewhat more in touch "with
the real world." One of these
pragmatic individuals claimed to
be plagued by an uncontrollable
and savage desire to see President
Nixon resign. He too, got his wish
(from the cast).
If you admire spontaneous wit
you should certainly go see the
Pitschel Players. Their
rambunctiousness and
childishness, while unreal at times,
can be contagious and refreshing.
If you loath childish and
rambunctious people, but you are
interested in studying abnormal
psychology, you should definitely
go see the Pitschel Players. (Only
the Pitschel Players distribute free
kazoos to everybody during the
Grand Finale Number.)
I caution all, however, to go
expecting something less than
perfection. Even with the very
best of acting talent,
improvisational theater inevitably
lays a few eggs with nearly every
production. Yet while I won't
guarantee you that every act the
Players do will prove a winner, I
will guarantee that they will bat
well over .500.
The skits are embellished
admirably by what can best be
described as "impressionistic
piano music." The piano player,
whose notes are heavily flavored
with ragtime and honky-tonk
tunes, is alone well worth the
$1.50 admission price.

SAN FRANCISCO - Audience
participation, as a theatrical
technique, can be a very
successful way of making a
production more entertaining. It
grabs the passive theatergoer and
thrusts him into a higher gear that

demands something more from
him than occasional clapping.
Improvisational theater takes
this notion of forcing the
audience into an active role one
enchanting step further, and
allows the theatergoer to go
beyond the role of an actor to
that of a playwright. Thus he not
only sees and acts, he creates.
Essentially it boils down to an
exploitation of man's desire to
exercise power. Playwrights are
omniscient, truly godlike figures
as long as they are viewed within
the confines of their fictitious
worlds. Improvisational theater
owes its seductive appeal to this
simple craving for power, for
nothing turns on the theater goer
more than a chance to be, even if
just for a moment, All-Knowing
and All-Powerful.
The Pitschel Players, now
performing at The Intersection on
Friday and Saturday nights, do an
outstanding job of fostering this
feeling of power within the souls
of those who comprise their
evening congregations. I left with
the distinct impression that I
personally had been manipulating
the entire cast all night long; as if
I had spent a few hours in pulling
strings and making puppets dance.
The players stress the fact that
the skits they fabricate

extemporaneously are always
products of the suggestions that
the audience renders them.
Imagine the thrill one rabid
Oakland A's fan got when his
request for a satire on the World
Series was honored with a special
ABC Sports Broadcast featuring
bloodthirsty Mets and Mets fans,
variously engaged in hurling
grenades, firing cannons and
sniping at outfielders.
No doubt all A's fans in the
audience felt that the righteous
had received their due revenge
when Lindsey Nelson gave a
bullet-by-bullet description of a
play initiated by "Never-say-die"
Campenaris, who mercilessly
machine-gunned the entire Mets
team as they lounged in their
dugout, early in the 7th inning.
Campenaris played the entire
game "courageously," shaking off
the pain of a "hamstrung torso"
injury, incurred when he was
"slowed up" by a land mine while
attempting to steal third.
The Walter Cronkite interview
with a UFO space captain,
inspired by a freaky-looking
teenybopper about two seats to
my left, was a tremendous hit.
The good captain obligingly
informed Walter that his trips to
planet earth, undertaken roughly
once every flimrak (equivalent to
about seven earth football
seasons) were actually quite
relaxing little space jaunts. In fact,
they're nothing more than "milk
runs" — routine deliveries of
shiploads of mungos, a kind of
inter-galactic space banana.
Fantasies
Just before intermission, the
audience was questioned as to
what their favorite fantasies were.
A stately, white-haired gentleman

in the front row voiced his
lifelong aspiration of achieving
human flight. Before the night
was over he obtained his wish
when he flew, well, fell at any
rate, a full fifteen feet into the
receptive and collective arms of
the cast.
Some spectators were
somewhat more in touch "with
the real world." One of these
pragmatic individuals claimed to
be plagued by an uncontrollable
and savage desire to see President
Nixon resign. He too, got his wish
(from the cast).
If you admire spontaneous wit
you should certainly go see the
Pitschel Players. Their
rambunctiousness and
childishness, while unreal at times,
can be contagious and refreshing.
If you loath childish and
rambunctious people, but you are
interested in studying abnormal
psychology, you should definitely
go see the Pitschel Players. (Only
the Pitschel Players distribute free
kazoos to everybody during the
Grand Finale Number.)
I caution all, however, to go
expecting something less than
perfection. Even with the very
best of acting talent,
improvisational theater inevitably
lays a few eggs with nearly every
production. Yet while I won't
guarantee you that every act the
Players do will prove a winner, I
will guarantee that they will bat
well over .500.
The skits are embellished
admirably by what can best be
described as "impressionistic
piano music." The piano player,
whose notes are heavily flavored
with ragtime and honky-tonk
tunes, is alone well worth the
$1.50 admission price.
