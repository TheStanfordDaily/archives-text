# Musical Adaptation Unsatisfying
## 'Gone With The Wind' Loses In Translation 
### TERRI YAVITZ 
SAN FRANCISCO - In 1939,
Gone With The Wind created
much controversy by being the
first movie to use the word
"damn." Today, in the musical
version, "damn" had little impact.
In fact, very few aspects made

much of an impact.
Margaret Mitchell's classic
story has been recreated from the
original London production and
opened at the Curran Theatre last
Tuesday evening. Its cast includes
Pemell Roberts, as the notorious
Rhett Butler; Leslie Ann Warren

(you may recall her from the
"Mission Impossible" series or
T.V.'s own Cinderella), portraying
the selfish and determined
Scarlett O'Hara; Terence Monk, as
the dashing Ashley Wilkes; and
Udana Powers, taking the role of
Melanie, the only "real lady" in

the play.
Through these main characters,
the story of the Civil War and its
effect is shown from the South's
point of view.
The actors, individually,
developed appropriate
characterizations, which were
enhanced by their personal styles
and mannerisms. For instance,
Roberts completely enveloped the
audience with his stage
movements and non verbal
gestures, as he professionally
manipulated his way through the
scenes. He was quite convincing in
his role; however, bordered on an
almost too polished performance.
Warren's snippy facial
expressions and overbearing
coquetry fell neatly into role.
Powers, probably representing the
most believable of all characters,
molded herself into one of the
finest, most gracious ladies in the
South.
No Cohesion
Somehow, the interaction of
the characters failed to achieve
cohesion and believable
relationships. This, in turn,
created an inconsistency in the
end product. As the play
progressed, the action or dialogue
between the characters seemed to
jump in thought. The characters'
motivational foundations were
missing at times. Through further
examination, this choppy effect
could have been due to the editing
of the story itself.
Originally, while playing in Los
Angeles, "GWTW" was much
lengthier. The play was considered
too long for all practical purposes
(and audiences), and was cut
down to a two-and-a-half hour
show.
Sensational Sets
Even though the play wasn't
expressed as efficiently as it could
have been, it displayed some
exceptional effects. The sets were
sensational and were without a
doubt the high point in the
production. Live horses came on
stage, carting around a farm
wagon.
I couldn't help but overhear
some elderly women in the
audience react to the spectacle
gasping, "Ye Gads! I've never seen
anything like it. Too much for
me." Then, a locomotive appeared
on stage sending waves of smoke
through the air, followed by an
authentic representation of the
burning of Atlanta.

The sound was just as creative,
as we heard a taped voice calling
off lists of dead soldiers
throughout the war scenes. The
chanting of mourners and hymns
could also be heard on
background tape.
Impressive 'Freeze'
Another audio-visual
experience was created in a
"freeze" scene of the
Confederates in action. One by
one, they slowly dropped to the
ground, as the background sound
of gunshots pierced the air.
The musical selections were
pleasant enough, and for the most
part, complimented the action.
However, once in a while, the
tunes would be thrown in
randomly, not adding much to the
plot, and creating an
uncomfortable feeling in the
audience.
Several scenes were
outstanding. Among those was the
funeral of Rhett and Scarlett
Butler's child, Bonnie. - Mammy
led in the impressive spirituals
along with a dynamic chorus,
filling the theater with a moving,
emotional sound of mourning.
Singers Somewhat Lacking
This being a musical, I
expected to enjoy some terrific
talent, but I was disappointed in
part. Scarlett sang her heart out,
to no avail. Her voice lacked
power and resonance and it soon
became evident even to those who
knew nothing about the art.
Melanie made up for any lack
of female vocal ability. She
exhibited much richness and
softness in her songs, adding
meaning to the overall
superficiality of the production.
The leading men in the play
carried the musical selections off
successfully, mostly with charm
and showmanship.
Clearly, the talent potential of
the actors and the play itself was
in reach; however, the pieces
didn't quite fit together. A solid
content did not exist, which made
it difficult to express any
particular intent. Therefore, it was
virtually impossible for the
audience to elicit any response.
The point in any play is both to
entertain its audience and create a
certain impression or leave its
audience with a feeling of some
kind. Gone With The Wind
succeeded in carrying out the first
requirement, but failed to achieve
the second.

gasping, "Ye Gads! I've never seen
anything like it. Too much for
me." Then, a locomotive appeared
on stage sending waves of smoke
through the air, followed by an
authentic representation of the
burning of Atlanta.

The sound was just as creative,
as we heard a taped voice calling
off lists of dead soldiers
throughout the war scenes. The
chanting of mourners and hymns
could also be heard on
background tape.
Impressive 'Freeze'
Another audio-visual
experience was created in a
"freeze" scene of the
Confederates in action. One by
one, they slowly dropped to the
ground, as the background sound
of gunshots pierced the air.
The musical selections were
pleasant enough, and for the most
part, complimented the action.
However, once in a while, the
tunes would be thrown in
randomly, not adding much to the
plot, and creating an
uncomfortable feeling in the
audience.
Several scenes were
outstanding. Among those was the
funeral of Rhett and Scarlett
Butler's child, Bonnie. - Mammy
led in the impressive spirituals
along with a dynamic chorus,
filling the theater with a moving,
emotional sound of mourning.
Singers Somewhat Lacking
This being a musical, I
expected to enjoy some terrific
talent, but I was disappointed in
part. Scarlett sang her heart out,
to no avail. Her voice lacked
power and resonance and it soon
became evident even to those who
knew nothing about the art.
Melanie made up for any lack
of female vocal ability. She
exhibited much richness and
softness in her songs, adding
meaning to the overall
superficiality of the production.
The leading men in the play
carried the musical selections off
successfully, mostly with charm
and showmanship.
Clearly, the talent potential of
the actors and the play itself was
in reach; however, the pieces
didn't quite fit together. A solid
content did not exist, which made
it difficult to express any
particular intent. Therefore, it was
virtually impossible for the
audience to elicit any response.
The point in any play is both to
entertain its audience and create a
certain impression or leave its
audience with a feeling of some
kind. Gone With The Wind
succeeded in carrying out the first
requirement, but failed to achieve
the second.
SAN FRANCISCO - In 1939,
Gone With The Wind created
much controversy by being the
first movie to use the word
"damn." Today, in the musical
version, "damn" had little impact.
In fact, very few aspects made

much of an impact.
Margaret Mitchell's classic
story has been recreated from the
original London production and
opened at the Curran Theatre last
Tuesday evening. Its cast includes
Pemell Roberts, as the notorious
Rhett Butler; Leslie Ann Warren

(you may recall her from the
"Mission Impossible" series or
T.V.'s own Cinderella), portraying
the selfish and determined
Scarlett O'Hara; Terence Monk, as
the dashing Ashley Wilkes; and
Udana Powers, taking the role of
Melanie, the only "real lady" in

the play.
Through these main characters,
the story of the Civil War and its
effect is shown from the South's
point of view.
The actors, individually,
developed appropriate
characterizations, which were
enhanced by their personal styles
and mannerisms. For instance,
Roberts completely enveloped the
audience with his stage
movements and non verbal
gestures, as he professionally
manipulated his way through the
scenes. He was quite convincing in
his role; however, bordered on an
almost too polished performance.
Warren's snippy facial
expressions and overbearing
coquetry fell neatly into role.
Powers, probably representing the
most believable of all characters,
molded herself into one of the
finest, most gracious ladies in the
South.
No Cohesion
Somehow, the interaction of
the characters failed to achieve
cohesion and believable
relationships. This, in turn,
created an inconsistency in the
end product. As the play
progressed, the action or dialogue
between the characters seemed to
jump in thought. The characters'
motivational foundations were
missing at times. Through further
examination, this choppy effect
could have been due to the editing
of the story itself.
Originally, while playing in Los
Angeles, "GWTW" was much
lengthier. The play was considered
too long for all practical purposes
(and audiences), and was cut
down to a two-and-a-half hour
show.
Sensational Sets
Even though the play wasn't
expressed as efficiently as it could
have been, it displayed some
exceptional effects. The sets were
sensational and were without a
doubt the high point in the
production. Live horses came on
stage, carting around a farm
wagon.

opened at the Curran Theatre last
Tuesday evening. Its cast includes
Pemell Roberts, as the notorious
Rhett Butler; Leslie Ann Warren

(you may recall her from the
"Mission Impossible" series or
T.V.'s own Cinderella), portraying
the selfish and determined
Scarlett O'Hara; Terence Monk, as
the dashing Ashley Wilkes; and
Udana Powers, taking the role of
Melanie, the only "real lady" in

the play.
Through these main characters,
the story of the Civil War and its
effect is shown from the South's
point of view.
The actors, individually,
developed appropriate
characterizations, which were
enhanced by their personal styles
and mannerisms. For instance,
Roberts completely enveloped the
audience with his stage
movements and non verbal
gestures, as he professionally
manipulated his way through the
scenes. He was quite convincing in
his role; however, bordered on an
almost too polished performance.
Warren's snippy facial
expressions and overbearing
coquetry fell neatly into role.
Powers, probably representing the
most believable of all characters,
molded herself into one of the
finest, most gracious ladies in the
South.
No Cohesion
Somehow, the interaction of
the characters failed to achieve
cohesion and believable
relationships. This, in turn,
created an inconsistency in the
end product. As the play
progressed, the action or dialogue
between the characters seemed to
jump in thought. The characters'
motivational foundations were
missing at times. Through further
examination, this choppy effect
could have been due to the editing
of the story itself.
Originally, while playing in Los
Angeles, "GWTW" was much
lengthier. The play was considered
too long for all practical purposes
(and audiences), and was cut
down to a two-and-a-half hour
show.
Sensational Sets
Even though the play wasn't
expressed as efficiently as it could
have been, it displayed some
exceptional effects. The sets were
sensational and were without a
doubt the high point in the
production. Live horses came on
stage, carting around a farm
wagon.
I couldn't help but overhear
some elderly women in the
audience react to the spectacle
gasping, "Ye Gads! I've never seen
anything like it. Too much for
me." Then, a locomotive appeared
on stage sending waves of smoke
through the air, followed by an
authentic representation of the
burning of Atlanta.

The sound was just as creative,
as we heard a taped voice calling
off lists of dead soldiers
throughout the war scenes. The
chanting of mourners and hymns
could also be heard on
background tape.
Impressive 'Freeze'
Another audio-visual
experience was created in a
"freeze" scene of the
Confederates in action. One by
one, they slowly dropped to the
ground, as the background sound
of gunshots pierced the air.
The musical selections were
pleasant enough, and for the most
part, complimented the action.
However, once in a while, the
tunes would be thrown in
randomly, not adding much to the
plot, and creating an
uncomfortable feeling in the
audience.
Several scenes were
outstanding. Among those was the
funeral of Rhett and Scarlett
Butler's child, Bonnie. - Mammy
led in the impressive spirituals
along with a dynamic chorus,
filling the theater with a moving,
emotional sound of mourning.
Singers Somewhat Lacking
This being a musical, I
expected to enjoy some terrific
talent, but I was disappointed in
part. Scarlett sang her heart out,
to no avail. Her voice lacked
power and resonance and it soon
became evident even to those who
knew nothing about the art.
Melanie made up for any lack
of female vocal ability. She
exhibited much richness and
softness in her songs, adding
meaning to the overall
superficiality of the production.
The leading men in the play
carried the musical selections off
successfully, mostly with charm
and showmanship.
Clearly, the talent potential of
the actors and the play itself was
in reach; however, the pieces
didn't quite fit together. A solid
content did not exist, which made
it difficult to express any
particular intent. Therefore, it was
virtually impossible for the
audience to elicit any response.
The point in any play is both to
entertain its audience and create a
certain impression or leave its
audience with a feeling of some
kind. Gone With The Wind
succeeded in carrying out the first
requirement, but failed to achieve
the second.
