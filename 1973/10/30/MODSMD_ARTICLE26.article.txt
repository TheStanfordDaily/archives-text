# Sequel To The Emigrants'
## 'The New Land' Continues Film Epic 
### BRIAN BERGER 
The New Land is the second
half of Jan Troell's epic about
Swedish emigrants settling in the
American Midwest in the
nineteenth century. The first half
of the epic was of course The
Emigrants, and though they are
being distributed as two films,
they not only represent one sense
of rhythm and development but
one vision as well.
The New Land has more of the
same fine performances which
marked The Emigrants and is
directed, photographed and edited
by Troell with the same exquisite,
precise sensibility.
The first film introduced us to
Karl Oskar Nilsson (Max von
Sydow), his wife Kristina (Liv
Ullman), and his brother Robert
(Eddie Axberg) in a lovely,
compelling vision of people
uprooted, moving boldly into a
future they cannot foresee. In
that film, Troell wisely forsook
grand long shots of people en
masse for a close and careful focus
on one family. We perceive the
grand movement as they perceived
it, through their experience.

Through the Nilssons, Troell
expresses his own admiration for
the courageous spirit of all
settlers, propelled doggedly by
hope onward across a hostile
landscape. The Emigrants was
very much sustained by the
beauty of that hope, and however
corny that may sound, in the film
it has a grace and a truth about it
which are tough to deny.
The New Land is about the
finalization of the Nilsson's
dream. I do not say realization
because, as Liv Ullman
commented before the film's
American premiere last Monday at
the San Francisco Film Festival,
sadly, "they do not find what
they have come looking for."
Perhaps the genius of The New
Land is that, as Troell records in
painstaking beauty, the
hard-earned materialization of
their plans — a farm, a house, and
ultimately a community, he
subtly reveals the essential
disappointment of their
achievement. It is indeed a new
land, but the patterns of life are
persistently the same.
The Nilssons have left Sweden

but not the intolerance which
forced so many to leave. They
have brought new life to the
untamed land; with it have come
the suffering of sickness and
death. This is neither pessimism
not cynicism on Troell's part;
rather it is the recognition that
life's richness is derived as much
from suffering as it is from joy.
The sense of disappointment
which quietly pervades the film is
based on the further recognition
by Troell that no physical
movement, be it across oceans of
water or land, can ever fulfill its
mystical promise of transcendence
beyond space. Implicit in every
emigration is perhaps the hope
that the circumstances of life (as
opposed to living) will somehow,
wonderfully, be changed or
escaped.
In this sense, The New Land is
about the Nilsson's recognition
that they have transplanted more
than the Swedish apple tree which
Karl Oskar cultivates as a
reminder of home. The same
sadness, the same folly will repeat
itself again and again wherever
they are precisely because it has

less to do with locale than with
the human heart.
I don't expect America to
respond as warmly to The New
Land as it did to The Emigrants.
Though it's just as good a film, it
may be too close to home as a
study of this country's essential
failure within its apparent, that is
to say material, success.
Nonetheless, The New Land
confirms what The Emigrants
suggested, that Jan Troell is a
director of intelligence and
intuitive sensibility. His epic
stands not as an affirmation of an
easy philosophical position;
instead it is a stirring expression
of a vision which sees man's hope
and his inevitable disappointment
as part of the same richly complex
and compelling fabric of life.
