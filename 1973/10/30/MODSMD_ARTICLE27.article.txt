# 'Time Fades Away' Lacks Some Of Neil Young's Old Excitement
## 
### 
Time Fades Away is an album
of live tracks taped throughout
Neil Young's last American tour.
The LP's strongest point is the
editing of Young and producer
Elliott Mazer who have cleverly
avoided the inconsistencies of
Neil's singing. The songs
themselves reveal a predictability
which has worn dull the edge of
excitement inherent in previous
Young efforts.
The title track which opens the
album, centers around the sound
of the lyrics and their rhythm,
rather than the content.
"Journey Through The Past" is
another title song, but from his
movie. It catches him in one of his
more melancholy writing moods,
when the combination of plaintive
voice and funeral atmosphere
becomes a bit much.
"Yonder Stands The Sinner" is
a rhythmically typical Young song
with tom-tom thumping bass
beats laid down by TimDrummond
and drummer Johnny Barbata. It
emphasizes Young's whim for
melodrama: "yonder stands the
sinner who calls my name."
"City In The Smog," is the
repeated chorus in "L.A.," whose
overbearing seriousness makes it
novelettish and trite.
"Love On My Mind" features
Neil on piano and fulfills the role
of ballad. The song is short and
pretty. Possibly its length allows it
to escape candy-kisses
sentimentality.
Side two begins with the LP's
best track, "Don't Be Denied." It
is directly autobiographical, going
over childhood situations ("When
I was young, she said to me, your
daddy's leaving home. I think he's
gone to stay. We backed up all our

bags and drove to Winnipeg."); it
makes allusions to Buffalo
Springfield ("The businessmen
crowded around ... we played all
night, the price was right"). The
song transcends itself to become
an odyssey of his experiences,
with the philosophy contained in
the line "all the glitter is not
gold."
"The Bridge" features Neil on
harp over a piano intro, it is a love
song of great poignancy and wit
of lyrical content.
The final number, "Last
Dance" is the album's extended
electrical piece. Again Young is

haunted as a not particularly
inventive guitarist. The solo is
little more than a variation of the
riff he found in "Cowgirl In Hie
Sand."
Time Fades Away was
recorded live because Neil felt the
personal nature of the songs
required the intimacy which he
now feels will be created better in
clubs.
In the long run, despite the
excellence of "Don't Be Denied,"
I think this album will go down as
something he had to get out of his
system.

excellence of "Don't Be Denied,"
I think this album will go down as
something he had to get out of his
system.

Time Fades Away is an album
of live tracks taped throughout
Neil Young's last American tour.
The LP's strongest point is the
editing of Young and producer
Elliott Mazer who have cleverly
avoided the inconsistencies of
Neil's singing. The songs
themselves reveal a predictability
which has worn dull the edge of
excitement inherent in previous
Young efforts.
The title track which opens the
album, centers around the sound
of the lyrics and their rhythm,
rather than the content.
"Journey Through The Past" is
another title song, but from his
movie. It catches him in one of his
more melancholy writing moods,
when the combination of plaintive
voice and funeral atmosphere
becomes a bit much.
"Yonder Stands The Sinner" is
a rhythmically typical Young song
with tom-tom thumping bass
beats laid down by TimDrummond
and drummer Johnny Barbata. It
emphasizes Young's whim for
melodrama: "yonder stands the
sinner who calls my name."
"City In The Smog," is the
repeated chorus in "L.A.," whose
overbearing seriousness makes it
novelettish and trite.
"Love On My Mind" features
Neil on piano and fulfills the role
of ballad. The song is short and
pretty. Possibly its length allows it
to escape candy-kisses
sentimentality.
Side two begins with the LP's
best track, "Don't Be Denied." It
is directly autobiographical, going
over childhood situations ("When
I was young, she said to me, your
daddy's leaving home. I think he's
gone to stay. We backed up all our

bags and drove to Winnipeg."); it
makes allusions to Buffalo
Springfield ("The businessmen
crowded around ... we played all
night, the price was right"). The
song transcends itself to become
an odyssey of his experiences,
with the philosophy contained in
the line "all the glitter is not
gold."
"The Bridge" features Neil on
harp over a piano intro, it is a love
song of great poignancy and wit
of lyrical content.
The final number, "Last
Dance" is the album's extended
electrical piece. Again Young is

haunted as a not particularly
inventive guitarist. The solo is
little more than a variation of the
riff he found in "Cowgirl In Hie
Sand."
Time Fades Away was
recorded live because Neil felt the
personal nature of the songs
required the intimacy which he
now feels will be created better in
clubs.
In the long run, despite the
excellence of "Don't Be Denied,"
I think this album will go down as
something he had to get out of his
system.
