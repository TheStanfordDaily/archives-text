### DAN FORTE 
"There's a mellow place in the
neighborhood.
And everybody goes there if they
wanna feel good.
They got four thousand kinds of
sanctified beer.
And if you feel athletic they've
got ping pong in the rear. "
That's how a local pianist
named Charlie Hickox once
described a San Francisco beer-bar
known as Minnie's Can-Do Club.
Located on 1915 Fillmore
Street, on the outskirts of the
middle of San Francisco's black
ghetto (or is it the middle of the
outskirts), Minnie's is becoming
know as the "most funkiest" club
in the city.
Although the neon sign outside
reads "Can-Do," everyone knows
it by the name of its proprietor,
Minnie, the handsome-looking
black woman with the colorful
scarf around her hair, who takes
your two dollars at the door.
Excellent Pianist
The cover charge is in exchange
for the live music, provided by
pianist Dave Alexander, who is
largely responsible for the recent

recognition Minnie's has been
receiving in various publications.
Alexander's second LP for
Arhoolie Records, "The Dirt on
the Ground" (1071), is soon to be
released. His first solo LP, ur Qjie
Rattler" (1067), was named as
one of the Top Pick in Billboard.
Alexander sits in the far
corner, behind his piano, while
people jam the minute dance floor
directly in front of him.
The people come mostly from
the neighborhood; blacks ranging
most age groups, and many young
whites.
Typical Bar Decor
The walls of the club are
covered with paintings by black
Artists, various annoucements and
pamphlets, a sign advertising
"Fresh Pizza," a dartboard, and
plastic wall plaques advertising
nearly all of the 22 brands of beer
served at Minnie's.
The ping pong table has been
replaced by an electronic Pong
game, which sits against the right
wall, opposite the long bar.
If you come to Minnie's, it's
understood that you're there to

dance, so the formalities of asking
are forgotten; you merely point.
Dave Alexander can be heard
every Thursday thru Saturday,
singing and playing blues, boogie,
jazz, rock, and most anything you
can name. His repertoire covers
Nat King Cole's "Straighten Up
And Fly Right," Albert King's
"Bom Under A Bad Sign," Lloyd
Price's "Stagger Lee," and Mose
Allison's "Parchman Farm."
He is also quite an
accomplished composer himself.
One of his best compositions is
"The Day The Ravens Danced In
The Street," an intensely
emotional slow blues about the
death of his brother.
As Alexander says, "Minnie's is
my home club. No matter where I
tour, I'll always come back to
Minnie's, as long as she's open."
At age 35, Alexander has just
begun to receive the recognition
he deserves, and recently appeared
at the Monterey Jazz Festival.
Texas Roots
Like many Bay Area blues
musicians, Alexander was raised in
Texas. He has played with nearly

every Bay Area bluesman,
including Jimmy McCracklin,
Lowell Fulson, Jimmy
Witherspoon, Charley
Musselwhite, and L.C. Robinson.
Alexander is possibly one of
the best "blues Pianists" alive,
although he dislikes labels, and
does not limit himself to any
particular style.
The cover charge at Minnie's is
$2 on Friday and Saturday, and
only $1 on Thursday. Don't let
the location keep you away,
because as Charlie Hickox put it:
"They don't fuss, they don't
fight.
And everybody always feels all
right
At Minnie's Can-Do. "

Rattler" (1067), was named as
one of the Top Pick in Billboard.
Alexander sits in the far
corner, behind his piano, while
people jam the minute dance floor
directly in front of him.
The people come mostly from
the neighborhood; blacks ranging
most age groups, and many young
whites.
Typical Bar Decor
The walls of the club are
covered with paintings by black
Artists, various annoucements and
pamphlets, a sign advertising
"Fresh Pizza," a dartboard, and
plastic wall plaques advertising
nearly all of the 22 brands of beer
served at Minnie's.
The ping pong table has been
replaced by an electronic Pong
game, which sits against the right
wall, opposite the long bar.
If you come to Minnie's, it's
understood that you're there to

dance, so the formalities of asking
are forgotten; you merely point.
Dave Alexander can be heard
every Thursday thru Saturday,
singing and playing blues, boogie,
jazz, rock, and most anything you
can name. His repertoire covers
Nat King Cole's "Straighten Up
And Fly Right," Albert King's
"Bom Under A Bad Sign," Lloyd
Price's "Stagger Lee," and Mose
Allison's "Parchman Farm."
He is also quite an
accomplished composer himself.
One of his best compositions is
"The Day The Ravens Danced In
The Street," an intensely
emotional slow blues about the
death of his brother.
As Alexander says, "Minnie's is
my home club. No matter where I
tour, I'll always come back to
Minnie's, as long as she's open."
At age 35, Alexander has just
begun to receive the recognition
he deserves, and recently appeared
at the Monterey Jazz Festival.
Texas Roots
Like many Bay Area blues
musicians, Alexander was raised in
Texas. He has played with nearly

every Bay Area bluesman,
including Jimmy McCracklin,
Lowell Fulson, Jimmy
Witherspoon, Charley
Musselwhite, and L.C. Robinson.
Alexander is possibly one of
the best "blues Pianists" alive,
although he dislikes labels, and
does not limit himself to any
particular style.
The cover charge at Minnie's is
$2 on Friday and Saturday, and
only $1 on Thursday. Don't let
the location keep you away,
because as Charlie Hickox put it:
"They don't fuss, they don't
fight.
And everybody always feels all
right
At Minnie's Can-Do. "
"There's a mellow place in the
neighborhood.
And everybody goes there if they
wanna feel good.
They got four thousand kinds of
sanctified beer.
And if you feel athletic they've
got ping pong in the rear. "
That's how a local pianist
named Charlie Hickox once
described a San Francisco beer-bar
known as Minnie's Can-Do Club.
Located on 1915 Fillmore
Street, on the outskirts of the
middle of San Francisco's black
ghetto (or is it the middle of the
outskirts), Minnie's is becoming
know as the "most funkiest" club
in the city.
Although the neon sign outside
reads "Can-Do," everyone knows
it by the name of its proprietor,
Minnie, the handsome-looking
black woman with the colorful
scarf around her hair, who takes
your two dollars at the door.
Excellent Pianist
The cover charge is in exchange
for the live music, provided by
pianist Dave Alexander, who is
largely responsible for the recent

recognition Minnie's has been
receiving in various publications.
Alexander's second LP for
Arhoolie Records, "The Dirt on
the Ground" (1071), is soon to be
released. His first solo LP, ur Qjie
Rattler" (1067), was named as
one of the Top Pick in Billboard.
