Cox Asks For New Probe
WASHINGTON — Ousted Watergate prosecutor
Archibald Cox testified yesterday that a new special
prosecutor by law should be able to bring court action to
obtain evidence from the White House.
Cox told the Senate Judiciary Committee that
frustrations and delays he encountered in trying to get
evidence from the White House make it imperative a new
prosecutor have such legislated power.
He also repeated statements that he now has concluded
Congress should pass legislation providing for
appointment of a new prosecutor by the federal District
Court here.
President Nixon has announced that a successor to Cox
will be appointed later this week by acting Atty. Gen.
Robert H. Bork, but 53 senators have introduced a bill
providing for a new prosecutor appointed by U.S. District
Court Judge John J. Sirica.
Similar legislation has been suggested in the House by
more than 100 members.
Cox testified at a Judiciary Committee inquiry into his
dismissal by Bork, on Nixon's order, after he refused to
accept a directive not to pursue in court his efforts to
obtain tapes, notes and memoranda of presidential
conversations.
He said acceptance of the directive would have
established a "very dangerous precedent" and would have
been seen by many as a cover-up. He said it would have
led to later instructions interfering with his independence
and the conduct of investigation.
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., asked if a
prosecutor could fully perform his duties without access
to White House documents.
"I don't see how," Cox replied. "That's where the
information is."
Sen. John L. McClellan, D-Ark., asked Cox about
rumors that he had been fired because his investigative
trail was leading to the White House.
"I have no evidence to support any of the rumors of
this kind," Cox said. But he added he had seen evidence
that some of the President's staff are troubled by the
breadth of the guidelines for the prosecutor's office.
Israel Offers POW Swap
TEL AVIV — The 20,000 Egyptian troops trapped in
the sweltering Sinai Desert got their first emergency
supplies by truck convoy yesterday, and Israel offered to
exchange 7000 Arab prisoners of war for 450 Israeli POWs
reportedly held by Egypt and Syria.
There were reports that additional U.N. peacekeeping
forces had taken positions along the battle fronts, and the
areas in the war zones were said to be generally quiet.
There were these other developments yesterday:
— Israel's 75-year-old premier, Golda Meir, paid a
helicopter visit to Israeli troops along the canal, including
positions on the west bank taken by Israel in the latest
fighting.
— In Washington, Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger
met with Ismail Fahmy, a special representative of
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat. Kissinger and Fahmy
said afterward the meeting was "very promising."
— The Nixon administration urged Congress to shelve
temporarily the President's recommendation to liberalize
trade with the Soviet Union, emphasizing that
liberalization would again be pursued if a satisfactory
peace settlement is reached in the Middle East.
— Egypt's semiofficial newspaper A 1 Ahram reported
early this morning that Cairo officials informed U.N.
Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim they would deliver a list
of Israeli POWs to the International Red Cross.
Vitamins Spur Controversy
WASHINGTON — Widespread consumer fraud would
be promoted by legislation aimed at reversing new Food
and Drug Administration regulations on vitamins and
minerals, FDA Commissioner Alexander Schmidt said
yesterday.
"If the intent of these bills would become law, we
would, in effect, return to the 'patent medicine' abuses

which prevailed at the turn of the century," Schmidt told
the House public health subcommittee.
Rep. Craig Hosmer, R-Calif., chief sponsor of a major
measure under review by the subcommittee, said more
than 200 House colleagues have offered legislation
contesting FDA's orders on vitamins and mineral
supplements.
Those using products which have not been shown to be
harmful in whatever quantities taken, Hosmer said,
"should be freely allowed to continue doing so without
being threatened with the extra trouble and unnecessary
expense of having to get medical prescriptions.
"These people on whose behalf I plead aren't kooks or
nuts or food faddists or loonies. They are just plain
people .. . who find benefit from using these harmless
products."
However, Schmidt insisted the regulations, due to
become fully effective in 1975, will "require more
informative labeling so that the consumer will know if he
is buying an ordinary food, a dietary supplement, or a
drug; what such an item's real nutritive and therapeutic
value is, and the appropriate method of consuming" it.
"All but two pill forms will remain available to
consumers for purchase in grocery stores, pharmacies and
other retail stores throughout the country as
nonprescription products. The only two exceptions are
potentially toxic high levels of vitamins A and D," he said.
Low levels of these two vitamins will remain available as
nonprescription products, he added.
Volkswagen Drops Lawsuit
NEW YORK — Volkswagen of America, Inc., agreed
yesterday to drop a $30 million federal damage suit
against National Lampoon, after the magazine promised
to withdraw a false advertisement ridiculing Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
In an intended spoof, Lampoon in a special issue
copied a legitimate Volkswagen ad that showed one of its
cars afloat in water, attesting to the airtight construction
of its body.
But the magazine said in its text of the ad: "Poor
Teddy. If he'd been smart enough to buy a Volkswagen,
he never would have gotten into hot water."
The reference was to a 1969 accident in which
Kennedy's car plunged from a bridge and sank into a
creek on Chappaquiddick in Massachusetts. His passenger,
Mary Jo Kopechne, was drowned.
Volkswagen sued last week, accusing Lampoon of a
"tasteless publication of a tragic mishap." The auto firm
said irate VW customers had threatened to boycott the
company in the future, although it had nothing to do with
the ad.
Nerve Gas Bombs Destroyed
DENVER, Colo. — The Army began full-scale
destruction of leftover World War II nerve gas bombs
yesterday at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal northeast of
here, a spokesman said.
Secretary of the Army Howard Callaway approved the
destruction of 4.2 million pounds of GB nerve gas
contained in bomb clusters rather than moving the agents
to a less populated area.
Arthur Whitney, public information officer at the
arsenal, said the first of the 21,083 M 34 bombs was
detoxified starting at 7:45 a.m.
Simpson Outdoes Himself
BUFFALO — O.J. Simpson scored two touchdowns,
became the first player in National Football League
history to gain over 1000 yards in seven games and broke
a 39-year-old record for the most rushes in a single contest
as the Buffalo Bills upset the Kansas City Chiefs 23-14 last
night.
Today's Weather
Fair through Wednesday. Slightly warmer today. Lows
Tuesday night in the mid 40s to lower 50s. Highs today
and Wednesday in the mid 70s to mid 80s.
