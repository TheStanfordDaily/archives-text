# Grad School Rated Best In Nation
## 
### 
The professional schools of
business, education, engineering, and
medicine here are all rated among the
top three nationally by deans in their
respective fields, an independent
survey shows.
The findings were published
yesterday in Change magazine by
Rebecca Zames Margulies and Peter M.
Blau of Columbia University.
"Stanford has the best school of
education, followed by Columbia's
Teacher's College, with Chicago and
Harvard tied for third place," they
reported. Among 57 responding deans,
39 listed Stanford among the top five
nationally.
"For some time we've had a good
reputation because we conduct more
consequential education research,"
commented University Dean of
Education Arthur P. Coladarci. The
school was ranked first nationally
three years ago.
Coladarci believes that the school's
"very strong alumni" are a factor in
the high rating, and pointed to the
school of education's new directions
and work in "organizational theory"
and "psychological studies" as
important.
The survey rated the School of
Engineering second behind the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Engineering Dean William M. Kays felt
that "alumni success was not very
important" in rating graduate schools,
and explained that it is the "kind of
students who go to the school that is
important. We've been getting the top
students."
"The two best schools of
business ... are those at Harvard and
Stanford, with the University of
Chicago business school a distant
third," the survey reported. Among 52
respondents, 54 mentioned Harvard
and 50 cited Stanford as being among
the top five nationally.
In medicine, all eight deans
responding listed Harvard among the
top five, followed by John Hopkins
with seven mentions, and Stanford,
Duke, and Yale with five mentions
each.
"When asked to estimate the
quality of entering students now
compared to those 10 years ago, more
than three-fourths of the deans held
that today's students are superior in
intellectual capacity and academic
preparation, and more than one-half
also considered them superior in
creative ability," Margulies and Blau
reported.
