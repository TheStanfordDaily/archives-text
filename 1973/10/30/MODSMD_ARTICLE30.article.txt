# ASSU Senate Tables African Relief Proposal
## 
### 
After heated debate last night, the
Student Senate tabled discussion of a
proposal to give $SGO to a relief fund
aiding drought-ridden parts of central
and southern Africa.
Dave McCullum, head chef of the
Faculty Club and Coordinator of the
Stanford Branch of the African
Famine Relief Fund, asked for the
money to defray costs of a catering
service serving dinners to Stanford
students to raise money for the cause.
McCullum said he was asking for a
loan, but several senators said they did
not understand whether the proposal
meant a loan for a student service or a
donation.
After Vice President Jim Friend
said the Senate couldn't donate funds
to every world crisis, economics
student Rischa Williams charged the
senate with racism and said, "If this
was for the Jews or Arabs, you'd be up
in arms."
McCullum withdrew his request,
saying, "Just tell your friends about

it," but a later proposal by President
Kevin O'Grady to send the matter to
committee to study passed easily.
Jamie Newton, psychology grad
student and member of the initiating
committee of Action Research Liaison
Office (ARLO), an experimental
program to coordinate student
research with companies, faculty, and
groups of people needing research for
social action, explained his desire for
the senate's financial report.
Poor people, ecological and other
social concerned groups don't have the
money for research that large
corporations do, Newton said.
Students, however, are already doing
research which is simply thrown away.
In other actions, the Senate agreed
to send representatives to meet with
Sterling Silver to discuss the
Commissary's use of non-union grapes.
The Senate agreed to meet next
Monday to act on proposals
concerning tuition hikes, which the
November 13 trustee meeting will
discuss.
