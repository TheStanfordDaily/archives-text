# Campaign To Remove Nixon Continues
## 
### DOYLE McMANUS News Analysis 
Some time last week, Congressional
leaders began looking seriously
through a 718-page research document
published on Oct. 9 by the House
Judiciary Committee. The report's
title: Impeachment.
Nearby in Washington, the White
House, apparently taken by surprise
when the dismissal of Archibald Cox
touched off a nationwide furor,
mounted a hurried attempt to
conciliate public and capitol opinion.
But if the Congress had cringed
from impeachment before, it wasn't
cringing now. On Tuesday alone, eight
congressmen introduced resolutions of
impeachment. The 21 Democrats on
the House Judiciary Committee agreed
unanimously to undertake a
"broad-scale" investigation, and while
Republican colleagues questioned the
envisioned scope of such a probe they
were nearly solid in their support of
the basic idea.
The bipartisanship of the demand
for an inquiry was startling. Even
Gerald Ford, Nixon's own vice
presidential nominee, announced his
support for the plan.
Deeper Nerve
The firing of Cox, and the White
House's initial announcement that the
President would ignore the appellate
court order to surrender the Watergate
tapes, touched a deeper nerve than

anyone in the White House expected.
Even the President's agreement
Tuesday to comply with the court
order failed to halt the impeachment
drive.
"It is as if a dam had broken," said
Rep. Clarence D. Long, D-Md.
The dam analogy seems particularly
appropriate; the Cox episode seems to
have unleashed a flood of frustrations
accumulated over the last five years.
When impeachment is mentioned, it is
not simply in conjunction with the
tapes, but a whole host of complaints:
— the secret, and possibly illegal,
bombing of Cambodia;
— Nixon's approval of a plan to
burglarize and wiretap domestic
dissidents;
— the hikes in milk price supports
and reinstitution of dairy product
import quotas that quickly followed
several dairy industry contributions to
Nixon's re-election campaign;
— the settlement, out of court, of
antitrust cases against ITT;
— the impoundment of
congressionally-appropriated funds;
— the mysterious financing of
Nixon's personal estates in San
Clemente and Key Biscayne;
— even the sale of grain to the
Soviet Union and all the unanswered
questions surrounding it.
New Low
The President is in deep trouble.
His popularity has hit a new low; every

day seems to bring new allegations of
misconduct. Even Presidential crony
C.G. "Bebe" Rebozo has been
touched; reports are circulating that he
sold $93,000 in stolen IBM stock.
Archibald Cox is testifying before
the Senate Judiciary Committee, and
if he has made no sweeping
accusations, he has indicated that his
investigation — if, when, and however
it is completed — will have plenty to
say.
In the face of all this, the President
is apparently preparing to "tough it
out."
"The tougher it gets," he said in his
press conference Friday, "the cooler I
get."
The promise did not inspire
confidence. For one thing, the
President's performance at the press
conference was far from cool. He
lashed out at his critics, at the press,
and at the networks, calling their
reports of possible irregularities in his
financial affairs "outrageous,
distorted ... frantic and hysterical."
But he was not angry with the
networks, Nixon said: "One can only
be angry with those whom he
respects." It was an understandable
reaction from a man under direct
attack. But it was anything but cool.
Congress Tough, Too
For another, Congress appears
ready to tough it out with Nixon. The
Senate bill to establish a

court-appointed independent
prosecutor has 53 cosponsors already.
Nixon's promise to appoint a new
special prosecutor was greeted with
little enthusiasm. Said Senate Majority
Leader Mike Mansfield, D-Mont.: "No
soap."
President Nixon, however, has some
cards left in his hand. He has
successfully restrained the
investigation of Archibald Cox, at least
for now. By giving Judge John Sirica
the tapes, he has both sidestepped the
possibility of a contempt citation and
avoided taking the case to the
Supreme Court, which would have
risked the establishment of a general
precedent.
As it stands now, Nixon has given
up no essential tape or document.
There will almost surely be attempts
to subpoena documents relating to the
milk price mystery, among other
subjects; but they must undergo the
same tortuous process of hearings and
appeals as the original nine tapes.
And as to those tapes, the suspicion
grows that there is little of major
importance on them. The tapes remain
in Judge Sirica's hands, until he
decides to hand the relevant portions
over to Cox's old grand jury.
By the time Sirica decides, the jury
may have lost Cox's staff as well as
Cox. Although the investigators have
been assured by Acting Atty. Gen.
Robert Bork that the investigation will
continue, they are (in the words of
one staff member) "intellectually and
emotionally prepared for betrayal."
The feeling, said press secretary
James S. Doyle, is "to test as soon as
possible the new system and see if it is
one of integrity." If it is not, there
may well be another wave of
resignations, perhaps even including
Bork, who is insistent on his own
independence.
In any case, the President has made
no moves toward granting his as-yet
unnamed prosecutor more
independence that than the last one
had. It seems clear that Congress will
establish a prosecutor for the courts,
while carrying on at least three
investigations of its own.
Investigations of the
Administration — perhaps by the
Justice Department, more likely
from outside — will continue. If the
allegations and revelations of the last
week are matched by those of the
next, it is unlikely that the public and
Congressional ardor for impeachment
will cool very fast.
The mood was best expressed,
ironically, by Nixon himself. "It's
time," he said Friday, "for those who
are guilty to be prosecuted and for
those who are innocent to be cleared."

When impeachment is mentioned, it is
not simply in conjunction with the
tapes, but a whole host of complaints:
— the secret, and possibly illegal,
bombing of Cambodia;
— Nixon's approval of a plan to
burglarize and wiretap domestic
dissidents;
— the hikes in milk price supports
and reinstitution of dairy product
import quotas that quickly followed
several dairy industry contributions to
Nixon's re-election campaign;
— the settlement, out of court, of
antitrust cases against ITT;
— the impoundment of
congressionally-appropriated funds;
— the mysterious financing of
Nixon's personal estates in San
Clemente and Key Biscayne;
— even the sale of grain to the
Soviet Union and all the unanswered
questions surrounding it.
New Low
The President is in deep trouble.
His popularity has hit a new low; every

day seems to bring new allegations of
misconduct. Even Presidential crony
C.G. "Bebe" Rebozo has been
touched; reports are circulating that he
sold $93,000 in stolen IBM stock.
Archibald Cox is testifying before
the Senate Judiciary Committee, and
if he has made no sweeping
accusations, he has indicated that his
investigation — if, when, and however
it is completed — will have plenty to
say.
In the face of all this, the President
is apparently preparing to "tough it
out."
"The tougher it gets," he said in his
press conference Friday, "the cooler I
get."
The promise did not inspire
confidence. For one thing, the
President's performance at the press
conference was far from cool. He
lashed out at his critics, at the press,
and at the networks, calling their
reports of possible irregularities in his
financial affairs "outrageous,
distorted ... frantic and hysterical."
But he was not angry with the
networks, Nixon said: "One can only
be angry with those whom he
respects." It was an understandable
reaction from a man under direct
attack. But it was anything but cool.
Congress Tough, Too
For another, Congress appears
ready to tough it out with Nixon. The
Senate bill to establish a

court-appointed independent
prosecutor has 53 cosponsors already.
Nixon's promise to appoint a new
special prosecutor was greeted with
little enthusiasm. Said Senate Majority
Leader Mike Mansfield, D-Mont.: "No
soap."
President Nixon, however, has some
cards left in his hand. He has
successfully restrained the
investigation of Archibald Cox, at least
for now. By giving Judge John Sirica
the tapes, he has both sidestepped the
possibility of a contempt citation and
avoided taking the case to the
Supreme Court, which would have
risked the establishment of a general
precedent.
As it stands now, Nixon has given
up no essential tape or document.
There will almost surely be attempts
to subpoena documents relating to the
milk price mystery, among other
subjects; but they must undergo the
same tortuous process of hearings and
appeals as the original nine tapes.
And as to those tapes, the suspicion
grows that there is little of major
importance on them. The tapes remain
in Judge Sirica's hands, until he
decides to hand the relevant portions
over to Cox's old grand jury.
By the time Sirica decides, the jury
may have lost Cox's staff as well as
Cox. Although the investigators have
been assured by Acting Atty. Gen.
Robert Bork that the investigation will
continue, they are (in the words of
one staff member) "intellectually and
emotionally prepared for betrayal."
The feeling, said press secretary
James S. Doyle, is "to test as soon as
possible the new system and see if it is
one of integrity." If it is not, there
may well be another wave of
resignations, perhaps even including
Bork, who is insistent on his own
independence.
In any case, the President has made
no moves toward granting his as-yet
unnamed prosecutor more
independence that than the last one
had. It seems clear that Congress will
establish a prosecutor for the courts,
while carrying on at least three
investigations of its own.
Investigations of the
Administration — perhaps by the
Justice Department, more likely
from outside — will continue. If the
allegations and revelations of the last
week are matched by those of the
next, it is unlikely that the public and
Congressional ardor for impeachment
will cool very fast.
The mood was best expressed,
ironically, by Nixon himself. "It's
time," he said Friday, "for those who
are guilty to be prosecuted and for
those who are innocent to be cleared."
Some time last week, Congressional
leaders began looking seriously
through a 718-page research document
published on Oct. 9 by the House
Judiciary Committee. The report's
title: Impeachment.
Nearby in Washington, the White
House, apparently taken by surprise
when the dismissal of Archibald Cox
touched off a nationwide furor,
mounted a hurried attempt to
conciliate public and capitol opinion.
But if the Congress had cringed
from impeachment before, it wasn't
cringing now. On Tuesday alone, eight
congressmen introduced resolutions of
impeachment. The 21 Democrats on
the House Judiciary Committee agreed
unanimously to undertake a
"broad-scale" investigation, and while
Republican colleagues questioned the
envisioned scope of such a probe they
were nearly solid in their support of
the basic idea.
The bipartisanship of the demand
for an inquiry was startling. Even
Gerald Ford, Nixon's own vice
presidential nominee, announced his
support for the plan.
Deeper Nerve
The firing of Cox, and the White
House's initial announcement that the
President would ignore the appellate
court order to surrender the Watergate
tapes, touched a deeper nerve than

anyone in the White House expected.
Even the President's agreement
Tuesday to comply with the court
order failed to halt the impeachment
drive.
"It is as if a dam had broken," said
Rep. Clarence D. Long, D-Md.
The dam analogy seems particularly
appropriate; the Cox episode seems to
have unleashed a flood of frustrations
accumulated over the last five years.
When impeachment is mentioned, it is

President's performance at the press
conference was far from cool. He
lashed out at his critics, at the press,
and at the networks, calling their
reports of possible irregularities in his
financial affairs "outrageous,
distorted ... frantic and hysterical."
But he was not angry with the
networks, Nixon said: "One can only
be angry with those whom he
respects." It was an understandable
reaction from a man under direct
attack. But it was anything but cool.
Congress Tough, Too
For another, Congress appears
ready to tough it out with Nixon. The
Senate bill to establish a

court-appointed independent
prosecutor has 53 cosponsors already.
Nixon's promise to appoint a new
special prosecutor was greeted with
little enthusiasm. Said Senate Majority
Leader Mike Mansfield, D-Mont.: "No
soap."
President Nixon, however, has some
cards left in his hand. He has
successfully restrained the
investigation of Archibald Cox, at least
for now. By giving Judge John Sirica
the tapes, he has both sidestepped the
possibility of a contempt citation and
avoided taking the case to the
Supreme Court, which would have
risked the establishment of a general
precedent.
As it stands now, Nixon has given
up no essential tape or document.
There will almost surely be attempts
to subpoena documents relating to the
milk price mystery, among other
subjects; but they must undergo the
same tortuous process of hearings and
appeals as the original nine tapes.
And as to those tapes, the suspicion
grows that there is little of major
importance on them. The tapes remain
in Judge Sirica's hands, until he
decides to hand the relevant portions
over to Cox's old grand jury.
By the time Sirica decides, the jury
may have lost Cox's staff as well as
Cox. Although the investigators have
been assured by Acting Atty. Gen.
Robert Bork that the investigation will
continue, they are (in the words of
one staff member) "intellectually and
emotionally prepared for betrayal."
The feeling, said press secretary
James S. Doyle, is "to test as soon as
possible the new system and see if it is
one of integrity." If it is not, there
may well be another wave of
resignations, perhaps even including
Bork, who is insistent on his own
independence.
In any case, the President has made
no moves toward granting his as-yet
unnamed prosecutor more
independence that than the last one
had. It seems clear that Congress will
establish a prosecutor for the courts,
while carrying on at least three
investigations of its own.
Investigations of the
Administration — perhaps by the
Justice Department, more likely
from outside — will continue. If the
allegations and revelations of the last
week are matched by those of the
next, it is unlikely that the public and
Congressional ardor for impeachment
will cool very fast.
The mood was best expressed,
ironically, by Nixon himself. "It's
time," he said Friday, "for those who
are guilty to be prosecuted and for
those who are innocent to be cleared."
Some time last week, Congressional
leaders began looking seriously
through a 718-page research document
published on Oct. 9 by the House
Judiciary Committee. The report's
title: Impeachment.
Nearby in Washington, the White
House, apparently taken by surprise
when the dismissal of Archibald Cox
touched off a nationwide furor,
mounted a hurried attempt to
conciliate public and capitol opinion.
But if the Congress had cringed
from impeachment before, it wasn't
cringing now. On Tuesday alone, eight
congressmen introduced resolutions of
impeachment. The 21 Democrats on
the House Judiciary Committee agreed
unanimously to undertake a
"broad-scale" investigation, and while
Republican colleagues questioned the
envisioned scope of such a probe they
were nearly solid in their support of
the basic idea.
The bipartisanship of the demand
for an inquiry was startling. Even
Gerald Ford, Nixon's own vice
presidential nominee, announced his
support for the plan.
Deeper Nerve
The firing of Cox, and the White
House's initial announcement that the
President would ignore the appellate
court order to surrender the Watergate
tapes, touched a deeper nerve than

anyone in the White House expected.
Even the President's agreement
Tuesday to comply with the court
order failed to halt the impeachment
drive.
"It is as if a dam had broken," said
Rep. Clarence D. Long, D-Md.
The dam analogy seems particularly
appropriate; the Cox episode seems to
have unleashed a flood of frustrations
accumulated over the last five years.
When impeachment is mentioned, it is
not simply in conjunction with the
tapes, but a whole host of complaints:
— the secret, and possibly illegal,
bombing of Cambodia;
— Nixon's approval of a plan to
burglarize and wiretap domestic
dissidents;
— the hikes in milk price supports
and reinstitution of dairy product
import quotas that quickly followed
several dairy industry contributions to
Nixon's re-election campaign;
— the settlement, out of court, of
antitrust cases against ITT;
— the impoundment of
congressionally-appropriated funds;
— the mysterious financing of
Nixon's personal estates in San
Clemente and Key Biscayne;
— even the sale of grain to the
Soviet Union and all the unanswered
questions surrounding it.
New Low
The President is in deep trouble.
His popularity has hit a new low; every

day seems to bring new allegations of
misconduct. Even Presidential crony
C.G. "Bebe" Rebozo has been
touched; reports are circulating that he
sold $93,000 in stolen IBM stock.
Archibald Cox is testifying before
the Senate Judiciary Committee, and
if he has made no sweeping
accusations, he has indicated that his
investigation — if, when, and however
it is completed — will have plenty to
say.
In the face of all this, the President
is apparently preparing to "tough it
out."
"The tougher it gets," he said in his
press conference Friday, "the cooler I
get."
The promise did not inspire
confidence. For one thing, the
