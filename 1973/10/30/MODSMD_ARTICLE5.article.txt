# Impeachment Calls Disrupt Council Meeting
## 
### BILL ROSS 
A group of Palo Alto residents
disrupted a meeting of the City
Council last night and demanded that
the Council discuss the possibility of
passing a resolution calling for the
impeachment of President Nixon.
Mayor Kirke Comstock refused to

place such a discussion on the
evening's agenda of business, but
promised that the matter would be
considered at a council meeting in the
near future.
In other proceedings last night, the
council approved a resolution
recommending state legislation to lift
the current prohibition on the sale of

alcohol within a mile and a half of
Stanford.
During discussion of an ordinance
regarding tree preservation, members
of the audience began to rise to ask
the council to consider impeachment
resolutions. Although some of the
speakers claimed that impeachment
was related to the tree ordinance,

Comstock insisted they were out of
order.
When Comstock was reminded that
he had urged citizens to "besiege local
governments" with calls for
impeachment, the mayor contended
that the meeting was neither the time
nor the place to debate the matter.
Pamela Cruz, a Palo Alto resident,
appeared uninvited at the speaker's
microphone and voiced her demand
that the council consider a proposed
and unsigned impeachment resolution
which circulated at the meeting.
When the mayor refused to
consider her request, she denounced
his action. Claiming that his avowed
support of impeachment encouraged
her to attend the meeting, Cruz
shouted, "You'd better get your little
liberal trip together, Mr. Mayor."
Comstock replied, "You're out of
order."
When she continued, Comstock
called a recess. After a 10-minute
interlude in which several people rose
to advocate discussion of the
resolution, Comstock said that the
subject of an impeachment resolution
will be placed either on the Nov. 5 or
the Nov. 12 City Council agenda.
"That means the resolution won't
get off to Washington for at least a
month," one person in the audience
interrupted. "In the meantime Nixon
could destroy us."
The Council then considered the
alcohol issue. A California statute,
designed to expire on January 1,1979,
forbids the sale of alcohol within a one
and a half mile of a college. The
legislature has already voted to
exclude UCLA from the restriction,
and it has made certain exceptions
pertaining to Stanford.
"There is little need or justification
for said restrictions to continue for an
additional period of more than five
years," the resolution stated.
Calling for a change of the law at
the "earliest possible time," the
resolution was passed in a 7-2 vote.

support of impeachment encouraged
her to attend the meeting, Cruz
shouted, "You'd better get your little
liberal trip together, Mr. Mayor."
Comstock replied, "You're out of
order."
When she continued, Comstock
called a recess. After a 10-minute
interlude in which several people rose
to advocate discussion of the
resolution, Comstock said that the
subject of an impeachment resolution
will be placed either on the Nov. 5 or
the Nov. 12 City Council agenda.
"That means the resolution won't
get off to Washington for at least a
month," one person in the audience
interrupted. "In the meantime Nixon
could destroy us."
The Council then considered the
alcohol issue. A California statute,
designed to expire on January 1,1979,
forbids the sale of alcohol within a one
and a half mile of a college. The
legislature has already voted to
exclude UCLA from the restriction,
and it has made certain exceptions
pertaining to Stanford.
"There is little need or justification
for said restrictions to continue for an
additional period of more than five
years," the resolution stated.
Calling for a change of the law at
the "earliest possible time," the
resolution was passed in a 7-2 vote.
A group of Palo Alto residents
disrupted a meeting of the City
Council last night and demanded that
the Council discuss the possibility of
passing a resolution calling for the
impeachment of President Nixon.
Mayor Kirke Comstock refused to

place such a discussion on the
evening's agenda of business, but
promised that the matter would be
considered at a council meeting in the
near future.
In other proceedings last night, the
council approved a resolution
recommending state legislation to lift
the current prohibition on the sale of

alcohol within a mile and a half of
Stanford.
During discussion of an ordinance
regarding tree preservation, members
of the audience began to rise to ask
the council to consider impeachment
resolutions. Although some of the
speakers claimed that impeachment
was related to the tree ordinance,

Comstock insisted they were out of
order.
When Comstock was reminded that
he had urged citizens to "besiege local
governments" with calls for
impeachment, the mayor contended
that the meeting was neither the time
nor the place to debate the matter.
Pamela Cruz, a Palo Alto resident,
appeared uninvited at the speaker's
microphone and voiced her demand
that the council consider a proposed
and unsigned impeachment resolution
which circulated at the meeting.
When the mayor refused to
consider her request, she denounced
his action. Claiming that his avowed
support of impeachment encouraged
her to attend the meeting, Cruz
shouted, "You'd better get your little
liberal trip together, Mr. Mayor."
Comstock replied, "You're out of
order."
When she continued, Comstock
called a recess. After a 10-minute
