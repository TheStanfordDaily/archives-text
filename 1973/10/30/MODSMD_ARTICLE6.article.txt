# Israel Weight Consequences
## Victory: Worth The Price?

(This is the conclusion of a
two-part series continued from
yesterday.)
The Israeli government reserves
its most repressive measures for
the Arabs trapped within its
expanding borders. Justifying its
actions by pointing out the very
real problem of terrorism, the
Israeli government nevertheless
stoops to the level of its
opponents. Israeli agents
assassinate suspected Fedayeen
leaders, with only occasional
errors. After the Lod Airport
massacre, the Israeli government
retaliated with a massive aerial
bombardment of the Lebanese
town of Hassibia, killing
forty-eight civilians.
One Israeli journalist
commented shortly after news of
the attack was leaked, "What
moral difference is there between
shooting innocent civilians in the
Lod airport and the bombardment
of innocent civilians in Lebanon?
The fact that here the crime was
committed by three Japanese,
wearing civilian uniforms, and
there the bombardment was
carried out by military airplanes,
still does not drastically change
the moral weight of slaughtering
innocent civilians." Last
February, Israel forced the crash
landing of a Libyan jetliner,
causing the death of several
passengers. A worldwide outcry
ensued, but the Israeli government
refused to pledge never again to
commit such an act.
Arabs Punished
In a more routine way, the
Israeli government punishes those
Arabs who come under its control
by refusing many of them the
right to return to their vacant
land. Haaretz, one of Israel's
leading dailies, editorialized on
July 25, 1972 about one incident
which became a cause celebre:
"The government decided the day
before yesterday by a majority
vote against allowing the return of
the uprooted inhabitants of the
villages of Ikrit and Baram to their
original villages. The decision was
made, ignoring the promises given
to the inhabitants of the two
villages during the War of
Independence, when they were
temporarily moved from their
villages; disobeying the Supreme
Court decision; and for security
considerations, which, despite the
opinion of the head of the general
staff, are no longer persuasive.
The real explanation for the
decision of the majority of the
ministers is connected with the
unwillingness to cancel a decision
that was once taken and with the
fear that the return of the Arabs
to Ikrit and Baram might
encourage similar demands in
regard to other deserted villages in
the Galilee and other regions of
the country as well."
The Israeli government keeps
the Palestinians under control,
and justifies its actions towards
them, with the Emergency
Defense Regulations, promulgated
originally by the British and used
to arrest such figures as Moshe
Dayan and Golda Meir; naturally,
Jews fighting the British fround
the Regulations vicious and
unworthy of a civilized state.
Israel Uses Regulations
Israel began concerted
application of these Regulations
after 1967. They give the
government, or military
commanders, the right to
imprison indefinitely, without
trail, "any person" whose
confinement is deemed "necessary
or expedient ... for securing the
public safety, the defense of
Israel],the maintenance of public
order, or the suppression of
mutiny, rebellion, or riot." The
Israeli government has invoked
these rules to break strikes,
enforce the ejection of Arabs
from their land, and to detain
political adversaries and suspected
terrorists who cannot be brought
to trial.
Harvard law professor Alan
Dershowitz, writing in
Commentary magazine, cited an
official figure of 23 Israeli Arabs,
and 1,000 Palestinians from the
occupied territories, who are
presently being held in
confinement under these
regulations. Ironically, Israel's
present Minister of Justice,

Shapira, had proclaimed back in
1946: "The regime built in
Palestine on the Defense
Regulations has no parallel in any
civilized nation. Even in Nazi
Germany there were no such
| laws." While a gross exaggeration,
Shapira's statement reflects the
distance Israeli society has
travelled since the first days of
independence.
Do any alternatives exist for a
state surrounded by hostile
enemies? Many Israelis now
believe so. They realize that the
1967 war was not fought for
national survival, but that Israel
attacked to permanently secure its
borders and to gain new territory
— a judgement seemingly shared
by General Peled, Yitzhak Rabin
(then Army Chief of Staff), and
former Prime Minister Levi
Eshkol.
Israelis were angry when their
government in early 1970 quashed
an invitation by Nasser to the
head of the World Jewish
Conference to conduct informal,
exploratory talks on the
possibility of normalizing
relations between Israel and
Egypt. They were confused when,
in February 1971, Sadat
announced his readiness to sign a
peace treaty with Israel, and Israel
refused to answer a plea from UN
mediator Gunnar Jarring.
Fate of Territories
Many Israelis suspected that
their government never intended
to give back the occupied
territories in return for peace,
when Moshe Dayan proclaimed,
only a year after the Six Day War,
"During the last 100 years, our
people have been in the process of
building up the nation, of
expansion, of getting additional
Jews and settlements in order to
expand the borders. Let no Jew
say that the process has ended.
Let no Jew say we are near the
end of the road." Israel has indeed

shown every intention of retaining
and recolonizing the rich
agricultural and oil-producing
lands it won in 1967.
Yet as Moshe Dayan himself
predicted last year, Egypt would
inevitably be forced into war to
regain these territories, even
against its better judgement, if it
could not win them back at the
conference table. Writes Mr.
Arieli, "Israel always defended her
position in a way that would
make it more difficult, not easier,
for the other side to continue the
effort to find a political solution.
Taking full advantage of the fact
that the Arab countries have been
prisoners of their own rhetoric of
hate against Israel and that their
politics are far more irresponsible
toward their own societies than
toward Israel, Israel's leaders
found it easy to rely on the
vicious circles which the Arab
states created in relation to the
Israeli-Arab conflict.
Alternatives
"From the beginning, this policy
has been formulated so that it
would be applied to alternative
possibilities: either that the other
side would accept Israel's
conditions — that is to say, start
negotiations without prior
commitments regarding the
permanent borders of Israel, or
that the deadlock would permit
continuation of the present
territorial situation."
Many Israelis, understandably,
still fear for their nation's security
in the Arab-dominated Mideast.
They have taken great risks in war
to protect the future of Israel. But
they should likewise be ready to
take great risks for peace.
Continued militarism and rising
social tensions may yet rip apart
the fabric of Israeli society faster
than the most militant of Arab
armies.
