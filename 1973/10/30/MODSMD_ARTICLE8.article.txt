# Proposition One
## Tax Bill Limits State Taxes 
### 
â€¢ William White

The main aim of Proposition
One is much different
philosophically than traditional
tax reduction. It is limiting the
size of government through
constitutional revenue limitation.
The history of attempts at tax
reduction shows that past
measures to reduce taxes have
failed because they have not
attacked the real problems which
caused previous tax increases: the
growing scope of government and
increasing expenditures.
Proposition One is a direct attack
on the rapidly expanding size of
government. Perhaps it is this
reason, more than any other,
which seems to frighten
opponents of the measure and
causes them to resort to the kinds
of distorted analysis found in an
article by James Lobsenz (Daily,
Oct. 17, 1973).
Lobsenz states "Some special
taxes ... would also be
eliminated." Yet nowhere in the
proposition is there anything that
could be construed as producing
such a change in the current tax
laws. The intent and meaning of
this proposition is to place an
overall limit on state revenue.
Within that limit, it is solely a
matter for the legislature to
determine the kinds and rates of
taxes. The only mention of these
"special taxes" in the proposition
is found in section 2, which states
that these taxes should not be
used in calculating any refund.
Next comes the claim that
"savings for the overwhelming
majority of Californians would be
minimal" which looks only at the
present tax structure without
taking into account the protection
from future tax increases granted
by the proposition.
"Those who would really
profit would be the rich" appears
to be an emotional attempt to
persuade the reader that the
purpose of the proposition is soak
the poor and give to the rich. The
real effect of the proposed tax

reduction would be to reduce
taxes by a fixed percentage for
everyone who pays them. People
who earn more would naturally be
allowed to keep more. After all, if
you earn it, why shouldn't you be
allowed to keep it. That isn't
favoritism; it's justice.
Lobsenz criticizes the
proposition's use of total personal
income, saying "it (the
proposition) says little as to how a
figure for total personal income is
to be arrived at." Yet this
statement apparently ignores
section 16(k) which states the
definition of "State Personal
Income."
Finally, perhaps the loudest
criticism leveled at Proposition
One by Lobsenz and others relates
to a supposed decrease in state
revenues and services which will
occur if Proposition One is
enacted. All of these criticisms
overlook the provisions in

Proposition One which will
specifically prevent a decline in
the present level of services. The
proposition provides in section 12
that the limit of state revenue will
never be lower than the real per
capita income of the state this
year, after allowing for
adjustments provided by election
or program transfers. This means
that the state will always have
available at least as much money
per person as it does today to
provide the same services. There is
no basis in fact to believe any of
the estimates which claim that
Proposition One will fail to
provide money for present
programs. What Proposition One
will do is prevent unlimited
expansion of state revenues, and
therefore state taxes.
