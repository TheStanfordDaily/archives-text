Let's talk
about 1980.
We offer you a bright future in satellite communications, a
vigorous new industry that will just begin to hit its stride in 1980.
I And we're the acknowledged leader. Whenever you see "Via
Satellite" on your TV screen, the satellite was built by Hughes.
Of course, we also offer everything else an engineer could
I want. The dynamic Southern California environment. We pay
top dollar. Our offices are modern and attractive. Our
laboratories are loaded with the latest equipment.
I But most of all, we offer you a chance go grow. We're ex- i
panding rapidly. We need new graduate engineers who can step
up to new responsibilities. We have a well-organized program to
■ help our engineers keep their skills up to date. I
This year we especially need advanced-degree candidates in
EE and ME in our hardware design systems and analysis areas.
Some of the activities include communications, controls,
propulsion, and structures.
It may be that more than one employment area of our com
pany will be recruiting on your campus on the same day. Please
try to sign up on the schedule that is most appropriate for you. It
I will not be necessary to have more than one interview, although |
you may if there is time.
