# Stanford Officials Plan Slower Growth Period

Stanford plans to stabilize its
student enrollment and faculty size,
while consolidating and upgrading
existing University facilities,
University Provost William Miller told
the Palo Alto City Council last night.
"All of our long range forecasting is
based on the premise that there will be
no increase in the number of students
and only a small increase in the size of
the faculty," Miller stated.
The dialogue yesterday evening
between Miller, Robert Augsburger,
vice president for business and finance,
Clayton Rich, dean of the medical
school and members of the city
council was arranged by a newly

formed Stanford-Palo Alto liaison
committee. The presentation of facts
pertaining to Stanford to the City
Council was the first such meeting in
recent memory.
Miller explained that the decision
to maintain Stanford's undergraduate
enrollment at approximately 6500
students while keeping its graduate
enrollment at about 5000 students was
made for two reasons.
First, the University's enrollment is
already at a good level, Miller said. It is
large enough to make Stanford an
effective institution, but it is small
enough to permit interaction between
students, he contended.
Hurts Programs, Standards
Secondly, Miller noted that the
University cannot afford to expand
and yet maintain its widespread
programs and high academic standards.
Miller explained that plans for the
University focus therefore on the
improvement of existing facilities.
Construction of new chemistry,
engineering, and earth science
buildings is planned, Miller said.
Also, the Hoover Institute will be
expanded, with a "Hoover Three
Building" to be built behind the
Hoover Tower.
In order to promote intellectual
interaction among undergraduates, the
Quadrangle will remain the center of
academic life, but the Quad will be
renovated, Miller said. In the past,
Quadrangle changes have been made in
piecemeal fashion, he noted. A
thorough modernization is now in
order, Miller stated.
Remove Temporary Structures
Elimination of numerous
temporary structures which dot the
campus is also planned, Miller
continued. Not only will this make the
campus more aesthetically appealing,
but the consolidation of small
buildings will facilitate academic
efficiency, he said.

Planning officials are attempting to
provide more offices for graduate
students, and an increase in the
number of laboratories, Miller added.
Augsburger explained why financial
conditions restrict University growth.
"Almost from the beginning,
Stanford has labored under the illusion
that it was wealthy," Augsburger said.
"While it is true that Mrs. Stanford's
beneficence made the school at one
time the most heavily endowed
university in the nation, it was many
years before people woke up to the
fact that Stanford needed help."
Although Stanford's endowment of
$347 million makes the University one
of the most heavily endowed in the
nation, the school ranks tenth among
universities in the country for per
student endowment, he said.
Stanford has an endowment of
approximately $26,500 per student,
ranking considerably behind
institutions of comparable academic
quality such as Yale, Rice and
Princeton, Augsburger noted.
Not only has Stanford's operating
budget run a slight deficit in recent
years, but the deficit is expected to
increase if existing financial conditions
prevail, he said.
Attempting to change the situation,
the Campaign For Stanford is trying to
raise $300 million in five years,
Augsburger said. With one third of the
time period gone, the University has
pledges of $120 million, he stated.
The medical school plans to
stabilize its enrollment also, Rich said.
The largest of Stanford's professional
schools, it has an enrollment of
approximately 1000 students, he said.
While the Stanford Medical Center
plans to increase in the next decade its
number of beds from 612 to 808 and
expand its physical plant and research
facilities, its major emphasis will
remain the instruction of medical
students, Rich emphasized.
