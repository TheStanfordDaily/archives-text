# Ruling Class Silence Suggests Approval
## Shockley Attracts Growing Support 
### 
David Groff

William Shockley has once
again laid his program of genocide
before the Stanford Community
(Daily, Oct. 23, 24). Under the
banner of "realistic humanism" he
rails against "humanism gone
beserk" and calls for "action that
prevents bringing babies into the
world with both heredity and
environment stacked against
them."
Shockley, of course, bases his
conclusions about alleged racial
difference in intelligence on data
drawn from I.Q. tests. That such
data has an inherent cultural and
class bias is well-known in
educational circles. What is
dangerous about Shockley's
program, however, is not its basis
in pseudo-science, but rather its
political aspects. It is to these
political aspects that I wish to
address myself here.
The crucial question to raise
about Shockley, Jensen and
others of their ilk is whv they

have received so much media
coverage. After all, their ideas are
not particularly new. What is new
is the interest they are generating
within certain circles. This new
interest in academic racist theories
derives, I submit, from the present
crisis of American society.
Manifestation
Economically, this crisis
manifests itself in unemployment
and inflation at home, a weakened
dollar and an increasingly
uncompetitive trade position
aborad. Politically, it manifests
itself not only in Watergate but
also, and more profoundly, in the
failure of liberalism to generate
effective ways of dealing with
America's social ills. With the
failure of most Great Society
programs, liberals have been
reduced, domestically, to simply
attacking the corruption of Nixon
and his reactionary henchmen.
While such a posture may bring

them some success at the polls, it
in no way provides an effective
alternative to Nixonian reaction.
The political vacuum created
by the decline of liberalism has
provided reactionaries with an
opportunity to resurrect older
explanations of poverty and social
unrest. It is in this context that
Shockley and the other
neo-deGobineauists must be
viewed. Their theories provide the
more reactionary elements within
America's ruling class with a new
justification for their long
standing prejudice that poverty is
the fault of the poor.
Shockley, however, is no
common idealogue. He also
suggests concrete programs which
promise some sort of final
solution to the problem of "the
other America." Contrary to
Shockley's view of himself as a
martyr for science, these programs
are striking an increasingly
responsive chord in some of
America's most powerful circles.
It is certainly no coincidence that
Shockley has been invited to use a
U.S. House of Representatives
conference room as a platform for
his criminal opinions. What
leftwing figures have received
similar privileges from Pete
McCloskey of late?
Dichotomy
In analyzing the political
importance of Shockley's ideas,
we must avoid adopting his
perception of what constitute the
sides of the argument. His
dichotomy between "realistic
humanism" and "humanism gone
beserk" must be recognized for
the mystification that it is. What
Shockley calls "realistic
humanism" is really nothing more
than a spruced up version of the
kind of social Darwinism so
appealing to persons who draw so
much benefit from our present
social and economic arrangements
that they can perceive no other

way of ordering society.
On the other hand, those
whom Shockley associates with
what he calls "humanism gone
beserk" are far from the most
reliable critics of his theories.
Perhaps Kennedy and other
liberals are as morally affronted
by Shockley's ideas as they claim
to be. But apart from their
moralizing, what do they do to
fight him? Their position of
formal egalitarianism is ultimately
compromised by their
commitment to private property
rights and the class interests of the
rich and powerful.
Moreover, many liberals have
begun to abandon even their
formal commitment to egalitarian
social policies. One has only to
peruse the pages of Commentary,
once a bastion of liberalism, to
attest to the accuracy of this
latter statement.
The most dependable
opposition to Shockley and the
powerful forces which back his
ideas comes not from ruling class
liberals like Kennedy but from the
people directly threatened by
Shockley ism: poor people in
generaland black poor in particular.
Ultimately, the most effective
form of self protection for these
people lies in their own organized
social action. To exclude the
possibility of such action and to
confine ourselves to debates
within the ruling class, would be
to present an incomplete,
distorted picture of the politics of
Shockley ism.
At present Shockley, Jensen,
Herrnstein, et al. are still primarily
problems for the University
community to resolve. It is
imperative that progressive people
at Stanford mount a movement
against Shockley and the
potentially murderous ideas he
propagates.

the fault of the poor.
Shockley, however, is no
common idealogue. He also
suggests concrete programs which
promise some sort of final
solution to the problem of "the
other America." Contrary to
Shockley's view of himself as a
martyr for science, these programs
are striking an increasingly
responsive chord in some of
America's most powerful circles.
It is certainly no coincidence that
Shockley has been invited to use a
U.S. House of Representatives
conference room as a platform for
his criminal opinions. What
leftwing figures have received
similar privileges from Pete
McCloskey of late?
Dichotomy
In analyzing the political
importance of Shockley's ideas,
we must avoid adopting his
perception of what constitute the
sides of the argument. His
dichotomy between "realistic
humanism" and "humanism gone
beserk" must be recognized for
the mystification that it is. What
Shockley calls "realistic
humanism" is really nothing more
than a spruced up version of the
kind of social Darwinism so
appealing to persons who draw so
much benefit from our present
social and economic arrangements
that they can perceive no other

way of ordering society.
On the other hand, those
whom Shockley associates with
what he calls "humanism gone
beserk" are far from the most
reliable critics of his theories.
Perhaps Kennedy and other
liberals are as morally affronted
by Shockley's ideas as they claim
to be. But apart from their
moralizing, what do they do to
fight him? Their position of
formal egalitarianism is ultimately
compromised by their
commitment to private property
rights and the class interests of the
rich and powerful.
Moreover, many liberals have
begun to abandon even their
formal commitment to egalitarian
social policies. One has only to
peruse the pages of Commentary,
once a bastion of liberalism, to
attest to the accuracy of this
latter statement.
The most dependable
opposition to Shockley and the
powerful forces which back his
ideas comes not from ruling class
liberals like Kennedy but from the
people directly threatened by
Shockley ism: poor people in
generaland black poor in particular.
Ultimately, the most effective
form of self protection for these
people lies in their own organized
social action. To exclude the
possibility of such action and to
confine ourselves to debates
within the ruling class, would be
to present an incomplete,
distorted picture of the politics of
Shockley ism.
At present Shockley, Jensen,
Herrnstein, et al. are still primarily
problems for the University
community to resolve. It is
imperative that progressive people
at Stanford mount a movement
against Shockley and the
potentially murderous ideas he
propagates.

William Shockley has once
again laid his program of genocide
before the Stanford Community
(Daily, Oct. 23, 24). Under the
banner of "realistic humanism" he
rails against "humanism gone
beserk" and calls for "action that
prevents bringing babies into the
world with both heredity and
environment stacked against
them."
Shockley, of course, bases his
conclusions about alleged racial
difference in intelligence on data
drawn from I.Q. tests. That such
data has an inherent cultural and
class bias is well-known in
educational circles. What is
dangerous about Shockley's
program, however, is not its basis
in pseudo-science, but rather its
political aspects. It is to these
political aspects that I wish to
address myself here.
The crucial question to raise
about Shockley, Jensen and
others of their ilk is whv they

have received so much media
coverage. After all, their ideas are
not particularly new. What is new
is the interest they are generating
within certain circles. This new
interest in academic racist theories
derives, I submit, from the present
crisis of American society.
Manifestation
Economically, this crisis
manifests itself in unemployment
and inflation at home, a weakened
dollar and an increasingly
uncompetitive trade position
aborad. Politically, it manifests
itself not only in Watergate but
also, and more profoundly, in the
failure of liberalism to generate
effective ways of dealing with
America's social ills. With the
failure of most Great Society
programs, liberals have been
reduced, domestically, to simply
attacking the corruption of Nixon
and his reactionary henchmen.
While such a posture may bring

them some success at the polls, it
in no way provides an effective
alternative to Nixonian reaction.
The political vacuum created
by the decline of liberalism has
provided reactionaries with an
opportunity to resurrect older
explanations of poverty and social
unrest. It is in this context that
Shockley and the other
neo-deGobineauists must be
viewed. Their theories provide the
more reactionary elements within
America's ruling class with a new
justification for their long
standing prejudice that poverty is
the fault of the poor.

William Shockley has once
again laid his program of genocide
before the Stanford Community
(Daily, Oct. 23, 24). Under the
banner of "realistic humanism" he
rails against "humanism gone
beserk" and calls for "action that
prevents bringing babies into the
world with both heredity and
environment stacked against
them."
Shockley, of course, bases his
conclusions about alleged racial
difference in intelligence on data
drawn from I.Q. tests. That such
data has an inherent cultural and
class bias is well-known in
educational circles. What is
dangerous about Shockley's
program, however, is not its basis
in pseudo-science, but rather its
political aspects. It is to these
political aspects that I wish to
address myself here.
The crucial question to raise
about Shockley, Jensen and
others of their ilk is whv they

have received so much media
coverage. After all, their ideas are
not particularly new. What is new
is the interest they are generating
within certain circles. This new
interest in academic racist theories
derives, I submit, from the present
crisis of American society.
Manifestation
Economically, this crisis
manifests itself in unemployment
and inflation at home, a weakened
dollar and an increasingly
uncompetitive trade position
aborad. Politically, it manifests
itself not only in Watergate but
also, and more profoundly, in the
failure of liberalism to generate
effective ways of dealing with
America's social ills. With the
failure of most Great Society
programs, liberals have been
reduced, domestically, to simply
attacking the corruption of Nixon
and his reactionary henchmen.
While such a posture may bring

them some success at the polls, it
in no way provides an effective
alternative to Nixonian reaction.
The political vacuum created
by the decline of liberalism has
provided reactionaries with an
opportunity to resurrect older
explanations of poverty and social
unrest. It is in this context that
Shockley and the other
neo-deGobineauists must be
viewed. Their theories provide the
more reactionary elements within
America's ruling class with a new
justification for their long
standing prejudice that poverty is
the fault of the poor.
Shockley, however, is no
common idealogue. He also
suggests concrete programs which
promise some sort of final
solution to the problem of "the
other America." Contrary to
Shockley's view of himself as a
martyr for science, these programs
are striking an increasingly
responsive chord in some of
America's most powerful circles.
It is certainly no coincidence that
Shockley has been invited to use a
U.S. House of Representatives
conference room as a platform for
his criminal opinions. What
leftwing figures have received
similar privileges from Pete
McCloskey of late?
Dichotomy
In analyzing the political
importance of Shockley's ideas,
we must avoid adopting his
perception of what constitute the
sides of the argument. His
dichotomy between "realistic
humanism" and "humanism gone
beserk" must be recognized for
the mystification that it is. What
Shockley calls "realistic
humanism" is really nothing more
than a spruced up version of the
kind of social Darwinism so
appealing to persons who draw so
much benefit from our present
social and economic arrangements
that they can perceive no other

way of ordering society.
On the other hand, those
whom Shockley associates with
what he calls "humanism gone
beserk" are far from the most
reliable critics of his theories.
Perhaps Kennedy and other
liberals are as morally affronted
by Shockley's ideas as they claim
to be. But apart from their
moralizing, what do they do to
fight him? Their position of
formal egalitarianism is ultimately
compromised by their
commitment to private property
rights and the class interests of the
rich and powerful.
Moreover, many liberals have
begun to abandon even their
formal commitment to egalitarian
social policies. One has only to
peruse the pages of Commentary,
once a bastion of liberalism, to
attest to the accuracy of this
latter statement.
The most dependable
opposition to Shockley and the
powerful forces which back his
ideas comes not from ruling class
liberals like Kennedy but from the
people directly threatened by
Shockley ism: poor people in
generaland black poor in particular.
Ultimately, the most effective
form of self protection for these
people lies in their own organized
social action. To exclude the
possibility of such action and to
confine ourselves to debates
within the ruling class, would be
to present an incomplete,
distorted picture of the politics of
Shockley ism.
At present Shockley, Jensen,
Herrnstein, et al. are still primarily
problems for the University
community to resolve. It is
imperative that progressive people
at Stanford mount a movement

potentially murderous ideas he
