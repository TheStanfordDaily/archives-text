Arabs Initiated War
Editor:
Before the campus, and the
world at large, forget about the
war in the Middle East, I would
like to complain about the Daily's
headlines pertaining to that war.
During the first few days of the
war, the Daily's headlines made
the conflict appear to be a
pre-emptive attack by Israel,
which was certainly not the case.
The fact is that it was Egypt
and Syria who started this war.
Both American and United
Nations sources have declared that
this latest war was begun by a
full-scale Arab offensive, planned
for weeks in advance, and
initiated on Yom Kippur, when
most Israelis were fasting and in
the synagogue. It was the Arabs
who broke the tenuous peace of
the last six years by launching an
all-out attack, without warning,
on the day when Israel would be
least capable of defending herself.
The principal reason I mention
this now is that we now have a
ceasefire in place, however
shaky. The Arab nations will
object vehemently to the Israeli
presence west of the Suez Canal,
and in the newly occupied parts of
Syria, and demand an Israeli
withdrawal from those lands. But
it was the action of the Arabs that
brought Israeli armies across the
Suez Canal, not an aggressive
action by Israel.
The Arab nations initiated this
war, and if they suffer as a result
it is not because of Israeli
aggression, as the Arabs have so
often claimed. The Daily's
distortion of the outbreak of the

war did not give its readers a true
picture of the situation; instead it
gave the Arabs a diplomatic
advantage they most definitely do
not deserve.

According to the news
broadcasts from the Mideast
both parties have growing interest
in putting the cease-fire into
effect. Egypt cannot afford to
lose its third army which is now
encircled and without water.
Israel has made considerable
territorial gains and is in a good
bargaining position. The Russian
proposal to send some troops to

supervise tne cease-fire is not
sufficient to provoke a general
alert of the American forces.
There is another obvious reason.
Mr. Nixon doesn't want to
respond to the legitimate uproar
caused by his firing of Cox. He
has no valid reason for having
done so. However he did not want
to keep Cox because his
investigation was getting too close
to some of Nixon's friends and
associates.
A gamble with internal politics
should never be a reason for a
gamble with international peace.
This, to me, is sufficient reason
for impeachment.

Before the campus, and the
world at large, forget about the
war in the Middle East, I would
like to complain about the Daily's
headlines pertaining to that war.
During the first few days of the
war, the Daily's headlines made
the conflict appear to be a
pre-emptive attack by Israel,
which was certainly not the case.
The fact is that it was Egypt
and Syria who started this war.
Both American and United
Nations sources have declared that
this latest war was begun by a
full-scale Arab offensive, planned
for weeks in advance, and
initiated on Yom Kippur, when
most Israelis were fasting and in
the synagogue. It was the Arabs
who broke the tenuous peace of
the last six years by launching an
all-out attack, without warning,
on the day when Israel would be
least capable of defending herself.
The principal reason I mention
this now is that we now have a
ceasefire in place, however
shaky. The Arab nations will
object vehemently to the Israeli
presence west of the Suez Canal,
and in the newly occupied parts of
Syria, and demand an Israeli
withdrawal from those lands. But
it was the action of the Arabs that
brought Israeli armies across the
Suez Canal, not an aggressive
action by Israel.
The Arab nations initiated this
war, and if they suffer as a result
it is not because of Israeli
aggression, as the Arabs have so
often claimed. The Daily's
distortion of the outbreak of the

war did not give its readers a true
picture of the situation; instead it
gave the Arabs a diplomatic
advantage they most definitely do
not deserve.

According to the news
broadcasts from the Mideast
both parties have growing interest
in putting the cease-fire into
effect. Egypt cannot afford to
lose its third army which is now
encircled and without water.
Israel has made considerable
territorial gains and is in a good
bargaining position. The Russian
proposal to send some troops to

supervise tne cease-fire is not
sufficient to provoke a general
alert of the American forces.
There is another obvious reason.
Mr. Nixon doesn't want to
respond to the legitimate uproar
caused by his firing of Cox. He
has no valid reason for having
done so. However he did not want
to keep Cox because his
investigation was getting too close
to some of Nixon's friends and
associates.
A gamble with internal politics
should never be a reason for a
gamble with international peace.
This, to me, is sufficient reason
for impeachment.
