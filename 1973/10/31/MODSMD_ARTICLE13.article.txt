# Promotional Mobility Of Minority Women Remains A Problem
## 
### ANN AMIOKA 
Although minorities and
women in staff positions now
have better chances of promotion
than before, the problem of
"internal upper mobility"
remains, said Anne Miner,
University affirmative action
officer, at the YWCA Tuesday
Sandwich Series at the Women's
Clubhouse.
Miner contended that the
problem is no longer active
discrimination, but a more subtle,
deep-rooted attitude towards
women.
As an example, Miner cited the
executive who takes a subordinate
as a protege with the idea of
training this subordinate for an

executive position. Because the
idea of a women executive is still
not highly popular, women are
seldom allowed the opportunity
to receive this sort of informal
training, Miner said.
Another example of this
attitude is the administrator who
is afraid to criticize a woman
because he isn't used to having a
female administrator working
under him. She noted that no
criticism is just as bad as too
much criticism, and that women
should receive both positive and
negative feedback from their
superiors.
Miner also observed that there
are many women vying for
relatively few administrative
positions.
The University's affirmative
action program is actively
involved in "trying to make
opportunity meaningfully equal,"
said Miner. The program has three

structural programs to carry this
out: 1) an external program
dealing with what the program
will do; 2) a faculty program,
which reviews hiring practices for
faculty; and 3) a staff program
that reviews the hiring of staff
members.
Miner noted that 20 percent of
the new faculty employees were
women — the same percentage as
last year. She also mentioned that
the program should be publishing
another report in about a month.
The affirmative action program
was set up by the University to
ensure compliance with federal
laws on equal job opportunities.
Also influential was the idea that
discrimination is sometimes
unintentional, she said. Perhaps
most important, she theorized,
was the belief that in order to be a
first-rate educational institution,
the University reflect a diversity
in culture.
