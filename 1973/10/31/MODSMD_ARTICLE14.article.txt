# City Removes Meters
## 
### 
Some 774 one-hour parking
meters in downtown Palo Alto
will be covered over tomorrow for
30 days in an experiment to
determine their worth to the city.
The City Council orderd the
trial after pleas from downtown
merchants and businessmen, who
want to encourage more people to
shop downtown.
The merchants want the
central spaces reserved for short
term parkers who shop in their
stores.
The experiment, which could
lead to the permanent removal of
the meters, will determine
whether parking violations
increase among "sleepers,"
employees who park their cars in
limited time zones and leave them
there rather than walk further to
work.
Resistance to removal of the
meters has come primarily from
landowners and non-merchant
businesses who like the more than
$55,000 annual revenue the
meters obtain for parking
assessment district bond
payments.
