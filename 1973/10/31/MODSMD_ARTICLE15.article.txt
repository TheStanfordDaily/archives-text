# Medal Of Honor Winner Wanted To Be Involved
## 
### 
PETALUMA (AP) - The
father of Medal of Honor winner
Richard Penry, facing trial on
cocaine sale charges, says he
thinks his son "wanted to be
involved in what everybody else
was doing."
His mother added in an
interview that it's important to
remember that "heroes are just
ordinary people."
Both Frank and Beverly Penry
speak with mingled pride and
sadness about their son Richard,
24. He returned to his hometown
two years ago winner of the
nation's highest military honor.
Last October 4, Penry was
arrested on charges of selling 24
grams of cocaine worth $950 to
Sonoma county sheriff's
undercover agents. He was
arraigned Monday and had his
case continued a week.
Penry, who is free on $10,000
bail, has refused to discuss the
charges on the advice of Robert
Mackey, longtime family lawyer.
"I never had any problem with
my kids. I don't know why this
happened," Frank Penry, a fire
captain, said at the family's
comfortable home in this town of
31,000 people 30 miles north of
San Francisco.
"I don't think it was for the
money, but maybe because he
wanted to be involved in what
everybody else was doing," he
said.
Penry's brother Darryl, training
to become a policeman, said

Penry "must have had some
reason for what he did. And I
don't know what it is."
Penry, who now wears a bushy
full beard, was awarded the medal
by President Nixon for
singlehandedly stopping an
ambush attack by 30 enemy
soldiers in Binh Tuy province in
Vietnam.
He escaped injury except for
"a few scrapes from doing the low
crawl backwards trying to dodge
bullets," Penry said. "It was a case
of doing something and saving my
life, or giving up."
After returning to a hero's
welcome in Petaluma, Penry took
his pre-war job as cook at a local
hotel, moved out of his parents'
home, and a year ago set up his
own antique business.
With his Medal goes a
$100-a-month life pension. With
that help, he bought a $3800
chopper motorcycle and a fancy
old sports car. Of the car he said,
"I'll have to sell it pretty soon to
pay my lawyer's fees."

PETALUMA (AP) - The
father of Medal of Honor winner
Richard Penry, facing trial on
cocaine sale charges, says he
thinks his son "wanted to be
involved in what everybody else
was doing."
His mother added in an
interview that it's important to
remember that "heroes are just
ordinary people."
Both Frank and Beverly Penry
speak with mingled pride and
sadness about their son Richard,
24. He returned to his hometown
two years ago winner of the
nation's highest military honor.
Last October 4, Penry was
arrested on charges of selling 24
grams of cocaine worth $950 to
Sonoma county sheriff's
undercover agents. He was
arraigned Monday and had his
case continued a week.
Penry, who is free on $10,000
bail, has refused to discuss the
charges on the advice of Robert
Mackey, longtime family lawyer.
"I never had any problem with
my kids. I don't know why this
happened," Frank Penry, a fire
captain, said at the family's
comfortable home in this town of
31,000 people 30 miles north of
San Francisco.
"I don't think it was for the
money, but maybe because he
wanted to be involved in what
everybody else was doing," he
said.
Penry's brother Darryl, training
to become a policeman, said

Penry "must have had some
reason for what he did. And I
don't know what it is."
Penry, who now wears a bushy
full beard, was awarded the medal
by President Nixon for
singlehandedly stopping an
ambush attack by 30 enemy
soldiers in Binh Tuy province in
Vietnam.
He escaped injury except for
"a few scrapes from doing the low
crawl backwards trying to dodge
bullets," Penry said. "It was a case
of doing something and saving my
life, or giving up."
After returning to a hero's
welcome in Petaluma, Penry took
his pre-war job as cook at a local
hotel, moved out of his parents'
home, and a year ago set up his
own antique business.
