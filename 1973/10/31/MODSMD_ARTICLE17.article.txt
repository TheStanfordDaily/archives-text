# Fuel Shortage May Force Winter School Shutdowns
## 
### 
(AP) â€” School children in
scattered areas of the country
may find themselves with extra
time off this winter because of the
fuel shortage. They'll pay for the
holiday with added class hours
when the weather gets warmer.
An Associated Press spot check
showed officials in a number of
school districts were considering
extending winter vacations and
lowering classroom temperatures
as a way of saving fuel.
A bill has been introduced in
the Michigan legislature to permit
schools to close because of
heating problems without
forfeiting state aid payments.

John W. Porter, Michigan
superintendent of public
instruction, said some schools
might have to close for a short
time this winter and added, "On a
long-range basis, we may be
forced to close schools for several
months in the winter and keep
them open during the summer if
the energy crisis worsens in the
years ahead."
The Maryland department of
education set up a committee of
school superintendents to draw up
plans in case of a fuel shortage.
Some school systems already have
ordered temperatures lowered
from 70 to 65 degrees during the
day and from 60 to 55 degrees at
night.
The nagging fuel shortage that
struck motorists this summer has
been compounded by a cutback in
Arab production due to the
Mideast war. Some Arab countries
have banned exports to the
United States in an effort to
pressure Washington to cut off
support of Israel. The shortage
also has pushed up prices,
straining school budgets.
Minnesota Education
Commissioner Howard Casmey
said more than 75 percent of the
state's districts responding to a
survey said they didn't expect to
have enough fuel for the winter.
Officials in Kansas City, Mo.,
are studying the possibility of
consolidating students into fewer
buildings and closing the extra
classrooms. Jim Newell, assistant
superintendent of schools, said
authorities also are looking for a
full-time "energy consultant" to
help in conserving fuel.
Some states said they didn't
expect any problems. In Utah,
where the first snow of the season
fell on Monday, there was no talk
at all of longer vacations or cooler
classrooms. "We have enough fuel
to take care of the needs of our
present customers," said one of
the major suppliers.
