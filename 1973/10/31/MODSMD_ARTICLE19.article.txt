# Oil Firms Not Responsible For Crisis
## 
### DAVID SMITH 
"Despite all the recent
publicity, most people still don't
realize how serious the energy
crisis really is. In the next five
years we will be faced with real
shortages and any attempt to
blame the crisis on oil-corporation
monopoly is a mere delusion,"
stated Richard Balzhiser of the
Electric Power Research Institute
at a seminar in Jordan Hall
Monday.
Balzhiser stressed that although
the U.S. now relies on oil and gas
for 75 percent of its energy needs,
these resources have now
"peaked." "In the words of
Russell Peterson, 'Popeye has run
out of cheap spinach.' We have to
work hard on developing all our
available resources, and in the
very important interim period of
the next five years we must
continue our very sophisticated
and highly necessary methods of
offshore drilling," he contended.
Balzhiser cited coal and
uranium fission as the most
promising fuels for the future.
The major objection to coal
burning has been emission of
noxious sulfur oxides; according
to Balzhiser, "stack-gas cleaning"
devices have been developed
which could reduce these
emissions, "but installing and
maintaining one in a power plant
could cost as much as the plant
itself. This would send power
costs soaring: we must consider
increasing combusion efficiency
first."
Despite the existing problems
of safety and radioactive waste
control, Balzhiser considers
nuclear reactors an attractive
option.
"On this issue, many critics
have actually been
obstructionist," he stated. "I also

hope they don't try to upset our
highest-priority goal of developing
liquid-metal breeder reactors. In
my opinion, the possibility of
Plutonium hijacking is purely a
red herring. TTiere are much easier
ways to commit crimes against
society."
He also cited three "long shot"
possible energy sources:
geothermal energy, solar power
and nuclear fission. "None of
these will be a major factor before
the late 1980s, but we must
continue to research their

possibilities."
"Besides developing new
sources, we must seriously
reevaluate our use of power,
which has about quadrupled in
the last 20 years. The cost of
energy will go up; this is needed
to keep consumption down.
Detroit will have to build smaller,
more efficient cars. I think all the
power producers know they have
no option but to become more
efficient; otherwise they'll run out
of ways to supply their
consumers."

and nuclear fission. "None of
these will be a major factor before
the late 1980s, but we must
continue to research their

possibilities."
"Besides developing new
sources, we must seriously
reevaluate our use of power,
which has about quadrupled in
the last 20 years. The cost of
energy will go up; this is needed
to keep consumption down.
Detroit will have to build smaller,
more efficient cars. I think all the
power producers know they have
no option but to become more
efficient; otherwise they'll run out
of ways to supply their
consumers."
"Despite all the recent
publicity, most people still don't
realize how serious the energy
crisis really is. In the next five
years we will be faced with real
shortages and any attempt to
blame the crisis on oil-corporation
monopoly is a mere delusion,"
stated Richard Balzhiser of the
Electric Power Research Institute
at a seminar in Jordan Hall
Monday.
Balzhiser stressed that although
the U.S. now relies on oil and gas
for 75 percent of its energy needs,
these resources have now
"peaked." "In the words of
Russell Peterson, 'Popeye has run
out of cheap spinach.' We have to
work hard on developing all our
available resources, and in the
very important interim period of
the next five years we must
continue our very sophisticated
and highly necessary methods of
offshore drilling," he contended.
Balzhiser cited coal and
uranium fission as the most
promising fuels for the future.
The major objection to coal
burning has been emission of
noxious sulfur oxides; according
to Balzhiser, "stack-gas cleaning"
devices have been developed
which could reduce these
emissions, "but installing and
maintaining one in a power plant
could cost as much as the plant
itself. This would send power
costs soaring: we must consider
increasing combusion efficiency
first."
Despite the existing problems
of safety and radioactive waste
control, Balzhiser considers
nuclear reactors an attractive
option.
"On this issue, many critics
have actually been
obstructionist," he stated. "I also

hope they don't try to upset our
highest-priority goal of developing
liquid-metal breeder reactors. In
my opinion, the possibility of
Plutonium hijacking is purely a
red herring. TTiere are much easier
ways to commit crimes against
society."
He also cited three "long shot"
possible energy sources:
geothermal energy, solar power
and nuclear fission. "None of
these will be a major factor before
the late 1980s, but we must
continue to research their

possibilities."
"Besides developing new
