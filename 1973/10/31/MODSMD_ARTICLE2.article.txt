# White House House Official Claims
## Nixon 'Not Involved' In ITT Case 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The White
House turned over its entire ITT file to
the special Watergate prosecutor, and
the documents "do not show any
personal involvement by the President
in the terms of the ITT settlement in
the summer of 1971," a ranking White
House official said last night.
A White House aide's memorandum
unearthed by the Senate Watergate
committee last August said one of the
documents would "directly involve the
President" in the ITT antitrust case
and others would show numerous
attempts by the White House to
intervene in the Justice Department's
handling of the legal dispute.
The Nixon official's comments
marked the first time a White House

official has responded to the memo
written March 30, 1972, by
then-special presidential counsel
Charles W. Colson and disclosed by the
Senate panel. The White House official
would not permit his name to be used.
The response came after The
Associated Press obtained a letter by
former Atty. Gen. Elliot L.
Richardson saying that special
Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox
had copies of five secret memoranda,
including the one Colson said would
involve the President.
Nixon had Cox fired 10 days ago.
The White House official said, "The
documents we provided demonstrated
that, while the President took an
active interest in the overall antitrust

policy of his administration and while
he wanted to ensure that actions of
the Justice Department complied with
this policy in a general way, the
documents do not show any personal
involvement by the President in the
terms of the ITT settlement in the
summer of 1971."
White House spokesman Gerald L.
Warren earlier had acknowledged that
the President ordered former Atty.
Gen. Richard G. Kleindienst not to
appeal a court decision favorable to
ITT but said he withdrew the order
after learning it did not contradict
administration antitrust policy. That
incident apparently occurred in the
spring of 1971.
Four members of the Senate

Judiciary Committee had asked
Richardson in August for a status
report on a number of documents,
including those described in the
Colson memo.
In his reply Sept. 6, Richardson
said, "There are five documents
mentioned in the Colson
memorandum which may have been in
the Department of Justice." Searches
of the department's files turned up
two of them, Richardson said, and
they were turned over to the special
prosecutor's office.
"The other three documents," he
said, "were not discovered in the
department, either in connection with
the Richard G. Kleindienst
confirmation hearings or the
subsequent perjury investigation.
"I am informed by the special
prosecutor's office, however, that he
now has copies of all three
documents."
The Colson memo was written to
convince Haldeman that Kleindienst's
nomination to be attorney general
should be withdrawn. Colson said
there was a serious risk that the Senate
confirmation hearings would unearth
documentary evidence of White House
intervention in the Justice
Department's antitrust suit against
International Telephone & Telegraph
Corp., which pledged $400,000 to
help the city of San Diego underwrite
the Republican National Convention.
The five documents mentioned by
Richardson are among the most
important cited by Colson. The former
White House lawyer said they would
show: that former Atty. Gen. John N.
Mitchell had been told of "the
$400,000 arrangement with ITT"
before the antitrust case was settled;
that presidential adviser John D.
Ehrlichman had told Mitchell of an
"understanding" with ITT President
Harold S. Geneen in a memo
complaining about the chief of the
antitrust division's actions; and that
the President and Mitchell had
discussed the " 'agreed upon ends' in
the resolution of the ITT case."

incident apparently occurred in the
spring of 1971.
Four members of the Senate

Judiciary Committee had asked
Richardson in August for a status
report on a number of documents,
including those described in the
Colson memo.
In his reply Sept. 6, Richardson
said, "There are five documents
mentioned in the Colson
memorandum which may have been in
the Department of Justice." Searches
of the department's files turned up
two of them, Richardson said, and
they were turned over to the special
prosecutor's office.
"The other three documents," he
said, "were not discovered in the
department, either in connection with
the Richard G. Kleindienst
confirmation hearings or the
subsequent perjury investigation.
"I am informed by the special
prosecutor's office, however, that he
now has copies of all three
documents."
The Colson memo was written to
convince Haldeman that Kleindienst's
nomination to be attorney general
should be withdrawn. Colson said
there was a serious risk that the Senate
confirmation hearings would unearth
documentary evidence of White House
intervention in the Justice
Department's antitrust suit against
International Telephone & Telegraph
Corp., which pledged $400,000 to
help the city of San Diego underwrite
the Republican National Convention.
The five documents mentioned by
Richardson are among the most
important cited by Colson. The former
White House lawyer said they would
show: that former Atty. Gen. John N.
Mitchell had been told of "the
$400,000 arrangement with ITT"
before the antitrust case was settled;
that presidential adviser John D.
Ehrlichman had told Mitchell of an
"understanding" with ITT President
Harold S. Geneen in a memo
complaining about the chief of the
antitrust division's actions; and that
the President and Mitchell had
discussed the " 'agreed upon ends' in
the resolution of the ITT case."
WASHINGTON (AP) - The White
House turned over its entire ITT file to
the special Watergate prosecutor, and
the documents "do not show any
personal involvement by the President
in the terms of the ITT settlement in
the summer of 1971," a ranking White
House official said last night.
A White House aide's memorandum
unearthed by the Senate Watergate
committee last August said one of the
documents would "directly involve the
President" in the ITT antitrust case
and others would show numerous
attempts by the White House to
intervene in the Justice Department's
handling of the legal dispute.
The Nixon official's comments
marked the first time a White House

official has responded to the memo
written March 30, 1972, by
then-special presidential counsel
Charles W. Colson and disclosed by the
Senate panel. The White House official
would not permit his name to be used.
The response came after The
Associated Press obtained a letter by
former Atty. Gen. Elliot L.
Richardson saying that special
Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox
had copies of five secret memoranda,
including the one Colson said would
involve the President.
Nixon had Cox fired 10 days ago.
The White House official said, "The
documents we provided demonstrated
that, while the President took an
active interest in the overall antitrust

policy of his administration and while
he wanted to ensure that actions of
the Justice Department complied with
this policy in a general way, the
documents do not show any personal
involvement by the President in the
terms of the ITT settlement in the
summer of 1971."
White House spokesman Gerald L.
Warren earlier had acknowledged that
the President ordered former Atty.
Gen. Richard G. Kleindienst not to
appeal a court decision favorable to
ITT but said he withdrew the order
after learning it did not contradict
administration antitrust policy. That
incident apparently occurred in the
spring of 1971.
