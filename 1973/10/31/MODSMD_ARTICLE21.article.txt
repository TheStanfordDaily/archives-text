# The 						Paper Chase'
## Any Student Can Relate To This Film 
### LAURA PULA 
The pervading aura of
anticipation and the chore of
making dorm rooms habitable
makes this opening day like many
others at schools across the
nation. This, however, is no
ordinary school this is Harvard
Law
Thus begins the film The Paper
Chase, giving little indication of
the merciless and sometimes
desperate pursuit of wealth,
status, and more immediately, the
almighty "A" that will soon
commence.
Enter young Hart, an idealistic
Minnesotan who quickly realizes
that his most formidalbe barrier
to success is in the form of
ferocious Professor Kingsfield.
Kingsfield's class in contract law
becomes an arena where survival is
uncertain even for the fittest, and
making a mistake often leads to
humiliation.
Hart is authentically and
sensitively played by Timothy
Bottoms, late of The Last Picture
Show. He makes the character
wholly believable, although he
does somehow persistently — if
somewhat improbably — recall
Ryan O'Neal's character in Love
Story.
Crusty Academician
Professor Kingsfield is the
eminent Writer-Director-Producer
John Houseman, presently head
of the drama department at
Juilliard Houseman plays his role
superbly as a brilliant, crusty
academician contemptuous of
these neophytes with what he
describes "heads full of mush."
Anyone who is or ever has been a
student will cringe under the
Professor's icy glare, even those in
the audience feel guilty and
almost compelled to take notes.
At one point in the film, Hart

decides to confront Professor
Kingsfield, and in class states
resoundingly that he is "a son of a
bitch." Choosing not to be
insulted, Kingsfield directs the
exiting Hart back to his seat,
declaring that that was the "most
intelligent" thing Hart had said all
day.
To combat the intense
pressure, Hart joins a study group
whose members pledge to aid each
other amidst the academic rivalry.
Those in the group include Bell,
repulsive, smug and successful;
insecure Kevin, who flounders
early in the term; and Hart's best
friend, Ford, a knowledgeable
fifth generation Harvard man.
The Professor's Daughter
Hart's problems are not solely
academic, however. He becomes

involved with a cool, rather
demanding young woman, Susan
(more shades of Love Story) who
turns out to be Kingsfield's
daughter. Their relationship is
often uneasy, as Susan objects to
Hart's need for organization and
rationality. Susan is adequately
played by Lindsay Wagner, who is
handicapped by the insufficient
development of Susan's character
and background.
In his screenplay adapted from a
novel by John Jay Osborne Jr.,
James Bridges has attempted to
comment on several fundamentals
of our social structure:
competition, approval, the
disproportionate importance of
making the grade, and the
authoritarian process that molds
future professionals. His effort,

however, falls short for, as
successful as The Paper Chase is as
a romantic comedy, the plot is
not quite strong enough to
support a discussion of broad
themes.
The conclusion of The Paper
Chase is intriguing, but strikingly
inconsistent. In the last few
minutes of the film, after the
year's overwhelming pressure that
sometimes approached hysteria,
after Kevin has attempted suicide
and even the few left in the study
group can no longer endure each
other, Hart takes on an entirely
different attitude. He decides that
he simply does not care what
grade he has received, and one is
left either silently applauding or
outraged.


ADVERSARY—Professor Kingsfield (John Houseman) is the epitome of the crusty university professor in
the film "The Paper Chase." His contract law class at the Harvard Law School is one of the barriers faced
by Hart (Timothy Bottoms), an idealistic student caught up in the pursuit of wealth, status, and of course,
grades.

Anyone who is or ever has been a
student will cringe under the
Professor's icy glare, even those in
the audience feel guilty and
almost compelled to take notes.
At one point in the film, Hart

decides to confront Professor
Kingsfield, and in class states
resoundingly that he is "a son of a
bitch." Choosing not to be
insulted, Kingsfield directs the
exiting Hart back to his seat,
declaring that that was the "most
intelligent" thing Hart had said all
day.
To combat the intense
pressure, Hart joins a study group
whose members pledge to aid each
other amidst the academic rivalry.
Those in the group include Bell,
repulsive, smug and successful;
insecure Kevin, who flounders
early in the term; and Hart's best
friend, Ford, a knowledgeable
fifth generation Harvard man.
The Professor's Daughter
Hart's problems are not solely
academic, however. He becomes

involved with a cool, rather
demanding young woman, Susan
(more shades of Love Story) who
turns out to be Kingsfield's
daughter. Their relationship is
often uneasy, as Susan objects to
Hart's need for organization and
rationality. Susan is adequately
played by Lindsay Wagner, who is
handicapped by the insufficient
development of Susan's character
and background.
In his screenplay adapted from a
novel by John Jay Osborne Jr.,
James Bridges has attempted to
comment on several fundamentals
of our social structure:
competition, approval, the
disproportionate importance of
making the grade, and the
authoritarian process that molds
future professionals. His effort,

however, falls short for, as
successful as The Paper Chase is as
a romantic comedy, the plot is
not quite strong enough to
support a discussion of broad
themes.
The conclusion of The Paper
Chase is intriguing, but strikingly
inconsistent. In the last few
minutes of the film, after the
year's overwhelming pressure that
sometimes approached hysteria,
after Kevin has attempted suicide
and even the few left in the study
group can no longer endure each
other, Hart takes on an entirely
different attitude. He decides that
he simply does not care what
grade he has received, and one is
left either silently applauding or
outraged.


ADVERSARY—Professor Kingsfield (John Houseman) is the epitome of the crusty university professor in
the film "The Paper Chase." His contract law class at the Harvard Law School is one of the barriers faced
by Hart (Timothy Bottoms), an idealistic student caught up in the pursuit of wealth, status, and of course,
grades.
The pervading aura of
anticipation and the chore of
making dorm rooms habitable
makes this opening day like many
others at schools across the
nation. This, however, is no
ordinary school this is Harvard
Law
Thus begins the film The Paper
Chase, giving little indication of
the merciless and sometimes
desperate pursuit of wealth,
status, and more immediately, the
almighty "A" that will soon
commence.
Enter young Hart, an idealistic
Minnesotan who quickly realizes
that his most formidalbe barrier
to success is in the form of
ferocious Professor Kingsfield.
Kingsfield's class in contract law
becomes an arena where survival is
uncertain even for the fittest, and
making a mistake often leads to
humiliation.
Hart is authentically and
sensitively played by Timothy
Bottoms, late of The Last Picture
Show. He makes the character
wholly believable, although he
does somehow persistently — if
somewhat improbably — recall
Ryan O'Neal's character in Love
Story.
