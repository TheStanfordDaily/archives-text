# Bill Evans Trio: Artful Jazz
## 
### VICKI LaBRIE 
SAN FRANCISCO - Jazz
pianist Bill Evans is known as an
introspective performer, but he
proved to be especially shy at his
El Matador opening night Thurs.,
Oct. 25.
It seemed that the Bill Evans
trio should have been named after
Eddie Gomez, the group's bassist,
who executed extremely poetic
and exacting solos in every
selection. Gomez is one of the
more talented and imaginative bass
soloists, issuing runs, accents and
bowed accompaniments; Evans on
the other hand, has been called a
genius, and it is disappointing to
have only a glimpse of that
brilliance.
Evans' present group
(Gomez —bass, Marty
Morell— drums) is possibly the
best (in terms of the pianist's
style) he has performed with
during his career. However, his
comfortableness with the group
did not assuage opening night
jitters or whatever fear he had of
snatching the spotlight from
Gomez once in a while.
The first set consisted of more
modern numbers than Evans
usually performs, Gomez soloing
in every number, his fingers
artfully darting up and down the
strings, hypnotizing the audience
with his agile fingers.
Theme and Variations
Evans' style is characterized by
an initial statement of the theme
played as an introduction
followed by variations containing
accentuating chords, runs, and
single note passages. He plays with
his ponytailed, bearded head bent
over his hands in concentration,
occasionally lifting his head in a
blank stare.
The last song of the first set, a
conglomeration of rhythms,
presented a series of solos from
each member of the trio,
beginning with Gomez, shifting
from Evans to Morell, and so on,
each one trying to best the last.
Morell demonstrated good,
competent support, although his
solos were unnecessary and
incongruous, and Evans exhibited
some exciting rhythmic structures
with his handling of accenting
unaccented notes and changing
time signatures within a measure
of each other.
The results of the second set

were much more pleasing. Evans
came out of his shell; his phrases
were more lilting and his playing
more emotional. It was suddenly
apparent that he was saying
something better musically than
anyone before.
Magic Combination
The trio plays more than
adequately, but something
astonishing happens and
everything materializes when they
are together. The tension vanishes,
the weight is lifted, the music
resolves.
When Evans is at his peak, it's
like floating on top of the music.
On "Everything Happens to Me,"
Evans performed what could be
termed his only solo — minus bass
and drums — and exposed the
lyrical, emotional, and deft
rhythmic quality that is the
essence of his playing.

Bill Evans is at his best when
performing standards, although no
matter how modern his playing
extends, there is still something to
grab onto, some base of lyricism,
rhythm, or execution. It was
worth the wait for a glimpse of
the genius of Evans and that
moment of elation and awe that
accompanies it.
El Matador is one of the city's
few night spots that continually
presents jazz groups in the most
complimentary setting. They
present three sets a night
(admission covers all three), are
always punctual, and offer
impressive music in intimate
surroundings — ideal conditions
for jazz groups. There is no setting
up of equipment and no back-up
groups to suffer through.
The Bill Evans Trio will be at
El Matador through Saturday
night.
