# Krasnayarsk Dance Company Presents Siberian Music, Dancing, And Acrobatics
## 
### RUST EDDIE 
SAN FRANCISCO - The
gymnastic wizardy of the
Krasnayarsk Dance Company of
Siberia is more humbling that the
mirror. Capturing the audience's
attention like a circus might,
dozens of Siberian dancers
whirled like tops Friday night at
the Masonic Auditorium.
Dancing with fire and
precision, the Krasnayarsk Dance
Company made several local
appearances over the weekend.
One of the youngest folk
companies in the Soviet Union,
the Krasnayarsk Dance Company,
founded in 1960, is currently
making its U.S. debut.
The dancers average 20 to 23
years old. Many are graduates of
ballet schools and all the men are
excellent acrobats. All the women
are blonds and their Busby
Berkeley routines are more to be
watched than studied. It is the
Krasnayarskian men performing
amazing vaults and squat-kicks
that save the production from
turning into a Cossack fashion
show.
Siberian Folk Themes
Integrating the 80-member
company is artistic director
Mikhail Godenko, an adept ballet

master. He touches on the
richness of Silberian music,
happily pairing it to dance themes
of folk festivals, games and
evening parties which contribute
to the program's appeal. The
pleasing combination of ancient
ring dances and modern dances
yields an attraction of varied
character and origin.

Composer Vladimir Kornev
likewise works on every
production. Via an orchestra of
14 and a pair of singers, he backs
up the balletic pantomime.
Together with musical and
choreographic contributions,
outstanding acrobatics produce
this prime dance company.
