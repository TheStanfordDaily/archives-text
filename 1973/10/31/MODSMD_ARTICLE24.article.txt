# Linda Ronstadt's 'Don't Cry Now' A Good 'Country Comfort' Album

### 
Linda Ronstadt:
Don't Cry Now
Asylum 5D5064
Have you ever had the urge to
sip Mint Juleps, suck on molasses
kisses, or soak yourself in the
warm sun on a lazy day? After
listening to Linda Ronstadt's
yummy new album, you may even
feel like taking a cool shower.
Don't Cry Now, her third solo
release, is a tremendous collection
of down-home country/western
music. Not being an ardent
follower of this sound, I was
disinclined to listen at all.
An additional reason I avoided
putting her on my turntable was
an incredible pictue of her on the
album cover. I couldn't take my
eyes off of it long enough to get
the record out. But after great
effort, I decided to give it a try,
much to my delight.
Linda Ronstadt possesses
potentially powerful singing
talent, similar to that of Carole
King and Lynne Anderson, and
complements this ability with the

glamour and fluency exhibited by
Carly Simon or Bobby Gentry.
Besides being comparable to these
female-vocalist superstars, she
could be the ideal counterpart of
John Denver.
Warmth, expression, and
intensity are descriptions which
spontaneously come to mind
when reviewing this album. I
became completely absorbed in
her easy-going, graceful ballads.
Her style is one that I personally
crave — peaceful and spirited.
My favorite cut is an
emotionally moving Neil Young
composition, "I Believe In You."
In contrast to that mellow sound,
Linda sings a snappy, rhythmic
old standby, "Silver Threads and
Golden Needles."
"The Fast One" displays a real
sassy sound in a light mood. If
you're not dragged down by the
thick accent in "Everybody Loves
a Winner" (which is a real loser),
you will be able to appreciate
Randy Newman's "Sail Away"
plus the other soft-selling
selection "Colorado."

Overall, I see time as Linda's
only obstacle (with perhaps a
perfected selection) in reaching
the top of the charts for a
permanent stay. She's relatively a
fresh, new performer with the
drive, charm, and polish that it
takes to be on top.
