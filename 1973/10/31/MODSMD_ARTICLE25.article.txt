# Garcia, Herrera Chase Kick Records
## 
### 
From the Pac-8 Conference
Most athletes get their kicks from records;
Rod Garcia and Efren Herrera get their
records from kicks.
Garcia whose late field goal lifted Stanford
past Michigan in the 1972 Rose Bowl, and
Herrera, who hopes to boot UCLA into the
1974 Rose Bowl, are two seniors locked in a
tight battle for the Pacific Eight Conference
career kick-scoring record.
Garcia currently holds a 170-167 advantage
over Herrera in their kick-scoring struggle, has
cracked the conference career field goal
standard with 35 three-pointers and has an
excellent opportunity to break the NCAA
mark of 37 by Bob Jacobs of Wyoming in
1968-70. (Garcia's two field goals in the 1972
Rose Bowl are discounted in the NCAA career
record, leaving him with 32 in pursuit of that
mark.)
Herrera has kicked 101 PAT's at UCLA,
shattering the conference standard of 99 by
Jim Cullom of California in 1947-49 and by
Steve Wiezbowski of Washington in 1970-72.
The following interview was conducted by
David Price and Susan Walling of the Pac-8
Public Relations Office.
Where were you born and when did you come
to the United States?
Garcia: I was bom in Santiago, Chile. My
dad was working for an oil company, and he
was transferred to the States. I was four years
old.
Herrera: I was born in Guadalajara,
Mexico. I came here in 1967 at the age of 16
with the idea of going to school. At that time
in Mexico I was working at a body fender
shop fixing cars. I had never played the
American version of football. I started playing
football in high school here.
Would you like to return to your native land
some time in the future?
Garcia: I've been back to Chile several
times. I would like to go back there to live
permanently. Well, I don't know about
permanently, but I'd like to go back and
perhaps help in the education of the people.
Parts of Chile are pretty backward. I'd like to
maybe teach or do volunteer work.
Herrera: I'll probably apply to become a
naturalized American citizen at the end of this
year. I want to stay here. I would like to go
back to Mexico to see what's happening on a
vacation, maybe, but I think I'm more
American now than Mexican. I think there's
so much I can do here for my own people.

Have you played soccer? Did it help you in
your kicking ability?
Garcia: I played a little bit in the Canary
Islands. I was about 11 years old.
Herrera: Oh, yeah. All my life. The town I
lived in — we played soccer from the time we
were four years old. In accuracy it means a lot
because in soccer that's what you do — kick
the ball to a certain space about seven yards
wide and five yards high. When I started
kicking a football it was just like soccer
except I was kicking it higher.
Did you ever try to kick the traditional
American way?

Garcia: Yeah, about four times. It's not as
exciting or as accurate.
Herrera: Yes, I've tried. I'm not that
consistent with it. I can kick from about 35 or
40 yards from straight on. But I get a lot more
accuracy and distance with the soccer style. I
think a soccer kicker can kick a little stronger
than a straight kicker.
Do you ever have a problem with the ball
hooking?
Garcia: Sure have. Any soccer style kicker
has his ball curve a little when he kicks it. It's
something you have to compensate for.

Herrera: A little bit. Everything is
dependent on the holder. If he holds the ball
straight, you can hardly get any hook. But if
he tilts the ball a little bit to the left side, it
automatically hooks the ball. If it's close
range, it won't make that much difference,
but if it's 35 yards or more it can make a lot
of difference.
What is your field goal range?
Garcia: In practice it's close to 70 yards.
I've kicked 54 yards in a game.. I try to hit
every ball the same, long or short, and
sometimes it hurts my accuracy close up.
Herrera: I tried to 59-yarder against
Arizona as a sophomore and it was three or
four yards short. I would like to kick at least a
55- or 57-yard field goal before I'm through
here. The whole thing is timing. I can kick a
60-yarder if I get the right timing. I'm just
waiting for that day. I hope the coaches give
me a chance to try it this year. I've kicked
from about 63 yards in practice.
Do you ever get bored in practice?
Garcia: Yes, it gets pretty boring. It
depends on who we're playing. If it's a big
game, I'm not nearly as bored.
Herrera: At times. I go out 25 minutes
before practice and kick PAT's and field goals.
I practice kickoffs on my own a lot, too.
Sometimes I just run to make me feel part of
the team. I sometimes try to cover kickoffs to
give me something to do. I used to be just a
safety man on kickoffs, but now they send me
down just to block someone to get in some
kind of contact. That makes it nicer for me.
Any embarrassing moments?
Garcia: Any time I miss an easy kick I feel
embarrassed. San Jose State was quite
embarrassing a couple of years ago. I missed
five field goals.
Herrera: Last year against USC I had a
chance to kick a 32-yard field goal. It was
10-7 and I would have tied the score. I just
blew it completely and I was really
embarrassed because we were at home and it
was such an important game.
Who is most responsible for your kicking
proficiency?
Garcia: At this very moment, there's a
person who's sorta resposible for the way I'm
doing right now and that's my coach, Norb
Hecker. But the person that started me going
in the right direction was my high school
coach, Phil Haggerty. He kinda gave me a kick
in the rear. He forced me to give the ball quite
a kick. That got me going.
