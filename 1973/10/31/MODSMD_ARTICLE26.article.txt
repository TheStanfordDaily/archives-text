## Women Seek Third Hockey Win 
### ELAINE MORITA 
Prospects are good for another victory as
Stanford's women's field hockey team takes its
2-0-1 record to Davis tomorrow for a 3 p.m. game
against UC-Davis.
The team currently stands first in the Northern
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference
(NCIAC) after defeating San Jose State 5-0,
Hayward State 6-0 and battling Sacramento State to
a 0-0 tie last Thursday.
Thursday's game against Sacramento materialized
into the most exciting of the season despite the
absence of scoring. Stanford coach Shirley Schoof
anticipated stiff competition from the visiting
Sacramento team, and Sacramento lived up to

Schoofs expectations as the teams played 70
minutes of fast, clean hockey.
Fullbacks Diane Gates and Suzy Schatzman and
goalie Betsy Morris provided heroic defensive efforts
to salvage the tie. The Stanford offense carried the
ball to the opposing goal over a dozen times but
failed to get the ball past Sacramento's goalie.
Schoof said it was "heartbreaking" to be in
possession of the ball so long without putting any
points on the scoreboard.
This week the team has worked especially hard
on shooting and making the forward line more
aggressive in preparation for tomorrow's game.
Schoof hopes Stanford can improve its "timing and
luck" against the Aggies.
