# Chris Not Looking Ahead; Cards Concentrate On OSU
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Much of the talk at yesterday's
Northern California Football
Writer's luncheon concerned USC,
California's opponent this
Saturday at Memorial Stadium.
Trojan publicist Don Anderson
was there, and he even brought a
tape recording of Stanford's
favorite voice — John McKay's.
But Cardinal coach Jack
Christiansen refused to be swayed
by the USC propaganda. Chris
insisted that his mind is on this
week's game against Oregon State,
not Stanford's battle against the
Trojans 10 days from now at the
Los Angeles Coliseum.
"Oregon State is another team
that's hungry for a win," Chris
said of a Beaver unit that has
managed only one victory in seven
outings. "They're playing a lot of
young people and they're
inconsistent, but they have a
hard-hitting defense."
Oregon State was ranked as the
nation's 10th worst team in a poll
appearing in the current issue of
Sports Illustrated, but the "Great
Pumpkin" (OSU coach Dee
Andros) may have some
Halloween tricks in store for the
Cards.
One thing is certain — Beaver
quarterback Alvin White will fill
Parker Stadium with plenty of
passes. White currently leads the
Pacific Eight passing charts with
an average of 162.3 aerial yards
per game, but he has completed
only 41.5 percent of his tosses,
not including the 21 times he's
connected with receivers wearing
wrong-colored jerseys.
The Cardinals, whose
"blocking, running, passing and
emotion finally came together at
the same time against Washington
State," according to Christiansen,
suffered three knee injuries during
the 45-14 victory.
Freshman wide receiver Tony

Hill had both cartilage and
ligament damage repaired in his
left knee Monday at Stanford
Hospital and is out for the season.
Defensive ends Pat Donovan and
Roger Stillwell both incurred knee
injuries of less severity. Donovan,
who played with a twisted knee
suffered during pre-game
warmups, had his knee stiffen up
over the weekend. Christiansen
estimates that Donovan has
"about a 75 percent chance" to

play this weekend.
Stillwell was kicked intheknee
by a Cougar and will probably
have fluid drained sometime this
week. He should be able to play
against Oregon State.

Cardinal Notes: Quarterback
Mike Boryla, who completed 16
of 23 passes for 151 yards and
five touchdowns Saturday,
received two honors Monday for
his record-breaking performance.
Boryla was named Pac-8 offensive
player of the week and also
earned a spot in UPl's national
backfield of the week. Boryla
joins running backs Ben Malone of
Arizona State, John Cappelletti of
Penn State and Northern Illinois'
Mark Kellar in the mythical
backfield. The Pac-8 defensive
award went to Oregon safety
Steve Donnelly.
Christiansen said that there
"are no hard feelings between me
and [Jim] Sweeney — at least on
my part," following their verbal
exchange after Satuday's game.
Sweeney denied several quotes
which Stanford had posted in the
locer room during the week.
USC publicist Don Anderson
thinks that God may have
intervened in Notre Dame's 23-14
victory over the Trojans Saturday
in South Bend. Anderson
hypothesized that the Fighting
Irish victory may have resulted
from heavenly response to posters
on the Notre Dame campus that
read: "Our father who art in
heaven, please keep A.D. from
scoring seven."
Washington State's Cougars
weren't the only people confused
by Stanford's new offensive
formation which moved both
tackles to the strong side. "I
watched a highlight film and
couldn't find my son," said San
Francisco State coach Vic Rowen,
whose son Keith moved from his
left tackle spot to the right side in
the new formation.
Stanford's captains this week
are: Scott Laidlaw (offense), John
Snider (defense), and Eric Test
and Terry Pape (special teams.)

the season to rout the Cougars, 45-14.
