# Pro Prognosis
## Hockey Expansion 
### Charlie Hoffman 
Editor's Note: "Pro Progtiosis" writer Don Tollefson is on
vacation. Substituting this week is Charlie Hoffman, a former Daily
sports editor and editor-in-chief.
America's appetite for professional sports appears endless. Almost
every expansion of pro sports in the late 60s and early 70s has been
gobbled up eagerly by American sports crazies.
There may be one major casualty, however, in this long line of
successes — professional hockey.
In the mid-60s there were only six pro hockey teams. Montreal,
Toronto, New York, Boston, Detroit and Chicago fought for the
prized Stanley Cup each year and even the cellar dwellers played to
full houses. TTie quality of play was superb with as many as five or six
superstars playing together on one team.
Expansion came quickly, however, and from one year to the next,
the National Hockey League doubled in size. The six original teams
were stripped of their depth and some of their top talent. Only one
goalie could be protected from the draft, and top netminders like
Glenn Hall and Gump Worsley were claimed by fledgling teams.
Diluting Talent
The NHL has since been bloated to 16 teams, further diluting the
talent. The World Hockey Association was formed two years ago and
its 14 squads did nothing to help the situation.
Interest in hockey has not spread far and fast enough to support
hockey's expansion and the financial statement of many teams point
this out. The NHL and WHA have become locked in a bidding war
that has increased owners' financial woes. When former Boston Bruin
goalie Garry Cheevers is worth a half a million dollars to the WHA,
things have gotten out of perspective.
The long range outlook for hockey is not that bleak, however.
Hockey leagues for youngsters are blossoming all over the country.
More and more high schools are organizing squads and more attention
is being paid to long established intercollegiate hockey competition.
Stanford Hockey Club
A fine example of hard core hockey interest is right here, where
the fine Stanford hockey club plays a highly competitive schedule
against other Northern California clubs each winter.
The American born professional hockey player now exists, and the
day may come when the U.S. can rival Canada as a source of pro
players.
But for now, pro hockey appears to be strangling its own growth.
The quality of pro play in the mid-60s is still only a memory. Teams
like Montreal and Boston come the closest today to approximating
the excellence that old NHL fans were accustomed to, but it is no fun
to see the Bruins slice up hapless squads like the Los Angeles Kings by
8-0 scores.
Hopefully, the grass roots growth of hockey will be able to catch
up to and support the ever-growing monster of professional hockey.

PRO NOTES: It is sad to see financial practicalities swamp all other
considerations in pro sport, but it has become a necessary evil. The
latest example is the Willie McCovey trade to San Diego. The Giants
found themselves $600,000 in the red last year and owner Horace
Stoneham felt it necessary to get rid of McCovey's $130,000 salary. It
is sad to see McCovey go, but it is even sadder that Stoneham could
only get a mediocre left-handed pitcher in return.
The big money aspect of pro sports has produced a new animal —
the league organizer. Entrepreneur Gary Davidson masterminded the
WHA set-up two years ago, and resigned Monday as president to take
on a new challenge. Davidson is now negotiating the establishment of
the World Football League and sensed a conflict of interest. The new
league will have a short schedule played in April and May with teams
located in London, Madrid, Paris, Munich and other European cities.
Davidson seems content to blithely jump around the globe setting up
whole leagues of pro sports. The appetite seems endless.

PAINFUL GRAB—Freshman Tony Hill caught this pass Saturday
against Washington State, but the ensuing tackle ended Hill's season.
Hill underwent knee surgery Monday at Stanford hospital and is
recovering normally, but will miss the remainder of the 1973 football
campaign.
