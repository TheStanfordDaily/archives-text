# Lyman Denies Trying To Alter Med School Admission Process
## 
### 
President Richard W. Lyman yesterday denied rumors
that he tried to phase students out of the Medical School
admission process earlier this year.
"Graduate admissions are properly an internal affair of
the schools or departments involved," he said on Campus
Conference, a KZSU interview program.
According to Lyman, some Medical School
administrators and students misinterpreted a
memorandum he wrote last spring, believing he wanted to
remove students from admissions committees.
Students have voted on the school's admissions and
minority admissions committees for the past two years.
After complaints from students, Dean Clayton Rich
denied plans to remove students and promised to keep
them on the committees this year.
In a February 6 memorandum on minority student
programs, distributed to 16 top administrators, Lyman
stated his understanding of principles governing
admissions:
"Decisions on admission to Stanford are made by
Stanford faculty or by specifically designated University
officers administering policies established by the faculty.
"Faculty groups charged with making admissions
decision in schools or departments may seek advice
wherever good judgement leads them, either inside or
outside the University.

"They may not, however, delegate or share the power
of decision with students or staff, or with persons outside
the University."
Lyman reiterated this position yesterday, arguing that
"admission is essentially a faculty prerogative." He would
not go beyond that statement to advocate removing
students from the Medical School committees.
However, the president did object to an admissions
procedure "where the sole interview was given by a
student, and where the interview counts for something."
And he supported consolidating the Medical School's
separate minority admissions and admissions committees,
if this procedure would preserve the current affirmative
action program.
Responding to questions about a SWOPSI report on
"The Other Stanford," released yesterday, Lyman
emphasized that he has "pushed fairly hard" in Faculty
Senate debates for "strong, meaningful, clear guidelines"
stressing evaluation of teaching in promotion decisions.
But he cautioned that some methods of teaching "are
not susceptible to quantitative evaluation" — particularly
tutorial and clinical instruction.
And he said reformers should not try to "adjust the
reward system like a piece of machinery" to repair
teaching inadequacies, without considering policy
questions like the number of seminars and the size of
honors programs.
