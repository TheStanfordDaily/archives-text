# 19-Goal Outburst
## Poloists Destroy Hayward 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Stanford's water polo team
enjoyed its biggest offensive
production of the year Monday as
the Cards defeated Cal
State-Hayward, 19-3, at Encina
Pool.
The Cards jumped off to a 5-1
lead over Hayward as the Cardinal
offense passed the ball with
precision. Stanford scored two
goals in the second quarter for a
7-1 halftime advantage and added
five more in the third quarter.
Coach Jim Gaughran then inserted
an all-freshman lineup in the final

period and the frosh responded by
scoring seven goals to round out
the Cardinal attack.
Tom Purcell led the scoring
with six goals, four of them in the
last quarter, and Drew McDonald
scored four times for the Cards.
Dean Anderson added two goals
in the effort and Peter Snyder,
John-Paul Roberts, Glenn Proctor,
Craig Van Zandt, Stan Johnson,
Keith Ortiz and Mike Kamler
added one goal each.
It was apparent that the Card
offense was just too much for
Hayward to handle. The Cards,
troubled all year by a poor passing

attack, seemed to find the key
Monday as they moved the ball
well. Stanford's defense was also
much improved as the Cards
limited Hayward to just three
points, Stanford's best defensive
effort of the year.
The Cards' fast break offense
also seemed to be perceptibly
better in the game. TTie Card
swimmers beat the Hayward
polomen down the pool all
afternoon.
Freshman goalie Chris Dorst
played an outstanding game with
five saves in the effort. Procter
also had five assists.
Stanford's record now stands
at 104-1 overall. The Cards are
0-2 in Pacific Eight play.

Craig Van Zandt, Stan Johnson,
Keith Ortiz and Mike Kamler
added one goal each.
It was apparent that the Card
offense was just too much for
Hayward to handle. The Cards,
troubled all year by a poor passing

attack, seemed to find the key
Monday as they moved the ball
well. Stanford's defense was also
much improved as the Cards
limited Hayward to just three
points, Stanford's best defensive
effort of the year.
The Cards' fast break offense
also seemed to be perceptibly
better in the game. TTie Card
swimmers beat the Hayward
polomen down the pool all
afternoon.
Freshman goalie Chris Dorst
played an outstanding game with
five saves in the effort. Procter
also had five assists.
Stanford's record now stands
at 104-1 overall. The Cards are
0-2 in Pacific Eight play.

Coach Jim Gaughran's quote in
Monday's Daily should have read:
"Joe Ruetz [Stanford Athletic
Director has now gotten into the
act to try to speed things up on
the opening of the new swimming
complex." The word not appeared
instead of now due to a
typographical error.

THE BIG SPLASH—Stanford goalie Tom Cummings couldn't stop this shot against Pacific last week (the
ball slid into the net behind him), but Monday Stanford's water polo attack was near perfect as the Cards
thrashed Cal State-Hayward 19-3 at Encina Pool. Stanford is now 10-4-1 on the season.
