Saxbe Reported As Ally. Gen. Choice
WASHINGTON — Sen. William 0. Saxbe, R-Ohio, was
reported last night to have been chosen by President
Nixon to be nominated for the post of attorney general,
but the senator said he had not yet been offered the job.
Saxbe said that during a White House interview he "got
the impression they were interested and consider me a
likely candidate."
If asked to accept the job, he added, he would take the
offer seriously because "I consider it a challenge to serve
my country."
Key senators said last night they had been notified of
Saxbe's pending appointment to fill the post left vacant
by the resignation of Elliot L. Richardson.
As word of Nixon's reported selection spread, the
White House continued its refusal either to confirm or
deny that the senator was in line for the post.
Saxbe said he conferred Monday with White House
Chief of Staff Alexander M. Haig; Melvin R. Laird, the
President's chief domestic adviser, and with Bryce Harlow,
Nixon's chief liaison man with Capitol Hill.
When he announced earlier this month that he would
not seek re-election, Saxbe said he planned to re-establish
a law firm in Ohio.
Earlier, a spokesman for Saxbe said the senator wants
to discuss Cox's firing before deciding whether to accept
the post.
Cox Tells Possible Leak Guilt
WASHINGTON — Ousted special Watergate prosecutor
Archibald Cox testified yesterday he may have been the
indirect source of a story that President Nixon ordered
the Justice Department not to appeal one phase of the
ITT antitrust case.
The White House, acknowledging Nixon once told
former Atty. Gen. Richard G. Kleindienst not to make the
appeal, said Cox's testimony illustrates "the partisan
attitude that characterized his activities in recent
months."
The story, in yesterday's New York Times, said Nixon
had telephoned Kleindienst and, after calling him a vulgar
name, said, "Don't you understand the English language"
and ordered the appeal stopped.
Deputy Secretary Gerald L. Warren said the President
withdrew his objection to the appeal when it "was
explained in more specific detail." The case subsequently
was settled out-of-court.
Cox told a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing into his
ouster that he had broken a confidence in the ITT matter
and said it was "an error of carelessness" but nonetheless
inexcusable. As for the out-of-court settlement of ITT
case itself, Cox testified he always has thought it was "a
perfectly good bargain from the point of view of the
government."
Kissinger Plans Mideast Visit
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger plans to visit Cairo and other Mideast capitals
early next week in a bid to speed negotiations between
Israel and its Arab foes, officials said last night.
Kissinger plans to go on to China from the Mideast,
after a rest stop in Pakistan. He is scheduled to meet with
Chinese leaders in Peking beginning Nov. 10.
Besides Cairo the secretary of state is likely to visit

Jidda for talks with Saudi-Arabian leaders, and possibly
Amman, Jordan. He will not visit Jerusalem, which
initially had been understood to be part of his itinerarv
The trip surfaced as the pace quickened in three-sided
exploratory talks involving the United States, Egypt and
Israel.
Prime Minister Golda Meir of Israel is due to call on
President Nixon at the White House tomorrow. Ismail
Fahmy, the acting Egyptian foreign minister, has held
talks with Kissinger over two days. And last night Nixon
conferred for two hours at Camp David, Md., with
Kissinger and Soviet ambassador Anatoly F. Dobrynin.
Committee Calls CIA Chiefs 'Dupes'
WASHINGTON — Congress' first official Watergate
report concludes that the CIA and its two top chiefs were
"unwitting dupes" in supplying disguises for such
improper acts as the burglary of Daniel Ellsberg's
psychiatrist's office.
Rep. Lucien N. Nedzi, D-Mich., said "it is a little more
difficult" to assess the ClA's resistance to being used to
cover up the Watergate in the first weeks after the June
17,1972, break-in at Democratic party headquarters.
Nedzi is chairman of the House intelligence
subcommittee which issued the report yesterday.
Nedzi said "I'm personally troubled by the
inconsistencies" in testimony by Vernon A. Walters,
deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency, on
whether he suggested a Cuban rather than CIA
involvement could be used to cover up the break-in.
"But by and large there was resistance on the part of
the CIA to becoming involved," Nedzi said at a news
conference. "There is no objective evidence that there was
a willingness to cooperate."
Kemper Described As Sex Maniac
SANTA CRUZ — Edmund Emil Kemper 111 was
described yesterday by a psychiatrist as a sex maniac with
"a tremendous rage" who knew right from wrong when he
allegedly killed eight women, including his mother.
Dr. Joel Fort of San Francisco said of Kemper, "He
was able to and did have specific intent to kill on all 10
occasions," Fort said, referring to the eight murders
Kemper is charged with and his conviction at the age of
15 for killing his grandparents.
He said Kemper was dominated by "an overwhelming
sex curiosity and obsession with sex best described as a
sex maniac" when he killed six coeds. Fort said Kemper
also was driven by "a tremendous rage, hatred and anger
stemming from childhood experiences that included
getting back at society and his parents."
The witness said Kemper killed the six hitchhiking
students "to have as wide a range of sexual satisfaction as
he could have. He felt inadequate sexually."
Kemper has pleaded innocent by reason of insanity to
charges of killing the six coeds, his mother and her best
friend.

Committee Calls CIA Chiefs 'Dupes'
WASHINGTON — Congress' first official Watergate
report concludes that the CIA and its two top chiefs were
"unwitting dupes" in supplying disguises for such
improper acts as the burglary of Daniel Ellsberg's
psychiatrist's office.
Rep. Lucien N. Nedzi, D-Mich., said "it is a little more
difficult" to assess the ClA's resistance to being used to
cover up the Watergate in the first weeks after the June
17,1972, break-in at Democratic party headquarters.
Nedzi is chairman of the House intelligence
subcommittee which issued the report yesterday.
Nedzi said "I'm personally troubled by the
inconsistencies" in testimony by Vernon A. Walters,
deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency, on
whether he suggested a Cuban rather than CIA
involvement could be used to cover up the break-in.
"But by and large there was resistance on the part of
the CIA to becoming involved," Nedzi said at a news
conference. "There is no objective evidence that there was
a willingness to cooperate."
Kemper Described As Sex Maniac
SANTA CRUZ — Edmund Emil Kemper 111 was
described yesterday by a psychiatrist as a sex maniac with
"a tremendous rage" who knew right from wrong when he
allegedly killed eight women, including his mother.
Dr. Joel Fort of San Francisco said of Kemper, "He
was able to and did have specific intent to kill on all 10
occasions," Fort said, referring to the eight murders
Kemper is charged with and his conviction at the age of
15 for killing his grandparents.
He said Kemper was dominated by "an overwhelming
sex curiosity and obsession with sex best described as a
sex maniac" when he killed six coeds. Fort said Kemper
also was driven by "a tremendous rage, hatred and anger
stemming from childhood experiences that included
getting back at society and his parents."
The witness said Kemper killed the six hitchhiking
students "to have as wide a range of sexual satisfaction as
he could have. He felt inadequate sexually."
Kemper has pleaded innocent by reason of insanity to
charges of killing the six coeds, his mother and her best
friend.
Today's Weather

Saxbe Reported As Ally. Gen. Choice
WASHINGTON — Sen. William 0. Saxbe, R-Ohio, was
reported last night to have been chosen by President
Nixon to be nominated for the post of attorney general,
but the senator said he had not yet been offered the job.
Saxbe said that during a White House interview he "got
the impression they were interested and consider me a
likely candidate."
If asked to accept the job, he added, he would take the
offer seriously because "I consider it a challenge to serve
my country."
Key senators said last night they had been notified of
Saxbe's pending appointment to fill the post left vacant
by the resignation of Elliot L. Richardson.
As word of Nixon's reported selection spread, the
White House continued its refusal either to confirm or
deny that the senator was in line for the post.
Saxbe said he conferred Monday with White House
Chief of Staff Alexander M. Haig; Melvin R. Laird, the
President's chief domestic adviser, and with Bryce Harlow,
Nixon's chief liaison man with Capitol Hill.
When he announced earlier this month that he would
not seek re-election, Saxbe said he planned to re-establish
a law firm in Ohio.
Earlier, a spokesman for Saxbe said the senator wants
to discuss Cox's firing before deciding whether to accept
the post.
Cox Tells Possible Leak Guilt
WASHINGTON — Ousted special Watergate prosecutor
Archibald Cox testified yesterday he may have been the
indirect source of a story that President Nixon ordered
the Justice Department not to appeal one phase of the
ITT antitrust case.
The White House, acknowledging Nixon once told
former Atty. Gen. Richard G. Kleindienst not to make the
appeal, said Cox's testimony illustrates "the partisan
attitude that characterized his activities in recent
months."
The story, in yesterday's New York Times, said Nixon
had telephoned Kleindienst and, after calling him a vulgar
name, said, "Don't you understand the English language"
and ordered the appeal stopped.
Deputy Secretary Gerald L. Warren said the President
withdrew his objection to the appeal when it "was
explained in more specific detail." The case subsequently
was settled out-of-court.
Cox told a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing into his
ouster that he had broken a confidence in the ITT matter
and said it was "an error of carelessness" but nonetheless
inexcusable. As for the out-of-court settlement of ITT
case itself, Cox testified he always has thought it was "a
perfectly good bargain from the point of view of the

described yesterday by a psychiatrist as a sex maniac with
"a tremendous rage" who knew right from wrong when he
allegedly killed eight women, including his mother.
Dr. Joel Fort of San Francisco said of Kemper, "He
was able to and did have specific intent to kill on all 10
occasions," Fort said, referring to the eight murders
Kemper is charged with and his conviction at the age of
15 for killing his grandparents.
He said Kemper was dominated by "an overwhelming
sex curiosity and obsession with sex best described as a
sex maniac" when he killed six coeds. Fort said Kemper
also was driven by "a tremendous rage, hatred and anger
stemming from childhood experiences that included
getting back at society and his parents."
The witness said Kemper killed the six hitchhiking
students "to have as wide a range of sexual satisfaction as
he could have. He felt inadequate sexually."
Kemper has pleaded innocent by reason of insanity to
charges of killing the six coeds, his mother and her best
friend.

Saxbe Reported As Ally. Gen. Choice
WASHINGTON — Sen. William 0. Saxbe, R-Ohio, was
reported last night to have been chosen by President
Nixon to be nominated for the post of attorney general,
but the senator said he had not yet been offered the job.
Saxbe said that during a White House interview he "got
the impression they were interested and consider me a
likely candidate."
If asked to accept the job, he added, he would take the
offer seriously because "I consider it a challenge to serve
my country."
Key senators said last night they had been notified of
Saxbe's pending appointment to fill the post left vacant
by the resignation of Elliot L. Richardson.
As word of Nixon's reported selection spread, the
White House continued its refusal either to confirm or
deny that the senator was in line for the post.
Saxbe said he conferred Monday with White House
Chief of Staff Alexander M. Haig; Melvin R. Laird, the
President's chief domestic adviser, and with Bryce Harlow,
Nixon's chief liaison man with Capitol Hill.
When he announced earlier this month that he would
not seek re-election, Saxbe said he planned to re-establish
a law firm in Ohio.
Earlier, a spokesman for Saxbe said the senator wants
to discuss Cox's firing before deciding whether to accept
the post.
Cox Tells Possible Leak Guilt
WASHINGTON — Ousted special Watergate prosecutor
Archibald Cox testified yesterday he may have been the
indirect source of a story that President Nixon ordered
the Justice Department not to appeal one phase of the
ITT antitrust case.
The White House, acknowledging Nixon once told
former Atty. Gen. Richard G. Kleindienst not to make the
appeal, said Cox's testimony illustrates "the partisan
attitude that characterized his activities in recent
months."
The story, in yesterday's New York Times, said Nixon
had telephoned Kleindienst and, after calling him a vulgar
name, said, "Don't you understand the English language"
and ordered the appeal stopped.
Deputy Secretary Gerald L. Warren said the President
withdrew his objection to the appeal when it "was
explained in more specific detail." The case subsequently
was settled out-of-court.
Cox told a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing into his
ouster that he had broken a confidence in the ITT matter
and said it was "an error of carelessness" but nonetheless
inexcusable. As for the out-of-court settlement of ITT
case itself, Cox testified he always has thought it was "a
perfectly good bargain from the point of view of the
government."
Kissinger Plans Mideast Visit
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger plans to visit Cairo and other Mideast capitals
early next week in a bid to speed negotiations between
Israel and its Arab foes, officials said last night.
Kissinger plans to go on to China from the Mideast,
after a rest stop in Pakistan. He is scheduled to meet with
Chinese leaders in Peking beginning Nov. 10.
Besides Cairo the secretary of state is likely to visit

Jidda for talks with Saudi-Arabian leaders, and possibly
Amman, Jordan. He will not visit Jerusalem, which
initially had been understood to be part of his itinerarv
The trip surfaced as the pace quickened in three-sided
exploratory talks involving the United States, Egypt and
Israel.
Prime Minister Golda Meir of Israel is due to call on
President Nixon at the White House tomorrow. Ismail
Fahmy, the acting Egyptian foreign minister, has held
talks with Kissinger over two days. And last night Nixon
conferred for two hours at Camp David, Md., with
Kissinger and Soviet ambassador Anatoly F. Dobrynin.
Committee Calls CIA Chiefs 'Dupes'
WASHINGTON — Congress' first official Watergate
report concludes that the CIA and its two top chiefs were
"unwitting dupes" in supplying disguises for such
improper acts as the burglary of Daniel Ellsberg's
psychiatrist's office.
Rep. Lucien N. Nedzi, D-Mich., said "it is a little more
difficult" to assess the ClA's resistance to being used to
cover up the Watergate in the first weeks after the June
17,1972, break-in at Democratic party headquarters.
Nedzi is chairman of the House intelligence
subcommittee which issued the report yesterday.
Nedzi said "I'm personally troubled by the
inconsistencies" in testimony by Vernon A. Walters,
deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency, on
whether he suggested a Cuban rather than CIA
involvement could be used to cover up the break-in.
"But by and large there was resistance on the part of
the CIA to becoming involved," Nedzi said at a news
conference. "There is no objective evidence that there was
a willingness to cooperate."
