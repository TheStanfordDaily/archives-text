# Ghost Host Not Impressed With Halloween
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
Tonight is Halloween, a time for
ghoulies and ghosties and children that
ring doorbells in the night, but Bob
Wilkins doesn't care.
"That's my wife's area," he
observes. "I don't like the little devils
around the house."
The odd thing is that Wilkins brings
little devils — and big ones too — into
thousands of Bay Area homes every
Saturday night as the host of KTVU
television's top-rated Creature
Features.
For three and one-half hours each
weekend, Wilkins becomes Lord High
Minister Of All That Is Sinister for
nearly 250,000 horrified fans. For
almost three years he's hosted the
Saturday night double feature horror
movie, which is as much a fixture on
Stanford television sets as the volume
control.
No Horror Fan
But if his callous disregard for
Halloween comes as a bit of a shock,
listen to this: Bob Wilkins doesn't like
horror movies. He's been hosting them
for six years, but it hasn't made any
difference.
"I wasn't a horror fan then [when
he started] and I'm not now," he
calmly explains to aghast listeners. "I
might go see something like West
World (a new "intellectual" science
fiction movit. but I would never.

never go see Blood Orgy of the She
Devils.
"But the real horror fan will go see
it. He has to," the 40-year-old Wilkins
says.
"I interview some of these guys
who make horror films, but they just
take it for granted that I like them.
They don't really care. Then they'll
make some reference to a movie, and
I'll say 'Oh, yeah, I remember that'
and people think I know what I'm
talking about."
But why would anyone who
doesn't like horror movies spend six
years introducing them to late-night
legions of insomniacs?
"I didn't want to do it. . . it just
happened," Wilkins says,
semi-apologetically.
Former Ad Man
"I was working in an advertising
agency in Chicago, but I wanted to
come west. And I stopped to see a
friend in Sacramento," he remembers.
"At a party, someone said one of the
television stations needed a
writer-producer."
Wilkins was fascinated, and
although he had never seen the inside
of a studio before, he managed to land
the job. "After a couple of years, of
being the office wag, the program
director decided that I should have my
own show," he says.
"Television stations buy movies in

packages. They'll get a couple of big
name movies like Ben Hur, and the
company will throw in some horror
movies, or cheap science fiction.
Usually these are shown in marginal
time slots. So my show, Black Arts
Theatre, ran after the 11:30 news
Saturday night. They wanted it to
appeal to a youthful audience.
Frank Reviews
"I took home some of the movies I
was supposed to show, and watched
them. The first one was Attack of the
Mushroom People. I thought, 'My
God, what are we going to tell them
about this movie?' So I told them the
truth,"he explains. "That's still the
Wilkins formula — if a movie stinks, as
so many horror movies do, don't be
afraid to say so.
"It caught on . . . kids really liked
it. They didn't trust anybody over 30
anyway. Pretty soon I began to get
mail from people who thought they
were witches or werewolves and
wanted to be on the show." Wilkins
continued with KCRA for three years,
and then moved to KTVU in Oakland
in January, 1971.
Not Dracula
'There were two schools of
thought here in the station. Some of
the people really wanted a Count
Dracula-type host that would be sort
of a ghoul himself. But I explained I

ARRRGH! — Creature Features host Bob Wilkins taped his Saturday night
television show last night. The featured movie will tell the story of a "horrible
creature, half man, half fish ... Charlie the Tuna." Honest, that's what he said.
couldn't really do that. Then they saw
my tapes, and they liked it,''Wilkins
recounts. He also hosts a Saturday
night horror extravaganza on KTXL in
Sacramento.
"When I started out in Sacramento,
I wasn't as poised as I am now,"
Wilkins admits. "I made some
mistakes, and a lot of people said,
'Why is this guy on TV? Is he the son
of the owner?' They wanted to know
who was I to come on and tell them to
go to bed, that it was a crummy
movie?"
But those objections cleared up
very quickly in Sacramento, and they
never developed in the Bay Area,
where the show was an instant success.
Varied Audience
"We know exactly who watches the
show," Wilkins says. "We even know
how much beer they drink, because
the research is so complete. First there
are children ... three years old and
up. They not only watch the first
movie, but they try to get through the
second.
"I'll go to late night horror movies,
as a promotional thing, and people
bring little children. They know who I
am. So there must be a fair number of
them.
"Then there are the people who
started watching horror movies as kids
and never grew out of it. They range
from high school age to about
sophomore year of college. And then
there are older college students and
professional people, who like to get
away from reality and really like this
stuff.
"In that last group I include all the
real horror buffs. There are a couple of
guys who come down to watch me
tape the show each week. They're real
fans; a couple of them work in movie
theatres so they can see more horror
movies. I got a list of 800 horror films
from a 16-year old kid. He included a
list of the stars and a brief review of
each one. He's seen all of these,"
Wilkins continues.
Wilkins isn't really sure about the
future of Creature Features. "We're
showing some of these movies for the
third time," he observes. "Obviously
that can't go on forever ... But I
think Creature Features will die from
boredom before it dies from the
ratings. I just do it as a hobby."
It's not a bad way to earn a living,
either. "My son [Robby, age 5] talked
to some of his friends, and they said,
'Gee, you're lucky, it must be fun.' So
he came home and asked me some
questions about the show and what I

did," Wilkins says.
"When I was through explaining, he
thought about it for a while, and then
said, 'But what are you going to do

when you grow up?' "
Thousands of Saturday night
television addicts hope that no one
ever has to answer that question.
