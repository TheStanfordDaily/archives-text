# Task Force Report Raps Student-Faculty Relations
## 
### VLAE KERSHNER 
A student task force has issued a
report criticizing "remoteness,
distance, and impersonal relations
between students and faculty" here,
and has suggested several ways to solve
this problem.
The 56-page study, titled "The
Other Stanford," was released
yesterday. In all, 13 persons worked
on the task force, sponsored by the
Stanford Workshop on Political and
Social Issues (SWOPSI).
While 63 percent of 916
undergraduate respondents to the task
force's survey last winter said they
were "satisfied" or "very satisfied"
with intellectual environment at
Stanford and 61 percent liked the
quality of instruction, only 28 and 31
percent, respectively, were satisfied
with student-faculty relations and the
advising system.

The task force attempted to show
there is little academic, social or
personal contact between students and
faculty members.
No Critique
Fifty-nine percent of the
respondents indicated they never had a
faculty member extensively critique a
paper or project and 60 percent said
they had never been challenged to
think by a faculty member on a
one-to-one basis. Only one-third said
that more than two professors had a
significant impact on their intellectual
development.
Only seven percent of the
undergraduates surveyed indicated
they interacted with faculty members
at each of three functions — a meal,
"bull session," and social event.
On a personal basis, only 39
percent of the students "ever felt close
to a faculty member" and only 21
percent ever asked a faculty member
for advice on a personal matter.
At a press conference at Tresidder
yesterday, the editors of the report,
former ASSU vice-president Brent
Appel, Vance Peterson and Jay
Schoenau, graduate students in
education, defended the validity of
their statistical approach.
Good Response
Schoenau said that the response to
the questionnaire was unusually good
(57.3 percent of 1600 mailed), and
that many responses included
written-in remarks calling for more
interaction between students and
faculty members.
Appel noted the "sharp contrast
between levels of satisfaction [in
response to different questions] means
that we think we're headed in the right
direction."
The report, in addition to pointing
out problems, made proposals for
discussion by students, faculty
members and administrators. These
proposals, and specific suggestions for
implementing them, are centered
around four areas.
Recommendations
First, the task force recommends
"an enrichment in the level and
quality of student-faculty
interaction."
Among suggestions the report
makes are that each department
actively support an undergraduate
student association, that papers and
examinations be more extensively
critiqued than at present, and that
teaching assistants be required to have
some training in interaction before
teaching undergraduates.
Second, the task force asks for a
restructuring of the University's
faculty evaluation and reward system.
A purpose of such a change would be
to alter both the types of information
collected on teaching ability, and the
methods by which this information is
gathered.
In addition, the task force asks for
an increase in the influence of
information about teaching ability in
the educational decisions about
faculty appointment, tenure and
promotion, and for a redistribution of
the teaching load so that senior
professors are encouraged to teach
undergraduate seminars.
The third objective calls for "a
redirection of the efforts of the office
of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies" to encourage departments to
offer more independent study and
other courses, to establish a Teaching

Resources Center, and to become
more involved in departmental
decision making, among other
suggestions.
Awareness Of Benefits
Finally, the study calls for "a
greater awareness by undergraduates
of the benefits of interaction with
faculty members, and of the necessity
to participate in the initiation of it."
One specific recommendation in
this area calls for the ASSU to
continue to support and, if possible,
expand a student-run course review.
The editors of the report say they
intend to follow up on their work in
meetings with Dean of Undergraduate
Studies James Gibbs, University
President Richard Lyman, the ASSU
Council of Presidents and other
officials.
Specifically, the editors urge
Lyman "to convene an ad hoc
committee to consider these
proposals."

quality of instruction, only 28 and 31
percent, respectively, were satisfied
with student-faculty relations and the
advising system.

The task force attempted to show
there is little academic, social or
personal contact between students and
faculty members.
No Critique
Fifty-nine percent of the
respondents indicated they never had a
faculty member extensively critique a
paper or project and 60 percent said
they had never been challenged to
think by a faculty member on a
one-to-one basis. Only one-third said
that more than two professors had a
significant impact on their intellectual
development.
Only seven percent of the
undergraduates surveyed indicated
they interacted with faculty members
at each of three functions — a meal,
"bull session," and social event.
On a personal basis, only 39
percent of the students "ever felt close
to a faculty member" and only 21
percent ever asked a faculty member
for advice on a personal matter.
At a press conference at Tresidder
yesterday, the editors of the report,
former ASSU vice-president Brent
Appel, Vance Peterson and Jay
Schoenau, graduate students in
education, defended the validity of
their statistical approach.
Good Response
Schoenau said that the response to
the questionnaire was unusually good
(57.3 percent of 1600 mailed), and
that many responses included
written-in remarks calling for more
interaction between students and
faculty members.
Appel noted the "sharp contrast
between levels of satisfaction [in
response to different questions] means
that we think we're headed in the right
direction."
The report, in addition to pointing
out problems, made proposals for
discussion by students, faculty
members and administrators. These
proposals, and specific suggestions for
implementing them, are centered
around four areas.
Recommendations
First, the task force recommends
"an enrichment in the level and
quality of student-faculty
interaction."
Among suggestions the report
makes are that each department
actively support an undergraduate
student association, that papers and
examinations be more extensively
critiqued than at present, and that
teaching assistants be required to have
some training in interaction before
teaching undergraduates.
Second, the task force asks for a
restructuring of the University's
faculty evaluation and reward system.
A purpose of such a change would be
to alter both the types of information
collected on teaching ability, and the
methods by which this information is
gathered.
In addition, the task force asks for
an increase in the influence of
information about teaching ability in
the educational decisions about
faculty appointment, tenure and
promotion, and for a redistribution of
the teaching load so that senior
professors are encouraged to teach
undergraduate seminars.
The third objective calls for "a
redirection of the efforts of the office
of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies" to encourage departments to
offer more independent study and
other courses, to establish a Teaching

Resources Center, and to become
more involved in departmental
decision making, among other
suggestions.
Awareness Of Benefits
Finally, the study calls for "a
greater awareness by undergraduates
of the benefits of interaction with
faculty members, and of the necessity
to participate in the initiation of it."
One specific recommendation in
this area calls for the ASSU to
continue to support and, if possible,
expand a student-run course review.
The editors of the report say they
intend to follow up on their work in
meetings with Dean of Undergraduate
Studies James Gibbs, University
President Richard Lyman, the ASSU
Council of Presidents and other
officials.
Specifically, the editors urge
Lyman "to convene an ad hoc
committee to consider these
proposals."

TASK FORCE — Jay Schoenau, Vance Peterson, and Brent Appel, editors of
"The Other Stanford," a report which criticized student-faculty relations,
defended the validity of their statistical approach at a press conference
yesterday.
A student task force has issued a
report criticizing "remoteness,
distance, and impersonal relations
between students and faculty" here,
and has suggested several ways to solve
this problem.
The 56-page study, titled "The
Other Stanford," was released
yesterday. In all, 13 persons worked
on the task force, sponsored by the
Stanford Workshop on Political and
Social Issues (SWOPSI).
While 63 percent of 916
undergraduate respondents to the task
force's survey last winter said they
were "satisfied" or "very satisfied"
with intellectual environment at
Stanford and 61 percent liked the
quality of instruction, only 28 and 31
