# Politicians Become White Knights
## Americans Worship Dubious Heroes 
### 
James Lobsenz

By thrusting forward a "man
of the hour," melodramatic events
occurring on the American
political scene, such as the Tapes
Crisis, provide wonderful
opportunities for Americans to
rally round the flag of some
new-found hero with all the
emotional fervor of a
newly-converted Zealot. The men
around whom they rally, these
paragons of integrity, are depicted
by the worshippers as classic
"good guys" in the truest
Hollywood Western sense of the
phrase.
The tendency of the American
public to cloak such individuals,
vaulted into headlines by
unsuspected political upheavals, in
robes of righteousness, must be
considered as a tragic triumph for
emotional irrationalism.
All too often it is forgotten
that Senator Sam is a
characteristic Southern Democrat
when it comes to matters of civil
rights legislation. It was Ervin who
told the then Attorney General
Robert F. Kennedy that he "loved
the Constitution too much" to
enfranchise black voters at the
expense of limiting "states'
rights."
Last Friday a news article in the
Daily depicted another example
of the public's inclination towards
hero-worship. Former Deputy
Attorney General William
Ruckelshaus, speaking in Berkeley
last Thursday, was given a
standing ovation from a crowd of
14,000, according to the Daily
report. Ruckelshaus, apparently
disturbed by the warmth of his
reception, responded to the
crowd's welcome with the
assertion, "I am not a hero."
Moments later he defined himself
rather as "a Republican."
(Presumably he did not intend to
insinuate that the two were
mutually exclusive terms.)
Political Worship
The other former Justice
Department "man of the hour,"
former Attorney General Elliot
Richardson, has also been basking,
again somewhat uncomfortably,

in the sunshine of public political
worship.
Currently Richardson is lauded
for his non-partisan pursuit of
justice. Regrettably, he has not
always trod this path in the past.
On May 4th of this year
Alexander M. Haig, Jr. was
appointed by President Nixon to
the post from which H.R.
Haldeman had recently fallen,
Presidential Chief of Staff. At the
time of his appointment Haig was
also Vice Chief of Staff of the
U.S. Army and a four star general.
Violation
This fact raised the eyebrows
of Representative John Moss
(D—Calif.) and Senator Stuart
Symington (D—Mo.). Both these
men noted that such an
appointment clearly violated Title
10 Section 973(b) of the U.S.
Code which provides that:
"Except as otherwise provided
for by law, no officer on the
active duty list of the regular
Army, regular Air Force, regular
Navy ... may hold a civil office
by appointment or election... .
The acceptance of such a civil
office or the exercise of its
functions by such an officer
terminates his military
appointment."
A little research into the
history of this law reveals that it is
a recodification of a law that has
been on the books since an Act of
March 30, 1868.
Choice Required
After conferring with
Comptroller General and head of
the G.A.O. Elmer Staats, Moss
wrote Attorney General
Richardson, and informed him
that Haig's appointment violated
federal law. Moss requested that
Richardson require Haig to choose
quickly between a civilian or
military career. Thus, Moss merely
requested that Richardson do his
job: enforce the law.
Unfortunately, Richardson
chose to pursue a more partisan
course. He answered Moss's letter,
15 days later, yet his answer
evaded all substantive issues and

stated that in his opinion, the
facts "so far as available" did not
establish a violation of the law.
Moss wrote Richardson a
second time, and received, this
time after a nine day lapse, a
second evasive reply on July 18.
But in the interim, on the
14th, after some dexterous
maneuvering, anominationof Haig
to the formal retired list (required
of all generals above a two star
rank) was slipped past an
unprepared Senate Arms Services
Committee. It was then approved
by unanimous consent of the
Senate with the aid of some fancy
footwork on the part of Senate
Republican leaders.
Civilian Life
Thus, thanks to some foot
dragging by Richardson, who is
presently heralded as a crusader
for justice, Haig snaked his way
past the Senate into civilian life,
and consequently placed himself
properly within the confines of
Title 10 of the U.S. Code.
Nevertheless, Haig had violated
the law, although he violated it no
longer. Several members of
Congress, as well as various
other interested parties, asked
Richardson to rectify the
situation "posthumously."
Fearing that the Haig incident
would set a legal precedent,
official requests were made of
Richardson, asking that he
publically declare that the
appointment had been made in
violation of federal law.
This would not have affected
Haig's position, nor would it have
exposed Haig to any civil penalty.
It merely would have been
embarrassing to the President.
Richardson never made such a
declaration.
Recognition
For his performance,
Richardson has earned himself the
recognition of Franklin Silbey,
former press aide to Senator
Montoya. Writing for Nation
magazine, Silbey found that "the
thorough ignoble and
intellectually dishonest role

played ... by the so-called 'Mr.
Clean' of the administration,
Attorney General Richardson"
dominated the Haig affair. Such
an evaluation of Richardson
clashed markedly with the current
shower of praise accorded him.
The clear contrast between the
Richardson performance in the
Haig Drama and his succeeding
role in the Tapes Tango should
demonstrate the necessity for
abandoning the hero worship
attitudes that prevail today. There
simply are no knights in shining
armor in American politics.
