# Serious Intent Requires Effort
## Build Coalition To Impeach 
### 
Larry Diamond

(This is the conclusion of a two-part series
continued from yesterday.)
A serious move to impeach the President is
unlikely even to reach the floor of the House unless
liberals stop talking to themselves in their saintly
and self-gratifying tones and start building a
coalition that can line up the support of crucial
moderate leaders in the House and the crucial
moderate mass.
Liberals — particularly the intellectual elite —
don't do this well. Their failure to build an
effectively broad coalition allowed the Vietnam War
to go on for ten years. Their particularly
self-righteous refusal to do so in 1972 ruined George
McGovern's campaign for the Presidency.
Professor Mike Kirst has spent enough time
working in the White House and on Capitol Hill to
be convinced of the absolute necessity of coalitions
for achieving major legislative goals. Any serious
move for impeachment, he believes, would have to
have behind it the kind of coalition that pushed
through the 1964 Civil Rights Act — including
lobbyists from organizations like the AFL-CIO,
ADA, the Urban Coalition, the National Council of
Churches, and perhaps the National Conference of
Mayors and the National League of Cities.
In this case, support from the National Bar
Association and the various state bar associations
would be especially important. And progressive
bi-partisan organizations like Common Cause and
the National Committee for an Effective Congress
might also be crucial.
Common Strategy
These various interest groups, Kirst suggests,
would have to sit down and map out a common
strategy. Lobbyists from certain of these
organizations would know most about, or be most
effective with, certain of the marginal congressmen.
And so the lobbyists from each group would be
assigned to various congressman accordingly.
Community leaders and interest groups with
particular influence in the home districts of these
marginal congressmen would have to be mobilized
to exert pressure on them. Individuals from their
home town who they know and respect would have
to be among those appealing for a vote for
impeachment.
The lobbyists for these great national interest
groups know who these individuals and groups are
in each district. The impact of their collective

resources effectively coordinated could be
enormous. The AFL-CIO alone, whose Executive
Board has already voted unanimously in favor of
impeachment, could change a lot of moderate
Democratic votes in an all-out lobbying effort.
Locate the Majority
Liberals often make the mistake of assuming that
it is in major urban centers and university
communities that the great issues are decided. This
is a grave tactical error. Whether Richard Nixon is
impeached and convicted and removed from office
will not finally be decided by constituencies in San
Francisco and Stanford, but rather by those in
places like Dayton, Ohio, Wichita, Kansas, Oelwein,
lowa and Santa Rosa, California. Academic
communities can help build and mobilize a
majority, but we are not it.
Richard Nixon is a dangerously intransigent man.
But he is shrewd enough to make a deal, or pull
every lever that Presidential privilege will allow,
when his back is against the wall. He will not go
down without a fierce and complicated political
battle.
Still, he has violated the law, and perhaps even
worse, he has violated the confidence of the people,
and, if the polls are to be believed, that point is
becoming as irrevocably clear in Oklahoma City as it
is at Stanford.
Wide Spectrum
People of all political shades in America are
through with this man. They don't trust him and
they don't want him for their President. No less
solid and loyal a Republican than Senator William
Saxbe said as much last weekend.
If liberals will for once swallow some of their
lofty pride and sit down and deal with different
groups on the political spectrum, if they will focus
on this one issue and build a coalition around it
specifically, trading in their righteous rhetoric for
some hard, detailed, tactical plans and some
lobbyists and researchers and headquarters and
phones, they might actually succeed.
The lines are rather starkly drawn. We need 20
votes in the House Judiciary Committee, 218 votes
on the House floor, and 67 votes on the floor of the
Senate. If we can get them, we will, painfully but
finally, be rid of this nightmare and able to move on
with the business of actually governing this very
troubled land.

Richard Nixon is a dangerously intransigent man.
But he is shrewd enough to make a deal, or pull
every lever that Presidential privilege will allow,
when his back is against the wall. He will not go
down without a fierce and complicated political
battle.
Still, he has violated the law, and perhaps even
worse, he has violated the confidence of the people,
and, if the polls are to be believed, that point is
becoming as irrevocably clear in Oklahoma City as it
is at Stanford.
Wide Spectrum
People of all political shades in America are
through with this man. They don't trust him and
they don't want him for their President. No less
solid and loyal a Republican than Senator William
Saxbe said as much last weekend.
If liberals will for once swallow some of their
lofty pride and sit down and deal with different
groups on the political spectrum, if they will focus
on this one issue and build a coalition around it
specifically, trading in their righteous rhetoric for
some hard, detailed, tactical plans and some
lobbyists and researchers and headquarters and
phones, they might actually succeed.
The lines are rather starkly drawn. We need 20
votes in the House Judiciary Committee, 218 votes
on the House floor, and 67 votes on the floor of the
Senate. If we can get them, we will, painfully but
finally, be rid of this nightmare and able to move on
with the business of actually governing this very
troubled land.

A serious move to impeach the President is
unlikely even to reach the floor of the House unless
liberals stop talking to themselves in their saintly
and self-gratifying tones and start building a
coalition that can line up the support of crucial
moderate leaders in the House and the crucial
moderate mass.
Liberals — particularly the intellectual elite —
don't do this well. Their failure to build an
effectively broad coalition allowed the Vietnam War
to go on for ten years. Their particularly
self-righteous refusal to do so in 1972 ruined George
McGovern's campaign for the Presidency.
Professor Mike Kirst has spent enough time
working in the White House and on Capitol Hill to
be convinced of the absolute necessity of coalitions
for achieving major legislative goals. Any serious
move for impeachment, he believes, would have to
have behind it the kind of coalition that pushed
through the 1964 Civil Rights Act — including
lobbyists from organizations like the AFL-CIO,
ADA, the Urban Coalition, the National Council of
Churches, and perhaps the National Conference of
Mayors and the National League of Cities.
In this case, support from the National Bar
Association and the various state bar associations
would be especially important. And progressive
bi-partisan organizations like Common Cause and
the National Committee for an Effective Congress
might also be crucial.
Common Strategy
These various interest groups, Kirst suggests,
would have to sit down and map out a common
strategy. Lobbyists from certain of these
organizations would know most about, or be most
effective with, certain of the marginal congressmen.
And so the lobbyists from each group would be
assigned to various congressman accordingly.
Community leaders and interest groups with
particular influence in the home districts of these
marginal congressmen would have to be mobilized
to exert pressure on them. Individuals from their
home town who they know and respect would have
to be among those appealing for a vote for
impeachment.
The lobbyists for these great national interest
groups know who these individuals and groups are
in each district. The impact of their collective

resources effectively coordinated could be
enormous. The AFL-CIO alone, whose Executive
Board has already voted unanimously in favor of
impeachment, could change a lot of moderate
Democratic votes in an all-out lobbying effort.
Locate the Majority
Liberals often make the mistake of assuming that
it is in major urban centers and university
communities that the great issues are decided. This
is a grave tactical error. Whether Richard Nixon is
impeached and convicted and removed from office
will not finally be decided by constituencies in San
Francisco and Stanford, but rather by those in
places like Dayton, Ohio, Wichita, Kansas, Oelwein,
lowa and Santa Rosa, California. Academic
communities can help build and mobilize a
majority, but we are not it.
