# Nixon's Lawyers Deny Existence Of Important White House Tapes
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Two of the
White House tapes never existed,
President Nixon's lawyers said
yesterday.
The White House said Nixon had
been unaware of that situation until
last weekend.
Missing are recordings of what
former Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell
told Nixon in their first reported
conversation following the Watergate
break-in and of what passed between
Nixon and John W. Dean 111 in a
meeting in which Dean says Nixon
admitted discussing clemency as part
of the Watergate cover-up.
The Mitchell conversation of June
20, 1972 took place on a telephone
without a recording device attached,

and the Dean meeting of April 15,
1973 wasn't recorded due to an
extremely rare malfunction of the
automatic recording gear in the
presidential offices, Nixon's lawyers
told U.S. District Court Judge John J.
Sirica.
Deputy White House Press
Secretary Gerald L. Warren said that in
the months of controversy over the
Watergate tapes Nixon never asked to
listen personally to the two
nonexistent tapes.
April Conversations
Warren said extensive conversations
and discussions in Nixon's office on
April 14 and 15 — prior to the Dean
meeting — had been recorded. But, he
said, "when this conversation took

place the first recorder had run out,
filled up, and the alternate recorder
was not activated until the next day,
the 16th."
Warren said, "we've never said —
he's never said — he listened to all the
tapes."
The presidential spokesman had
reported several months ago that
Nixon listened to a number of tapes
on June 4.
Tapes Stored
Warren said the tapes had been
stored in the White House "under lock
and key."
In court, White House lawyer J.
Fred Buzhardt told Sirica of the
missing tapes in a private session
Tuesday, and Sirica broached the

matter in open court yesterday.
It was the first time the White
House had said any of the
controversial tape recordings don't
exist.
The two missing recordings are
among nine tapes which had been
sought by federal prosecutors and
which Nixon had agreed to turn over
to Sirica in accordance with an order
from the federal appeals court in
Washington.
Sirica heard open-court testimony
yesterday from a Secret Service
technician who said the White House
records had been checked daily on
weekdays, and that the April 15
malfunction was the only recorder
failure he knew of.
He said hidden microphones in
presidential offices had bten
extremely sensitive, capable of picking
up all but whispered conversations.
Technician Testifies
The technician, Raymond C.
Zumwalt, said he knew of no other
instance in which the automatic
machines had failed to record. He said
he hadn't remembered the April 15
malfunction until Buzhardt reminded
him of it.
Federal prosecutors said Zumwalt
told them earlier yesterday that he
couldn't recall any malfunctions at all.
Archibald Cox, whom Nixon fired
as special Watergate prosecutor after
Cox spurned an out-of-court
settlement on the tapes, said yesterday
that the White House never told him
any of the taDes might not exist.
Cox had sought a total of nine
recordings and associated documents.
"My recollection is Buzhardt
assured me they were in a safe place
and properly guarded," Cox said at
hearings before the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
Cox said he heard of possible
technical problems in the April 15
tape only a day or so before he was
fired.

tape only a day or so before he was
fired.
WASHINGTON (AP) - Two of the
White House tapes never existed,
President Nixon's lawyers said
yesterday.
The White House said Nixon had
been unaware of that situation until
last weekend.
Missing are recordings of what
former Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell
told Nixon in their first reported
conversation following the Watergate
break-in and of what passed between
Nixon and John W. Dean 111 in a
meeting in which Dean says Nixon
admitted discussing clemency as part
of the Watergate cover-up.
The Mitchell conversation of June
20, 1972 took place on a telephone
without a recording device attached,

and the Dean meeting of April 15,
1973 wasn't recorded due to an
extremely rare malfunction of the
automatic recording gear in the
presidential offices, Nixon's lawyers
told U.S. District Court Judge John J.
Sirica.
Deputy White House Press
Secretary Gerald L. Warren said that in
the months of controversy over the
Watergate tapes Nixon never asked to
listen personally to the two
nonexistent tapes.
April Conversations
Warren said extensive conversations
and discussions in Nixon's office on
April 14 and 15 — prior to the Dean
meeting — had been recorded. But, he
said, "when this conversation took

place the first recorder had run out,
filled up, and the alternate recorder
was not activated until the next day,
the 16th."
Warren said, "we've never said —
he's never said — he listened to all the
tapes."
The presidential spokesman had
reported several months ago that
Nixon listened to a number of tapes
on June 4.
Tapes Stored
Warren said the tapes had been
stored in the White House "under lock
and key."
In court, White House lawyer J.
Fred Buzhardt told Sirica of the
missing tapes in a private session
Tuesday, and Sirica broached the

matter in open court yesterday.
It was the first time the White
House had said any of the
controversial tape recordings don't
exist.
The two missing recordings are
among nine tapes which had been
sought by federal prosecutors and
which Nixon had agreed to turn over
to Sirica in accordance with an order
from the federal appeals court in
Washington.
Sirica heard open-court testimony
yesterday from a Secret Service
technician who said the White House
records had been checked daily on
weekdays, and that the April 15
malfunction was the only recorder
failure he knew of.
He said hidden microphones in
presidential offices had bten
extremely sensitive, capable of picking
up all but whispered conversations.
Technician Testifies
The technician, Raymond C.
Zumwalt, said he knew of no other
instance in which the automatic
machines had failed to record. He said
he hadn't remembered the April 15
malfunction until Buzhardt reminded
him of it.
Federal prosecutors said Zumwalt
told them earlier yesterday that he
couldn't recall any malfunctions at all.
Archibald Cox, whom Nixon fired
as special Watergate prosecutor after
Cox spurned an out-of-court
settlement on the tapes, said yesterday
that the White House never told him
any of the taDes might not exist.
Cox had sought a total of nine
recordings and associated documents.
"My recollection is Buzhardt
assured me they were in a safe place
and properly guarded," Cox said at
hearings before the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
Cox said he heard of possible
technical problems in the April 15
tape only a day or so before he was
fired.
