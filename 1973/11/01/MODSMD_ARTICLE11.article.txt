# Libertarian Outlook
## Right To Commit Suicide Vindicated 
### 
Bill Evers

This fall the board of directors
of the Golden Gate Bridge has
announced that as a matter of
policy it will move to build a $1
million suicide prevention barrier
on the bridge.
This policy move is the
culmination of a campaign that
has been waged for many years in
San Francisco by people who
want to make it very difficult if
not impossible to commit suicide
by jumping off the Golden Gate
Bridge.
On one side, favoring
preventing and prohibiting
suicides are some politicians (like
city supervisor Peter Tamares),
religious leaders, psychologists,
and psychiatrists.
On the other side, arguing that
a person should have the choice of
committing suicide and that the
government should not put
barriers in his way are some civil
libertarians.
When one gets down to
fundamentals, the suicide

prohibitionists are contending
that a person does not own his
own body. Instead, they say God
owns it, or the government
(sometimes described as
"society") owns it. In the U.S.
military, a soldier can be
court-martialed for attempting
suicide â€” for destruction of
government property.
Theologically, some argue that
men are not the rightful
proprietors of their own bodies,
that as mere mortals they are only
stewards of their corporeal shells
by the grace of God.
But those on earth who claim
that they are spokesmen for God's
revelations on public policy are in
disagreement with one another,
and none can advance convincing
evidence that his position and his
alone is God's.
God's Will
Secondly, claiming that God's
rights are involved means in
practice a political
implementation by the

government of God's will. We are
thus in substance considering the
subsequent question of whether
the government owns a person's
body.
In another sense, if there is a
God who has created the universe
and the general and immutable
laws which govern it, then the
different specific natures given to
entities (be they humans or rocks)
are His creation.
We are thus driven by logic to
consider the nature of man and
the laws natural and proper to his
existence as a rational and social
animal.
Man Has Free Wih
By considering man's nature as
a free-willed, choice-making
creature, we can establish the
philosophical case for a legal right
to commit suicide. This case stems
from the general principle that in
order to be in a position to make
the choices that would constitute
a good and moral life, a person
must be legally free to act as he
wills with his own. This rules out
initiating any attacks on one's
neighbor, and it rules out
government ownership of citizens'
bodies. It certainly would leave
one in a position where chosing to
kill oneself is legally one's right.
As British philosopher
Anthony Flew puts it,"It is
precisely because suicide is the
destruction of oneself (by one's
own choice), while murder is the
destruction of somebody else
(against his wishes), that the
former can be, and is,
distinguished from the latter."
At this point, we must consider
the argument of many
psychologists that people who
wish to commit suicide should be
prevented from doing so and then
committed against their will to
mental institutions. These
psychologists also argue that
technology that can be used to
commit suicide somehow creates
the' choice to commit suicide.
They are saying that the Golden
Gate Bridge or privately-owned
firearms cause suicide.
Szasz Defends Civil Liberties
The civil liberties case against
these psychologists and others
who wish to prohibit suicide has
been stated best by Dr. Thomas

Szasz, professor of psychiatry at
the State University of New
York's medical center in Syracuse.
Dr. Szasz writes in the August
16 issue of The Listener: "[The
suicidal person] may look upon
his own suicidal inclination as an
undesired, almost alien impulse
and seek help to resist it.
"If so, the ensuing arrangement
between him and his psychiatrist
is readily assimilated to the
standard medical model of
treatment: the patient seeks help
and co-operates with the
physician to remedy his
condition.. . .
Suicide Prevention Came
"But this is not the only way,
nor, in fact, the most important
way the game of suicide
prevention is played. It is
accepted medical and psychiatric
practice to treat persons for their
suicidal desires or 'impulses'
against their will.. ..
"Preventing suicide requires a
political act on the person. In
other words, since suicide is an
exercise and an expression of
human freedom, it can only be
prevented by curtailing human
freedom....
"In the final analysis, the
would-be suicide is like the
would-be emigrant: both want to
leave where they are and move
elsewhere. The suicide wants to
leave life and embrace death; the
emigrant wants to leave his
homeland and settle in another
country....
"The medical profession's
stance toward suicide is thus like
the Communists' toward
emigration: the doctors insist that
the would-be suicide survive, just
as the Russians insist that the
would-be emigrant stay home.
"It hardly matters whether
those who so curtail other
people's liberties act with
complete sincerity or with utter
cynicism. What matters is what
happens: the abridgment of
individual liberty, justified, in the
case of suicide prevention, by
psychiatric rhetoric; and in the
case of emigration prevention, by
political rhetoric."
