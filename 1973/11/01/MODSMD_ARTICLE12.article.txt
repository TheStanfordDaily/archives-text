Admissions Policy
Editor:
Mr. McManus' article [Daily,
Oct. 23, 1973J on the recent
report on "Freshman Admissions
and Financial Aid at Stanford,
1972-73," while faithfully
reporting some of the report's
contents, permits the implication
that there may exist some
antagonism between the Office of
Undergraduate Admissions and
the Academic Planning Office.
That implication is quite wide of
the mark. Our two offices
cooperated extensively in the
preparation and review of the
report. We agreed at the beginning
as we do now that policies and
practices must be seen in the light
of their consequences, and careful
research is one of the best ways to
develop systematic evidence about
consequences.
The admissions process is
enormously complicated, and it
should be. There is no simple way
for persons and institutions to
reach decisions about each other
which significantly affect their
lives. In reviewing applicants, Mr.
Hargadon and his colleagues take
thoughtful account of a great
many factors. Writing a report
about the results of this
complicated and intelligently
executed process is also an
exacting job. Needless to say, a
reporter who seeks not only to
probe but to amplify such a
complicated tapestry of facts has
taken on a formidable task.
In the two places where
individuals are quoted, some
confusion intruded itself into the
article. The apparent numerical
disagreement regarding Black
applicants came from different
people referring to different years.
There is no disagreement on the
number of applications,
admissions, and enrollments.
Regarding the question of what
counts as an application, the
following clarification is in order.
An application is considered as
officially filed only after the
appropriate form is received and
the fee is either paid or formally
waived. An application is
"actionable" when all the
supporting materials (references,
grades, etc.) are in hand. The
University's Admissions Office is
scrupulous about counting an
application as filed only when the
initial form and fee transaction is
complete; when admissions are
counted as a percent of this group
— which is the usual comparison
figure used among colleges and
universities — Stanford's 1972-73
number is 27.6 percent. The APO
research deals only with those
students who went the whole
distance, developing a full file on
which the Dean can act; the
percent admitted from that group
in 1972-73 was 31.7 percent.

Kudos to Ralston
Editor:
John Ralston has done it again
— he is making believers out of a
team that used to be the patsies of
professional football. A similar
feat that was evidenced while he
was at Stanford.
Ralston has made Denver, not
only a winning team (take away
last minute field goals by 3
opposing teams — Kansas City,
Oakland, and San Francisco — and
Denver would be leading the
division with a 5-1 record); but
also quite possibly the most
exciting team in professional
football. The offense pulls the
trick and razzle-dazzle plays when
needed — ever so characteristic of
the Stanford Rose Bowl years.
The defense clasps hands in the
huddle signifying unity — a past
Ralston defense also signified
unity by an ominous nickname.
And most important the Broncos
appear to enjoy playing football.
Take the Monday night
football game — Oakland vs.
Denver — for the first time this
year one was entertained watching
the game, rather than listening (?)
to the "Dandy Trio." Denver
showed more emotional
exuberance in the 23-23 tie game
than most teams show after a
"must" victory.
What is behind this "rah-rah"
team? A coach who realizes
emotion plays an important part
of the game; a coach who has the
guts to risk being laughed out of
the league for his own boyish
rah-rah actions; a coach who has a
little imagination, who takes
gambles in key situations; a coach
who has made believers out of the
Denver Broncos — A coach who
had made believers out of
Stanford football.

feat that was evidenced while he
was at Stanford.
Ralston has made Denver, not
only a winning team (take away
last minute field goals by 3
opposing teams — Kansas City,
Oakland, and San Francisco — and
Denver would be leading the
division with a 5-1 record); but
also quite possibly the most
exciting team in professional
football. The offense pulls the
trick and razzle-dazzle plays when
needed — ever so characteristic of
the Stanford Rose Bowl years.
The defense clasps hands in the
huddle signifying unity — a past
Ralston defense also signified
unity by an ominous nickname.
And most important the Broncos
appear to enjoy playing football.
Take the Monday night
football game — Oakland vs.
Denver — for the first time this
year one was entertained watching
the game, rather than listening (?)
to the "Dandy Trio." Denver
showed more emotional
exuberance in the 23-23 tie game
than most teams show after a
"must" victory.
What is behind this "rah-rah"
team? A coach who realizes
emotion plays an important part
of the game; a coach who has the
guts to risk being laughed out of
the league for his own boyish
rah-rah actions; a coach who has a
little imagination, who takes
gambles in key situations; a coach
who has made believers out of the
Denver Broncos — A coach who

Mr. McManus' article [Daily,
Oct. 23, 1973J on the recent
report on "Freshman Admissions
and Financial Aid at Stanford,
1972-73," while faithfully
reporting some of the report's
contents, permits the implication
that there may exist some
antagonism between the Office of
Undergraduate Admissions and
the Academic Planning Office.
That implication is quite wide of
the mark. Our two offices
cooperated extensively in the
preparation and review of the
report. We agreed at the beginning
as we do now that policies and
practices must be seen in the light
of their consequences, and careful
research is one of the best ways to
develop systematic evidence about
consequences.
The admissions process is
enormously complicated, and it
should be. There is no simple way
for persons and institutions to
reach decisions about each other
which significantly affect their
lives. In reviewing applicants, Mr.
Hargadon and his colleagues take
thoughtful account of a great
many factors. Writing a report
about the results of this
complicated and intelligently
executed process is also an
exacting job. Needless to say, a
reporter who seeks not only to
probe but to amplify such a
complicated tapestry of facts has
taken on a formidable task.
In the two places where
individuals are quoted, some
confusion intruded itself into the
article. The apparent numerical
disagreement regarding Black
applicants came from different
people referring to different years.
There is no disagreement on the
number of applications,
admissions, and enrollments.
Regarding the question of what
counts as an application, the
following clarification is in order.
An application is considered as
officially filed only after the
appropriate form is received and
the fee is either paid or formally
waived. An application is
"actionable" when all the
supporting materials (references,
grades, etc.) are in hand. The
University's Admissions Office is
scrupulous about counting an
application as filed only when the
initial form and fee transaction is
complete; when admissions are
counted as a percent of this group
— which is the usual comparison
figure used among colleges and
universities — Stanford's 1972-73
number is 27.6 percent. The APO
research deals only with those
students who went the whole
distance, developing a full file on
which the Dean can act; the
percent admitted from that group
in 1972-73 was 31.7 percent.
