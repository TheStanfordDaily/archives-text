# Doctors Win Legal Ruling
## 
### SUE LUTTNER 
After a three-year legal battle,
three Medical Center doctors have
won a ruling against the Veterans
Administration policy of requiring
political information from all
medical employees.
Although the specific case
involved Palo Alto Veterans'
Hospital, the decision affects all
interns and residents at 'VA
hospitals throughout the country,
said Dr. Howard Waitzkin.
Waitzkin, Peter Cummings and
Peter Rudd, initiated proceedings
in 1970 and again in 1972,
objecting on First Amendment
grounds to a questionnaire which
asked potential employees about
membership in the Communist
Party or in other political
organizations.
Last week the federal Ninth
Circuit Court of Appeals ruled
that "such minimal interest as the
government may have concerning
these physicians' beliefs and
associations must be balanced
against the intrusion upon First
Amendment rights engenered by
the inquiries."
Nine-Year Hassle
This decision follows at least
nine years of legal hassles by other
medical workers. In 1964 Dr. June
Fisher, now a physician at a clinic
in East Palo Alto, worked at the
Palo Alto VA hospital without
pay during her Stanford residency
when she refused to answer these
questions.
Since then, eight other doctors
have either worked without pay
or forfeited experience at the VA
hospital rather than answer the
questionnaire.
Most of the legal precedents
for the case concerned entrance
into the Bar Association. The
standards set by the Supreme
Court for questioning of
applicants for the Bar are "far
more limited than the VA's,"

according to Waitzkin.
Cummings and Rudd agned
contracts in 1970 to serve as
interns at Stanford. Hie
experience at the VA hospital was
a required part of their
internships, but they objected to
the political inquiry.
Injunction
At that time they obtained a
court injunction which allowed
them to work without answering
the questionnaire.
Although the VA then changed
the wording in one of the

questions, they still required
political information of all
potential employees when
Waitzkin arrived at Stanford in
1972.
"I was ready to work. There
was a room full of patients
waiting, but they wouldn't let me
see them until I had signed the
paper," said Waitzkin.
All three doctors won a second
injunction in November, 1972,
this time a "class action" ruling
affecting VA doctors throughout
the nation. Waitzkin predicted

that this decision might also set a
legal precedent for other
government employees.
The government appealed the
1972 injunction through Justice
Department lawyers, but the
appeallate court upheld the
previous decision.
Malcolm Bumstein, a Berkeley
lawyer who has handled several
civil liberties cases, represented
the doctors. The American Civil
Liberties Union submitted a
statement to the court in support
of the doctors' position.

interns and residents at 'VA
hospitals throughout the country,
said Dr. Howard Waitzkin.
Waitzkin, Peter Cummings and
Peter Rudd, initiated proceedings
in 1970 and again in 1972,
objecting on First Amendment
grounds to a questionnaire which
asked potential employees about
membership in the Communist
Party or in other political
organizations.
Last week the federal Ninth
Circuit Court of Appeals ruled
that "such minimal interest as the
government may have concerning
these physicians' beliefs and
associations must be balanced
against the intrusion upon First
Amendment rights engenered by
the inquiries."
Nine-Year Hassle
This decision follows at least
nine years of legal hassles by other
medical workers. In 1964 Dr. June
Fisher, now a physician at a clinic
in East Palo Alto, worked at the
Palo Alto VA hospital without
pay during her Stanford residency
when she refused to answer these
questions.
Since then, eight other doctors
have either worked without pay
or forfeited experience at the VA
hospital rather than answer the
questionnaire.
Most of the legal precedents
for the case concerned entrance
into the Bar Association. The
standards set by the Supreme
Court for questioning of
applicants for the Bar are "far
more limited than the VA's,"

according to Waitzkin.
Cummings and Rudd agned
contracts in 1970 to serve as
interns at Stanford. Hie
experience at the VA hospital was
a required part of their
internships, but they objected to
the political inquiry.
Injunction
At that time they obtained a
court injunction which allowed
them to work without answering
the questionnaire.
Although the VA then changed
the wording in one of the

questions, they still required
political information of all
potential employees when
Waitzkin arrived at Stanford in
1972.
"I was ready to work. There
was a room full of patients
waiting, but they wouldn't let me
see them until I had signed the
paper," said Waitzkin.
All three doctors won a second
injunction in November, 1972,
this time a "class action" ruling
affecting VA doctors throughout
the nation. Waitzkin predicted

that this decision might also set a
legal precedent for other
government employees.
The government appealed the
1972 injunction through Justice
Department lawyers, but the
appeallate court upheld the
previous decision.
Malcolm Bumstein, a Berkeley
lawyer who has handled several
civil liberties cases, represented
the doctors. The American Civil
Liberties Union submitted a
statement to the court in support
of the doctors' position.
After a three-year legal battle,
three Medical Center doctors have
won a ruling against the Veterans
Administration policy of requiring
political information from all
medical employees.
Although the specific case
involved Palo Alto Veterans'
Hospital, the decision affects all
interns and residents at 'VA
hospitals throughout the country,
said Dr. Howard Waitzkin.
