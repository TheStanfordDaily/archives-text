# Alioto Paid No Income Tax

### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -
Mayor Joseph L. Alioto paid no
state or federal income taxes in
1971 because he paid out legal
fees that year of more than twice
the amount of his income, an aide
said last night.
The aide, Tom Flynn, the
mayor's press secretary,
confirmed facts in a story in the
San Francisco Chronicle which
reported Alioto paid no federal or
state income taxes in 1971 when
his income was $73,000, including
$41,088 in salary for his city
office.
Alioto was in Los Angeles at a
labor dinner, Flynn said, but the
major earlier had given this
comment on the Chronicle story:
"Legal expenses in
connnection with defending
myself against the false Look
Magazine charges and the
malicious Seattle lawsuits
completely wiped out my income
in 1971.
"My total legal expenses have
exceeded $250,000 to date. I wish
I didn't have that kind of
deduction."
In the Look Magazine case
Alioto charged he was libeled by
an article which alleged he was
entangled in a web of alliances
with Mafia figures. A second trial
ended in a hung jury unable to
agree on the question of malice
agreeing that the article was false
and defamatory.
Seattle Case
The Seattle utility case
involved a claim by several utility
districts that Alioto had an illegal
fee-splitting arrangement when he
won an anti-trust action for them
against private utilities. A jury
held in Alioto's favor last year
after a six-month trial in the civil
case, and a criminal case was
dismissed in federal district court.
Flynn said 1971 was the only
year of the last 10 in which Alioto
paid no income taxes. His total of
such taxes for the last decade has
been $2,648,053, Flynn said, with
$327,833 of the amount in state
tax.

Alioto also has given
$2,540,173 to educational and
religious charities over the last 10
years.
No Shelters
During the 10-year period, the
mayor was involved in a shipping
business and other business
interests in addition to his
successful legal business, Flynn
said, and"he had no tax shelters."
Internal Revenue Service acting
district director Cornelius

Coleman said the legal fees paid
by Alioto in 1971 "would qualify
as legitimate deductions... based
on the fact the legal fees were
necessary to defend his integrity
as a lawyer and public official."
Flynn pointed out that the
lawyers who received the fees
from Alioto in 1971 had to pay
taxes on those fees, so "in essence
the mayor paid income taxes on
all the money only it was through
third parties. ..

from Alioto in 1971 had to pay
taxes on those fees, so "in essence
the mayor paid income taxes on
all the money only it was through
third parties. ..
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -
Mayor Joseph L. Alioto paid no
state or federal income taxes in
1971 because he paid out legal
fees that year of more than twice
the amount of his income, an aide
said last night.
The aide, Tom Flynn, the
mayor's press secretary,
confirmed facts in a story in the
San Francisco Chronicle which
reported Alioto paid no federal or
state income taxes in 1971 when
his income was $73,000, including
$41,088 in salary for his city
office.
Alioto was in Los Angeles at a
labor dinner, Flynn said, but the
major earlier had given this
comment on the Chronicle story:
"Legal expenses in
connnection with defending
myself against the false Look
Magazine charges and the
malicious Seattle lawsuits
completely wiped out my income
in 1971.
"My total legal expenses have
exceeded $250,000 to date. I wish
I didn't have that kind of
deduction."
In the Look Magazine case
Alioto charged he was libeled by
an article which alleged he was
entangled in a web of alliances
with Mafia figures. A second trial
ended in a hung jury unable to
agree on the question of malice
agreeing that the article was false
and defamatory.
Seattle Case
The Seattle utility case
involved a claim by several utility
districts that Alioto had an illegal
fee-splitting arrangement when he
won an anti-trust action for them
against private utilities. A jury
held in Alioto's favor last year
after a six-month trial in the civil
case, and a criminal case was
dismissed in federal district court.
Flynn said 1971 was the only
year of the last 10 in which Alioto
paid no income taxes. His total of
such taxes for the last decade has
been $2,648,053, Flynn said, with
$327,833 of the amount in state
tax.

Alioto also has given
$2,540,173 to educational and
religious charities over the last 10
years.
No Shelters
During the 10-year period, the
mayor was involved in a shipping
business and other business
interests in addition to his
successful legal business, Flynn
said, and"he had no tax shelters."
Internal Revenue Service acting
district director Cornelius

Coleman said the legal fees paid
by Alioto in 1971 "would qualify
as legitimate deductions... based
on the fact the legal fees were
necessary to defend his integrity
as a lawyer and public official."
Flynn pointed out that the
lawyers who received the fees
from Alioto in 1971 had to pay
taxes on those fees, so "in essence
the mayor paid income taxes on
all the money only it was through
third parties. ..
