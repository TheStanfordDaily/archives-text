# Uses Sound For Diagnosis
## Ultrasonic Device Invented 
### 
Stanford engineers are
developing an instrument that will
harmlessly take pictures of organs
inside the human body, using
sound instead of light or X rays.
The device is expected to be
immensely valuable in medical
diagnosis, particularly in
cardiology, in abdominal surveys
for tumors, in ophthalmology,
and in obstetrics when X rays may
be harmful.
The Ultrasonic Imaging System
(ULISYS) is being developed by
Stanford Electrical Engineering
Prof. James D. Meindl, director of
the Stanford Electronics
Laboratories, and a team of
collaborating engineers and
doctors.
The ultrasonic "camera"
consists of a cylindrical tube,
about 24 inches long, which is
connected to a control apparatus
and display screen. It works by
aiming a concentrated "bundle"
of high frequency sound waves at
an organ, such as the heart. The
echoes produced are processed to
form a picture similar to a
television image.
The ultrasound waves
generated by ULISYS are

harmless and cannot be heard,
since the pitch or frequency is
above the range of human hearing.
(The ear can hear sounds between
100 and 20,000 cycles per second;
ultrasound in ULISYS is at three
million cycles per second.)
Harmless Procedure
Because it is a harmless
procedure, Dr. Meindl foresees the
ULISYS becoming a standard
examining tool in pregnancy. He
describes the procedure as quick,
accurate, and low cost.
In cardiology, the kind of
information supplied would not
ordinarily be available. In part it
can be obtained with the use of
catheterization and other invasive
procedures which entail
hospitalization and potential risks
to the patient. (Catheterization
involves passing a small tube into
a vein in the arm and through the
blood vessels into the heart.)
The ULISYS can picture the
heart in continuous action as seen
on a television screen.
Dr. Meindl notes that sound
waves are particularly suited to
carrying such images, since they
travel well through solids, and
particularly well through liquids,

which make up a high percentage
of the human body.
Established Technique
Ultrasonic diagnosis is an
established clinical technique in
several medical areas, such as
obstetrics, gynecology, and
cardiology. To date, however, it
has been limited almost
exclusively to use of a single,
pencil-like beam or signal which is
echoed back to a receiver. In this
way the depth of a particular
structure can be determined.
In ULISYS, however, many
sound beams are emitted, then
processed, to form a more real,
two dimensional, picture of the
structure.
Opthalmologists are currentl
using a pencil-like beam of
ultrasound to search for disease
states and foreign bodies in the
eye. In the future, with use of
ULISYS, they will be able to
obtain a more thorough and
accurate picture.
Two Years Away
According to Meindl, the
unique instrument is more than
two years away from being
available as a commercial device
for use by doctors.
He, and collaborators Drs.
James Plummer, Maxwell
Maginness and others, are at work
on improving the resolution — or
clarity — of the reflected image,
on making larger fields of view
possible, and on improved
television displays.
The engineers see the
instrument as a valuable
complement to X-ray procedures,
enabling doctors to see pictures,
like that of the heart, not possible
with radiation techniques.
Besides medical applications
the instrument may find testing
uses, as in detecting an interior
flow in a metal object such as a
propeller blade. It may also find
uses, says Meindl, in underwater
imaging.

sound beams are emitted, then
processed, to form a more real,
two dimensional, picture of the
structure.
Opthalmologists are currentl
using a pencil-like beam of
ultrasound to search for disease
states and foreign bodies in the
eye. In the future, with use of
ULISYS, they will be able to
obtain a more thorough and
accurate picture.
Two Years Away
According to Meindl, the
unique instrument is more than
two years away from being
available as a commercial device
for use by doctors.
He, and collaborators Drs.
James Plummer, Maxwell
Maginness and others, are at work
on improving the resolution — or
clarity — of the reflected image,
on making larger fields of view
possible, and on improved
television displays.
The engineers see the
instrument as a valuable
complement to X-ray procedures,
enabling doctors to see pictures,
like that of the heart, not possible
with radiation techniques.
Besides medical applications
the instrument may find testing
uses, as in detecting an interior
flow in a metal object such as a
propeller blade. It may also find
uses, says Meindl, in underwater
imaging.
Stanford engineers are
developing an instrument that will
harmlessly take pictures of organs
inside the human body, using
sound instead of light or X rays.
The device is expected to be
immensely valuable in medical
diagnosis, particularly in
cardiology, in abdominal surveys
for tumors, in ophthalmology,
and in obstetrics when X rays may
be harmful.
The Ultrasonic Imaging System
(ULISYS) is being developed by
Stanford Electrical Engineering
Prof. James D. Meindl, director of
the Stanford Electronics
Laboratories, and a team of
collaborating engineers and
doctors.
The ultrasonic "camera"
consists of a cylindrical tube,
about 24 inches long, which is
connected to a control apparatus
and display screen. It works by
aiming a concentrated "bundle"
of high frequency sound waves at
an organ, such as the heart. The
echoes produced are processed to
form a picture similar to a
television image.
The ultrasound waves
generated by ULISYS are

harmless and cannot be heard,
since the pitch or frequency is
above the range of human hearing.
(The ear can hear sounds between
100 and 20,000 cycles per second;
ultrasound in ULISYS is at three
million cycles per second.)
Harmless Procedure
Because it is a harmless
procedure, Dr. Meindl foresees the
ULISYS becoming a standard
examining tool in pregnancy. He
describes the procedure as quick,
accurate, and low cost.
In cardiology, the kind of
information supplied would not
ordinarily be available. In part it
can be obtained with the use of
catheterization and other invasive
procedures which entail
hospitalization and potential risks
to the patient. (Catheterization
involves passing a small tube into
a vein in the arm and through the
blood vessels into the heart.)
The ULISYS can picture the
heart in continuous action as seen
on a television screen.
Dr. Meindl notes that sound
waves are particularly suited to
carrying such images, since they
travel well through solids, and
particularly well through liquids,

which make up a high percentage
of the human body.
Established Technique
Ultrasonic diagnosis is an
established clinical technique in
several medical areas, such as
obstetrics, gynecology, and
cardiology. To date, however, it
has been limited almost
exclusively to use of a single,
pencil-like beam or signal which is
echoed back to a receiver. In this
way the depth of a particular
structure can be determined.
In ULISYS, however, many
sound beams are emitted, then
processed, to form a more real,
two dimensional, picture of the
structure.
