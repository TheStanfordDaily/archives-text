# Saxbe Probable Attorney General
## Selection Of Prosecutor Rumored 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Nixon
administration was reported last night
to have selected Leon Jaworski, a
Houston, Tex., trial lawyer who
formerly headed the American Bar
Association, as the new special
Watergate prosecutor.
Reliable sources said the
administration would announce today
the selection of Jaworski as prosecutor
and the nomination of Sen. William
Saxbe, R-Ohio, as the new attorney
general.
Both Saxbe and Jaworski indicated
they would accept the jobs, but
neither would confirm they had been
offered the posts.
Other sources also reported the
choice as the new prosecutor would be
Jaworski, a Democrat close to the
Texas political establishment
dominated by the late President
Lyndon B. Johnson and former Gov.
John B. Connally.
Reached by telephone at her

Houston home, Jaworski's wife,
Jeannette, said of the reported new
job for her husband, "That's the word.
That's what I hear, although I guess it
won't be official until it's announced
in the morning."
"There is nothing final about it,"
Jaworski said at his home. "Nothing
definite." He added an announcement
would be made this morning.
'Relatively Sure'
Sources had said earlier that the
White House planned to announce the
selection of Saxbe, a 57-year-old
Republican, today. After meeting with
President Nixon yesterday Saxbe said
he "was relatively sure" he would get
the job.
The simultaneous naming of
replacements for special prosecutor
Archibald Cox, fired 11 days ago in
the Watergate tapes controversy, and
Atty. Gen. Elliot L. Richardson, who
resigned rather than fire Cox, follows a
proposal given the White House last

week by Senate Republican leaders.
They said that prompt selection of
respected persons for the two posts,
along with assurances they would be
free to pursue the Watergate and
related investigations, were necessary
to reassure the American people after
the uproar that followed the Cox
firing.
In The Bag?
"I don't want to be presumptive
and say I've got it in the bag," Saxbe
told reporters on the driveway just
outside the White House. He said he
expected a final decision in a week or
so.
The White House withheld an
announcement on whether Saxbe
would be Nixon's nominee to succeed
Elliot L. Richardson.
"The offer was implied when I
walked in there," Saxbe said. "We had
an understanding I was there to talk
about being attorney general."
Saxbe, a first-term senator who
recently announced he would not seek
another term in 1974, was formerly
state attorney general in Ohio. In the
Senate, he at times has criticized
Nixon although his voting record
generally has supported the President.
Saxbe said he and Nixon candidly
talked about their differences during
their lengthy discussion.
He added that his occasional
opposition to the President will not
reduce his ability to work and
cooperate with Nixon.
At the same time, Saxbe said he
wanted to satisfy himself about
questions he had about Watergate.
"I'm satisfied that the President has
acted honorably in the situations that
have risen since Watergate. This is the
thing I wanted to know,"he said.
The senator said he and Nixon went
over a number of instances where he
had questions, adding "I think I have a
pretty good feel for such things, and I
believe him."

'Relatively Sure'
Sources had said earlier that the
White House planned to announce the
selection of Saxbe, a 57-year-old
Republican, today. After meeting with
President Nixon yesterday Saxbe said
he "was relatively sure" he would get
the job.
The simultaneous naming of
replacements for special prosecutor
Archibald Cox, fired 11 days ago in
the Watergate tapes controversy, and
Atty. Gen. Elliot L. Richardson, who
resigned rather than fire Cox, follows a
proposal given the White House last

week by Senate Republican leaders.
They said that prompt selection of
respected persons for the two posts,
along with assurances they would be
free to pursue the Watergate and
related investigations, were necessary
to reassure the American people after
the uproar that followed the Cox
firing.
In The Bag?
"I don't want to be presumptive
and say I've got it in the bag," Saxbe
told reporters on the driveway just
outside the White House. He said he
expected a final decision in a week or
so.
The White House withheld an
announcement on whether Saxbe
would be Nixon's nominee to succeed
Elliot L. Richardson.
"The offer was implied when I
walked in there," Saxbe said. "We had
an understanding I was there to talk
about being attorney general."
Saxbe, a first-term senator who
recently announced he would not seek
another term in 1974, was formerly
state attorney general in Ohio. In the
Senate, he at times has criticized
Nixon although his voting record
generally has supported the President.
Saxbe said he and Nixon candidly
talked about their differences during
their lengthy discussion.
He added that his occasional
opposition to the President will not
reduce his ability to work and
cooperate with Nixon.
At the same time, Saxbe said he
wanted to satisfy himself about
questions he had about Watergate.
"I'm satisfied that the President has
acted honorably in the situations that
have risen since Watergate. This is the
thing I wanted to know,"he said.
The senator said he and Nixon went
over a number of instances where he
had questions, adding "I think I have a
pretty good feel for such things, and I
believe him."
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Nixon
administration was reported last night
to have selected Leon Jaworski, a
Houston, Tex., trial lawyer who
formerly headed the American Bar
Association, as the new special
Watergate prosecutor.
Reliable sources said the
administration would announce today
the selection of Jaworski as prosecutor
and the nomination of Sen. William
Saxbe, R-Ohio, as the new attorney
general.
Both Saxbe and Jaworski indicated
they would accept the jobs, but
neither would confirm they had been
offered the posts.
Other sources also reported the
choice as the new prosecutor would be
Jaworski, a Democrat close to the
Texas political establishment
dominated by the late President
Lyndon B. Johnson and former Gov.
John B. Connally.
Reached by telephone at her

Houston home, Jaworski's wife,
Jeannette, said of the reported new
job for her husband, "That's the word.
That's what I hear, although I guess it
won't be official until it's announced
in the morning."
"There is nothing final about it,"
Jaworski said at his home. "Nothing
definite." He added an announcement
would be made this morning.
