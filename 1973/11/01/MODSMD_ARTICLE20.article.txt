# Long List Of Maryland Officials Fight Variety Of Legal Troubles
## 
### 
ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -
When Spiro T. Agnew pleaded no
contest to a charge of income tax
evasion, he joined a growing list of
Maryland officials and former
officials who have left office
under a legal cloud.
In resigning as vice president of
the United States earlier this
month, Agnew pleaded no contest
to a government charge that he
had failed to report $29,500 of
income received in 1966 when he
was governor of Maryland.
In the last decade, Mary landers
have seen a U.S. senator, a
congressman and a speaker of the
state House of Delegates
convicted on criminal charges.
In addition, at least three other
members of the General Assembly
were convicted of criminal
misdeeds, several other legislators
and public officials were indicted
and some well-publicized
investigations into the activities of
still more politicians are under
way.
'No More Corrupt'
This flurry of prosecutions and
investigations has focused national
attention on governmental
corruption in Maryland. But many
Maryland officials, piqued by
outside criticism, insist that the
state is no more corrupt than any
other.
Gov. Marvin Mandel, for
example, says there have been
more prosecutions in Maryland
because the state has active,
aggressive prosecutors.
Former U.S. Sen. Joseph D.
Tydings, who as U.S. attorney in
Baltimore initiated the current
series of political prosecutions,
agrees with Mandel.
Two of the major convictions
came from investigations begun
by Tydings in the early 1960s into
the scandal-ridden savings and

loan industry.
They resulted in prison terms
for Thomas F. Johnson, then a
Democratic congressman, and A.
Gordon Boone, a Baltimore
County Democrat who was
speaker of the House of Delegates.
Johnson was found guilty of
accepting payment in return for a
speech he gave on the House
floor.
Boone was sentenced to three
years in prison for mail fraud
arising from the operation of a
firm which insured accounts in
savings and loan firms.
Brewster's Problems
The highest ranking official
other than Agnew to get involved
in legal difficulties was former
U.S. Sen. Daniel B. Brewster.
Brewster, a Democrat and at
one time a law partner of Boone,

was convicted of accepting an
unlawful payment in connection
with pending legislation dealing
with third-class mail rates. He has
appealed his conviction.
At least three members of the
state legislature have been
convicted of criminal violations in
the last decade.
Two members of the General
Assembly were indicted this year.
One, Baltimore Democratic
Del. James A. "Turk" Scott, was
arrested during the 1973 session
on narcotics charges.
Before he could be brought to
trial, he was shot to death in the
basement parking garage of his
luxury apartrtient building in
Baltimore.
Another Baltimore Democrat,
State Sen. Clarence M. Mitchell
111, is under indictment on charges

of violating federal income tÂ£x
laws. His trial has been postponed
until after the 1974 legislative
session.
On the local level, Baltimore
county executive Dale Anderson
has been indicted twice this year,
once on 39 counts of extortion,
bribery and conspiracy in a
kickback scheme which allegedly
netted him $46,420 and once on
four counts of income tax law
violations.
Next Target?
Although there is no indication
who is under investigation, county
executive Joseph W. Alton, in a
news conference and an interview,
has indicated while asserting his
innocence that he is a likely target
of the inquiry.
