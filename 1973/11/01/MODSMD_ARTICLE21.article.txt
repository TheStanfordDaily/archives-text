# Campus ‘Skid Row’ Emerging
## 
### 
BERKELEY — A kind of skid row is emerging
around university campuses, a researcher says, as
listless, sometimes troubled youths spend their time
hustling change, maybe selling drugs and rapping
endlessly about their uncertain futures.
These "street people" can be seen lounging on
busy sidewalks or on many campuses, like the
University of California, taking advantage of the
tolerant atmosphere until they panhandle enough
money to move on, says Henry Miller, a UC
professor of social welfare.
"From almost any point of view, these are
unsettled kids," said Miller. "It may be a little
farfetched to say, but there appears to be a new skid
row emerging. This one is not in decaying cities, but
along the fringes of university campuses."
Miller and a graduate assistant interviewed 295
young transients who showed up for free meals at a
food program here. The study was requested by a
group of campus and city officials who wanted to
learn what's behind the increasing number of young
drifters.
"What emerged was a rather grim portraint of

their life," Miller said. • ■«
"These are unhappy people who are not
connected with anything — family, jobs, a home or
even their friends. They are disaffiliated in a
profound way," he said.
Most of the street people interviewed were white
males with an average age of 22.6 years. Women
averaged 1
Miller said 38 percent came from broken homes
and a third had dropped out of high school. Of the
rest, less than 10 percent had a college degree.
About 65 percent said they had been arrested for
vagrancy, shoplifting or possessing drugs.
Twenty-two percent had been hospitalized for
psychiatric care.
Several of these youngsters congregating along
Telegraph Avenue said the study sounded about
right. ?
"It's easy to get along here, bumming money and
doing a little dope now and then," said one youth
who called himself "STP."
Another, Dave Smith, 21, said: "Man, a lot of us
will just take off, I guess, when we get some bread
and when nothing's happening here."
