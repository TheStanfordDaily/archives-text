# Sitar Melodies Charm Audience By 'Incorporating Six Emotions'
## 
### SRI KRISHN CHOPRA 
Last Friday night, a lovely
little girl with hair the color of a
full moon and the face of a
sleeping beauty, reclined on a sofa
in the candlelight-lit lounge of the
Bechtel International Center.
Her eyes were shut. But from
the rhythmic movement of her
lovely little hands you knew she
was actually resonating with the
sound of music in the air.
The 150 others who crowded
the I-Center lounge that night
were much too immersed in their
own thoughts to notice this five
year old sleeping beauty.
You couldn't really blame
them, though. Ram Chandra
Mistry, the internationally known
exponent of classical Indian sitar
was playing Raga Puryadhanusri, a
melody which compels you to
plumb your thoughts.
The occasion was the Ram
Chandra Mistry sitar night,
arranged by the I-Center in
conjunction with the India
Association.
Sx Emotions
"Indian classical music," the
maestro explained in a brief
lecture before the start of the
performance, "incorporates six
human emotions: love,
compassion, wonder, joy, serenity
and force."
He wove these six feelings on
the sitar, which is a seven stringed
instrument made of gourd,
belonging to the family of the
sacred Vina of the Hindu
tradition, with such elegance that
a pony-tailed man in denim jacket
and leather boots exclaimed:
"Jesus! this is beautiful."
A coed who wore a cherubic
smile and a crimson cap had
brought two pillows with her. "I
rest my head on the pillows and
this sitar music takes me to the
world beyond."
An elderly American, dressed
in Indian hurta and churidar
pyjamas sat cross-legged, eyes
closed in a yogic pose throughout
the two hour performance. "Ram
Chandra's music is like a poem. I
become the vibrations."
Ram Chandra Mistry plays sitar
the classical Dhrupada style. This
is different from the more popular
Khiyal style practiced by the
famous Ravi Shankar.
Lively Dialogue
In the Khiyal style, the sitar is
accompanied by the tabla and the
tanpura. There is a lively dialogue
between the table player and the
sitarist. The performance invokes
hasyarasa or li gh the arte dn ess.
The spectators are thus
entertained not only by the lilting

music, but more so by the
"fantastic excitement of the
performers." Also, there is much
more of composition and little
improvisation.
The Dhrupada style on the
other hand, involves mainly
improvisation. The sitar is played
solo. "The Dhrupada style,"
explained the forty year old
maestro, "is temple music
invoking the Almighty. It permits
no excitement. You see, it is the
purest of the Indian musical
styles."
Ram Chandra Mistry studied
both vocal and instrumental
classical music under the greatest
exponents of these disciplines in
India where he was bom and
brought up. He came to Paris in
1968 under a cultural exchange
scholarship.
"While in Paris, a french
journalist asked me if I could
teach her the sitar in two
months," Mistry recounted. "I
taught her in one month." After

that his fame spread. The number
of his pupils grew and he founded
schools in Paris and Tubingen,
Germany. He also opened an
Indo-European musical society in
Vienna.
TTie five feet tall sitarist put up
a performance in the UNESCO in
1972, when four of his European
pupils performed. "Their
performance was hailed by every
critic," he proudly says.
School
Would he like to open a school
at Stanford, asked someone from
the audience during an
intermission. "I just need three
people to start a school," he
replied. "I teach them. They teach
the others."
Judging from the crowd at the
performance, he certainly
wouldn't have much difficulty
getting three pupils. But since
learning the Dhrupada style
requires a considerable amount of
concentration, only the genuinely
interested can sustain their

involvement.
Even during the performance,
the crowd thinned down steadily.
There were only about 25 people
left when he played the last Raga
of the evening — the Raga
Darbari.
This Raga involves tranquility.
Even as the maestro swayed from
side to side, working on the sitar
strings, the house was lulled in a
state of sublime calm. For those
few minutes all was serene in the
world outside. Time stood still.
Suddenly Over
And then it was suddenly over.
It looked like somebody had
turned on the lights while you
were in the midst of a beautiful
dream.
An American in an orange
kurta was the first to regain
composure. His face glowed with
elation as he bowed a grateful
'Dhanyavada' to the maestro.
Dhanyuada is Hindi for thank
you.

this sitar music takes me to the
world beyond."
An elderly American, dressed
in Indian hurta and churidar
pyjamas sat cross-legged, eyes
closed in a yogic pose throughout
the two hour performance. "Ram
Chandra's music is like a poem. I
become the vibrations."
Ram Chandra Mistry plays sitar
the classical Dhrupada style. This
is different from the more popular
Khiyal style practiced by the
famous Ravi Shankar.
Lively Dialogue
In the Khiyal style, the sitar is
accompanied by the tabla and the
tanpura. There is a lively dialogue
between the table player and the
sitarist. The performance invokes
hasyarasa or li gh the arte dn ess.
The spectators are thus
entertained not only by the lilting

music, but more so by the
"fantastic excitement of the
performers." Also, there is much
more of composition and little
improvisation.
The Dhrupada style on the
other hand, involves mainly
improvisation. The sitar is played
solo. "The Dhrupada style,"
explained the forty year old
maestro, "is temple music
invoking the Almighty. It permits
no excitement. You see, it is the
purest of the Indian musical
styles."
Ram Chandra Mistry studied
both vocal and instrumental
classical music under the greatest
exponents of these disciplines in
India where he was bom and
brought up. He came to Paris in
1968 under a cultural exchange
scholarship.
"While in Paris, a french
journalist asked me if I could
teach her the sitar in two
months," Mistry recounted. "I
taught her in one month." After

that his fame spread. The number
of his pupils grew and he founded
schools in Paris and Tubingen,
Germany. He also opened an
Indo-European musical society in
Vienna.
TTie five feet tall sitarist put up
a performance in the UNESCO in
1972, when four of his European
pupils performed. "Their
performance was hailed by every
critic," he proudly says.
School
Would he like to open a school
at Stanford, asked someone from
the audience during an
intermission. "I just need three
people to start a school," he
replied. "I teach them. They teach
the others."
Judging from the crowd at the
performance, he certainly
wouldn't have much difficulty
getting three pupils. But since
learning the Dhrupada style
requires a considerable amount of
concentration, only the genuinely
interested can sustain their

involvement.
Even during the performance,
the crowd thinned down steadily.
There were only about 25 people
left when he played the last Raga
of the evening — the Raga
Darbari.
This Raga involves tranquility.
Even as the maestro swayed from
side to side, working on the sitar
strings, the house was lulled in a
state of sublime calm. For those
few minutes all was serene in the
world outside. Time stood still.
Suddenly Over
And then it was suddenly over.
It looked like somebody had
turned on the lights while you
were in the midst of a beautiful
dream.
An American in an orange
kurta was the first to regain
composure. His face glowed with
elation as he bowed a grateful
'Dhanyavada' to the maestro.
Dhanyuada is Hindi for thank
you.


SITAR RIGHT DOWN-Ram Chandra Mistry, internationally known exponent of classical Indian sitar
performed last Friday night at the Bechtel International Center.
Last Friday night, a lovely
little girl with hair the color of a
full moon and the face of a
sleeping beauty, reclined on a sofa
in the candlelight-lit lounge of the
Bechtel International Center.
Her eyes were shut. But from
the rhythmic movement of her
lovely little hands you knew she
was actually resonating with the
sound of music in the air.
The 150 others who crowded
the I-Center lounge that night
were much too immersed in their
own thoughts to notice this five
year old sleeping beauty.
You couldn't really blame
them, though. Ram Chandra
Mistry, the internationally known
exponent of classical Indian sitar
was playing Raga Puryadhanusri, a
melody which compels you to
plumb your thoughts.
The occasion was the Ram
Chandra Mistry sitar night,
arranged by the I-Center in
conjunction with the India
Association.
Sx Emotions
"Indian classical music," the
maestro explained in a brief
lecture before the start of the
performance, "incorporates six
human emotions: love,
compassion, wonder, joy, serenity
and force."
He wove these six feelings on
the sitar, which is a seven stringed
instrument made of gourd,
belonging to the family of the
sacred Vina of the Hindu
tradition, with such elegance that
a pony-tailed man in denim jacket
and leather boots exclaimed:
"Jesus! this is beautiful."
A coed who wore a cherubic
smile and a crimson cap had
brought two pillows with her. "I
rest my head on the pillows and
this sitar music takes me to the
world beyond."

that his fame spread. The number
of his pupils grew and he founded
schools in Paris and Tubingen,
Germany. He also opened an
Indo-European musical society in
Vienna.
TTie five feet tall sitarist put up
a performance in the UNESCO in
1972, when four of his European
pupils performed. "Their
performance was hailed by every
critic," he proudly says.
School
Would he like to open a school
at Stanford, asked someone from
the audience during an
intermission. "I just need three
people to start a school," he
replied. "I teach them. They teach
the others."
Judging from the crowd at the
performance, he certainly
wouldn't have much difficulty
getting three pupils. But since
learning the Dhrupada style
requires a considerable amount of
concentration, only the genuinely
interested can sustain their

involvement.
Even during the performance,
the crowd thinned down steadily.
There were only about 25 people
left when he played the last Raga
of the evening — the Raga
Darbari.
This Raga involves tranquility.
Even as the maestro swayed from
side to side, working on the sitar
strings, the house was lulled in a
state of sublime calm. For those
few minutes all was serene in the
world outside. Time stood still.
Suddenly Over
And then it was suddenly over.
It looked like somebody had
turned on the lights while you
were in the midst of a beautiful
dream.
An American in an orange
kurta was the first to regain
composure. His face glowed with
elation as he bowed a grateful
'Dhanyavada' to the maestro.
Dhanyuada is Hindi for thank
you.


SITAR RIGHT DOWN-Ram Chandra Mistry, internationally known exponent of classical Indian sitar
performed last Friday night at the Bechtel International Center.
Last Friday night, a lovely
little girl with hair the color of a
full moon and the face of a
sleeping beauty, reclined on a sofa
in the candlelight-lit lounge of the
Bechtel International Center.
Her eyes were shut. But from
the rhythmic movement of her
lovely little hands you knew she
was actually resonating with the
sound of music in the air.
The 150 others who crowded
the I-Center lounge that night
were much too immersed in their
own thoughts to notice this five
year old sleeping beauty.
You couldn't really blame
them, though. Ram Chandra
Mistry, the internationally known
exponent of classical Indian sitar
was playing Raga Puryadhanusri, a
melody which compels you to
plumb your thoughts.
The occasion was the Ram
Chandra Mistry sitar night,
arranged by the I-Center in
conjunction with the India
Association.
Sx Emotions
"Indian classical music," the
maestro explained in a brief
lecture before the start of the
performance, "incorporates six
human emotions: love,
compassion, wonder, joy, serenity
and force."
He wove these six feelings on
the sitar, which is a seven stringed
instrument made of gourd,
belonging to the family of the
sacred Vina of the Hindu
tradition, with such elegance that
a pony-tailed man in denim jacket
and leather boots exclaimed:
"Jesus! this is beautiful."
A coed who wore a cherubic
smile and a crimson cap had
brought two pillows with her. "I
rest my head on the pillows and
this sitar music takes me to the
world beyond."
An elderly American, dressed
in Indian hurta and churidar
pyjamas sat cross-legged, eyes
closed in a yogic pose throughout
the two hour performance. "Ram
Chandra's music is like a poem. I
become the vibrations."
Ram Chandra Mistry plays sitar
the classical Dhrupada style. This
is different from the more popular
Khiyal style practiced by the
famous Ravi Shankar.
Lively Dialogue
In the Khiyal style, the sitar is
accompanied by the tabla and the
tanpura. There is a lively dialogue
between the table player and the
sitarist. The performance invokes
hasyarasa or li gh the arte dn ess.
The spectators are thus
entertained not only by the lilting

music, but more so by the
"fantastic excitement of the
performers." Also, there is much
more of composition and little
improvisation.
The Dhrupada style on the
other hand, involves mainly
improvisation. The sitar is played
solo. "The Dhrupada style,"
explained the forty year old
maestro, "is temple music
invoking the Almighty. It permits
no excitement. You see, it is the
purest of the Indian musical
styles."
Ram Chandra Mistry studied
both vocal and instrumental
classical music under the greatest
exponents of these disciplines in
India where he was bom and
brought up. He came to Paris in
1968 under a cultural exchange
scholarship.
"While in Paris, a french
journalist asked me if I could
teach her the sitar in two
months," Mistry recounted. "I
taught her in one month." After

that his fame spread. The number
of his pupils grew and he founded
schools in Paris and Tubingen,
Germany. He also opened an
Indo-European musical society in
Vienna.
