# Tasting Rooms Offer Varied Delicacies
## Napa Vintners Entice Wine Enthusiasts 
### TERRIE McDONALD 
Champagne for breakfast is
pretty ritzy, but how about
rounding out your mid-morning
brunch with a complimentary
glass of Johannesberg Riesling,
Pinot Noir and Meloso Cream
Sherry? Could you refuse a free
glass of Chenin Blanc, Zinfandel
and Cabernet Sauvignon for
lunch?
The little old vintners of Napa
County are enticing hundreds of
thousands of wine enthusiasts into
their tasting rooms with just such
a proposition. At this time of year
the lure of the grape country
is even stronger than usual as
harvesting injects this modern
industry with Old World
enthusiasm.
From Stanford it is an easy
two hour drive to this land of
baccanalian delights. Reached by
crossing the Bay Bridge and
proceeding north on Highway 29,
a seven mile stretch of road
separates the graciously arched
adobe wine-making complex of
Robert Mondavi in Oakville from
his father's Charles Krug Winery
in St. Helena. Distributed almost
equally on either side of this

segment of highway are nine, soon
to be ten, wineries offering free
spirits to a tippling public.
This high concentration of
wineries, and the flat, straight
length of Highway 29 connecting
the tasting rooms, combine to
inspire a bike tour of the wine
country. On a busy afternoon at
the Beaulieu Vineyard a smug
cyclist will be sipping his second
glass of Sauvignon Blanc while a
half-dozen cars continue their
slow, anticipatory dance around a
full parking lot.
But biking between wineries in
Napa County is more than just a
means of solving a parking
problem. It is part of entering into
the gestalt of the wine country.
Vines grow almost to the asphalt
shoulder along much of the
two-lane section of road traveled
by the motorist and cyclist alike.
(Unavoidably, the sensual
earthiness of the land and grapes
is mediated and compromised
when experienced through a ton
or more of steel and glass.) And, it
is infinitely easier to pull off the
road for a spontaneous vineyard
picnic when your transportation is
a Schwinn rather than an
Oldsmobile.

Traveling the winery circuit, by
whatever vehicle, calls for some
discriminating choices. Quantities
of fine wine available for the
asking are apt to confuse those
just emerging from bouts with
dorm-party rotgut. A simple
knowledge of personal preference
for white or red wines will give
initial direction to the novice
taster. Some wineries select
samples for you; others open
almost their entire inventory and
respond to requests with generous
portions. If left adrift between the
spectrum colors and taste
sensations, it is a good operating
principle to begin with the lighter,
drier wines, saving the brandies
and dessert wines for last.
Many of the names will be
unfamiliar unless California wines
have been a tradition in your
home. Among the reds, try
Zinfandel, a varietal unique in
that it grows only in California, as
well as some Chenin Blanc, a
pleasing white wine that often
appears at upper echelon campus
cheese parties. If any of the
wineries are offering a sample of
the much sought-after Cabernet
Sauvignon, take a sip; it's a good
bet you can't afford to buy it.

These pastimes which are
earned on indoors, are unimpared
by inclimate weather. Still, it is a
happy coincidence that Stanford
gathers students back on campus
just as the grape harvest is
beginning. Because many of the
Napa County wineries are located
in the midst of their own
vineyards, the visitor is frequently
treated to a glimpse of the
vine-to-vat saga of California's
most prized wines as well as a day
in the romantically pastoral
countryside.
Throughout the area vines are
turning color as legions of pickers
move through the fields thru early
November. During this period the
wineries experience their greatest
flurry of activity and largest
turnout of visitors.
While wine itself draws the
mass of pilgrims to the personable
northern California communities
of Oakville, Rutherford and St.
Helena, the elegance and mystique
surrounding the drink make the
trip worthwhile even for those
who are not really fans of the 12
percent by volume beverage.
Winery tours, which are often
requisite before one can gain
admittance to the tasting room,

are surprisingly interesting and
varied. Few last more than thirty
minutes and in that time a wealth
of detail about house specialties,
viticulture (grape-growing) and
enology (wine-making) is
imparted.
Walking as they talk, guidesmay
wend the group through a
labyrinth of pungently acidic
2,000 gallon casks, dart into chilly
limestone caves carved into the
side of the valley or demonstrate
bottling techniques.
Christian Brothers
The historic Christian Brothers
Wine and Champagne Cellar is
located within view of the slightly
older Krug winery in St. Helena.
Here Brother Timothy's
impressive collection of 926
different corkscrews is housed in
the imposing store building
constructed in 1899. For the
curious, there is a short history of
this monastic teaching order's
involvement in such a delightfully
wicked enterprise.
Across the street the Charles
Krug people distribute recipes
and a novice's fail-safe guide to
matching house wines with every
conceivable food. At this oldest
(historical landmark no. 563) yet
among the most modern of the
valley's wineries, a renovated
railroad car sits aloof among the
Krug vines as an exclusive tasting
room. Those of us without special
status drink in a more
conventional environment. The
good news is that while the
Charles Krug tasting room offers
unfermented grape juice to
youngsters volunteering the
information that they are not 21,
no I.D.S are checked anvwhere.
Other conspicuous wineries
along the prescribed route bear
the Beringer, Martini and
Inglenook labels. The
architectural gamut loosed along
this seven-mile time-line includes

Stanford graduate Mondavi's
every-so-familiar Franciscan
arches, the 98 year-old Beringer
Rhine House, the yellow and red
mansard chateau profile of the
Inglenook company and the
Sunset Magazine interior of the
light and modern Martini winery.
Modest Buildings
The Sutter Hone and Heitz
wineries are apt to be overlooked
because of their modest buildings
and unfamiliar labels, in spite of
their proximity to the highway.
Perhaps because they are slower
moving or just more observant,
hikers sometimes outnumber
motorists at these smaller
concerns.
Testifying to the overall ease of
the journey, grandparents on
balloon-tire tandems as well as
hot-shots on fifteen-speed touring
bikes cruise between wineries
without difficulty. The route is
direct and picturesque, but
unfortunately without formal
bike paths. However, the shoulder
is paved and separated from
Highway 29 proper by a white
line; adequate for bikers who
don't wobble and waver.
If you are at all timid about
biking in traffic, there is always
recourse to the primitive
automobile or the alternative of
biking during seasons less popular
than fall. The wineries generally
offer t~"j and tasting throughout
the year and the vineyards are not
without their charm in early
spring and summer.
Other Clusters
If the above itinerary does not
satisfy the more dedicated of
Stanford's wine lovers there are at
least eight other clusters of
vineyards and wineries grouped
and mapped in California. They
extend as far south as Cucamonga,
but seven are between Monterey
and Ukiah, with thro C besides
those in Napa County easily
accessible for a Bay Area
resident's day-tripping.
An invaluable little pamphlet
called "California's Wine
Wonderland" is put out by the
Wine Institute and is available at
717 Market St., San Francisco. It
gives a short general history of the
State's wine-making, then details
locations, hours and phone
numbers for each wine-producing
area.
By their count there are 19
wineries and vineyards in Napa
County, far too many for even the
most determined taster to sample
in a single day.
Some of these are located
several miles away from the
central concentration between
Oakville and St. Helena or are
located on a more winding,
ill-suited-for-biking section of
Highway 29. However, a thirsty
curiosity, a favored label or a
zealous commitment to cycling
may lure some from the straight,
if narrow path herein suggested.
