# Lon Chaney Jr. Still Lives
## 
### GLENN GARVIN 
LOS ANGELES — Lon Chaney
Jr. dodged a thousand silver
bullets in his time, slipped away
from hundreds of sharpened
stakes aimed at his heart, and
escaped at least a dozen
torch-wielding mobs.
Every once in a while it looked
like he was finished. In a few
months, though, he would be
back again, ravaging countrysides,
terrifying villagers, and making
beautiful young women faint.
But this summer, it finally
happened. Cancer accomplished
what all the gypsies and college
professors in the world could not
— it did in Lon Chaney Jr.
Now, when the full moon rises
over little English villages, the
people can go to bed without
locking their doors. The
Transylvanian peasants can work
the fields each day without
worrying that their homes will be
destroyed when they return. The
world can be at peace.
Horrors
Lon Chaney Sr. was known as
the "Man of a Thousand Faces."
Chaney Jr. could be more
accurately described as the "Man
of a Thousand Horrors." In a
38-year career in films, he
unleashed at least a thousand
horrors on unsuspecting movie
audiences as the Mummy, the
Frankenstein monster, the son of
Dracula, and — most notably —
the Wolfman.
Just as Boris Karloff became
the definitive Frankenstein
creation, and Bela Lugosi the
archetypical Dracula, Chaney was
everyone's idea of a werewolf.
Practically every hairy beast to
take to the screen in the last 30
years has been modeled after
Chaney.
Both the Wolfman and Chaney
launched long and successful
careers in 1941, when Chaney
starred as the haunted, hunted
Larry Talbot in Universal's
motion picture The Wolfman. As
the innocent victim of a gypsy's
dying curse, Talbot was doomed
to fulfill a now-classic prophecy:
Even a man who is pure in heart
and says his prayers at night

May become a wolf when the
wolfbane blooms
And the autumn moon is bright.
Talbot was apparently killed —
and his lycanthropy cured — by a
silver cane at the end of the
movie. But another dose of silver
— at the box office — brought him
to life. It was the first time
Chaney had a chance to show his
resilence to death, and he did it
well. He did it so well that
Universal kept asking him to do it
again and again — a total of five
times as the Wolfman, once as
Frankenstein's monster, and three
times as the Mummy.
Presence
Eventually Chaney achieved a
kind of on-screen presence shared
only by Karloff and Lugosi.
Despite the fact that his fame was
won while wearing wheelbarrows
of makeup, Chaney eventually
was so successful that he didn't
need to alter his appearance for
his role to have an impact.
Just a glimpse of Chaney's face
with evoke a strong sense of
horror and pit in movie audiences.
A perfect example is the
Universal film Dead Man's Eyes,
made in 1944. It's only an average
suspense film, without even a hint
of the supernatural. Yet from the
moment Chaney walks onto the
screen, the audience experiences a
dread premonition that something
hideous is going to occur.
Chaney's air of doomed
innocence, carefully cultimvated
for the Larry Talbot role, is
impossible to dispel, and although
the movie has a happy ending,
audiences walked away with a
feeling of vague melancholy.
The powerful Chaney presence
also carried the day for the 1956
release of The Indestructable Man.
He plays an innocent man,
executed wrongly, who returns
from the grave to stalk the
members of the jury that
convicted him.
Easy Role
The role is an easy one; Chaney
speaks hardly a word of dialogue
after the first 10 minutes or so.
An idiot could do it. But Chaney,
as he shuffles through the
darkened city in search of his

prey, does it better than anyone
else possibly could. He becomes
the personification of evil, and by
the end of the film, the mere sight
of him terrifies the audience.
Chaney didn't do all his acting
in horror films, of course. He
turned in a fine performance as
the gentle brute Lenny in John
Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men, and
his portrayal of the arthritic
sheriff in High Noon has been
imitated in hundreds of westerns
over the years, although no one
has ever done it quite so well.
But he is best remembered for
his work in horror films, and
rightfully so. Chaney was one of
those very few men who could
produce a splendid shivering in
audiences. There just isn't anyone
like him today.
Old Gypsy
When Larry Talbot was beaten
down by that silver cane in 1941,
the old gypsy woman (Maria
Ouspenskoya) eulogized:
"The way you walked was
thorny, through no fault of your
own. But as the rain enters to soil,
the river runs to sea; so tears run
to a predestined end. Your
suffering is over. Now you will
find peace for eternity."
In some ways, her remarks
seem fitting, for with Chaney, our
last links to an entire era of
filmmaking are gone. But in
another way, her words don't fit
at all.
For Chaney, of course, is not
really dead, any more than Larry
Talbot was in 1941. You can see
the two of them sometimes, late
at night, flickering through the
shadows of darkened homes,
rising once more to menace
denizens of the late show.
And maybe those
Transylvanian villagers shouldn't
rest too easily after all.

department's season opener, Puntilla (Eric Booth Miller) is surrounded by his four peasant women. The

everyone's idea of a werewolf.
Practically every hairy beast to
take to the screen in the last 30
years has been modeled after
Chaney.
Both the Wolfman and Chaney
launched long and successful
careers in 1941, when Chaney
starred as the haunted, hunted
Larry Talbot in Universal's
motion picture The Wolfman. As
the innocent victim of a gypsy's
dying curse, Talbot was doomed
to fulfill a now-classic prophecy:
Even a man who is pure in heart
and says his prayers at night

May become a wolf when the
wolfbane blooms
And the autumn moon is bright.
Talbot was apparently killed —
and his lycanthropy cured — by a
silver cane at the end of the
movie. But another dose of silver
— at the box office — brought him
to life. It was the first time
Chaney had a chance to show his
resilence to death, and he did it
well. He did it so well that
Universal kept asking him to do it
again and again — a total of five
times as the Wolfman, once as
Frankenstein's monster, and three
times as the Mummy.
Presence
Eventually Chaney achieved a
kind of on-screen presence shared
only by Karloff and Lugosi.
Despite the fact that his fame was
won while wearing wheelbarrows
of makeup, Chaney eventually
was so successful that he didn't
need to alter his appearance for
his role to have an impact.
Just a glimpse of Chaney's face
with evoke a strong sense of
horror and pit in movie audiences.
A perfect example is the
Universal film Dead Man's Eyes,
made in 1944. It's only an average
suspense film, without even a hint
of the supernatural. Yet from the
moment Chaney walks onto the
screen, the audience experiences a
dread premonition that something
hideous is going to occur.
Chaney's air of doomed
innocence, carefully cultimvated
for the Larry Talbot role, is
impossible to dispel, and although
the movie has a happy ending,
audiences walked away with a
feeling of vague melancholy.
The powerful Chaney presence
also carried the day for the 1956
release of The Indestructable Man.
He plays an innocent man,
executed wrongly, who returns
from the grave to stalk the
members of the jury that
convicted him.
Easy Role
The role is an easy one; Chaney
speaks hardly a word of dialogue
after the first 10 minutes or so.
An idiot could do it. But Chaney,
as he shuffles through the
darkened city in search of his

prey, does it better than anyone
else possibly could. He becomes
the personification of evil, and by
the end of the film, the mere sight
of him terrifies the audience.
Chaney didn't do all his acting
in horror films, of course. He
turned in a fine performance as
the gentle brute Lenny in John
Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men, and
his portrayal of the arthritic
sheriff in High Noon has been
imitated in hundreds of westerns
over the years, although no one
has ever done it quite so well.
But he is best remembered for
his work in horror films, and
rightfully so. Chaney was one of
those very few men who could
produce a splendid shivering in
audiences. There just isn't anyone
like him today.
Old Gypsy
When Larry Talbot was beaten
down by that silver cane in 1941,
the old gypsy woman (Maria
Ouspenskoya) eulogized:
"The way you walked was
thorny, through no fault of your
own. But as the rain enters to soil,
the river runs to sea; so tears run
to a predestined end. Your
suffering is over. Now you will
find peace for eternity."
In some ways, her remarks
seem fitting, for with Chaney, our
last links to an entire era of
filmmaking are gone. But in
another way, her words don't fit
at all.
For Chaney, of course, is not
really dead, any more than Larry
Talbot was in 1941. You can see
the two of them sometimes, late
at night, flickering through the
shadows of darkened homes,
rising once more to menace
denizens of the late show.
And maybe those
Transylvanian villagers shouldn't
rest too easily after all.


I GOTCHA—In a comic moment from Bertolt Brecht's "Puntilla and his Hired Man," the drama
department's season opener, Puntilla (Eric Booth Miller) is surrounded by his four peasant women. The
play opens Tuesday, Nov. 6, at 8 p.m. in the Little Theater.
LOS ANGELES — Lon Chaney
Jr. dodged a thousand silver
bullets in his time, slipped away
from hundreds of sharpened
stakes aimed at his heart, and
escaped at least a dozen
torch-wielding mobs.
Every once in a while it looked
like he was finished. In a few
months, though, he would be
back again, ravaging countrysides,
terrifying villagers, and making
beautiful young women faint.
But this summer, it finally
happened. Cancer accomplished
what all the gypsies and college
professors in the world could not
— it did in Lon Chaney Jr.
Now, when the full moon rises
over little English villages, the
people can go to bed without
locking their doors. The
Transylvanian peasants can work
the fields each day without
worrying that their homes will be
destroyed when they return. The
world can be at peace.

his role to have an impact.
Just a glimpse of Chaney's face
with evoke a strong sense of
horror and pit in movie audiences.
A perfect example is the
Universal film Dead Man's Eyes,
made in 1944. It's only an average
suspense film, without even a hint
of the supernatural. Yet from the
moment Chaney walks onto the
screen, the audience experiences a
dread premonition that something
hideous is going to occur.
Chaney's air of doomed
innocence, carefully cultimvated
for the Larry Talbot role, is
impossible to dispel, and although
the movie has a happy ending,
audiences walked away with a
feeling of vague melancholy.
The powerful Chaney presence
also carried the day for the 1956
release of The Indestructable Man.
He plays an innocent man,
executed wrongly, who returns
from the grave to stalk the
members of the jury that
convicted him.
Easy Role
The role is an easy one; Chaney
speaks hardly a word of dialogue
after the first 10 minutes or so.
An idiot could do it. But Chaney,
as he shuffles through the
darkened city in search of his

prey, does it better than anyone
else possibly could. He becomes
the personification of evil, and by
the end of the film, the mere sight
of him terrifies the audience.
Chaney didn't do all his acting
in horror films, of course. He
turned in a fine performance as
the gentle brute Lenny in John
Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men, and
his portrayal of the arthritic
sheriff in High Noon has been
imitated in hundreds of westerns
over the years, although no one
has ever done it quite so well.
But he is best remembered for
his work in horror films, and
rightfully so. Chaney was one of
those very few men who could
produce a splendid shivering in
audiences. There just isn't anyone
like him today.
Old Gypsy
When Larry Talbot was beaten
down by that silver cane in 1941,
the old gypsy woman (Maria
Ouspenskoya) eulogized:
"The way you walked was
thorny, through no fault of your
own. But as the rain enters to soil,
the river runs to sea; so tears run
to a predestined end. Your
suffering is over. Now you will
find peace for eternity."
In some ways, her remarks
seem fitting, for with Chaney, our
last links to an entire era of
filmmaking are gone. But in
another way, her words don't fit
at all.
For Chaney, of course, is not
really dead, any more than Larry
Talbot was in 1941. You can see
the two of them sometimes, late
at night, flickering through the
shadows of darkened homes,
rising once more to menace
denizens of the late show.
And maybe those
Transylvanian villagers shouldn't
rest too easily after all.


I GOTCHA—In a comic moment from Bertolt Brecht's "Puntilla and his Hired Man," the drama
department's season opener, Puntilla (Eric Booth Miller) is surrounded by his four peasant women. The
play opens Tuesday, Nov. 6, at 8 p.m. in the Little Theater.
LOS ANGELES — Lon Chaney
Jr. dodged a thousand silver
bullets in his time, slipped away
from hundreds of sharpened
stakes aimed at his heart, and
escaped at least a dozen
torch-wielding mobs.
Every once in a while it looked
like he was finished. In a few
months, though, he would be
back again, ravaging countrysides,
terrifying villagers, and making
beautiful young women faint.
But this summer, it finally
happened. Cancer accomplished
what all the gypsies and college
professors in the world could not
— it did in Lon Chaney Jr.
Now, when the full moon rises
over little English villages, the
people can go to bed without
locking their doors. The
Transylvanian peasants can work
the fields each day without
worrying that their homes will be
destroyed when they return. The
world can be at peace.
Horrors
Lon Chaney Sr. was known as
the "Man of a Thousand Faces."
Chaney Jr. could be more
accurately described as the "Man
of a Thousand Horrors." In a
38-year career in films, he
unleashed at least a thousand
horrors on unsuspecting movie
audiences as the Mummy, the
Frankenstein monster, the son of
Dracula, and — most notably —
the Wolfman.
Just as Boris Karloff became
the definitive Frankenstein
creation, and Bela Lugosi the
archetypical Dracula, Chaney was
everyone's idea of a werewolf.
Practically every hairy beast to
take to the screen in the last 30
years has been modeled after
Chaney.
Both the Wolfman and Chaney
launched long and successful
careers in 1941, when Chaney
starred as the haunted, hunted
Larry Talbot in Universal's
motion picture The Wolfman. As
the innocent victim of a gypsy's
dying curse, Talbot was doomed
to fulfill a now-classic prophecy:
Even a man who is pure in heart
and says his prayers at night

May become a wolf when the
wolfbane blooms
And the autumn moon is bright.
Talbot was apparently killed —
and his lycanthropy cured — by a
silver cane at the end of the
movie. But another dose of silver
— at the box office — brought him
to life. It was the first time
Chaney had a chance to show his
resilence to death, and he did it
well. He did it so well that
Universal kept asking him to do it
again and again — a total of five
times as the Wolfman, once as
Frankenstein's monster, and three
times as the Mummy.
Presence
Eventually Chaney achieved a
kind of on-screen presence shared
only by Karloff and Lugosi.
Despite the fact that his fame was
won while wearing wheelbarrows
of makeup, Chaney eventually
was so successful that he didn't
need to alter his appearance for
his role to have an impact.
Just a glimpse of Chaney's face
with evoke a strong sense of
horror and pit in movie audiences.
