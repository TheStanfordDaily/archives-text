# Standby Favorites Please Smaller Winterland Crowd
## 
### PAUL BREWBAKER 
Three standby favorites of rock
whetted San Francisco's appetite
for weekends to come as Country
Joe McDonald, Canned Heat, and
Hot Tuna split the bill last Friday
and Saturday nights at
Winterland. Even with crowds
holding out for the upcoming
Who, Dead, and Pie concerts, last
weekend's Graham offings
nonetheless pleased the smaller
assemblage.
While it ended up a night for
headliners Hot Tuna, Country Joe
McDonald and his All-Star Band,
after having played local clubs for
the past year, warmed up things
nicely in their concert debut. His
new half-male half-female quartet
went through an hour-long set
beginning with country-rockers,
shifting into a little "Rock 'n'
Soul" as he put it, and finishing
off with some classic Country Joe
music: the infamous Fish Cheer
and the "I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-
To-Die-Rag," among them.
Down Home
It was definitely a set for the
down-home Country Joe freaks,
but speaking as an unenlightened
observer, Country Joe would do
well to stay away from further
electronic attempts and stand by
his well amplified acoustic guitar.
Canned Heat, the
foot-stompin', pile-drivin' boogie
band who once started off with
easy "Goin' Up To The Country"
tunes, previewed their lastest
dimension in rock.
It was typical tinned
temperature as Canned Heat
smoked through a couple old-time
boogies before introducing their
new sound. Backed by a foursome
comprised of tenor and baritone
saxes, trumpet, and trombone, the
group has taken on a
distinguishable but not
dominating Motown touch.
Tuning in this brassy sound
with the boogie core, the New
Canned Heat did a soulful tune
"Bright Times" and got down on
a raunchy number called "L.A.
Town." Big Bear stomped through
a seven-song Fats Domino medley,

and the unnamed sax players
proved their worth in several good
solos.
Divine Responsibility
As if fulfilling some divine
responsibility, Canned Heat shed
their horny half (pun intentional)
and closed with a thumping
fifteen-minute boogie; just like
the old days. With some
fret-melting guitar riffs and a
lightning drum solo (watch out
Carmine Appice) Canned Heat did
well doing what they do best:
boogeying. It will be interesting to
see what their soon-to-be-released
album on Atlantic will sound like,
Jazz-Boogie fusion?
After watching King Kong get
shot to pieces by the Army Air
Corps, the lights dimmed and Bill
Graham mumbled a welcome to a
trio of original San Francisco
rockers, collectively Hot Tuna.
Performing sans Pap John
Creach's violin input, the
Jefferson Airplane offshoot group
sounded as good as ever, playing
and jamming for well over two
hours. Hot Tuna is a competent
country blues-band, but as if to
query "How country can you get
living in the Santa Cruz
Mountains?" the group threw in a

couple hard rockers to the delight
of the concertgoers.
Backed by the drumming of
Sammy Piazza, Hot Tuna is really
a showcase for the talents of
guitarist Jorma Kaukonen and
bassist Jack Casady, two very fine
artists. Having shed their long
locks a la the Mahavishnu or
Santana, the "mature" looking
pair displayed their musical
maturity as well. Casady's
backbone bass was never boring,
but flowed creatively and easily
from country to blues to searing
rock.
Switching Off
Switching off between five
separately tuned and stringed
electric guitars, Kaukonen
likewise ran the gamut of rock
styles always with tasty guitar
solos and distinctive low-profile
vocals. An extremely satisfying
guitarist, Kaukonen stole the
show with Papa John's
unnoticeable absence.
Playing everything from
"Candy Man" (not the bubble
gum one) to "Ode for Billy
Dean," and including the favorite
"Water Song," Hot Tuna showed
that even if they aren't a great
band, they are very, very good.

of the concertgoers.
Backed by the drumming of
Sammy Piazza, Hot Tuna is really
a showcase for the talents of
guitarist Jorma Kaukonen and
bassist Jack Casady, two very fine
artists. Having shed their long
locks a la the Mahavishnu or
Santana, the "mature" looking
pair displayed their musical
maturity as well. Casady's
backbone bass was never boring,
but flowed creatively and easily
from country to blues to searing
rock.
Switching Off
Switching off between five
separately tuned and stringed
electric guitars, Kaukonen
likewise ran the gamut of rock
styles always with tasty guitar
solos and distinctive low-profile
vocals. An extremely satisfying
guitarist, Kaukonen stole the
show with Papa John's
unnoticeable absence.
Playing everything from
"Candy Man" (not the bubble
gum one) to "Ode for Billy
Dean," and including the favorite
"Water Song," Hot Tuna showed
that even if they aren't a great
band, they are very, very good.
Three standby favorites of rock
whetted San Francisco's appetite
for weekends to come as Country
Joe McDonald, Canned Heat, and
Hot Tuna split the bill last Friday
and Saturday nights at
Winterland. Even with crowds
holding out for the upcoming
Who, Dead, and Pie concerts, last
weekend's Graham offings
nonetheless pleased the smaller
assemblage.
While it ended up a night for
headliners Hot Tuna, Country Joe
McDonald and his All-Star Band,
after having played local clubs for
the past year, warmed up things
nicely in their concert debut. His
new half-male half-female quartet
went through an hour-long set
beginning with country-rockers,
shifting into a little "Rock 'n'
Soul" as he put it, and finishing
off with some classic Country Joe
music: the infamous Fish Cheer
and the "I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-
To-Die-Rag," among them.
Down Home
It was definitely a set for the
down-home Country Joe freaks,
but speaking as an unenlightened
observer, Country Joe would do
well to stay away from further
electronic attempts and stand by
his well amplified acoustic guitar.
Canned Heat, the
foot-stompin', pile-drivin' boogie
band who once started off with
easy "Goin' Up To The Country"
tunes, previewed their lastest
dimension in rock.
It was typical tinned
temperature as Canned Heat
smoked through a couple old-time
boogies before introducing their
new sound. Backed by a foursome
comprised of tenor and baritone
saxes, trumpet, and trombone, the
group has taken on a
distinguishable but not
dominating Motown touch.
Tuning in this brassy sound
with the boogie core, the New
Canned Heat did a soulful tune
"Bright Times" and got down on
a raunchy number called "L.A.
Town." Big Bear stomped through
a seven-song Fats Domino medley,

and the unnamed sax players
proved their worth in several good
solos.
Divine Responsibility
As if fulfilling some divine
responsibility, Canned Heat shed
their horny half (pun intentional)
and closed with a thumping
fifteen-minute boogie; just like
the old days. With some
fret-melting guitar riffs and a
lightning drum solo (watch out
Carmine Appice) Canned Heat did
well doing what they do best:
boogeying. It will be interesting to
see what their soon-to-be-released
album on Atlantic will sound like,
Jazz-Boogie fusion?
After watching King Kong get
shot to pieces by the Army Air
Corps, the lights dimmed and Bill
Graham mumbled a welcome to a
trio of original San Francisco
rockers, collectively Hot Tuna.
Performing sans Pap John
Creach's violin input, the
Jefferson Airplane offshoot group
sounded as good as ever, playing
and jamming for well over two
hours. Hot Tuna is a competent
country blues-band, but as if to
query "How country can you get
living in the Santa Cruz
Mountains?" the group threw in a

couple hard rockers to the delight
of the concertgoers.
