Kleindienst Denies Perjury Charge
WASHINGTON — Former Atty. Gen. Richard G.
Kleindienst denies he committed perjury by failing to tell
the Senate about President Nixon's order to drop the ITT
case and his own threat to resign rather than obey.
Kleindienst repeatedly stated under oath during 1972
hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee that there
was no White House pressure on him to halt the antitrust
suits against International Telephone & Telegraph Corp.
He acknowledged in a statement yesterday that Nixon
telephoned him on April 19, 1971, and, "without any
discussion, ordered me to drop the appeal" of one of the
three parallel lawsuits.
He defended his Senate testimony by saying he "was
not asked whether I had had any contacts with the White
House at the time of this decision, and I did not deny any
such contacts."
But an examination of the two volumes of the hearing
record shows that Kleindienst was asked repeatedly about
the sequence of events on April 19.
And he was asked several times if he had ever had any
contacts with the White House concerning the ITT case.
He repeatedly denied any contacts amounting to
pressure or directions and conceded only that the matter
may have been mentioned in some of the many casual
conversations he had with White House officials.
Kleindienst disclosed for the first time that the
controversy forced him to the brink of resigning.
By his account, former presidential adviser John D.
Ehrlichman called him on April 19 "and stated that the
President directed me not to file the appeal in the Grinnell
case ... I informed him that we had determined to take
that appeal, and that he should so inform the President."
Kleindienst said Nixon subsequently "changed his mind."
Meir To Meet Nixon
WASHINGTON — Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir
arrived here yesterday saying she is seeking clarification
from President Nixon of the U.S. position on opening
negotiations for a Middle East settlement.
While Meir was stepping off a jet from Tel Aviv,
Egyptian Foreign Minister Ismail Fahmy was meeting with
Nixon.
Meir told reporters that relations between her country
and the United States are very friendly, but she noted that
problems arise frequently between friends.
"There are problems that have to be clarified," Meir
said. However, she said it was "an oversimplification" to
suggest that the United States has exerted undue pressure
on her country concerning a settlement with the Arabs.
Meir will meet today with President Nixon and
Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger. She initiated the
visit to the United States after learning that Kissinger was
planning a trip next week to several Arab capitals and
after Fahmy asked to see Nixon in Washington.
Ford Hearings Open
WASHINGTON — The chairman of the Senate Rules
Committee said yesterday the FBI probe of Vice
President-designate Gerald R. Ford has disclosed "things
that will certainly raise questions" when Ford's
confirmation hearings open today.
However, the panel's ranking Republican said he has
seen nothing in the FBI files that will jeopardize
congressional approval of Ford as the successor to the
resigned Spiro T. Agnew.
Sen. Howard W. Cannon, D-Nev., the chairman, and
Sen. Marlow Cook, R-Ky., talked to reporters after a
closed session of the committee. Cannon has read more
than 1700 pages of raw FBI data on Ford and Cook is still
reading them.

Cannon said the questions deal with "the laundering of
campaign funds" and other matters.
Asked if he had found anything in the FBI files that
might be embarrassing to Ford, Cannon replied, "I don't
think I should make a comment about that."
Cook said he doesn't think anything embarrassing will
turn up.
Both said they believe Ford is the most investigated
nominee in the nation's history.
Weicker Reveals Media Memo
WASHINGTON — Sen. Lowell P. Weicker, R-Conn.,
revealed last night a White House memorandum suggesting
that three government regulatory agencies be used to quell
what the administration considered unfair treatment by
the news media.
Weicker said that the memorandum, written by Jeb S.
Magruder, recommended that the Internal Revenue
Service, the Justice Department antitrust division and the
Federal Communications Commission be used as a way to
control the news media.
The memorandum, dated Oct. 17, 1969, was titled
"The Shotgun Versus the Rifle," and was intended for
White House chief of staff H.R. Haldeman.
Rebozo Defends Transaction
MIAMI — C.G. "Bebe" Rebozo defended yesterday his
handling of a $100,000 Nixon campaign contribution
from billionaire Howard Hughes, the Miami Herald
reported in a copyrighted story for today's editions.
Rebozo said he informed Rose Mary Woods, President
Nixon's personal secretary, about the contribution
"shortly after" receiving the money in 1970. But he said
he didnot tell Nixon of the contribution until "after the
1972 election, on one of his visits" to Key Biscayne.
"I knew I had to tell him and I knew that Rose hadn't
told him," Rebozo was quoted as telling Herald reporters.
"I couldn't sit there forever with this money without at
least letting him know about it."
Rebozo said, "Money means nothing to him [Nixon]. I
don't think he has ever signed a check himself."
Rebozo said a 12-week investigation by the Internal
Revenue Service had cleared him of any wrongdoing in
handling the $100,000 contribution.
Agnew Pays $10,000 Fine
WASHINGTON — Former Vice President Spiro T.
Agnew has paid the $10,000 court fine imposed upon him
after he pleaded no contest to a tax evasion charge.
U.S. Atty. Gen. George Beall of Maryland told the
Justice Department that he received Agnew's personal
certified check in the mail yesterday.
Agnew, who resigned from office Oct. 10 in a
compromise with federal prosecutors, was also sentenced
to three years of unsupervised probation after he entered
the no-contest plea.
The federal prosecutors agreed not to bring further
charges against him.
Agnew is still subject to civil suits by the Internal
Revenue Service to recover overdue taxes.
U.S,. Studies Dairy Contributions
WASHINGTON — Federal investigators are looking
into a sworn allegation that the nation's largest dairy
co-operative used bogus legal fees to hide illegal corporate
"political contributions."
The amount of the alleged gifts and what became of
them remain uncertain. The matter is being investigated
by the Senate Watergate committee, the Watergate
prosecution force, the FBI, the Internal Revenue Service
and the General Accounting Office.

The allegation was made by Joseph A. Rose Jr., a San
Antonio, Tex., lawyer who was fired from his job with the
Associated Milk Producers Inc. in early September.
Rose said illegal money went as legal fees from the
milk producers to Stuart Russell, who secretly converted
the fees to cash and checks and returned them to Robert
Lilly, the chief staff officer of the co-op's influential
political arm.
Rose said Russell told him the money was for
"political contributions," but that Lilly left open the
possibility that the money might have gone for some
other purpose.
White, Famous Cardiologist, Dies
BOSTON Dr. Paul Dudley White, one of the world's
leading heart specialists, died yesterday at the age of 87.
A spokesman for Massachusetts General Hospital said
White died of complications related to a recent stroke. His
health had begun to fail following a stroke last June and
he was hospitalized in August to have two blood clots
removed from his brain.
When President Dwight D. Eisenhower suffered a heart
attack in 1955, Dr. White was named the President's chief
medical consultant.
Colleagues credit White with doing more to stimulate
heart research and heart care than any other physician of

his time.
Exxon Rations Gas
HOUSTON — Exxon Co. USA announced yesterday it
will begin allocating gasoline to all of its service stations
east of the Rocky Mountains today because of the
shortage of foreign crude oil.
Like most of the other major oil companies, Exxon
had its dealers on allocation during the early summer
period of tight gasoline supplies but it suspended the
program in July.
The programs were instituted under the government's
voluntary allocation guidelines and provided dealers with
a specified percentage of gasoline figured from their sales
during a base period.
Exxon said the resumption of its allocation program
was designed to assure a fair distribution of supplies and
was dictated by reduced refinery runs resulting from
shortages of foreign crude.
