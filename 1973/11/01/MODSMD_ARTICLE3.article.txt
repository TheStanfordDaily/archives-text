# Surgeons To Appear In 'Legal Death' Case
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN First of Two Parts 
A murder case in which the victim's
heart was used in a transplant could
end with a verdict that would set a
landmark definition of "legal death."
Alameda County Deputy Dist.
Atty. Albert W. Meloling has asked
Stanford heart surgeons Dr. Norman
Shumway and Dr. Eugene Dong to
give their opinions about what
constitutes "death" in the trial of
34-year-old Andrew D. Lyons accused
of the Sept. 10 slaying of Samuel M.
Moore, 29, of Oakland.
John Cruikshank, Lyons' attorney,
claimed during preliminary hearings
that his client cannot be charged with

murder because the victim's heart was
still beating when he was declared
dead.
Meloling disagrees, and says he will
show that the victim met criteria
established by a Harvard University
Medical School panel for "brain
death" before the heart was removed.
'I Shot Him.'
Lyons is accused of first-degree
murder in the Moore case. Moore's
body was found early in the morning
of Sept. 10 in Lyons' apartment.
Lyons reportedly told police, "I shot
him."
A .22 caliber bullet from a handgun
had entered Moore's brain. He was in a
coma when he arrived at Highland
Hospital in Oakland.
With Moore's condition worsening,
Dr. Robert Burns, the chief surgical
resident at Highland, called Shumway.
They originally decided to move
Moore to Stanford to be near a
potential recipient. This would have
sidestepped an Alameda County policy
that forbids removal of organs from
apparent homicide victims until an
autopsy is completed, as Moore would
have been considered alive when he
left the county.
However, a similar problem might
have occurred here. Santa Clara
County Coroner John Hauser said the
Medical Center and the county agreed
three years ago not to use homicide
victims as potential transplant donors.
During the afternoon of Sept. 10, a
"misunderstanding" occurred,
according to Alameda County chief
deputy coroner Roland Prahl, which
eventually led to the removal of
Moore's heart in preparation for the
transplant.
Burns claims the doctors received
permission to take the heart to
Stanford, but Prahl says the county
gave permission only for Shumway to
bring the recipient to Oakland to
perform the transplant.
Prahl claimed that Alameda
officials only granted permission for
the transplant in Oakland because
Oakland lacked facilities for the
operation — thus insuring the
operation would not take place.
However, because of the

"misunderstanding," Shumway had
already chosen a recipient and began
preparing the patient by the next day.
At that point, Prahl gave the go-ahead
for removal of Moore's heart and
transportation of the heart to
Stanford, although he said he foresaw
legal difficulties stemming from the
decision.
Moore's mother and wife, told of
his hopeless condition, gave their
permission, and on Sept. 12,
physicians declared Moore dead using
the brain-death criteria: inability to

breathe spontaneously, no brain
activity recorded by
electroencephalograms made 24 hours
apart and lack of response to
stimulation.
Shortly after 10 a.m. Moore's
still-beating heart was removed, and
the life-support system, which
apparently had kept him "alive" for
the past two days, was disconnected.
The Alameda County coroner listed
the cause of death as massive brain
damage due to a .22 caliber bullet in
the head.

murder in the Moore case. Moore's
body was found early in the morning
of Sept. 10 in Lyons' apartment.
Lyons reportedly told police, "I shot
him."
A .22 caliber bullet from a handgun
had entered Moore's brain. He was in a
coma when he arrived at Highland
Hospital in Oakland.
With Moore's condition worsening,
Dr. Robert Burns, the chief surgical
resident at Highland, called Shumway.
They originally decided to move
Moore to Stanford to be near a
potential recipient. This would have
sidestepped an Alameda County policy
that forbids removal of organs from
apparent homicide victims until an
autopsy is completed, as Moore would
have been considered alive when he
left the county.
However, a similar problem might
have occurred here. Santa Clara
County Coroner John Hauser said the
Medical Center and the county agreed
three years ago not to use homicide
victims as potential transplant donors.
During the afternoon of Sept. 10, a
"misunderstanding" occurred,
according to Alameda County chief
deputy coroner Roland Prahl, which
eventually led to the removal of
Moore's heart in preparation for the
transplant.
Burns claims the doctors received
permission to take the heart to
Stanford, but Prahl says the county
gave permission only for Shumway to
bring the recipient to Oakland to
perform the transplant.
Prahl claimed that Alameda
officials only granted permission for
the transplant in Oakland because
Oakland lacked facilities for the
operation — thus insuring the
operation would not take place.
However, because of the

"misunderstanding," Shumway had
already chosen a recipient and began
preparing the patient by the next day.
At that point, Prahl gave the go-ahead
for removal of Moore's heart and
transportation of the heart to
Stanford, although he said he foresaw
legal difficulties stemming from the
decision.
Moore's mother and wife, told of
his hopeless condition, gave their
permission, and on Sept. 12,
physicians declared Moore dead using
the brain-death criteria: inability to

breathe spontaneously, no brain
activity recorded by
electroencephalograms made 24 hours
apart and lack of response to
stimulation.
Shortly after 10 a.m. Moore's
still-beating heart was removed, and
the life-support system, which
apparently had kept him "alive" for
the past two days, was disconnected.
The Alameda County coroner listed
the cause of death as massive brain
damage due to a .22 caliber bullet in
the head.
A murder case in which the victim's
heart was used in a transplant could
end with a verdict that would set a
landmark definition of "legal death."
Alameda County Deputy Dist.
Atty. Albert W. Meloling has asked
Stanford heart surgeons Dr. Norman
Shumway and Dr. Eugene Dong to
give their opinions about what
constitutes "death" in the trial of
34-year-old Andrew D. Lyons accused
of the Sept. 10 slaying of Samuel M.
Moore, 29, of Oakland.
John Cruikshank, Lyons' attorney,
claimed during preliminary hearings
that his client cannot be charged with

murder because the victim's heart was
still beating when he was declared
dead.
Meloling disagrees, and says he will
show that the victim met criteria
established by a Harvard University
Medical School panel for "brain
death" before the heart was removed.
