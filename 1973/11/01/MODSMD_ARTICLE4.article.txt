# African Famine Fund Meals Begin Today
## 
### ANDREW BRIDGES 
Students here will begin a plan
today to raise funds for the African
Famine Relief Fund by selling
home-delivered meals to faculty, staff
and students and to residents of Palo
Alto.
The drive, sponsored locally by the
ASSU and the Black Students Union,
will raise money for millions of people
suffering from famine in
drought-stricken areas of Africa.
Other groups involved in the effort
include Operation PUSH (People
United to Save Humanity) and RAINS
(Relief for Africans In Need in the
Senal).
Twenty-five countries in Africa
suffer from the drought which has
lasted seven years. The hargest hit
areas include Mauritania, Mali, Upper
Volta, Niger, Chad and Senegal. Last

spring was a critical time for these
areas; lack of rain since then has
caused severe adverse effects in the
region. It is estimated that 30 million
persons are directly affected by the
famine.
Big Daddy's Idea
"Big Daddy" Dave McCullum, chef
at the Faculty Club here, conceived
the idea of the local fund-raising
effort, but students have been
managing the entire operation.
Spearheading the effort are ASSU Vice
President Charles Ogletree, Brenda
Young, Linda Mitchell, Elizabeth
Larkam, Mary Gallagher and Renee
Raimondi.
Rather than choosing a traditional
charity structure for the drive,
McCullum set it up as a business-type
venture with all the profits going to
the fund. "Our students aren't out
asking for money; they're earning it to
support the relief fund," explained
McCullum, who said he has invested a
considerable sum of money in
purchasing the supplies of food to be
served.
$1.50 Price
The price of the meals is $1.50, not
$2.50 as previously reported in the
Daily. After paying for the basic cost
of the food, all the money will be
deposited in a trust fund to be turned
over to the African Famine Relief
Fund.
The money will then be used to
supply the needy areas with food and
supplies. The Black Students Union
will also pursue other fund-raising
ventures in the future.
To order meals, one may call
322-5794 before 8:30 each evening.
Meals will be delivered to the
consumer's home or room at a
specified time between 9 p.m. and
midnight. Southern fried chicken,
barbeque ribs and shack fried fish are
the featured entrees, with french fries
and cole slaw supplied with each meal.

McCullum set it up as a business-type
venture with all the profits going to
the fund. "Our students aren't out
asking for money; they're earning it to
support the relief fund," explained
McCullum, who said he has invested a
considerable sum of money in
purchasing the supplies of food to be
served.
$1.50 Price
The price of the meals is $1.50, not
$2.50 as previously reported in the
Daily. After paying for the basic cost
of the food, all the money will be
deposited in a trust fund to be turned
over to the African Famine Relief
Fund.
The money will then be used to
supply the needy areas with food and
supplies. The Black Students Union
will also pursue other fund-raising
ventures in the future.
To order meals, one may call
322-5794 before 8:30 each evening.
Meals will be delivered to the
consumer's home or room at a
specified time between 9 p.m. and
midnight. Southern fried chicken,
barbeque ribs and shack fried fish are
the featured entrees, with french fries
and cole slaw supplied with each meal.

FEAST FOR FAMINE — "Big Daddy" Dave McCullum, Faculty Club chef,
conceived the idea of a catering service to raise money for the African Famine
Relief Fund. Students will begin the fund raising effort today by selling meals
for $1.50 apiece.
Students here will begin a plan
today to raise funds for the African
Famine Relief Fund by selling
home-delivered meals to faculty, staff
and students and to residents of Palo
Alto.
The drive, sponsored locally by the
ASSU and the Black Students Union,
will raise money for millions of people
suffering from famine in
drought-stricken areas of Africa.
Other groups involved in the effort
include Operation PUSH (People
United to Save Humanity) and RAINS
(Relief for Africans In Need in the
Senal).
Twenty-five countries in Africa
suffer from the drought which has
lasted seven years. The hargest hit
areas include Mauritania, Mali, Upper
Volta, Niger, Chad and Senegal. Last

spring was a critical time for these
areas; lack of rain since then has
caused severe adverse effects in the
region. It is estimated that 30 million
persons are directly affected by the
famine.
Big Daddy's Idea
"Big Daddy" Dave McCullum, chef
at the Faculty Club here, conceived
the idea of the local fund-raising
effort, but students have been
managing the entire operation.
Spearheading the effort are ASSU Vice
President Charles Ogletree, Brenda
Young, Linda Mitchell, Elizabeth
Larkam, Mary Gallagher and Renee
Raimondi.
Rather than choosing a traditional
charity structure for the drive,
McCullum set it up as a business-type
venture with all the profits going to
the fund. "Our students aren't out
asking for money; they're earning it to
support the relief fund," explained
McCullum, who said he has invested a
