# Students Fight Move Of German Campus
## 
### JANET SANDERS 
The question of whether or not the
University will retain its campus in
Beutelsbach, Germany, will reach a
crucial stage next Thursday night
when the Committee for Foreign
Studies Programs (CFSP) will confront
students backing the overseas project.
"I don't think the program
warrants the financial losses it has
suffered," said Don Price, Overseas
Studies financial director. He pointed
out that the University is losing
approximately $80,000 per year on
the German program alone.
Before making any decisions about
the campus' precarious future,
however, the committee will hold an

open meeting Nov. 6 at 7:30 p.m. in
the Tresidder large lounge.
"We want to find out why students
coming back from Germany are so
euphoric about their stay," said Price.
Petitions
Some former Beutelsbach students
are already circulating petitions and
organizing support in preparation for
next week's meeting.
Senior Allen Stewart said he had
collected over 150 signatures of people
favoring retention of the campus. He
has also planned a meeting for 8:30
Monday night in the Tresidder large
lounge to prepare for the committee
meeting.
