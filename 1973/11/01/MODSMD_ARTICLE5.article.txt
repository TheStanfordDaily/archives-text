# Students Fight Move Of German Campus
## 
### JANET SANDERS 
The question of whether or not the
University will retain its campus in
Beutelsbach, Germany, will reach a
crucial stage next Thursday night
when the Committee for Foreign
Studies Programs (CFSP) will confront
students backing the overseas project.
"I don't think the program
warrants the financial losses it has
suffered," said Don Price, Overseas
Studies financial director. He pointed
out that the University is losing
approximately $80,000 per year on
the German program alone.
Before making any decisions about
the campus' precarious future,
however, the committee will hold an

open meeting Nov. 6 at 7:30 p.m. in
the Tresidder large lounge.
"We want to find out why students
coming back from Germany are so
euphoric about their stay," said Price.
Petitions
Some former Beutelsbach students
are already circulating petitions and
organizing support in preparation for
next week's meeting.
Senior Allen Stewart said he had
collected over 150 signatures of people
favoring retention of the campus. He
has also planned a meeting for 8:30
Monday night in the Tresidder large
lounge to prepare for the committee
meeting.
The CFSP has done its own
preparations in the last two weeks. Its
report on the financial situation in
Beutelsbach reveals that the University
loses approximately $217 to $250 per
student every quarter.
The primary reason for the
financial losses is the devaluation of
the U.S. dollar. German inflation and
the shifting exchange rate of dollars
and German marks has resulted in a
$100,000 increase in expenses for the
German campus.
Steadily dropping student
enrollment has not seriously affected
Stanford-in-Germany. In feet, Price
claims that "the more students we
send, the more we have to pay."
The Beutelsbach backers contend
that the "cost-overruns" should not
decide the future of their campus.

The committee is expecting
Beutelsbach to be self-sufficient when
the University budget here is not,"
said senior Jerry Nelson. Pointing out
that the University relies on outside
funds to pay for the educational costs
which student tuition cannot cover, he
said that it should likewise compensate
for the financial losses of the overseas
campus.
Nelson added that a more energetic
search should be undertaken for
private grants.
Although the students were
adamant about retaining the campus at
its present location, Stewart said that
they were "not inflexible about
changing the present academic
program."
"But the alternatives have to be less
costly," said Price.
