# Primate Center Will Permit Scientific Observation
## 
### JOAN HINMAN 
The concrete walls of the country's newest and
largest primate observation facility were raised in
the hills behind the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center last week.
The Stanford Outdoor Primate Facility will allow
scientists to observe chimpanzees in an experimental
setting simulating conditions in the wild.
The six-acre arena will be divided into four
one-and-a-half-acre quadrants, each inhabited by a
different group of animals.
"Gombe West," as the center is called, was first
conceived in 1960 when Dr. David Hamburg of the
Psychiatry Department obtained the 28-acre site for
the center. Later, Hamburg, in conjunction with the
Human Biology program, was responsible for
bringing primatologist Dr. Jane van Lawick-Goodall
to the University to teach.
Gombe Stream
Gombe West's name is derived from the Gombe
Stream Research Center in Tanzania, where Goodall
is scientific director. She has studied chimpanzees at
Gombe for 13 years, and at present coordinates a
program which each year sends 10 human biology
students to Gombe to study chimpanzees.
"One of the tremendous advantages of Gombe
West is as an educational facility," stated Goodall.
"We expect a great deal of student involvement,
both undergraduate and graduate."
Goodall explained that the chimps will also be
used for researching possible biochemical bases of
behavior in humans, by examining blood and urine
samples.
Ideal Animals
Chimpanzees are the ideal animals for such
experimentation, said Goodall, because both
biochemically and anatomically the chimp is man's

closest relative. An adult male chimpanzee may
weigh between 120 and 140 pounds and stand four
feet tall. Although smaller than man, the chimp has
muscle fiber six times stronger.
Assistant Provost Alan Grundman, one of the
project coordinators, remarked that while motorists
may drive leisurely and safely through roving groups
of lions at parks like Lion Country Safari, they
would be endangered by a troop of roaming chimps.
"They'd rip the car apart if they felt like it,"
Grundman noted.
Two groups of chimps will move into Gombe
West's first two quadrants during December and
January. One group of seven chimps is presently
living on an island at Lion Country Safari. The other
group of four chimps is now kept at Stanford
Research Institute (SRI) by Dr. Lawrence Pinneo.
First Residents
SRI chimps Willy, Topsy, Bashful and Babu are
likely to be the first residents of Gombe West. At
present the four are kept in a cyclone-fenced
enclosure about the size of a tennis court. Despite
strong bars and a series of padlocks, the chimps have
staged what Pinneo calls "eight escapes and seven
attempts."
Baby, the infant of the group, was originally the
pet of a Woodside family. Pinneo succeeded in
persuading the family to give him up while the
chimp was still young enough to be introduced to a
chimp family. After several months. Baby was
gradually adopted by Bashful, the dominant female
of the group.
Although the SRI chimps are fed twice a day
with such diverse delicacies as peanut butter
sandwiches and raw onions, chimps in the wild
spend most of their day foraging for food. Because
they cannot forage here, Goodall explained, the

"major problem for primates in captivity is
boredom."
To alleviate this problem, devices have been
designed which will require a chimp to drop a stone
in a hole, or poke with a stick to cause a piece of
food to drop out of a box. In this way the chimps
will be given their food over a period of hours rather
than in one or two large feedings.
"What we really hope is that if this is successful
the idea w<" sweep through the entire zoo system,
both in the United States and in Europe," said
Goodall.
Along with the feeding toys, the Gombe West
chimps will be provided with 20-foot high platforms
for play and sleep, along with oak trees natural to
the site. Escapes will be prevented by 16-foot walls,
and 20-acres of surrounding open space will prevent
intrusion.
Less Humid
The climate here is less humid than that of
Tanzania, but the chimps, who have never lived in
the wild, should be able to adapt easily. Because
chimps are succeptible to respiratory diseases,
heated sleeping quarters will be available.
At present only two of the four planned
quadrants are funded, so the first projected change
in the facility will be the completion of the second
two quadrants. If built, one of these quadrants may
house baboons rather than chimps. Also, abnormal
chimps may be introduced into normal groups on an
experimental basis.
"The country's full of neurotic, psychotic
chimps," commented Goodall. She said a period
spent in a place such as Gombe West might help to
stabilize abnormal animals.
Although not designed as a zoo, the Stanford
Outdoor Primate Facility does include plans for
visits by the public.

used for researching possible biochemical bases of
behavior in humans, by examining blood and urine
samples.
Ideal Animals
Chimpanzees are the ideal animals for such
experimentation, said Goodall, because both
biochemically and anatomically the chimp is man's

closest relative. An adult male chimpanzee may
weigh between 120 and 140 pounds and stand four
feet tall. Although smaller than man, the chimp has
muscle fiber six times stronger.
Assistant Provost Alan Grundman, one of the
project coordinators, remarked that while motorists
may drive leisurely and safely through roving groups
of lions at parks like Lion Country Safari, they
would be endangered by a troop of roaming chimps.
"They'd rip the car apart if they felt like it,"
Grundman noted.
Two groups of chimps will move into Gombe
West's first two quadrants during December and
January. One group of seven chimps is presently
living on an island at Lion Country Safari. The other
group of four chimps is now kept at Stanford
Research Institute (SRI) by Dr. Lawrence Pinneo.
First Residents
SRI chimps Willy, Topsy, Bashful and Babu are
likely to be the first residents of Gombe West. At
present the four are kept in a cyclone-fenced
enclosure about the size of a tennis court. Despite
strong bars and a series of padlocks, the chimps have
staged what Pinneo calls "eight escapes and seven
attempts."
Baby, the infant of the group, was originally the
pet of a Woodside family. Pinneo succeeded in
persuading the family to give him up while the
chimp was still young enough to be introduced to a
chimp family. After several months. Baby was
gradually adopted by Bashful, the dominant female
of the group.
Although the SRI chimps are fed twice a day
with such diverse delicacies as peanut butter
sandwiches and raw onions, chimps in the wild
spend most of their day foraging for food. Because
they cannot forage here, Goodall explained, the

"major problem for primates in captivity is
boredom."
To alleviate this problem, devices have been
designed which will require a chimp to drop a stone
in a hole, or poke with a stick to cause a piece of
food to drop out of a box. In this way the chimps
will be given their food over a period of hours rather
than in one or two large feedings.
"What we really hope is that if this is successful
the idea w<" sweep through the entire zoo system,
both in the United States and in Europe," said
Goodall.
Along with the feeding toys, the Gombe West
chimps will be provided with 20-foot high platforms
for play and sleep, along with oak trees natural to
the site. Escapes will be prevented by 16-foot walls,
and 20-acres of surrounding open space will prevent
intrusion.
Less Humid
The climate here is less humid than that of
Tanzania, but the chimps, who have never lived in
the wild, should be able to adapt easily. Because
chimps are succeptible to respiratory diseases,
heated sleeping quarters will be available.
At present only two of the four planned
quadrants are funded, so the first projected change
in the facility will be the completion of the second
two quadrants. If built, one of these quadrants may
house baboons rather than chimps. Also, abnormal
chimps may be introduced into normal groups on an
experimental basis.
"The country's full of neurotic, psychotic
chimps," commented Goodall. She said a period
spent in a place such as Gombe West might help to
stabilize abnormal animals.
Although not designed as a zoo, the Stanford
Outdoor Primate Facility does include plans for
visits by the public.

PENSIVE PRIMATES — These two chimpanzees ponder their immediate future
which is likely to be spent at the new Gombe West primate facility being built
behind the linear Accelerator. The facility will be the largest of its kind in the
United States.
The concrete walls of the country's newest and
largest primate observation facility were raised in
the hills behind the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center last week.
The Stanford Outdoor Primate Facility will allow
scientists to observe chimpanzees in an experimental
setting simulating conditions in the wild.
The six-acre arena will be divided into four
one-and-a-half-acre quadrants, each inhabited by a
different group of animals.
"Gombe West," as the center is called, was first
conceived in 1960 when Dr. David Hamburg of the
Psychiatry Department obtained the 28-acre site for
the center. Later, Hamburg, in conjunction with the
Human Biology program, was responsible for
bringing primatologist Dr. Jane van Lawick-Goodall
to the University to teach.
Gombe Stream
Gombe West's name is derived from the Gombe
Stream Research Center in Tanzania, where Goodall
is scientific director. She has studied chimpanzees at
Gombe for 13 years, and at present coordinates a
program which each year sends 10 human biology
students to Gombe to study chimpanzees.
"One of the tremendous advantages of Gombe
West is as an educational facility," stated Goodall.
"We expect a great deal of student involvement,
both undergraduate and graduate."

strong bars and a series of padlocks, the chimps have
staged what Pinneo calls "eight escapes and seven
attempts."
Baby, the infant of the group, was originally the
pet of a Woodside family. Pinneo succeeded in
persuading the family to give him up while the
chimp was still young enough to be introduced to a
chimp family. After several months. Baby was
gradually adopted by Bashful, the dominant female
of the group.
Although the SRI chimps are fed twice a day
with such diverse delicacies as peanut butter
sandwiches and raw onions, chimps in the wild
spend most of their day foraging for food. Because
they cannot forage here, Goodall explained, the

"major problem for primates in captivity is
boredom."
To alleviate this problem, devices have been
designed which will require a chimp to drop a stone
in a hole, or poke with a stick to cause a piece of
food to drop out of a box. In this way the chimps
will be given their food over a period of hours rather
than in one or two large feedings.
"What we really hope is that if this is successful
the idea w<" sweep through the entire zoo system,
both in the United States and in Europe," said
Goodall.
Along with the feeding toys, the Gombe West
chimps will be provided with 20-foot high platforms
for play and sleep, along with oak trees natural to
the site. Escapes will be prevented by 16-foot walls,
and 20-acres of surrounding open space will prevent
intrusion.
Less Humid
The climate here is less humid than that of
Tanzania, but the chimps, who have never lived in
the wild, should be able to adapt easily. Because
chimps are succeptible to respiratory diseases,
heated sleeping quarters will be available.
At present only two of the four planned
quadrants are funded, so the first projected change
in the facility will be the completion of the second
two quadrants. If built, one of these quadrants may
house baboons rather than chimps. Also, abnormal
chimps may be introduced into normal groups on an
experimental basis.
"The country's full of neurotic, psychotic
chimps," commented Goodall. She said a period
spent in a place such as Gombe West might help to
stabilize abnormal animals.
Although not designed as a zoo, the Stanford
Outdoor Primate Facility does include plans for
visits by the public.

PENSIVE PRIMATES — These two chimpanzees ponder their immediate future
which is likely to be spent at the new Gombe West primate facility being built
behind the linear Accelerator. The facility will be the largest of its kind in the
United States.
The concrete walls of the country's newest and
largest primate observation facility were raised in
the hills behind the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center last week.
The Stanford Outdoor Primate Facility will allow
scientists to observe chimpanzees in an experimental
setting simulating conditions in the wild.
The six-acre arena will be divided into four
one-and-a-half-acre quadrants, each inhabited by a
different group of animals.
"Gombe West," as the center is called, was first
conceived in 1960 when Dr. David Hamburg of the
Psychiatry Department obtained the 28-acre site for
the center. Later, Hamburg, in conjunction with the
Human Biology program, was responsible for
bringing primatologist Dr. Jane van Lawick-Goodall
to the University to teach.
Gombe Stream
Gombe West's name is derived from the Gombe
Stream Research Center in Tanzania, where Goodall
is scientific director. She has studied chimpanzees at
Gombe for 13 years, and at present coordinates a
program which each year sends 10 human biology
students to Gombe to study chimpanzees.
"One of the tremendous advantages of Gombe
West is as an educational facility," stated Goodall.
"We expect a great deal of student involvement,
both undergraduate and graduate."
Goodall explained that the chimps will also be
used for researching possible biochemical bases of
behavior in humans, by examining blood and urine
samples.
Ideal Animals
Chimpanzees are the ideal animals for such
experimentation, said Goodall, because both
biochemically and anatomically the chimp is man's

closest relative. An adult male chimpanzee may
weigh between 120 and 140 pounds and stand four
feet tall. Although smaller than man, the chimp has
muscle fiber six times stronger.
Assistant Provost Alan Grundman, one of the
project coordinators, remarked that while motorists
may drive leisurely and safely through roving groups
of lions at parks like Lion Country Safari, they
would be endangered by a troop of roaming chimps.
"They'd rip the car apart if they felt like it,"
Grundman noted.
Two groups of chimps will move into Gombe
West's first two quadrants during December and
January. One group of seven chimps is presently
living on an island at Lion Country Safari. The other
group of four chimps is now kept at Stanford
Research Institute (SRI) by Dr. Lawrence Pinneo.
First Residents
SRI chimps Willy, Topsy, Bashful and Babu are
likely to be the first residents of Gombe West. At
present the four are kept in a cyclone-fenced
enclosure about the size of a tennis court. Despite
strong bars and a series of padlocks, the chimps have
staged what Pinneo calls "eight escapes and seven
attempts."
Baby, the infant of the group, was originally the
pet of a Woodside family. Pinneo succeeded in
persuading the family to give him up while the
