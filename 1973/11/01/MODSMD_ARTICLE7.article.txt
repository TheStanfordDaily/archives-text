## Again, Impeach 
### 
Last week, in the shock and uproar that followed
President Nixon's dismissal of Watergate Prosecutor
Archibald Cox and his announced intention to ignore a
court order, this newspaper called for impeachment.
"Nixon has shattered his own credibility as a defender of
the Republic," we said. "His retention of office jeopardizes
the survival of constitutional government in this nation."
Today we reiterate that call.
President Nixon has grudgingly complied with the Court
of Appeals' order to surrender nine Watergate tapes. But
Archibald Cox, fired for the conscientious execution of his
duties, remains fired; and Nixon refused to promise his
still-unnamed replacement prosecutor the functional
independence he denied Cox.
There is more, much more: an appalling litany of
allegations — and some incontrovertible facts — that have
stripped the nation of all confidence in its chief executive.
They must be set right:
—the secret, and possibly illegal, bombing of a neutral
country, Cambodia;
—the approval, never clearly withdrawn, of a domestic
security plan that mandated burglary and illegal wiretapping
of dissenters;
—the use of federal agencies to investigate and harass the
Administration's "enemies";
—the White House-ordered settlement, out of court, of
antitrust cases against Nixon re-election contributor ITT;
—the hikes in milk price supports and the reinstitution of
dairy product import quotas that all-too-quickly followed
campaign contributions form the dairy industry;
—the mysterious financing of Nixon's personal estates in
San Clemente and Key Biscayne;
—the withholding of evidence in the prosecution of
Daniel Ellsberg;
<—the obstruction of justice in the President's instructions
to ;aides H.R. Haldeman and John D. Ehrlichman to keep
secret the illegal actions of "plumbers" G. Gordon Liddy
and E. Howard Hunt;
—the possible obstruction of justice in the refusal to
cooperate with Cox's investigation;
;—and the large-scale impoundment of
cohgressionally-appropriated funds.
Only a fair and complete trial can fully satisfy the terrible
need for determining the President's innocence or guilt. We
call upon the House of Representatives to impeach Richard
Nixon, and we urge each voter to write his congressman with
the same request.
•As Nixon himself said Friday, "It's time for those who
are guilty to be prosecuted and for those who are innocent
toibe cleared."
