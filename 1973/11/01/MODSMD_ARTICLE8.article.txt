I(The following are excerpts
from a speech before the
Committee for Corporate Support
of.American Universities on Oct.
17\ 1973.)
►In reading Arthur H. Dean's
statement of August, 1970 for the
Cqfrimittee for Corporate Support
of* American Universities, I find
that the policies and guidelines
wftich were established in the
ea(ly years are still in effect — and
with one exception I commend
them to you as a sound program
foe the future.
."The only exception I would
make is the guideline stating that
corporate funds given to private
universities should be unrestricted
in J,heir use by the university.
;I supported that proposition
ten years ago because I, like the
other members of the committee,
wjp; a university trustee — and I
thought trustees knew best how a
corporate contribution should be
us&d and that trustees had
substantial control over how
funds were used. In retrospect,
that point was probably debatable
thfcn. It seems to me that it is even
more so today.
Corporate Interest
!l recognize that for the
uiflversity, unrestricted money is
most valuable. It allows the

trustees, or the administration, or
the faculty to undertake programs
which might otherwise not attract
financial support from the
outside. It does not necessarily
follow, however, that unrestricted
money, used as it has been used, is
always in the interest of the
corporation.
That, however, is precisely
what the corporate officer
considering a contribution to a
university should be thinking
about. Should our corporation
make an unrestricted contribution
and leave it to the trustees or the
administration or the faculty to
decide how the money should be
used, or do we have a
responsibility to our stockholders
to be sure the money contributed
will, in some defensible way,
benefit our corporation?
Fifteen or twenty years ago the
trustees of the major private
universities could and did play a
role in university policy. Most
trustees were also corporate
officers. It is quite understandable
then that we all felt comfortable
in recommending that corporate
funds be unrestricted.
Faculty Militants
The situation is vastly different
today. Almost every board of
trustees must have its members

selected from a wide array of
constituents: students, faculty,
alumni, various ethnic groups, etc.
Moreover, much of the power has
gone to the faculty, and too often
faculty decisions are determined
by a militant minority of the
faculty.
All this may be good for our
private universities. I do not
believe so, but that is not the
point I want to make with you
today. I believe the case for a
corporation giving unrestricted
funds to a private university can
no longer be supported...
Let me give you just one
example of what happened in the
late 19605.
Prestigious
Professor Richard Flacks, who
was a top intellectual figure in the
Students for a Democratic
Society, said this in 1969:
". . . data on the distribution
of student protest on American
campuses quite clearly show that
the student movement had its
origins at the highest quality state
universities and prestigious private
universities and colleges, that the
movement continues to have its
widest following on such
campuses, and that it has only
recently spread to schools of
lower prestige and quality."
If you want to be sure your
funds do not have this kind of
multiplying effect, restrict them
to those areas you believe are
educating the right kind of
professors.
Leadership
Another premise, and the only
one so far which might possibly
be used to justify unrestricted
corporate gifts, is that the great
private universities give distinctive
leadership to all of higher
education in America. This
premise sounded very convincing
to me in 1959. In 1973 I'm much
less sure.
Is kicking ROTC programs off
the campus the kind of leadership
we need?
Is prohibiting business from
recruiting on the campus the kind
of leadership we need?
Should these universities serve
as haven for radicals who want to
destroy the free enterprise
system?
Should students be taught that
American corporations are evil
and deserve to be brought under
government control?
Should a board of trustees sit
as sole judge of the social
responsibility of each American
corporation — and use this as a
basis for deciding whether its
stock should be held in the

university portfolio?
I say to you today, thank God
most of the colleges and
universities over this great country
of ours have not blindly followed
the lead of some of the "bell
cows" we touted ten or fifteen
years ago.
Clearly then, unrestricted
corporate contributions cannot be
supported on the basis of the
other guidelines this committee
has adopted. I do not believe
there is any way they can be
justified.
Some who argue for
unrestricted grants will say that
universities should be isolated,
"ivory tower" centers of learning
outside the affairs of the world.
There may be something to this
position — let's look at it.
Scholars
Some people like to call a
university a community of
scholars which, of course, it
should be. In a university these
scholars are grouped together in
Schools and Departments.
Sometime we find groupings of
scholars within the university who
are hostile to business and the free
enterprise system. All too often
these groupings tend to
perpetuate themselves because
they attract professors in the same
mold. Departments of Economics
are particularly vulnerable, as are
Departments of Religion and
other areas of the Humanities.
I happen to believe that such
hostile groups of scholars are, to a
large degree, responsible for the
anti-business bias of many of our
young people today. And I do not
believe it is in the corporate
interest to support them — which
is what we do to a greater or a
lesser degree with unrestricted
funds.
1 believe we will do more in the
interest of our corporations and
just as much for the universities
by being specific in designating
where our funds go.
A university is strong to the
extent its schools and
departments are strong. In the
future, let's focus our money and
our energy on those schools and
departments which are strong and
which also contribute in some
specific way to our individual
companies, or to the general
welfare of our free enterprise
system.

interest of our corporations and
just as much for the universities
by being specific in designating
where our funds go.
A university is strong to the
extent its schools and
departments are strong. In the
future, let's focus our money and
our energy on those schools and
departments which are strong and
which also contribute in some
specific way to our individual
companies, or to the general
welfare of our free enterprise
system.

I(The following are excerpts
from a speech before the
Committee for Corporate Support
of.American Universities on Oct.
17\ 1973.)
►In reading Arthur H. Dean's
statement of August, 1970 for the
Cqfrimittee for Corporate Support
of* American Universities, I find
that the policies and guidelines
wftich were established in the
ea(ly years are still in effect — and
with one exception I commend
them to you as a sound program
foe the future.
."The only exception I would
make is the guideline stating that
corporate funds given to private
universities should be unrestricted
in J,heir use by the university.
;I supported that proposition
ten years ago because I, like the
other members of the committee,
wjp; a university trustee — and I
thought trustees knew best how a
corporate contribution should be
us&d and that trustees had
substantial control over how
funds were used. In retrospect,
that point was probably debatable
thfcn. It seems to me that it is even
more so today.
Corporate Interest
!l recognize that for the
uiflversity, unrestricted money is
most valuable. It allows the

trustees, or the administration, or
the faculty to undertake programs
which might otherwise not attract
financial support from the
outside. It does not necessarily
follow, however, that unrestricted
money, used as it has been used, is
always in the interest of the
corporation.
That, however, is precisely
what the corporate officer
considering a contribution to a
university should be thinking
about. Should our corporation
make an unrestricted contribution
and leave it to the trustees or the
administration or the faculty to
decide how the money should be
used, or do we have a
responsibility to our stockholders
to be sure the money contributed
will, in some defensible way,
benefit our corporation?
Fifteen or twenty years ago the
trustees of the major private
universities could and did play a
role in university policy. Most
trustees were also corporate
officers. It is quite understandable
then that we all felt comfortable
in recommending that corporate
funds be unrestricted.
Faculty Militants
The situation is vastly different
today. Almost every board of
trustees must have its members

selected from a wide array of
constituents: students, faculty,
alumni, various ethnic groups, etc.
Moreover, much of the power has
gone to the faculty, and too often
faculty decisions are determined
by a militant minority of the
faculty.
All this may be good for our
private universities. I do not
believe so, but that is not the
point I want to make with you
today. I believe the case for a
corporation giving unrestricted
funds to a private university can
no longer be supported...
Let me give you just one
example of what happened in the
late 19605.
Prestigious
Professor Richard Flacks, who
was a top intellectual figure in the
Students for a Democratic
Society, said this in 1969:
". . . data on the distribution
of student protest on American
campuses quite clearly show that
the student movement had its
origins at the highest quality state
universities and prestigious private
universities and colleges, that the
movement continues to have its
widest following on such
campuses, and that it has only
recently spread to schools of
lower prestige and quality."
If you want to be sure your
funds do not have this kind of
multiplying effect, restrict them
to those areas you believe are
educating the right kind of
professors.
Leadership
Another premise, and the only
one so far which might possibly
be used to justify unrestricted
corporate gifts, is that the great
private universities give distinctive
leadership to all of higher
education in America. This
premise sounded very convincing
to me in 1959. In 1973 I'm much
less sure.
Is kicking ROTC programs off
the campus the kind of leadership
we need?
Is prohibiting business from
recruiting on the campus the kind
of leadership we need?
Should these universities serve
as haven for radicals who want to
destroy the free enterprise
system?
Should students be taught that
American corporations are evil
and deserve to be brought under
government control?
Should a board of trustees sit
as sole judge of the social
responsibility of each American
corporation — and use this as a
basis for deciding whether its
stock should be held in the

university portfolio?
I say to you today, thank God
most of the colleges and
universities over this great country
of ours have not blindly followed
the lead of some of the "bell
cows" we touted ten or fifteen
years ago.
Clearly then, unrestricted
corporate contributions cannot be
supported on the basis of the
other guidelines this committee
has adopted. I do not believe
there is any way they can be
justified.
Some who argue for
unrestricted grants will say that
universities should be isolated,
"ivory tower" centers of learning
outside the affairs of the world.
There may be something to this
position — let's look at it.
Scholars
Some people like to call a
university a community of
scholars which, of course, it
should be. In a university these
scholars are grouped together in
Schools and Departments.
Sometime we find groupings of
scholars within the university who
are hostile to business and the free
enterprise system. All too often
these groupings tend to
perpetuate themselves because
they attract professors in the same
mold. Departments of Economics
are particularly vulnerable, as are
Departments of Religion and
other areas of the Humanities.
I happen to believe that such
hostile groups of scholars are, to a
large degree, responsible for the
anti-business bias of many of our
young people today. And I do not
believe it is in the corporate
interest to support them — which
is what we do to a greater or a
lesser degree with unrestricted
funds.
1 believe we will do more in the
interest of our corporations and
just as much for the universities
by being specific in designating
where our funds go.
A university is strong to the
extent its schools and
departments are strong. In the
future, let's focus our money and
our energy on those schools and
departments which are strong and
which also contribute in some
specific way to our individual
companies, or to the general
welfare of our free enterprise
system.

these groupings tend to
perpetuate themselves because
they attract professors in the same
mold. Departments of Economics
are particularly vulnerable, as are
Departments of Religion and
other areas of the Humanities.
I happen to believe that such
hostile groups of scholars are, to a
large degree, responsible for the
anti-business bias of many of our
young people today. And I do not
believe it is in the corporate
interest to support them — which
is what we do to a greater or a
lesser degree with unrestricted
funds.
1 believe we will do more in the
interest of our corporations and
just as much for the universities
by being specific in designating
where our funds go.
A university is strong to the
extent its schools and
departments are strong. In the
future, let's focus our money and
our energy on those schools and
departments which are strong and
which also contribute in some
specific way to our individual
companies, or to the general
welfare of our free enterprise
system.

I(The following are excerpts
from a speech before the
Committee for Corporate Support
of.American Universities on Oct.
17\ 1973.)
►In reading Arthur H. Dean's
statement of August, 1970 for the
Cqfrimittee for Corporate Support
of* American Universities, I find
that the policies and guidelines
wftich were established in the
ea(ly years are still in effect — and
with one exception I commend
them to you as a sound program
foe the future.
."The only exception I would
make is the guideline stating that
corporate funds given to private
universities should be unrestricted
in J,heir use by the university.
;I supported that proposition
ten years ago because I, like the
other members of the committee,
wjp; a university trustee — and I
thought trustees knew best how a
corporate contribution should be
us&d and that trustees had
substantial control over how
funds were used. In retrospect,
that point was probably debatable
thfcn. It seems to me that it is even
more so today.
Corporate Interest
!l recognize that for the
uiflversity, unrestricted money is
most valuable. It allows the

trustees, or the administration, or
the faculty to undertake programs
which might otherwise not attract
financial support from the
outside. It does not necessarily
follow, however, that unrestricted
money, used as it has been used, is
always in the interest of the
corporation.
That, however, is precisely
what the corporate officer
considering a contribution to a
university should be thinking
about. Should our corporation
make an unrestricted contribution
and leave it to the trustees or the
administration or the faculty to
decide how the money should be
used, or do we have a
responsibility to our stockholders
to be sure the money contributed
will, in some defensible way,
benefit our corporation?
Fifteen or twenty years ago the
trustees of the major private
universities could and did play a
role in university policy. Most
trustees were also corporate
officers. It is quite understandable
then that we all felt comfortable
in recommending that corporate
funds be unrestricted.
Faculty Militants
The situation is vastly different
today. Almost every board of
trustees must have its members

selected from a wide array of
constituents: students, faculty,
alumni, various ethnic groups, etc.
Moreover, much of the power has
gone to the faculty, and too often
faculty decisions are determined
by a militant minority of the
faculty.
All this may be good for our
private universities. I do not
believe so, but that is not the
point I want to make with you
today. I believe the case for a
corporation giving unrestricted
funds to a private university can
no longer be supported...
Let me give you just one
example of what happened in the
late 19605.
Prestigious
Professor Richard Flacks, who
was a top intellectual figure in the
Students for a Democratic
Society, said this in 1969:
". . . data on the distribution
of student protest on American
campuses quite clearly show that
the student movement had its
origins at the highest quality state
universities and prestigious private
universities and colleges, that the
movement continues to have its
widest following on such
campuses, and that it has only
recently spread to schools of
lower prestige and quality."
If you want to be sure your
funds do not have this kind of
multiplying effect, restrict them
to those areas you believe are
educating the right kind of
professors.
Leadership
Another premise, and the only
one so far which might possibly
be used to justify unrestricted
corporate gifts, is that the great
private universities give distinctive
leadership to all of higher
education in America. This
premise sounded very convincing
to me in 1959. In 1973 I'm much
less sure.
Is kicking ROTC programs off
the campus the kind of leadership
we need?
Is prohibiting business from
recruiting on the campus the kind
of leadership we need?
Should these universities serve
as haven for radicals who want to
destroy the free enterprise
system?
Should students be taught that
American corporations are evil
and deserve to be brought under
government control?
Should a board of trustees sit
as sole judge of the social
responsibility of each American
corporation — and use this as a
basis for deciding whether its
stock should be held in the

university portfolio?
I say to you today, thank God
most of the colleges and
universities over this great country
of ours have not blindly followed
the lead of some of the "bell
cows" we touted ten or fifteen
years ago.
Clearly then, unrestricted
corporate contributions cannot be
supported on the basis of the
other guidelines this committee
has adopted. I do not believe
there is any way they can be
justified.
Some who argue for
unrestricted grants will say that
universities should be isolated,
"ivory tower" centers of learning
outside the affairs of the world.
There may be something to this
position — let's look at it.
Scholars
Some people like to call a
university a community of
scholars which, of course, it
should be. In a university these
scholars are grouped together in
Schools and Departments.
Sometime we find groupings of
scholars within the university who
are hostile to business and the free
enterprise system. All too often
these groupings tend to
perpetuate themselves because
they attract professors in the same
mold. Departments of Economics
are particularly vulnerable, as are
Departments of Religion and
other areas of the Humanities.
I happen to believe that such
hostile groups of scholars are, to a
large degree, responsible for the
anti-business bias of many of our
young people today. And I do not

is what we do to a greater or a
