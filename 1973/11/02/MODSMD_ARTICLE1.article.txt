### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
lixon nominated Ohio Republican
enator William B. Saxbe as attorney
eneral yesterday and promised full
idependence for a new special
/ atergate prosecutor, Texas trial
iwyer Leon Jaworski.
Nixon gave his personal assurance
nat he would not fire the new special
rosecutor, as he did Archibald Cox,
'ithout getting approval from
ongressional leaders of both parties.
The President appeared in the
/hite House briefing room to
nnounce the nomination of Saxbe to
til the vacancy caused by the
asignation Oct. 20 of Elliot L.
Richardson.
He left to Acting Atty. Gen. Robert
I. Bork the announcement of
aworski as "perhaps the best we
ould get for this very important
osition" of special prosecutor.
Bork said the 68-year-old Jaworski,
Democrat, would have all the
reedom and independence originally
>romised Cox and a renewed promise
>112 "the full cooperation of the
xecutive branch in the pursuit of his
investigations."
Additional Tapes
Bork was asked if it was clearly
.nderstood that Jaworski would be
ree to go to court to press for
dditional tapes or presidential papers
112 he deems it necessary.
"That is absolutely clear," Bork
eplied.
Cox refused to accept a summary
•112 taped White House conversations
iealing with Watergate rather than the
apes themselves. Nixon fired Cox and
stablished the prosecutor's office
nside the Justice Department.
Jaworski said his appointment "was
i call to duty."

"It was put on that basis," he said.
"With the conditions being what they
are — I'm talking about the prescribed
conditions — I felt I had no alternative
but to agree to serve."
Jaworski said the American people
are entitled to have some answers
without waiting forever, and "it's
going to be my purpose to try to
provide those answers as soon as I
can."
Jaworski said he hoped to meet
Monday with the staff left by Cox. He
said he will start out with the same
staff.
Congressional Input
Jaworski said if he encounters an
impasse with Nixon on any phase of
the Watergate investigation it will be
presented to the two senior majority
and minority members of both the
House and Senate Judiciary
committees for determination.
Nixon's pledge of independence for
Jaworski did not satisfy Sens. Adlai
Stevenson, D-111., and Birch Bayh,
D-Ind., sponsors of separate bills
providing for a court-appointed special
prosecutor.
"We've relied before on the
promises of the President, and
Congress has been burned," Stevenson
said. "There can be no independent
prosecutor without congressional
action."
House Speaker Carl Albert said the
legislation should proceed but did not
know what effect Jaworski's selection
would have.
Saxbe, 57, who already had
announced that he would not seek
another term in the Senate, said he
understood he was taking on the
attorney general's job in "difficult
times" when "the country is in a crisis
of leadership."

He said he was anxious that the
new special Watergate prosecutor
would go to work "without any
limitations." While he knew his job
was going to be difficult, he said, "I
have no reluctance and no doubts that
I can handle it."
Saxbe said Bork will remain as
solicitor general.
Jaworski is a senior partner in the
Houston law firm of Fulbright,
Crooker and Jaworski, where he has
been since 1951.
An experienced trial lawyer and
prosecutor, he was chief of the Nazi
war crimes trial section of the U.S.
Army in the European theater after
World War 11. He was president of the

American Bar Association during
1971-72, and was a friend and adviser
to former President Lyndon Johnson.
Political Conservative
Although he has never held public
office, Jaworski is regarded as a
judicial and political conservative. He
has backed establishment Democrats
in Texas, including Johnson and
former Texas Gov. John B. Connally,
now a Republican.
Saxbe, whom Nixon says he has
known for 25 years, was a speaker of
the House of Representatives in his
home state of Ohio and served as the
state's attorney general for two terms.
He has a law degree from Ohio State
University.
