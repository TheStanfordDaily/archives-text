# Protest Shopping Center Expansion
## Community Issues Demand Attention 
### 
>■ Jim Francesconi

In the days immediately
following the Chilean tragedy,
Stanford University held a
remarkable teach-in on the
situation there. As students left
Cubberley that evening and
wandered over to the coffeehouse
or their dorm lounges, they were
talking more about the Maryknoll
film, Campimento, than the
moving speech by Professor
Alegria. It was the story of
Chileans who desperately needed

a place to live; who took the
active steps of building a shanty
town on government property;
and who then transformed their
town into a real, viable
community of which all could be
proud.
I do not want to dwell on the
theme of the movie separate from
the reactions it evoked in much of
the Stanford student body.
Despite difference in language and
culture, here was a community to

which we could relate. We saw
young and old people working
and playing together for a cause
which they all felt was larger than
themselves. The quality of life for
all in the "campimento" — the
housing, schooling, recreational
facilities — was the issue, and in
its pursuit all others were
subordinated.
It is true that the quality of
our life here in the Midpeninsula
would improve if the men in
Washington who were indirectly
or directly responsible for Chile,
Cambodia, the cut in our
domestic programs for the sick
and poor, and Watergate were
removed from all positions of
power. But it is also true that our
quality of life will only improve if
we take more direct actions
within our surroundings to make
them more sensitive and
responsive to our real, human
needs.
It was around the issue of
housing and education, that the
Chileans were able to sustain the
long-term enthusiasm and
dedication necessary to bring
about significant social change.
Until we begin to talk about our
needs and the needs of the people
who live right here in the
Midpeninsula, we are engaging in a
series of "one night stands" as
social activists.
Local Causes
Let me mention two such local
"causes." At this time Palo Alto is
preparing to adopt its general plan

tvhich will determine the kind of
developments which will occur in
the next decade. Low income
housing, a ceiling on commercial
and industrial development, and
childcare facilities must .be
decided upon now if they are to
become realities later. The next
meeting at which such proposals
will be considered is Nov. 14 at
the Palo Alto City Hall.
Perhaps it is true that the city
will not heed too seriously the
advice of students that it knows
will be here only for four years.
But this should not serve as our
excuse for inaction and
uninvolvement on the local
political scene. For the fact of the
matter is that we are associated
with THE largest landholder on
the Midpeninsula and its second
largest employer — Stanford
University.
This brings us to the second
"cause" which should be brought
to the attention of the Stanford
Community.
Stanford Shopping Center
In December, 1972, Stanford
and its consultants from the
Rouse Corporation made a
proposal for the expansion of the
Stanford Shopping Center. As a
response a citizens action group
called People Planning for
Stanford was formed. Their
suggestions, which will be
outlined in a detailed report
shortly to be released, stand as an
alternative to the extensive and
expensive Stanford proposals.
Stanford is calling for a thirty
percent expansion of commercial
floor space with all its
ramifications on an already tight
housing market and overcrowded
highways. People Planning For
Stanford is advocating low and
moderate income housing on the
40 acre Willow Road site; a child
care facility; and an activities park
between Macy's and Bullock's
that would include an open air
cafe, an outdoor theatre, craft
booths, picnic tables and a
supervised play area for children.
The issue of the Shopping
Center will be an important one
throughout the next year.
Although at first glance it seems
to pale in comparison with the
dramatic events unfolding in
Chile, the Middle East or
Washington, it is a local initiative
that is crying for local concern.
The present Stanford Shopping
Center, just as are all shopping
centers, is a sterile, single-purpose
environment. The needs of people
to communicate socially,
culturally and politically are not
recognized.
American Symbol
In all these respects the
Shopping Center is a perfect
symbol of our America. We live in
a mass-produced, first-hand
society, light years away from
that campimento, in which we can
only relate to each other
economically and therefore
deficiently. The issue of the
Stanford Shopping Center is the
perfect place for members of the
Stanford Community to begin
their long-term drive for a more
humane world that will prove
hostile, rather than conducive, to
the Nixon's of this world.
