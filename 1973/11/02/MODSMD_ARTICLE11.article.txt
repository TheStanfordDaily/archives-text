# Satisfactory Care
## Cowell Services Defended 
### 
James B. McClenahan

Perhaps it would be useful for
me to add some additional
information and comments about
the Gynecological and
Contraceptive Care available at
Cowell. By way of background,
care for illnesses and problems of
a gynecological nature has been
available at Cowell for years and
since 1968 contraceptive care has
also been available, both as part of
the regular Student Health Service
program.
All of the physicians at Cowell
are available and able to provide
regular gynecological care, and do
so to a significant extent. If a
woman has an illness or symptoms
of this sort, she may come to
Cowell and be seen promptly (at
least within the hour) by one of j
our physicians, the appropriate
examinations and tests carried out
as indicated, and in a great
majority of cases the situation is
handled as would be any other
illness. Our physicians are
experienced in this kind of care
and most of these cases do not
have to be seen specifically by a
gynecologist.
The gynecologist at Cowell is
available for consultation for the
more complicated problems and is
also available to do some regular
gynecological and contraceptive
care. This physician, as well as
gynecologists at the Palo Alto
Medical Clinic, are available for
consultation within the hour, or in
some few days or weeks,
depending on the urgency of the
situation. Admittedly the system
does not work perfectly, but I am
not aware of patients who have
been mishandled or had "grave"
consequences (the "horror
stories" of a newspaper article)
because of undue delays inherent
in the current consultation/
referral arrangement.
Contraceptive Care
In the area of contraceptive
care, some aspects of this are
provided by all of our physicians;
not all of the doctors do lUD or
diaphragm insertion. We certainly
agree that contraception is an
important type of care. In order

to facilitate matching the patient
with the right doctor as regards
the type of contraception she
chooses, and in addition to set
aside adequate time for a
thorough examination; most of
the contraceptive care is set up
under an appointment system
with the various Health Service
physicians, or the gynecologist. It
is with this sort of care that
women will often times
experience a delay of three to
four weeks, especially in the fall
and spring quarters.
One practical measure which
can be helpful in easing the
waiting time situation is for the
women with appointments to let
us know as far ahead as possible if
they are not going to be able to
keep their appointment. During
the last academic year we had
some 360 unkept appointments or
people who cancelled so late that
the front office staff was unable
to find a replacement.
In an effort to improve our
gynecological and contraceptive
programs, this summer (prior to
our learning of the necessity of
Doctor Massey leaving the area
because of unexpected family
illness and concerns) one of our
physicians indicated an interest in
undertaking training to enable her
to provide lUD contraception,
and this has subsequently been
carried out. In addition, one of
our young staff nurses is currently

taking the Family Planning Nurse
Practitioner course at U.C. San
Francisco Medical Center.
Gynecologist Search
Doctor Jane Green who has
been working with Planned
Parenthood will be joining our
staff in the near future to help
with this sort of care, at least until
we are able to find a replacement
for Doctor Massey. In that regard,
efforts have been going on several
weeks to find a gynecologist for
Cowell.
In reference to the Daily article,
I would like to note specifically
that the implication that our front
office and receptionist staff are
callous (or insensitive) is, I feel,
unwarranted. Given that any of us
will occasionally have a bad day,
and given that sometimes a
patient will be pretty
unreasonable and demanding, I
think it is fair to say that the
young women in the front office
work hard to be helpful and
efficient.
The Health Service is set up
and funded to provide a wide
range of care â€” medical,
psychological, and preventative,
for all of the students. Our staff
does work to provide good
gynecological and contraceptive
care as an important part of the
responsibility.
