Political Asylum
Editor:
After the September coup in
Chile, the Argentine Embassy,
more than any other in Santiago,
was flooded with people seeking
political asylum. The embassy
doors were open at almost all
times, and the efforts of the
Chilean army and the carabineros
to impede the entry of refugees
were not as strong as efforts at
other embassies accepting refugee.
By Oct. 3, the number of persons
seeking asylum at the embassy
had reached 720, and it is
presumed that since then even
more people have come. Among
those seeking refuge have been
Argentines, Chileans, some 200
Brazilians and other Latin
Americans.
There have been substantial
delays in obtaining safe-conduct
passes from the Military-Junta —
indispensible in leaving the
country — and in evacuating the
people who have fled to the
embassy. While Mexico took out
people immediately, Argentina's
first group of evacuees did not
arrive in Buenos Aires until Sept.
30, seventeen days after the coup.
It had been hoped that the
asylum given by the Argentine
Embassy in Santiago would mean
real political asylum in Argentina
for all those evacuated. This has
not been the case so far. The
government has, of course, given
free entrance to Chilean citizens —
which were sent to the north of
Argentina: Corrientes, Formosa,
etc. — and to Argentines who are
not wanted for prosecution, but
to others it only has given the
right to remain in Argentina "in
transit" for 10 days, during which
time the refugees must make plans
to go elsewhere.
A petition has been presented
to the Argentine Congress asking
that political asylum and legal
residence be granted all those
fleeing Chile. In order to
accomplish this, pressure must be
put on the newly elected
president of Argentina, Juan D.
Peron. Letters and telegrans need
to be sent immediately to
President Peron (c/o Presidencia
de la Nacion, Buenos Aires) and
to international organizations
such as the OAS, the UN, and
others. In addition, there are
problems in providing for the
refugees. If you are concerned
about these matters please contact

UFO's: Go Home!
Editor:
This year, at least 50,000
motorists will lose their lives on
the American Highway.
In 1972, nearly 100 New York
City teenagers died from an
overdose of heroin. In the Middle
East, after just one week of
fighting, Israel has lost 2,000
soldiers — equivalent to the
United States losing over 46,000
men.
The American Cancer Society
estimates that 150,000 Americans
will die from lung cancer alone, in
1973. Los Angeles, Tokyo, and
New York City could choke to
death by the year 2,000, or
sooner, unless drastic steps are
taken to reduce air pollution.
The American Heart
Association reports that no less
than 650,000 Americans will
succumb to heart attack in the
next year. The Heart Association
says that the main causes are
simple obesity and lack of
exercise.
Indeed the world has many
problems. But why all the concern
on my part? Well for the last
several weeks, there have been
numerous sightings throughout
the United States of unidentified
flying objects.
I hope that whoever you are,
you will consider the world's
present predicament, turn around,
and go back to wherever it is you
came from. By doing so, you will
undoubtedly be a lot better off!
