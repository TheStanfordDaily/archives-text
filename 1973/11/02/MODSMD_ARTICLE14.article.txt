# State Senator Raps Tax Plan
## Gregorio Criticizes Prop. 1 
### DON COX 
State Sen. Arlen Gregorio,
D-San Mateo, said yesterday that
the support Proposition 1 has
been receiving "shows to a large
extent how many people believe
representative government really
doesn't work adequately
anymore."
Speaking to 10 people in the
Women's Clubhouse, Gregorio
argued against Proposition 1,
Governor Reagan's controversial
tax initiative on the ballot in next
week's special election.
"Support for the proposition is
an expression of distrust of
government," a result of the
continuing scandals and
corruption revealed daily. "Our
goal should be to correct the

governmental institutions rather
than limit them with arbitrary
issues."
Gregorio, a Stanford graduate
and outspoken advocate of
election reforms, said the outlook
for election reforms is "excellent"
and that they would open the
system, providing more access and
participation.
The proposition would create
"a system restricting freedom of
action of the legislature and
shifting the financing of
government at the state level to
the local level," he added.
While the location of spending
decisions at the local level would
allow mare popular control, the
move would encourage the
utilization of property and other
taxes which Gregorio termed
"very unfair."
The vice chairman of the
committee on local government
evaluated the tax initiative as "a
mechanism that seems to offer to
the people control of government
spending. But it actually does so
only in parts.
"What expenditures the people
may reduce on the state level, will
pop up again on the local level,"
he said.
Gregorio conjectured that
some cutbacks in present services
financed at the state level would
result from passage of the
proposition.
These services would then
either be dropped by the local
governments or paid for out of
receipts from "unfair" taxes. He
pointed out that two-thirds of the
California budget was directed
toward local services and
programs.
The blame for increased state
expenditures can not be left solely
with the legislature, Gregorio said.
Gregorio termed the turnout in
next Tuesday's election "crucial."
The "clever move" in having the
special election in an off-year is
bound to result in a lighter
turnout, he said. A light turnout
usually works to the advantage of
conservative interests, Gregorio
noted.
