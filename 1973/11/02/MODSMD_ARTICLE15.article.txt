# Arson Rate Increases Over Other Felonies
## 
### 
Arson is growing at a faster
rate than other types of fires and
even faster than most other
crimes, a Stanford Research
Institute (SRI) report warns.
Despite a general slackening of
violent incidents nationally, arson
is occurring at a rate ten times as
high as in 1950 and is spreading to
the suburbs, wrote Kendall D.
Moll, a socio-economist and
author of the report.
The study, prepared for the
U.S. Justice Department's
National Institute of Law
Enforcement and Criminal
Justice, recommended that
investigative efforts in connection
with arson be tripled, especially in
small suburban and rural
communities.
"While group violence such as
civil disorders, open harassment
and organized bombings have
reached their peaks, the more
individual, surreptitious behavior
such as arson and false alarms are
still rising," the study said.
"The central cities remain the
most intense trouble spots, but
rates are generally rising more
rapidly in outlying suburbs."
According to statistics
compiled through 1971 but still
valid, arson losses account for
possibly 30 percent or more of all
building losses — greater than all
the other costs of violence
combined.
In 1971, there were more than
72,000 arson fires with the loss
damage at $233 million. The

report said that the number of
deliberate burnings has tripled
since 1960 and jumped by 13
times since 1950 — a tenfold
increase when population growth
is considered.
Moll said that while arson rates
are rising faster than other types
of fires, only one percent of arson
cases result in conviction,
according to best estimates.
Statistics compiled by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation and the
National Fire Protection
Association show that arrests for
arson declined six percent in 1972
while arson went up 17 percent.
Why have convictions gone
down while arson has increased?
Moll said that a key reason is
because smaller fire departments
lack arson investigators and
generally give low priority to
catching arson suspects.
