If the Daily is now independent of the school, why does $1 of our
student fees still go to it? T.F.
"The Daily is legally independent but not financially independent
yet," said Editor Jim Wascher. "It has to gradually phase out student
fees. The Daily can't afford to just drop all of its income aside from
advertising and special projects."
Last spring the students passed a referendum approving a fee
assessment for the Daily. According to the terms of that referendum,
this fall was the last time the Daily can collect the $1 per student fee
unless another assessment is approved.
Wascher said that the Daily doesn't plan to ask for more money,
"at least in the near future."
Isn't it true that a student ticket bought before a football game
costs $1.50? I paid $9.00 for a book of five student tickets. What
happens to the $1.50 difference in price? J.C.
Student tickets do cost $1.50 for all home games except for the
Big Game against Cal. A ticket for that game costs $3.00, and that's
where the extra money goes â€” four tickets at $1.50 each plus the Big
Game ticket at $3.00 totals $9.00.
