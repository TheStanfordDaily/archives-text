# Fuel Crisis Inconveniences Travelers
## 
### Associated Press 
Auto travel became more
expensive and plane travel less
convenient in many areas of the
country yesterday due to the fuel
crisis. Home heating oil also went
up in some areas.
The commuter driving to work
found some gas pumps with price
hikes as high as three cents a
gallon. Those travelling greater
distances found fewer flights to
choose from at the airports.
Phillips Petroleum Co., citing
increased costs of foreign crude
oil, raised its wholesale prices by
three cents a gallon for gasoline
and heating oil.
And a Phillips spokesman in
Oklahoma said the end is not yet
in sight for price hikes.
"Our costs have been
substantially increased, mostly
due to imports," he said. "A
substantial part of that has not
been recovered.
"This will be partially
offsetting, but not fully. If the
foreign import price increases

continue, we probably have not
heard the last of it,"he said.
Dealers immediately began to
pass the increases on to the
consumer. That pushed the price
of premium gas close to 50 cents a
gallon in areas like San Francisco.
The Cost of Living Council said
dealers could pass along any
increases in wholesale prices. But
a spokesman said the council
would "have to talk to the Phillips
people" to see whether the
three-cent hike was justified.
Spokesmen for the council had
predicted that price hikes would
average about one cent per gallon.
All increases will be examined by
the council.
At the nation's airports, the
three largest airlines — American,
Trans World and United —
dropped 80 flights because of a
shortage of airline fuel. Other
companies announcing some flight
cuts included Delta, North
Central, Piedmont, Continental,
Frontier, Eastern and Northwest
Orient.

All of the airlines said they
were cutting back on "low-load"
flights which were not heavily
traveled, and they had
experienced no major problems in
handling their customers. Most of
the flight cuts were between
major metropolitan areas.

Meanwhile in Sacramento, Lt.
Gov. Ed Reinecke sharply
attacked federal officials
yesterday for imposing heavy fuel
restrictions on California and for
closing 12.5 million acres of
California desert to offroad
vehicles.
