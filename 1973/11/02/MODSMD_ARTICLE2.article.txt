# Stanford Surgeons To Testify
## Trial Result May Define Death 
### BRUCE KADDEN Second of Two Parts 
The question of when a person is
dead will play an important role in an
Alameda County murder trial in which
the victim's heart was used in a
transplant.
Alameda County Deputy Dist.
Atty. Albert W. Meloling has asked
Stanford heart surgeons Dr. Norman
Shumway and Dr. Eugene Dong to
give their opinions about what
constitutes "death" in the trial of
34-year-old Andrew D. Lyons, accused
of the Sept. 10 slaying of Samuel M.
Moore, 29, of Oakland.
The defense will attempt to prove
that Lyons cannot be charged with
murder because the victim's heart was
still beating when he was declared
dead. The prosecution will argue that
Moore met criteria for "brain death"
before the heart was removed.
After the life-support system that
apparently had kept Moore alive for
two days was disconnected, Moore's
kidneys were taken to San Francisco
and transplanted into two women, and
his heart was brought here by
helicopter.
Surgical Team
Shumway and Dong saw the heart
leave Oakland, then drove to the
Medical Center and joined a team of
surgeons led by Dr. Randall Griepp in
mid-operation.
In four hours, they transplanted the
heart into Blaine Wixom, 52, a retired

construction engineer from Salt Lake
City. Wixom died less than a month
later from pneumonia and other
complications arising from the
transplant.
The transplant operation was the
62nd for Shumway, of which 23
recipients remain alive. It was the first
time, however, that a heart was
transported several miles to be
transplanted.
Organ Banks
Transporting the heart was a step
toward organ banks which would help
solve the problem of finding donors
when and where they are needed, he
said. Shumway claims that in the five
years he has been doing heart
transplants, 30 patients have died
waiting for donors.
At arraignment last Friday, Lyons
pleaded not guilty to first-degree
murder, setting the stage for a
confrontation to determine a legal
definition of death. Superior Court
Judge William McGuiness set the trial
date for Dec. 18.
Maryland and Kansas have laws
defining death as the end of brain
activity, but California has nO specific
legal definition of death. Under the
California state code concerning
transplants, a physician must declare a
potential donor dead, but the code
doesn't establish the criteria to be
used.
Under the criminal law of the state,
the jury or judge attempts to

determine the cause of criminal
deaths. If, in Lyons' case, defense
medical experts testify that death
occurred when the heart stopped
beating, the jurors could find that the
gun shot wound wasn't the direct
cause of death, and that no murder
took place.
Few Precedents
There have been few previous cases
that would serve as a precedent. A
Virginia jury recognized brain death as
sufficient for organ removal, but in
that case, it was a $100,000 lawsuit
filed against four doctors, not a trial of
a suspected murderer.
In Detroit, the family of a potential
donor decided to withdraw permission
for removing his kidneys and corneas
fearing the state's case against the
donor's attacker would be jeopardized.
A Texas court recently threw out a
murder indictment in a case involving
the removal of life support equipment
in preparation for a transplant, stating
