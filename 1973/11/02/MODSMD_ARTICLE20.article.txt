# Pauling Plans To File Suit Against FDA Vitamin Laws
## 
### DAVE SMITH 
Vitamin C advocate and
Chemistry Prof. Linus Pauling
told reporters in Washington, D.C.
last week that he intends to file a
legal objection to proposed
federal regulations making
vitamins subject to prescription
drug laws.
Pauling said he would go to
court sometime next month to i

file suit against the Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) over
the ruling, which would take
effect in 1975. At least 10 other
persons have indicated that they
will file legal objections to the
regulations.
"I really can't see any valid
reason for these regulations,"
Pauling told the Daily Wednesday.
"They would really be damaging
to the health of the American

people. Many who rely on
vitamins as food supplements
would be cut off from them by
higher prices and decreased
availability."
Pauling traveled to Washington,
D.C. last week, where he was
scheduled to appear at a
congressional hearing on the FDA
ruling. Although the hearing was
postponed, he did consult with
congressmen considering a bill to
block the vitamin ruling.
According to the FDA, a
reclassification of vitamins as
drugs is necessary because of
alleged fraud and misrepresenta
tion in the vitamin industry and
exorbitant price-boosting over
actual vitamin costs. "Their
method is roundabout and
ineffective," stated Pauling.
"Prescription-drug status would
make prices much higher than
they are now."
Pauling, the double Nobel
laureate and author of the
best-seller Vitamin C and the
Common Cold said the possibility
of vitamin overdoses was not
sufficient grounds for regulation.
"It is true that by taking huge
doses of vitamins A or D an
overdose is possible, but such
cases are extremely rare. As far as
we know there is no way to get an
overdose of any of the other
vitamins," Pauling said.
"Vitamin C and the others are
necessary foods," he added, "and
they should be available to all
who need them."

OUT OF GAS — As the fuel crisis forced gas station owners across the
country to raise {vices, Campus Shell faced another problem. It ran
out of gas Wednesday afternoon, but was refueled yesterday by 10
a.m. The station may ration gasoline to customers if necessary, an
attendant said.
