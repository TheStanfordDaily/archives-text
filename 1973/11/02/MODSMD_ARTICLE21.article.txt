MEROM GOLAN, Israel (AP)
— The small contingent of Israeli
women serving with combat units
in the barren, windswept Golan
Heights have put away their
miniskirts and put on ski masks
and fur-lined parkas.
The life is rough — camping in
pup tents in freezing
temperatures, manning
communications equipment 24
hours a day and living without a
bathroom.
But there are no complaints. In
fact, there's a tremendous pride in
being about as close to combat as
the women's army permits, rather
than in an office in Tel Aviv.
Israeli and Arab combat forces
were still in place even after the
cease-fire.
"I think it's the best place to

be in such a time," said 2nd Lt.
Neili Ofiry, 20, of Jerusalem,
commander of an all-female
communications unit which has
been operating at a base less than
three miles from the Syrian
border.
"First of all, they need girls
here," she said. "If a girl sits here,
then a boy can sit somewhere
where it's more dangerous.
"I also think it's good for
morale," she said. "It's nice to see
girls."
The women's army is called
"Chen," which is the Hebrew
word for "charm." Its symbol is a
flower and sword.
Since Israel's war of
independence in 1948, women
have been barred from front-line
fighting.
