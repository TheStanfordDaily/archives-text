# 'Blaise Pascal'
## Rossellini Presents Thoughtful Film 
### ED HARRIS 
Roberto Rossellini has not
chosen an easy task in
undertaking to portray the life of
Blaise Pascal. Pascal was both a
scientist and a religious thinker
in the age of Louis XIV and
managed to strike a balance
between the sceptical, inquiring
spirit of science and the faith and
confidence of religion. Rosselini
presented the film at an advance
showing in Mem Aud on Monday
night.
Pascal's life was entirely
devoted to his work; no love
affairs, no adventures, scandals or
even family squabbles interrupted
the calm flow of his thought.

Rossellini has admirably met the
challenge of portraying a man
whose activity was entirely verbal
and intellectual in the visual
medium of film, and has
transformed the camera into a
lectern to express ideas.
The film is almost without
plot, more like a tone poem
orchestrated by Pascal's thought
which unites and links all the
scene in the film. Even though
Rossellini has played down
Pascal's Jansenism for which
many people in France were
persecuted at the time, he does
not ignore history, but prefers to
concentrate on the chores and
customs of everyday life instead
of the more broad social and
political conditions of the time.
Not A History
There is no painstaking
reconstruction of historical detail
to distract us from the main part
of the film, Pascal's philosophy.
Everyday life is evoked as a ritual
endowed with a sanctity that the
modem world has lost amidst
speed and efficiency.
There is a pervading theme of
slowness to the film. At first it is
the slow pace of life itself which
makes every action at once more
stately and more painful. Next it
is the methodical slowness of
meditation, the tremendous
amount of time required to
acquire knowledge and to
formulate ideas. Finally, it is the
tortured slowness inflicted by
strain and sickness of the

movlaments of Pascal's own body.
The audience had a hard time
adju sting to the relaxed tempo of
the film, and the entire
performance was punctuated with
yaw r is and groans at the
inteir m in able debates over science
and theology. I don't think this
was Rossellini's fault, but more
the - impatience of the audience.
An /Vmerican audience expects to
be intimidated, threatened,
shoe ked, titillated or abused when
it goes to the movies; anything
but having the actors respect and
spea.;k to them as intelligent
human beings who consider the
questions posed by science and
religi onto be important.
Films Intended To Inform
During the questions after the
filmi, Rossellini stated that he did
not so much intend to make

money or to amuse with his films,
but rather to inform his audience.
He later added that he preferred
doing films for television since
although it did not bring in the
box office receipts, it did reach a
larger audience in a very short
time. It is reassuring to know that
there is still a person in
filmmaking who feels responsible
for his art and does not bend to
the whims of the marketplace.
Plato and Montaigne have said
that the proper end of philosophy
is to prepare us to meet our death.
In the last scenes of the film we
see Pascal on his deathbed
dismissing all the false hopes
offered by his physicians and his
family and calling for his last rites
to be performed, showing us that
philosophy is not only to be
studied, but to be lived.

PRESENTS FILM Italian film director Roberto Rossellini makes a point in a question-and-answer session
following the presentation of his new film, Blaise Pascal, in Mem Aud Monday night. Unlike most
biographical films, this cinematic essay on the French scientist and religious philosopher is more
concerned with ideas than events.
