Pastoral Music of
Ralph Vaughan Williams
London Philharmonic, London
Symphony, New Philharmonia;
Sir Adrian Boult, conductor.
Angel S-36902
Mood music in its finest sense,
the tone poetry of Vaughan
Williams is especially effective in
evoking the misty atmosphere of
the verdant English landscape.
The folk melodies of England,
whether by direct quotation as in
the "Norfolk Rhapsody," or by
inference as "In The Fen
Country," give more direction and
definitive shape to his washes of
orchestral color than in the
French impressionism of Debussy
and Ravel.
In addition to the übiquitous
"Greensleeves," the album
presents an excellent performance

of the "Serenade." This setting of
a scene from Shakespeare's
"Merchant of Venice" is
particularly sensitive to the
imagery of the text, which is
clearly delivered by the sixteen
soloists. Their ensemble is as
finely blended as the
accompanying orchestra.
"The Lark Ascending" is a
meandering romance for violin
and orchestra, which surrounds a
folksong-like interlude with a
quasi-improvisatory solo line.
Violinist Hugh Bean produces a
somewhat pinched tone at times,
in a work which defies ideas of
progression or drive.
If the musical style seems
reminiscent of many film scores,
it is because such writing became
a model for many lesser imitators.

But Boult, by avoiding maudlin
and sentimental excesses, shows
the- works to be more substantial,
though immediately accessible to
any listener. As intended, the
album is an invitation to
imagination, a musical
back-to-nature excursion.

Like lovers of peanut butter
(who will eat it on anything),
lovers of Fischer-Dieskau will
probably be eager to hear him sing
Baroque cantatas on this new
release. However, if anything, this

album confirms that, like peanut
butter, his style goes better with
some things — Schubert, for
instance — than others.
The literature is interesting,
especially Raneau's Thetis', a solo
cantata sung by Neptune and
Jupiter over their rivalry in
courtship. Two rage arias give the
baritone ample opportunity for an
agitato style, supplied even by the
fury of vivid lightning flashes in
the accompaniment. However, the
concluding air gracieux lacks the
contrasting suavity required by
the text.
The accompanists do little to
compensate for stylistic losses.
Veyron-Lacroix repeatedly relies
on anachronistic sub-octave
(16-foot) registration, which
distorts both the texture and
timbre of the ensemble,
particularly given that the solo
voice is a baritone. Nor does he
pay more than token attention to
French ornamental keyboard
style. Vibrato in the cello brings
confusion to the lower registers.
And Rampal's obligato lines give
little account of the sign-figures in
the first Bach selection, and
employ a vibrato in "Cara sposa"
suitable for Debussy.
Most of the recitative has a
metrical rigidity which usurps its
declamatory style. Likewise, the
Telemann aria, "Epheitert die
Sebelen" receives a pedestrian
metrical accent out of keeping
with the fludity of the flute line,
and the ornamented da capos are
labored.
The most effective moment
comes in the "recitative in the
Telemann, a brilliant piece of
dramatic writing, where
Fischer-Dieskau's ability to
convey changing mood is given a
good showing.
