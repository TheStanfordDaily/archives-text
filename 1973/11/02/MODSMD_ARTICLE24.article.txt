# Wallers' Audience Hears Authentic Jamaican Reggae...And Likes It
## 
### JENNIFER RANDISI 
SAN FRANCISCO - By 9:30
p.m. on Tuesday night the New
Matrix was well on its way to
having a sell-out crowd.
Sandwiched in between the nudie
shows that typify North Beach
entertainment, the Matrix is one
of the few anomalies that not
only competes, but probably
outsells, most of the bars on
Broadway.
Although mostly young, and
almost exclusively white, Tuesday
night's audience had come to see
the Wailers — a seven-man
Jamaican band, six of whose
members are black and speak no
English.
Because a good percentage of
the audience had either heard of
the Wailers, or had seen them in
concert, the group was greeted
with a standing ovation that lasted
the length of the first set.
Each song was a simple blend
of strong bass and percussion with
repetitive, almost monotonous,
vocals. It was the pure form of
reggae, or Jamaican "rock," that
has been imitated by many
American artists including Paul
Simon and Johnny Nash.
Characteristic Loose Sound
As the set progressed, each
song seemed to become more
improvisational and freer in
structure, both instrumentally and
lyrically. Because the group uses
no on-stage monitors, there is
much less unity and precision in
even the simplest vocals and
harmonies. Each member of the
band functions as a separate
entity to give their music a sound

that is technically lax, yet
stylistically rigid in terms of
reggae.
After the first set, I spoke with
the manager of the Wailers,
Benjamin Foot. Having spent the
first portion of his life in Jamaica
foot sees the Wailers as one of the
most sustained, and certainly the
best, of the reggae groups to come
out of Jamaica.
Ten-Year History
After being together for ten
years with only an occasional
replacement, the Wailers have a
long musical career that includes a
tour of Sweden with Johnny Nash
(whose song "Stir It Up" was
written and performed on tour by
the Wailers), and the more recent
American tour with Sly and the
Family Stone. From the Matrix,

Foot plans to take the Wailers to
the East Coast for a few weeks,
then on to Jamaica and England.
Although he was quick to agree
that the group would return to
San Francisco, Benjamin couldn't
be specific about a date. For those
at Tuesday night's concert, it
couldn't be soon enough.
Currently appearing at the
Matrix through Saturday night are
Iggy and the Stooges, a very wild
rock group whose performance is
thought of mainly in terms of the
stage act rather than the music.
Hiere will be one act both tonight
and Saturday night beginning at 9
p.m. Tickets are $3.00 per person,
and there is a one drink minimum.
The Matrix is located at 412
Broadway, in the heart of North
Beach.

The Matrix is located at 412
Broadway, in the heart of North
Beach.
SAN FRANCISCO - By 9:30
p.m. on Tuesday night the New
Matrix was well on its way to
having a sell-out crowd.
Sandwiched in between the nudie
shows that typify North Beach
entertainment, the Matrix is one
of the few anomalies that not
only competes, but probably
outsells, most of the bars on
Broadway.
Although mostly young, and
almost exclusively white, Tuesday
night's audience had come to see
the Wailers — a seven-man
Jamaican band, six of whose
members are black and speak no
English.
Because a good percentage of
the audience had either heard of
the Wailers, or had seen them in
concert, the group was greeted
with a standing ovation that lasted
the length of the first set.
Each song was a simple blend
of strong bass and percussion with
repetitive, almost monotonous,
vocals. It was the pure form of
reggae, or Jamaican "rock," that
has been imitated by many
American artists including Paul
Simon and Johnny Nash.
Characteristic Loose Sound
As the set progressed, each
song seemed to become more
improvisational and freer in
structure, both instrumentally and
lyrically. Because the group uses
no on-stage monitors, there is
much less unity and precision in
even the simplest vocals and
harmonies. Each member of the
band functions as a separate
entity to give their music a sound

that is technically lax, yet
stylistically rigid in terms of
reggae.
After the first set, I spoke with
the manager of the Wailers,
Benjamin Foot. Having spent the
first portion of his life in Jamaica
foot sees the Wailers as one of the
most sustained, and certainly the
best, of the reggae groups to come
out of Jamaica.
Ten-Year History
After being together for ten
years with only an occasional
replacement, the Wailers have a
long musical career that includes a
tour of Sweden with Johnny Nash
(whose song "Stir It Up" was
written and performed on tour by
the Wailers), and the more recent
American tour with Sly and the
Family Stone. From the Matrix,

Foot plans to take the Wailers to
the East Coast for a few weeks,
then on to Jamaica and England.
Although he was quick to agree
that the group would return to
San Francisco, Benjamin couldn't
be specific about a date. For those
at Tuesday night's concert, it
couldn't be soon enough.
Currently appearing at the
Matrix through Saturday night are
Iggy and the Stooges, a very wild
rock group whose performance is
thought of mainly in terms of the
stage act rather than the music.
