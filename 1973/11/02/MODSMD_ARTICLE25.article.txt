# Stanford Eyes Fifth Victory
## Beavers Host Improving Cards 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
Stanford's Cardinals, suddenly
a factor in the Rose Bowl race,
and Oregon State's Beavers,
fighting only to regain some
respect, square off tomorrow at
Corvallis in a 1:30 p.m. game OSU
coach Dee Andros calls "a real
test of our character."
"We've just gotta shake off our
disappointments and play the rest
of the teams on our schedule,"
Andros said. "If we can win those
games, we'll get back a helluva lot
of respect."
Stanford, now 4-3 after an
impressive 45-14 romp over
Washington State last week, will
be "high as kites" according to
Andros. But for the Beavers, now
1-6 in a dismal campaign, "it
becomes a matter of how much
personal pride they have in
themselves as individuals — how
much pride they have in OSU."
The Great Pumpkin's
emotional plea still can't change
the fact that Oregon State is
assured of its third straight losing
season. The Beavers, ranked by
one pollster as the 10th worst
team in the nation, have stumbled
on the ground, been intercepted
in the air and have even had
trouble completing the handoff
from center to quarterback.
"You know," said a bewildered
Andros, "I still can't give people
an explanation of why he
|quarterback Alvin White] can't
take the snap from center."
Halloween Scares
Stanford coach Jack
Christiansen, however, refused to
admit to the Beavers'
incompetence. "They did a good
job against USC [the Trojans won,

21-7]," Chris said, "and I )ee
[Andros] has a special way of
getting his players ready. It alwi ays
seems like we're playing him
around Halloween, and frank ly,
that makes me kind of nervous."
Christiansen may be nervo us,
but Andros is simply amazed by
the improving Cardinj lis.
"Washington State has play ed
some of the great teams in 1 Jie
country and not be ;en
embarrassed," Andros said. "I iut
Stanford, it seemed, ran a ind
passed on them almost at will.
"What impresses me the m ost
is the job they have done
establishing a running ga me

without John Winesberry."
Last week Stanford's resurgent
runners rolled up 239 yards, led
by a 130-yard performance by
fullback Scott Laidlaw. Those
figures are particularly impressive
when compared to the Cards'
totals for their first two games,
when Stanford's net rushing
yardage still hadn't reached zero.
"I hope that we've kind of
established a new standard for
ourselves," Christiansen said.
League-Leading Passer
Laidlaw should once again lead
the Card rushers tomorrow, with
tailback Ray Taroli and fullback
Dick Maurer handling most of the

running chores for the Beavers.
When OSU leaves the Parker
Stadium Astroturf and goes to the
air — which should be often —
Pac-8 passing leader Alvin White
will look toward Maurer, split end
Ron Stewart and Taroli as his
favorite receiving targets.
Defensively, Christiansen calls
the Beavers a "hard-hitting" unit.
Linebacker Craig Fair and
cornerback Kirk Byers, named
"Hardrocks" by Andros for their
defensive work last week against
Arizona State, are two of the
standouts on the defensive unit.
Several Stanford players will be
performing at less than 100
percent efficiency tomorrow
because of injuries, but wide
receiver Tony Hill is the only
Cardinal that won't make the trip.
Hill underwent knee surgery
Monday at Stanford Hospital.
Defensive ends Roger Stillwell
and Pat Donovan and running
back Ron Inge are also suffering
knee problems, but all three are
expected to be ready for the 1:30
p.m. kickoff.

Cardinal Notes: Informed
sources report that Mike Boryla
and Randy Poltl have been
selected for the Hula Bowl game
in Honolulu next month.
Boryla needs only 102 yards to
move past John Brodie into the
number three spot on the
all-time Stanford passing list.
Boryla, who currently has 3,493
career yards, is 245 yards away
from Dick Norman's
second-ranking total. Jim
Plunkett's all-time NCAA record
of 7,544 yards is, of course,
unreachable.
Washington State coach Jim
Sweeney, whose Cougars play
Oregon tomorrow, has been
telling the Northwest press that
the Ducks aren't "as explosive" as
Stanford. Sweeney, obviously
impressed by the Cards after they
thrashed his Cougars, said "If
Stanford keeps on playing that
way, there's going to be one
helluva race for the league title."

Corvallis in a 1:30 p.m. game OSU
coach Dee Andros calls "a real
test of our character."
"We've just gotta shake off our
disappointments and play the rest
of the teams on our schedule,"
Andros said. "If we can win those
games, we'll get back a helluva lot
of respect."
Stanford, now 4-3 after an
impressive 45-14 romp over
Washington State last week, will
be "high as kites" according to
Andros. But for the Beavers, now
1-6 in a dismal campaign, "it
becomes a matter of how much
personal pride they have in
themselves as individuals — how
much pride they have in OSU."
The Great Pumpkin's
emotional plea still can't change
the fact that Oregon State is
assured of its third straight losing
season. The Beavers, ranked by
one pollster as the 10th worst
team in the nation, have stumbled
on the ground, been intercepted
in the air and have even had
trouble completing the handoff
from center to quarterback.
"You know," said a bewildered
Andros, "I still can't give people
an explanation of why he
|quarterback Alvin White] can't
take the snap from center."
Halloween Scares
Stanford coach Jack
Christiansen, however, refused to
admit to the Beavers'
incompetence. "They did a good
job against USC [the Trojans won,

21-7]," Chris said, "and I )ee
[Andros] has a special way of
getting his players ready. It alwi ays
seems like we're playing him
around Halloween, and frank ly,
that makes me kind of nervous."
Christiansen may be nervo us,
but Andros is simply amazed by
the improving Cardinj lis.
"Washington State has play ed
some of the great teams in 1 Jie
country and not be ;en
embarrassed," Andros said. "I iut
Stanford, it seemed, ran a ind
passed on them almost at will.
"What impresses me the m ost
is the job they have done
establishing a running ga me

without John Winesberry."
Last week Stanford's resurgent
runners rolled up 239 yards, led
by a 130-yard performance by
fullback Scott Laidlaw. Those
figures are particularly impressive
when compared to the Cards'
totals for their first two games,
when Stanford's net rushing
yardage still hadn't reached zero.
"I hope that we've kind of
established a new standard for
ourselves," Christiansen said.
League-Leading Passer
Laidlaw should once again lead
the Card rushers tomorrow, with
tailback Ray Taroli and fullback
Dick Maurer handling most of the

running chores for the Beavers.
When OSU leaves the Parker
Stadium Astroturf and goes to the
air — which should be often —
Pac-8 passing leader Alvin White
will look toward Maurer, split end
Ron Stewart and Taroli as his
favorite receiving targets.
Defensively, Christiansen calls
the Beavers a "hard-hitting" unit.
Linebacker Craig Fair and
cornerback Kirk Byers, named
"Hardrocks" by Andros for their
defensive work last week against
Arizona State, are two of the
standouts on the defensive unit.
Several Stanford players will be
performing at less than 100
percent efficiency tomorrow
because of injuries, but wide
receiver Tony Hill is the only
Cardinal that won't make the trip.
Hill underwent knee surgery
Monday at Stanford Hospital.
Defensive ends Roger Stillwell
and Pat Donovan and running
back Ron Inge are also suffering
knee problems, but all three are
expected to be ready for the 1:30
p.m. kickoff.

Cardinal Notes: Informed
sources report that Mike Boryla
and Randy Poltl have been
selected for the Hula Bowl game
in Honolulu next month.
Boryla needs only 102 yards to
move past John Brodie into the
number three spot on the
all-time Stanford passing list.
Boryla, who currently has 3,493
career yards, is 245 yards away
from Dick Norman's
second-ranking total. Jim
Plunkett's all-time NCAA record
of 7,544 yards is, of course,
unreachable.
Washington State coach Jim
Sweeney, whose Cougars play
Oregon tomorrow, has been
telling the Northwest press that
the Ducks aren't "as explosive" as
Stanford. Sweeney, obviously
impressed by the Cards after they
thrashed his Cougars, said "If
Stanford keeps on playing that
way, there's going to be one
helluva race for the league title."

of the teams on our schedule,"
Andros said. "If we can win those
games, we'll get back a helluva lot
of respect."
Stanford, now 4-3 after an
impressive 45-14 romp over
Washington State last week, will
be "high as kites" according to
Andros. But for the Beavers, now
1-6 in a dismal campaign, "it
becomes a matter of how much
personal pride they have in
themselves as individuals — how
much pride they have in OSU."
The Great Pumpkin's
emotional plea still can't change
the fact that Oregon State is
assured of its third straight losing
season. The Beavers, ranked by
one pollster as the 10th worst
team in the nation, have stumbled
on the ground, been intercepted
in the air and have even had
trouble completing the handoff
from center to quarterback.
"You know," said a bewildered
Andros, "I still can't give people
an explanation of why he
|quarterback Alvin White] can't
take the snap from center."
Halloween Scares
Stanford coach Jack
Christiansen, however, refused to
admit to the Beavers'
incompetence. "They did a good
job against USC [the Trojans won,

21-7]," Chris said, "and I )ee
[Andros] has a special way of
getting his players ready. It alwi ays
seems like we're playing him
around Halloween, and frank ly,
that makes me kind of nervous."
Christiansen may be nervo us,
but Andros is simply amazed by
the improving Cardinj lis.
"Washington State has play ed
some of the great teams in 1 Jie
country and not be ;en
embarrassed," Andros said. "I iut
Stanford, it seemed, ran a ind
passed on them almost at will.
"What impresses me the m ost
is the job they have done
establishing a running ga me

without John Winesberry."
Last week Stanford's resurgent
runners rolled up 239 yards, led
by a 130-yard performance by
fullback Scott Laidlaw. Those
figures are particularly impressive
when compared to the Cards'
totals for their first two games,
when Stanford's net rushing
yardage still hadn't reached zero.
"I hope that we've kind of
established a new standard for
ourselves," Christiansen said.
League-Leading Passer
Laidlaw should once again lead
the Card rushers tomorrow, with
tailback Ray Taroli and fullback
Dick Maurer handling most of the

running chores for the Beavers.
When OSU leaves the Parker
Stadium Astroturf and goes to the
air — which should be often —
Pac-8 passing leader Alvin White
will look toward Maurer, split end
Ron Stewart and Taroli as his
favorite receiving targets.
Defensively, Christiansen calls
the Beavers a "hard-hitting" unit.
Linebacker Craig Fair and
cornerback Kirk Byers, named
"Hardrocks" by Andros for their
defensive work last week against
Arizona State, are two of the
standouts on the defensive unit.
Several Stanford players will be
performing at less than 100
percent efficiency tomorrow
because of injuries, but wide
receiver Tony Hill is the only
Cardinal that won't make the trip.
Hill underwent knee surgery
Monday at Stanford Hospital.
Defensive ends Roger Stillwell
and Pat Donovan and running
back Ron Inge are also suffering
knee problems, but all three are
expected to be ready for the 1:30
p.m. kickoff.

Cardinal Notes: Informed
sources report that Mike Boryla
and Randy Poltl have been
selected for the Hula Bowl game
in Honolulu next month.
Boryla needs only 102 yards to
move past John Brodie into the
number three spot on the
all-time Stanford passing list.
Boryla, who currently has 3,493
career yards, is 245 yards away
from Dick Norman's
second-ranking total. Jim
Plunkett's all-time NCAA record
of 7,544 yards is, of course,
unreachable.
Washington State coach Jim
Sweeney, whose Cougars play
Oregon tomorrow, has been
telling the Northwest press that
the Ducks aren't "as explosive" as
Stanford. Sweeney, obviously
impressed by the Cards after they
thrashed his Cougars, said "If
Stanford keeps on playing that
way, there's going to be one
helluva race for the league title."

REJUVENATED RUNNING ATTACK—Scott Laidlaw (33) brought Stanford's running attack out of the
doldrums Saturday against Washington State, gaining 130 yards on 18 carries during the 45-14 victory.
Hie Cards, now 4-3 on the season, travel to Corvallis, Oregon tomorrow for a 1:30 p.m. game against
Oregon State's Beavers.
Stanford's Cardinals, suddenly
a factor in the Rose Bowl race,
and Oregon State's Beavers,
fighting only to regain some
respect, square off tomorrow at
Corvallis in a 1:30 p.m. game OSU
coach Dee Andros calls "a real
test of our character."
"We've just gotta shake off our
disappointments and play the rest
of the teams on our schedule,"
Andros said. "If we can win those
