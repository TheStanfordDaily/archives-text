# Cordova To Start At QB As JV Seeks Second Win
## 
### TIM FERGUSON 
Mike Cordova will start for the
junior varsity against UC-Davis'
JV today at Stanford Stadium,
and, if his last JV performance is
any indication, the contest will be
a wild one.
JV coach Gunther Cunningham
said Tuesday the "possibility" of
Cordova quarterbacking the squad
in the 2:30 p.m. encounter hinged
on varsity mentor Jack
Christiansen's decision this week.
Chris decided Wednesday that
Cordova would handle the JV
chores with Mike Boryla, Dave
Ottmar and Jerry Waldvogel
making the varsity trip to Oregon
State.
Cunningham said Cordova,
who passed for 280 yards when
the JV dominated but lost to
UCLA, 24-13, was in a difficult
position because of his flux
between varsity and JV, but that
both levels offered advantages to
the freshman signal-caller.
Nevertheless, Cunningham is
pleased to have Cordova today
and said, "I want him for sure for
the Cal game."
Backing up Cordova today is
Larry McGovern, who directed
the last quarter of the JV's 26-6
win over Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
two weeks ago after starter Ron
Himes broke his collarbone and
was lost for the season.
Option Offense
If McGovern enters the game,
Cunningham plans extensive use
of his heretofore mediocre option
offense. The coach said McGovern
"has what it takes to be an option
quarterback" and that after
McGovern ran a simulated
Washington State offense against
the varsity in practices last week,
varsity linebackers said he handled
the attack as well as the Cougar

QB.
"He ran the option as well as
anyone in this conferenci
Cunning said of McGovern, addi ing
that the quarterback had sho 1 wn
4.7 speed in full pads this wei ek.
Cunningham's scouts repor( «d
the Aggies are "really quick a nd
tough — really aggressive." Da vis
is 3-1, winning handily over J 1 y's
from Sacramento State and Sar ita
Clara and swamping Napa junior
college, 40-0. Highly-regarc iled
Merced JC beat the Aggies, 31-:! 21.
Thorough coaching may be 1 ;he
key to Davis' suca ;ss.
Cunningham reports incredulou sly
that the school has eight JV
assistants. Stanford has four.
Injury List
Cunningham expects runn ing
backs on Stegenson and Mar vin
Holmes and offensive guard Kent
Lightfoot to return from injuiries
for today's game. Only Himes i and
tight end Dave Bruzzone rerr lain
on the inactive list, he said.
Cunningham wants to try
fullback Andy Kolesnikow at
tight end today, and, if McGo\ 'em
quarterbacks, will move defen; sive
back Mike Conner to reserve QB
"because he's a real fine athlel
The coach also wants to "112 Ind
some second-string Bnebackf trs"
today. "I'm thinking about the
future," Cunningham said. "If we
shift people around ... it's wh at's
good for those kids."
Cunningham plans to direc :t a
lot of passes toward wide rece iiver
Jim Erickson. At 6-5, 200 pour ids,
Erickson is looked upon v rith
favor by his coach, despitt » a
relative lack of action so far 1 this
season.
'Ton of Receivers'
"We have a ton of receive rs,"
says Cunningham, explaining the
dearth. "I know what Jim can
do."
Cunningham has installed no

new defense for his Davis foes. "I
don't like to change very much,"
he said, indicating that players,
not strategy, win JV games.
The coach spotlighted four
players as having developed well
during his team's week layoff.
McGovern and back Rich Waters
were chosen the top offensive and
defensive players on the JV's
"scout squad" which practiced
against the varsity. Punter Tom
Lynn is gaining "confidence in his
kicking" and playing well at
defensive back and place-kicker
Chip Underwood is "kicking the
hell out of the ball," Cunningham
said.
Cunningham said his players
"ran extremely hard" during the
week in order to condition
themselves against what he
suspects were injuries caused by
fatigue in the Cal Poly game.
"I hope we're ready to play,"
Cunningham said. "Emotionally
we'll be ready. It was great for our
kids to see the varsity Saturday
[45-14 over Washington State].
We've [Stanford] got something
going. I hope we [JV] can keep it
up in our last three games."

defensive players on the JV's
"scout squad" which practiced
against the varsity. Punter Tom
Lynn is gaining "confidence in his
kicking" and playing well at
defensive back and place-kicker
Chip Underwood is "kicking the
hell out of the ball," Cunningham
said.
Cunningham said his players
"ran extremely hard" during the
week in order to condition
themselves against what he
suspects were injuries caused by
fatigue in the Cal Poly game.
"I hope we're ready to play,"
Cunningham said. "Emotionally
we'll be ready. It was great for our
kids to see the varsity Saturday
[45-14 over Washington State].
We've [Stanford] got something
going. I hope we [JV] can keep it
up in our last three games."
Mike Cordova will start for the
junior varsity against UC-Davis'
JV today at Stanford Stadium,
and, if his last JV performance is
any indication, the contest will be
a wild one.
JV coach Gunther Cunningham
said Tuesday the "possibility" of
Cordova quarterbacking the squad
in the 2:30 p.m. encounter hinged
on varsity mentor Jack
Christiansen's decision this week.
Chris decided Wednesday that
Cordova would handle the JV
chores with Mike Boryla, Dave
Ottmar and Jerry Waldvogel
making the varsity trip to Oregon
State.
Cunningham said Cordova,
who passed for 280 yards when
the JV dominated but lost to
UCLA, 24-13, was in a difficult
position because of his flux
between varsity and JV, but that
both levels offered advantages to
the freshman signal-caller.
Nevertheless, Cunningham is
pleased to have Cordova today
and said, "I want him for sure for
the Cal game."
Backing up Cordova today is
Larry McGovern, who directed
the last quarter of the JV's 26-6
win over Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo
two weeks ago after starter Ron
Himes broke his collarbone and
was lost for the season.
Option Offense
If McGovern enters the game,
Cunningham plans extensive use
of his heretofore mediocre option
offense. The coach said McGovern
"has what it takes to be an option
quarterback" and that after
McGovern ran a simulated
Washington State offense against
the varsity in practices last week,
varsity linebackers said he handled
the attack as well as the Cougar

QB.
"He ran the option as well as
anyone in this conferenci
Cunning said of McGovern, addi ing
that the quarterback had sho 1 wn
4.7 speed in full pads this wei ek.
Cunningham's scouts repor( «d
the Aggies are "really quick a nd
tough — really aggressive." Da vis
is 3-1, winning handily over J 1 y's
from Sacramento State and Sar ita
Clara and swamping Napa junior
college, 40-0. Highly-regarc iled

Thorough coaching may be 1 ;he
key to Davis' suca ;ss.
Cunningham reports incredulou sly
that the school has eight JV
assistants. Stanford has four.
Injury List
Cunningham expects runn ing
backs on Stegenson and Mar vin
Holmes and offensive guard Kent
Lightfoot to return from injuiries
for today's game. Only Himes i and
tight end Dave Bruzzone rerr lain
on the inactive list, he said.
Cunningham wants to try
fullback Andy Kolesnikow at
tight end today, and, if McGo\ 'em
quarterbacks, will move defen; sive
back Mike Conner to reserve QB
"because he's a real fine athlel
The coach also wants to "112 Ind
some second-string Bnebackf trs"
today. "I'm thinking about the
future," Cunningham said. "If we
shift people around ... it's wh at's
good for those kids."
Cunningham plans to direc :t a
lot of passes toward wide rece iiver
Jim Erickson. At 6-5, 200 pour ids,
Erickson is looked upon v rith
favor by his coach, despitt » a
relative lack of action so far 1 this
season.
'Ton of Receivers'
"We have a ton of receive rs,"
says Cunningham, explaining the
dearth. "I know what Jim can
do."
Cunningham has installed no

new defense for his Davis foes. "I
don't like to change very much,"
he said, indicating that players,
not strategy, win JV games.
The coach spotlighted four
players as having developed well

lot of passes toward wide rece iiver
Jim Erickson. At 6-5, 200 pour ids,
Erickson is looked upon v rith
favor by his coach, despitt » a
relative lack of action so far 1 this
season.
'Ton of Receivers'
"We have a ton of receive rs,"
says Cunningham, explaining the
dearth. "I know what Jim can
do."
Cunningham has installed no

new defense for his Davis foes. "I
don't like to change very much,"
he said, indicating that players,
not strategy, win JV games.
The coach spotlighted four
players as having developed well
during his team's week layoff.
McGovern and back Rich Waters
were chosen the top offensive and
defensive players on the JV's
"scout squad" which practiced
against the varsity. Punter Tom
Lynn is gaining "confidence in his
kicking" and playing well at
defensive back and place-kicker
Chip Underwood is "kicking the
hell out of the ball," Cunningham
said.
Cunningham said his players
"ran extremely hard" during the
week in order to condition
themselves against what he
suspects were injuries caused by
fatigue in the Cal Poly game.
"I hope we're ready to play,"
Cunningham said. "Emotionally
we'll be ready. It was great for our
kids to see the varsity Saturday
[45-14 over Washington State].
We've [Stanford] got something
going. I hope we [JV] can keep it
up in our last three games."
