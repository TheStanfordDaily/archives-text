# Pac-8 Predictions
## 
### 
The Daily's fearless
forecaster fortunately failed
last week in his prediction of
the Stanford-Washington State
game. The prediction — WSU
28, Stanford 23. The final
score — Stanford 45, WSU 14.
Still, it represented the Daily's
first mistake regarding a
Cardinal game, and, our
prognosticator adds, the
Daily's last.
This week the upper
division Pac-8 teams take on
the basement in four league
encounters. USC and
"mystified" coach John
McKay travel to Berkeley
hoping to vent their
frustrations from last week's
defeat in South Rend.
Tomorrow, Mike White and his
Bears should be more than
frustrated.
Oregon, now 2-1 in the
conference, meets puzzling
Washington State in Pullman.
The Cougars should be
sufficiently angered by last

week's performance a t
Stanford Stadium to defeat ar i
inferior Oregon team.
Hapless Washington run. s
into the Bruin Wishbone in Lo. s
Angeles and the result may bi ?
mind-boggling. Hopefully '
UCLA coach Pepper Rodger. ;
will have enough sympathy foi r
lame duck Washington men tot *
Jim Owens to keep the scort .'
semi-respectable.
At Corvallis, Stanford hope: s
to take its Halloweer l
vengeance out on Oregon Stati ?
coach Dee "the Great
Pumpkin" Andros. The Card: s
should complete enough passe ti s
and intercept enough of Alvir t
White's to win handily.
The Daily's record, for'
anyone who is curious, ii ;
21-5-1.
