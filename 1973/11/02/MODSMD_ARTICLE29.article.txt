# Poloists Meet USC
## New Swim Complex Opens 
### CHRIS BAKER 
All the waiting for the new
swim complex is now over. Today
at 3 p.m. Stanford's water polo
team will face USC in the new
$2.2 million complex and
tommorrow the Cards face San
Jose State at 2 p.m. From all
indications today's event will be a
true gala, with the Incomparable
Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band on hand to add to
the festivities.
"This weekend is probably the
most important two days of the
season," said Gaughran. "We have
to beat SC on Friday and San Jose
State on Saturday."
This afternoon's Pacific Eight
contest will match the Trojans,
who defeated California 7-6 last
Friday, and the Cards, who are
0-2 in Pac-8 play.
"SC beat Cal in a very physical
match that was loosely referreed,"
Gaughran said. "USC has a good
player in Kocsis, who scored three

goals against Cal. He's a real good
swimmer, although he hasn't
played a lot of water polo."
USC lost to UC-Irvine, in the
Irvine tournament, earlier this
year. Irvine is one of the top
squads in the nation.
Troy is coached by first-year
mentor John Williams. Williams, a
long time aid to departed head
man Peter Deland, is now using an
offense which, like the Cards,
seems to center on no single
player.
"We'll play the kind of
fast-breaking, passing game that
we've been trying to play all
year," Gaughran said. "We won't
concentrate on any particular
player on defense today."
Gaughran feels that the new
pool will have a positive effect on
his squad's spirit. "This is an
exciting pool to play in. It lets us
use our swimming ability better
than our old pool."
Halloween marked the first

time that the team has gotten into
their new home all year, and the
Cards appeared so pleased that
they were still practicing as the
day turned into early evening.
Today's contest will be played
in the 25 by 20 yard pool. Hie
seating capacity of the complex is
2500. The facility, one of the best
of its kind in the nation, has four
lights to illuminate the pool for
possible overtime action.
San Jose State, tomorrows
opponent in a 2 p.m. game, was
NCAA runner up last year, but
the Cards defeated the Spartans
5-4 earlier this season.
"We must win all our games if
we expect to get a shot at an
NCAA berth," Gaughran said.
"After the season, since the Pac-8
is only allowed one NCAA berth,
the NCAA will take a look at the
records of the teams in the nation
and offer spots. To get a spot we
must have beaten all the teams
that they consider."
