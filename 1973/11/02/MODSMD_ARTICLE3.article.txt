# LBJ Press Secretary Speaks
## Moyers Hits Executive Secrecy 
### KEVIN SMITH 
"Executive secrecy has turned into
a political tool" for covering up
administrative blunders, Bill Moyers,
former press secretary to President
Lyndon Johnson, said last night.
Moyers, former publisher of
Newsday whose program Bill Moyers'
Journal appears weekly on public
television, spoke to 375 persons in
Cubberley Auditorium.
"Secrecy is used to deceive" the
American people, Moyers claimed.
Although he said that under a
representative democracy, government
has "the right to conduct affairs
secretly and in confidence," Moyers
added, "I do think the public has the

right not to be misled."
According to Moyers, the events of
Watergate "happened because men
corrupted the doctrine of executive
secrecy."
"What's dangerous in all this is not
just the government withholding
information," Moyers said, "but that
the government was suggesting it was
doing one thing when in fact it was
doing another."
He declared, "Given the choice
between too much secrecy and too
little, I would choose too little."
News Camaraderie
Moyers criticized "the collusion of
camaraderie" between many political
reporters and the people they cover in
government. "Washington is a
one-company town in which the
Washington press corps must feed off
the main industry," Moyers said. "This
promotes a camaraderie between those
who make the news and those who
report it."
He warned reporters to avoid such
collusion because "the advantage is
always with the government, and that
power is greater than ever before."
"Independence is still the first
priority for the few journalists who
want to exercise it,"he said.
Explaining he did "not fear for the
sanctity of the press," because "we are
quite capable of defending ourselves,"
Moyers said he was "less confident
that the country as a whole can
protect itself from the forces the
President is trying to rally."
Asked whether he thought Congress
would impeach President Nixon,
Moyers replied, "I don't think they'll
ever impeach him unless they find
evidence that he's guilty of a crime."
Speculating that "resignation is
more a possibility than impeachment,"
Moyers said that "by the time
impeachment came, the
country . .. would be so divided" that
many people feel impeachment "just
wouldn't be worth it."
Moyers praised new Special

Prosecutor Leon Jaworski, but
criticized the fact that Jaworski is
working under the Justice
Department.
Calling Jaworski "a man of
impeccable credentials," Moyers said,
"He is a good man for the job, but he
is in the wrong place." Moyers also
lauded Attorney General-designate
William Saxbe as "a man I greatly
admire."
Contrasting himself with President
Nixon's press secretary, Ronald
Ziegler, Moyers said Ziegler "was the
first man in my era to become White
House press secretary whose main
experience was as a guide at
Disneyland."
Labeling Ziegler "a public relations
man," Moyers said, "I don't think

Ronald Ziegler has any sympathy for
the press and its vital role."
Asked about his feelings during the
escalation of the Vietnam War, Moyers
replied, "You have to realize that it
just creeped [sic] up on us."
"Most of us believed in the
beginning that the war would be
limited," he said. "We thought that its
goals were worthy and intelligible."
He said he felt after awhile that the
"means outran the ends," but that he
"didn't want to turn around out of a
sense of personal loyalty" to Johnson.
The new season of Bill Moyers'
Journal began Wednesday evening with
a program entitled "An Essay on
Watergate." It will be rebroadcast
tomorrow on Channel 9.
