# 5-9, 165 Pounder Follows Vataha, Cross
## Singler Stars In 'Mini-Receiver' Role 
### JIM WASCHER 
"The most important thing for a receiver is
catching the ball first and then worrying about
getting hit."
This philosophy would seem a bit conventional if
it didn't come from a college football player who is
5-9 and weighs 165 pounds.
Bill Singler has applied the philosophy with
surprising success during his first year on the
Stanford varsity squad, so far catching 21 passes for
359 yards andthreetouchdowns.
Singler says his size is "the one thing I try not to
think about during a game." He is sure that "if you
sit out there and worry about getting injured, you're
going to get injured."
Normally, the speedy receiver is able to elude
any trouble simply by outrunning it. Singler believes
"my quickness and my ability to run pass patterns
are probably my two greatest assets."
Because of his size, observes frequently compare
him to Stanford's two previous small receivers,
Randy Vataha and Eric Cross. However, receivers
coach Pete Kettela says Singler is physically smaller
than either Vataha or Cross. He adds that Singler is
"as quick as any receiver I've ever seen, including
Cross."
Can't Copy Moves
Although he wants to play as well as Vataha and
Cross, "or better," Singler says "you can't copy any
one receiver's moves or any one receiver's ability to
nin."
Kettela says he plans to use Singler and receivers
Eric Test and Reggie Ishman more frequently now
that Tony Hill is out for the season, but he
cautioned that being a receiver is in many ways
"like being a gunfighter — there's always somebody
trying to shoot you down."
According to Kettela, he and coach Jack
Christiansen will use the "hottest" receiver available
each week. Last Saturday, Singler was hot.
During Stanford's stirring 45-14 romp over
Washington State, he snared one touchdown pass
each from Mike Boryla and Dave Ottmar, gaining a
total of 94 yards. He says playing in that game was
"the greatest thrill of the season for me.
"We proved Saturday that we are a team, both

offensively and defensively," Singler says."It took
us that long to really show our explosiveness on the
field."
Reverse Pass
That explosiveness first appeared early in the
first quarter when Singler grabbed a 47-yard pass
from Test on a reverse. Kettela says he has added
that play to Stanford's offensive repertoire, hoping
to use it successfully again.
Singler is a junior who redshirted last year after
an outstanding year on the frosh squad in 1971.
"The thing I missed the most sitting out and not
playing any games," Singler says, "was the game
experience."
However, he adds that "in the long run, it's going
to pay off' because of the experience and
confidence he gained scrimmaging against "the best
pass defense in the conference," Stanford's.
Singler is a native of Medford, Oregon, coming
from "a predominantly athletic family which enjoys
doing things together." He was an all-state
basketball player in high school, averaging 20 points
a game during his senior year.
Basketball Favorite
"Basketball has always been my favorite sport,"
Singler says, "but size is even more of a deterrent
in that sport than it is in football."
His high school football team captured the state
championship during both his junior and senior
years. He caught 48 passes in his junior year,
including a record-setting three-touchdown
performance in the championship game.
After receiving his bachelor's degree in sociology
next year, Singler will spend an extra year pursuing
a master's degree in physical education. Afterwards,
he says he will "probably snap up whatever kind of
teaching/coaching job opens up."
After this season, Singler plans to participate in
the Stanford Youth Plan /Big Brother program,
which recruits Stanford athletes to spend time with
local junior high school students from broken
homes or disadvantaged families.
"It means a lot to a kid like that to have a Rip
Brother if he doesn't have one in the home or if hij
parents are separated," Singler says."I think giving
a helping hand is what life is all about."
