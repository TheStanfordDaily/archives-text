# Hockey Team Impressive
## Skaters Boast 3-1 Record 
### QUIGLEY S. PETERSON 
Stanford's skating Cardinals
sustained their first loss of the
year last Monday night, an 8-5
defeat gt the hands of the San
Francisco Seals at Legg's Ice
Arena in San Francisco. The loss
came after three straight wins,
two against the Sacramento
Royals and one against the
arch-rival Belmont Buffaloes.
The still-young season began
with a two day road trip to

Sacramento (Oct. 20-21) to play
the newly-formed Sacramento
Royals. The Royals, who could
not skate with the younger
Stanford team, sought other
alternatives to stay in the game.
The first meeting of the two
teams on Oct. 20 was one of the
hardest hitting games Stanford has
played in three years, but elbows
and sticks in the face did not
hinder Stanford at all. Instead the
reverse was true. The Cards
started hitting back hard and
legally. Leading 2-0 after first
period goals by Donny Stewart
and Louis LaFond, Stanford
skated on to a 6-1 victory. Goalie
Rich Bragdon turned in a superb
performance, making a number of
clutch saves to give Stanford the
edge in a game that was much
closer than the score indicates.
The heavy hitting in the first
game apparently took its toll on
Sacramento as Stanford cruised to
a 10-2 victory in the rematch
Sunday afternoon. Sacramento
was never in the contest except
for two fights. Dean Berard of
Sacramento started both of them
and the second fight saw him
thrown out of the game. The
referee was not exactly thrilled by
Berard's habit of trying to gouge
his opponent's eyes out.
Belmont Victory
Stanford's big test came against
Belmont a week ago Tuesday.
Belmont has given Stanford
trouble for years, but the Cards
won this one 4-3 on a slap shot by
Jay Johnston with 17 seconds
remaining in the game.
Stanford had trailed 3-2 going
into the third perio.d Midway
through the period, Eddie
Leonard tied it up at 3-3 with his
second goal of the night. The
other goal came on a short shot
by Chris Counihan in the second
period. Rich Bragdon came up
with another top-notch
performance in the nets.
Johnston's goal was a fitting
end to a close game for Stanford's

icemen, who were eliminated by
Belmont in the playoffs two years
ago by a similar shot.
Failed to Apologize
Louis LaFond was ejected
from the game before it even
began. LaFond accidentally
bumped into the referee during
warm-ups and was kicked out for
not apologizing. Aside from that,
the referee called a tight game and
id didn't get out of hand as
Stanford-Belmont games have in
the past.
Monday's loss to San Francisco
came after Stanford had jumped
on the Seals for a 3-0 lead.
Thereafter the Cardinal attack
faltered and San Francisco picked
up three quick goals. San
Francisco kept the momentum
the rest of the way for an 8-5 win.
Hie Cardinals were not at all
sharp. The only bright light was
Stanford's first hat trick (three
goals in one game) of the year,
turned in by Jay Johnston.
Johnston currently leads the
team in scoring with nine points,
having chalked up five goals and
four assists in four games. Louis
LaFond's four goals and three
assists place him second in scoring
with seven points. Five others are
tied at four points apiece. Eddie
Leonard's four goals and one
assist stand out.
Stanford gets back into action
Monday night at Legg's Ice Arena
in San Francisco when the Cards
meet California's Golden Bears at
8 p.m.

Stanford-Belmont games have in
the past.
Monday's loss to San Francisco
came after Stanford had jumped
on the Seals for a 3-0 lead.
Thereafter the Cardinal attack
faltered and San Francisco picked
up three quick goals. San
Francisco kept the momentum
the rest of the way for an 8-5 win.
Hie Cardinals were not at all
sharp. The only bright light was
Stanford's first hat trick (three
goals in one game) of the year,
turned in by Jay Johnston.
Johnston currently leads the
team in scoring with nine points,
having chalked up five goals and
four assists in four games. Louis
LaFond's four goals and three
assists place him second in scoring
with seven points. Five others are
tied at four points apiece. Eddie
Leonard's four goals and one
assist stand out.

WOMEN'S HOCKEY WINS AGAIN — Stanford's women's varsity field hockey team improved its record
to 3-0-1 yesterday with a 4-3 victory at UC-Davis. The junior varsity also triumphed, as Ann Walker scored
all five goals to lead the Cards to a 5-0 victory over the Davis JVs. Above, Stanford (plaid skirts) and
Sacramento State players battle for the ball during a game last Thursday.
Stanford's skating Cardinals
sustained their first loss of the
year last Monday night, an 8-5
defeat gt the hands of the San
Francisco Seals at Legg's Ice
Arena in San Francisco. The loss
came after three straight wins,
two against the Sacramento
Royals and one against the
arch-rival Belmont Buffaloes.
The still-young season began
with a two day road trip to

Sacramento (Oct. 20-21) to play
the newly-formed Sacramento
Royals. The Royals, who could
not skate with the younger
Stanford team, sought other
alternatives to stay in the game.
The first meeting of the two
teams on Oct. 20 was one of the
hardest hitting games Stanford has
played in three years, but elbows
and sticks in the face did not
hinder Stanford at all. Instead the
reverse was true. The Cards
started hitting back hard and
legally. Leading 2-0 after first
period goals by Donny Stewart
and Louis LaFond, Stanford
skated on to a 6-1 victory. Goalie
Rich Bragdon turned in a superb
performance, making a number of
clutch saves to give Stanford the
edge in a game that was much
closer than the score indicates.
The heavy hitting in the first
game apparently took its toll on
Sacramento as Stanford cruised to
a 10-2 victory in the rematch
Sunday afternoon. Sacramento
was never in the contest except
for two fights. Dean Berard of
Sacramento started both of them
and the second fight saw him
thrown out of the game. The
referee was not exactly thrilled by
Berard's habit of trying to gouge
his opponent's eyes out.
Belmont Victory
Stanford's big test came against
Belmont a week ago Tuesday.
Belmont has given Stanford
trouble for years, but the Cards
won this one 4-3 on a slap shot by
Jay Johnston with 17 seconds
remaining in the game.
Stanford had trailed 3-2 going
into the third perio.d Midway
through the period, Eddie
Leonard tied it up at 3-3 with his
second goal of the night. The
other goal came on a short shot
by Chris Counihan in the second
period. Rich Bragdon came up
with another top-notch
performance in the nets.
Johnston's goal was a fitting
end to a close game for Stanford's

icemen, who were eliminated by
Belmont in the playoffs two years
ago by a similar shot.
Failed to Apologize
Louis LaFond was ejected
from the game before it even
began. LaFond accidentally
bumped into the referee during
warm-ups and was kicked out for
not apologizing. Aside from that,
the referee called a tight game and
id didn't get out of hand as
Stanford-Belmont games have in
the past.

came after Stanford had jumped
on the Seals for a 3-0 lead.
