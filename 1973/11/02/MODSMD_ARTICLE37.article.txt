# Stanford Hooters Host California
## 
### BRUCE KADDEN 
With two weeks left in the
season, the soccer team hopes to
improve its record tomorrow
when the Cards take on California
at 1:30 p.m., on Harry Maloney
Field.
Coach Fred Priddle said of the
Bears, "They have a team very
similar to us... a good tough
team." While that may be true,
Cal had a difficult time scoring
goals last weekend in a
tournament in Seattle.
They were shut out 1-0 twice,
by Washington and Seattle Pacific,
and then beat Pacific Lutheran,
2-0. "The games followed our
season-long pattern," commented
Cal Coach Bob DiGrazia. "We
have been playing very good
defense but the offense can't get
us any points."
The teams appear to be similar
in this respect, although the Cards
scored 14 goals in two games last
weekend. Goalie Walt Harris,
anchors the defense, which has
recorded five shutouts this season.
Stanford and Cal played to a
1-1 tie last year, which could
indicate a dose game. Against
UCLA, the Cards were downed
2-1, while the Bears suffered a 2-0
defeat.
Injuries could be a key, as Cal
lost two players on the northern
trip, halfbacks Randy Farris and
Ron Watson. Bobby Geiger, who
sat out two games for the Cards
with an injury, should see a lot of
action.
Yesterday, the varsity
improved its record to 8-4 with a
3-1 win at Cal State-San
Francisco. The victory was the
third in a row and sixth in the last

seven outings.
The teams played to a scoreless
tie in the first half. Both squads
had excellent scoring
opportunities early in the game,
but a combination of rushed shots
and good goaltending kept the
game scoreless.
Midway through the second
half, Stanford's offense came
alive, putting in three goals in less
than ten minutes.
Walter "Robby" Robb headed
in a free kick taken by Mac Taylor
for a 1-0 lead. Brian Bershader
took a perfect pass from Johnny
Murao and drilled it in for his
eighth goal of the year, leading
the team.
Phil Wright completed the
Cardinal scoring with a fine
individual effort, dribbling by two
players, then firing a shot into the
corner of the goal.
SF State got its lone score
when Wayne Wallace got the ball
near the goal, faked a defender,
and kicked the ball by Harris.
Besides that score, Harris
played his usual outstanding game
in goal. In the last seven outings,
he has allowed an average of one
goal per game.

eighth goal of the year, leading
the team.
Phil Wright completed the
Cardinal scoring with a fine
individual effort, dribbling by two
players, then firing a shot into the
corner of the goal.
SF State got its lone score
when Wayne Wallace got the ball
near the goal, faked a defender,
and kicked the ball by Harris.
Besides that score, Harris
played his usual outstanding game
in goal. In the last seven outings,
he has allowed an average of one
goal per game.

PLEASE DON'T HURT ME-Stanford's Phil Wright (11) seems to have
a Humboldt State player begging for mercy during the Cards' 8-0
victory Sunday. Stanford takes on California tomorrow in a 1:30 p.m.
game at Harry Maloney Soccer Field behind Sunken Diamond.
With two weeks left in the
season, the soccer team hopes to
improve its record tomorrow
when the Cards take on California
at 1:30 p.m., on Harry Maloney
Field.
Coach Fred Priddle said of the
Bears, "They have a team very
similar to us... a good tough
team." While that may be true,
Cal had a difficult time scoring
goals last weekend in a
tournament in Seattle.
They were shut out 1-0 twice,
by Washington and Seattle Pacific,
and then beat Pacific Lutheran,
2-0. "The games followed our
season-long pattern," commented
Cal Coach Bob DiGrazia. "We
have been playing very good
defense but the offense can't get
us any points."
The teams appear to be similar
in this respect, although the Cards
scored 14 goals in two games last
weekend. Goalie Walt Harris,
anchors the defense, which has
recorded five shutouts this season.
Stanford and Cal played to a
1-1 tie last year, which could
indicate a dose game. Against
UCLA, the Cards were downed
2-1, while the Bears suffered a 2-0
defeat.
Injuries could be a key, as Cal
lost two players on the northern
trip, halfbacks Randy Farris and
Ron Watson. Bobby Geiger, who
sat out two games for the Cards
with an injury, should see a lot of
action.
Yesterday, the varsity
improved its record to 8-4 with a
3-1 win at Cal State-San
Francisco. The victory was the
third in a row and sixth in the last

seven outings.
The teams played to a scoreless
tie in the first half. Both squads
had excellent scoring
opportunities early in the game,
but a combination of rushed shots
and good goaltending kept the
game scoreless.
Midway through the second
half, Stanford's offense came
alive, putting in three goals in less
than ten minutes.
Walter "Robby" Robb headed
in a free kick taken by Mac Taylor
for a 1-0 lead. Brian Bershader
took a perfect pass from Johnny
Murao and drilled it in for his
eighth goal of the year, leading
the team.
