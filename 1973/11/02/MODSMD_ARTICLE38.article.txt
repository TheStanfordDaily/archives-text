# 'Seedy' Sailors Compete In Two Regattas Tomorrow
## 
### TOM WINOKUR 
Sailing, once the sport of millionaires and the
occupation of a somewhat seedier fraction of
humanity, has become the sport of a fairly seedy
group of Stanford undergraduates.
This group of vagabonds, commonly known as
the Stanford Sailing Team, travels as far north as
Humboldt County and as far south as San Diego,
dragging one or two small sailboats behind their
collection of cramped cars. The team, which has
been in existence for a little over 20 years, has in
recent years been recognized as one of the premier
collegiate sailing teams.
This year's team will compete in two classes. The
most extensive competition will be in Flying Junior
sloops. These boats will be raced in the Northern
California Intercollegiate Yacht Racing Association
(NCIYRA) and against Southern California schools.
Stanford was the NCIYRA champion two years ago
and will be trying to regain that title.
The team will also race 30-foot Shields sloops in
collegiate and non-collegiate competition in both
Northern and Southern California. Additional
competition will also come, hopefully, in the form
of intersectional invitational regattas if Stanford
qualifies.
Mixed Results
Stanford has already sailed in several regattas
with mixed results. Eight sailors and two boats
traveled to San Luis Obispo for a tuneup race
among other California schools and finished second
and ninth. Sophomore Craig Daniels was the low
point skipper in that regatta.

Two weeks later the team sailed Shields in Santa
Cruz in a qualifying round for the Douglas Cup (a
prestigious national match racing trophy). The
results were disappointing as Stanford finished sixth
out of eight schools. Finally last weekend Stanford
hosted the first NCIYRA regatta and finished
fourth. Daniels was also the low point skipper in
that regatta.
Despite early erratic performances, Stanford has
the potential to be a regional, if not national, sailing
power this year. In addition to Daniels, returnees
include captain Ben Fisher, Duncaan Witte, Skip
Shapiro, Walt Spevak and Colby Atwood.
Talented Newcomers
Several outstanding newcomers have also joined
the team. Brad Mills, a transfer from Brown, can
compete under national sailing rules and will help
the team considerably, along with several
outstanding freshmen. Freshmen Lawson Fisher,
John Burton, Peter Skinner and Alan Andrews have
already sailed well in the early regattas. Another
strong aid to team success will be the new coach,
Vim Steenbakkers. Steenbakkers, an excellent
Dutch sailor, should help Stanford immeasurably.
This weekend Stanford's sailors will test their
skill in two important regattas. Two boats will again
travel to San Luis Obispo for the annual
North-South Regatta. Because of its high previous
finish there, Stanford will be the team to beat and a
high finish could bring a national making. Walt
Spevak will travel to Los Vegas for the Dunes
TYophy Regatta, a new major single-handed race,
and try to establish his own national prominence.

collegiate and non-collegiate competition in both
Northern and Southern California. Additional
competition will also come, hopefully, in the form
of intersectional invitational regattas if Stanford
qualifies.
Mixed Results
Stanford has already sailed in several regattas
with mixed results. Eight sailors and two boats
traveled to San Luis Obispo for a tuneup race
among other California schools and finished second
and ninth. Sophomore Craig Daniels was the low
point skipper in that regatta.

Two weeks later the team sailed Shields in Santa
Cruz in a qualifying round for the Douglas Cup (a
prestigious national match racing trophy). The
results were disappointing as Stanford finished sixth
out of eight schools. Finally last weekend Stanford
hosted the first NCIYRA regatta and finished
fourth. Daniels was also the low point skipper in
that regatta.
Despite early erratic performances, Stanford has
the potential to be a regional, if not national, sailing
power this year. In addition to Daniels, returnees
include captain Ben Fisher, Duncaan Witte, Skip
Shapiro, Walt Spevak and Colby Atwood.
Talented Newcomers
Several outstanding newcomers have also joined
the team. Brad Mills, a transfer from Brown, can
compete under national sailing rules and will help
the team considerably, along with several
outstanding freshmen. Freshmen Lawson Fisher,
John Burton, Peter Skinner and Alan Andrews have
already sailed well in the early regattas. Another
strong aid to team success will be the new coach,
Vim Steenbakkers. Steenbakkers, an excellent
Dutch sailor, should help Stanford immeasurably.
This weekend Stanford's sailors will test their
skill in two important regattas. Two boats will again
travel to San Luis Obispo for the annual
North-South Regatta. Because of its high previous
finish there, Stanford will be the team to beat and a
high finish could bring a national making. Walt
Spevak will travel to Los Vegas for the Dunes
TYophy Regatta, a new major single-handed race,
and try to establish his own national prominence.
Sailing, once the sport of millionaires and the
occupation of a somewhat seedier fraction of
humanity, has become the sport of a fairly seedy
group of Stanford undergraduates.
This group of vagabonds, commonly known as
the Stanford Sailing Team, travels as far north as
Humboldt County and as far south as San Diego,
dragging one or two small sailboats behind their
collection of cramped cars. The team, which has
been in existence for a little over 20 years, has in
recent years been recognized as one of the premier
collegiate sailing teams.
This year's team will compete in two classes. The
most extensive competition will be in Flying Junior
sloops. These boats will be raced in the Northern
California Intercollegiate Yacht Racing Association
(NCIYRA) and against Southern California schools.
Stanford was the NCIYRA champion two years ago
and will be trying to regain that title.
The team will also race 30-foot Shields sloops in
collegiate and non-collegiate competition in both
Northern and Southern California. Additional
competition will also come, hopefully, in the form
of intersectional invitational regattas if Stanford
qualifies.
