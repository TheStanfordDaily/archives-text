intramural Cross Country meet

The EM football playoffs begin
Tuesday and even though no
seedings have been announced,
the defending champion Zetes
appear to have the inside shot at
the top seed.
Saturday morning at 10,
however, the Zetes will get their
toughest test of the regular season
against Shakey's. Both teams are
undefeated and Shakey's hasn't
given up a single point in four
games. Even though I give the
edge for the top seed to the Zetes,
the winner undoubtedly will be
the number one seed going into
the playoffs.
Elsewhere last week, Biz I "A"
snuck by the Boston Bronskeys
19-13 in a battle of undefeateds.
Both teams advanced to the
playoffs. In other top games, the
SAE's finished their season
undefeated by trouncing Team
No. 5, 27-14. The Phi Delts, by
virtue of a 16-6 triumph over
Larkin, also move into the
playoffs unbeaten.
This afternoon at 4 p.m., the
once defeated Biz Ind I's tangle
with the unbeaten Bad Guys.
week the Bad Guys shut out KA
12-0 in the replay of a protested

In the "B" division. Biz II "B,"
