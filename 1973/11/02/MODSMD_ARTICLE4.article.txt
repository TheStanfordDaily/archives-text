# Drug Problem Fades Here

### WENDY QUINONES 
Drug use has faded as a problem on the Stanford
campus, according to counseling personnel and
administrators. "A lot of the flamboyance has disappeared
from the drug scene," said Dr. David Dorosin, director of
Counseling and Psychiatric Services.
"Drugs are just less of an issue," he contended.
"There's less heat, fewer bad trips, fewer people
concerned about drugs, fewer people strung out.
"Three or four years ago the counseling center would
see 10 or 15 bad trips a year, plus people incapacitated in
some way by drugs. But I can't remember the last bad trip
I saw."
Larry Horton, associate dean of Student Affairs, said
that drug problems are almost never a subject at residence
staff meetings any more. Before two or three years ago, he
said, drugs were a frequent topic of discussion.
Fewer Calls
The Bridge, a student-operated drug abuse drop-in
center, has experienced a decline in the number of people
coming to them with drug problems. "We never really saw
that many drug cases anyway," said Dr. Vincent Dandrea,
consultant to the Bridge and staff psychiatrist at the
counseling center. "But we see fewer now. If Cowell gets
no calls in a month, we might get three or four."
What has caused this change in the drug scene? Dorosin
said hard drugs — amphetamines, heroin and psychedelics
like mescaline and LSD — aren't being used as much on
college campuses.
"People are experimenting with drugs earlier now," he
says. "Drugs *>nve trickled down to high schools and
junior high sciu 's, and by the time those kids get to
Stanford, they've .no °d from that phase on to something
else."
Dorosin _ .t this phenomenon was not
limited to Stanford. My colleagues all over the country
have the same observation," he said. "The use of heavy

drugs is down."
Robe/t Hanrdla, director of the Academic Information
Center and assistant dean of Undergraduate Studies, says
his contacts with his freshman advisees and visits in
dormitories have convinced him that campus use of all
drugs, including marijuana, has declined.
Dandrea is not so sure. While problems stemming from
drug use may have lessened, he said, there is no hard data
showing that drug use itself has declined.
"There's always a period of experimentation and
evaluation with new ways of altering consciousness," he
said. "But then people become connoisseurs. There is a
much more sophisticated use of drugs now, and people are
less apt to get into trouble."
Dorosin, Hamrdla, Horton and Dandrea all agreed that
there has been a change in the drug scene, whether that
change is in the actual usage of drugs or in the style of
usage. They also agreed that this is part of a larger change
on college campuses.

Hamrdla said his freshman advisees are "clearly more
interested in academic work" than they were between
1968 and 1971. Then, he said, students would often take
only 12 units, the minimum number permitted. Now,
however, very few take only 12.
"We hear it from resident advisors, from counseling
staff, from all over," said Dandrea. "And they've been
saying it for a couple of years: freshmen are really serious,
they're studying, they're really interested in their work."
Dorosin and Dandrea also point to the growth during
the last five years of other countercultures that provide an
alternative to drugs, such as meditation, eastern religions
and a new outlook on Christianity.
In combination, these trends point to a change in the
overall tone on college campuses. "Campuses are just
more sober," said Dorosin. "There's less flamboyance in
every wav."

only 12 units, the minimum number permitted. Now,
however, very few take only 12.
"We hear it from resident advisors, from counseling
staff, from all over," said Dandrea. "And they've been
saying it for a couple of years: freshmen are really serious,
they're studying, they're really interested in their work."
Dorosin and Dandrea also point to the growth during
the last five years of other countercultures that provide an
alternative to drugs, such as meditation, eastern religions
and a new outlook on Christianity.
In combination, these trends point to a change in the
overall tone on college campuses. "Campuses are just
more sober," said Dorosin. "There's less flamboyance in
every wav."
Drug use has faded as a problem on the Stanford
campus, according to counseling personnel and
administrators. "A lot of the flamboyance has disappeared
from the drug scene," said Dr. David Dorosin, director of
Counseling and Psychiatric Services.
"Drugs are just less of an issue," he contended.
"There's less heat, fewer bad trips, fewer people
concerned about drugs, fewer people strung out.
"Three or four years ago the counseling center would
see 10 or 15 bad trips a year, plus people incapacitated in
some way by drugs. But I can't remember the last bad trip
I saw."
Larry Horton, associate dean of Student Affairs, said
that drug problems are almost never a subject at residence
staff meetings any more. Before two or three years ago, he
said, drugs were a frequent topic of discussion.
Fewer Calls
The Bridge, a student-operated drug abuse drop-in
center, has experienced a decline in the number of people
coming to them with drug problems. "We never really saw
that many drug cases anyway," said Dr. Vincent Dandrea,
consultant to the Bridge and staff psychiatrist at the
counseling center. "But we see fewer now. If Cowell gets
no calls in a month, we might get three or four."
What has caused this change in the drug scene? Dorosin
said hard drugs — amphetamines, heroin and psychedelics
like mescaline and LSD — aren't being used as much on
college campuses.
"People are experimenting with drugs earlier now," he
says. "Drugs *>nve trickled down to high schools and
junior high sciu 's, and by the time those kids get to
Stanford, they've .no °d from that phase on to something
else."
Dorosin _ .t this phenomenon was not
limited to Stanford. My colleagues all over the country
have the same observation," he said. "The use of heavy

drugs is down."
Robe/t Hanrdla, director of the Academic Information
Center and assistant dean of Undergraduate Studies, says
his contacts with his freshman advisees and visits in
dormitories have convinced him that campus use of all
drugs, including marijuana, has declined.
Dandrea is not so sure. While problems stemming from
drug use may have lessened, he said, there is no hard data
showing that drug use itself has declined.
"There's always a period of experimentation and
evaluation with new ways of altering consciousness," he
said. "But then people become connoisseurs. There is a
much more sophisticated use of drugs now, and people are
less apt to get into trouble."
Dorosin, Hamrdla, Horton and Dandrea all agreed that
there has been a change in the drug scene, whether that
change is in the actual usage of drugs or in the style of
usage. They also agreed that this is part of a larger change
on college campuses.
More Academia
Hamrdla said his freshman advisees are "clearly more
interested in academic work" than they were between
1968 and 1971. Then, he said, students would often take
only 12 units, the minimum number permitted. Now,
however, very few take only 12.
