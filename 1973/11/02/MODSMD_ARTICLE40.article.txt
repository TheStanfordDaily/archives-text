Ford: Pursue Nixon Probe
WASHINGTON — Vice President-designate
Gerald R. Ford said yesterday the House Judiciary
Committee should pursue its investigation of
grounds for the possible impeachment of President
Nixon.
"I don't believe there are grounds — but that's a
personal judgment," he told a Senate committee
examining his fitness to be vice president. "But
that's the way to clear the air."
Ford, sounding out on a broad range of subjects,
said he thought "it might have been much more
helpful" if Nixon had disclosed earlier that no tapes
exist of two key conversations connected with the
Watergate investigation.
He also said no president has an unlimited right
to invoke executive privilege, but must weigh any
such claim against the right of the public to
information from confidential White House
conversations and documents.
He said he had recommended to high White
House officials more than once that Nixon release
the White House tapes requested by the Watergate
grand jury.
The question of impeachment was raised by Sen.
Mark O. Hatfield, R-Ore., who said that, along with
other members of Congress, he has received a flood
of mail calling for impeachment or the resignation
of Nixon.
"Impeachment is the problem that is paramount
in everyone's mind at this time," Hatfield said. He
asked Ford how the national concern caused by
such a potential upheaval could be eased.
Ford replied that the inquiry now launched in
the House by the Judiciary Committee should be
continued until it leads to a determination that
grounds for impeachment either exist or do not
exist.
Ford was questioned at morning and afternoon
sessions and agreed to return Monday, when the
committee expects to finish with him.
Aide Blasts Campaign Deceit
WASHINGTON — Former Nixon campaign
manager Clark MacGregor testified yesterday he was
used and deceived in the Watergate affair and said
the President should submit to questioning by the
Senate Watergate committee's two ranking
members.
Testifying before the committee, MacGregor, a
former Minnesota congressman and White House
aide, said he believes Nixon might be willing to
submit to questions put informally by Watergate
chairman Sam J. Ervin Jr., D-N.C., and vice
chairman Howard H. Baker Jr., R-Tenn.
MacGregor told newsmen he had not checked his
idea with Nixon before offering it to the committee.
In his testimony, MacGregor disputed parts of
the testimony of two previous witnesses and said of
his campaign experiences: "It doesn't make one
happy to learn that one has been used."
MacGregor singled out former White House
counsel John W. Dean 111 and Jeb Stuart Magruder,
his immediate subordinate at Nixon's re-election
committee, as having used him.
"I think I ought to make it crystal clear that I do
not include the President of the United States,"
MacGregor said. "His relations with me have been
trustworthy."
MacGregor took charge of Nixon's re-election
committee, replacing former Atty. Gen. John N.

Mitchell, two weeks after the June 17, 1972
break-in at Democratic National Headquarters.
Testimony On Tapes Continue
WASHINGTON — Presidential aide Stephen V.
Bull received an important tape recording months
before President Nixon is said to have learned that it
did not contain a crucial Watergate conversation, a
Secret Service technician testified yesterday.
The technician, Raymond C. Zumwalt, said he
did not know whether the tape was among those
that former White House chief of staff H.R.
H aide man took home with him about the same
time.
The tape in question recorded Nixon's
conversations of April 15, 1973 and preceding days
in his Executive Office Building suite. But the White
House has told U.S. District Court Judge John J.
Sirica that the tape ran out before Nixon talked
with ousted counsel John W. Dean 111 late in the
evening.
Sirica called yesterday's hearing to place on the
record the circumstances by which two White House
tapes sought by Watergate prosecutors are now said
not to exist.
Dean told the Senate Watergate committee in
June that his April 15 conversation with Nixon
included Nixon's whispered remark that he was
probably foolish in earlier discussing an offer of
executive clemency for Watergate conspirator E.
Howard Hunt. Dean also said the President
disavowed an earlier statement about raising hush
money for Watergate defendants.
Haldeman told the Watergate committee that he
had listened, sometime between July 9 and 11, to a
recording of an earlier meeting between Nixon and
Dean. He said at that time he also received several
other tapes but did not listen to them. He said he
got them for two days and returned them.
News Monitor Plan Denied
SAN FRANCISCO — Federal Communications
Commission Chairman Dean Burch denied yesterday
that anyone in the White House ever asked him to
set up official monitoring of television network
news shows.
A proposal to establish such a FCC monitoring
system was revealed Wednesday when Sen. Lowell
Weicker, R-Conn., released a memo from former
White House aide Jeb S. Magruder to former White
House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman. If the
monitoring showed biased news coverage, the memo
said the FCC could take official action.
"I first learned about this by reading the paper
this morning," Burch told a news conference at a
western regional meeting of the National
Association of Broadcasters (NAB).
"I was never asked and I never would have done
it,"he said. "It's abominable to make such a
proposal."
Burch also called the proposal hideous, saying "A
governmental remedy for an apparent problem is
worse than the problem itself."
But the Nixon appointee to the regulatory
agency said the President does have an interest in
television news and that more television networks
would be good for the country.
"I, for one, am not comfortable in this great
country with only three networks," he said at the
NAB luncheon. "It's a tragedy to be limited to three
evening news sources."

Nixon, Meir Discuss Mideast
WASHINGTON — Prime Minister Golda Meir of
Israel yesterday suggested after meeting with
President Nixon that Egypt and Israel negotiate a
new cease-fire line in a way that would involve
"moving forces on both sides of the Suez Canal."
The proposal, made at a news conference, could
provide a way of freeing an estimated 20,000
Egyptian soldiers trapped by Israeli forces on the
canal's east bank. Meir said the lines should be
"straightened out" and "large numbers of people
moved" without jeopardizing the cease-fire or
harming the political positions of either Egypt or
Israel.
Meir spent an hour and 20 minutes at the White
House with the President, who described their
discussion as "very constructive." Secretary of State
Henry A. Kissinger said the talks went "very well."
Later, at the 45-minute news conference, Meir
stoutly denied several times that the President was
applying pressure on her country to give up
positions when the first Oct. 22 U.N. cease-fire
agreement failed to halt the fighting between Israel
and Egypt. She added that Washington attached no
conditions to the massive arms shipments that
helped Israel through the Yom Kippur war.
Equity Funding Chiefs Indicted
LOS ANGELES — The three former top
executives of Equity Funding Corp. of America and
19 others were indicted by a federal grand jury
yesterday on charges of carrying out a fantastic
computerized insurance fraud.
liie multi-million-dollar fraud was described by
investigators as the biggest in insurance industry
history.
Equity Funding, a giant financial conglomerate,
tumbled into bankruptcy last April. It had been
disclosed that executives and employees were
mass-producing phony insurance policies and selling
them to other insurance companies.
This was done, the indictment charged, to make
earnings appear higher and inflate the price of stock
of a subsidiary, Equity Funding Life Insurance Co.
Topping the list of those charged were Stanley
Goldblum, 46, Beverly Hills, former chairman and
president of Equity Funding; Fred Levin, 40,
Malibu, and Samuel B Lowell, 34, Pacific Palisades,
both former executive vice presidents.
Also named in the indictment were 17 former
Equity Funding employees and two former
employees of the company's independent auditing
firm.
All were charged with conspiring between
January, 1965 and April, 1973 to commit securities
fraud, mail fraud, filing of false documents with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, bank fraud,
interstate transportation of counterfeit securities
and electronic eavesdropping.
The charges are felonies carrying penalties
ranging from two to 10 years imprisonment and
fines of $1,000 to $10,000 on each count.
