# Professors Counter Buchanan Criticism

Buchanan's recent criticism of
television network news reporting has
evoked sharp responses from members
of the Communication Department
faculty here.
Speaking on the CBS Morning News
Monday, Buchanan called news
coverage of the Nixon Administration
"injurious to the democratic process,"
adding the major networks — ABC,
CBS and NBC — hold "excessive"
power. "Every legal and constitutional
means ought to be considered in order
to break up that, dominance," he
asserted.
Jules Dundes, a lecturer in
communication and former station
manager of KCBS radio, called it
"exceedingly poor for Buchanan to
point the finger at anyone," especially
in light of "the obvious and now
documented evidence" of White House
wrongdoing under the Nixon
administration. He conceded the
networks "are exceedingly powerful,"
but contended the power "is not
misused."
'The potential [for bias] is there,"
Dundes admitted, but he added, "I
don't agree at all that it [network
news] has been biased." He claimed
the administration doesn't like "the
direction and content" of the news,
and would prefer bias "in their interest
rather than against their interest."
Media Blamed
Prof. Nathan Maccoby admitted
that no precise measure of bias exists,
but pointed out "the news media are
not responsible for Nixon's plight;
Nixon is responsible for Nixon's
plight." He explained, "the bearer of
bad tidings is always blamed," and
called the President and his staff
"frustrated" because "all of his
[Nixon's] troubles get reported."
Maccoby admitted the inevitability
of some bias, noting that "People's
perceptions and beliefs enter into their
news reporting," but he denied
Buchanan's assertion that a conspiracy
exists "to get the President." He added
that the President and his staff "have
earned the lack of credibility," and
pointed out that "the President has
lost his credibility with the electorate
and is fighting for his life."

Dundes also reserved certain
criticisms for the President himself,
and stated "the man does not and
never has understood the role of an
adversary press in our society." He
noted, "Mr. Nixon would like a press
that is subservient," but said the press
"must remain aloof" in all situations.
Maccoby agreed that an "inevitable
adversary relationship" exists between
the government and the press,
emphasizing the media must not be "a
public relations group" for the White
House.
Scandals Revealed
According to Dundes, the press has
only been "following its
responsibility" to publicize
unfavorable news created by the
Nixon administration. He observed
this must "necessarily reveal the many
scandals of the Nixon administration."
While agreeing the press has such a
responsibility, Maccoby also noted
"the networks have great power." He
expressed unhappiness at the growing
number of people whose sole source of
news — "a meager source" — is
television. His worry, he explained, "is
not bias, but lack of knowledge."
Concerning the entire problem of
the president vs. the press, Maccoby
said, "The problem ought to be
intensively and carefully studied, in as
objective a manner as possible, but I
think that would be difficult to do."
