# Professors Discuss Hiring Of Minorities
## 
### DAN PYNE 
A discussion designed to eliminate
some of the "ignorance and suspicion"
surrounding the Affirmative Action
plan and faculty hiring was held
yesterday afternoon in the Main
Library. Gordon A. Craig, chairman of
the History Department, and Arthur I.
Bienenstock, vice-provost for faculty
affairs, centered their discourse around
the lack of women professors in the
History Department, but attempted to
correlate their explanations to the
entire University.
Bienenstock said that the
Affirmative Action plan was motivated
by the regulations of the HEW, the
university's desire to get the best
faculty and meet the needs of women
and minority students, and individual
department desire for more women in
their graduate programs.

He explained that the plan, which
was initiated last year, sets guidelines
which should be followed to achieve
the desired goals, but sets no specific
quotas which the university is required
to fill. It calls primarily for a review of
the extent to which a department
attempts to seek out women and
minority candidates for graduate and
faculty positions.
Bienenstock indicated that the
History department is considered a
problem because it has only one
woman professor and the desired
minimum goal is two.
One Opening
There is one professorial opening in
the History Department this year, but
Bienenstock emphasized, "One thing I
could not do is stop an appointment
because it does not meet a goal."
Professor Craig said the problem
was basically that there had been no
Affirmative Action candidates who
adequately met the qualifications for
recent openings. He added that
although his department had
attempted to find minority and
women candidates for the present
opening, the department committee
that reviews applications had narrowed
the candidates down to seven men.
Craig also said "The fact that we
lose a professor does not mean that we
will get [another] one." He explained
that even with retirements and leaves
of absence the number of openings in
the department are few. Craig added,
however, that the retirement of four
senior professors including himself
may cause openings in the near future.
In a question-answer period
following the discussion, some
students questioned the "lack of
concern" for Chicano priorities in the
Affirmative Action plan.
Bienenstock affirmed that there
was a definite disproportion between
the number of Chicano students and
the number of Chicano professors, and
said that this was a major concern of
the university because of HEW
regulations.
However, he and Craig agreed that
there were simply not enough Chicano
applicants, especially in the History
Department, to achieve the proper
proportion.
"A basic problem," Craig
explained, "is that the law says we
cannot discriminate for race, creed,
color or religion." Because of that law,
an applicant can't be hired simply
because he belongs to a minority
group, he said.

that even with retirements and leaves
of absence the number of openings in
the department are few. Craig added,
however, that the retirement of four
senior professors including himself
may cause openings in the near future.
In a question-answer period
following the discussion, some
students questioned the "lack of
concern" for Chicano priorities in the
Affirmative Action plan.
Bienenstock affirmed that there
was a definite disproportion between
the number of Chicano students and
the number of Chicano professors, and
said that this was a major concern of
the university because of HEW
regulations.
However, he and Craig agreed that
there were simply not enough Chicano
applicants, especially in the History
Department, to achieve the proper
proportion.
"A basic problem," Craig
explained, "is that the law says we
cannot discriminate for race, creed,
color or religion." Because of that law,
an applicant can't be hired simply
because he belongs to a minority
group, he said.
A discussion designed to eliminate
some of the "ignorance and suspicion"
surrounding the Affirmative Action
plan and faculty hiring was held
yesterday afternoon in the Main
Library. Gordon A. Craig, chairman of
the History Department, and Arthur I.
Bienenstock, vice-provost for faculty
affairs, centered their discourse around
the lack of women professors in the
History Department, but attempted to
correlate their explanations to the
entire University.
Bienenstock said that the
Affirmative Action plan was motivated
by the regulations of the HEW, the
university's desire to get the best
faculty and meet the needs of women
and minority students, and individual
department desire for more women in
their graduate programs.

He explained that the plan, which
was initiated last year, sets guidelines
which should be followed to achieve
the desired goals, but sets no specific
quotas which the university is required
to fill. It calls primarily for a review of
the extent to which a department
attempts to seek out women and
minority candidates for graduate and
faculty positions.
Bienenstock indicated that the
History department is considered a
problem because it has only one
woman professor and the desired
minimum goal is two.
One Opening
There is one professorial opening in
the History Department this year, but
Bienenstock emphasized, "One thing I
could not do is stop an appointment
because it does not meet a goal."
Professor Craig said the problem
was basically that there had been no
Affirmative Action candidates who
adequately met the qualifications for
recent openings. He added that
although his department had
attempted to find minority and
women candidates for the present
opening, the department committee
that reviews applications had narrowed
the candidates down to seven men.
Craig also said "The fact that we
lose a professor does not mean that we
will get [another] one." He explained
that even with retirements and leaves
of absence the number of openings in
the department are few. Craig added,
however, that the retirement of four
senior professors including himself
may cause openings in the near future.
