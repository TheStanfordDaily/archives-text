## Proposition One 
### 
•• The Daily urges a NO vote on Proposition One, Gov.
Reagan's tax plan initiative, in next Tuesday's statewide
special election.
The mechanism of the governor's proposal is relatively
shnple: it limits the amount of money the state legislature
can raise by taxation. If passed, it would limit this figure to
8.75 percent of the state's total personal income next year,
and would lower that ceiling by .1 percent a year until 1989.
There have been as many predictions about the plan's
effects as there are politicians, economists and political
soothsayers. The fact is that no one knows for sure what will
happen if the plan is passed — but even the possible
consequences provide grounds enough to oppose the plan.
Tragic experience has shown that higher education has
been among the first to suffer in the state's many financial
crises. If Proposition One is approved, the University of
California's only alternative to state tax revenues will be
increased tuition — and UC then runs the risk of pricing
itself out of the market it was established to serve.
Passage of the initiative would by necessity force a
cutback in the number and scope of state programs, many of
which may have to be assumed by local government. The
local governments will have little choice but to seek an
increase in the property tax rate, adding to the burden of
the already-beleagured middle-class homeowner.
In addition, passage of the tax plan would amount to a
further emasculation of the state legislature. The legislature
loses its power of determining the amount of taxes raised,
while the governor retains his right to blue-pencil approved
state budget expenditures. Thus, the delicate balance
between governor and legislature on budgetary matters is
tilted decisively in favor of the executive.
Proposition One needs a simple majority vote for
passage. Its proponents have mounted a slick, well-financed
campaign, and it will take a major turnout of opposed voters
to prevent its passage. We call on our readers to make sure
that they vote, and to kill this ill-conceived proposal.
