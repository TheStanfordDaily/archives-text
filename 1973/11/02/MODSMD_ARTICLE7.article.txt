"Vi cup heaven
M cup earth
1 table in Baroque secular art
1 Tbsp. flesh
1 Tbsp. spirit

Mix heaven and earth until a
synthesis is formed; do the same
with flesh and spirit. Place the
whole gloppy mess on the table.
Chug the bottle of Botticelli and
shout, "Oh, what a sweet thing
this perspective is!" You'll do so
well in Art History that you'll
want to frame the test.

Divide California into new
congressional districts, each
approaching equal mathematical
standards, although you are
allowed some leeway to proceed
along existing political
subidivisions, as long as your plan
is rational, of compelling interest,
and not either invidious, arbitrary,
vague, or smelly. Sprinkle pages of
Constitution with Adolph's Meat
Tenderizer and eat, making sure
to properly digest it all. If this
doesn't bring you before the bar,

it'll put you behind them.

There you have it kids: a whole
study weekend of delish scarfings
from the incanta — recipe books
of Big Chef Bosco. Irregularity
troubling you? A good way to
clean the whole system out is to
listen to Chef Bosco's radio show,
Monday and Friday at 6:30 p.m.
and Wednesday at 11 a.m.
If you'd like to contact the
Chef for questions of other
menus, drop him a line care of

the Criminally Insane, Via Dolores
717, Universita Stanfordo.
