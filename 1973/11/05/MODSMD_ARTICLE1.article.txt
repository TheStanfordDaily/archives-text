# P.A. Council Supports Campus Liquor Sales
## 
### CHRIS TOREM 
Bottled liquor may soon be sold on
campus if the Palo Alto City Council
has its way.
The council voted 7-1 Thursday to
"urge" the California state legislature
to end the legal "prohibition of
package sales" within V/i miles of
college campuses.
Another bill passed earlier this year
ended the ban on campus liquor sales,
but the law will not become effective
until Jan. 1, 1979.
Change Likely
Mayor Kirke Comstock, a supporter
of the council resolution, thought that
there was a "good chance" that the
state would change the law.
Assemblyman Dixon Arnett,
R-Redwood City, has been lining up
the support of a number of city
councils to end campus "dry zones"
since the earlier bill was passed,
Comstock said. If Arnett gets enough
support, the legislators in Sacramento
will probably "defer to him" in his
area.
Arnett, a Stanford graduate and
former University administrator, has
included a clause in his bill specifically
exempting Stanford from the state
liquor ban, even though Stanford is
outside his district.
'Compromise'
Councilman Byron Sher, another
supporter of the council action and a
law professor here, said that the earlier
bill had been a "compromise"
designed to protect all campus package
stores whose business would be hurt
by the on or near-campus competition.
While he felt that the influence of
package stores across the state might
hurt the chances of the new bill, Sher
added that the efforts of UCLA and
other large universities such as
Stanford, might have a strong impact.

The lone dissenter to the council's
action, John Berwald, objected
because "it's not good planning. There
is a proliferation of liquor stores along
El Camino. There are other types of
developments which are more
valuable."
Varying Reactions
Local liquor merchants had varying
reactions to the council move.
Mike Mac Donald, the manager of
Ernie's Liquors in Palo Alto, said that
most liquor stores would welcome the
chance to get close to Stanford. "I
guarantee that Ernie's has it in the
works and so do the other big stores,"
he said.
Mac Donald was especially
enthusiastic since he had heard that
the new resolution would only allow
established package stores within four
miles of the campus to move closer.
"Some guy couldn't just come in and
set up," he added.
The manager of El Camino's A-l
Liquor Stores had a different reaction
to the council's action. "Tell them to
go fly a kite," he said.
Student Mobility
"We've been moved enough. Let us
stay where we are." He cited student
mobility as a reason for not bringing
liquor stores up to or into Stanford.
Lee Junta, one of the owners of
Roily Sommer-Norm Standlee, a
Redwood City liquor store, was unsure
about the change.
"It could hurt our business since
we're so far away. On the other hand,
I might be in favor of it if we could
put a liquor store there."
Little Leland's
If the liquor ban should be lifted,
Encina Snack Bar will probably be the
first public campus spot to apply for a
license.
