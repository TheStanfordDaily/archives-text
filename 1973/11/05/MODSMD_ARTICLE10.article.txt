# Contributions And The Liberal University
## Packard Urges Corporations To Be Judicious 
###

If you didn't read this page last
Thursday, you should have.
On that day were reprinted
excerpts from a recent speech by
David Packard, who is chairman
of the board of the
Hewlett-Packard Company and,
incidentally, one of this
University's largest contributors.
Speaking before the
Committee for Corporate Support
of American Universities, Mr.
Packard said corporations should
restrict their contributions to
universities "to those areas you
believe are educating the right
kind of professors."
Indeed, Mr. Packard
elaborated, not only the "right

kind" of professors, but in the
"right kind" of discipline.
'Be Specific'
"In the future," he exhorted
his fellow corporate contributors,
"let's focus our money and our
energy on those schools and
departments which are strong and
which also contribute in some
specific way to our individual
companies, or to the general
welfare of our free enterprise
system [italics mine]."
Mr. Packard was more specific
on the matter of those who do
not contribute than on those who
do: "hostile groups of scholars
[who] are, to a large degree,
responsible for the anti-business

bias of many of our young people
today. And I do not believe it is in
the corporate interest to support
them — which is what we do to a
greater or a lesser degree with
unrestricted funds .. .
"Is kicking ROTC programs off
the campus the kind of leadership
we need?
"Is prohibiting business from
recruiting on campus the kind of
leadership we need?
"Should these universities serve
as havens for radicals who want to
destroy the free enterprise
system?
"Should students be taught
that American corporations are
evil and deserve to be brought
under government control?"
I think it a fair inference that
Mr. Packard's unvoiced answer is
no.
Increase Corporate Influence
The gentleman, a former
Stanford trustee, urges what
smacks of academic
totalitarianism: a radical
intensification of corporate
industry's already formidable
influence over the universities, a
kind of plutocracy in much of
America's intellectual life, a
determination of which scholars
and theorists will be financially
able to conduct their work by
how well they serve the interests
of corporate America — and how
little they indulge in serious
criticism of the existing order.
But Mr. Packard is not
advancing new ideas. Indeed, he
noted, one reason for corporate
contributions to the universities
has always been"the very many
ways in which the universities,
both public and private, [have]
contributed to the growth and
prosperity of American business
and industry over the years."
Mr. Packard's comments are
thus instructive in two directions.
They shed great, if only
confirmatory, light on the social
role corporate leaders presently

assign the universities, the role
which — depending on the success
of corporate rule — is the actual
role the universities play. And
they suggest, in a time of
contracting economy, tightening
academic finances, and waning
corporate tolerance, an even more
ominous future.
Similar To Radical Rhetoric
It is ironic that Mr. Packard's
account of why the corporations
support the universities jibes so
well with radical critiques.
Corporate aid, Mr. Packard said,
was intended to support graduate
schools that "were a major source
of professional people who would
be needed by the corporation .. .
were the centers of important
research."
Corporate funds (at least
according to Packard) are
intended to support training for
future corporate technicians and
research for current corporate
needs — not free lunches for
critics of the free enterprise
system.
That, of course, is what
radicals have been saying all
along: the universities'
self-proclaimed role as liberal
sanctuaries of intellectual dialogue
and social criticism is, if not
illusory, peripheral to the real
function of the academy.
Even Clark Kerr has echoed
this analysis: "The university, in
particular, has become in
America, and in other nations as
well, a prime instrument of
national purpose." The meaning
of "national purpose" in Nixonian
America requires no elaboration.
Disastrous Attacks
Thus — to bring the discussion
close to home — the attacks on
the University by the Stanford
Rehabilitation Movement in
1971-72 were theoretically quite
logical, if tactically disastrous (a
subtler analysis of the real
possibilities of "rehabilitating"
the University, in a Gramscian

sense, might have achieved much
more).
This is hardly surprising to
many readers. More intriguing,
perhaps, is the question of what
Mr. Packard's comments portend
for the universities' future.
The most salient possibility, in
a time of flagging private
contributions, is increased
dependence on corporate largesse.
If other corporate donors hear Mr.
Packard's message, that largesse
may come only with strings
attached.
The situation here may be
relatively good because of the
ballyhooed Campaign for
Stanford. But the Campaign won't
last forever.
Resources Threatened
Thus the "corporate interest"
Mr. Packard spoke of may carry
more and more weight in the
overall allocation of university
resources.
The shifts in resources need
not be large to result in wholesale
transformation of the character of
the universities. Tighter finances
have already brought a near-freeze
of faculty promotions here.
University officials last week
declared a shift to a lower rate of
growth — except, curiously, for
new buildings in chemistry,
engineering, and earth sciences.
The character of the place is
changing already.
Academic liberalism was
feasible when times were good. In
what has been called "the
academic depression of the
seventies," it may prove
something of a luxury for
universities who can only find
backing for the training of
technocrats.
