Proposition One
Editor:
May I suggest some questions
we should be asking ourselves
about Proposition 1, the proposed
constitutional amendment on
which we must vote November 6?
Q. Do we want the budget and
revenues of our State of California
under the control of a three-man
commission, only one member of
which is elected by the people?
A. No. We must ensure that the
vital tasks of making the budget
and determining sources of
revenue remain in the hands of
our own directly-elected state
assemblymen and senators. We
can hold them accountable at the
ballot box at regular intervals.
Q. Do we want our state
income and expenditures confined
in a strait jacket by a
permanent formula which is
unresponsive to changing rates of
economic growth?
A. No. The formula which
Proposition 1 would lock into our
state constitution is based on the
assumption that the annual
inflation rate will be no more than
3 percent. This is both inflexible
and totally unrealistic. As every
consumer knows, the rate has
been as high as 8 percent in the
last few years.
Q. Do we want Proposition 1
to become a part of the
Constitution of the State of
California?
A. No. Remember, Proposition
1 is not a piece of legislation. It is
a constitutional amendment. If it
doesn't work, it cannot be
changed without another special
election costing us, the taxpayers,
thousands more dollars. I hope
the voters will reject this costly,
ill-conceived experiment.

Stillman House Vintage
Editor:
I have read with much interest
the articles on the moving of
Stillman House and the many
difficulties resulting from the
delay in its being made ready for
occupancy. There is one minor
correction that I should like to
point out. Stillman House is called
"a relic from 1896," but the
house, originally the Kappa Alpha
Theta sorority house, was not
built until shortly after 1900 — I
am not at the moment sure of the
exact date.
My house, next door to the
vacated Stillman site, was built by
my father's cousin and her
husband in 1899. I have
photographs taken by my father
in 1900 or 1901 which show the
Beta Theta Pi house and our
house, and these were the only
two houses on that side of Lasuen
Street in that block; there were
only fields beyond and across the
street. I realize that this matter of
dates is not a momentous one, but
perhaps it is worth noting that the
much remodelled Stillman House
is not quite as ancient a relic as
your otherwise excellent article
indicates!

Effects Of Tax Bill
Editor:
As a Daily staffer, I wish to
express my dissent to the paper's
editorial opposition to
Proposition 1 (November 2).
The editorial states, . . no
one knows for sure what will

happen if the plan is passed." The
painful fact is that we do know
for sure what will happen if the
restraints of Proposition 1 are not
placed: the free-wheeling spenders
of the state legislature will tax
Californians' income to oblivion.
The Daily complains that
Proposition 1 will result in
increased tuition for the
University of California. Isn't this
increase exactly what has been
proposed by numerous
commissions on education as a
means of reducing the tuition gap
between private and
tax-supported institutions?
The editorial fears "further
emasculation of the state
legislature." If emasculation is in
this case a reduction of the power
to tax, then the trimming is
indeed a healthy one.
When we read that proponents
of Proposition 1 are mounting a
"well-financed campaign," lets's
remember that employees of
Assembly Speaker Bob Morretti
are working full-time at state
expense to defeat the measure.
In all the confusion
surrounding the meaning and
effects of this proposal, one fact
must remain clear: Proposition 1
is the last, best hope for reducing
the growth and cost of state
government — nothing more,
nothing less.

Genocide Is Genocide
Editor:
I should like to object to the
Daily's use of the word
"benevolent" in its "Support
Benevolent Genocide" headnote

to Shockley's article on the Relfs.
Any reading of Shockley's own
publications on genetics clearly
indicates that his proposals imply
genocide, and that they are hardly
benevolent.
Shockley's main concern is
what he calls dysgenics —
"retrogressive evolution though
the disproportionate reproduction
of the genetically disadvantaged."
He says that he is worried by the
threat of successive generations of
low IQ welfare families, by the
menace of low IQ acid-throwing
criminals, and by the development
of an intellectually retarded black
caste.
Shockley's solution for social
disorder would be some form of
genetic engineering; his most
concrete proposal is a "voluntary"
sterilization bonus program. Such
a program would provide large
cash rewards for sterilization to all
those who do not pay income
taxes. There is a certain amount
of sloppiness in this proposal (it
seems Nixon might be eligible),
but the bonus program is aimed
primarily at the reserve army of
the unemployed — those who, at
the edge of subsistence, would
have no real choice. Shockley's
solution is therefore a form of
genocide — the annihilation by
the state of a socio-economically
defined group.
No one doubts that Shockley
considers himself to be a righteous
man, but that does not make his
proposals benevolent. In capitalist
class society, the linking of
economic incentives to the
sterilization of an oppressed
group is clearly genocide. Call
Shockley's projects disguised
genocide or gradual genocide, but
genocide they are, and dangerous.
