# Papers Split On Nixon Quitting
## 
### Associated Press 
Several newspapers have called
for President Nixon to resign
because of growing entanglements
in the Watergate case, while others
have challenged suggestions that
the President is losing the ability

to govern.
The New York Times, citing
what it called "the visible
disintegration of President
Nixon's moral and political
authority," said yesterday Nixon
should resign before the nation is

forced to go through "the
traumatic and divisive process of
impeachment."
Others carrying editorials that
urged Nixon to resign included
three newspapers which supported
him in the past: the Detroit News,
the Denver Post, and the Atlanta
Journal.
Meanwhile, the Indianapolis
Star and the Omaha World-Herald
were among newspapers disputing
arguments that Nixon has lost the
ability to govern.
The New York Times, a
frequent administration critic,
said: "The deceitful manipulation
of the presidential war-making
powers, the deliberate violations
of the law in the national security
investigations and the abuse of the
impoundment authority have all
created in the minds of the people
the enduring conviction that Mr.
Nixon has little respect for the
restraint of the law and no real
understanding of constitutional
checks and balances ...
"The one last great service that
Mr. Nixon can now perform for
his country is to resign ... As
long as he clings to office, he
keeps the presidency swamped in
a sea of scandal and the American
public in a morass of concern and
confusion."
The Detroit News, which
supported Nixon in his three
presidential campaigns, said Nixon

should resign after Rep. Gerald R.
Ford has been confirmed as vice
president.
The Denver Post, which
supported Nixon in the 1972
election, said: "If President Nixon
chooses to resign after a qualified
successor is in office, it would be
easier for the country and better
for him in the history uooks . .
The Atlanta Journal, which
also supported Nixon for
re-election, has called for Nixon
to have the patriotism to resign
from office, saying impeachment
was too divisive a process for the
nation.
But the Indianapolis Star, a
long-time Nixon supporter, said
there have been "a couple of
signs" that pointed toward
continuing presidential strength in
domestic affairs.
The Star said eight presidential
vetoes have been sustained by
Congress this year, adding: "A
president who wins eight veto
tests in a space of nine months,
with no defeats, hardly fits the
description of a president who is
losing the power to govern."
The Omaha World-Herald,
generally favorable to the Nixon
administration, editorialized:
"The resignation or impeachment
of the President are possibilities.
We think it would be unwise for
the country to assume that they
are more than that."
