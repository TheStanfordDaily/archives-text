# Bart Opens SF Service; East Bay Link Open In '74?

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -
About 36,000 commuters were
expected to abandon cars and
buses today and step aboard a
$1.6 billion space age subway
system skimming from the
financial district here to suburban
Daly City. Officials hope to open
a link with the East Bay sometime
next year
The official opening Saturday
of the eight-station, 7.5-mile Bay
Area Rapid Transit District spur
was heralded by a ceremonial
train, parade, banners, speeches
and free rolls of famous San
Francisco sourdough bread in
"Welcome BART" wrappers.
"BART is really awesome. This
is like a space age palace, a
cathedral consecrated to the mass
age â€” but I like it," said Cynthia
Roberts, 41, a self-described
poetess. "It's got everything from
inspiring dimensions and marble
floors to girlie magazines."
Mayor Joseph Alioto called
BART "a major triumph over the
political clout of the automobile
and freeway lobbies."
With completion of the San

Francisco-Daly City service,
BART now operates
computerized electric trains on
both sides of San Francisco Bay.
But BART won't be allowed to
connect the lines through the
$180 million transbay tube until
the Public Utilities Commission
approves the system's automatic
train controls.
BART officials hope for full
service by mid-1974, but they're
not making any promises.
For 35 cents, a commuter can
board BART at the Montgomery
Street station and arrive in Daly
City in 13 minutes. BART trains
also stop at Powell, Civic Center,
16th Street, 24th Street, Glen
Park, Balboa Park and Daly City.
