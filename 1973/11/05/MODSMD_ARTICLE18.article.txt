# Cards Outlast Stubborn Beavers For Fifth Victory
## 
### DAVE ROBINSON 
CORVALLIS, Ore. — A crowd of 17,025 Oregon
State partisans braved the cold and the rain Saturday at
Parker Stadium to see the Beavers "play their hearts
out" for OSU coach Dee Andros.
But Stanford's Cardinals, trailing until the game's
final minutes, coolly executed a fourth quarter
comeback that ruined OSU's upset hopes and gave the
Cards a 24-23 victory, Stanford's fifth in a season that
started miserably eight weeks ago but still may become
one of the more memorable in the Farm's history.
"Character, poise ... there are a lot of words that
could describe it," said Stanford coach Jack
Christiansen, "but our players just believed that they'd
come back."
They did come back, of course, but not before
surviving two minor crises. First, defensive back Jim
Kaffen made a play that looked like it would merely
prolong Stanford's agony but instead may have won the
game for the Cards.
Midway in the fourth quarter, Oregon State halfback
Bill Cecil took a pitchout from quarterback Alvin White
and darted 57 yards through an abnormally porous
Cardinal defense, breaking two tackles and almost
reaching the end zone. Kaffen finally made a shoestring
stop at the one, and the Beavers never crossed the goal
line. After an illegal procedure penalty, two rushing
attempts and an incomplete pass, they settled for a field
goal that gave OSU a 23-21 lead with 8:03 remaining.
Second Crisis
Stanford then received the kickoff and drove 46
yards to the Beaver 19, whereupon Christiansen faced a
second crisis. On fourth and one, with 4:30 remaining,
Rod Garcia lined up for a field goal. The kick was good,
but Oregon State was ruled offside and Christiansen had
to decide whether to take the sure three points or accept
the penalty, which would have given the Cards a first

down on the 14, with at least four more plays to kill
time and possibly score a touchdown.
Chris opted for the three points, even though he said
"on a normal day you would probably keep the ball and
run out the clock." But Saturday was no normal day,
and he wisely chose to avoid any unnecessary risks.
Christiansen's decision gave Stanford a 24-23 lead and
"put the pressure back on them," but the Card
defenders had to feel a little nervous themselves,
especially after the Beavers made a first down on the
next play.
Three ensuing attempts failed to move the ball much
farther however, and when Oregonian Terry Pape nailed
White nine yards behind the line of scrimmage, all
Stanford had to do was keep the ball for 2:27 to get the
win.
Afterward, Andros was despondent. "I feel terrible,"
he said, obviously suffering more for his players than for
any personal consequences of OSU's 1-7 record. "The
kids played their hearts out. I never saw a team that
wanted to win more."
First Half Dominance
In the first half, before Christiansen said the defense
"really started tackling," it seemed like the Beavers'
enthusiasm might bring a victory. In fact OSU
completely outplayed Stanford in the first 30 minutes
and the Cards escaped to the locker room trailing 20-15
only because of some timely heroins by 18 year-old
freshman Ron Inge.
After OSU took an early 3-0 lead, Inge returned the
kickoff 67 yards, a play that led to a Garcia field goal.
Then the Beavers scored 10 straight points, leaving the
Cardinals in a semi-panic situation with 8:26 remaining
in the second quarter.
Inge revitalized the Cards in 13 seconds, however,
when he returned the OSU kickoff 96 yards for a
touchdown. "The blocking was just great," said Inge,

who remembered key blocks by Bruce Blackstone and
Ray Anderson, but after that, "I didn't look back."
Scoring passes from Boryla to Eric Test and Bill
Singler (Singler caught six passes in all) accounted for
the other Stanford touchdowns.
"We played good football," Christiansen said. "I was
pleased with our spirit — everybody's got their heads
together."
After the game, everybody's head was looking toward
next week, when the Cards meet USC in the Los Angeles
Coliseum.
"I'll tell you one thing," said a smiling Inge. "We'll be
up for the next one."

Cardinal Notes: Boryla is now the third leading passer
in Stanford history with a career total of 3646 yards.
Boryla moved past John Brodie midway in the third
quarter Saturday and now trails only Dick Norman
(3738) and Jim Plunkett (7544).
Garcia, who kicked two field goals against the
Beavers, is two kicks away from tying Bob Jacob's
all-time NCAA rccord of 37.
Only three people in Parker Stadium knew what was
happening when Boryla ran for 12 yards on a bootleg
play late in the fourth quarter. Defensive coordinator
Norb Hecker, who came up with the play, told Boryla to
call a sweep to the left in the huddle and then put the
ball on his hip and take off to the right. Christiansen was
the only other person involved in the plot.
Inge, who gained 164 yards on two kickoff returns
and added 37 yards rushing, was named offensive player
of the game. Pat Donovan earned the defensive honor
for his 10 tackles, eight of which were unassisted.
Sig Ostrom seemed to maneuver the best on the
Parker Stadium Astro-turf. Ostrom, who wore tennis
shoes, gained 44 yards on eight carries.
