# Lavender Panthers Retaliate
## Gay Group Urges 'Self-Defense' 
### LAURIE LUCAS 
"Two, four, six, eight. Gay is just as good as straight!"
Circling an entrance to the San Francisco Hilton Hotel
in a recent picket demonstration, the Rev. Ray Broshears
and a handful of gay people chanted and waved signs.
"There is no bail for the Hilton jail!"
Broshears and his followers were protesting against the
alleged use of the Hilton garage as a holding cell for gays
allegedly enticed and entrapped into immoral acts by vice
squad undercover agents who supposedly cruise the
Tenderloin as bait for hustlers.
'Queer Bashing'
"This queer-bashing has got to stop," said Broshears,
himself a victim of two thug beatings. He held up a hand
with two paralyzed fingers, a result of a July assault.
Broshears is credited as co ordinator of the Lavender
Panthers, a militant organization of homosexuals formed
last April in response to a rash of assaults on gay
individuals in the Tenderloin. The activities of the
Lavender Panthers have been covered in Time and Rolling
Stone.
"You are looking at the head Panther now," declared
Broshears, who admitted that no other Panther was
present at this particular protest against the Hilton.
Broshears is strangely reticent about the details of the
Panthers — their membership, activities and whereabouts.
"The government is on our ass," he said.
Separate Organization
In an effort to clarify those points supposedly
distorted by the media, Broshears emphasized that his
Lavender Panther squad is not a part of his Helping Hands
Gay Community Center, but a "separate and distinct
political body from all other gay organizations."
Counteracting the effete, limp-wristed stereotype of
the homosexual "pansy" or "sissy," the Lavender Panther
patrol is comprised of 21 members, some of whom are

ex-cons and lesbians, all skilled in karate and judo.
"The group is not a group of 'vigilantes' as portrayed
by the media," continued Broshears. "They are organized
devoted to teaching political, as well as physical
self-defense. Dedicated to the completion of the American
Revolution, the membership is secret to protect the
members and make even more effective the actions
taken."
Broshears shrugged his shoulders with a sigh: "Drag
queens, old folk, hustlers, ex-cons, transsexuals and queers
see me as their last hope."
Weapons In Self-Defense
Advocating the use of weapons in self-defense, the
Panthers urge that each home own a rifle or shotgun. A
rifle, cartridges and a formidable looking "umbrella"
which doubles as a club remain at close hand in Broshears'
desk drawer: a testament to the Panther policy of
self-defense.
"You must make every move count," exhorts a
Lavender Panther circular, entitled, Unarmed
Self-Defense. The advice continues: "Don't waste energy
by flailing or throwing blows that do not damage.
"For example, slaps, blows to the shoulders or chest do
little good at all. One blow with focused energy is better
than 20 ineffective blows. Learn one punch, strike or kick
and practice it.
"One of the most effective techniques to learn first is
the eye-poke. If done correctly it will immediately disable
the attacker and enable you to get away, which is the
ultimate defense .... No matter what your size, your
build, if you can learn the basics, you can knock the hell
out of your attacker, no matter how big or strong."
But a mild affectation belies Broshears' two-fisted state
of alert against potential danger. "When all else fails," he
added, "kick them in the vital regions. All's fair in love
and war."

Broshears is credited as co ordinator of the Lavender
Panthers, a militant organization of homosexuals formed
last April in response to a rash of assaults on gay
individuals in the Tenderloin. The activities of the
Lavender Panthers have been covered in Time and Rolling
Stone.
"You are looking at the head Panther now," declared
Broshears, who admitted that no other Panther was
present at this particular protest against the Hilton.
Broshears is strangely reticent about the details of the
Panthers — their membership, activities and whereabouts.
"The government is on our ass," he said.
Separate Organization
In an effort to clarify those points supposedly
distorted by the media, Broshears emphasized that his
Lavender Panther squad is not a part of his Helping Hands
Gay Community Center, but a "separate and distinct
political body from all other gay organizations."
Counteracting the effete, limp-wristed stereotype of
the homosexual "pansy" or "sissy," the Lavender Panther
patrol is comprised of 21 members, some of whom are

ex-cons and lesbians, all skilled in karate and judo.
"The group is not a group of 'vigilantes' as portrayed
by the media," continued Broshears. "They are organized
devoted to teaching political, as well as physical
self-defense. Dedicated to the completion of the American
Revolution, the membership is secret to protect the
members and make even more effective the actions
taken."
Broshears shrugged his shoulders with a sigh: "Drag
queens, old folk, hustlers, ex-cons, transsexuals and queers
see me as their last hope."
Weapons In Self-Defense
Advocating the use of weapons in self-defense, the
Panthers urge that each home own a rifle or shotgun. A
rifle, cartridges and a formidable looking "umbrella"
which doubles as a club remain at close hand in Broshears'
desk drawer: a testament to the Panther policy of
self-defense.
"You must make every move count," exhorts a
Lavender Panther circular, entitled, Unarmed
Self-Defense. The advice continues: "Don't waste energy
by flailing or throwing blows that do not damage.
"For example, slaps, blows to the shoulders or chest do
little good at all. One blow with focused energy is better
than 20 ineffective blows. Learn one punch, strike or kick
and practice it.
"One of the most effective techniques to learn first is
the eye-poke. If done correctly it will immediately disable
the attacker and enable you to get away, which is the
ultimate defense .... No matter what your size, your
build, if you can learn the basics, you can knock the hell
out of your attacker, no matter how big or strong."
But a mild affectation belies Broshears' two-fisted state
of alert against potential danger. "When all else fails," he
added, "kick them in the vital regions. All's fair in love
and war."
"Two, four, six, eight. Gay is just as good as straight!"
Circling an entrance to the San Francisco Hilton Hotel
in a recent picket demonstration, the Rev. Ray Broshears
and a handful of gay people chanted and waved signs.
"There is no bail for the Hilton jail!"
Broshears and his followers were protesting against the
alleged use of the Hilton garage as a holding cell for gays
allegedly enticed and entrapped into immoral acts by vice
squad undercover agents who supposedly cruise the
Tenderloin as bait for hustlers.
'Queer Bashing'
"This queer-bashing has got to stop," said Broshears,
himself a victim of two thug beatings. He held up a hand
with two paralyzed fingers, a result of a July assault.
