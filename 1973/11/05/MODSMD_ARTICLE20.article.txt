# Pac-8 Roundup
## USC, UCLA Trounce Two More Opponents 
### 
As usual, the results of
Saturday's Pacific Eight
conference action can be
summarized as follows: USC and
UCLA moved another step closer
toward their battle for the Rose
Bowl berth Nov. 24 in the
Coliseum.
The Trojans and Bruins both
embarrassed their opponents
Saturday, USC beating California
50-14 and UCLA whipping
Washington 62-13. Both victors
are 4-0 in conference play.
Meanwhile, Oregon's title hopes
were dashed by Washington State
21-14.
In Berkeley, Anthony Davis
finally showed his 1972 spark,
scoring five touchdowns on runs
of six, 15, one and 20 yards and
an 80-yard free kick return. The
Bears put up a good fight against
the ninth-ranked Trojans through
three quarters, trailing only 21-7,
but Cal's effort to play catch-up
in the fourth quarter failed
miserably.
While Davis ran explosively,
tailbacks Rod McNeill and Alle.i
Carter also had impressive days
for the Trojans. McNeill ran for
164 yards on 24 carries, and
CArter picked up 90 yards in only
10 carries.
Meanwhile, UCLA literally ran
over Washington, scoring more
than 50 points for the fourth time

in its last five games. Quarterback
John Sciarra gained an incredible
130 yards on five carries, Kermit
Johnson added 141 yards on 11
carries and freshman Wendell
Tyler scored three fourth-quarter
touchdowns as the Bruins
continued to rewrite the rushing
record books.
In Pullman, Washington State
quarterback Charlie Peck guided
the Cougars through a snowstorm
to a fourth-quarter touchdown
which beat Oregon, 21-14.
The Ducks had taken a 14-10
lead after two touchdown passes
from Herb Singleton to Greg
Lindsay. But a WSU defensive
back fell on an Oregon fumble at
midfield late in the game,
whereupon WSU drove for the
winning touchdown.

RETURN TO VICTORY — Freshman Ron Inge, shown here barreling
upfield against Washington State last week, sparked Stanford to
victory Saturday against Oregon State. Inge returned one kickoff 96
yards for a touchdown and another 67 yards as the Cards edged the
Beavers, 24-23.
