# Soccer Team Ties Cal, 0-0

### BRUCE KADDEN 
The Stanford and California soccer teams battled
to a scoreless tie Saturday, before one of the largest
crowds of the season on the Cards home field. It
was Stanford's first tie of the season, to go along
with an 8-4 record.
The game was typical of contests between the
cross-bay rivals, with more action than one could
ask for, despite the lack of scoring.
Stanford kicked off and immediately went on
the offensive, playing a fine control game. The
Cards passed well, and when they got the open shot
within range, fired at the net.
Toward the middle of the first half, the game
evened out, as the action took place on the center
of the field. Both teams managed to mount
occasional attacks, but these were frustrated by
sound defense and excellent goal-tending.
Walt Harris guarded the Stanford net, gaining his
sixth shutout of the season in 13 games. He was
aided by fine defensive play, especially from Mac
Taylor and Tom Miller, who were able to clear the
ball from the area near Stanford's goal.
Rushed Attempts
Offensively, Johnny Murao and Brian Bershader
provided the spark in the first half, as they took
numerous close-range shots and set up others with
fine passes. But the Cal defense forced rushed
attempts that were either right at the goalie or wide
of the mark.
Cal played much better in the second half, but

Stanford's defense rose to the occasion, stopping
the Bear attack. Harris was forced to make a few
diving saves to keep the game scoreless, as Cal
managed some close shots.
The Bears controlled the game from the halfway
point in the second period, until there were 10
minutes left in the game, when the Cards came alive.
They worked the ball down the field, highlighted
by Marty Glickfeld's tricky dribbling, and pressured
the Cal goalie. Bershader had the Card's best chance
with five minutes left when he had the ball alone
with only the goalie to beat, but the ball took a bad
bounce, and Bershader's kick was stopped by the
goalie.
Tempers Flare
The game had two other happenings that seem to
occur whenever the schools get together. A fight
started late in the game, as tempers flared, but it
was quickly halted. And one of the canine
population made his appearance on the field, leaving
his calling card for Coach Fred Priddle to remove by
shovel.
Stanford's next game is Wednesday at 2 p.m.
against Cal Stateâ€”Hayward, on Harry Maloney field.
The Cards will have to win all four remaining games
to have a slim chance of gaining the playoffs.
Four teams are chosen from the West Coast by
coaches. USF and UCLA appear to have two of
those places clinched, but the other two spots are
still up for grabs.
