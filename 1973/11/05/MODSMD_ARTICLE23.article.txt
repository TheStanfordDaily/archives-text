# Shuffling The CardS
## The 						Great Pumpkin 
### Dave Robinson 
CORVALLIS, Oreg. — Oregon State coach Dee
Andros, bedecked in an orange jacket, orange and
black tie, orange socks and orange and black shoes,
charged onto the playing field Saturday, sprinting as
fast as his oddly proportioned body could take him.
His hip was hurting and his 5-10, 250 pound
frame (estimated) was hardly suited for a 70-yard
dash, but the Great Pumpkin ran anyway.
"I had my adrenalin up — that's why I ran out on
the field," Andros said. "I'm gonna have the darned
thing [hip] operated on anyway. If the kids want it,
I'll crawl out on the field next week."
Andros has been winning football games,
amusing the press and chomping cigars in Pac-8
stadiums for nine years now. Until 1971 his Oregon
State teams were winners, and in 1967 he was
elected "West Coast Coach of the Year" after
leading his "Giant Killers" to an electrifying upset
over number one ranked USC.
Now, though, the Great Pumpkin has fallen on
hard times. Oregon State is assured of its third
straight losing season, and this year's record
dropped to 1-7 Saturday when Stanford edged the
Beavers 24-23. Andros' career record, which
includes three years at Idaho, has fallen to a
mediocre 57-60-2.
"It just tears me up inside," he said of the
frustrating season. And after Saturday's game, he
added, "I feel terrible. The kids played their hearts
out."

Andros certainly had a lot to do with the fact
that the Beavers "played their hearts out." The
players literally swarmed around him before the
game, obviously inspired by the Great Pumpkin's
great sprint.
And after the game, after Andros' "whole team
had done a great job," according to Stanford coach
Jack Christiansen, Andros tried to salvage something
for the rest of the season. "We lost the game — I
refuse to blame mistakes on anyone. We are going to
be playing the rest of the year for those seven
seniors."
For Andros, though, it will be a long winter.
He'll have his hip operation and will then return to
his orange home, where he will sit behind his orange
desk, look longingly at his orange golf bag and
orange electric golf cart, wear his orange scarf and
think endlessly about how to bring winning football
back to Corvallis.
But on September 28, 1974, when the Beavers
take the field for the first time of the season at
Parker Stadium, the Great Pumpkin will
undoubtedly be leading the charge. It will be the
second year of OSU's "New Look," and by then the
young Beavers may have adjusted to Andros' new
passing-oriented game. Oregon State won't be a
Rose Bowl contender, but the Beavers won't be
cellar-dwellers either.
And Dee Andros, "a fine, fat man" according to
Christiansen, will be having a lot of fun.
