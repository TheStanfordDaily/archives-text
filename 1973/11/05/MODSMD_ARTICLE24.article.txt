# Card JV's Accept Davis Gifts, Trounce Visiting Aggies, 41-21
## 
### TIM FERGUSON 
Stanford's junior varsity did
little to deserve an overwhelming
victory, but when UC-Davis' JV
decided to hand them a football
game Friday at Stanford Stadium,
the Cards could hardly refuse.
The visiting Aggies committed
five turnovers on their first six
plays of the second half to give
Stanford three touchdowns which
turned a close contest into a
41-21 rout.
"We should've won by more
than that," said coach Gunther
Cunningham. "1 was pretty
disgusted with them in the first
half, but they came out ready to
play in the second half."
Davis gave Stanford the ball
eight times in all, four times on
the ground and four in the air, but
the Cardinals coughed up the
pigskin on five occasions
themselves in a sloppy game
played on a chilly afternoon.
"I expected it [the Card
turnovers] with the lack of
practice time we've had," said
Cunningham.
Stanford's offense was as cold
as the weather for most of the
first half. Quarterback Mike
Cordova failed to match his earlier
performance against UCLA, in
part because Stanford chose to
stay on the ground most of the
day, rushing for 293 yards against

133 passing.
"1 was leery of throwing," said
Cunningham. "1 didn't want Mike
Cordova to look bad." Cordova,
Cunningham said, was off in his
timing because of lack of practice
time with the JV.
"We practiced the pass offense
before the UCLA game, plus
injuries weren't as big a factor
early in the season," Cunningham
explained as the difference
between the two contests.
"People shouldn't judge him
| Cordova | off that first half."
First Drive
Cunningham's Cards, now 2-1,
scored on their first drive.
Halfback Tom Oberhelman
carried six straight times for 38
yards, then Cordova capped the
drive with a four-yard touchdown
pass to split end Dave Nagler.
Cordova completed only six of
17 passes in the game, but three
were for touchdowns, including
two to Nagler, who led receivers
with three catches for 76 yards.
Oberhelman, a pint-sized
tackle-buster from Gunn High in
Palo Alto, scored Stanford's
second TD in the first quarter
with a five-yard burst. The run
capped a 53-yard Card drive
highlighted by Cordova's 42-yard
pass to a wide-open Nagler.
Oberhelman led Stanford
rushers with 92 yards in 19 carries

(17 in the first half). Cunningham
said the reason for the heavy
workout was "1 wanted to show
Davis what type of team we were.
We wanted to slam it down their
gut."
Cunningham said fullback
Andy Kolesnikow was "knocking
guys five feet in the air" while
blocking for Oberhelman.
While the Cardinals floundered
on the ground for the remainder
of the half, Davis was busy
playing catch-up. Alternating
quarterbacks Paul Mariuzza and
Curtis Schmutte ran a balanced
offense to two second quarter
touchdowns.
TD Passes
Both Davis scores came on
Schmutte passes, as did the
Aggies' last score, late in the
fourth quarter. Davis outgained
Stanford in the air, 179 yards to
133.
Schmutte attempted to pass
Davis into the lead on the PAT
attempt after the second Aggie
touchdown, but the aerial fell
incomplete and Stanford held a
14-13 halftime advantage.
After the intermission, the
turnover disaster struck Davis, and
Stanford scored touchdowns on
Marvin Holmes' seven-yard run,
Cordova's 26-yard toss to flanker
Paul Skrabo in the end-zone (in an
exact repeat of the previous play,
which was incomplete) and a
30-yard TD pass from Cordova to

Nagler.
Chip Underwood missed the
kick after only one of the TD's,
and was six of seven for the game.
Underwood has connected on
nine of 12 for the season.
Final Score
Stanford was to score once
more, at the end of the third
quarter, as Holmes and fullback
Don Stevenson traded carries on a
38-yard drive. Stevenson took the
ball the final five yards.
Cunningham said Holmes' runs
"opened up the middle" and that
his wide receivers "blocked
extremely well."
Larry McGovern ran the
Cardinals' option offense for the
remainder of the game. During
this time Stanford got its longest
run of the day, a 38-yarder by
halfback Greg Smith.
Otherwise, neither team
showed much until Cardinal Tom
Lynn's last punt was blocked and
Davis recovered on the Stanford
23. Three plays later Schmutte
passed for a touchdown to end
Fred Overstreet.
Stanford then got the ball on
its own 48 after a short kick, and
Cunningham called time
repeatedly as McGovern and
company tried to pile another
score onto what was then a clear
rout. The clock finally ran out
with Stanford 15 yards short.
Davis' coach complained about
the "pour-it-on" tactics after the
game, but Cunningham said "I
didn't care what anyone thought
of me. I was worried about Larry
McGovern getting a chance to
play. I felt like we could've scored
80 points if we wanted to."
Despite the close first half,
Cunningham said, "I was never
worried we were gonna lose. We
would just keep running the blast
play until they quit."
