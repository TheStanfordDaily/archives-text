# USC, SJS Top Cardinals
## Poloists Lose Twice In New Pool 
### CHRIS BAKER 
Despite the opening of the new
swim stadium, the Cardinal water
polo team lost both games this
weekend. Friday the Cards lost a
Pacific Eight match to USC, 5-3,
and Saturday the poloists dropped
a 7-6 decision to San Jose State.
"These two losses make it very
difficult for us to get an NCAA
spot," said Coach Jim Gaughran.
"We're now tied with San Jose
State, and San Jose will certainly
be considered for a berth."
Stanford had expected the
Trojans' Bruce Koscis to lead the
Trojans and the Cards'
expectations were realized. Koscis
scored two goals in the first

quarter, while the USC defense
shut off the Cards' scoring attack.
The Cards got on the
scoreboard in the second quarter
as Drew McDonald scored. The
Trojans added two in the period
and USC went into the
lockerroom with a 4-1 halftime
lead.
Stanford outscored the Trojans
two goals to one in the second
half, but the Cards missed many
scoring opportunities when they
were a man up on the Trojans.
Alternated Goalies
The leading scorers for the
Cards were Dean Anderson, Stan
Johnson and McDonald with one
goal each. Stanford alternated

goalies in the game, with Tom
Cummin gs and Doug Tanner
sharing playing time. Cummings
had four saves and Tanner six in
the game.
"We just missed too many
shots," Gaughran said. "I think
that we're going to beat SC next
week in LA, even though SC's
pool is very difficult to play in
because of the shallow ends."
USC first year mentor John
Williams said, "We expected
Stanford to swim a lot more than
they did. Stanford sloughed more
than we expected them too. But
I'm very happy with the win. It's
always difficult for us to come up
north to play."

Williams praised the Cards'
defense, "We should have scored a
couple of more goals today, but
Stanford's defense controlled the
second half. We just didn't sustain
our offense in the second half."
Physical Team
USC is known as a very
physical team but the Trojans
appeared to have let. some of
their muscle at home. "I don't
think we played a very physical
game today," said Williams. "Our
pool is smaller than Stanford's
and the shallow ends make for a
very physical game. Stanford's
new pool is just beautiful — we
couldn't ask for a more beautiful
place to play."
The loss dropped Stanford's
Pac-8 record to 0-3. USC is now
2-1 in the conference.
San Jose State erupted for five
goals in the second quarter to
hand the Cards their second loss
of the weekend, as the Spartans
defeated the Cards, 7-6. Stanford
led the Spartans 2-1 at the end of
the first quarter as Rick Gebers
and Anderson scored a goal each.
But San Jose led 6-2 at the half.
Stanford controlled the second
half, as the Cards scored four
goals to San Jose's one. John-Paul
Roberts scored two goals in the
half, and Gebers and Anderson
added one each.
"Except for that second
quarter, we would have beaten
San Jose," said Gaughran.

USC first year mentor John
Williams said, "We expected
Stanford to swim a lot more than
they did. Stanford sloughed more
than we expected them too. But
I'm very happy with the win. It's
always difficult for us to come up
north to play."

Williams praised the Cards'
defense, "We should have scored a
couple of more goals today, but
Stanford's defense controlled the
second half. We just didn't sustain
our offense in the second half."
Physical Team
USC is known as a very
physical team but the Trojans
appeared to have let. some of
their muscle at home. "I don't
think we played a very physical
game today," said Williams. "Our
pool is smaller than Stanford's
and the shallow ends make for a
very physical game. Stanford's
new pool is just beautiful — we
couldn't ask for a more beautiful
place to play."
The loss dropped Stanford's
Pac-8 record to 0-3. USC is now
2-1 in the conference.
San Jose State erupted for five
goals in the second quarter to
hand the Cards their second loss
of the weekend, as the Spartans
defeated the Cards, 7-6. Stanford
led the Spartans 2-1 at the end of
the first quarter as Rick Gebers
and Anderson scored a goal each.
But San Jose led 6-2 at the half.
Stanford controlled the second
half, as the Cards scored four
goals to San Jose's one. John-Paul
Roberts scored two goals in the
half, and Gebers and Anderson
added one each.
"Except for that second

San Jose," said Gaughran.

LOSING DEBUT FOR NEW SWIM COMPLEX — Stanford's new $2.2 million swimming complex finally
opened this weekend, but the Cardinal water polo team wasn't able to take advantage of its new
surroundings. Stanford lost to two national powers over the weekend, dropping a 5-3 decision to USC
Friday and losing to San Jose State 7-6 on Saturday. Above, coach Jim Gaughran talks to his team during
a timeout; below, Rick Gebers and a USC player fight for possession.

Despite the opening of the new
swim stadium, the Cardinal water
polo team lost both games this
weekend. Friday the Cards lost a
Pacific Eight match to USC, 5-3,
and Saturday the poloists dropped
a 7-6 decision to San Jose State.
"These two losses make it very
difficult for us to get an NCAA
spot," said Coach Jim Gaughran.
"We're now tied with San Jose
State, and San Jose will certainly
be considered for a berth."
Stanford had expected the
Trojans' Bruce Koscis to lead the
Trojans and the Cards'
expectations were realized. Koscis
scored two goals in the first

quarter, while the USC defense
shut off the Cards' scoring attack.
The Cards got on the
scoreboard in the second quarter
as Drew McDonald scored. The
Trojans added two in the period
and USC went into the
lockerroom with a 4-1 halftime
lead.
Stanford outscored the Trojans
two goals to one in the second
half, but the Cards missed many
scoring opportunities when they
were a man up on the Trojans.
Alternated Goalies
The leading scorers for the
Cards were Dean Anderson, Stan
Johnson and McDonald with one
goal each. Stanford alternated

goalies in the game, with Tom
Cummin gs and Doug Tanner
sharing playing time. Cummings
had four saves and Tanner six in
the game.
"We just missed too many
shots," Gaughran said. "I think
that we're going to beat SC next
week in LA, even though SC's
pool is very difficult to play in
because of the shallow ends."
