# Egyptians, Israelis Warn World Renewal Of Mideast War Likely
## 
### Associated Press 
Egypt and Israel warned
simultaneously yesterday that the
Middle East war could explode anew
over the Egyptian demand that Israeli
forces pull back to the Oct. 22
cease-fire lines.
The warnings came as the Tel Aviv
military command said Israeli and
Egyptian soliders blazed away at one
another with small arms fire for about
an hour near Ismailia in the central
sector of the Suez Canal and near Bur
Taufiq at the waterway's southern
end.
The Israeli defense minister, Moshe
Dayan, said Egypt is concentrating its
forces and can "definitely" be
expected to renew fighting because of
dissatisfaction with the Oct. 24 truce
lines.
"The Egyptians are concentrating
forces, and... we have to realize the
war is not yet over," he stated.
The defense minister noted that
Premier Golda Meir's talks with U.S.
officials in Washington did not
necessarily rule out a renewal of the
fighting.
Second Army
He said a new outbreak of fighting
could involve Egypt's Second Army,
entrenched in the Sinai along the
northern canal sector, and added that
the Third Army, although encircled in
the Sinai along the southern canal
sector, should still be considered a
fighting force if the battle resumes.
Dayan said the Third Army's
attempts to bridge the canal separating
the two forces had shown that it
retains fighting ability. He said the
army also has ample munitions.
The Israeli military command said
Egyptians and Israelis exchanged fire
Sunday near Ismailia in the central
canal sector, and near Port Taufiq at
Sinai's southern entrance to the canal.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Golda
Meir of Israel headed for home
yesterday with no indication of
progress in her bid to win the release
of prisoners held by Egypt and Syria.
Briefing Israeli reporters at Blair
House on her talks with President
Nixon, Secretary of State Henry A.

Kissinger and other U.S. officials, Meir
said "some things are clearer and
others have to be clarified yet."
She declined to be specific, but
stressed that negotiations with Egypt
through the "good offices" of the
United States have not begun, even in
that indirect fashion.
Prisoner Issue
Meir said she raised the prisoner
issue during "every single
conversation." The Israeli leader said a
public report of the results would be
made after she returns home.
Kissinger was at the White House
getting ready for his own trip to the
Middle East beginning today. He goes
on from there to China and Japan.
The third major figure in the
three-sided diplomacy, Egyptian
Foreign Minister Ismail Fahmy, took
an early morning train to New York

where he planned to see U.N.
Secretary General Kurt Waldheim.
Fahmy is expected to be in Cairo
for Kissinger's scheduled arrival
tomorrow.
Knowledgeable observers who
detected no sign of headway on the
prisoners issue pointed out that any
announcement, whatever the situation,
could not be expected until midweek.
In Kuwait, oil ministers from 10
Arab states decided early today to cut
production by 25 percent as a means
of increasing pressure to secure an
Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab
lands.
The ministers, who met for seven
hours yesterday, said the 25 percent
reduction would be based on
September production figures.
"Thereafter, a five percent cut will
be imposed in December based on

November production figures," a
statement released after the meeting
said.
It added: "Such a cut shall not
affect the share of those friendly
countries that import from Arab
producing countries. This share will be
based on average imports for the first
nine months of 1973."
'Friendly Countries'
A spokesman for the Organization
of Arab Petroleum Exporting
Countries — OAPEC — would not
define the term "friendly countries,"
but presumably it means nations such
as France and Spain that have
exhibited sympathy with the Arab
position.
The United States and the
Netherlands are under an Arab oil
embargo.
