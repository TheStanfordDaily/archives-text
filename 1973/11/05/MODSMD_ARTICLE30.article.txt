# Sailing Team Places Third
## 
### 
"It was sort of like kissing your
sister; a nice idea but something
was missing." That was how one
Stanford sailor described this
weekend's regatta at San Luis
Obispo.
Stanford needed to finish first
or second to qualify for the Sugar
Bowl (a major small boat regatta
in New Orleans) and to guarantee
a top 10 national ranking. They
finished third. UC-San Diego and
San Diego State established the
superiority of the San Diego area
by sailing away from the fleet to
finish first and second.
One encouraging note was the
election of Craig Daniels as the
vice president of the California
sailing district and the election of
three Northern California
delegates to the executive council.
This election will hopefully end
Southern California's stranglehold
on West Coast Sailing.
