# Daily Destroys Lackeys
## 
### 
The Stanford Daily Thunderturkeys struck first
and often enough to defeat the Administration
Lackeys 19-12 in a touch football game Saturday
near Maples Pavilion that wasn't as close as the score
indicated.
Thunderturkey wide receiver Glenn "Flash"
Kramon, relatively little-used in the Daily's last
victory over the UCLA Daily Bruin, grabbed three
touchdown passes to pace the Thunderturkeys.
Daily coach Jim Wascher was obviously elated by
the victory. "Ugh," he commented after the game.
"Um, uh ... you know."
The Daily was without the services of its
so-called "Shotgun Twins" — Don "Cheap Shot"
Tollefson and Whispering Dave "Chip Shot"
Robinson, who were watching Stanford shoot the
Beavers in Oregon. However, a defense anchored by
Mean Dave Thiemann, Chrissy "Killer" Douglas and
Lynn "Moves" Mumby held the Lackeys — both
figuratively and, when the referee wasn't looking,
literally — from scoring until late in the contest.
Offensively, Kramon provided the speed and
hands to baffle the Lackeys. Turkey Quarterback
Hall "HTC" Daily hit him twice with scoring shots,
and Stan Wilson tossed the other TD on a halfback
option. Rookie Chris Baker caught a Daily pass for
the only successful conversion.
Meanwhile, the Lackeys struggled vainly to
untrack their offense. Quarterback Frank Newman,
hampered by advancing age and alcoholic
consumption, still managed to throw two
touchdown passes late in the game to Tom
"Shades" Bacchetti and Andy Doty. "Doty played
inspired ball," observed Lackey Coach Bob
Rosenzweig after the game, shortly before angry
teammates lynched him for coaching his second
straight losing season.
Most inspirational player of the game was Lackey
Dick Lyman, a fourth-year man from Swarthmore,
who did not play. He showed up at the game with
his arm in a sling, his leg in a bandage and hobbling
on a crutch. "Seeing him there made us want to
hi'rt somebody," said a Lackey. However, much of
the impact of Lyman's appearance was diluted when
he vaulted a fence to get to the playing field.

INJURED WARRIOR — Richard W. Lyman,
owner of the Administration Lackeys football
team and part-time president of a prestigious
West Coast university, pauses for refreshment
Saturday at the Daily vs. Lackeys touch football
game. Lyman was voted "most inspirational
player," but the Daily still won, 19-12.
