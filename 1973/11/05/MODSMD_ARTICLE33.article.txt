Brooke Asks Nixon Resignation
NEW YORK — Sen. Edward W. Brooke called upon
President Nixon to resign yesterday, saying it would be
for the good of the nation and the Republican party.
Brooke is the first Republican senator to call openly
for Nixon's resignation.
The Massachusetts Republican said he believed the
President's credibility was so damaged "it might be
impossible for him to recover" it.
Brooke said there seemed to him to be only three
possible alternatives to resolution of the current
Watergate-related crisis in the government.
The alternatives, he said on ABC television's "Issues
and Answers," are the President's impeachment, or that
he "limp along" in office, or that he resign.
In favoring resignation, Brooke said he had
"reluctantly come to that conclusion" because he felt
there was "no question President Nixon has lost his
effectiveness as a leader of this country, mainly because
he has lost the confidence of the people of this country."
Saxbe: 'Destroy Tapes 9
WASHINGTON - Sen. William B. Saxbe, whom
President Nixon has nominated as attorney general, has
been quoted as advocating in August the destruction of
Watergate tapes "if they're incriminating," the
Washington Post reported today.
The newspaper said the Ohio senator was quoted Aug.
23 by the Hong Kong Standard in a speech to the local
chapter of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong
Kong.
Saxbe was unavailable for comment. A spokesman for
the Ohio Republican said yesterday,"He doesn't
remember making any statement to that effect."
According to the newspaper:
A transcript, prepared by a Standard newsman from a
tape recording of Saxbe's remarks, quoted Saxbe: "I think
the President is right on standing on his rights not to
disclose the tapes.
"I personally wish I had never heard of the tapes and,
unless they're incriminating, I think he should give them
up. If they're incriminating, they should be destroyed and
I'm sure he will."
North Vietnamese Capture Camps
SAIGON — North Vietnamese tanks and troops seized
two government camps near the Cambodian border
yesterday after a daylong battle described by the Saigon
command as one of the most savage since the Jan. 28
cease-fire.
The Viet Cong issued a new order to its forces,
threatening a further escalation of fighting in South
Vietnam.
Government defenders withdrew from Bu Bong, three
miles from the border, "under extreme pressure from
overwhelming enemy forces," reported Lt. Col. Le Trung
Hien, a military spokesman for the Saigon command.
Radio contact was lost at dusk with Bu Prang, a mile
away across a valley, and field reports indicated it had
been overrun.
Sehlesinger Leaves For Europe
WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary James R.
Sehlesinger left for Europe last night, making it clear that
U.S. friction with the West German government over the
Middle East war has not been resolved.
Sehlesinger left Washington for the Hague, Holland, for
three days of meetings with the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization's Nuclear Planning Group.

At an airport news conference, Sehlesinger said he
would discuss with West German officials their displeasure
over the sending of U.S. military supplies from West
Germany to Israel on Israeli ships.
Criminal File Restraints Urged
WASHINGTON — Warning of dangers to personal
privacy, a federal crime commission is urging tough new
limits on the collection and distribution of criminal
history files.
Criminal justice agencies at all levels should purge their
files of obsolete, inaccurate and incomplete information
and should shield computer file centers in fortresses
beyond the reach of outside snoopers, said a new report
by the National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice
Standards and Goals.
State Voter Registration Low
SACRAMENTO — A "surprisingly low" number of
Californians are registered to vote in Tuesday's statewide
election on Prop. 1, Secretary of State Edmund G. Brown
Jr. reported yesterday.
Brown refused to predict a voter turnout. He said the
election is a first of its kind — a statewide vote on a single
proposition without either a presidential or gubernatorial
race on the ballot with it.
But Brown said the registration figures are a sign of
"substantial apathy" among California voters concerning
Gov. Ronald Reagan's tax limitation initiative.
Prisoners Fight At San Quentin
SAN QUENTIN — Three inmates were beaten and one
of them suffered a minor stab wound Saturday night in a
scuffle with a group of assailants during lockup in the
west block, San Quentin Prison officials said.
Two inmates were taken into custody, said Leo
Shepherd, officer of the day. He refused to identify them
and said the investigation was continuing.
The victims were identified as Gilbert Garcia, 28,
serving a five-year to life sentence for rape from Los
Angeles County; Henry Lopez Sianez, 30, serving five
years to life for second-degree murder from Orange
County; and Daniel Gilbert Lopez, 30, serving a life
sentence for first-degree murder from Alameda County.
All were beaten and bruised around the head and
Sianez was wounded in the upper body with a sharp
instrument, Shepherd said.
