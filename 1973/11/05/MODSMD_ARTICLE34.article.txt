# Prof Examines UFO Phenomena

### SANDY WHITE 
A close look at UFO data may
uncover "things incompatible with the
laws of physics," said Space Science
and Astrophysics Prof. Peter A.
Sturrock at an astronomy colloquium
on campus Thursday.
He cited intense public interest and
lack of hard evidence as two reasons
for scientists' reluctance to take UFOs
seriously. But science can not dismiss
the "unexplainable 5-10 percent" of
UFO reports until they are thoroughly
investigated, Sturrock said.
Only two major scientific

organizations, the American
Association for the Advancement of
Science and the American Institute of
Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA),
have considered UFOs a subject for
serious study.
But in a recent survey of the San
Francisco chapter of the AIAA,
Sturrock found that scientists
privately have "no community of
opinion" on the significance of UFOs.
No Consensus
Sturrock sent the survey to all 1175
local AIAA members. Among the 425
who responded, there was no
consensus on "the probably that UFOs
represent a scientifically significant
phenomenon." Eighteen respondents
reported observing aerial phenomena
they could not identify. Three
sightings seemed unexplainable and
could have been UFOs, Sturrock said.
Such reports violate the orthodoxy
of science, he continued. Physicists are
used to conducting experiments and
producing hard, conclusive evidence.
Scientists might be convinced, he
speculated, if a UFO landed on the
roof of the hotel where the American
Physical Society meets. Of course, he
said, the occupants of the craft would
have to come inside and explain where
they came from and how.
Lacking such conclusive proof,
asked Sturrock, is one to abandon the
investigation?
'Soft Evidence'
An astronomer must learn to find
patterns and draw hypotheses from
"soft evidence," he said. UFO
sightings cannot be controlled, he
added, so they must be studied as best
they can from witnesses reports.
One must pretend that the study of
UFOs is a "dull, normal subject," said
Sturrock. He described an unpublished
study by a French scientist who
compared 220 sightings in France with
825 from the rest of the world.
He found certain consistent
patterns: peak hours of sighting ranged
from 9-12 p.m., sightings were more
frequent in isolated or desert areas,
and the appearance of the object was
most often round or disc-like.
UFOs present some "very
disturbing" factors which are at best,
unexplainable, and at worst, "contrary
to the laws of physics," said Sturrock.
Some witnesses have reported
instantaneous changes in velocity, or
changes in direction without
deceleration, he said.
Some objects, witnesses claim, have
interfered with electrical devices, such
as car ignitions and radios. Observers
maintain that animals may sense the
presence of a UFO before a person
does.
Sturrock listed some "soft facts"

which indicate that UFOs exist:
simultaneous detection by radar and
eyewitnesses, the wide range of
movement displayed by most UFOs,
and the common description of a
metallic object with flashing lights.
Jet Followed
In one case, an Air Force jet was
followed for 700 miles by an intensely
luminous light, which appeared both
on ground radar and on on-board
tracking equipment.
Sturrock asked how many in the
audience of about 150 had ever seen
objects in the sky that they could not
identify. About 20-25 raised their
hands, but only two had ever reported
their sightings. Sturrock said that the
Air Force will accept reports of UFOs,
but that evidence more substantial
than a strange light is needed for the
report to be significant.
Scientists must begin to draw and
test hypotheses from the evidence
available, he said. He would not
venture his own opinion on the
existence of UFOs, claiming that it
was unimportant.
But, he said, he feared that his
friends might "think I've gone
bananas" after speaking on UFOs.
