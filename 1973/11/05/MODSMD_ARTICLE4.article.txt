# Library To Provide Computer Services
## 
### DON COX 
The Stanford Engineering Library
has arranged to provide a fast and low
cost computer search of technical
report literature.
In a demonstration Friday, Frances
L. Grant of Lockheed searched the
data base of over 450,000 government
reports for bibliographical abstracts
from a computer terminal in Skilling
Auditorium.
Normally, without the computer,
Grant would have had to search

through 14 shelves of printed
pamphlets for information she found
in seconds with the computer.
The computerized data base,
located at the Lockheed plant in the
Stanford Industrial Park is a
computerized form of Government
Reports Announcements and Index.
That publication includes all
unclassified reports issued since 1964
of government-sponsored research into
virtually every field of engineering and
other basic and applied sciences.
Engineering Librarian Elizabeth
Bates said that while such a system is
prohibitively expensive for most
libraries, the University's
experimentation with the system was
possible due to a special grant.
"We will determine how useful the
data base is and if it is useful enough
to people for them to pay for it.
"We've never sold information in a
library before and we must see if
anyone is willing to pay for it," Bates
observed.
One computer 9earch costs $20.
This includes computer time, printing,
and microfilm copies of the desired
documents. A search on other
comparable systems usually costs $50.
While the system will be open to all
members of the Stanford faculty and
student body, Bates predicted that it
would be used mainly by graduate
students and researchers.
"The system will be used primarily
for literary searches, searching for
prior publishment of particular
literature," she said.
Advantages of the system include a
more accurate profile of topics, fast
response time, and a more flexible
approach to the problem of locating
specific reports.
Bates saw this type of
computerized data system as an
integral part of the future library.
"It's about the way we're going
now. It will be an essential part of the
future library since the amount of
information coming into libraries is so
great, there is no other way to handle
it," she said.
The system will be operative for a
one year trial period. At that time if
the director of libraries approves, the
system will be continued.
