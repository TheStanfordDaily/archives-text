# Special County Election Tomorrow
## Voters Reconsider Sports Arena 
### GEORGE POWELL 
Santa Clara County voters will get a
second chance to approve or
disapprove a proposed entertainment
and sports arena when they go to the
polls in a special election tomorrow.
County Measure A would increase
the property tax rate in Santa Clara
County a maximum of 5V2 cents per
$100 of assessed valuation for a period
of up to 30 years. The money raised
would be used to pay costs and
expenses connected with building and
maintaining the proposed 17,500 seat
facility.
Although a ballot measure
approved by voters in November,
1972, gave the county Board of
Supervisors authority to proceed with
construction of the arena, action by
the state legislature made further
approval of financing from county
voters necessary.
Tax Rates Frozen
The legislature approved a measure
freezing local property tax rates at

current levels, leaving the supervisors
with no method to raise money for the
proposed arena except through
another special election.
Opponents of Measure A, including
a local chapter of the Sierra Club, the
United Taxpayers of Santa Clara
County and Enid Pearson, vice mayor
of Palo Alto, have raised arguments
about the cost and the environmental
impact of the proposed facility.
Those in opposition question
whether the arena can ever be a
consistent money-maker, even without
any professional sports franchises, and
whether such a structure will add to
the air pollution and traffic congestion
that already exists in the Santa Clara
County basin.
Each of the three potential sites for
the arena is close to major traffic
arteries. The potential San Jose
location is on North First Street and
Trimble Road; the second possible site
is in Santa Clara between the Bayshore
Freeway and the Mountain
View-Alviso Road; and the third is in
Milpitas near the Nimitz Freeway.
Pollution Congestion
Both sides agree that the facility
will not help solve the area's air
pollution problem, and opponents
further claim that more cars on the
highways will bring more congestion
and necessitate costly highway
improvements.
Supporters say these highway
improvements are already scheduled,
regardless of any proposed arena, and
claim that highway improvements
should not be counted as hidden costs
in Measure A.
The actual costs of construction
and related items is also a matter of
dispute. Ray Blackmore, a former San
Jose police chief who is campaign
chairman of the arena committee,
argues that studies by the county bond
counsel show an average cost to
property tax payers over a
26-year-period of only 3'/2 cents per
$100 of assessed valuation,
substantially less than the 5V2 cents the
measure authorizes.

Proponents also say the total cost
of construction, excluding land
acquisition costs and bond interest,
would be $26 million. But when these
costs are added in, opponents say,
arena costs would near $60 million.
The proposed tax hike could raise as
much as $126 million.
$250,000 Profit
The county bond consultant
thought that the arena would lose
money, but a 1972 Stanford Research
Institute (SRI) study predicted the
facility could show a $250,000 profit
the first year if the cost of debt
retirement was excluded.
The amount of money an arena
might make would depend on the
number of events scheduled and the
quality of those events. Arena
committee member Tony Ridder,
business manager of the San Jose
Mercury and News, declared that with
other entertainment facilities in the
Bay Area, a good, aggressive arena
manager would be a necessity.
Even without any professional
teams, the SRI study figured from 140
to 200 event days a year would be
necessary for the arena to be
profitable. With a knowledgeable
manager to book top entertainment, it
is not unreasonable to believe that an
arena in Santa Clara County could
make money the SRI study concluded.
Profit Unlikely
But neither is it unreasonable to
believe that the arena could have
financial trouble, since 82 percent of
arenas throughout the country lost
money in 1972, contend Pearson and
other opponents of Measure A.
In any case, over $800 million
worth of arena and stadium facilities
have been built in the past dozen
years, according to Tom Leigler, who
manages the Anaheim Arena and
Stadium complex. Even with increased
leisure time, each of these new
facilities can't be expected to make
money immediately.
These uncertain financial
circumstances have been part of the

PETITION POWER — While students on campus sign petitions to urge the
impeachment of President Nixon, discussions of the impeachment process
continue. Fired English Prof. H. Bruce Franklin, Medicine Prof. Halsted Holman
and Tom Burke of the National Lawyers Guild discuss "Is Impeachment
Enough?" at 7 p.m. tonight in Cubberley Auditorium.
barrage of charges and counter-charges
by Measure A's opponents and
proponents. The San Jose Mercury and
News has taken the lead in promoting
the arena, together with KNTV
(Channel 11) and the Santa Clara
County Arena Committee.
The arena committee, with the
cooperation of the Mercury and News,
came up with an ingenious way to
advertise Measure A and reward six
lucky people who displayed "Yes on
A" bumper stickers on their autos.
The method was so novel that it was
the subject of a suit in Santa Clara
County Superior Court by Joseph
Pickering and Fred Keeley, members
of a public information task force
opposing the arena.
The promotion offered a free trip
for two to Hawaii using what
opponents alleged was a form of
lottery.
Bumper stickers were distributed at
40 travel agencies throughout the
county; Mercury and News
photographers would then randomly
photograph six license plates with
bumper stickers.
The photographs were published in
the two papers from Oct. 29 to Nov.
3. If a person spotted his license, he
could call arena committee and claim
his prize. One of the daily winners
would be randomly selected to receive
the grand prize trip to Hawaii.
Deception
The suit against the contest alleged
that the arena committee and others
had conspired to "deceive the voters
of Santa Clara County into believing
that broad, grass-roots support exists
for said arena, when in fact, support
exists only for a free trip to Hawaii."
In denying the request for a
show-cause order that would have
stopped the contest and the awarding
of prizes, Judge John Mclnerny said
last Friday that since the contest was
practically over, the time element
involved made any ruling meaningless.
