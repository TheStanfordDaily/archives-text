On Wednesday, October 17, 1973, this sentence appeared
on this page in an opinion column by Jacques Depelchin, who
is not a Daily staff member or a regular Daily columnist.
"In order to conceal their overt and covert racism — as
exemplified in their infamous racist tract White Settlers In
Tropical Africa — L. Gann and P. Duignan persuaded the
| Hoover | Institution that naming black fellows would give
them a better image than the one they deserve. *
Lewis II. Gann and Peter J. Duignan, both Senior Fellows
at (lit- Institution, have alleged in a letter to the Daily that this
statement is untrue and libelous.
The Daily has no information to support Depelchin's state
ment. It hereby retracts the sentence quoted above and
apologizes to Messrs. Gann and Duignan.
