# Proposition One
## Tax Bill Forces Shift To Local Level 
### 
Senator Gregorio

On November Sixth voters of
California will decide in a
statewide election whether or not
to adopt Proposition 1, a
"revenue control and tax
reduction" measure, as an
amendment to our state
Constitution. The measure is
sponsored by Governor Reagan
and was written by a team of his
aides.
The core of the measure is
a limit on the amount of money
which the state could raise and
spend, including a factor that
would reduce the total of state
revenues/expenditures step by
step over a period of years to a
permanently lower percentage
than now of total personal income
in California.
In addition, the measure claims
to guarantee that the reduction it
would cause in the state budget
would not result in an increase in
local governmental spending —
that is, that there would not
simply be a tax shift from the
state to local level. The basic
practical fault I see in Proposition
1 is that I not only believe it
would allow such a shift — I also
believe it would make one nearly
inevitable.
Local Tax Increase
Those opposed to Proposition
1 assert that its mechanisms
would make it much easier for the
legislature to cause increases in
local taxes and expenditures than
to increase state taxes and
expenditures — and they are
correct.
A bill to exceed the state
revenue/expenditure ceiling in
Proposition 1 could not be
introduced — even by unanimous
vote — unless the Governor
declared a state of emergency and
requested an increase. Even then,
the increase would have to be
approved by a two-thirds vote in
each house and would continue
for only two years unless
specifically approved at the end of
that period by a vote of the
people.
By contrast, Proposition 1
directs the legislature to pass, by
simple majority vote, laws
allowing local governmental
entities to increase their property
taxes whenever there are "special
circumstances causing hardship"
for the entities — including
unexpected population growth or
increased cost of living. It also
would continue existing legislative
power to authorize, again by
simple majority, increases in local
sales, business, and other excise
taxes.
Economic Analysis
The real concern with
Proposition 1 is not what it would
permit, but instead what it would
almost surely force. In that
regard, the key fact about
Proposition 1 has been brought
out by the legislature's economic
analyst, A. Alan Post.
It is his carefully documented
conclusion that the Governor's
team made some basic
miscalculations about the state's
economy in their work-up of
Proposition 1. As a result of those
errors, the proposition's formula
for determining the state
revenue/expenditure ceiling would
produce an unrealistically low
limit. Instead of a carefully
stepped, moderate reduction in
the state budget (which would
cause legislative grumbling but
could be lived with), Proposition

1 in the very first year after its
adoption would cause a drastic
cut.
Faced with the simple fact of
not enough money (as opposed to
just less money), the legislature
would have to choose which
needed programs to cut back. If it
cut back on major programs
which are almost entirely the
responsibility of the state, such as
Medi-Cal, a lot of people
dependent on those programs
would be badly hurt, with no
where else to go.
If instead the legislature cuts

back on the two-thirds of the
state budget which goes to pay all
or part of the cost of local
programs, the provision of
Proposition 1 would allow local
entities to make up the difference.
Under those circumstances, the
most responsible thing for the
legislature to do would be to
reduce its support of local
government — and that is what I
believe it would do.
The net effect of the
Proposition, then, would be that
as state taxes — particularly the
income tax — went down, local

property and probably sales and
business taxes would go up.
Property taxes, which do not
necessarily bear any relationship
to a person's ability to pay, and
sales taxes, which only partially
relate to ability to pay, are of
course much less fair than income
taxes.
Middle class and poor persons
pay a higher percentage of their
incomes in property and sales
taxes than do most wealthy
persons. Proposition l's real
result, accordingly, would be a
major tax shift from high income
persons to middle and lower
income persons. Instead of
controlling taxes, Proposition 1
would only make them less fair.
For that reason, I recommend a
"no" vote.
