# Political Trial
## Popeye Needs Aid 
### 
Chris Reif

The Chino Defense Committee
was formed last year when nine
people from this area were
arrested and charged with helping
free a prisoner who was being
transported to court from Chino
State Prison. The first of the
Chino Trials resulted in second
degree murder convictions for
Doug and Andrea Burt with a five
to life indeterminate sentence.
The verdict was won with almost
no evidence, with courtroom
tactics designed to intimidate the
jury, and with harrassment of the
defense witnesses and lawyers.
Political trials such as the
Chino Trials are becoming more
common. The government is
finding it necessary to mobilize its
legal machinery to execute attacks
on political groups, especially
those related to the prison
movement. These legal attacks
have several functions — to
imprison the leaders, to drain
away valuable time and money,
and to intimidate others working
in radical politics.
Today in Superior Court in San
Francisco, another political trial is
beginning around the case of
Popeye Jackson. The
circumstances of his case fit quite
well the pattern of political
repression by the police and
courts.
1. Popeye is black, a
revolutionary, and active in
several community groups
(Addition Project Alliance
Committee, Mission Coalition, the
Youth Director for Seven Steps,
drug counselor with Reality West,
the Drug Research Project).
Prisoner's Union Chairman
2. It is probably Popeye's role
as chairman of the UPU (United
Prisoner's Union) that has brought
on the current attack and charges.
The UPU is a multi-racial group
made up of prisoners,
ex-prisoners, friends, relatives, and
supporters of the prison
movement. Its goals are an end to
the indeterminate sentence,
complete medical and legal aide,
minimum wages for prison work,
descent living conditions, etc.
3. Popeye, who is 44 years old
and who has never before been
charged with a drug violation, is
charged with the sale and
possession of heroin. Those of us
who knew Popeye and his ideas
about drugs, realize the absurdity
of the charges. Smack keeps
people down — Popeye is a
revolutionary and struggling to
help people up.
The story that the police are

telling is as absurd as the charges:
A woman arrested for prostitution
"volunteered" the tip to the
arresting officers that Popeye sold
her heroin. Without reporting this '
"tip" to the Narc Squad and
without obtaining a warrant, the
next day these officers stopped
Popeye on the street.
Automobile Search
Without bothering to search his
person, they went straight to the
trunk of his car where they
"found" the stuff they were
looking for.
The police say that Popeye
"consented" to this search.
However, the actions of the
police are easier to understand
than their story. They ...
1. Had followed and harassed
Popeye and his wife Susan for
weeks prior to the arrest.
2. Tapped the UPU phone and
bugged the office.
3. Monitored Popeye's
conversations in the jail visiting
room.
4. Hired an informer to steal
the UPU mailing list.
5. Hired [someone] to
infiltrate the UPU, steal Popeye's
• address book, and to take his car
into the police station to be taken
care of.
6. Later, pressured [her] to
change her story against Popeye.
The court's role in the case has
been to: refuse Popeye bail
(release from a parole hold),
refuse the defense team access to
the evidence or to even hear
arguments concerning
evidence-access, refuse to dismiss
charges because of illegal police
activities.
Prison Movement Attacked
Although the charges and the
police story are quite absurd, the
result is serious and just what they
planned ... to bust Popeye and
attack the prison movement.
From the prosecution of the
Chino Trials to the recent hearings
before House Internal Security
Committee to Popeye's case, it is
clear that the government views
the legal movement for prisoners'
rights as a "subversive" target of
top priority.
Subversive because it doesn't
accept the established definition
of crime which keeps George
Jackson in prison to be murdered
for stealing $70 while Spiro
Agnew steals thousands of dollars
and gets a suspended sentence;
subversive because it sees "crime"
in America to be the result of a
racist, exploitative political and
economic system; subversive
because it sees prisoners to be full
human beings entitled to full
human rights and dignity.
We on the Chino Defense
Committee feel it is important to
see political trials for what they
are, give support and aid to the
people involved, and to spread the
word. If you would like to help
support Popeye, come to his trial
at the San Francisco Hall of
Justice, give money to his defense
fund, and tell your friends about
his trial. For further information
call 285-3100.
