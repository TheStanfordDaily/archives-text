Either way you'll
get the shaft.
The BSR 810 and 710 have their brains in
their shaft. A carefully machined metal rod
holding eight precision-molded cams. When
the cam shaft turns, the cams make things
happen. A lock is released, an arm raises and
swings, a record drops, a platter starts spinning,
the arm is lowered, the arm stops, the arm raises
again, it swings back, another record is dropped
onto the platter, the arm is lowered again,
-j and so on, for as many hours as you like.
11 Deluxe turntables from other companies do
?much the same thing, but they use many
more parts—scads of separate swinging arms,
gears, plates, and springs—in an arrange
ment that is not nearly as mechanically
elegant, or as quiet or reliable; that produces
considerably more vibration, and is much
more susceptible to mechanical shock than
the BSR sequential cam shaft system.
