# Jaworski Approved 'Laundering'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Special
Watergate prosecutor Leon Jaworski
once approved the use of a Houston
foundation to launder money at the
request of the CIA, the foundation
president said yesterday.
Jaworski, who was sworn in
yesterday, issued a terse denial
through his office, but acknowledged
to a Houston newspaper that he may
have played a part in the conduit
arrangement.
Among the matters under the
jurisdiction of Jaworski's special
prosecution force is the still-lingering
question of the CIA role in the
Watergate wiretapping and the
subsequent cover-up.
John Freeman, president of the
M.D. Anderson Foundation of
Houston said in a telephone interview
that the group had channeled more
than $600,000 to an international
lawyers' group in the late 1950s and
early 1960s after being requested to
do so by a CIA representative.
The conduit arrangement ended
after it was exposed, along with CIA
subsidies to the National Students
Association and other supposedly
independent groups, in 1967.
Freeman, a former law partner of
Jaworski, said he, Jaworski and the
other two foundation directors
unanimously approved the CIA
request, and that Jaworski was aware
of details of the arrangement over the
years.
"I'm quite sure that he did know as
it went along," Freeman said.
Jaworski declined to answer a list
of written questions about the matter
submitted by The Associated Press.
Instead, his office issued a
one-sentence denial. "To his
knowledge he has never acted directly
or indirectly as a conduit for Central
Intelligence Agency funds for any
purpose," said a spokesman.
The spokesman added that
Jaworski does not intend to resign
from the board of directors of the
foundation, a main supporter of the
Texas Medical Center, renowned for
cancer and heart research.
However, the Houston Chronicle
quoted Jaworski differently, saying that
he acknowledged he "possibly helped
channel Central Intelligence Agency
funds" to the lawyer's group then
called the American Fund for Free
Jurists.
