# Nixon's Goals Fade
## "President" Cripples Nation 
### 
Andrew Leuchter

While a grade school student in Whittier,
California, Richard Nixon dreamed of being a world
traveller. This desire to travel shaped the youngster's
early career ambitions: until his twelfth birthday,
young Richard was committed to a career on the
raMroad. Were it not for his father's inspiration,
Richard Nixon would be working for Southern
Pacific today.
Frank Nixon became increasingly livid over each
new revelation in the Teapot Dome scandal; it was
his father's diatribes against "crooked politicians"
which caused the twelve-year-old Richard to
abandon his dream of railroading and proclaim, "I
will be an old-fashioned kind of lawyer, a lawyer
who can't be bought."
Mr. Nixon has never lost his desire to travel: in
one year he flies more than Lyndon Johnson did in
one term. But he has apparently lost the idealistic
fervor with which he first entered politics. Most
Americans now believe that the man they first
elected as a law-and-order candidate is a criminal.
Armed with the doctrine of executive privilege,
President Nixon is apparently obstructing justice â€”
he appears to be hiding behind the Presidency.
Effect of Political Life
Public opinion is correct in one respect: political
life has had a profound effect on Mr. Nixon. Politics
has forced him to make a great personal realization:
nobody likes him. The unattractivpness of the
Nixon personality gained nation-wide attention in
his 1960 campaign; the early lead of the harried,
fumbling Vice-President soon melted under the
charismatic dynamism of John Kennedy.
Personality again became an issue late in the
1968 campaign when Mr. Nixon began to "speak his
mind" against the advice of his ad men; a
comfortable lead once again narrowed as Mr.
Nixon's popularity dropped. Although President
Nixon was most recently elected by the largest
plurality in history, his success had nothing to do
with his personality; the public voted against the
radical tone of his opponent.
Mr. Nixon realizes that even those who voted for
him do not like him personally; he has responded to
this political insecurity by immersing his personality
in an all-consuming role for public presentation.
During his Congressional campaigns, he was Richard
Nixon, the rabid anti-Communist.
Obedient Servant
In the fifties, this virulent nationalism submerged
into a greater role: Richard Nixon, the obedient

servant of President Eisenhower. It was at least in
part the inability to emerge from the role of "Ike's
boy" which cost him his first bid for the Presidency.
But in 1968, Mr. Nixon emerged reconstituted and
repackaged as the statesman "bringing America
together."
Mr. Nixon's performance in these roles is always
most professional movie mogul Darryl Zanuck is
purported to have told the Vice-President that his
Checkers speech was "The most tremendous
performance I've ever seen." Such high caliber
dramatics are more than show, however; they are
the fusion of Richard Nixon and roles in which he
firmly believes.
Exemplary of this fusion is his present immersion
in the Presidency. He was elected to this term not as
Candidate Nixon, but as "The President"; he stays
in office not as President Nixon, but as "The
President."
Complete Fusion
So complete is the fusion between the man and
the office that "The President" and"I" are now
interchangeable in Richard Nixon's vocabularly. In
his recent press conference, Mr. Nixon claimed that
"While many thought the President shell-shocked
and unable to act," nothing "affected me in doing
my job."
The inseparable mixture of Mr. Nixon's
personality and office does not mean he is hiding
behind the Presidency; he is being absorbed into it.
His earnest support of the national good is manifest
in his struggle to establish Presidential prerogatives.
His zealous defense of executive privilege has now
replaced the personal defensiveness which was
apparent at the "last press conference" in 1962; any
attack on Richard Nixon is now inseparable from an
assault on the White House.
In seeking a role in which to cast himself before
the public, Mr. Nixon has turned to total immersion
in the Presidency. As with his previous roles,
however, this involvement has gone all too far.
Richard Nixon has so deeply involved himself with
the Presidency as to lose perspective of his goals.
Much as the anti-Communist Nixon pursued Alger
Hiss beyond all reason, President Nixon is
advocating an executive privilege beyond all law. It
is through this loss of perspective, not malicious
intent, that President Nixon is crippling the nation.
