Coalition Co-optation
Editor:
While sharing Larry Diamond's
desire to impeach Richard Nixon
(Daily, Oct. 30-31) and his desire
to revive the impeachment
weapon per se as device for
combatting executive
aggrandizment of power, I must
disagree strongly with the primary
way Diamond wants to organize
the impeachment effort.
Diamond endorses as the
primary strategy for impeachment
the wielding together of a
corporate liberal coalition of
formal organizations: the
AFL-CIO, the ADA, the Urban
Coalition, the National Council of
Churches, the National
Conference of Mayors, the
National League of Cities,
Common Cause, and the National
Committee for an Effective
Congress.
Diamond's approach is
precisely that advocated by social
democrats like Bayard Rustin in
the mid-19605. The New Left of
the 1960s developed its strategies
of mass mobilization and
participatory democracy as a
direct rejection of co-optation
into the national coalition politics
of interest-group liberalism.
I believe that real change will
never come if we make our
primary effort integrating
ourselves into the work of the
corporate liberal groups like
Common Cause and the AFL-CIO.
Instead, the primary effort for
change must come from mass,
organized pressure from below. It
can never come from those who
are accustomed to co-operating
with the system at the top.

I would like to respond
belatedly to the controversy over
admissions preference for
engineering majors. I feel I have a
rather unique point of view since I
am a junior, female,
double-majoring in electrical
engineering and music.
First, I have no objection
whatever to an admissions policy
that favors one potential major
over another. True, entering
freshmen often change their
majors; but I think it worthwhile
to try to balance the number of
students in each department with
the available facilities. Think of
situations — Psych 1, art — where
this balance does not exist, and
the quality or availability of a
course decreases as a result.
Then, consider that most
engineering classes are given once
or twice a year, one section per
quarter, with less than 50 people
per class. It seems that engineering
has about the right number of
majors, and everything else is

overcrowded. If potential
engineering majors were not
favored, other departments would
get even more crowded!
Second, I fail to see how
women are discriminated against
when hopeful engineers are
favored in admissions. The blame
is being put on the wrong thing!
Why don't more women go into
engineering? We are needed,
wanted, actively recruited by the
engineering department, which is
perhaps more encouraging
towards women than any
other largely male department.
I realize that engineering is one
of the more difficult majors, and
that some students get turned off
early — by a bad math class, by a
comment such as "But why
engineering for a girl?", or by the
incredible loneliness facing a
woman in a 99%-male field. It
isn't easy to do something new,
and perhaps that's why more
engineering hopefuls have to be
admitted to keep things even. But
I cannot see how equality will be
promoted by overcrowding
humanities classes and emptying
engineering classes.
If fewer engineering majors
were admitted there would be
fewer women engineering majors
— maybe none? We need women
in engineering now so that we will
have some later. The way to
achieve an equal undergrad ratio is
not to switch preferences to
largely female majors (e.g. music)
but to change society and campus
attitudes so that women and men
are more evenly distributed in all
majors.
One last thing occurs to me:
has anyone inquired whether
women applicants who put down
engineering are favored over men
who put it down? I'd be
interested in finding out — we
may have some letters objecting
to positive discrimination.

As President Nixon appears to
be strongly enamored of
precedent, I think that in these
times of talk of impeachment he
should consider the words of the
critic and troubadour Paul Simon,
who has written:
"And if I was president,
The minute the Congress called
my name,
I'd say who, now, who do you
think you're fooling?
I've got the presidential seal.
I've got the presidential
podium.
My momma loves me,
She loves me.
She gets on her knees and hugs
me,
She loves me like a rock."
Whatever the Constitutional

consequences of Mrs. Nixon's love
for her son, I fear that we have a
Ford in our future.

Editorial Vs. Advertisement
Editor:
In. its editorial on Thursday,
October 25, the Daily took a
forthright stand on the UFW
struggle: "The Daily supports the
efforts of the UFW and the
Farmworkers Organizing
Committee. We urge you to
boycott lettuce and table grapes
unless you see the union label. We
urge you to boycott Safeway
stores. We urge you to boycott
nonunion wines and brandies:
Gallo ..."
The Daily demonstrated the
integrity of its political position
by running on the back page of
the same issue a 27 column-inch
Gallo ad. The same ad will be
running twice a week for the rest
of the school year.
The editorial board, in a
paragraph entitled
"Advertisement Policy" on the
editorial page, perceptively noted
the "apparent contradiction"
between urging a boycott of Gallo
and helping Gallo sell its products.
This contradiction is illusory, says
the board, because accepting
Gallo ads is consistent with its
policy of not refusing ads for

political reasons.
Such a rationale, however,
cannot allow the Daily to divorce
itself from the policy's effect.
Despite its protestations, the
Daily's actions are in substance a
political act. The Daily is being
hired by Gallo to be part of its
marketing apparatus; for a piece,
the Daily is an agent of Gallo. By
running thousands of dollars
worth of Gallo ads, the Daily is
participating in Gallo's attempt to
crush the farmworker's struggle,
and no avowal of neutrality can
obscure this fact.
The business office, when
contacted, maintained that the
decision to accept ads for scab
products was made by the
editorial board, but noted that the
Daily, being independent, must
depend on advertisements for its
survival. The Daily, while
dependent on Gallo, is in fact now
independent of student support.
Daily fee assessments ended this
quarter. It is now clear that Daily
independence amounts to a
change of sources of revenue.
Gallo now pays the piper, and the
price is 27 column-inches.

who has written:
"And if I was president,
The minute the Congress called

I'd say who, now, who do you

I've got the presidential seal.
I've got the presidential

In. its editorial on Thursday,
October 25, the Daily took a
forthright stand on the UFW
struggle: "The Daily supports the
efforts of the UFW and the
Farmworkers Organizing
Committee. We urge you to
boycott lettuce and table grapes
unless you see the union label. We
urge you to boycott Safeway
stores. We urge you to boycott
nonunion wines and brandies:
Gallo ..."
The Daily demonstrated the
integrity of its political position
by running on the back page of
the same issue a 27 column-inch
Gallo ad. The same ad will be
running twice a week for the rest
of the school year.
The editorial board, in a
paragraph entitled
"Advertisement Policy" on the
editorial page, perceptively noted
the "apparent contradiction"
between urging a boycott of Gallo
and helping Gallo sell its products.
This contradiction is illusory, says
the board, because accepting
Gallo ads is consistent with its
policy of not refusing ads for

political reasons.
Such a rationale, however,
cannot allow the Daily to divorce
itself from the policy's effect.
Despite its protestations, the
Daily's actions are in substance a
political act. The Daily is being
hired by Gallo to be part of its
marketing apparatus; for a piece,
the Daily is an agent of Gallo. By
running thousands of dollars
worth of Gallo ads, the Daily is
participating in Gallo's attempt to
crush the farmworker's struggle,
and no avowal of neutrality can
obscure this fact.
The business office, when
contacted, maintained that the
decision to accept ads for scab
products was made by the
editorial board, but noted that the
Daily, being independent, must
depend on advertisements for its
survival. The Daily, while
dependent on Gallo, is in fact now
independent of student support.
Daily fee assessments ended this
quarter. It is now clear that Daily
independence amounts to a
change of sources of revenue.
Gallo now pays the piper, and the
price is 27 column-inches.

While sharing Larry Diamond's
desire to impeach Richard Nixon
(Daily, Oct. 30-31) and his desire
to revive the impeachment
weapon per se as device for
combatting executive
aggrandizment of power, I must
disagree strongly with the primary
way Diamond wants to organize
the impeachment effort.
Diamond endorses as the
primary strategy for impeachment
the wielding together of a
corporate liberal coalition of
formal organizations: the
AFL-CIO, the ADA, the Urban
Coalition, the National Council of
Churches, the National
Conference of Mayors, the
National League of Cities,
Common Cause, and the National
Committee for an Effective
Congress.
Diamond's approach is
precisely that advocated by social
democrats like Bayard Rustin in
the mid-19605. The New Left of
the 1960s developed its strategies
of mass mobilization and
participatory democracy as a
direct rejection of co-optation
into the national coalition politics
of interest-group liberalism.
I believe that real change will
never come if we make our
primary effort integrating
ourselves into the work of the
corporate liberal groups like
Common Cause and the AFL-CIO.
Instead, the primary effort for
change must come from mass,
organized pressure from below. It
can never come from those who
are accustomed to co-operating
with the system at the top.

I would like to respond
belatedly to the controversy over
admissions preference for
engineering majors. I feel I have a
rather unique point of view since I
am a junior, female,
double-majoring in electrical
engineering and music.
First, I have no objection
whatever to an admissions policy
that favors one potential major
over another. True, entering
freshmen often change their
majors; but I think it worthwhile
to try to balance the number of
students in each department with
the available facilities. Think of
situations — Psych 1, art — where
this balance does not exist, and
the quality or availability of a
course decreases as a result.
Then, consider that most
engineering classes are given once
or twice a year, one section per
quarter, with less than 50 people
per class. It seems that engineering
has about the right number of
majors, and everything else is

overcrowded. If potential
engineering majors were not
favored, other departments would
get even more crowded!
Second, I fail to see how
women are discriminated against
when hopeful engineers are
favored in admissions. The blame
is being put on the wrong thing!
Why don't more women go into
engineering? We are needed,
wanted, actively recruited by the
engineering department, which is
perhaps more encouraging
towards women than any
other largely male department.
I realize that engineering is one
of the more difficult majors, and
that some students get turned off
early — by a bad math class, by a
comment such as "But why
engineering for a girl?", or by the
incredible loneliness facing a
woman in a 99%-male field. It
isn't easy to do something new,
and perhaps that's why more
engineering hopefuls have to be
admitted to keep things even. But
I cannot see how equality will be
promoted by overcrowding
humanities classes and emptying
engineering classes.
If fewer engineering majors
were admitted there would be
fewer women engineering majors
— maybe none? We need women
in engineering now so that we will
have some later. The way to
achieve an equal undergrad ratio is
not to switch preferences to
largely female majors (e.g. music)
but to change society and campus
attitudes so that women and men
are more evenly distributed in all
majors.
One last thing occurs to me:
has anyone inquired whether
women applicants who put down

Diamond endorses as the
primary strategy for impeachment
the wielding together of a
corporate liberal coalition of
formal organizations: the
AFL-CIO, the ADA, the Urban
Coalition, the National Council of
Churches, the National
Conference of Mayors, the
National League of Cities,
Common Cause, and the National
Committee for an Effective
Congress.
Diamond's approach is
precisely that advocated by social
democrats like Bayard Rustin in
the mid-19605. The New Left of
the 1960s developed its strategies
of mass mobilization and
participatory democracy as a
direct rejection of co-optation
into the national coalition politics
of interest-group liberalism.
I believe that real change will
never come if we make our
primary effort integrating
ourselves into the work of the
corporate liberal groups like
Common Cause and the AFL-CIO.
Instead, the primary effort for
change must come from mass,
organized pressure from below. It
can never come from those who
are accustomed to co-operating
with the system at the top.

I would like to respond
belatedly to the controversy over
admissions preference for
engineering majors. I feel I have a
rather unique point of view since I
am a junior, female,
double-majoring in electrical
engineering and music.
First, I have no objection
whatever to an admissions policy
that favors one potential major
over another. True, entering
freshmen often change their
majors; but I think it worthwhile
to try to balance the number of
students in each department with
the available facilities. Think of
situations — Psych 1, art — where
this balance does not exist, and
the quality or availability of a
course decreases as a result.
Then, consider that most
engineering classes are given once
or twice a year, one section per
quarter, with less than 50 people
per class. It seems that engineering
has about the right number of
majors, and everything else is

overcrowded. If potential
engineering majors were not
favored, other departments would
get even more crowded!
Second, I fail to see how
women are discriminated against
when hopeful engineers are
favored in admissions. The blame
is being put on the wrong thing!
Why don't more women go into
engineering? We are needed,
wanted, actively recruited by the
engineering department, which is
perhaps more encouraging
towards women than any
other largely male department.
I realize that engineering is one
of the more difficult majors, and
that some students get turned off
early — by a bad math class, by a
comment such as "But why
engineering for a girl?", or by the
incredible loneliness facing a
woman in a 99%-male field. It
isn't easy to do something new,
and perhaps that's why more
engineering hopefuls have to be
admitted to keep things even. But
I cannot see how equality will be
promoted by overcrowding
humanities classes and emptying
engineering classes.
If fewer engineering majors
were admitted there would be
fewer women engineering majors
— maybe none? We need women
in engineering now so that we will
have some later. The way to
achieve an equal undergrad ratio is
not to switch preferences to
largely female majors (e.g. music)
but to change society and campus
attitudes so that women and men
are more evenly distributed in all
majors.
One last thing occurs to me:
has anyone inquired whether
women applicants who put down
engineering are favored over men
who put it down? I'd be
interested in finding out — we
may have some letters objecting
to positive discrimination.

As President Nixon appears to
be strongly enamored of
precedent, I think that in these
times of talk of impeachment he
should consider the words of the
critic and troubadour Paul Simon,
who has written:
"And if I was president,
The minute the Congress called
my name,
I'd say who, now, who do you
think you're fooling?
I've got the presidential seal.
I've got the presidential

My momma loves me,
She loves me.
She gets on her knees and hugs

Editorial Vs. Advertisement
Editor:
In. its editorial on Thursday,
October 25, the Daily took a
forthright stand on the UFW
struggle: "The Daily supports the
efforts of the UFW and the
Farmworkers Organizing
Committee. We urge you to
boycott lettuce and table grapes
unless you see the union label. We
urge you to boycott Safeway
stores. We urge you to boycott
nonunion wines and brandies:
Gallo ..."
The Daily demonstrated the
integrity of its political position
by running on the back page of
the same issue a 27 column-inch
Gallo ad. The same ad will be
running twice a week for the rest
of the school year.
The editorial board, in a
paragraph entitled
"Advertisement Policy" on the
editorial page, perceptively noted
the "apparent contradiction"
between urging a boycott of Gallo
and helping Gallo sell its products.
This contradiction is illusory, says
the board, because accepting
Gallo ads is consistent with its
policy of not refusing ads for

political reasons.
Such a rationale, however,
cannot allow the Daily to divorce
itself from the policy's effect.
Despite its protestations, the
Daily's actions are in substance a
political act. The Daily is being
hired by Gallo to be part of its
marketing apparatus; for a piece,
the Daily is an agent of Gallo. By
running thousands of dollars
worth of Gallo ads, the Daily is
participating in Gallo's attempt to
crush the farmworker's struggle,
and no avowal of neutrality can
obscure this fact.
The business office, when
contacted, maintained that the
decision to accept ads for scab
products was made by the
editorial board, but noted that the
Daily, being independent, must
depend on advertisements for its
survival. The Daily, while
dependent on Gallo, is in fact now
independent of student support.
Daily fee assessments ended this
quarter. It is now clear that Daily
independence amounts to a
change of sources of revenue.
Gallo now pays the piper, and the
price is 27 column-inches.

Editor:
As President Nixon appears to
be strongly enamored of
precedent, I think that in these
times of talk of impeachment he
should consider the words of the
critic and troubadour Paul Simon,
who has written:
"And if I was president,
The minute the Congress called
my name,
I'd say who, now, who do you
think you're fooling?
I've got the presidential seal.
I've got the presidential
podium.
My momma loves me,
She loves me.
She gets on her knees and hugs
me,
She loves me like a rock."
Whatever the Constitutional

consequences of Mrs. Nixon's love
for her son, I fear that we have a
Ford in our future.

Editorial Vs. Advertisement
Editor:
In. its editorial on Thursday,
October 25, the Daily took a
forthright stand on the UFW
struggle: "The Daily supports the
efforts of the UFW and the
Farmworkers Organizing
Committee. We urge you to
boycott lettuce and table grapes
unless you see the union label. We
urge you to boycott Safeway
stores. We urge you to boycott
nonunion wines and brandies:
Gallo ..."
The Daily demonstrated the
integrity of its political position
by running on the back page of
the same issue a 27 column-inch
Gallo ad. The same ad will be
running twice a week for the rest
of the school year.
The editorial board, in a
paragraph entitled
"Advertisement Policy" on the
editorial page, perceptively noted
the "apparent contradiction"
between urging a boycott of Gallo
and helping Gallo sell its products.
This contradiction is illusory, says
the board, because accepting
Gallo ads is consistent with its
policy of not refusing ads for

political reasons.
Such a rationale, however,
cannot allow the Daily to divorce
itself from the policy's effect.
Despite its protestations, the
Daily's actions are in substance a
political act. The Daily is being
hired by Gallo to be part of its
marketing apparatus; for a piece,
the Daily is an agent of Gallo. By
running thousands of dollars
worth of Gallo ads, the Daily is
participating in Gallo's attempt to
crush the farmworker's struggle,
and no avowal of neutrality can
obscure this fact.
The business office, when
contacted, maintained that the
decision to accept ads for scab
products was made by the
editorial board, but noted that the
Daily, being independent, must
depend on advertisements for its
survival. The Daily, while
dependent on Gallo, is in fact now
independent of student support.
Daily fee assessments ended this
quarter. It is now clear that Daily
independence amounts to a
change of sources of revenue.
Gallo now pays the piper, and the
price is 27 column-inches.
Support the farmworkers'
struggle — direct your complaints
to the Daily. John Haptas
