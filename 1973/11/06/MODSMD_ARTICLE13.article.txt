# 'Crusade' May Delay Cure
## Prof Pans Cancer Plan 
### 
The effect of President Nixon's
plan to cure cancer may be to
slow down rather than speed up
progress toward solution of the
problems, a genetics professor
here said.
In 1970, Congress unanimously
passed a resolution calling for a
"national crusade" for the
conquest of cancer by 1976, "as
an appropriate commemorative of
the 200 th anniversary of our
country."
Such a programmed approach
to cancer research is both
dangerous and shortsighted, says
Leonard A. Herzenberg, genetics
professor of the school of

medicine, writing in the current
issue of Stanford M.D., magazine
of the Medical Alumni
Association.
Herzenberg contends that there
is much basic research to be done'
in many areas of biology before it
is likely that we will be able to
understand, prevent, and control
most malignancies.
President Nixon's National
Cancer Program promises to do
the job by applying systems
engineering management
techniques, said Herzenberg. This
plan favors directed research in
areas chosen by officials of the
National Cancer Institute,

capturing funds used previously to
support traditional biomedical
research.
The systems engineering
approach, like that used to
construct the atomic bomb and to
send man to the moon, "required
virtually no acquisition of new
fundamental scientific knowledge;
rather they demanded the
practical extension and
application of existing knowledge.
Unfortunately, no such firm
scientific base for the
development of a centrally
directed cancer program currently
exists," Herzenberg said.
By granting large contracts for
specific jobs, the program
encourages groups of scientists
who will direct large numbers of
technicians doing rather
routinized, prescribed kind of
work, said Herzenberg. Graduate
students and research fellows will
not be drawn into this type of
research, and will not be "alert to
the aberrant result of chance
observation that may yield a
minor or major new clue to
understanding cancer, or some
other human disease."
Herzenberg concluded that the
"centralized control of cancer
research is in complete accord
with the whole Nixon approach of
attempting to control the entire
country from the White House.
"A sweeping reversal of this
whole trend" may be required to
solve the cancer problem, he said.
