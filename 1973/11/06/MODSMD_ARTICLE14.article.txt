# BART Opens New S.F.-Daly City Run
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Bay
Area Rapid Transit system trains
opened their doors Monday to
carry commuters 7.5 miles
between downtown San Francisco
and suburban Daly City.
Seven underground stations in
San Francisco and an elevated one
at the south end of the line serve
the newest segment of the system,
along which sleek aluminum cars
whiz at speeds up to 80 miles per
hour.
Service began a year ago in
Oakland and east San Francisco
Bay cities, but a tube under the
Bay connecting the lines still is
closed because of safety problems.
"I've been waiting for this for
quite a while," said Ed Reid, a gas
company engineer who boarded
the train in Daly City.
In 13 minutes and for 35 cents
he sped north into San Francisco,
through the Mission District and
under downtown Market Street
into the heart of the financial
district at the other end of the
line.
"It took me that long to get to
the bus depot from where I
work," Reid said. "They've got
top equipment. It's a nice ride."
Fifty-four early birds boarded
the first train out of Daly City
just before 6 a.m., but an hour
later platforms were bustling and
some of the 72-seat cars were
standing room only.
"I figured it's worth a try
because the bus takes so long,"
said Sylvia O'Rourke, a telephone
company accountant. "But I
started out early today just in case
something goes wrong."
Nothing did, on O'Rourke's
train, but the system didn't
completely escape the flaws that
have plagued service in the East
Bay.
There, trains sometimes stall
between stations; doors have
flown open while the trains
moved at high speeds, and one
train failed to stop at the end of
the line and plowed off the tracks,
injuring several people.
The worst that happened
yesterday was that one car went
dead and the entire train had to
be shunted off the tracks.
Platform destination signs
erroneously flashed the East Bay
city of "Richmond," an ironic
reminder that the transbay tube
linking San Francisco with

Oakland — a crucial factor in
BART's revenue goal — remains
shut.
That four-mile link can't open
until BART engineers improve on
their $37 million automatic
control system so trains can feed
into the tunnel from three East
Bay lines without risk of collision.
"The baby is not completely
born," was how Mayor Joseph L.
Alioto described the situation
during dedication festivities
Saturday, when 60,000 sight-seers
took advantage of free rides.

and suburban Daly City.
Seven underground stations in
San Francisco and an elevated one
at the south end of the line serve
the newest segment of the system,
along which sleek aluminum cars
whiz at speeds up to 80 miles per
hour.
Service began a year ago in
Oakland and east San Francisco
Bay cities, but a tube under the
Bay connecting the lines still is
closed because of safety problems.
"I've been waiting for this for
quite a while," said Ed Reid, a gas
company engineer who boarded
the train in Daly City.
In 13 minutes and for 35 cents
he sped north into San Francisco,
through the Mission District and
under downtown Market Street
into the heart of the financial
district at the other end of the
line.
"It took me that long to get to
the bus depot from where I
work," Reid said. "They've got
top equipment. It's a nice ride."
Fifty-four early birds boarded
the first train out of Daly City
just before 6 a.m., but an hour
later platforms were bustling and
some of the 72-seat cars were
standing room only.
"I figured it's worth a try
because the bus takes so long,"
said Sylvia O'Rourke, a telephone
company accountant. "But I
started out early today just in case
something goes wrong."
Nothing did, on O'Rourke's
train, but the system didn't
completely escape the flaws that
have plagued service in the East
Bay.
There, trains sometimes stall
between stations; doors have
flown open while the trains
moved at high speeds, and one
train failed to stop at the end of
the line and plowed off the tracks,
injuring several people.
The worst that happened
yesterday was that one car went
dead and the entire train had to
be shunted off the tracks.
Platform destination signs
erroneously flashed the East Bay
city of "Richmond," an ironic
reminder that the transbay tube
linking San Francisco with

Oakland — a crucial factor in
BART's revenue goal — remains
shut.
That four-mile link can't open
until BART engineers improve on
their $37 million automatic
control system so trains can feed
into the tunnel from three East
Bay lines without risk of collision.
"The baby is not completely
born," was how Mayor Joseph L.
Alioto described the situation
during dedication festivities
Saturday, when 60,000 sight-seers
took advantage of free rides.
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Bay
