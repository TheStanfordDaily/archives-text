# Reduced Speed Limit To Cut Motorists' Fuel Consumption

SACRAMENTO (AP) -
California is reducing its
maximum speed limit from 70 to
65 miles per hour to cut fuel
consumption, Lt. Gov. Ed
Reinecke announced yesterday.
That will affect 33 sections of
highway totaling 1450 miles that
comprise about 70 percent of the
state's freeway system in rural
areas, Reinecke said.
Starting Dec. 1 Department of
Transportation workmen will
begin changing the speed limit
signs in a move to "cut, squeeze
and trim" the state's energy
consumption, Reinecke told a
luncheon audience.
"This will save hundreds of
thousands of barrels of oil a
year," Reinecke told the
Comstock Club, an organization
of Sacramento business and
professional leaders.
He gave no indication of how
long the policy would remain in
effect.
The Republican official, who is
a declared candidate in the 1974
governor's race, also said the state
is going to look into the
possibility of changing back to
Daylight Savings Time, which
traditionally begins in the spring
and ends in the fall.
Reinecke, who is chairman of
the state's Energy Planning
Council, said energy experts have
told him that could mean perhaps

a two percent savings in the state's
annual energy use.
He said the move to Daylight
Savings Time for the winter
probably would require some
statute changes. But he said such
moves "multipled over a state
population of 20 million will
make a very real difference."
Offshore oil drilling is also
something California will have to
face again once environmental
safeguards are assured, Reinecke
said. Currently there is a ban on
oil drilling in state waters.
In an interview after his
speech, Reinecks said state law
already makes 65 the maximum
speed limit. But the law also
allows the Department of
Transportation to move the limit
up to 70 in areas where conditions
make the higher limit safe.
In his remarks, Reinecks also
attacked the federal government's
new fuel allocation system
affecting the state's
mutli-billion-dollar argiculture

industry as "an arbitrary,
heavy-handed approach."
The program was put into
effect last Wednesday. Then
Friday the federal government
agreed to delay its effective date
until Dec. 1 in California after
numerous protests from the
agriculture industry.
Reinecks explained the
program affects diesel fuels and
therefore touches a wide range of
industries including trucking
firms, gravel pit operations and
school districts whose buses use
diesel fuel.
Agriculture spokesmen
complained about the program on
the grounds it uSed a formula
based on last November's fuel use
level. They said that many fields
were flooded last year at this time
and therefore it was a poor time
period to U9e as a fuel gauge.
