While traditional language
departments in many American
universities are having trouble
attracting first-class students, their
counter-parts in Britain are being
transformed into broader-based
departments of French, German,
Spanish, and Russian studies.
"Departments which are not
making this change are seeing
their position slowly eroded,"
reported Prof. Ronald Hilton.
"What is worse, their graduates
emerge without the intellectual
curiosity which is vitally and
urgently needed today."
Hilton said he was "struck by
the vitality of langauge
departments in Britain," where he
recently visited several
universities. His findings will be
published in the next issue of
World Affairs Report, published
by the California Institute of
International Studies.
Hilton, a professor of Romanic
languages, also is the author of a
new Lippincott book on The
Latin Americans: Their Heritage
and Their Destiny. Available in
both paper and hard cover
edition, it developed ideas and
facts from his earlier Spanish
language book, La America Latina
de ayer y de hoy, which received
very favorable reviews.
Hilton believes it is important
to have factual and balanced
interpretation of critical and even
explosive issues, and maintains
that Spanish departments are
"failing disgracefully" in this
regard.
"Even though their programs

are labeled literature and
civilization, they feed students a
diet made up almost exclusively
of literature, which they interpret
to mean certain literary genres,
especially poetry, the novel and
the drama," he commented.
"It would not be so bad if they
interpreted literature in the broad
sense so as to include all prose,
such as the history of thought,

biography and travel literature.
"Whether on the A.8., the
A.M. or Ph.D. level, we do a
disservice if we feed students this
unbalanced diet. Students are
demanding a more realistic
approach to Spanish studies, and,
although the esthetes may win
rearguard actions, they are slowly
losing the battle."
