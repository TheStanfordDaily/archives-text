# New IUD Unveiled
## 
### 
LA COSTA, Calif. — The intrauterine device (lUD) is now a viable
birth control method for women who have never had children
according to a medical study reported here this week at the Annual
Meeting of the International Family Planning Research Association
lUD's are used by more than 3,000,000 women in the U.S. to
prevent unwanted conception. However, until recently, the devices
were not tolerated well by childless (nulliparous) women
Now, according to Dr. Betty J. Vaughn, Director of the Orange
County (Fla.) Maternity and Infant Care Projects, a new device called
the Saf-T-Coil Nullip provides the same degree of protection, with the
same levels of tolerance, as other devices provided for women who
have borne children.
Dr. Vaughn reported a 22-month study of the new device, which
involved 206 patients in public health clinics in Florida. Highlight of
the report was the zero pregnancy rate achieved with the small device.
Another important point was ease of insertion, achieved in nearly 90
percent of all cases, with the other patients experiencing only mild
discomfort during insertion. (Previously, insertion in nulliparous
patients has been a problem.)
Dr. Vaughn's report cited recent studies conducted in Florida
which showed high levels of contraceptive failure with other methods
in the patient population under study, the birth control pill being the
principal failed method.
"Clearly," Dr. Vaughn observed, "the young patients need an
alternative form of birth control to orals and the more traditional
methods such as condoms and diaphragms. Preferably, this alternative
method should serve patients with low motivation. The intrauterine
device designed specifically for the nulliparous patient fulfills that
need."
