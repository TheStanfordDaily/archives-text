# Discussions With University Tonight
## 'Save Beutelsbach' Panel Meets 
### DON COX 
A small group of students met last
night to finalize arguments they will
use before the Committee for Foreign
Studies Programs (CFSP) to defend
retention of the University overseas
campus in Beutelsbach, Germany.
Senior Allen Stewart led the 15
students present, most former
Beutelsbach students, in a discussion
of the defense of the financially
stricken overseas campus to be
presented to the CFSP tonight at 7:30
in the large Tresidder lounge.
The committee is presently
considering discontinuing the
Beutelsbach campus program which is
losing approximately $80,000 per year
according to University figures.
"The campus facilitates interaction
with a broad spectrum of Germans,"
Stewart said. "The location of the
campus in a rural area yet close to a
city uniquely provides this spectrum
and makes it possible."
"More characteristic of Germany
than most other countries is the
decentralized history," Stewart
observed. "Thus the experience at
Beutelsbach is more typical of
Germany. The community, unlike
many others, is representative of
modern Germany."
Broad Base
Junior Rob Spitzer pointed out
"that the program must be aimed at
the broad base of Stanford students
and their interests. While other sites
like Munich or Berlin might be
specifically well suited for students
interested in German culture or
East-West relations respectively, such
specificity would scarce off most
general-minded students."
Spitzer termed the campus a
"springboard" to the rest of Europe
because of its central location.
Sites in Munich or Berlin have been
determined by the University to be
more economical but Spitzer feels that
they would only appeal to a select
core of students. "If you want to
reach the largest number of students,
Beutelsbach is the place," he

concluded.
Stewart compared the campus to
the home Palo Alto campus as being
close to but not in the city. "You still
get all of the advantages of a
metropolitan area that you decide you
want. It is easier to get into the city
from the country than to get into the
country from the city."
Revaluation Problems
Hersche Allen, assistant director of
overseas campuses, sat in on the
meeting at Stewart's invitation. She
noted "before the revaluation of the
mark, the University was able to break
even with the program full. The
revaluation has had disastrous effects."
The dramatic financial losses have
been the result of the devaluation of
the U.S. dollar. German inflation and
shifting exchange rates have caused
most of the $100,000 increase in
expenses at the German campus.
Contractural arrangements between
the University and the German
government do not allow much
flexibility in dealing with these
increases.
Although Stewart noted that they
could do nothing about the economic
problems, some discussion did center
around ideas to obtain subsidies from
local German governments. Stewart
reported one student survey which
indicated that the Beutelsbach campus
may have a significant economic
impact on the area and that local
governments might be willing to
subsidize the campus to keep it in
Beutelsbach.
Unique Situation
The group considered the campus
to be unique in its separation from any
German universities. This promoted
more effective linguistic training and
accessibility to a broader range of
German people. The number of
students that could attend an overseas
campus would be severely limited
because they felt a student had to be
more proficient in a language to get
along in a German university.
The family program at Beutelsbach,
a program in which students can live

with German families nearby to some
extent, was heralded as one of the
stronger features of the campus by the
group. Development of more flexible
programs of study lasting up to four
quarters was also discussed.
Stewart felt that the committee
decision "could go either way." It's a
matter of taking the loss or not. "We
feel that it is worth it."

most of the $100,000 increase in
expenses at the German campus.
Contractural arrangements between
the University and the German
government do not allow much
flexibility in dealing with these
increases.
Although Stewart noted that they
could do nothing about the economic
problems, some discussion did center
around ideas to obtain subsidies from
local German governments. Stewart
reported one student survey which
indicated that the Beutelsbach campus
may have a significant economic
impact on the area and that local
governments might be willing to
subsidize the campus to keep it in
Beutelsbach.
Unique Situation
The group considered the campus
to be unique in its separation from any
German universities. This promoted
more effective linguistic training and
accessibility to a broader range of
German people. The number of
students that could attend an overseas
campus would be severely limited
because they felt a student had to be
more proficient in a language to get
along in a German university.
The family program at Beutelsbach,
a program in which students can live

with German families nearby to some
extent, was heralded as one of the
stronger features of the campus by the
group. Development of more flexible
programs of study lasting up to four
quarters was also discussed.
Stewart felt that the committee
decision "could go either way." It's a
matter of taking the loss or not. "We
feel that it is worth it."

SAVE BEUTELSBACH — Former Beutelsbach students prepared last night for a heated debate with the Committee for
Foreign Studies Program scheduled for tonight in the Tresidder large lounge. Allen Stewart (center) led the 15 students
present in a discussion of arguments for the retention of the overseas campus in Germany.
A small group of students met last
night to finalize arguments they will
use before the Committee for Foreign
Studies Programs (CFSP) to defend
retention of the University overseas
campus in Beutelsbach, Germany.
Senior Allen Stewart led the 15
students present, most former
Beutelsbach students, in a discussion
of the defense of the financially
stricken overseas campus to be
presented to the CFSP tonight at 7:30
in the large Tresidder lounge.
The committee is presently
considering discontinuing the
Beutelsbach campus program which is
losing approximately $80,000 per year
according to University figures.
"The campus facilitates interaction
with a broad spectrum of Germans,"
Stewart said. "The location of the
campus in a rural area yet close to a
city uniquely provides this spectrum
and makes it possible."
"More characteristic of Germany
than most other countries is the
decentralized history," Stewart
observed. "Thus the experience at
Beutelsbach is more typical of
Germany. The community, unlike
many others, is representative of
modern Germany."
Broad Base
Junior Rob Spitzer pointed out
"that the program must be aimed at
the broad base of Stanford students
and their interests. While other sites
like Munich or Berlin might be
specifically well suited for students
interested in German culture or
East-West relations respectively, such
specificity would scarce off most
general-minded students."
Spitzer termed the campus a
"springboard" to the rest of Europe
because of its central location.
Sites in Munich or Berlin have been
determined by the University to be
more economical but Spitzer feels that
they would only appeal to a select
core of students. "If you want to
reach the largest number of students,
Beutelsbach is the place," he

concluded.
Stewart compared the campus to
the home Palo Alto campus as being
close to but not in the city. "You still
get all of the advantages of a
metropolitan area that you decide you
want. It is easier to get into the city
from the country than to get into the
country from the city."
Revaluation Problems
Hersche Allen, assistant director of
overseas campuses, sat in on the
meeting at Stewart's invitation. She
noted "before the revaluation of the
mark, the University was able to break
even with the program full. The
revaluation has had disastrous effects."
The dramatic financial losses have
been the result of the devaluation of
the U.S. dollar. German inflation and
shifting exchange rates have caused
most of the $100,000 increase in
expenses at the German campus.
Contractural arrangements between
the University and the German
government do not allow much
flexibility in dealing with these
increases.
