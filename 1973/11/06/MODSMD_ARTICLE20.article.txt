# Alarming Award Size, Frequency
## State Malpractice Woes Growing 
### 
Astronomical medical
malpractice verdicts and
skyrocketing insurance premiums
for physicians are making the
California malpractice picture
rather desperate.
A leading consultant to
physicians on legal-medical
questions. Dr. David S. Rubsamen
of Berkeley, who holds both
medical and law degrees from
Stanford, says the most alarming
trend in malpractice suits is the
size and frequency of awards.
There have been six medical
malpractice awards in California
in excess of $1 million â€” four of
them within the last 20 months.
"The public cannot help but be
impressed by these verdicts. They
not only make a million dollars or
more for serious disability seem
reasonable, but awards in less
severe cases will tend to be
inflated as well," Rubsamen said
in an interview for the current
issue of Stanford M.D., magazine
of the Stanford Medical Alumni
Association.
He cites the difficulty of
insuring physicians, particularly
those in high-risk specialties,
whether they have had suits
against them or not.
In addition, the number of
malpractice claims against doctors
is increasing at a rate of 15 to 20

percent annually, he says.
Changing sentiment among
jurors during the last few years
has intensified the problem for
doctors. Five or six years ago, says
Rubsamen, cases of exceptionally
complex medical facts probably
would have been won by the
defense. Juries in those days
seemed reluctant to second-guess
medical decision-making,
particularly in metropolitan areas.
Recently juries have been more
willing to find for the
patient-plaintiff in complex cases.
Rubsamen foresees further
changes in the malpractice picture
as the California Supreme Court's
recent "informed consent"
decision is enforced. This ruling
states that the patient has a right
to "all information relevant to his
decisional process." The patient
must be told of alternate
treatment methods, unless he
requests not to be told.
The patient has the right to
decide whether to accept one
treatment or another, or to forego
treatment because he is unwilling
to face a possible complication.
The court has also said that a
private physician may not
delegate significant responsibility
for the care of his private patient
without that patient's specific
consent.

Rubsamen emphasized that it
is not enough for the doctor to
tell his patient that a resident of a
teaching hospital will be "on the
team" cooperating in his
treatment. The patient must be
made aware that the resident will
be performing the operation.
With the prospect of rising
awards and increased legal actions,
Rubsamen has studied the
question of no-fault liability in
medical malpractice, and he
determined that in the end that
system would be as accusatory as
the present system.
Taken literally, he says, a
no-fault system means payment
for every unanticipated disability
resulting from medical
intervention or omission. The
slightest evidence of medical
oversight would "ring the
compensation bell."
Under a no-fault system,
Rubsamen says, "there would be
pressure for defensive medicine
far in excess of anything we have
today." He cautions that we could
end up trying to define ideal care,

and paying compensation to any
patient who suffered for lack of
it.
Instead, the doctor-lawyer
suggests another approach:
eliminating the jurors, the
courtroom, and the judge. With
arbitration, an informal hearing
would be held in a small office
before an arbitrator a L -eed upon
by both defendant and plaintiff.
The arbitrator's decision is
usually final, with laws limiting
appeal. Advantages, says
Rubsamen, would be privacy for
both doctor and patient, and
quick disposition of cases.
Arbitration, he says, would put
a lid on skyrocketing awards for
the patient-plaintiff. However,
there is also more assurance of a
decision for the patient with a
relatively trivial disability which
an attorney may not otherwise
decide is worthwhile to pursue.
Robsamen feels that the most
effective legal reforms over the
next 10 to 20 years will be
procedural: trial before a judge,
select panel, or arbitrator.
