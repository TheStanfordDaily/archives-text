# Farmers Allocated Fuel For Harvest
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - "We
cannot allow food crops to rot in
the fields," the director of the
federal government's Office of Oil
and Gas said yesterday in
announcing that California
farmers will get the fuel they need
to harvest crops.
But Duke R. Ligon, director of
the U.S. Department of Interior
office, said in a statement released
here yesterday the mandatory fuel
allocation program is being
enforced in California.
He said Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke's
statement Friday that the
allocation program would not be
enforced in the state until Dec. 1
was not correct. Reinecke had
said Friday that Ligon told him
the program would not be
enforced in the state until that
time.
"We are not waiving the
allocation program; we cannot
under federal law," Ligon said.
The announcement of fuel
allocations last Wednesday
brought waves of protest from
farmers and agricultural groups
across the state who feared there
would not be enough fuel to
power machinery to harvest crops.
The state Board of Food and
Agriculture asked Gov. Ronald
Reagan to intercede with
President Nixon to delay the
program.
Ligon said emergency
allocations for farmers will be
approved.
"In California, the needs of the
agricultural economy should be
met now, even though in some
cases needs for November 1973
will exceed useage of diesel fuels
in November 1972," he said.
"Seasonal variation could mean
that a farmer's allocation for
November of this year could be
inadequate, yet his December
allocation may be more than is
needed.
"We cannot allow food crops
to rot in the fields while farmers
await their December allocations.
I'm asking suppliers to make

immediate allocation on the basis
of meeting the immediate
requirements of California
agriculture."
Farmers said they were upset
with the allocation program
because it bases 1973 fuel
allocations on 1972 consumption
levels. Farm leaders said floods
and other problems in November
1972 reduced the acreage to be
harvested. The 1973 acreage
which must be harvested by
machinery needing the diesel fuel
is much greater.
