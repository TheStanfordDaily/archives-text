# Rookie Crew To Man Skylab 3
## 
### 
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) - When the
Skylab 3 rocket lifts off Saturday, it will carry the
firet all-rookie American space crew since Gemini 8
in 1966.
But the absence of a seasoned space traveler
doesn't bother Skylab 3 commander Gerald P. Carr,
whose crew faces a record 85-day mission.
"I've always felt that there's no substitute for
experience and I have no doubt that we're going to
wish on occasion that we had a space veteran up
there with us," Carr said in an interview.
"But I'm certain we can carry out the job. I
think the space program has matured to the point
where previous experience is not necessarily
mandatory as long as you can leam from those who
proceeded you and have proper training.
"And I guess someone in NASA agrees with me,"
Carr said. "Otherwise we wouldn't be flying."
He said he and crewmates William R. Pogue and
Edward G. Gibson have discussed all aspects of their
flight with the Skylab 1 and 2 astronauts, who spent
28 and 59 days, respectively, aboard the orbiting
station.
"We closeted ourselves with them and talked
about every minute detail," Carr reported. "I've
been in on every crew debriefing since early Apollo.
So you gain experience there.
"But I think it would be awfully naive to think
we can go up there and not expect any problems
caused by inexperience," he said. "I think we'll have

to adjust to certain things that we don't understand
and don't have the experience to understand
now. But I don't see anything major."
Two veteran space pilots, Charles Conrad Jr. and
Alan L. Bean, both previous moonwalkers,
commanded the first two Skylab crews. Their
experience proved especially valuable in Skylab
repair jobs.
Carr,Pogue, and Gibson continued their extensive
training Monday at the Johnson Space Center,
Houston, Tex. They'll fly to Cape Canaveral
Wednesday to make final preparations for lifting off
Saturday on man's third and final visit to the Skylab
laboratory.
Launch of the Saturn IB rocket is set for 8:40
a.m., PST.
For the record, just how did the last all-rookie
crew perform?
Gemini 8 astronauts Neil A. Armstrong and
David R. Scott executed the first docking of a
manned vehicle in space, linking up with an
unmanned Agena satellite on March 16, 1966. But
shortly afterwards, a jet thruster on the Gemini
craft stuck open and sent them tumbling out of
control.
Armstrong and Scott were within seconds of
blacking out and possible death when their flying
skill enabled them to disengage from the Agena and
bring their spaceship under control. They made a
safe emergency landing in the Pacific Ocean.
