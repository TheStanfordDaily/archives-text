# Carnegie Corp. Gives Colleges $595,000

NEW YORK — Carnegie
Corporation of New York has
awarded the Association of
American Colleges a grant of
$595,000 toward a million dollar
five-year project to encourage and
support reforms in undergraduate
education.
The project, to be
co-sponsored by five national
higher educational associations
including the AAC, will involve
the cooperation of approximately
ten institutions which will work
with the project staff in
implementing new curricular
approaches to liberal learning on
their campuses.
The project grew out of a
year's study by the AAC's
Commission on Liberal Learning,
which concluded that the
traditional goals of liberal
education are as important as ever

but that the means of attaining
them need to be revised.
'Too Narrow'
Samuel H. Magill of the AAC
staff, in commenting on the
project which he helped develop,
said, "Higher education remains
overwhelmingly based on study of
the disciplines — a mode which is
proving too narrow and rigid and
thus inadequate to the task of
equipping individuals to meet the
challenges of a complex and
changing society.
"However," he added, "many
of the notable experiments going
on in new colleges or in sections
of traditional institutions, such as
work-study, use of learning
contracts, and off-campus
experience, are not really
addressed to a fundamental
restructuring of higher education
but are content with rearranging

present academic furniture.
"The dilemma, of course, in
any of these efforts is how to
institute lasting, effective change
without creating new difficulties
which may, in fact, undermine the
very purposes of innovation. A
major part of the AAC's project
therefore will be to spell out the
dilemmas and problems in
promoting reform, to challenge
the assumptions underlying
traditional higher education, and
to suggest a framework where
alternatives to the
disciplinary-based curriculum will
have the best chance of evolving."
Hypothetical Models
The first three years of the
AAC project will be devoted to
developing various hypothetical
models for undergraduate
education and modifying them to
suit the mission and resources of
the participating institutions. The
project time-table calls for
institutional programs to be in full
operation by the end of the third
year. This will provide two years'
operating experience and time to
evolve strategies to assess the
experimental programs against a
control group of colleges and
universities with comparable
objectives.
The ten participants, which
will be selected over the next
seven months, will be drawn from
diverse types of institutions,
including liberal arts colleges,
liberal arts components of
universities, community and
junior colleges, and undergraduate
professional schools with a liberal
education emphasis in their
programs. They will be chosen on
the basis of demonstrated
commitment to the project's
goals, and will each be responsible
— through an institutional policy
and programming group of
faculty, students, administrators,
trustees, and others — for the
study and formulation of
proposals for institutional reform
and for the promotion of concrete
results.

The sponsoring associations in
addition to the AAC are the
American Association of
Community and Junior Colleges,
the American Association of State
Colleges and Universities, the
American Association of

University Professors, and the
National Association of State
Universities and Land Grant
Colleges. They will participate
through representatives on a
Project Policy Board which will
also include two public members.

alternatives to the
disciplinary-based curriculum will
have the best chance of evolving."
Hypothetical Models
The first three years of the
AAC project will be devoted to
developing various hypothetical
models for undergraduate
education and modifying them to
suit the mission and resources of
the participating institutions. The
project time-table calls for
institutional programs to be in full
operation by the end of the third
year. This will provide two years'
operating experience and time to
evolve strategies to assess the
experimental programs against a
control group of colleges and
universities with comparable
objectives.
The ten participants, which
will be selected over the next
seven months, will be drawn from
diverse types of institutions,
including liberal arts colleges,
liberal arts components of
universities, community and
junior colleges, and undergraduate
professional schools with a liberal
education emphasis in their
programs. They will be chosen on
the basis of demonstrated
commitment to the project's
goals, and will each be responsible
— through an institutional policy
and programming group of
faculty, students, administrators,
trustees, and others — for the
study and formulation of
proposals for institutional reform
and for the promotion of concrete
results.

The sponsoring associations in
addition to the AAC are the
American Association of
Community and Junior Colleges,
the American Association of State
Colleges and Universities, the
American Association of

University Professors, and the
National Association of State
Universities and Land Grant
Colleges. They will participate
through representatives on a
Project Policy Board which will
also include two public members.
NEW YORK — Carnegie
Corporation of New York has
awarded the Association of
American Colleges a grant of
$595,000 toward a million dollar
five-year project to encourage and
support reforms in undergraduate
education.
The project, to be
co-sponsored by five national
higher educational associations
including the AAC, will involve
the cooperation of approximately
ten institutions which will work
with the project staff in
implementing new curricular
approaches to liberal learning on
their campuses.
The project grew out of a
year's study by the AAC's
Commission on Liberal Learning,
which concluded that the
traditional goals of liberal
education are as important as ever

but that the means of attaining
them need to be revised.
'Too Narrow'
Samuel H. Magill of the AAC
staff, in commenting on the
project which he helped develop,
said, "Higher education remains
overwhelmingly based on study of
the disciplines — a mode which is
proving too narrow and rigid and
thus inadequate to the task of
equipping individuals to meet the
challenges of a complex and
changing society.
"However," he added, "many
of the notable experiments going
on in new colleges or in sections
of traditional institutions, such as
work-study, use of learning
contracts, and off-campus
experience, are not really
addressed to a fundamental
restructuring of higher education
but are content with rearranging

present academic furniture.
"The dilemma, of course, in
any of these efforts is how to
institute lasting, effective change
without creating new difficulties
which may, in fact, undermine the
very purposes of innovation. A
major part of the AAC's project
therefore will be to spell out the
dilemmas and problems in
promoting reform, to challenge
the assumptions underlying
traditional higher education, and
to suggest a framework where
alternatives to the
disciplinary-based curriculum will
have the best chance of evolving."
