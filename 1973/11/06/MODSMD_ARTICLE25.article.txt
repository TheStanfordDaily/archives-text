# Capitol's Energy Usage Soars During Shortage
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” While Congress ponders ways to defuse the
energy crisis, its own consumption of power is soaring.
The demand for power on Capitol Hill is rising at a rate of more
than three million kilowatt hours a year, and there is little hope the
trend can be reversed, says Benjamin F. Markert, the Capitol's
coordinating engineer.
Energy saving measures have been imposed, but these are largely
cosmetic, Markert adds. They include turning off corridor lights and
urging congressional offices to open window blinds to cut down the
demand for artificial lighting.
There's "no way to cut back," says Markert. Any significant power
reductions would have to be made at the expense of congressional
efficiency, he says, since most of the increased demand is attributed
to a growing reliance on data processing machines.
Turning off corridor lights barely makes a dent in the Capitol's
total energy consumption, the engineer says. Nor, he adds, does
shutting off excess lights in committee hearing rooms or the offices of
individual members of Congress.
Even if all the lights were turned off, says an aide to Rep. Torbert
H. Macdonald, D-Mass., chairman of the subcommittee on power, it
wouldn't make much difference because the biggest share of the
electricity bill goes to heating the Capitol Hill complex in winter and
cooling it in summer.
The heating and cooling system will demand even more electricity
in 1977 when an annex to the Library of Congress is completed,
creating some 65 additional acres of floor space.
Today's growth in energy demand is due primarily to an increased
use of computers by Congress trying to streamline its operating
procedures.
The Senate recently installed its second computer to help with
payrolls, inventories, mail and to keep track of the status of bills and
other matters pending before Congress.
The House has three computers. Two of them run an electronic
voting system designed to cut in half the time needed for a roll call
vote.
Congressional energy demand is increasing about four percent a
year, about the same as the rest of the country.
In the last fiscal year, Capitol Hill, which includes the Supreme
Court, Library of Congress, the Capitol and five related office
buildings, used 150 million kilowatt hours of electricity, according to
Markert.
Translated to barrels of oil, that comes out to about 90,000 barrels
for the entire year. An estimated 17 million barrels of oil are
consumed each day in the United States.
