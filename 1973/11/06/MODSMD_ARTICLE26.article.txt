# Chilly Night At Winterland
## Robin Trower, Wishbone Ash Steal Show 
### KEITH COPELAND 
SAN FRANCISCO - Although
Mark-Almond was listed as the
headlining band at last weekend's
Winterland concert, Robin Trower
and Wishbone Ash proved that
they were quite capable of
heading the bill by themselves.
"I'd like you to meet..., back
to the U.S. ..., Robin Trower!"
The audience applauds politely as
the ex-Procol Harum guitarist
with the boyish, toothy smile
straps on his Fender Stratocaster.
Accompanied by ex-Quiver
drummer Reg Isadore and
bassist-vocalist Jim Dewar, Trower

began the concert with
enthusiasm. It was obvious that
they were glad to be there.
Trower, who split amicably
with Procol Harum right after
Broken Barricades, played in a
style very much like that of the
late Jimi Hendrix. This
assessment, though far from
original, is nonetheless very true.
Trower sounds ahellava lot like
Hendrix in almost everything he
plays. His reverence for Hendrix
became truly visible when he did
"Song for a Dreamer," an ode of
sorts to Hendrix.
Trower proceeded through the

hour-long set with many new
tunes. These included
"Lady Love" and "Little Bit Of
Sympathy," which are on a
soon-to-be-released album. As the
set progressed, rocking tunes
alternated with lofty, dreamy,
moving, melodies.
Well Received By Crowd
Trower breathed new life into
the outdated "Rock Me Baby"
and played with equal expertise
his latest work, "Twice Removed
from Yesterday." The audience
loved him, calling for two encores
which he obviously enjoyed.

During the intermission the
Winterland closed circuit TV
system, which shows close-ups of
performers while on stage, showed
some clips (stolen from television
In Concert) of the New Riders of
the Purple Sage, next month's
headliners. If you have any plans
to go see them, don't. It's a waste
of time.
The two-thirds filled,
predominately teeny-bopper
audience became increasingly
impatient with the length of time
between acts. The TV wasn't
helping any either.
I'll admit I was growing a little

impatient also. The heater
apparently wasn't working and it
was getting chilly. In addition, the
ancient, delapidated seats were
about as comfortable as the front
seat of a Mack truck!
Wishbone Ash Forceful
Finally, Wishbone Ash came
on, and was definitely worth the
wait. They played some of the
most forceful music heard to date
by this reviewer. They seemed to
be a cross between Yes, Led
Zepplin, and the Mahavishnu
Orchestra. They were bad!
The music was a constant
explosion of throbbing,
ear-piercing, grinding,
teeth-grit ting sensations. The
syncopated rhythms gave the
body a feeling of movement, a
sense of something wonderful,
euphoric. Especially good was
"The Warrior," from the album
Argus.
I was impressed. Wishbone
Ash's ability to create powerful,
driving emotion through their
music is in part due to Ted
Turner, the lead guitarist. Turner
played with a style that can only
be termed magnificent.
Poetic 'Phoenix'
Turner particularly showed his
virtuosity in rendering "Phoenix"
in a most poetic style. Wishbone
Ash has arrived and will no doubt
be around for a long time.
By the time Mark Almond
came on, the auditorium was
freezing cold. Much of the
audience had left but those who
stayed were apparently not
disappointed (I left after the third
song). John Mark's friendly,
soothing voice warmed the crowd
immediately. Johnny Almond on
flute was excellent.
The remainder of the concert
was no doubt good, but I just
couldn't take the cold anymore.
Next time, I'll bring my overcoat.

Broken Barricades, played in a
style very much like that of the
late Jimi Hendrix. This
assessment, though far from
original, is nonetheless very true.
Trower sounds ahellava lot like
Hendrix in almost everything he
plays. His reverence for Hendrix
became truly visible when he did
"Song for a Dreamer," an ode of
sorts to Hendrix.
Trower proceeded through the

hour-long set with many new
tunes. These included
"Lady Love" and "Little Bit Of
Sympathy," which are on a
soon-to-be-released album. As the
set progressed, rocking tunes
alternated with lofty, dreamy,
moving, melodies.
Well Received By Crowd
Trower breathed new life into
the outdated "Rock Me Baby"
and played with equal expertise
his latest work, "Twice Removed
from Yesterday." The audience
loved him, calling for two encores
which he obviously enjoyed.

During the intermission the
Winterland closed circuit TV
system, which shows close-ups of
performers while on stage, showed
some clips (stolen from television
In Concert) of the New Riders of
the Purple Sage, next month's
headliners. If you have any plans
to go see them, don't. It's a waste
of time.
The two-thirds filled,
predominately teeny-bopper
audience became increasingly
impatient with the length of time
between acts. The TV wasn't
helping any either.
I'll admit I was growing a little

impatient also. The heater
apparently wasn't working and it
was getting chilly. In addition, the
ancient, delapidated seats were
about as comfortable as the front
seat of a Mack truck!
Wishbone Ash Forceful
Finally, Wishbone Ash came
on, and was definitely worth the
wait. They played some of the
most forceful music heard to date
by this reviewer. They seemed to
be a cross between Yes, Led
Zepplin, and the Mahavishnu
Orchestra. They were bad!
The music was a constant
explosion of throbbing,
ear-piercing, grinding,
teeth-grit ting sensations. The
syncopated rhythms gave the
body a feeling of movement, a
sense of something wonderful,
euphoric. Especially good was
"The Warrior," from the album
Argus.
I was impressed. Wishbone
Ash's ability to create powerful,
driving emotion through their
music is in part due to Ted
Turner, the lead guitarist. Turner
played with a style that can only
be termed magnificent.
Poetic 'Phoenix'
Turner particularly showed his
virtuosity in rendering "Phoenix"
in a most poetic style. Wishbone
Ash has arrived and will no doubt
be around for a long time.
By the time Mark Almond
came on, the auditorium was
freezing cold. Much of the
audience had left but those who
stayed were apparently not
disappointed (I left after the third
song). John Mark's friendly,
soothing voice warmed the crowd
immediately. Johnny Almond on
flute was excellent.
The remainder of the concert
was no doubt good, but I just
couldn't take the cold anymore.
Next time, I'll bring my overcoat.
SAN FRANCISCO - Although
Mark-Almond was listed as the
headlining band at last weekend's
Winterland concert, Robin Trower
and Wishbone Ash proved that
they were quite capable of
heading the bill by themselves.
"I'd like you to meet..., back
to the U.S. ..., Robin Trower!"
The audience applauds politely as
the ex-Procol Harum guitarist
with the boyish, toothy smile
straps on his Fender Stratocaster.
Accompanied by ex-Quiver
drummer Reg Isadore and
bassist-vocalist Jim Dewar, Trower

began the concert with
enthusiasm. It was obvious that
they were glad to be there.

with Procol Harum right after
