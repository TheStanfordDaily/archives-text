# Hundreds Pack St. James For 'Sale'
## 
### KEVIN FLYNN 
People lined up to get shots at
the St. James Infirmary Sunday,
but the management promised no
cures.
For the Infirmary is a saloon,
and the shots it dispensed were in
glasses at the celebration of its
fourth annual "going out of
business sale."
At one point, a hundred people
waited to enter the raucous bar in
Mountain View. Inside, three
hundred more danced, screamed,
ate peanuts, and drank endless
17-cent beers and 25-cent shots of
Chivas Regal.
As dazed party-goers wandered
out of the bar, two door-keepers
let more in.
Loud Music
Climbing over bodies, those
entering first hit a solid blast of
noise. Recorded tapes sent insane
noises, and occasionally some
recognizable music, blaring
through four massive
loudspeakers.
Bartenders yelled above the
din for more glasses. Dancers sang
with or without a song. People
shouted in each other's ear just to
be heard.
It was nearly impossible to
move. But as their eyes adjusted
to the smoke, people looking up
could see hanging from the ceiling
airplanes, carriages, life-size
wooden horses, wagon wheels,
mannequins, signs for Wall Drug
of South Dakota, and pictures of
Marlene Dietrich.
"This is a bar?" someone

asked, staring upward.
Dozens of license plates —
"Minnesota 1962," "Vermont
1956" — lined the beams.
Enormous "Freeway Entrance"
signs marked the exits. A ten-foot
penguin hung over two tables.
Above the dance floor poised a
steamroller. A red light flashed in

The Stanford Daily
Entertainment

the eye of a five-foot fish's head,
looking down on the crowd.
Peanut shells crunched under
hundreds of feet. They had run
out of peanuts. They had run out
of almost everything; peanuts at 7
p.m., orange juice at 9, glasses at
9:15. But plenty of liquor
remained.
Hardly Wallbangers
A bartender later admitted
making Wallbangers with
grapefruit juice instead of orange
juice. "Nobody knew the
difference," he laughed.
When the theme from Zorba
the Greek came on, people
mounted the tables to dance. A
couple grabbed a leg of a 30-foot

statue, supporting themselves so
they could kick higher.
By 10 p.m. they were serving
the Chivas in beer steins. All
available glasses were in use. Few
people wanted to drink beer when
the "good stuff' cost a quarter.
Bartenders prepared pitchers of
margaritas, mugs of Bacardi.

Excuse Me,
Just Passing Out
"It was the biggest volume
night in the history of the bar,"
said the manager. He added that
about a thousand customers had
passed through. He didn't say how
many passed out.
An old song by the Rascals
began and the crowd struggled
mightily to dance under the
truckloads of junk hanging from
the ceiling, mostly movie props
from the old Paramount Studio.
St. James is part of a chain of
nine "Great American Saloons" in
California and Arizona that
proudly claims to be the largest
Budweiser outlet in the world.

"Also Chivas," said the manager.
No one questioned that St. James
was out-pouring anyone else for
miles last Sunday.
Nearly A Record
"I have never seen so many
people so drunk — that is, since
St. Patrick's Day in 1971," said an
ex-bartender who returned for the
celebration.
People drank anddanced in all
sorts of wierd positions. Others
patiently tried to edge to the bars.
A dazed customer, his eyes
rolling wildly, complained of
"insanity . . . sheer insanity." But
most people appeared to enjoy
themselves. No fights erupted in
the parking lot. No "bikers"
crashed the scene.
"It was a very mellow group,"
said the manager. "Most of them
had to get to work on Monday
morning."
A slow song came on and the
crowd sighed in relief. Drooping
couples leaned against other
drooping couples. There was no
place to sit. Just time to have
another 25-cent Jack Daniels and
start dancing again.

hundreds of feet. They had run
out of peanuts. They had run out
of almost everything; peanuts at 7
p.m., orange juice at 9, glasses at
9:15. But plenty of liquor
remained.
Hardly Wallbangers
A bartender later admitted
making Wallbangers with
grapefruit juice instead of orange
juice. "Nobody knew the
difference," he laughed.
When the theme from Zorba
the Greek came on, people
mounted the tables to dance. A
couple grabbed a leg of a 30-foot

statue, supporting themselves so
they could kick higher.
By 10 p.m. they were serving
the Chivas in beer steins. All
available glasses were in use. Few
people wanted to drink beer when
the "good stuff' cost a quarter.
Bartenders prepared pitchers of
margaritas, mugs of Bacardi.

Excuse Me,
Just Passing Out
"It was the biggest volume
night in the history of the bar,"
said the manager. He added that
about a thousand customers had
passed through. He didn't say how
many passed out.
An old song by the Rascals
began and the crowd struggled
mightily to dance under the
truckloads of junk hanging from
the ceiling, mostly movie props
from the old Paramount Studio.
St. James is part of a chain of
nine "Great American Saloons" in
California and Arizona that
proudly claims to be the largest
Budweiser outlet in the world.

"Also Chivas," said the manager.
No one questioned that St. James
was out-pouring anyone else for
miles last Sunday.
Nearly A Record
"I have never seen so many
people so drunk — that is, since
St. Patrick's Day in 1971," said an
ex-bartender who returned for the
celebration.
People drank anddanced in all
sorts of wierd positions. Others
patiently tried to edge to the bars.
A dazed customer, his eyes
rolling wildly, complained of
"insanity . . . sheer insanity." But
most people appeared to enjoy
themselves. No fights erupted in
the parking lot. No "bikers"
crashed the scene.
"It was a very mellow group,"
said the manager. "Most of them
had to get to work on Monday
morning."
A slow song came on and the
crowd sighed in relief. Drooping
couples leaned against other
drooping couples. There was no
place to sit. Just time to have
another 25-cent Jack Daniels and
start dancing again.
People lined up to get shots at
the St. James Infirmary Sunday,
but the management promised no
cures.
For the Infirmary is a saloon,
and the shots it dispensed were in
glasses at the celebration of its
fourth annual "going out of
business sale."
At one point, a hundred people
waited to enter the raucous bar in
Mountain View. Inside, three
hundred more danced, screamed,
ate peanuts, and drank endless
17-cent beers and 25-cent shots of
Chivas Regal.
As dazed party-goers wandered
out of the bar, two door-keepers
let more in.
Loud Music
Climbing over bodies, those
entering first hit a solid blast of
noise. Recorded tapes sent insane
noises, and occasionally some
recognizable music, blaring
through four massive
loudspeakers.
Bartenders yelled above the
din for more glasses. Dancers sang
with or without a song. People
shouted in each other's ear just to
be heard.
It was nearly impossible to
move. But as their eyes adjusted
to the smoke, people looking up
could see hanging from the ceiling
airplanes, carriages, life-size
wooden horses, wagon wheels,
mannequins, signs for Wall Drug
of South Dakota, and pictures of
Marlene Dietrich.
"This is a bar?" someone

asked, staring upward.
Dozens of license plates —
"Minnesota 1962," "Vermont
1956" — lined the beams.
Enormous "Freeway Entrance"
signs marked the exits. A ten-foot
penguin hung over two tables.
Above the dance floor poised a
steamroller. A red light flashed in

The Stanford Daily
Entertainment

the eye of a five-foot fish's head,
looking down on the crowd.
Peanut shells crunched under
hundreds of feet. They had run
out of peanuts. They had run out
