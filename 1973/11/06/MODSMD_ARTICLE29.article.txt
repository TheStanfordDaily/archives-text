# Plays Unique Instrument
## Yepes Delights Guitar Aficionados 
### MICHAEL SAFFLE 
Dinkelspiel Auditorium was invaded by
hordes of guitarists and music buffs Friday
evening who listened, cheered, and left
playfully threatening to throw their own
instruments away. The reason?
Narciso Yepes
A tiny, aging man dressed in evening
clothes boasting a single decoration on the left
lapel, Yepes handles his specially designed,
ten-string guitar with marvellous assurance
and enjoyment. He has performed with almost
all the world's great orchestras, cut two dozen
records, and presently teaches flocks of
students in his Madrid home. Every aspect of
his own playing demonstrates the competence
such broad experience gives him.
Opening his lengthy and exhaustive
program with two "Pavanas" by Luis Milan, a
Renaissance lute composer, Yepes played with
cautious but resonant phrasing and deep
musical conviction. His ten-string guitar
eliminates any need to transcribe lute music,
and its sound carried beautifully despite
Dink's notoriously weak acoustics.
A Mudarra Fantasia and a Bach lute suite
followed the Milan pavanas. Mudarra's
unusual work, filled with dissonance and
flashes of melody, received an equally

resonant, convicing performance.
J.S. Bach's suite for lute, BWV 998, was
somewhat less successful. No one could fault
the clarity and precision of the opening
Prelude and Presto, but the Sarabande's
continuity disappeared in a welter of subtle,
almost precious, detail, and the concluding
Bouree and Gigue were rushed. A sprinkling
of wrong notes attested to the extreme
difficulty of the last dance.
Heitor Villa-Lobos' "Seven Studies"
received a better performance. Musically
uneven, Villa-Lobs' studies gave Yepes a
chance to warm up for the modern works
that followed.
Yepes demonstrated that his heart really
belongs to more contemporary composers,
whose music comprised the second half of the
programs. The traditional Spanish rhythms
and tunes of Granados' well-known
"Villanesca" and Albeniz "Malaguena" call
for brilliant, idiomatic interpretation. Yepes
supplied it, and the audience loved every
moment. Manuel de Falla's strange
"Hommage au Tombeau de Debussy," a less
consistent work, also received a fine
performance.
Yepes polished off the evening with three

works dedicated to him and his new
instrument. Mauricio Obana's attractive
"Tiento" and the "Colecticio intimo" of
Vicente Asencio arc musically modest,
technically arduous pieces Yepes played
effortlessly and beautifully.
Asencio'; "Colecticio" consists of five
movements: an opening serenade, several
'mood-pictures' ( 'La Calma" is especially
nice), and two concluding display pieces with
Flamenco touches. Not the world's greatest
music, perhaps, but definitely among the
world's greatest performances!
Leonardo Balada's masterful, multi-colored
"Analogias" consists of four movements, each
carefully contoured to particular aspects of
ten-string guitar techniques; each is strong,
sonorous, effective modern guitar music. My
personal favorite w "Propulsiones," filled
with ringing chords, but the concluding
"Ahismos" was equally stunning, and just as
stunningly played.
Yepes surrendered to audience enthusiasm
and, for an encore, romped through a Bouree
(I didn't catch the composer) stuffed with
technical trickery: rapid runs, glissandi, and
multiple harmonics. Yepes may look
unassuming, but he's a real artist and
showman.

continuity disappeared in a welter of subtle,
almost precious, detail, and the concluding
Bouree and Gigue were rushed. A sprinkling
of wrong notes attested to the extreme
difficulty of the last dance.
Heitor Villa-Lobos' "Seven Studies"
received a better performance. Musically
uneven, Villa-Lobs' studies gave Yepes a
chance to warm up for the modern works
that followed.
Yepes demonstrated that his heart really
belongs to more contemporary composers,
whose music comprised the second half of the
programs. The traditional Spanish rhythms
and tunes of Granados' well-known
"Villanesca" and Albeniz "Malaguena" call
for brilliant, idiomatic interpretation. Yepes
supplied it, and the audience loved every
moment. Manuel de Falla's strange
"Hommage au Tombeau de Debussy," a less
consistent work, also received a fine
performance.
Yepes polished off the evening with three

works dedicated to him and his new
instrument. Mauricio Obana's attractive
"Tiento" and the "Colecticio intimo" of
Vicente Asencio arc musically modest,
technically arduous pieces Yepes played
effortlessly and beautifully.
Asencio'; "Colecticio" consists of five
movements: an opening serenade, several
'mood-pictures' ( 'La Calma" is especially
nice), and two concluding display pieces with
Flamenco touches. Not the world's greatest
music, perhaps, but definitely among the
world's greatest performances!
Leonardo Balada's masterful, multi-colored
"Analogias" consists of four movements, each
carefully contoured to particular aspects of
ten-string guitar techniques; each is strong,
sonorous, effective modern guitar music. My
personal favorite w "Propulsiones," filled
with ringing chords, but the concluding
"Ahismos" was equally stunning, and just as
stunningly played.
Yepes surrendered to audience enthusiasm
and, for an encore, romped through a Bouree
(I didn't catch the composer) stuffed with
technical trickery: rapid runs, glissandi, and
multiple harmonics. Yepes may look
unassuming, but he's a real artist and
showman.
Dinkelspiel Auditorium was invaded by
hordes of guitarists and music buffs Friday
evening who listened, cheered, and left
playfully threatening to throw their own
instruments away. The reason?
Narciso Yepes
A tiny, aging man dressed in evening
clothes boasting a single decoration on the left
lapel, Yepes handles his specially designed,
ten-string guitar with marvellous assurance
and enjoyment. He has performed with almost
all the world's great orchestras, cut two dozen
records, and presently teaches flocks of
students in his Madrid home. Every aspect of
his own playing demonstrates the competence
such broad experience gives him.
Opening his lengthy and exhaustive
program with two "Pavanas" by Luis Milan, a
Renaissance lute composer, Yepes played with
cautious but resonant phrasing and deep
musical conviction. His ten-string guitar
eliminates any need to transcribe lute music,
and its sound carried beautifully despite
Dink's notoriously weak acoustics.
A Mudarra Fantasia and a Bach lute suite
followed the Milan pavanas. Mudarra's
unusual work, filled with dissonance and
flashes of melody, received an equally

resonant, convicing performance.
J.S. Bach's suite for lute, BWV 998, was
somewhat less successful. No one could fault
the clarity and precision of the opening
Prelude and Presto, but the Sarabande's
continuity disappeared in a welter of subtle,
almost precious, detail, and the concluding
Bouree and Gigue were rushed. A sprinkling
of wrong notes attested to the extreme
difficulty of the last dance.
