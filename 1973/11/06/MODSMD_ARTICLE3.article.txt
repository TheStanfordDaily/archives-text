# Proposition One Heads Short Ballot
## Reagan Tax Initiative Vote Today 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
California voters will decide the
fate today of one of the most
bitterly-contested ballot initiatives in
the state's history, Gov. Ronald
Reagan's tax limitation proposal.
The plan, Proposition One on the
special election ballot, would amend
the state constitution to set a ceiling
on the amount the state legislature can
raise through taxation. The ceiling
would be 8.75 percent of the state's
total personal income the first year,
declining .1 percent a year until 1989.
Observers speculate that passage of
the plan, which needs a simple
majority for approval, would boost
Reagan's chances for the 1976
Republican Presidential nomination.
The governor's second term in
Sacramento expires next year, and he
has said he will not be a candidate for
any elective office in 1974.
Both sides in the Proposition One
battle have pulled out all the stops in
their campaigns. Supporters, operating
under banners like "Californians for
Lower Taxes," have purchased ads and
television radio spots hailing the
proposal as a workable, equitable
solution to the problem of rising taxes.
Hoover Backers
The proposal has the backing of
several prominent conservative

economists, including Prof. Milton
Friedman of the University of
Chicago. W. Glenn Campbell, director
of the Hoover Institution here, and
Martin Anderson, Roger Freeman and
Dan T. Smith, senior fellows at
Hoover, are all listed as advisors and
consultants to the governor's tax
reduction task force.
Both the Los Angeles Times and
the San Francisco Chronicle also back
the proposal.
Foes of the measure include state
legislative analyst A. Alan Post, who
strongly criticized the plan in a report
to the legislature, state Superintendent
of Public Instruction Wilson Riles, the
state AFL-CIO, the League of Women
Voters and the California Teachers
Association.
In addition, opponents include a
veritable who's who of candidates for
the 1974 Democratic gubernatorial
nomination, including Assembly
Speaker Bob Moretti, state Senate
Majority Leader George Moscone and
Secretary of State Edmund G. Brown
Jr.
Proponents have asked state Atty.
Gen. Evelle Younger to "keep a close
eye on the Nov. 6 election,"
particularly because of Brown's
"highly partisan stance." Brown is the
state's chief election officer.)

Foes of the measure have been
devoting much of their advertising
money to a last-minute media
campaign, charging that Proposition
One is "a fraud and a hoax" that will
simply shift the tax burden from state
to local government, forcing property
taxes "up, up and up."
Santa Clara County voters will also
have a second chance to decide if they
want to go ahead with construction of
a county sports arena. Although the

arena plan was approved last
November, a new state law forces
another vote to approve the property
tax boost necessary to fund it.
Polling places on campus for
today's election are at Tresidder, the
Campus Recreation Association,
Nixon School and Escondido School.
Polls wil be open today from 7 a.m.
to 8 p.m.
