# Wagner's 'Ring': An Operatic Analogy To Watergate
## 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
(First of two parts)
The real meaning of the
Watergate affair.. .. How many
preambles such as this have we
read in recent months. Each
commentator has his own more or
less morbid angle on the amazing
tale of political corruption. I
would not be offering yet
another, except that the facts of
the Watergate strike me as
extraordinarily similar to — and
illuminated by — perhaps the
greatest allegory of political
corruption ever created.
I refer to Richard Wagner's The
Ring of the Nibelungs, the
immesne operatic tetralogy which
traces the decline of the race of
gods and their leader Wotan.
Over the century Wagner's
Ring has been subjected to many
allegorical interpretations: G.B.
Shaw very early on produced a
rousing marxist-socialist version;
equally striking Freudian and
Jungian views have since come to
light. It is a measure of this work's
greatness that it can sustain such
varied explanations.
But one level of Wagner's
masterpiece seems to have been
slighted, and that is its anatomy
of political corruption. Toward
the end of the summer's
Watergate investigations I had the
chance to attend an English
version of the Ring performed by
the Sadlers Wells company in
London. What with the
immediacy of current events, the
English translation, and the
brilliant production, the relevance
of the Ring to Watergate slowly
dawned. The moment is ripe for a
look at a fictional Watergate now
that the factual one is largely
before us.
An Operatic Watergate
In fact, the depth, the
awfulness and — if one can use the
word at all with respect to the
Nixon administration — the
poetry of the ethical crisis
exposed by the investigations
seem far better appreciated by
turning to the Ring than to the
avalanche of media

post-mortemizing. This, then, is a
look at an operatic Watergate.
(My quotations, rendered without
lineation, are from William Mann's
translation of the Ring.)
We must open with a
consideration of the troubled
administration of Wotan, ruler of
the gods in Valhalla. Hie facts are
relatively simple: In order to
acquire the summit of power (the
fortress of Valhall) Wotan has on
the advice of his legal expert Loge
contracted to give the builders of
the fortress his wife's sister Freia
(symbol of love and, by
extension, Wotan's own
humanity). Now in possession of
the fortress, he wishes to renege.
In the meantime Wotan leams
of Alberich, who with a magic
ring forged from stolen gold,
threatens his supreme power.
Wotan again confides with Loge,
who advises theft of the ring and
giving it to the builders as
satisfaction. The builders agree,
and the first opera ends with the
gods walking across the rainbow
bridge to Valhalla.
Character Parallels
Enough, then, of the plot. The
parallels are clear: Wotan (Richard
Nixon) acquires the ultimate
status symbol of power Valhalla
(the Oval Office) through the
cunning and unethical advice of
Loge (Haldeman, Ehrlichman,
Mitchell, or whoever) by
committing theft (the
CRP-associated felonies of 1972),
and paying for Valhalla with what
Wotan himself calls "dirty
money" (illegal campaign
contributions, laundered money).
Other figures, too, are
strikingly similar to members of
the Watergate cast. Alberich
resembles nothing so much as a
second-rate urban political boss
with empire-building notions. The
grasping dwarf, imperiously
flashing his newly forged ring,
shows how easily political power
attracts gold. For him, like sc
many fund-raisers, the ring is an
instrument of extortion.
Then there is Mime, Alberich's
CRPy brother and head of his

dirty tricks department. It is
Mime who forges the Tamhelm
which enables its wearer to
become invisible. And we have
lately learned that invisiblity isalso
necessary to power-dealers as
money. A Tarnhelm would have
been most helpful to the Jaurglars,
buggers, and money-launderers.
Trusting, Not Too Bright
Siegmund is Wotan's son and,
it seems to me, represents the
public in this political allegory.
Like the American public,
Siegmund is a good-hearted sort,
exceptionally trusting, and not
exceptionally bright. But Wotan,
concerned first with the problems
of his administration, is forced by
circumstances to shatter
Siegmund's sword in the heat of
battle. The betrayal is fatal; once
again Wotan's solemn oath is
broken.
Now what has led Wotan to
such a performance? His brutally
candid wife Fricka (who, but for
the lack of a telephone system in
Valhalla, would be a dead ringer
for Martha Mitchell) has the
answer: "Harsh men. What do you
hold sacred and valuable when
you hanker after power?" The
answer is: almost nothing. His
thoughts are only of "defenses
and ramparts: dominion and
power."
Wotan covets power but is not

himself clever enough to acquire
it. For help he looks, with the
kind of ill judgment of character
Nixon has so often demonstrated,
to Loge, the wily god of fire. Loge
is a fascinating figure who has no
discernible beliefs, but only whim
to explain his actions. What
Goldwater has said of Ehrlichman
and Haldeman — that their
political beliefs ran neither to left
nor right but only to ower — is
true of Loge.
Loge As Lawyer
His exquisitely self-serving
discrimination of words, his
imperious way of handling the
gods' contractual problems, and
his personal detachment from the
implications of his advice all mark
Loge as a lawyer — and the kind
of lawyer that the Watergate
investigation has flushed out at
every turn.
And what is frightening about
Loge and these men is that they
were smarter than their master. In
his last words Loge looks upon
the gods he has by trickery lifted
to power. And he wonders:
TTiey are hurrying to their end
though strong and enduring
they think themselves. I am
almost ashamed to collaborate
with them. Into flickering
flame to transform myself back.
I am strongly tempted. To

bum them up who once tamed
me, and not with them blindly
and stupidly to pass away —
godliest gods though they be —
seems to me by no means
foolish. I will think it over.
Who knows what I may do?
How many counselors, underlings,
spokesman are there in our capital
who serve men whose reputations
are as shaky as Wotan's on the
inside while so strong-seeming
from without? Spiro Agnew has
shown us we may well wonder.
So it is from Loge's advice that
troubles spring. Wotan thinks that
once inside Valhalla he can be safe
from "terror and dread," but he
finds on the contrary that his
iniquity has set in motion the
process of his downfall.
As the Ring unwinds, the
moral vacuity of Wotan's power
begins to show. Alberich puts the
matter in no uncertain terms,
calling Wotan a hypocrite. And he
adds ominously that while he has,
as the original thief of the Rhine
gold which made the ring,
wronged only himself, Wotan in
his crime and as god-head has
wronged "everything, past,
present, and future."
Even all-knowing Earth
Mother Erda announces (with the
self-assurance of an investigative
reporter) to Wotan that "You are
not what you call yourself." The
days of the gods are numbered.

COUNSELOR — Loge, the god of fire, is among those who counsel
Wotan, king of the gods, to corruption and immoral acts in Wagner's
operatic tetralogy The Ring of the Nibelungs. The parallels between
the characters in act one of the Ring and those of the Watergate
scandal are tempting at least.
(First of two parts)
The real meaning of the
Watergate affair.. .. How many
preambles such as this have we
read in recent months. Each
commentator has his own more or
less morbid angle on the amazing
tale of political corruption. I
would not be offering yet
another, except that the facts of
the Watergate strike me as
extraordinarily similar to — and
illuminated by — perhaps the
greatest allegory of political
corruption ever created.
I refer to Richard Wagner's The
Ring of the Nibelungs, the
immesne operatic tetralogy which
traces the decline of the race of
gods and their leader Wotan.
Over the century Wagner's
Ring has been subjected to many
allegorical interpretations: G.B.
Shaw very early on produced a
rousing marxist-socialist version;
equally striking Freudian and
Jungian views have since come to
light. It is a measure of this work's
greatness that it can sustain such
varied explanations.
But one level of Wagner's
masterpiece seems to have been
slighted, and that is its anatomy
of political corruption. Toward
the end of the summer's
Watergate investigations I had the
chance to attend an English
version of the Ring performed by
the Sadlers Wells company in
London. What with the
immediacy of current events, the
English translation, and the
brilliant production, the relevance
of the Ring to Watergate slowly
dawned. The moment is ripe for a
look at a fictional Watergate now
that the factual one is largely
before us.
An Operatic Watergate
In fact, the depth, the
awfulness and — if one can use the
word at all with respect to the
Nixon administration — the
poetry of the ethical crisis
exposed by the investigations
seem far better appreciated by
turning to the Ring than to the
avalanche of media

post-mortemizing. This, then, is a
look at an operatic Watergate.
(My quotations, rendered without
lineation, are from William Mann's
translation of the Ring.)
We must open with a
consideration of the troubled
administration of Wotan, ruler of
the gods in Valhalla. Hie facts are
relatively simple: In order to
acquire the summit of power (the
fortress of Valhall) Wotan has on
the advice of his legal expert Loge
contracted to give the builders of
the fortress his wife's sister Freia
(symbol of love and, by
extension, Wotan's own
humanity). Now in possession of
the fortress, he wishes to renege.
In the meantime Wotan leams
of Alberich, who with a magic
ring forged from stolen gold,
threatens his supreme power.
Wotan again confides with Loge,
who advises theft of the ring and
giving it to the builders as
satisfaction. The builders agree,
and the first opera ends with the
gods walking across the rainbow
bridge to Valhalla.
Character Parallels
Enough, then, of the plot. The
parallels are clear: Wotan (Richard
Nixon) acquires the ultimate
status symbol of power Valhalla
(the Oval Office) through the
cunning and unethical advice of
Loge (Haldeman, Ehrlichman,
Mitchell, or whoever) by
committing theft (the
CRP-associated felonies of 1972),
and paying for Valhalla with what
Wotan himself calls "dirty
money" (illegal campaign
contributions, laundered money).
Other figures, too, are
strikingly similar to members of
the Watergate cast. Alberich
resembles nothing so much as a
second-rate urban political boss
with empire-building notions. The
grasping dwarf, imperiously
flashing his newly forged ring,
shows how easily political power
attracts gold. For him, like sc
many fund-raisers, the ring is an
instrument of extortion.
Then there is Mime, Alberich's
CRPy brother and head of his

dirty tricks department. It is
Mime who forges the Tamhelm
which enables its wearer to
become invisible. And we have
lately learned that invisiblity isalso
necessary to power-dealers as
money. A Tarnhelm would have
been most helpful to the Jaurglars,
buggers, and money-launderers.
Trusting, Not Too Bright
Siegmund is Wotan's son and,
it seems to me, represents the
public in this political allegory.
Like the American public,
Siegmund is a good-hearted sort,
exceptionally trusting, and not
exceptionally bright. But Wotan,
concerned first with the problems
of his administration, is forced by
circumstances to shatter
Siegmund's sword in the heat of
battle. The betrayal is fatal; once
again Wotan's solemn oath is
broken.
Now what has led Wotan to
such a performance? His brutally
candid wife Fricka (who, but for
the lack of a telephone system in
Valhalla, would be a dead ringer
for Martha Mitchell) has the
answer: "Harsh men. What do you
hold sacred and valuable when
you hanker after power?" The
answer is: almost nothing. His
thoughts are only of "defenses
and ramparts: dominion and
power."
Wotan covets power but is not

himself clever enough to acquire
it. For help he looks, with the
kind of ill judgment of character
Nixon has so often demonstrated,
to Loge, the wily god of fire. Loge
is a fascinating figure who has no
discernible beliefs, but only whim
to explain his actions. What
Goldwater has said of Ehrlichman
and Haldeman — that their
political beliefs ran neither to left
nor right but only to ower — is
true of Loge.
Loge As Lawyer
His exquisitely self-serving
discrimination of words, his
imperious way of handling the
gods' contractual problems, and
his personal detachment from the
implications of his advice all mark
Loge as a lawyer — and the kind
of lawyer that the Watergate
investigation has flushed out at
every turn.
And what is frightening about
Loge and these men is that they
were smarter than their master. In
his last words Loge looks upon
the gods he has by trickery lifted
to power. And he wonders:
TTiey are hurrying to their end
though strong and enduring
they think themselves. I am
almost ashamed to collaborate
with them. Into flickering
flame to transform myself back.
I am strongly tempted. To

bum them up who once tamed
me, and not with them blindly
and stupidly to pass away —
godliest gods though they be —
seems to me by no means
foolish. I will think it over.
Who knows what I may do?
How many counselors, underlings,
spokesman are there in our capital
who serve men whose reputations
are as shaky as Wotan's on the
inside while so strong-seeming
from without? Spiro Agnew has
shown us we may well wonder.
So it is from Loge's advice that
troubles spring. Wotan thinks that
once inside Valhalla he can be safe
from "terror and dread," but he
finds on the contrary that his
iniquity has set in motion the
process of his downfall.
As the Ring unwinds, the
moral vacuity of Wotan's power
begins to show. Alberich puts the
matter in no uncertain terms,
calling Wotan a hypocrite. And he
adds ominously that while he has,
as the original thief of the Rhine

of lawyer that the Watergate
investigation has flushed out at
every turn.
And what is frightening about
Loge and these men is that they
were smarter than their master. In
his last words Loge looks upon
the gods he has by trickery lifted
to power. And he wonders:
TTiey are hurrying to their end
though strong and enduring
they think themselves. I am
almost ashamed to collaborate
with them. Into flickering
flame to transform myself back.
I am strongly tempted. To

bum them up who once tamed
me, and not with them blindly
and stupidly to pass away —
godliest gods though they be —
seems to me by no means
foolish. I will think it over.
Who knows what I may do?
How many counselors, underlings,
spokesman are there in our capital
who serve men whose reputations
are as shaky as Wotan's on the
inside while so strong-seeming
from without? Spiro Agnew has
shown us we may well wonder.
So it is from Loge's advice that
troubles spring. Wotan thinks that
once inside Valhalla he can be safe
from "terror and dread," but he
finds on the contrary that his
iniquity has set in motion the
process of his downfall.
As the Ring unwinds, the
moral vacuity of Wotan's power
begins to show. Alberich puts the
matter in no uncertain terms,
calling Wotan a hypocrite. And he
adds ominously that while he has,
as the original thief of the Rhine
gold which made the ring,
wronged only himself, Wotan in
his crime and as god-head has
wronged "everything, past,
present, and future."
Even all-knowing Earth
Mother Erda announces (with the
self-assurance of an investigative
reporter) to Wotan that "You are
not what you call yourself." The
days of the gods are numbered.

COUNSELOR — Loge, the god of fire, is among those who counsel
Wotan, king of the gods, to corruption and immoral acts in Wagner's
operatic tetralogy The Ring of the Nibelungs. The parallels between
the characters in act one of the Ring and those of the Watergate
scandal are tempting at least.
(First of two parts)
The real meaning of the
Watergate affair.. .. How many
preambles such as this have we
read in recent months. Each
commentator has his own more or
less morbid angle on the amazing
tale of political corruption. I
would not be offering yet
another, except that the facts of
the Watergate strike me as
extraordinarily similar to — and
illuminated by — perhaps the
greatest allegory of political
corruption ever created.
I refer to Richard Wagner's The
Ring of the Nibelungs, the
immesne operatic tetralogy which
traces the decline of the race of
gods and their leader Wotan.
Over the century Wagner's
Ring has been subjected to many
allegorical interpretations: G.B.
Shaw very early on produced a
rousing marxist-socialist version;
equally striking Freudian and
Jungian views have since come to
light. It is a measure of this work's
greatness that it can sustain such
varied explanations.
But one level of Wagner's
masterpiece seems to have been
slighted, and that is its anatomy
of political corruption. Toward
the end of the summer's
Watergate investigations I had the
chance to attend an English
version of the Ring performed by
the Sadlers Wells company in
London. What with the
immediacy of current events, the
English translation, and the
brilliant production, the relevance
of the Ring to Watergate slowly
dawned. The moment is ripe for a
look at a fictional Watergate now
that the factual one is largely
before us.
An Operatic Watergate
In fact, the depth, the
awfulness and — if one can use the
word at all with respect to the
Nixon administration — the
poetry of the ethical crisis
exposed by the investigations
seem far better appreciated by
turning to the Ring than to the
avalanche of media

post-mortemizing. This, then, is a
look at an operatic Watergate.
(My quotations, rendered without
lineation, are from William Mann's
translation of the Ring.)
We must open with a
consideration of the troubled
administration of Wotan, ruler of
the gods in Valhalla. Hie facts are
relatively simple: In order to
acquire the summit of power (the
fortress of Valhall) Wotan has on
the advice of his legal expert Loge
contracted to give the builders of
the fortress his wife's sister Freia
(symbol of love and, by
extension, Wotan's own
humanity). Now in possession of
the fortress, he wishes to renege.
In the meantime Wotan leams
of Alberich, who with a magic
ring forged from stolen gold,
threatens his supreme power.
Wotan again confides with Loge,
who advises theft of the ring and
giving it to the builders as
satisfaction. The builders agree,
and the first opera ends with the
gods walking across the rainbow
bridge to Valhalla.
Character Parallels
Enough, then, of the plot. The
parallels are clear: Wotan (Richard
Nixon) acquires the ultimate
status symbol of power Valhalla
(the Oval Office) through the
cunning and unethical advice of
Loge (Haldeman, Ehrlichman,
Mitchell, or whoever) by
committing theft (the
CRP-associated felonies of 1972),
and paying for Valhalla with what
Wotan himself calls "dirty
money" (illegal campaign
contributions, laundered money).
Other figures, too, are
strikingly similar to members of
the Watergate cast. Alberich
resembles nothing so much as a
second-rate urban political boss
with empire-building notions. The
grasping dwarf, imperiously
flashing his newly forged ring,
shows how easily political power
attracts gold. For him, like sc
many fund-raisers, the ring is an
instrument of extortion.
Then there is Mime, Alberich's
CRPy brother and head of his

dirty tricks department. It is
Mime who forges the Tamhelm
which enables its wearer to
become invisible. And we have
lately learned that invisiblity isalso
necessary to power-dealers as
money. A Tarnhelm would have
been most helpful to the Jaurglars,
buggers, and money-launderers.
Trusting, Not Too Bright
Siegmund is Wotan's son and,
it seems to me, represents the
public in this political allegory.
Like the American public,
Siegmund is a good-hearted sort,
exceptionally trusting, and not
exceptionally bright. But Wotan,
concerned first with the problems
of his administration, is forced by
circumstances to shatter
Siegmund's sword in the heat of
battle. The betrayal is fatal; once
again Wotan's solemn oath is
broken.
Now what has led Wotan to
such a performance? His brutally
candid wife Fricka (who, but for
the lack of a telephone system in
Valhalla, would be a dead ringer
for Martha Mitchell) has the
answer: "Harsh men. What do you
hold sacred and valuable when
you hanker after power?" The
answer is: almost nothing. His
thoughts are only of "defenses
and ramparts: dominion and
power."
Wotan covets power but is not

himself clever enough to acquire
it. For help he looks, with the
kind of ill judgment of character
Nixon has so often demonstrated,
to Loge, the wily god of fire. Loge
is a fascinating figure who has no
discernible beliefs, but only whim
to explain his actions. What
Goldwater has said of Ehrlichman
and Haldeman — that their
political beliefs ran neither to left
nor right but only to ower — is
true of Loge.
Loge As Lawyer
His exquisitely self-serving
discrimination of words, his
imperious way of handling the
gods' contractual problems, and
his personal detachment from the
implications of his advice all mark
Loge as a lawyer — and the kind
of lawyer that the Watergate
investigation has flushed out at
every turn.
And what is frightening about
Loge and these men is that they
were smarter than their master. In
his last words Loge looks upon
the gods he has by trickery lifted
to power. And he wonders:
TTiey are hurrying to their end

again Wotan's solemn oath is
broken.
Now what has led Wotan to
such a performance? His brutally
candid wife Fricka (who, but for
the lack of a telephone system in
Valhalla, would be a dead ringer
for Martha Mitchell) has the
answer: "Harsh men. What do you
hold sacred and valuable when
you hanker after power?" The
answer is: almost nothing. His
thoughts are only of "defenses
and ramparts: dominion and
power."
Wotan covets power but is not

himself clever enough to acquire
it. For help he looks, with the
kind of ill judgment of character
Nixon has so often demonstrated,
to Loge, the wily god of fire. Loge
is a fascinating figure who has no
discernible beliefs, but only whim
to explain his actions. What
Goldwater has said of Ehrlichman
and Haldeman — that their
political beliefs ran neither to left
nor right but only to ower — is
true of Loge.
Loge As Lawyer
His exquisitely self-serving
discrimination of words, his
imperious way of handling the
gods' contractual problems, and
his personal detachment from the
implications of his advice all mark
Loge as a lawyer — and the kind
of lawyer that the Watergate
investigation has flushed out at
every turn.
And what is frightening about
Loge and these men is that they
were smarter than their master. In
his last words Loge looks upon
the gods he has by trickery lifted
to power. And he wonders:
TTiey are hurrying to their end
though strong and enduring
they think themselves. I am
almost ashamed to collaborate
with them. Into flickering
flame to transform myself back.
I am strongly tempted. To

bum them up who once tamed
me, and not with them blindly
and stupidly to pass away —
godliest gods though they be —
seems to me by no means
foolish. I will think it over.
Who knows what I may do?
How many counselors, underlings,
spokesman are there in our capital
who serve men whose reputations
are as shaky as Wotan's on the
inside while so strong-seeming
from without? Spiro Agnew has
shown us we may well wonder.
So it is from Loge's advice that
troubles spring. Wotan thinks that
once inside Valhalla he can be safe
from "terror and dread," but he
finds on the contrary that his
iniquity has set in motion the
process of his downfall.
As the Ring unwinds, the
moral vacuity of Wotan's power
begins to show. Alberich puts the
matter in no uncertain terms,
calling Wotan a hypocrite. And he
adds ominously that while he has,
as the original thief of the Rhine
gold which made the ring,
wronged only himself, Wotan in
his crime and as god-head has
wronged "everything, past,
present, and future."
Even all-knowing Earth
Mother Erda announces (with the
self-assurance of an investigative
reporter) to Wotan that "You are
not what you call yourself." The
days of the gods are numbered.

COUNSELOR — Loge, the god of fire, is among those who counsel
Wotan, king of the gods, to corruption and immoral acts in Wagner's
operatic tetralogy The Ring of the Nibelungs. The parallels between
the characters in act one of the Ring and those of the Watergate
scandal are tempting at least.
(First of two parts)
The real meaning of the
Watergate affair.. .. How many
preambles such as this have we
read in recent months. Each
commentator has his own more or
less morbid angle on the amazing
tale of political corruption. I
would not be offering yet
another, except that the facts of
the Watergate strike me as
extraordinarily similar to — and
illuminated by — perhaps the
greatest allegory of political
corruption ever created.
I refer to Richard Wagner's The
Ring of the Nibelungs, the
immesne operatic tetralogy which
traces the decline of the race of
gods and their leader Wotan.
Over the century Wagner's
Ring has been subjected to many
allegorical interpretations: G.B.
Shaw very early on produced a
rousing marxist-socialist version;
equally striking Freudian and
Jungian views have since come to
light. It is a measure of this work's
greatness that it can sustain such
varied explanations.
But one level of Wagner's
masterpiece seems to have been
slighted, and that is its anatomy
of political corruption. Toward
the end of the summer's
Watergate investigations I had the
chance to attend an English
version of the Ring performed by
the Sadlers Wells company in
London. What with the
immediacy of current events, the
English translation, and the
brilliant production, the relevance
of the Ring to Watergate slowly
dawned. The moment is ripe for a
look at a fictional Watergate now
that the factual one is largely
before us.
An Operatic Watergate
In fact, the depth, the
awfulness and — if one can use the
word at all with respect to the
Nixon administration — the
poetry of the ethical crisis
exposed by the investigations
seem far better appreciated by
turning to the Ring than to the
avalanche of media

post-mortemizing. This, then, is a
look at an operatic Watergate.
(My quotations, rendered without
lineation, are from William Mann's
translation of the Ring.)
We must open with a
consideration of the troubled
administration of Wotan, ruler of
the gods in Valhalla. Hie facts are
relatively simple: In order to
acquire the summit of power (the
fortress of Valhall) Wotan has on
the advice of his legal expert Loge
contracted to give the builders of
the fortress his wife's sister Freia
(symbol of love and, by
extension, Wotan's own
humanity). Now in possession of
the fortress, he wishes to renege.
In the meantime Wotan leams
of Alberich, who with a magic
ring forged from stolen gold,
threatens his supreme power.
Wotan again confides with Loge,
who advises theft of the ring and
giving it to the builders as
satisfaction. The builders agree,
and the first opera ends with the
gods walking across the rainbow
bridge to Valhalla.
Character Parallels
Enough, then, of the plot. The
parallels are clear: Wotan (Richard
Nixon) acquires the ultimate
status symbol of power Valhalla
(the Oval Office) through the
cunning and unethical advice of
Loge (Haldeman, Ehrlichman,
Mitchell, or whoever) by
committing theft (the
CRP-associated felonies of 1972),
and paying for Valhalla with what
Wotan himself calls "dirty
money" (illegal campaign
contributions, laundered money).
Other figures, too, are
strikingly similar to members of
the Watergate cast. Alberich
resembles nothing so much as a
second-rate urban political boss
with empire-building notions. The
grasping dwarf, imperiously
flashing his newly forged ring,
shows how easily political power
attracts gold. For him, like sc
many fund-raisers, the ring is an
instrument of extortion.
Then there is Mime, Alberich's
CRPy brother and head of his

dirty tricks department. It is
Mime who forges the Tamhelm
which enables its wearer to
become invisible. And we have
lately learned that invisiblity isalso
necessary to power-dealers as
money. A Tarnhelm would have
been most helpful to the Jaurglars,
buggers, and money-launderers.
Trusting, Not Too Bright
Siegmund is Wotan's son and,
it seems to me, represents the
public in this political allegory.
Like the American public,
Siegmund is a good-hearted sort,
exceptionally trusting, and not
exceptionally bright. But Wotan,
concerned first with the problems
of his administration, is forced by
circumstances to shatter
Siegmund's sword in the heat of
battle. The betrayal is fatal; once
again Wotan's solemn oath is
broken.
Now what has led Wotan to
such a performance? His brutally
candid wife Fricka (who, but for
the lack of a telephone system in
Valhalla, would be a dead ringer
