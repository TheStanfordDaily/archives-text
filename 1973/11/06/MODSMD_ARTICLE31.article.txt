# Sidemen Add Strength To Ringo's New Solo Disc
## 
### 
Ringo Starr, Ringo
Apple Records
Most recent in the trend of
soloist-with-backup albums is the
new one by Ringo Starr, entitled
Ringo. The list of session men is
impressive — three ex-Beatles, the
Band, Billy Preston, Nicky
Hopkins, Nilsson, Marc Bolan, Jim
Keltner, Klaus Voorman, David
Bromberg, Martha Reeves, Merry
Clayton, Steve Cropper, Jack
Nitzche and last year's producer
of the year, Richard Perry.
This is simply the best record
Ringo has ever made. He displays
new found writing abilities with
the aid of co-authors George
Harrison and Vini Poncia.
The songs themselves are cute.
None stand out as particularly
brilliant, nor do any have the
distinction of being failures. What
they lack in versatility, they more
than compensate in execution.
Ringo's happy-go-lucky vocals
are perfectly matched with Tom
Scott's horn arrangements, Jack
Nitzche's orchestrations, and the
supportive roles of those
million-dollar session men.
The packaging is guaranteed to
make you feel nostalgic, as we are
presented with yet another
variation of the Sergeant Pepper

motif. You will find
characterizations of everyone who
plays on the album, as well as
such stalwarts as Frankenstein,
Yoko, the Mummy, Humpty
Dumpty, dogs, babies, and all
those other wonders which make
daily living enjoyable.
This is a record made for all of
us, for I have yet to meet a person
who didn't derive pleasure from
memories.
—William Vigil
