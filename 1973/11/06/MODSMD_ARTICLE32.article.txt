# Coffee House Features New Decor
## 
### JANET SWANBERG 
Did you know that you can
now enjoy a Taimarindo or Orgeat
soda on the rocks at the Stanford
Community Coffee House?
Recently enlarged and
remodeled, the Coffee House,
located in Tresidder Union, has a
new and classier decor. Over the
summer, designers Bonnie Koehler
and Nick Corff transformed the
previous dingy barn-like
atmosphere into a gracious and
attractive community center.
They retiled the ceiling,
revamished the hatch cover tables,
and removed the overhead
florescent lighting.
Structural modifications
included the replacement of a wall
and removal of three billiard
tables from the neighboring
billiard room. The former wall
booths which promoted austere
seclusion rather than peaceful
privacy were moved across the
room to a more open and
appealing spot. Hanging plants
and campus notices are now
scattered around the room and
the total effect is comfortable and
inviting.

One of the main purposes of
the renovation was to make the
Tresidder bowling alley more
appealing. Bowlers can now
purchase food and drinks without
removing their bowling shoes
because the alley and the Coffee
House are now connected.
More Business
While last year's Coffee House
struggled financially, the new
renovations have apparently
encouraged business. Weekend
evenings are crowded and business
during the afternoon hours has
grown considerably.
The new decor attracts a
quieter, more mellow crowd,
including a greater percentage of
faculty, staff, and graduate
students. The ever-popular
computerized Galaxy game still
lures and intrigues the clientele.
The majority of student
reaction has been favorable. One
student described the new
environment as a "comfortable
relaxing place to spend time with
a few friends," and another
student said, "I could even bring
my parents here." However, one

client called the new Coffee
House "sterile" and longed for
"the good old days when anyone
could bang out anything on the
old piano and be accepted under
the title of being cool."
Varied Menu, Entertainment
Open from 11 a.m.-l a.m. on
weekdays and noon-1 a.m. on
weekends, the Coffee House
offers exotic Italian sodas,
moderately priced sandwiches,
pastries, Armenian halvah, Black
Muslim carrot cakes, and a variety
of coffees and warm drinks.
The Coffee House has already
offered some live entertainment,
and has plans for more. The old
raised stage was removed, but live
performances can be presented
from either end of the floor,
according to manager Ken
Bru baker.
He also plans to increase the
variety of food offered, and hopes
that the "changes in the Coffee
House will contribute to a
friendlier, more open common
meeting place for the diverse
members of the Stanford
community."

relaxing place to spend time with
a few friends," and another
student said, "I could even bring
my parents here." However, one

client called the new Coffee
House "sterile" and longed for
"the good old days when anyone
could bang out anything on the
old piano and be accepted under
the title of being cool."
Varied Menu, Entertainment
Open from 11 a.m.-l a.m. on
weekdays and noon-1 a.m. on
weekends, the Coffee House
offers exotic Italian sodas,
moderately priced sandwiches,
pastries, Armenian halvah, Black
Muslim carrot cakes, and a variety
of coffees and warm drinks.
The Coffee House has already
offered some live entertainment,
and has plans for more. The old
raised stage was removed, but live
performances can be presented
from either end of the floor,
according to manager Ken
Bru baker.
He also plans to increase the
variety of food offered, and hopes
that the "changes in the Coffee
House will contribute to a
friendlier, more open common
meeting place for the diverse
members of the Stanford
community."
Did you know that you can
now enjoy a Taimarindo or Orgeat
soda on the rocks at the Stanford
Community Coffee House?
Recently enlarged and
remodeled, the Coffee House,
located in Tresidder Union, has a
new and classier decor. Over the
summer, designers Bonnie Koehler
and Nick Corff transformed the
previous dingy barn-like
atmosphere into a gracious and
attractive community center.
They retiled the ceiling,
revamished the hatch cover tables,
and removed the overhead
florescent lighting.
Structural modifications
included the replacement of a wall
and removal of three billiard
tables from the neighboring
billiard room. The former wall
booths which promoted austere
seclusion rather than peaceful
privacy were moved across the
room to a more open and
appealing spot. Hanging plants
and campus notices are now
scattered around the room and
the total effect is comfortable and
inviting.

One of the main purposes of
the renovation was to make the
Tresidder bowling alley more
appealing. Bowlers can now
purchase food and drinks without
removing their bowling shoes
because the alley and the Coffee
House are now connected.
More Business
While last year's Coffee House
struggled financially, the new
renovations have apparently
encouraged business. Weekend
evenings are crowded and business
during the afternoon hours has
grown considerably.
The new decor attracts a
quieter, more mellow crowd,
including a greater percentage of
faculty, staff, and graduate
students. The ever-popular
computerized Galaxy game still
lures and intrigues the clientele.
The majority of student
reaction has been favorable. One
student described the new
environment as a "comfortable
relaxing place to spend time with
a few friends," and another
student said, "I could even bring
my parents here." However, one

client called the new Coffee
