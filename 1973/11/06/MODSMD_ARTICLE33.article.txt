Segretti Sentenced To Six Months
WASHINGTON — Political saboteur Donald H. Segretti
was sentenced yesterday to serve six months in a
minimum security institution for violating federal laws in
the 1972 election campaign.
Segretti, who was financed by Nixon campaign funds,
had pleaded guilty Oct. 1 to three federal misdemeanor
counts arising from his activity in last year's Democratic
presidential primary in Florida.
U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard A Gesell sentenced
Segretti to serve three years consecutively but suspended
the sentence on the condition that the 32-year-old
California lawyer spend six months in a minimum security
prison.
Hie judge called it a split sentence on the three
misdemeanor counts. Both the government and Segretti's
lawyer had asked postponement of sentencing, but the
judge said he would not do that.
"I really regret I got involved in this," said Segretti.
He was charged with conspiracy and distributing
campaign literature which did not identify the
organization or the individual responsible for it. The
indictment was handed down in Tampa, Fla.
One of the items Segretti arranged to have distributed
during the Florida primary was a letter on campaign
stationery of Sen. Edmund S. Muskie, D-Maine, which
accused two other Democratic presidential contenders,
Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota and Henry M.
Jackson of Washington, of sexual misconduct.
Another item was a card distributed at a rally for
Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace that read, "If you liked
Hitler, youH love Wallace ... Vote for Muskie."
Maximum penalty for each of the three misdemeanor
counts is a year in prison and a $1,000 fine.
Senators Praise Ford
WASHINGTON — Vice President-designate Gerald R.
Ford completed his testimony before the Senate Rules
Committee yesterday with no sign of any hitch developing
oil his confirmation as Spiro T. Agnew's successor.
Ford won praise from the senators for his answers in
two days of questioning on a broad range of subjects,
many of them dealing with how he would act if he
became President.
He was questioned again about his relationship with
Robert N. Winter-Berger, a former Washington lobbyist
who has written a book he calls "an insider's view of
corruption in Washington.
The book contains numerous references to Ford. Ford,
who told the committee previously he was "duped" by
Winter-Berger, denied all allegations of wrongdoing cited
in the book.
"It is a completely inaccurate, demagogic bunch of
words that, in my opinion, don't deserve publication,"
Ford said.
Most of the final round of questioning, however, dealt
with Ford's views of the office of President and his
positions on various issues.
"We are talking to you as a potential president, not in
your capacity as vice president," said Sen. Claiborne Pell,
D-R.I.
Ford said in order to lead a president has to have broad

public support for his policies and the public's confidence
in his moral and ethical standards.
"He has to be a person of great truthfulness, and the
American people have to believe he is truthful,"Ford said.
Oil Squeeze Hits Europe
BRUSSELS — Common Market foreign ministers met
yesterday to discuss the Arab squeeze on their oil
supplies, particularly the boycott against the Netherlands.
The market countries get about 80 percent of their oil
from the Arabs. This has been reduced by about 15
percent. It was likely to be reduced further by new Arab
oil production cuts of about one million barrels a day.
Qualified oil sources in Kuwait gave the million-barrel
estimate after Arab oil exporters announced Monday they
were bringing the total amount of their production cut to
a minimum 25 percent, including embargoes of oil
shipments to the United States and the Netherlands.
Prior to yesterday's decision, the sources said Arab oil
cuts had reached about 20 percent.
Rockets Mar Viet Cease-Fire
SAIGON — Dozens of Soviet-built rockets slammed
into Bien Hoa air base near Saigon early this morning for
the first time since the Vietnam cease-fire, the Saigon
command reported.
It said two F5 jet fighter-bombers were destroyed and
two others damaged in the attack on the base and on the
nearby 3rd Military Region headquarters.
The command said one home in a nearby military
dependents' camp also was destroyed.
Initial reports indicated that one soldier was killed and
nine persons were wounded.
The Saigon command said 27 rockets were fired, but
military sources in Bien Hoa put the number at more than
50.
The air base, 15 miles from the capital, is the largest in
South Vietnam. Most of the country's best jet
fighter-bombers are based there.
Steelers Top Redskins, 21 —16
PITTSBURGH — Pittsburgh quarterback Terry
Hanratty fired a pair of touchdown passes before being
sidelined with a rib injury in the third quarter and the
Steelers hung on to beat the Washington Redskins 21-16
last night in a National Football League game.
Weather Takes Turn For Worse
SAN FRANCISCO — Indian summer vanished in a
blast of heavy weather yesterday with wind and rain
charging across most of Northern California and thick
snow in the mountains.
The rough gusts and downpour made traveling
hazardous in many areas. The weather is expected to
improve only slightly today and could have an effect on
voter turnout in today's election.
Gale warnings were posted in the San Francisco Bay
area yesterday for south to southeast winds 20 to 45 miles
per hour becoming southerly and slower by this morning.
Chance of rain is 70 percent today and 60 percent
tonight.

Segretti Sentenced To Six Months
WASHINGTON — Political saboteur Donald H. Segretti
was sentenced yesterday to serve six months in a
minimum security institution for violating federal laws in
the 1972 election campaign.
Segretti, who was financed by Nixon campaign funds,
had pleaded guilty Oct. 1 to three federal misdemeanor
counts arising from his activity in last year's Democratic
presidential primary in Florida.
U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard A Gesell sentenced
Segretti to serve three years consecutively but suspended
the sentence on the condition that the 32-year-old
California lawyer spend six months in a minimum security
prison.
Hie judge called it a split sentence on the three
misdemeanor counts. Both the government and Segretti's
lawyer had asked postponement of sentencing, but the
judge said he would not do that.
"I really regret I got involved in this," said Segretti.
He was charged with conspiracy and distributing
campaign literature which did not identify the
organization or the individual responsible for it. The
indictment was handed down in Tampa, Fla.
One of the items Segretti arranged to have distributed
during the Florida primary was a letter on campaign
stationery of Sen. Edmund S. Muskie, D-Maine, which
accused two other Democratic presidential contenders,
Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota and Henry M.
Jackson of Washington, of sexual misconduct.
Another item was a card distributed at a rally for
Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace that read, "If you liked
Hitler, youH love Wallace ... Vote for Muskie."
Maximum penalty for each of the three misdemeanor
counts is a year in prison and a $1,000 fine.
Senators Praise Ford
WASHINGTON — Vice President-designate Gerald R.
Ford completed his testimony before the Senate Rules
Committee yesterday with no sign of any hitch developing
oil his confirmation as Spiro T. Agnew's successor.
Ford won praise from the senators for his answers in
two days of questioning on a broad range of subjects,
many of them dealing with how he would act if he
became President.
He was questioned again about his relationship with
Robert N. Winter-Berger, a former Washington lobbyist
who has written a book he calls "an insider's view of
corruption in Washington.
The book contains numerous references to Ford. Ford,
who told the committee previously he was "duped" by
Winter-Berger, denied all allegations of wrongdoing cited
in the book.
"It is a completely inaccurate, demagogic bunch of
words that, in my opinion, don't deserve publication,"
Ford said.
Most of the final round of questioning, however, dealt
with Ford's views of the office of President and his
positions on various issues.
"We are talking to you as a potential president, not in
your capacity as vice president," said Sen. Claiborne Pell,
D-R.I.
Ford said in order to lead a president has to have broad

public support for his policies and the public's confidence
in his moral and ethical standards.
"He has to be a person of great truthfulness, and the
American people have to believe he is truthful,"Ford said.
Oil Squeeze Hits Europe
BRUSSELS — Common Market foreign ministers met
yesterday to discuss the Arab squeeze on their oil
supplies, particularly the boycott against the Netherlands.
The market countries get about 80 percent of their oil
from the Arabs. This has been reduced by about 15
percent. It was likely to be reduced further by new Arab
oil production cuts of about one million barrels a day.
Qualified oil sources in Kuwait gave the million-barrel
estimate after Arab oil exporters announced Monday they
were bringing the total amount of their production cut to
a minimum 25 percent, including embargoes of oil
shipments to the United States and the Netherlands.
Prior to yesterday's decision, the sources said Arab oil
cuts had reached about 20 percent.
Rockets Mar Viet Cease-Fire
SAIGON — Dozens of Soviet-built rockets slammed
into Bien Hoa air base near Saigon early this morning for
the first time since the Vietnam cease-fire, the Saigon
command reported.
It said two F5 jet fighter-bombers were destroyed and
two others damaged in the attack on the base and on the
nearby 3rd Military Region headquarters.
The command said one home in a nearby military
dependents' camp also was destroyed.
Initial reports indicated that one soldier was killed and
nine persons were wounded.
The Saigon command said 27 rockets were fired, but
military sources in Bien Hoa put the number at more than
50.
The air base, 15 miles from the capital, is the largest in
South Vietnam. Most of the country's best jet
fighter-bombers are based there.

Segretti Sentenced To Six Months
WASHINGTON — Political saboteur Donald H. Segretti
was sentenced yesterday to serve six months in a
minimum security institution for violating federal laws in
the 1972 election campaign.
Segretti, who was financed by Nixon campaign funds,
had pleaded guilty Oct. 1 to three federal misdemeanor
counts arising from his activity in last year's Democratic
presidential primary in Florida.
U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard A Gesell sentenced
Segretti to serve three years consecutively but suspended
the sentence on the condition that the 32-year-old
California lawyer spend six months in a minimum security
prison.
Hie judge called it a split sentence on the three
misdemeanor counts. Both the government and Segretti's
lawyer had asked postponement of sentencing, but the
judge said he would not do that.
"I really regret I got involved in this," said Segretti.
He was charged with conspiracy and distributing
campaign literature which did not identify the
organization or the individual responsible for it. The
indictment was handed down in Tampa, Fla.
One of the items Segretti arranged to have distributed
during the Florida primary was a letter on campaign
stationery of Sen. Edmund S. Muskie, D-Maine, which
accused two other Democratic presidential contenders,
Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota and Henry M.
Jackson of Washington, of sexual misconduct.
Another item was a card distributed at a rally for
Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace that read, "If you liked
Hitler, youH love Wallace ... Vote for Muskie."
Maximum penalty for each of the three misdemeanor
counts is a year in prison and a $1,000 fine.
Senators Praise Ford
WASHINGTON — Vice President-designate Gerald R.
Ford completed his testimony before the Senate Rules
Committee yesterday with no sign of any hitch developing
oil his confirmation as Spiro T. Agnew's successor.
Ford won praise from the senators for his answers in
two days of questioning on a broad range of subjects,
many of them dealing with how he would act if he
became President.
He was questioned again about his relationship with
Robert N. Winter-Berger, a former Washington lobbyist
who has written a book he calls "an insider's view of
corruption in Washington.
The book contains numerous references to Ford. Ford,
who told the committee previously he was "duped" by
Winter-Berger, denied all allegations of wrongdoing cited
in the book.
"It is a completely inaccurate, demagogic bunch of
words that, in my opinion, don't deserve publication,"
Ford said.
Most of the final round of questioning, however, dealt
with Ford's views of the office of President and his
positions on various issues.
"We are talking to you as a potential president, not in
your capacity as vice president," said Sen. Claiborne Pell,
D-R.I.
Ford said in order to lead a president has to have broad

public support for his policies and the public's confidence
in his moral and ethical standards.
"He has to be a person of great truthfulness, and the
American people have to believe he is truthful,"Ford said.
Oil Squeeze Hits Europe
BRUSSELS — Common Market foreign ministers met
yesterday to discuss the Arab squeeze on their oil
supplies, particularly the boycott against the Netherlands.
The market countries get about 80 percent of their oil
from the Arabs. This has been reduced by about 15
percent. It was likely to be reduced further by new Arab
oil production cuts of about one million barrels a day.
Qualified oil sources in Kuwait gave the million-barrel
estimate after Arab oil exporters announced Monday they
were bringing the total amount of their production cut to
a minimum 25 percent, including embargoes of oil
shipments to the United States and the Netherlands.
Prior to yesterday's decision, the sources said Arab oil
cuts had reached about 20 percent.
