# Panelists Urge Impeachment, End To 'Corrupt' System
## 
### MIKE PHILLIPS 
Panelists for a teach-in entitled "Is
Impeachment Enough?" introduced
their program with a replay of
President Nixon's "Checkers Speech"
last night in Cubberley Auditorium
and suggested that the President's
removal is only a first step in
correcting a "corrupt" system.
The panel included Bruce Franklin,
a former Stanford professor fired
following campus riots in 1971; Hal
Holman, a member of the Faculty
Political Action Group; Tom Burk, a
member of the National Lawyer's
Guild; Jay Miller of the American Civil
Liberties Union; and Lise Giraud, a
Stanford librarian.
Holman said that even if Nixon is
impeached, the "politics of
repression" will still remain. He cited
statistics, saying that 50 percent of
those in county jails are "legally
innocent" and that a highly
disproportionate amount of minority
groups fill the prisons.
"The bulk of the people," he said,
"have never experienced their civil
liberties."
Repressive Acts
Outlining a broad range of what he
perceived to be repressive acts,
including U.S. involvement in
Vietnam, tacit American support in
the Chilean coup, and handling of the
Attica prison riots, Holman said that
the present political crisis is only part
of a larger "continuity."
Franklin cautioned the audience,
saying that with Nixon's impeachment
or resignation, the American public
must be careful not to "put another
head on the same body" by allowing
present inequities to continue.
He stated that his own firing from
Stanford was an act of repression
against a person who held views
different from those in power. Citing a

document by the board which fired
him from Stanford, Franklin, a
communist, said he was dismissed
because his perceptions of reality (he
quoted from the document) differed
from those of the board members.
Action At Stanford
"We have to attend to affairs at
Stanford as well as Washington to
rebuild a movement on a much higher
level of consciousness and action," he
concluded.
Giraud said that Nixon was a
president "twisting and turning in the
breeze." She argued that even if he is
impeached, his choice for
vice-president, Congressman Gerald
Ford, would hardly be a fit president
since his chief talent was "warming a
seat in Congress for 25 years."
She also rapped out at Stanford,
saying that dependence on the
government for federal funds and
research grants made the university
too susceptible to government
pressure.

Stanford is also linked to
corruption in the government, she
said, by a trustee, Thomas V. Jones,
who donated at least $50,000 to the
Committee to Re-Elect the President.
"Nixon's demise after 25 years will
be welcomed," she concluded, "but it
won't be a panacea."


CHECKERS REPLAYED A replay of then Vice-Presidential candidate
Richard Nixon s famous "Checkers" television speech preceded a teach-in
entitled "Is Impeachment Enough?" last night at 7:30 in Cubberley. Fired
Assoc. English Prof. H. Bruce Franklin led the panel discussion which advocated
the President s impeachment.
