# University Seeks Hikes In Next Year's Tuition
## 
### JIM WASCHER 
University Administrators will ask
the Board of Trustees to approve a
$240 undergraduate tuition increase
for the 1974-75 school year at next
Tuesday's Board meeting.
Vice Provost for Budget and
Planning Raymond F. Bacchetti
confirmed the plan, which KZSU
News first revealed yesterday.
Although Bacchetti said that the 7.6
percent increase over this year's
tuition bill is "only a recommendation
to the Board of Trustees," easy
approval is expected.
Pointing out that tuition this year is
10 percent higher than it was last year,
Bacchetti said that the Administration
"wanted to bring the tuition increase

rate down as far as we could." Next
year, the total tuition bill for
undergraduates will be $3375.
Bacchetti refused to say how large
the tuition increases for the Graduate
School of Business and the Medical
School would be. He said the
Administration would "postpone the
decision on room and board increases
until later in the year," explaining that
future food costs were "tricky to
predict too far in advance."
Wage Hikes Responsible
According to Bacchetti, salary
increases for both faculty and staff
were more responsible for the tuition
hike than was the skyrocketing cost of
living index.
Rising University costs would have

justified a larger tuition increase than
the one proposed by the
Administration, Bacchetti said. He
added that the lower rate of increase
was "going to create quite a squeeze
on academic programs," although he
did not expect that any would have to
be phased out.
The current year's budget booklet
says, "Tuition and fee rates are
directly related to financial aid policy,
where the University's chief concern is
to assure equity in need assessment
and in the provision of scholarships,
fellowships, loans and employment
opportunities to qualified students."
Bacchetti said that financial aid is
"our highest expenditure priority,
which we augment each year to keep
up with the increased cost of attending
Stanford."
Students Complain
After the Board of Trustees
approved this year's 10 percent tuition
hike, students led by then-ASSU Vice
Presidents Brent Appel and Elaine
Wong complained that the Board had
not received any student input before
approving the increase. Yesterday,
Bacchetti called tuition decisions "a
matter of business between the Board
and the Administration."
Current ASSU Vice President Jim
Friend said last night that the 7.6
percent increase is "not an
irresponsible request." However, he
added that "if we're going to bear the
brunt of tuition increases, we probably
ought to have something to say about
the priorities of the University."
