# Council Considers Drug Program
## 
### BILL ROSS 
The Palo Alto Drug Abuse Board
(PACDAB) must define its political
goals if it is to receive the continued
support of the Palo Alto City Council,
Councilman Byron Sher told PACDAB
staffers at a special Council meeting
last night.
The meeting last night was one in a
series of discussions between PACDAB
and the City Council to determine
whether Palo Alto's $220,000 per year
program is fulfilling the expectations
of the community.
Sher asked members of the
PACDAB staff if it is necessary for
that organization to formulate an
anti-establishment political philosophy
in order to effectively combat drug
abuse. He also asked if the alienation
of the community is justified in order
to attract drug abusers to the program
and sustain the enthusiasm of staff
members.
In explaining a passage in the report
affirming the necessity of political
attitudes in the program, PACDAB
staff members Clare Smith stated, "We
stand in resistance to those ways of
life that offer people no control over
their lives."
Smith argued that drug addiction is
not caused by deviant personality but
rather is a response to unequal social
and economic conditions. As a result,
drug abuse programs must develop a

political attitude, she said.
Council members also queried
PACDAB staff and board members
about the organization's policy of
"collectivism," the unstructured
distribution of responsibility between
board and staff personnel.
Councilman John Berwald stated
that while his main concern is that
PACDAB function effectively, the
Council expects the Board to take
leadership responsibility.
"It is inevitable that you will have
to take us all as a single piece," Agnes
Robinson, board member and
co-author of PACDAB evaluative

report responded. "Those of us who
are not professionals cannot make
judgments about the program without
consulting staff members. I wouldn't
make a unilateral decision even if my
colleagues allowed me to. Staffers
must be treated as intellectual equals
even if they don't have the voting
power."
Robinson told City Council
members that PACDAB's
detoxification center, Hot Line, study
and counseling groups and community
awareness projects have been
successful and she urged the Council
to continue its support.
