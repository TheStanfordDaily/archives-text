# ASSU Senate Urges Tuition Hike Limit
## 
### DENIS CUFF 
An angry ASSU Senate
unanimously passed a resolution last
night urging for a six percent limit on
tuition hikes only hours after
University officials revealed plans to
ask the Trustees for a 7.6 percent
increase.
"We would be shocked and
dismayed if the hike is approved,"

graduate senator Rosemary Killam
said.
Tim Moyer, ASSU senator and a
member of the Board of Trustees'
Committee on Finance, objected to
the proposed increase, but said he
though the Trustees would probably
accept the full hike.
The senate resolution, co-authored
by senators Moyer and Eric Hemel,
urges the University to restrain the
tuition rise "as much as is financially
possible, and under no conditions to
approve a tuition increase greater than
six percent, the forecasted annual rise
in the cost of living."
'Squeezed Out'
"The middle-class student is getting
squeezed out," Moyer said. He
explained tuition was $600 in 1953,
$1200 in 1964 and the one proposed
for 1974-75 is $3375.
He cited the Report on Admissions
and Financial Aids, 1972-73, authored
by experts in the Academic Planning
office, which states "for all but the
professional class, Stanford has
become a less desirable alternative."
Hemel and Moyer criticized the
University's reasoning that the hike
would be acceptable because it is a cut
in the percentage of increase from 10
to 7.6 percent. Hemel said that the 10
percent increase was far too much.
ASSU Vice-President Beth Garfield
said she is trying to arrange a meeting
this week with Raymond Bacchetti,
vice president for budget and planning,
to discuss the hike.
In other action, the Senate
appropriated $500 for the Stanford
chapter of the African Famine Relief
Fund. The money will aid Dave "Big
Daddy" McCallum's catering service,
which will continue to serve meals to
students through Dec. 12.
The Senate also granted $1000 to
the ASSU Action Research Liaison
Office, an experimental program that
will co-ordinate student research with
small companies, faculty and other
groups in need of research for social
action.
