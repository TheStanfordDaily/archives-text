# Executive Branch Grows Stronger
## Congress Needs To Retrieve Power 
### 
-Ed Kohn

GREENVILLE, Miss., Oct. 29
— Exactly what are the limits of
any President's powers as
authorized by Congress? Are
there, in fact, any real limits? Are
the present limits continually
expanding, and if so, who is
responsible?
A major step toward answering
these questions was taken in late
September when the Special
Senate Committee on the
Termination of the National
Emergency released a 600-page
report. Based partly on
computerized legal research, the
report details the frightening
accumulation of potential power,
in the form of national emergency
legislation, by the executive
branch.
The report begins by noting:
"A majority of the people of the
United States have lived all their
lives under emergency rule. For
40 years, freedoms and
governmental procedures
guaranteed by the Constitution
have, in varying degrees, been
abridged by laws brought into
force by states of national
emergency."
Currently, there are four states
of national emergency in
existence. One dates back to the
Depression "Bank Holiday," in
1933; another to the outbreak of
hostilities in Korea in 1950; a
third in a postal workers' strike in

1970; and the fourth to the
import surcharge imposed by
President Nixon in August, 1971.
Declared State
During a declared state (or
states) of national emergency such
as the four currently in effect,
Congress has given the President
power to institute martial law,
seize property, organize and
control all means of production,
seize commodities, assign military
forces abroad and call up reserve
forces exceeding more than two
million men in this country, and
regulate and/or control
transportation, communication,
personal travel and private
enterprise.
And those are just some of the
powers that Congress has already
granted to the President in the
form of some 470 laws passed
since the start of World War I.
Most of these laws, the special
committee's research shows, were
drafted by members of the
executive and passed by the
Congress with a minimum of
debate. Presidents, of course, have
conferred still more power on
themselves through the use of
proclamations and Executive
Orders.
One recent example of
emergency powers abuse cited by
the committee was a threat one
year ago by then Secretary of
Defense Melvin R. Laird to use a

Civil War food and forage act as a
basis to conduct warfare in
Southeast Asia despite any
appropriations cutoff the
Congress might approve.
19th Century Law
Laird told Congress that the
1961 law, designed to provide
food for Union soldiers and forage
for their horses, could be used to
authorize additional funding for
American war operations in
Indochina. Laird testified that in
the absence of congressional
appropriations for the war effort
the Department of Defense could
utilize "the deficiency
authorization legislation passed at
the time of the Civil War," which
allowed the government to
procede with deficit spending to
support troops in the field.
The committee, which
characterized its report as a first
step "to restore normalcy to the
operations of government," has
recommended that the current
states of emergency should be
ended. A bill that the committee's
members plan to introduce before
its expiration in February will
seek to give Congress a greater
role in the declaration of national
emergencies, a share in their
supervision and the power to
insure that they are not continued
longer than necessary.
The slow but sure
accumulation of massive power —

desired by and granted to the
executive — is but one more
example of this country's drift
toward one-man rule and away
from the tenets of congressional
responsibility, the subcommittee
members believe. The only way to
end the transfer of "great
handfuls of power," say the
committee members, is for the
Congress to reassert itself and to
recover some of the power and
responsibility it has delegated to
the executive branch.

GREENVILLE, Miss., Oct. 29
— Exactly what are the limits of
any President's powers as
authorized by Congress? Are
there, in fact, any real limits? Are
the present limits continually
expanding, and if so, who is
responsible?
A major step toward answering
these questions was taken in late
September when the Special
Senate Committee on the
Termination of the National
Emergency released a 600-page
report. Based partly on
computerized legal research, the
report details the frightening
accumulation of potential power,
in the form of national emergency
legislation, by the executive
branch.
The report begins by noting:
"A majority of the people of the
United States have lived all their
lives under emergency rule. For
40 years, freedoms and
governmental procedures
guaranteed by the Constitution
have, in varying degrees, been
abridged by laws brought into
force by states of national
emergency."
Currently, there are four states
of national emergency in
existence. One dates back to the
Depression "Bank Holiday," in
1933; another to the outbreak of
hostilities in Korea in 1950; a
third in a postal workers' strike in

1970; and the fourth to the
import surcharge imposed by
President Nixon in August, 1971.
Declared State
During a declared state (or
states) of national emergency such
as the four currently in effect,
Congress has given the President
power to institute martial law,
seize property, organize and
control all means of production,
seize commodities, assign military
forces abroad and call up reserve
forces exceeding more than two
million men in this country, and
regulate and/or control
transportation, communication,
personal travel and private
enterprise.
And those are just some of the
powers that Congress has already
granted to the President in the
form of some 470 laws passed
since the start of World War I.
Most of these laws, the special
committee's research shows, were
drafted by members of the
executive and passed by the
Congress with a minimum of
debate. Presidents, of course, have
conferred still more power on
themselves through the use of
proclamations and Executive
Orders.
One recent example of
emergency powers abuse cited by
the committee was a threat one
year ago by then Secretary of
Defense Melvin R. Laird to use a

Civil War food and forage act as a
basis to conduct warfare in
Southeast Asia despite any
appropriations cutoff the
Congress might approve.
19th Century Law
Laird told Congress that the
1961 law, designed to provide
food for Union soldiers and forage
for their horses, could be used to
authorize additional funding for
American war operations in
Indochina. Laird testified that in
the absence of congressional
appropriations for the war effort
the Department of Defense could
utilize "the deficiency
authorization legislation passed at
the time of the Civil War," which
allowed the government to
procede with deficit spending to
support troops in the field.
The committee, which
characterized its report as a first
step "to restore normalcy to the
operations of government," has
