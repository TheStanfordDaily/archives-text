# Neruda Memorial Reading
## Poet Speaks For Workers 
### 
Reginald Gibbons

In the weeks since Pablo
Neruda's death, which came just
after the armed forces illegally
seized control of the government
of Chile in a bitterly resisted coup
d' etat, he has been eulogized in
newspapers and magazines around
the world. The Stanford
community will again join that
praise on Nov. 7, at 7:30 p.m. in
Tresidder Union, when Donald
Walsh, one of Neruda's
translators, will join several
faculty members in a memorial
readingand colloquium on Neruda.
Neruda was born on July 12,
1904, in Parral, Chile, a small
town near the middle of the
country. His father was a railroad
worker, but Neruda, bom Neftali

Reyes, sought for himself a
literary career that would, and
did, take him out of the
backwaters and into the cultural,
and political, mainstream.
It is astounding that, from such
provincial hamlets, poets like
Neruda and Cesar Vallejo
managed to reach the modern
capitals of western culture, as if
they recapitulated in their own
personal histories the progress of
literature, even of civilization,
from the eighteenth century (or
even medieval) life of their rural
towns to the present.
Perhaps because of these
obscure origins, and their contrast
with the world-famous,
cosmopolitan figure that he
became, Neruda did not suffer the

sense of loss in the potency of
language that was suffered by
many modern European and
North American poets. Even
Vallejo had to violate language in
order to meet his own expressive
needs. But Neruda, from the
Twenty Love Poems to his last
works, and throughout the Canto
General, maintained a confidence
— occasionally rocky — in the
Word, in the power of the word to
represent faithfully, and to affect
his fellow men.
His style is florid at times, but
for the most part trenchant, with
a luminous imagery and an almost
liturgical pomp in the extended
poems. He was a great poetic
virtuoso. At one point he tried
short, skinny poems, his
Elemental Odes, centered on the
quotidian, humble artifacts and
elements of the common man's
existence, and in these poems he
achieved a directness that won
over readers who may have
resisted him at his most
gradiloquent.
Tied to his steady maturation
as a poet was his ever-increasing
sense of the political necessity to
immerse his poetry in the struggle
for a humane society that would
faithfully recompense its workers,
and humanize their often brutal
and anonymous toil.
His country was, and is, a
country of poor masses, and he
sought to identify himself with
these workers in his verse, as well
as consciously, orself-consciously,
to speak for them as he wrote. He
desired an intense communion
with both the living and the dead,
the common man who was the
true builder of the ancient and
modern cities of the world.
Donald Walsh, who will read
from his translations on Nov. 7,
has translated Neruda's Residence
on the Earth (written in 1933,
1935, and 1947), and The
Captain's Verses, love poems
originally published anonymously
in the 19505, and later
acknowledged by Neruda. Walsh is
a teacher and a scholar, and has
rendered Neruda into strong,
competent English versions.

community will again join that
praise on Nov. 7, at 7:30 p.m. in
Tresidder Union, when Donald
Walsh, one of Neruda's
translators, will join several
faculty members in a memorial
readingand colloquium on Neruda.
Neruda was born on July 12,
1904, in Parral, Chile, a small
town near the middle of the
country. His father was a railroad
worker, but Neruda, bom Neftali

Reyes, sought for himself a
literary career that would, and
did, take him out of the
backwaters and into the cultural,
and political, mainstream.
It is astounding that, from such
provincial hamlets, poets like
Neruda and Cesar Vallejo
managed to reach the modern
capitals of western culture, as if
they recapitulated in their own
personal histories the progress of
literature, even of civilization,
from the eighteenth century (or
even medieval) life of their rural
towns to the present.
Perhaps because of these
obscure origins, and their contrast
with the world-famous,
cosmopolitan figure that he
became, Neruda did not suffer the

sense of loss in the potency of
language that was suffered by
many modern European and
North American poets. Even
Vallejo had to violate language in
order to meet his own expressive
needs. But Neruda, from the
Twenty Love Poems to his last
works, and throughout the Canto
General, maintained a confidence
— occasionally rocky — in the
Word, in the power of the word to
represent faithfully, and to affect
his fellow men.
His style is florid at times, but
for the most part trenchant, with
a luminous imagery and an almost
liturgical pomp in the extended
poems. He was a great poetic
virtuoso. At one point he tried
short, skinny poems, his
Elemental Odes, centered on the
quotidian, humble artifacts and
elements of the common man's
existence, and in these poems he
achieved a directness that won
over readers who may have
resisted him at his most
gradiloquent.
Tied to his steady maturation
as a poet was his ever-increasing
sense of the political necessity to
immerse his poetry in the struggle
for a humane society that would
faithfully recompense its workers,
and humanize their often brutal
and anonymous toil.
His country was, and is, a
country of poor masses, and he
sought to identify himself with
these workers in his verse, as well
as consciously, orself-consciously,
to speak for them as he wrote. He
desired an intense communion
with both the living and the dead,
the common man who was the
true builder of the ancient and
modern cities of the world.
Donald Walsh, who will read
from his translations on Nov. 7,
has translated Neruda's Residence
on the Earth (written in 1933,
1935, and 1947), and The
Captain's Verses, love poems
originally published anonymously
in the 19505, and later
acknowledged by Neruda. Walsh is
a teacher and a scholar, and has
rendered Neruda into strong,
competent English versions.

In the weeks since Pablo
Neruda's death, which came just
after the armed forces illegally
seized control of the government
of Chile in a bitterly resisted coup
d' etat, he has been eulogized in
newspapers and magazines around
the world. The Stanford
community will again join that
