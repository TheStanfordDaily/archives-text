# Voters Defeat Reagan Tax Plan; Governor Blasts 'Base' Appeals
## 
### RICH JAROSLOVSKY 
California voters yesterday defeated
Proposition One, Gov. Ronald
Reagan's controversial tax limitation
proposal.
With 12,819 of 14,237 precincts
reporting, the initiative trailed
2,062,711 (54.5 percent) no votes to
1,723,034 (45.5 percent) yes votes.
Reagan conceded defeat in the
election shortly before midnight with
harsh words for opponents who, he
said, took advantage of the "base
emotions" of the public.
Also, he said, supporters of the
initiative "were outnumbered three or
four to one in commercials."
(However, figures released last week
by Secretary of State Edmund G.
Brown Jr. indicated that in fact
supporters were outspending
opponents by a 3-2 ratio.)

Voter turnout for the special
election was light. According to
Brown, fewer than 45 percent of the
state's eligible voters actually cast
ballots.
The pattern of returns last night
altered trends in previous elections,
where Northern California frequently
voted heavily on one side, while the
massive Southern California vote
leaned in the other direction.
Yesterday, however, both Northern
and Southern California rejected the
proposal, although by a greater
percentage in the north.
Sports Arena Fails
Meanwhile, Santa Clara County
voters decisively defeated a ballot
measure that would have provided
funding for the proposed county
sports arena. The arena was approved
in November, 1972 with a 59 percent

vote; it lost yesterday by over a 3-1
margin.
With 76.8 percent of the vote
recorded, the proposal trailed with
129,975 (77.4 percent) no votes to
38,008 (22.6 percent) yes votes.
Feinstein Heads Ticket
In San Francisco, Stanford graduate
Dianne Feinstein appeared headed for
a second term as president of that
city's Board of Supervisors. Feinstein
led a field of 27 candidates for five
seats on the board.
Other apparent victors were
incumbents John Barbagelata, Peter
Tamaras and Dorothy von Beroldingen
and former Police Chief Alfred J.
Nelder.
George Chinn, an incumbent
appointed to the board by Mayor
Joseph L. Alioto, appeared to have
lost his seat with a seventh-place

finish.
Yesterday's voting marked the first
time in California history that a special
election was called to decide a ballot
proposition.
The campaign over the
controversial tax limitation plan was
one of the state's bitterest ever, with
each side accusing the other of
campaign wrongdoing and deceptive
advertising.
Both sides mounted intensive media
campaigns to persuade voters that the
proposal would either "end runaway
state spending" or drive taxes "up, up
and up."
Preliminary reports filed with the
secretary of state indicated that the
two sides raised and spent at least $2.3
million through the end of October.
Supporters of the measure outspent
opponents by nearly a 3-1 ratio during
the campaign, although a third of
supporters' funds went to the petition
drive that placed the measure on the
ballot.
The reports indicated that backers
outspent foes by about 3-2 in radio
and television spot advertisements.
Reagan Tarnished?
The initiative's defeat may well
tarnish Reagan's statewide reputation,
and may damage his campaign for the
1976 Republican Presidential
nomination as well. Some observers
had speculated that Reagan intended
to expand his philosophy of "limited
government" into the basis of a
national campaign.
Similarly, the results may enhance
the gubernatorial hopes of Assembly
Speaker Bob Moretti. Moretti, a
Democrat, spearheaded opposition to
the tax plan.
Reagan told a news conference in
Sacramento early this morning that he
didn't think the vote was a personal
defeat.

voted heavily on one side, while the
massive Southern California vote
leaned in the other direction.
Yesterday, however, both Northern
and Southern California rejected the
proposal, although by a greater
percentage in the north.
Sports Arena Fails
Meanwhile, Santa Clara County
voters decisively defeated a ballot
measure that would have provided
funding for the proposed county
sports arena. The arena was approved
in November, 1972 with a 59 percent

vote; it lost yesterday by over a 3-1
margin.
With 76.8 percent of the vote
recorded, the proposal trailed with
129,975 (77.4 percent) no votes to
38,008 (22.6 percent) yes votes.
Feinstein Heads Ticket
In San Francisco, Stanford graduate
Dianne Feinstein appeared headed for
a second term as president of that
city's Board of Supervisors. Feinstein
led a field of 27 candidates for five
seats on the board.
Other apparent victors were
incumbents John Barbagelata, Peter
Tamaras and Dorothy von Beroldingen
and former Police Chief Alfred J.
Nelder.
George Chinn, an incumbent
appointed to the board by Mayor
Joseph L. Alioto, appeared to have
lost his seat with a seventh-place

finish.
Yesterday's voting marked the first
time in California history that a special
election was called to decide a ballot
proposition.
The campaign over the
controversial tax limitation plan was
one of the state's bitterest ever, with
each side accusing the other of
campaign wrongdoing and deceptive
advertising.
Both sides mounted intensive media
campaigns to persuade voters that the
proposal would either "end runaway
state spending" or drive taxes "up, up
and up."
Preliminary reports filed with the
secretary of state indicated that the
two sides raised and spent at least $2.3
million through the end of October.
Supporters of the measure outspent
opponents by nearly a 3-1 ratio during
the campaign, although a third of
supporters' funds went to the petition
drive that placed the measure on the
ballot.
The reports indicated that backers
outspent foes by about 3-2 in radio
and television spot advertisements.
Reagan Tarnished?
The initiative's defeat may well
tarnish Reagan's statewide reputation,
and may damage his campaign for the
1976 Republican Presidential
nomination as well. Some observers
had speculated that Reagan intended
to expand his philosophy of "limited
government" into the basis of a
national campaign.
Similarly, the results may enhance
the gubernatorial hopes of Assembly
Speaker Bob Moretti. Moretti, a
Democrat, spearheaded opposition to
the tax plan.
Reagan told a news conference in
Sacramento early this morning that he
didn't think the vote was a personal
defeat.
California voters yesterday defeated
Proposition One, Gov. Ronald
Reagan's controversial tax limitation
proposal.
With 12,819 of 14,237 precincts
reporting, the initiative trailed
2,062,711 (54.5 percent) no votes to
1,723,034 (45.5 percent) yes votes.
Reagan conceded defeat in the
election shortly before midnight with
harsh words for opponents who, he
said, took advantage of the "base
emotions" of the public.
Also, he said, supporters of the
initiative "were outnumbered three or
four to one in commercials."
(However, figures released last week
by Secretary of State Edmund G.
Brown Jr. indicated that in fact
supporters were outspending
opponents by a 3-2 ratio.)

Voter turnout for the special
election was light. According to
Brown, fewer than 45 percent of the
state's eligible voters actually cast
ballots.
The pattern of returns last night
altered trends in previous elections,
where Northern California frequently
voted heavily on one side, while the
massive Southern California vote
leaned in the other direction.

and Southern California rejected the
