# President Loses Touch
## Nixon Needs Silent Majority 
### 
In the escapades of the last
several weeks Dick Nixon has
done what his long political career
has taught him so well in
attempting to influence public
and political opinion to his way of
thinking. By any means necessary.
Political intrigue, conspiracies,
secret threats and vendettas, and
contrivances of every description
including the creation of artificial
crises.
It is dumbfounding to consider
how a President could be so
unpopular who has demonstrated
such unwaivering, enthusiastic
heroism in such extraordinarily
difficult times!? But it is even
harder to fathom how a man of
Nixon's experience and political
savvy could have bungled himself
into the fix he currently finds
himself.
For he has lost not only the
faith of his own party members
but that of the solid, stolid
majority of middle Americans
whom he once claimed as his
power base. At this point Nixon
would most likely rather his once
"silent majority" remain silent,
but that time is passed and with it
the implicit faith in the man and
the office of the Presidency.
What is it about an incumbent
President that seems so often to
lead to political strife, confusion,
and lame duck legislation? It has
been proposed that the term of
the President be limited to one
period of six years, in which time
constructive initiatives could be
taken without fear or
preoccupations of an impending
election. This may look like a
good idea now, but why has a
President who achieved such an
apparently overwhelming mandate
turned so sour?
Disappointments
The problems could be traced
to Nixon's long history of
political disappointments, scars of
which he probably still bears.
Some say it is his inability to
work within his own party that
has caused the real rift, as
Goldwater has bemoaned so many
times. Possibly the landslide
victory in the last election caused
an unhealthy self-confidence in
the Presidency, but of course the
validity of that election result

could and rightly has been
challenged.
No, more likely the instability
of Nixon's personality or
motivations have played a minor
role in recent catastrophes. It
appears that the root cause for
many of our troubles lies in
having chosen a leader who is
really out of touch with the times.
For how can a man execute the
laws of the land faithfully whose
personal values and priorities
differ so importantly from much
of what America is today;
whether it's foreign policy,
business policy, or ecological
legislation, Nixon appears to be
either in step with the monied
interests or out of step with the
general public whichever way you
look at it. It seems an incredible
smear on our electoral system to
maintain in the face of all of the
evidence we have that ours is a
representative government.
It is unfortunately true that in
ridding ourselves of the scoundrels

\Stan Baker

we must protect the offices they
hold, as created by the
Constitution, lacking in sanctity
as they may now be. What is more
shameful is that even unto the day
the guts of this Administration lie
on the steps of the Capitol
Building, there will be those who
cry out that procedural rights be
observed.
It is quite natural for a dying
man to drag his feet on the way to
the gallows. But it must be
remembered that in observing due
process we pay no respect to
those who have ravaged the
system but respect ourselves from
whom the strength of that system
once flowed. And maybe someday
this government will be a
participatory one. Crisis or no
crisis, we'll all be here tomorrow,
Nixon or no Nixon.
