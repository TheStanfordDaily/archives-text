Questions For Shockley
Editor:
While I was reading William
Shockley's articles of last week it
seemed as if my designated rating
of intelligence quotient was being
drained as I poured my efforts
into understanding his complexly
compound sentences. Would I be
next to be offered $1,000 to
submit to permanent sterilization?
Would I be consulted or my
mother?
This makes me wonder just
where will be the cut-off line for
benevolent sterilization? Who will
determine whether or not an IQ
of say 85 is desirable or not? If
and when our culture eliminates
all those of below 100 IQ, will
they look unfavorably on me with
a modest showing of 130? Will
180+ be the new qualification for
the titles of Mommy and Daddy?
How would Shockley fare in a
Life or Sterilization game such as
this with fiercer competition?
I wonder how well Shockley
would fare if his intelligence
testing tables were turned on him?
Imagine if Bill were tested on the
streets of Watts or Harlem. Denied
the assumption of equality
because of his obviously inferior
color for that environment and
denied the years of "hard knocks"
experience, equipped only with
his vast academic knowledge, Bill
would probably not fare too well.
In fact he might be "snuffed" in
the Darwinian (survival of the
fittest) world of the ghetto.
Or in a different test, a
hypothetical test designed by
humanists, how would Bill
Shockley fare? Would he be able
to distinguish a man from a
statistic? Which would he show
greater affinity for? Shockley's
idea of a rational humanism is one
"controlled by relevant scientific
facts about the biological nature
of humanity." That is strange — I
don't remember learning any
biology in philosophy or humanist
philosophy in biology. I think Bill
Shockley would only fare well in
a humanistic test written by a
biologist from Nazi Auschwitz.
Perhaps Bill does have his
academic fields mixed up.
Something tells me the reason
Shockley's theories have been
rejected by the large majority of
geneticists is simply because he
has been delving into a field of
understanding separate from that
of transistors and it shows in the
quality of his research.
Either this is the case or it's
one of separate experience as in
the inability of people to love one
another until learning to love
themselves.

The fact that there are growing
student loan collection problems
should not greatly surprise

Student Accounts Manager Joseph
Jedd and the University.
Jedd's bemused complaint
about bankruptcy on the rise that
"the morals of society seem to be
changing," betrays an inexcusable
naivete about existing and
potential student creditors.
Mr. Jedd should not expect the
best credit integrity from a pool
of creditors which includes many
who have been "educated" to
despise the very Capitalist system
which made their Stanford
education possible.
Credit — its proper use and role
as the basis of America's
astounding economic prosperity —
is a concept little understood by
most people; few school
curriculums give it an accurate
examination. That it should be
abused by a student body which is
constantly bombarded — in and
out of class — with anti-capitalist,
"anti-exploitation" propaganda,
should come as no surprise. What
should surprise is that the
delinquency isn't any greater.
Mr. Jedd, and all college credit
managers, should more carefully
consider the ripoff morality being
taught and promoted on campus
before they map out their loan
programs. "Nonprofit" thinking
might be okay in the classroom,
but it can't run Stanford.

A recent news item in the San
Francisco Chronicle brought the
shocking fact to light that 4'/2 tons
of marijuana, with a street value
of $8 million, was confiscated in a
recent bust by narcotic agents of
the FBI. (By the way this sad fact
was not reported in the Daily.) We
have calculated that this is
288,000 ounces, or, if one smokes
.5 ounces/day, 576,000
"high-days" or 1,580
"high-years."
The price of the evil weed
would be $27.80/ ounce, meaning
that on a scale of 1 to 10, 10
being high, the stash is rated
approximately $7,348 plus or
minus .001, definitely of good
quality. The stash would keep all
the dopers in our hall (Branner)
high for 48.7 plus or minus .9
years, probably, at that rate of
consumption, their entire lifetime.
We feel that the U.S.
government should turn what
remains of the bust (you never
know about those government
agents) over to us to test our
hypothesis. We would appreciate
the Daily's help in procuring this
experimental tool. Thank you
very much.

I was recently in your Stanford
Community and happened to be
listening to the local campus radio
station, KZSU. I heard American
Indian music being played and
immediately became interested in
the source. After listening to a
program, "The Red River Rising"
I honestly have to say that I felt
very moved by the program.
In the short time that I listened
to the program, I learned more
about Indian people and felt more
understanding to their cause, than
a thousand "Wounded Knees"
could have made me.
I compliment the station on
it's ability to present such caliber
programming.

Jedd and the University.
Jedd's bemused complaint
about bankruptcy on the rise that
"the morals of society seem to be
changing," betrays an inexcusable
naivete about existing and
potential student creditors.
Mr. Jedd should not expect the
best credit integrity from a pool
of creditors which includes many
who have been "educated" to
despise the very Capitalist system
which made their Stanford
education possible.
Credit — its proper use and role
as the basis of America's
astounding economic prosperity —
is a concept little understood by
most people; few school
curriculums give it an accurate
examination. That it should be
abused by a student body which is
constantly bombarded — in and
out of class — with anti-capitalist,
"anti-exploitation" propaganda,
should come as no surprise. What
should surprise is that the
delinquency isn't any greater.
Mr. Jedd, and all college credit
managers, should more carefully
consider the ripoff morality being
taught and promoted on campus
before they map out their loan
programs. "Nonprofit" thinking
might be okay in the classroom,
but it can't run Stanford.

A recent news item in the San
Francisco Chronicle brought the
shocking fact to light that 4'/2 tons
of marijuana, with a street value
of $8 million, was confiscated in a
recent bust by narcotic agents of
the FBI. (By the way this sad fact
was not reported in the Daily.) We
have calculated that this is
288,000 ounces, or, if one smokes
.5 ounces/day, 576,000
"high-days" or 1,580
"high-years."
The price of the evil weed
would be $27.80/ ounce, meaning
that on a scale of 1 to 10, 10
being high, the stash is rated
approximately $7,348 plus or
minus .001, definitely of good
quality. The stash would keep all
the dopers in our hall (Branner)
high for 48.7 plus or minus .9
years, probably, at that rate of
consumption, their entire lifetime.
We feel that the U.S.
government should turn what
remains of the bust (you never
know about those government
agents) over to us to test our
hypothesis. We would appreciate
the Daily's help in procuring this
experimental tool. Thank you
very much.

I was recently in your Stanford
Community and happened to be
listening to the local campus radio
station, KZSU. I heard American
Indian music being played and
immediately became interested in
the source. After listening to a
program, "The Red River Rising"
I honestly have to say that I felt
very moved by the program.
In the short time that I listened
to the program, I learned more
about Indian people and felt more
understanding to their cause, than
a thousand "Wounded Knees"
could have made me.
I compliment the station on
it's ability to present such caliber

Questions For Shockley
Editor:
While I was reading William
Shockley's articles of last week it
seemed as if my designated rating
of intelligence quotient was being
drained as I poured my efforts
into understanding his complexly
compound sentences. Would I be
next to be offered $1,000 to
submit to permanent sterilization?
Would I be consulted or my
mother?
This makes me wonder just
where will be the cut-off line for
benevolent sterilization? Who will
determine whether or not an IQ
of say 85 is desirable or not? If
and when our culture eliminates
all those of below 100 IQ, will
they look unfavorably on me with
a modest showing of 130? Will
180+ be the new qualification for
the titles of Mommy and Daddy?
How would Shockley fare in a
Life or Sterilization game such as
this with fiercer competition?
I wonder how well Shockley
would fare if his intelligence
testing tables were turned on him?
Imagine if Bill were tested on the
streets of Watts or Harlem. Denied
the assumption of equality
because of his obviously inferior
color for that environment and
denied the years of "hard knocks"
experience, equipped only with
his vast academic knowledge, Bill
would probably not fare too well.
In fact he might be "snuffed" in
the Darwinian (survival of the
fittest) world of the ghetto.
Or in a different test, a
hypothetical test designed by
humanists, how would Bill
Shockley fare? Would he be able
to distinguish a man from a
statistic? Which would he show
greater affinity for? Shockley's
idea of a rational humanism is one
"controlled by relevant scientific
facts about the biological nature
of humanity." That is strange — I
don't remember learning any
biology in philosophy or humanist
philosophy in biology. I think Bill
Shockley would only fare well in
a humanistic test written by a
biologist from Nazi Auschwitz.
Perhaps Bill does have his
academic fields mixed up.
Something tells me the reason
Shockley's theories have been
rejected by the large majority of
geneticists is simply because he
has been delving into a field of
understanding separate from that
of transistors and it shows in the
quality of his research.
Either this is the case or it's
one of separate experience as in
the inability of people to love one
another until learning to love
themselves.

Editor:
I was recently in your Stanford
Community and happened to be
listening to the local campus radio
station, KZSU. I heard American
Indian music being played and
immediately became interested in
the source. After listening to a
program, "The Red River Rising"
I honestly have to say that I felt
very moved by the program.
In the short time that I listened
to the program, I learned more
about Indian people and felt more
understanding to their cause, than
a thousand "Wounded Knees"
could have made me.
I compliment the station on
it's ability to present such caliber
programming.

Questions For Shockley
Editor:
While I was reading William
Shockley's articles of last week it
seemed as if my designated rating
of intelligence quotient was being
drained as I poured my efforts
into understanding his complexly
compound sentences. Would I be
next to be offered $1,000 to
submit to permanent sterilization?
Would I be consulted or my
mother?
This makes me wonder just
where will be the cut-off line for
benevolent sterilization? Who will
determine whether or not an IQ
of say 85 is desirable or not? If
and when our culture eliminates
all those of below 100 IQ, will
they look unfavorably on me with
a modest showing of 130? Will
180+ be the new qualification for
the titles of Mommy and Daddy?
How would Shockley fare in a
Life or Sterilization game such as
this with fiercer competition?
I wonder how well Shockley
would fare if his intelligence
testing tables were turned on him?
Imagine if Bill were tested on the
streets of Watts or Harlem. Denied
the assumption of equality
because of his obviously inferior
color for that environment and
denied the years of "hard knocks"
experience, equipped only with
his vast academic knowledge, Bill
would probably not fare too well.
In fact he might be "snuffed" in
the Darwinian (survival of the
fittest) world of the ghetto.
Or in a different test, a
hypothetical test designed by
humanists, how would Bill
Shockley fare? Would he be able
to distinguish a man from a
statistic? Which would he show
greater affinity for? Shockley's
idea of a rational humanism is one
"controlled by relevant scientific
facts about the biological nature
of humanity." That is strange — I
don't remember learning any
biology in philosophy or humanist
philosophy in biology. I think Bill
Shockley would only fare well in
a humanistic test written by a
biologist from Nazi Auschwitz.
Perhaps Bill does have his
academic fields mixed up.
Something tells me the reason
Shockley's theories have been
rejected by the large majority of
geneticists is simply because he
has been delving into a field of
understanding separate from that
of transistors and it shows in the
quality of his research.
Either this is the case or it's
one of separate experience as in
the inability of people to love one
another until learning to love
themselves.

The fact that there are growing
student loan collection problems
should not greatly surprise

Student Accounts Manager Joseph
Jedd and the University.
Jedd's bemused complaint
about bankruptcy on the rise that
"the morals of society seem to be
changing," betrays an inexcusable
naivete about existing and
potential student creditors.
Mr. Jedd should not expect the
best credit integrity from a pool
of creditors which includes many
who have been "educated" to
despise the very Capitalist system
which made their Stanford
education possible.
Credit — its proper use and role
as the basis of America's
astounding economic prosperity —
is a concept little understood by
most people; few school
curriculums give it an accurate
examination. That it should be
abused by a student body which is
constantly bombarded — in and
out of class — with anti-capitalist,
"anti-exploitation" propaganda,
should come as no surprise. What
should surprise is that the
delinquency isn't any greater.
Mr. Jedd, and all college credit
managers, should more carefully
consider the ripoff morality being
taught and promoted on campus
before they map out their loan
programs. "Nonprofit" thinking
might be okay in the classroom,
but it can't run Stanford.

A recent news item in the San
Francisco Chronicle brought the
shocking fact to light that 4'/2 tons
of marijuana, with a street value
of $8 million, was confiscated in a
recent bust by narcotic agents of
the FBI. (By the way this sad fact
was not reported in the Daily.) We
have calculated that this is
288,000 ounces, or, if one smokes
.5 ounces/day, 576,000
"high-days" or 1,580
"high-years."
The price of the evil weed
would be $27.80/ ounce, meaning
that on a scale of 1 to 10, 10
being high, the stash is rated
approximately $7,348 plus or
minus .001, definitely of good
quality. The stash would keep all
the dopers in our hall (Branner)
high for 48.7 plus or minus .9
years, probably, at that rate of
consumption, their entire lifetime.
We feel that the U.S.
government should turn what
remains of the bust (you never
know about those government
agents) over to us to test our
hypothesis. We would appreciate
the Daily's help in procuring this
experimental tool. Thank you
very much.
