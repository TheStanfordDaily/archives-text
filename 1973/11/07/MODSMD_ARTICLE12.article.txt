# Oregon Electric Sign Ban Enforced
## 
### 
SALEM, Ore. (AP) —
Businesses ignoring Oregon's ban
on outdoor display lighting face
disconnection of electrical service
under a public utility
commissioner's order signed
yesterday.
Commissioner Richard Sabin
signed the order to utilities
yesterday, directing them to
disconnect service to violators of
Gov. Tom McCall's executive
order banning outdoor
commercial display lighting.
Sabin announced last week he
was preparing the order after
Atty. Gen. Lee Johnson
recommended it as the only
feasible method of enforcing the
executive order.
The governor imposed the ban
more than a month ago as the first
mandatory curtailment of power
consumption because of a severe
power shortage that was predicted
for the Pacific Northwest this
winter.
A light snowpack last winter
and a drought this summer
reduced water levels behind
Columbia River Dams to record
lows. The region depends on
hydroelectric dams for most of its
power.

The state Energy Information
Center said today that the number
of businesses ignoring the ban has
declined since Sabin announced
his office was preparing the order
to utilities.
State police will continue to

report violators. The public utility
commissioner will inform the
utilities and the offending firms
will be given 72 hours to comply
before service is disconnected.
Sabin is establishing an appeal
procedure for hardship cases, such

as businesses that depend on lights
to attract highway travelers.
In the several weeks since
McCall announced the ban,
consumption of electricity in the
state has been reduced by as much
as 10 percent.
