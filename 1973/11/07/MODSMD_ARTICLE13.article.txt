# Humphrey Plans Forest Bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Sen.
Hubert H. Humphrey, E>-Minn.,
will introduce a bill today calling
for forest management reforms
including a curb on the president's
power to impound forestry funds.
"The sap is coming to a boil on
our forest lands," Humphrey said
in remarks prepared for delivery.
His bill would require that by
the year 2,000 the nation's forests
would be managed to meet
lumber needs without depleting
the supply of timber.
Humphrey said a similar bill
would be introduced in the
House. He said he expects Senate
Agriculture Committee action on
his bill by the end of the year and
a floor vote early in 1974.
The measure drew a skeptical
reaction from one
environmentalist who attended a

briefing Humphrey held
yesterday.
Brock Evans, Washington
director of the Sierra Club, said he
believed the bill could weaken
present protections for wilderness
areas.
Humphrey said it would not.
He said the bill was worked out in
consultation with both industry
and environmental groups.
Evans, however, told
Humphrey that the Sierra Club,
Wilderness Society and Friends of
Earth had been excluded from the
deliberations.
"I think they thought we
would be too hard nosed," he
explained afterward.
More conservatively oriented
conservation groups, such as the
National Wildlife Federation and
the Izaak Walton League, did take
part.

The bill calls for an assessment
of the nation's 1.4 billion acres of
forest and range land by 1975.
This would be updated in 1980
and every 10 years after that.
A program based on the
assessment would be drawn up by
Congress and form the basis of
budgeting for the Forest Service
and related agencies.
Humphrey said timber industry
lands are now producing 52 cubic
feet of wood per acre per year,
although they are capable of
producing 83 cubic feet if
managed to their potential. He
said national forests, with a
potential of 73 cubic feet,
produce only 30 cubic feet.
"I believe that we could
increase recreational and wildness
uses while still increasing the
amount of timber that can be
harvested," Humphrey said.
