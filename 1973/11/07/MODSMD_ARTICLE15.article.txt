# U.S. Prepares Controls
## Arabs Force Fuel Crisis 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The United States is
preparing for "wartime" fuel controls, because of
somebody else's war.
The Arab nations' effort to separate arch-enemy
Israel from her friends by cutting off their oil now
threatens to leave the United States short of 14 to
20 percent of its petroleum needs within a few
months, government officials warn.
The loss may force the government to ration
fuels, to order businesses to close early, and curtail
pleasure driving. Oil companies also may be ordered
to increase production, and power plants told to
convert from oil to coal. Clean-air programs may be
temporarily scrapped to permit burning of dirtier
fuels.
Such measures already have been proposed by
Sen. Henry M. Jackson, D-Wash. Parallel proposals
are in preparation by the Nixon administration.
As late as mid-October, when the United States
had only its own petroleum bottlenecks to worry
about, the administration was clinging to voluntary
fuel-saving as a reasonable hope for getting through
the winter.
"It's an entirely different situation now," says
Duke R. Ligon, director of the Interior
Department's Office of Oil and Gas. "The level of
severity may certainly be increased.
"Before," he said, "we were talking about
distributing any fuels that might be available over
and above last year's levels.
"Now, we're talking about having to cut back on
fuel consumption underneath the 1972 levels."
Before the Arab oil cut-off, Ligon and other
experts predicted the nation would fall short of its

home heating oil needs by at least 100,000 barrels a
day, or possibly as much as 800,000 barrels a day
depending on cold weather, refinery breakdowns
and other factors.
The Arab cut-off, however, dwarfs the original
shortage estimate, threatening the United States
with loss of some 2 million to 2.5 million barrels of
petroleum each day.
By mid-November, Ligon said, the effects will
begin being felt.
The shortage already has hit Europe. Belgium
and the Netherlands have banned Sunday driving to
counter reductions of Arab petroleum. Other
countries are contemplating other measures.
Europe's shortage is indirectly hitting the United
States through the fuel requirements of its 6th Fleet
in the Mediterranean.
Tankers of U.S. petroleum have sailed from
Norfolk, Va., to replace fuel no longer available to
the fleet from Italian refineries.
The administration announced last week that the
Pentagon, which normally buys about half its
petroleum abroad, has been given first priority to
purchase U.S. domestic petroleum, breaking civilian
supply contracts if necessary.
Europe's North Atlantic Treaty Organization
forces, as well as their home nations, depend even
more heavily on Arab oil. And so does Japan.
Interior Secretary Rogers C. B. Morton says if
things get bad enough for U.S. friends abroad, this
nation may have to "share their shortage,"
presumably by foregoing some available foreign oil
so others can import it.
