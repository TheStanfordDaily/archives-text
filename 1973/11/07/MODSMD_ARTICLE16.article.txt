# Premiums Lower For Good Student Drivers

### TOM BORDEN 
"Student Car Insurance ... No
student refused, 25 percent
discount [for 3.0 average]." So
reads the ad, and with insurance
costs as high as $600 a year, many
Stanford student drivers are
taking heed. Although insurance
rates are considerably less for
young women, all single female
drivers under 25 and males under
30 pay more than the average
adult driver. Men under 20 may
pay four times as much.
Most companies do offer
student discounts, generally of
about 25 percent. Some
companies also offer a Driver's
Training discount, and an agent
who sells for Aetna, Hartford, and
St. Paul's insurance companies
claims he can save students a total
of 50 percent off regular rates, if
he has the proper prerequisites.
Students must demonstrate a
minimum grade point average of
3.0 for their last academic quarter
in order to qualify for discounts.
The individual salesman, however,
may be more subjective. One
agent says that he examines
Foothill College students' grades
closely, but that he requires only
the advisor's signature of Stanford
scholars. He considers a student's

acceptance here sufficient
evidence to merit the discount.
Agents vary in their professed
reasons for granting student
discounts. A Farmers' Insurance
Co. representative sees the
discount policy as an offer on his
company's part to keep the good
student from paying for the
recklessness of his fellow young
drivers. Statistics indicate that
young drivers are the worst
insurance risk, but
better-than-average students are
the least costly.
Other companies, however,
professed less altruistic attitudes.
A Unigard insurance company
agent conjectured that companies
believe good students spend more
time studying and less driving. He
said that one company began
giving the discount to attract
more business, and when the
tactic worked, the others followed
suit.
Statistics also show that the
good student is more likely to
take up a professional career, have
a higher standard of living, and
therefore need more insurance.
Insurance companies are
interested in insuring themselves a
booming business, both now and
in the future.
