# 'Pop-A-Grouve' At The Orphanage
## Rock Group Shows Potential 
### JENNIFER RANDISI 
SAN FRANCISCO - Why
would any rock group trying to
play to a reasonably hip audience
call itself "Pop-A-Groove?" There
is such a band, and at the
Orphanage last Friday, they
showed some real, if unrealized,
potential.
Pop-A-Groove began it's first
9et at around 9:30 p.m. Described
by one member as a "top twenty
to forty rock group,"
Pop-A-Groove is a yearling band
consisting of six men and a variety
of instruments including
saxophone and french hom.
Despite their material, which is
definitely reminiscent of AM
radio, the group has a distinct
night-club flavor, both in
appearance and stage act.
There is little in either the
actual musical performance or in
filler material that is suggestive of
any improvisation or much
imagination. In watching
Pop-A-Groove perform, I had the
feeling that the group had
achieved near-perfection of
imitative style that in many ways
stifled what potentially could
have been a fairly creative band.
By far the most innovative and
talented member of
Pop-A-Groove, and also the most
recent, is Barry Ghezzi, whose
handling of five instruments —
tenor and baritone trumpet,
saxophone, flute, and french horn
— provides the imaginative
element for which the rest of the
group seems merely a framework.
For those who would rather listen
than dance to Pop-A-Groove,
Ghezzi is certainly the most
enthusiastic and consistently
professional asset of the group.

Although last weekend had
been their first engagement at the
Orphanage, Pop-A-Groove has
played often in the Bay Area, and
will be performing at the
Woodstock in San Francisco
through this week. The group has
cut an album under Hollywood
Sound Recorders in Los Angeles,
which is to be released within the

next few months.
If you can afford the time to
hear them at the Woodstock this
week, or afford the money to
purchase the album when
released, it would be worthwhile
to hear Pop-A-Groove simply to
take note of Barry Ghezzi — it
could be a name we'll be hearing
in the future of rock music.

must now face the consequences, which ultimately means his fall. For a discussion of the parallels
