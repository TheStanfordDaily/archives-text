# Fifth Dimension Gives Professional Show; Johnny Nash's Jamaican Sounds Explode
## 
### TERRI YAVITZ 
SAN FRANCISCO — A capacity crowd of
8000 filled the San Francisco Civic
Auditorium last Saturday night to listen to
two special sounds, Johnny Nash and the
Fifth Dimension.
Johnny Nash's backup band hopped up on
stage to begin the show. They were already
into the rhythm before a single note left their
instruments. Then it happened. Instant
Jamaican rock exploded! Nash's band, which
back him on his recent gold single, "I Can See
Clearly Now," was flying above the stage as
the musicians sent good feelings throughout
the auditorium.
Their appearance was entertaining in itself.
All were brightly robed or jeaned and wore
turbans, earrings, and other jewelry. Nash
sported a skin-tight carmel-colored leather
pantsuit, with a shark's tooth necklace
dangling down his open shirt. He had a close
cropped Afro and dimples as prominent as his
warm, happy smile. He was in complete bliss
the entire performance, and he gave his all in
his own unique way.
The leadoff song demonstrated their use of
wild percussion gadgets. I caught a glimpse of
two African gourds, two sets of congas, and a
variety of bird whistles. Compounded with
these sound effects was a drummer who

displayed terrific technique. After an
instrumental, "Bend Down," Nash entered
into the spots blending sensationally with the
beat and the brass in "Stir It Up." The saxes
and trumpet especially mixed well with his
bright-toned tenor voice.
Variety of rhythm and intensity was
clearly evident, with a slow mellow song
usually followed by a bouncy, high spirited
one. My favorite single, "Merry-Go-Round,"
softly harmonized voices and instruments to
create a lingering effect on the audience.
Nash's most popular tune, "I Can See
Clearly Now," summed up all of the
distinctive qualities that he and the band
produce. Although he kept a distance from
the audience, he didn't hold back any talent.
It seemed he was trying to maintain the
mystical aura that permeates their Jamaican
reggae style.
Next in line to jog to center stage was the
Fifth Dimension. They got right into a Neil
Diamond hit, "Soule, Soule," carrying it off a
little worse than the originator. The polished
group packed so many popular hits of their
own into the act, they could have easily
discarded that one.
Wearing gold and silver sequined white

slacks and midriff tops (shirts for the men),
the "SD" flowed easily through their
numbers, adding a touch of refinement and
warmth to every song. Their stage
performance almost seemed to be designed for
a night club routine. They performed a
medley of golden hits to perfection,
integrating new singles from their latest
album, Liuing Together Growing Together.
Along with the songs, there was a creative
recitation of black poetry. The audience
favored Ron (Big Sweet's) Townson's
interpretation of the following: "Burping is
hard, lying is mean, so (grunt) get a little
lovin' in between." Marilyn McCoo Davis sang
"Ashes to Ashes" even better than the record
and "Last Night" received an "I love you"
shout from a hysterical fan.
The group is beginning its ninth year
together, and as Florence Laßue Gordon
explained it,"The group that plays together,
stays together." But, as we all know, it is
something more than that.
The fact is, the sth Dimension not only
loves the music they make, but they also
admire each other, and love to give their love
to others. They are one of the few "human,"
yet professional groups around.
