# 'Ring' Offers Watergate Parallels
## 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL (Second of Two Parts) 
As supreme lawgiver in
Valhalla, Wotan finds himself in a
ticklish position, which G.B. Shaw
well described:
Wotan's power has been
established in the world by
and as a sytem of laws
enforced by penalties. TTiese
he must consent to be
bound by himself; for a god
who broke his own laws
would betray the fact that
legality and conformity are
not the highest rule of
conduct — a discovery fatal
to his supremacy as
Lawgiver.
This seems precisely the dilemma
in which Richard Nixon finds
himself, and it is one that may be
explored constitutionally in the
near future. If the President
remains obstinate in his disregard
of this ethical crux — as he
appears bent on doing — we may
not be far from a political
Twilight of the Gods.
Here, then, the Watergate
scenario departs from Wagner's
allegory. For what makes the Ring
so powerfully moving is that
Wotan feels the crushing burden
of his mistake. Unlike so many of
the Watergate characters, Wotan
has a conscience. And it is the
conscience of the politician who
has overweened: "My spirit
longed for power. Impetuous
wishes roused me to madness and
I won the world for myself. With
unwitting dishonesty I acted
disloyally, by treaties I made
alliance with powers concealing
evil."
Burdened with self-woe, Wotan
begins to see the brutal truth
dishonest politicans must live
with: "I became ruler through

treaties; by treaties I am now
enslaved."
Beginning to discern a
"shameful end" for the gods,
Wotan seeks after a means of
delivering himself from the ethical
blight. His pride of power wanes.
And what he describes in his hour
of need is an independent
prosecutor:
A stranger to the god free
from his favours, unwitting,
umprompted, out of his
own needs with his own
weapons could do the deed
which I must avoid, and
which I never suggested,
even though it is my only
wish. This man opposed to
the gods who will fight for
me, this friendly foe, how
can I create a free agent
whom I have never
protected, who by defying
me will be most dear to me?
Wotan's position, in other words,
is that as supreme power he
neither wishes nor is able to
authorize defiance of his power;
and yet in his secret heart he
realizes that it is necessary, even
inevitable. He desires to tough it
out but realizes he cannot.
Siegried's Defiance
The end is as he fears: Wotan's
free agent Siegfried finally defies
him and breaks his spear, the
symbol of his power. Wotan utters
his last words — "Go on. I cannot
stop you." — and disappears
forever.
Wotan, tragic figure that he is,
behaves nobly, and Wagner
composed supremely noble music
to accompany his god's downfall.
Nixon has behaved rather
differently. Hiding himself in his
Executive Valhalla, defending

himself with a wilfully perverse
concept of executive privilege,
Nixon has taken a tough stand.
Unlike even Wotan, Nixon has
clung to the idea that even the
"mightiest of the mighty" is a
power unto himself.
But as pressures mounted and
his credibility nearly vanished,
Nixon was forced to appoint his
Siegfried, Archibald Cox. But a
free agent has been found
undesirable. We are now treated
to the spectacle of Cox being
directed "as an employee of the
executive branch, to make no
further attempts etc.Nixon's
last words may well be those to
his free agent: "Stop. You cannot
do that."
No Final Answer Yet
The situation is unresolved
now, but it is not too early to say
that Nixon's actions have been
ignoble, uncourageous, and
unsatisfying. That is what makes
the Ring far more interesting and
illuminating to me than Watergate
as an anatomy of political
corruption.
The Ring brings the matter to
an ethical crux; Watergate has
only succeeded in confusing with
its tonnage of facts, truckloads of
testimony, and endless petty
acrimony. The Ring's characters —
even its worst villains — are
impressive in their way; the
Watergate cast is bursting with
little men, little ideas, little ethical
perceptions, and little color. As
The World Turns does as well.
And Nixon is the focal point.
His obsessive concern for the
dignity of the office ought not to
surprise us now. He brings so little
dignity of his own to it.
'How Proudly You Boast'
Given the events of the past
year, can the average ratiocinating
American consider the Nixon
administration and think
otherwise than Alberich thinks of
Wotan's administration?
You spokesman of
desperate intrigues! Take
care! Your methods are
quite familiar to me; but
where your weakness lies
that too I have still not
forgotten. .. . How proudly
you boast in your stubborn
strength, and yet how
fearful you are at heart.
With respect to Spiro Agnew
that last sentence jumps out with
vicious irony, though it applies to
all the high-toned and ultimately
false denials that Watergate has
left in its wake. The tough-it-out
approach has not served the
Nixon administration well, and we
may now be experiencing the final
pyrrhic outburst of this mentality.
These differences do not
undermine, however, the stark
fact that the moral of the Ring
and Watergate is the same,
namely, that political power is
infinitely desireable and infinitely
corrupting. Wotan succumbed to
the desire and suffered from its
fulfillment.
Politicians Not As Dignified
Many of Nixon's associates,
appointees and friends — if not
Nixon himself — appear to have

followed the same pattern, though
they are being dragged kicking,
screaming and denying over the
rainbow bridge to the final legal
holocaust. At least Wagner's race
of gods take the final symbolic
resignation with some dignity, not
under indictment or intense
public pressure.
Of course, the unchanging
aspect of political power is that it
is dangerous to use, difficult to
control and powerfully corrosive
of ethical standards, it is Wagner's
fine ironic comment that the last
words we hear in the Ring are of
yet another would-be Wotan
swimming into the Rhine to grasp
the ring once more from its
original owners. He drowns in the
attempt.
Power is inextinguishable. It
must exist and some one must
wield it. But the solution, both in
the context of Valhalla and the
Oval Office, is the same. For it is
their expensiueness that makes
unethical expedience necessary to
gain them. Wotan looks for the
first time on the stupendous
Valhalla and says: "In glorious
gleam the fortress sparkles
proudly. .. . Between moming
and evening in trouble and fear,
not pleasantly, it was acquired."
Not pleasantly indeed. Such is our
election system that few
Presidents or candid observers
have looked upon the White
House on Inauguration Day
without in their secret hearts
thinking Wotan's thoughts.
Disjoin Gold and Power
The answer, we all now realize,
is in the removal of the necessity
of amassing gold from the process
of choosing powerholders. As it
now stands, candidates must like
Wotan make "alliance with
powers concealing evil" in order
to run a campaign. They may do
so unwittingly and with the best
intention, but the evil of the
transaction is still present.
If the politicians in Washington
cannot make this crucial electoral
separation of private gold from
public power, we can look upon
the race of politicans much as
Loge saw the gods triumphantly
entering Valhalla: "They are
hurrying to their end, though
strong and enduring they think
themselves."
