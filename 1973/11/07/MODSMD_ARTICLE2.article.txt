# Demos Score Big Election Wins
## 
### Associated Press 
With politicians and analysts
watching for signs of a Watergate
impact, Democrats appeared to be
making a strong showing in yesterday's
off-year elections.
Democrat Brendan T. Byrne swept
to a landslide victory in New Jersey,
while conservative Republican Mills E.
Godwin Jr. squeezed out a narrow
victory in Virginia in the only two
governor's races.
After a night in which the lead
switched hands three times, Godwin
defeated liberal Lt. Gov. Henry E.
Howell Jr., his independent opponent.
In New York City, veteran
Democratic Comptroller Ambraham
D. Beame easily defeated three
opponents to win the mayoralty held
for eight years by John V. Lindsay,
who did not seek re-election. The
67-year-old Beame will be New York
City's first Jewish mayor.
Democrats Control
In New Jersey, where Byrne piled
up a record-breaking margin and led
Democrats to control of both houses
of the legislature, a party leader
claimed the victory stemmed from
widespread voter dissatisfaction with
President Nixon over Watergate and
other matters.
A similar claim came from
Kentucky, where democrats retained
the Louisville mayoralty and swept
five offices in neighboring Jefferson
County.
In Philadelphia, Democrats
recaptured two major city offices. F.
Emmett Fitzpatrick ousted two-term
Republican District Atty. Arlen
Specter after a campaign in which he

denounced Specter's role as Nixon's
1972 Pennsylvania campaign head.
Mayor Upset
In Minneapolis, Democrat A 1
Hofstede, a 33-year-old former
alderman, upset two-term independent
Mayor Charles Stenvig, a former police
detective who was seeking a third
term.
In Detroit, Democratic state Sen.
Coleman Young was elected as the
city's first black mayor, defeating
former police chief John Nichols in a
non-partisan election.
In Raleigh, N.C., a black was also
elected mayor. Clarence E. Lightner,
currently mayor pro tem, defeated G.
Wesley Williams, a white, in the city's
nonpartisan election.
In Virginia, the Democrats had no
candidate for governor in a state they

had long dominated though both of
the contenders had spent most of their
lives in Democratic ranks.
Godwin, 58, was the state's
Democratic governor from 1965 to
1969 but backed Nixon in 1972 and
switched to the GOP this year. Howell,
53, won the state's No. 2 post as an
independent in 1971.
In New Jersey, the Byme landslide
was evident from the first returns as
the 49-year-old former prosecutor and
judge easily outdistanced his
conservative Republican opponent,
Rep. Charles W. Sandman Jr.
With 489 of 5374 precincts tallied,
the vote stood Byrne 131,665,
Sandman 64,857.
Byrne will succeed moderate
Republican Gov. William T. Cahill,
who was unseated by Sandman in a
bitter June primary that created GOP
wounds that never healed.
Beame Victory
In New York, too, the Beame
victory was clear from the first returns
as the veteran city official led in all of
the city's five boroughs and was
getting more than 50 percent of the
vote.
In Cleveland, meanwhile,
Republican Mayor Ralph Perk scored
an easy victory over city council clerk
Mercedes Cotner.

Democrats to control of both houses
of the legislature, a party leader
claimed the victory stemmed from
widespread voter dissatisfaction with
President Nixon over Watergate and
other matters.
A similar claim came from
Kentucky, where democrats retained
the Louisville mayoralty and swept
five offices in neighboring Jefferson
County.
In Philadelphia, Democrats
recaptured two major city offices. F.
Emmett Fitzpatrick ousted two-term
Republican District Atty. Arlen
Specter after a campaign in which he

denounced Specter's role as Nixon's
1972 Pennsylvania campaign head.
Mayor Upset
In Minneapolis, Democrat A 1
Hofstede, a 33-year-old former
alderman, upset two-term independent
Mayor Charles Stenvig, a former police
detective who was seeking a third
term.
In Detroit, Democratic state Sen.
Coleman Young was elected as the
city's first black mayor, defeating
former police chief John Nichols in a
non-partisan election.
In Raleigh, N.C., a black was also
elected mayor. Clarence E. Lightner,
currently mayor pro tem, defeated G.
Wesley Williams, a white, in the city's
nonpartisan election.
In Virginia, the Democrats had no
candidate for governor in a state they

had long dominated though both of
the contenders had spent most of their
lives in Democratic ranks.
Godwin, 58, was the state's
Democratic governor from 1965 to
1969 but backed Nixon in 1972 and
switched to the GOP this year. Howell,
53, won the state's No. 2 post as an
independent in 1971.
In New Jersey, the Byme landslide
was evident from the first returns as
the 49-year-old former prosecutor and
judge easily outdistanced his
conservative Republican opponent,
Rep. Charles W. Sandman Jr.
With 489 of 5374 precincts tallied,
the vote stood Byrne 131,665,
Sandman 64,857.
Byrne will succeed moderate
Republican Gov. William T. Cahill,
who was unseated by Sandman in a
bitter June primary that created GOP
wounds that never healed.
Beame Victory
In New York, too, the Beame
victory was clear from the first returns
as the veteran city official led in all of
the city's five boroughs and was
getting more than 50 percent of the
vote.
In Cleveland, meanwhile,
Republican Mayor Ralph Perk scored
an easy victory over city council clerk
Mercedes Cotner.
With politicians and analysts
watching for signs of a Watergate
impact, Democrats appeared to be
making a strong showing in yesterday's
off-year elections.
Democrat Brendan T. Byrne swept
to a landslide victory in New Jersey,
while conservative Republican Mills E.
Godwin Jr. squeezed out a narrow
victory in Virginia in the only two
governor's races.
After a night in which the lead
switched hands three times, Godwin
defeated liberal Lt. Gov. Henry E.
Howell Jr., his independent opponent.
In New York City, veteran
Democratic Comptroller Ambraham
D. Beame easily defeated three
opponents to win the mayoralty held
for eight years by John V. Lindsay,
who did not seek re-election. The
67-year-old Beame will be New York
City's first Jewish mayor.
