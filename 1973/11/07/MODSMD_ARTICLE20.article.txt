# 'Westworld' Fails Despite Good Plot
## 
### KAUTILYA 
A precocious child of this
atom-splitting Everest-conquering
age of Sputniks saw some excerpts
from Charlie Chaplin's Modern
Times on TV and was duly
impressed. He was very smart and
pretty rich to boot. So he set out
to make a movie himself. The
technology at hand is immensely
better today (he was a TV buff)
and he will surely have a classic —
meaning a filmic bestseller. And
hence the birth of Westworld.
Well, if not exactly the case, it
does not seem very far from the
story that must have led to
Michael Crichton's new film.
Miles from nowhere, in the
not -too-distant future, stands a
giant amusement park where rich
adults can go and lie out their
fantasies for a while, and then
come back to duty-filled lives of
civilized society until their
neuroses again get the better of
them. And then they set out for
Westworld once again.
There is a choice of three eras
in this ultra-modern Disneyland to
whet one's appetite: the Medieval
world, when knighthood was in
flower; the Roman world, that
classic period of loose togas and
'looser' morals; and yes,
Westworld, with Wells Fargo

coaches, barroom brawls and all
the rest that you've seen in the
John Wayne flicks.
The plot is interesting but the
film is not, due to the
inexperience of the writer-director
Crichton. The script is trite and
simplistic (straight out of a kids'
comic book), the acting lacks
depth, and the story really has
nowhere to go. We pass thru a few
contrived situations, gimmicky
sets, cheap technical jargon, and
the inevitable flashing lights,
rotating tapes, and TV screens of
the control room.
Predictable Complication
Then, as you had probably
guessed all along, the machines
take over and the drama begins.
And now it becomes all too
apparent that this is the
directorial debut of Crichton. The
outcome is obvious, and the
director's efforts to create
suspense more so.
We hardly worry about the
plight of the human beings; they
were such robots anyway. But the
machines were always more
interesting, and now in their
new-found freedom they become
fascinating. That very human
attribute of systematic
extermination is also acquired by
them and we have come full

circle.
Yul Brynner is brilliant in his
role as the mean gunslinger who
provokes guests to draw on him.
Every day he gets killed and has
repairs done to his electronic
gadgets every night. His posture is
still, his eyes are steely and his
black outfit a carbon copy of
Chris from The Magnificent
Seven.
Circuitry Goes Haywire
When his 406 circuitry gets out
of hand his final adversary is
Richard Benjamin, a Chicago
lawyer on a spree in Westworld.
While all the other guests and the
controllers lie dead, and the
robots are inactivated with
run-out batteries, Brynner
relentlessly chases after Benjamin.
No more fun at $1000 a day, and
retributive justice catches up —

almost.
Some fine touches from
Crichton are worth noting. The
slow motion gunfights are lovely,
and the revelation of the robot in
the helpless girl just before the
final scene is a masterly stroke.
But his preponderance of style
and overuse of zoom and
wide-angle lenses leaves much
room for growing up. Far better
stuff to be expected from the
author of The Andromeda Strain.
Almost 40 years ago Chaplin
showed us the essence of this
movie in that feeding machine
sequence in Modern Times: the
useful electrical device, the levers
and switches, and the total chaos
when it goes out of hand. In more
recent times Stanely Kubrick had
done a pretty good job too in
crystallizing the potential horrors

of automation.
In the opening sequence, and
again in the last moments of
Westworld we hear "Boy, have we
got a vacation for you." I only
regret that Crichton could not
also tell the audience something
similar regarding his film.

world, when knighthood was in
flower; the Roman world, that
classic period of loose togas and
'looser' morals; and yes,
Westworld, with Wells Fargo

coaches, barroom brawls and all
the rest that you've seen in the
John Wayne flicks.
The plot is interesting but the
film is not, due to the
inexperience of the writer-director
Crichton. The script is trite and
simplistic (straight out of a kids'
comic book), the acting lacks
depth, and the story really has
nowhere to go. We pass thru a few
contrived situations, gimmicky
sets, cheap technical jargon, and
the inevitable flashing lights,
rotating tapes, and TV screens of
the control room.
Predictable Complication
Then, as you had probably
guessed all along, the machines
take over and the drama begins.
And now it becomes all too
apparent that this is the
directorial debut of Crichton. The
outcome is obvious, and the
director's efforts to create
suspense more so.
We hardly worry about the
plight of the human beings; they
were such robots anyway. But the
machines were always more
interesting, and now in their
new-found freedom they become
fascinating. That very human
attribute of systematic
extermination is also acquired by
them and we have come full

circle.
Yul Brynner is brilliant in his
role as the mean gunslinger who
provokes guests to draw on him.
Every day he gets killed and has
repairs done to his electronic
gadgets every night. His posture is
still, his eyes are steely and his
black outfit a carbon copy of
Chris from The Magnificent
Seven.
Circuitry Goes Haywire
When his 406 circuitry gets out
of hand his final adversary is
Richard Benjamin, a Chicago
lawyer on a spree in Westworld.
While all the other guests and the
controllers lie dead, and the
robots are inactivated with
run-out batteries, Brynner
relentlessly chases after Benjamin.
No more fun at $1000 a day, and
retributive justice catches up —

almost.
Some fine touches from
Crichton are worth noting. The
slow motion gunfights are lovely,
and the revelation of the robot in
the helpless girl just before the
final scene is a masterly stroke.
But his preponderance of style
and overuse of zoom and
wide-angle lenses leaves much
room for growing up. Far better
stuff to be expected from the
author of The Andromeda Strain.
Almost 40 years ago Chaplin
showed us the essence of this
movie in that feeding machine
sequence in Modern Times: the
useful electrical device, the levers
and switches, and the total chaos
when it goes out of hand. In more
recent times Stanely Kubrick had
done a pretty good job too in
crystallizing the potential horrors

of automation.
In the opening sequence, and
again in the last moments of
Westworld we hear "Boy, have we
got a vacation for you." I only
regret that Crichton could not
also tell the audience something
similar regarding his film.

CHECKUP—A technician examines a malfunctioning robot at
Westworid, a gigantic adult amusement park where fantasies can be
acted out. Westword marks the directing debut of Michael Crichton,
author of The Andromeda Strain.
A precocious child of this
atom-splitting Everest-conquering
age of Sputniks saw some excerpts
from Charlie Chaplin's Modern
Times on TV and was duly
impressed. He was very smart and
pretty rich to boot. So he set out
to make a movie himself. The
technology at hand is immensely
better today (he was a TV buff)
and he will surely have a classic —
meaning a filmic bestseller. And
hence the birth of Westworld.
Well, if not exactly the case, it
does not seem very far from the
story that must have led to
Michael Crichton's new film.
Miles from nowhere, in the
not -too-distant future, stands a
giant amusement park where rich
adults can go and lie out their
fantasies for a while, and then
come back to duty-filled lives of
civilized society until their
neuroses again get the better of
them. And then they set out for
Westworld once again.
There is a choice of three eras
in this ultra-modern Disneyland to
whet one's appetite: the Medieval
world, when knighthood was in
flower; the Roman world, that
classic period of loose togas and
'looser' morals; and yes,
Westworld, with Wells Fargo

coaches, barroom brawls and all
