# Original Mussorgsky Score
## S.F. Hears Great 'Godunov' 
### KENNETH DELONG 
SAN FRANCISCO â€” Among
the many delights for the opera
buff in this bumper crop season at
the San Francisco Opera, none is
more welcome than the return of
Mussorgsky's masterpiece, Boris
Godunov. Written when the
composer was only thirty years
old and working as an obscure
clerk in the civil service, Boris is
the greatest of Russian operas,
worthy of a place alongside the
novels of Dostoyevsky and
Tolstoy as one of the finest
artistic achievements of
nineteenth century Russia.
Despite its universally
recognized excellence, Boris has
never been a popular favorite with
San Francisco audiences. Its
successful return during the
current season can be ascribed to
the combination of several happy
coincidences.
First, the present high level of
public support of the San
Francisco Opera removes some of
the risk from programming
"different" operas, and results in
a more interesting season.
Second, the opera was
measurably enhanced by the
presence of the magnificent
Finnish basso Martti Talvela in the
title role. Not only is Talvela

physically commanding in the
part (he is 6'9" tall), he is vocally
commanding as well. He is a true
basso, possessing the vocal depth
and richness of sound usually
found only in Russian bassi.
Talvela's special affinity for this
role was evident also in acting
commensurate with his vocal
excellence.
Peasant Sympathies
Like much grand opera, Boris
is based on actual historical
occurrences, but unlike most
opera the historical aspect is
raised from the trivial to the epic.
Despite its title, Boris Godunov is
first and foremost an expression
of Mussorgsky's sympathy with
the lot of the Russian peasant.
The instrument of this expression
is the chorus, the inarticulate and
easily led mob of peasants who
are duped first by Boris and later
by the pretender Dimitri.
Unlike most operatic choruses,
those in Boris are both significant
and dramatically thrilling. The
San Francisco Opera Chorus was
excellent in this, its most
demanding role of the season, and
well deserved the considerable
applause it received at the end of
the evening.
Boris is also unlike
conventional (Italian) opera in
that it is made up of an
aggregation of individual scenes
which are only loosely related.
The v dramatic effect is
accomplished by the cumulative
impact of these scenes, and the
viewer must make certain
imaginative leaps in order to fill in
the gaps. This technique makes
necessary a rather large cast of
characters, most of which are
cameo parts.
Effective 'Pretender'
Outstanding among these
secondary roles (and all are
secondary to Boris) was Alberto
Remedios as the Pretender
Dimitri. He was well cast vocally
and was particulary effective in
the second act love duet with
Marina.
Evelyn Lear was convincing as
the Polish princess Marina and
also provided vocal relief as the
only high-voiced female in a
predominantly low-voiced cast.
Also impressive were Bruce
Yarnell as Ragoni, the Jesuit
priest, and Raymond Manton as
the Simpleton.
Ragnar Ulfung was

dramatically convincing as Prince
Shuisky, but vocally he was
frequently flat and his voice too
often called to mind his
characterization of Mime in
Wagner's Siegfried. It was
gratifying to see local S.F. singers,
such as Yarnell and Manton,. and
also Shigemi Matsumoto and
Philip Booth, successfully hold
their own in an international cast.
Original Score
Another notable feature of this
production was the use of the
original Mussorgsky score. Usually
the opera is performed from the
second re-touch version by
Rimsky-Korsakov, who tidied up
the orchestration and removed
some of the harmonic "crudities."
For this reviewer, the original
score is to be preferred. The
"crudities," if they really can be
called such, help to convey the
essential difference between the
outer Russian acts and the middle
Polish act with its Westernized
and "civilized" culture.
The most important change,
however, is the reversal of the
final two scenes. In the
Rimsky-Korsakov version, the
opera ends with the death of
Boris, throwing the emphasis
upon the character aspect of the
story.
Crowd Emphasis
The Mussorgsky original
concludes as a cheering mob hails
the Pretender Dimitri as he
marches on Moscow. After they
leave, only the Simpleton is left
on stage to bewail the fate of
Russia. Thus in the original, the
opera is framed by important
crowd scenes which shift the
emphasis away from the
specifically personal and toward
the universal.
The only sour note to be
sounded in an otherwise
memorable performance was the
matter of the sets. Since the opera
includes several changes of
location, many different sets are
needed. This is, of course,
expensive, but it should be
possible to provide something
beyond a simple variation on one
basic set.
This makeshift approach was
particulary irritating in the
uncharacteristic similarity
between the scenes in the inn and
at Marina's palace in Poland. This
reservation aside, the opera was a
fine success, and was considerably
helped by the fine conducting of
Kazimierz Kord and fine playing
by the orchestra.
