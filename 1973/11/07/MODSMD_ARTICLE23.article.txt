# Young Man, Old Man Make Lively Blues Duo

### DAN FORTE 
SAN FRANCISCO — Last week, Oct. 31 thru Nov. 4, Keystone
Korner presented the best blues act to come to the Bay Area this
year, Jimmy Witherspoon and the Robben Ford Sextet.
Two and a half years ago, when Witherspoon came to Palo Alto for
a gig at the now-defunct In Your Ear without a band of his own,
Robben Ford was called on to provide the musicians. The two have
been touring together ever since.
Prior to that time, guitarist Ford had played with Charley
Musselwhite, and his own band, The Charles Ford Band, whose only
LP on Arhoolie Records, is the biggest seller Arhoolie has ever had.
That band consisted of Robben and his two brothers, Pat and
Mark, on drums and harmonica, and bassist Stan Poplin. The current
line-up includes Ken Baker on alto, Russell Feranti on piano, Jim
Chanteloupe on drums, and Jerry Vejmola on tenor sax, with Poplin
on bass.
Surprise Hit Last Simmer
Ford, now 21, was4he surprise hit of the Bay Area Jazz Festival's
"Guitar Explosion" last summer. His guitar work is the type that can
make a musician want to pawn his instrument.
The Ford band was far more than a backup group or a warm-up
act. They preceded all three of Spoon's sets with tight jazz
instrumentals, all composed by Robben. The best of these was "For
You," a calypso-flavored guitar vehicle, which was played minus
horns.
Ford, whose idol is the late John Coltrane, also played some very
impressive tenor saxophone on one number.
First-Rate Blues Team
When Spoon joined the band, the combination of him and Ford
proved to be one of the liveliest, most emotional teams in blues.
Spoon, who has been one of the top blues singers since 1945 when
he joined Jay McShann's band, many blues standards, such as
"Outskirts of Town," "Mean Old Frisco," "Please Send Me Someone
To Love," "I'd Rather Drink Muddy Water," and "T'ain't Nobody's
Business," the Bessie Smith tune which was a million seller for Spoon
in 1952.
The best numbers of the night were "Money's Gettin' Cheaper,"
which included a nice horn riff, "Sweet Lotus Blossom," with a
beautiful solo by Poplin, and the best version of Willie Dixon's
"Spoonful" ever.
To close their third and final set, Spoon and Robben sang
"Everyday I Have The Blues" together. This was Ford's only vocal of
the evening, although he is a very expressive and original blues singer.
There's not much that can be said about Jimmy Witherspoon,
except that he is perhaps the best, surely the most powerful, blues
singer alive.
Bright Future for Ford
As for Robben Ford, much, much more can and surely will be said
in the future. He is one of the most versatile young guitarists to come
around in quite a few years.
He handles both jazz and blues with equal„ usually combining
the two for a fresh, original sound in either mode of expression.
Besides his mastery of speed and technique, Ford shows a beautiful
sense of taste, and achieves one of the nicest tones this reviewer has
ever heard from an electric guitar.
His tone on tenor sax is also quite nice. In fact, he has been playing
the horn longer than he's been playing guitar.
A Whiterspoon LP feat"nng the Robben Ford Band will soon be
released on United Artists.
Keystone Korner, located at 750 Vallejo St., will be featuring some
of the best names in jazz in the weeks to come, such as Freddie
Hubbard, Les McCann, Cannonball Adderle, Charles Mingus, and
Keith Jarrett. For information, call 781-0697.
