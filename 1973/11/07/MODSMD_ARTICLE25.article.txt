Stanford football coach Jack
Christiansen didn't take an overly
optimistic line on Saturday's game
with USC yesterday, saying "We'll
have to come up with
performances like we did against
Washington State just to be in the
ballgame."
But Christiansen, speaking at
the Northern California Football
Writer's Association luncheon in
Oakland, doesn't seem to be
worrying about motivating his
players for the obviously
important contest with the
Trojans. "I think our players
started getting ready for USC
right after Saturday's game," he
said.
"We don't have any posters up
of anything John McKay has
said," he quipped, "because we
don't have enough room in the
locker room."
After the luncheon,
Christiansen noted "we'll have to
get some breaks to win." He also
indicated that Doug Jena will
continue to start at halfback
despite the recently spectacular
efforts of freshman Ron Inge.
"Doug's our best pass blocker, he
catches passes real well and several
times he's come close to breaking
runs."
California coach Mike White,
whose team lost 50-14 Saturday
to the Trojans, seemed more
optimistic about Stanford's
chances against USC than about
his Bears' chances against San Jose
State.
"I don't want to put them on
the spot," White, an assistant to
John Ralston during the Rose
Bowl years said, "but with the
way their defense has been
playing and the way Mike Boryla
has been throwing I think they
can do real well."
White and San Jose State coach
Daryl Rogers spent their time at
the luncheon poor-mouthing their
team's chances against the other.
Rogers' comments, such as
"they're so much bigger and faster
than us," left White motioning as
if playing a violin and Christiansen
imitating playing a record. "We
heard this before we played San

Jose," Christiansen said.
Rogers complimented San
Diego State quarterback Jesse
Freitas, who his team faced
Saturday, as having "the greatest
game any quarterback has ever
had against a team coached by
us. ... I guess he was one of the
guys Stanford couldn't use."
Freitas transferred to San Diego
State over two years ago because
he figured Boryla would become
the future starting quarterback.
Defensive end Pat Donovan
was selected Northern California
defensive player of the week, for
his 10 tackles against Oregon
State. Donovan won the same
honor after the Washington game.
*****
Cardinal Notes: Ron Inge has
not yet returned enough kickoffs
to be included in Pacific Eight
statistics, but leads in that
department "for conference
games only." Inge has returned
9even kicks for an incredible 43.9
yard average.
Christiansen named captains
for the USC game yesterday.
Boryla will captain the offense,
cornerback Jim Kaffen, who made
a key tackle that saved a
touchdown Saturday, will be
defensive captain and Inge will be
special teams captain. Inge may be
the first freshman ever to captain
a Stanford football team.

important contest with the
Trojans. "I think our players
started getting ready for USC
right after Saturday's game," he
said.
"We don't have any posters up
of anything John McKay has
said," he quipped, "because we
don't have enough room in the
locker room."
After the luncheon,
Christiansen noted "we'll have to
get some breaks to win." He also
indicated that Doug Jena will
continue to start at halfback
despite the recently spectacular
efforts of freshman Ron Inge.
"Doug's our best pass blocker, he
catches passes real well and several
times he's come close to breaking
runs."
California coach Mike White,
whose team lost 50-14 Saturday
to the Trojans, seemed more
optimistic about Stanford's
chances against USC than about
his Bears' chances against San Jose
State.
"I don't want to put them on
the spot," White, an assistant to
John Ralston during the Rose
Bowl years said, "but with the
way their defense has been
playing and the way Mike Boryla
has been throwing I think they
can do real well."
White and San Jose State coach
Daryl Rogers spent their time at
the luncheon poor-mouthing their
team's chances against the other.
Rogers' comments, such as
"they're so much bigger and faster
than us," left White motioning as
if playing a violin and Christiansen
imitating playing a record. "We
heard this before we played San

Jose," Christiansen said.
Rogers complimented San
Diego State quarterback Jesse
Freitas, who his team faced
Saturday, as having "the greatest
game any quarterback has ever
had against a team coached by
us. ... I guess he was one of the
guys Stanford couldn't use."
Freitas transferred to San Diego
State over two years ago because
he figured Boryla would become
the future starting quarterback.
Defensive end Pat Donovan
was selected Northern California
defensive player of the week, for
his 10 tackles against Oregon
State. Donovan won the same
honor after the Washington game.
*****
Cardinal Notes: Ron Inge has
not yet returned enough kickoffs
to be included in Pacific Eight
statistics, but leads in that
department "for conference
games only." Inge has returned
9even kicks for an incredible 43.9
yard average.
Christiansen named captains
for the USC game yesterday.
Boryla will captain the offense,
cornerback Jim Kaffen, who made
a key tackle that saved a
touchdown Saturday, will be
defensive captain and Inge will be
special teams captain. Inge may be
the first freshman ever to captain
a Stanford football team.

SET FOR THE KlCK—Stanford's Brian Bershader gets ready to shoot
in the Cards'o-0 tie against California last Saturday. Stanford hopes to
improve on its 8-4-1 record his afternoon when the Cards host Cal
State-Hayward in a 2 p.m. game at Harry Maloney Soccer Field. The
junior varsity will play Hayward's JV's at 3:30 p.m.
Stanford football coach Jack
Christiansen didn't take an overly
optimistic line on Saturday's game
with USC yesterday, saying "We'll
have to come up with
performances like we did against
Washington State just to be in the
ballgame."
But Christiansen, speaking at
the Northern California Football
Writer's Association luncheon in
Oakland, doesn't seem to be
worrying about motivating his
players for the obviously
important contest with the
Trojans. "I think our players
