# Pro Prognosis
## Super Bowl Crystal Ball 
### Don Tollefson 
With eight weeks of the pro football season
completed, some gambling friends of mine have
asked me to gaze into the Super Bowl crystal ball so
that they can bet against my choices. So with
deepest apologies to Las Vegas' most famous Greek,
I shall climb out on a very unstable limb.
The playoff picture is rapidly cementing itself,
but trying to look all the way to Houston in
January involves considerable risk. But as of now,
my pick to dethrone the Dolphins is none other
than the Oakland A's roommates, the Oakland
Raiders.
After a fairly shaky start, the Raiders decided to
replace veteran Daryll Lamonica at quarterback
with southpaw Ken Stabler and it is this decision
which should win the Super Bowl for the
Qaklanders. Stabler has been awesome in his last
two games, completing 25 of 29 passes in the
Raiders' 34-21 win over Baltimore and 16 of 21
passes in their 42-0 demolition of the N.Y. Giants.
The Raiders have won six AFC West Division
championships in seven years and have come within
inches of being world champions only to fold at the
end or be victimized by the freakiest of freak plays
such as the immortal volleyball touchdown scored
by Pittsburgh's Franco Harris a year ago.
For years the Raiders have had as much talent as
any team in the NFL and the addition of towering
Bubba Smith and punter Ray Guy and the switch to
Stabler should be the keys to going all the way.
Dolphins and Steelers
The other American Conference division winners
will undoubtedly be the Dolphins and the Steelers
and the wild card team should be Kansas City,
although the Buffalo Bills still have an outside
chance. Assuming Kansas City is the wild card team,
they will play at Miami in the opening round and
will lose handily, while Pittsburgh will play at
Oakland and lose narrowly.
In the AFC Championship game, the Raiders

should boat Miami just as they did earlier this year
when they snapped the Dolphins winning streak.
The Floridians seem to be suffering from an
extreme case of complacency which is very similar
to the one the Trojans of USC are experiencing in
the collegiate ranks.
Rams, Vikings Cruising
In the NFC, the surprising Los Angeles Rams and
the reincarnated Minnesota Vikings are cruising into
the playoffs, while the Redskins and Cowboys are
fighting it out for the East Division crown.
Whichever team loses that East Division title should
grab the wild card spot, although the Atlanta
Falcons also have a shot at it. But as in the
American Conference, none of these teams will get
any further than a wild card ticket to round one.
Minnesota will host the wild card team, while the
Rams will travel to the home of the East Division
winner. Neither the Rams or the Vikings should
have much trouble with either George Allen's aging
Redskins or the Cowboys and when L.A. and
Minnesota meet in the NFC championship game, it
should be an outstanding rematch of their game two
weeks ago, although the Vikings will again prevail.
But the Vikings' undefeated season will come to
a rude end in Houston against the Raiders. In
Bloomington, the Vikings might prevail because of
what is one of the largest home field advantages in
pro football, but in Houston it will be a different
story. Without snow and freezing temperatures, the
Raiders will be able to penetrate Minnesota's
vaunted defense, while Fran Tarkenton will be
scrambling himself right into the arms of big Bubba.
Oakland deserves two world champions about as
much as Philadelpha, but it looks as if San
Francisco's weak sister will get them.
In case of major injuries between now and the
end of the regular season, these predictions will
self-destruct and I will disavow any knowledge of
their origins.
