Jail Escapees Hold Hostages
WADENA, Minn. — Two escapees from the
Wadena County jail were holding several persons
hostage at a farm just west of Wadena last night,
authorities said.
The sheriff's office identified the escapees as
John P. Morgan, 37, Glenwood, Minn., and William
L. Wimans, 18, Fergus Falls, Minn.
Sheriff's officers from Wadena, Otter Tail and
Cass counties, as well as Highway Patrol troopers,
were negotiating with the pair for the release of the
hostages, who had been held since 6 p.m.
The hostages, who were not identified, were
believed to be the six members of the family which
lived on the farm. The sheriff's office refused to
release the family's name.
A dispatcher was shot and wounded slightly
when Morgan and Wimans escaped from the jail
Monday night. Authorities said the men had a
handgun which apparently was smuggled in to them.
Richardson Testifies About Cox
WASHINGTON — Elliot L. Richardson testified
yesterday that even if all of ousted special Watergate
prosecutor Archibald Cox's investigations had led
to indictments, there would have been "nothing
inflicting any additional damage on the White House
or the President."
"No very shattering impacts would have
occurred," said the former attorney general, who
resigned rather than carry out President Nixon's
order to fire Cox.
He testified there was a feeling among the White
House staff that Cox was "a ravenous beast whose
appetite was insatiable" and said they were
constantly getting complaints from Republicans
about "why they were letting that guy Cox roam all
over the place."
As a result, Richardson told the Senate Judiciary
Committee, he received "chronic complaints" from
the White House that Cox was trying to carry his
investigations beyond his assigned jurisdiction.
Richardson said "the sad aspect" of it was that a
little more cooperation would have expedited the
investigation, avoided a cataclysmic upheaval in the

Justice Department and, so far as he knew, "would
not have significantly affected the over-all picture of
what occurred."
Chairman James O. Eastland, D-Miss., asked
Richardson if he thought Cox was fired because he
was on the trial of "some sensational stuff."
"Nothing essentially new or radically different
from what had publicly emerged was in the works
that I know of," Richardson replied.
He said the "crunch arose" over the President's
proposal to withdraw Cox's authority to bring court
challenges to claims of executive privilege for White
House tapes, notes and memoranda of presidential
conversations.
Richardson told the committee that Nixon
should waive executive privilege and commit himself
to making available to a special prosecutor all tapes
and other materials relevant to the Watergate and
related investigations.
Reinecke Perjury Evidence?
SACRAMENTO — Special Watergate prosecutor
Archibald Cox had evidence "pointing to perjury"
by Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke in the ITT case,
Washington columnist Jack Anderson said
yesterday.
Reinecke spokesman Lyn Nofziger said there
would be no comment from Reinecke on
Anderson's column.
"The ITT thing is still under investigation and I
don't think the lieutenant governor should
comment under those circumstances," said
Nofziger.
Reinecke is seeking the Republican nomination
for governor next year. Nofziger is his chief political
adviser.
The International Telephone and Telegraph
Corp. pledged a $400,000 contribution to help
defray costs of the 1972 Republican National
Convention.
Reinecke and other witnesses, in testimony
before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, denied
that the pledge was linked to a Justice Department
settlement of an ITT anti-trust case.
In a column published yesterday, Anderson said
Reinecks supported testimony from former Atty.
Gen. John Mitchell, who told the committee he
knew nothing about ITT's pledge.
Kemper Transferred
REDWOOD CITY — The bulking giant accused
of killing eight women was transferred to the
medical facility at Vacaville yesterday by order of
his trial judge to keep the accused from making
further attempts on his own life.
Santa Cruz County Superior Court Judge Harry
Brauer said he signed the order moving Edmund
Kemper 111 to Vacaville because the 6-foot-9,
280-pound defendant was "a serious custodial
problem."
Kemper, 25, had been confined in San Mateo
County jail in Redwood City during his Santa Cruz
trial. He has pleaded innocent by reason of insanity
to charges of killing his mother, her best friend and
six hitchhiking coeds.

Jail Escapees Hold Hostages
WADENA, Minn. — Two escapees from the
Wadena County jail were holding several persons
hostage at a farm just west of Wadena last night,
authorities said.
The sheriff's office identified the escapees as
John P. Morgan, 37, Glenwood, Minn., and William
L. Wimans, 18, Fergus Falls, Minn.
Sheriff's officers from Wadena, Otter Tail and
Cass counties, as well as Highway Patrol troopers,
were negotiating with the pair for the release of the
hostages, who had been held since 6 p.m.
The hostages, who were not identified, were
believed to be the six members of the family which
lived on the farm. The sheriff's office refused to
release the family's name.
A dispatcher was shot and wounded slightly
when Morgan and Wimans escaped from the jail
Monday night. Authorities said the men had a
handgun which apparently was smuggled in to them.
Richardson Testifies About Cox
WASHINGTON — Elliot L. Richardson testified
yesterday that even if all of ousted special Watergate
prosecutor Archibald Cox's investigations had led
to indictments, there would have been "nothing
inflicting any additional damage on the White House
or the President."
"No very shattering impacts would have
occurred," said the former attorney general, who
resigned rather than carry out President Nixon's
order to fire Cox.
He testified there was a feeling among the White
House staff that Cox was "a ravenous beast whose
appetite was insatiable" and said they were
constantly getting complaints from Republicans
about "why they were letting that guy Cox roam all
over the place."
As a result, Richardson told the Senate Judiciary
Committee, he received "chronic complaints" from
the White House that Cox was trying to carry his
investigations beyond his assigned jurisdiction.
Richardson said "the sad aspect" of it was that a
little more cooperation would have expedited the
investigation, avoided a cataclysmic upheaval in the

Justice Department and, so far as he knew, "would
not have significantly affected the over-all picture of
what occurred."
Chairman James O. Eastland, D-Miss., asked
Richardson if he thought Cox was fired because he
was on the trial of "some sensational stuff."
"Nothing essentially new or radically different
from what had publicly emerged was in the works
that I know of," Richardson replied.
He said the "crunch arose" over the President's
proposal to withdraw Cox's authority to bring court
challenges to claims of executive privilege for White
House tapes, notes and memoranda of presidential
conversations.
Richardson told the committee that Nixon
should waive executive privilege and commit himself
to making available to a special prosecutor all tapes
and other materials relevant to the Watergate and
related investigations.

Richardson Testifies About Cox
WASHINGTON — Elliot L. Richardson testified
yesterday that even if all of ousted special Watergate
prosecutor Archibald Cox's investigations had led
to indictments, there would have been "nothing
inflicting any additional damage on the White House
or the President."
"No very shattering impacts would have
occurred," said the former attorney general, who
resigned rather than carry out President Nixon's
order to fire Cox.
He testified there was a feeling among the White
House staff that Cox was "a ravenous beast whose
appetite was insatiable" and said they were
constantly getting complaints from Republicans
about "why they were letting that guy Cox roam all
over the place."
As a result, Richardson told the Senate Judiciary
Committee, he received "chronic complaints" from
the White House that Cox was trying to carry his
investigations beyond his assigned jurisdiction.
Richardson said "the sad aspect" of it was that a
little more cooperation would have expedited the
investigation, avoided a cataclysmic upheaval in the

Justice Department and, so far as he knew, "would
not have significantly affected the over-all picture of
what occurred."
Chairman James O. Eastland, D-Miss., asked
Richardson if he thought Cox was fired because he
was on the trial of "some sensational stuff."
"Nothing essentially new or radically different
from what had publicly emerged was in the works
that I know of," Richardson replied.
He said the "crunch arose" over the President's
proposal to withdraw Cox's authority to bring court
challenges to claims of executive privilege for White
House tapes, notes and memoranda of presidential
conversations.
Richardson told the committee that Nixon
should waive executive privilege and commit himself
to making available to a special prosecutor all tapes
and other materials relevant to the Watergate and
related investigations.

In a column published yesterday, Anderson said
Reinecks supported testimony from former Atty.
Gen. John Mitchell, who told the committee he
knew nothing about ITT's pledge.

Nixon To Speak On Energy
WASHINGTON — President Nixon will discuss
the mounting energy problem and outline new
conservation proposals in a television-radio address
to the nation tonight, White House aides said.
Nixon decided yesterday to make the national
broadcast after he was advised by a key aide that
voluntary measures would fall short of preventing a
fuel shortage crisis.
Nixon met with his Cabinet to discuss the cut-off
of Arab oil imports. He will meet with Democratic
and Republican leaders of Congress on the same
subject this morning.
The White House said Nixon plans "a series of
suggestions and actions" to be accomplished
administratively and through legislation.
Jail Escapees Hold Hostages
WADENA, Minn. — Two escapees from the
Wadena County jail were holding several persons
hostage at a farm just west of Wadena last night,
authorities said.
The sheriff's office identified the escapees as
John P. Morgan, 37, Glenwood, Minn., and William
L. Wimans, 18, Fergus Falls, Minn.
Sheriff's officers from Wadena, Otter Tail and
Cass counties, as well as Highway Patrol troopers,
were negotiating with the pair for the release of the
hostages, who had been held since 6 p.m.
The hostages, who were not identified, were
believed to be the six members of the family which
lived on the farm. The sheriff's office refused to
release the family's name.
A dispatcher was shot and wounded slightly
when Morgan and Wimans escaped from the jail
Monday night. Authorities said the men had a
handgun which apparently was smuggled in to them.
Richardson Testifies About Cox
WASHINGTON — Elliot L. Richardson testified
yesterday that even if all of ousted special Watergate
prosecutor Archibald Cox's investigations had led
to indictments, there would have been "nothing
inflicting any additional damage on the White House
or the President."
"No very shattering impacts would have
occurred," said the former attorney general, who
resigned rather than carry out President Nixon's
order to fire Cox.
He testified there was a feeling among the White
House staff that Cox was "a ravenous beast whose
appetite was insatiable" and said they were
constantly getting complaints from Republicans
about "why they were letting that guy Cox roam all
over the place."
As a result, Richardson told the Senate Judiciary
Committee, he received "chronic complaints" from
the White House that Cox was trying to carry his
investigations beyond his assigned jurisdiction.
Richardson said "the sad aspect" of it was that a
little more cooperation would have expedited the
investigation, avoided a cataclysmic upheaval in the

Justice Department and, so far as he knew, "would
not have significantly affected the over-all picture of
what occurred."
Chairman James O. Eastland, D-Miss., asked
Richardson if he thought Cox was fired because he
was on the trial of "some sensational stuff."
"Nothing essentially new or radically different
from what had publicly emerged was in the works
that I know of," Richardson replied.
He said the "crunch arose" over the President's
proposal to withdraw Cox's authority to bring court
challenges to claims of executive privilege for White
House tapes, notes and memoranda of presidential
conversations.
Richardson told the committee that Nixon
should waive executive privilege and commit himself
to making available to a special prosecutor all tapes
and other materials relevant to the Watergate and
related investigations.
Reinecke Perjury Evidence?
SACRAMENTO — Special Watergate prosecutor
Archibald Cox had evidence "pointing to perjury"
by Lt. Gov. Ed Reinecke in the ITT case,
Washington columnist Jack Anderson said
yesterday.
Reinecke spokesman Lyn Nofziger said there
would be no comment from Reinecke on
Anderson's column.
"The ITT thing is still under investigation and I
don't think the lieutenant governor should
comment under those circumstances," said
Nofziger.
Reinecke is seeking the Republican nomination
for governor next year. Nofziger is his chief political
adviser.
The International Telephone and Telegraph
Corp. pledged a $400,000 contribution to help
defray costs of the 1972 Republican National
Convention.
Reinecke and other witnesses, in testimony
before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, denied
that the pledge was linked to a Justice Department
settlement of an ITT anti-trust case.
In a column published yesterday, Anderson said
Reinecks supported testimony from former Atty.
Gen. John Mitchell, who told the committee he
knew nothing about ITT's pledge.
Kemper Transferred
REDWOOD CITY — The bulking giant accused
of killing eight women was transferred to the
medical facility at Vacaville yesterday by order of
his trial judge to keep the accused from making
further attempts on his own life.
Santa Cruz County Superior Court Judge Harry
Brauer said he signed the order moving Edmund
Kemper 111 to Vacaville because the 6-foot-9,
280-pound defendant was "a serious custodial
problem."
Kemper, 25, had been confined in San Mateo
County jail in Redwood City during his Santa Cruz
trial. He has pleaded innocent by reason of insanity
to charges of killing his mother, her best friend and
six hitchhiking coeds.

Oakland School Chief Killed
OAKLAND — School Supt. Marcus Foster was
killed and a deputy injured by shotgun fire in front
of the school administration building, police
reported.
Both men were rushed to Highland Hospital here.
The injured man, Robert Blackburn, Foster's
deputy superintendent, was reported in critical
condition.
A police spokesman said Foster was hit twice in
the shooting. Officers were looking for three black
men seen fleeing the scene in a dark-colored car.
The shooting occurred shortly after 7 p.m. at
Oakland Unified School District headquarters on
Second Avenue, officers said. A school board
noting had been scheduled.
Ofiicers said the assailants, wearing
dungaree-type clothing, approached Foster and
Blackburn as they were about to enter a small white
car in a parking lot at the site of the school offices.
Shots were fired, and the attackers ducked into
nearby bushes.
Police sealed off the entire block and searched
nearby Lakeside Park in the downtown area.
Foster, a 50-year-old black educator, came to
Oakland in 1970 from Philadelphia where he was
associate superintendent.
The first black superintendent in a large
California school district, Foster took the helm of a
91-school system with more than 65,000 students in
a city of about 361,500.
Mideast Cease-Fire Cracks
TEL AVIV — Israeli and Egyptian troops traded
small-arms fire across the Suez cease-fire line
yesterday, and Syria reported Israeli jets fired

reported as Arab leaders worked out arrangements
for a summit conference in Algeria late next week
and envoys from Washington and Moscow toured
the Mideast.
Informed sources in Cairo and sources close to
the U.N. peace effort said there was Egyptian and
Israeli military movement along the Suez Canal
front.
In Paris, Egyptian foreign affairs adviser
Mohamed H. el-Zayyat told newsmen at a luncheon
yesterday that "there is a great danger we'll see a
