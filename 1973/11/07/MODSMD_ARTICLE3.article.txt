# Chess Master Plays The Mating Game
## 
### PHILIP FEDER 
For junior Robert Newbold, chess
is more than just a leisurely match for
two analytical minds.
Newbold is a chess master, one of
under 400 in the United States. The
"master" reaches such a distinction by
accumulating a sufficient number of
points on the U.S. Chess Federation
scale.
Newbold began competing in chess
tournaments at 13. At 18, Newbold
won the U.S. high school
championships, enabling him to play
in an international tournament in
Belgium.
"I was the highest rated junior 18
or under in the United States," he
said. "Winning those first important
tournaments tends to get one
interested in the game."
Chess in the United States ranked
somewhere between tiddly-winks and
pole climbing in fan interest before the
famed Bobby Fischer-Boris Spassky
world championship match in 1972.
The Iceland match attracted the
attention of many who did not know
the difference between a double
fianchetto and a double play. The
electricity generated by Fischer and
Spassky was the kind usually reserved
for an epic heavyweight championship
fight.
The newfound popularity in chess
pleases Newbold. "It's a good thing
that people's attitudes are changing. In
high school I was the outcast, the
egghead. Now I can keep a normal
social life and still play chess when I
want to."
Newbold's bookcase spills over the
edges with chess manuals, magazines,
strategy guides and reports of famous
matches. Among these treatises on
chess are physics and math books.
"I'm a math major," he said. "Math
helps in learning about chess where
you need a certain amount of analytic
ability."

At the chess board, Newbold
exhibits a calm, stolid appearance,
unlike Fischer's bundle of nervous tics
and twitches. The Stanford
undergraduate is the epitome of
stoicism as he carefully surveys the
board, assessing his next move.
For some, chess is a punishing
game. A study at Temple University
found that chess drained as much
energy out of a player as did a
comparable session of boxing or
football. Before important
tournaments, some masters' regimens
include running, swimming, yoga or
daily sessions with chess-playing
psychologists. During the tourney, it's
not unusual for a master to lose 15

pounds.
Newbold, however, conserves all his
stamina for the match. 'The
important thing is to get enough sleep
before a tournament. You can't afford
to get very excited and waste needed
mental energy," he said.
Newbold disagrees with current
grand masters who constantly dream
of the ultimate checkmate. Newbold
considers chess to be simply a hobby.
"You could be an amateur radio
operator," he said. "I play chess."
Newbold no longer follows a heavy
tournament schedule. Instead, he
teaches chess to more inexperienced
players. Last year, he played 30 people
simultaneously. He won 24 times, lost
only once, and drew five times.

"You could be an amateur radio
operator," he said. "I play chess."
Newbold no longer follows a heavy
tournament schedule. Instead, he
teaches chess to more inexperienced
players. Last year, he played 30 people
simultaneously. He won 24 times, lost
only once, and drew five times.

CHAMPION PAWN PUSHER Undergraduate chess master Robert Newbold
contemplates his next move. Newbold is one of less than 400 plavers in the U.S.
to have earned master ranking.
For junior Robert Newbold, chess
is more than just a leisurely match for
two analytical minds.
Newbold is a chess master, one of
under 400 in the United States. The
"master" reaches such a distinction by
accumulating a sufficient number of
points on the U.S. Chess Federation
scale.
Newbold began competing in chess
tournaments at 13. At 18, Newbold
won the U.S. high school
championships, enabling him to play
in an international tournament in
Belgium.
"I was the highest rated junior 18
or under in the United States," he
said. "Winning those first important
tournaments tends to get one
interested in the game."
Chess in the United States ranked
somewhere between tiddly-winks and
pole climbing in fan interest before the
famed Bobby Fischer-Boris Spassky
world championship match in 1972.
The Iceland match attracted the
attention of many who did not know
the difference between a double
fianchetto and a double play. The
electricity generated by Fischer and
Spassky was the kind usually reserved
for an epic heavyweight championship
fight.
The newfound popularity in chess
pleases Newbold. "It's a good thing
that people's attitudes are changing. In
high school I was the outcast, the
egghead. Now I can keep a normal
social life and still play chess when I
want to."
Newbold's bookcase spills over the
edges with chess manuals, magazines,
strategy guides and reports of famous
matches. Among these treatises on
chess are physics and math books.
"I'm a math major," he said. "Math
helps in learning about chess where
you need a certain amount of analytic
ability."

At the chess board, Newbold
exhibits a calm, stolid appearance,
unlike Fischer's bundle of nervous tics
and twitches. The Stanford
undergraduate is the epitome of
stoicism as he carefully surveys the
board, assessing his next move.
For some, chess is a punishing
game. A study at Temple University
found that chess drained as much
energy out of a player as did a
comparable session of boxing or
football. Before important
tournaments, some masters' regimens
include running, swimming, yoga or
daily sessions with chess-playing
psychologists. During the tourney, it's
not unusual for a master to lose 15

pounds.
Newbold, however, conserves all his
stamina for the match. 'The
important thing is to get enough sleep
before a tournament. You can't afford
to get very excited and waste needed
mental energy," he said.
Newbold disagrees with current
grand masters who constantly dream
of the ultimate checkmate. Newbold
