# PA-Stanford Group May Open Meetings
## 
### 
The newly-formed Stanford/Palo
Alto Staff Liaison Committee
yesterday discussed opening its
meetings to the press, but deferred any
decision on the matter at least until its
Dec. 13 meeting.
A Daily editorial on Oct. 12 said
"the committee [ had ] prevented
newsmen from serving [the] public
interest" by denying them admission
to the meetings. University Vice
President for Business and Finance
Robert R. Augsburger, who acted as
committee chairman yesterday, invited
Daily editor Jim Wascher to discuss
the editorial with the committee.
Wascher told the committee that
"being excluded from the meetings of
this committee will hamper our ability
to provide information of mutual
interest to the University and its
neighbor city."
The liaison committee invited
Wascher to sit in on the Dec. 13
meeting as an observer to determine a
manner in which the campus media
could cover certain aspects of the
committee's deliberations without
reporting on necessarily confidential
matters.
Augsburger said last night that the
Stanford members of the committee

had informed their colleagues that the
University "had to refile with the
Santa Clara County Local Agency
Formation Commission our request
for approval [for Palo Alto] to annex"
the area intended for the Frenchman's
Terrace low-to-middle income housing
project.
A federal funding freeze which
temporarily halted the Frenchman's
Terrace project made the refiling
necessary, according to Augsburger.
Augsburger also said the city staff
would report to the Palo Alto City
Council within a few months on
"several alternatives for the
improvement of Willow Road and its
extension to El Camino Real near the
Medical Center."
The committee also heard a report
from several of its members on a
"supplementary transportation system
between the Southern Pacific station
in Palo Alto and the Oval near the
Quad," Augsburger said.
He added that providing bus service
on this route at 15 minute intervals
would cost about $50,000 and said
that some committee members were
not certain that the route under
consideration would be acceptable.
