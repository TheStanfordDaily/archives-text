# Testimony On Review Of Tapes Asked
## Nixon's Secretary Galled To Testify 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Nixon's long-time personal secretary,
Rose Mary Woods, was notified
yesterday she will be called to testify
about her review of the subpoenaed
Watergate tapes.
Chief U.S. District Court Judge
John J. Sirica, presiding over a
fact-finding hearing into two
Watergate-related recordings the White
House says never were made,
interrupted the fourth day of

proceedings to say:
"As long as we're going into this
detail, will someone please get word to
Miss Woods that she will be called as a
witness in this case?"
Douglas Parker, a White House
lawyer, said he assumes Miss Woods
will be permitted to testify.
The White House deferred
comment and Miss Woods was not
available for comment.
Presidential aide Stephen V. Bull

testified that Miss Woods reviewed
some of the nine tapes sought in the
subpoenas, frequently typing at the
same time.
But Bull repeatedly refused to say
whether Miss Woods was making a
transcript and said he didn't even ask.
"I intentionally did not do this
because it was not my business," he
said.
Bull said Miss Woods began
listening to the tapes and typing Sept.
29 at Camp David, Md., and continued
this work the next week in Washington
and through the following weekend at
Key Biscayne, Fla., where Nixon has a
home.
When she was not working with the
recordings, Bull said, the tapes were
kept in a safe in her office and in a
specially obtained heavy safe, guarded
24 hours a day, at Key Biscayne.
Meanwhile, the Senate Watergate
committee sought to determine
whether Nixon would meet with panel
members to give his account of the
Watergate scandal.
White House Contact
Chairman Sam J. Ervin Jr., D-N.C.,
said after a committee executive
session yesterday morning that panel

lawyers would contact White House
counsel to determine whether the
President would meet with the
committee.
Nixon would not be made to testify
under oath and the panel members
would meet with him at the White
House if necessary, Ervin said.
The meeting was called to consider
a proposal by Sen. Lowell P. Weicker
Jr., R-Conn., that the committee offer
to meet with Nixon at the White
House and publish a record of the
proceedings afterward.
No Comment
The White House had no direct
comment on the proposed meeting,
but a spokesman said Nixon intends to
deal with Watergate matters "in a clear
and fair way."
In another action, the committee
heard public testimony from four
witnesses called by Republican
members to discuss so-called dirty
tricks allegedly perpetrated against the
Nixon re-election campaign last year.
Vice chairman Howard H. Baker Jr.
R-Tenn., promised at the outset of the
dirty tricks phase of the hearings
several weeks ago that the Republicans
would expose a number of cases
involving Democrats.

Chief U.S. District Court Judge
John J. Sirica, presiding over a
fact-finding hearing into two
Watergate-related recordings the White
House says never were made,
interrupted the fourth day of

proceedings to say:
"As long as we're going into this
detail, will someone please get word to
Miss Woods that she will be called as a
witness in this case?"
Douglas Parker, a White House
lawyer, said he assumes Miss Woods
will be permitted to testify.
The White House deferred
comment and Miss Woods was not
available for comment.
Presidential aide Stephen V. Bull

testified that Miss Woods reviewed
some of the nine tapes sought in the
subpoenas, frequently typing at the
same time.
But Bull repeatedly refused to say
whether Miss Woods was making a
transcript and said he didn't even ask.
"I intentionally did not do this
because it was not my business," he
said.
Bull said Miss Woods began
listening to the tapes and typing Sept.
29 at Camp David, Md., and continued
this work the next week in Washington
and through the following weekend at
Key Biscayne, Fla., where Nixon has a
home.
When she was not working with the
recordings, Bull said, the tapes were
kept in a safe in her office and in a
specially obtained heavy safe, guarded
24 hours a day, at Key Biscayne.
Meanwhile, the Senate Watergate
committee sought to determine
whether Nixon would meet with panel
members to give his account of the
Watergate scandal.
White House Contact
Chairman Sam J. Ervin Jr., D-N.C.,
said after a committee executive
session yesterday morning that panel

lawyers would contact White House
counsel to determine whether the
President would meet with the
committee.
Nixon would not be made to testify
under oath and the panel members
would meet with him at the White
House if necessary, Ervin said.
The meeting was called to consider
a proposal by Sen. Lowell P. Weicker
Jr., R-Conn., that the committee offer
to meet with Nixon at the White
House and publish a record of the
proceedings afterward.
No Comment
The White House had no direct
comment on the proposed meeting,
but a spokesman said Nixon intends to
deal with Watergate matters "in a clear
and fair way."
In another action, the committee
heard public testimony from four
witnesses called by Republican
members to discuss so-called dirty
tricks allegedly perpetrated against the
Nixon re-election campaign last year.
Vice chairman Howard H. Baker Jr.
R-Tenn., promised at the outset of the
dirty tricks phase of the hearings
several weeks ago that the Republicans
would expose a number of cases
involving Democrats.
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
