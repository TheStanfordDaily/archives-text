# Healing Cut Possible To Conserve Energy
## 
### JOHN FREED 
Heating student residences for only
a few hours per day could be a partial
solution to this winter's expected
energy' crisis, according to Stanford's
chief energy allocator.
Dan DeYoung, director of Plant
Services here, said a severe winter
could force drastic energy
conservation measures.
"It's possible to heat the dorms for
a few hours a day and keep them
warm. They're good, substantial
buildings," DeYoung said last night on
KZSU's Campus Conference.
He noted that heat for classrooms
would be reduced before the same
would occur for dorms.

"There's no question that the
hospital, first, and where we live,
second, will have [priority] over
classrooms," DeYoung stated.
Natural Gas Cut
Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E)
intends to cut off the University's
natural gas supply for almost four days
this winter, according to DeYoung.
Since natural gas is used to heat
University buildings, Stanford holds
oil reserves to run the heating plant
during the cutoff periods.
But PG&E will cut off gas supplies
for longer periods this winter if the
weather is unusually cold. Stanford
only holds about five days of oil
reserves. And oil reserves are frozen at
that level by Federal law.
Since PG&E and the federal
government effectively limit
Stanford's energy supplies, not all of
the University's energy demands will
be met in the event of a harsh winter.
DeYoung said that Plant Services has
been taking measures to reduce
Stanford's energy demand.
"At nighttime many buildings are
lit with no people in them, so the
janitorial service can work." DeYoung
says that these services will be
rescheduled for daytime. Other large
energy consumers here are large air
blowers and motors that keep fresh air
circulating in some buildings. These
will be shut off when the buildings are
unoccupied, DeYoung promised.
Individual Effort
While acknowledging that energy
supplies controlled by students and
faculty are "insignificant," DeYoung
hoped that individuals would make
efforts to reduce energy consumption.
"In many University buildings,
Jordan Hall for example, people in the
rooms have the ability to control the
heat," DeYoung noted. He added that
cutback in energy use at the individual
level "is the first step in the
recognition of the problem."
Prospects for the 1974-75 winter
are even bleaker, according to
DeYoung, since PG&E plans to cut off
University gas supplies for more than a
week. Unless Federal oil allocations
are changed, Stanford will face at least
two full days without heat in that
winter.

fuel for almost a month. What energy

is available is rising quickly in cost.
DeYoung cited a 35 percent increase
in electricity costs in the last year.
Stanford is very dependent on
PG&E gas because oil costs about
twice as much for heating purposes,
DeYoung estimated.
'Problem And Opportunity'
While DeYoung preferred to call
the situation a "problem and
opportunity," rather than a crisis, he
admitted that the University "may run
short of fuel for this and the next two
years," and could "face brownouts or
blackouts" over the same period.
He said that students would have to
learn to live with it, terming the
condition a "crisis" against his own
advice.
"The energy crisis ... is something
we'll face for [the rest of] our
lifetimes," DeYoung forecast.
Gasoline supplies could be the only
non-critical aspect of the energy
situation here.
"I don't believe we'll run into any
[gasoline] shortage this winter,"
DeYoung observed.
DeYoung said that recent electrical
blackouts at various locations across
the campus were not part of his

conservation concept. "If it was, it'd
be a pretty poor way. You should have
heard the phones ring yesterday."
He added that the power failures
were not limited to Stanford.
"Last night.. . there were power
failures all over the East Bay. The best
way to avoid [this] is to put all power
lines underground," said DeYoung.
"The whole state and the nation are
faced with shortages of fuel," he
concluded.

University buildings, Stanford holds
oil reserves to run the heating plant
during the cutoff periods.
But PG&E will cut off gas supplies
for longer periods this winter if the
weather is unusually cold. Stanford
only holds about five days of oil
reserves. And oil reserves are frozen at
that level by Federal law.
Since PG&E and the federal
government effectively limit
Stanford's energy supplies, not all of
the University's energy demands will
be met in the event of a harsh winter.
DeYoung said that Plant Services has
been taking measures to reduce
Stanford's energy demand.
"At nighttime many buildings are
lit with no people in them, so the
janitorial service can work." DeYoung
says that these services will be
rescheduled for daytime. Other large
energy consumers here are large air
blowers and motors that keep fresh air
circulating in some buildings. These
will be shut off when the buildings are
unoccupied, DeYoung promised.
Individual Effort
While acknowledging that energy
supplies controlled by students and
faculty are "insignificant," DeYoung
hoped that individuals would make
efforts to reduce energy consumption.
"In many University buildings,
Jordan Hall for example, people in the
rooms have the ability to control the
heat," DeYoung noted. He added that
cutback in energy use at the individual
level "is the first step in the
recognition of the problem."
Prospects for the 1974-75 winter
are even bleaker, according to
DeYoung, since PG&E plans to cut off
University gas supplies for more than a
week. Unless Federal oil allocations
are changed, Stanford will face at least
two full days without heat in that
winter.

DeYoung cited a 35 percent increase
in electricity costs in the last year.
Stanford is very dependent on
PG&E gas because oil costs about
twice as much for heating purposes,
DeYoung estimated.
'Problem And Opportunity'
While DeYoung preferred to call
the situation a "problem and
opportunity," rather than a crisis, he
admitted that the University "may run
short of fuel for this and the next two
years," and could "face brownouts or
blackouts" over the same period.
He said that students would have to
learn to live with it, terming the
condition a "crisis" against his own
advice.
"The energy crisis ... is something
we'll face for [the rest of] our
lifetimes," DeYoung forecast.
Gasoline supplies could be the only
non-critical aspect of the energy
situation here.
"I don't believe we'll run into any
[gasoline] shortage this winter,"
DeYoung observed.
DeYoung said that recent electrical
blackouts at various locations across
the campus were not part of his

conservation concept. "If it was, it'd
be a pretty poor way. You should have
heard the phones ring yesterday."
He added that the power failures
were not limited to Stanford.
"Last night.. . there were power
failures all over the East Bay. The best
way to avoid [this] is to put all power
lines underground," said DeYoung.
"The whole state and the nation are
faced with shortages of fuel," he
concluded.
Heating student residences for only
a few hours per day could be a partial
solution to this winter's expected
energy' crisis, according to Stanford's
chief energy allocator.
Dan DeYoung, director of Plant
Services here, said a severe winter
could force drastic energy
conservation measures.
"It's possible to heat the dorms for
a few hours a day and keep them
warm. They're good, substantial
buildings," DeYoung said last night on
KZSU's Campus Conference.
He noted that heat for classrooms
would be reduced before the same
would occur for dorms.

"There's no question that the
hospital, first, and where we live,
second, will have [priority] over
classrooms," DeYoung stated.
Natural Gas Cut
Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E)
intends to cut off the University's
natural gas supply for almost four days
this winter, according to DeYoung.
Since natural gas is used to heat
University buildings, Stanford holds
oil reserves to run the heating plant
during the cutoff periods.
But PG&E will cut off gas supplies
for longer periods this winter if the
weather is unusually cold. Stanford
only holds about five days of oil
