# Healing Cut Possible To Conserve Energy

### JOHN FREED 
Heating student residences for only
a few hours per day could be a partial
solution to this winter's expected
energy' crisis, according to Stanford's
chief energy allocator.
Dan DeYoung, director of Plant
Services here, said a severe winter
could force drastic energy
conservation measures.
"It's possible to heat the dorms for
a few hours a day and keep them
warm. They're good, substantial
buildings," DeYoung said last night on
KZSU's Campus Conference.
He noted that heat for classrooms
would be reduced before the same
would occur for dorms.

"There's no question that the
hospital, first, and where we live,
second, will have [priority] over
classrooms," DeYoung stated.
Natural Gas Cut
Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E)
intends to cut off the University's
natural gas supply for almost four days
this winter, according to DeYoung.
Since natural gas is used to heat
University buildings, Stanford holds
oil reserves to run the heating plant
during the cutoff periods.
But PG&E will cut off gas supplies
for longer periods this winter if the
weather is unusually cold. Stanford
only holds about five days of oil
reserves. And oil reserves are frozen at
that level by Federal law.
Since PG&E and the federal
government effectively limit
Stanford's energy supplies, not all of
the University's energy demands will
be met in the event of a harsh winter.
DeYoung said that Plant Services has
been taking measures to reduce
Stanford's energy demand.
"At nighttime many buildings are
lit with no people in them, so the
janitorial service can work." DeYoung
says that these services will be
rescheduled for daytime. Other large
energy consumers here are large air
blowers and motors that keep fresh air
circulating in some buildings. These
will be shut off when the buildings are
unoccupied, DeYoung promised.
Individual Effort
While acknowledging that energy
supplies controlled by students and
faculty are "insignificant," DeYoung
hoped that individuals would make
efforts to reduce energy consumption.
"In many University buildings,
Jordan Hall for example, people in the
rooms have the ability to control the
heat," DeYoung noted. He added that
cutback in energy use at the individual
level "is the first step in the
recognition of the problem."
Prospects for the 1974-75 winter
are even bleaker, according to
DeYoung, since PG&E plans to cut off
University gas supplies for more than a
week. Unless Federal oil allocations
are changed, Stanford will face at least
two full days without heat in that
winter.
In 1975-76 PG&E plans to cut off
fuel for almost a month. What energy

HEATING CUTBACK? — Plant Services Director Dan DeYoung said last night
on Campus Conference that residence halls could face heating cutbacks if winter
temperatures are severe.
