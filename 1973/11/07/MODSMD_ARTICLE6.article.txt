# Students, Foreign Studies Committee Discuss Fate Of Beutelsbach Campus
## 
### EZRA GREENHOUSE 
Setting the tenor of a meeting of the Committee on
Foreign Studies Programs (CFSP) to determine the fate of
the Beutelsbaeh campus, History Dept. Chairman Gordon
Craig observed that "present costs of the program promise
to become intolerable." Furthermore, he noted its
"continuation precludes doing anything else in Germany."
Addressing his opening remarks to about 75 students in
Tresidder, Craig said that "no member of the committee is
not dedicated to a Stanford University program in
Germany." Nevertheless, he maintained that "music and
art" facilities in Beutelsbaeh were "deficient" and that the
present program did not "satisfy the interests of all
students" anxious to pursue foreign study.
Referring to the new concern with European political
integration and economics, and the larger questions of
security and arms control, Craig revealed an interest in
pilot programs that would "experiment" with such
studies. He said the Beutelsbaeh program did not permit
such "pedagogic" possibilities.
Wishing neither to compromise their advocacy of
Beutelsbaeh, nor to place themselves at a disadvantage to
the more knowledgeable committee, former Beutelsbaeh
students agreed at their meeting Monday not to attempt

to propose alternative study programs.
Junior Rob Spitzer presented a petition with the
signatures of 175 students calling for the continuation of
Beutelsbach.
Recapitulating arguments outlined in a series of
position papers circulated among the committee members,
Spitzer claimed that Beutelsbach's unique location and
living conditions gave students an opportunity to
experience German culture and society unequaled by any
program in the larger cities of Germany.
Senior Allen Stewart said that many students "stayed
on to work in mental health and agriculture programs."
He maintained that changes in the program as now
constituted would threaten its most attractive aspects.
Senior Tim Peterson argued that the university had
spent $180,000 on the trial of former English Prof. Bruce
Franklin, and $400,000 to "punch two holes in the
football field," and therefore could well afford to sustain
the Beutelsbach losses.
Later discussion centered on declining student interest
in foreign study. Responding to faculty requests for
suggestions, several students charged that Stanford
inadequately publicized its overseas piograms, and that
many courses taught on foreign campuses were
inappropriate to a thorough study of foreign culture.
