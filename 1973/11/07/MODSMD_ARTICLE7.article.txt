# Subtle Massacres Continue
## Anthropologists Ignore Indian Culture 
### 
Into each life, it is said,
some rain must fall. Some
people have bad horoscopes,
others take tips on the stock
market. McNamara created the
TFX and the Edsel. Churches
possess the real world. But
Indians have been cursed above
all other people in history.
Indians have anthropologists.

There is a new course at
Stanford, a course on the history
of American Indians; however,
this course is being offered by,
you guessed it, the Anthropology
Department. Before all you
readers rush off to gawk at the
splendor of this unusual class, it
might be wise to consider a few of
the idiosyncrasies of
anthropologists, since the class is
being taught by one.
Any anthropologist worth his
salt has a history of field work
behind him, and the most
convenient place to go for field
work in this country is an Indian
reservation. Every summer,
reservations swarm with
research-grant-laden
anthropologists. These dedicated
scholars take exhaustive notes on
their observations, and if they are
lucky, they will be taken into the
confidence of a few members of
the tribe, there to learn some of
the most cherished tribal secrets.
Upon returning from the field,
the anthropologists write detailed
articles and books on what they
have seen and heard, all of it in
the coldest, most impersonal
prose imaginable, like some
cookbook. They then advance
another rung on the academic
ladder, leaving their tribal hosts
with nothing but resentment,
always in the same state of
poverty that the anthropologists,
with their research money, had
found them.
$10 Million
An anthropologist once
claimed that he had spent almost
ten million dollars over twenty
years studying a tribe of less than
a thousand members. If that much
money had been invested in
medical programs and tribal
businesses to provide
employment, a tribe that size
would easily be self-sufficient
today.
A proposal once discussed in
Indian circles stated that an
anthropologist be required to
contribute to tribal funds an
amount equal to the amount of

money that he proposed to spend
on his study. When the idea was
suggested to anthropologists, they
protested indignantly in the name
of academic freedom. As far as I
know, the proposal has not been
put into effect in any form
anywhere.
Meanwhile the massacres
continue. You may think they
ended with Wounded Knee, but
today they are carried out in more
subtle ways by our government.
Many of them are disguised as
programs to help Indian people,
such as the Allotment Act of
1887.
Termination Program
More recently we run across
Congress's termination program,
initiated by former Indian
Commissioner Dillon Myer, who
was also director of the Japanese
internment camps during World
War 11. Doing away with
reservations simply by adding key
amendments to certain bills was
an idea that found instant appeal
among budget-minded legislators
of the 19505.
Termination of reservations
means the end of government
services, particularly medical
services, and the beginning of
taxation for Indian people. When
the Menominees of Wisconsin
were recently bullied into
termination by Congress, the
reservation hospital was forced to
close down due to lack of funds.
Infant mortality and tuberculosis
rose almost immediately among
the Menominees. Other tribes
have faced similar nightmares.
Some tribes are too poor to send
representatives to Washington to
protest.
It is too late to count how
many Indians have died because
termination deprived them of
medical assistance. Today our
government's termination policy
survives through the efforts of
that noble democrat, Senator
Henry Jackson, and his trusted
aide, James Gamble.
No Water, Heat
There is an Asian type of
poverty in America today .Go to th<
back country of any Indian
reservation, if your Firebirds and
Porsches will make it up the dirt
roads. See what the people are
living in. Even a ghetto has
running water, electricity, and
heat.
Why have the needs of Indians
become invisible to the
consciences of the American
people? Perhaps this Asian
poverty is an embarrassment to

certain individuals in our
government. If it is ignored long
enough, perhaps it will go away.
But the government is not the
only force that is maintaining the
Indians' invisibility.
Anthropologists have been doing
their part for years by obscuring
the truth about Indian people
with their academic platitudes. To
learn these platitudes in their
most distilled form, one need only
approach the average Stanford
alumnus, who has undoubtedly
had a few anthro courses to
contribute to his/her well-rounded
education.
"What are Indians?" he/she
will muse. "They are dreamers
without power! They are warriors
without weapons!" Hogwash.
They are people without adequate
food, clothing, housing, or
medical facilities.
No Stanford Action
You may wonder what
Stanford is doing to combat the
body of ignorance in this area.
Are there any classes on poverty
in the Economics Department?
Some readers may be familiar

• Jon Daunt

with Michael Harrington's classic
study of poverty, The Other
America, Indians are not
mentioned once in that book.
How about a good lesson in
muckraking for journalists in the
Communications Department? A
trip to only a few Indian
reservations would fill a
good-sized newspaper.
In the mean time, don't count
on much treatment of Indian
heritage in the History
Department, and as for those
bastions of progressive education,
the Undergraduate Specials and
the SWOPSI program, forget it.
You may also wonder what
students are doing to combat this
body of ignorance. Are any of
them telling their professors what
they want to learn? Perhaps some
of them are. Perhaps others will
ask themselves a few questions on
the way to their next
anthropology class.

Stanford last March and is
presently living in Gates Mills,
Ohio.)
