# More Than A Legal Issue
## Suicide: A Community Loss 
### 
I appreciate Bill Evers' effort
to clarify an issue which is quite
cloudy in our culture, the
question of "the right to commit
suicide" (Daily, Nov. 1). Evers'
article is instructive, as many
people still hold that suicide is a
wrong that should be prohibited by
the state and/or condemned by
religious groups. Such attitudes
are obstacles to a sensitive and
humane reaction to suicide.
Unfortunately, Evers'
libertarian apologetics are a sadly
inadequate appraisal of the suicide
problem, giving us no grounds for
dealing positively with suicide as a
serious problem in our society.
Some additional comments are
needed, or we may find ourselves
applauding the next suicide off
the Golden Gate Bridge as a bold
"exercise and expression of
human freedom."
By his nature, Evers asserts,
man is "a free-willed,
choice-making creature."
Furthermore, a person must be
"legally free to act as he wills with
his own" in order to be capable of
making "the choices that would
constitute a good and moral life."
From this it follows that
"choosing to kill oneself is legally
one's right."
In a legal sense it is and must
be one's right to commit suicide.
But this concept of rights leaves
men standing isolated and alone,
each with his bag of liberties. This
concept of rights refers to the
rights of a monad: to do what one
wants, provided it doesn't intrude
on the self-centered domain of
another monad.
No Man Is An Island
But men are interdependent,
not independent, and the rights of
monads cannot alone provide an

adequate principle to describe the
interaction of persons in society.
A person perceives that it is
important to him that other
persons live — their life is not
merely their possession ("if they
want it"), but it is that very
quality he hopes for them to
fulfill, because he sees his life as
bound up in theirs.
Legal freedom is not the first
condition necessary to enable a
person to live a good and moral
life. Men are capable of attaining
goodness and morality in spite of
restrictive political and
environmental conditions.
Viktor Frankl has said that
human freedom is "not freedom
from conditions, but freedom to

take a stand toward conditions."
Sartre said that the crucial test is
"what man makes of what has
been made of him."
But in order to attain human
freedom, one must first be mature,
self-conscious, and responsible,
and for the development of these
qualities one relies not on himself
alone but on the nurturing
support of his community. In the
monad's terms, one always has the
"right" to be free, but in reality,
one does not possess at birth the
capacity to be free.
Growth Requires Others
As an infant one is almost
totally dependent on others. A
person grows through interaction

i Jim Regan

with others. Ashley Montagu says
that development is one's
birthright, and that "what the
human organism requires most for
its development is a nutriment of
love." Healthy human life, he
says, develops toward
cooperation; "for the person and
for the species love is the form of
behavior having the highest
survival value."
In order to "be in a position to
make the choices that would
constitute a good and moral life,"
I rely on you. We are
interdependent, and none of us
grows without each other. We
confer identity upon one another;
"we are the creators of human
beings, and we shall always have
around us the kind of human
beings that we make." (Montagu)
So I grant you the right to kill
yourself, but it would be a further
tragedy if I were to take no
interest in your life, feel no loss at
the destruction of your life, no
acute pain that my community is
still sadly fractured and unhealthy
and callous enough to allow one
of its members to be a walking
dead man who finally takes into
his own hands what little life
remains. Should any person
choose this "freedom," I am sorry
that we have not given him the
freedom to live.
I agree with Mr. Evers on this
point: it is hypocritical and cruel
for me to condemn someone for
choosing to kill himself.
Moreover, I may as well assist that
person toward a painless death, if
I am not willing to embrace him
and revitalize his life.

"legally free to act as he wills with
his own" in order to be capable of
making "the choices that would
constitute a good and moral life."
From this it follows that
"choosing to kill oneself is legally
one's right."
In a legal sense it is and must
be one's right to commit suicide.
But this concept of rights leaves
men standing isolated and alone,
each with his bag of liberties. This
concept of rights refers to the
rights of a monad: to do what one
wants, provided it doesn't intrude
on the self-centered domain of
another monad.
No Man Is An Island
But men are interdependent,
not independent, and the rights of
monads cannot alone provide an

adequate principle to describe the
interaction of persons in society.
A person perceives that it is
important to him that other
persons live — their life is not
merely their possession ("if they
want it"), but it is that very
quality he hopes for them to
fulfill, because he sees his life as
bound up in theirs.
Legal freedom is not the first
condition necessary to enable a
person to live a good and moral
life. Men are capable of attaining
goodness and morality in spite of
restrictive political and
environmental conditions.
Viktor Frankl has said that
human freedom is "not freedom
from conditions, but freedom to

take a stand toward conditions."
Sartre said that the crucial test is
"what man makes of what has
been made of him."
But in order to attain human
freedom, one must first be mature,
self-conscious, and responsible,
and for the development of these
qualities one relies not on himself
alone but on the nurturing
support of his community. In the
monad's terms, one always has the
"right" to be free, but in reality,
one does not possess at birth the
capacity to be free.
Growth Requires Others
As an infant one is almost
totally dependent on others. A
person grows through interaction

i Jim Regan

with others. Ashley Montagu says
that development is one's
birthright, and that "what the
human organism requires most for
its development is a nutriment of
love." Healthy human life, he
says, develops toward
cooperation; "for the person and
for the species love is the form of
behavior having the highest
survival value."
In order to "be in a position to
make the choices that would
constitute a good and moral life,"
I rely on you. We are
interdependent, and none of us
grows without each other. We
confer identity upon one another;
"we are the creators of human
beings, and we shall always have
around us the kind of human
beings that we make." (Montagu)
So I grant you the right to kill
yourself, but it would be a further
tragedy if I were to take no
interest in your life, feel no loss at
the destruction of your life, no
acute pain that my community is
still sadly fractured and unhealthy
and callous enough to allow one
of its members to be a walking
dead man who finally takes into
his own hands what little life
remains. Should any person
choose this "freedom," I am sorry
that we have not given him the
freedom to live.
I agree with Mr. Evers on this
point: it is hypocritical and cruel
for me to condemn someone for
choosing to kill himself.
Moreover, I may as well assist that
person toward a painless death, if
I am not willing to embrace him
and revitalize his life.

I appreciate Bill Evers' effort
to clarify an issue which is quite
cloudy in our culture, the
question of "the right to commit
suicide" (Daily, Nov. 1). Evers'
article is instructive, as many
people still hold that suicide is a
wrong that should be prohibited by
the state and/or condemned by
religious groups. Such attitudes
are obstacles to a sensitive and
humane reaction to suicide.
Unfortunately, Evers'
libertarian apologetics are a sadly
inadequate appraisal of the suicide
problem, giving us no grounds for
dealing positively with suicide as a
serious problem in our society.
Some additional comments are
needed, or we may find ourselves
applauding the next suicide off
the Golden Gate Bridge as a bold
"exercise and expression of
human freedom."
By his nature, Evers asserts,
man is "a free-willed,
choice-making creature."
Furthermore, a person must be
"legally free to act as he wills with
his own" in order to be capable of
making "the choices that would
constitute a good and moral life."
From this it follows that
"choosing to kill oneself is legally
