# O'Grady, Ogletree Cite Plans

### DENIS CUFF First of Two Parts 
Interests of ASSU Council of
Presidents members vary greatly,
observes Vice President Charles
Ogletree. "When you have a black, two
Jews and an Irish-Catholic working
together, you've got to expect
different interests and political
feelings."
Since their election five months
ago, Ogletree and ASSU President
Kevin O'Grady point to the
organization of the Legal Counseling
Office and development of plans for
the Action Research Liaison Office
(ARLO) and a black students' cultural
center as examples of their efforts.
Financed by the $1 fee assessment
voted last spring, the Legal Counseling
Office (LCO) in the Old Union offers
free legal counseling to all Stanford
students upon request. Though
students must pay at least part of
in-court costs, the effectiveness of the
office will not be hindered because
"90 percent of legal cases never reach
court anyway," O'Grady said.
The staff of one lawyer and several
law students has seen "about 10
students an afternoon" discussing rent
and housing disputes and other
matters, O'Grady said.
Black Cultural Center
Ogletree is planning a black
students' cultural center, a University
residence that would reflect modern
black culture with films, speakers,
artists, seminars and other activities.
The center would provide an
alternative to Roble Hall, the black
theme house, Ogletree said.
Because Roble is only 30 percent
black, it has many problems giving a
true picture of black life, Ogletree
contended. "Roble has fallen far short
of my ideals for the cultural center,"
he said.
Ogletree is planning a black student
exchange program with schools across
the country. He said that the need for
the program arises from black
students' lack of interest in the
overseas programs. Ogletree mentioned
Howard and Fisk Universities and
Spellman College as possible
participants in the program.
Research Effort
O'Grady said his most important
project is ARLO, an experimental
program to test how research needed
by community organizations, faculty
and social action groups can be carried
out by students working for academic
credit.
O'Grady said he hopes to hire a
director and find student volunteers
by early December so that students
can start projects in January. The
criminal justice division of the
American Friends Service Committee
and the California Coastal Commission
have expressed interest in ARLO,
O'Grady said.
The need for ARLO arises from
organizations that can't afford
research and students who are already
doing research and throwing it away or
letting it sit in file boxes, O'Grady
