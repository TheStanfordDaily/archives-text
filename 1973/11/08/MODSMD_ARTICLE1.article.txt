# O'Grady, Ogletree Cite Plans
## 
### DENIS CUFF First of Two Parts 
Interests of ASSU Council of
Presidents members vary greatly,
observes Vice President Charles
Ogletree. "When you have a black, two
Jews and an Irish-Catholic working
together, you've got to expect
different interests and political
feelings."
Since their election five months
ago, Ogletree and ASSU President
Kevin O'Grady point to the
organization of the Legal Counseling
Office and development of plans for
the Action Research Liaison Office
(ARLO) and a black students' cultural
center as examples of their efforts.
Financed by the $1 fee assessment
voted last spring, the Legal Counseling
Office (LCO) in the Old Union offers
free legal counseling to all Stanford
students upon request. Though
students must pay at least part of
in-court costs, the effectiveness of the
office will not be hindered because
"90 percent of legal cases never reach
court anyway," O'Grady said.
The staff of one lawyer and several
law students has seen "about 10
students an afternoon" discussing rent
and housing disputes and other
matters, O'Grady said.
Black Cultural Center
Ogletree is planning a black
students' cultural center, a University
residence that would reflect modern
black culture with films, speakers,
artists, seminars and other activities.
The center would provide an
alternative to Roble Hall, the black
theme house, Ogletree said.
Because Roble is only 30 percent
black, it has many problems giving a
true picture of black life, Ogletree
contended. "Roble has fallen far short
of my ideals for the cultural center,"
he said.
Ogletree is planning a black student
exchange program with schools across
the country. He said that the need for
the program arises from black
students' lack of interest in the
overseas programs. Ogletree mentioned
Howard and Fisk Universities and
Spellman College as possible
participants in the program.
Research Effort
O'Grady said his most important
project is ARLO, an experimental
program to test how research needed
by community organizations, faculty
and social action groups can be carried
out by students working for academic
credit.
O'Grady said he hopes to hire a
director and find student volunteers
by early December so that students
can start projects in January. The
criminal justice division of the
American Friends Service Committee
and the California Coastal Commission
have expressed interest in ARLO,
O'Grady said.
The need for ARLO arises from
organizations that can't afford
research and students who are already
doing research and throwing it away or
letting it sit in file boxes, O'Grady
said. He explained that ARLO could
improve the motivation of many
students if they knew their research
was designed to contribute to the
solution of pressing social problems.
O'Grady is also working with the
Farmworkers' Support Committee, the
Nixon impeachment effort and the
drive to affect political change in
Chile.
No Incompatibility
"I don't find any incompatibility in
so-called 'outside polities' and my
position," O'Grady said. "National
issues have campus ramifications. It's
very difficult to separate the two."
University officials told the FSC
recently if there is a "clear indication"
students are not eating non-union
goods, then the Food Service will not
serve them, O'Grady said. But the
problem remains in identifying
non-union products like lettuce and
determining what the University
means by "clear indication," he
explained.
The Nixon impeachment campaign
has put tables in White Plaza and
near-by shopping centers, circulated
impeachment petitions and sponsored
the "Congressman of the Day"
program, which urges students to write
one congressman each day of the week
calling for impeachment.
Ogletree is also trying to organize
an ASSU cultural events board,
expansion of black enrollment and a
guest-in-residence program on trial-run
this fall.
The guest-in-residence program,

which co-ordinates efforts with theme
houses and dorms to invite speakers to
campus, is hoping for appearances by
Jesse Jackson, Angela Davis and
George McGovern later this year.

has put tables in White Plaza and
near-by shopping centers, circulated
impeachment petitions and sponsored
the "Congressman of the Day"
program, which urges students to write
one congressman each day of the week
calling for impeachment.
Ogletree is also trying to organize
an ASSU cultural events board,
expansion of black enrollment and a
guest-in-residence program on trial-run
this fall.
The guest-in-residence program,

which co-ordinates efforts with theme
houses and dorms to invite speakers to
campus, is hoping for appearances by
Jesse Jackson, Angela Davis and
George McGovern later this year.
Interests of ASSU Council of
Presidents members vary greatly,
observes Vice President Charles
Ogletree. "When you have a black, two
Jews and an Irish-Catholic working
together, you've got to expect
different interests and political
feelings."
Since their election five months
ago, Ogletree and ASSU President
Kevin O'Grady point to the
organization of the Legal Counseling
Office and development of plans for
the Action Research Liaison Office
(ARLO) and a black students' cultural
center as examples of their efforts.
Financed by the $1 fee assessment
voted last spring, the Legal Counseling
Office (LCO) in the Old Union offers
free legal counseling to all Stanford
students upon request. Though
students must pay at least part of
in-court costs, the effectiveness of the
office will not be hindered because
"90 percent of legal cases never reach
court anyway," O'Grady said.
The staff of one lawyer and several
law students has seen "about 10
students an afternoon" discussing rent
and housing disputes and other
matters, O'Grady said.
Black Cultural Center
Ogletree is planning a black
students' cultural center, a University
residence that would reflect modern
black culture with films, speakers,
artists, seminars and other activities.
The center would provide an
alternative to Roble Hall, the black
theme house, Ogletree said.
Because Roble is only 30 percent
black, it has many problems giving a
true picture of black life, Ogletree
contended. "Roble has fallen far short
of my ideals for the cultural center,"
he said.
Ogletree is planning a black student
exchange program with schools across
the country. He said that the need for
the program arises from black
students' lack of interest in the
overseas programs. Ogletree mentioned
Howard and Fisk Universities and
Spellman College as possible
participants in the program.
Research Effort
O'Grady said his most important
project is ARLO, an experimental
program to test how research needed
by community organizations, faculty
and social action groups can be carried
out by students working for academic
credit.
O'Grady said he hopes to hire a
director and find student volunteers
by early December so that students
can start projects in January. The
criminal justice division of the
American Friends Service Committee
and the California Coastal Commission
have expressed interest in ARLO,
O'Grady said.
The need for ARLO arises from
organizations that can't afford
research and students who are already
doing research and throwing it away or
letting it sit in file boxes, O'Grady
said. He explained that ARLO could
improve the motivation of many
students if they knew their research
was designed to contribute to the
solution of pressing social problems.
O'Grady is also working with the
Farmworkers' Support Committee, the
Nixon impeachment effort and the
drive to affect political change in
Chile.
No Incompatibility
"I don't find any incompatibility in
so-called 'outside polities' and my
position," O'Grady said. "National
issues have campus ramifications. It's
very difficult to separate the two."
University officials told the FSC
recently if there is a "clear indication"
students are not eating non-union
goods, then the Food Service will not
serve them, O'Grady said. But the
problem remains in identifying
non-union products like lettuce and
determining what the University
means by "clear indication," he
explained.
The Nixon impeachment campaign
has put tables in White Plaza and
near-by shopping centers, circulated
impeachment petitions and sponsored
the "Congressman of the Day"
program, which urges students to write
one congressman each day of the week
calling for impeachment.
