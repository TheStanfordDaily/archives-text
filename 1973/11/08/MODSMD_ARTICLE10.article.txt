Neither Vice Is Good
Editor:
Two items in a recent issue
serve more to point up the
immaturity and lack of foresight
in the writers than make an effort
to enlighten.
On the front page was an item
indicating the presumption that
Little Leland's Pub will be
authorized and expanded to
permit serving of alcoholic
beverages. The ASSU officers
seem to have promised to assure
this promotion.

The other topic, related, was
headed "SEX OR VIOLENCE -
WHICH IS MORE OBSCENE?"
and purported to defend "Deep
Throat" by comparing it with
"Dirty Harry."
I say these articles are related
because they once again dredge up
the old plaint of the immature
"What's wrong with marijuana —
it's no worse than liquor, which
"your" generation has used for
years." Or, "What's wrong with
pornography, it's no worse than
violence, which "your" generation
has condoned for years."
This argument is not too
brilliant. Again it points up the
stupidity of he who would say
"Cyanide is worse than arsenic,
therefore it's all right for me to
drink arsenic."
Why do intelligent youth
choose one narcotic to defend
over another one, when both are
dangerous and debilitating?
Recent studies indicate college
kids as leaving the "drug scene"
and turning instead to liquor. It
would appear that they aren't
"leaving" at all, and that our new
generation is bound to continue
or even accept more fully the
mistakes of the past generation.

Finance Dilemma
Editor:
The right side and the left side
of the front page of Tuesday's
Daily (Nov. 6) constitutes an
unintentional but useful example
of the dilemmas in University
financing. The right side of the
page contains two stories
reporting the understandable
dismay of students at the news

that a tuition increase of 7.6
percent is to be recommended to
the Board of Trustees. On the left
is a report on the "Save
Beutelsbach" panel in which
another group of students urges
that the campus be retained in
spite of an $80,000 annual loss
because "We feel that it is worth
it."
This University is full of
programs whose advocates believe
in their worth. What makes the
situation so difficult is not that
they are wrong, but that more
often than not they are right. The
desire to do as many of the things
that are "worth it" as possible,
together with uncontrollable cost
rises have led Stanford along
several related courses. One is the
Budget Adjustment Program,
another is the Campaign for
Stanford, and a third — unhappily
but necessarily — is the need to
increase tuition.
A great deal will be said in the
coming weeks about the tuition
increase proposed for 1974-75.
We shall surely hear different
figures defended — 6 percent, 7.6
percent, 10 percent — as if they
were abstractions having intrinsic
virtue unconnected either to the
people or the institution to which
they refer. The front page of
Tuesday's Daily is a helpful
reminder of the real world of
painful choice among competing
choices in which such decisions
are actually made.

Orwell Misquoted
Editor:
In the Oct. 29 edition of the
Daily a column by David Amor
was published. Mr. Amor's
column consisted of a hysterical,
Marxist analysis of a previous
column by Dr. Shockley.
In the column Mr. Amor used
the word "Newspeak." This word

was invented by George Orwell to
express his contempt for the
moral fraud of Communism.
George Orwell hated Marxist
jargon which is used to make ugly
things sound impressive.
George Orwell wrote in a clear
and simple manner. I think he
would turn in his grave if he heard
Mr. Amor's definition of
Newspeak, "a conscious
mystification meant to conceal
analytic content behind an
emotional smokescreen."
When Mr. Amor uses George
Orwell's word to support his
musings on unequivocable
historical sequences, the ruling
class, the coming crisis of the
capitalist system, hypercritical
paranoia and what-not, it is a clear
case of the devil quoting scripture.
I have a better slogan for Mr.
Amor to use against Dr. Shockley
— "Deprivation of existence
campaign." This was the name of
a campaign organized by Lo
Jui-Ching, Minister of Public
Security of the Peoples Republic
of China in which 5-10 million
people were executed between
1950 and 1955.
According to the Guinness
Book of Records it was the
biggest mass murder campaign
ever. (Calling the person in charge
of murdering the public the
Minister of Public Security is a
nearly perfect example of
Newspeak as the word was used
by Orwell.)
"The alternative that this
dichotomization suppresses is that
of real structural transformations
that could attack problems of
poverty and oppression at their
source." —David Amor
"The great enemy of clear
language is insincerity. When there
is a gap between one's real and
one's declared aims, one turns as
it were instinctively to long words
and exhausted idioms, like a
cuttlefish squirting out ink."
—George Orwell
