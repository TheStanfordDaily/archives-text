# MIT President Backs 'New Technology'

### CHRIS TOREM 
Critics of technological
progress who think a slowdown of
research and development is
necessary are "completely
wrong," Dr. Jerome Wiesner,
president of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, said
Tuesday night in a speech at the

Faculty Club.
"Our problems need new
technology to be solved. We need
the ability to choose between
alternative solutions. But we also
need to communicate the range of
available choices to all members
of society," he said.
• Wiesner, former science adviser
to Presidents Kennedy and
Johnson, called for
interdisciplinary analyses of the
"tradeoffs of costs and benefits"
to society of innovations in broad
fields such as health care and
energy use. He stated that
mathematical and engineering
models can now predict the
behavior of society as a whole to a
given change.
"We may be entering into a
period where the consequences of
major technological innovations
may be judged before they are
entered into," he said.
Wiesner criticized scientists for
having "deliberately excluded"
discussion of social issues in the
past, but added that scientists are
becoming more concerned about
the impact of their work on the
public. He also felt that "some
scientists had better be politicians"

in order to explain their findings
to legislators and combat public
fear and mistrust of technology.
Although he was optimistic
that "man can modify his
behavior and his policies fast
enough" to avoid disaster, Wiesner
warned that scientists would have
to change their attitudes to deal
with current crises in pollution,
energy and transportation.
"In the past, we had thought
we could produce the good life
for everybody. Today we know
that it's a finite world."
Among the projects set up at

M.I.T. to "stop catastrophe" are
studies into the social and
economic consequences of nuclear
power, natural gas use and
improved health care.
Wiesner also jabbed at the
Nixon administration and at one
of its foremost scientific
supporters, Dr. Edward Teller.
"While I hate to hit an
administration while it's down, I
don't think this one has the
capability to deal with any
scientific or technological
problem," he contended.
Wiesner called Teller

"paranoid" and "irrational." "I've
seen Teller lie to Presidents and I
see no reason why he shouldn't lie
to you," he told the audience of
about 100 MJ.T. alumni.
According to Phil Richardson,
president of the local M.I.T.
alumni chapter, Teller had
attacked Wiesner and M.I.T. for
being "soft" on military defense
in a speech at Stanford last year.
Before the speech, Wiesner
presented citations to nine M.I.T.
alumni who had assisted last
year's tour of their University
Orchestra.

scientists had better be politicians"

in order to explain their findings
to legislators and combat public
fear and mistrust of technology.
Although he was optimistic
that "man can modify his
behavior and his policies fast
enough" to avoid disaster, Wiesner
warned that scientists would have
to change their attitudes to deal
with current crises in pollution,
energy and transportation.
"In the past, we had thought
we could produce the good life
for everybody. Today we know
that it's a finite world."
Among the projects set up at

M.I.T. to "stop catastrophe" are
studies into the social and
economic consequences of nuclear
power, natural gas use and
improved health care.
Wiesner also jabbed at the
Nixon administration and at one
of its foremost scientific
supporters, Dr. Edward Teller.
"While I hate to hit an
administration while it's down, I
don't think this one has the
capability to deal with any
scientific or technological
problem," he contended.
Wiesner called Teller

"paranoid" and "irrational." "I've
seen Teller lie to Presidents and I
see no reason why he shouldn't lie
to you," he told the audience of
about 100 MJ.T. alumni.
According to Phil Richardson,
president of the local M.I.T.
alumni chapter, Teller had
attacked Wiesner and M.I.T. for
being "soft" on military defense
in a speech at Stanford last year.
Before the speech, Wiesner
presented citations to nine M.I.T.
alumni who had assisted last
year's tour of their University
Orchestra.

TOUGHING IT OUT — The leaders in higher education have come
under increasing fire in recent years for buckling too easily to
pressure. Vice Provost Robert M. Rosenzweig has discovered that
alcohol administered internally is an ideal way to strengthen his
intestinal fortitude.
Critics of technological
progress who think a slowdown of
research and development is
necessary are "completely
wrong," Dr. Jerome Wiesner,
president of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, said
Tuesday night in a speech at the

Faculty Club.
"Our problems need new
technology to be solved. We need
the ability to choose between
alternative solutions. But we also
need to communicate the range of
available choices to all members
of society," he said.
• Wiesner, former science adviser
to Presidents Kennedy and
Johnson, called for
interdisciplinary analyses of the
"tradeoffs of costs and benefits"
to society of innovations in broad
fields such as health care and
energy use. He stated that
mathematical and engineering
models can now predict the
behavior of society as a whole to a
given change.
"We may be entering into a
period where the consequences of
major technological innovations
may be judged before they are
entered into," he said.
Wiesner criticized scientists for
having "deliberately excluded"
discussion of social issues in the
past, but added that scientists are
becoming more concerned about
the impact of their work on the
public. He also felt that "some
scientists had better be politicians"

in order to explain their findings
to legislators and combat public
fear and mistrust of technology.
