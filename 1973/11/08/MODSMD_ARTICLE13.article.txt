# Man Dies From Poisoning
## 
### 
A 20-year-old musician died of
poisoning at the University
hospital on Tuesday after eating a
meal of wild mushrooms with a
friend on Sunday. His companion
was also treated for poisoning but
was not admitted to the hospital.
Hospital spokesman Spyros
Andreopoulos said the dead man,
identified as Michael Kimble of La

Honda, was a victim of one of
three species of extremely toxic
Amanita mushrooms. The
mushrooms are very common in
the local area during the spring
and fall, according to
Andreopoulos.
"It seems that almost every
year we have to announce

poisoning cases during this
season," stated Andreopoulos.
"They are especially severe
because there is no known
antidote to the toxin. There are
drugs which can limit the
poisoning's spread but they must
be administered within eight
hours to have any effect at all."
He added that cooking the
mushrooms has no effect on their
poison.
Hospital physician Peter Rudd
noted that Amanita poisoning
symptoms often are similar to
those of cholera. Like Kimble,
mushroom victims are usually first
admitted after complaining of
severe stomach pains. Nausea and
vomiting are other early
symptoms. A period of apparent
improvement often follows; then
the victim shows liver, kidney and
central nervous system disorders
which can lead to death.
Because the mushrooms'
toxicity varies greatly with the
size, age and species of the
mushrooms, doctors cannot
specify exact lethal doses of the
mushrooms, according to
Andreopoulos. He noted,
however, that physicians advise
extreme caution for all wild
mushroom pickers, since species
are easily confused and Amanita
varieties are among the most
common.
