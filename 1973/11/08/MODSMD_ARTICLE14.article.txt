# W. Germans Consider Oil Shortage Reaction
## 
### 
BONN, Germany (AP) — The
West German Parliament began
urgent study yesterday of a bill
that would give Chancellor Willy
Brandt's government sweeping
powers to conserve fuel in an
Arab oil squeeze.
The bill has already won
opposition support and was
expected to become law by
Friday.
It would clear the way for the
government to take such steps as
banning Sunday pleasure driving,
imposing new speed limits and
rationing gasoline and heating oil
this winter. It would also
authorize the government to take
whatever steps are necessary to
reduce oil use as tb' \rab cutback
is felt.

Brandt has promised to consult
the Christian Democratic
opposition before issuing any
decrees. Bonn sources said some
steps such as the proposed Sunday
driving ban could be decreed as
early as this weekend.
West Germany, richest and
most populous Common Market
member, gets about 70 percent of
its oil imports from Arab states.
Economics Minister Hans
Friderichs told a news conference
that the government does not plan
to make immediate use of its new
emergency powers.
He called for a "calm reaction"
by West Germans and said: "We
have every reason not to worsen
the situation through exaggerated
hysteria."
