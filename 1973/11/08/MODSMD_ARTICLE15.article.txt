# New Device Measures Heart Flow
## 
### 
University physicists and heart
specialists are now measuring
heart blood flow and other
functions through a new device
which detects the heart's magnetic
signals.
The new technique, still in the
experimental stage, is noninvasive,
safer and can be repeated more
often than present methods to
diagnose heart conditions.
A patient is placed in a
magnetic shield which reduces
magnetic intereference from
power lines, autos and other
sources. A superconducting
magnet is aimed at the heart to
boost the normally weak earth's
magnetic field encompassing the
heart so that changes produced by
blood flow can be picked up by a
magnetometer, and recorded and
analyzed by computer.
The device records two signals.
One is the heart's magnetic field
generated by its electrical activity
and called the magnetocardio
gram. The second signal, called
magnetic susceptibility flow
(MSF), is generated by the heart's
contractions in the constant
magnetic field created by the
magnet. This signal measures the
blood flow.
