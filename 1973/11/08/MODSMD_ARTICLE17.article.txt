BERKELEYâ€” Future attorneys
among college undergraduates in
northern California can get
reliable help today and tomorrow
in planning the often formidable
task of gaining admission to law
school.
Representatives of 37 law
schools from throughout the
country will be on hand to answer
questions of prospective students.
The annual Pacific Pre-Law
Conference will be held today in
Rooms 271-272 of Tresidder
Union; and tomorrow in the
International House Auditorium,
University of California at
Berkeley. Hours are 10 a.m. to
4:30 p.m. both days.
"Law school admissions have
evolved from a simple, statistical
process into an incredibly
complex and competitive field,"
according to Thomas K. Trutner,
conference coordinator and
assistant dean of students at U.C.
Berkeley.
"The purpose of the
conference is not to conduct

admissions interviews; rather, it is
to help pre-law students get
reliable information for making
sound decisions on their legal
education and career."
California law schools to be
represented include Stanford,
U.C. at Berkeley (Boalt Hall),
Davis, UCLA, Hastings, University
of San Francisco, and Santa Clara.
Among the others are Harvard,
Yale, Boston University,
Pennsylvania, Georgetown, and
Northwestern.
