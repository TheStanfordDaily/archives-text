WASHINGTON (AP) - A
series of confrontations between
Nixon supporters and the two
Democratic standard-bearers in
the 1972 presidential election
were planned at Nixon's
re-election headquarters,
according to a memo introduced
Tuesday at the Senate Watergate
hearings.
The "confidential-eyes only"
memo said the confrontations had
been successful in gaining media
coverage, upsetting the
Democratic candidates and in one
case, causing presidential
contender George McGovern's
campaign schedule to bej
restricted. I
The memo was dated Sept. 23, i
1972 and was written by Nixon!
campaign aide E. D. Failor toJeb!
Stuart Magruder, deputy director'
of Nixon's re-election committee.:
Magruder later pleaded guilty'
to one count of conspiracy in ,
connection with the Watergate]
cover-up.
The memo includes a report on j
confrontation activities using 1
youthful supporters of the.
President. It said the activities
were directed by Kenneth Reitz,
the Nixon campaign's youth
director.
The campaign was directed
against McGovern and his vice
presidential running-mate, Sargent
Shriver.
Failor wrote, "I have."
personally endeavored to create
an encounter between Shriver and
a busing opponent on the busing
issue for today in Las Vegas.. .
He said "definite pluses for our
campaign" had resulted from
what he called excellent
television, radio and print
coverage of some of the staged
confrontations.
"It should be pointed out that
other Republican types,
undoubtedly, will be copying this^

week's activities on their own in
their localities," Failor said. "We
have no control over the activities
we do not program."
He said a planned McGovern
walking tour at an Italian street
festival in New York City was
canceled and McGovern spoke in a
barricaded area, apparently as a
result of earlier activities by
Nixon workers in Flushing, N.Y.
In the Flushing incident, a
group of youngsters bearing
pro-Nixon placards engaged in a
rowdy shoving match with
McGovern supporters.

McGovern had planned to
shake hands with subway
commuters during the evening
rush hour, but his plans were
disrupted by the melee and Secret
Service bodyguards whisked him
away from the scene with red
lights flashing and sirens blaring.
An attached report from Reitz
listed confrontation activities in
Milwaukee, Detroit, Columbus,
Ohio, Flushing and Bergen
County, N.J.
The memo was introduced into
the record by Sen. Joseph M.
Montoya, Dâ€”N.M.
