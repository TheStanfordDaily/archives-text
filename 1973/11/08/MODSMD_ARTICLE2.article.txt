# President's Authority Curbed
## War Bill Veto Overridden 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - Congress
handed President Nixon a major defeat
yesterday by enacting into law over his
veto its historic bill to curb presidents'
war powers.
The 60-day limit on presidents'
power to commit U.S. combat troops
abroad without Congress' approval
became law immediately when the
Senate overrode the veto.
The Senate vote was 75 to 18, or
13 more than required.
The House overrode the veto hours
earlier 284 to 135, four more than the
two-thirds needed.
Coalition Opposed
The war powers bill was opposed
on the final vote by a coalition of
President Nixon's supporters and
antiwar congressmen who contended it
would grant presidents new power to
wage war up to 60 days without
congressional approval.
Sen. Thomas F. Eagleton, D-Mo.,
called the bill "blank-check authority
to carry us into war" and said Nixon
could use it immediately if he wanted
to send U.S. combat troops into the
Middle East.
But Senate Armed Services
Chairman John C. Stennis, D-Miss.,
and Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey,
D-Minn., said the bill was never
intended to restrict presidents' war
powers but instead require that
Congress share the burden of
committing Americans to war.
'Watergate Hysteria'
Sen. John Tower, R-Tex., urged
that the Senate get "not so caught up
in the hysteria of Watergate" as to
enact the war powers bill "to kick the
President while he is down."
Congress' override of the
President's veto was its first in nine
tries this year and the fifth since
Nixon became President.
After the House vote, President
Nixon issued a statement saying it
"seriously undermines this nation's

ability to act decisively and
convincingly in times of international
crisis."
Confidence Diminished
The confidence of American allies
could be diminished, he said, and "our
potential adversaries may be
encouraged to engage in future acts of
international mischief..."
Inspired by the Vietnam war, the
bill was intended to prevent the
United States from becoming involved
in such a conflict without Congress'
specific approval. Many congressmen
switched from their traditional
positions.
Nixon vetoed the bill two week
ago, calling its curbs on presidential
war powers "both unconstitutional

and dangerous."
Critical Points
He particularly criticized two
sections:
The first requires a president to
withdraw any U.S. combat forces he
commits abroad on his own after 60
days unless Congress votes approval of
the commitment by then.
The president, however, could
extend that period another 30 days if
he told Congress in writing the time
was needed to safely withdraw the
forces he had committed.
The second provides that Congress
:an halt the war commitment any time
ksjuring the 60 or 90 days with a simple
House-Senate concurrent resolution
not subject to a president's veto.
