# Kennedy's Motives 'Political'
## Historian Theorizes On Crisis 
### 
President Kennedy could have
settled the October 1962 Cuban
missile crisis privately, but for
political reasons chose to make it
an open confrontation, a
University historian believes.
Barton J. Bernstein, associate
professor of history, came to this
conclusion after research and a
two-and-a-half year battle to
declassify hitherto secret
correspondence between Kennedy
and Soviet Premier Nikita
Khrushchev.
The "secret" label was finally
removed Oct. 3, just over a month
ago.
Bernstein, whose field is
contemporary American history,
also believes that the missile crisis
"did not upset the military
balance of power between the

U.S. and the Soviet Union, which
then overwhelmingly favored the
U.S. The missiles did not
significantly impair American
military security."
Retreat Or Escalation
In forcing Khrushchev to a
choice between retreat or
escalation, Bernstein says,
"Kennedy acted dangerously and
unnecessarily."
In Bernstein's opinion,
Kennedy forced the issue for
political reasons — for fear the
news of the Soviet missiles in
Cuba would leak out (it did) and
thus the Democrats would lose in
the forthcoming November
elections for being defensively
off-guard "and the bright future
[KennedyJ hoped he could shape
would be lost."

JFK felt that a test of personal
and national will was at stake and
"had a tendency, like many
leaders, to personalize
challenges," Bernstein believes.
Irony
"The strategy of confrontation
reveals a painful irony in the Cold
War: a nation might have to
threaten to go to nuclear war, and
perhaps to do so, in order to
maintain the credibility which is
designed to make war unnecessary
and untimely."
His research of the formerly
secret documents, reveals the
following, he reports:
1. The famous "long telegram"
from Khrushchev to Kennedy of
Oct. 26, 1962, was called
"hysterical" by some news
analysts, but it is not, in
Bernstein's opinion. "It can be
described as a longwinded,
somewhat repetitious 'lecture' by
an older man to a younger man.
There are constant references to
the need for peace and the horrors
of war."
2. Khrushchev quarrels with
Kennedy's conception that the
Soviet missiles in Cuba are
"offensive." "The distinction
between offensive and defensive,
if determined by the capability of

the weapon, are meaningless in
most cases" in the same sense a
cannon is, according to the Soviet
premier.
Missiles For Defense 1
3. Affirming that the missiles
in Cuba are for the defense of that
nation, he implies that the
additional missiles don't make a
Soviet attack any more likely. He
warns: "One cannot give way to
passion."
4. Khrushchev points out that
Kennedy had said that he
''sympathized with
counter-revolutionary movements
in Cuba and that he supported
them." Therefore, according to
the Soviet premier, there was need
for Soviet assistance to defend
Cuba.
Khrushchev's message of Oct.
23, before the U.S. blockade
started, called Kennedy's action a
"serious threat to peace and
security," but did not then say
that the Soviet would disregard
the blockade, according to
Bernstein's findings.
"That was not said privately
until [Khrushchev's] letter to
Kennedy of Oct. 24," Bernstein
writes, "in which he labeled
Kennedy's action as an
'ultimatum.'

missile crisis privately, but for
political reasons chose to make it
an open confrontation, a
University historian believes.
Barton J. Bernstein, associate
professor of history, came to this
conclusion after research and a
two-and-a-half year battle to
declassify hitherto secret
correspondence between Kennedy
and Soviet Premier Nikita
Khrushchev.
The "secret" label was finally
removed Oct. 3, just over a month
ago.
Bernstein, whose field is
contemporary American history,
also believes that the missile crisis
"did not upset the military
balance of power between the

U.S. and the Soviet Union, which
then overwhelmingly favored the
U.S. The missiles did not
significantly impair American
military security."
Retreat Or Escalation
In forcing Khrushchev to a
choice between retreat or
escalation, Bernstein says,
"Kennedy acted dangerously and
unnecessarily."
In Bernstein's opinion,
Kennedy forced the issue for
political reasons — for fear the
news of the Soviet missiles in
Cuba would leak out (it did) and
thus the Democrats would lose in
the forthcoming November
elections for being defensively
off-guard "and the bright future
[KennedyJ hoped he could shape
would be lost."

JFK felt that a test of personal
and national will was at stake and
"had a tendency, like many
leaders, to personalize
challenges," Bernstein believes.
Irony
"The strategy of confrontation
reveals a painful irony in the Cold
War: a nation might have to
threaten to go to nuclear war, and
perhaps to do so, in order to
maintain the credibility which is
designed to make war unnecessary
and untimely."
His research of the formerly
secret documents, reveals the
following, he reports:
1. The famous "long telegram"
from Khrushchev to Kennedy of
Oct. 26, 1962, was called
"hysterical" by some news
analysts, but it is not, in
Bernstein's opinion. "It can be
described as a longwinded,
somewhat repetitious 'lecture' by
an older man to a younger man.
There are constant references to
the need for peace and the horrors
of war."
2. Khrushchev quarrels with
Kennedy's conception that the
Soviet missiles in Cuba are
"offensive." "The distinction
between offensive and defensive,
if determined by the capability of

the weapon, are meaningless in
most cases" in the same sense a
cannon is, according to the Soviet
premier.
Missiles For Defense 1
3. Affirming that the missiles
in Cuba are for the defense of that
nation, he implies that the
additional missiles don't make a
Soviet attack any more likely. He
warns: "One cannot give way to
passion."
4. Khrushchev points out that
Kennedy had said that he
''sympathized with
counter-revolutionary movements
in Cuba and that he supported
them." Therefore, according to
the Soviet premier, there was need
for Soviet assistance to defend
Cuba.
Khrushchev's message of Oct.
23, before the U.S. blockade
started, called Kennedy's action a
"serious threat to peace and
security," but did not then say
that the Soviet would disregard
the blockade, according to
Bernstein's findings.
"That was not said privately
until [Khrushchev's] letter to
Kennedy of Oct. 24," Bernstein
writes, "in which he labeled
Kennedy's action as an
'ultimatum.'
President Kennedy could have
settled the October 1962 Cuban
missile crisis privately, but for
political reasons chose to make it
an open confrontation, a
University historian believes.
