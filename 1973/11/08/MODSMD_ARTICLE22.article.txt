# The 						American Film Theater
## 'Iceman' Achieves Total Excellence 
### DAVE MOYER 
The American Film Theatre
(AFT) is the most exciting thing
to happen to theatre and to film
in a very long time. It has
performed a marriage between
profound plays and great actors
and directors. As obvious a match
as this might seem, the ceremony
was long in coming. America has a
propensity of late for frustrating
great actors with inconsequential
scripts and confining the recent
"classics" to stock companies and
amateur groups who rarely do
them justice.
The AFT enlists such
monumental thespian talents as
Laurence Olivier, Paul Schofield,
Alan Bates, Katherine Hepburn,
Joan Plowright and Cyril Cusack,
and the directorial genius of a
Peter Hall, a Tony Richardson and
again Lord Olivier, challenging
them with such works as

Chekhov's Three Sisters, Albee's
A Delicate Balance, Pinter's The
Homecoming and lonesco's
Rhinoceros (and all of this is to
name but a few).
AFT operates on a limited
subscription basis offering eight
film-plays in as many months,
each shown only four times, in
500 theatres across the nation.
Made In Heaven
Judging from the first
production, this is truly a
marriage made in heaven. The
subject of the AFT's unveiling was
The Iceman Cometh by the
master of American drama,
Eugene O'Neill. This is one of
O'Neill's last works, written in
1939 and not performed until
1946; its elements are strongly
autobiographical. The setting is a
run-down, downtown New York
Citv bar.
It is the "last harbor" for a

group of derelicts, and its
inhabitants maintain existence by
constantly remaining drunk, living
on the romantic illusions or past
and future successes. Life is
tolerable only as seen through the
illusory lens of a whiskey glass.
These "pipe-dreams" (O'Neill
pummels the audience with the
redundance of this phrase, using it
over 200 times) are shattered by a
hardware salesman (Lee Marvin)
who brings reality and the image
of The Iceman as Death. He
breaks the spirits of his old
comrades as he tries to free them
from illusions in order that they
might share his inner peace.
When it is discovered that his
purgation of illusion will take him
to the electric chair, that he has
resigned himself to death, the
drunks are Ranted from
reality and escape telievedly back
into their Qomnxunal, bottles of
nickel red-eye.
No simple moral emerges.
Perhaps we must consider Larry's
explanation to be O'Neill's: "I
have no answer to give anyone,
not even myself." One is left
physically and emotionally
distraught by the unrelieved
darkness with which O'Neill
bludgeons his audience for (in this
case, with minor cutting) four
hours.
It is overly long and
repetitious, but, amazingly, never
boring for it maintains an
incessant intensity throughout.
The images are a bit heavy-handed,
the minor characters somewhat

sketchy (especially the clicheic
"tarts") but the overall impact is
undeniably powerful.
John Frankenheimer's
production was absolutely superb
to the last detail, capturing
entirely the age and the
atmosphere of a 1912 NYC bar.
He used the advantages of the
camera to good effect without
distorting or detracting from the
simple power of the spoken word,
as is often the case in filmed
plays.
His cast was individually highly
competent but collectively
brilliant. Fredric March's kindly
saloon owner, Harry Hope, was
simply, absolutely "right," which
is the highest compliment that can
be paid an actor. (That is to say,
at no time did Mr. March lapse
into being Mr. March, whereas Lee
Marvin, at times excellent, didn't
maintain quite the same
consistency.)
Moving
The late Robert Ryan was
particularly moving as the cynical
"grandstand philosopher" who is
constantly fighting his own
sympathetic sensitivity to others,
and who ultimately accepts sober
reality and its inevitable doom.
Among the lesser roles Moses
Gunn deserves particular mention
as the one-time proprietor of a
black gambling house, though
each and every part was
exceedingly strong as well (and it
is the smaller parts that usually
mark the difference between a
good production and a great one).
