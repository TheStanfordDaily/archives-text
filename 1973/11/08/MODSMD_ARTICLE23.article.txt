# Filmmaker Francois Truffaut
## 'I Always Improvise' 
### KAUTILYA 
When he stepped in you knew
you had seen him before. Vaguely
a bell rang but you could not
quite put your finger on it. And
then it dawned, bright and clear.
It was Antoine Doinel. The
deep-set eyes, the sharp nose, the
thin lips, and even the trenchcoat
was so familiar. But then he did
seem to have aged some — those
films must have been made quite a
few years ago.
Yes, Francois Truffaut had
made those quasi-autobiographical
films some time ago, and today he
is in San Francisco as an honored
guest at the International Film
Festival. The resemblance to
Doinel is indeed striking, and do
not feel bad if you were fooled —
many in France have fallen for it.
Truffaut's Day for Night was a
real success at both Festivals this
year in New York and in San

Francisco. His retrospective — the
only one in the evening — was the
most expensive fare at the Festival
here and yet was sold out weeks
in advance. There were two hours
of excerpts from 10 of his 13
films, a champagne toast in the
lobby, and the entire showing of
"The 400 Blows," his utterly
memorable first feature film.
But the high point of the
evening was the discussion period
with this gracious French director,
one of the fathers of the Nouvelle
Vague.
The simplicity of his statements
won over the audience. After
watching the clips, he said it was
"like opening a box of private
letters." When asked how much of
his work was autobiographical, he
said how the excerpts had
made him feel serious. "No film is
any more or less autobiographical
than the others." Truffaut spoke

with great charm, entirely in
French — and Mark Chase of the
Festival staff proved an able
interpreter.
The rap session at Truffaut's
press conference was more
intimate, and hence more
interesting. He was relaxed. His
new star. Jacqueline Bisset sat by
his side. He said how Day for
Night was always on his mind in
all these years that he has made
films. So many interesting little
things happen on the sets, but
they can't be shown. He admires
the courage of people who make
films like Z and State of Siege,
but he himself would not like to
make political films. Everything in
them has to be completely planned
beforehand — and"I always
improvise. Without it, life would
be too routine. Also, to
communicate a message in such a
film you have to be against
something." His movies are always
for some theme. "I have made
films in favour of love, in favour
of children, and now in favour of
films."
A woman mentioned how her
nine-year-old daughter thought
The Wild Child was the best film
she had ever seen. Truffaut said —

in halting English: "She
understood the film. Merci!"
There was an impish smile on his
face.
He had started as a film critic,
but does criticism ever get under
his skin? Once it did — when a
French critic reviewed Two
English Girls, and Truffaut really
disliked it."But I must have been
very tired then" — he added. He
says he does value the criticism of
other film directors.
Doinel
Is the series on Antoine Doinel
over, and if so why? A reflective
cloud passed over his face; for a
moment he was not there with us.
And then slowly he said,
"Jean-Pierre Leaud has ceased to
grow anymore." When asked if he
was against any type of film he
flatly said "No. Even
pornographic films have an innate
place in the spectrum." But then a
strong sentiment rose in him and
he declared: "If anybody shows
something about children that is
false or shameful, I'm indeed very
hurt." We knew then that the
Antoine of the films may have
ceased to grow, but the real life
Doinel will never cease to be a
child.
