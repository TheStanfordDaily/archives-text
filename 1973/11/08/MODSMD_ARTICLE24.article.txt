# Berkeley Jazz Show: Lack Of Spontaneity
## 
### VICKI LaBRIE 
BERKELEY - With the
winning combination of Michael
White, Gato Barbieri, and Alice
Coltrane, the concert at the
Berkeley Community Theatre
Saturday night should have
attained a high degree of musical
spontaneity, versatility, and
excellence. These three artists
have achieved recognition of their
talents on their various
instruments, but the performances
lacked inspiration and offered
repetitious stylizations of the
musicians themselves.
Violinist Michael White,
backed by drums, guitar, bass, and
percussion, seemed to have gained
prominence through the sheer
novelty of the violin as a jazz
instrument rather than through
his proficiency of it.
The number of jazz violinists
can probably be counted on one
hand. Still, that is no excuse for
muddy and inaudible playing.
Violin riffs and rippling guitar
pieced together a melody inlaid
over pulsating or steady rocking
rhythms. The only musicians
worthy of comment were bassist
Kenny Jenkins whose majestic
bowed accompaniment ably
supported a dirge-like number and
the percussionist who frequently
uplifted a dull performance with
his assortment of bells and blocks.
Thundering Rhythm
Gato Barbieri, a saxophonist
acclaimed for his composing, did
not exhibit the talent attributed
to him. A thundering rhythm
section (2 guitars, bass, recorder,
drums, congas, percussion, and
electric harp) provided a stirring
pulse under the raw-toned,
sometimes biting and often raspy
solo flights that were devoid of
texture or contrast. Barbieri
produced the same tones, similar
melodies, and little deviation from
a style he has nurtured which
potentially could display a lot
more imagination.
The musician often introduced

a number with rhythmic
variations and later stated the
theme as a bridge, usually a
romantic, melancholy,
minor-keyed melody that
launched him on to more
rhythmic and free form solos.
Although Barbieri's style is
vital and aggressive, he is capable
of exposing a tender side, which
he only presented while dueting
with a quavering, delicately
played recorder. At times, the
Brazilian jazzman seemed to be
testing the limits of his instrument
and the Latin rhythmic
accompaniment shaded his solos
with a feverish anxiety. With a
group as stimulating as Barbieri's,
a little variety would have
improved the performance
immensely.
Bad Habits
Alice Coltrane seemed to
follow the bad habit of the
preceeding group — not enough
contrast. Alice, backed by Reggie
Workman on bass, Indugu on
drums and her son Mickey on
sitar, alternated between Moog
and harp. Much of her music was
based on John Coltrane's
compositions and mixed with an
Eastern flavor. She has a claim on
the harp, but here she neglected it
dreadfully e pt for a solitary
warm-up that exuded shimmering,
caressing wavelengths of sound.
Drummer Indugu performed —
during the last song "Leo" — one
of the best drum solos I have ever
heard. He played his instrument
like an instrument, beginning
softly with taps on the cymbals,
then stroking the snares with his
hands, and purposefully ended
with a tight crescendo finish.
The audience sat in their seats
in an enervated trance as Alice
Coltrane glided offstage.
Generally, the performers played
well, but the lack of feeling and
inspiration left the audience cold
and bewildered and perhaps a
little frustrated from trying to
grasp what could have been an
exciting and satisfying experience.
