Ex-Aides Request Nixon Tapes
LOS ANGELES — Former presidential aides
John D. Ehrlichman and Egil Krogh have asked for
tape recordings of conversations involving them and
President Nixon, and Krogh has asked that the
President be subpoenaed for personal questioning
regarding the tapes, court records disclosed
yesterday.
The requests, in motions filed in Los Angeles
Superior Court, came in connection with burglary
and conspiracy charges pending against Ehrlichman
and Krogh involving a 1971 break-in at the office of
Daniei Ellsberg's psychiatrist.
Ehrlichman is also charged with perjury.
Krogh's attorney said in his motion that without
securing the President for oral examination and the
production of "all tape recordings and documents
within his possession, custody or control," relative
to the case, Krogh could not receive a fair trial.
He demanded specifically that the President turn
over information dealing with the creation of the
"room 16 group," otherwise known as the
"plumbers squad," which was assigned to plug leaks
of secret information.
Wholesale Prices Decline Again
WASHINGTON — Led by lower costs for farm
products, wholesale prices declined in October for
the second month in a row, the Labor Department
said yesterday.
The monthly Wholesale Price Index report
showed a 3.3 percent decline in prices of farm
products and processed foods. That could mean at
least temporary relief for grocery shoppers if the
reduction is reflected later in retail prices.
Over-all, wholesale prices fell by three-tenths of
one percent after adjustment for seasonal pricing
patterns following a sharp 1.5 percent decline in
September. Before any adjustment was made in the
index, the report showed that wholesale prices in
October declined five-tenths of one percent.
Despite these improvements, there was bad news
for consumers, too. Prices of industrial
commodities, mainly gasoline and other fuels and
metals, went up a sharp 1.1 percent.
That figure reflected an economy still gripped
with inflation.
Egypt, U.S. Resume Relations
CAIRO — Egypt and the United States
announced agreement yesterday for an early
resumption of diplomatic relations in the first
apparent dividend for Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger's personal diplomacy in the Arab world.
"I think we are moving toward peace," Kissinger
declared after conferring for more than three hours
with President Anwar Sadat.
"I agree with him," said Sadat, flashing a smile in
the bright sunshine. "For myself, let it be
immediate."
The accord to resume relations was announced a
few hours later, closing a diplomatic gap opened by
Egypt in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war because of
Washington's support for Israel.
The pleasant words after the talks and the
announcement of restored relations were positive
signs in Kissinger's search for a settlement to the

Middle East war of last month.
They apparently signaled Sadat's approval of the
American attempt to play the role of middle man
between the Arabs and Israel.
The new ambassadors will take their posts in 10
days.
Third Watergate Tape Missing?
WASHINGTON — The testimony of a
presidential aide yesterday raised a question of
whether part of yet a third White House Watergate
tape may be missing or nonexistent.
The testimony followed notification to U.S.
District Court Judge John J. Sirica that President
Nixon's personal secretary, Rose Mary Woods, will
testify at a hearing into a White House claim that
two crucial presidential conversations on Watergate
went unrecorded.
Sirica had summoned Woods to appear.
White House aide John C. Bennett testified
before Sirica that Woods called him into her office
Tuesday to say she had discovered a "gap" in a tape
recording made of presidential conversations.
Bennett, an aide to White House chief of staff
Alexander M. Haig Jr., said Woods did not describe
the tape she was listening to and he did not ask.
Bennett also said she told him that she was not
transcribing Watergate tapes and that his own
testimony of Tuesday — in which Bennett said he
was told that's what she was doing — was wrong.
Exactly which tapes Woods was listening to when
she discovered the gap presumably will have to
await her own testimony, now expected Thursday.
Police Probe Nine Murders
VICTOR — Police are searching for two men for
questioning in connection with the bloody,
execution-style murders of nine people in this tiny
San Joaquin County community.
Lt. Donald Morrow of the San Joaquin County
Sheriff's office said Douglas Gretzler, 22, of New
York City, and Willie Luther Steelman, 28, of Lodi,
are wanted for questioning in connection with the
murders which were discovered yesterday morning
by a hysterical girl.
Shocked police removed the bodies of two
couples, their four children and a friend, all shot in
the head, from the sprawling $60,000 home in this
small community 30 miles south of Sacramento.
The discovery of the bodies raised the four-year
total of California's mass murders to 67.
Morrow said the two men are already wanted on
warrants by Phoenix, Ariz., police for two murders
there Oct. 22.
"We want them because of the close association
between this crime and that which happened in
Phoenix," Morrow said.
Kemper Jury Ponders Case
SANTA CRUZ — A jury deliberated for
hours yesterday without reaching a verdict for
Edmund Emil Kemper 111, accused of the mutilation
slayings of his mother, her best friend and six
hitchhiking coeds.
The six-woman, six-man jury were scheduled to
resume their deliberations at 9 a.m. today.
Kemper, 25, has pleaded innocent by reason of
insanity to the murders.

"Two people are trapped in the body of a giant
— one acts for good, the other for evil," the defense
said yesterday in final arguments in Kemper's
three-week trial.
The 6-9, 280-pound defendant was brought to
court from the state facility at Vacaville where he
was transferred Tuesday for custodial purposes after
he attempted for a fourth time to take his own life
last weekend.
Defense attorney James Jackson argued that
Kemper had been living two different lives since he
was 8 years old. At the age of 15 he was convicted
of killing his paternal grandparents.
Santa Cruz Dist. Atty. Peter Chang argued that
taped-recordings made by Kemper and played in
court were true confessions of his guilt.
"The record shows without question that
Kemper fantasized about raping girls and killing
them and after several years he decided to try it."
Escapees To Decide Action
WADENA, Minn. — One of two jail escapees
holding three members of a farm family hostage said
last night he will make up his mind what to do by 8
a.m. today.
John P. Morgan, 37, said he and his 18-year-old
companion, William L. Winans, were still negotiating
with authorities on conditions for release of the
remaining hostages.
The escapees released three of the four children
of Mr. and Mrs. Elmer Wegscheid yesterday
afternoon, but remained barricaded in the family's
home last night with the Wegscheids and their son
Ed, 15.
Vietnamese Fighting Worsens
SAIGON — More than 50 South Vietnamese
fighter-bombers blasted military targets around the
Viet Cong administrative capital of Loc Ninh
yesterday in the heaviest air blitz since the
cease-fire, the Saigon military command announced.
The raid was called a punitive action retaliating
for recent Viet Cong attacks.
Viet Cong spokesman Capt. Phuong Nam said
120 bombs hit Loc Ninh airstrip, a market and
residential area in the city 75 miles north of Saigon.
He said the bombing killed or wounded more than
30 civilians and destroyed 40 houses and a hospital.
A Saigon military spokesman denied the market
area was hit and claimed the closest targets were
more than half a mile from the town.
The bombing marked the sharpest escalation of
fighting since the Jan. 27 Paris peace agreement and
increased fears of Communist sapper and rocket
attacks against Saigon as a return reprisal in
tit-for-tat operations.
Today's Weather
Mostly cloudy through tomorrow with local
showers mainly in the north bay area. Rain likely at
times tonight and tomorrow. Continued mild
temperatures. Low both nights in the mid 50s to
lower 60s. Highs today and tomorrow in the 60s.
Southerly winds 5 to 15 mph increasing to 15 to 25
mph late today. Chance of rain 30 percent today
and 60 percent tonight.
