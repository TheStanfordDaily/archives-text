# Vendors Threaten Tax Status
## 
### 
The vendors on White Plaza
may be jeopardizing the
University's tax-exempt status
because they use campus land to
sell for profit, according to Dan
Williams, associate dean of
Student Affairs.
No definite plan has been
approved, but a committee of
administrators from University
Relations, the Dean's office and
the Finance office are working
with University lawyer Mike
Hudnall to find a solution.
Williams said they hope to find
a way to keep current the tax
status without eliminating the
vendors.
